AMERICANS NEED BILL OF 
RIGHTS BACK 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. 
MCCLINTOCK. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
every American needs to see Angela 
Marsden’s tearful video as she pours 
out her frustrations as a small res-
taurant owner in Los Angeles. 
Forced to drastically curtail her 
business 
during 
California’s 
brutal 
shutdowns, she took out an $80,000 loan 
to meet all the expensive requirements 
to move her dining outside and salvage 
what was left of her life’s work. 
Instead, 
authorities 
arbitrarily 
changed the rules and shut her down 
again, a death sentence for her 10-year- 
old restaurant. Yet, the same authori-
ties permitted a film production com-
pany to offer the very same outdoor 
dining across the very same parking 
lot the day she had to close her busi-
ness. 
‘‘I am losing everything,’’ she says 
through her tears. ‘‘Everything I own 
is being taken away from me.’’ 
In Staten Island, police hauled a res-
taurant owner away in handcuffs for 
desperately trying to reopen his estab-
lishment just across the tracks from 
other restaurants where dining was al-
lowed under precisely the same condi-
tions. 
When asked to explain these capri-
cious standards, California’s Governor 
Gavin Newsom smarmed: Oh, I am 
deeply empathetic. 
Well, that must be a load off of their 
minds. 
The Fifth Amendment in our Bill of 
Rights specifically protects Americans 
from being deprived of life, liberty, or 
property without due process of law. 
Where are those rights today? 
Congress is now discussing how to 
provide relief for the thousands of 
small business owners, their employ-
ees, and the families that depend on 
them who have been crushed by these 
reckless edicts. 
As usual, politicians measure their 
empathy by how much they are willing 
to spend of other people’s money. 
But the fine point of the matter is 
this: Government cannot support the 
economy for any significant period of 
time because government does not fi-
nance the economy. It is the economy 
that finances the government. When 
you shut down the economy, you shut 
down the revenues that go to the gov-
ernment. 
The only genuine relief from the 
COVID lockdowns is to end the COVID 
lockdowns. Why is it so hard for some 
people to understand that? By now, it 
ought to be obvious that the lockdowns 
have failed to contain this virus. 
After 9 months of this unprecedented 
experiment in social engineering, the 
virus continues to spread. Common 
sense should tell us that the more in-
fectious a virus and the deeper it has 
already penetrated into a population, 
the less effective mass isolation will 
be. 
The plight of Angela Marsden and 
countless victims of these policies tell 
us clearly what we are very effectively 
accomplishing. We are destroying our 
society. 
We have set in motion countless 
avoidable deaths by suicide, drug and 
alcohol abuse, domestic violence, de-
ferred 
health 
treatments, 
deferred 
health screenings, and poverty that 
will stalk us for many years to come. 
We have robbed our youth of a year of 
their educations. 
Nearly half of American retailers say 
they are now in imminent danger of 
permanently closing. Forbes magazine 
reports: ‘‘The number one worry on 
most small business owners’ mind now 
is the threat of more government-man-
dated business closures.’’ 
Eleven million Americans who had 
jobs in February no longer have those 
jobs today. 
Modern science and its many break-
throughs 
in 
immunology, 
epidemi-
ology, and virology have given us ad-
vanced treatments and vaccines unpar-
alleled in human history. But science 
is grotesquely incompetent to reorder 
human societies or to change the laws 
of human nature, nor does it give offi-
cials the omniscience to know what is 
best for every person in every cir-
cumstance, nor does it give them the 
right to wantonly destroy people’s 
lives and livelihoods. After all, medi-
cine’s most ancient command is: First, 
do no harm. 
We have arbitrarily and indiscrimi-
nately destroyed the life’s work and

life’s dreams of millions of Americans 
like Angela Marsden. We have made 
the most sacred right of Americans to 
life, liberty, and the pursuit of happi-
ness into a hollow and bitter mockery. 
The American people don’t need the 
Governor’s empathy, and they don’t 
need politicians’ handouts. They need a 
government that protects their right 
to make a living and to lead their own 
lives according to their own best judg-
ment. 
They need their Bill of Rights back, 
and above all, they need their freedom 
back.

FAREWELL TO THE HOUSE OF 
REPRESENTATIVES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Massachusetts (Mr. KENNEDY) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to say good-bye to this body as 
my time serving the Fourth Congres-
sional District of Massachusetts comes 
to a close. 
This job has been an honor. We have 
come quite a long way since my first 
days in the Capitol when I had an AP 
reporter following me around for the 
day, and I got so lost trying to find the 
House floor that I ended up in the 
Longworth parking garage. 
Luckily, things have mostly im-
proved from there: 
Seeing my name on that office door 
for the first time; 
Keeping company with giants that I 
grew up idolizing, like John Lewis, 
Eliseo Medina, and Dolores Huerta; 
Having the honor of responding to 
Donald Trump’s first State of the 
Union from Diman Regional Voc-Tech 
in mighty Fall River, Massachusetts. 
There are a few people who I would 
not be here without. 
To my wife, Lauren: Thank you for 
serving alongside me, for the sacrifices 
that you made and the heart that you 
gave to this job, too. Tell Ellie and 
James that dad has breakfast, bath, 
and school drop-off duty for the next 15 
years or so. 
To the Massachusetts delegation: I 
loved serving with you. I loved learning 
from you. There is no team I would 
rather have been in the trenches with 
every day. 
To my constituents back home: I am 
so grateful for the trust that you put in 
me. My proudest moments were when 
you allowed me to bring your voice to 
this Chamber, when I could carry what 
you felt in Taunton or Attleboro or 
Fall River or Milford to this floor. 
Thank you for the privilege that you 
afforded me. I will see you back home 
soon. 
Finally, to the staff members who 
worked and thought and fought and 
talked and wrote and served alongside 
me over the course of the last 8 years; 
you all are the heroes behind my story. 
There will never be words for my grati-
tude for everything that you took on 
every single day—and so many nights— 
to ensure that we did this job right. I 
will miss not seeing all of your faces 
quite so often. 
Mr. Speaker, I leave this body proud 
and hopeful because here is what I 
know: that we are a complicated and 
messy country, that we violated our 
founding promises before the ink was 
dry. We boldly declared, ‘‘We the peo-
ple,’’ and promptly defined ‘‘we’’ as 
rich, White, Protestant men. We staked 
out moral high ground of life, liberty, 
and the pursuit of happiness, and paid 
for it with human bondage, abuse, and 
suffering that we carry to this day. 
But embedded in that history is a 
slow and stubborn story that every 
generation shares, a journey to heal 
those wounds, an understanding fought 
and bled for over time that we are in 
this mess together whether we like it 
or not. 
Our arc isn’t clean, but it is clear 
that each generation expands that defi-
nition of ‘‘we.’’ We suffer setbacks. We 
get pushed off track and sometimes 
can’t feel that progress. We fight 
amongst ourselves. But still, genera-
tion after generation, we expand. 
And that is the counterweight to the 
great lie of these times, that the Amer-
ican pie is finite; that for my family to 
survive, yours must suffer; that the 
richest Nation on Earth is somehow 
plagued by scarcity rather than greed. 
Loosening that lie’s grip on our coun-
try is the work of our generation—for 
people who feel unseen, unheard, and 
unrepresented; for the most in need of 
assistance and protection, justice and 
opportunity, who have been told by 
their government that there is no room 
or money or time or will. 
And that injustice is a reality etched 
in stone rather than a deliberate choice 
by those in power about who is worthy 
and who is not. 
I hope that in the months and years 
ahead, this body can help change that, 
that we will err on the side of expan-
sion, of inclusion, acceptance, equity, 
and grace, because history makes clear 
that the only true error is when we do 
the absolute opposite. 
Our future is big and bright, but it 
will take everything and everyone to 
reach it. I hope that a new generation 
of Americans will rise knowing that 
the people’s House stands tall for them. 
Mr. Speaker, it has been an honor. 
God bless and Godspeed.

DEMOCRATIC 
ELECTION 
THEFT 
EXPERT 
DESCRIBES 
HOW 
HE 
DOES IT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Alabama (Mr. BROOKS) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BROOKS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, this is my sixth speech in a series 
on voter fraud, election theft, and the 
Presidential election. 
Today, I cite an August 29, 2020, New 
York Post article that quotes exten-
sively from a New Jersey professional 
Democrat election theft expert’s de-
scription of how he steals elections 
using the en masse mailed ballot vot-
ing system. 
The election theft expert states he 
puts a real ballot into ‘‘the copy ma-
chine, and it comes out the same way.’’ 
‘‘But the return envelopes are ‘more 
secure than the ballot. You could never 
re-create the envelope.’ ’’ 
So envelopes had to be collected from 
real voters. The election theft expert 
adds: ‘‘He would have his operatives 
fan out, going house to house, con-
vincing voters to let them mail com-
pleted ballots on their behalf as a pub-
lic service. The fraudster and his min-
ions would then take the sealed enve-
lopes home and hold them over boiling 
water.’’ 
For those unaware, the process of 
collecting ballots from voters, it is 
called ballot harvesting and is legal in 
some States but illegal in others. 
The election theft expert continues: 
‘‘You have to steam it to loosen the 
glue.’’ 
‘‘He then would remove the real bal-
lot, place the counterfeit ballot inside 
the signed certificate, and reseal the 
envelope. ‘Five minutes per ballot 
tops,’ ’’ is how long he says it takes to 
steal a vote. 
The election theft expert adds that 
‘‘sometimes postal employees are in on 
the scam. ‘You have a postman who is 
a rabid anti-Trump guy, and he is 
working in Bedminster or some Repub-
lican stronghold. He can take those 
filled-out ballots, and knowing 95 per-
cent are going to a Republican, he can 
just throw those in the garbage.’ ’’ 
‘‘In some cases, mail carriers were 
members of his ‘work crew’ and would 
sift ballots from the mail and hand 
them over to the operative.’’ 
b 1015 
The election theft expert continues: 
‘‘With mail-in ballots, partisans from 
both parties hash out and count ballots 
at the local board of elections—debat-
ing which ballots make the cut and 
which need to be thrown out because of 
irregularities. 
‘‘Any ballots offered up by him or his 
operation would come with a bent cor-
ner along the voter certificate—which 
contains the voter signature—so Demo-
cratic board of election counters would 
know the fix was in and not to object.’’ 
The New York Post describes his vote 
theft methods as ‘‘organizationally, his 
voter fraud schemes in the Garden 
State and elsewhere resembled Mafia 
organizations, with a boss—usually the 
campaign manager—handing off the 
day-to-day managing of the mob sol-
diers to underboss—him. The actual 
candidate was usually kept in the dark 
deliberately so they could maintain 
‘plausible deniability.’’’ 
This Democrat election theft expert 
stunningly helps expose the sordid un-
derbelly of voter fraud and election 
theft that riddles America’s election 
system and too often makes official 
election results inaccurate and unreli-
able. 
As my prior speeches have detailed, 
voting in American elections by illegal

aliens and other noncitizens so out of 
control that Joe Biden openly solicited 
the illegal alien bloc vote and support 
with the promise of amnesty and citi-
zenship if they helped him get elected 
President. 
Further, en masse ballot mail-out 
schemes are illegal because they vio-
late Article I, Section 4 of the Con-
stitution and Congress’ ensuing legisla-
tion that designates one 24-hour day as 
the election day. More to the point, 
Congress could have but did not create 
an election week, an election month, or 
an election season. 
Mr. Speaker, the overwhelming, com-
pelling, and irrefutable evidence leads 
to but one conclusion: If only lawful 
votes cast by eligible American citi-
zens are counted, President Trump 
handily won the electoral college and 
reelection. 
Hence, on January 6, 2021, provided 
the required one Senator joins me, I 
will object to and vote to reject elec-
toral college submissions of Nevada, 
Georgia, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and 
all other States whose election systems 
are so badly flawed as to render their 
vote 
submissions 
unreliable, 
untrustworthy, and unworthy of ac-
ceptance. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the 
President-elect. 
f 
FIXING A BROKEN WASHINGTON 
MEANS BRIDGING PARTISAN DI-
VIDES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Utah (Mr. MCADAMS) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. MCADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
say farewell to this institution that I 
have been so lucky and honored to 
serve. 
I want to first thank my wife, Julie, 
for supporting my career in public 
service for the past 12 years and for 
these last 2 years while I have been a 
Member of the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives. It is an understatement 
to say that I could not have done this 
job without her, both in terms of her 
unconditional love and support, for 
taking care of our family while I have 
traveled back and forth to Washington, 
and as a thought partner, sounding 
board, strategic adviser, moral con-
science, and North Star. Any time that 
I was faced with a politically difficult 
dilemma, she would tell me to follow 
my conscience and stand for what I be-
lieve in. 
I want to also thank my four chil-
dren: James, Kate, Robert, and Isaac: 
Your humor, love, and support have 
kept me going even when things get 
tough. Thank you for allowing me to 
pursue this great adventure, and I am 
looking forward to more evenings at 
home with the four of you. 
I also want to thank my staff. I know 
that I have had one of the best staffs on 
Capitol Hill, and it is a testament to 
their hard work and their perseverance 
that we were able to accomplish as 
much as we did. So to Nichole, Tiffany, 
Alyson, Eric, Michelle, Andrea, Chris, 
Brennen, Julianne, Katie, Christian, 
Marcus, Hannah, and Stephanie, thank 
you. 
To the people of Utah who granted to 
me this opportunity, thank you. 
I also thank my House colleagues, 
Democrats and Republicans, for your 
ideas, for our constructive disagree-
ments. For those who shared my desire 
to work together to find solutions to 
our challenges, I am grateful. 
Mr. Speaker, I packed up my Wash-
ington, D.C., office this week with 
mixed emotions: pride in the work that 
I accomplished to support Utah’s hard-
working families, but frustrated at 
what did not get done. Nothing cap-
tures it quite like the failure to deliver 
to date much-needed emergency relief 
due to the coronavirus. 
We see this catastrophe happening in 
Utah and around the country. People 
are dying; people are sick; people are 
hurting economically; small businesses 
are on the brink of failure, and many 
have already failed. It is time for each 
and every one of us to step forward and 
to do our part. 
It is long past time for Congress to 
put the partisanship and politics aside 
and to do its job, to get it done and to 
show results. A bill that does not pass 
the House and Senate and get signed by 
the President means nothing to strug-
gling businesses or to a struggling fam-
ily. 
The partisan divide has taken a toll 
on public confidence in government’s 
ability to meet the challenges we were 
elected to solve. Americans recognize 
their distrust of the Federal Govern-
ment and each other is a problem that 
gets in the way of solving tough issues. 
A new type of polarization is gripping 
the country. 
As one researcher noted: ‘‘This level 
of political divisiveness on both sides 
creates a feedback loop of hatred and 
leaves the U.S. open to manipulation 
by foreign powers that wish to further 
these internal rifts.’’ 
I have tried to counter that in my 
public service by walking a centrist 
path: to heal and to listen where I can, 
to hear from all sides, and to find com-
mon ground. 
I believe it is important to elect peo-
ple willing to work across the aisle, 
people like me who build bridges rather 
than fan the flames. I have seen this 
work, whether it is working with Re-
publicans to counter the alarming rise 
in the rate of suicide or traveling to 
our southern border to get agreement 
for emergency food, housing, and med-
ical aid for refugees fleeing violence 
and danger in their home countries. 
Once you learn that people in both par-
ties agree on both humanitarian treat-
ment and securing the border, efforts 
can focus on ironing out the details. 
I was proud to represent Utah’s 
Fourth Congressional District during 
the 116th Congress, serving my commu-
nity, my State, and my country as an 
elected Representative in the people’s 
House. This was a great honor and a 
privilege. I am glad to have carried out 
their good ideas across the finish line, 
including four bills expected to be 
signed into law. 
I have built relationships with Re-
publicans and Democrats that led to 
success on clean air, stopping child 
trafficking, preventing suicide, and re-
covering investment savings for hard-
working seniors cheated by fraudsters. 
My wish this holiday season for those 
who serve next year in Congress is to 
be less partisan and more like Utahns 
who see the best in each other, who 
work together, roll up their sleeves, 
and solve problems together for the 
good of everyone. 
Godspeed, and may God bless the 
United States of America.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF OFFICER ANDY ORNELAS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. GARCI´A) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. 
GARCI´A 
of 
California. 
Mr. 
Speaker, while most Americans were 
sitting down to dinner and enjoying a 
relaxing evening with their families on 
November 23, a young California High-
way Patrol officer by the name of Andy 
Ornelas was on duty in the bucolic city 
of Palmdale. 
At 7:05 p.m., a vehicle turned directly 
into the path of Officer Ornelas’ motor-
cycle, causing a terrible accident. 
After a valiant fight for his life, Andy 
succumbed to his injuries and passed 
away 9 days later on December 2. 
I rise today to pay tribute to this 
precious hero who was taken from this 
world too soon. 
Men and women like Officer Ornelas 
make sacrifices and face danger on a 
daily basis while we, the average citi-
zens of this beautiful country and the 
beneficiaries of their service, remain 
wrapped in the warmth of the security 
blanket which they provide. 
While he was alive, we didn’t thank 
Officer Ornelas enough. We didn’t ap-
preciate him enough, and we certainly 
didn’t support him enough. 
As a society, we need to remember 
that these precious guardians of peace 
and security that they provide are sub-
jected to dangers that the average 
American cannot fathom. While they 
are alive, we need to honor our first re-
sponders more. 
Andy did things right. He did things 
for the right reason. He worked hard, 
he played hard, and he loved his friends 
and his family with purity and inten-
sity. We were all blessed to have him 
on his watch. 
My deepest condolences and prayers 
go out to Andy’s family. His mom and 
dad, his brother and uncle are all law 
enforcement officers. His wife, Taylor, 
now, more than ever, needs the full 
support of her Nation, the support of 
her State, and the support of her com-
munity. 
Andy is with God, and, Taylor, we are 
with you. At all times, we are at your

HONORING THE SERVICE OF BOB KELLAR 
Mr. 
GARCI´A 
of 
California. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to 
a good friend who is retiring after near-
ly six decades of noble and loyal serv-
ice to our Nation and to our State of 
California. 
Today, Mr. Bob Kellar is officially re-
tiring from the Santa Clarita City 
Council after more than 20 years in 
that role. During his tenure, he also 
served as mayor four times. 
Before his time on the city council, 
Bob Kellar also served our community 
as an LAPD officer for 25 years, and be-
fore that, he was a Green Beret in the 
U.S. Army. 
His list of accomplishments and lead-
ership roles in our community is too 
long to list here today. In the end, it is 
his kind character, his humble com-
portment, and his playful sense of 
humor that makes this patriot and 
public servant so special. 
I want to also thank Bob’s wife, 
Kathy, for making so many sacrifices 
in support of our community and coun-
try. 
Bob, I am proud to call you my 
friend, and I am honored to know you. 
Sir, you are one of the best Americans 
I have met. Congratulations on your 
retirement. 
HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE OF GENERAL 
CHUCK YEAGER 
Mr. 
GARCI´A 
of 
California. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the life 
of an American legend and aviation 
pioneer, General Chuck Yeager, who 
passed away this past Monday, Decem-
ber 7. 
Daring to be the first to break the 
sound barrier over California’s Mojave 
Desert, General Yeager achieved avia-
tion history in 1947 and launched the 
modern jet age. He did what many 
thought was impossible, and he did it 
over the skies of my district. 
But his dedication to our Nation and 
contribution to aeronautical sciences 
was greater than this one crowning 
achievement. He served in World War 
II as a fighter ace, shooting down 13 
German planes—5 in one day. 
In 1953, he set a world speed record by 
flying at nearly 21⁄2 times the speed of 
sound. 
From commanding the school train-
ing astronauts at Edwards Air Force 
Base, to flying 127 missions as com-
mander of a fighter wing in Vietnam, 
to testing a Russian MiG–15 obtained 
from a defector, Chuck Yeager’s serv-
ice to country and advancement of 
aviation never stopped throughout his 
lifetime. 
These accomplishments might have 
seemed unlikely in the beginning. Pos-
sessing only a high school degree and 
becoming sick riding in his first mili-
tary flight as a passenger, he might 
have seemed an unlikely milestone 
maker in military aviation. But, as he 
said in his memoir: ‘‘All I know is I 
worked my tail off learning to learn 
how to fly, and worked hard at it all 
the way.’’ 
As a fighter pilot myself, this is dif-
ficult for me to say, but Chuck Yeager 
was truly the best fighter pilot this 
world has seen. Hard work, determina-
tion, bravery, and service made Chuck 
Yeager a role model and a uniquely 
American hero. 
May God bless Chuck Yaeger, his 
family, and the Nation that he served, 
and I hope Chuck is up there in Heaven 
setting more records.

HONORING ROB STRAIN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Colorado (Mr. PERLMUTTER) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise for a couple of purposes today. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor 
the career of Rob Strain, a friend and 
constituent who is retiring as president 
of Ball Aerospace, headquartered in 
Colorado. 
Rob first joined Ball Aerospace in 
2012, 
after 
serving 
as 
director 
of 
NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. 
At Goddard, Rob’s strong oversight and 
leadership skills contributed to the 
success of more than 13 missions, as he 
was able to blend technical and pro-
grammatic solutions while under in-
tense congressional and agency scru-
tiny. 
Rob has a hands-on managerial style 
and a collaborative nature, which 
makes him a critical contributor on 
mission teams and not just the person 
in charge. 
Rob helped devise and execute a 
smooth transition from the flawed tri- 
agency NPOESS program for the Na-
tion’s next-generation polar weather 
satellites to the NASA/NOAA Joint 
Polar Satellite System, JPSS, based at 
Goddard to ensure the continuity of 
these critical weather satellite obser-
vations. 
The 
significance 
of 
his 
thoughtful, effective leadership during 
the program’s transition cannot be 
overstated. 
Rob also served a key role for the 
final space shuttle servicing mission to 
the Hubble Space Telescope. The mis-
sion 
encountered 
a 
major 
pro-
grammatic challenge from a prelaunch 
computer failure 1 month before the 
scheduled launch. In this ‘‘failure is 
not an option’’ moment, Rob brought 
together the government and industry 
expertise to fix the problem, ensured 
the team stayed on track, and mini-
mized scheduled impacts. The result 
was a successful servicing mission, ex-
tending Hubble’s incredible contribu-
tions to our scientific community as 
we approach 31 years in service. 
Prior to joining NASA, Rob led the 
Space Department of the Johns Hop-
kins 
Applied 
Physics 
Laboratory, 
where he was integral to the successful 
development, launch, and operations of 
the New Horizons spacecraft to Pluto. 
New 
Horizons 
overcame 
numerous 
technical and instrument availability 
issues to meet an extremely tight plan-
etary launch window and successfully 
flew by Pluto in 2015. 
Through his career at Ball Aero-
space, Rob has been a strong champion 
for diversity and inclusion across his 
teams and empowering all members of 
the team to be themselves and con-
tribute to the success of the business 
and the mission. Despite the success 
Rob has achieved in his career, he re-
mains an incredibly approachable and 
humble person. Rob remains accessible 
to individuals at all career levels, ac-
tively seeking their input and making 
them feel valued. 
Rob, I will miss your dry sense of 
humor, which often brought levity to 
serious meetings and tense situations. 
Thank you for your friendship and your 
work on behalf of the aerospace com-
munity, Colorado, and the Nation. I 
wish you the best in your retirement.

ELECTION RESULTS WERE FAIR 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, the 
second purpose I rise today is to re-
spond to one of my friends who is ques-
tioning the validity of the election. He 
couldn’t be more wrong. The gen-
tleman from Alabama and I work on 
legislation together. We cosponsored a 
bill that was just signed. But with re-
spect to his allegations and the allega-
tions of attorneys that there has been 
major fraud in this election, I can tell 
you that they couldn’t be more wrong. 
There is not a shred of evidence. 
I would say to my friend, under the 
Constitution—under Article I, Section 
1.4—the States are in charge of their 
elections. And under the section con-
cerning the Presidency, Article II, Sec-
tion 4, we choose when we hear from 
the electors of the electoral college— 
which will be January 6. But citing a 
New York Post article of an unnamed 
Democrat, who supposedly is an expert 
in elections, certainly is not evidence. 
In the cases across the country, there 
has been no evidence, and case after 
case has been thrown out, as they de-
serve to be thrown out. In fact, the Su-
preme Court just threw out a case yes-
terday 
concerning 
claims 
against 
Pennsylvania and its election process. 
Mr. Speaker, I don’t understand how 
these attorneys can bring these cases 
without facing sanctions by the var-
ious courts for bringing frivolous, vexa-
tious, and abusive litigation. This elec-
tion was fair. There have been many 
instances where they are trying to find 
some level of fraud. No fraud has been 
found. Joe Biden is the President-elect, 
and we will make him President on 
January 20, when the inauguration oc-
curs.

HONORING RETIRED COLONEL 
GARY CLARK 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. SPANO) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. SPANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise

resident and local hero: Retired U.S. 
Air Force Colonel Gary Clark. 
Mr. Speaker, for 26 years, Gary wore

way of life. From Vietnam to the So-
viet invasion of Afghanistan to Desert 
Storm, Gary’s leadership as a com-
mander and director played a key role 
in our force readiness policies. 
Despite this distinguished career, 
Gary was just getting started. He 
served on the National Board of Direc-
tors of the Military Officers Associa-
tion, as vice chair of the Florida Vet-
erans Foundation, as chair of the Polk 
County Veterans Council, as chairman 
of the Flight to Honor Polk, and serves 
on the James A. Haley VA Hospital Ad-
visory Board, among others. 
On a personal level, he has also aided 
my office and those of my two prede-
cessors with the military service acad-
emies nomination process—his deep in-
sight and knowledge have helped nu-
merous students throughout the years 
who also proudly served our country. 
And just this past September, Gary 
joined the 8th class to enter the Flor-
ida Veterans’ Hall of Fame. 
Mr. Speaker, it is Americans like 
Gary who have sacrificed their time, 
their talents, and their treasures for 
both this Nation and their neighbors. 
When I see an American flag, I think of 
Gary, and I am so proud to call him my 
friend. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Gary for his 
service; and to many more years ahead, 
I salute him. 
REMEMBERING BISHOP MATTHEW WILLIAMS 
Mr. SPANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
mourn the passing of Bishop Matthew 
Williams, a longtime community and 
faith leader from our district, and a 
personal inspiration to me. 
Bishop Williams was born in March 
of 1956, in Lakeland, Florida, the son of 
the late elder Matthew Williams, Sr., 
and the late Mother Louise Williams. 
He graduated from my alma mater, 
Brandon High School, in 1974, and at-
tended Hillsborough Community Col-
lege. Yet, at the age of 17, and during a 
period of national unrest, he accepted 
Christ as his personal Savior and, in 
1982, became a full-time minister at 
Brown Memorial Church of God in 
Christ, forever impacting countless 
lives in our community. 
Not only was Bishop Williams always 
available to help anyone in need, he al-
ways was a source of strength and guid-
ance to his peers. Given his dedication 
to his neighbors and faith, it is no sur-
prise that he was elected to the Church 
of God in Christ’s General Board, the 
highest executive and administrative 
board within his denomination. 
Mr. Speaker, our community and my 
family extend our deepest sympathies 
to the Williams’ family, especially to 
his wife, Gayle, and his daughter, 
Deniece. Though, he will be missed, we 
know that he still lives in the presence 
of Almighty God and awaits our next 
meeting.

WAR ON COVID–19 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Illinois (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I 
am Congresswoman JAN SCHAKOWSKY. I 
represent the Ninth Congressional Dis-
trict of Illinois, and I am here on this 
auspicious day to stand up for the peo-
ple of the Ninth Congressional District 
who are suffering right now under this 
pandemic. 
Mr. Speaker, we know that already 
we have seen the deaths of 286,000 peo-
ple, rivaling the total number of people 
who have died in World War II. We are 
at war with this virus. Fifteen-plus 
million Americans have contracted 
this virus. But it is not only the suf-
fering of people and the families of peo-
ple who have died and the people who 
have this terrible disease, but it is also 
an issue for the rest of Americans who 
are suffering right now. 
Mr. Speaker, like every other Mem-
ber of Congress, I am sure that you are 
getting the calls that I am getting; 
people—adults—who are weeping into 
the telephone and telling us about 
their fears, the suffering that their 
families are facing, the loss of jobs. 
A man called crying, saying, ‘‘I can’t 
pay my rent. I have lost my job. I am 
so afraid that, along with my family, 
we are going to be out on the street.’’ 
A woman called somewhat embar-
rassed to tell us that she cannot put 
food on the table for her children. We 
directed her to a food bank. Think of 
that; in the richest country in the 
world, that she had to rely on a food 
bank to be able to feed her family. 
Mr. Speaker, in this country today, 1 
out of 4 of our children is considered— 
what we say—food insecure. 
What does that mean? 
It means that they don’t know where 
their next meal is going to come from. 
This is shameful. 
People who are facing—the day after 
Christmas—losing their unemployment 
benefits. In Illinois, that is half a mil-
lion people. Around the country, that 
is 16.4 million people who may be with-
out any source of sustenance. 
Mr. Speaker, this is America. We 
need to save our people. So we need to 
come to an agreement, and we need to 
come to it soon because people are des-
perate right now. 
Mr. Speaker, the things that we need 
to do: 
Number one, I believe that we need 
to send a check to every family. They 
need money in their pockets. 
And where is that money going to go? 
It is going to go right out into the 
community, helping all the small busi-
nesses that we are so concerned about. 
That $1,200 check that people got ear-
lier in the year was a lifesaver, and we 
should do something similar right now. 
Mr. Speaker, we need to extend those 
unemployment insurance benefits. Our 
economy actually was somewhat thriv-
ing when they were getting $600 a week 
to keep their families going. I am not 
necessarily asking for that amount of 
money, but we should continue the un-
employment insurance benefits. Again, 
that money goes right out into the 
economy. 
And then we have to end the idea of 
some sort of a liability shield. In many 
ways, it is really a get-out-of-jail-free 
card for companies that don’t have to 
take care of their employees when they 
get sick. 
Mr. Speaker, 48 million workers put 
their own lives in danger every day and 
suit up and go out into the world tak-
ing care of our elderly, working in hos-
pitals, working in grocery stores, load-
ing our shelves, and taking our money 
when we leave. These people deserve 
help, and the employer should not be 
freed from any kind of liability. 
Mr. Speaker, we need the State and 
local money, and we need help for 
small businesses. We can do that. We 
must do that. 
f 
CONGRATULATING DAVID SHOAR 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. RUTHERFORD) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to congratulate David Shoar 
on a well-deserved retirement from a 
40-year, lifelong career from law en-
forcement. David has been with the St. 
Johns County Sheriff’s Office since 
being elected sheriff there in 2004, 2008, 
2012, and 2016. That is 16 long years of 
faithful service to the St. Johns Coun-
ty Sheriff’s Office. 
He has been an outstanding leader for 
the St. Johns County Sheriff’s Office 
and initiated many innovations during 
his tenure. Sheriff Shoar actually 
began his law enforcement career with 
the St. Augustine Police Department 
in 1981, serving as a patrol officer be-
fore being promoted to sergeant in 1991. 
Because of his leadership, knowledge, 
skills, and abilities, in 2000, he was ap-
pointed as chief of police, following 
successful stints as operations com-
mander and administrative services 
commander. Just 4 years later, in 2004, 
he would then begin his career as sher-
iff of St. Johns County. 
Mr. Speaker, that is when I really 
came to know Sheriff Shoar, during the 
Florida 
Sheriffs 
Association’s 
new 
sheriffs school. Although we both at-
tended an earlier training class in 
Wakulla Springs and really had gotten 
to be close friends, it was at this new 
sheriff’s training that I truly began to 
appreciate Sheriff Shoar’s intelligence 
and his insights. 
Sheriff Shoar is also a decorated sol-
dier in the Florida National Guard, 
later retiring as a major after 24 years 
of service to our Nation and our State. 
He served in the Gulf War and led 
North Florida’s recovery efforts fol-
lowing Hurricanes Andrew and Opal. 
His public service record and leader-
ship in northeast Florida is truly sec-
ond to none. 
Mr. Speaker, all of Sheriff Shoar’s 
awards and accolades are too numerous 
to list, but they do include the Amer-
ica’s Most Wanted National First Re-
sponder Award, the American Legion’s 
Top Cop Award, the Catholic Charities

of St. Johns County Good Samaritan 
Award, the Salvation Army’s Gus Craig 
Award, and the prestigious Colonel Ed 
Taylor Award from the St. Johns Coun-
ty Veteran’s Council for his many 
years of dedication to our Nation’s vet-
erans. 
b 1045 
In addition to his many successes in 
law enforcement, military service, and 
community service, Sheriff Shoar also 
holds bachelor’s and master’s degrees 
from the University of North Florida 
and an honorary doctorate of law de-
gree from Flagler College. 
During his 40 years of service, Sheriff 
Shoar made a positive difference in his 
community, his country, his agency, 
and the lives of many people, including 
my own. 
His life reminds me of a quote by 
Ralph Waldo Emerson: 
The purpose of life is not to be happy. It is 
to be useful, to be honorable, to be compas-
sionate, to have it make some difference 
that you lived and lived well. 
Sheriff Shoar, David, my friend, you 
have made a difference and lived well. 
On behalf of the Fourth Congres-
sional District of Florida, I wish David 
well in his retirement and thank him 
for dedicating his life to the safety of 
our community and our Nation. 
f 
MASKS SAVE LIVES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Connecticut (Mr. HIMES) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. HIMES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to ask a simple question: When did we 
stop looking out for each other? 
We used to be a country that re-
served its highest and best celebration 
for those who sacrificed for us. That is 
why we honor Nathan Hale of Con-
necticut and Rosie the Riveter and the 
crew and passengers of Flight 93. It is 
why we celebrate Martin Luther King, 
Jr. Day, to honor a man that gave his 
life to make us a better people, to 
make us a better Nation. They sac-
rificed and did the hard things so that 
we could have the blessings of freedom 
and prosperity. 
Two days ago, Mr. Speaker, we re-
membered the start of World War II. 
400,000 Americans died in that war, 
290,000 in combat. Tom and Alleta Sul-
livan of Waterloo, Iowa, gave their sons 
in that war, all five of them. George 
Sullivan, Frank Sullivan, Joseph Sul-
livan, Madison Sullivan, and Albert 
Leo Sullivan, all five sons killed in the 
South Pacific in 1942, all five of them 
given for us. 
Every single day, nurses, ER doctors, 
janitors, and delivery people take huge 
risks for us. For 21⁄2 centuries, Ameri-
cans have done what was asked of them 
and more. We serve on juries. We pay 
our taxes. We have been drafted into 
the military. 
Why? We do these things not because 
we necessarily want to do them, but 
because we recognize that we have in-
herited freedoms, liberty, and pros-
perity from others who secured them 
for us. We understand that freedom and 
prosperity aren’t gifts to be taken for 
granted, to be exalted above what we 
owe each other. They are blessings to 
be paid forward and to be fought for. 
So what about this? What about this 
mask? 
And what about this? ‘‘Mask off for 
freedom.’’ Really? 
This is a flimsy piece of cloth. It is 
uncomfortable. It is inconvenient. But 
it saves lives. It saves others. 
When did we stop looking out for 
each other? You are not being asked to 
turn over your children, your five boys. 
You are not being asked to ration 
sugar or to have meatless Mondays. 
You are not even being asked to serve 
a week on a jury. You are being asked 
to wear a piece of cloth on your face to 
protect others. 
Mr. Speaker, I have nothing to offer 
those who believe that COVID is a hoax 
or that masks don’t save lives. All I 
can do is pray for them when they 
meet the souls of those for whom they 
would not make the smallest of sac-
rifices. 
What I can do is remind us what 
makes us great as a people. It is not 
our wealth or our power. It is what we 
are willing to do for each other. What 
makes us great is what we are willing 
to offer up to each other, the small 
things that we owe each other and the 
inconceivable sacrifice upon which all 
of this is built. 
At our best, what are we capable of 
doing for each other? Ask Tom and 
Alleta Sullivan.

HONORING THE MEMORY OF MRS. 
SUSAN DAY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. CLOUD) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the memory of Mrs. 
Susan Day, a beloved teacher in the 
Corpus Christi community who passed 
away on October 5, 2020. 
Mrs. Day was a passionate and dedi-
cated educator at Calallen High School 
who retired this past May after 36 
years of service to our community. 
Students and parents alike described 
her as devoted, energetic, and inspir-
ing. She would challenge her students 
with quality education while encour-
aging them with her enthusiasm and 
charm. 
The students of Calallen High School 
tell stories of the many experiences she 
gave them, including coaching the 
Calallen Challenge Team to three wins 
in the local TV quiz show. 
The English department chose to rec-
ognize her with a plaque declaring the 
English hallway, a place she had spent 
so much time with her students, to be 
the Susan Day Hallway. 
Susan Day was an amazing member 
of our community who has touched the 
lives of hundreds of students, parents, 
and teachers. 
I offer my condolences to her family, 
friends, and students as they grieve the 
loss of a great woman. She will be fond-
ly remembered by all for the invest-
ment and impact she has made in the 
lives of so many students. 
f 
TIME IS RUNNING OUT FOR 
INDEPENDENT RESTAURANTS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Oregon (Mr. BLUMENAUER) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, 
time is running out for America’s 
500,000 independent restaurants and 
their 11 million employees. This is the 
hardest-hit sector of our economy. 
We began our morning hour today 
listening to our friend, the gentleman 
from California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK), and 
it is the lead editorial in the New York 
Times, focusing on the crisis for these 
restaurants. 
Independent restaurants are holding 
on literally by their fingertips. They 
are facing a new wave of restrictions 
that are necessary to deal with the 
COVID crisis that is rising. 
The talk of expanding the Paycheck 
Protection Program, the PPP, abso-
lutely misses the mark. It didn’t work 
initially when it was introduced for the 
restaurants, and it won’t work now. 
They can’t afford to wait for warmer 
weather in the spring or a vaccine in 
the summer. They don’t need more 
debt. They need a lifeline now. Other-
wise, we could see the loss of up to 80 
percent of our independent restaurants 
that form the very fabric of our neigh-
borhoods. 
Luckily, there is a solution. My RES-
TAURANTS Act has already passed the 
House. It is a program that won’t add 
to the deficit. In fact, it will actually 
provide more money to the Govern-
ment. The cost is $120 billion, but the 
economic analysis suggests that it will 
save $248 billion. 
Think about it for a moment. That is 
logical because, instead of adding mas-
sive unemployment costs, having res-
taurants defaulting on their mort-
gages, being evicted because they are 
unable to pay rent, and the ripple ef-
fect throughout the vast supply chain 
for 
independent 
restaurants, 
from 
farmers, ranchers, and people who sup-
ply linen, for a few months of support 
from the RESTAURANTS Act, it will 
enable them to have limited operation, 
be paying rent, or keeping current with 
their mortgages, until later in next 
year when they can return to normal 
operations. It is imperative that we 
deal directly with putting money in 
their hands. 
Last week, former Vice President 
Biden, President-Elect Biden, said res-
taurants need grants, not loans. Sec-
retary of the Treasury Mnuchin said 
restaurants need grants; they don’t 
need loans. 
We have a solution that is available. 
The RESTAURANTS Act, as I said, has 
already passed the House of Represent-
atives. Over half the Senate has co-
sponsored this legislation.

As we have heard from President- 
Elect Biden, it should not be a loan; it 
should 
be 
a 
guarantee.

Mnuchin said restaurants need grants; 
they don’t need loans. The House

ing PPP, more cumbersome loans. Send 
them that lifeline. Keep independent 
restaurants in business. Protect their

DEESE, ESG, AND STAKEHOLDER 
CAPITALISM 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Kentucky (Mr. BARR) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to once again sound the alarm about an 
increasing danger to retail investors 
and retirement savers across the coun-
try. 
We have seen in recent years a trend 
of asset managers, banks, and other fi-
nancial institutions prioritizing polit-
ical and social causes over investment 
returns, potentially compromising the 
long-term financial security of their 
customers. 
We have seen companies cede the pri-
macy 
of 
shareholders 
to 
so-called 
stakeholders, endangering the long-
standing corporate governance prin-
ciple of directors’ and officers’ fidu-
ciary duty. 
Corporate leaders continue to accede 
to the calls from the extreme left to 
shun certain industries, deprioritize fi-
nancial growth, and comply with a rad-
ical corporate governance reform agen-
da out of fear of being publicly shamed. 
I fear that, if left unchecked, this 
trend will accelerate in the coming 
years, as government continues to 
pressure financial institutions to be 
agents of social change at the expense 
of savers, customers, and shareholders. 
Without a strong defense of free and 
fair market principles, we risk wit-
nessing a decline in American eco-
nomic exceptionalism that will have 
long-term material impacts on our 
constituents. 
Earlier this month, former Vice 
President Biden announced that he 
would appoint Brian Deese as the 
chairman of the National Economic 
Council. Mr. Deese will join the admin-
istration from his current post as the 
head 
of 
sustainable 
investing 
at 
BlackRock. In that capacity, he serves 
as a leading proponent of BlackRock’s 
environmental, social, and governance, 
or ESG, investing strategy. 
BlackRock has been perhaps the 
most vocal asset manager on restrict-
ing access to capital for legally oper-
ating fossil energy businesses and lim-
iting choices for their investors based 
on misguided public relations goals. 
This, in part, is attributable to the ef-
forts of Mr. Deese, who has orches-
trated the curious investment strategy 
of actively alienating an entire sector 
of the American economy, the U.S. en-
ergy sector, and the millions of jobs it 
supports, while at the same time en-
thusiastically providing access to cap-
ital 
to 
Chinese 
businesses 
which 
threaten 
American 
competitiveness 
and national security. 
The appointment of Mr. Deese is a 
harbinger of things to come. It show-
cases that, unless we act, we will be on 
the path to socialism, where the pri-
mary goal of a corporation is not long- 
term growth or hiring more people or 
providing products and services to the 
American people, but instead to satisfy 
the most vocal detractors of corporate 
America. 
So-called stakeholder capitalism, or 
the left’s ideals for it, takes for grant-
ed the laws of supply and demand and 
discounts the market forces that gov-
ern businesses’ success or failure. 
Shareholder primacy is not about 
elevating the select few. It is about es-
tablishing metric-based accountability 
for corporate leaders to ensure that 
they are operating efficiently and ef-
fectively. That efficacy and produc-
tivity then, in turn, benefits employ-
ees, communities, and suppliers. 
In today’s market, a company cannot 
be successful without a focus on these 
other constituencies. But it must, first 
and foremost, make a profit to be via-
ble. 
Caring about broader social concerns, 
treating employees, suppliers, and cus-
tomers well and ethically, and engag-
ing in philanthropy within the commu-
nity may all engender social support 
for a corporation, and in that sense, it 
may advance long-term shareholder 
value maximization. But that is not 
the paradigm those on the far left are 
urging the business community to 
adopt. Instead, they want a new para-
digm, a paradigm that subordinates the 
interests of shareholders to the whims 
of stakeholders who have no ownership 
interest in the corporation whatsoever. 
b 1100 
Replacing the focus on shareholder 
value with a focus on stakeholder in-
terests unrelated to the core business 
of the corporation would not only au-
thorize officers and directors to breach 
their fiduciary duties to the owners of 
the corporation, it would, in the long- 
term, 
undermine 
the 
corporation’s 
ability to advance the interests of em-
ployees, 
suppliers, 
customers, 
and 
other stakeholders. 
The socialists think that shareholder 
value maximization is always incon-
sistent with other stakeholder inter-
ests. The opposite is often true. 
I believe we are only scratching the 
surface of how the radical left hopes to 
remake corporate America in its so-
cialist image. We must act diligently 
to preserve the spirit of free enterprise, 
promote healthy economic growth, and 
protect the long-term interests of in-
vestors. 
With Brian Deese departing from 
BlackRock, perhaps that firm can re-
evaluate its obligation to the investors 
who entrust their assets to them to 
prioritize returns over political er-
rands, to focus on maximizing share-
holder value, instead of groveling be-
fore radical environmentalists, social-
ists, and the extreme far left.

EXPRESSING 
DEEP 
GRATITUDE 
FOR PRIVILEGE OF SERVING IN 
CONGRESS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. COX) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. COX of California. Mr. Speaker, 
on behalf of the individuals, families, 
and communities of California’s 21st 
District, I want to express my deepest 
gratitude for the privilege of being 
here today. 
I am the son of immigrants who, I am 
sure, never imagined that their son 
would become a Member of Congress. 
Like my late father, I first started in 
chemical engineering, but my career 
diverged when my wife, Kathy, and I 
moved to the Central Valley some 20 
years ago in order for her to start and 
pursue her medical career, taking care 
of some of the most critically ill chil-
dren in one of the most deserving re-
gions in America. 
Mr. Speaker, the best thing I can say 
about myself is I am married to her, 
Kathy Murphy. 
For me, I began volunteering with 
Habitat for Humanity, and from there, 
I can directly trace my path to where 
I stand before you today as a Member 
of Congress, as a public servant. It is 
has been an honor and a privilege to 
serve. 
There is nothing more rewarding in 
life than serving others. As the late 
Martin Luther King, Jr. said and pro-
fessed: ‘‘Life’s most persistent and ur-
gent question is: ‘What are you doing 
for others?’’’ 
One of my favorite family stories was 
about my grandmother, my lola, in the 
Philippines, right after World War II, 
in Manila. She saw that there was a 
segment of our troops who were being 
discriminated 
against. 
They 
didn’t 
have anyplace to go when they got off 
duty, no place to hang out and have a 
drink or a meal or just hang out with 
their buddies. So my grandmother, she 
took it upon herself to open the first 
and only social club for African-Amer-
ican troops there in Manila. 
Now, my grandmother didn’t know or 
even ever speak to or meet our friend 
the late John Lewis, but they were cut 
from the same cloth. They lived by the 
belief that, if you see something that is 
not right, not fair, not just, you have 
to speak up; you have to say some-
thing; you have to do something. My 
grandmother did something. 
That sense of social justice was 
passed 
along 
to 
my 
mom, 
Perla 
deCastro, my children’s lola, who be-
came one of the State of Nevada’s first 
equal opportunity officers. 
I am so proud of my children, Molly, 
Joe, Thomas, and Jack, who are con-
sidering serving others in the Peace 
Corps, the Foreign Service, and the 
Armed Forces.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7056 
December 9, 2020 
For 2 years, I have been so grateful 
and so proud of my staff here in Wash-
ington, D.C., and back home in Cali-
fornia. They made a positive difference 
in the lives of all the people of the 21st 
District. From the 27 bills we passed, 
to the $700 million of water infrastruc-
ture that we got passed through the 
House, to the over $3.5 million that we 
got returned back to over 300 constitu-
ents, they were known to be produc-
tive, effective, and capable. 
Thank you to my team. You are a 
shining example of the adage, to be 
successful, surround yourself by people 
who are smarter than you. 
I want to thank all the House staff 
for making this place work, the Capitol 
Police for keeping us safe, the ladies in 
the cloakroom who kept us fed, the 
staff at the gym who kept us in shape; 
and to our leaders—STENY, NANCY, JIM, 
and HAKEEM—our Caucus is in good 
hands. 
Thank you to all the interns who 
served in both my D.C. and district of-
fices. I am proud that you are consid-
ering a life and a career in public serv-
ice. 
I am invigorated by the young men 
and women who want to make a posi-
tive difference. They are making it 
happen, being the change they want to 
see in their own communities. 
My proudest moment as a Member of 
Congress was that day that we passed 
H.R. 6, the Dream and Promise Act. A 
young woman from the Central Valley 
who came out to witness the passage of 
that act said to me afterwards: Thank 
you, Congressman COX. You finally 
make me feel as if somebody cares. 
Beyond the legislation we worked on, 
my measure of success was to provide 
an example that, if you care, advocate 
and work on the issues that matter to 
you, your voice will be heard here in 
Washington. I do care, and I look for-
ward to continuing to fight to make a 
positive difference in the lives of all 
Central Valley residents. 
And we have to fight, Mr. Speaker. 
Democracies aren’t taken away; they 
are given away. I am proud of the role 
I have played to save our democracy: 
first, in 2018, by taking back control of 
the House, and this year, in helping 
win the White House. It brings a smile 
to my face to be able to say President- 
elect Biden and Vice President-elect 
HARRIS. 
But there is a lot more work to do to 
ensure our democracy. Let’s all recall 
our pledge to uphold and defend the 
Constitution of the United States from 
all enemies, foreign and domestic. 
Let us recall that the Framers of the 
Constitution established Congress first. 
We are Article I, supreme amongst the 
three branches of the government. The 
power of the people resides in the Con-
gress, not the White House. 
As this will be my final speech for 
the 116th Congress, I want to say, un-
equivocally, I am proud to be a Demo-
crat. 
Now, sometimes our party is not 
great at messaging. We try to make 
every voice heard, and sometimes we 
pay a price for that at the ballot box. 
But here are a few truths that I am 
happy to sing from the rooftops: 
The Democratic Party has always 
been the party of working people and 
their families. 
The fact is, there is only one party 
that has consistently fought to win 
healthcare for your family. 
There is only party that will suffer 
the political consequences of telling 
America the truth about COVID. 
We are the party of purpose. I was 
proud to run and serve under our ban-
ner. 
I look forward to the Biden-Harris 
Democratic 
House 
and 
Democratic 
Senate. We will get back to work fight-
ing for the people. 
f 
CONDEMNING ACTIONS OF THE 
SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. CRENSHAW) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CRENSHAW. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to unequivocally condemn, in 
the strongest possible terms, the ac-
tions of the Speaker of the House, 
NANCY PELOSI. 
Just last week, referring to her ob-
struction of bipartisan targeted relief 
bills that we could have voted on on 
this floor, she said: ‘‘Don’t characterize 
what we did before as a mistake. . . . 
That was not a mistake; it was a deci-
sion.’’ When asked what had changed, 
why she is finally coming to the table 
on COVID relief, her response was sim-
ple: A new President. 
We have known for months that 
Speaker PELOSI was holding the Amer-
ican people hostage for political gain. I 
have said it; my colleagues have said 
it. 
While Americans suffered under un-
scientific, foolish lockdowns, PELOSI 
withheld relief for political purposes— 
not policy purposes, but political pur-
poses. 
But we now have a full admission. 
She said the quiet part out loud. 
This was never about what was best 
for the American people, never about 
honest policy disagreement. It was 
about 
preventing 
President 
Trump 
from getting any credit. It was about 
politics. 
Speaker PELOSI made a simple cal-
culation. She bet that, if she could 
keep Congress from reaching a deal on 
COVID relief, that would hurt Presi-
dent Trump and Republicans and give 
her more power. 
Even when Members of her own party 
asked 
her 
to 
bring 
commonsense, 
standalone bipartisan relief measures 
to the House floor that would easily be-
come law, she refused. She would say 
over and over again that nothing is 
better than something. 
She was being honest. She honestly 
believed that nothing was better than 
something. 
But better for who? Not for the 
American people, that is for sure. 
She believed that nothing was better 
than something for her and her party. 
It is hard to imagine a more awful and 
heartless strategy. 
What is worse, Speaker PELOSI does 
all of this while people in her home 
State suffer from unscientific, uncon-
stitutional lockdowns that Democrat 
leaders in California are forcing upon 
their citizens. 
These lockdowns are not based in 
science, never have been. Study after 
study shows they yield little, if any, 
benefits, but they impose extreme 
costs on the small businesses suffering 
under them. 
Do you know what else? The Demo-
crat leaders making these executive or-
ders, they know this, too, because they 
are violating their own guidelines. The 
Speaker of the House couldn’t even let 
a pesky little lockdown get in the way 
of a haircut appointment, even though 
those same lockdowns destroy the lives 
of her constituents. 
We have all seen the heartbreaking 
video of Angela Marsden, the owner of 
the Pineapple Hill Saloon and Grill in 
Los Angeles. Everyone should have to 
watch that testimony, as Democrats 
shut down her outdoor—outdoor—din-
ing while a Hollywood studio sets up 
shop right next door. 
She represents millions of Americans 
suffering who have taken note of the 
hypocrisy of these lockdowns, of the 
double standards as big businesses can 
operate freely while small businesses 
are shamed into submission and told, 
wrongly, that they are the ones who 
must sacrifice to slow the spread, that 
the demise of the business they spent 
their whole lives building is the price 
to pay because ‘‘if it just saves one 
life.’’ 
But this is unscientific nonsense and 
we all know it. Study after study shows 
outdoor dining is safe, that outbreaks 
are not occurring because of our small 
businesses: our gyms, our restaurants, 
our salons. And yet these small busi-
nesses are in the crosshairs of the cow-
ardly politicians across the country. 
This madness has to stop. This arbi-
trary application of executive orders is 
deeply, deeply unconstitutional. 
Justice 
Gorsuch 
recently 
stated: 
‘‘There is no world in which the Con-
stitution tolerates color-coded execu-
tive edicts that reopen liquor stores 
and bike shops, but shutter churches, 
synagogues, and mosques.’’ 
Americans have had enough. It is 
time to stand up against the hypocrisy 
of these so-called leaders deliberately 
harming the citizens they claim to rep-
resent and to condemn the deeply par-
tisan actions of the Speaker of this 
House.

COMPARING WEALTH IN BLACK 
HOMES AND BUSINESSES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. HALL) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. HALL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to speak about a couple of items of im-
portance. I rise today to speak about 
wealth in Black homes and businesses.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7057 
December 9, 2020 
According to the Brookings Institu-
tion, the net worth of a typical White 
family is nearly 10 times that of a 
Black family. 
According to the Atlanta Wealth 
Building Initiative, the numbers in my 
home city of Atlanta and the other 
eight cities in the district, College 
Park, East Point, Decatur, Hapeville, 
Lake City, Forest Park, Morrow, and 
Brookhaven, are slightly better, but no 
less concerning. 
The median household income of a 
White family is $83,722, compared to 
$28,105 for a Black family. 
Sixty-nine percent of the Black fami-
lies are liquid asset poor, compared to 
22 percent of White families. 
The average African-American-owned 
business is valued at $58,085, while the 
average value of a White business is 
$658,264. 
There are many reasons for these dis-
parities, starting foremost with Amer-
ica’s original sin: slavery. And descend-
ants of African slaves in District Five 
expect restorative financial justice in 
the form of reparations. 
We also know that a reason the prob-
lem persists well into the 21st century 
is the availability of capital to Black- 
owned businesses and the success of 
Black banks. The higher the circula-
tion of dollars in the community, the 
greater the economic stability and op-
portunities for economic growth. 
According to the University of Geor-
gia’s 
Selig 
Center 
for 
Economic 
Growth, money circulates one time 
within the African-American commu-
nity, compared to more than six times 
in the Latinx community, nine times 
in the Asian community, and an unlim-
ited amount of times within the White 
community. 
A Black Star Project study on the ra-
cial wealth gap calculates that a dollar 
circulates 6 hours in the Black commu-
nity, 20 days in the Jewish community, 
and 30 days in the Asian community. 
Black people have an estimated $1.3 
trillion gross national income, but only 
2 percent is recirculated in the Black 
community. 
Keeping Black dollars in the Black 
community is harder than it sounds. In 
her TEDx Talk about the impact of 
Black dollars being spent outside of the 
Black community, author and activist 
Maggie Anderson shares a story about 
an empowerment experiment during 
which her family attempted to pur-
chase 
Black-made 
products 
from 
Black-owned businesses for 1 year. 
Anderson uncovered a discouraging 
picture of a vast economic divide. She 
discusses how L’Oreal owns one of the 
largest Black beauty brands in the 
world, 
SoftSheen-Carson, 
dem-
onstrating 
a 
White-owned 
business 
profiting from a market of exclusively 
Black buyers. 
b 1115 
She estimates that up to 80 percent 
of the revenue of White-owned Hen-
nessy cognac comes from Black con-
sumers, but the company has no Black 
distributors or suppliers and does not 
advertise in Black-owned media. 
The Empowerment Experiment re-
sulted in a landmark study conducted 
by Steven Rogers at the Northwestern 
University Kellogg School of Manage-
ment, which proved how supporting 
Black-owned businesses can benefit the 
Black community, as well as the Amer-
ican economy as a whole. 
In Anderson’s book, ‘‘Our Black Year: 
One Family’s Quest to Buy Black in 
America’s Racially Divided Economy,’’ 
she notes that if Black spending with 
Black businesses rose from the current 
3 percent to 10 percent it could create 
a million new jobs and provide eco-
nomic security to countless Black 
households. 
Lack of access to financial services is 
not just a symptom of America’s racial 
wealth gap; it is also a cause. Without 
the ability to efficiently save, invest, 
and ensure against risks, many Black 
families struggle to translate the in-
come they earn to genuine genera-
tional wealth. 
Based on data from the Federal Re-
serve’s Survey of Consumer Finance, 
the typical Black family has only 10 
cents for every dollar held by the typ-
ical White family. 
This wealth gap dates back to the 
decades after emancipation and has re-
mained stubbornly persistent. Red-
lining, a practice that designates Black 
communities as unfavorable for home 
loans and business investment, reduces 
property values and increases interest 
rates in many neighborhoods, trends 
that have impacted African Americans 
for a century. 
Largely excluded from the generous 
financial incentives of the New Deal, 
the Black community was boxed out of 
the country’s post World War II boom 
that vastly expanded the American 
middle class. 
Despite laws prohibiting loan dis-
crimination on the basis of race, the 
Congressional Black Caucus still calls 
on regulatory agencies to improve en-
forcement at a national level. Black 
and Latinx home buyers are signifi-
cantly more likely than Whites to be 
turned down for a conventional mort-
gage loan. 
A recent analysis from Zillow shows 
that in 2016, nearly 21 percent of Black 
applicants were denied a conventional 
loan, while 15.5 of Latinx were. And in 
2016, Asian applicants were denied a 
conventional loan in 10.4 percent of 
cases—slightly more than the national 
average—and Whites in only 8.1 percent 
of cases. 
According to a New America report, 
many banks also hinder Black wealth 
creation with discriminatory practices 
in service offerings. 
In 
communities 
of 
color, 
banks 
charge more for opening and maintain-
ing basic, entry-level checking ac-
counts. 
The minimum opening deposit is 
higher in majority Black neighbor-
hoods, $80.60, and in neighborhoods 
without a racial majority, $97, than in 
White neighborhoods, $68.50. 
The solution is that there is a need 
to help support MDIs and CDFIs but 
not only with deposits. 
Mr. Speaker, this is an urgent issue. 
I urge my colleagues in this Chamber 
to consider the dictates of this state-
ment and act to help all Americans re-
alize their American Dream. 
f 
HONORING THE SERVICE OF KEVIN 
FITZPATRICK 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Ohio (Mr. CHABOT) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, it is with 
a mixture of some sadness, but mostly 
appreciation, that I come to the floor 
today to recognize the contributions of 
my staff director at the Small Business 
Committee, Kevin Fitzpatrick, who is 
retiring at the end of this Congress. 
Kevin and I have worked together for a 
quarter century now, and he is the last 
remaining member of my original staff 
when I was first sworn into Congress 
back in 1995. 
While I am happy for Kevin that he 
will soon have more time to spend with 
his lovely wife, Pam, and his wonderful 
children, Spike, Katie, and Elizabeth, 
he will be impossible to replace. Over 
the years, Kevin has played an integral 
role in nearly every legislative accom-
plishment we have achieved for Ohio’s 
First Congressional District and for 
the American people. 
Kevin Fitzpatrick is the kind of per-
son who can build an instant rapport 
with anyone, a skill that is extremely 
valuable in politics. Whether it is a 
family here from back home in Cin-
cinnati, a foreign dignitary, or even a 
political opponent, Kevin is always 
ready with a disarming story that puts 
others at ease. 
Although he has worked on the Hill 
for a long time, Kevin’s roots are back 
in Ohio. He grew up with his loving 
family in Shelby, Ohio, and graduated 
from Miami University back in the 
days when not only the Washington 
professional football team but also 
Miami were known as the Redskins. 
Kevin nearly became a candidate for 
office himself when he was asked to 
consider running against a then young 
Ohio 
State 
Representative 
named 
SHERROD BROWN. Had he not decided 
against it, Kevin might well be serving 
with me here in the House, rather than 
having this speech given in his honor 
today. 
I am actually the third Congressman 
Kevin has worked for. His first job in 
Washington was for legendary Ohio 
conservative 
Congressman 
John 
Ashbrook, 
who 
interestingly 
ran 
against Richard Nixon in the Repub-
lican Presidential primary in 1972. 
Later, Kevin worked for Congress-
man Duncan Hunter, Sr. on the Repub-
lican Research Committee, which was 
part of leadership at the time. 
When I ran and won my seat in Con-
gress in 1994 in the Republican revolu-
tion, I was a Washington outsider and 
so were most of my supporters. I des-
perately needed someone who knew not

only Ohio, but also had the experience 
and understood how to get things done 
here in Washington. And that made 
Kevin Fitzpatrick a natural fit as my 
legislative director. 
I have served on three committees 
during my 25 years here in Congress: 
Foreign Affairs, Judiciary, and Small 
Business. Kevin has had a profound im-
pact on my policy agenda on all three 
committees over the years. 
On Foreign Affairs, we have worked 
on more issues than I could possibly re-
late here, but some of our most signifi-
cant accomplishments have been in ad-
vancing the relationship between the 
United States and our democratic ally, 
Taiwan, in the face of the existential 
threat posed by communist China. 
Kevin was instrumental in helping me 
create the Congressional Taiwan Cau-
cus, along with former Congressmen 
Robert Wexler, Dana Rohrabacher, and 
then-Representative, 
now 
Senator 
SHERROD BROWN. 
Over the years, we have pushed many 
pro-democracy and pro-Taiwan initia-
tives, one of the most significant being 
the Taiwan Travel Act, which will now 
allow diplomatic visits between top 
U.S. and Taiwanese officials. 
Judiciary. Throughout his life, Kevin 
has been a warrior for the unborn. He 
has played a significant role in the pro-
motion of pro-life legislative initia-
tives. Those efforts ultimately led to 
the most significant Federal pro-life 
legislation enacted since the infamous 
Roe v. Wade decision, the Federal ban 
on partial birth abortion signed into 
law by President Bush back in 2003 and 
ultimately upheld to be constitutional 
by the U.S. Supreme Court. Kevin was 
front and center in those efforts, and I 
know he is as proud of that accom-
plishment as I am. 
In recent years, Kevin has led the 
Small Business Committee as my staff 
director. In that role, Kevin has put to-
gether what I believe to be the best 
committee staff on the Hill: Jan Oliver, 
Joe Hartz, Rob Yavor, Delia Barr, Alli-
son Kerman, Vivian Ling, and Rachel 
Emmons. 
Perhaps the greatest testament to 
Kevin’s leadership occurred earlier this 
year with the creation and implemen-
tation of the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram, or PPP. This critical program 
saved millions of small businesses 
across America that would otherwise 
have gone under during the COVID–19 
pandemic, and most importantly saved 
over 50 million jobs. 
Finally, during the course of Kevin 
Fitzpatrick’s career, he has hired, 
trained, and mentored so many people 
currently working both on and off the 
Hill. He has shared his knowledge, his 
experience, and his commitment to im-
proving our country with each and 
every one of them. 
It will now be their turn to teach new 
staff members how to make the peo-
ple’s House truly work for the people. 
They couldn’t have had a better 
teacher, a better mentor, or a better 
example than Kevin Fitzpatrick. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Kevin for his 
service, his dedication, and his friend-
ship. He will be missed.

THE NIGHTMARE IS ALMOST OVER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PAYNE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to declare that our 4-year public 
nightmare is almost at an end. 
Next month, Joe Biden will be sworn 
in as the 46th President after an hon-
est, free, and fair election, and an ugly 
chapter in America’s history will be 
over. 
No more governing by tweet. No 
more constant lies. No more insulting 
our Nation while praising our enemies. 
No more incompetent family members 
conducting national policy. No more 
gross profiteering off of the Presidency. 
No more children in cages. No more 
promoting of white supremacy. No 
more attacks on American institutions 
like the FBI, the courts, schools, and 
the post office and so many others. No 
more payoffs. No more conspiracy 
theories. No more recounting ballots. 
And a future with no more coronavirus, 
hopefully. 
For the last 4 years, we have been 
told to make America great. When Jo-
seph R. Biden is sworn in as President 
of the United States, we can say that 
we finally did. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the 
President. 
f 
ELECTION THOUGHTS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Wisconsin (Mr. GROTHMAN) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, we 
just wrapped up an election here, and 
we were told this election was about 
hatred and bias. I don’t really know 
any haters on my campaign, and I 
don’t think there is this huge amount 
of bias, in general, in this country that 
some people tried to make this election 
about. 
Recently, I did have a woman come 
up to me from my district talking 
about real bias and perhaps hatred in 
America. She talked about her children 
who went to college. Her and her hus-
band got married before they had chil-
dren, and both worked hard and made 
an average income. Both of her kids 
had about 30 or $40,000 in student loan 
debt, and she had good kids who were 
working hard to pay off that debt. 
But she felt that if her and her hus-
band had not gotten married, the gov-
ernment probably would have given 
them something they couldn’t get as 
married and working people. Her kids 
may have gotten $30,000 plus in Pell 
Grants, and they were probably eligible 
for other grants. At least in the State 
of Wisconsin you would receive similar 
State grants, as well as be eligible for 
a work study program. 
Unfortunately, her kids were not eli-
gible for that, and at least she feels 
they are being significantly discrimi-
nated against, and hatred is being dis-
played by the American Government. 
Here is real hatred and real bias. 
Is she right? Is there really U.S. Gov-
ernment hatred and bias against people 
who got married? 
How did this happen? I have talked 
about this issue before, and people 
imply that maybe it happened by mis-
take, not just the Pell Grant program, 
but other government assistance pro-
grams just inadvertently sprung up and 
punished people who got married. 
However, in this election I had a lit-
tle bit of an eye-opener. 
In this election we had Black Lives 
Matter get involved. If you read the 
website, which was eventually scrubbed 
or taken down in part about two 
months ago with a month left to go in 
the campaign, on its website it said, 
first of all, two of its three co-founders 
were trained Marxists, and secondly, it 
said one of their goals was to disrupt 
the western-prescribed nuclear family 
structure. 
First of all, I think they are a little 
bit historically inaccurate. I think 
there are all sorts of cultures in the 
world, other than just European cul-
tures, in which you have a wife and a 
husband and kids. But nevertheless, 
they clearly consider it a problem. And 
it doesn’t surprise me that this group 
would have this on their website that 
they consider it a problem, since they 
were founded by two Marxists. 
And when I think of Marxists, I think 
of three things: First of all, of course, 
I think of Socialism and the fact that 
government should own everything, 
and we shouldn’t have lots of different 
people own lots of different businesses 
or different rental units or what have 
you. They want everything controlled 
by the government. 
The other two things I always think 
of when I think of Marxism is: First of 
all, they hate God. And whether you 
are talking about countries in which 
Marxists take over, be it Red China, 
Vietnam, Russia, they follow Karl 
Marx in saying abolition of religion is 
demanded for the true happiness of 
people. So when I associate Marxism 
and people associating with such a 
group, I associate the hatred for God. 
But the other thing we have got to 
remember is Karl Marx himself was 
very antifamily, and that is why I as-
sume on the website it appeared that 
Black Lives Matter wants to disrupt 
the western-prescribed nuclear family. 
So here is a group that I am sure 
cheers programs which penalizes people 
who are married and discriminates in 
favor of people who aren’t married. 
And to my surprise, people did not run 
from this group. 
To me, every politician should say 
for some groups, I am not going to ask 
for your help. Years ago, when I was in 
the State legislature, I fought the drug 
companies who I think are over-drug-
ging our kids. I fought the drug compa-
nies who I think were prescribing too

many opiates, which were leading to 
deaths, and so, I don’t take money 
from the prescription drug companies. 
I don’t take money from the payday 
lenders because I think it is a horrible 
service, and they rip people off. I have 
known people who got cancer. I don’t 
take money from the cigarette compa-
nies. 
So you don’t have to take support 
from everybody who is willing to sup-
port you. But when Black Lives Matter 
puts on their website, we disrupt the 
western-prescribed nuclear family, and 
we have an American government right 
now which, to me, is discriminating 
against couples who are married, you 
have to wonder, was this by chance, or 
are these people who want to set up 
government programs to discriminate 
against families? 
b 1130 
I would like to give people a chance 
to publicize this problem in hearings 
and see if there’s something we can do 
about this problem. 
So I have asked the chairman of the 
Education 
and 
Labor 
Committee, 
which has something to do with pro-
grams like Pell grants, to have a hear-
ing and see whether my constituent is 
right: Are we really, in the United 
States Government, expressing strong 
bias against couples who are married, 
and penalizing them? 
I have forwarded a request like this 
to the chairman of the committee. 
I think it is a problem that has been 
out there ever since Lyndon Johnson, 
in the 1960s, began his war on the fam-
ily. 
I personally think he was the worst 
President in this country’s history, and 
it is not just because he declared war 
on the family. He did a bad job in pros-
ecuting the Vietnam war, his personal 
life was a hodgepodge, but of all the 
bad things he did, I think his programs 
aimed at destroying the family was the 
worst thing. 
So I guess to illustrate that Members 
of the other party are also a little bit 
concerned about these programs that 
penalize what they refer to as the tra-
ditional western family, though it is 
the traditional family used by people 
who are not western European at all, I 
would like to ask for such a hearing.

HONORING NEW YORK STATE 
SENATOR BETTY LITTLE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
New York (Ms. STEFANIK) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in honor of New York State Sen-
ator Betty Little, an extraordinarily 
dedicated and effective public servant 
for the north country, to congratulate 
her on her upcoming retirement. 
Betty has dedicated decades of her 
life to representing the hardworking 
families of upstate New York, both 
during her time in the New York State 
Assembly and the State Senate. 
Senator Little first began her career 
in public service at the local level, and 
served in many capacities while also 
working as a teacher before her elec-
tion to the New York State Assembly 
in 1995. She was later elected to the 
State Senate in 2002. 
Betty has accomplished countless 
legislative results over the years, ex-
panding benefits for military families, 
saving hardworking taxpayer dollars, 
protecting jobs in the Adirondacks, and 
always standing up for the people of 
the north country. 
While petite in stature, Betty is 
truly a giant among public servants. 
Senator Little sought election to 
public office as a working mother, a 
time when this was a lot harder and 
less in vogue. She quietly shattered in-
numerable glass ceilings and paved the 
way for generations of women to come. 
I am proud to call Betty Little a leg-
islative partner, a role model, and a 
dear friend. 
I offer Betty my most sincere con-
gratulations and gratitude, and I wish 
her and her family all the best in this 
next chapter. 
It is my privilege to highlight her ac-
complishments in the CONGRESSIONAL 
RECORD.

Lord of us all, we give You thanks for 
giving us another day. 
Send Your spirit of wisdom upon the 
Members of the people’s House as they 
move toward the completion of their 
work in the 116th Congress. After a 
long year of stress in our Nation, due 
to a plague which continues to swell, 
give them the resolve to address the 
needs of all our citizens and commu-
nities. 
Bless those many heroic men and 
women who continue to labor, at great 
danger to themselves, to care for those 
who suffer from COVID. Bring healing 
to those who do suffer, and comfort 
those who mourn the loss of so much 
this past year. Lord, have mercy. 
May all that is done this day in the 
people’s House be for Your greater 
honor and glory. 
Amen.

lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

HONORING THE LEGACY OF 
DANIEL MILLER 
(Mrs. BUSTOS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the legacy of Daniel 
Miller, the eldest of six children, from 
Galesburg, Illinois. 
A member of the varsity football 
team, his principal described him as 
‘‘always smiling’’ and ‘‘caring about 
everyone.’’ 
In 2004, he joined the Air Force and 
continued to lead as a senior airman. 
With great courage, he defused explo-
sive devices and worked with chemical 
and biological weapons. 
On January 7, 2007, Senior Airman 
Miller, Senior Airman Elizabeth A. 
Loncki, and Technical Sergeant Tim-
othy R. Weiner all made the ultimate 
sacrifice, attempting to defuse a car 
bomb in Iraq. 
Our Nation will never be able to 
repay them, but it is our duty to re-
member their service. It is my honor 
today to commemorate the service of 
Senior Airman Miller with the dedica-
tion of the U.S. Post Office on East 
Main Street in Galesburg, Illinois, as 
the Senior Airman Daniel Miller Post 
Office Building.

STUDENT DEBT 
(Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, today I would like to address 
the crippling cost of student debt. 
Although my Democratic colleagues 
and I agree substantially on the issue, 
we disagree substantially on the solu-
tion. We need to cure the disease, not 
just put a Band-Aid on it.

college free altogether does not address

the problem. It just passes the debt on 
to people who have responsibly paid off 
their student loans, while encouraging 
the reckless spending on administra-
tive bloat in higher education. 
From 1988 to 2018, the average tuition 
and fees at public 4-year institutions 
tripled and more than doubled at pri-
vate 4-year institutions. We have seen 
an explosion of vice presidents, coun-
selors, diversity coaches, and all types 
of administrative staff who have noth-
ing to do with giving their students a 
means of finding employment. 
Why? Because they can. The money 
flows freely from the Federal Govern-
ment, and they know that—all at the 
expense of the student. 
So rather than climbing walls, lazy 
rivers, and so-called safe spaces and 
then asking for bailouts, universities 
should be cutting costs and focusing on 
educating their students. This frivo-
lous spending has ruined many young 
people’s futures, and that is how we ad-
dress the calamity of student debt. 
f 
COVID–19 RELIEF 
(Ms. SLOTKIN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today because the American people and 
the people of Michigan need our help. 
They need Congress to pass a COVID 
relief package, and failing to reach a 
deal would be a shameful dereliction of 
duty here in the Congress. 
Just yesterday, my State confirmed 
its 10,000th death. I have hospitals in 
my district that are at 98 percent ca-
pacity, and local businesses face obliv-
ion. 
The images of Americans in their 
cars lining up for hours to pick up 
their Thanksgiving meal should be 
seared into our memories. Make no 
mistake. These food lines are modern- 
day bread lines, and it is our job to do 
something about it. 
Platitudes won’t feed a family, and 
empty words won’t get folks together 
for the holidays. Frankly, it is a slap in 
the face to ICU nurses, our small busi-
ness owners, and frontline workers 
doing everything they can do to weath-
er the crisis. 
It is a slap in the face to the nurse in 
East Lansing who wrote to my office 
pleading for economic relief. Her hus-
band had to stop working in the spring 
to take care of their kids, and every 
day she gets up worried she might 
bring COVID home to them. They are 
getting behind on their bills, on their 
rent, and they are taking out loans 
against their retirement. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask the leaders of both 
parties and of both Chambers to wit-
ness these stories, do their jobs, and 
reach a deal, even if it is not perfect. 
f 
FAREWELL TO MAJOR JEREMY 
TILLMAN 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I am grateful for Major Jer-
emy E. Tillman, who has been serving 
in the Washington office of the Second 
Congressional District of South Caro-
lina from the Army for the past year as 
a Defense fellow. 
Major Tillman has been deployed 
twice: to the Republic of Korea and to 
Iraq. He is the recipient of the Purple 
Heart, the Bronze Service Medal, the 
Global War on Terrorism Medal, the 
Combat Action Badge, the Army Com-
mendation Medal, and many other de-
served awards. 
Major Tillman has been essential to 
the office over the past year. He has 
worked to solidify important legisla-
tion in the National Defense Author-
ization Act, NDAA, including modifica-
tion of body armor for female troops. 
I am thankful for his commitment to 
America. I wish him well and the best 
for his future. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops, 
and we will never forget September the 
11th in the global war on terrorism. 
I appreciate President Donald Trump 
as a champion for our military for 
peace through strength.

CONGRATULATING RABBI 
SERNOVITZ 
(Mrs. MCBATH asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Mrs. MCBATH. Mr. Speaker, I am so 
excited to be here on the floor today to 
congratulate Rabbi Larry Sernovitz on 
becoming the senior rabbi of Temple 
Kol Emeth in Marietta, Georgia. 
In just the few short months that I 
have known the rabbi, he has been in-
strumental in helping to spread our 
shared message of God’s love for all 
people and tikkun olam. 
‘‘Tikkun olam’’ translates to ‘‘repair 
of the world,’’ and I know that, to-
gether, our community in Georgia will 
help build bridges to a better and more 
just tomorrow. 
I congratulate the rabbi on his new 
mission from God. Our community is 
blessed to have been gifted a leader 
like him. 
I hope that, if he or his congregation 
ever need assistance from my office, 
they don’t hesitate to call upon us. I 
truly look forward to working with the 
rabbi and the Jewish community in 
Georgia for many years to come, and I 
wish them all a happy and blessed 
Hannukah season. 
f 
FAREWELL SHUWANZA GOFF 
(Mr. MCCARTHY asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, having 
served as both the majority and minor-
ity floor leader, I have understood the 
pressure of the job. Scheduling the 
floor, handling procedural fights, and 
getting legislation passed is truly 24- 
hour, 7-day-a-week work. And on the 
other side of the aisle, no one knows 
that better than Shuwanza Goff. 
It has been my privilege to get to 
know her during her 12 years on the 
Hill, the last 7 of which as floor direc-
tor for Leader HOYER. Without a doubt, 
she has done this job as well as or bet-
ter than any staffer I have ever known. 
She has put in her time and effort to 
build 
strong 
working 
relationships 
with Members and staff on both sides 
of the aisle. 
Shuwanza has earned our respect be-
cause of her skills, her work ethic, and 
her expertise on the floor. There are 
times I have lost the debate because of 
her expertise. 
I certainly like to think that we have 
tested her abilities over the past 2 
years with some of our motions to re-
commit. There are times that I have 
heard, and it has been conveyed to me, 
the differences of opinion with me in 
the strongest of terms, but never did 
she ever do it in a personal way. 
The House is better because of her 
service. 
But even if we haven’t made her job 
easy, we always knew we had to be pre-
pared, because we saw the impact that 
her expertise could have. 
Many a time to many of us, people 
across this country ask if we have 
friends on both sides of the aisle. I 
refer to Shuwanza as my friend. She 
will be my adversary, but she is my 
friend. She has my respect because she 
earned it. She has my friendship be-
cause she has earned it. She has re-
spect from both sides of the aisle be-
cause of the way she carries her life 
and the character of who she is. 
She has left an impression on this 
side of the aisle, and I can tell you she 
has certainly left an impression on this 
institution. 
We get elected and we come here, but 
her character is one of having a serv-
ant’s heart and of caring for this Na-
tion. There are things that divide us in 
our philosophy, but we are not divided 
because we are Americans. We do not 
divide ourselves because we care to 
serve. 
I know Shuwanza believes in a more 
perfect Union because of the devotion 
that she has had and despite the times 
and frustration that this body can give, 
but she does it because of what she be-
lieves in. 
Finally, Shuwanza, speaking as a fa-
ther, I know that you have brought im-
mense joy and pride to your parents 
and to your sister along the way. I 
know they have rooted for you and 
watched every step of your career, a 
career that has seen you walk in the 
well of the House of Representatives on 
a daily basis and serve as a trusted ad-
viser to our Nation’s leaders, and you 
have done it well. My hope for you is 
that you do not give that up, that you 
continue to serve the Nation that you 
love so greatly. 
On behalf of myself, my team, and 
the Republican Conference, I want to

COVID RELIEF PACKAGE 
(Ms. KELLY of Illinois asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to implore my colleagues to 
come together and pass a COVID relief 
bill that will help communities that 
are still struggling to recover from this 
pandemic. 
Since the beginning of December, 
over 150 people a day have died from 
COVID–19 in Illinois. Across the Mid-
west, heat maps are glowing red with 
the increased rates of transmissions 
and deaths. We cannot wait any longer. 
Families and small businesses are 
looking for Congress to act. Time and 
time again, we have seen the House 
take action, only to have the GOP Sen-
ate ignore the crisis facing this coun-
try. The increase in empty chairs 
around 
kitchen 
tables 
and 
vacant 
storefronts will only continue if we do 
not take decisive action. 
Mr. Speaker, a recent study found 
that 1 in 3 African Americans know 
someone close to them who died of 
COVID–19. I fall into this category, as 
I lost my uncle in May, and I know 
many of my constituents do as well. 
Something has to be done. People need 
money now to meet their expenses. 
Businesses need support now to con-
tinue operating, and State and local 
governments need assistance now to 
provide services. Inaction is not an op-
tion. 
Mr. Speaker, lastly, I say Happy Ha-
nukkah to all our Jewish friends. 
f 
RECOGNIZING CUBA’S PRO- 
DEMOCRACY ACTIVISTS 
(Mr. DIAZ-BALART asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to bring attention to the brave ac-
tion of the pro-democracy leaders in 
Cuba and the brutal repression that 
they face as a result of their demands 
for freedom. 
For example, in the last few weeks, 
the San Isidro Movement has stepped 
up its calls for freedom and the release 
of all political prisoners. Their protests 
include such dangerous activities as 
poetry readings and sit-ins. And for 
that, these young rappers, artists, and 
writers have faced arbitrary arrests, 
harassment, and abuse. 
Mr. Speaker, some remain in prison, 
which is why many activists have 
begun a hunger strike in protest. But 
despite the brutal repression in Cuba, 
the pro-democracy movement is grow-
ing. Mothers, scientists, and so many 
others have joined its calls for freedom 
and the release of political prisoners. 
I commend President Trump and his 
administration 
for 
their 
solidarity 
with the Cuban people in imposing seri-
ous sanctions against the Cuban dicta-
torship. We must all stand with the 
brave pro-democracy activists in Cuba, 
who are risking their lives at this very 
moment, and join them in their pleas 
for freedom and the immediate uncon-
ditional release of all political pris-
oners. 
f 
IN HONOR OF HUMAN RIGHTS DAY, 
FREE THE PANCHEN LAMA 
(Mr. MCGOVERN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, on 
Human Rights Day, we mark the adop-
tion of The Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights. 
Mr. Speaker, 72 years ago, China was 
among the countries committing itself 
to the principle that ‘‘all human beings 
are born free and equal in dignity and 
rights.’’ In this spirit, I call on the Chi-
nese Government to release Gedhun 
Choekyi Nyima, the 11th Panchen 
Lama. 
In May of 1995, only days after 
Gedhun Choekyi Nyima was chosen to 
serve as the 11th Panchen Lama, the 
Chinese Government kidnapped him 
and his family. The outside world has 
neither seen nor heard from them 
since. Chinese authorities tell the 
world that the Panchen Lama and his 
family are safe, and they say that they 
are well, but they refuse to allow any-
one to visit and verify his well-being. 
Mr. Speaker, the Universal Declara-
tion enshrines the rights to liberty and 
religious freedom and precludes arbi-
trary detention. China should honor its 
international obligations by freeing 
the true Panchen Lama.

HONORING THE LIFE OF CHARLES 
ELLZY 
(Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the life of a very 
special human being, Mr. Charles Ellzy, 
who our community lost earlier this 
year. 
Mr. Speaker, Charles was a proud 
graduate of Bensalem High School and 
Temple University. 
In 1963, Charles met the love of his 
life, Rosia. They would go on to have 
two children, Samantha and Vincent. 
Charles dedicated his entire life to 
bettering our community. He spent 
over 25 years working for the Depart-
ment of Defense in Philadelphia, and 
Charles was also the president of the 
Lin-Park Civic Association. 
Under his leadership, the LPCA es-
tablished a community baseball league, 
organized fundraising events, and col-
laborated with Betz Laboratories to 
create the Lin-Park Betz Scholarship. 
Mr. Speaker, Charles also served for 
years as a deacon at the Linconia Tab-
ernacle Christian Center in Bensalem. 
His connection and love for God fueled 
his complete and total dedication to 
others. 
And in August, the Bensalem Town-
ship Council unanimously passed a res-
olution renaming Warren Avenue to 
Charles Ellzy Way in his honor. 
Mr. Speaker, this past weekend, I had 
the honor of joining Charles’ family 
and congregants of the Linconia Taber-
nacle Christian Center for the unveil-
ing of such a fitting tribute to an 
amazing man. 
Mr. Speaker, we are extremely grate-
ful for Charles’ contributions, for his 80 
years of life, and may the spirit of his 
generosity and service continue to in-
spire our community. Charles is now 
reaping the reward of a life he spent 
serving others.

COLORADO’S 
FIRE-
FIGHTERS AND FIRST RESPOND-
ERS 
(Mr. NEGUSE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to offer my heartfelt gratitude 
to our Colorado firefighters and first 
responders. 
This year in Colorado, in my district, 
we have experienced a devastating and 
relentless wildfire season; the Cameron 
Peak fire in Larimer County, the East 
Troublesome fire in Grand County, the 
Calwood fire, and the Williams Fork 
fire. 
With over a half a million acres 
burned, Colorado has experienced great 
loss, damage, and destruction. For 
months, our firefighters and first re-
sponders have worked around the clock 
to save lives, save homes, and to pro-
tect our communities. We know this 
work is not easy, especially in the 
midst of a pandemic, and we are so 
grateful for the service, the sacrifice, 
and the commitment of our fire-
fighters, our first responders, our local 
emergency management officials and 
law enforcement in Grand County, in 
Larimer County, in Boulder County, 
and across the State of Colorado. 
Together, we will rebuild and we will 
continue to work together. Thank you 
for your work. We are so incredibly 
grateful.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7062 
December 9, 2020 
Carver State Bank on his election as 
chair of the National Bankers Associa-
tion. 
The National Bankers Association is 
based in Washington, D.C., and has rep-
resented minority-owned and women- 
owned banks in the U.S. since 1927. 
Mr. James wears many hats. He 
serves Carver State Bank as its direc-
tor of Strategic Initiatives and is a 
member of its board of directors; is a 
partner at the law firm, Golden Holley 
James, LLP; and is president of Coast-
al Legacy Group, LLC, which is a real 
estate 
development 
and 
consulting 
firm he founded in 2004. 
When he was earning his law degree 
at Harvard, he received a legal training 
scholarship and was elected president 
of Harvard Black Law Students Asso-
ciation, as well. By stepping up to the 
plate to lead the National Bankers As-
sociation, he has demonstrated his 
dedication to serving his community 
and contributing to the success of the 
American banking industry as a whole. 
Congratulations, again, on this great 
accomplishment. Mr. Speaker, I wish 
Mr. James the very best. 
f 
ELECTORAL COLLEGE 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
know 
that 
we 
will 
be 
discussing 
COVID–19, and I cannot stand on this 
floor without ever mentioning that we 
must help the American people. 
But today I stand on this floor to ac-
knowledge the existence of the Elec-
toral College. 
Mr. Speaker, many Americans are 
unfamiliar with this very interesting 
fixture in law. Article II, Section 1 of 
the Constitution gives us the Electoral 
College. But let me be very clear. In 
the next couple of days, many States 
will certify those who have voted. The 
Electoral College will meet, by the 
Constitution, on December 14. Most 
State legislators have indicated that 
the electors are to vote the popular 
vote. All of the battleground States 
have certified that the next President 
and Vice President of the United 
States are Joe Biden and KAMALA HAR-
RIS. 
What is my plea today? 
My plea today is for us to harmo-
niously join together in recognizing 
the value of this Constitution, the 
sanctity of democracy, and to proceed 
as a House and Senate to embrace this 
election and the victors. 
Why? 
Because the Nation needs us, and the 
Constitution says so. 
Mr. Speaker, I look forward to us 
working together.

CONGRATULATING 
REPRESENTA-
TIVE MICHAEL CONAWAY ON HIS 
RETIREMENT 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank, cel-
ebrate, and congratulate my friend and 
colleague, MIKE CONAWAY, who will be 
leaving us to enjoy his much-deserved 
retirement. 
Mr. Speaker, it has been a tremen-
dous privilege and honor to serve under 
MIKE’s leadership throughout my time 
on the Committee on Agriculture, and 
I am grateful to have worked with such 
a tireless advocate for rural America. 
MIKE’s leadership on the 2018 farm 
bill was particularly impressive, which 
marked the first time in nearly 30 
years that a farm bill was enacted in 
the same year that it was introduced. I 
continue to be inspired by MIKE’s prin-
ciples in leadership outside of com-
mittee work as well. I have been lucky 
enough to share many Wednesday 
mornings with him as a brother of 
faith during Bible study. 
Mr. Speaker, I send my very best 
wishes to MIKE and his wife, Suzanne, 
who has been kind enough to share him 
with us for over the last 16 years. 
I thank MIKE for his friendship and 
guidance over the years. He will be sin-
cerely missed. 
f 
COVID RELIEF FOR AMERICANS 
(Ms. SCANLON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, it has 
been 257 days since the first major 
COVID relief package was signed into 
law—257 days. In that time period, 
COVID cases in the U.S. have sky-
rocketed, and we have lost almost 
290,000 Americans. 
The 
devastation 
this 
virus 
has 
wrought on our families, our commu-
nities, and our economy is enormous. 
But it would have been so much worse 
if we had not provided that early relief 
to our families, our small businesses, 
and workers impacted by the spring 
surge. And economists are clear that 
we need to provide more direct relief in 
order to buoy the economy, much less 
to keep people safe. 
The relief that we are seeking, that 
the American people are seeking is not 
a handout. It is a lifeline. It is critical 
to get relief in the hands of families, 
small businesses, frontline workers, 
and local governments so we can get 
the virus under control. But, also, so 
we can get the country back to work 
once we do so. 
Mr. Speaker, time is of the essence. 
Unemployment is running out, small 
businesses—and 
especially, 
res-
taurants—are closing. Families are fac-
ing eviction and foreclosure. 
Mr. Speaker, fighting this pandemic 
has been hard enough on the American 
people. Getting them the relief they 
need to stay safe and healthy shouldn’t 
be. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, the Chair 
will 
postpone 
further 
proceedings 
today on motions to suspend the rules 
on which the yeas and nays are or-
dered. 
The House will resume proceedings 
on postponed questions at a later time.

SCORECARDS.—The

et Scorekeeping Guidelines set forth in the 
joint explanatory statement of the com-
mittee of conference accompanying Con-
ference Report 105–217 and section 250(c)(8) of 
the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit 
Control Act of 1985, the budgetary effects of 
this division shall not be estimated—

and 
(2) for purposes of paragraph (4)(C) of sec-
tion 3 of the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act 
of 2010 as being included in an appropriation 
Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Connecticut (Ms. DELAURO) and the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Texas 
(Ms. 
GRANGER) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Connecticut. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the bill, 
H.R. 8900, currently under consider-
ation. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Connecticut? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, as we speak, the Appro-
priations Committees are hard at work 
negotiating fiscal year 2021 appropria-
tions bills. There are many serious 
issues facing our Nation, and Federal 
funding plays a critical role in sup-
porting families and communities as 
they go about their day-to-day lives as 
they try to survive during this health 
and economic crisis. 
Mr. Speaker, Americans deserve the 
certainty of a full-year funding, and 
the Congress has a responsibility to the 
Nation to do its job and pass all 12 
funding bills before we adjourn. 
The continuing resolution we con-
sider today will keep the government 
up and running to bring spending talks 
to a successful conclusion. These are 
serious issues that touch every aspect 
of people’s lives, like their education, 
transportation systems, national secu-
rity, public health infrastructure, and 
our environment. 
b 1230 
In addition to an omnibus appropria-
tions bill, it is my hope that this addi-
tional week will allow negotiators the 
time 
to 
assemble 
an 
emergency 
coronavirus relief package. 
To take advantage of this window of 
opportunity, Leader MCCONNELL must 
finally sit down with Democrats to find 
a bipartisan solution. 
Coupled with a full year of govern-
ment funding, an interim coronavirus 
relief package is critical. It is a lifeline 
for working families. If we do not act, 
12 million Americans could lose unem-
ployment aid just after Christmas, and 
millions could lose access to paid sick 
leave and protections against evic-
tions. This will put working families 
over the edge and our economy closer 
to the financial cliff. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
adopting this continuing resolution. 
Let us support the ongoing negotia-
tions. 
People are desperate. They are count-
ing on us. We need to provide relief to 
working families, to our schools, to our 
children, to small businesses, and to 
communities across the Nation. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 8900, a con-
tinuing resolution that will fund the 
government through December 18. 
Members of the Appropriations Com-
mittee have been negotiating night and 
day for weeks to reach agreement on a 
full-year appropriations bill. At the 
same time, House and Senate leaders 
continue to discuss a coronavirus relief 
package with the administration. It is 
my hope that we can complete both of 
these important pieces of legislation as 
soon as possible. 
There is so much at stake: our na-
tional security, the health and welfare 
of millions of Americans, and our eco-
nomic recovery. Passing this 1-week 
CR is simply a stopgap measure. I ex-
pect we will be back on the floor next 
week to complete the year’s work. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
voting in favor of this continuing reso-
lution so that the Senate can pass it 
and send it to the President for signa-
ture. Then, we must immediately get 
back to the important work the Amer-
ican people expect us to finish. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. HOYER). 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
congratulate Ms. DELAURO. She and I 
have served on the Appropriations 
Committee together and in the Con-
gress for a very long time. She is one of 
our most able, energetic, and knowl-
edgeable Members. 
As someone who is very proud of my 
relationship 
to 
the 
Appropriations 
Committee, I know that she will do an 
excellent job working with the minor-
ity and the ranking member, with 
whom I also served, to make sure that 
the Appropriations Committee works 
in a way that benefits the American 
people and does so in a timely fashion. 
Normally, I would not speak—well, 
though I do speak most of the time on 
the CR, because the CR is a recognition 
of failure. It is not any one individual’s 
failure. It is not a bad thing. It is just 
that we have had trouble getting to-
gether and coming to an agreement. 
I want to observe, and maybe it has 
already been observed, we passed 10 of 
our 12 appropriations bills by July 26. 
That was 2 months before the end of 
the fiscal year. The Senate, unfortu-
nately, didn’t pass any of its appropria-
tions bills. It still has not passed any 
of its appropriations bills. It has a doc-
ument that they did not pass through 
committee and has not passed the Sen-
ate that is the basis for our negotia-
tions. 
That has delayed us substantially, 
not because the House didn’t do its 
work on time, but, because for what-
ever reasons, the Senate did not ad-
dress the appropriations process in a 
timely fashion. 
Mr. Speaker, I have served on the Ap-
propriations Committee for a long 
time. I went on in January 1983. I was 
on 
the 
subcommittee 
that 
Ms. 
DELAURO now chairs as well. When we 
would pass a bill, the Senate would 
pass a bill, and we would go to con-
ferences. Some of our Members don’t 
know what a conference is. 
The Members of the House com-
mittee and the Members of the Senate 
committee came together in a room 
and talked about how we were going to 
resolve the differences between the two 
bills. That hardly ever happens now, 
and we are losing something of the leg-
islative process because it doesn’t hap-
pen. 
With all due respect to the four peo-
ple who now are called the four cor-
ners, whether it is the chairs of the 
committees, or the Speaker and the 
minority leader in the House, and the 
minority leader and the majority lead-
er in the Senate, those four people have 
a lot of work to do. 
I am the majority leader over here. I 
know I have a lot of things to watch 
out for, and I cannot focus the way the 
members of the subcommittees focus 
on the substance of the issues. There-
fore, we lose something by not having 
all of the Members included. 
Now, because that hasn’t happened, 
and they haven’t come up with a prod-
uct, we are here with what we call a 
continuing resolution. But that really 
is an admission of failure. 
We passed one before September 30 so 
the government didn’t shut down. It 
was the right thing to do. We are going 
to pass one now. It is the right thing to 
do. This is something that we have to 
do to keep the government working. 
But we ought not believe or pretend 
or represent this is the way we ought 
to do business. It is not. It is a function 
of procrastination, a function of failing 
to come together and making com-
promises. 
That is what this body is about, all of 
these chairs here. We have to come to 
an agreement. The Constitution says if 
we don’t come to an agreement and the 
Senate doesn’t come to an agreement 
and the President doesn’t come to an 
agreement 
with 
exactly 
the 
same 
thing, nothing happens.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7065 
December 9, 2020 
I make this observation every time 
we do this. But I will tell you this, Mr. 
Speaker. I have talked to the new 
chair—and I know the ranking mem-
ber, and I have worked with her and 
have great respect for her, as she 
knows. Why? Because she wants to get 
a job done. 
She was a mayor. She was a mayor of 
a great city in the State of Texas. She 
knows that you have to get things 
done. 
Ms. DELAURO is a person who gets 
things done. 
I am going to work with both of 
them, Mr. Speaker, in this coming Con-
gress. We are going to pass every one of 
the appropriations bills, every one. 
We haven’t dealt with homeland se-
curity because of the wall, not because 
of the other items, but the wall. We 
had a disagreement. We couldn’t forge 
agreement on that and compromise on 
that. 
I am going to work with both the 
chair and the ranking member, and, 
frankly, all the Members on both sides 
of the aisle to get our work done by 
June 30 of this coming year. That will 
give us 90 days to reach agreement 
with the Senate, pass the bills, and do 
it by September 30. 
We have rarely done that. I think in 
my 40 years of service in this House, I 
think we have done it twice. I would 
have to check. Maybe it was only once. 
Maybe you could tell me that, and we 
could find out. But I am hopeful that 
we will do it. 
There aren’t many Members on this 
floor. This CR has to pass. All we did 
was change the date because of prac-
tically recognizing we have not gotten 
our work done on time. 
And whoever is listening, whether 
the public or other Members are listen-
ing, Mr. Speaker, as I speak, I hope 
they will take to heart our responsi-
bility to the American people, and to 
this institution, to make it work on 
time. 
I told the majority leader of the 
United States Senate just about 2 days 
ago, 3 days ago, I said: MITCH, there is 
no agreement we can make on Decem-
ber 18 that we can’t make on December 
11. There is no magic in these next 7 
days—now, I guess, 9 days. There is no 
magic in it. It is just, psychologically, 
we have until December 18, so we won’t 
make the agreement today. 
That is why I set December 11, be-
cause I was hopeful that we could do it 
by December 11. I urged the Members 
to do December 11, very frankly, for 
two reasons. Number one, it is the 
right thing to do. And number two, our 
Members are at risk when they travel. 
They are at risk here. They need to be 
in their homes quarantined with people 
who do not pose them any risk. 
It is not that we want to shirk our 
duty. We can do our duty, but we don’t 
need to be here for 2 more weeks or 1 
more week to do it. We just have to 
have the thought in mind we are going 
to get it done today. 
This will give us 8 more days, 9 more 
days to do it. I know the staff is going 
to be working round the clock over the 
weekend to get us a bill done. 
We need to pass three bills. We 
passed the NDAA last night. That bill 
should be passed in June as well, or 
late May. I told Mr. SMITH and the new 
ranking member that I am going to do 
everything I can to have that bill on 
the floor this coming May. We tradi-
tionally did that. I am not inventing 
something. Ms. DELAURO knows we did 
that; the ranking member knows we 
did that. 
We all say it is a very important bill. 
Well, if it is a very important bill, let’s 
deal with it in a timely fashion and not 
have this last-minute veto; we are 
going to do this. 
We need to pass it, and 335 of us yes-
terday said we need to pass this bill. 
So, I will end this tirade by simply 
saying 
congratulations 
to 
Ms. 
DELAURO and to the ranking member, 
who is a good friend and a very respon-
sible Member of this House. 
I will work closely with them and 
with all of our Members, Mr. Speaker, 
to make sure that the American people 
can be proud of the fact that the House 
of Representatives knows its respon-
sibilities, meets its responsibilities, 
and passes legislation in a timely fash-
ion and does not say to the Federal em-
ployees and the people who are oper-
ating government: Maybe you will be 
funded tomorrow and maybe you won’t. 
We have wasted billions of dollars 
over the years I have been here with 
the government trying to figure out 
how they are going to prepare for a 
shutdown. Any business that operated 
that way in America would go bank-
rupt pretty soon. The CEO would be 
fired, and the board of directors, which 
we are, might be fired as well. 
Let’s learn the lesson that we learn 
too often, and let’s do our work on 
time and do it well. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
certainly associate with the concerns 
of the majority leader, Mr. HOYER. I as-
sociate myself with his concerns and 
my appreciation for the Appropriations 
Committee. 
Let me thank Ms. DELAURO and my 
fellow Texan, Ms. GRANGER, and cer-
tainly make mention of her ascending 
to continue as ranking member in the 
next Congress. 
I rise to support this underlying leg-
islation for the extension of the CR to 
December 18. And I rise to, as well, re-
emphasize the desperate conditions 
Americans are in. There are 14 million 
COVID–19 cases, almost 300,000 dead. It 
is predicted to have Americans, trag-
ically, that will possibly lose their life 
in 2021, of upward of 500,000 Americans. 
This is a funding bill. When we say 
keep the government open, what we 
really mean is to serve the American 
people, to make sure that they have 
healthcare, that they have education 
dollars, that they are able to fund their 
local police and fire, that they have 
childcare dollars, that they have re-
search dollars. 
At the same time, if I went on any 
local street in America today, they 
would be asking me to give them a life-
line so their restaurants can stay open. 
The small businesses, they would be 
asking about their unemployment ex-
tension and the cash payments. 
That is what we need to get into the 
negotiation, and we are hoping to do 
the funding bill and COVID–19 as well. 
I want to rise on the floor today to 
make a number of points in particular: 
the necessity of the unemployment ex-
tension and increase—we had $600 in 
the past—and the necessity of the cash 
payment as well. 
But I also want to make mention of 
the fact that our local jurisdictions, 
our cities and counties and Tribal ju-
risdictions, they need the money for 
public funding to go directly to them, 
no strings attached by the State. They 
are losing out. Their firefighters are 
losing out; their health clinics are los-
ing out; and their municipal workers 
are losing out because it is getting en-
tangled with the State. 
Finally, the Department of Transpor-
tation needs funding for its environ-
mental assessment for projects like I– 
45. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
an additional 30 seconds to the gentle-
woman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
b 1245 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, 
there are so many projects, like I–45 in 
Texas, that recklessly tears into mi-
nority neighborhoods without any re-
sponse to those voters, those constitu-
ents, wiping out their houses and 
churches and schools. So the Depart-
ment of Transportation funding will be 
in here that we will have the oppor-
tunity to assess environment impact 
statements. 
Finally, let me offer my greatest ap-
preciation 
for 
Chairwoman 
NITA 
LOWEY; yes, an angel on this floor for 
so many years, guiding us, leading us 
in a way that brought back the kind of 
success that America needs. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Ms. DELAURO 
for her hard work and I wish her suc-
cess as well. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, before I close, I want to 
take a minute to congratulate Con-
gresswoman DELAURO for being named 
chairwoman of the full committee next 
Congress. I look forward to working 
with her in the coming years. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes’’ on the bill before us today, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I know the majority 
leader has left the floor, but I thank

him for his congratulations and his 
warm words. I look forward to working 
in conjunction with him as we move to 
pass 12 bills by June. 
I want to particularly say how 
pleased I am to be able to work with 
the ranking member, my colleague 
from Texas. We have worked on issues 
in the past, never at this level, but I 
am looking forward to a really close 
and wonderful relationship as we try to 
do the Nation’s business. Thank you so 
very much. 
Mr. Speaker, with an additional week 
to negotiate, I am optimistic that we 
can fund the government for this year 
and we can deliver coronavirus relief 
for the American people who are des-
perate and looking to us for hope. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in passing this extension of 
funding so we can complete our work. 
It is not about us. We have the respon-
sibility, but it is about the people out-
side of this Chamber who are relying 
on us. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Connecticut 
(Ms. DELAURO) that the House suspend 
the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 8900. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, on that 
I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3 of House Resolution 
965, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion will be 
postponed. 
f 
REAFFIRMING COMMITMENT TO 
MEDIA DIVERSITY 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and agree to the 
resolution (H. Res. 549) reaffirming the 
commitment to media diversity and 
pledging to work with media entities 
and diverse stakeholders to develop 
common ground solutions to eliminate 
barriers to media diversity. 
The Clerk read the title of the resolu-
tion. 
The text of the resolution is as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 549 
Whereas the principle that an informed 
and engaged electorate is critical to a vi-
brant democracy is deeply rooted in our laws 
of free speech and underpins the virtues on 
which we established our Constitution, ‘‘in 
Order to form a more perfect Union, estab-
lish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, 
provide for the common defence, promote 
the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings 
of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity 
. . .’’; 
Whereas having independent, diverse, and 
local media that provide exposure to a broad 
range of viewpoints and the ability to con-
tribute to the political debate is central to 
sustaining that informed engagement; 
Whereas it is in the public interest to en-
courage source, content, and audience diver-
sity on our Nation’s shared telecommuni-
cations and media platforms; 
Whereas 
the 
survival 
of 
small, 
inde-
pendent, and diverse media outlets that 
serve diverse audiences and local media mar-
kets is essential to preserving local culture 
and building understanding on important 
community issues that impact the daily 
lives of residents; 
Whereas research by the American Society 
of News Editors, the Radio Television Digital 
News Association, the Pew Research Center, 
and others has documented the continued 
challenges of increasing diversity among all 
types of media entities; 
Whereas with increasing media experience 
and sophistication, it is even more impor-
tant to have minority participation in local 
media to ensure a diverse range of informa-
tion sources are available and different ideas 
and viewpoints are expressed to strengthen 
social cohesion among different commu-
nities; and 
Whereas the constriction in small, inde-
pendent, and diverse media outlets and lim-
ited participation of diverse populations in 
media ownership and decisionmaking are 
combining to negatively impact our goal of 
increasing local civic engagement and civic 
knowledge through increased voter partici-
pation, membership in civic groups, and 
knowledge of local political and civil infor-
mation: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives— 
(1) reaffirms its commitment to diversity 
as a core tenet of the public interest stand-
ard in media policy; and 
(2) pledges to work with media entities and 
diverse stakeholders to develop common 
ground solutions to eliminate barriers to 
media diversity. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Oregon (Mr. WALDEN) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H. Res. 
549. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of H. Res. 549, reaffirming the commit-
ment to media diversity and pledging 
to work with media entities and di-
verse stakeholders to develop common 
ground solutions to eliminate barriers 
to media diversity. 
This resolution promotes much-need-
ed diversity in the communications 
marketplace, and I commend Rep-
resentative DEMINGS and her staff for 
all their efforts towards this resolu-
tion. 
Mr. Speaker, I also thank Ranking 
Member WALDEN, Communications and 
Technology Subcommittee Chairman 
DOYLE, and Subcommittee Ranking 
Member LATTA for their work to bring 
this resolution to the floor. 
This past year has highlighted racial 
inequities that have long existed in our 
society, as we saw with the protests 
over the murder of George Floyd and 
the disparate impact that the COVID– 
19 pandemic is having on communities 
of color. 
These inequities also exist in our 
communications marketplace. For ex-
ample, the owners of broadcast and 
media outlets do not reflect our diverse 
population. These media outlet owners 
make critical decisions about the edu-
cational, political, entertainment, and 
news programming Americans watch, 
and those decisions can influence peo-
ple’s opinions and perceptions. 
Diversity in viewpoints and diverse 
ownership of media outlets promotes 
programming that offers different per-
spectives and enables viewers to access 
programming that is relevant to them. 
A diverse media marketplace is also 
central to an informed and engaged 
electorate, which is critical to a vi-
brant democracy. 
Committing to a diverse media mar-
ketplace, one that reflects our country, 
is a worthy goal, and this resolution 
reaffirms that goal. 
Today’s resolution is a good step for-
ward, but there is much more that we 
need to do. The numbers and statistics 
are clear that our media marketplace 
does not resemble the people we serve. 
I hope we can come together to do 
the additional work that is needed, and 
I urge all of my colleagues to support 
this resolution. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H. Res. 549. This is a resolution in-
troduced 
by 
my 
colleague, 
Mrs. 
DEMINGS, that reaffirms the commit-
ment by Congress to work with media 
entities and diverse stakeholders to 
find 
common 
ground 
solutions 
to 
eliminate barriers to diversity in our 
media. 
As a former radio broadcaster myself, 
I understand the efforts that the broad-
cast industry, and the media industry 
as a whole, takes to ensure diversity of 
ownership, 
viewpoint, 
and 
employ-
ment. My wife and I had to make those 
hiring decisions for our five radio sta-
tions. I know firsthand the business 
imperative to serve your community 
with local news and local programming 
that reflects the makeup of your com-
munity. 
While today’s resolution focuses spe-
cifically on broadcast stations, this 
problem is not unique to one segment 
of the media industry; it is also an 
issue for their cable and digital stream-
ing competitors in the marketplace. 
I appreciate the many steps that the 
industry has taken, not only to recog-
nize and take responsibility for this, 
but also to put in place the many pro-
grams and initiatives to promote op-
portunities for women, minorities, and 
veterans. But as the data show, we still 
have room for improvement. 
While the House is considering this 
resolution today, it is my hope that we

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7067 
December 9, 2020 
can work together in a bipartisan man-
ner to address the inequality identified 
in this resolution. 
Republicans on the Energy and Com-
merce Committee have put forward so-
lutions to help uplift minority voices 
and promote media diversity, solutions 
that can actually become law, unlike 
this resolution before us today. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
in 
September, 
the 
House passed H. Res. 5567, the MEDIA 
Diversity Act sponsored by Mr. LONG, 
which would help us better understand 
the market and regulatory barriers for 
socially disadvantaged individuals to 
enter and compete in the marketplace. 
This bill would help us make informed 
policy decisions. 
I have also worked with advocates 
and industry alike to try to find con-
sensus on legislation to establish the 
long-sought broadcaster incubator pro-
gram. Now, this would help increase 
the number of minority-owned broad-
cast stations. 
The Broadcast Diversity in Leader-
ship Act, H.R. 8154, would encourage 
large, established broadcasters to work 
with aspiring broadcasters to break 
down barriers to capital and provide 
mentorship and experience to new, mi-
nority entrants. That is how we can en-
sure their long-term success in serving 
their local communities. We must bet-
ter understand the problem before us 
and how best to incentivize all media 
entities to create opportunities for and 
lift the voices of underrepresented indi-
viduals. 
Today, we can affirm our commit-
ment 
to 
working 
toward 
common 
ground 
solutions, 
as 
this 
solution 
states; but Republicans stand ready to 
work across the aisle to turn these 
common ground solutions into law. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as she may consume to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Florida 
(Mrs. 
DEMINGS), the sponsor of this resolu-
tion. 
Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, first of 
all, I would like to thank the chairman 
and the ranking member for their sup-
port on this resolution. 
Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt that 
media plays a critical role in how we 
see the world and how we see each 
other. When a child sees someone on 
the screen who looks like them, it can 
change their life. 
Mr. Speaker, as you know, we con-
tinue to struggle with ongoing dispari-
ties in housing, education, social jus-
tice, and even this ongoing pandemic. 
Whether in news, movies, TV, or music, 
who tells the story matters because di-
verse perspectives are critical to us un-
derstanding the entire story. 
I am grateful for our cosponsors and 
for my colleagues who will vote for this 
resolution today, and for the media 
representatives who partnered with us 
to move this legislation forward. As we 
continue to work together to unite our 
country, break down barriers, and 
strengthen our future, let’s continue to 
utilize the powerful diverse voices who 
truly are our strength. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues 
for their support on this resolution. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. LATTA), the top Republican on the 
Communications and Technology Sub-
committee. 
Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H. Res. 549. This 
resolution reaffirms the importance of 
having diverse representation across 
the media to better reflect their audi-
ence and serve the public interest. I 
urge my colleagues to support this 
pledge to eliminate barriers to media 
diversity and to reinforce our commit-
ment to encourage diversity in media 
policy. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to spend 
the remainder of my time to commend 
the leadership of my good friend, the 
ranking member, Mr. WALDEN. Unfor-
tunately, Leader Walden has decided to 
make this his last term in Congress, 
but his work at the Energy and Com-
merce Committee and his service to 
the people of Oregon will continue to 
positively impact our Nation for dec-
ades to come. It is going to be hard to 
imagine going to the committee with-
out him at the helm on our side. 
You have been a steady force, just as 
your family, who has been a steady 
force when they took those wagon 
trains to Oregon on that trail back in 
1845. You have never forgotten your 
roots, and you show that every day. I 
appreciate it because I know, under 
your leadership, you have helped many 
of us in committee. And I know, as 
your vice chair, you had a lot of con-
fidence in me when you let me take 
over the helm on many a day and run 
the committee. 
b 1300 
But as one of your subcommittee 
chairs on Digital Commerce and Con-
sumer Protection and this Congress 
being the ranker on Communications 
and Technology, I appreciate that. 
And I know that, again, when I think 
about all of the things that you have 
worked on, especially in the last Con-
gress and with the opioid epidemic, 
which claimed over 73,000 lives in this 
country, and you were at the helm of 
H.R. 6 and brought together all those 
bills, over 60 pieces of legislation to 
help people in this country. And that is 
going to be a lasting legacy that we are 
going to have. 
So, again, we are going to appreciate 
you, but we also hate to see you leave. 
And also, with all your telecom 
work, to have someone with that expe-
rience, as you mentioned in your open-
ing remarks about you and your bride 
of 38 years, Mylene, owning the radio 
stations and being able to get out there 
and get the work done. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. LATTA) 
an additional 1 minute. 
Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, again, it 
has been a tremendous run with all the 
work that you have done. You have 
been a gentleman and a good friend. 
Something I learned from my dad 
from his 36 years in public service, and 
I will say it again on this floor. He said 
there is a difference between people 
who are politicians and public serv-
ants. He said a politician is a person 
who sees how much they can take from 
the people they represent for their own 
benefit, while a public servant sees how 
much they can give of themselves back 
to the people they represent. 
For what you have done for not only 
your constituents of your great State 
but also here in this body, we are going 
to miss you. 
So, GREG, and that is the first time I 
have ever used a first name on this 
floor, we are going to miss you. I am 
going to miss you, but we wish you all 
the best in the years to come. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no additional speakers, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I believe 
we had two other speakers planning to 
come down and speak, but it does not 
appear they have been able to free 
themselves from their other business. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage us all to 
support this very strong resolution 
that our colleague has offered up, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
for support on this legislation, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and agree to the resolution, H. 
Res. 549. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the resolu-
tion was agreed to. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

production 
incentives 
and 
hydro-
electric efficiency improvement incen-

ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Oregon (Mr. WALDEN) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 3361. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of H.R. 3361, the Reliable Investment in 
Vital Energy Reauthorization Act, or 
the RIVER Act. This bipartisan bill 
was 
introduced 
by 
Representatives 
MCKINLEY, TONKO, and LOEBSACK. 
Hydropower is a vital part of our 
clean energy portfolio, and the RIVER 
Act 
reauthorizes 
important 
hydro-
electric production incentives estab-
lished in the Energy Policy Act of 2005. 
The RIVER Act extends incentives 
that provide payments to owners or op-
erators of hydroelectric facilities that 
are added to existing dams or conduits. 
Additionally, it reauthorizes efficiency 
improvement payments for improving 
facility efficiency. 
I support this legislation, Mr. Speak-
er. I thank my colleagues for their 
hard work on the bill, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
3361. This is the Reliable Investment in 
Vital Energy Reauthorization Act. 
This legislation was introduced by 
my colleagues on the Energy and Com-
merce Committee, Mr. MCKINLEY and 
Mr. TONKO, to reauthorize the Hydro-
electric Production Incentive and hy-
dropower efficiency improvement pro-
grams at the Department of Energy. 
This legislation went through regular 
order, and it passed the full committee, 
Energy and Commerce, by a voice vote. 
H.R. 3361 would authorize payments 
to support the development of hydro-
power production at existing dams and 
conduits. Literally, Mr. Speaker, there 
are thousands of existing dams in the 
United States that can support hydro-
power production while avoiding the 
costs and environmental effects associ-
ated with building new dams. 
In addition to affordable and renew-
able energy, hydropower also provides 
ancillary services to stabilize the elec-
tric grid, to provide storage, to main-
tain emergency black-start capability. 
I am proud to support H.R. 3361, 
which would reauthorize these really 
important Department of Energy pro-
grams and will ensure access to renew-
able, carbon-free, affordable hydro-
power for years to come. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in voting ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 3361, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no speakers on this side, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from West 
Virginia (Mr. MCKINLEY), an engineer 
by trade, a terrific legislator, an im-
portant member of our committee, and 
the sponsor of this legislation. 
Mr. 
MCKINLEY. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
3361, the RIVER Act, and thank Chair-
man TONKO and Congressman LOEBSACK 
for working with us in a bipartisan way 
on this important legislation. 
This RIVER Act reauthorizes key hy-
dropower production and efficiency in-
centives through 2036. Boosting hydro-
power production will ensure that 
Americans have access to affordable, 
clean energy. 
As Congresswoman CATHY MCMORRIS 
RODGERS has previously noted on nu-
merous occasions, only 3 percent of 
America’s 91,000 dams generate elec-
tricity because in part it takes 10 years 
to get a permit to develop new hydro-
power projects. 
This bill will help streamline and de-
velop utilizing existing infrastructure 
and 
overcome 
barriers 
to 
future 
projects. 
I urge my colleagues to support the 
RIVER Act. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask a point of personal 
privilege 
to 
address 
my 
esteemed 
chairman. 
Mr. Speaker, I say to my ranking 
member and my former chairman, col-
league, since I came here 10 years ago, 
coming from the business sector nearly 
50 years in private practice in the busi-
ness of engineering, I have been so im-
pressed with the leadership we have 
had in Energy and Commerce. It wasn’t 
what I was expecting. You and FRED, 
and even to some extent my friend, 
FRANK, to some extent—FRANK, don’t 
get carried away here. 
I have seen you taking on some dif-
ficult issues and using humor, your ap-
proach, you have been able to work 
through some difficult situations com-
ing up with solutions. So you are going 
to be missed. You and Mylene have 
earned the break. But I think of all the 
legislation. 
You have been in my house. You have 
come to West Virginia—‘‘West by God 
Virginia’’—and I do appreciate what 
you have done for us, what you have 
done on the opioid epidemic. It is still 
ravaging West Virginia and across this 
country. 
People have to understand that in 
West Virginia more people are going to 
die from opioids than from COVID this 
year. This is still a problem, but 
thanks to you, we are moving in the 
right direction. 
I can’t express enough how much you 
have meant to me in my career and my 
confidence. The people’s House has 
been in good hands under you, and I 
very much appreciate your service. God 
bless all of you as you continue in your 
retirement. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no additional speakers, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, to my friend from West 
Virginia, it has been a great honor. It 
has been an honor and great privilege 
to serve with you, and I have always 
appreciated your leadership, your great 
insights, your keen intellect as we 
have addressed these issues, especially 
on this issue of opioids. I don’t think 
there was a more passionate player on 
the committee, a more engaged and in-
formed member of the committee on 
this matter than you. 
And the citizens of West Virginia 
and, indeed, the citizens of all Amer-
ica, Mr. Speaker, have a lot to say 
thank you to Mr. MCKINLEY for and 
others in this body certainly, for the 
legislation we passed into law. 
We know there is more work to do, 
and while I may be leaving, I know Mr. 
MCKINLEY is only going to double down 
on that effort going forward. 
Mr. Speaker, this is good legislation 
that Mr. MCKINLEY
and Mr. TONKO 
have brought before us. I urge passage 
of this bill, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I would 
also urge support for this bill, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3361. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
TRIBAL POWER ACT 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 5541) to amend the Energy Policy 
Act of 1992 to reauthorize programs to 
assist consenting Indian Tribes in 
meeting energy education, planning, 
and management needs, and for other 
purposes, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 5541 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled,

Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of H.R. 5541, the Tribal Power Act. This 
is a bipartisan bill that was introduced 
by Representative O’HALLERAN
from 
Arizona and Representative MULLIN 
from Oklahoma, both members of the 
Energy and Commerce Committee. 
This important legislation addresses 
some of the urgent energy needs of 
Tribal communities by improving ac-
cess to energy sources that are afford-
able and reliable. 
H.R. 5541 reauthorizes the Depart-
ment of Energy’s Office of Indian En-
ergy and reauthorizes programs to as-
sist Indian Tribes in meeting energy 
education, planning, and management 
needs. 
Mr. Speaker, we must work with 
Tribal Governments to ensure the 
members of Tribal Nations have access 
to affordable, reliable energy. We have 
made some strong bipartisan strides on 
these matters during this Congress, in-
cluding this bill before us today. 
As we prepare for the upcoming Con-
gress, I am committed to working with 
the 
Energy 
and 
Commerce 
Sub-
committee Chairman RUSH and my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle to do 
even more to help Native American 
communities on these matters in the 
117th Congress. 
I thank the sponsors of this bill for 
their continued work and leadership on 
Tribal issues. I also thank House Nat-
ural Resources Committee Chairman 
GRIJALVA, a champion of Native Amer-
ican priorities, for his support which 
was crucial to bringing this bill to the 
floor today. 
This is an important bipartisan bill 
that deserves to become law. I urge my 
colleagues to join me in supporting 
passage, and I reserve the balance of 
my time.

Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise in support of H.R. 5541, the 
Tribal Power Act. 
This legislation was introduced by 
my colleagues on the Energy and Com-
merce 
Committee, 
Representatives 
O’HALLERAN and MULLIN, and it does 
strengthen the Department of Energy’s 
Tribal Energy Program, which is really 
important 
to 
do.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7070 
December 9, 2020 
H.R. 5541 updates and reauthorizes 
programs at the Department of Energy 
to provide funding and technical assist-
ance to Tribal Governments and orga-
nizations so that they can carry out 
projects that would expand access to 
energy and provide jobs and economic 
development on Indian lands. 
b 1315 
American Indian and Alaska Native 
communities continue to struggle with 
energy affordability and access in 
many cases. Households on some Tribal 
lands also have higher rates of unem-
ployment and lower incomes, meaning 
it may not be feasible to increase elec-
tricity rates to energize homes that are 
not currently connected to the electric 
grid. As a result, communities often 
rely on relatively expensive diesel 
microgrids and generators to power 
homes and businesses. 
H.R. 5541 would help improve energy 
security and affordability on Indian 
lands by reauthorizing important gov-
ernment programs, and it would re-
move some barriers to providing access 
to electric service and recommends 
ways to improve energy education, 
planning, and management. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in supporting H.R. 5541, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no additional speakers on this side, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Okla-
homa (Mr. MULLIN). It is a great honor 
and privilege to recognize Mr. MULLIN, 
a Tribal member, an incredibly impor-
tant member of our committee who has 
given great voice to people who need 
help, and a cosponsor of this legisla-
tion. 
Mr. MULLIN. Mr. Speaker, today I 
rise in support of H.R. 5541, the Tribal 
Power Act. 
As the only Native American that 
serves on the Energy and Commerce 
Committee and one who has lived in In-
dian Country my entire life, this bill is 
extremely important to Tribes. It can 
strategically help us receive capital 
that we need to become energy effi-
cient and enhance our energy infra-
structure. 
I have long been a supporter of the 
economic benefits American energy 
brings to our communities. As sov-
ereign nations, Tribes should have the 
ability to choose and deploy this kind 
of energy and the best kind of energy 
that works for them. I am proud to be 
a colead in this very important issue. 
Now, with the remainder of my time, 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a sec-
ond and recognize our good leader and 
a friend that we are going to lose here 
in Chairman WALDEN. 
Our committee is better because of 
your leadership. Anybody who can put 
up with my attitude and my great per-
sonality and still stay calm and effec-
tively lead our committee, I just want 
to tell you that shows a good leader. It 
shows somebody I would love to follow 
and someone I have enjoyed being able 
to follow. 
Since my time in Congress, you have 
been a friend and a mentor, one that I 
can always count on to give the right 
advice—not necessarily something I al-
ways wanted to hear, but the right ad-
vice. And, as I said before, that is the 
character of a good leader. 
So, for your 22 years of service, and 
as someone who only got to serve with 
you for 8 of those years, it has been a 
great honor, and you will be missed. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no additional speakers, but I do want 
to say that I never thought that Mr. 
MULLIN had a bad attitude. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. 
MULLIN), my friend, for his very gen-
erous, over-the-top words. We have had 
a great working relationship. He is a 
fierce fighter for the causes he believes 
in and has been a terrific legislator and 
will continue to blossom and grow on 
the Energy and Commerce Committee, 
I have no doubt. The country will be 
better served. Indian Country has few 
stronger voices than his, and none 
stronger on the Energy and Commerce 
Committee, I would say. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he 
may consume to the gentleman from 
Louisiana (Mr. SCALISE), my good 
friend, the distinguished Republican 
whip of the House and an incredibly 
important member of the Energy and 
Commerce 
Committee 
who 
always 
came prepared, always did great work, 
and always presented us with his brick 
phone. 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
first thank my friend, the gentleman 
from 
Oklahoma 
(Mr. 
MULLIN), 
for 
bringing this legislation, the Tribal 
Power Act. It is an important piece of 
legislation to help those Tribal com-
munities. He does, as the gentleman 
from Oregon (Mr. WALDEN) said, pro-
vide great leadership for Tribal issues, 
and this is surely one I am sure we will 
work with. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of 
the Energy and Commerce Committee, 
Mr. PALLONE, for bringing this as well. 
Now, with my time, Mr. Speaker, and 
you may want to cut it short if this 
turns into a roast, my friend from Or-
egon is, as Mr. MULLIN said, departing 
at the end of this Congress. 
I am not sure why you would want to 
leave after 22 years in Congress, but 
you have surely earned the right. 
I got to know Mr. WALDEN when I was 
a freshman coming onto the Energy 
and Commerce Committee back in 2009 
in my first year in Congress. 
When you look at the dais now, it has 
surely changed a lot, but back in those 
days, I would offer, of my own good 
will, to make coffee for Mr. WALDEN. 
He was one of those senior members of 
the committee—probably more of a 
junior member, but I was the most jun-
ior member. But we actually developed 
a really good friendship. 
As we do around here, we all battle it 
out on issues. We come up here to fight 
for the things that are important to 
our districts, important to the country 
from our perspective, and then you find 
people along the way you befriend who 
have that same perspective, and Mr. 
WALDEN has been one of those. I have 
learned a lot from him. 
We have really, I think, achieved so 
many things on the Energy and Com-
merce Committee, and especially dur-
ing his time as chairman. 
I just want to mention a few of those 
areas where he has made this a better 
country, because we can all talk about 
the things that we want to do when we 
come up here and you would like to 
work with others, but then to be able 
to look back and see real, tangible 
achievements that make this a better 
country, it really does pay tribute that 
your time here was well spent. And for 
Mr. WALDEN, it surely was, and, you 
know, maybe none more obvious than 
what we just saw yesterday. 
President Trump had a summit to 
talk about the rollout of a vaccine for 
COVID–19, a vaccine that came through 
work that we did in this Congress and 
the CARES Act to give money to the 
administration so that they could 
focus on finding a vaccine, but then it 
takes the ability, the tools. 
The FDA is the gold standard in the 
world. The FDA has had problems over 
the years, and this committee, the En-
ergy and Commerce Committee, has 
had to come together to address some 
of those problems so that FDA can con-
tinue to be the gold standard that not 
only ensures that the trials go through 
the proper process, because you don’t 
want a drug to come to market that 
has adverse consequences, but you also 
don’t want government to get in the 
way and slow down the ability for a 
drug that will save lives to go through 
years and years of bureaucracy, and 
that had been going on. 
When we were able to pass the bill to 
modernize FDA approval of drugs a few 
years ago when Mr. WALDEN was chair-
man, some of those reforms actually 
are what got us to the brink of an 
FDA-approved vaccine for COVID–19, 
and that will save millions of lives in 
America and around the world. You 
have seen people like the 90-year-old 
woman in Great Britain who is the 
first person to get the vaccine. That is 
from the work of what we did here at 
the FDA. 
FDA is on the verge of approving 
that vaccine in America, and it will 
also, in addition to saving lives, allow 
us to reopen our economy fully, and I 
think that is another objective we all 
have. 
That doesn’t happen by accident. It 
happened because of leadership. 
Again, without your leadership in re-
forming the FDA, we may be waiting 
years, not months, to get that vaccine 
to market. 
We had the SUPPORT Act to address 
the opioid crisis in this country. Every 
community 
in 
America 
had

touched by the opioid crisis, and Con-
gress had to take action. Again, work-
ing, Republicans and Democrats to-
gether, under your leadership as chair-
man, we did just that, and there are 
millions of lives that are saved because 
of that work. 
The FCC modernization and reau-
thorization, which typically happens, 
but when it was done in 2018, it was 
named after Ray Baum, who was the 
staffer who ran the Energy and Com-
merce Committee. I believe you all 
served together in the legislature. Un-
fortunately, we lost him, and to name 
that important piece of legislation 
after Ray Baum, I know, was not only 
important to keep the FCC going, but 
also to pay tribute to someone who 
came up here to do good public service 
for the country and did. 
Finally, the reauthorization was to 
free up spectrum. This has been a chal-
lenge for years as we worked to get 
more spectrum, which has improved 
everybody’s lives, to get to a 5G net-
work. 
That work was done, and the leader-
ship of Chairman WALDEN to get that 
done when even the scorekeepers here 
said it wouldn’t really produce any-
thing for the country, well, billions and 
billions of dollars later that this coun-
try has to pay down our debt came out 
of that legislation, as well as spectrum 
to allow us to get to a 5G network, 
spectrum to allow us to build up more 
rural broadband. 
All of the things that improve peo-
ple’s quality of life happened because 
of the leadership of Chairman WALDEN, 
during your time as chairman of the 
committee. You have earned the oppor-
tunity to go and enjoy the next phase 
of your life. 
But while you will be missed here, 
you leave a great legacy where you can 
point to the things you have done that 
make America a greater country, and 
for that, I thank you. I know all of us 
join in in applauding your time here in 
this great institution. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my dear friend 
and colleague from the Energy and 
Commerce Committee and the whip, 
the Republican whip of the House, for 
his overly generous comments, his fine 
leadership, and the fun we have had on 
the Energy and Commerce Committee. 
We do have a lot of fun there on both 
sides of the aisle, and then we do wres-
tle and tumble and we work things out, 
too. 
But Mr. SCALISE has always been a 
real warrior on the committee, an in-
credible fighter for what he believes in, 
an 
effective 
legislator, 
a 
terrific 
spokesperson. He has fallen down a lit-
tle bit, though, I must stipulate, in 
that he has failed to get me coffee in 
recent years. He has been otherwise 
consumed with other duties, and that 
will be noted in the historical record, I 
am sure. 
Mr. Speaker, I inquire how much 
time I have remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Oregon has 91⁄2 minutes re-
maining. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from Indiana (Mr. BUCSHON), 
whom we are glad to have back on the 
floor and looking well. 
Mr. BUCSHON. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. WAL-
DEN) for yielding me the time. 
Mr. Speaker, it is an honor and a 
privilege to call GREG WALDEN a col-
league and friend. His time as chair-
man of the House Energy and Com-
merce Committee is another chapter of 
accomplishment and success in the 
committee’s storied history. 
As chairman, GREG approached every 
issue before the committee with his 
eye on achieving results for the Amer-
ican people. That is why we are here. 
He strove to reach across the political 
divide, because he understood, and still 
does, our work on behalf of the Amer-
ican people is far too important to al-
ways be derailed by needless partisan-
ship. Of course, we will have our squab-
bles back and forth, but at the end of 
the day, it is about the American peo-
ple, and GREG understands that. 
From the SUPPORT for Patients and 
Communities Act to RAY BAUM’S Act, 
as well as too numerous bills signed 
into law to even list here, GREG’s lead-
ership of the Energy and Commerce 
Committee produced important legisla-
tion that is, today, making a difference 
in the lives of the American people. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to personally 
thank GREG for taking the time to 
bring me in and ask for my profes-
sional 
medical 
diagnosis 
of 
many 
major 
healthcare-related 
issues 
or 
other pieces of legislation before the 
committee. 
I know at times we doctors can tell 
you things you don’t want to hear—and 
quit laughing—but GREG
always lis-
tened intently and worked with me to 
help find a cure, so to speak, or a rem-
edy, and for that, I will always be ap-
preciative. 
GREG, your wisdom, charisma, and 
unflappable leadership will be greatly 
missed in the 117th Congress. 
I wish you and Mylene the best as 
you both begin this new chapter of 
your lives, and I look forward to con-
tinuing to call you friend. 
b 1330 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my 
friend and colleague, the good doctor 
from Indiana. We are so blessed in this 
institution to have people with such in-
credible backgrounds, intellect, capa-
bility, and just the overall human ex-
perience that they can bring to help us 
be better legislators and develop better 
policy. 
I think when we listen to each other, 
when we are challenged in our views 
and our ideas by each other, we end up 
with a better product for the American 
people, Mr. Speaker. 
Certainly, Dr. BUCSHON has been a 
forceful figure in trying to get to bet-
ter healthcare policy outcomes. I have 
greatly valued his counsel and his lead-
ership, and I know incredible things 
await him in the next Congress and in 
the years thereafter, where I hope he 
will continue to serve with great dis-
tinction, honor, and ability. 
Mr. Speaker, I don’t think I have 
anybody else on our side at this time, 
so I encourage passage of the legisla-
tion, the Tribal Power Act, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
support for the legislation and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5541, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
TIMELY REVIEW OF 
INFRASTRUCTURE ACT 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 1426) to amend the Department of 
Energy Organization Act to address in-
sufficient compensation of employees 
and other personnel of the Federal En-
ergy Regulatory Commission, and for 
other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows:

resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled,

the Commission in a timely, efficient, and 
effective manner, the Chairman may fix the

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Oregon (Mr. WALDEN) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and to 
include extraneous material on H.R. 
1426. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
1426, the Timely Review of Infrastruc-
ture Act. This bipartisan bill was in-
troduced by Representatives OLSON and 
DOYLE. I would like to thank both of 
them for their hard work on this bill. 
H.R. 1426 ensures that the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission, or 
FERC, has the resources and personnel 
it needs to review and analyze energy 
infrastructure projects. 
H.R. 1426 addresses insufficient com-
pensation of employees and other per-
sonnel by amending the Department of 
Energy Organization Act to grant the 
FERC Chairman additional authority 
to adjust compensation for a category 
of employees and other personnel with-
out regard to certain civil service laws. 
The Commission must be able to hire 
and retain sufficiently experienced em-
ployees so that complex and highly 
technical environmental reviews are 
conducted in as rigorous a manner as 
possible. Better staffing by the best 
and brightest people means better envi-
ronmental outcomes, better energy 
outcomes, and better outcomes for con-
sumers. 
I appreciate my colleagues’ hard 
work on this legislation. 
I particularly want to offer my best 
wishes to the sponsor of this bill, Rep-
resentative OLSON, who is retiring at 
the end of this Congress. I have always 
worked with him on a bipartisan basis 
and enjoy spending time with him be-
cause he has a real sense of humor. 
While we often disagree on policy, he 
has always been fair-minded and a man 
of his convictions. When he is with us, 
it is hard to imagine a better partner. 
That is particularly true regarding 
the work we have been doing with 
Chairman TONKO and many others from 
both parties on legislation to phase out 
the use of hydrofluorocarbons. He and 
his staff have been true leaders in 
pushing 
forward 
that 
legislation, 
which, if we can get it done, will be a 
major win for our manufacturers, our 
economy, and our environment. 
I thank the gentleman for his service 
to our committee and to our country. I 
wish you all the best in the next chap-
ter of your life, PETE, absolutely. 
I thank my colleagues for their ef-
forts and urge passage of the bill. I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
1426, the Timely Review of Infrastruc-
ture Act. This legislation was intro-
duced by my colleagues on the Energy 
and Commerce Committee, Representa-
tive PETE OLSON and Representative 
MIKE DOYLE, to help the Federal En-
ergy Regulatory Commission recruit 
and retain highly specialized personnel 
in the STEM fields. 
This legislation went through regular 
order, and it passed by vote voice in 
the committee. The Federal Energy 
Regulatory 
Commission, 
otherwise 
known as FERC, is an independent 
agency. Mr. Speaker, it regulates the 
interstate transmission of electricity, 
natural gas, and oil. 
FERC’s responsibilities also include 
reviewing and approving the siting of 
large-scale infrastructure projects such 
as LNG export terminals, electric 
transmission lines, interstate pipe-
lines, and all the associated environ-
mental and safety requirements. 
While FERC receives annual appro-
priations from Congress, FERC recov-
ers 100 percent of its appropriations 
through 
the 
collection 
of 
annual 
charges and filing fees. This unique 
structure, where the industry essen-
tially covers FERC’s costs, has re-
sulted in a lean and efficient agency, 
and it helps keep costs down for con-
sumers. 
In testimony before the Energy and 
Commerce Committee, FERC explained 
that it faces a growing challenge to re-
cruit and retain a highly skilled work-
force to keep up with the demands of

FERC has especially had difficulty 
hiring engineers throughout the agen-
cy, with many candidates citing com-
pensation rates as, frankly, the main 
issue. 
H.R. 1426 would improve FERC’s 
workforce by granting the Chairman 
authority to adjust compensation for a 
certain category of STEM workers. 
This fix would help FERC carry out its 
mission in a timely, efficient, and ef-
fective manner without any additional 
cost to our taxpayers. 
I want to thank Mr. OLSON and Mr. 
DOYLE for working together in a bipar-
tisan way, and I urge my colleagues to 
join me in supporting the legislation. I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no additional speakers on this side, so 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, before I 
yield to the author of the bill, the gen-
tleman from Texas, I can tell you, 
Texas has few stronger advocates, if 
any, than Mr. OLSON. And Texas 22, his 
congressional district, has had an in-
credibly effective voice in the United 
States Congress. 
He, like I, will be leaving at the end 
of this session, but he has left his mark 
on all kinds of positive policy improve-
ments in the Federal Government. 
Now, I don’t know about you, Mr. 
Speaker, but there probably aren’t 
many of us who could cite our friend’s 
district by number, but somehow Mr. 
OLSON, when you look at him, you 
know it is Texas 22, and you know 
about the Houston Astros. Now why, I 
don’t know. But that is a subject for 
another day. 
What I do know is, he has been an 
able and effective legislator on the En-
ergy and Commerce Committee in this 
House. He has served his country in 
many capacities, including in the mili-
tary. He will be missed in this assem-
bly, but his work will go on. His work 
today is noticed, once again, in a bipar-
tisan way. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he 
may consume to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. OLSON), although I do have 
another speaker. 
Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
chairman—my ranking member, my in-
spiration, Chairman GREG WALDEN—for 
his kind words and the time to speak 
about H.R. 1426, the Timely Review of 
Infrastructure Act. 
’Tis the season of giving. This bipar-
tisan bill gives three gifts to America 
and to the world. 
The first gift: We ensure that the 
American taxpayer gets the maximum 
value spent for the taxpayer dollars. 
The second gift: This grows Amer-
ica’s economy with high-paying, high- 
technology jobs. 
And number three: This addresses cli-
mate change by encouraging energy 
transportation 
through 
the 
safest, 
cleanest medium possible, pipelines 
above ships, trains, and trucks. 
H.R. 1426 is a commonsense bill. This 
is not new. It is modeled after Wall 
Street. When the market was booming 
in the 2000s, the private sector poached 
staff employees from the SEC. They 
threw dollar after dollar after dollar at 
these experts and got them to leave the 
public sector for the private sector. 
That meant that oversight was not the 
highest quality it had been before, and 
those reviews were longer and longer 
and longer. 
The same thing is happening right 
now in the current explosion of Amer-
ican energy. The agency is called 
FERC, as Mr. WALDEN mentioned, the 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commis-
sion. The private-sector big guys, the 
Big Oil guys, have told me point-blank 
that they poach on FERC to get the 
best employees they possibly can get. 
They wave money at them that FERC 
does not have to compete. 
When the SEC had their problems in 
the 2000s, we allowed them to tempo-
rarily raise the Federal employment 
cap to keep these SEC experts on the 
job in the SEC. 
H.R. 1426 does that same thing, a 
proven remedy for FERC: 1 year, high-
er salaries, and then a review. 
Every Member in this House, Demo-
crat or Republican, should vote for this 
bill because it is not just bipartisan. It 
is bipartisan on steroids. 
The lead Democrat, my good friend, 
MIKE DOYLE, is from Pittsburgh, Penn-
sylvania. In the NFL, that is Steelers 
country. I am from the suburbs of 
Houston. That was Houston Oilers 
country. Oilers fans have had a clash, a 
strong clash, with Steelers fans for 
over 40 years. And Pittsburgh fans have 
never apologized for a horrific, blown 
call that may have cost my Oilers a 
chance to go to their first Super Bowl. 
That still hurts today. 
My point is, if MIKE and I can put 
that difference aside and pass this bill, 
everyone in this entire body should 
come together and pass this bill. We all 
should vote for H.R. 1426. 
I have to close by speaking about our 
leader, my idol, GREG WALDEN. Like 
me, GREG is retiring after this year. 
Like me, GREG is not dying. He is just 
retiring. 
Let me give you a few examples of 
GREG’s guidance of this committee 
when he was the chairman. He empow-
ered every Member—Democrat, Repub-
lican, from any State—to have an 
amendment, to have their voices heard 
on the committee. 
The best example is, I recall a bill 
that sunset, sunrise, sunset—our bill to 
repeal and replace the Affordable Care 
Act. That markup went on for 27 hours 
because GREG WALDEN made sure every 
Member could have their amendment 
with a vote in that committee before it 
came to the House floor. 
Let me give you another great exam-
ple of GREG WALDEN building a team 
that always wins, that is always 
united. I am from Texas, a Republican. 
When I first got here, we had 25 Mem-
bers. At most times, we were together, 
but sometimes we split. 
GREG WALDEN has led the entire Or-
egon delegation GOP the whole time I 
have been here, and they have never, 
ever, ever had one defection with GREG 
WALDEN’s leadership. 
I will close with another Houston Oil-
ers’ quote from a great coach, Bum 
Phillips. 
If Bum came down from Heaven right 
now and was talking about GREG WAL-
DEN’s record and career here in the 
House 
throughout 
our 
history, 
he 
would say: GREG WALDEN may not be in 
a class by himself, but whatever class 
you are in, my friend, it doesn’t take 
long to call the roll. 
b 1345 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume to 
thank my dear friend and colleague, 
Mr. OLSON, who we all know, it turns 
out, is from Texas 22; and his wife, 
Nancy. I wish them the very best in 
their lives ahead. 
Mr. Speaker, since he is talking 
about a little history, I want to talk 
about a little history, too, before I turn 
to my friend from Georgia to speak on 
this bill, and that is that something 
really, really, really important hap-
pened not too far from my home State 
of Oregon. 
In Fort Lewis, Washington, on this 
date 58 years ago, this gentleman from 
Texas 22 arrived on this planet. Today 
is his birthday, and I hope the House 
will join me in acknowledging Mr. 
OLSON’s birthday. He was born in the 
great State of Washington, as it turns 
out, but he is Texas through and 
through. So happy birthday to Mr. 
OLSON. 
Mr. Speaker, I would turn now to the 
only pharmacist in the United States 
Congress, which has really been impor-
tant in our legislative efforts on the 
Energy and Commerce Committee. He 
knows so much about how to take care 
of people when they are at the counter, 
how to make sure they get what they 
need, and what they face when they 
come there in terms of costs of medi-
cines and everything else. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he 
may consume to the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. CARTER), who is a terrific 
member of the committee. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 1426, the Timely Review of In-
frastructure Act. Simply put, this is a 
commonsense bill to address how em-
ployees are commended for their work 
at the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission, or FERC. 
It is well known that there is a back-
log of work at FERC due to a shortage 
of qualified personnel to handle the re-
quirements. When energy developers 
need to submit applications for ap-
proval at FERC, they are often delayed 
due to a lack of available personnel to 
review the project. 
The 
United 
States 
has 
finally 
reached a level of energy independence 
that we could never have dreamed of 
during the OPEC oil embargo. How-
ever, that development is often subject

to the timeliness and availability of 
approvals at FERC. This bill will en-
sure that the retention and recruiting 
of people at FERC will remain highly 
competitive, bringing in the people 
they need to do the job. 
One area of serious concern was the 
number of pending LNG applications 
waiting at FERC. Thankfully, we have 
a bipartisan bill that can turn things 
around. 
I thank my good friend from Texas 
22, PETE OLSON, who is, unfortunately, 
leaving this body after years of distin-
guished service. But this is a good way 
to reflect on all of his great work. We 
will miss my friend from Texas, and I 
do wish him well. 
Also, I thank my colleagues on the 
Energy and Commerce Committee for 
their work on this important legisla-
tion. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this legislation. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I don’t 
believe I have any other speakers on 
my side of the aisle on this measure. I 
urge its passage, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
support for the legislation, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that today the 
House will consider the Timely Review of In-
frastructure Act introduced by Representative 
PETE OLSON of Texas and myself. I would like 
to thank Mr. OLSON for his leadership and 
partnership on this bill and commend him and 
his staff on their tireless efforts to get it across 
the finish line. 
The United States has always been a global 
leader when it comes to energy development 
and that is just a true today as it has ever 
been. However, in order to maintain and grow 
our energy sector, we need to ensure that we 
are building the necessary energy infrastruc-
ture to do so. Investing in our domestic infra-
structure is more important than ever as we 
look to get through the current health crisis 
and rebuild our economy. 
Indeed, just as we passed the Water Re-
sources Development Act yesterday, today we 
have an opportunity to pass a bill that, while 
smaller in scale, will help hasten the buildout 
of critical energy infrastructure such as hydro-
electric dams, pipelines, transmission equip-
ment, and energy terminals. This will not only 
help the economy recover but will ensure that 
we have a secure and strong domestic energy 
system. 
Unfortunately, too many energy infrastruc-
ture projects are delayed or do not have as 
vigorous a review as you would expect. And 
that is due to the fact that the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission, which is responsible 
for reviewing proposed projects cannot hire or 
retain enough qualified engineers for the sim-
ple reason that salaries in the private sector 
are too high for FERC to compete with given 
its current pay scale limits. This lack of engi-
neers not only doesn’t allow FERC to fully and 
robustly do its work, but it is a barrier to com-
munities benefiting from the good paying jobs 
the construction of these projects provides. 
If we want FERC to ensure that the projects 
that come up for review, now and in the fu-
ture, are stringently but quickly reviewed, then 
we must make the pay for the engineers who 
review the applications more competitive. That 
is exactly what the Timely Review of Infra-
structure Act would do, by allowing FERC to 
offer higher salaries for these high demand 
engineering positions, ensuring that critical in-
frastructure projects can get the review and 
approval they need to move forward. 
The bill has bipartisan and bicameral sup-
port and FERC Chairman Chatterjee has stat-
ed his support for this legislation saying that it 
would enhance the Commission’s ability to re-
cruit and compensate the skilled staff needed 
to lessen the backlog of projects awaiting re-
view and to review future projects in a more 
timely manner. 
Our bill would not only help get rid of the 
backlog of projects currently awaiting review, 
but would allow FERC to have the proper staff 
in place as we build out a sustainable energy 
system. I view it as an important piece of get-
ting our economy back on track and ensuring 
that America remains the leader in energy pro-
duction and innovation that it has been. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1426. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
CEILING FAN IMPROVEMENT ACT 
OF 2020 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 5758) to amend the Energy Policy 
and Conservation Act to make tech-
nical corrections to the energy con-
servation standard for ceiling fans, and 
for other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 5758 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Ceiling Fan 
Improvement Act of 2020’’. 
SEC. 2. MODIFICATIONS TO THE CEILING FAN EN-
ERGY CONSERVATION STANDARD. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 325(ff)(6) of the 
Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 
U.S.C. 6295(ff)(6)) is amended by adding at 
the end the following: 
‘‘(C)(i) Large-diameter ceiling fans manu-
factured on or after January 21, 2020, shall— 
‘‘(I) not be required to meet minimum ceil-
ing fan efficiency in terms of ratio of the 
total airflow to the total power consumption 
as described in the final rule titled ‘Energy 
Conservation Program: Energy Conservation 
Standards for Ceiling Fans’ (82 Fed. Reg. 6826 
(January 19, 2017)); and 
‘‘(II) have a CFEI greater than or equal 
to— 
‘‘(aa) 1.00 at high speed; and 
‘‘(bb) 1.31 at 40 percent speed or the nearest 
speed that is not less than 40 percent speed. 
‘‘(ii) For purposes of this subparagraph, the 
term ‘CFEI’ means the Fan Energy Index for 
large-diameter ceiling fans, calculated in ac-
cordance with ANSI/AMCA Standard 208–18 
titled ‘Calculation of the Fan Energy Index’, 
with the following modifications: 
‘‘(I) Using an Airflow Constant (Q0) of 
26,500 cubic feet per minute. 
‘‘(II) Using a Pressure Constant (P0) of 
0.0027 inches water gauge. 
‘‘(III) Using a Fan Efficiency Constant (η0) 
of 42 percent.’’. 
(b) REVISION.—For purposes of section 
325(m) of the Energy Policy and Conserva-
tion Act (42 U.S.C. 6295(m)), the standard es-
tablished in section 325(ff)(6)(C) of such Act 
(as added by subsection (a) of this section) 
shall be treated as if such standard was 
issued on January 19, 2017. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Oregon (Mr. WALDEN) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 5758. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
5758, the Ceiling Fan Improvement Act 
of 2020. This bipartisan bill was intro-
duced by Representative GUTHRIE
of 
Kentucky and Representative SCHA-
KOWSKY of Illinois, both senior mem-
bers of the Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee. 
H.R. 5758 amends the Energy Policy 
and Conservation Act to provide a 
technical fix for large-diameter ceiling 
fan efficiency standards. The legisla-
tion adjusts compliance requirements 
related to total airflow and power con-
sumptions for these fans. This tech-
nical fix provides the highest-airflow 
fans a path to compliance, while still 
requiring improvements to products 
that underperform. This is a common-
sense change that will improve effi-
ciency of large-diameter ceiling fans 
and ensure that all products will be-
come efficient over time. 
Mr. Speaker, energy efficiency is a 
critical tool in our efforts to address 
climate change, while also saving con-
sumers money on their electric bills. 
Residential and commercial buildings 
contribute nearly 40 percent to our Na-
tion’s carbon pollution, and energy ef-
ficiency measures can reduce U.S. en-
ergy use and greenhouse gas emissions 
by 50 percent by 2050. 
It is crucial that we support energy 
efficiency efforts across different sec-
tors. I commend my colleagues for 
their bipartisan work on this impor-
tant bill. Ms. SCHAKOWSKY, in par-
ticular, who chairs our subcommittee 
that deals with consumer protection is 
always looking to not only improve ef-
ficiency, but also consumer protec-
tions.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7075 
December 9, 2020 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
5758, the Ceiling Fan Improvement Act. 
This legislation was introduced by my 
colleagues on the Energy and Com-
merce 
Committee, 
Representatives 
GUTHRIE
and SCHAKOWSKY, to make 
technical corrections to the Depart-
ment of Energy’s energy conservation 
standard 
for 
large-diameter 
ceiling 
fans. This legislation did go through 
regular order and it did pass the full 
committee on a voice vote. 
H.R. 5758 would amend the Energy 
Policy and Conservation Act to adjust 
compliance requirements, and that will 
resolve a discrepancy in the regula-
tions that may have the unintended 
consequence of allowing some large-di-
ameter fans with low airflows to meet 
the minimum standards. The Depart-
ment of Energy confirmed the need for 
a statutory revision and submitted 
technical assistance to aid in the draft-
ing of this legislation, which we are ap-
preciative of. 
This is a good bipartisan bill, like the 
others before it today, and I urge my 
colleagues to join me in supporting it. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as she may consume to the 
gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. SCHA-
KOWSKY), who chairs our Subcommittee 
on Digital Commerce and Consumer 
Protection. 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I 
also thank Representative GUTHRIE, 
who cosponsored this legislation with 
me, and also Chairman PALLONE and 
Chairman BOBBY RUSH for their help in 
moving this bill forward. 
This is a bipartisan bill that provides 
an important fix to an energy con-
servation rule for ceiling fans that the 
Department of Energy finalized in Jan-
uary 2017. 
However, minor technical changes to 
the rule were needed in order to pre-
vent a major unintended consequence. 
Without this bill, some of the most en-
ergy-efficient, large-diameter ceiling 
fans would have to be taken off the 
market in the United States. So we 
fixed that. 
The bill will also provide consistent 
labeling requirements for residential 
ceiling fans and simplify the ENERGY 
STAR program. Both of these changes 
will make it easier for Americans to 
choose the right products for their 
homes. Representative GUTHRIE and I 
worked together with ceiling fan man-
ufacturers, the energy efficiency com-
munity, and other stakeholders to clar-
ify the standard. The Department of 
Energy was consulted throughout the 
drafting process. 
What pleases me really the most 
about this legislation is that it high-
lights how we need legislation, big and 
small, to tackle the climate crisis. 
This bill also highlights how we can 
work together across the aisle to enact 
commonsense policies that directly im-
pact energy usage in homes and save 
American families money on their en-
ergy bill at the same time. 
Mr. Speaker, I look forward to con-
tinuing to work together with my Re-
publican colleagues in the next Con-
gress. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, it is a 
great privilege now to recognize the 
gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. GUTH-
RIE), who is the top Republican on the 
Oversight 
and 
Investigations 
Sub-
committee and has really done incred-
ible work as we put together our pack-
age on Operation Warp Speed and the 
second wave issues involving COVID, 
which I recommend to my colleagues 
to take a look at. He is also a great 
legislator in working out bipartisan 
issues like this. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as 
he may consume to the gentleman 
from Kentucky (Mr. GUTHRIE). 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support today of my bill (H.R. 5758), the 
Ceiling Fan Improvement Act. 
In January 2017, the Department of 
Energy finalized energy conservation 
standards for ceiling fans that, unfor-
tunately, did not account for the dif-
ferent airflow dynamics of large ceiling 
fans. 
Under the current regulations, some 
of the most efficient large-diameter 
fans would have to be taken off the 
market in the U.S. 
The Ceiling Fan Improvement Act is 
a bipartisan, commonsense bill that 
will ensure large-diameter fans are 
properly regulated. Technical innova-
tion and new products will be key to 
improving energy efficiency and pro-
tecting our environment for genera-
tions to come, and the Ceiling Fan Im-
provement Act seeks to ensure that 
high-performing, large-diameter ceil-
ing fans can remain on the market and 
help achieve real energy savings. 
I thank Congresswoman Jan Scha-
kowsky for working with me on this 
bill. I appreciate all the efforts she 
made to work with me and work to-
gether. I encourage my colleagues to 
support this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, while on the floor, I 
want to make some comments about 
some of our colleagues who are leaving. 
Mr. Speaker, first, we are hallway 
roommates 
in 
the 
Rayburn 
Office 
Building. I will miss seeing you. Con-
gratulations on where you are going. 
You are retiring. It has been a pleas-
ure. Your staff is fantastic. Every time 
I walk by and pop my head in and say 
hello to them, they are always very 
gracious. So we are going to miss you 
guys. 
Elected with me in 2008—PETE OLSON 
was just recognized on the floor; fare-
well to him—when we first got elected 
to Congress, we were together in a new 
Member orientation. We were chatting 
with each other, and I think he said 
that he was born in Fort Lewis, Wash-
ington. We know he is Texas through 
and through, but he also had a sojourn 
in Alabama. We were talking, and I 
said: I was born in Alabama. 
And he said: Well, I used to live in 
Alabama. 
I said: I was born in Florence, Ala-
bama. 
Some of you may know Muscle 
Shoals is where some of the world’s 
greatest music is from. That is where I 
was from. 
He said: Well, I lived in Florence for 
a year. 
I said: I lived in the Forest Hills 
neighborhood. 
He said: I lived in the Forest Hills 
neighborhood. Did you ever know a Mr. 
McCugh? 
I said: He was the kind of dad who 
was involved in everybody’s lives. Yes, 
he was my Little League coach. 
He said: He was my Little League 
coach. 
I looked at him, and I said: You are 
little PETEY OLSON? 
So PETE OLSON and I come together 
to Congress in 2008 and found out we 
knew each other when we were kids. 
His dad worked for Champion, a big 
paper mill that went on to Houston. 
I would also like to say that the 
Houston Oilers now play 1 hour from 
my home in Nashville. So we are proud 
to have them. I hope he still cheers for 
them in Nashville. 
But what was interesting is we just 
said he is a year older, and I have never 
said this on the floor, but I would like 
to say this now: He is a year older than 
I, as his birthday is today. We had the 
same second grade teacher. 
He said: Did you have Mrs. LeCates? 
I said: I had Mrs. LeCates. 
The story about Mrs. LeCates is that 
from the time summer was out that 
PETE OLSON left and before school com-
menced that I went into second grade 
with Mrs. LeCates, something momen-
tous that summer happened in her life. 
Her son, Second Lieutenant Robert 
LeCates, was killed in Vietnam. It is 
really the only name I personally know 
on the wall when I go. You have heard 
of people and you have different names 
you know and you hear stories about, 
but he is the only person I had a per-
sonal connection to. So every time I go 
to the wall, I have told him that. I 
said: Every time I go to the wall, I look 
at Robert LeCates, and I look at his 
name. 
It reminds me to this day that there 
are people who sacrifice their lives for 
us to be here and for us to do what we 
are doing, and we need to conduct our-
selves worthy of people who gave the 
ultimate sacrifice for that. So that was 
our story. 
But I just want to close with talking 
about our former chairman and rank-
ing member, GREG WALDEN, and wish 
him well in his retirement. He is out-
standing to work with, 
just 
out-
standing to work with. No matter what 
the subcommittee, he knew the policy, 
he knew what was going on, and he had 
his handle on it. But he also let us go

bill, trying to address that. It has been 
a plague on my State like it has been 
on so many others. 
He really gave people freedom to 
bring the best ideas and put all the 
best ideas together with both sides. He 
could always compromise without com-
promising his values and his principles. 
He said: If there is a way for both sides 
to win, let’s find a way for both sides to 
win. 
Mr. Speaker, I know the gentleman 
has yielded me as much time as I may 
consume. If I consumed everything to 
say what is good about you and the 
value you are to this institution, I 
would be here all afternoon because 
you have really made an impact on this 
institution. You have made an impact 
upon our conference. 
I think people on both sides of the 
aisle have said your service here has 
made a difference, not for Congress, 
but through your service in Congress 
and for the country, and I thank you 
for that. We are going to miss you, and 
I wish you Godspeed as you move for-
ward.

Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no additional speakers on this side, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself a minute or so here to thank 
my friend, the gentleman from Ken-
tucky (Mr. GUTHRIE) who, as you all 
know, is a terrific legislator, a bright 
mind. And he, too, has served his coun-
try with distinction in uniform and 
here in the Congress, and he will have 
a great future going forward in this in-
stitution. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he 
may consume to the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. CARTER). 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 5758, the Ceiling Fan Improve-
ment Act. This legislation will update 
the energy efficiency standards for 
ceiling fans manufactured after Janu-
ary 21 of this year. 
We are here today because the exist-
ing energy and efficiency standards for 
ceiling fans was insufficient to meet 
the characteristics of ceiling fans being 
manufactured. 
Specifically, the energy conservation 
standards finalized in January 2017 
didn’t properly account for the dif-
ferent types of air flow of large ceiling 
fans. Therefore, the result of not 
changing this law could be the removal 
of large ceiling fans from the market 
because they won’t be in compliance. 
This issue is a great example of how 
now nuanced and challenging some of 
these issues and topics can be here in 
Congress. Thanks to the leadership of 
my good friend, Congressman GUTHRIE, 
and that of Chairwoman SCHAKOWSKY, 
we are now one step closer to getting 
this fix across the finish line. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues 
on the Committee on Energy and Com-
merce for their work on this legislation 
and for the bipartisan efforts to get it 
here, and I urge all of my colleagues to 
support this legislation. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
other speakers on my side of the aisle. 
It is good legislation, bipartisan. It 
should become law. I urge its passage, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I would 
urge support for this legislation, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5758. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, on that 
I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3 of House Resolution 
965, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this question are 
postponed. 
f 
MEDICAL MARIJUANA RESEARCH 
ACT 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 3797) to amend the Controlled 
Substances Act to make marijuana ac-
cessible for use by qualified marijuana 
researchers for medical purposes, and 
for other purposes, as amended.

medical benefits, any gaps in research, and 
any impacts of Federal restrictions and pol-
icy on research, marijuana should be trans-
ferred to a schedule other than schedule I (if 
marijuana has not been so transferred al-
ready). 
SEC. 6. PRODUCTION QUOTAS FOR MARIJUANA 
GROWN

SEC. 9. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EF-
FECTS. 
The budgetary effects of this Act, for the 
purpose of complying with the Statutory 
Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be deter-
mined by reference to the latest statement 
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in 
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Oregon (Mr. WALDEN) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 3797. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 3797, the Medical Marijuana Re-
search Act. In recent years, including 
in this most recent election cycle, 
many States have taken action to 
allow cannabis use. While States are 
moving ahead with this action, there is 
a significant need for more research 
about the use of cannabis products in 
these States and the safety of products 
on the shelves. 
According to the National Conference 
of State Legislators, 36 States, as well 
as Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin 
Islands, and the District of Columbia 
have approved medical cannabis pro-
grams, while 15 States, the District of 
Columbia, Guam, and the Northern 
Mariana Islands have approved adult- 
use cannabis. This is a major shift in 
cannabis policy, and the United States 
is not the only one making these 
changes. 
Just last week, in a vote by the 
United Nations Commission on Nar-
cotic Drugs, the body acknowledged 
the medicinal and therapeutic poten-
tial of cannabis and removed it from 
the most restrictive classification cat-
egory. While still voicing a need for 
control, the United States voted in 
favor of this move, stating that the le-
gitimate medical use of cannabis has 
been established through scientific re-
search. 
Unfortunately, American researchers 
seeking to study the products widely 
available and used by consumers in 
these States and territories face re-
strictions and numerous hurdles cre-
ated by U.S. Federal policy. It is time 
we break through this catch-22. This 
bipartisan bill begins to address this 
issue by reducing barriers to cannabis 
research. 
In January, the Committee on En-
ergy and Commerce heard from Federal 
officials about the difficulty research-
ers face when it comes to conducting 
research with cannabis. As an example, 
for years, there has been only one 
source of marijuana made available by 
the University of Mississippi that can 
be used in the U.S. for research pur-
poses. Another difficulty is that the 
current Federal registration require-
ments can be time-consuming and add 
unique and additional responsibilities 
than what is required for other types of 
medical research. 
The Council on Governmental Rela-
tions, an association of research uni-
versities and other entities, says that 
this more cumbersome process often 
requires 6 to 12 months to complete. 
In testimony before our committee 
on this bill, Dr. Nora Volkow, who is 
the director of the National Institute 
on Drug Abuse, underscored this point. 
She testified that barriers in the cur-
rent process ‘‘present challenges to ad-
vancing cannabis research.’’ As a re-
sult, she said, we have a gap in our un-
derstanding of cannabis products on 
health. 
Mr. Speaker, now this bill, H.R. 3797, 
addresses some of these barriers by 
streamlining the registration process 
for those who want to advance can-
nabis research. The bill does this while 
still maintaining appropriate oversight 
from both the Department of Health 
and Human Services and the Drug En-
forcement Administration. 
This bill also requires HHS and DEA 
to act within specified time periods to 
ensure 
timely 
registration 
for 
re-
searchers, and it encourages additional 
manufacturers and distributors to sup-
ply cannabis for purposes of research. 
This will diversify the range of prod-
ucts and make it easier for legitimate 
researchers to obtain products that 
better reflect the changing cannabis 
landscape. 
Mr. Speaker, finally, the bill would 
also promote research on cannabis 
products available through State-au-
thorized programs. This additional re-
search is critical if we are to better un-
derstand the benefits and risks of can-
nabis products available in State mar-
kets today and most frequently used by 
consumers. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the lead spon-
sors of this bipartisan legislation, Rep-
resentatives 
BLUMENAUER, 
HARRIS, 
LOFGREN, GRIFFITH, BISHOP, and DIN-
GELL, and their staffs, for their tireless 
work. I also thank the committee staff 
for their hard work, as well as the staff 
for both HHS and DEA for their tech-
nical assistance. 
Mr. Speaker, again, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill. I hope the 
Senate will act on it swiftly, and I re-
serve the balance of my time.

Sincerely, 
JERROLD NADLER, 
Chairman. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express 
my support of H.R. 3797, the Medical 
Marijuana Research Act introduced by 
my colleague and friend from Oregon, 
Representative BLUMENAUER, my friend 
from Maryland, Representative ANDY 
HARRIS, among others. 
I am sort of surprised we aren’t tak-
ing this up at 4:20 in the afternoon 
rather than 2:10, but we will let history 
deal with that. 
Mr. Speaker, Federally sanctioned 
research on marijuana is incredibly 
challenging. It is a schedule I con-
trolled substance under the Controlled 
Substances 
Act, 
meaning 
that 
re-
searchers seeking to investigate a drug 
have to work with the Department of 
Health and Human Services and the 
Drug Enforcement Administration to 
meet certain Federal requirements in 
order to conduct that research. 
In addition, international obligations 
outlined in the United Nations drug 
control treaties impose requirements 
that impact the supply of research- 
grade cannabis. Currently, those con-
ducting federally-sanctioned research 
can only study marijuana that is 
sourced through the National Institute 
on Drug Abuse’s single DEA licensee: 
the University of Mississippi. 
Unfortunately, 
that 
marijuana 
is 
chemically distinct from what is com-
mercially available from State-legal 
dispensaries, such as in my home State 
of Oregon. 
What does that mean? 
Well, it means that we have little to 
no data on the actual health impacts of 
products in States that have legalized 
cannabis for medical or recreational 
use. 
States that have pursued marijuana 
legalization have largely done so in an 
information vacuum, with less under-
standing of what it does than virtually 
any nutritional supplement currently 
on the market, and with far less infor-
mation than they have on legal sub-
stances that are easily abused, such as 
alcohol or tobacco. We don’t even know 
at what point it is unsafe for mari-
juana users to drive. The THC levels 
that States have set for driving legal 
limits or for purposes of food consump-
tion are simply arbitrary. 
Mr. Speaker, in Oregon, for example, 
cookies infused with THC are limited 
to 5 milligrams of THC per serving, or 
50 milligrams per package. Now, you go 
across the Columbia River to the great 
State of Washington, and their limit is 
10 milligrams or 100 milligrams. So 
there is little to no scientific evidence 
to support either of these levels. We 
simply don’t know. 
Mr. Speaker, here is what we do 
know: There have been increases in 
cannabis-related poison control center 
calls, emergency room visits, and im-
paired driving incidents. Nationwide 
exposure in youth is increasing, with 
record numbers of 8th through 12th 
graders regularly vaping marijuana 
products. 
So we need research that reflects the 
reality of what is on the market. Prod-
ucts containing CBD derived from the 
hemp plant have become commonplace 
across the country in pharmacies and 
health food stores, and even in fast 
food chains since hemp was removed 
from the CSA in the 2018 farm bill. 
Now, these products often contain 
claims that they can effectively treat 
everything from depression and inflam-
mation to cancer or Alzheimer’s. How-
ever, none of these claims have been 
evaluated or approved by the FDA, 
meaning patients may be relying on 
the unsubstantiated claims of CBD 
products and foregoing other proven 
medical treatments. 
Mr. Speaker, like cannabis, while 
there is potential for CBD to provide 
patient benefits, the research and 
science lag far behind the market and 
the agencies are simply struggling to 
catch up. Last week, the majority 
forced this Chamber to vote on the 
MORE Act, which completely removed 
marijuana from the list of scheduled 
substances under the Controlled Sub-
stances Act—among many other things 
in that bill—and they didn’t have the 
data to justify this policy decision. 
Not only was this legislation incred-
ibly premature, it could also poten-
tially put the U.S. in violation of inter-
national treaty obligations. Any dis-
cussion of de-scheduling must be pre-
ceded by a fuller understanding of the 
potential risks associated with can-
nabis use, which we currently do not 
have. And the current research restric-
tions on fully studying cannabis have 
effectively created a catch-22 in the re-
scheduling debate. 
So evaluations by the FDA and the 
National Academies have both con-
cluded that the lack of research is a 
significant factor in denying previous 
administrative rescheduling petitions. 
More research, better data, remain the 
critical first steps to any future policy 
discussions. Making it easier to re-
search cannabis is common ground 
that I think we can all agree upon and 
pursue together. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues, 
and especially Representatives HARRIS 
and BLUMENAUER, for working tire-
lessly to bring us this bipartisan, com-
monsense legislation. This bill will 
help improve the marijuana research 
landscape and give consumers the in-
formation they need. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on 
this measure, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I want 
to thank the gentleman from Oregon. 
He has really been out front in edu-
cating me, in particular, and so many 
of us, on the cannabis issue. I think 
without him, we would not see many 
States like my own leaning towards le-
galization. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman from Oregon (Mr. BLU-
MENAUER), the prime sponsor of the 
bill. 
b 1415 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the gentleman’s kind com-
ments and cooperation. Working with 
the ranking member, working with Dr. 
HARRIS, we made real progress here. 
Mr. Speaker, the cannabis laws in 
this country are broken, especially 
those that deal with research. It is ille-
gal everywhere in America to drive 
under the influence of alcohol, can-
nabis, or any other substance. But we 
do not have a good test for impairment 
because we can’t study it. Now, Dr. 
HARRIS and I don’t necessarily agree on 
the efficacy of cannabis, but we agree 
that this is insane and that we need to 
change it. 
At a time when there are 4 million 
registered medical cannabis patients, 
and many more who self-medicate, 
when there are 91 percent of Americans 
supporting medical cannabis, it is time 
to change the system. Our bill will do 
precisely that. We have a broad coali-
tion of Members and organizations who 
support the bill, including those who 
do have concerns about cannabis. 
Specifically, the bill will tackle two 
main issues: research licensing and 
manufacturing. For manufacturers, it 
requires the DEA to license outside of 
the NIDA monopoly so we can study 
the products Americans are using. For 
researchers, it shortens the timelines, 
reduces unnecessary security meas-
ures, and streamlines approval.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7080 
December 9, 2020 
This bill will not only reduce barriers 
to medical research but all cannabis 
research. It is a narrow bill that fixes 
one of many broken cannabis laws. 
I want to hasten to add that this in 
no way negates the need to move for-
ward with other areas of legislation, 
like we did with the MORE Act. But 
this is sort of a foundational question. 
No matter where you are, there is no 
reason the Federal Government should 
impede this critical research. 
One of the most moving moments I 
have had in the last 2 years working on 
this issue was in the backyard of a con-
stituent in southeast Portland who 
brought together a half dozen families 
with children with extreme seizure dis-
order. The only thing that stopped 
those babies from being tortured was 
medical cannabis. They had to research 
it themselves. They had to formulate it 
themselves. 
At Oregon Health and Science Uni-
versity, they told me: This works. We 
know it works. We could go to the 
street corner and buy something, but 
we legally can’t do it. 
Listening to those heartbreaking sto-
ries of the families, of what they had to 
do—they crossed their fingers. It sort 
of worked for them. But no family 
should have to do that. 
We ought to get the Federal obsta-
cles out of the way of simple, common-
sense research. It will make a dif-
ference for families across the country. 
We need to move forward, so there is 
no unnecessary dispute about cannabis, 
and get the job done. 
SUPPORT THE MEDICAL MARIJUANA RESEARCH 
ACT 
DEAR COLLEAGUE: We write to encourage 
you to cosponsor our bill, the Medical Mari-
juana Research Act (H.R. 3797). Regardless of 
your stance on marijuana, we can all agree 
that there should not be onerous federal bar-
riers to conduct research and access objec-
tive evidence as to the medicinal properties 
of marijuana. 
Although more than two-thirds of Ameri-
cans are living in states with legal mari-
juana programs, current federal law greatly 
limits researchers’ ability to research this 
drug. This includes the overly burdensome 
registration process, redundant protocol re-
views, lack of adequate research material 
and unnecessarily onerous security require-
ments. In fact, a 2017 National Academies of 
Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine report 
found that ‘‘research on the health effects of 
cannabis and cannabinoids has been limited 
in the United States, leaving patients, 
health care professionals, and policy makers 
without the evidence they need to make 
sound decisions regarding the use of can-
nabis and cannabinoids. This lack of evi-
dence-based information on the health ef-
fects of cannabis and cannabinoids poses a 
public health risk.’’ We could not agree 
more. 
The Medical Marijuana Research Act will 
reduce many of the barriers to conducting le-
gitimate medical marijuana research. First, 
the bill streamlines the burdensome and 
often duplicative licensure process for re-
searchers seeking to conduct marijuana re-
search, while still maintaining all necessary 
safeguards against misuse and abuse. Sec-
ond, it addresses the woefully inadequate, 
both in quantity and quality, supply of med-
ical-grade marijuana available for use in 
such research. Finally, it requires, within 
five years of enactment, a report by the sec-
retary of the U.S. Department of Health and 
Human Services on the status and results of 
the then-available body of research on mari-
juana. 
Irrespective of where one falls on the ideo-
logical spectrum with respect to further le-
galization, we can all agree that the Amer-
ican people deserve to know what’s going on 
with marijuana. The United States leads the 
world in biomedical research. It is therefore 
unconscionable that the federal government 
stands as the chief impediment to legitimate 
medical research that will ensure American 
physicians, patients, purchasers, and con-
stituents have access to the information 
they need to make an informed decision 
about marijuana. 
Sincerely, 
EARL BLUMENAUER, 
Member of Congress. 
ANDY HARRIS, M.D., 
Member of Congress. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. HARRIS), who has been a real 
leader on this and so many other 
healthcare-related issues. 
Mr. HARRIS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
you for your concern about addiction 
and all the problems. This is an ancil-
lary problem that deals with that. I 
thank you for your concern about that. 
I thank the chairman of the com-
mittee and the ranking member. This 
has been years in the making. I thank 
them for bringing this across the finish 
line. 
I thank my cosponsor from across 
the aisle. The gentleman from Oregon 
is absolutely right. He and I will dis-
agree, probably the most two people 
can disagree, about recreational mari-
juana. We agree 100 percent that we 
need to do this research and that we 
need this bill. 
Now, because of the discussion about 
COVID and the vaccines and thera-
peutics for that, Americans realize how 
medical research has to be done and 
how important it is to be done. They 
expect purity, safety, and efficacy for 
anything that has a claim of a medical 
product. 
Now, unfortunately, because of the 
public policy we have had in place with 
marijuana and its scheduling, this sim-
ply couldn’t be done. The unfortunate 
consequence is that legislatures in gen-
eral across the States, and, unfortu-
nately, this legislature last week, took 
a ready-fire-aim approach: Let’s go 
ahead and legalize it, even for rec-
reational use, without a medical basis. 
But I am only going to talk about 
medical marijuana. We need good stud-
ies. Understandably, because of current 
scheduling, we can’t do it. I get it. I did 
research, as a physician, on drugs. You 
can’t do it under the current sched-
uling, but we need to do the research. 
As the chairman pointed out, Dr. 
Volkow, who has appeared before our 
committee many times, has said that 
the claims of medical usefulness are 
simply greatly exaggerated because we 
don’t have the science. Many claims 
are made; very few are proven. 
We don’t tolerate that for other 
medications. We certainly don’t tol-
erate it for COVID vaccines and thera-
peutics. We shouldn’t tolerate it for 
medical marijuana. This research just 
simply hasn’t been done, for a variety 
of reasons, most of which get cured by 
this bill. 
Now, could medical marijuana be 
useful for PTSD for my fellow vet-
erans? Absolutely. It might be useful. 
We have no idea. 
What we have done is, instead, the 
public press has said it is useful for 
PTSD. That is not the way we treat 
medicine in this country. We actually 
do the research. Our veterans deserve 
for us to do this research. 
It couldn’t be done, because of the 
scheduling, because of the rules—the 
rules, by the way, that Congress made. 
This is on us. We shouldn’t have taken 
so long to get to this point. 
Could it be useful for non-neurogenic 
chronic pain? Yes, it might be, but I 
don’t know. The last thing we should 
do to our chronic pain patients, as you 
know, Mr. Speaker, because of the 
problems with treating chronic pain, is 
make false promises to them about 
something. 
If this works for it, oh, my gosh, that 
is great. We have a potential solution 
for part of our addiction problem. If it 
doesn’t work, those people deserve to 
know. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
TRONE). The time of the gentleman has 
expired. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
an additional 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Maryland (Mr. HARRIS). 
Mr. HARRIS. Mr. Speaker, is it use-
ful for that group? Is CBD useful for 
that group of pediatric patients with 
seizures? Yes, it sure is. Is it useful for 
people with glaucoma? Yes, it sure is. 
Is it useful for spasticity with multiple 
sclerosis? Yes, it sure is. 
But there are 40 or 50 other claims 
that we don’t know about. We deserve 
to know about it. Those claims are 
simply not founded on science. 
Look, let’s do the science. Let’s see 
what medical marijuana is useful for. 
As a physician, anything it is useful 
for, I want to provide for patients. 
Let’s do the science. Let’s pass H.R. 
3797. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Mrs. DINGELL), one of our 
colleagues on the committee. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of the Medical Mari-
juana 
Research 
Act, 
which 
would 
streamline outdated bureaucratic bar-
riers 
and 
Federal 
roadblocks 
pre-
venting legitimate medical research 
into the impacts of medical marijuana. 
I, too, like my colleague, thank you 
for your leadership. I have a healthy 
fear of drugs, having lost a sister to a 
drug overdose, but there is just too 
much information we do not have. 
We have seen dramatic changes in 
the legal status of marijuana at the 
State level. Almost 1 year ago to the 
day, sales of recreational marijuana 
began in my home State of Michigan.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7081 
December 9, 2020 
Following multiple successful State 
ballot initiatives last month, medical 
marijuana is now legal in 36 States. 
However, the Federal framework for 
conducting marijuana research is dec-
ades old and has not kept pace with 
these changes. 
Currently, as has been said by my 
other colleagues, scientists in the 
United States looking to conduct re-
search on marijuana must contend 
with a heavy-handed, duplicative reg-
istration and licensure process that 
doesn’t work. They are limited to using 
marijuana grown at a single location 
overseen by the National Institute on 
Drug Abuse at the University of Mis-
sissippi. 
Collectively, this regulatory red tape 
greatly limits our understanding of the 
health impacts of marijuana and pre-
vents qualified researchers from engag-
ing in further study. 
We are driving cars that NHTSA 
can’t do the research they need to do 
about people driving while smoking. 
We should know that. 
The Medical Marijuana Research Act 
will streamline this cumbersome proc-
ess by preventing bureaucratic road-
blocks on marijuana research registra-
tion applications. It will also direct the 
FDA to issue guidelines on the produc-
tion of marijuana and ensure that ade-
quate amounts are available for re-
search. 
The legislation also mandates a com-
prehensive review of the available body 
of research on marijuana by the Sec-
retary of Health and Human Services 5 
years after enactment. 
I 
thank 
my 
colleagues— 
Congresspersons 
BLUMENAUER, 
GRIF-
FITH, 
LOFGREN, 
HARRIS, 
and 
ROB 
BISHOP—for all of their work on this. 
This does matter. We need answers. 
And I thank my chairman, who has 
been great about this. 
I refuse to accept the fact that our 
Ranking Member WALDEN is leaving. 
He is a dear friend, and he has made so 
much of a difference. He has had very 
thoughtful input on this, as he does on 
everything. 
Mr. Speaker, it is high time we mod-
ernize our Nation’s Federal regulations 
to facilitate legitimate medical re-
search into the impacts of marijuana, 
and I urge my colleagues to support 
this legislation. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I thank the gentlewoman from Michi-
gan for her kind comments and her 
leadership on this legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, can I inquire how much 
time is remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Oregon has 111⁄2 minutes 
remaining. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GRIF-
FITH), an extraordinary leader on the 
Energy and Commerce Committee, a 
gentleman I refer to as our counsel on 
the committee. He is an extraordinary 
lawyer and incredible public policy 
initiator. 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Mr. Speaker, I appre-
ciate that this bill has made it to this 
level. 
You know, Congress doesn’t always 
work well, but sometimes it does. ANDY 
HARRIS and I were back here, about 
where he is sitting right now, having a 
discussion one day, because a lot of 
times, things get solved or issues come 
to a head because we are trying to 
solve problems for the American peo-
ple. 
I believe that there are many uses for 
medicinal marijuana. I don’t support 
recreational use, but I support medic-
inal use. ANDY thinks that it goes way 
too far, as you heard him just say. 
But the bottom line is, as we were 
discussing it, neither one of us could 
cite scientific research to support our 
positions. So, we agreed at that point 
that we would work together on our 
side of the aisle. And obviously, the 
gentleman from Oregon has been lead-
ing on this for many, many years, and 
he was going to lead on the other side. 
We agreed we would try to find lan-
guage that worked. 
We have tried some backdoor routes 
to get it through some Energy and 
Commerce bills before, schedule 1R to 
do research. But this is extremely im-
portant. And you are either for medic-
inal marijuana or against medicinal 
marijuana, but you can’t make an ar-
gument either way without the proper 
research. 
This fine piece of legislation that was 
hammered out over a couple of years, 
maybe as many as 5 years, is a good 
piece of legislation, and it deserves the 
unanimous 
support 
of 
this 
United 
States House. I recommend it to each 
and every one of you. 
That being said, I would like to take 
another minute to speak about my re-
lationship with my Ranking Member 
WALDEN, who is leaving us. It is with 
regret on my part that he is leaving. 
He has a life to lead, and that is what 
people sometimes forget about Mem-
bers of Congress. 
There is life after Congress, and he is 
going to do some interesting things. I 
am anxious to learn what they are. He 
says he is anxious to learn what they 
are, too. 
But he has so much talent. He has led 
our committee and then our side of the 
aisle on the committee so well, and has 
allowed those of us who are a little dif-
ferent sometimes to have some inter-
esting ideas, to have those ideas bubble 
up, to take some interesting votes 
sometimes in committee, to allow 
Members down dais to have significant 
input. I am greatly appreciative of 
that. 
I am also appreciative of his friend-
ship and loyalty. I remember when we 
discovered that his longtime friend 
Ray Baum had a fatal disease, how he 
stuck with him, how Ray kept coming 
to work and was doing things all the 
way through, and then how he passed 
an important piece of legislation which 
commemorated all of Ray Baum’s 
work. 
The bill has Ray Baum’s name on it, 
as it should, but it was a tribute from 
his friend, and I respect that type of 
friendship. I appreciate it very much. 
I will always hold you in high regard. 
If I can do anything to be of assistance 
in the future, I will gladly do so. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my 
friend and colleague from Virginia for 
not only his very kind comments but 
also his incredible work ethic. 
I will tell one quick story about MOR-
GAN GRIFFITH. I had a little bill, a sus-
pension bill, that Mr. BLUMENAUER and 
I had to do a land exchange up on 
Mount Hood. It flew through here one 
night, first night of votes, and got two 
dissenting votes. One of them I under-
stood, but his dissenting vote I didn’t 
understand. 
I went up to him, and I said: I am 
going to win this. There are only two 
noes. But why did you vote no? 
He said: Well, I read the bill, and it 
referenced this memorandum of under-
standing between the Forest Service 
and Mount Hood Meadows about this 
land exchange. I tried to get a copy of 
that MOU, and I couldn’t get it before 
I voted on the bill, so I voted no. 
b 1430 
Well, the bill didn’t get through that 
Congress. It got through the House, but 
not, of course, the other body. 
So the next Congress, we did it again, 
and I made sure that Mr. GRIFFITH had 
that memorandum of understanding re-
lated to this little land transfer bill in 
an area that Mr. BLUMENAUER and I 
share, and he voted with us on that 
measure. 
I thought: He is a pretty darn good, 
thorough legislator if he is reading 
every suspension bill and every land 
transfer bill and diving into the weeds. 
Americans need to know what a great 
man he is. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he 
may consume to the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. CARTER). 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise in support of the Medical 
Marijuana Research Act. 
Cannabis has been known by humans 
for thousands of years, yet we still 
don’t truly know if the plant is medi-
cally 
beneficial. 
Some 
preliminary 
findings have given cause to believe 
that there may be some medicinal ben-
efits. In fact, the FDA has authorized 
use of medical-grade CBD products for 
rare forms of epilepsy, but large-scale 
research has not occurred. 
Despite this, more than half of the 
States have legalized cannabis for med-
ical purposes. Even Georgia, my home 
State, has acted to expand cannabis 
laws. 
As the legal status of cannabis 
evolves, we must prioritize making the 
plant available for medicinal research. 
In 2017, the National Academy of 
Medicine found that there are several 
challenges and barriers in conducting 
cannabis and cannabinoid research, in-
cluding the classification of cannabis

as a schedule I substance and the dif-
ficulty for researchers to gain access to 
the quality and quantity of product 
necessary for research. 
I do not believe that the Federal Gov-
ernment should be standing in the way 
of medical research for cannabis prod-
ucts. Cannabis could be a lifesaving 
product. It may also not be, but we owe 
it to the patients to do the due dili-
gence, research, and testing so that 
they may make the best medical deci-
sions for themselves. 
While we may all have differing opin-
ions on the decriminalization of rec-
reational marijuana—and my stance on 
that is well-known and well-docu-
mented that I am adamantly opposed 
to the recreational use of marijuana— 
I think we can all agree that we should 
facilitate better research on the plant’s 
medicinal benefits. 
Mr. Speaker, I am glad to see this 
legislation come to the floor for a vote. 
I 
thank 
my 
colleague, 
Mr. 
BLU-
MENAUER, for working on this legisla-
tion with me. I urge passage of this leg-
islation. 
Mr. Speaker, before I leave, I want to 
pay homage, if you will, to Mr. WAL-
DEN, who will be leaving us, you have 
heard other speakers indicate before. 
I came on this committee 4 years 
ago. Being the only pharmacist in Con-
gress, I wanted to be on the Health 
Subcommittee, and I wanted to work 
in that arena. That is where Energy 
and Commerce was. 
I will have to be quite honest with 
you. I really didn’t understand just 
what a great committee—the best com-
mittee in Congress—Energy and Com-
merce is, and I truly believe that. I un-
derstand that now. 
But I want to thank GREG WALDEN, 
because when I came in 4 years ago, he 
was the chairman of this committee, 
and he was very encouraging to me. In 
fact, he was my mentor on this com-
mittee. He led me and gave me oppor-
tunities, and I appreciate that very, 
very much. 
His diversity, his intelligence, his 
fairness has been outstanding. His lead-
ership has been outstanding, and it is 
only surpassed by his impeccable char-
acter. 
Mr. Speaker, as he leaves, I want him 
to know how much I personally am ap-
preciative of all of his help and all of 
his leadership. 
Our committee, our Congress, our 
country is better off because of your 
work. Thank you and Godspeed. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
thank my dear friend and colleague 
from Georgia (Mr. CARTER) for his lead-
ership on so many issues before the 
committee and for his very kind and 
generous words. I will miss serving 
with Mr. CARTER. He has been a terrific 
member of the committee, and he, too, 
will have a great future ahead. 
Mr. Speaker, our next Member, I 
should call him the deputy mayor of 
Washington, D.C., because that is kind 
of what you are when you are the rank-
ing member of the House Administra-
tion Committee. He has been a pas-
sionate advocate on the next bill, but 
because of a meeting he has coming up, 
I am going to yield to him now, so he 
can make that scheduled appointment, 
to talk about this bill and the next bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he 
may consume to the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS). 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I do support the bill that we 
are talking about. I have been a long-
time supporter of medical marijuana 
use, and I certainly believe that the bi-
partisan legislation that is being put 
forward today is a great idea. 
But it is also great to follow my fa-
vorite legalized drug dealer here at the 
dais, BUDDY CARTER, the only phar-
macist in Congress. This is a guy who 
says a lot of things about GREG WAL-
DEN. All of them are true, but I am 
going to get to that in a bit. 
Mr. Speaker, I am here to thank my 
good friend, DONALD PAYNE, Jr., for al-
lowing me to cosponsor a bill that is 
very personal to me, and that is the 
Removing Barriers to Colorectal Can-
cer Screening Act of 2020. 
As some of you may know, my wife 
was 
diagnosed 
with 
early-onset 
colorectal cancer in 1999. She was 26 
years old, and she is a 21-year cancer 
survivor today. It is a genetic form of 
cancer, Lynch syndrome, that I hope 
and pray that families like mine and 
many others don’t have to continue to 
fight. 
But it is imperative that we catch 
cancer in its early stages, and I can 
speak from experience, with my wife 
constantly being misdiagnosed just a 
few short years ago, and that is exactly 
what this legislation does for our Medi-
care population. 
Put simply, this legislation ensures 
that, if a Medicare beneficiary receives 
a colonoscopy, which is covered by 
Medicare, he or she won’t be billed for 
any subsequent tests on polyps that 
may be discovered during the screen-
ing. 
The 
current 
policy 
of 
providing 
colonoscopies at no cost to bene-
ficiaries but then billing them for po-
tential 
findings, 
that 
greatly 
disincentivizes vulnerable individuals 
from actually seeking the screening 
process, which could lead to worse can-
cer and possibly death. 
This is a commonsense fix that will 
save lives. I am proud to colead it, 
again, with my good friend, Mr. PAYNE. 
This is bipartisan. 
But before I close, I want to take a 
moment to thank the countless advo-
cates who have visited my office to 
fight for increased screening, including 
those with Fight Colorectal Cancer and 
the American Cancer Society. Today’s 
vote stands as a testament to their ad-
vocacy and hard work. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank, again, 
Chairman PALLONE and Ranking Mem-
ber WALDEN and everyone on the En-
ergy and Commerce Committee and the 
Ways and Means Committee for work-
ing with us to move this legislation 
forward. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, now I do want to take 
some time—it is actually ironic to 
watch all of the well wishes to GREG 
WALDEN. 
After first meeting him on an air-
plane that happened to land at the 
wrong airport, I didn’t have a lot of 
high hopes for you, Mr. Ranking Mem-
ber. I mean, who lands at the wrong 
airport, except an airplane that GREG 
WALDEN is on? 
Unlike a lot of folks that are here 
touting what you have done, I say: 
Good riddance. It is about time. 
In all seriousness, my friend, this 
place is going to miss you. This place is 
going to miss your humor. This place is 
going to miss your leadership and your 
tenacity. I can’t tell you how proud I 
am to not just call you my colleague, 
but my friend. 
Thank you for everything you have 
done for me and what you have done 
for this great institution. It is a better 
place because you served here, and it 
will not be as good a place without you 
here. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my 
friend from Illinois for his generous 
comments and his great leadership, and 
I wish him well in the future. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of the 
underlying bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
for support to pass this legislation, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support 
of H.R. 3797, the Medical Marijuana Research 
Act. I advanced this bipartisan bill through my 
Health Subcommittee and I’m proud to support 
it on the Floor today. 
According to the Department of Health and 
Human Services National Survey on Drug 
Use, 44 million Americans reported using can-
nabis in the past year. Thirty-three states now 
allow the medicinal use of cannabis and 11 
states and the District of Columbia have legal-
ized cannabis for adult use. 
But state laws and federal policy are a thou-
sand miles apart. As more states allow can-
nabis, the federal government still strictly con-
trols and prohibits it, even restricting legitimate 
medical research. 
The Medical Marijuana Research Act ad-
dresses these restrictions on research and al-
leviates a burdensome, out-of-date process for 
scientific researchers. First, it creates a new, 
less cumbersome registration process specifi-
cally for marijuana, reducing approval wait 
times and costly security measures. Second, 
this bill makes it easier for researchers to ob-
tain the cannabis they need for their studies 
through reforms in production and distribution 
regulations. 
Under this bill, scientists will no longer be 
forced to wait more than a year to become 
federally-approved to conduct cannabis re-
search. They will also not be forced to use the 
cannabis grown by a government-authorized 
farm at the University of Mississippi. This can-
nabis lacks the properties and potency of 
commercially-available cannabis and leads to 
inadequate research.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7083 
December 9, 2020 
This is a commonsense bill that will update 
federal policy to advance research on can-
nabis and its compounds. I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3797, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

ING ACT OF 2020 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I move

December 9, 2020 
(d) REPORT.—Not later than January 1, 
2023, the Inspector General of the Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services shall as-
sess and submit to Congress a report on the 
accuracy of average sales price information 
submitted by manufacturers under section

ommendations on how to improve the accu-
racy of such information. 
SEC. 4. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EF-
FECTS. 
The budgetary effects of this Act, for the 
purpose of complying with the Statutory 
Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be deter-
mined by reference to the latest statement 
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in 
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Oregon (Mr. WALDEN) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 1570. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
1570, 
the 
Removing 
Barriers 
to 
Colorectal Cancer Screening Act of 
2020. This bill eliminates out-of-pocket 
costs for colorectal cancer screening 
tests under Medicare, even in situa-
tions when a polyp is detected and re-
moved. 
Colorectal cancer is the second lead-
ing cause of cancer death among men 
and women, combined, in the United 
States. The American Cancer Society 
predicts that more than 53,000 Ameri-
cans will die from the disease this year. 
This is clearly a tragedy, especially be-
cause these deaths are so preventable. 
Approximately 90 percent of all indi-
viduals diagnosed with colorectal can-
cer at an early stage are still alive 5 
years later. But research shows that 
out-of-pocket costs discourage individ-
uals from seeking out preventative 
screenings that could save their lives. 
Under current law, Medicare waives 
coinsurance 
and 
deductibles 
for 
colonoscopies. However, when a polyp 
is discovered and removed during the 
procedure, it is then reclassified as 
therapeutic for Medicare billing pur-
poses, and patients are required to pay 
the coinsurance. 
This simply is not right. Patients 
should not be saddled with hundreds of 
dollars in medical bills that they jus-
tifiably thought would be covered by 
Medicare as part of a preventative 
service. 
H.R. 1570 provides a commonsense fix 
to this oversight. The bill would ensure 
that colonoscopies, whether they are 
diagnostic or therapeutic, are treated 
equally at the billing stage so all cost- 
sharing is waived under Medicare. By 
removing the financial burden associ-
ated with this procedure, Medicare 
beneficiaries may seek preventative 
care for colorectal cancer without the 
added deterrence of surprise bills. 
In addition, H.R. 1570 incorporates a 
policy that requires all part B drug 
manufacturers to report average sales 
price data to the Medicare program and 
provides the Secretary with new au-
thority to verify this data. 
Under current law, only manufactur-
ers with Medicare drug rebate agree-
ments are required to report average 
sales price data, and in the absence of 
such data, the Medicare program ends 
up paying more. This legislation en-
sures that the government is paying 
the right price for part B drugs, saving 
taxpayers billions and allowing greater 
transparency around drug pricing. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the 
bill’s sponsors. 
First of all, I want to thank Rep-
resentative DONALD
PAYNE
from my 
State. He has been working on this bill 
for so many years, and, of course, it 
came out of the passing of his dad from 
colorectal cancer. I remember his dad 
so fondly. 
Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank 
Representatives DAVIS, MCEACHIN, and 
MCKINLEY for their hard work on this 
important piece of legislation. 
I want to thank Representative DOG-
GETT for his work on the important 
drug pricing policy that is included 
today. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support H.R. 1570, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON WAYS AND MEANS, 
Washington, DC, December 7, 2020. 
Hon. FRANK PALLONE, 
Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN PALLONE: In recognition of 
the desire to expedite consideration of H.R. 
1570, Removing Barriers to Colorectal Cancer 
Screening Act of 2019, the Committee on 
Ways and Means agrees to waive formal con-
sideration of the bill as to provisions that 
fall within the rule X jurisdiction of the 
Committee on Ways and Means. 
The Committee on Ways and Means takes 
this action with the mutual understanding 
that we do not waive any jurisdiction over 
the subject matter contained in this or simi-
lar legislation, and the Committee will be 
appropriately consulted and involved as the 
resolution or similar legislation moves for-
ward so that we may address any remaining 
issues within our jurisdiction. The Com-
mittee also reserves the right to seek ap-
pointment of an appropriate number of con-
ferees to any House-Senate conference in-
volving this or similar legislation. 
Finally, I would appreciate your response 
to this letter confirming this understanding 
and would ask that a copy of our exchange of 
letter on this matter be included in the Con-
gressional Record during floor consideration 
of H.R. 1570. 
Sincerely, 
RICHARD E. NEAL, 
Chairman.

COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND COMMERCE, 
Washington, DC, December 8, 2020. 
Hon. RICHARD NEAL, 
Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN NEAL: Thank you for con-
sulting with the Committee on Energy and 
Commerce and agreeing to discharge H.R. 
1570, the Removing Barriers to Colorectal 
Cancer Screening Act of 2020, from further 
consideration, so that the bill may proceed 
expeditiously to the House floor. 
I agree that your forgoing further action 
on this measure does not in any way dimin-
ish or alter the jurisdiction of your com-
mittee or prejudice its jurisdictional prerog-
atives on this measure or similar legislation 
in the future. I would support your effort to 
seek appointment of an appropriate number 
of conferees from your committee to any 
House-Senate conference on this legislation. 
I will ensure our letters on H.R. 1570 are 
entered into the Congressional Record dur-
ing floor consideration of the bill. I appre-
ciate your cooperation regarding this legis-
lation and look forward to continuing to 
work 
together 
as 
this 
measure 
moves 
through the legislative process. 
Sincerely, 
FRANK PALLONE, Jr. 
Chairman.

Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
1570, 
the 
Removing 
Barriers 
to 
Colorectal Cancer Screening Act of 
2020. 
This is really important legislation, 
as you have heard, and it has received 
strong bipartisan support from lit-
erally hundreds of our colleagues, in-
cluding myself. It was a key provision 
of a bill I actually introduced last year, 
H.R. 19, the Lower Costs, More Cures 
Act of 2019, which had a lot of bipar-
tisan solutions to lower drug prices 
without hindering the development of 
new therapeutics or cures. 
So I am happy to see the House take 
this action on this critical component 
of that other legislation. 
This bill would address an oversight 
in Medicare that requires beneficiaries 
to cover the cost of an unexpected 
polyp removal when provided a free 
screening colonoscopy. 
These surprise medical bills, as I 
would call them, create financial bar-
riers for patient access to these life-
saving screenings, which can save 
thousands of lives a year. 
In the United States, colorectal can-
cer is the second leading cause of can-
cer-related 
deaths, 
Mr. 
Speaker. 
Screenings are the most effective way 
to detect and treat this devastating 
disease early on, and efforts must be 
made to ensure individuals have access 
to these important services. 
By removing these financial barriers 
for patients, this bill would enhance 
screening efforts and ultimately save 
lives. The bill is offset with another 
policy from H.R. 19 that would require 
pharmaceutical companies to report 
their average sales price, ASP. 
Right now, certain companies are ex-
ploiting a little loophole in the current 
law where they are not reporting their

ASP and drawing down higher reim-
bursement rates from Medicare as a re-
sult. This creates an unfair advantage 
with competitors who are doing the 
right thing, as the statute intended, 
and reporting their data. 
I am glad this package includes these 
two provisions of H.R. 19, further add-
ing to the number of provisions from 
this bill that I hope are enacted into 
law during the remainder of this Con-
gress. 
While I urge support of this bill that 
would end surprise billing for this se-
lect group of Americans, I am dis-
appointed Congress has yet to pass a 
bill that would end surprise billing for 
all Americans. Mr. PALLONE and I have 
worked closely on this legislation. We 
have a bipartisan bill. It is ready to go, 
and we could pass it into law before the 
end of the year and put an end to sur-
prise billing for all Americans, not just 
those with an unexpected polyp re-
moval. 
I urge Congress to take further swift 
action to do what the American people 
want us to do. Let’s end surprise bill-
ing once and for all for everyone. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman 
from 
New 
Jersey 
(Mr. 
PAYNE), the sponsor of this bill, who 
has worked so hard on it. 
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss 
my bill, the Removing Barriers to 
Colorectal Cancer Screening Act. It has 
been a long time coming. 
I thank my friend and New Jersey 
colleague, Congressman FRANK
PAL-
LONE, the chairman of the Energy and 
Commerce Committee. As chairman of 
the House committee, his leadership 
was critical to getting my bill to the 
floor today. 
I have been working on this bill since 
my arrival to the United States House 
of 
Representatives. 
Unfortunately, 
colorectal cancer is the reason that I 
am a member of this body. 
In addition, I thank my coleads on 
the bill, as you heard earlier, Congress-
man RODNEY DAVIS and my colleague 
from Virginia, DONALD MCEACHIN, who 
has been instrumental in moving this 
bill forward. Congressman MCEACHIN 
has done an incredible amount of work 
to promote the bill and increase aware-
ness of colorectal cancer. I also thank 
my other colead, Congressman DAVID 
MCKINLEY from West Virginia, for his 
efforts, as well. 
These great representatives under-
stand the importance of this bill to the 
health and security of millions of 
Americans and know that colorectal 
cancer is bipartisan in nature of its 
negative impact on people in this coun-
try. 
Colorectal cancer is the second lead-
ing cause of cancer deaths in America. 
It only trails lung cancer, and it affects 
both men and women. It is the second 
leading cause of death in the United 
States in cancers. 
Like many cancers, it is treatable 
and patients can recover if it is caught 
early enough. But that depends on 
whether Americans get screened. And 
one of the reasons that we are here 
today, my bill would seek to remove 
one of the barriers to screenings. It 
would 
allow 
Medicare 
to 
cover 
screenings and surgical procedures to 
remove cancerous polyps during the 
screenings. 
Today, 
Medicare 
covers 
only 
screenings for eligible patients. If doc-
tors find and remove a cancerous polyp 
during the screening, patients could 
wake up to a surprise bill that could 
cost thousands of dollars. 
After my father succumbed to this 
dreadful 
disease, 
I 
had 
my 
first 
colonoscopy, and at that time they 
found 13 polyps. So can you imagine 
the bill that I could have potentially 
awoken to, tens of thousands of dollars 
in bills that I did not even know that I 
had? 
Too many men refuse to get screened 
because of the fear of this surprise bill 
and a lot of the reason why men don’t 
find this procedure very palatable. 
Then they wait to get screened until 
there is a problem, and potentially 
that is a decision that could be fatal. 
I encourage my House colleagues to 
vote for this bill so we can save thou-
sands of American lives annually. 
It has been almost 9 years since I lost 
my father, Congressman Donald Payne, 
Sr., to colorectal cancer, and I do not 
want to see other families go through 
the same horror and pain. 
I ask that we pass this bill. I urge my 
colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ and save the 
lives of the American people. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
the balance of my time to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS) and I 
ask unanimous consent that he be al-
lowed to control that time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Oregon? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I served with the gen-
tleman’s father for 9 years, and I cer-
tainly understand the pain that was re-
flected in his voice in those remarks. 
This is a commonsense bill. When a 
practitioner encounters a correctable 
lesion at the time of a screening 
colonoscopy, the curative procedure 
should be able to be undertaken with-
out the worry of a patient waking up to 
an unintended charge. 
The other thing that crosses my 
mind as we sit here now, hopefully, on 
the downside of the pandemic is how 
many people have not proceeded with 
the screening procedure because of con-
cern about going to a facility during 
the time of the coronavirus. And it is 
incumbent upon us as policymakers to 
ensure that people do understand the 
importance 
of 
undertaking 
these 
screenings and removing any obstacles 
that would prevent someone from hav-
ing a potentially lifesaving screening 
procedure done. 
Further, Mr. Speaker, if I could, 
many people today have reflected on 
the time of service of Mr. WALDEN, who 
is retiring at the end of this Congress, 
and we will all miss him a great deal. 
As I have listened to several of the 
speakers give testimony to Mr. WAL-
DEN’s leadership on the committee, I 
am just reminded of so many times, 
both good times and rough times. We 
served together on the majority and 
the minority for a number of years on 
the Committee on Energy and Com-
merce. 
The country can look to things like 
the last 10-year reauthorization of the 
State Children’s Health Insurance Pro-
gram and thank Mr. WALDEN for the vi-
sion of getting that enacted. Certainly, 
the SUPPORT Act in the last Congress, 
starting with Member Day in the com-
mittee and culminating with the sign-
ing ceremony in the White House lit-
erally 12 months later. 
These were some of the significant 
accomplishments 
of 
then-Chairman 
WALDEN, now Ranking Member WAL-
DEN. He has left a rich legacy in this 
Congress, and we are all very much in 
his debt, and we will miss him terribly 
in the Congresses to come. I thank the 
gentleman for his indulgence. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this 
bill, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
that we support this legislation and 
pass it, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support 
of H.R. 1570, the Removing Barriers to 
Colorectal Cancer Screening Act. I advanced 
this bipartisan bill through my Health Sub-
committee and I’m proud to support it on the 
Floor today. 
This legislation was introduced by Rep-
resentatives PAYNE, DAVIS, MCEACHIN, and 
MCKINLEY to remove financial barriers to life- 
saving colorectal cancer screenings and treat-
ment for Medicare beneficiaries. 
Currently, Medicare covers a colonoscopy 
without out-of-pocket costs for beneficiaries, 
but if the colonoscopy results in a polyp re-
moval, patients are stuck with an unexpected 
copayment. This small distinction could mean 
hundreds of dollars of out-of-pocket expenses 
for seniors on Medicare who are often living 
on a fixed income. 
This bill would waive that cost-sharing and 
give millions of Medicare beneficiaries the 
peace of mind that they can receive the pre-
ventive care they need without being stuck 
with unexpected costs. 
I urge my colleagues to support this bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1570, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
The title of the bill was amended so 
as to read: ‘‘A bill to amend title XVIII 
of the Social Security Act to waive co-
insurance

A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

HENRIETTA LACKS ENHANCING 
CANCER RESEARCH ACT OF 2019 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 1966) to direct the Comptroller 
General of the United States to com-
plete a study on barriers to participa-
tion in federally funded cancer clinical 
trials by populations that have been 
traditionally underrepresented in such 
trials, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1966 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Henrietta 
Lacks Enhancing Cancer Research Act of 
2019’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds as follows: 
(1) Only a small percent of patients partici-
pate in cancer clinical trials, even though 
most express an interest in clinical research. 
There are several obstacles that restrict in-
dividuals from participating including lack 
of available local trials, restrictive eligi-
bility criteria, transportation to trial sites, 
taking time off from work, and potentially 
increased medical and nonmedical costs. Ul-
timately, about 1 in 5 cancer clinical trials 
fail because of lack of patient enrollment. 
(2) Groups that are generally underrep-
resented in clinical trials include racial and 
ethnic minorities and older, rural, and lower- 
income individuals. 
(3) Henrietta Lacks, an African-American 
woman, was diagnosed with cervical cancer 
at the age of 31, and despite receiving painful 
radium treatments, passed away on October 
4, 1951. 
(4) Medical researchers took samples of 
Henrietta Lacks’ tumor during her treat-
ment and the HeLa cell line from her tumor 
proved remarkably resilient. 
(5) HeLa cells were the first immortal line 
of human cells. Henrietta Lacks’ cells were 
unique, growing by the millions, commer-
cialized and distributed worldwide to re-
searchers, resulting in advances in medicine. 
(6) Henrietta Lacks’ prolific cells continue 
to grow and contribute to remarkable ad-
vances in medicine, including the develop-
ment of the polio vaccine, as well as drugs 
for treating the effects of cancer, HIV/AIDS, 
hemophilia, leukemia, and Parkinson’s dis-
ease. These cells have been used in research 
that has contributed to our understanding of 
the effects of radiation and zero gravity on 
human cells. These immortal cells have in-
formed research on chromosomal conditions, 
cancer, gene mapping, and precision medi-
cine. 
(7) Henrietta Lacks and her immortal cells 
have made a significant contribution to 
global health, scientific research, quality of 
life, and patient rights. 
(8) For more than 20 years, the advances 
made possible by Henrietta Lacks’ cells were 
without her or her family’s consent, and the 
revenues they generated were not known to 
or shared with her family. 
(9) Henrietta Lacks and her family’s expe-
rience is fundamental to modern and future 
bioethics policies and informed consent laws 
that benefit patients nationwide by building 
patient trust; promoting ethical research 
that benefits all individuals, including tradi-
tionally underrepresented populations; and 
protecting research participants. 
SEC. 3. GAO STUDY ON BARRIERS TO PARTICIPA-
TION IN FEDERALLY FUNDED CAN-
CER CLINICAL TRIALS BY POPU-
LATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN TRADI-
TIONALLY UNDERREPRESENTED IN 
SUCH TRIALS. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 2 years 
after the date of enactment of this Act, the 
Comptroller General of the United States 
shall— 
(1) complete a study that— 
(A) reviews what actions Federal agencies 
have taken to help to address barriers to par-
ticipation in federally funded cancer clinical 
trials by populations that have been tradi-
tionally underrepresented in such trials, and 
identifies challenges, if any, in imple-
menting such actions; and 
(B) identifies additional actions that can 
be taken by Federal agencies to address bar-
riers to participation in federally funded 
cancer clinical trials by populations that 
have been traditionally underrepresented in 
such trials; and 
(2) submit a report to the Congress on the 
results 
of 
such 
study, 
including 
rec-
ommendations on potential changes in prac-
tices and policies to improve participation in 
such trials by such populations. 
(b) INCLUSION
OF
CLINICAL
TRIALS.—The 
study under subsection (a)(1) shall include 
review of cancer clinical trials that are 
largely funded by Federal agencies. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Oregon (Mr. WALDEN) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 1966. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
the balance of my time to the gen-
tleman from Maryland (Mr. MFUME). 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without 
objection, the gentleman from Mary-
land will control the balance of the 
time of the majority. 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MFUME. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the chair of the Energy and Commerce 
Committee, Mr. PALLONE of New Jer-
sey. I appreciate his oversight of this 
bill and the way his committee has 
moved us to where we are today. 
Mr. PALLONE
and I go way back. 
When I left this body some time ago, I 
didn’t know I would come back and he 
would be chair of the committee, but I 
couldn’t think of a better person. 
I also say to Mr. WALDEN, the rank-
ing member from Oregon, that the 
body obviously will miss you. And as 
you heard on both sides of the aisle 
with the comments that have been 
made, people have respected your lead-
ership and the leadership that you have 
brought to that committee both as 
ranking member and as chair. By the 
way, let me tell you, there is life after 
Congress. I went out and found 24 years 
of it before coming back. So best of ev-
erything to you, sir. 
Members of the body, if I might, let 
me just talk a bit about a distin-
guished, in my opinion, woman whose 
picture is here beside me. Her name 
was Henrietta Lacks. She was born 100 
years ago in Roanoke, Virginia. 
Mrs. Lacks and her husband and her 
family later moved to Baltimore Coun-
ty in 1941, seeking, as a lot of people 
did, what they thought were jobs that 
were available the further north you 
moved. They moved to an area near 
what was known as the old Bethlehem 
Steel Plant. Henrietta and her family 
lived not far from me and my family in 
a segregated Black enclave known as 
Turner Station. 
Ironically, Mrs. Lacks got ill. In 1951, 
as a young mother, she went to the 
hospital complaining of vaginal bleed-
ing. She went to Johns Hopkins at the 
time, which was one of the few hos-
pitals that African Americans could go 
to and be treated. 
Upon examination, gynecologists dis-
covered a large, malignant tumor in 
her cervix. During her treatment there, 
two cell samples were taken from Mrs. 
Lacks and from her cervix without her 
permission and without her knowledge. 
One sample was healthy tissue, the 
other sample was cancerous tissue. And 
these samples were given to a physi-
cian and a cancer researcher at Hop-
kins to study. 
What this researcher would soon dis-
cover was that Mrs. Lacks’ cells were 
unlike any others he had ever seen. 
Where other cells would die, Mrs. 
Lacks’ cells doubled every 20 to 24 
hours. 
b 1500 
This continued after her death. 
The cells from the cancerous sample 
became known eventually as the HeLa 
immortal cell line. 
The HeLa immortal cell line is the 
oldest and the most commonly used 
human cell line in scientific research 
anywhere in the world. The cell line 
was found to be remarkably durable 
and prolific, which allows its use exten-
sively in scientific study. This was the 
first human cell line to prove to be suc-
cessful in in vitro studies, which was a 
scientific achievement with profound 
implications on the future and pro-
found benefits to medical research. 
HeLa cells can divide an unlimited 
number of times in a laboratory cell 
culture plate as long as fundamental 
cell survival conditions are met and 
sustained. There are, as we have come 
to know over time, many strains of 
HeLa cells as they continue to mutate 
in other cell cultures, but all HeLa 
cells are descended from the same 
tumor cells once removed from Mrs. 
Lacks. The total number of HeLa cells 
that have been propagated in cell cul-
ture far exceeds the number of cells 
that were in her body.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7087 
December 9, 2020 
Today, these incredible cells are used 
to study the effects of toxins, drugs, 
hormones, and viruses on the growth of 
cancer cells without having to experi-
ment on humans while that is being 
done. They have been used to test the 
effects of a number of different things: 
radiations, 
poisons, 
to 
study 
the 
human genome, and to learn more 
about how all viruses ultimately work, 
and they have played a crucial role in 
the development of the polio vaccine. 
When Jonas Salk was so close to get-
ting to what he thought was an effec-
tive vaccine, Dr. Salk tested the vac-
cine against the cells, and the cells di-
rected him to make the vaccine even 
more potent. 
The NIH analyzed and evaluated sci-
entific literature over the course of 
time involving HeLa cells and found 
that over 110,000 publications cited the 
use of those cells from 1953 to 2018. So 
this analysis, I think, further high-
lights the persistent impact of HeLa 
cells in science and in medicine, prov-
ing that they have been a consistent 
and essential tool that has allowed re-
searchers to expand their knowledge 
base in fields such as cancer biology, 
infectious disease, and many, many 
other areas. 
There is so much to be said about Ms. 
Lacks, who died in that same Black, 
poor enclave many, many years ago, 
but to her credit and to the credit of 
all science, her living clearly was not 
in vain, and her death has proven 
something that nobody ever antici-
pated at the time: that there could 
even be such a cell that would continue 
to develop and mutate long beyond the 
donor’s ability to live. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman 
from Maryland (Mr. MFUME) for bring-
ing us this legislation and for his very 
kind comments about my service and 
the future that lies ahead of me, per-
haps. I appreciate his leadership and 
his kind words. 
I, too, rise today to speak on H.R. 
1966, the Henrietta Lacks Enhancing 
Cancer Research Act of 2019, which was 
sponsored by the late, great Represent-
ative Elijah Cummings originally. 
This bill is named after Henrietta 
Lacks, a woman of color who donated 
her cells, without her knowledge and 
consent, to Johns Hopkins in 1951, be-
ginning what was the first human cell 
line able to reproduce indefinitely. 
Her cells have been used in bio-
medical research around the world. 
H.R. 1966 requires the Government 
Accountability Office, or the GAO, to 
study how Federal agencies have ad-
dressed barriers to participation in 
cancer clinical trials by individuals 
from underrepresented populations and 
to provide recommendations for ad-
dressing such barriers. 
The intent of the bill is laudable, as 
racial and ethnic minorities are cur-
rently 
underrepresented 
in 
clinical 
trials. 
I know that has been an issue even in 
the COVID trials. I have talked to the 
people who have developed these vac-
cines, and this is a real issue they face, 
trying to get the right mix to reflect 
the community and make sure that ev-
eryone who takes the various drugs 
and vaccines are represented in these 
trials. 
It is a concern, because people of dif-
ferent ages, different races, different 
ethnicities, they simply may react dif-
ferently to medical treatments. So we 
have to get this right. 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my friends 
from Maryland for bringing this legis-
lation to the floor, and I, of course, pay 
homage to Representative Cummings 
for his initial leadership on this as 
well. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. MFUME. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. RUPPERSBERGER) of the Com-
mittee on Appropriations. 
Mr. RUPPERSBERGER. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise in support of H.R. 1966, and I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
I proudly co-led this bill when it was 
first introduced by our late friend, Eli-
jah Cummings, in honor of the extraor-
dinary life and legacy of a Baltimore 
native, Henrietta Lacks. 
Although 
Congressman 
Cummings 
has passed on and remains deeply 
missed, I am proud and grateful that 
Congressman MFUME has picked up the 
mantle on this important legislation. 
Without her knowledge or permis-
sion, doctors used Henrietta Lacks’ 
cells for medical research that eventu-
ally led to some of medicine’s most 
critical breakthroughs, including de-
velopment of the polio vaccine, along 
with treatments for cancer, HIV/AIDS, 
leukemia, and Parkinson’s. 
I can think of only a handful of 
Marylanders or even Americans who 
have contributed more to modern med-
icine than Henrietta Lacks. Her life-
saving contributions will continue to 
advance cures for debilitating diseases 
for generations to come. 
Yet more than 70 years after Hen-
rietta Lacks’ death, many commu-
nities still face glaring health dispari-
ties. For example, while cancer inci-
dence rates are highest among non-His-
panic 
White 
females, 
non-Hispanic 
Black females have the highest rate of 
death. 
Clinical trials are a key component 
to 
advancing 
cancer 
research 
and 
treatment, but 20 percent of cancer 
clinical trials fail because of a lack of 
patient enrollment, with racial and 
ethnic minorities and older, rural, and 
lower-income 
Americans 
generally 
underrepresented in such trials. 
This bill examines access to govern-
ment-funded cancer clinical trials for 
traditionally underrepresented groups, 
but it is also about much more. 
It is about giving credit where credit 
has been long overdue, it is about en-
suring all Americans get the medical 
treatments they deserve, and it is 
about ensuring clinical trials succeed 
because they are inclusive. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this bill. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. KEVIN 
HERN). 
Mr. KEVIN HERN of Oklahoma. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from 
Oregon (Mr. WALDEN) for yielding. 
I rise in support of H.R. 1966. 
This legislation was first brought to 
my attention by my constituent, Carla 
Prothro, who is fighting cancer. We 
talked about the way clinical trials im-
pact the treatments available for can-
cer patients. The trials very rarely re-
flect the population of cancer patients. 
When women and minorities are 
underrepresented in clinical trials, it 
negatively impacts the results. About 
one in five cancer trials fail because of 
a lack of participation. 
This bill addresses that by studying 
the barriers to participation for under-
represented groups. We need to find 
ways to reduce those barriers and en-
roll more patients from diverse back-
grounds. 
My niece, Juniper, is 3 years old and 
fighting stage 4 neuroblastoma. She is 
just a little kid, but her short life has 
already had so much pain. She has 
spent a third of her life in the hospital. 
Juniper is a fighter, though, and she 
has so many people who love her and 
are praying for her. 
Bills like this help Juniper and Carla 
and millions of cancer patients around 
the world. Every step forward in cancer 
research is important. Every bit of 
progress gets us closer to a better 
world. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote in support of H.R. 1966 today. 
Mr. MFUME. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I don’t 
have any other speakers on my side. I 
encourage Members to support this 
really important legislation, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. MFUME. Mr. Speaker, I would 
inquire how much time remains on my 
side. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Maryland (Mr. MFUME) 
has 101⁄2 minutes. 
Mr. MFUME. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
My thanks, again, to the gentleman 
from Oregon (Mr. WALDEN) and the oth-
ers who have spoken on behalf of this, 
including 
Congressman 
RUPPERS-
BERGER, who has been, as he indicated, 
a part of this effort for a while. 
And that while goes all the way back 
to the other reason that I am here 
today, and that is my friend of 42 years 
and a Member of this body for 23 years, 
the late Elijah Cummings, who origi-
nally introduced this bill before his 
death, and a commitment that I made 
to he and to others long ago that, 
working outside of the Congress, I 
would be supportive of him. 
But now that I am inside, I wanted to 
make sure that I got unanimous con-
sent from this body, as I did a month

or so back, to be able to assume the 
leadership of this bill, its sponsorship, 
and to move it forward, and we have 
been doing all that we could to get to 
this point. 
Again, Mr. Speaker, I would be re-
miss if I did not thank Mr. PALLONE 
and Mr. WALDEN for their efforts. 
Let me, if I might, just say a couple 
of things, Mr. Speaker. It has been long 
recognized that the burden of cancer is 
not equal and not equivalent among 
different racial and ethnic groups in 
our society. In fact, there is a fourfold 
increase, or disparity, in the number of 
Black people diagnosed with cancer in 
this country as compared with the pro-
portion of Black people participating 
in clinical trials. 
The gentleman from Oregon (Mr. 
WALDEN) mentioned how sensitive this 
is right now as we are trying to work 
with drug companies to come up with a 
number of vaccines. And whether it 
was the Pfizer trial or the Moderna 
trial, one thing is clear: there has 
never seemed to be enough persons of 
ethnic backgrounds, particularly Afri-
can Americans and Latinos, who are 
participating in these trials. 
To underscore this more, let me re-
mind you that 20 percent of Alz-
heimer’s patients in this country are 
African American, but only 3 to 10 per-
cent are the trial participants in clin-
ical trials. 
As I said, COVID is a disease with a 
roughly twofold higher rate of diag-
nosis and mortality between African 
Americans and other populations. 
So all of that, in the aggregate, real-
ly stresses the need for a more diverse 
research participatory effort in order 
to fully understand, comprehensively 
deal with, and cure these diseases. 
Clinical trials are an essential step in 
advancing potential new cancer treat-
ments. We know that. Patient partici-
pation in those trials is absolutely cru-
cial to their success. 
Now, many patients will express a 
willingness to participate in clinical 
research, yet only a small fraction of 
those persons do actually do that. 
In terms of the larger African-Amer-
ican community, some of the barriers 
that have existed continue to exist. 
People can’t take time off from their 
job to participate and be studied in a 
clinical trial, or, more importantly, 
there is this level of distrust. 
The distrust, particularly among Af-
rican Americans, goes back to 1932, 
when our government, through the 
United States Public Health Service, 
oversaw and gave authorization for 
what was to become known as the infa-
mous Tuskegee Study, where 600 Black 
men, without their knowledge, without 
their approval or consent, were in-
jected with syphilis and told that they 
were being treated for something alto-
gether different. 
Those 600 men lived and watched 
their bodies change. Many of them may 
had reinfected others. They suffered a 
great deal of pain. And nowhere during 
that time did the government step in 
and say, ‘‘Stop it.’’ 
b 1515 
That Tuskegee study, which many of 
us grew up hearing about, is something 
that lurks in the minds of a lot of Afri-
can Americans about why you can’t 
trust the government on research when 
it comes to your body. The shame that 
went with that ought to be a collective 
shame that all of us in this country 
feel. 
We are beyond 1932. People are still 
getting ill. There are all sorts of infec-
tious diseases. We need vaccines, and 
we have to find a way now to partici-
pate in that process and to find a way 
to get beyond the things that hold us 
back. 
But in this instance, I just thought it 
was important to mention why that re-
luctance tends to exist. 
Racial and ethnic groups, and older 
Americans, rural Americans, and poor 
Americans, are all the groups that still 
remain 
underrepresented 
in 
cancer 
clinical trials. Without action, these 
groups will continue to face barriers in 
terms of enrollment in cancer and 
other clinical trials, which then de-
prive many Americans from access to 
effective 
treatments 
and 
effective 
interventions. 
Mr. Speaker, I close by reminding us 
how we began, and that is with the 
story, the life, and the lesson of Hen-
rietta Lacks, who died at an early age, 
a mother of five who came north seek-
ing employment, who developed an ill-
ness, who got treated, and who, with-
out her knowledge or consent, had cells 
taken out of her body that were not 
cancerous—in addition to the can-
cerous cells—only to miraculously find 
that there was something very, very 
special about Ms. Lacks and her bio-
logical makeup: a cell that continued 
to mutate and to mutate and to double 
long after it was taken from her body, 
long after her death, and even now has 
created 110,000 studies about this mi-
raculous cell, which we call HeLa, that 
has been the basis of research, Nobel 
award-winning research, in the years 
that followed. 
My thanks to all of you for partici-
pating and for understanding the pas-
sion that drove Elijah on this, that 
drives me on this. 
I want to thank the Lacks family, 
the Henrietta Lacks Foundation. 
I want to thank the American Cancer 
Society, the National Institute of Mi-
nority Health and Health Disparities, 
Research America, and all the other or-
ganizations that continue to fight to 
bring about some sort of balance and 
equity in the whole issue of research 
and clinical trials. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support 
of H.R. 1966, the Henrietta Lacks Enhancing 
Cancer Research Act. I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill in honor of two Baltimoreans 
who changed the world—Henrietta Lacks and 
Representative Elijah Cummings. 
Representative Cummings introduced this 
legislation to help address the barriers facing 
minority, low-income, and underrepresented 
groups when it comes to enrolling in federally- 
funded clinical cancer trials. He named it after 
Henrietta Lacks to honor the role she and her 
tumor samples played in breakthroughs for 
cancer, HIV/AIDS, leukemia, polio, and Parkin-
son’s disease. Henrietta Lacks’ tumor samples 
were used without her or her family’s knowl-
edge or consent and her contribution has 
been overlooked for decades. This legislation 
will begin to correct that wrong, while also im-
proving access to medical research for African 
Americans 
and 
other 
underrepresented 
groups. 
Representative Cummings dedicated his 
Congressional career to ensuring underrep-
resented groups had access to health care. 
He championed policies to improve health eq-
uity by lowering drug prices and improving 
maternal care for African American women. 
I’m pleased that this bill will be added to his 
legacy and I thank Representative MFUME for 
ensuring the advancement of this bill. 
I urge my colleagues to support this legisla-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1966, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

REQUIRING 
SECRETARY 
OF 
HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES 
TO CONSIDER CERTAIN RECOG-
NIZED SECURITY PRACTICES 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 7898) to amend title XXX of the 
Public Health Services Act to provide 
for a technical correction to provide 
the Inspector General of the Depart-
ment of Health and Human Service cer-
tain authorities with respect to inves-
tigations of information blocking, and

ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Oregon (Mr. WALDEN) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and to 
include extraneous material on H.R. 
7898. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, in 2016, the Energy and 
Commerce Committee led the charge in 
passing the 21st Century Cures Act. 
In addition to investing billions in 
cutting-edge research and opioid abuse 
prevention and treatment, the Cures 
Act also included several provisions re-
lated to improving the interoperability 
of health information technology. Spe-
cifically, the act defined the practice of 
information blocking. It also provided 
the Department of Health and Human 
Services Office of the Inspector Gen-
eral, or OIG, with the authority to in-
vestigate and levy penalties on entities 
found to be engaging in information 
blocking. 
Examples of information blocking 
could include a developer placing un-
necessary restrictions on authorized 
exchanges of information. Another ex-
ample would be when a developer im-
plements 
their 
electronic 
health 
record, EHR, technology in such a non-
standard way that it becomes incred-
ibly difficult to exchange a patient’s 
health information with a system not 
owned by that developer. 
Practices like these simply stand in 
the way of patients accessing their own 
data and carrying their data with them 
as they move between plans and pro-
viders. 
I am pleased that the Office of the 
National Coordinator for Health Infor-
mation Technology, ONC, and the OIG 
have worked since the passage of the 
Cures Act to implement these impor-
tant policies. 
The bill before us today, H.R. 7898, 
provides for a technical correction to 
the Cures Act to ensure that the OIG 
has the authority they fully need to 
enforce the information blocking pro-
hibitions. 
H.R. 
7898 
also 
includes 
another 
health IT-related policy that was part 
of a bipartisan, bicameral health agree-
ment released by the Energy and Com-
merce Committee and the Senate Com-
mittee on Health, Education, Labor, 
and Pensions last December. 
This policy incentivizes healthcare 
entities to adopt strong cybersecurity 
practices by encouraging the Secretary 
of HHS to consider entities’ adoption of 
recognized 
cybersecurity 
practices 
when conducting audits or admin-
istering HIPAA fines. 
Cyberattacks 
are 
increasingly 
a 
major concern for healthcare providers. 
It is important that we acknowledge 
those providers that are acting in good 
faith and doing everything in their 
power to safeguard patient data. 
This provision encourages providers 
to follow widely recognized best prac-
tices in the field with the goal of help-
ing all providers be better prepared for 
potential cybersecurity attacks. 
These both are commonsense poli-
cies, and I urge my colleagues to join 
me in supporting them. I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 7898, a technical corrections bill 
introduced by Dr. BURGESS. 
The 21st Century Cures Act had a 
major provision, led by Dr. BURGESS, 
regarding information blocking. This is 
a process where a healthcare provider 
or an electronic healthcare record ven-
dor will not move a patient’s data be-
tween care settings or erects signifi-
cant technological or financial barriers 
to do so. 
The 21st Century Cures Act was sig-
nificant in that it banned the practice 
of information blocking, which is a key 
patient protection and an effort to 
transform our healthcare delivery sys-
tem. Patient access and control over 
personal health information should be 
at the center of our efforts in securing 
high-quality and patient-driven care. 
The Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee delivered this win for patients, 
and today, we need to make a minor 
but very important technical correc-
tion to ensure our policy is enforced. 
H.R. 7898 would clarify the authority 
of the Department of Health and 
Human Services inspector general re-
garding information blocking, to make 
crystal clear that the IG has the au-
thority to enforce this ban, to go after 
bad actors, and to protect patient ac-
cess to personal health data. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS), 
the author of this provision and our 
ranking member, the top member on 
the Republican side, on the Health 
Subcommittee. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for the recognition. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
7898, once again, to clarify the enforce-
ment and investigative authorities of 
the inspector general at the Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services 
with respect to health record informa-
tion blocking. 
In 2016, as has been stated, Congress 
passed the bipartisan 21st Century 
Cures Act with the goal of closing the 
gap between innovation and our Na-
tion’s regulatory process. Throughout 
the drafting of Cures, I made it a pri-
ority to address important health in-
formation technology issues, including 
interoperability and the prevention of 
information blocking. 
I am a physician, but I am also a pa-
tient, and I am acutely aware of the 
frustrations surrounding the difficulty 
of a patient accessing their medical 
records. Patients should control their 
own medical data. Yet, if a patient and 
their doctor have difficulty in access-
ing electronic health records, the pa-
tient’s care may suffer. 
In the Cures bill, Congress provided 
the tools necessary for doctors and pa-
tients to better coordinate their care 
through the sharing of patient data. 
The Office of the National Coordi-
nator for Health Information Tech-
nology promulgated a rule that out-
lines what is permissible. This rule,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7090 
December 9, 2020 
which was finalized this past May, 
aims to allow patients to seamlessly 
access their electronic health informa-
tion. 
This bill, H.R. 7898, is needed in order 
to ensure that there is a smooth and ef-
fective implementation and to allow 
for the inspector general of the Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services to 
enforce this rule. 
In the context of this coronavirus 
pandemic, I think we have all seen the 
importance of allowing the efficient 
flow of a patient’s medical records so 
that patients and their doctors can 
have 
informed 
conversations 
about 
their care plans. 
Also of importance is ensuring pa-
tient privacy and ensuring that it is 
protected and that information is se-
cure. H.R. 7898 builds on the sections of 
the 21st Century Cures Act and encour-
ages 
healthcare 
entities 
to 
adopt 
strong cybersecurity practices, which 
are essential in protecting patient data 
from bad actors. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
the gentleman from Texas an addi-
tional 1 minute. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
Finally, I would like to point to the 
bipartisan, bicameral support of H.R. 
7898, which was included in title V of 
the Lower Health Care Costs package 
in the Senate. We have both Chambers 
and both parties coming to an agree-
ment, and that is a positive sign. It 
certainly indicates the importance of 
this legislation. 
It is for these reasons that I encour-
age Members to vote in favor of H.R. 
7898. Again, I thank the ranking mem-
ber for his years of friendship and serv-
ice to the committee. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I was hoping I wasn’t 
going to have to make this statement 
about GREG WALDEN retiring because I 
really didn’t want him to retire. I 
guess I kept hoping that he wouldn’t or 
that he would still be here in some 
fashion—and he will be in some fash-
ion. 
But I wanted to thank him for 20 
years of extraordinary service on the 
Energy and Commerce Committee, in 
particular. And I want to particularly 
thank him for his leadership and 
friendship over the last 4 years as he 
served as the top Republican on the 
committee. 
During those first 2 years, he chaired 
the committee, and then over the last 
2 years, he served as the ranking mem-
ber. Our committee, as he knows and I 
think a lot of people know, has a long 
and proud tradition of bipartisanship, 
and GREG has really been a great part-
ner, particularly over the last year as 
we faced the unprecedented challenges 
of COVID–19. 
We have worked very closely over the 
last 11 months on all the legislation 
that was signed into law to respond to 
the pandemic. Among those laws was 
the CARES Act, which provided essen-
tial assistance to the American people, 
healthcare workers, hospitals, small 
businesses, and State and local govern-
ment. We have taken some significant 
steps, but the work continues as we 
hope to complete another COVID–19 re-
lief package in the coming days before 
we adjourn. 
Prior to the pandemic this year, we 
were able to come together over the 
last 4 years, thanks to GREG’s leader-
ship, to pass a lot of other substantial 
bills that actually became law. 
We passed comprehensive legislation 
to address the opioid epidemic by ex-
panding treatment to people fighting 
opioid use disorder and supporting 
those affected by the opioid crisis. 
We reauthorized the Safe Drinking 
Water Act for the first time in 20 years. 
We eliminated annoying robocalls—I 
don’t know, ‘‘eliminating’’ may not be 
accurate, but we eliminated a lot of 
them. 
We passed the RAY BAUM’S Act, 
named after the late Republican staff 
director of the committee and GREG’s 
longtime friend, which reauthorized 
the Federal Communications Commis-
sion for the first time in 28 years. 
I know the law is very important to 
GREG, not only because it was named 
after Ray but also because of GREG’s 
longtime love for broadcasting. 
Of course, not everything is bipar-
tisan. He will probably never forget his 
initiation as chairman. His first full 
committee markup—as was already 
mentioned by other colleagues—was 
the longest markup in the Energy and 
Commerce 
Committee’s 
history, 
27 
hours as we debated the Republican Af-
fordable Care Act repeal bill. That was 
really baptism by fire. 
At the end of the day, I am going to 
remember GREG most for the commit-
ment he made day in and day out to 
help everyday Americans. It is really 
special. 
A lot of people have a bad opinion of 
Congress. They think that we come 
here for self-aggrandizement because 
somehow we want to get a better job 
after we leave—not that there is one— 
or that we are trying to help our fami-
lies or trying to help special interests. 
The one thing I will say about GREG is 
that none of that is true. 
b 1530 
One thing I will say about GREG is 
that none of that is true. He has a 
strong dose of humility, and humility 
is something that I would say often-
times is lacking, not just in Congress, 
but in general. Sometimes I wonder if 
people even value it as something that 
they cherish. But certainly GREG does. 
He is not only humble, he really cares 
about everyone, and he is not just out 
for himself. 
I also want to thank his wife, 
Mylene, for sharing him with us for all 
these years. We are going to miss 
GREG, and we will miss Mylene also. 
GREG, I wish you nothing but the 
best in your future endeavors. I have 
been hearing different rumors from 
other Members. EARL actually told me 
about some trip you took in the moun-
tains in Oregon. 
Everybody is sort of secret about 
these different things that he is doing, 
but I suspect that they are going to be 
endeavors that he loves and that, when 
I hear about them, will be fantastic. 
I just feel bad about even making 
this speech about his leaving, but that 
is the way it is, and I am going to miss 
him. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
To my friends in this assembly, 
thank you for your friendship. 
To the chairman of the committee, 
we have developed a wonderful rela-
tionship. Sometimes your staff and our 
staff spar, but we are a family, and 
families do disagree from time to time. 
But generally speaking, we are headed 
in the same direction, and that direc-
tion is making America a better place 
for everyone and solving problems. So I 
am very thankful for your very gen-
erous and kind comments, Mr. Chair-
man. 
Mr. Speaker, I will say it has been a 
real delight and joy to work with the 
chairman of the Energy and Commerce 
Committee. I would have to admit it 
was a more delight and joy to work 
with the ranking member of the En-
ergy and Commerce Committee when I 
was chairman, but that is the way of 
the world, and that is democracy. We 
switched roles and handed off the gavel 
in peace, and we began to approach 
issues from a different angle but with 
the same mission. 
Mr. Speaker, as 2020 comes to a 
thankful close—I think we are all 
ready to get it behind us—so does my 
22 years of public service in this incred-
ible crucible of democracy, the United 
States House of Representatives. 
I want to start by thanking my wife 
of 38 years, and our son, who is 30, 
Mylene and Anthony. They have al-
ways supported me during my three 
decades of State and Federal service, 
all the campaigns, all the meetings, 
and all the times away. I know my col-
leagues will understand this when I say 
I will never fully understand all that 
they sacrificed so that I could fulfill 
my duty in office, but I do know it was 
a lot. 
I also want to thank my terrific staff 
over the years, and especially those 
who helped me build and lead such suc-
cessful organizations, including my 
two personal office chiefs of staff of 
over 22 years, Brian MacDonald and 
Lorissa Bounds, terrific leaders both; 
my executive directors at the NRCC 
when I ran the Republican campaign 
organization, Liesl Hickey and Rob 
Simms; and my staff directors at the 
Energy and Commerce Committee. 
You have heard of the late great Ray 
Baum, my colleague dating clear back 
to the late eighties in the Oregon Leg-
islature and then all the way through

December 9, 2020 
just a couple years ago when he passed 
away of cancer. Mike Bloomquist and 
Ryan Long also did such terrific work 
heading up the best committee in Con-
gress. 
I want to thank the professional 
staff, many of whom have been on the 
floor today, my personal staff in Or-
egon and Washington, D.C. We rely so 
much on these very smart and talented 
people, and the country is well-served 
by their work. 
I want to thank the thousands of vol-
unteers and supporters of my cam-
paigns over the years. We did it to-
gether, and I would like to believe we 
did it for the right reasons: to leave 
our State and to leave our country bet-
ter places than we found them. 
I also want to thank some important 
mentors in my life. 
Of course, I would have to start with 
my parents, who grew up with nothing 
during the Great Depression. They 
taught me the importance of giving 
back to the community, of working 
hard, and of always being honest and 
seldom being judgmental. 
I want to thank those along the way 
who gave me some interesting career 
opportunities. 
My freshman year in college was 
spent at the University of Alaska Fair-
banks. I want to thank the folks at 
KTVF and the old KFRB Mighty Nine-
ty in Fairbanks who put a 17-year-old 
kid in charge of producing and direct-
ing the 11 o’clock TV news. I had never 
been in a TV studio before, and sud-
denly, as a freshman in college, I was 
working every night doing that. 
To Roger Martin, Vic Atiyeh, Gary 
Wilhelms, and Denny Smith, I learned 
so much from working for each of you. 
To former Oregon Speaker Larry 
Campbell, time and again you showed 
Oregon how principled leadership pro-
duces good results. So it was great 
sport serving alongside you in the Or-
egon House. 
Of course, I want to thank the 
church, school, and scout leaders who 
influenced my life in such a positive 
way. I would give a shout-out to the 
late Earl Fowler. He was my high 
school vice principal and student body 
officer adviser whose counsel, when I 
was student body president at Hood 
River Valley High School, was as valu-
able then as it is now. 
I remember one of the things he told 
us as student leaders was: ‘‘When there 
is a leadership vacuum, fill it.’’ He ex-
pected us to step up, to lead, and to 
take on challenges. 
I am indeed thankful for the oppor-
tunity the people of Oregon have given 
me to represent them in the United 
States House of Representatives. It is a 
responsibility I have always taken seri-
ously as I faithfully tried to do my best 
to represent them. After all, this is 
their office, not mine. I was simply en-
trusted to use the powers bestowed upon it 
for their benefit, something I never forgot. It 
is part of why I have returned home nearly 
every weekend and will soon—whenever we 
wrap up business here—complete my 644th 
round trip back home. 
My team and I put special emphasis 
on taking care of the men and women 
who wear or have worn our Nation’s 
uniform and defended America’s free-
dom: 
We helped thousands of Oregon vet-
erans and families receive the benefits 
they earned and deserved. 
We worked to strengthen the mission 
at Kingsley Air Field and open vet-
erans clinics throughout the commu-
nity and the district. 
We helped save the veterans facility 
in White City. 
America is blessed to have those 
brave men and women who risk their 
lives so that we can enjoy ours in 
peace. America owes them a debt we 
can never fully repay. 
Having grown up on a cherry orchard 
outside of The Dalles, Oregon, I always 
had great admiration for those who 
farm and ranch and feed us. I worked 
hard to protect their way of life, de-
fending farmers and ranchers from bad 
policy proposals. I stood up for their 
water rights. I protected their land and 
ranching way of life. 
I am especially proud of the Steens 
Mountain 
Cooperative 
Management 
and Protection Act and the collabo-
rative approach that it envisioned. 
Moreover, I supported ag research 
and 
water 
conservation 
efforts 
throughout the district. And while we 
made much progress on both fronts, my 
one regret is that we could never find 
the key to unlocking a durable and fair 
solution to the water crisis in the 
Klamath Basin that could also pass in 
the Congress. 
We did make progress to improve for-
est management, even though I am dis-
appointed Congress has dragged its feet 
in enacting much-needed reforms to 
make our Federal forests healthier and 
more resilient to climate change. 
It was 17 years ago last week that 
President Bush signed the Healthy For-
est Restoration Act into law. Hope-
fully, in the next Congress, you all will 
heed the guidance of our Yale forestry 
graduate 
and 
colleague, 
BRUCE 
WESTERMAN, to modernize how we man-
age this great American resource be-
fore the rest of it goes up in smoke. 
Having spent 6 years as chair of the 
Telecommunications Subcommittee, I 
am really proud of the bipartisan work 
we did together to open up spectrum 
for advanced communications; enact 
FirstNet, our first responders’ new 
interoperable broadband network; and 
to expand access to high-speed inter-
net, although much work still remains 
to fully connect all Americans to high- 
speed broadband. 
With the RAY BAUM’S Act, we even 
reauthorized and modernized the FCC, 
and, as you heard, that hadn’t been 
done in a couple of decades. 
When I had the great privilege and 
honor to chair the Energy and Com-
merce Committee, we took on the 
deadly epidemic of drug overdose and 
combined more than 60 bipartisan 
pieces of legislation into the SUPPORT 
Act, which, while focused on the opioid 
crisis, actually was much bigger than 
that and provided support for our com-
munities to help all with addiction. 
We modernized our mental health 
laws, stepped up medical research, and 
fully funded the Children’s Health In-
surance Program for a decade—some-
thing that had never been done before. 
We modernized the FDA and its ap-
proval processes for medicines and 
medical devices, and thank goodness 
we did. Some of these changes have al-
ready proven their value during this 
pandemic. 
I am proud to have done my part to 
help enact Medicare part D, which fi-
nally brought more affordable medi-
cines to America’s seniors. While we 
need to update this law, it is a fact 
that Medicare part D has been a god-
send to seniors who no longer have to 
board buses to foreign countries to get 
lifesaving medicines. 
We also unleashed a cleaner energy 
revolution in America that created 
thousands of new jobs and reduces 
America’s carbon emissions, too. En-
ergy innovation holds the opportunity 
for a strong economy and a healthier 
environment. 
Mr. Speaker, as you can tell, I am 
pretty passionate about good public 
policy, and I have really enjoyed this 
opportunity in serving with all of you. 
I think we can use our resources we 
have among ourselves in Congress to 
get good things done for the American 
people. 
It wasn’t easy to decide to volun-
tarily leave this wonderful institution, 
but I had long ago decided I didn’t 
want to get voted out—and I don’t 
think that was going to happen—or 
carried out. I was confident I would 
win reelection, and my health is good, 
so I leave on my own terms, feeling 
good about that which I have helped 
improve in the lives of those who en-
trusted me election after election. 
I leave feeling positive about the 
ability to get good policy done right 
here in the U.S. House of Representa-
tives. In fact, we just worked through a 
slate of bipartisan bills again today. 
I will miss this process, and I will 
miss you, my colleagues. Always re-
member how important the work you 
do here is and how much the fate of the 
American way of life rests in your 
hands every time you put that voting 
card in one of these machines. 
I am a big fan of Theodore Roosevelt. 
His writings have also had an impact 
on my life. Just as my high school ad-
viser encouraged us to fill leadership 
vacuums, so did Roosevelt laud those 
who climbed into the arena. So I close 
with President Roosevelt’s words: 
‘‘It is not the critic who counts; not 
the man who points out how the strong 
man stumbles, or where the doer of 
deeds could have done them better. The 
credit belongs to the man who is actu-
ally in the arena, whose face is marred 
by dust and sweat and blood; who 
strives valiantly; who errs, who comes 
short again and again, because there is 
no effort without error and short-
coming; but who does actually strive to

Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance

Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
support for passage of the bill, and I 
also yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the

The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
The title of the bill was amended so 
as to read: ‘‘A bill to amend the Health 
Information Technology for Economic 
and Clinical Health Act to require the 
Secretary of Health and Human Serv-
ices to consider certain recognized se-
curity practices of covered entities and 
business associates when making cer-
tain determinations, and for other pur-
poses.’’. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7094 
December 9, 2020 
HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF RONALD ROGERS 
(Mrs. DEMINGS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the life and legacy 
of Mr. Ronald Rogers. Ron dedicated 
his life to public service and to cre-
ating opportunities for young people. 
Ron was a proud member of the 
Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc. and a 
graduate of Florida A&M University. 
But above all, he was a proud graduate 
of Jones High School, and he loved the 
students with all of his heart and soul. 
As founder and president of the Or-
lando chapter of 100 Black Men of 
America, he worked hard to mentor 
students and provide scholarships and 
other resources to help them during 
their college years. 
Ron also served in numerous leader-
ship roles, including as city adminis-
trator 
for 
the 
historic 
town 
of 
Eatonville, 
where 
his 
vision 
for 
Eatonville helped pave the way for the 
town’s success today. 
Ron never stopped, paused, or ex-
haled. He had an unwavering sense of 
urgency about serving his community, 
about making his community better. 
Ron Rogers truly made a difference 
in the lives of others, and we are so 
grateful for a life well-lived. 
f 
SUPPORTING OUR CORRECTIONS 
OFFICERS 
(Mr. KELLER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, early 
Monday morning, two corrections offi-
cers at Allenwood Federal penitentiary 
in Union County, Pennsylvania, were 
viciously assaulted in the line of duty 
by an inmate. 
While both Officer Sara Harvey and 
Officer Dale Franquet were injured, 
their heroic actions resulted in sub-
duing an armed and violent inmate and 
preventing the inmate from harming 
others. 
Officer Harvey has since returned to 
work, while Officer Franquet remains 
in the hospital undergoing treatment. 
Both of these individuals exemplify 
sacrifice and service. They are true he-
roes. 
This tragic incident is a stark re-
minder of the challenges our correc-
tions officers face on a daily basis. De-
spite great personal risk to themselves 
and their families, corrections officers 
go to work every day out of a deeply 
rooted sense of service. 
Our entire community is grateful for 
these two corrections officers and 
every person employed in the prison 
who continue to stand guard. 
As chairman of the BOP Reform Cau-
cus, I look forward to continuing to 
work with my colleagues in Congress 
to ensure that our corrections officers 
have the resources and support they 
need to do their jobs effectively and, 
most importantly, safely. 
f 
SALUTING KIMBERLY A. ROSS 
(Mrs. BEATTY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
pay tribute and salute a person who 
has dedicated 20 years of her life to this 
institution, coming here in 2000 as a 
young, brilliant regulatory attorney to 
work in the Senate as a senior LA, 
then to the House as a legislative di-
rector, then to be the staff attorney for 
the 
House 
Veterans’ 
Affairs 
Com-
mittee, and, finally, to my office as 
chief of staff and counsel, the only 
chief of staff I have had since 2013. 
She is one of the most loyal, hardest 
working, dedicated, and intelligent in-
dividuals I have worked with. I con-
sider it an honor to have worked with 
her. 
Her footprints are deep. They leave 
an impression to guide others. Her 
words of wisdom, generosity, historical 
knowledge, quickness to speak, analyt-
ical thoughts, late night conversations, 
and early morning pickups to work 
make her my national treasure. 
This woman is Kimberly Ross, Es-
quire, Chief of Staff, who serves faith-
fully to this institution and to me. 
Kimberly, you have climbed every 
mountain, now enjoy the view. Happy 
retirement. And to you and your won-
derful husband, Bernard, good luck and 
congratulations on your next venture. 
f 
BUCKET BRIGADE BREWING 
(Mr. VAN DREW asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to recognize Bucket Brigade 
Brewing in Cape May Courthouse in 
south Jersey. 
They actually were founded by two 
identical twin brothers, Kurt and Karl 
Hughes. The brothers are also fire-
fighters from Cape May County. 
The Hughes family has a long, sto-
ried history in this great Nation, even 
having a relative who signed the Dec-
laration of Independence. His name was 
Thomas McKean. 
The Bucket Brigade taproom was in-
spired by the rich history of Cape May 
County’s small businesses. I was lucky 
enough to swing by and visit with them 
recently. 
I want to thank them for their com-
mitment to south Jersey and to first 
responders and partnering with the Na-
tional Fallen Firefighters Association 
to assist those who are in real need. 
Mr. Speaker, if you happen to be in 
the area, make sure to grab a nice cold 
beer. 
I thank Kurt and Karl for all they do 
for their community. 
God bless you, and God bless Amer-
ica. 
HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES 
AND UNIVERSITIES 
(Mr. HALL asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. HALL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to speak about the importance of his-
torically Black colleges and univer-
sities. 
For over 150 years, HBCUs have 
played an important role in the edu-
cation, cultivation, and upward mobil-
ity of African Americans. But as the 
Nation’s economy changes and shifts 
firmly towards the information age, 
our Nation’s HBCUs must be steadfast 
in following this trend. 
Software and technology startups are 
the largest creators of new jobs and 
wealth creation in this country in dec-
ades; however, there is an imbalance 
for minorities to have access to this 
opportunity. For example, less than 1 
percent of all venture capital dollars 
go to Black founders. 
Software and technology startups are 
the chance to build something from 
nothing. Indeed, to do so is the Amer-
ican Dream. 
We need to make that dream, the 
tech startup dream, available to all mi-
norities and overlooked communities. 
This program, Startup the HBCUs, can 
significantly increase the number of 
minorities that work in the high-tech 
field and increase the number of mi-
norities that are founders of tech com-
panies. 
If we follow these steps, we will be 
able to ensure that the American 
Dream in the information age is avail-
able to all, including our students at 
our Nation’s historically Black col-
leges and universities. 
f 
THE FIRST MILITIA 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, in De-
cember 1636, the first militia regiments 
in North America were organized in 
Massachusetts and recognized by Mas-
sachusetts Bay Colony’s General Court. 
This date marks the founding of State 
militias that collectively make up the 
National Guard. 
The men and women of the National 
Guard make great sacrifices to protect 
our homeland and citizens from harm. 
Their duties encompass more than just 
mitigating violence and civil unrest or 
being mobilized overseas. 
For example, just this year, in my 
home State of California, two National 
Guard aircrews flew repeatedly into 
the raging Creek fire in southern Cali-
fornia to rescue nearly trapped camp-
ers, hikers, and residents. Their heroic 
efforts saved nearly 400 lives. 
This bravery is not uncommon to Na-
tional Guardsmen, and for 384 years 
they have always been, and always will 
be, there for us.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE

December 9, 2020 
COVID–19 RELIEF 
(Mrs. LEE of Nevada asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today on behalf of the people of 
Nevada’s Third Congressional District 
with a plea to all of my colleagues: 
We are now entering the darkest pe-
riod of this pandemic. Americans are 
scared, and I don’t blame them. Ameri-
cans are also angry, and they should 
be. They are angry at Congress and this 
administration for failing to pass more 
relief for struggling families, frontline 
workers, and small businesses. 
Thousands more Nevadans filed for 
unemployment during the last few 
weeks. Over 400,000 Nevadans remain at 
risk of eviction as housing assistance 
expires. 
As this virus uncontrollably spreads 
in every corner of this country, our 
frontline workers and hospitals are 
overwhelmed with a tidal wave of new 
COVID-positive patients. 
There is no more time for political 
games that have consumed Congress 
for months. There never was. I am 
pleading to my Republican and Demo-
cratic colleagues, to our leadership, 
and to this administration: It is time 
to do our jobs and pass more COVID–19 
relief now.

THE FOUR CHURCHWOMEN 
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
this December in reflective remem-
brance and commemoration of the val-
iant lives of the famed four American 
churchwomen, who were brutally raped 
and murdered by the El Salvadoran 
military 40 years ago on December 2, 
1980. 
Their names were Sisters Dorothy 
Kazel, Ita Ford, Maura Clarke, and 
Jean Donovan. Their mission, and ulti-
mately their lives, were sacrificed to 
the service of the forgotten and the im-
poverished in El Salvador. These coura-
geous women of faith were hallmarks 
of their community and their mission 
of accompaniment in the nation amidst 
turmoil. 
Mr. Speaker, 40 years ago, in the 
midst of a civil war, the U.S. Govern-
ment funded and supported the El Sal-
vadoran military that on December 2, 
1980, murdered these evangelical saints. 
In their protection and companionship 
of refugee families, they were targeted 
as enemies of national interest in the 
country. These four women were noth-
ing less than lionhearts of political and 
social righteousness that respected all 
people. 
Mr. Speaker, in recognizing their leg-
acy, I ask for a moment of silence as 
we recall, each time we mourn their 
names, the loss of these four saints. 
HONORING SCOTT HORSFALL 
(Mr. PANETTA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the decades of service of 
my good friend, Scott Horsfall. 
Scott is retiring this month after 
decades of serving our agricultural 
community on the central coast of 
California. Scott’s career has been 
spent serving farmers and farmworkers 
through his work at California Grown, 
at the California Kiwifruit Commis-
sion, at the California Table Grape 
Commission, and where I got to know 
him, at the Leafy Greens Marketing 
Agreement, where he was the first 
CEO. 
With Scott at the helm for over the 
past 13 years, leafy green producers in 
California have operated under one set 
of science-based food safety standards. 
Over 6,200 government audits have been 
conducted, and more than 7 billion 
servings of lettuce and leafy greens 
have been grown and enjoyed by Amer-
ican consumers. 
But it is not just about his accolades 
and accomplishments. It is about the 
relationships he has fostered and the 
work he has done to build strong rela-
tionships on the central coast and 
throughout our country. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Scott for his 
work, his commitment, his dedication 
for our food safety, for our agriculture, 
and for our Nation’s food security.

NATIONAL BIBLE WEEK 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Colo-
rado (Mr. LAMBORN) is recognized for 60 
minutes as the designee of the minor-
ity leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, before I 
begin, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative 
days in which to revise and extend 
their remarks and include extraneous 
materials on the topic of this Special 
Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Colorado? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, it is a 
great honor for me to come to the 
House floor tonight to commemorate 
National Bible Week. This year’s Spe-
cial Order marks the 79th annual cele-
bration of a week in which we celebrate 
the tremendous influence of the Bible 
on the freedoms we enjoy today in 
America. 
I am so thankful and blessed to live 
in a country where we have the free-
dom to worship and read the Holy 
Scriptures without fear. Many people 
across the globe live in countries where 
such freedoms do not exist. 
Mr. Speaker, under our wonderful 
system of government, people are free 
to respect and study the Bible, or any 
other system of belief, if they so 
choose—or even none at all. That is the 
beauty of the American way, and it is 
rooted in the deep truths contained in 
the Word of God. 
In 1941, President Franklin Delano 
Roosevelt 
declared 
the 
week 
of 
Thanksgiving to be National Bible 
Week. This is the time we set aside to 
recognize the Bible as a foundational 
building block of Western civilization, 
the Judeo-Christian heritage, and the 
ideas and principles that shape the 
thinking of our America’s Founding 
Fathers. 
The Word of God has had a profound 
impact on my life as well. I agree with 
the Psalmist when he says: 
Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light 
to my path. 
This has been true in my own life as 
well. God’s Word has shaped my think-
ing and deeply influenced my relation-
ship with God. The Bible has indeed 
been a guiding light in every area of 
my life and a source of comfort and 
strength in a time of need. 
In this hour, we will hear from Mem-
bers of Congress from various faiths, 
traditions, and denominations to speak 
about what the Bible means to them. 
We are here, in keeping with tradition, 
to recognize National Bible Week. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. WEBER). 
Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
we have taken the Bible and God out of 
school. We are so smart. We have re-
placed Him with armed police officers, 
drug-sniffing dogs, and metal detec-
tors. 
We have kicked Biblical training and 
principles out of schools. And now, we 
have broken families, absentee fathers, 
single moms struggling, and disrespect 
like we have never seen before. 
So much for what Jesus teaches us in 
the Bible: Love others as you love 
yourself. Or do unto others as you 
would have them do unto you, a/k/a, 
the Golden Rule. 
Today’s moral-less culture’s motto 
seems to be, do unto others and then 
split, but not before you get a selfie 
and put it on Facebook. 
Disrespect 
is 
rampant—witnessing 
the rioting in the cities recently, the 
burning of the American flag. The 
courts decided in their infinite wisdom 
that flag burning is a protected form of 
speech. All I ask of those who are going 
to burn the flag, wrap themselves in it 
first. 
Mr. Speaker, courts have decided 
that you can’t pray in schools, you 
can’t pray at football games. We 
wouldn’t want to invoke God’s bless-
ings on our gatherings. So much for 
the commandments in the Bible: Love, 
respect, duty, commitment, et cetera. 
Our country has gotten away from 
Biblical 
principles. 
Marriages 
have 
been destroyed, drugs are rampant, 
killing of unborn children. So much the 
order of the day, that now the abortion 
crowd wants to kill people after they 
have botched an abortion.

December 9, 2020 
Mr. Speaker, think of it. America’s 
great fighting men and women can be 
fighting a vile enemy; we can wing one 
of their soldiers and we will do every-
thing we can to nurse that soldier back 
to health, that enemy. But we won’t 
try to save a baby we just tried to 
abort. 
God, help us. Lord, help us if we don’t 
get back to Biblical principles. It is 
God’s guidebook, his plan that this 
country was founded on. America, you 
had better get back to the Bible. 
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Texas, and I yield 
to another gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
BABIN). 
Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
good friend, Mr. LAMBORN from Colo-
rado, for having this Special Order 
Hour. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in celebra-
tion of the 79th annual National Bible 
Week. Since Franklin D. Roosevelt in 
1941, every President has set aside a 
time of reflection and a time of grati-
tude for the Good Book in acknowledg-
ment of its profound influence on hu-
mankind. 
The Bible was perhaps the most ac-
cessible book to our Founding Fathers, 
and its principles gave them valuable 
insights about human nature, civic vir-
tue, political authority, and the rights 
of our citizens. Many of our founding 
documents contained references to the 
great truths found in Scripture. 
As stated in the Declaration of Inde-
pendence, ‘‘That all men are created 
equal, that they are endowed by their 
Creator 
with 
certain 
unalienable 
rights, that among these are life, lib-
erty, and the pursuit of happiness.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, much like the early 
days of this great country, we are at a 
critical time in our history in America. 
The decisions we make now will set our 
course for years to come. It is my fer-
vent prayer that we, as Americans, 
turn to the Scriptures for healing and 
for direction. Its principles are time-
less, and its wisdom is trustworthy. 
The Bible has been my comfort in 
sorrow, my counsel in decisionmaking, 
my 
companion 
in 
day-to-day 
life. 
Whether conducting my business as a 
dentist in Woodville, Texas, raising my 
family, or serving the good people of 
the 36th District of Texas here in Con-
gress, 
the 
Good 
Book 
continually 
shapes the way that I try to live my 
life. 
Mr. Speaker, I believe that the Bible 
is more than a book of inspiration and 
comfort or simply a compilation of 
moral teachings. I believe it is the 
Holy Word of God that contains the 
truth of his love for us and his plan of 
redemption through faith in Jesus 
Christ alone. 
One of the most well-known verses in 
the Bible, John 3:16, tells us that: 
God so loved the world that he gave His 
only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth 
in Him should not perish, but have ever-
lasting life. 
There, in the pages of Scripture, God 
describes His great love for us, a love 
that was exhibited through the gift of 
His only Son sent to redeem us. And we 
are about to celebrate His birth. 
Mr. Speaker, I will leave you with a 
passage of Scripture from the Book of 
Job in the Old Testament that has been 
an encouragement for me with its 
promise of eternal life. I hope that it 
will be for you as well: 
For I know that my Redeemer lives, and 
He shall stand at last on the Earth; and after 
my skin is decayed, this I know, that in my 
flesh I shall see God, whom I shall see for 
myself and my eyes shall behold, and not an-
other. How my heart yearns within me. 
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Louisiana (Mr. JOHNSON), who is 
the current chairman of the Repub-
lican Study Committee. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my friend for yield-
ing. 
Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to my col-
league, Congressman DOUG LAMBORN. 
He is so faithful every year to organize 
this Special Order series. And this 
year, we recognize, as has been men-
tioned, the 79th anniversary of Na-
tional Bible Week. 
Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to stand 
with all my Members and friends today 
to share our perspectives on why the 
Bible is so important to us and to our 
country. I am often reminded, I think 
about and reflect upon, and we quote 
all the time, the Founders. George 
Washington, who was the father of our 
country, and he famously said, ‘‘Of all 
the disposition and habits which lead 
to political prosperity, religion and 
morality are indispensable supports.’’ 
They were the foundation of the very 
Republic. 
And John Adams is our second Presi-
dent. He comes next. He says, ‘‘Our 
Constitution is made only for a moral 
and religious people. It is wholly inad-
equate to the government of any 
other.’’ 
What he meant was that this is es-
sential to who we are as Americans. 
Even more fundamental than that, who 
we are as human beings. 
And it was one of my favorite Presi-
dents, Ronald Reagan, who said that, 
‘‘If we ever forget that we are one Na-
tion under God, we will be a Nation 
gone under.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, in the very short time I 
have, I would share one brief para-
graph, a preface to a historic text that 
I have in my collection. Some of the 
guys have this as well. But this is a 
copy of a New Testament Bible study 
that was approved by and published for 
the public schools of Dallas, Texas, by 
its Board of Education in September of 
1946. 
The preface was written by a gen-
tleman by the name of Henry van 
Dyke. And it is a wonderful summary 
of what the Bible means to us and to 
the world. I will read that into the 
RECORD. 
‘‘Born in the East and clothed in Ori-
ental form and imagery, the Bible 
walks the ways of the world with fa-
miliar feet and enters land after land 
to find its own everywhere. 
‘‘It has learned to speak in hundreds 
of languages to the hearts of men. It 
comes into the palace to tell the mon-
arch that he is a servant of the Most 
High, and into the cottage to assure 
the peasant that he is a son of God. 
‘‘Children listen to its stories with 
wonder and delight, and wise men pon-
der them as parables of life. It has a 
word of peace for the time of peril, a 
word of comfort for the time of calam-
ity, a word of light for the hour of 
darkness. Its oracles are repeated in 
the assembly of the people, and its 
counsels whispered in the ear of the 
lonely. 
‘‘The wicked and the proud tremble 
at its warnings, but to the wounded 
and the penitent, it has a mother’s 
voice. The wilderness and the solitary 
place have been made glad by it, and 
the fire on the hearth has lit the read-
ing of its well-worn page. 
‘‘It has woven itself into our dearest 
dreams; so that love, friendship, sym-
pathy and devotion, memory and hope, 
put on the beautiful garments of its 
treasured speech, breathing of frankin-
cense and myrrh. No man is poor or 
desolate who has this treasure for his 
own. 
‘‘When the landscape darkens and the 
trembling pilgrim comes to the Valley 
named of the shadow, he is not afraid 
to enter; he takes the rod and staff of 
Scripture in his hand; he says to friend 
and comrade; ‘Goodbye, we shall meet 
again.’ And comforted by that support, 
he goes toward the lonely pass as one 
who walks through darkness and into 
light.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, that is a pretty good 
summary about what the Bible means 
to us. I am delighted to honor National 
Bible Week and to stand with my 
friends here. 
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman. 
Mr. Speaker, that reminds me of a 
story here from the Halls of Congress 
in the beginning of our country’s his-
tory. 
Many of the early American settlers 
who came to the New World with the 
express purpose of living out their faith 
to God and his Word, according to the 
convictions of their own consciences, 
founded our country. And one of the 
very first Congress’ first acts was the 
authorization 
of 
an 
American-pub-
lished Bible. 
The Revolutionary War with the 
British in the late 1700s had cut off all 
remaining shipments of Bibles from 
England. 
b 1745 
Our Founding Fathers understood 
how important it was for the American 
people to have access to Bibles. 
Robert Aitken, a private citizen, 
brought this need to the attention of 
Congress, and he wrote a letter saying: 
‘‘This work is an object worthy of the 
attention of the Congress of the United

States of America, who will not neglect 
spiritual 
security, 
while 
they 
are 
virtuously contending for temporal 
blessings.’’ 
In 1782, Congress reviewed, approved, 
and authorized the first known English 
language Bible to be printed in Amer-
ica. They passed a resolution, here in 
the halls of Congress—or the Conti-
nental 
Congress—saying: 
‘‘Resolved, 
that the United States in Congress as-
sembled highly approve the pious and 
laudable undertaking of Mr. Aitken, as 
subservient to the interest of religion, 
as well as an instance of the progress of 
arts in this country, and being satisfied 
from the above report of his care and 
accuracy in the execution of the work, 
they recommend this edition of the 
Bible to the inhabitants of the United 
States, and hereby authorize him to 
publish this recommendation in the 
manner he shall think proper.’’ 
Can you imagine doing that today? 
The House of Representatives approv-
ing the printing of a Bible? 
Our country has changed over the 
years, and I am not sure it has always 
changed for the better. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Georgia (Mr. HICE). 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Colorado, 
my good friend, for leading this Special 
Order. I am indeed honored to rise and 
celebrate and honor the book that, 
without question, has transformed my 
life, brought light into my life and to 
the entire world, and to join my col-
leagues in recognizing the most signifi-
cant book in the history of our Nation, 
its founding, and its history through-
out. Of course, we are talking about 
the Bible. 
As a pastor of 25-plus years, prior to 
coming to Congress, this opportunity 
to speak the Word of God on this floor 
is an extremely important thing to me 
personally and to our Nation. 
There is no question that Benjamin 
Franklin—and we have many, many, 
many, many examples—and I have a 
lot of them in my office. But Benjamin 
Franklin spoke very clear truth when 
he said that famous statement that: 
‘‘The longer I live, the more convincing 
proofs I see of this truth, that God gov-
erns in the affairs of men.’’ 
Without a doubt, it is in the Bible 
that we learn about the greatness of 
God. We learn that He is the object of 
true worship, that He is the fount of all 
blessings, that He is the light of the 
world. It is in the Bible that we learn 
about the holiness of God. And, yes, it 
is in the Bible that we learn about the 
sinfulness of every one of us as human 
beings, that we have broken God’s 
moral standard in one of a thousand 
different ways. 
But it is in the Bible also that we 
learn how much God loves us, and in 
His great love, He sent His Son, Jesus 
Christ, to pay the penalty for our sins 
on that cross. It is in the Bible we 
learn that all of us who trust in Him 
can receive the greatest gift that any-
one could ever receive, and that is the 
gift of forgiveness, which all of us need. 
I cherish this moment to speak about 
the truths of God’s Word. Our country, 
as we all know, has been referred to 
over and over and over throughout his-
tory as a shining city on a hill. But we 
also know today that we are a Nation 
that stands at a critical crossroad. I 
believe it is times like this, more than 
other times, perhaps, that the verse 
that was quoted earlier, Psalm 119, 
verse 105, means so much to us. We 
need to heed that God’s Word is a lamp 
unto our feet and a light unto our path. 
More than ever, we need to heed, as a 
nation, as a body, as leaders in this 
great Chamber, the Word of God and 
let it become our light and our path-
way. 
It is, I believe, our responsibility, as 
leaders in this country, to point our 
constituents, at least to the point of 
reminding them that the Bible is ex-
tremely significant, not only to us as 
individuals, but to us as a Nation, and 
that we need to encourage people to go 
back to the teachings, the principles, 
the truths, the eternal truths of God’s 
Word. How different our Nation would 
be with that. 
Again, I want to thank my friend for 
leading this Special Order and all of 
my colleagues for taking time to come 
to speak to the truths of God’s Word. 
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman and appreciate his re-
marks. 
Next, it is with great pleasure that I 
would like to recognize a personal 
friend as well as a colleague from 
Michigan. He and his wife, Sue, have 
been an example to my wife and me in 
the sincerity of their beliefs. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Michigan (Mr. WALBERG). 
Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Colorado for tak-
ing advantage of National Bible Week 
to give us a chance to talk about 
foundational principles. 
It was back in 1973—and this is a 
great book, the Bible. In 1973, a beloved 
mentor of mine brought me into his of-
fice, and he said: Tim, I think there is 
a verse in Scripture that would be good 
for your life verse of challenge. 
He read to me from Acts 20:24 where 
it says: 
But I do not consider my life of any ac-
count as dear unto myself, that I might fin-
ish the course and the ministry set before me 
to testify solemnly of the Gospel of the grace 
of God. 
I took that as a life challenge verse, 
and it has directed my entire life since 
1973. It has been an impactful verse 
from Scripture, God’s Word, to direct 
my steps, imperfect as they may be, to 
be about something more than just my-
self and declare a message that talks of 
eternal things and not just for the here 
and now. 
It all began, though, back in my 
home with my twin brother. My mom 
and dad, I thank God they were believ-
ers in this book and believers in God 
and taught their two young sons to 
memorize Scripture to impart in their 
lives. 
It was a verse that was referred to 
earlier that was the first verse that my 
twin brother and I were asked to 
memorize. It didn’t mean anything 
really to me until it became personal 
by putting my own name in the words 
of that verse of John 3:16. For God so 
loved TIM that He gave His only begot-
ten Son, that if TIM believed in Him, 
TIM would not perish, but he would 
have eternal life. 
That made all the difference in the 
world. It changed my life. It changed 
my perspective. It didn’t make me per-
fect. 
Mom also asked me to memorize Sec-
ond Timothy 3:16, where it says: 
All Scripture is inspired by God, and it is 
profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for cor-
rection, for training in righteousness. 
I think mom wanted those words to 
be not so important for doctrine, but to 
correct me, to train me, and to reprove 
me as I moved forward in my life. 
Even as King David said in Psalm 119: 
‘‘Your Word,’’ the Bible, ‘‘Your Word 
have I treasured in my heart that I 
might not sin against You.’’ And if I 
do, First John 1:9 says: 
If we confess our sins, He is faithful and 
just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us 
from all unrighteousness. 
How our country needs that today. 
As has been pointed out, we were 
founded on Biblical things, principles 
of Scripture that were seen to be im-
portant for a new nation. 
First Peter 1:21 says this—and I end 
with this Scripture: 
But know this first of all, that no prophecy 
of Scripture is a matter of one’s own inter-
pretation. 
We hear that in our world today. We 
hear that in our country: Oh, whatever. 
To thy own self be true. You decide. 
You choose. You make Scripture im-
portant for you in whatever way. 
But it goes on to say: 
For no prophecy of Scripture was ever 
made by an act of human will, but men 
moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God. 
My colleague, the gentleman from 
Colorado, thank you for giving us an 
opportunity to remind ourselves that 
this book is from God. It is for our ben-
efit. It will impact this Nation for 
good, not evil. It will give us the way 
to move forward, to bind up the divi-
sion that has taken place, to bind up 
the uncertainty that is there and put 
us back on a path that God can bless. 
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman. 
Mr. Speaker, those of us who believe 
in the Bible are sometimes accused of 
having blind faith. But nothing could 
be further from the truth. There are 
many proofs on why we know that the 
Bible is actually true. One of those is 
the fulfillment of prophecies. 
The accuracy of the Bible is proven 
by so many prophecies, foretelling fu-
ture events, that have come true ex-
actly as foretold, especially in the Old 
Testament. There have been many pre-
dictions that were given to prove, when 
they were first spoken, that the speak-
er was divinely inspired. If and when

those predictions came true, it vali-
dated the words of that person, of that 
prophet. 
For instance, the Book of Daniel has 
some very detailed prophecies, scores 
of these, that were literally fulfilled, 
that could not have ever been done by 
chance. Skeptics responded and said, 
well, Daniel must have been written 
after those events. They, otherwise, 
could not have been so detailed on 
what happened later and that the writ-
er of Daniel was not being honest. 
But, in fact, it was discovered after-
ward that the Book of Daniel was 
found in its entirety in the Greeks’ 
Septuagint and partially in the Dead 
Sea Scrolls, and both of those were 
proven to predate the events that were 
prophesied. That argument that it was 
written later fell through. This means 
that the critics of the Book of Daniel 
and its dating are the ones who are not 
being honest. 
The rise and fall of empires, the cap-
ture and destruction of cities, the des-
tiny of kings, all were prophesied about 
in minute detail. Fulfillment of proph-
ecy is just one of the reasons we know 
that the Bible is true. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Kansas (Mr. ESTES). 
Mr. ESTES. Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to thank my friend, Mr. LAMBORN, 
for holding this special hour. 
For our Nation’s Founding Fathers, 
the Bible was a guiding light and pro-
vided them the wisdom to build a 
strong 
foundation 
for 
the 
United 
States, a nation that recognizes and 
protects our God-given rights. 
The teachings in the Bible are inter-
twined with American beliefs and val-
ues, showing us truth, sacrifice, and 
compassion for others. 
In Isaiah 45:13, God called on Cyrus to 
bring freedom to His people. He says: 
I have raised them up in righteousness, and 
I will direct all his ways; he shall rebuild My 
city and let My exiles go free, not for price 
nor reward. 
Just as God called upon Cyrus cen-
turies ago, He calls each of us to serve 
Him and our fellow man. Not only that, 
but God equips us with His Word and 
His Holy Spirit. 
We serve Him by advocating for the 
weakest among us and giving a voice to 
the voiceless. We do this in His name, 
not for reward, but out of love for our 
fellow man. That servant attitude 
should be followed, whether you are a 
Member of Congress, a farmer, or a ma-
chinist on a manufacturing line. 
I am so grateful for His calling in my 
life and for His Word that is a lamp to 
my feet and a light to my path. 
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for his great remarks. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Nebraska (Mr. BACON). 
Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
good friend from Colorado for giving 
me the opportunity to share my faith 
tonight. It is the most important as-
pect of my life. 
I became a believer at the age of 13. 
I thank my dad for taking me to 
church every week and for leading 
Bible studies with our family. I learned 
at a young age that our God is the 
mighty creator of the universe, a just 
God who is holy and perfect, a loving 
God that cares for each of us, and He 
made salvation possible through hav-
ing faith and believing in His Son, 
Jesus. 
The Bible is the most important book 
ever written, and in the end, it is the 
most valuable possession I own. A 
Bible may cost only $20, but the values 
of lives changed for eternity cannot be 
measured. 
I am grateful the Bible teaches us 
who God is, about His character. I am 
also grateful the Bible tells us about 
the hope we can have in our eternal fu-
ture. Without that hope, I know I 
would feel lost. 
I love the verses where Jesus says: 
My Father’s house has many rooms; if that 
were not so, would I have told you that I am 
going there to prepare a place for you? And 
if I go and prepare a place for you, I will 
come back and take you to be with Me that 
you may also be where I am. 
There is eternal life. There is hope. 
I am thankful the Bible gives us di-
rections on how to live and provides a 
roadmap for life. Without that guid-
ance, again, I would feel lost. 
Also, I am thankful that the Bible 
gave me confidence in frightening mo-
ments. In one of my four deployments 
to the Middle East, I was deployed to 
Baghdad, where we were attacked 
every single day with mortars and 
rockets, sometimes 30 rockets or mor-
tars a day. People were being killed 
around me. 
God said in Matthew: Do not fear 
man who can take your life but not 
your soul. 
I meditated on that verse every day. 
My soul was secure, and God told me 
not to fear. In times of life, when 
things seem unfair, I am reminded of 
the words God gave the Apostle Paul 
when He said: ‘‘My grace is sufficient 
for you.’’ I have often had to be re-
minded that God’s grace has been suffi-
cient for me. 
b 1800 
Mr. Speaker, I will close with an 
anecdote from Abraham Lincoln, in my 
mind, our greatest President. 
In 1864, some former slaves from 
Maryland presented Lincoln with the 
gift of a Bible, and Lincoln replied: ‘‘In 
regards to this great Book, I have but 
to say it is the best gift God has given 
to man. All the good the Savior gave to 
the world was communicated through 
this Book.’’ 
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman, and I also thank him 
for his service to our country. We have 
many veterans who are serving in Con-
gress, and Representative BACON is one 
of the finest. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from South Carolina (Mr. NORMAN). 
Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, it is an 
honor to come before you today to cel-
ebrate National Bible Week. What bet-
ter time to celebrate Bible Week in 
what is called the people’s House, but 
what is ultimately God’s house. 
In 1941, President Franklin D. Roo-
sevelt issued a national proclamation 
to celebrate the impact of the Bible on 
our Nation, a light for so many and a 
source of hope in the darkest of times. 
The boundless influence of the Holy 
Bible on this Nation is unmistakable. 
In this Chamber, Moses, the mes-
senger of the Ten Commandments, a 
witness of God in all of his glory upon 
the mountaintop, watches over this 
body from above the gallery doors each 
time we gather to conduct business. 
However, it is not merely the mul-
titudes of honorary monuments and 
portraits of Biblical figures and pas-
sages that exemplify the importance of 
the Scriptures to all Americans, but it 
is the impression on our social fabric 
that is so evident in our actions, which 
speaks volumes. 
This Nation was founded upon Judeo- 
Christian principles. A stroll past any 
of the extraordinary monuments here 
in the Capitol makes that abundantly 
evident. Our commitment to the fun-
damentals of the Word of the Lord 
Jesus has sustained us throughout our 
rich history, during the highest of 
times and during the lowest of times. 
The profound impact of the Bible, 
and particularly the Gospels, led me to 
serve in this great body. It is the words 
of the Son of God, to ‘‘love each other 
as I have loved you,’’ which guides me. 
And I believe that if we continue to 
turn to the Lord in all that we do, our 
best is yet to come. 
Despite our fierce philosophical dif-
ferences and the imperfect nature of 
legislation, God never fails us. An an-
nual celebration of His infallible Word 
and never-ending love, though not near 
enough, is the perfect reminder for us 
to unite as a body with the shared goal 
of humbly serving our creator faith-
fully and encouraging this Nation to do 
the same. 
God bless each and every one of you. 
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman; he made some reference 
to here in the Capitol, some of the in-
signia that shows the recognition of 
God. 
Above the Speaker, it says, ‘‘In God 
We Trust.’’ That is chiseled in the 
stone there. 
Behind me, among all these lawgivers 
down through the centuries, Moses is 
there in the center looking straight on, 
over our deliberations. He gave us the 
Ten Commandments. 
So I appreciate, also, those historical 
references. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Alabama (Mr. PALMER), who is 
the policy chairman of the Republican 
Conference. 
Mr. PALMER. Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to thank the gentleman from Colo-
rado (Mr. LAMBORN) for hosting this 
special hour to talk about the Bible. 
Mr. Speaker, this year marks the 
419th anniversary of the King James 
Version of the Bible.

December 9, 2020 
In 1604, King James I commissioned 
54 scholars from Oxford and Cambridge 
Universities to produce one uniform 
translation of the Bible that all de-
nominations could accept. It is un-
likely that there has ever been another 
group of translators whose collective 
expertise in Biblical languages was 
equal to this group. 
Benson Bobrick, who wrote a book 
called ‘‘Wide as the Waters,’’ said, be-
cause of the people’s desire to read the 
Bible, the English translation, known 
as the Authorized Version in Great 
Britain, helped Great Britain become 
the most literate nation in the world. 
In terms of the language of the King 
James Version, about 90 percent are 
Anglo-Saxon words with a vocabulary 
of only about 8,000 words for the entire 
translation. It was the first major 
work of English prose based primarily 
on Anglo-Saxon words instead of Latin. 
The King James translation estab-
lished the prose style for English and 
American literature and became the 
foundation of modern English language 
giving us words and phrases that are 
common parts of our language today. 
In his ‘‘History of England,’’ Thomas 
Macaulay said that ‘‘ . . . if everything 
else in our language should perish, it 
would alone suffice to show the whole 
extent of its beauty and power.’’ 
Bobrick wrote: ‘‘Its subsequent im-
pact on English, and American, lit-
erature might be traced in a thousand 
ways—in the work of religious writers 
like Milton and Bunyan, or their more 
secular brethren like D.H. Lawrence, 
Walt Whitman, and Defoe. Without the 
King James Version, it has been said, 
‘there would be no ‘Paradise Lost,’ no 
‘Pilgrim’s Progress’ . . . no Gettysburg 
Address.’ ’’ 
As Britain’s literacy rate increased, 
it fostered a spirit of inquiry which led 
to people reading books and tracts that 
transformed the laws and government 
of Great Britain and ultimately laid 
the foundation for American political 
thought, and our Founders’ ideas about 
individual liberty and constitutional 
government. 
Including the 1611 edition, there were 
four other editions of the King James 
Bible, which were published in 1629, 
1638, 1762, and 1769; the last is the 
version that is most commonly cited 
today. 
‘‘Next to the Bible itself,’’ Bobrick 
wrote, ‘‘the English Bible was, and is, 
the most influential book ever pub-
lished.’’ 
According to Vanderbilt University 
Press, the King James Version is the 
best-selling book of all time, with more 
than 5 billion copies sold, and it is the 
most frequently quoted book ever writ-
ten. 
Russell Kirk concluded that it was 
the book that was to exert a stronger 
influence than any other in America. 
He wrote: ‘‘Read from American pul-
pits and in the great majority of Amer-
ican households during colonial times, 
the Authorized Version shaped the 
style, informed the intellect, affected 
the laws, and decreed the morals of the 
North American colonies.’’ 
P. Marion Simms wrote: ‘‘No nation 
in all history was ever founded by peo-
ple so dominated by the Bible as Amer-
ica.’’ In fact, every American President 
except Franklin Pierce has been sworn 
in with their hands placed on the 
English Bible. 
Even though it was published after 
the Jamestown Colony was established, 
the King James Bible was the book 
that had the greatest impact on the 
American culture. 
‘‘The English did not really drive 
away the American colonists, nor were 
they driven,’’ said G.K. Chesterton. 
‘‘The Americans were led on by a light 
that went before.’’ 
The light was the Biblical light that 
the English Bible had given them: the 
idea of the equality of man. It was the 
idea of the sacred and equal impor-
tance of every man, as made in the 
image and likeness of God. 
One of the earliest copies of the King 
James Version Bible can be seen at the 
Museum of the Bible. I encourage ev-
eryone to visit this great American 
museum. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank, again, Mr. 
LAMBORN, for this great opportunity. 
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for his comments. 
I would like to recall an incident 
from my own background. 
When I was a freshman in college 
years ago, some people talked to me, 
and they said: Do you know what the 
Bible is about? 
I said: Yeah, I know all about it. 
Although, I realized after a minute 
went by, that that was really a pretty 
presumptuous answer because I had 
never actually read anything in the 
Bible. 
Mr. Speaker, I wonder if this might 
be true for others who are listening in 
today. 
The only honest thing I could do at 
that point when I realized I hadn’t read 
any of it was to say: I am going to read 
the Bible for myself. 
So I started by reading the Gospel of 
John in the New Testament. And when 
I read it, I discovered that I hadn’t 
known at all what the Bible was about. 
I learned that Jesus said things like: 
I am the way, the truth, and the life. No 
one comes to the Father but through me. 
I ended up discovering a personal re-
lationship with Jesus Christ, who be-
came my Lord and Savior. 
Mr. Speaker, I speak from personal 
experience when I say that it is better 
to read the Bible for one’s self and not 
just take someone else’s word for it for 
what it says. My life has been trans-
formed by the truths that it holds. 
The message of the good news of 
Jesus is still transforming lives today. 
John 3:16: 
For God so loved to world that He gave His 
only begotten Son that whoever believes in 
Him should not perish but have eternal life. 
So as we celebrate National Bible 
Week, we celebrate the place that faith 
holds in both our private and public 
lives. The Bible’s message of hope is a 
powerful one of redemption and hope, 
and we cherish its message today. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Wisconsin (Mr. GROTHMAN). 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the Representative from Colo-
rado for putting together this fine cere-
mony for National Bible Week. 
Mr. Speaker, it is kind of fitting that 
we be here on the floor of the Congress. 
I am not sure how many people realize, 
in this day in which so many people 
run from the Bible, the degree to which 
the Bible itself had such a great influ-
ence on the building we stand in and in 
the room we stand in right here. 
Look in front of us: ‘‘In God We 
Trust.’’ 
For people who aren’t aware back 
home, around us we have the reliefs of 
23 wise men: Mason, Hannibal, Jus-
tinian, Hammurabi, Solon. But the one 
who gets the greatest place of honor 
behind us here is that of Moses, who, of 
course, wrote the first five books of the 
Bible. 
When you review the statements of 
our Founding Fathers, again and again 
you find statements of this. And I will 
lead off by quoting William Penn: 
I do declare to the whole world that we be-
lieve the Scriptures to contain a declaration 
of the mind and will of God. We accept the 
Bible as the Words of God himself. 
The first Chief Justice of the United 
States, John Jay, was the president of 
the American Bible Society. 
Can you imagine that happening 
today? You can barely become a Jus-
tice if you are a member of the Knights 
of Columbus. 
Noah Webster said: ‘‘Education is 
useless without the Bible.’’ Noah Web-
ster, of course, known as the father of 
American education. 
Again and again, people of that era 
learned to read by learning the Bible. 
When you review the statements or 
the Bible quotations of the early 
Founders, the Bible Book that they 
quoted the most was the Book of Deu-
teronomy, which is perhaps not sur-
prising, because in Deuteronomy were 
largely laid out a lot of the laws that 
eventually God’s people of Israel were 
to live under. So it is not surprising 
that Deuteronomy was quoted so fre-
quently. 
Early American Presidents like John 
Adams and, later, Abraham Lincoln, 
looked to the Bible as they declared 
days of fasting and prayer. 
Again, when we look in our history, 
there is no book that had more to do 
with the founding of our country and 
the type of country our forefathers an-
ticipated than the Bible, so it is only 
fitting that today we honor the Bible. 
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for his remarks. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Florida (Mr. SPANO). 
Mr. SPANO. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Congressman LAMBORN, and I appre-
ciate the opportunity to speak.

December 9, 2020 
celebration of National Bible Week, I 
was really, really excited. I was excited 
because it gives me the chance to talk 
about something very special to me. 
When I was a boy, I remember seeing 
my mother read her Bible daily at our 
kitchen table. Every now and then, I 
would look over her shoulder at her 
open Bible to see numerous passages 
underlined or highlighted, notes and 
prayers written in the margins. I also I 
remember my mom quoting verses 
from the Bible in response to the cir-
cumstances of our lives. 
b 1815 
As I grew, my mom encouraged me to 
read the Bible. She assured me it had 
the answers to life’s questions, how to 
live, how to treat others, how to know 
God’s plan for my life. Most impor-
tantly, it would show me how to con-
nect with God, how to have a relation-
ship with him that would change my 
life here on this Earth, but also in the 
life to come. 
Like many young people, I wasn’t a 
very good listener, so I didn’t give the 
Bible much attention in my early years 
until I hit a particularly hard stretch 
and was driven to my knees as a 
younger man. It was then that I re-
membered what my mother had told 
me, the Bible has the answers. 
I began spending time every day 
reading the Bible. I learned about how 
God created the Heavens and the 
Earth; how he created man with a free 
will and so would never force man to 
love or serve Him; how He called the 
Nation of Israel to be his chosen peo-
ple; how He sent his only son, Jesus, to 
live a perfect life and then to die a 
cruel death to pay the price for every 
man’s sin, if they would just accept 
Him and the forgiveness that He offers. 
These are important things. But the 
Bible also helps me today. It helps me 
know how to love and care for my wife 
and my children. It shows me how to 
love unlovable people, how to let ha-
tred go and to forgive, and how to have 
peace in my heart that passes all 
human understanding. It gives me hope 
on tough days, at times when I can’t 
understand what is happening around 
me. 
And now today, although it is hard to 
explain and probably as difficult to un-
derstand, after 30 years eating and 
drinking, figuratively, from the truth 
of the Bible, I can’t get enough of it. I 
can’t go even one day without it. My 
soul becomes hungry and thirsty. I be-
come weak and discouraged. You see, 
now I can’t live without this Book. It 
is absolute life to me. 
This is a crazy, messed up world, and 
it only makes sense to me when I see it 
through God’s lens when I see how the 
story ends and how He redeems this 
mess and reconciles man to Himself 
once and for all time. 
Yes, all of that is in this very special 
book called the Bible. And so, if you 
are searching for meaning today, if you 
are searching for truth, longing and 
thirsting for the answers to life’s most 
important questions, I encourage you 
to do the same thing that I was encour-
aged to do. Pick up this book and begin 
reading it every day. I promise you; it 
will change your life. The words and 
truth contained in it will give you hope 
and peace and purpose like you have 
never before experienced. 
I would like to take this last moment 
to thank you, God, for using the Bible 
to show me how to live, and, most im-
portantly, how to live forever. I love 
you. 
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for his heartfelt re-
marks, and I wish him the best in the 
future. 
Another reason why I believe that we 
can use our reason to believe in the 
Bible and not just blind faith—as some 
accuse us of who are believers—is ar-
chaeology. There are many archeo-
logical discoveries which have vali-
dated Biblical accounts, even accounts 
that weren’t believed in the first place, 
but later archaeology proved them to 
be true. 
This gives us trustworthiness that we 
ascribe to the Bible during this Na-
tional Bible Week. Archaeology has 
time and time again shown that Bib-
lical 
personalities, 
locations, 
and 
events actually existed in time and 
space. Claims by critics that a Biblical 
statement was simply made up have 
been debunked by later archeological 
discoveries more times than we can 
say. 
For instance, the discovery of the 
Dead Sea Scrolls in the late forties and 
fifties proved the credibility and au-
thority of Scripture. The discovery of 
those scrolls shine light on the oldest 
record of the worldwide flood and the 
longstanding authority and accuracy of 
all of the events of the Bible. 
Jewish archaeologist, Nelson Glueck, 
has said: It may be stated categorically 
that no archeological discovery has 
ever controverted or contradicted a 
Biblical reference. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. CONAWAY), who I am 
going to miss greatly as he retires and 
goes into a new life at the end of this 
year. I sat next to him in Armed Serv-
ices for 13 years up until now, and I 
cherish our relationship. He is someone 
that I deeply trust, and I acknowledge 
his integrity. 
Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my colleague from Colorado (Mr. LAM-
BORN) for those overly kind words, and 
I certainly appreciate his sentiments 
for my service. And I, too, will miss 
our Armed Services Committee hear-
ings and sitting beside him. He is a ter-
rific God-fearing man, and I am better 
for having known him in that regard. 
Mr. Speaker, I was blessed to be 
raised in a God-fearing Christian fam-
ily. Not everybody gets that blessing, 
but I did. I have never not known about 
the Bible or Christ or God throughout 
my entire life. 
My mother believed in being at 
church every single Sunday morning, 
regardless of the consequences or what-
ever else was going on. 
At the age of nine, I accepted Jesus 
Christ as my personal savior. And you 
can become a Christian with knowing a 
limited amount of the Bible, but I 
don’t believe you can lead a good Chris-
tian life without studying the Bible, 
without understanding God’s truths 
that are contained therein and the in-
struction that that gives us as to how 
to conduct our lives. 
Mr. Speaker, Second Timothy 3:16 
has already been quoted, but I will 
quote it again. It says: 
All Scripture is breathed out by God, the 
Word of God, and profitable for teaching, for 
reproof, for correction, and for training in 
righteousness, that the man of God may be 
competent, equipped for every good work. 
Mr. Speaker, this Nation is at a 
crossroads, and we are a divided Nation 
across a lot of lines, the partisan di-
vides we fight in this House day in and 
day out. There are other moral lines of 
which our Nation is divided across. The 
Bible is important because it is that 
one place where the truths never 
change. 
Customs come and go, ideologies 
come and go, but the truths of God 
don’t. So if we are to heed the instruc-
tions of our Founding Fathers, that 
John Adams said, as was mentioned, 
that are a moral and religious people, 
then we need a guidebook. We need an 
understanding of what those morals 
are based upon. If the morals are based 
upon what I think are correct or you 
think are correct, then that is a pretty 
flimsy stance to take. We need a 
foundational truth that is there re-
gardless of who is Speaker, regardless 
of who is President. God is always on 
that throne, and so, the Bible is obvi-
ously important for that regard. 
Mr. Speaker, there is a verse in Sec-
ond Chronicles that I think contains 
both a promise for our Nation and a so-
lution for our Nation. The backdrop on 
that was that the Nation of Israel, 
God’s 
chosen 
people, 
if 
you 
read 
through the Old Testament, they had a 
running narrative of where their hearts 
would be good, right with God, things 
would be going well, and then within a 
generation or two they would fall off, 
their hearts would get wrong with God, 
they would be doing things that would 
offend God and their mighty ways, and 
God would use awful, horrible things to 
reset that narrative, reset the Nation 
of Israel’s hearts, so that they could, in 
fact, be his chosen people. 
That tool is still in God’s toolbox. I 
believe the United States is a Nation of 
God’s chosen people. If you look at 
what our Nation has done over the last 
100 years, I would argue that no Nation 
on Earth has ever done as much good 
as we have done for the rest of the 
world and asks so little in return as 
this Nation. 
Mr. Speaker, I believe that is God’s 
divine mission for us as a people. But 
do we continue to be worthy of that 
mission? 
And I would argue that as God looks 
at this unblessable thing that is going

on in our Nation that we may be rap-
idly becoming unworthy of that mis-
sion. And if we lay that mantle down, 
if it is taken away from us, Mr. Speak-
er, who will pick it up? 
Russia, China, radical Islam? 
I don’t believe so. 
I believe it is important not only for 
America to continue to be that God- 
fearing Nation but also important for 
the rest of the world. 
That verse in Second Chronicles 7:14 
says: 
If my people, who are called by my name 
love themselves, turn from their wicked 
ways, seek my face and pray, then I will hear 
them in Heaven. I will forgive their sins, and 
I will heal their land. 
Our land needs healing. That is God’s 
promise. It is written in stone. God 
doesn’t change any of his promises. 
And that promise is available to us as 
a Nation. That is the promise. 
The solution, however, lies with us. 
We must be that people who will turn 
from our wicked ways, seek God’s face, 
pray, and then he will hear us from 
Heaven, he will heal our land, and for-
give our sins. 
Mr. Speaker, our land needs healing, 
probably more so than at any time 
since the Civil War. We are a divided 
Nation, and only God’s guidance and 
God’s divine intervention, I believe, 
can make that happen. We have to be, 
however, God’s instruments to make 
that happen. 
The Bible is important to me. It is 
important to our Nation. It is impor-
tant for the ongoing safety of this 
world. God bless each and every one of 
you. God bless Texas. And God bless 
the United States of America. 
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman, and I would like to say 
that this country is a better place be-
cause of your service. Thank you. 
Mr. Speaker, how much time do I 
have remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Colorado has 7 minutes re-
maining. 
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, quickly 
I am going to give a quote from one of 
our Presidents, our Founding Father, 
and then John Quincy Adams, the sixth 
President. 
George Washington said: It is impos-
sible to rightly govern a Nation with-
out God and the Bible. So he began a 
rich history of Presidents leaning on 
the Bible for wisdom and guidance. 
John Quincy Adams, the sixth Presi-
dent said: ‘‘The first and almost the 
only Book deserving of universal atten-
tion is the Bible.’’ So those are great 
quotes from some of our Founding Fa-
thers. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT), my friend 
and colleague. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my friend, my colleague, and my broth-
er in Christ for yielding and for hosting 
this Special Order. 
To follow up on what Congressman 
LAMBORN said, the very first book that 
the United States Congress authorized 
to be published at taxpayer expense 
was a book called the Bible. 
Not only that, I would also point to a 
quote, as there is a lot of talk about so-
cialism and how it would work in this 
country. 
Dostoevsky 
hypothesized 
about it at the end of the 1800s, and 
Solzhenitsyn didn’t hypothesize it, he 
lived what Dostoevsky said, and that 
is, the problem with socialism is not 
economic, the problem with socialism 
is atheism. And that is diametrically 
opposed to how this country was start-
ed. 
In fact, I had asked for the Congres-
sional Research Service to give me in-
formation about the role of the church 
and the Bible in our founding, and this 
is derived from that. 
The first Christian church services in 
this United States Capitol were held 
when the government moved to Wash-
ington in the fall of 1800. They were 
conducted in the Hall of the House. 
During church services the Speaker’s 
podium was used as a preacher’s pulpit. 
Within a year of his inauguration, 
President Jefferson began attending 
church services in the Chamber of the 
House of Representatives. Throughout 
his administration, Thomas Jefferson 
permitted and encouraged church serv-
ices in executive branch buildings. Ser-
mons regarding the Old and New Testa-
ments of the Bible were conducted in 
the Supreme Court Chambers while the 
judicial branch was located in the old 
north wing of the Capitol. 
And by the way, that was until the 
Supreme Court began to think of them-
selves as God, and at that time they 
said you can’t talk about God or you 
can’t be doing this kind of stuff in 
schools and other places. 
But the term ‘‘separation of church 
and state’’ was not found in the Con-
stitution, it was in a letter written by 
Thomas Jefferson to the Danbury Bap-
tists, in essence, saying, we are not 
going to pick a specific official denomi-
nation. 
President James Madison, who was 
often recognized as the author of much 
of our Constitution, followed Jeffer-
son’s example as President of coming 
to church in the Capitol and worship-
ping God here and using the Bible as 
the foundational support for that. 
If you look at President Abraham 
Lincoln’s second inaugural address, it 
is inscribed on the inside of the north 
wall of his memorial, he said of North 
and South, ‘‘Both read the same Bible, 
and pray to the same God; and each in-
vokes His aid against the other. It may 
seem strange that any men should dare 
to ask a just God’s assistance in wring-
ing their bread from the sweat of other 
men’s faces; but let us judge not that 
we be not judged.’’ 
But he goes on to ultimately say: 
‘‘Yet if God wills that it continue, 
until all the wealth piled by the bonds-
man’s 250 years of unrequited toil shall 
be sunk, and until every drop of blood 
drawn with the lash, shall be paid by 
another drawn with the sword, as was 
said 3,000 years ago,’’ in the Bible, ‘‘so 
still it must be said ‘the judgments of 
the Lord, are true and righteous alto-
gether.’’’ 
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman, and I would I yield to 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
LAMALFA). 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I appre-
ciate the recognition of National Bible 
Week by my namesake from Colorado, 
Douglas Lamborn, for always being so 
faithful to this. 
Christians believe the Bible is the di-
vine and inherent Word of God. I be-
lieve that. And we hear a lot of things 
in this society today that would try to 
denigrate that, denigrate the faith, 
and, indeed, there is nothing wrong 
with what the Bible says as a guidance 
for life. 
b 1830 
The Ten Commandments: there is 
nothing wrong with living by those 
even if you don’t believe in the Bible. 
It is indeed, we know, the best seller, 
the most quoted, a treasure for all of 
us to go by. 
So as I contemplate here what we are 
doing tonight, I just want to leave you 
with this as a guidance for working in 
this town, in Proverbs 4:23–27: 
Watch over your heart with all diligence, 
for from it flow the springs of life. 
Rid yourself of a deceitful mouth and keep 
devious speech far from you. 
Let your eyes look directly ahead and let 
your gaze be fixed straight in front of you. 
Keep straight paths of your feet, and all 
your ways will be established. 
Do not turn to the right or to the left; turn 
your foot from evil. 
Indeed, if we could do more of that 
around here, we would be much better 
off. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman 
for yielding to me. 
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for his great words. 
In conclusion, it has been an honor to 
commemorate National Bible Week 
this evening. I am grateful to my col-
leagues who joined me. 
The Bible claims to be more than a 
mere book. It claims to be the inspired 
words of God. As it says in the first 
book of Peter: 
All flesh is like grass and all its glory like 
the flower of grass. The grass withers and 
the flower falls off, but the word of the Lord 
abides forever. 
So I am thankful for the Word of God 
on my life and all the lives of those 
who have spoken today. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7102 
December 9, 2020 
First Congressional District for giving 
me the honor to serve these last few 
years, and also my incredible staff, who 
both here and in Iowa have given their 
all to Iowa and to this country. You 
have made me proud every single day 
to know you. 
Importantly, I also want to say 
thank you to my family: my husband, 
Daniel, who has been my rock and been 
with me every step of the way; to my 
siblings and nieces and nephews, who 
have taught me to never take myself 
too seriously; and to my parents, who I 
know are watching right now because, 
as I found out within the first 6 months 
of being in Congress, they actually 
DVR and record C–SPAN every day so 
that they can find me on the floor dur-
ing votes. 
You know, I think back to the day 
that they came to visit right before 
swearing in. My very first visitors to 
my congressional office, where my dad, 
Jerry, a UA retired union pipefitter 
welder, and my mom, a retired public 
school 
secretary, 
held 
hands 
and 
walked through the door of their 29- 
year-old daughter’s congressional of-
fice. 
I can’t imagine what they thought, 
but I hope it was better than when I 
told them and sat them down at the 
age of 24 and said I was running for 
Iowa’s State House, where my mom 
blurted out, ‘‘Why in the heck are you 
doing that?’’ 
Well, it has been 71⁄2 years since mom 
asked that question, and I hope every 
day they have seen the answer. 
The reason I entered public service 
was because of them. You see, my par-
ents couldn’t give me a trust fund or 
debt-free college, but what they gave 
me was worth a hell of a lot more. 
They taught me about treating peo-
ple with respect, and seeing work to be 
done and doing it; about standing up 
for those who need a voice; and, most 
importantly, to never think you are 
better than anyone else no matter 
what you do or where you go. 
The work I have done both in Iowa 
and here in Congress has been shaped 
by the stories and the lives of my con-
stituents and my family, from my late 
grandfathers, one a firefighter and one 
a Purple Heart World War II vet who 
worked in a meat packing plant, to my 
uncles; from a former UPS driver to a 
small business owner; and my mother- 
in-law and my sister-in-law, both who 
are heroes and nurses. 
Because of them, my fight for work-
ing families, wage protections, collec-
tive bargaining, paid leave, workplace 
protections, have continued to be, in 
every sense of the word, personal, and 
that is the way policy should be. 
These laws we pass—and, unfortu-
nately on some occasions don’t pass be-
cause of stalemates—aren’t just dollars 
and cents on a page. They are affecting 
people’s lives. 
I hope for this body and for the 
American people that we can have a 
Congress and a Senate who sees that 
and understands the value of public 
service. 
Until we get there fully, I hope that 
young people across the country find 
their ‘‘why’’ and run. We need you. And 
when you get here, I hope you do the 
work and I hope you find an incredible 
staff like I did to help you do it. 
You see, this place is not about the 
crystal chandeliers or the fancy titles. 
It is about the work. It is about the 
people in your district. It is about find-
ing common ground where you can and 
just getting things done. 
I have been proud to get to work with 
my staff the way that we did passing 
my first bill within the first 2 weeks, 
becoming the youngest woman in the 
history of this body to ever pass a bill 
through this floor; to working on the 
Small Business Committee and begin-
ning to chair the Rural Development, 
Ag, Trade and Entrepreneurship Sub-
committee, where we got to fight for 
things like better access to markets for 
our farmers and for our small business 
owners; 
to 
stepping 
up 
for 
our 
childcare workers, who need it most 
right now; and the work that we did on 
that Transportation and Infrastructure 
Committee, along with the honorable 
Chairman DEFAZIO, getting to help 
pass some of the best investments in 
rural infrastructure that has ever come 
out of either one of these Chambers; to 
standing here, I think in this very spot, 
having to fight back against attacks on 
Davis-Bacon wages, good wage protec-
tions, in the middle of a pandemic; to 
helping our farmers, our biofuel indus-
tries, trying to fight for and also get-
ting done the biodiesel tax credit ex-
tender; to, again, one of the things I 
might be most proud of, standing here 
sharing a story that was hard to tell 
about 
my 
own 
battle 
with 
endo-
metriosis, and then fighting and work-
ing with my staff to help double that 
funding for research that had been at 
the bottom of the National Institutes 
of Health’s research for years. 
I also just want to say a special 
thank you to the staff in Iowa, who 
have been there for my constituents in 
one of the toughest years we’ve ever 
had, this pandemic, where they have 
taken calls from folks wondering about 
their unemployment checks, wondering 
about how they are going to be able to 
feed their family because they are un-
employed right now through no fault of 
their own, to then, on top of it, going 
almost 2 weeks without electricity 
post-derecho in my district, which was 
basically like a Category 4 hurricane 
that came through and decimated large 
parts of my district. 
The way that my staff stepped up 
when, again, they themselves didn’t 
even have electricity or WiFi is ex-
traordinary. You make me proud every 
day. 
And the way that my constituents 
came together, it made me proud to be 
a Congresswoman and to be an Iowan. 
You see, I, again, just want to say 
one last big thank you to my staff. You 
are all incredible public servants that I 
am blessed to have known and some of 
the best public servants I have ever 
met. And I should know, because I met 
one of the best. 
That late grandfather I talked about, 
that firefighter, he was the one who 
taught me what all of this was. You 
see, he is the guy that I would sit 
around the kitchen table with when I 
was 10 talking about what was hap-
pening in the world. And he is also the 
guy that taught me what public service 
should be. You see, when he would run 
into a burning building to save people’s 
lives, he didn’t call and ask first: What 
color is your skin? Where are you 
from? Who do you love? What language 
do you speak? 
He just showed up and he helped peo-
ple, and he did his job. 
That is what I have tried to do here 
every single day, both here in Congress 
and my 4 years in the State House in 
Iowa. It is what I will continue to do in 
whatever I do next. 
It has been an honor and a privilege 
to get to serve in this body and rep-
resent this district and this country. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

RECOGNIZING MISSISSIPPI’S LINE-
MEN 
AND 
POWER 
COMPANIES 
FOLLOWING HURRICANE ZETA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman 
from 
Mississippi 
(Mr. 
PALAZZO) for 30 minutes. 
Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Speaker, today I 
rise in recognition of the linemen of 
Mississippi. 
Following the recent Hurricane Zeta, 
almost 100,000 homes in our area were 
left without power due to the heavy 
rains and winds. 
Nearly 1,000 of Mississippi’s linemen 
jumped to action to serve their neigh-
bors during our time of need. These 
storm teams are expertly trained and 
well-equipped to reinstate normalcy 
following a storm, and I am proud to 
acknowledge their work here today. 
As one of America’s most dangerous 
jobs, these individuals go to work 
knowing they serve a critical cause 
providing the power that empowers our 
daily lives. 
So when you make a call to a loved 
one, use hot water, turn on an air-con-
ditioner, or stay up to date on the 
news, remember the brave linemen who 
make these services possible. 
Mr. Speaker, I also want to take a 
moment to thank Mississippi Power, 
Coast 
Electric 
Power 
Association, 
Singing River Electric Power Com-
pany, Pearl River Valley Electric Com-
pany, Dixie Electric Power Associa-
tion, and the many other workers with-
in Mississippi and from out of State 
who banded together to restore power 
back to our area. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to 
join me in expressing our gratitude to 
these unsung heroes. Without them, 
our future would be a lot less bright.

RECOGNIZING THE MISSISSIPPI 1A STATE CHAM-
PION
FOOTBALL
TEAM, 
LUMBERTON
HIGH 
SCHOOL 
Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of a high school 
football team within the Fourth Dis-
trict of Mississippi that now can claim 
the prestigious title of State Cham-
pions. 
The Lumberton Panthers defeated 
Biggersville High School, 20–14, at Mis-
sissippi Veterans Memorial Stadium. 
This is the Panthers’ fifth State title 
in school history and the first State 
title for head coach Zach Jones. 
Their win was secured with just 24 
seconds left of play and a tied score-
board after senior receiver K’nylan 
Willis carried a touchdown pass from a 
junior 
quarterback 
named 
Rodney 
Parker. 
The Panthers were 12–1 this season, a 
record to be proud of. 
2020 has brought many challenges to 
our Nation and has not left our stu-
dents and sports teams untouched. 
In my opinion, there are few things 
better than a community coming to-
gether to celebrate the resilience and 
strength of young athletes. 
Congratulations again to Lumberton 
High School, all of their players, 
coaches, staff, and many supporters. 
This will truly be a football season to 
remember. 
RECOGNIZING THE MISSISSIPPI 5A STATE CHAM-
PION
FOOTBALL
TEAM, WEST
JONES
HIGH 
SCHOOL 
Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of a high school 
football team within the Fourth Dis-
trict of Mississippi that now can claim 
the prestigious title of State Cham-
pions. 
The West Jones Mustangs defeated 
West Point High School, 33–27, at Mis-
sissippi Veterans Memorial Stadium. 
This is the Mustangs’ first State title 
in school history and for head coach 
Scott Pierson, a 27-year coaching vet-
eran. 
The Mustangs were behind with 50 
seconds to go when senior quarterback, 
Alan Follis, rushed 63 yards for the 
touchdown. 
West Jones’ season concluded with a 
13–2 record, showing that, even in 
times of adversity, victory is possible. 
Seeing a group of young athletes 
come together to rise above the chal-
lenges they face and a community cir-
cle around them is very special, espe-
cially in a year like 2020. 
Congratulations again to West Jones 
High School, all of their players, 
coaches, staff, and many supporters. I 
am sure this will be a season they 
never forget.

RECOGNIZING OAK GROVE HIGH SCHOOL ON 
STATE CHAMPIONSHIP 
Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of a high school 
football team within the Fourth Dis-
trict of Mississippi that now can claim 
the prestigious title of State cham-
pions. 
The Oak Grove Warriors, led by Head 
Coach Drew Causey, defeated Oxford 
High School, 29–28, at Mississippi Vet-
erans Memorial Stadium. This is the 
Warriors’ second State title in school 
history. 
The Warriors were 1 point behind 
with 7.1 seconds to go after a touch-
down when junior quarterback Kabe 
Barnett made the split-second decision 
not to kick the extra point to take the 
game 
into 
overtime 
and, 
instead, 
rushed 10 yards for a 2-point conversion 
to win the game. 
Oak Grove Warriors’ season con-
cluded with a 13–0 record, a perfect sea-
son even in the midst of so much un-
certainty in the world. 
These young athletes have risen 
above all the chaos that 2020 and the 
COVID–19 pandemic has brought. They 
have shown great strength and leader-
ship and brought a community to-
gether in a divided time. 
Congratulations again to Oak Grove 
High School, all of their players, 
coaches, staff, and many supporters. 
2020 will truly be a season to remem-
ber. 
HONORING 2020 BLUE RIBBON SCHOOLS IN FOURTH 
DISTRICT OF MISSISSIPPI 
Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
recognition today of two Mississippi el-
ementary schools that were awarded 
the 2020 National Blue Ribbon Schools 
award. This prestigious award is given 
in acknowledgment of overall progress 
and closing achievement gaps and/or 
being among the State’s highest per-
forming schools. 
The first school was Popp’s Ferry El-
ementary School, located in Biloxi, 
Mississippi. Popp’s Ferry is a title I 
school for kindergarten through third 
grade, serving 500 students. 
I want to congratulate the principal 
at the time of the nomination, Dr. 
Todd Boucher; the current principal, 
Dr. 
Vivian 
Malone; 
Biloxi 
Public 
Schools 
Superintendent 
Marcus 
Boudreaux; as well as all members of 
the Popp’s Ferry faculty and staff. 
The second school is D’Iberville Ele-
mentary School in D’Iberville, Mis-
sissippi. D’Iberville Elementary is a 
title I school for kindergarten through 
fourth grade, serving more than 700 
students. This is their second Blue Rib-
bon Schools award, having previously 
been honored in 2009. 
I want to congratulate Principal 
Cindy 
Dusang, 
Harrison 
County 
Schools Superintendent Roy Gill, and 
all D’Iberville Elementary faculty and 
staff members. 
It is an honor that two of the four 
Mississippi schools awarded the Na-
tional Blue Ribbon Schools award call 
the Fourth District of Mississippi 
home. 
Mississippi 
is 
fortunate 
to 
have 
schools and educators dedicated to pre-
paring the next generation. So con-
gratulations again to Popp’s Ferry and 
D’Iberville elementary schools on this 
incredible achievement. 
RECOGNIZING THE CAREER OF RUPERT H. LACY 
Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Speaker, today, I 
rise to recognize a true leader of Mis-
sissippi for his outstanding career of 
service, Mr. Rupert H. Lacy. 
Mr. Lacy has served as the director 
of emergency management, homeland 
security, and e-911 for Harrison Coun-
ty, Mississippi, for 13 years. 
He was appointed director in Decem-
ber 2007 and has been responsible for a 
wide range of public safety activities, 
including emergency planning, hazard 
mitigation, 
emergency 
communica-
tions disaster response, and recovery 
for Mississippi’s second most populous 
county, comprised of five cities and 
more than 200,000 residents. 
A native Mississippian, Mr. Lacy was 
touched by disasters growing up and 
saw the chaos they could cause first-
hand. 
In the late 1970s, he started as a vol-
unteer firefighter but has served in 
many capacities since then, including 
deputy director of Harrison County 
Emergency Management, warden of 
Leake County Correctional Facility, 
captain of support services for Harrison 
County 
Sheriff’s 
Department, 
and 
training officer for Harrison County 
Sheriff’s Department. 
An expert in all-hazards comprehen-
sive emergency management, Mr. Lacy 
has been a leader on several high-pro-
file incident management teams and 
delegations. 
During Hurricane Katrina in 2005, he 
served as logistics section chief. From 
2008 until 2020, Mr. Lacy served as co- 
chairman of the National Hurricane 
Conference’s response committee, help-
ing scores of coastal communities 
share their best practices and lessons 
learned. 
He is detail-oriented, organized, and 
prioritizes safety above all, which is 
precisely the type of person you want 
running point during hurricane season 
or an unprecedented pandemic. 
Mr. Lacy was mentored by the late 
former Harrison County Emergency 
Services director, Wade Guice, and has 
since 
continued 
this 
tradition 
of 
mentorship with his coworkers and all 
who come in contact with him. 
When asked about Mr. Lacy, many of 
his coworkers responded that he is a 
strong father figure in their lives and 
has taught them so much through his 
positive example. 
After many years of faithful and dis-
tinguished service, Mr. Lacy retired as 
EMA director on December 1, 2020. 
A resident of Saucier, Mississippi, he 
is married to Ivy Lacy and is the proud 
father and grandfather of three chil-
dren, four grandchildren, and three 
great-grandchildren, who all certainly 
enjoy the extra time with him. 
We thank his family for being so un-
derstanding of his long hours spent 
serving others. Over the door in his of-
fice, Mr. Lacy kept a plaque that said: 
‘‘Remembering the past and working in 
the present to protect the future of 
Harrison County.’’ 
It is safe to say he lived this creed 
well. Mr. Lacy’s length and breadth of 
experience in public safety are to be 
applauded.

I know many join me in wishing him 
a happy and restful retirement. It is 
my honor and privilege to recognize 
the remarkable career of Mr. Rupert H. 
Lacy. 
HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF STAFF 
SERGEANT ROBERT E. CARTER 
Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Speaker, today, I 
rise to recognize the legacy and the 
outstanding life of service of Purple 
Heart recipient Staff Sergeant Robert 
E. Carter. 
He was born September 2, 1986, in San 
Luis Obispo, California, to Rick and 
Linda Carter. Staff Sergeant Carter at-
tended Rio Vista High School and San 
Joaquin Delta College as a firefighter 
for a degree in fire science. He was also 
in the process of completing his bach-
elor of science in public health at The 
University of Southern Mississippi in 
Hattiesburg, Mississippi. 
Staff Sergeant Carter joined the 
United States Army on April 25, 2007, 
and attended training at Fort Benning, 
Georgia, where he graduated as an 11 
Bravo Infantryman. 
Staff Sergeant Carter’s first deploy-
ment was in 2007 to Baghdad under the 
Dagger Brigade in support of Operation 
Iraqi Freedom. 
His second deployment was from No-
vember 2008 to November 2009 for Oper-
ation Iraqi Freedom as a rifle team 
leader and platoon designated marks-
man in charge of Small Denial Team’s 
counteroffensive for IEDs. It was dur-
ing this deployment on April 5, 2009, 
that he sustained injuries from an IED 
explosion while conducting dismounted 
clearance of a hostile village in Balad 
Ruz, Iraq. 
His final deployment was in July 2011 
to Afghanistan in support of Operation 
Enduring Freedom. During this deploy-
ment, he created and implemented the 
Afghanistan National Army’s sniper 
course. 
His last assignment before retire-
ment was to serve as a sniper-observer 
course trainer. 
A few of Staff Sergeant Carter’s 
awards and decorations included: Pur-
ple Heart, Army Commendation Medal, 
Army Achievement Medal, Valorous 
Unit Award, National Defense Service 
Medal, Afghanistan Campaign Medal, 
Iraq Campaign Medal, Global War on 
Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, NATO 
Medal, Expert Infantryman Badge, and 
Combat Infantryman Badge. 
He earned each of these accolades 
and will be remembered for his unwav-
ering service to his country. 
Staff Sergeant Carter was laid to rest 
on October 19, 2020, at the Sacramento 
Valley National Cemetery. 
He is survived by his fiancee, Erica 
Farmer. Staff Sergeant Carter was a 
beloved son, brother, and friend to all 
who knew him. 
He accomplished more in just his 34 
years on this Earth than most do in a 
lifetime. I had the pleasure of meeting 
with and presenting Staff Sergeant 
Carter with his Purple Heart award on 
January 24, 2020. 
He was a true American hero, moti-
vated by the love of his fellow man. We 
are all indebted to the sacrifices he 
made through his unwavering commit-
ment to boldly defending our country. 
It is an honor to recognize Staff Ser-
geant Robert E. Carter’s life and legacy 
of service. 
HONORING THE WORKS OF CANNIE LEE CODY 
Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the outstanding career 
of service of Mr. Cannie Lee Cody. 
Mr. Cody hails from Jacksonville, 
Florida, and volunteered at 18 years old 
to serve his country in the United 
States Coast Guard. 
After a few years, he decided to fol-
low the path to become a detective. At 
the age of 29, Mr. Cody graduated as 
valedictorian from the Duval County 
Patrol Academy. He served as a high-
way patrolman for 5 years, eventually 
reaching the rank of detective sergeant 
at the Duval County Sheriff’s Office. 
In the 1960s, riots began to break out 
in Jacksonville, Florida. One riot oc-
curred on March 23, 1964, and on that 
evening, Mrs. Johnnie Mae Chappell, a 
mother of 10, was shot and killed. Mrs. 
Chappell had returned home by bus and 
then walked to a local store. Upon ar-
riving home, she realized she had left 
her wallet and went to look for it along 
the highway. 
According to witnesses, a dark sedan 
slowed down and a shot was fired from 
the vehicle, which killed Mrs. Chappell. 
The case was left open and unsolved. 
Five months later, Mr. Cody and his 
partner encountered a young man who 
they suspected was involved in the 
murder. This encounter led them to 
three other assailants who also con-
fessed to Mrs. Chappell’s murder. 
By this time, they had tracked down 
the murder weapon and enough evi-
dence to close the case. They gave the 
uncovered information to the chief of 
police, but sadly, they were removed 
from the case and lost their jobs a year 
later. 
Mr. Cody had spent the following dec-
ades trying to get justice for Mrs. 
Chappell and her family. For years, he 
sought vindication and to expose the 
corruption of the officials involved. 
Mr. Cody went on to write a book 
called ‘‘The 14th Denial: A Civil Rights 
Memoir,’’ which inspired the movie 
‘‘Wanted Justice: Johnnie Mae Chap-
pell.’’ Both the book and movie are 
thought-provoking and share an in-
credibly important story. 
For his service, Mr. Cody is being 
honored by the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs for his dedication to our 
country and the civil rights movement. 
Mr. Cody has spent his life fighting 
for what is right and serving others. It 
is an honor to recognize the heroic ca-
reer of service of Mr. Cannie Lee Cody. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
f 
CAPITOL HILL CHRISTMAS 
PAGEANT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. ROY) for 30 
minutes. 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman from Mississippi for his 
great remarks about these wonderful 
heroes, men and women in uniform who 
served our country valiantly overseas 
and here in law enforcement. 
I had the honor of attending the fu-
neral of a constituent who passed away 
when the helicopter went down in Sinai 
a few weeks back because he was one of 
my constituents in San Antonio, and it 
was a great celebration of his life. 
I want to thank the gentleman from 
Mississippi for honoring these great 
folks, your constituents in Mississippi. 
I appreciate it. 
Mr. Speaker, here we are, as predict-
able as Christmas. We are at it again, 
a 7-day continuing resolution, which 
the American people look at in wonder 
and amazement during the Christmas 
season, that every year their illus-
trious leaders in the House of Rep-
resentatives can find their way to be 
even more incompetent, year to year, 
in how we conduct the affairs of this 
great Nation. 
We might as well call these funding 
debacles the Capitol Hill Christmas 
Pageant. We show up. We put on a 
show. We sell out the American people. 
We close up and head home. And we do 
it like clockwork. 
I don’t know if anybody has noticed, 
but we are almost at $28 trillion in 
debt. We are blowing past our gross do-
mestic product, a general sign in his-
tory of a nation in decline, which none 
of us, of course, would want to ac-
knowledge that the United States of 
America would be facing. 
b 1900 
I am in amazement as I watch my 
colleagues 
running 
around 
talking 
about budget caps. I am a fan of budget 
caps, but there are no budget caps here. 
Anyone who is talking about budget 
caps, going over them or going under 
them, we don’t adhere to budget caps. 
We set budget caps in 2011, and had we 
adhered to them we would have saved 
almost $800 billion since then. 
But what do we do? We have these 
deals. We come together. We jack up 
the budget caps. We blow out spending 
in defense. We blow out nondefense dis-
cretionary spending. And then we all 
kind of wave at each other and com-
plain about spending and go home. 
That is we do. 
What are we going to do next week? 
We are going to spend another $1.4 tril-
lion, which, again, will bust existing 
caps by at least a little, and then some 
will jockey around about that, about 
whether we should save the $12 billion 
and try to adhere to those caps, forget-
ting the fact that we are $300 billion 
over the 2011 caps. In other words, 
there are no caps. 
We have already spent $2.6 trillion on 
COVID relief spending. 
So what does that mean next year, 
Mr. Speaker? We are blowing past $30 
trillion in debt.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7105 
December 9, 2020 
Think about it. Yes, tonight con-
stituents 
back 
home, 
or 
anybody 
watching, the 14 people watching C– 
SPAN right now, there is nobody else 
in the Chamber. This is our version of 
debate, Mr. Speaker. This is what our 
constituents’ House of Representatives, 
their people’s House, this is what we 
do. This is what debate looks like. 
So we are continuing to spend money 
that we don’t have, and we are going to 
now debate another COVID relief bill, 
another trillion-dollar bill. 
But we refuse to help the people gov-
ernment is actually running over. We 
are not helping the small businesses 
that governments across this country 
are using their power to shut down. 
Small businesses are getting destroyed 
by government tyranny. 
Now, you can say, Mr. Speaker, and 
pat yourself on the back that it is in 
the name of public health, and every-
body can go back home and say: Oh, 
aren’t we nice. But you are shutting 
people’s livelihoods down and walking 
away, and yet this body is refusing to 
do anything about it. 
I was proud to work with my Demo-
cratic colleague DEAN
PHILLIPS
this 
last summer to pass the PPP Flexi-
bility Act to try to keep a lot of these 
businesses alive. I was thanked by hun-
dreds, if not thousands, of people in my 
district for doing so. But what good is 
that if we are failing them now? 
Mr. Speaker, 100,000 restaurants are 
already closed, and 10,000 more res-
taurants have closed since our last sur-
vey in July. Forty percent of remain-
ing restaurants were closed without 
more support. Jobs at bars and res-
taurants are down 2 million this year. 
Seventy-one percent of hotels report 
they will only be able to last 6 more 
months, and 63 hotels have less than 
half of pre-crisis staff. 
Forty percent of small business own-
ers report they will close in the next 12 
months if things do not improve. 
What did the Speaker of the House 
do? The Speaker of the House admitted 
that she withheld relief from small 
businesses and struggling workers for 
political gamesmanship. She acknowl-
edged it. She said it. 
Why aren’t we debating that? Why 
aren’t we having conversations about 
that? Why aren’t we debating a clean 
PPP bill right now? 
This Chamber is empty. We just ad-
journed, passing a 7-week CR that 
blows our spending out of proportion, 
setting up the table for next week 
doing the same thing for a year, and 
this Chamber is empty. Everyone is 
flying home. It is absurd. 
The American people look at this 
every day, and they wonder what in the 
world, and now we are going to pass a 
$1 trillion bill that bails out, in many 
cases, the very State and local govern-
ments that are shutting down these 
local businesses with their tyrannical 
activity. 
More than that, when we actually 
spend the money, we are going to fund 
the very institutions that are crushing 
the American way of life. We fund, as I 
said, the tyrant mayors and city coun-
cils, like Mayor Adler in Austin, Texas, 
who are killing small businesses. The 
good 
mayor 
had 
the 
unbelievable 
hutzpah to record a video in Cabo San 
Lucas telling Austin residents to stay 
home. 
We fund the very schools that are 
failing our kids, the very schools that 
are locking down our kids from an edu-
cation. Suicide rates are up, failing 
grades are up, fear levels are up among 
our children, and the very schools that 
are indoctrinating our kids to hate this 
country and what it stands for, to 
apologize for this country, to declare 
this country is evil, to tear down the 
statues in this country, the very edu-
cation system doing that, we are going 
to fund, while we blow past caps, pass-
ing to those very children a massive 
amount of debt. 
We fund the very local governments 
that are defunding police but expect 
them to enforce lockdowns. 
We fund corporate cronyism by giv-
ing a bailout that undeniably favored 
massive retail corporations that can 
absorb the costs that small businesses 
can’t. Mom-and-pop shops are getting 
killed, and great big companies are 
getting rich. 
Where is this body? It is nowhere to 
be found, an empty Chamber. 
We just passed a defense bill yester-
day that will burden those small busi-
nesses even further with potentially 
more regulations. 
Mr. Speaker, you can’t even make 
this up. 
A defense bill has language in there 
that will hurt small businesses even 
when they are at their low point get-
ting beat up by a virus and tyrants are 
shutting them down. 
We fund an immigration system that 
fails immigrants, fails Americans, em-
powers cartels, and is a national em-
barrassment while we have people who 
are held hostage in homes in this coun-
try by cartel-driven illegal enterprises. 
It is happening right now at our border, 
and this body is empty. Mr. Speaker, 
67,000 people were apprehended at our 
border in October. 
Where is this Chamber talking about 
anything about border security? It 
would be better for immigrants and 
better for our country, but we won’t do 
it. 
We fund a massive healthcare system 
that reduces doctor availability but 
empowers insurance companies, and we 
are doing it by the second. You have to 
ask an insurance company about how 
to get healthcare. 
Why? Because this body is failing. 
We fund ongoing conflict in Afghani-
stan, Iraq, Syria, and on and on and on 
in myriad countries around the world— 
I can’t even count them—despite not 
having passed an authorization of force 
in almost 20 years. 
World War II, Mr. Speaker, went 
from December 7, 1941, to August of 
1945. We have kids today enlisting in 
the military who were not alive when 
we passed the authorization of force in 
2001 under which they are operating. 
What kind of a people’s body is it 
that won’t even debate an authoriza-
tion of force? We are nowhere to be 
found. 
Steak dinners or on airplanes flying 
home right now, that is where the 400 
colleagues are—if they were even here 
in the first place, because they have 
been voting by proxy from home sit-
ting on boats. 
We fund election systems that fail us. 
What is this House doing to ensure 
election integrity? 
There is a lot of politics flying 
around the air right now about elec-
tions, but do you believe in our elec-
tions, I ask the ladies and gentlemen 
who are watching this. Do they believe 
every vote is counted? Do they believe 
that every vote was legal? 
In 2012, The New York Times admit-
ted that mail-in ballots are a problem. 
Votes cast by mail are less likely to be 
counted, 
more 
likely 
to 
be 
com-
promised, and more likely to be con-
tested than those cast in a voting 
booth, statistics show. Election offi-
cials reject almost 2 percent of ballots 
cast by mail, double the rate for in-per-
son voting. 
The Carter-Baker Commission—that 
is former President Jimmy Carter and 
former Secretary of State Jim Baker— 
was formed in 2005: ‘‘Absentee ballots 
remain the largest source of potential 
voter fraud’’—bipartisan, 2005. 
Citizens who vote at home, at nurs-
ing homes, at the workplace, or in 
church are more susceptible to pres-
sure, overt and subtle, or intimidation. 
Vote buying schemes are far more dif-
ficult to detect when citizens vote by 
mail—bipartisan, Jimmy Carter, Jim 
Baker. 
Why won’t we even talk about it 
here? Why are we making this all 
about the President, not the President, 
the votes? 
We had a massive increase in mail-in 
ballots this year, and we are wondering 
whether our election system is even 
working. 
Examples of known fraud: In 2016, 83 
registered voters in San Pedro, Cali-
fornia, received absentee ballots at the 
same small, two-bedroom apartment. 
Prosecutors rarely pursue this type of 
case. 
In 2018, a North Carolina congres-
sional case, a Republican operative, 
McCrae Dowless, Jr., had allegedly re-
quested more than 1,200 absentee bal-
lots on voters’ behalf and then col-
lected the ballots in voters’ homes. 
In 2017, an investigation of a Dallas 
city council election found some 700 
fraudulent mail-in ballots signed by 
the same witness using a fake name. 
I could go on and on. There are prob-
lems with mail-in ballots. 
What did we just see this year, Mr. 
Speaker? In Georgia, 2016 general elec-
tion, 208,000 mail-in ballots; this year, 
1.3 million mail-in ballots. In Arizona, 
2016, they had 2.4 million mail-in bal-
lots; this year, 3.6 million mail-in bal-
lots. Pennsylvania, 2016, 314,000 mail-in

ballots; this year, 3.1 million mail-in 
ballots. 
I am not suggesting that I know what 
the numbers should or shouldn’t be in 
Georgia, Pennsylvania, or Arizona in 
this case. What I am suggesting is that 
even minor changes in rejection rates 
on these ballots—of which there are 
very large questions right now about 
the rejection rates—would impact the 
election. 
Regardless of what you want to see 
happen with the election, Mr. Speaker, 
do you not want to know that you can 
believe in your election? 
Why are we not holding hearings? 
Have we had a hearing this week on 
this, bipartisan, calling it in, making 
sure that we believe in our elections? Is 
the Senate holding hearings? 
The American people are raising le-
gitimate questions about our elections, 
and this body is missing in action and 
doing nothing. 
But I will tell you where Congress is, 
Mr. Speaker. It is passing bills like 
yesterday which amount to political 
garbage masquerading as defense au-
thorization. 
We passed the defense authorization 
bill which does, in fact, contain criti-
cally important components to support 
America’s troops but, in fact, actually 
fails our troops in many respects. 
Mr. Speaker, we were all told to vote 
for it, you see. We were told to vote for 
it because you can’t vote against a de-
fense authorization bill because you 
are voting against pay increases and 
you are voting against badly needed re-
sources for your men and women in 
uniform. Yet the people telling us to 
vote for it have no qualms about hold-
ing our Armed Forces’ pay hostage 
with no ability to amend the bill on 
the floor and no ability to debate the 
bill. 
Has anybody seen an amendment 
brought down here to the floor, an open 
amendment, saying: ‘‘Hey, I am Con-
gressman ROY. I have got an amend-
ment, and I would like to offer it?’’ Has 
that ever happened in this body? Has 
anybody ever seen that happen down 
here? 
It doesn’t happen. 
We fund 20-year wars with no clear 
mission and no clear end date. We fund 
a war that is now older than millions 
of young Americans signing up to fight 
in it, as I said before. 
This defense authorization bill has a 
cheap diversity officer and other race- 
based programs in it, which I person-
ally find deeply un-American, while de-
fense is increasingly challenged by 
China and Iran. 
When you pass something like that, 
Mr. Speaker, you are saying that the 
body values waging a war with no clear 
mission and appeasing leftwing diver-
sity political mob rule more than pro-
tecting the American citizens whose 
lives are threatened every single day 
by cartel violence, by people coming 
across the border, and by what is going 
on in Iran and by China. 
The bottom line is the American peo-
ple hire all of us to do a job, and we are 
failing them, which brings me to my 
point, in my view, about 2021. 
The Framers created this branch, 
Congress, to debate and deliberate, to 
represent the people. But we pass pre- 
made bills cooked up behind closed 
doors by committee, in rules commit-
tees, and by a handful of committee 
cardinals, and we never debate them or 
amend them here on the floor of the 
House of Representatives, and we are 
increasingly passing by proxy vote. 
For the American people back home, 
proxy vote means a Member of this 
body whom you hired to do a job under 
the Constitution—you gave them your 
vote under the Constitution—and that 
Member comes to a Member of this 
body and says: ‘‘I want you to vote for 
me.’’ 
So your vote, citizen, that you en-
trusted into your elected Member of 
Congress is being given to another 
Member here in the body. 
We have been in session for fewer 
than 40 days since March, I am told. 
Mr. Speaker, you can fact-check that, 
and you can go double-check it, but I 
can tell you we have been here precious 
few days. 
Think about that: While in the mid-
dle of a pandemic, while running $28 
trillion in debt, while mounting up tril-
lion-dollar deficits, multitrillion-dollar 
deficits, while China is right at our 
heels, while we are dealing with men 
and women in uniform in Afghanistan 
and the Middle East, while we have 
healthcare costs going up and crippling 
people, and while small businesses are 
struggling, the Speaker is playing 
games not bringing small businesses 
relief to the floor. 
b 1915 
Mr. Speaker, we have been here for 
fewer than 40 days. The Speaker broke 
with over 230 years of precedent to au-
thorize the unconstitutional proxy vot-
ing scheme. 
Last week, ladies and gentlemen, for 
the first time in the history of the 
United States, the House of Represent-
atives used proxy votes—those are 
votes for Representatives who are not 
present in the Chamber to achieve a 
quorum, as the Constitution requires. 
Because the Constitution contemplates 
our being here, doing our job, I say 
ironically, with my voice echoing in 
the Chamber. 
Mr. Speaker, not a single floor 
amendment, not a single open rule— 
the most closed rules since 1993. Now, 
that is boring for the people back 
home. 
What does a closed rule mean? It is 
what I am saying. It means that Con-
gressman ROY cannot offer an amend-
ment on the floor of the House of Rep-
resentatives. That is what a closed rule 
is, and that is what we operate under. 
We never have debate and deliberation. 
We are ruled by a handful. 
As I said before, I am under the un-
derstanding that we have not had a sin-
gle debate of an amendment open on 
the floor of the House of Representa-
tives since May of 2016 where a Member 
could just come down, a bill is put on 
the floor, a Member says, ‘‘I would like 
to amend it.’’ No body functions that 
way—not the people’s House. 
Do we think things would be better 
or worse if we were actually down here 
offering amendments, offering debate, 
debating and discussing? 
When the NDAA was on the floor yes-
terday—and there was a provision in 
the NDAA to place massive burdens on 
small businesses, but it was jammed in 
there to get it across the line—if we 
could have had an amendment on the 
floor, I could offer an amendment to 
strike it, and we would know where ev-
erybody in this body stands on adding 
those regulations to small businesses. 
But I was denied the ability to do that 
because we operate under a closed rule. 
Mr. Speaker, what kind of a people’s 
House is that? 
You want to know why we are push-
ing $28 trillion in debt, and we are 
about to blow past $30 trillion? You 
want to know why we never get really 
good legislation? 
Because I am never able to work with 
the Speaker or with any of my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
because we can’t come down here and 
offer amendments and have rigorous 
debate to force the conversations. 
We are ruled by a handful on both 
sides of the aisle who tell us what we 
are voting on. They come in and they 
say, Here is your 2,000-page bill. Figure 
out how you are going to vote on it. 
Figure out how you are going to mes-
sage it back home. 
Mr. Speaker, for the first time in his-
tory, we opened an impeachment in-
quiry without a vote in the House. 
Now, I am not trying to open up im-
peachment. That has long since kind of 
come and gone from the minds of 
Americans, it seems like, but that is a 
big deal. 
In 2021, for the House to work, the 
following, in my opinion, should be 
nonnegotiable: 
Members should have 72 hours to re-
view the legislation in the form to be 
voted on before they are required to 
vote. That is not a very big ask, ladies 
and gentlemen. We should have time to 
look at 2,000-page bills in the form that 
we are voting on it to see what is in it. 
We should have an open amendment 
process, giving all Members an oppor-
tunity to amend bills on the floor. Bills 
should cover single subjects and not be 
subject to division of the test under 
rule XVI we are applying. We should 
have single-subject bills, like the bill— 
by the way—that DEAN PHILLIPS, my 
Democrat colleague from Minnesota, 
and I offered on the floor. 
There was a PPP Flexibility Act, and 
it was 7 pages long. We should have 
that bill, put it on the floor, debate it, 
amend it, vote. 
And proxy voting should be prohib-
ited on the floor of the House of Rep-
resentatives. It is unconstitutional. I 
look forward to the U.S. Supreme 
Court taking that up, and I believe and

hope that they will find it to be uncon-
stitutional as it is. 
Mr. Speaker, finally, a note about 
the coronavirus. Many Americans have 
been impacted by the virus. I have 
friends and family that have been im-
pacted by it. I have had staff who have 
been impacted by it. I missed Thanks-
giving with my 78-year-old father and 
72-year-old mother because I had been 
around someone who had been positive. 
I wanted to protect them. We are all 
doing these things. We are all making 
sacrifices, figuring out how to adjust to 
make sure we protect the vulnerable. 
Mr. Speaker, our Nation should be 
open. Our businesses should be open. 
Our schools should be open. Our res-
taurants should be open. Our baseball 
and football and basketball stadiums 
should be open. Our churches should 
never, ever close again. And we should 
use our own judgment to celebrate 
Thanksgiving and Christmas without 
local, petty tyrants attempting to tell 
us what to do. But here we are, as I 
hear Joe Biden and others talk about 
national mask mandates in 2021, and I 
continue to hear about restrictions and 
social distancing, even if we get a vac-
cine. 
Have any of you been to the res-
taurants that are shutting down? In 
Arlington, Virginia, they run over and 
grab your beer or Diet Coke at 10 p.m. 
right on the dot. They can’t make 
money. They can’t survive. 
Are any of the local, petty tyrants 
shutting them down going to pay their 
bills or are they going to come here to 
this Chamber and expect us to pass an-
other trillion-dollar bill to fund them 
because the local governments are 
shutting them down? 
Because that is what is happening. 
The big businesses are doing fine. But 
the small restaurants, the local dry 
cleaners, the small hotels, the local 
music venues, the artists—the back-
bone of this country is getting deci-
mated because we are shutting down. 
America doesn’t shut down. 
Leftists run around bleeding about 
how we should be locked down, but ex-
pecting workers to bring them their 
lattes or take-home Chinese or tacos, 
expecting workers to clean the streets 
and pick up the garbage and serve 
them while they pat themselves on the 
back for being enlightened. 
Mayors like Mayor Adler in Austin, 
who I already said went to Cabo and re-
corded a video telling us we should 
stay home. 
Mayors like the mayors in L.A. turn-
ing off utilities while policing people’s 
home. 
Oh, my gosh, how many cars do you 
have in front of your house? 
The mayor in Denver saying every-
body has got to stay home, but what 
does he do? 
He flies home. Rules for thee, but not 
for me. 
My fellow Americans, these local ty-
rants, tell them a simple word; tell 
them ‘‘no.’’ You local businessowners 
that are opening up, God be with you. 
I am with you. Open up. We are Ameri-
cans. We don’t close down. 
Mr. Speaker, our Nation is a large 
and vibrant economy and large and vi-
brant country that thrives on free en-
terprise, freedom of religion, freedom 
to interact and engage as a society. It 
is who we are as Americans. We will re-
main the economic engine of the world. 
And I, frankly, don’t really care to 
listen to countries around the world 
lecture us about their alleged lockdown 
successes and results—much of which 
are easily disputable—when the world 
lives off the very sacrifices we make. 
We fund the world’s defense, ladies 
and gentlemen. We fund, through our 
economic engine, a good deal of this 
world. We feed a large chunk of this 
world. We provide energy for an enor-
mous part of this world. So forgive me 
if I don’t want to be lectured to by Aus-
tralia or anybody else about how their 
success in their lockdown worked out 
for them. Because these things are all 
interacting. 
When we make decisions, it impacts 
real lives. You read reports about 140 
million people that may be starving be-
cause we are not distributing the same 
number of products because of the 
virus. And then you come talk to me 
about a few thousand that are im-
pacted by the virus. We have got deci-
sions to make that impact people’s 
lives, and we do it by staying open. 
Our own lockdowns that we have cho-
sen to do, predominantly by local gov-
ernments have been devastating. We 
have seen devastation in our schools, 
devastation in small businesses. We 
have seen people forced to die alone. 
We have seen increased suicides, people 
that have died from diseases, cancer, 
heart disease, and more, all because of 
virus policies. And to all of that, I say, 
simply, ‘‘enough.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, this body, this House of 
Representatives should no longer be 
operating in fear. We are leaders. We 
should be here. We should be debating. 
We should be present. We should be in 
this Chamber, and we should not be 
wearing masks. We should be looking 
each other in the face and in the eye, 
and we should be doing our job. Take 
tests, take our temperature, whatever 
it takes, but lead. 
We are running around in fear, and it 
is embarrassing. We have these fake 
cleaning exercises between votes as a 
threat because of precious time if we 
dare congregate for 5-minutes and de-
bate some issue that is on the floor of 
the House of Representatives. 
This is no way for the House of Rep-
resentatives to function while we are 
leading a Nation. We should reject fear 
and favor of our faith, reject fear and 
favor of our family, our friends, and 
the thriving society Americans de-
serve. 
And simply put, America must never 
again shut down. America must always 
be open for business. And more impor-
tantly, America must always be open 
for life. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 9, 2020 
No. 208 
Senate 
The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal God, we praise You that You 
continue to rescue us from ourselves. 
We will tell about the wonders You 
have worked on our behalf. We are born 
in sin and formed by iniquity, but Your 
power continues to transform. 
Lord, You have kept us from stum-
bling and disgrace. Continue to provide 
our Senators with the blessings of Your 
mercy and peace. Lead them not into 
temptation, but deliver them from evil. 
Use our lawmakers to restore health 
and unity to a nation desperately de-
siring Your purposes to prevail. May 
Your favor keep us all secure. 
We pray in Your loving Name. Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. BAR-
RASSO). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak for 1 
minute in morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered.

RECOGNIZING THE IOWA AIR NA-
TIONAL GUARD’S 185TH AIR RE-
FUELING WING 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on 
November 27, it was announced that 
the Iowa Air National Guard’s 185th 
Air Refueling Wing in Sioux City, IA, 
has been awarded the Air Force Out-
standing Unit Award. 
This award was earned for the wing’s 
exceptional service to the Air Force in 
2019, which included the usual thou-
sands of flying hours and refueling, but 
it also included things like the human-
itarian efforts of this wing’s effort in 
the multiple Puerto Rican natural dis-
asters. 
In addition, the 185th Wing has been 
working tirelessly to support cleanup 
efforts from this great windstorm in 
Iowa called the derecho, which wiped 
out 800,000 acres of crops through the 
middle of Iowa. It also included such 
things that they may not be recognized 
for enough—helping with the COVID–19 
testings in the State of Iowa. 
So I say congratulations to the 185th 
Wing, and, most importantly, thank 
you for your dedication to serving our 
State and country. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, the 
American people are hurting. We are in 
the thick of one of the worst national 
crises in modern memory, and people’s 
eyes are fixed on Congress. They need 
the House and the Senate to stop chas-
ing our tails and make a law. 
There are small business employees 
who have held onto their jobs all this 
time because of the Paycheck Protec-
tion Program but are facing the pros-
pect they might be laid off now, with 
vaccines just around the corner, be-
cause Washington fumbles the ball in 
the red zone. 
There 
are 
medically 
vulnerable 
Americans who have watched Oper-
ation Warp Speed appear to succeed at 
a historic pace, but Congress can’t even 
agree to fully fund the distribution ef-
forts that will get the vaccines to peo-
ple. 
There are Americans who have been 
thrown out of work, through no fault of 
their own, who are watching Federal 
aid programs tick toward expiration in 
a few weeks, even though neither side 
in Congress opposes extending them. 
Senate Republicans have made one 
offer after another after another to try 
and make law on all the significant 
areas where nobody even disagrees. We 
spent July, August, September, Octo-
ber, and November trying different 
ways to create common ground, but 
the Speaker of the House and the Sen-
ate Democratic leader have been just 
as consistent. At every turn, they have 
delayed, deflected, moved the goal-
posts, and made the huge number of 
places where Congress agrees into a 
hostage—into a hostage—of the few 
places where we do not agree. 
Back in the summertime, I pointed 
out the obvious. I said leading Demo-
crats simply just didn’t want any more 
help to reach American families before 
the election occurred. The other side 
claimed great offense; how insulting to 
even suggest that such cynicism might 
be at play. 
And now they are admitting it out 
loud. Yesterday, on CNN, the Demo-
cratic whip was asked point-blank why 
the Speaker and the Democratic leader 
were so unwilling to play ball back in 
the autumn. The No. 2 Democrat re-
sponded: ‘‘[Well], there was some exu-
berance involved because an election 
was coming.’’ Well, he gets points for 
candor: ‘‘because an election was com-
ing.’’ 
A few days ago, Speaker PELOSI told 
reporters why she reversed months of

statements and suddenly began dis-
cussing comparatively more reasonable 
sums of money. Her answer was simple. 
She thinks the Presidential election 
went the way she wanted. The Speaker 
of the House views it as a success that 
she denied struggling people relief they 
badly needed for months because she 
thinks she got the political result she 
was after. 
I count no fewer than 10 separate 
times that top Democrats rejected or 
blocked various Republican efforts to 
jump-start the process, so here is just a 
partial sampling. 
In July, Republicans sketched a com-
prehensive plan for safe schools, jobs, 
and healthcare. We could have made 
law in July, but the Democratic leader 
wouldn’t even engage with it. Just be-
fore August, Republicans tried to at 
least extend unemployment aid before 
it expired. Democrats blocked that as 
well. 
In September, we tried something 
else: a targeted effort to spend hun-
dreds of billions of dollars for PPP, 
vaccine development, and other prior-
ities. 
Every 
Democrat 
who 
voted 
blocked us from even debating it, and 
they did it a second time a month later 
in October. 
Last week, after speaking with the 
administration, I made yet another 
overture. The Democratic leader said: 
No thanks. And just yesterday, the 
Speaker and the Democratic leader 
brushed off two different overtures in 
the space of about 2 hours. 
I suggested that both sides drop what 
seemed to be the most controversial 
demand in the eyes of our counter-
parts. Democrats continued to oppose 
commonsense legal protections that 
university presidents have been beg-
ging for, and Republicans see no need 
to send huge sums of money to State 
and local governments whose tax reve-
nues have actually gone up—gone up. 
Negotiating 101 suggests we set those 
two controversial pieces aside and plow 
ahead with a huge pile of things that 
we agree on, but that would require 
both sides to truly want to get an out-
come. 
Just hours after Democrats poured 
cold water on that, Secretary Mnuchin 
tried another new tack and sent over 
an offer, and in a bizarre and schizo-
phrenic press release, the Speaker and 
the leader said the administration was 
obstructing negotiations by negoti-
ating. Two more brush-offs in about 2 
hours. More deflection, more delay, and 
more suffering for innocent Americans. 
Can anyone point to a single sign—a 
single sign—from April through now, 
that Democratic leaders have seriously 
wanted another bipartisan deal to be-
come law? Can anybody name one 
way—just one—the Democratic leaders 
would have behaved differently if their 
singular goal was to kill any com-
promise? 
That 
hypothetical 
world 
looks suspiciously like the world we 
have been living in. 
Think of it. We have a Speaker of the 
House from San Francisco who has 
spent months ensuring that unem-
ployed Californians can’t have jobless 
aid extended and California restaurants 
can’t get another round of PPP unless 
the Governor of California gets a Fed-
eral slush fund out of proportion to any 
proven need. 
Do 
working 
families 
agree 
they 
should not get any more help them-
selves unless the Governors and State 
legislators get a controversial bailout? 
Are 
struggling 
Americans 
saying: 
Thank goodness the Democrats are 
bravely—bravely—blocking help for me 
and my family unless my State politi-
cians get some more cash? I would say 
not. 
Our people need more help. There is a 
huge list of helpful policies that both 
sides agree on. This need not be rocket 
science. But we can’t do a thing unless 
the Democrats decide they actually 
want to make a law. 
f 
CHINA 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Now, Mr. Presi-
dent, on another matter entirely. Last 
week, the struggle to preserve freedom 
and autonomy in Hong Kong was dealt 
another disturbing blow. 
On Thursday, Jimmy Lai, a promi-
nent media figure and pro-democracy 
activist, was denied bail. The Chinese 
Communist Party continues cracking 
down on dissent and free speech. Not 
long ago, the international community 
hoped China’s modernization would 
create more respect for basic freedoms. 
Unfortunately, the CCP has just mar-
shaled new tools for making its oppres-
sion even more stifling. 
Internationally, we have seen the 
Chinese Communist Party find more 
success exporting its warped vision 
into the global public square than the 
free world has had getting Beijing to 
respect the rules of the road. 
For the last 4 years, thanks to this 
administration’s leadership and this 
Senate, we have begun exchanging the 
old naivete about China for a smarter 
and tougher approach. Through new 
national security and national defense 
strategies, the United States has com-
mitted to deterring a new wave of 
threats from near-peer competitors 
like China and Russia. 
Reforms to our budgets and policies 
are underway. We have used NDAAs 
and appropriations to invest in a mili-
tary that is prepared to meet and de-
feat these threats. Maintaining our 
edge will mean sustaining these re-
forms, along with strong diplomacy, to 
counter China’s influence. 
In coordination with the executive 
branch, our Intelligence Committee 
has highlighted the need for everyone 
to strengthen their defenses against 
the CCP’s espionage, intellectual prop-
erty theft, and political influence cam-
paigns. 
Senators CORNYN and FEINSTEIN, in 
particular, have led bipartisan efforts 
to reform CFIUS and protect against 
predatory foreign investments aimed 
at threatening or stealing high-tech 
and 
critical 
infrastructure. 
Allied 
countries are following our lead, and 
public and private sector cooperation 
has improved to defend the institu-
tions, 
alliances, 
and 
international 
order the CCP wants to disrupt. 
The administration has worked with 
international partners to ensure the se-
curity of 5G, reassert freedom of navi-
gation in the South China Sea, and 
blunt harmful elements of China’s 
exploitive Belt and Road Initiative. 
Of course, more needs to be done, 
particularly on human rights. The 
treatment of Hongkongers in the spot-
light reminds the world of the ways we 
know Beijing is treating Uighurs and 
Tibetans in the shadows. 
And if China treats its own citizens 
with brutal violence, just think how it 
plans to treat its neighbors. So I wel-
come the latest sanctions imposed by 
the administration and the latest au-
thorities granted by Congress. We are 
raising the stakes for China’s repres-
sion, but our work isn’t over. Our part-
ners will continue to look to us to lead 
with a tone of zero tolerance for this 
behavior. The United States must con-
tinue to work alongside China’s peace-
ful neighbors and our democratic al-
lies, like Japan and Australia. We must 
give voice to those in Hong Kong, 
Xinjiang, and Tibet who have been re-
pressed and jailed. We must stand 
against the worst instincts and actions 
of the Communist Party. 
f 
REMEMBERING EMMANUEL 
‘‘MANNY’’ CAULK 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, now 
on one final matter, last week, stu-
dents and families in Kentucky were 
met with tragic news. On Friday, 
Manny Caulk, the superintendent of 
Fayette County Schools, passed away 
unexpectedly. 
Manny was the first member of his 
family to graduate from college. In 
2015, he assumed responsibility for the 
second largest school district in Ken-
tucky. An education had changed his 
life, literally, and he wanted to share 
that gift with others. And by all ac-
counts, he did just that. 
Manny encouraged his students to 
aim high and helped them exceed ex-
pectations, starting with his first stu-
dents in a county detention center, 
and, in 2018, his colleagues chose him 
as Kentucky’s ‘‘Superintendent of the 
Year.’’ 
I was glad to have Manny’s partner-
ship as we worked to protect Kentucky 
families from COVID–19. At every step, 
he kept focused on the well-being of 
Lexington students. 
Over 
the 
weekend, 
condolences 
poured in as we reflected on Manny’s 
lasting contributions. I would like to 
add the Senate’s gratitude for this top- 
tier educator. Our prayers are with 
Manny’s wife Christol and their chil-
dren at this very difficult time. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I am hop-
ing that we will be able to pass a 
COVID relief bill before Christmas. As 
the leader has said earlier, we don’t 
need to resolve all of our differences to 
pass a bill. We can pass targeted legis-
lation that focuses on the priorities 
that we all agree need to be addressed. 
As the leader pointed out earlier this 
morning on the floor, Republicans here 
in the Senate have tried repeatedly, 
going back to last summer, to move 
legislation that is targeted, that is fis-
cally responsible, and that addresses 
the key needs that are being experi-
enced and the challenges that are being 
felt by the American people during the 
pandemic. 
In fact, as recently as October, we 
had a majority of U.S. Senators here 
on the floor that attempted to get on a 
bill—a targeted, fiscally responsible 
bill—that addressed the needs that our 
small businesses have, with additional 
funding for the PPP program; that pro-
vided an extension for unemployment 
insurance for people who were unem-
ployed; that provided funding for vac-
cine distribution; that also provided 
funding for frontline workers and, I 
should add, funding for schools and 
universities. It was a very targeted, fis-
cally responsible bill. It was voted on 
here in the Senate not only once but 
twice. 
Both in September and October, we 
brought a bill to the floor and couldn’t 
even get on it because the Democratic 
leadership decided to block that bill. 
So we didn’t even have a debate. Not 
only could we not get a vote on some-
thing that represented a good-faith ef-
fort at addressing the key needs that 
are being felt by the American people 
as a result of the pandemic, but we 
couldn’t even get on the bill to debate 
it. 
So we are trying yet one more time, 
and I hope this time we will meet with 
success because I do believe that we 
need to pass COVID relief before the 
end of the year, and I hope Members of 
the Democratic leadership will decide 
that they are willing to move forward 
to meet our country’s most critical 
COVID priorities. 
REMOTE AND MOBILE WORKER RELIEF ACT OF 
2020 
Mr. President, on the subject of 
COVID relief, there is another issue 
that we should address before the end 
of the year, and that is tax relief for re-
mote and mobile workers. The com-
plicated tax situation facing mobile 
workers has been an issue for a while 
now, but it has been thrown into espe-
cially sharp relief by the pandemic. 
As everyone knows, medical profes-
sionals around the country have trav-
eled to hard-hit areas this year to help 
hospitals deal with the influx of COVID 
cases. But what many people don’t re-
alize is that these medical profes-
sionals, like other mobile workers, are 
likely to face a complicated tax situa-
tion this year as a result. For the ma-
jority of Americans, State income tax 
is fairly uncomplicated. Most Ameri-
cans work in the same State in which 
they reside. So there is no question as 
to which State will be taxing their in-
come. 
For mobile workers, however—like 
traveling nurses or technicians or the 
medical professionals who responded to 
COVID in hard-hit areas—the situation 
is a lot more complicated. Like most 
Americans, their income is subject to 
taxation in the State in which their 
permanent home is located, but any in-
come that they earned in a State other 
than their State of residence is also 
subject to taxation in the State in 
which they earned it. 
Now, individuals can generally re-
ceive a tax credit in their home State 
for income tax paid to another State, 
thus avoiding double taxation of their 
income. I would add, however, that for 
States that don’t have an income tax— 
and there are many of those across the 
country, including my home State of 
South Dakota—there is no tax credit 
against income tax paid because there 
is no income tax paid in the home 
State. 
But mobile workers’ income tax situ-
ation is extremely complicated, as 
they generally have to file tax returns 
in multiple States, and it is made even 
more complicated by the fact that 
States have a multitude of different 
rules governing just when income 
earned in their State starts to be 
taxed. Some States give up to a 60-day 
window before income earned by mo-
bile workers in their State is subject to 
taxation. Other States start taxing mo-
bile workers immediately. 
Navigating different States’ require-
ments can make for a miserable tax 
season for mobile workers, and it can 
also be a real burden for their employ-
ers. It is particularly challenging for 
smaller businesses, which frequently 
lack the in-house tax staff and track-
ing capabilities of larger organizations. 
The situation has long cried out for a 
solution. For the past four Congresses, 
I have introduced legislation, the Mo-
bile Workforce State Income Tax Sim-
plification Act, to create a uniform 
standard for mobile workers. It is a bi-
partisan bill, and under that bill if you 
spend 30 days or fewer working in a dif-
ferent State, you would be taxed as 
normal by your home State. If you 
spend more than 30 days working in a 
different State, you would be subject to 
that other State’s income tax in addi-
tion to income tax from your home 
State. 
In June of this year, I introduced an 
updated version of my mobile work-
force bill: the Remote and Mobile 
Worker Relief Act. Like my original 
mobile workforce bill, the Remote and 
Mobile Worker Relief Act would create 
a uniform 30-day standard governing 
State income tax liability for mobile 
workers. But my new bill goes further 
and addresses some of the particular 
challenges faced by mobile and remote 
workers as a result of the coronavirus. 
The Remote and Mobile Worker Re-
lief Act would establish a special 90- 
day standard for healthcare workers 
who travel to another State to help 
during the pandemic. This should en-
sure that these workers don’t face an 
expected tax bill for the contributions 
that 
they 
make 
to 
fighting 
the 
coronavirus. 
My new bill also addresses the pos-
sible tax complications that could face 
remote workers as a result of the pan-
demic. During the coronavirus crisis, 
many workers who usually travel to 
their offices every day have ended up 
working 
from 
home. 
This 
doesn’t 
present a tax problem for most employ-
ees, but it does present a possible prob-
lem for workers who live in a different 
State than the one in which they work. 
Under current State law, these work-
ers usually pay most or all of their 
State income taxes to the State in 
which they earn this income rather 
than their State of residence. However, 
now that some workers who usually 
work in a different State have been 
working from home, there is a risk 
that their State of residence could con-
sider the resulting income as allocated 
to and taxable by it as well. That could 
mean a higher tax bill for a lot of 
workers. 
My bill would preempt this problem 
by codifying the prepandemic status 
quo. Under my bill, if you planned to 
work in North Carolina but had to 
work from home in South Carolina dur-
ing the pandemic, your income would 
still be taxed as if you were going in to 
the office in North Carolina every day, 
just as it would have been if the pan-
demic had never happened.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7292 
December 9, 2020 
Relief for mobile workers is a bipar-
tisan idea. A version of my original 
mobile workforce bill has passed the 
House 
of 
Representatives 
multiple 
times, and the only reason it hasn’t ad-
vanced so far in the U.S. Senate is be-
cause of the opposition of a handful of 
States, like New York, that aggres-
sively tax temporary workers. 
New York, of course, was the epi-
center of the pandemic in the United 
States early on, and medical profes-
sionals from across the country came 
to New York to work and to help out. 
Now, one would think that their pres-
ence would be an occasion for profound 
gratitude, but New York Governor An-
drew Cuomo apparently also regards 
them as an opportunity for a tax wind-
fall. That is right. Despite the fact that 
these workers provided indispensable 
help to New York in the worst period 
during the pandemic, in May Governor 
Cuomo announced that these workers 
would nevertheless be subject to New 
York’s substantial income tax for the 
time that they spent working in the 
State. 
It is unconscionable that we would 
allow 
healthcare 
professionals 
who 
risked their lives—risked their own 
lives—to 
care 
for 
individuals 
in 
coronavirus-stricken States to be pun-
ished with unexpected tax bills. And we 
need to make sure that Americans who 
work from home to help slow the 
spread of the virus don’t face a com-
plicated tax situation or an unexpect-
edly high tax bill as a result. 
It would be wonderful to see the 
Democratic leader who, of course, hails 
from New York, speak up to endorse re-
mote and mobile worker relief. He 
should make it clear whether he agrees 
with Governor Cuomo’s decision to 
cash in on COVID relief workers’ as-
sistance or whether he thinks these 
vital medical professionals should be 
spared unexpected tax bills. 
I really hope that he is not actively 
standing in the way of my bill in order 
to protect Governor Cuomo’s efforts to 
boost New York’s coffers at healthcare 
workers’ expense. I encourage him to 
make it clear where he stands on this 
issue. 
I intend to do everything I can to en-
sure that my bill receives a vote in the 
Senate before Christmas. Passing this 
legislation would spare a lot of workers 
a lot of misery when April comes 
around. 
Americans have been through enough 
this year. Let’s not add unexpected tax 
bills to the equation.

EXECUTIVE CALENDAR—Continued 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, March 
23—March 23 has been a long time from 
this date, and a lot of things have hap-
pened in America since March 23. Over 
200,000 American lives have been lost. 
Millions of Americans have been in-
fected with the COVID virus. Our fami-
lies have changed. Our lives have 
changed. We have tried to adjust to the 
worst pandemic America has seen. 
We know that we have fallen short 
many times in providing the resources 
that were needed in a timely way. I can 
remember in the early stages of this 
pandemic when in my State of Illinois 
there were desperate phone calls from 
the Governor asking if I could find 
some way to help, in Washington or 
any other place, to provide protective 
equipment 
for 
the 
people 
in 
the 
healthcare field. 
We know as well that many people 
have seen businesses close in their 
communities. In my hometown of 
Springfield, IL, our favorite restaurant 
is clinging to its business life, and we 
are finding excuses to order food out as 
often as possible to keep them open. 
Others haven’t been so lucky. Their 
businesses are closed, and their jobs 
have disappeared. 
Millions of Americans are drawing 
unemployment. Many are waiting in 
long lines for food. Desperate decisions 
are being made because people are in 
desperate circumstances. 
A lot has happened since March 23. 
The reason I mention that date is that 
was the day we passed the CARES Act. 
It was a momentous, historic effort—$3 
trillion to try to rescue this economy, 
to help the American people through 
this crisis, to provide resources that 
were needed—and it was overwhelm-
ingly bipartisan. It passed the Senate 
by 96 to 0. 
Since then, many things have hap-
pened. We have also learned that the 
CARES 
Act 
was 
not 
enough. 
We 
thought this crisis would end long ago, 
and it didn’t. Perhaps now with vac-
cines coming online, we will see some 
dramatic changes in the few months 
ahead, but what are we going to do in 
the meantime? Are we going to con-
tinue to help those drawing unemploy-
ment? Are we going to continue to help 
the businesses that are struggling to 
survive and to help their employees 
make it through another week or an-
other month? Are we going to do what 
is necessary to help State and local 
governments that have seen losses in 
their revenues in historic terms? Are 
we going to take care to provide the 
logistical support for the actual vac-
cinations that are necessary across 
America? That question is unanswered 
because we have done nothing—vir-
tually nothing—since March 23. 
A group of Senators several weeks 
ago met for a socially distanced, safe 
dinner at one of the homes of my col-
leagues and talked about another ap-
proach—a new approach, a bipartisan 
approach—to try to deal with COVID 
relief. If the leaders were unable to act, 
perhaps we could start the conversa-
tion. 
I signed up for that effort with a 
number of Republican Senators and 
Democratic Senators, and we set out to 
write a COVID relief bill—with our 
staff’s help, of course. I didn’t realize 
what I was getting into in terms of 
time commitment. We have spent lit-
erally hour after hour after hour, day 
after day after day—multiple times in 
a day sometimes—dealing with the dif-
ficult issues of what America needs 
now in emergency relief because of this 
COVID–19 crisis. 
We have come to a general conclu-
sion on all but one issue as to what we 
would propose, and we believe it should 
be done quickly. You see, on December 
26, 12 million Americans will lose their 
unemployment insurance. Businesses 
struggling now will close between now 
and then if we don’t do something. 
Unfortunately, the speech given by 
the Republican leader on the floor this 
morning suggests that whatever we 
came up with and proposed is not going 
to be taken seriously. That is unfortu-
nate. I think there is real wisdom, bi-
partisan compromise in our proposal. 
It is within the power of the Repub-
lican leader to call this matter to the 
floor, and that is all we ask. Make it 
subject to amendments, if you wish, 
but let’s get this debate underway. 
This silent, empty Chamber is no an-
swer to the cries of American people 
who are desperate for help in the midst 
of this pandemic. Political posturing 
and press releases from one side or the 
other won’t put food on the table, 
won’t give a father peace of mind, 
won’t give a mother the help she needs 
with childcare, won’t give a student 
the broadband service they need to 
continue their education. 
There is an issue that still is unre-
solved, and it is the issue of liability. 
We don’t know what to do with that, 
but we ought to look at the evidence. 
So far in this calendar year, with 15 
million people infected with COVID–19, 
fewer than 3 lawsuits per State—3 per 
State—have been filed in medical mal-
practice or consumer personal injury 
claims. There are a lot of other law-
suits between businesses and with in-
surance companies—by prisoners in jail 
saying that their confinement is dan-
gerous to their health, people filing 
lawsuits against Governors for issuing 
orders to stay at home and close down 
businesses—but when it comes to the 
personal injury claims, there are very 
few. Very few. 
We know why—those of us who have 
been involved in the practice of law. 
One of the things that you have to 
prove to recover in a case is causation. 
That is rare in a case dealing with 
coronavirus, to be able to pinpoint ex-
actly when you became infected and 
what the circumstances are. That is 
why so few lawsuits have been filed. 
The Senator from Kentucky is insist-
ing that there be immunity to liability 
as part of any agreement. It is a thorny 
topic, a difficult topic, a controversial 
topic, but I plead with him to hold to 
another day the overall issue of liabil-
ity. Accept this emergency bill that we 
have put together as a bipartisan group 
of Senators to address this issue in the 
reality of the world we live in. To hold 
it back because of some other major 
issue that has not been resolved is un-
fair to American families and workers 
and students and health workers. We 
owe it to them to do everything in our 
power to help them now. 
How can we in good conscience go 
home for Christmas knowing that the 
day after Christmas, 12 million Ameri-
cans will see their unemployment in-
surance disappear because of our in-
ability to act? What kind of spirit is 
that of any holiday season? I think we 
need to be mindful of the fact that 
there are a lot of helpless people count-
ing on us to do something. 
I hope we realize that this bipartisan 
effort put together by a group of Sen-
ators, which I have been honored to be 
part of, is a good-faith effort to answer 
the basic questions of what is needed 
now in America and what is needed on 
an emergency basis. It is a good bill— 
far from perfect. It deserves a vote on 
the floor of the U.S. Senate. 
If Senator MCCONNELL has another 
proposal that he wants to put on the 
floor as well, he certainly has that 
right as the majority leader, but to 
close the door on this bipartisan effort 
is to reject a good-faith undertaking by 
Senators from both sides of the aisle, 
Democrats and Republicans. 
I plead with the majority leader, let’s 
not claim some political victory when 
this is all over at the expense of a lot 
of helpless people across America who 
are battling this pandemic. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7294 
December 9, 2020 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF SEAN J. COOKSEY 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, in a few 
moments, we are going to be voting on 
a series of nominations to the Federal 
Election Commission, one of which is 
of personal interest to me. It is the 
nomination of Sean Cooksey to be a 
Commissioner of that body. 
I know Sean personally because I 
have had the great privilege of working 
with Sean for the last 2 years while he 
has served as the general counsel in my 
office. Sean is a native Missourian. He 
comes from the eastern part of the 
State, just north of St. Louis. He is a 
proud graduate of Truman State Uni-
versity in the State of Missouri. He 
comes from a working family there in 
the State, and his family still lives 
there. 
Sean has rendered exceptional serv-
ice to me this last year and a half. In 
fact, when I came to the Senate not 
even 2 years ago, I have to say Sean 
had more experience than I did, having 
served in this body for several years be-
fore in the office—on the staff of Sen-
ator TED CRUZ of Texas. 
Sean 
has 
done 
absolutely 
out-
standing work in the last year and a 
half in my office helping us pass impor-
tant legislation, including my first bill 
signed into law in the Senate, the Sup-
porting and Treating Officers in Crisis 
Act. This is a law that will direct new 
funding to police officers and other law 
enforcement all across the State of 
Missouri and across the Nation to get 
the help and support they need when 
they are exposed to violence, when 
they are exposed to situations that re-
quire followup help, counseling. It gets 
them the resources especially in small 
and local police departments in rural 
areas, like those across my State. Sean 
was instrumental in drafting this legis-
lation and in getting it passed. It was a 
proud day almost a year and a half ago 
when President Trump signed that bill 
into law. 
This is just one example of the out-
standing service Sean has rendered not 
just to my office but to the people of 
Missouri and not just to the people of 
Missouri but to the people of the 
United States. That is why, while I am 
sorry to see Sean go on a personal 
level, I am absolutely delighted for the 
country because my loss is going to be 
the gain of the United States of Amer-
ica. 
I want to congratulate Sean on this 
nomination and what I think will soon 
be his confirmation in just a few mo-
ment’s time. 
I want to congratulate his family. I 
know this is a very proud day for them. 
I believe Sean will be the youngest 
member of the Federal Election Com-
mission, maybe in the history of this 
body. I can’t think of anyone more de-
serving. I know that he will render dis-
tinguished service to the country in 
this capacity. 
I yield the floor.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader is recognized. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, the 
most important item on the Senate’s 
to-do list before the end of the year is 
a bipartisan emergency relief package 
for a nation suffering the worst month 
of the COVID–19 pandemic. 
Negotiations continue between a bi-
partisan group of Senate and House 
Members who, last week, agreed in 
principle on a $900-plus billion emer-
gency relief proposal. As the details 
continue to get sorted, Speaker PELOSI 
and I have encouraged everyone to use 
this bipartisan proposal as a frame-
work for negotiations. 
Yesterday, the White House pre-
sented us an offer of similar size, 
around $900 billion—an encouraging 
sign that Republican leadership is mov-
ing in the right direction by endorsing 
the size of the Gang of 8’s bill. But the 
President’s proposal must not be al-
lowed to supersede or obstruct the bi-
partisan congressional talks that are 
underway. That is where the real ac-
tion is and where bipartisan agreement 
on the basic concepts will ultimately 
be forged. 
The President’s proposal, for in-
stance, completely misses the mark on 
unemployment benefits and aid to 
American families. In order to include 
$600 stimulus checks, it actually cuts 
proposed unemployment benefits by 
greater than a factor of 4, from $180 bil-
lion to just $40 billion—an unaccept-
ably low amount—while tens of mil-
lions of Americans remain out of work, 
almost all of whom have lost their jobs 
because of COVID. 
Economists from every end of the 
spectrum, including the conservative 
U.S. Chamber of Commerce, are warn-
ing us that the United States faces the 
prospect of a double-dip recession with-
out another round of emergency fiscal 
stimulus. A robust unemployment ben-
efit is crucial—crucial—to that pro-
gram. Earlier in the pandemic, it 
helped keep 12 million Americans out 
of poverty and propped up consumer 
spending. We shouldn’t be cutting un-
employment benefits now, as the Presi-
dent’s team proposes; we should be ex-
tending them. 
Now, the Republican leader, as usual, 
gave a very angry speech this morning 
accusing Democrats of all manner of 
things, including intentionally block-
ing aid to thwart President Trump. I 
don’t know what evidence he has of 
that, but there are actual reports— 
honest-to-God 
reports—in 
the 
New 
York Times and the Washington Post 
that Leader MCCONNELL was warning 
the White House not to cut a deal on 
COVID relief before the election. 
Here 
is 
the 
Washington 
Post: 
‘‘McConnell warns White House against 
making stimulus deal as Pelosi and 
Mnuchin inch closer.’’ That is from Oc-
tober 20—2 weeks before the election. 
Meanwhile, Democrats have contin-
ually lowered our proposals, now by 
over $2 trillion, to move closer to our 
Republican colleagues in the spirit of 
compromise and for the sake of getting 
something done for the American peo-
ple. It would do a whole lot of good if 
the Republican leader would drop the 
daily tirades and diatribes, which seem 
to be based in some alternative reality, 
and join the rest of the Senate in urg-
ing the bipartisan negotiations now un-
derway to continue. 
Families all over the country are 
nearing a point of desperation, unable 
to put food on the table, a roof over 
their children’s heads. By January, 
nearly 12 million renters will owe an 
average of nearly $6,000 in back rent 
and utilities—a shocking figure. 
We need to deliver an emergency re-
lief package to keep American fami-
lies, workers, and businesses afloat 
until the crisis finally begins to sub-
side. The only way to get that done is 
in a bipartisan fashion. The sooner the 
Republican leader realizes it, the bet-
ter. 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION NOMINATIONS 
Mr. President, on Biden nomina-
tions—President-Elect Biden continues 
to roll out an impressive slate of Secre-
taries-designate to lead Cabinet agen-
cies in his administration. 
Yesterday, he selected Lloyd Austin 
to be the next Secretary of Defense, an-
other groundbreaking selection. Mr. 
Austin would be the first African- 
American to lead the largest Cabinet 
agency in our government. Secretary- 
designate Austin is a familiar face to 
many of us on Capitol Hill, and I am 
also pleased to say he is a familiar face 
to many in the North Country in New 
York. He is the former commander of 
the 10th Mountain Division at Fort 
Drum—the pride of Jefferson County. 
Like all of President-Elect Biden’s 
national security nominees, Senate- 
designate Austin is deeply experienced 
and familiar with our Nation’s national 
security, as well as the many issues 
that face our servicemembers and their 
families each and every day. Lloyd 
Austin served our Nation for more than 
four decades, and his willingness to 
serve his country again is admirable. 
He will make an excellent Secretary of 
Defense. 
Now, an hour ago, I met with Presi-
dent-Elect Biden’s economic team by 
teleconference, 
including 
Secretary- 
designate of Treasury, Janet Yellen, to 
discuss priorities with the incoming 
administration on how to get our econ-
omy back on track. I urged them, once 
President-Elect Biden becomes Presi-
dent, to go bold. Austerity right now is 
not what America needs but a bold pro-
gram to stimulate our economy and 
get things moving, to help get people 
jobs—good-paying 
jobs—because 
our 
economy is suffering. I look forward to 
our continued conversations. 
A few weeks ago, I predicted that we 
would see some crocodile tears from 
the Republican majority about Biden’s 
Cabinet nominees, but I didn’t think it 
would occur this fast. It began when 
several 
Republican 
Senators 
raised 
some objections over Neera Tanden’s 
Twitter feed. After 4 years of pre-
tending that they ‘‘didn’t see’’ Presi-
dent Trump’s latest online outburst, it 
seems that Senate Republicans have 
rediscovered their Twitter passwords 
now that Joe Biden is the President- 
elect. 
This 
week, 
after 
President-Elect 
Biden announced that Xavier Becerra 
is his pick to be the next Secretary of 
Health and Human Services, Repub-
lican Senators raised concerns, in their 
minds, about Mr. Becerra’s qualifica-
tions. The senior Senator from Texas 
said:

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7296 
December 9, 2020 
I’m not sure what his Health and Human 
Services credentials are. It’s not like Alex 
Azar who used to work for pharma. 
With all due respect to the senior 
Senator from Texas, working for the 
pharmaceutical industry is not the 
only 
way 
to 
get 
experience 
in 
healthcare. Some might argue it is the 
wrong kind of experience for an HHS 
Secretary. 
The truth is, Xavier Becerra is emi-
nently qualified. He worked in the 
House of Representatives for two dec-
ades, always very involved in advanc-
ing the healthcare of his constituents, 
and he has a particularly long track 
record as an advocate of women’s 
health. As the attorney general of Cali-
fornia, he became one of the foremost 
legal 
experts 
on 
our 
Nation’s 
healthcare laws. 
I must say, it is particularly rich for 
this Republican majority to raise ‘‘con-
cerns’’ about whether Biden Cabinet 
nominees have every last pristine qual-
ification for their posts. Not so long 
ago, nearly every Republican in this 
Chamber lined up to make an oil exec-
utive the Secretary of State. I don’t re-
member too many Republican ‘‘con-
cerns’’ when President Trump nomi-
nated a retired neurosurgeon to be the 
Secretary of HUD or when he put Rick 
Perry in charge of the Department of 
Energy—an agency he wanted to abol-
ish before learning it maintained the 
Nation’s nuclear stockpile and that he 
would be in charge of it. If memory 
serves, this Senate Republican major-
ity confirmed a Secretary of Education 
whose only qualification for the job 
was she used her inherited fortune to 
try to privatize American schooling. 
Look, the country needs to move on 
from the past 4 years, but Senate Re-
publicans can’t pretend like it never 
happened. After the sordid caliber of 
nominees that this Republican major-
ity confirmed over the past 4 years, it 
will be impossible to take these com-
plaints about Biden’s nominees very se-
riously. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. ROM-
NEY). The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
MOTION TO DISCHARGE—S.J. RES. 
77 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, pur-
suant to the Arms Export Control Act 
of 1976, I move to discharge the Foreign 
Relations Committee from further con-
sideration of S.J. Res. 77, a joint reso-
lution providing for congressional dis-
approval of the proposed foreign mili-
tary sale to the United Arab Emirates 
of certain defense articles and services. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The mo-
tion is pending. 
Mr. 
MENENDEZ. 
Mr. 
President, 
today I am asking our colleagues to 
stand up for two very important prin-
ciples. One is the congressional over-
sight over arms sales abroad and, sec-
ondly, to ensure that these sales, in 
fact, promote and protect the long- 
term national security of the United 
States. 
Colleagues, I wish we didn’t find our-
selves in the position of having to dis-
cuss our concerns with this sale in this 
kind of forum. The United Arab Emir-
ates has, indeed, been an important 
partner in the fight against terrorism 
and across the region and, I believe, 
will continue to do so. However, a sale 
of this magnitude requires the appro-
priate due diligence. 
For the past few decades, the execu-
tive branch has respected the congres-
sional oversight of the arms sales proc-
ess, a critical piece of which is an in-
formal review period during which we 
get answers to pressing questions. We 
have an opportunity to review sen-
sitive information so that, when sales 
come up for the formal notification, 
which is what we have before us now, 
we have a clearer path forward. Unfor-
tunately, in this case, the Trump ad-
ministration decided to simply ignore 
congressional rights here and the re-
view process, formally notifying the 
sales of these complex weapons sys-
tems, along with other weaponry, to-
taling $23 billion. 
Beyond 
obliterating 
the 
congres-
sional review process, the administra-
tion also seems to have rushed through 
the interagency review of a sale of this 
magnitude. Whereas, a sale of this 
scope would normally merit months 
and months of detailed deliberations 
between the Departments of Defense 
and State, this sale was announced 
with more missing than a few dotted i’s 
and crossed t’s. 
I will go into more detail later before 
we vote, but the bottom line is that 
there are many outstanding issues that 
are critical to U.S. national security 
that have not been addressed, includ-
ing, by way of example, the United 
Arab Emirates’ present and future 
military relationships with Russia and 
China. My understanding is that there 
are negotiations to have with China re-
garding an airstrip for the Chinese 
military off of the UAE. Is that in the 
national interest and security of the 
United States? 
Should we not have a definitive com-
mitment from the UAE that it will not 
move forward if these arms sales move 
forward, including with the most so-
phisticated stealth jet fighter that we 
have? How do we work to safeguard 
U.S. technology? the guarantees we 
will have in place about how U.S.-ori-
gin weapons will be used given the 
Emirates’ history of transferring weap-
ons to a terrorist organization and vio-
lating the U.N. arms embargo in 
Libya? the longer term implications of 
an arms race in the region? and then, 
yes, the impact that it could have on 
both our and Israel’s qualitative mili-
tary edge? 
If we aren’t going to be willing to ask 
these questions, then we have to think 
about the magnitude of the sale with-
out caring about the consequences. 
I have heard a number of my col-
leagues advocate in support of these 
sales because they believe it will help 
our like-minded partners better pos-
ture against Iran. Now, no one is more 
clear-eyed in this Chamber or has pur-
sued Iran and its threat of nuclear 
weapons more than I, and we are clear- 
eyed about the threat Iran continues to 
pose to national security interests, but 
we have yet to understand exactly 
what military threat the F–35s or 
armed drones will be addressing vis-a`- 
vis Iran. Furthermore, according to the 
Trump administration, as recently as 
last year, the UAE continued to host a 
number of companies that facilitated 
Iranian financial transactions in viola-
tion of various U.S. sanctions. 
So Iran is a threat, but you are help-
ing it facilitate U.S. financial trans-
actions. It is not that I have said so but 
that the Trump administration has 
said so. Meanwhile, over the past year, 
Iran has ramped up its nuclear capa-
bilities amidst American diplomatic 
fallout. 
So, if we really want to talk about 
countering Iran, we need a comprehen-
sive, diplomatic strategy. Arming part-
ners with complex weapons systems 
that could take years to come online is 
not a serious strategy with which to 
confront the very real and timely 
threats from Iran. 
I have also heard some of our col-
leagues argue that, if we do not sell 
these weapons, the UAE will turn to 
China and Russia. Well, let’s be clear: 
They already do. They already do. Our 
own Department of Defense’s inspector 
general recently reported that the UAE 
may be funding the Russian mercenary 
Wagner Group in Libya. U.N. reporting 
implicates the UAE’s use of Chinese- 
manufactured drones, in violation of 
the U.N. arms embargo, also in Libya. 
So, while I absolutely agree that we 
have to counter Chinese and Russian 
influence in the region, again, this re-
quires a real strategy, not simply more 
arms. Isn’t this a conversation and a 
commitment that we should get in 
writing from the UAE as part of such 
an arms sale? We don’t have that. Fur-
thermore, if we go forward with these 
sales, yet deny similar requests to 
countries like Qatar or Saudi Arabia, 
where will they go for their advanced 
weaponry to keep pace, and what reac-
tion will Iran have to them? Do we 
really think we can sell this just to the 
UAE and not have those other coun-
tries come knocking on our door, start-
ing a very sophisticated arms race in a 
tinder box of the world? 
Finally, let me be very clear: I ap-
plaud the Abraham accords as a histor-
ical turning point for Israel and the 
Arab world. These new, formal rela-
tionships have the possibility of trans-
forming the region much more broadly 
and bringing peace, stability, and pros-
perity to people who desperately want

December 9, 2020 
and deserve it. Yet, as the administra-
tion and the Emirates have continued 
to stress, these sales are neither a re-
ward nor are they part of these ac-
cords. 
So why can’t we take a little more 
time to really assess the best way for-
ward? We are in the midst of promoting 
a sale—this is the administration—that 
has some of the most significant trans-
fers of advanced U.S. technology with-
out clarity of a number of key details 
regarding the sale or sufficient answers 
to critical national security questions. 
This is far more than about congres-
sional prerogative, although I would 
argue that it is a critical element of 
our policies on arms sales; this is about 
national security concerns to which we 
should have an answer before those 
arms sales move forward. 
Again, colleagues, the bottom line is 
this: There are far too many out-
standing questions and very serious 
questions about long-term U.S. na-
tional 
security 
interests. 
Perhaps, 
after considerable engagement with 
the executive, we would assess that all 
of these sales do, in fact, advance our 
national security. Given the length of 
time it will take for the delivery of 
these systems, it would seem quite rea-
sonable to expect to have 40 days to 
evaluate these questions. 
So I urge my colleagues to stand up 
for Congress’s role in the process of de-
termining arms sales as well as for 
having clear answers to the critical 
questions that are posed to long-term 
U.S. national security interests. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
YOUNT). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I am on 
the floor today to speak to resolutions 
upon which we will begin voting today 
regarding arms sales proposed by the 
administration to the United Arab 
Emirates. 
I am on the floor today to ask my 
colleagues to support these resolutions 
of disapproval upon two grounds: one, 
the protection of congressional prerog-
ative and, two, a question of U.S. na-
tional security. 
First, let me cover the question of 
congressional prerogative. We have 
traditionally debated arms sales here 
on occasion, and the reason why we 
don’t have constant debates in this 
body on arms sales, the reason why we 
don’t have resolutions on every sale 
that is noticed by the administration, 
is because we have built into our prac-
tice an ability for the Senate to con-
sult with the administration before-
hand on a bipartisan basis. 
Over the years, since the passage of 
the law allowing for Congress to have a 
role in the sale of arms to foreign na-
tions, administration after administra-
tion, Republican and Democrat, has ob-
served a period of consultation with 
Congress in which the administration 
comes to the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee, comes to the House For-
eign Relations Committee, presents the 
reasons for the sale, and then addresses 
concerns raised, often in a bipartisan 
manner, by Republicans and Demo-
crats. 
Again, this has happened in both 
Democratic and Republican adminis-
trations, with Democratic and Repub-
lican Congresses, and often that con-
sultative process results in issues that 
Congress has being resolved so that 
you never have to have a vote on the 
Senate floor. 
Something different happened with 
this sale. The administration was so 
desperate to rush through the sale be-
fore the end of their administration 
that they blew through the consulta-
tion process. It just didn’t happen. 
There was no ability for the Senate 
Foreign Relations Committee to weigh 
in on this particular sale. It was rushed 
to notice, and our only option was to 
bring it before the full Senate. 
Now, under any circumstances, I 
would argue that the Senate should 
stand up for our right to have a role. 
The reason that we built in this con-
sultative process was because the Sen-
ate was actually unhappy with the 
amount of input it had decades ago and 
was threatening to dramatically ex-
pand its oversight role on arms sales. 
Instead, a deal was worked out in 
which the administration said they 
would come for this consultation. 
Now it appears that those consulta-
tions are no longer the practice. That 
reduces our role as a foreign-policy- 
making body. And remember, we have 
abdicated all sorts of responsibilities 
over the years when it comes to what 
should be a coequal responsibility to 
set the broad direction of U.S. foreign 
policy with the executive branch. This 
would be yet another chip away at 
Congress’s participation in the setting 
of U.S. national security policy. I am 
not sure we will ever get it back. 
But on this sale, in particular, the 
consultative process was really impor-
tant because this sale is as big and as 
hairy and as complicated as you get. 
We are, for the first time, selling F–35s 
and MQ–9 Reaper drones into the heart 
of the Middle East. We have never done 
it before. There are only 14 countries 
that currently operate the F–35, and al-
most all of them are NATO allies. Tur-
key was on the list for a period of time, 
but because they ended up making a 
choice to go with the Russian missile 
defense system, they were taken out of 
the program. So the partners that re-
main are the ones that you would sus-
pect—Britain, Italy, the Netherlands, 
Australia, Denmark, Canada. 
There are even fewer countries that 
we have sold Reaper drones to—Aus-
tralia, France, Italy, the Netherlands, 
Spain, UK, and India. 
This is the first time that we would 
sell these incredibly lethal, incredibly 
complicated 
technologies 
into 
the 
heart of the Middle East—a region 
that, arguably, is not in need of more 
weapons. 
What we risk doing here is fueling an 
arms race. Today we may be selling the 
F–35s and the MQ–9s to the UAE, but 
the Saudis are going to want it, the 
Qataris have already requested it, and 
it just fuels Iran’s interest in con-
tinuing to build up its own military 
program. 
But, more specifically to this sale, we 
have to ask ourselves whether the UAE 
is ready for this technology or whether 
their behavior over the past several 
years makes them an unworthy part-
ner for this set of highly complicated 
U.S. defense technology. 
I will stipulate, as I think every 
Member of this body will, that the UAE 
is often a very important ally of the 
United States. There is an important 
cooperative relationship that exists be-
tween the United States and the UAE. 
We share counterterrorism information 
together. We were both involved in the 
fight against ISIS. We work together 
to counter Iranian influence in the re-
gion. And, of course, the UAE’s rec-
ognition of Israel is good for the United 
States as well. 
But for as many places as we cooper-
ate with UAE, there are many points of 
division, and those points of division 
often involve the use of U.S. military 
technology against the interests of the 
United States. 
The UAE has been, for years, in-
volved in a civil war in Yemen that is 
terrible for U.S. national security in-
terests. They may not be as involved as 
they were a couple of years ago, but 
they are still a barrier to peace. They 
still refuse to make humanitarian con-
tributions to help the situation on the 
ground. So far in 2020, there are zero 
dollars from the UAE put into the U.N. 
appeal to try to fight off starvation 
and cholera inside Yemen. 
At one point, they took U.S. equip-
ment and they handed it to extremist 
militias inside Yemen. That is open- 
source reporting. The UAE copped to it 
when the reporters asked them wheth-
er they had done it. They gave our 
equipment to Salafist militias inside a 
theater of war. There are other reports 
that they were dropping American- 
made TOW missiles out of the sky into 
areas of that country that were con-
trolled by al-Qaida-aligned elements. 
And they are, right now, as we speak, 
in violation of the Libya arms embar-
go. 
The U.N. Panel of Experts came to 
the conclusion that the majority of 
arms transfers into Libya to the Haftar 
armed forces were either from Jordan 
or the United Arab Emirates. The 
panel found that the UAE was in re-
peated noncompliance with the arms 
embargo. 
And guess what is on the list of the 
weapons that the UAE was transferring 
into Libya in violation of a U.S.-sup-
ported arms embargo—armed drones.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7298 
December 9, 2020 
We are talking about selling the UAE 
the most lethal, most advanced armed 
drone technology in the world today, 
and as we speak, the UAE is in viola-
tion of the arms embargo to Libya, 
fueling that civil war, specifically 
sending drones into that theater. 
So I am not here to say that we 
shouldn’t be in the security business 
with the UAE. There are a lot of impor-
tant common projects. But the ques-
tion is, with a country that is part of 
the problem more often than part of 
the solution in Yemen, a country that 
is in existing violation of an arms em-
bargo in Libya, a country that has just 
within the last several years trans-
ferred our weapons to al-Qaida-aligned 
militias, 
without 
resolving 
those 
issues, is this the moment to be selling, 
for the first time ever, F–35s, armed 
drones into the heart of the Middle 
East? 
One last caution. The countries that 
I mentioned on this list are by and 
large in business with the United 
States and not with China and Russia. 
The UAE has pretty deep and com-
plicated 
defense 
relationships 
with 
China, Russia, and Chinese and Russian 
companies. Query whether we can be 
absolutely certain that the technology 
on board those fighter jets, those 
drones, is going to stay in the right 
hands. 
There arguably is no other country 
on the list for the F–35s that does as 
much business with China and Russia 
as the UAE does. In fact, as I men-
tioned, we pulled the F–35 program 
from Turkey because they are involved 
with Russia on a very complicated and 
important ground defense system, and 
we are just learning about the nature 
of the partnerships that the UAE has 
with the Chinese and the Russians. 
It stands to reason that this would be 
one of the issues that a consultative 
process with Congress would resolve. It 
also stands to reason that we could 
probably come to a conclusion during 
that consultative process. 
If the UAE really wants those weap-
ons, wants to be the first country in 
the heart of the Middle East to get the 
F–35 or the Reaper drones, then I as-
sume they would want to be able to as-
sure Congress and the administration 
that there is no chance of technology 
transfer into the wrong hands. That is 
what the congressional consultative 
process would have gotten us, but it 
didn’t happen in this case, and so we 
are stuck with this vote—a means for 
Congress to stand up for its right to 
participate in this question of arms 
sales. 
Believe 
me, 
my 
Republican 
col-
leagues are going to want that right 
when 
a 
Democratic 
administration 
comes into office. You are not going to 
want to send a signal today to the 
Biden administration that they don’t 
have to consult with you as the major-
ity party, potentially, in 2021. But if 
you vote against these resolutions, 
then you are essentially saying the 
Biden administration doesn’t need to 
consult with Congress on it. They prob-
ably will because they want to do the 
right thing, but anybody who votes 
against these resolutions is essentially 
endorsing an end-around of Congress by 
any 
administration, 
Republican 
or 
Democratic. 
It is also important to say that on 
policy grounds, it is not time to do 
these sales. There are too many out-
standing questions about who the UAE 
transfers weapons to, what they are 
doing in Libya, why they haven’t been 
part of the solution in Yemen, and 
what their relationship is with some of 
our most important adversaries around 
the globe. Until we satisfy the answers 
to those questions, we should not move 
forward with this sale. 
Finally, there is no threat to the ac-
cords 
between 
UAE 
and 
Israel 
unwinding if we simply press pause on 
this sale until those questions are an-
swered. 
I do want to be in business with the 
UAE. I think they are an important de-
fense partner. But I think there is far 
too much at stake with the sale of 
these weapons right now to rush it 
through, and I don’t think there is any 
downside risk if we were to say ‘‘not 
now’’ until we get all of our t’s crossed 
and all of our i’s dotted. 
Let’s stand up for Congress’s preroga-
tive on the sale of arms to foreign 
countries. Let’s slow down this process 
that has been rushed, potentially to 
the great detriment of U.S. national se-
curity. Let’s support these resolutions 
of disapproval this afternoon. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Hampshire. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to really high-
light the important work that has been 
underway by Members on both sides of 
the aisle in the Senate and Members on 
both sides of the aisle in the House to 
try to come up with an agreement to 
deliver urgently needed relief to ad-
dress 
the 
challenges 
from 
the 
coronavirus that people are facing 
across this country. I also hope that we 
can work together to get this across 
the finish line and that Senate leader-
ship will be willing to join in that ef-
fort. 
I think most of us are painfully 
aware of the devastating impact this 
pandemic has had in communities 
across our Nation, but the numbers do 
bear repeating. More than 15 million 
Americans have been infected with the 
virus, more than 285,000 Americans 
have now died from COVID, and we re-
cently hit a new record high of 102,000 
people hospitalized with COVID. Just 
to provide some context, our largest 
city in New Hampshire is Manchester. 
It has 112,000 residents. So we have 
enough people in the hospital across 
this country to fill the city of Man-
chester. 
The situation is dire. People need 
help. Every one of those numbers that 
I have referenced is much more than a 
number; it reflects an American life, an 
American family, our communities. 
The human toll of this crisis is crush-
ing, and we are up against the clock as 
our hospitals run out of beds. 
This 
crisis 
has 
been 
all-encom-
passing. In addition to the severe 
strains on our healthcare system, so 
many others are being battered by this 
pandemic. 
Small businesses are closing, and 
even more are on the verge of col-
lapsing if we don’t get them some help. 
Our transportation networks, from 
buses to airplanes, have been forced to 
lay off staff, cut routes, and in some 
cases just discontinue service alto-
gether. 
American families are going hungry. 
We have all seen the long lines on the 
news at night showing the number of 
people waiting to get food from food 
banks. 
Too many people are facing home-
lessness. In New Hampshire, in the city 
of Manchester alone, we have 35 home-
less encampments—35. Two years ago, 
we did not have that number of home-
less. 
Parents are struggling to help their 
children continue their education at 
home, sometimes with no access to 
broadband or really bad access. We 
know women are leaving the workforce 
because of the strains of trying to pro-
vide support to their children and deal 
with the other challenges of COVID. 
State and local governments have 
been stretched to the maximum. In 
New Hampshire, we are facing severe 
budgetary shortfalls, and many of our 
communities may have to make some 
difficult decisions to cut first respond-
ers or teachers or other municipal 
workers if they don’t get help. 
We hear every day the number of peo-
ple who need our help, and they can’t 
wait any longer. This is the holiday 
season, the end of the year. We are 
headed into the worst months of win-
ter. In New Hampshire, we have res-
taurants that can no longer be open be-
cause they don’t have outdoor seating. 
We have small businesses that are wor-
ried about getting through the next 
few months. 
For the past 3 weeks, we have had a 
group of bipartisan lawmakers in both 
the House and Senate—so bipartisan 
and bicameral—who have been engaged 
in good-faith negotiations to get a re-
lief package out the door as swiftly as 
possible. We were able to reach an 
agreement on a broad bipartisan frame-
work last week, and we have continued 
negotiations 
around-the-clock 
since 
that was announced. 
In New Hampshire and throughout 
this country, our small businesses have 
been some of the hardest hit by this 
pandemic. In New Hampshire, we are a 
small business State. They are the life-
blood of our economy. They account 
for 99 percent of all of our businesses 
and more than 50 percent of our work-
force. In the country as a whole, two- 
thirds of our jobs are created by small 
businesses. 
In the bipartisan framework that we 
are negotiating, we have another round

of the Paycheck Protection Program, 
which has been instrumental for so 
many of our small businesses since 
back in March when we passed it and 
created the program in the CARES 
Act. 
Overall, our bipartisan relief proposal 
would provide significant financial as-
sistance for our small businesses, for 
our restaurants, for our live venues, 
which in many cases have been shut 
down completely, and for our childcare 
centers. 
In New Hampshire, if we don’t get 
some help for our childcare centers, at 
the end of this pandemic, we will have 
lost fully 50 percent of our childcare 
centers. That means the families who 
depend on that childcare so that they 
can go to work are not going to have 
any safe place for their kids. 
I hear frequently from New Hamp-
shire businesses that have used the 
PPP program effectively to keep work-
ers on payroll and make rent that they 
still need more assistance if they are 
going to get through this winter. 
Our tourism and hospitality indus-
tries are particularly hard hit, and 
they are vital to New Hampshire’s 
economy. They are our second biggest 
industry. 
Restaurants in New Hampshire ac-
count for nearly 70,000 jobs and for $3 
billion in sales, according to the Na-
tional 
Restaurant 
Association. 
We 
have to provide some help for them. 
The future of our small businesses in 
New Hampshire and throughout the 
country hang in the balance. If we fail 
to act, we fail them. 
For many American families, the 
past 9 months have been the most dif-
ficult economic challenges of their 
lives, and the bleak jobs report last 
week reaffirms what we have been see-
ing in our communities. Nearly 10 mil-
lion jobs have been lost since the start 
of the pandemic. That means people 
are out of work, struggling to put food 
on the table for themselves and their 
families, struggling to keep a roof over 
their heads. The eviction moratorium 
is about to expire. That is the story for 
10 million families. 
In the bipartisan framework that we 
have been negotiating, we have ur-
gently needed funding for additional 
unemployment insurance. We provide 
rental assistance to help not just those 
people who might lose their housing 
but also the landlords, who have been 
hit very hard because people haven’t 
been able to pay their rent. It also in-
creases funding for food assistance pro-
grams to combat the surging food inse-
curity in our communities. 
We can’t afford further delay in de-
livering these resources. The unem-
ployment benefits are due to expire at 
the end of the month, and time is of 
the essence. 
One of the important areas of con-
cern that this bipartisan proposal ad-
dresses is the need for Federal funding 
to help our State and our local commu-
nities. They are facing massive revenue 
shortfalls—at least in my home State 
of New Hampshire—and that threatens 
their ability to provide essential serv-
ices. We can’t afford to lose those peo-
ple who provide those services, who, if 
they are laid off, may be forced to go 
someplace else and won’t be available 
when we have the money to rehire 
them. We can’t afford to lose the teach-
ers, and already we are seeing too 
many teachers who are retiring or 
leaving the profession because they are 
worried about safety and exposure, or 
they don’t have the resources to be 
able to do the online teaching that is 
required now. If we don’t get this fund-
ing out the door, we are going to see 
more of those losses. 
In New Hampshire and in our cities 
and towns, they are being stretched to 
the limits. We are at the precipice of 
this crisis. Cases are continuing to go 
up. Hospitalizations are going up. The 
death toll is going up. People need 
help, and they need it now. 
In 
New 
Hampshire, 
our 
nursing 
homes have been especially devastated 
by this crisis. We have the highest per-
centage of COVID deaths in our long- 
term care facilities of any State in the 
country. Eighty-one percent of our 
death toll has been tied to nursing 
homes. 
Our bipartisan relief framework in-
cludes necessary Federal support for 
the Provider Relief Fund, and it allo-
cates urgently needed help for our 
nursing 
homes 
that 
are 
on 
the 
frontlines. 
We also provide help to address sub-
stance use disorders and mental health. 
What we have seen across the country 
is that COVID–19 has exacerbated what 
already existed in the opioid epidemic. 
We were beginning to make some 
progress in New Hampshire and in 
many States across the country until 
the coronavirus hit, and now we are 
seeing that progress being lost. 
Our plan bolsters support for Federal 
investments in a number of programs 
that respond to the substance use dis-
order crisis in our communities, and it 
also addresses suicide prevention. 
This pandemic has created signifi-
cant burdens for those who are strug-
gling with substance use disorders. 
And, of course, we have heard the num-
ber of mental health issues has been 
greatly exacerbated. 
Our bipartisan plan addresses three 
of the most important pieces of the 
strategy to get on the other side of this 
pandemic: testing, tracing, and vaccine 
distribution. As overwhelming as this 
crisis has become, we can’t just throw 
our hands in the air. We have to con-
tinue to prioritize robust testing and 
contact tracing so we can track and 
contain community spread. Of course, 
we need to follow the CDC guidelines— 
wearing 
masks, 
maintaining 
social 
distancing, staying home as much as 
possible, hand washing—so that we can 
help flatten the curve and help our hos-
pitals. And now, as we are, we hope, 
just weeks away from having a vaccine, 
we need to ensure that every measure 
is taken so we are ready to go on day 
one. The manufacturing and distribu-
tion of a safe and effective COVID–19 
vaccine are critical to putting an end 
to this pandemic, to reopening our 
economy, and to restoring normalcy in 
our society. Our COVID framework 
boosts funding for each of these three 
priorities. 
When the Senate came together dur-
ing the early days of this crisis, we 
worked in good faith to deliver the 
CARES Act that provided relief to 
Americans throughout the country. We 
did it before, and I believe we can do it 
again. 
This bipartisan framework is the 
only bipartisan measure in Congress. It 
is the only bicameral measure in Con-
gress. It is the only proposal that has 
an opportunity to clear both Houses. 
We aren’t done, obviously. Negotia-
tions are ongoing. There are a lot more 
people who have to see this work and, 
hopefully, will decide to support it, and 
we still have more concerns to sort 
out. But this is a compromise. It 
doesn’t have everything I want to see. 
It is not what I would have written if I 
had been able to write it by myself, but 
it is a compromise that I believe we 
can get majority support to pass. 
Of course, it is step one. It is a relief 
bill to help Americans stay afloat over 
these next very difficult months, and 
our work doesn’t end if we can provide 
this relief. We are still going to need a 
stimulus bill to get our economy mov-
ing again. But, right now, the most ur-
gent need is to address those concerns 
that individuals and families have. 
If Congress fails to act and get this 
over the finish line, the consequences 
will be dire. Our hospitals are already 
overwhelmed. Too many small busi-
nesses are closing. Families are going 
hungry and facing homelessness. Inac-
tion is really not an option. We need to 
get this done. 
There is no reason we can’t come to 
an agreement. We have done it before. 
I urge Senators on both sides of the 
aisle to join in this effort. I urge Lead-
er MCCONNELL and Leader SCHUMER to 
move forward with us to help us get 
this proposal over the line so that to-
gether we can deliver much needed re-
lief to Americans and do it before the 
holiday season so that people will have 
something to look forward to. 
I yield the floor.

OFFICER

TRIBUTE TO DIANE DEATON 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I 
would like to speak for a few moments 
today about a Baton Rouge and Lou-
isiana rock star. I am talking about 
Baton Rouge’s own Diane Deaton. 
This week, Diane announced that she 
is going to retire from her post as a 
weather forecaster at WAFB-TV, which 
we refer to as Channel 9, where she has 
served on ‘‘9News This Morning’’ and 
on ‘‘Early Edition’’ for many years. 
Diane is known—widely known—af-
fectionately as Queen D. She has been 
reporting the weather for the people of 
Louisiana, particularly Southeast Lou-
isiana, for 37 years—37 years—and all

at the same station. Over a WAFB ca-
reer spanning, what, nearly four dec-
ades, Diane has become a beloved fix-
ture in our State and in our State cap-
ital. 
Her compassion has been on regular 
display—and not only in the way that 
she has walked Louisianians through 
hurricanes and tornadoes. Weather is 
important to us in Louisiana. Diane 
has invested in first and second graders 
at Buchanan Elementary in East Baton 
Rouge Parish through an extraordinary 
program called the Reading Friends 
program. She has built new homes for 
families through Habitat for Human-
ity, where she currently serves as a 
board member. Diane has been a part of 
LSU Tiger HATS pet therapy program. 
That is a program where she and her 
colleagues visit young patients and 
their families at one of our leading hos-
pitals, Our Lady of the Lake Children’s 
Hospital. 
Diane’s awards are many. I won’t list 
them all, but they include the Lou-
isiana 
Association of Broadcasters’ 
Lifetime 
Achievement 
Award, 
the 
Holly Reynolds Humanitarian of the 
Year Award—that was from the Capital 
Area Animal Welfare Society—and the 
Ulli Goodman Volunteer of the Year 
Award from the Baton Rouge Ballet 
Theater. I don’t know how she finds the 
time, but Diane is also certified as a 
Delta Society Pet Partner for her work 
using therapy animals. 
Yet I noticed that Diane’s announce-
ment was characteristically humble as 
she steps away after 37 years. Here is 
what she said: ‘‘I have never taken for 
granted the honor and privilege you 
have given me over these many years 
by choosing me and my colleagues here 
at WAFB-TV to keep you and your 
family safe and informed.’’ 
I think that the gratitude among 
Louisiana and Baton Rouge residents is 
certainly mutual. 
I am glad to hear that Diane will not 
be leaving our great State. I want to 
emphasize that. She is going to retire 
in Louisiana, and I hope she enjoys 
every moment—every single moment— 
she gets to sleep in after December 18. 
No one can argue—no fair-minded per-
son can argue—that she hasn’t earned a 
rest, even though her familiar weather 
forecast will be sorely missed in a 
State that takes more than our fair 
share of beatings from Mother Nature. 
I thank you for the chance to honor 
Diane Deaton. I thank you for the 
chance to honor Diane Deaton for all of 
her hard work on behalf of everyone 
who relies on WAFB-TV for news and 
for everyone in Louisiana and Baton 
Rouge whom her volunteer work has 
touched—and that numbers in the hun-
dreds of thousands. 
Diane, may the years ahead bring as 
much joy to you as you have brought 
to our State and our community. God 
bless you. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Arkansas. 
NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, for 
many years, I have supported the an-
nual National Defense Authorization 
Act. The bill always contains many 
worthy 
provisions, 
and 
it 
usually 
passes with large majorities. After all, 
who wants to vote no when the com-
mon refrain to pass the bill is ‘‘Support 
the troops’’? But at some point you 
have to draw the line, and this year is 
where I draw it. 
Just look at these bills over the last 
few years. Five years ago, the NDAA 
was 968 pages—not unusual around here 
and something you can get your hands 
around. But last year, the NDAA report 
was 1,794 pages, and this year the re-
port is an astonishing 4,517 pages—not 
even counting the classified annexes. I 
doubt anyone really knows what is in 
it except maybe some lobbyists. 
And get this: As the bill grew more 
than sixfold in length, we had even less 
time to read it. The number of people 
who could read the bill at any one time 
was 
restricted. 
Social 
distancing— 
‘‘Can’t have too many people in the 
room,’’ we were told. That is fine. I un-
derstand. We are still in a pandemic. 
But then we should have had more 
time to review the bill, not less. Yet 
Armed Services Committee members 
were asked on this floor last week to 
sign the bill after having only a couple 
of hours to review it. 
As this massive bill was written in 
secret and then rushed to a vote, some 
seem to have forgotten to consult with 
the Commander in Chief or recall that 
he has veto power. It is pretty well 
known that the President wants the 
bill to reform or repeal section 230, the 
giveaway to Big Tech oligarchs who 
get to censor the American people 
without consequence. 
The bill stiff-arms the President. 
There is not a word in more than 4,500 
pages about section 230. The sponsors 
claim they couldn’t airdrop provisions 
into the bill at the last minute. I take 
the point. I am not sure the President 
will, though, and he is the one with the 
veto. 
But there is more. The bill condemns 
the President for proposing to move 
some troops out of Germany and re-
stricts his ability to do so, even though 
NATO’s frontier has shifted hundreds 
of miles to the east and Germany 
hasn’t exactly carried its share of the 
NATO load. The Senate didn’t debate 
this major policy change. Our earlier 
bill didn’t even mention it. As far as I 
am concerned, this provision was, to 
borrow a phrase, airdropped without 
appropriate consultation with com-
mittee members. And for the record, I 
am a senior member of the committee, 
but I only learned about this provision 
in the newspaper on Friday, 2 days 
after I was asked to sign the bill. 
It would appear the standard for 
airdropping provisions into the bill is 
that we won’t airdrop things that sup-
port the President’s priorities, but we 
will airdrop stuff that thwarts his pri-
orities. I doubt that will get past the 
President’s veto either. 
This failure to consult committee 
members is not an isolated incident. 
The President’s 5G plan released valu-
able but unused spectrum owned by the 
government. The Pentagon protested 
mightily but only with vague evidence. 
We had a hearing on this issue, and it 
sharply divided committee members. 
Yet, again, this bill disrupts the Presi-
dent’s plan, and, again, we learned 
about it only after the fact. 
Another thing that happens behind 
closed doors is broken promises. We 
were promised last summer that the 
radical Warren amendment wouldn’t 
survive the conference committee. Not 
only did it survive; not a single word 
was changed. 
You may have heard about the War-
ren amendment. You probably heard 
that it would merely rename some 
Army bases that are named after Con-
federate officers. There is no harm in 
having that debate. I have always 
found it curious that we don’t have a 
base named after say U.S. Grant or 
John Pershing. 
Yet the Warren amendment is far 
more radical than merely renaming a 
few bases. The amendment explicitly 
applies to all military property. That 
is a lot more than bases. It includes 
military museums, service academies, 
and cemeteries. Do you think I am ex-
aggerating? I am not. Read the bill: no 
exceptions for museums, for academies, 
even for cemeteries. 
Let me give you just one example. 
The West Point library contains por-
traits of Grant and Lee in close prox-
imity, two commanders of the Civil 
War, juxtaposed as today’s cadets learn 
the history of our Nation, our Army, 
and their own school. But that painting 
may have to come down. So I suppose 
tomorrow’s cadets may learn that 
Grant defeated an unnamed enemy 
with an unnamed commander and ac-
cepted surrender from no one at Appo-
mattox. 
But if you really want to see the rad-
ical consequence of the Warren amend-
ment, just look across the river to Ar-
lington National Cemetery, our Na-
tion’s most sacred ground. Those gar-
dens of stone stretch in symmetrical 
rows across the horizon, except for a 
single odd section laid out in circles, 
rather than rows, and with pointed 
headstones, rather than rounded ones. 
The 482 graves in Section 16 contain 
the remains of Americans who rebelled 
against our country. That section also 
contains a memorial to those who died 
in that rebellion. 
We should be grateful that those 
rebels and their cause lost on the bat-
tlefield. Yet we should also be mindful 
of the historical context of this patch 
of our most sacred ground. Section 16 
of Arlington was created as a symbol 
not of secession but of reconciliation 
by the very men who had fought for the 
Union. 
President William McKinley—a deco-
rated veteran of the Union Army, pro-
moted 
three 
times 
for 
battlefield 
valor—oversaw its creation. In a dis-
play of magnanimity, he declared—in

front of the Georgia legislature, of all 
places—that the Federal Government 
would assume responsibility for Con-
federate graves. He then signed a bill 
authorizing the reinterment of Confed-
erate soldiers at Arlington. 
Senator WARREN apparently believes 
that she knows better how to handle 
the legacy of our Civil War than did 
the Union veterans who bled and de-
feated the Confederacy on the field of 
battle, or even Barack Obama, who 
continued a longstanding Presidential 
tradition in 2009 of sending a wreath to 
the Confederate section of Arlington on 
Memorial Day. 
If the professor gets her way, a crane 
may drive into Arlington and rip out 
the memorial whose history dates back 
to President McKinley and which was 
honored just a few years ago by Presi-
dent Obama. Again, I am not exag-
gerating. In the committee markup, 
Senator WARREN said that is exactly 
what she wants to happen. And if that 
happens, maybe the professor will be 
applauded in faculty lounges, but my 
perspective is a little different. 
I served at Arlington with the Old 
Guard. My soldiers and I laid to rest 
our Nation’s heroes. A lot of those fu-
nerals started in Section 16. Before 
those funerals started, we talked some-
times about that odd section and the 
war that occasioned it. After all, the 
Army has a lot of amateur Civil War 
historians. We were proud to wear the 
uniform of and be the heirs to Grant 
and Sherman and Sheridan—the great 
warriors who saved the Union and vin-
dicated freedom and equality for all. 
We also had a little humility. We 
didn’t presume that we knew better 
than Grant and McKinley how to heal 
our Nation’s wounds after the Civil 
War, or that we knew better than Abra-
ham Lincoln, who called for ‘‘malice 
toward none, with charity for all.’’ 
Maybe Senator WARREN and the Jac-
obins in our streets repudiate the wis-
dom of Lincoln and Grant and McKin-
ley. Perhaps they think Lincoln should 
be canceled. A mob tried to tear down 
his statue just a few blocks from here 
last summer. Too many of these Jaco-
bins condemn our Nation as racist to 
its core. They look at the Confederacy 
and see not a rebellion against America 
but the true heart of America. So, nat-
urally, their iconoclasm doesn’t stop 
with tearing down statues of Lee but 
moves right away to statues of Wash-
ington, Lincoln, and Grant. They tried 
to tear down those last summer, too, if 
you recall. 
I will never stand by while Jacobins 
tear down statues of Washington, Lin-
coln, and Grant, nor will I support a 
bill that permits a crane to drive into 
Arlington and desecrate that sacred 
ground. We celebrate the triumph of 
the Union and the cause of freedom and 
equality and the defeat of the Confed-
eracy, but why does it follow that we 
have to rip paintings off the walls of li-
braries and museums and tear down 
war memorials in Arlington National 
Cemetery? 
And I suspect a lot of other Senators 
wouldn’t support this bill either if they 
knew what it does. And that takes me 
back to a larger problem. We were 
promised 
this 
radical 
language 
wouldn’t be part of the final bill, but 
that promise was discarded behind 
closed doors. Now, we have a 4,500-page 
bill at the last minute in the rush to 
fund the government and pass another 
coronavirus relief bill before the holi-
days, all with the Presidential veto 
hanging over it. 
An overlong bill negotiated behind 
closed doors, dropped at the last 
minute, major policy shifts without 
consensus or even much debate, broken 
promises, wishful thinking about a 
veto threat—these are the hallmarks of 
an NDAA process that has deteriorated 
rapidly in recent years. That has to 
change. 
If 
it 
doesn’t 
change 
this 
month, mark my words, it will change 
next year. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
TRIBUTE TO DOUG JONES 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, sadly, 
I return to the floor today to say fare-
well to another Member who will con-
clude his time in the Senate at the end 
of the term, the junior Senator from 
Alabama, DOUG JONES. 
We all know DOUG came to the Sen-
ate as a storied courtroom lawyer and 
U.S. attorney, but fewer people know 
about his more humble origins. DOUG 
was born and raised in Fairfield, AL, 
just outside of Birmingham, the son of 
a steelworker, the grandson of a coal 
miner. When he was 19 years old, he 
spent his summer working at the local 
cotton tie mill, 10 hours a day, 6 days 
a week. 
One day, a freak accident sent a bit 
of shrapnel flying his way, and he came 
within inches of losing an eye. Several 
stitches later, DOUG went right back to 
work—early evidence of a stubborn 
streak. Only at the end of the summer 
did DOUG decide it was time to focus a 
bit more on his studies. 
That same work ethic—the some-
times stubborn work ethic—followed 
him his entire life. He brought it next 
to law school. On the one occasion 
DOUG decided to skip class, it wasn’t to 
throw a pigskin around the quad or en-
gage in some extracurricular activity 
with friends. No, DOUG skipped class to 
attend the trial of the Klansman ring-
leader of the 1963 bombing of the 16th 
Street Baptist Church, a tragedy that 
had shaken the conscience of a nation. 
A young DOUG JONES was moved by 
the disposition of justice in that trial, 
but he was left with the impression 
that other members of the conspiracy 
had escaped the reach of the law. Only 
a scriptwriter could have imagined 
that 24 years later, that law school tru-
ant would become the U.S. attorney in 
Alabama and that his office would un-
cover the evidence to bring charges 
against two more Klan members in-
volved in the bombing, and that 40 
years after that awful crime, DOUG 
JONES would win the conviction of the 
remaining conspirators, delivering a 
long-delayed yet righteous justice. 
History would repeat itself a few 
years later, when DOUG would again 
find himself at the center of events. 
DOUG was eating breakfast one day just 
blocks away from the scene of the 
bombing of the All Women Health Clin-
ic. He took charge that day and made 
sure that investigators and first re-
sponders worked together in perfect 
unison. DOUG would later go on to se-
cure the indictment of Eric Rudolph, 
the perpetrator of that heinous bomb-
ing, as well as the Olympic Park bomb-
ing 2 years later. 
Of course, not every one of DOUG’s 
cases involved matters of life and 
death. The U.S. attorney’s office once 
prosecuted local officials for trying to 
steal an election by bribing absentee 
voters with cash, beer, and a little liq-
uor for good measure. Now, if only the 
defendants had known about DOUG’s af-
finity for bourbon. 
Kidding aside, kidding aside, those 
years revealed for DOUG something pro-
found about public service and govern-
ment: You can have the best laws in 
the world in principle, but it takes 
dedicated effort to make the law work 
for everyone in practice, to take our 
ideals of justice and equality and fair-
ness and opportunity and make them 
real in the everyday lives of citizens. 
DOUG brought that revelation with 
him to this Chamber. He worked with 
his trademark determination to finally 
repeal the widow’s tax. He helped pass 
legislation to permanently fund his-
torically Black colleges and univer-
sities. He has worked across the aisle 
to combat veteran suicide, strengthen 
the VA, and support our military 
bases—so important to the great State 
of Alabama. 
Not every issue would be so easy or 
so bipartisan, especially for a new Sen-
ator facing a difficult reelection, but 
every time DOUG approached a politi-
cally sensitive vote—and I marveled at 
this—he was untroubled. He would do 
what he always did: He would act on 
principle. He would vote his con-
science—politics be damned. President 
Kennedy had a phrase for Senators 
whose abiding loyalty to their con-
science triumphed over all personal 
and political considerations. He called 
them profiles in courage. DOUG JONES 
is a profile in courage for our times. 
But before I get carried away with 
too many grand compliments, it is im-
portant to remind colleagues that 
DOUG JONES, as a human being, is just 
a joy to be around. Just ask his good 
friend, the Senator from Montana. 
More than once DOUG would catch Sen-

speech on the floor and think to him-
self: I will bet you he didn’t turn his 
phone off. Let me give him a ring and 
see what happens. 
(Laughter.) 
Just look at DOUG’S office, festooned 
with memorabilia of every particular: 
Crimson Tide footballs and keepsakes 
from his favorite bands. You can go see 
his rocking chair—one of those south-
ern-veranda, 
sweet-tea-drinking 
chairs—and baseballs signed by Presi-
dents, statesmen, and most impres-
sively 
to 
this 
Yankee 
fan, 
Joe 
DiMaggio. 
If DOUG JONES has one hobby besides 
hunting, it is autograph hunting. He 
has managed to collect a signature on 
a baseball from every Senator in this 
Chamber today, including its newest 
Member. The junior Senator from Ari-
zona was sworn in only a week ago, but 
5 seconds after he lifted his hand from 
that Bible, there was DOUG to con-
gratulate him, furnishing a clean base-
ball, ready for Mr. KELLY’s John Han-
cock. 
That is DOUG JONES—someone who 
never let the immense pressure of this 
job change who he is, someone who has 
made life a joy for everyone in our cau-
cus, and someone who understands 
that, at the end of the day, we get sent 
to this Chamber to make life better for 
our constituents, to do it courageously 
even when the odds are not in our 
favor. 
I will end with one final story. Sev-
eral years ago, DOUG was asked to par-
ticipate in a stage adaptation of his fa-
vorite work of fiction, ‘‘To Kill a 
Mockingbird,’’ which, of course, in-
cludes his literary icon, another great 
Alabama lawyer, Atticus Finch. 
Hearing DOUG’s life story, you would 
be forgiven for thinking it was ripped 
from the pages of that Harper Lee clas-
sic, so perhaps it was fate that one day 
DOUG would be asked to play a part in 
that story. There was just one hiccup: 
DOUG was asked to play the judge. So 
he never got to deliver that passage, 
shortly after the death of Mrs. Dubose, 
when Atticus explains to his son that 
real courage is not a man with a gun in 
his hand; ‘‘[real courage is] when you 
know you’re licked before you begin, 
but you begin anyway and see it 
through no matter what. You rarely 
win, 
but 
sometimes’’—sometimes— 
‘‘you do.’’ 
DOUG spent his time in the Senate— 
indeed, his whole life—embodying the 
courage that Atticus describes. The 
story of the 16th Street bombings is a 
reminder of the fact that even against 
tremendous evil and seemingly impos-
sible odds, if you are dogged and deter-
mined and see it through no matter 
what, sometimes you do win and jus-
tice prevails. 
So while DOUG
didn’t get to play 
Atticus Finch that weekend at the Vir-
ginia Samford Theater in Birmingham, 
that is OK. It was already the role of 
his lifetime. 
DOUG has said that it is the greatest 
honor of his life to fill the seat of his 
mentor, Senator Howell Heflin. 
DOUG, you upheld the honor of that 
seat, and you have set an example for 
every Senator who will follow in it. 
Whatever the next chapter of your 
life may bring, the entire Senate 
Democratic family wishes you and 
your family the very, very best and po-
litely requests that you do not call us 
when we are in the middle of giving a 
speech. 
(Laughter.) 
I yield to my friend, the very distin-
guished and wonderful, wonderful, won-
derful junior Senator from the great 
State of Alabama. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alabama. 
FAREWELL TO THE SENATE 
Mr. JONES. Mr. President, I thank 
the minority leader for those remarks. 
I am humbled. 
You know, everyone knows the old 
saying ‘‘My, how time flies when you 
are having fun.’’ My time here has 
drawn to a close, but despite the dif-
ficulties, the challenges, despite the 
rancor that we often see in this body, 
as well as Washington, DC, I can hon-
estly say I have had a lot of fun. The 
last 3 years have been amazing, and I 
have loved being a Member of this 
body. 
I actually was able to accomplish a 
few things, thanks to you. But you 
have been fun; you have not just been 
kind. It has really been good. 
By the way, your staffs have been 
awesome. I know you hear that a lot 
from constituents. Maybe you don’t 
hear it enough from other Senators. 
Your staffs have been amazing to us, 
and I really very much appreciate it. 
You know, as the minority leader 
said, everybody knows I am a baseball 
fan. If you go into that office, you will 
see in my reception area all 100 base-
balls that I had signed. And it was fun 
getting them—either here on the floor 
or in a committee room, at the retreat 
that the Democrats had. There were so 
many who had never signed a baseball, 
and you figured out that it wasn’t easy 
to sign a baseball. 
(Laughter.) 
And even those who signed in their 
office, when we sent them to their of-
fice, they always came up and talked 
about it. It was a time to put politics 
aside and just talk a little bit—some-
thing we really don’t do enough of 
around here, leaving the weighty poli-
tics and responsibilities that we have 
just to sign a baseball and talk about 
how much fun it was. 
I remember, right after I was elected, 
I was talking to a friend of mine, 
dreaming big about the things that we 
could accomplish that would make a 
difference in the lives of the people of 
Alabama and the people of America. 
We talked about the possibility that we 
could work on a bill as important as 
the Civil Rights Act of 1964 or the Vot-
ing Rights Act of 1965. But I knew—I 
knew, though—that such opportunities 
were not likely, especially in what I 
knew to be a 3-year window and not 
knowing what the future would hold— 
although, I have got to be honest, I had 
a pretty doggone good idea when I got 
here. 
If there was one thing my momma al-
ways taught me, it was to be realistic 
about things. I knew it was going to be 
tough, but to even have an opportunity 
to talk and work on things that bring 
such transformational changes—those 
kind of things come along once in a 
generation, if we are lucky. They are 
that legislative equivalent of a perfect 
game in baseball. You are lucky if you 
get to be part of that in your career, 
but you always have to hope and you 
have to strive for the possible, not just 
the likely. 
For those of you who really don’t 
know about baseball—there may be a 
few—a perfect game is just that: nine 
innings, three outs, three up, three 
down. Everything has to work together 
in synchrony. It is not just the pitcher 
who throws balls and strikes; it is the 
outfielder who catches the fly; it is the 
second baseman who has to get the out 
and throw the runner out at first. Ev-
eryone has to fall in line and work to-
gether as a team—as a team. And it is 
not just that; it is the people on the 
field. They are all working and they 
are all striving for the same goal. As it 
turned out, I didn’t get a chance to be 
part of a perfect game. I didn’t think I 
would, but I didn’t get that chance. 
Sometimes I worry, as many of you 
do—especially if you listened to the 
farewell speeches of LAMAR ALEXANDER 
and TOM UDALL and MIKE ENZI and oth-
ers—you worry if those perfect games 
can ever be had in this Senate again. I 
worry about that. But we always come 
close, and I came close. 
Right after I got here, I got invited 
to be part of the Common Sense Cau-
cus, which I had to explain to people in 
Alabama that that is really not an 
oxymoron, that there is common sense 
up here. 
But within 6 weeks of being up here, 
I was at SUSAN COLLINS’ office with so 
many here—some 20 Senators, Repub-
lican, Democratic—talking about im-
migration, working on immigration re-
form. It was the hottest topic of the 
day, an important topic that is still 
important today. I just marveled at the 
fact that here I was, 6 weeks into this, 
and I was in that room being a part of 
those discussions. 
What was even more astonishing to 
me is that people actually wanted to 
hear what I had to say. That didn’t 
happen, having raised three children, 
been married. I don’t always get that, 
when people want to know what you 
have got to say. But they did, and I was 
so gratified, and I was so honored. 
We would meet in Senator COLLINS’ 
office. We would meet in hideaways. It 
was exciting. And we came so close. 
You all remember that? We came so 
close, within about three votes of doing 
what they said couldn’t be done, of 
doing something that was possible but 
not probable. 
That sense, what I saw of my col-
leagues, is why we ran for the Senate.

I could see it. I could feel it in those 
rooms, in those discussions. I could see 
it on the floor that day as people were 
voting. It is why we wanted to be in 
this body. 
I remember sitting in the cloakroom, 
and I was as disappointed as ever when 
we failed. And for a long time, probably 
still to this day, when I am asked 
‘‘What is your most disappointing day 
in the Senate?’’ I will always talk 
about that vote that failed so close, 
which was so important. But what it 
did demonstrate is, through that ef-
fort—effort—that anything is possible. 
You have got to come close sometimes 
before you get across the finish line. 
You have got to play in the red zone a 
little bit before you get the touchdown. 
You have got to hit that line. 
But whatever we did, it is possible. 
The Senate is capable of great things, 
if we do them, of bridging divides that 
society may view as too wide to cross. 
We can do that. It is not that wide be-
tween here and there. It is not that 
wide, and people need to know it and 
respect it. 
I am not the first and I certainly will 
not be the last to talk about the impor-
tance of bringing people together who 
hold opposing views and working to-
ward what is both possible and palat-
able. But all too often the desire to do 
that kind of gets lost among other ac-
tions that don’t quite match the words 
that we say. 
I noticed the other day how many 
heads were nodding in the farewell 
speech of Senator ALEXANDER, Senator 
ENZI, and Senator UDALL. And then 
what happens? I have looked at a lot of 
farewell speeches in the last month. 
They all say a lot of the same things, 
and everybody, I am sure, nods. 
We have got to do better. You have 
to do better. I don’t think I fully appre-
ciated it. And I listened to the minor-
ity leader talk about where I come 
from in Fairfield, but I don’t think I 
fully appreciated it until fairly re-
cently. It seems like I just kind of love 
a lost cause. It seems like every time 
that there is something that needs me 
there, I am there—fighting for justice 
for others, for others who feel like hope 
is lost, from the church bombing case 
to a Senate election in Alabama. I 
fought for those causes because I be-
lieve in hope. I believe in redemption. I 
believe in the possibility. Some may 
call that naive, and many have, but I 
have not been afraid to touch on the 
so-called ‘‘third rail’’ issues of our po-
litical system because I believe that, 
right now especially, there is no time 
for caution. 
My first speech on the Senate floor 
was about gun violence. No one could 
believe a Senator from Alabama actu-
ally talked about how we can stop gun 
violence in a way that made some 
sense—not from an extreme view on 
the right or an extreme view on the 
left but right there in ways that made 
sense. 
It was a topic that I knew could have 
easily been twisted into a negative 
campaign ad—which, by the way, it 
was. 
(Laughter.) 
We saw it coming. But I also knew 
action was so important. We took some 
small steps on that issue over the last 
3 years, despite a lot of political pres-
sure to the contrary, and I hope you 
will do more in the years ahead be-
cause lives will depend on it. 
Everything doesn’t have to be a per-
fect game. There is great satisfaction 
in the day-to-day triumphs. You can 
and we did hit a home run or two and 
more than our share of singles and dou-
bles. I am really proud of the 20-plus 
bills that I led or co-led, bipartisan 
bills, that have been signed into law 
over the last 3 years. None would have 
been possible without bipartisan work. 
One of my first original bills, the 
Civil Rights Cold Case Records Collec-
tion Act would never have become law 
without the commitment of Senator 
CRUZ to help bring long-overdue clo-
sure to the victims of those terrible 
crimes. 
I see TED in the back. I appreciate 
Senator CRUZ’s involvement in that. I 
will have to say, it was so much fun, 
after we got that done, to go back 
home and tell that to all my Demo-
cratic friends. What is your proudest? I 
said: Well, the proudest moment right 
now is with my partner, TED CRUZ. 
They said: Aha. 
But it shows what is possible, folks. 
And it was an important bill. None of 
those bills have meant more to me, 
though, than the bipartisan effort that 
I led with Senator COLLINS to elimi-
nate the military widow’s tax that for 
almost two decades had deprived wid-
ows of full survivors’ benefits that they 
deserved. 
So many of you went to bat for that 
bill: Senator REED, Senator INHOFE, 
and others. You were getting a lot of 
pressure, not from me or SUSAN COL-
LINS. You were getting pressure from a 
lot of those military widows. They had 
been up here for 20 years, and for 20 
years the dollars and cents had pre-
vented that from becoming a reality. 
We fought on that because we knew 
what we were doing was right. We 
knew it was right that you could not 
put a price on the duty we owe to the 
men and women of our armed services 
and their families. 
I will never forget that day in De-
cember when we passed the NDAA that 
included the elimination of the widow’s 
tax. In the Gallery, there was a large 
group of Gold Star widows who had 
been up here for 20-plus years to try to 
get that done, never being able to 
reach the goal. And on that day, we did 
it. You did it. SUSAN and I got a lot of 
credit, but it was this body, with the 
help of some folks in the House, that 
made it happen. That was just one of 
the memorable days on the floor. 
Swearing-in day was unbelievable— 
simply an explosion of emotions. To 
walk on the floor as a U.S. Senator, 
some 37 years after I left the floor with 
my old boss as a young staffer to my 
mentor Howell Heflin, and to take the 
oath of office for his seat was just real-
ly a remarkable circle of life. 
There are two especially significant 
things about that day too. One is that 
I hope that you all recognize by now 
that the freshman class of 2018 will 
likely go down in history as one of the 
greatest freshman classes ever. The 
team of SMITH and JONES can’t be beat. 
It is as American as apple pie. I was 
really proud and honored to be there 
with TINA SMITH that day. 
I was also honored, if you recall, that 
there were three Vice Presidents on the 
floor of the Senate that day. Now 
President-Elect Joe Biden escorted me 
in. Former Vice President Walter Mon-
dale escorted Senator SMITH. MIKE 
PENCE, the current Vice President, 
swore us in. And, actually, if you now 
think about it, we had a fourth—soon- 
to-be Vice President KAMALA HARRIS. 
That is a pretty remarkable time— 
pretty remarkable. 
It was also a remarkable day when 
what I hope is going to be a new tradi-
tion in the Senate took place: When we 
had on two different occasions, once 
each year, six Senators—three Demo-
crats and three Republicans—reading 
Dr. King’s ‘‘Letter from a Birmingham 
Jail.’’ That document remains one of 
the most significant in American his-
tory, and it is as important today as it 
was when it was written in 1963—and, 
in some ways, maybe more important 
for the moment we find ourselves in. I 
have asked—and I know he will do 
this—my colleague Senator BROWN to 
carry on that tradition in my absence. 
And then there was the day of the 
swearing-in in January of 2019. I was 
here to observe, to pay my respects to 
all those who were returning and for 
those who were joining. And as I was 
standing in the back by the cloakroom, 
Senator TESTER
walks up and says: 
JONES, what are you doing? 
You can’t get anything past TESTER. 
There were probably a few profanities 
ladened in there as well, if you know 
Senator TESTER. 
I said: Well, JON, what do you think 
I am doing—with probably a couple of 
other kind of milder profanities. 
He said: Look, DAINES is caught in a 
snowstorm back home and can’t make 
it here, and I would like for you to es-
cort me down when I take the oath. 
As it turns out, it is likely to be the 
only time I get to do that—and it was 
a true honor, my friend. 
Simply sitting at this desk is perhaps 
the greatest thing, taking this place in 
and watching each of you, noting the 
bipartisanship, especially as we close 
the Congress—especially as we close 
this Congress—and how Senators move 
freely from one side of the aisle to the 
other. Occasionally, I will tell you, I 
confess, that I just come back here by 
myself, and I will open this drawer and 
will read the names of the Senators 
who 
sat 
here: 
John 
Kennedy, 
Ed 
Muskie, Hubert Humphrey, my col-
league Senator SHELBY, and so many 
others. And it is just overwhelming.

S7304 
December 9, 2020 
You know, growing up, it was always 
the Presidents or Presidential can-
didates who captured my attention. I 
knew the names of some Senators, but 
that began to change for me watching 
the Senate Select Committee on Wa-
tergate when I was in college. It was a 
remarkable time and a remarkable 
committee. 
And 
then 
everything 
changed again in 1979 while I was 
studying for the bar and got a phone 
call from Senator Heflin’s chief of 
staff, Mike House. I had campaigned 
for the judge. Mike offered me a 1-year 
position on Heflin’s Judiciary sub-
committee, which I eagerly took. That 
year not only changed my life but 
brought about a respect for this body, 
for the Senate—as an institution, as in-
dividuals, and for so many of its Mem-
bers—that I had never had before. 
From that point on, folks, I was 
hooked. I was hooked on this body—be-
fore being elected to the Senate. And 
now I have come to love the Senate a 
lot and, importantly, all of the possi-
bilities that go with it, which is why I 
don’t really want to spend my last mo-
ments on the floor talking about what 
I have done. I want to talk about what 
needs to be done, what can be done, 
what is possible. 
You know, even back in 2017, people 
said it was just not possible to elect a 
Democrat from Alabama to the U.S. 
Senate—and here I have been. 
It is possible to make affordable 
quality healthcare a reality for all 
Americans. The ACA right now is the 
best hope and only plan that is out 
there. As President Obama said—and 
everybody should do this—if there is a 
better plan you can come up with, put 
it out there. Let’s do it. I will publicly 
support it. 
The goal is healthcare for everyone 
in some way. There are so many in this 
country and in my State of Alabama 
who desperately need it—before, dur-
ing, and after this COVID crisis. It is 
possible to give people in remote and 
rural areas access to healthcare, but it 
is going to take a lot of work, and it is 
going to take getting out of partisan 
corners. 
It is possible to provide a quality 
education to every American child. I 
know education is often funded locally, 
but it is possible to do it. You just have 
to roll up your shirt sleeves and get it 
done. 
It is possible to extend broadband— 
access to broadband—to all Americans 
and bring every man, woman, and child 
into the modern era, just like we did— 
the Congress did—with Franklin Roo-
sevelt in the Rural Electrification Act 
in the 1930s. Broadband is the new 
power. It is possible to do that. High 
speed and affordable, that is key—af-
fordable broadband. 
It is possible to ease the burdens on 
working-class Americans by setting a 
minimum wage that is not going to 
hamstring businesses but will raise the 
quality of living for so many in this 
country. So many in my State are in 
poverty, but yet they work. They work. 
They work hard, but yet they are still 
below that poverty level. We need to do 
what we can to lift them out of that 
poverty. It takes a lot of work. It takes 
hard work. 
It is possible for law enforcement to 
serve and protect all Americans—not 
just some—to root out the systemic 
racism that exists within law enforce-
ment by enlisting the support of both 
law enforcement and the communities. 
It is possible. 
I will candidly tell you another great 
disappointment was when we let that 
moment 
pass 
this 
summer—hoping 
that with a new President, maybe a 
new Senate, maybe a new Congress, we 
could get something accomplished. I 
hope that that still happens, but I was 
disappointed we let that moment pass 
this summer when all of the country 
and all of the world was behind us to 
say: Please do something. Please do 
something that we have known about 
for decades, for centuries. Please do 
something. 
Law enforcement said: Let’s do some-
thing. 
We let it pass. But it is never too late 
to do the right thing. It is never too 
late for justice. 
It is possible to ensure that every eli-
gible voter is able to cast a ballot and 
have it counted. Now is the most im-
portant opportunity we have seen in 
2020—concerns about our election proc-
ess; that it might have been stolen; 
that there might have been fraud. Use 
that opportunity to say: Let’s don’t let 
these allegations have any credence 
going forward. Let’s get together. The 
technology is there. 
Figure out a way that together we 
can make our election safe and secure 
and that all people will have access to 
the ballot box—all people who are eli-
gible to vote in this country. 
It is possible for our system of justice 
to treat all Americans equally—not 
just talk about it, but to do it. It is 
what I have tried to do throughout my 
career. It is possible. 
And this is going to be a challenge. It 
is possible to restore the American peo-
ple’s faith in government. And we all 
know right now that that faith has 
been shaken for many, many reasons. 
The faith has been shaken, but it is 
possible to restore it. It is possible for 
each of us to learn—as Atticus Finch 
taught us—to see things from another 
person’s point of view, to walk around 
in their skin or in their shoes, to see 
things from other’s point of view, to 
find that common ground. 
It is possible for us to realize that 
deep down that progress is not a zero- 
sum game, that a rising tide lifts all 
boats. 
These things are not easy. They take 
dedication and hard choices, but they 
are worthy goals. I know many of my 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle are 
dedicated to the same goals, and 
though I won’t be able to cosponsor 
anything with you from this point on 
or debate the amendments in com-
mittee—if you get amendments in com-
mittee—I am going to support you in 
whatever efforts I can, no matter what 
side of the aisle your desk is on. And I 
will keep working toward the same 
goals too, even after I leave this place. 
Remember, though, as we get into 
the vitriol, as we get into political 
rhetoric—just remember the Jones law 
of politics, adapted from Newton’s 
third law. Just remember that for 
every action, even in politics, there is 
an equal and opposite reaction. If you 
go too far on one side or the other, you 
are going to get a reaction on the other 
side, just as hard. And that makes it 
harder and harder to reach that com-
mon ground. 
You know, in Senator BROWN’s book 
about his desk and the people in his 
desk, he quotes the political philoso-
pher Hannah Arendt who observed: 
‘‘The good things in history are usually 
of very short duration, but afterwards 
have a decisive but a short time of in-
fluence’’—a long influence—‘‘over what 
happens over long periods of time.’’ 
A short time—and I know you may be 
thinking, well, DOUG was only here 3 
years; so that is what he is talking 
about. But I am not. In history, I am 
looking at something bigger—whether 
it was Martha McSally’s 2 years or my 
3; 
Senator 
GARDNER’s 
6; 
Senator 
UDALL’s 12; Senator ALEXANDER’s 18; or 
ENZI’s and ROBERTS’ 24; or, if you are 
like PAT LEAHY, since Moses was in the 
bulrushes. 
Our time here is short. There is not 
anybody on this floor right now who is 
not thinking about their time since 
they were sworn in and said that it was 
just like yesterday, because it was. Our 
time is short. It is of a limited dura-
tion, and we have to act like that. We 
have to make sure that every day we 
are moving. 
It has been a realization of a long- 
held dream. I have so many to thank: 
Doug Turner, who is here; Joe Trippi, 
on my campaigns; and my late friend, 
Giles Perkins; and an amazing family: 
my bride Louise, my rock; my two 
boys, Carson and Christopher, who 
have wanted to kill both me and Louise 
since they have been living at home 
during the pandemic. They have been 
incredibly supportive. And then my 
daughter Courtney and her husband 
Rip and her two beautiful girls, my 
granddaughters, 
who 
are 
still 
the 
brightest stars in my sky, Ever and 
Ollie. 
I am grateful to each of you, my col-
leagues, and all that you helped me 
with. 
I am grateful to an amazing staff. I 
am not going to go all the way through 
it. They have been true rock stars. I 
am going to enter something into the 
RECORD about my staff. 
I am grateful for the advice and 
counsel of Alabama’s senior Senator 
and an old friend, Senator SHELBY. 
While RICHARD and I may disagree on 
many policies, we share a commitment 
to the people of Alabama to make sure 
that we do all we can to get the people 
in Alabama the quality of life that

they deserve, and I so much appreciate 
Richard’s service to the people of the 
State of Alabama, his long and distin-
guished service—which started out as a 
Democrat, by the way, just saying. 
That is where the seed was planted, 
folks. 
I also want to mention briefly the 
chairmen of the committees I worked 
on: Senator CRAPO, Senator INHOFE, 
Senator ALEXANDER—who was one of 
the first people who helped me come 
over—and the work that we did to-
gether. You pulled me and helped me. 
Senator COLLINS, who chaired the 
Aging Committee. 
But I am especially grateful for the 
ranking members of those committees: 
Senators BROWN, CASEY, MURRAY, and 
REED. Their friendship and counsel 
have been invaluable. 
Of course, I want to thank the minor-
ity leader for all of his work for me and 
on behalf of me. And as I think you 
guys know—not always the people of 
Alabama—Senator 
SCHUMER
never 
tried to put puppet strings on me. I 
know I got accused of that, but he 
never ever tried and, for that, I am 
very grateful. 
To the people of Alabama, I promised 
to do my best to represent each of you, 
whether or not you voted for me, and I 
am proud of the work that we did on 
your behalf and that I have accom-
plished on your behalf. Thank you to 
the people for giving me the honor of 
serving you as your Senator. 
Finally, I am going to resist the urge 
to tell you what is wrong with the Sen-
ate, how it operates today. You hear it 
virtually every time a Senator gives a 
farewell address, and, instinctively, 
you know it deep down. But I will offer 
you this. There is a book I finished 
reading recently that Ira Shapiro, a 
former staffer, wrote. Many of you may 
remember or know Ira. He wrote a 
book called ‘‘The Last Great Senate.’’ 
It ought to be required reading for 
every Senator coming in. It was pub-
lished 8 years ago, about the two Con-
gresses during the Carter administra-
tion and how they operated—Bob Byrd 
as majority leader, Howard Baker as 
the minority leader, how they got 
things done for the American people. 
The author laments that the Senate 
doesn’t operate today in that fashion. I 
was here for one of those years. Sen-
ator LEAHY was here during that time. 
His closing is even more important 
today as it was when the book was pub-
lished. He said: 
America is adrift in turbulent and dan-
gerous waters. Facing enormous challenges 
at home and abroad, we urgently need our 
once-vaunted political system to function at 
its best, instead of at its worst. To be sure, 
it is more difficult being a senator today 
than it was in the 1960’s and 1970’s. The in-
creasingly vitriolic political culture, fueled 
by a twenty-four-hour news cycle, the end-
less pressure to raise money, the prolifera-
tion of lobbyists and demanding, organized 
interests are all well known, and they take a 
toll. But all of those factors make it more 
essential that our country has a Senate of 
men and women who bring wisdom, judg-
ment, experience, and independence to their 
work, along with an understanding that the 
Senate must be able to take a collective ac-
tion in the national interest. 
Please remember that as you go 
about the country’s business; remem-
ber that as you go about the Senate’s 
business; remember that as you go 
about your business as a Senator. And 
as you do, keep and preserve the rev-
erence that the Founders envisioned 
for this body. As former Majority Lead-
er Mike Mansfield once said, ‘‘The con-
stitutional authority . . . does not lie 
with the leadership. It lies with all of 
us, 
individually, 
collectively, 
and 
equally. . . . In the end, it is not the 
Senators as individuals who are of fun-
damental importance. . . . In the end, 
it is the institution of the Senate. It is 
the Senate itself as one of the founda-
tions of the Constitution. It is the Sen-
ate as one of the rocks of the Repub-
lic.’’ 
Something we should all remember. 
One more little bit of advice. Take 
out the word ‘‘negotiation’’ when you 
are talking about legislation. Don’t 
talk about negotiating this bill or that 
bill, whether it is COVID relief or even 
appropriations. It works, but let me 
tell you what is happening out there, 
what is happening out there with the 
people. They hear those words, and 
they think this is some side or the 
other trying to get an advantage. It is 
like labor and unions. It is like a civil 
or criminal lawsuit. Somebody is try-
ing to get an advantage to try to do 
things for their own interests. 
We can talk about it from the Demo-
cratic side of how we are working for 
the people; we are negotiating for the 
people. We can talk about it from the 
Republican side; that we are negoti-
ating for patriotism and businesses to 
make sure they are protected. But 
what is being heard by the American 
people is this is all about Democrats; 
this is all about Republicans and get-
ting that political power. 
Talk about common ground. Talk 
about sitting down with the adminis-
tration or whomever and finding com-
mon ground. Talk about the goals that 
you agree on and how to get there. 
‘‘Negotiation’’ is just a bad word, and I 
hate that, but it is. 
As I prepare for the next chapter of 
my life’s journey, there is a sadness of 
what I am going to leave behind, but 
there is also optimism—optimism, the 
glass half full, the men and women who 
serve in this body and their successors 
and the staff who support them. And I 
emphasize that, again, the staff who 
support them. Leading together will 
continue to bring a better future for 
the American people, for your constitu-
ents, for each of us together, not as a 
caucus but together as a Senate. 
You are just a damn, unbeatable 
team. You are an unbeatable team. 
May God bless you all. May God con-
tinue to bless the United States of 
America. 
Mr. President, with a deep sense of 
humility and gratitude, I say for the 
last time, I yield the floor. 
(Applause, Senators rising.) 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. COT-
TON). The Senator from Alabama. 
Mr. SHELBY. What a good speech 
here. We don’t hear them like that 
every day. 
To my colleague Senator JONES, 3 
years was not a long time here, but we 
feel his presence. I can tell you that I 
have known DOUG a long time. I re-
member I came to the U.S. House when 
he came up to work in the Senate for 
Senator Heflin in the Judiciary Com-
mittee and so forth. 
I supported him when he was nomi-
nated by President Clinton to be the 
U.S. attorney in the Northern District 
of Alabama, where he did a tremendous 
job. I worked with him day after day, 
as we all do, on a lot of issues that af-
fected the country but affected, espe-
cially, our State of Alabama at times, 
and we worked hand in glove. 
We have become friends. We have our 
differences, but we also have a lot of 
things that he talked about today 
where we would come together for the 
State and for the country. 
I wish him well. I think we will hear 
more from him in the weeks ahead, in 
the months ahead. I certainly hope so. 
He has a lot to give. 
He has a great family. He has a great 
wife in Louise and a great partner 
there. 
He has a great staff and we worked 
together and we will continue to do 
this. 
But one theme—and I like that he 
kept expounding on it here today—that 
if we work together in the Senate, Re-
publicans 
and 
Democrats, 
we 
get 
things done; if not, things don’t hap-
pen. 
I wish Senator JONES Godspeed and 
wish him the best. 
Mr. President, today I would like to 
speak about my fellow Alabama col-
league and friend, Senator DOUG JONES. 
I have known DOUG JONES since he 
was a young staffer working for Sen-
ator Howell Heflin on the Senate Judi-
ciary Committee. During his 3 years as 
a Member in the Senate, I believe we 
have worked well together. 
He and his staff have shown a lot of 
professionalism and class while in 
Washington. He is respected by all of 
his colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle. 
While we may not agree on every pol-
icy, DOUG understands the Senate and 
respects the institution. It has been an 
honor to serve with him. 
Annette and I have enjoyed spending 
time with DOUG and Louise, and we 
wish them all the best. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the 
floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Montana. 
Mr. TESTER. I am going to be very, 
very short. 
The truth is that serving with DOUG 
JONES has been a once-in-a-lifetime op-
portunity for me. This guy’s last name 
shouldn’t be JONES; it should be ‘‘Jus-
tice.’’ He is somebody like nobody I

have ever seen, whose moral compass is 
so tuned into right that it has just 
been an incredible pleasure for me to 
be able to serve with him and to know 
him and to also wish him the best mov-
ing forward. 
I don’t think we have heard the last 
of DOUG JONES. DOUG is not the kind of 
person who will shrink away. There 
will be another moment where he can 
exhibit his ability of common sense, as 
he has done here in the U.S. Senate for 
the last 3 years. 
I am deeply going to miss his friend-
ship and his ability to sort the wheat 
from the chaff because he has been able 
to do that from day one and continued 
today with his farewell speech. 
I just want to say, God bless you, 
DOUG JONES, and God bless your fam-
ily. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I 
heard a lot about DOUG JONES before he 
got here from another courageous 
former U.S. attorney, Hal Hardin from 
Nashville. I was not disappointed when 
he arrived. 
DOUG JONES reminds me of another 
former Democrat who was very effec-
tive in the Senate, Ted Kennedy. Ted 
Kennedy would come on the floor and 
make the most—well, no one could ever 
say he abandoned his principles, based 
upon his speeches. He would stand back 
there in the back, and the things he 
would say would rally any Republican 
Lincoln Day Dinner. In fact, all I had 
to do back in Tennessee to stir up the 
Republican crowd was to mention Ted 
Kennedy. I did that on a regular basis. 
However, when I made my maiden ad-
dress, without my knowing it, Ted 
Kennedy went around and got 20 co-
sponsors for the legislation I intro-
duced that day, and I got a good dose of 
what it means to be an effective U.S. 
Senator, somebody who sticks to his or 
her opinions but, at the same time, 
who knows we are here to try to work 
on some sticky issues and get a result 
that most of us can vote for and that 
the country can accept. 
In his time here, DOUG JONES did 
that. I got to watch him because he 
was a member of the Health, Edu-
cation, Labor, and Pensions Com-
mittee. Senator Kennedy used to chair 
that committee, working with Senator 
ENZI, Senator Gregg, Senator Hatch, 
and others to produce a lot of legisla-
tion. He used to say that committee 
has one-third of all the jurisdiction in 
the Senate. Maybe that is about right. 
DOUG JONES was one of the newest 
Senators. We have 23 members. He was 
way down at the end of the line, but I 
noticed he always came and he always 
asked questions and he always listened. 
He seemed to me to be trying to say 
what he believed but learn from the 
witnesses how to get a result. 
Let me just mention one contribu-
tion he made that I think will stick 
with him and with the people of Ala-
bama and this country for a long time. 
That was the work we did in 2019. Sen-
ator MURRAY and I, DOUG JONES, Sen-
ator TIM SCOTT, Senator BENNET of Col-
orado were on it from the beginning to 
do two things at once that helped low- 
income Americans who wanted to go to 
college. 
The first was to simplify the dreaded 
FAFSA, the Federal Aid application 
form that 20 million Americans fill out 
every year that is 108 questions long. 
About 90 of them are unnecessary; ev-
erybody agrees. For years, we have 
been working on that to try to simplify 
it. Finally, we got a significant part of 
that done. 
DOUG JONES played a major role in 
that because what that legislation did 
was to say to the low-income family in 
Alabama or Tennessee or Arkansas or 
Illinois—wherever—you don’t have to 
send your tax information into the 
Federal Government twice and let 
them then see if they can catch you 
making a mistake and hold up your 
Pell grant for 2 months while you fig-
ure that out. All you have to do is 
check a box, and the Internal Revenue 
Service will fill out the tax questions 
on your Pell grant application for you 
so that there is no chance of making a 
mistake. That made a big difference. 
And at the very same time, we agreed— 
Republicans and Democrats—to perma-
nently fund historically Black colleges. 
It was a goal that had been there for a 
long time. 
So I would say to my friend from 
Alabama that I hope he puts that on 
his wall somewhere because that helps 
a few hundred thousand low-income 
families in Alabama alone. There is 
some work still to be done on that to 
finish the job, to finish the FAFSA 
simplification, and there may be some 
other support for historically Black 
colleges that we might even be able to 
get done while you and I are still here. 
Yet I wanted to acknowledge a Sen-
ator who arrived, went to work, stuck 
to his principles, worked across the 
aisle, and got results. You can’t have a 
much better scorecard than that. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia. 
Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I also 
rise to acknowledge my dear, dear 
friend DOUG, but I do it in a different 
vein. So many good things have been 
said, and I think anyone who knows 
DOUG
or who has paid attention to 
what has been said today had found it 
has been very accurate as far as his 
having a commitment to the rule of 
law and his compassion for any person, 
especially for those who haven’t had 
the same opportunities as all of us 
have had in life. That is what has 
moved us all. Yet I have gotten to see 
him in a different light. 
He and Louise invited me down. I got 
to campaign with them, and it was all 
about Alabama. I got to go down and 
spend a couple of days. That tells you 
of the true person. It not only tells you 
what he believes and what he feels for 
the people of his State and how he rep-
resents them, but it truly tells us what 
the people of his State think of him. I 
saw it firsthand. I saw it at a football 
game. Now, Nick Saban and I grew up 
together in a small, little coal mining 
community. 
I want you to know that Coach Saban 
and Terry, his wife, send their best. 
They want to thank you for your serv-
ice. 
To see the fans gather around DOUG 
and to see the happiness that he and 
Louise had when we were just out, 
going through the tailgates, was a won-
derful, wonderful sight. That tells me 
everything about his purpose for being 
here. I hope those in Alabama know 
how truly fortunate they are to have 
this gentleman, who loves Alabama 
with every fiber and bone in his body. 
He has given them everything he has 
and has represented their State better 
than any State I have ever seen rep-
resented with the true passion that he 
has. 
I love you, buddy. Thank you. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have 
had the privilege of serving with many, 
many Senators of both parties and 
with very many whom I have ap-
plauded. Some stand out specially— 
some for their longevity and some for 
who they are. DOUG JONES stands out 
for who he is. 
I think, in listening to his work as a 
prosecutor—of course, that is near and 
dear to my heart in my having been a 
prosecutor—I had never faced what he 
had. I think of his discussion of the 
summation he gave in the trial of the 
people involved with the bombing of 
the church in Alabama and the killing 
and maiming of youngsters. In fact, I 
had a chance to meet one of the sur-
vivors of that with DOUG, and I saw 
how she had felt about him all these 
years later because he had had the 
courage to stand up and do something 
that may not have been popular with 
some in his State, but that had been 
the right thing to do. In all of the 
years I have known him here, what he 
has done has been the right thing to do. 
Now, I have only had one objection 
about him. He showed me a picture 
that was taken when this young man, 
DOUG JONES, was working for Howell 
Heflin—Judge Heflin, as I recall. They 
were standing there with these gray 
beards, and this Senator from Vermont 
asked: Who is the youngster in the pic-
ture? 
Senator JONES, thank you for bring-
ing that. I know Ann Berry, in my of-
fice, got a kick out of that because she 
had the opportunity to work with you. 
We have done things that we have 
been able to joke about, like being in 
an airplane, where he was sitting in the 
front and I was sitting in the back. 
Fortunately, it was on the ground. Sen-
ator JONES hollered out to somebody, 
one of the military people there: Where 
is the button for the ejection seat for 
the back? 
It caught my attention.

I have also seen this man sit there 
and try to discuss legislation. He would 
ask: How will that help people? I don’t 
want this because it is politically bene-
ficial to me. How will it help people? 
I have heard about towns now in Ala-
bama that I had never heard about. I 
have also heard things he would tell me 
about that would make me think of 
towns in Vermont and make me realize 
we were talking about the same prob-
lems. Never once would he say: These 
are Republicans or these are Demo-
crats. He would say: These are people 
in Alabama who need help. So we 
would work on that. 
I will speak further about this, but, 
Senator JONES, I think of you and your 
wonderful family. I think of the trips 
you and your wife and my wife and I 
have taken together, and I feel that I 
have been a better Senator for knowing 
you and traveling with you and listen-
ing to you. I will miss you, my friend, 
and I will speak further on this. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The as-
sistant Democratic leader. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, there is 
something about this DOUG
JONES. 
From the earliest stages in his life, he 
knew he was going to be a little bit dif-
ferent. 
When I grew up in East St. Louis, IL, 
it was expected that my childhood hero 
would be St. Louis Cardinals great 
Stan ‘‘the Man’’ Musial. But when you 
grew up in Fairfield, AL—also a base-
ball fan as a boy—it turned out that 
your childhood heroes included Joe 
DiMaggio, Roger Maris, and Mickey 
Mantle. I am not sure how that goes 
over in the Deep South, to say that you 
are rooting for a team called the Yan-
kees. But you did it, and you knew 
from the start, in your youth, that you 
were willing to strike out and do the 
radical, controversial thing. 
You were 9 years old in September 
1963 when four members of the Ku Klux 
Klan bombed the 16th Street Baptist 
Church in nearby Birmingham, killing 
four innocent, young girls who were 
not much older than you were. Four-
teen years later, you were an idealistic, 
young law student who skipped class to 
sit in on the trial of the ringleader of 
that church bombing. You were mes-
merized when listening to Alabama’s 
then-attorney general—the lead pros-
ecutor in the case—tell the jury: ‘‘It is 
never too late for justice.’’ The jury 
agreed and convicted the bomber. 
You would go on to marry Louise, 
and God blessed you with three beau-
tiful children—two sons and a daugh-
ter. Yet the memories of those four lit-
tle girls who were killed in their 
church never left you. 
In his eulogy for the four fallen girls, 
Dr. Martin Luther King said that the 
girls ‘‘say to each of us, Black and 
White alike, that we must substitute 
courage for caution. They say to us 
that we must be concerned not merely 
about who murdered them but about 
the system, the way of life, and the 
philosophy which produced the mur-
derers. Their deaths say to us that we 
must 
work 
passionately 
and 
unrelentingly for the realization of the 
American dream.’’ 
I am sure a lot of people heard those 
words and nodded, but you heard those 
words, and you were inspired. In 2001, 
as the U.S. attorney for the Northern 
District of Alabama, you led the suc-
cessful effort to try and convict the re-
maining two coconspirators in the 
church bombing. Both men were sen-
tenced to life in prison. 
In that same office, you coordinated 
a joint State-Federal task force that 
led to the indictment of domestic ter-
rorist Eric Rudolph. You advocated 
that Rudolph should stand trial first in 
Birmingham for the deadly bombing in 
that city of a women’s health center 
before being tried in Atlanta for the 
Centennial Olympic Park bombing. All 
told, these and other bombings killed 2 
people and injured more than 150. Ru-
dolph pleaded guilty and was sentenced 
to four life terms in prison because of 
your commitment. 
I was honored, during the course of 
the campaign, DOUG, to do a joint fund-
raiser with you and Louise and Loret-
ta, my wife. I got to sit out on my deck 
in Springfield and listen to Jason Isbell 
and Joe Walsh. It was a lot of fun that 
night. Sometimes campaigns are fun. It 
certainly was to be with you and Lou-
ise on that particular night. 
I want to close by saying that you 
shocked me on the floor of the Senate 
with your first speech. I couldn’t be-
lieve that this new Senator from the 
State of Alabama would give a speech 
about guns and gun violence. It really 
told me all I needed to know about you 
right then and there. You are willing 
to stick out your neck for something 
you believe in, even if it is going to be 
controversial and even if you are going 
to catch hell for it, because you believe 
in it sincerely. 
I know you are a proud hunter and 
gun owner, and there is no question in 
my mind about your views on that 
issue. Yet, after the Pulse nightclub 
shooting in Orlando, FL, that took the 
lives of 49 young men and women—one 
of the worst mass shootings in the Na-
tion’s history—you supported tighter 
background checks for gun sales and 
raising the age requirement to pur-
chase a semiautomatic weapon. 
I want to personally thank you, as 
well, for showing exceptional political 
courage in cosponsoring my DACA leg-
islation in the Dream Act. I will never 
forget it. 
I am also proud that you were an 
original cosponsor of Justice in Polic-
ing. That wasn’t an easy one either for 
anybody and for you especially, but 
you stood up for what you believed in. 
That is legislation that I joined in in-
troducing with our friend CORY BOOKER 
and soon-to-be Vice President KAMALA 
HARRIS. 
So you have left your mark. It may 
seem like a short time in the Senate, 
but there are those who have served for 
much longer who have a lot less to 
show for it. You told us who you were 
on your first day, and you proved it 
every day thereafter. It has been an 
honor to count you as a colleague. I 
know that you are going to continue to 
find ways to bend that moral arc of the 
universe toward justice, and I look for-
ward to supporting you in every way 
that I can in that goal. I wish you the 
best. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CORONAVIRUS RELIEF 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
I came to the Senate 2 years ago be-
cause the people of Florida entrusted 
me to fight against the broken ways of 
Washington 
and 
the 
out-of-control 
spending that is threatening the future 
of our children and our grandchildren. 
I am fighting every day against the 
political 
class 
in 
Washington—the 
same elites that scoff when people like 
me say that government needs to be 
run like a business. They say govern-
ment is too complicated to run like a 
business, but I say that any elected of-
ficial or government bureaucrat who 
believes that should resign tomorrow 
because they are part of the problem. 
It is time to wake up. It is time to 
wake up to the fact that every dime 
spent in Washington belongs to Amer-
ican taxpayers, and every dollar spent 
now is a tax increase for a future gen-
eration. 
It is time to wake up to the fact that 
our Nation is more than $27 trillion in 
debt. Every cent we spend moving for-
ward threatens our ability to fund our 
military and our safety nets like Social 
Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. 
It is time to wake up to the fact that 
our position as the leader of the free 
world is not promised and shouldn’t be 
taken for granted. Irresponsible career 
politicians who care more about their 
next election than the future of our 
country will run this Nation into the 
ground if we let them, and I am fight-
ing like hell to make sure they don’t. 
Now, let me be clear. I support an-
other relief measure to help our small 
businesses and individuals who are 
hurting because of the coronavirus. 
For 
months, 
Senate 
Republicans 
have been trying to pass responsible 
and targeted measures to quickly help 
those in need. And for months, Demo-
crats have blocked these measures be-
cause of politics. 
NANCY PELOSI admitted it. She said 
she purposely stood in the way of the 
deal until after the Presidential elec-
tion so that politics would be in their 
favor to avoid ‘‘considerations in the 
legislation that we don’t want.’’ 
It is shameful and exactly why the 
American people are fed up with Wash-
ington.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7308 
December 9, 2020 
Congress has already allocated $2 
trillion in direct and indirect aid to 
States and localities. And we know, un-
fortunately, because Congress tried to 
get this money out the door as quickly 
as possible, many programs within the 
CARES Act are riddled with waste, in-
efficiency, and fraud. 
Now a group of my colleagues want 
to spend another trillion dollars, in-
cluding almost $200 billion to bail out 
liberal States with Governors who 
can’t do the basic job they were elected 
to do—manage their own budgets. And 
we don’t even know how much is still 
unspent from the previous coronavirus 
relief packages. 
I have reached out to every single 
Governor—twice now—to learn exactly 
how they have spent the hundreds of 
billions of dollars they have already re-
ceived, and only 10 have replied. They 
won’t tell us because they don’t want 
us to know there are still billions of 
dollars left unspent. They don’t want 
us to know that the real purpose is to 
take taxpayer money meant to help get 
through this crisis and use it to back-
fill their inefficient and wasteful budg-
ets and pension programs. 
Liberal 
Governors 
and 
mayors 
around the country think the Amer-
ican people are stupid. They think tax-
payers in States like Florida won’t re-
alize if the Federal Government uses 
their taxpayer money to bail out 
States like New York and California 
and pay for those States’ wasteful 
spending. 
Governor Newsom has had his hand 
out for a bailout despite the fact that 
California’s tax revenues for this fiscal 
year are running $9.9 billion or 18.6 per-
cent above projections. Personal in-
come tax revenue in October was $1 bil-
lion—15.6 percent higher than in the 
previous October in California, and 
sales taxes were up 9.2 percent. For the 
last 4 months, overall revenue in Cali-
fornia has exceeded spring forecasts 
and even 2019 collections. 
This is a State that paid $1.5 million 
to the chief investment officer of its 
public pension fund, who was actively 
investing in companies tied to the Chi-
nese Communist Party, only to later 
find out this person was personally in-
vested in companies with ties to the 
Chinese Communist Party. You can’t 
make this stuff up. How is that for pen-
sion waste and a national security 
threat? 
It is the same story with Governor 
Cuomo. New York’s overall tax revenue 
was up 4.3 percent in September com-
pared to September 2019. 
These are the same Governors who 
are OK issuing new stay-at-home or-
ders that are killing small businesses. 
As long as they get more money from 
the Federal Government to backfill 
their budgets and pension plans, they 
don’t care how many people in their 
States have to suffer. These Governors 
and mayors don’t care, as long as they 
don’t have to follow their own oppres-
sive rules. 
Let’s not forget about NANCY PELOSI 
and the hair salon, California Governor 
Gavin Newsom dining at the French 
Laundry, Austin Mayor Steve Adler en-
couraging constituents to stay home 
from his timeshare in Mexico. 
Do as I say, not as I do. 
These liberal politicians who refuse 
to open their States or spend taxpayer 
money wisely are seeing high numbers 
of unemployment. Most of the States 
with the highest unemployment rate in 
the country are controlled by Demo-
crats. 
On the other hand, Republican-led 
States that are making the hard 
choices to get on a fiscally responsible 
path and reopen their economy safely 
are succeeding and seeing lower unem-
ployment rates. 
Thirty States have halved their un-
employment rate since May, while real 
GDP grew 33 percent in the third quar-
ter, erasing losses from the previous 
quarter. You can see there, this is from 
a Wall Street Journal editorial—if you 
haven’t heard, ‘‘states are experiencing 
a surge of—tax revenue.’’ Politicians 
don’t want this good news to get out 
because they want to get more of our 
money from States like Florida to pay 
for the budgets of Illinois, New York, 
California, and New Jersey. You can 
see the GDP growth of 33 percent in 
that quarter. 
Over here you can see States have 
seen a big drop-off in their unemploy-
ment rates by half over the last 6 
months, and there has been a big 
growth in private sector employment, 
but it doesn’t stop these liberal Gov-
ernors and mayors from wanting more 
money. 
Look, I know everyone wants to help 
our States, and so do I. We help our 
States by ensuring appropriate spend-
ing of the billions of dollars in tax-
payer dollars already allocated. We 
help our States by safely opening the 
economy and getting Americans back 
to work. We help our States by sending 
money to schools to safely reopen and 
funding vaccine research and distribu-
tion. 
Most States will be in a strong posi-
tion to get through this pandemic 
without more Federal aid, and that is 
great news for our country. But we 
know New York, California, Illinois, 
New Jersey don’t need bailouts; they 
want bailouts so they can use that 
money intended to address the fallout 
from COVID to backfill their long-
standing budget problems and their 
pension problems. 
I have said all along that I will not 
support that. It is not fair to the citi-
zens of States like Florida, where over 
my 8 years as Governor, we made the 
hard choices—they were hard—that put 
our State on a fiscally secure path. We 
paid down our State debt. We cut 
taxes. We balanced our budget every 
year without borrowing money. 
And 
$908 
billion—$908 
billion—of 
spending today equals a tax increase of 
$7,000 per American family down the 
road. It is not money that we have. It 
is a tax increase of $7,000 per American 
family down the line. 
Many families in our country right 
now are trying to figure out how to cel-
ebrate this holiday season while they 
struggle to afford daily expenses. These 
are people we need to be helping. 
You wouldn’t run your business or 
family the way Washington is run— 
like there is an endless supply and no 
consequences to racking up unthink-
able amounts of debt. That is what 
many of my colleagues want. But to 
keep spending money like this means 
taking away the same opportunities 
that I have had and others have had to 
live the American dream, and it will 
take it away from our children and our 
grandchildren. 
It is time to wake up. It is time to 
make the hard choices to put our Na-
tion on a path to recovery—recovery 
from this virus, from the economic dev-
astation it has brought with it, and 
from the fiscal calamity that decades 
of politicians have ignored. That in-
cludes refusing to bail out wasteful 
States for their decades of poor fiscal 
choices. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri. 
S.J. RES. 77 
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, later 
today, we will vote on whether to go 
forward with the arms sales that the 
administration notified the Congress of 
a few weeks ago. These would be arms 
sales to the United Arab Emirates, 
equipment sales. These sales clearly 
would continue the 20 years of growth 
in our relationship, working side by 
side against common concerns and 
common enemies. 
This really goes back through three 
different administrations, going back 
to 9/11 and beyond, where the UAE has 
consistently been willing to stand with 
us in at least six long-term deploy-
ments. They come; they stay. They are 
side by side with us in the field. They 
have been with us in the air. They are 
flying what has previously been our 
best piece of aircraft at a level that we 
would share it with other countries 
that are friends of ours. 
This sale will continue that. It con-
tinues to allow even more interoper-
ability between the United States and 
the UAE and Israel. 
Israel, by the way, is totally sup-
portive of this sale. The Ambassador 
from the United Arab Emirates and the 
Ambassador from Israel earlier this 
week had a public event where they 
both talked about the support of Israel 
for this sale. 
As you know very well, our law re-
quires a quantitative advantage for 
Israel when we sell them equipment. 
We have even a slightly different ad-
vantage, but being able to continue 
this relationship is important. 
The F–35 jets, the MQ–9 unarmed aer-
ial vehicles, advanced munitions—I 
think the total sale is about $23.5 bil-
lion. And this is not any kind of gift 
from the United States to the UAE. 
This is the UAE making a purchase to-
taling $23.5 billion for equipment that

is made by American companies and al-
most always by American workers. 
In August, we had the first break-
through in a diplomatic sense in the 
Middle East in a long time. President 
Trump deserves credit for that. Israel 
deserves credit for that. But the UAE 
deserves credit for that. The Abraham 
accords, where the UAE formally rec-
ognized Israel, began to have flights 
back and forth and other things that 
were significant in changing the envi-
ronment in the Middle East, the most 
difficult part of the world—the greatest 
breakthrough in 40 years. But that fol-
lowed a number of breakthroughs that 
weren’t quite as public, where this re-
lationship has grown—the Israel rela-
tionship with the UAE—just like our 
relationship has gotten stronger over 
time. 
To see the recognition of the two 
governments together, to see Bahrain 
follow that—I think we are going to see 
other countries in the area decide that 
a region that lives in peace with Israel 
is a good thing for everybody involved, 
not a bad thing for anybody. So it is 
important. 
I think how the Congress deals with 
this is significant. We have been noti-
fied as the law requires us to be noti-
fied. Under this notification process, I 
don’t believe any sale has been denied, 
and only one sale has been altered. 
The President has to agree. So if we 
debate this for hours and somehow it 
narrowly passes and the President ve-
toes it and we don’t have the votes to 
override the veto, which I am confident 
we would not have—in fact, I think we 
very likely have the votes to go ahead 
and deal with this right here, right 
now. It is the right thing to do. It is 
the right time to do it. We will never 
have more of a long-term runway of 
how things under the Bush administra-
tion, the Obama administration, and 
the Trump administration have contin-
ued to progress to where the UAE has 
become a trusted ally. 
Now, they have become a trusted ally 
and a trusted diplomatic partner in 
this important breakthrough. Having 
this kind of equipment not only allows 
us to be interoperable, but frankly, it 
creates the opportunities for American 
military and American technicians to 
be working with them every time you 
have an upgrade, every time you have 
a significant maintenance issue. That 
just further enhances, as does working 
through how that equipment is used 
afterwards—all of that further en-
hances the constant dialogue, the con-
stant reinforcement of our friends who 
see common enemies and are working 
directly to move their country and 
their region in a much better direction. 
I hope that the Senate today does 
what it needs to do and sends that mes-
sage that we understand what Israel 
would like to see happen, what the 
UAE would like to see happen, and, 
frankly, what will happen and happens 
better if this debate focuses more on 
what that outcome produces, rather 
than a debate that makes people won-
der exactly what do you have to do to 
continue to be a trusted partner of the 
United States. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I would 
restate my request, whenever I come to 
the floor, that the Presiding Officer 
wear a mask because he has people sit-
ting in front of him that could be at 
risk. 
REMEMBERING PAUL SARBANES 
Mr. President, this weekend, we lost 
a former Member of this body who 
truly embodied the spirit of service 
that should animate all of our work. 
His name is Paul Sarbanes. He passed 
away a few days ago. He was a long-
time chair of the committee of the Pre-
siding Officer. 
As chair of the Banking and Housing 
Committee, he was always a voice for 
consumers 
and 
working 
families, 
standing up against powerful corporate 
interests. The accomplishment that 
bears his name, the Sarbanes-Oxley 
Act, was a landmark law in our efforts 
to hold corporations accountable. It 
helped protect Americans who invest 
hard-earned money for retirement and 
for their kids’ education from cor-
porate banking fraud, the kind that 
bankrupted families after scandals like 
Enron. 
Senator Sarbanes also never ignored 
the housing part of our committee’s ju-
risdiction. He fought to make sure that 
all Americans could find and afford a 
place to call home. Whenever devel-
opers tried to make a deal in Maryland, 
he was always adamant they include 
affordable housing in their projects be-
cause, fundamentally, he never forgot 
where he came from. The son of Greek 
immigrants, Paul Sarbanes grew up a 
working-class kid, bussing tables at his 
family’s restaurant on the Eastern 
Shore. 
In the Senate, he cared about getting 
results for the people he served, not 
about getting the credit. Some of his 
colleagues called him the ‘‘stealth sen-
ator.’’ He welcomed the nickname. He 
told the Baltimore Sun that stealth is 
‘‘one of the most important weapons in 
our military arsenal. . . . If you let 
somebody else take the credit, you can 
get the result.’’ 
Senator Sarbanes was the definition 
of a true public servant. May he rest in 
peace as he joins his beloved wife 
Christine. Connie and I pray for Rep-
resentative JOHN SARBANES, his son, 
and the entire Sarbanes family. 
I hope my colleagues will join me in 
honoring Senator Sarbanes by building 
on his legacy, standing up to the cor-
porations that have too much power in 
this country, and fighting for the 
working people we serve. Paul Sar-
banes, like many others in this body, 
understood the dignity of work. 
NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT 
Mr. President, yesterday the House 
overwhelmingly passed the NDAA con-
ference report by a veto-proof majority 
of 335 to 78. That bill includes our com-
prehensive bipartisan reform of our 
anti-money laundering laws. 
I would like to thank my colleagues, 
especially Senator CRAPO
and other 
Banking and Housing Committee col-
leagues: 
Senators 
WARNER, 
JONES, 
REED, ROUNDS, and off the committee, 
Senators WYDEN, WHITEHOUSE, GRA-
HAM, and GRASSLEY, and the Presiding 
Officer, Senator COTTON, for his work 
on this legislation. 
On 
the 
House 
side, 
Chairwoman 
WATERS and Chairman MALONEY and 
Representative CLEAVER, thank you to 
all of them for working so hard to en-
sure that today we have this crucial bi-
partisan legislation in this defense con-
ference report that will reform our 
money laundering laws and finally end 
abuses by anonymous shell companies. 
I would like to extend my thanks to 
a former colleague, Chairman LEVIN, 
who was chair of Armed Services and 
the Permanent Subcommittee on In-
vestigations and to President Obama, 
who both voted on these issues for 
years. Many of their good ideas are 
codified in this bill, harvesting some of 
the seeds they planted years ago. 
The Anti-Money Laundering Act and 
the Corporate Transparency Act are 
the products of months and months of 
bipartisan negotiations between and 
among Members of the House and Sen-
ate and certainly the staffs of Senator 
COTTON and me and Senator CRAPO and 
others. I thank them for their good 
work. 
The bill is a critical step to fight 
money laundering and crack down on 
shell companies. While there are things 
I would have done differently had we 
been writing the bill on our own, over-
all, it is an effective and comprehen-
sive response to the problem of illicit 
finance. I strongly support it. 
Criminals abuse the U.S. financial 
system to launder money from drug 
trafficking, organized crime, Medicare 
and Medicaid fraud, weapons sales, and 
other criminal activities. I spoke today 
about this with Sheriff Burke of To-
ledo, the Lucas County Sheriff, a long-
time sheriff, and U.S. Marshal Pete El-
liott of Cleveland of the Northern Dis-
trict. They welcomed this language, 
and they welcome this law. This will 
help them do their jobs better. 
Much of this dirty money that comes 
from organized crime in 
Medicaid 
fraud, weapons sales, drug trafficking, 
and 
sex 
trafficking 
is 
laundered 
through anonymous shell corporations. 
These are not victimless crimes. They 
directly hurt Ohio communities, espe-
cially those torn apart by the opioid 
crisis. 
Sinaloa cartel actors and Fentanyl 
traffickers have been destroying thou-
sands of families. They use money 
laundering to get their drug money in 
and out of the country. Human traf-
fickers who prey on runaways at truck 
stops along major interstate highways 
in Ohio and across the country also use 
the financial system to launder their 
profits. We need to give law enforce-
ment new modern tools to stop their 
crimes.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7310 
December 9, 2020 
The bill finally requires comprehen-
sive reporting by U.S. companies of 
their actual owners—no more hiding 
these abuses in anonymous shell com-
panies. It cracks down on bankers who 
look the other way to actively aid 
money laundering and cracks down on 
Big Banks that have shoddy compli-
ance systems. If you are helping drug 
traders hide their illegal fentanyl prof-
its, you deserve more than a slap on 
the wrist. Banks cannot be too big to 
jail, and laws can’t treat them that 
way. 
I will closely monitor how this crit-
ical legislation is being implemented. I 
spoke this week already with the Sec-
retary of Treasury designee and the 
Deputy Secretary of Treasury designee 
about being ready to administer and 
enforce these laws. I look forward to 
working with the administration to en-
sure that Treasury puts in place effec-
tive anti-money laundering and cor-
porate transparency rules to imple-
ment the bill as soon as possible. 
We know that criminals have long 
been revising their tactics to get 
around our current laws. This bill will 
enable us to get ahead of them and 
stay ahead of them. 
I urge my colleagues to support it. 
They supported this language in the 
NDAA, and I ask them to support the 
NDAA. 
Taken together, as we designed them, 
these measures reform, update and 
strengthen 
our 
current 
anti-money 
laundering laws and make critical 
changes to U.S. corporate disclosure 
laws to combat abuses by owners of 
anonymous shell companies—including 
foreign owners from China, Russia, 
Iran, North Korea and other coun-
tries—who have for years been exploit-
ing our system for criminal purposes. 
The 
legislation 
strengthens 
the 
Treasury Department’s financial intel-
ligence, anti-money laundering (AML), 
and countering the financing of ter-
rorism (CFT) programs, modernizing 
our legal regime and improving com-
munication, oversight, and informa-
tion-sharing in these areas. 
The conference agreement requires 
much more routine and systemic co-
ordination, communication, and feed-
back among financial institutions, reg-
ulators, and law enforcement, to enable 
them to identify and act on suspicious 
financial activities, better target bank 
resources on critical AML tasks, and 
increase the likelihood of bad actors 
being caught by law enforcement. 
It also provides for new whistle-
blower protections for those reporting 
BSA violations and provides for pay-
ment of whistleblower rewards. 
It establishes tough new penalties on 
those convicted of serious Bank Se-
crecy Act violations, including addi-
tional penalties for repeat violators, 
and imposes a ban on financial-institu-
tion board service for those convicted 
of egregious BSA-related crimes. 
It would require important new re-
porting from the Department of Jus-
tice and Treasury to better enable Con-
gress to oversee the use of—and some-
times continuing violations by banks 
under—deferred 
prosecution 
agree-
ments 
and 
non-prosecution 
agree-
ments, which too often are a slap on 
the wrist by regulators for banks that 
evade 
sanctions, 
violate 
our 
AML 
rules, or otherwise violate banking 
laws. As I have said, banks can’t be too 
big to jail, and regulators can’t treat 
them that way. 
To help accomplish all these goals, 
the conference agreement authorizes 
additional funding for the Treasury De-
partment, and we expect the Depart-
ment to insist on strong accountability 
for results and to be responsive to con-
gressional oversight as its officials 
work to implement this legislation. 
In addition, the bill finally requires 
comprehensive reporting by U.S. com-
panies of their actual owners. No more 
hiding in the dark abuses by anony-
mous 
shell 
companies 
to 
commit 
crimes. 
Unlike in most areas of reform and 
transparency, where the U.S. has led 
the way, on this issue of anonymous 
shell companies we have long lagged 
behind other nations, and failed to re-
quire uniform and clear ownership in-
formation for firms at the time of their 
incorporation in the states. 
This information is critical to law 
enforcement. In the U.S. investigators 
often have to spend precious time and 
resources issuing subpoenas and chas-
ing down leads—sometimes jumping 
from anonymous shell company to 
anonymous shell company—to secure 
basic information about who actually 
owns a company. That makes no sense. 
And with this bill, it will end. 
Treasury’s National Money Laun-
dering Risk Assessment estimates that 
around $300 billion in illicit proceeds 
from domestic financial crime is gen-
erated annually. 
Criminals have for a very long time 
abused our financial system to launder 
funds gained through narcotics traf-
ficking, organized crime, Medicare and 
Medicaid fraud, weapons proliferation 
and other criminal activities. Much of 
this dirty money is laundered through 
anonymous shell corporations. 
Over the years we have heard all 
about these abuses, from the ‘‘Panama 
Papers’’ to the ‘‘Paradise Papers’’ to, 
more recently this year, the series of 
news 
articles 
called 
the 
‘‘FinCEN 
files.’’ 
These exposures of abuses in our sys-
tem by dedicated journalists and na-
tional and international transparency 
organizations have highlighted prob-
lems involving human trafficking, drug 
trafficking, terrorism, money laun-
dering, fraud, tax evasion, and other 
crimes involving illicit finance. 
None of these abuses are victimless 
crimes. 
Money laundering for drug cartels 
has a direct line to the opioid crisis in 
Ohio, where Sinaloa cartel actors or 
fentanyl traffickers have been destroy-
ing thousands of families. Combined 
with the pandemic, these drugs have 
hurt thousands of Ohio families. 
Human traffickers who exploit the 
misery 
of 
runaways 
in 
truckstops 
along major interstate highways in 
Ohio and across the country use the fi-
nancial system to launder their profits. 
Medicare fraudsters cost the tax-
payers $2.6 billion in one recent year, 
according to the HHS Inspector Gen-
eral, and tarnish the reputation of this 
lifeline for seniors. 
That’s why anti-money laundering 
and corporate transparency laws are so 
critical: they protect the integrity of 
our financial system, provide critical 
intelligence to law enforcement to 
combat crime and help give victims the 
tools they need to hold bad actors ac-
countable. 
Under 
Treasury’s 
existing 
rules, 
banks are already working to secure 
some 
of 
this 
information 
from 
accountholders when they open ac-
counts. And while banks must continue 
to play a key monitoring role, it’s also 
important that we finally, after all 
these years, require companies to pro-
vide basic information on their owner-
ship when they’re formed. 
The bill contains a strong definition 
of ‘‘beneficial owner’’ which includes a 
two-part test covering individuals who, 
directly or indirectly, exercise substan-
tial control over an entity or hold or 
control an ownership interest in the 
entity. The definition is clear that a 
nominee, intermediary, custodian, or 
agent acting on behalf of another indi-
vidual cannot be the beneficial owner 
of an entity. Nominees are not bene-
ficial owners; neither are trustees or 
attorneys acting as agents. 
The definition is also clear that em-
ployees do not qualify as beneficial 
owners of an entity unless, apart from 
their employment status, they hold an 
ownership interest in the entity or can 
exercise substantial control over the 
entity such as the ability to transfer 
some or all of the entity’s assets or 
earnings to their personal use. The pro-
vision defines ‘‘beneficial owner’’ as an 
individual who directly or indirectly 
‘‘owns or controls not less than 25 per-
cent of the ownership interests of the 
entity.’’ When applying this part of the 
test, FinCEN must consider what to do 
if no one individual meets the 25 per-
cent minimum, and how that situation 
may trigger the second part of the ben-
eficial owner test which requires dis-
closure of the individuals who exercise 
‘‘substantial control over the entity.’’ 
To determine whether an individual 
exercises ‘‘substantial control’’ over an 
entity, FinCEN is not intended to de-
vise a numerical, narrow, or rigid test. 
Instead, the standard is intended to 
function with flexibility to take into 
account the myriad ways that an indi-
vidual may exercise control over an en-
tity while holding minimal or even no 
formal ownership interest. 
They include written and unwritten 
agreements, arrangements, or under-
standings, instructions to company di-
rectors or officers, letter of wishes,

control over personnel decisions, eco-
nomic pressure on company share-
holders or employees, coercion, brib-
ery, threats of bodily harm, and other 
legal and illegal means of exercising 
control. 
Evidence that one or more individ-
uals are exercising substantial control 
over a specific entity is expected to 
vary widely and may encompass such 
matters as emailed or telephoned in-
structions from the individuals sus-
pected of being beneficial owners or 
their agents, employment or personnel 
decisions made at the direction or with 
the approval of such individuals, finan-
cial accounts that name such individ-
uals as signatories, investment deci-
sions made at the direction or rec-
ommendation of such individuals, or 
transfers of funds or assets to or at the 
direction of such individuals. 
Requiring companies to provide their 
ownership information and storing it 
in a secure federal database like 
FinCEN’s, alongside account holders’ 
banking information, will help address 
longstanding problems for U.S. law en-
forcement. 
It will help them investigate and 
prosecute cases involving terrorism, 
weapons 
proliferation, 
drug 
traf-
ficking, money laundering, Medicare 
and Medicaid fraud, human trafficking, 
and other crimes. And it will provide 
ready access to this information under 
long-established and effective privacy 
rules. 
Without these reforms, criminals, 
terrorists and even rogue nations could 
continue to use layer upon layer of 
shell companies to disguise and launder 
illicit funds. That makes it harder to 
hold bad actors accountable, and puts 
us all at risk. 
The bill also contains certain exemp-
tions. The basic justification behind 
the bill’s exemptions is that each ex-
empt category refers to entities that 
already disclose their beneficial owners 
to the government in one way or an-
other and so don’t need to duplicate 
that disclosure in the FinCEN data-
base. 
For example, publicly traded compa-
nies already disclose their true owners 
to the SEC, and banks already disclose 
their true owners to federal bank regu-
lators; there is no reason to require 
those entities to disclose the same in-
formation to FinCEN. Each of the ex-
emptions should be interpreted as nar-
rowly as possible to exclude entities 
that do not disclose their beneficial 
owners to the government. 
Exemptions created for pooled in-
vestment vehicles, dormant companies, 
and certain nonprofits require espe-
cially narrow interpretations to limit 
those exemptions to entities that pro-
vide some level of ownership disclosure 
to the government. 
The exemption for pooled investment 
vehicles is intended to be available 
only to PIVs that rely for investment 
advice and services on a regulated bank 
or on a securities broker-dealer, invest-
ment company, or investment adviser 
that is registered with the SEC, has 
disclosed its own beneficial ownership 
information to the federal government, 
and has filed a Form ADV disclosing 
the PIV’s legal name and any other in-
formation related to the PIV that the 
federal government may require. 
In addition, PIVs formed under the 
laws of a foreign jurisdiction must file 
with FinCEN a certification identi-
fying every individual that exercises 
substantial control over the PIV, pro-
viding the same information required 
for beneficial owners. 
Because evidence shows that crimi-
nals, fraudsters, and U.S. adversaries 
are increasingly using PIVs to launder 
funds and commit other wrongdoing, 
this exemption is of special concern 
and should be subject to continuous, 
careful review by Treasury as provided 
in the new 31 U.S.C. 5336(i) to see 
whether it should be retained or re-
moved. 
The exemption for dormant compa-
nies is intended to function solely as a 
grandfathering provision that exempts 
from disclosure only those dormant 
companies in existence prior to the 
bill’s enactment; those grandfathered 
entities are also required to imme-
diately disclose their beneficial owners 
to FinCEN as soon as their ownership 
changes hands, they become active en-
tities, or they otherwise lose their ex-
empt status. No entity created after 
the date of enactment of the bill is in-
tended to qualify for exemption as a 
dormant company. 
The exemption provided to certain 
charitable and nonprofit entities also 
merits narrow construction and careful 
review in light of past evidence of 
wrongdoers misusing charities, founda-
tions, and other nonprofit entities to 
launder funds and advance criminal 
and civil misconduct. This exemption 
is intended to apply only to entities 
that are engaged in charitable or non-
profit activities, and not to entities en-
gaged in for-profit businesses or for- 
profit activities. 
The exemption is based, in part, upon 
provisions in U.S. and state laws that 
enable federal and state officials to 
regulate and investigate nonprofit or-
ganizations to ensure, for example, 
that the individuals behind them are 
not using the entity’s assets to inap-
propriately enrich themselves, unfairly 
compete against businesses that pay 
taxes, or advance other inappropriate 
objectives. 
In addition, the exemption given to 
entities that ‘‘operate exclusively to 
provide financial assistance to or hold 
governance rights over’’ a charitable 
entity is intended to be even more re-
strictive; it is confined to entities that 
qualify as U.S. persons under U.S. tax 
law, have only U.S. citizens or resi-
dents as their beneficial owners, and 
derive ‘‘at least a majority’’ of their 
funds from U.S. persons—meaning the 
exemption is not available under any 
circumstance for entities formed under 
foreign laws, established for foreign 
beneficial owners, or funded primarily 
with foreign funds. 
Again, these exemptions are intended 
to be narrowly interpreted to prevent 
their use by entities that otherwise fail 
to disclose their beneficial owners to 
the federal government. 
To ensure the bill’s exemptions func-
tion 
as 
intended, 
the 
Treasury, 
FinCEN, OCC, IRS, SEC, CFTC, and 
other federal regulators should review 
and, if necessary, strengthen their fil-
ing forms to ensure that beneficial as 
well as nominal owners are disclosed to 
the federal government by the specified 
exempt entities, including investment 
companies, investment advisers, pooled 
investment vehicles, money transmit-
ting businesses, and all entities reg-
istered with the SEC, among others. 
The justification for the exemption 
of entities that have both physical op-
erations and at least 20 employees in 
the United States is that those enti-
ties’ physical U.S. presence will make 
it easy for U.S. law enforcement to dis-
cover those entities’ true owners. Like 
other exemptions in the bill, this ex-
emption should be narrowly construed 
to exclude entities that do not have an 
easily located physical presence in the 
United States, do not have multiple 
employees physically present on an on-
going basis in the United States, or use 
strategies that make it difficult for 
U.S. law enforcement to contact their 
workforce or discover the names of 
their beneficial owners. This exemp-
tion should be subject to continuous, 
careful review by Treasury under the 
new 31 U.S.C. 5336(i) to detect and pre-
vent its misuse. 
Extending the disclosure exemption 
to subsidiaries whose ownership inter-
ests are owned or controlled by one or 
more of certain identified exempt enti-
ties is, again, intended to be inter-
preted as narrowly as possible to ex-
clude subsidiaries that never disclose 
their true owners to the federal govern-
ment. 
The exemption is intended to apply 
only to subsidiaries that are wholly 
owned or controlled by one or more of 
the 
exempt 
categories 
of 
entities; 
that’s why the provision does not con-
tain any reference to the 25% owner-
ship figure that appears in the defini-
tion of beneficial owner. 
The Federal Reserve, Treasury, OCC, 
SEC, CFTC, FDIC, and other federal 
regulators should review their filing re-
quirements to ensure that the entities 
that report to them, such as banks, 
publicly traded corporations, securities 
dealers, exchange operators, or com-
modity brokers, include requirements 
to disclose the subsidiaries they wholly 
own or control. This exemption, like 
others, should be subject to contin-
uous, careful review by Treasury under 
the new 31 U.S.C. 5336(i) to detect and 
prevent its misuse. 
For their part, FinCEN identifiers 
are intended to simplify beneficial 
ownership disclosures by eliminating 
spelling and naming issues that can 
cause confusion or mistakes related to 
the precise individuals or entities in an 
ownership chain.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7312 
December 9, 2020 
FinCEN should design rules that will 
encourage both individuals and entities 
to obtain and use FinCEN identifiers in 
their beneficial ownership disclosures. 
When assigning FinCEN identifiers to 
entities, FinCEN should first ensure 
that the entity has already disclosed 
its beneficial ownership information to 
FinCEN. An entity that has not dis-
closed its beneficial ownership infor-
mation to FinCEN does not qualify and 
should not be granted a FinCEN identi-
fier. 
It is critical that, from the begin-
ning, FinCEN issue rules that ensure 
only one identifying number is as-
signed to each individual and to each 
entity, including all successors to a 
specific entity. FinCEN should also es-
tablish mechanisms to detect and cor-
rect any procedure or database field 
that may lead to the same individual 
or entity possessing or using more than 
one FinCEN identifier. 
Chairman CRAPO and I agreed two 
years ago that we must get this done in 
this Congress—we must finally enact 
sweeping legislation to require com-
plete ownership information—not of 
front men and women, not of those 
forming companies on behalf of those 
who will pull the strings from behind 
the curtain—but of the actual owners 
of companies to be available to appro-
priate law enforcement, intelligence 
and national security officials in our 
government who need it to combat 
crime. 
This bill lays out a system to do that 
simply, 
efficiently 
and 
effectively, 
without unduly burdening small busi-
nesses or others, and while providing 
extensive protections for the informa-
tion. In Europe, that information is in-
cluded in a public database. This ap-
proach is different, imposing some lim-
its on who will have access, and under 
what circumstances. 
For example, it provides that federal 
agency heads or their designees—and 
agencies can extend that delegation as 
far down in their organizational chain 
as they like—can provide access to the 
database to appropriate law enforce-
ment authorities once per investiga-
tion, so they do not need to keep re-
peating that authorization for the 
same investigation. And those delega-
tions can be made on a bulk basis, so 
groups or classes of employees can be 
authorized to access the data as need-
ed. 
For State, local or tribal law enforce-
ment, they must get approval by a 
tribal, local, or state court of com-
petent jurisdiction, which need not be 
a judge—it can include an officer of the 
court like a magistrate, court clerk or 
other administrative officer. 
While I saw no reason to treat fed-
eral, state and local law enforcement 
officials differently, my Republican 
colleagues insisted on this differential 
treatment, and I am hopeful that the 
flexibility we have built in should 
make it workable. 
It is far more workable than the 
scheme some had pushed, to require ap-
proval by a federal judge each time law 
enforcement wanted to access the data-
base—an approach which would have 
gutted the bill, tied up our federal 
courts, and effectively rendered it inac-
cessible to state and local law enforce-
ment. But the key here is a robust, 
functional and effective database at 
FinCEN to house this information and 
make it readily available. 
FinCEN should take immediate steps 
to create the new database needed to 
contain beneficial ownership informa-
tion. It should use state of the art 
technology, procedures, and safeguards 
to ensure the database is secure, easy 
to search, easy to audit, and easy to 
correct and update. FinCEN should use 
its new hiring authority to hire the in-
formation technology specialists need-
ed to create the new beneficial owner-
ship database. In designing the data-
base, FinCEN should survey other ben-
eficial ownership databases to deter-
mine their best features and design, 
and create a structure that secures the 
data as required by law. FinCEN should 
ensure that federal, state, local, and 
tribal law enforcement can access the 
beneficial ownership database without 
excessive delays or red tape in a man-
ner modeled after its existing systems 
providing law enforcement access to 
databases containing currency trans-
action and suspicious activity report 
information. 
FinCEN should allow federal, state, 
local, and tribal law enforcement to ac-
cess the beneficial ownership data for 
both criminal and civil purposes, in-
cluding law enforcement activities de-
signed to combat terrorism, money 
laundering, 
trafficking, 
corruption, 
evasion of sanctions, noncompliance 
with tax law, fraud, counterfeit goods, 
market manipulation, insider trading, 
consumer abuse, cybercrime, election 
interference, and other types of crimi-
nal and civil wrongdoing. 
FinCEN should also provide appro-
priate access to beneficial ownership 
data for foreign law enforcement re-
questing the information for criminal 
or civil purposes, including appropriate 
requests made by a prosecutor, judge, 
foreign central authority, or com-
petent authority in a foreign jurisdic-
tion, keeping in mind that U.S. law en-
forcement will be seeking similar in-
formation from those same foreign law 
enforcement agencies on a reciprocal 
basis. FinCEN should endeavor to de-
sign a system that will provide appro-
priate beneficial ownership informa-
tion to foreign law enforcement with-
out excessive delays or red tape. 
As part of its implementation effort, 
FinCEN should take immediate steps 
to work with states and Indian Tribes 
to determine how to confirm that all 
covered entities formed or adminis-
tered by those states or tribes actually 
file and update the beneficial owner-
ship information required by law. 
We expect FinCEN to include any re-
sulting procedures or audits in the rule 
implementing the law. FinCEN should 
also include appropriate provisions in 
the implementing rule requiring fed-
eral, state, and tribal agencies to co-
operate with its efforts to ensure an ac-
curate, complete, and highly useful 
database of beneficial information and 
to provide notice of the law’s beneficial 
ownership transparency obligations, as 
required by the new law. 
The Treasury IG should take imme-
diate steps to establish a process to ac-
cept, store, and analyze information 
provided by a federal, state, local or 
tribal agency, foreign government, fi-
nancial institution, reporting com-
pany, civil society group, the public, or 
others in the form of comments or 
complaints related to how FinCEN pro-
vides notification of the law’s bene-
ficial ownership transparency require-
ments, how FinCEN collects and stores 
beneficial ownership information, or 
regarding the accuracy, completeness, 
or timeliness of the information in the 
FinCEN beneficial ownership database. 
As part of that process, the Treasury 
IG should establish procedures that 
will enable comments or complaints 
identifying false, out-of-date, or incom-
plete beneficial ownership information 
in the database or providing correct, 
up-to-date, or complete beneficial own-
ership information in the database 
promptly to reach the FinCEN per-
sonnel charged with ensuring the data-
base’s 
accuracy, 
completeness, 
and 
timeliness. In addition, the Treasury 
IG should establish a procedure to con-
duct periodic audits to determine the 
extent to which such information actu-
ally reached the proper FinCEN per-
sonnel, was logged, stored, and ana-
lyzed, led to changes in the database, 
and actually improved the accuracy, 
completeness, and timeliness of the 
beneficial ownership database. 
In response to the bill, the Adminis-
trator for Federal Procurement Policy 
should take immediate steps to revise 
the Federal Acquisition Regulation to 
require covered federal contractors and 
subcontractors, at an early stage in the 
federal procurement process, to dis-
close to the federal government in 
writing, and to update over time, infor-
mation on their beneficial owners. 
To carry out this provision in the 
law, the Administrator should work 
with the General Services Administra-
tion to add a beneficial ownership dis-
closure requirement to the database 
authorizing entities to bid on federal 
contracts. 
At the same time it is developing 
regulations to implement the new law, 
FinCEN should simultaneously revise 
the existing customer due diligence 
rule to bring it into harmony with the 
new law and all proposed regulations. 
In doing so, FinCEN should carefully 
evaluate the existing customer due 
diligence rule and preserve provisions 
that do not conflict with the new law. 
Among other changes, the revised cus-
tomer due diligence rule must use the 
new definition of beneficial owner es-
tablished in the law. Treasury and

FinCEN should create a transition pe-
riod for financial institutions to imple-
ment the new beneficial ownership re-
quirements. Lastly, FinCEN should 
also take steps to establish procedures 
as needed to administer the revised 
customer due diligence rule effectively. 
Updating and strengthening our AML 
and beneficial ownership laws will give 
us a 21st century system to combat 
these crimes. I guarantee you crimi-
nals have long been revising, adjusting 
and amending their tactics to cir-
cumvent our current laws. We must get 
ahead of them, and stay ahead of them. 
This bill will enable us to do that. 
I urge my colleagues to support the 
conference report and this important 
measure. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kentucky. 
f 
MOTION TO DISCHARGE—S.J. RES. 
78 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I rise 
today to oppose another massive infu-
sion of arms into the volatile Middle 
East. 
Someone must ask the question: Can 
a lasting peace be purchased with more 
weapons? Will selling sophisticated 
fighter jets and weaponized drones 
bring more stability to the Middle 
East? Is it wise to pour fuel on the fire 
that burns in the Middle East? 
The Senate today is debating with 
these joint resolutions whether to dis-
approve of the announced sale of 50 F– 
35s and 18 Reaper Drones to the United 
Arab Emirates, a country that has re-
cently taken encouraging steps specifi-
cally toward Israel, but with an overall 
record that should give concern. 
The primary questions we should be 
asking ourselves are: To what ends has 
the UAE deployed its military and its 
military technology in recent years? 
Does the UAE have a record that we 
can trust? What military behavior are 
we encouraging and rewarding with 
this sale? Will the U.S. bear responsi-
bility if the UAE misuses these incred-
ibly sophisticated weapons? 
The answers to these questions are 
far from clear. In fact, the UAE’s 
record should give us pause. The UAE 
is not a democracy. Their human 
rights record is mixed, and their mili-
tary activities in the region, as a one- 
time member of the Saudi coalition, 
contributed to the bloodshed and dev-
astation in Yemen. 
On human rights, let’s look at some 
recent reported examples. In 2017, 
Ahmed Monsoor, a human rights activ-
ist, was given a 10-year prison sentence 
based on his speech. Specifically, he 
was charged for posting ‘‘false informa-
tion that harms national unity’’ on so-
cial media. The charges against him 
were based on a call for the release of 
another activist who had been put in 
prison for political speech. Is this the 
kind of democracy or lack of democ-
racy and lack of speech that should be 
rewarded with our most sophisticated 
weaponry? 
In 2017, the UAE government also 
handed down a 10-year sentence to Nas-
ser bin-Ghaith, an economist, for his 
criticism of the UAE and Egyptian 
Governments. Is this the kind of coun-
try that deserves our most sophisti-
cated weaponry? 
In 2018, the UAE arrested Matthew 
Hedges, a British citizen and doctoral 
student, and denied him access to legal 
counsel for 5 months. They sentenced 
him to life in prison for spying charges 
based on a confession that was ob-
tained in an undisclosed location. They 
were ultimately forced to pardon him 
after international outrage. Is this the 
kind of country that we can trust with 
our most sophisticated weaponry? 
The fact that the UAE is willing to 
buy this technology is not in and of 
itself justification for the sale. This is 
the time to carefully study the situa-
tion in the region and to consider the 
effects of accelerating the Middle East-
ern arms race in the short-term and in 
the long-term. 
This 
is 
why 
our 
government 
shouldn’t be rushing into approving 
this sale; yet our government is mov-
ing at warp speed to approve this sale. 
It is as if we intentionally don’t want 
to consider all of these issues. 
The most frequently cited argument 
in favor of this sale is that the UAE 
has taken encouraging steps in the last 
few months. They have normalized re-
lations with Israel, facilitated civilian 
travel, and more. Great. I am all-in for 
that. 
We should be encouraging peaceful 
relations between countries. I support 
those efforts. But it is not clear that 
dropping advanced military technology 
into the region is, in fact, encouraging 
peaceful relations, given how these 
weapons have been used in recent 
times. 
The UAE spent years bombing Yemen 
as part of a coalition with Saudi Ara-
bia to stop the Houthis. This bombing 
campaign was undisciplined and slop-
py. Civilians, residents, and other non-
military targets were often destroyed. 
The U.N. reports approximately 7,000 
civilians killed in Yemen and over 
10,000 wounded. 
The Saudi-UAE coalition helped cre-
ate a humanitarian crisis in Yemen. 
Amid collapsing public services, the 
largest cholera epidemic on record has 
affected at least 2 million people— 
probably more—and killed almost 4,000. 
A lot of this is to be blamed on the 
civil war that had been perpetuated by 
Saudi Arabia and the UAE. 
At the height of the destruction, a 
Yemeni child would die of starvation 
every 10 minutes. More than 50,000 chil-
dren have been lost to starvation. 
I have argued for years that the 
United States should play no role in 
worsening the crisis via an arms pipe-
line to the coalition that perpetuates 
this war. American technology helped 
facilitate this crisis and should be a 
real concern about sending more Amer-
ican bombs and fighter planes into this 
region. 
If they weren’t used wisely in the 
most recent years in the Yemeni war, 
will they be used differently in the fu-
ture? Can we trust the people who were 
part of a bombing campaign of civil-
ians in Yemen to do an act more wisely 
with weapons in the future? 
Let’s also not forget that a media in-
vestigation found that weapons that we 
sent to the coalition—U.S. weapons 
that were sent to the Saudi-UAE coali-
tion—were lost, and, in some cases, 
handed over to terrorists. That is right. 
Military equipment from the United 
States was sent to the UAE, but it 
wound up in the hands of terrorists. 
The Saudi-UAE coalition reportedly 
used U.S. weapons as currency to win 
the approval of militias inside Yemen. 
To be clear, these activities are 
against the terms of sale. We told 
them: You can’t give away our weap-
ons. You can’t use our weapons to pur-
chase the support of Sunni extremists 
in Yemen. But they did. This should 
give us cause for concern. This should 
make us say: Whoa. Let’s stop, and 
let’s pause before we send more weap-
ons into this war. 
Not only that, but Iranian proxies 
captured some of these weapons, and, 
predictably, pointed them back at the 
Saudi-UAE coalition. Guns, missiles, 
and vehicles ended up in the hands of 
terrorists—weapons that we put on the 
ground in the Middle East. 
The same investigation found Mine 
Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicles, 
MRAPs, in the hands of Sunni allies of 
the UAE and Saudi Arabia. But guess 
who some of these Sunni allies were. 
Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula. We 
are talking about the remnants of al- 
Qaida in Yemen were getting weapons 
that we were giving to the UAE in 
Saudi Arabia. Does this sound like the 
kind of behavior we should reward with 
more weapons? 
One of the MRAPs still had the ex-
port label on it indicating that it had 
been sent from Beaumont, TX, to the 
UAE before ultimately getting ille-
gally 
transferred 
to 
extremists 
in 
Yemen. Is this the kind of behavior we 
should reward with more of our sophis-
ticated technology? 
The serial number on another MRAP 
in the possession of the Iranian-backed 
Houthis was traced back to the 2014 
sale of U.S. MRAPs to the UAE. So the 
UAE not only was trading our weapons 
for support among Sunni extremists, 
including al-Qaida-affiliated extremists 
in Yemen, but they also were having 
their equipment taken by the Houthis. 
So on both sides of the war in Yemen, 
we had U.S. weapons. Is it a good idea 
to flood the Middle East with more of 
our weapons? Is it a good idea to keep 
sending weapons that wind up in the 
hands of people who don’t have our 
best interests at heart? 
Now, people say: Well, the UAE is 
doing better. They have stepped back 
from the coalition. They are not, you 
know, fighting as vigorously in the 
UAE. But there still are reports that 
UAE is still involved in the civil war in 
Yemen and that they are still engaged.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7314 
December 9, 2020 
The UAE has a very conflicted record 
on human rights. I mentioned a few of 
those who have been in prison for 10 
years to life for speech—for speech 
against the government or even just 
speech the government doesn’t like. 
But flogging is also used as a form of 
punishment. There is no true freedom 
of speech or press in the UAE. Is this 
the kind of country we should give our 
most sophisticated technology to? 
Activists have been held in secret de-
tention centers in the UAE. Electric 
shocks have been used as a form of 
punishment in the UAE. Social media 
statements against the government are 
criminalized. You can be put in prison 
for text messages, and people have been 
put in prison and/or deported for text 
messages. 
The government has used mass trials 
against dissidents. Statements of sup-
port for Qatar were made illegal during 
the region’s diplomatic standoff. Criti-
cisms of government officials were 
made illegal by decree. This is not an 
open society; this is not a democracy; 
and this is decidedly not a country 
that we should be giving our most so-
phisticated weaponry to. 
Do we believe these arms sales will 
encourage or discourage bad behavior 
from the UAE? We are clearly commu-
nicating to the UAE that human rights 
take a backseat to arms sales. 
Part of the consideration for these 
arms sales is the recent developments 
from the UAE—most prominently, the 
UAE’s 
normalizing 
relations 
with 
Israel through the Abraham accords. It 
is a positive development, without a 
doubt. I am all in favor of it. I am all 
in favor of trading with the UAE. I am 
all in favor of Israel trading with the 
UAE. I am all in favor of good diplo-
matic relations, but you can also have 
diplomatic relations without flooding 
the region with our most sophisticated 
armaments. 
Outwardly, we are told by all in-
volved that the F–35s are not a condi-
tion for the Abraham accords, but if 
you ask whether it is a good idea to 
send some of our most advanced weap-
onry to the UAE, we are nonetheless 
told, if we don’t, it might jeopardize 
the accords. Well, which is it? They are 
either part of the accords or they are 
not. 
I, frankly, think, if the weapons were 
not to go, that the advantages to 
Israel-UAE having diplomatic relations 
in trade are so great that they will 
continue. The assurance right now is 
that we will guarantee what is called 
Israel’s qualitative military edge in 
the region, even after the sale of F–35s 
and Reaper drones to the UAE. So the 
message to Israel is: Yes, we are giving 
the same advanced fighter jets to the 
UAE, but we will give you even better 
jets in the future. 
All I can say is, that is a big maybe. 
And people who accept, on the face of 
that, that, oh, yes, we are going to 
guarantee something, but we are giving 
this same equipment to people who 
have been on the other side of virtually 
every other war in the Middle East, I 
think, is a hopeful promise but not nec-
essarily a guarantee. 
The easiest way, if you favor pro-
tecting Israel’s QME, or military edge, 
is to stop sending military assets to 
other countries in the region. We are 
competing with ourselves right now. 
We give advanced weaponry to Israel, 
and then we say we are going to keep 
your advantage. But then we give the 
advanced weaponry to the UAE, and so 
Israel comes back and says we need 
more. Then we give more to them, and 
the Saudis want more. And then once 
we give the weapons to the Saudis, 
Israel wants more. It is a never-ending 
arms race between the so-called coun-
tries that are actually getting along, 
not to mention the arms race between 
those who are opposed to Iran in the 
region. 
The easiest way to protect the quali-
tative military edge of Israel is to quit 
sending more advanced weaponry into 
the region. We have committed to pro-
tecting Israel’s QME in response to 
these sales, but we continue to obligate 
ourselves to increasingly large sales to 
offset the large sales we have already 
approved to others, like the UAE and 
Saudi Arabia. 
There is another aspect to the quali-
tative military edge that is rarely dis-
cussed. It is the QME that Saudi Ara-
bia and the Gulf sheikdoms have over 
Iran. Saudi Arabia is the third biggest 
purchaser of weapons and the third big-
gest spender on military of anyone in 
the world now, but if you add Saudi 
Arabia’s weapons to the Gulf sheik-
doms’ weaponry, you find that they 
spend eight times more on their mili-
tary than Iran. So what kind of re-
sponse would we imagine? 
We may not like what Iran does, but 
we should at least think about what 
they will do in response to what we do, 
and what in response to what the 
Saudis do and the UAE does and Israel 
does. Exacerbating the QME inevitably 
leads to pressure on Iran to further es-
calate the arms race and becomes a 
never-ending destructive cycle of more 
and more weapons. 
People say—and this administration 
has said—we want an agreement with 
Iran but not just a nuclear agreement. 
So we got out of the nuclear agree-
ment. We want an agreement on con-
ventional weapons. But how will that 
work? We asked Iran to limit their 
weapons, but we keep piling weapons 
on the other side? Do you think Iran is 
going to agree to limit their weapons if 
we keep piling more of our sophisti-
cated weapons into the hands of the 
Saudis and into the hands of the UAE 
and others? 
There is great concerns with this 
sale, and rushing it through is a mis-
take. What happens if the F–35s are 
shot down? What if Russia or China is 
able to access our sensitive stealth 
technology? How will the need for con-
tractors be handled in a secure fashion? 
Some supporters of Israel are very 
worried about this. The Zionist Organi-
zation of America, for example, has op-
posed the sale because it jeopardizes 
Israel’s qualitative military edge. It 
makes the technologies on which Israel 
relies less secure. 
This statement from the Zionist Or-
ganization of America is quite clear: 
‘‘The security of both the U.S. and 
Israel is best served by preventing any 
other countries from acquiring this ad-
vanced aircraft.’’ 
They couldn’t be clearer. Even many 
in Israel were initially, and very vo-
cally, opposed to this sale. Their Min-
ister of Defense, Benny Gantz, said ab-
solutely it was a terrible idea. Their 
Minister of Settlements, same thing. 
I would urge my colleagues to con-
sider the possible consequences of this 
sale. We should not accelerate an arms 
race in the Middle East; we should not 
jeopardize the security of our military 
technologies; and we should not reward 
a decade-plus of undesirable behavior 
by the UAE. I urge a vote in support of 
these resolutions of disapproval. 
Madam President, pursuant to the 
Arms Export Control Act of 1976, I 
move to discharge the Foreign Rela-
tions Committee from further consid-
eration of S.J. Res. 78, a joint resolu-
tion providing for congressional dis-
approval of the proposed military sale 
to the United Arab Emirates of certain 
defense articles and services. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
BLACKBURN). The motion is pending. 
Mr. PAUL. I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I 
rise today to urge my colleagues to 
support these two resolutions of dis-
approval. I appreciate my distinguished 
colleague from Kentucky and his sup-
port and advocacy here in these par-
ticular arms sales to the United Arab 
Emirates. 
Simply put, many aspects of this pro-
posed sale remain conceptual—concep-
tual. We are being asked to support a 
significant transfer of advanced U.S. 
technology without clarity on a num-
ber of key details regarding the sale or 
sufficient answers to critical national 
security questions. 
There are simply too many out-
standing questions about the protec-
tion of critical U.S. military tech-
nology and the broader implications of 
these sales to U.S. national security re-
garding the UAE’s relationships, for 
example, with Russia and China as 
they exist today—as they exist today. 
I have heard some of my colleagues 
say: Well, aren’t we concerned that 
they will go to Russia—they have rela-
tionships with Russia and China as it 
exists today in a military purchase 
context—and about the long-term im-
plications, of course, to the United 
States and to our ally, the State of 
Israel, in terms of national security? 
Now, it is disappointing that we are 
forced to discuss these issues in such a 
public way through a formal congres-
sional expression of disapproval. That 
is not normally how we do this. How-
ever, the administration left us no

choice because of the way that it at-
tempted to rush through these sales by 
completely 
subverting congressional 
oversight, and, it appears, increasingly, 
the need for greater interagency re-
view. 
Now, the U.S. Congress has a unique 
legislative responsibility to oversee 
U.S. arms sales abroad. This process al-
lows Congress to engage privately with 
relevant national security agencies and 
the intended recipient countries in 
order to better understand the intrica-
cies and security implications of any 
proposed sale. But as it has done be-
fore, the administration decided to ig-
nore the congressional responsibilities 
here and rush through with this sale. 
They blew right through that period of 
review that the Congress has had nor-
mally for about 40 days. 
Let me just say, the United Arab 
Emirates, from my view, has been an 
important partner in the fight against 
terrorism and for other U.S. national 
security priorities, and I will suspect it 
will continue to be so after this. It is 
unfortunate, however, that we find our-
selves in this situation. 
Following the historic Abraham ac-
cords, we started hearing that the ad-
ministration was planning to grant the 
UAE a longstanding request—the sale 
of the most advanced U.S. stealth 
fighter jets. Both the Emiratis—and I 
have spoken to their Foreign Minister 
and to their Ambassador—and the U.S. 
administration continued to insist, 
however, that there is no connection— 
none—between the Abraham accords 
and this sale. So that is a red herring 
for those who are concerned that some-
how we are going to disrupt the Abra-
ham accords. 
While I join just about all of my col-
leagues in applauding the advancement 
of diplomatic relations that builds 
upon years already of Israeli and 
Emirati engagement, there is abso-
lutely no reason to rush through an 
arms sale of this magnitude, especially 
when we are being told there is no con-
nection. 
Interagency review of such sales usu-
ally takes many months of careful de-
liberation. The Departments of State, 
Defense, and others must assess what 
capabilities are safe to sell, what tech-
nology security measures are appro-
priate and necessary, what restrictions 
on use are imposed, and how the sale 
will affect the national security of our 
friends and allies in the region and 
elsewhere. 
Once these deliberations have con-
cluded, a sale of this magnitude usu-
ally sits with the Senate Foreign Rela-
tions Committee for an informal re-
view process that, by the State Depart-
ment’s own requirement—the State De-
partment’s 
own 
requirement—would 
last 40 days. 
Then, for reasons the administration 
has concealed, it completely subverted 
this review process and officially start-
ed a statutory 30-day review—all before 
any briefings were even given to staff, 
let alone Senators and members of the 
committees of jurisdiction. 
To date, we have yet to get a clear 
answer as to why the President and the 
Secretary of State are trying to, again, 
circumvent the congressional arms 
sales oversight process by rushing the 
sale of 50 of the most advanced fighter 
jets in the world—technology that 
gives Israel and the United State a 
critical military advantage over any 
adversary. 
Moreover, the administration wants 
to push through without any congres-
sional oversight the second largest ever 
sale of armed Reaper drones to the 
UAE and over 14,000 additional aircraft 
munitions on top of the 60,000 already 
sold to Abu Dhabi as part of the non-
emergency last year. I say ‘‘non-
emergency’’ because they declared an 
emergency, but there was no emer-
gency to be justified. 
Delivery of the most advanced fea-
tures could take years. I say that be-
cause, therefore, there is no reason 
that giving us a timeframe to do what 
we normally do to determine whether 
this is the right sale in the national se-
curity interests of the United States, 
not starting an arms race in the Middle 
East, also dealing with Israel—is that 
too much to answer when you are not 
even going to get any of this equip-
ment for years? These are major sales 
by any measure. 
Part of this conversation is also, as 
my colleague has said, about Israel’s 
qualitative military edge that it cur-
rently has over its neighbors and was 
expected to maintain with its own pur-
chase of 50 F–35s that are still in the 
process of being built and delivered. 
Let me make it clear. I take a back-
seat to no one when it comes to ad-
vancing U.S. policies to protect Israel’s 
national security. I have proven that 
time and again. But this sale is fun-
damentally about U.S. national secu-
rity, about the U.S. qualitative mili-
tary edge, and about our long-term na-
tional security. It is also about not 
wanting to start and thinking about, at 
least, what does it mean in terms of an 
advanced arms race in the region. 
Unfortunately, particularly for Mem-
bers who do not serve on national secu-
rity committees, there is much we can-
not discuss in an open setting, but let 
me assure all of my colleagues that 
these sales have very real implications 
for their own technology security. 
On October 9 of this year, Armed 
Services 
ranking 
member 
Senator 
REED and I sent a letter to former Sec-
retary of Defense Esper and Secretary 
of State Pompeo with 16 detailed ques-
tions about the F–35 sale. To date, we 
have not received satisfactory answers 
to any or all of those questions. 
I ask unanimous consent to have 
that letter printed in the CONGRES-
SIONAL RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
Hon. MIKE POMPEO, 
Secretary of State, Department of State, Wash-
ington, DC. 
Hon. MARK ESPER, 
Secretary of Defense, Department of Defense, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR SECRETARY POMPEO AND SECRETARY 
ESPER: We write today to seek clarity on 
public reporting and mixed messaging from 
the Administration on a proposed sale of the 
F–35 aircraft to the United Arab Emirates. 
As you well know, Congress has statutory 
authority over foreign arms sales, but it ap-
pears that the Administration is trying to 
rush through a precedent-setting sale of the 
United States’ most advanced fighter air-
craft to a country in a volatile region with 
multiple ongoing conflicts. The Administra-
tion appears to be ignoring long-standing, 
deliberative, internal U.S. processes for con-
sidering whether selling such a sophisticated 
and mission-critical military system abroad 
could compromise the United States’ na-
tional security interests—and in this case 
Israel’s—and instead is rushing to meet a po-
litical deadline. 
There are numerous questions as to how 
the national security interests of both the 
U.S. and Israel will be served, or under-
mined, by such a sale. We fear that the 
Trump Administration’s recklessly acceler-
ated timeline will preclude sufficient and 
comprehensive consideration of these issues 
by the national security professionals in the 
Departments of State and Defense, as well as 
by the Congress. 
Emirati officials have publicly and pri-
vately declared that their decision to nor-
malize relations with Israel was not depend-
ent on getting the F–35; however, the Admin-
istration’s attempt to move at breakneck 
speed so close to this announcement would 
give the appearance that it was. Addition-
ally, this sale seems more tied to the Amer-
ican political calendar than to a sober delib-
eration about regional security. 
U.S. national security and the safety of 
American troops could be seriously com-
promised by this sale. The F–35 is one of the 
most advanced aircraft in the world, giving 
the United States and its allies and partners 
a 
tremendous 
military 
advantage. 
This 
therefore creates an immense counterintel-
ligence threat against this aircraft. Indeed, 
assessing the risk to our own military ad-
vantage is a critical part of the internal de-
liberations we must make before agreeing to 
provide this aircraft, including any recipient 
country’s history of use of U.S. origin weap-
ons and its capacity and willingness to pro-
tect critical U.S. technology. Indeed, given 
that the F–35 has been financed, developed, 
produced, and sold to our security partners 
as part of an international consortium, the 
sale has the risk of undermining their secu-
rity as well. 
In light of these concerns, we have listed 
below a series of vital questions that must be 
fully answered before this sale is sent to 
Congress for review, as required by statute. 
1) What precisely has the U.S. agreed to in 
terms of selling the F–35 and other aircraft 
to the UAE? 
How many? 
On what timeline for delivery? 
Has the U.S. received a formal Letter of 
Request from the UAE for these aircraft? 
2) Would the Emiratis have signed the 
Abraham Accords if not for the promise of 
this sale? Were F–35s or any other military 
sales discussed as part of deliberations re-
lated to the Abraham Accords? 
3) Has the UAE articulated a military 
threat necessitating the acquisition of F–35 
aircraft? 
How would the UAE employ F–35s against 
that threat? 
Are there other military or other means 
that could also counter this threat or 
threats?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7316 
December 9, 2020 
4) It has been reported that the U.S. and 
the UAE have agreed to conclude a Letter of 
Offer and Acceptance (LOA) for the aircraft 
by December 2nd. This is an extremely accel-
erated schedule for interagency review, con-
sultation with Congress, and preparation of 
the LOA and negotiation on its terms with 
the UAE—a process that can take months, if 
not longer. 
Is this deadline correct? 
If so, why did the Administration agree to 
this arbitrary deadline in concluding an 
LOA? 
How would such an accelerated timeline af-
fect the Congressional review and approval 
process? 
5) It has traditionally taken months for a 
complete and comprehensive interagency re-
view of a proposed sale of this importance 
and sensitivity. 
Has the U.S. interagency reviewed and de-
termined what variant of the aircraft would 
be best to sell, in terms of protecting the air-
craft’s technology and in terms of protecting 
Israel’s Qualitative Military Edge (QME)? 
If not, when will that review commence 
and how long might it take? 
6) Has a determination been made that the 
sale of this aircraft to the UAE will not jeop-
ardize Israel’s Qualitative Military Edge? 
If so, upon what basis was that determina-
tion made? 
7) Will any aircraft sold to the UAE be re-
duced in capabilities compared to com-
parable U.S. aircraft? 
If so, how much less capable will these air-
craft be compared to Israeli and U.S. F–35 
aircraft and other aircraft? 
Exactly which systems, software, and com-
ponents will be reduced in terms of oper-
ational capability in comparison with Israeli 
and U.S. aircraft, and to what degree and 
with what effect? Please provide a detailed 
written and graphic comparison. 
8) What anti-tamper measures will be in-
corporated into the F–35 and other aircraft 
sold to the UAE to ensure that critical or 
sensitive military technology and compo-
nents within such aircraft are not com-
promised, either in operation or in terms of 
revealing classified information about such 
technology and components? 
9) Will the UAE be required to enter into 
binding commitments not to employ such 
aircraft in situations that might expose 
them to technological intelligence collection 
efforts, such as exposure to advanced anti- 
aircraft radar systems? 
10) What secondary security measures will 
be put in place to protect critical U.S. tech-
nology inherent in the F–35? 
Will the U.S. require continuous U.S. pres-
ence on base to monitor the security of the 
aircraft? 
Will the U.S. be made aware of any pro-
posed third-party nationals to visit the 
base(s) where the F–35 aircraft are based? 
Will the U.S. be able to veto any physical 
presence of such nationals if, in the opinion 
of U.S. personnel present in the U.S. Em-
bassy or in Washington, the close physical 
proximity of such third-party nationals 
could constitute an intelligence threat to 
sensitive technology in or of these aircraft? 
Will any automatic electronic security 
measures be employed to protect U.S.-origin 
aircraft, manuals, and related documents? 
Will the maintenance and servicing of 
these aircraft be performed solely by U.S. 
personnel, or in concert with Emirati per-
sonnel? 
11) What measures will be taken to coun-
teract any reduction in Israel’s QME? 
Will the U.S. shift from a Qualitative Mili-
tary Edge measurement to a Quantitative 
one, selling or providing more aircraft and 
munitions meant to overwhelm the height-
ened military threat to Israel? 
If so, how will these additional arms to 
Israel be financed? Will the U.S. need to in-
crease Foreign Military Finance levels in 
order to offset this sale to the UAE? 
12) The UAE has taken an active role in 
supporting Khalifa Haftar, who has contin-
ued a brutal military campaign in Libya 
against the internationally recognized Liby-
an government. According to recent reports, 
the UAE may even have violated the U.N. 
arms embargo on Libya. 
What will prevent the UAE from using F– 
35 aircraft in conflicts where the United 
States and its allies are pressing for a diplo-
matic solution? 
Will the United States require any com-
mitments from the UAE that it will not em-
ploy such aircraft to the detriment of 
Israel’s security interests or the foreign pol-
icy and national security interests of the 
United States, as determined by the Israel 
and the U.S. respectively? 
13) To what extent would this sale stimu-
late an arms race in the region, both among 
the Gulf States and with Iran? With the arms 
embargo against Iran in danger of expiring, 
would this sale provide greater encourage-
ment to China and Russia to sell Tehran ad-
vanced fighter aircraft and advanced air de-
fense systems, in numbers and under more 
favorable financial terms than would other-
wise be the case? 
14) In 2017, the UAE and Russia signed an 
agreement to develop a fifth-generation 
fighter jet, along with a separate UAE pur-
chase of Russian Sukhoi Su-35 fighters. In 
addition, after being rebuffed in its attempts 
to purchase armed drones from the United 
States, the UAE reportedly purchased Chi-
nese surveillance drones and outfitted them 
with targeting systems. Other reports indi-
cate that expatriates from countries aligned 
with China operate some of the UAE’s weap-
ons systems. 
What is the status of the UAE’s coopera-
tion 
with 
Russia? 
Would 
these 
efforts 
present 
security 
and 
counterintelligence 
threats to the F–35? 
What assurances and commitments, if any, 
has the UAE made to the United States to 
safeguard U.S. technology from Russian and 
Chinese personnel that may be involved in 
either of these programs? 
Has the UAE agreed to terminate all such 
cooperation and purchases from Russia and 
China? 
15) 
What 
are 
the 
Administration’s 
thoughts regarding other sales of the F–35 in 
the region? 
16) Have you, or will you, consult with our 
partners about these risks and their views of 
this potential sale to the UAE concluding 
the sale? 
Will you take their concerns into account 
during the interagency review process to ad-
dress their concerns? 
We look forward to your immediate re-
sponse. 
Sincerely, 
ROBERT MENENDEZ, 
U.S. Senator. 
JACK REED, 
U.S. Senator. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. I am not opposed to 
these sales if they make sense and pose 
no threat to U.S. or Israel security in 
the short and the long term. But these 
sales require and deserve careful and 
deliberate consideration within the 
interagency process and by this Con-
gress. However, that simply has not 
happened. 
A little while ago, my distinguished 
colleague 
from 
Missouri, 
Senator 
BLUNT, asked on the floor: Well, what 
do you have to do to be a trusted part-
ner? Let me try to answer that ques-
tion. 
Following a classified briefing with 
the 
administration—the 
details 
of 
which I will not discuss here—there are 
a whole host of issues that a trusted 
partner would ultimately have to agree 
to. 
One, the United Arab Emirates has 
been building its military relations 
with Russia and China. Just a few 
years ago, the Emiratis and Russia 
signed an agreement to develop a fifth- 
generation fighter jet and to purchase 
Russian Sukhois. Our own Department 
of Defense inspector general recently 
indicated that they may be funding the 
malicious Russian Wagner mercenary 
forces in Libya. So what is the status 
of and what specific efforts are we tak-
ing to address the UAE’s current and 
future 
military 
relationship 
with 
China—where they are talking about 
building an airbase outside the UAE’s 
waters, on artificial land—and Russia? 
There are no answers to that. Do we 
not deserve, if we are going to send the 
most sophisticated equipment in the 
world to the UAE, to make sure that 
there is a written commitment that 
they are going to phase out those mili-
tary engagements? 
What specific steps and assurances 
are the United States taking to safe-
guard U.S. military technology against 
sophisticated espionage, and what spe-
cific commitments do we have from the 
Emiratis? There is no answer to that 
question. A trusted partner would 
agree to those safeguards. 
Three, the UAE last year transferred 
U.S.-origin weapons to a terrorist orga-
nization in Yemen that has a history of 
targeting civilians. The Emiratis have 
been repeatedly accused, along with 
others, of violating the U.N. arms em-
bargo on Libya. Well, what assurances 
do we have about how and where these 
new sophisticated weapons would be 
used? There is no answer. A trusted 
partner would agree to those limits. 
Four, the long-term threat of a high-
ly lethal arms race and the great power 
competition implication this could set 
off across the region and implications 
for 
future 
gulf 
cooperation—the 
Qataris have already asked for their 
own F–35s. Is that what is next? Saudi 
Arabia—well, they may say: We like 
the United Arab Emirates, but we can’t 
be inferior for our own national secu-
rity. 
What security threats would be posed 
when the entire region is armed with 
the most sophisticated weapon we have 
to offer? There are no satisfactory an-
swers, if any, to these questions. 
What guarantees do we have that 
these weapons will not be used against 
the United States or Israel’s national 
security in the future? How will that 
be determined? 
What might Israel need in the future 
to secure its qualitative military edge? 
There is no clear answer to that. 
What specific military threat have 
the Emiratis articulated that they 
need the F–35s to address right now? If

they have specific needs, then we need 
to know that because if these aren’t 
going to come online for some time, 
maybe their needs are more consequen-
tial and they need to be dealt with in 
a different way. 
How might the Iranians react to the 
increase of stealth fighter aircraft in 
their neighborhood? We have no anal-
ysis of that. 
Finally, the timeline. When will the 
letters of offer and acceptance be con-
cluded? Why was there an initial artifi-
cial deadline? Why the rush to cut 
short the normal, monthslong inter-
agency review process by the Congress 
and national security professionals? 
Why? Why? Are they trying to lock in 
the sale before President-Elect Biden is 
inaugurated, regardless of the possible 
cost to U.S. and Israeli national secu-
rity? We have no answer to that. 
As I have said before, the United 
Arab Emirates has been an important 
partner for critical U.S. interests, in-
cluding the fight against terrorism and 
in our efforts in Afghanistan. But ac-
cording to the United Nations and to 
the Department of Defense’s own in-
spector general, at the same time, the 
UAE also seems to be working against 
our stated interests in other areas. A 
trusted partner would be in collabora-
tion and in cooperation with us. 
Look, I wish we could have had these 
discussions in more appropriate set-
tings. That is what we normally would 
have done. 
This is, of course, not the first time 
the 
administration 
has 
subverted 
Congress’s important oversight role in 
arms sales. Last May, the administra-
tion notified more than $8 billion of 
weapons to Saudi Arabia and the 
United Arab Emirates. It cited a bogus 
‘‘immediate’’ threat from Iran, despite 
the fact that most of the sales, like 
these F–35s, would take years—years— 
to reach their intended recipients. 
So, colleagues, at the end of the day, 
we must assert our congressional pre-
rogative, not for the sake of preroga-
tive in and of itself but to safeguard 
the U.S. national security interests 
that we are all collectively and individ-
ually entrusted to do. 
We must demand answers to the very 
serious and very reasonable questions 
many have of this sale. Perhaps with 
due diligence, we will find that this 
sale will indeed bolster U.S. national 
security, but right now, the truth is, 
we do not have clarity on that most 
fundamental question. 
Colleagues, do you really want a sale 
of this magnitude to go through with-
out the appropriate vetting measures? 
Voting 
against 
these 
resolutions 
sends a message to the executive 
branch—I don’t care who is sitting 
there; the present occupant, a future 
occupant—whoever is sitting in the 
White House, that we are willing to 
give up our congressional responsibil-
ities. It is hard to bring that back once 
you let it go. It says that we will not 
stop arms sales in the future that have 
not gone through the appropriate re-
view process. 
For that reason, I urge all of our col-
leagues to support these resolutions of 
disapproval so that we may have more 
time to assess for ourselves the nu-
ances of these sales and the repercus-
sions they may have in the region for 
decades to come, to ensure technology 
transfer doesn’t take place, and to en-
sure that the national security inter-
ests of the United States are preserved. 
I urge you to support these resolutions 
to stand up for those propositions. 
Both are critical to protecting U.S. na-
tional security interests.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7318 
December 9, 2020 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
The committee of conference on the dis-
agreeing votes of the two Houses on the 
amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 
6395), to authorize appropriations for fiscal 
year 2021 for military activities of the De-
partment of Defense, for military construc-
tion, and for defense activities of the Depart-
ment of Energy, to prescribe military per-
sonnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for 
other purposes, having met, have agreed that 
the House recede from its disagreement to 
the amendment of the Senate and agree to 
the same with an amendment and the Senate 
agree to the same, signed by a majority of 
the conferees on the part of both Houses. 
Thereupon, the Senate proceeded to 
consider the conference report. 
(The conference report is printed in 
the House proceedings of the RECORD of 
December 3, 2020.) 
CLOTURE MOTION 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I send a cloture 
motion to the desk for the conference 
report. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clo-
ture motion having been presented 
under rule XXII, the Chair directs the

ator from Florida. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 1151 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the Sen-
ate proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of Calendar No. 189, S. 1151. I fur-
ther ask that the committee-reported 
substitute amendment be agreed to; 
that the bill, as amended, be considered 
read a third time and passed; and that 
the motion to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Connecticut. 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, reserv-
ing the right to object, this is a sub-
stantial proposal, one that merits full 
consideration on the floor of the Sen-
ate with the opportunity to debate and 
amend to understand how many gov-
ernment agencies would be affected, to 
understand whether it merits a sunset 
date, to understand what the effects 
would be, not just on the regime of 
Venezuela but the people of Venezuela, 
and for that reason I will object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
I rise to speak again today about the 
crisis in Venezuela, a defining human 
rights issue of our time. 
Nicolas Maduro is starving his own 
people, 
and 
innocent 
children 
are 
dying. It is a genocide right here in our 
hemisphere. Every day that passes, the 
situation in Venezuela grows more 
dire. 
This weekend, the world watched as 
Maduro orchestrated a sham election. 
No one was fooled by this pathetic at-
tempt. The appearance of democracy is 
not democracy. Maduro is a murderous 
dictator who doesn’t respect human 
rights or the will of his people. He 
must be stopped. 
The Trump administration has taken 
decisive action to hold Maduro ac-
countable, sanction the Venezuelan re-
gime, and cut off the funds Maduro 
uses to hold on to power. But the 
United States and all freedom-loving 
countries around the world must do 
more. 
As Governor, I strictly prohibited the 
State of Florida, including all State 
agencies, from investing in any com-
pany that did business with Maduro’s 
repressive regime. 
It is simple. Why would we ever use 
taxpayer money to support a regime 
that is killing its own people? 
My bill, the Venezuelan Contracting 
Restriction Act, does the same thing 
on the Federal level by prohibiting 
Federal agencies from doing business 
with anyone who supports Maduro. 
Last year, we included a targeted 
version of this measure in the NDAA 
that prohibited the Department of De-
fense from doing business with anyone 
supporting Maduro’s regime. 
Now it is time for us to be clear and 
united in our support for the Ven-
ezuelan people and prohibit every agen-
cy in the Federal Government from 
doing anything that would support 
Maduro and his genocide. 
Mr. President, I ask consent to ad-
dress the Senate in Spanish. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Florida. 
(English 
translation of the statement made in 
Spanish is as follows:) 
I stand with the people of Venezuela 
and will always fight for freedom and 
democracy in Latin America. 
Mr. President, what I have proposed 
is a simple action we can take as 
Americans to help end Maduro’s geno-
cide. 
I am completely disappointed with 
my Democratic colleague’s objection 
to my request today. This bipartisan 
proposal cleared the Homeland Secu-
rity and Government Affairs Com-
mittee with unanimous consent. 
I am eager to resolve my colleague’s 
concerns quickly, and I hope that he 
and the other Senator who objected be-
fore will work with me to get this 
done. Unfortunately, they have not 
been willing to meet with me to fix 
this and to get this done. 
I am not giving up and plan to bring 
this up again and again. We don’t have 
time to delay. We cannot lose sight of 
the fact that Nicolas Maduro is killing 
his citizens. We need to take every ac-
tion we can to say to Maduro that the 
United States will not stand and let 
this continue. 
Even though my bill was blocked 
today, I will never stop fighting until 
Venezuela and all of Latin America can 
begin a new day of freedom. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CLIMATE CHANGE 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I 
mentioned recently in one of these 
speeches that an identity-laundering 
group called Donors Trust decided to 
do a letter to the editor of my home 
State paper asserting that they were 
just as innocent as newborn lambs. 
The Center for Media and Democracy 
has recently obtained the IRS form 990 
for calendar 2019 for this little lamb, 
Donors Trust, and it has some fas-
cinating findings. 
Donors Trust took in a total of $312 
million in donations in 2019—nearly a 
third of a billion dollars—up from $198 
million in 2018. Of that, more than two- 
thirds came from two huge donations— 
two—one for $150 million and another 
for $69 million. 
Out of the $312 million they received, 
$219 million came in two donations, 
and both of the donations were anony-
mous. Now, who makes anonymous do-
nations of that size? Most people mak-
ing a donation that big want their 
name on the building at the university. 
What is going on? Who has that kind of 
money to give away and a desire to 
hide themselves? One wonders. 
Donors Trust gave out $162 million in 
anonymized grants in 2019—mostly to 
rightwing groups. This is up from $142.3 
million in 2018. I should actually prob-
ably not say that Donors Trust gave 
them out but, rather, that they trans-
mitted the funds for the anonymous 
donors because a donor can tell Donors 
Trust where the money is to go. Donors 
Trust then provides the expedient serv-
ice of hiding the donor’s identity. 
So where did this anonymous money 
go? Well, grants of interest include $7 
million to the Federalist Society—1 
year, $7 million—up from last year’s 
$5.9 million. Yes, this is the same Fed-
eralist Society that has selected judges 
and Justices for the Trump administra-
tion. 
Is it not obvious that big special in-
terests might buy their way to the 
Federalist Society judicial selection 
table with big, anonymous donations? 
When you farm out to secretive private 
organizations the power to select Su-
preme Court Justices and the secretive 
organizations take big, anonymous do-
nations, what else are you to expect?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7319 
December 9, 2020 
It would be interesting to know who 
paid for a voice in selecting Supreme 
Court Justices, and it would be inter-
esting to know what business they may 
have before the Court. But all of that is 
shrouded in secrecy and anonymity. It 
would be logical to assume that $7 mil-
lion bought a seat or two at that table; 
we just don’t know for whom or what 
their interests were. 
Relatedly, Donors Trust transmitted 
$10.5 million to something called the 85 
Fund, a Leonard Leo shell group for-
merly known as Judicial Education 
Project. Who is Leonard Leo? Leonard 
Leo ran the Justice-picking, Court- 
packing scheme for the Federalist So-
ciety for years until an expose by the 
Washington Post made it prudent for 
the operation to bring in a new face 
named Carrie Severino. It is a little bit 
like replacing a burned agent in a cov-
ert operation with a new agent. 
The logical conclusion is that this $10 
million is also related to packing the 
courts 
with 
special 
interest-chosen 
judges and Justices, and if so, that 
brings the total for that project to over 
$17 million, counting the Federalist So-
ciety money—$17 million in 1 year just 
through Donors Trust. 
Of course, once you have packed the 
Court with agreeable Justices, you 
need to tee up agreeable cases for 
them. And guess what. Donors Trust 
also transmitted $2.7 million to advo-
cacy groups that bring those cases, in-
cluding the groups that presented to 
the Supreme Court Janus, the anti- 
labor case, and Shelby County, the 
anti-voting rights case. These are just 
two of the more infamous of the 80 5- 
to-4 partisan decisions giving big wins 
to Republican donor interests—just the 
kind of interests that have the money 
to push millions through Donors Trust 
and the motive to use Donors Trust to 
cover their tracks. 
When this dark-money-funded enter-
prise is not busy at the task of packing 
the Court, it is busy propagating cli-
mate denial and obstruction. It has 
been at that particular scheme for 
years. Climate denial and related polit-
ical obstruction, packing the courts, 
and electing Republicans are the three 
primary purposes of this dark-money 
enterprise. 
To keep climate denial cooking, Do-
nors Trust transmitted nearly $19 mil-
lion to rightwing local so-called think 
tanks, collectively called the State 
Policy Network—a group that propa-
gates climate denial and obstruction at 
the State government level—and to 
ALEC, the American Legislative Ex-
change Council, which drafts up right-
wing and climate denial and obstruc-
tion legislation for State legislators. 
This ALEC group is so reprehensible 
that even ExxonMobil withdrew its 
support for it—or maybe they just 
laundered their support through Do-
nors Trust. We don’t know. 
Not content with climate denial and 
obstruction at the State level, Donors 
Trust also transmitted $4.5 million in 
anonymous money to eight different 
national climate denial organizations. 
These include the Heartland Institute, 
notorious for comparing climate sci-
entists to the Unabomber and sending 
200,000 fake, climate-denying textbooks 
to school teachers around the country. 
On this graphic prepared by a re-
searcher into the climate denial enter-
prise, Donors Trust is front and center, 
right here, right in the middle of the 
web, and that Heartland Institute is 
right here, part of the network. 
The other organization that it funded 
is the Competitive Enterprise Insti-
tute, which planted noted climate de-
nier Myron Ebell to lead the Trump 
transition at EPA and usher in the dis-
graced Scott Pruitt as Administrator. 
On a personal note, I should thank 
Donors Trust for transmitting $769,000 
from some anonymous donor or donors 
to a dark-money opposition research 
group called Capital Research Center, 
which has as one of its tasks to feed 
misinformation about me to rightwing 
media outlets. I think that is my re-
ward for calling out this whole crooked 
dark-money operation. And wouldn’t 
you know—they send out a dark-money 
group to defend their dark-money oper-
ation. I appreciate the attention and 
the irony. 
Others in the Donors Trust dark- 
money creep show include $4 million to 
Project Veritas, which cooked up de-
ceptive sting videos in Minnesota and 
other States to feed the false election 
fraud narrative of Donald Trump and 
the far right, and also $1.5 million to a 
beauty 
called 
VDARE 
Foundation, 
whose website is a vector for anti-Sem-
itism, xenophobia, and White nation-
alism. I can see why someone would 
want to hide giving a million dollars to 
that. 
Donors Trust has a tag-along entity 
that sends a lot of money into the 
same places—the Charles Koch Founda-
tion. In fact, it is a little hard to tell 
where this Koch Foundation ends and 
where Donors Trust begins. 
Donors Trust has provided signifi-
cant financial support to the Koch po-
litical operation’s major front group 
through the Americans for Prosperity 
Foundation, which is here on the 
graphic. It is like a reunion going 
through this research. And Donors 
Trust, in turn, has received financial 
support from the Charles G. Koch 
Foundation. So money out to the Koch 
political operation and in from the 
Koch Foundation. I don’t know why 
the Koch Foundation couldn’t just 
have given the money directly. 
It has been reported that the Koch 
network has provided Donors Trust 
with most of its backbone, even to the 
point of being described as part of the 
Koch network, and the Donors Trust 
employees 
have 
extensive 
histories 
within the Koch network of political 
front groups. 
The Center for Public Integrity re-
ported this gem: ‘‘At a private Koch 
fundraising meeting in the summer of 
2010, Donors Trust hosted cocktails and 
dessert for . . . a ‘target-rich environ-
ment’ of wealthy donors.’’ Sweet in-
deed. 
So when we look at this Charles Koch 
Foundation, we are looking at some-
thing interlinked with Donors Trust, 
and sure enough, there is also overlap 
in where the money goes. 
In 2019, this Koch Foundation gave 
out $141 million, up from $127 million 
in 2018. For the State-level climate de-
nial State Policy Network we talked 
about, it gave $2.5 million across 13 so- 
called think tanks, and it gave nearly 
half a million dollars to that same 
ALEC—American Legislative Exchange 
Council—we talked about. 
Other Koch grants of note include 
over $22 million to George Mason Uni-
versity, whose role as a hothouse for 
developing deregulatory and climate 
denial theories is well documented in 
Nancy Maclean’s terrific book, ‘‘De-
mocracy in Chains.’’ This $22 million 
continues a relationship that helped 
put Koch operative Neomi Rao from 
George Mason into the Trump White 
House and then onto the DC Circuit 
Court of Appeals to do the Koch oper-
ation’s business from behind robes. 
Remember 
those 
special 
interest 
front groups that tee up legal cases for 
the judges and Justices who have been 
ushered onto the courts? The Koch 
Foundation turns up there too. The 
Koch Foundation has spread $6.2 mil-
lion around 10 separate amici curiae— 
friends of court, so-called—that showed 
up in a case called Americans for Pros-
perity v. Becerra. And what do you 
know? Yes, Americans for Prosperity is 
that Koch political operation’s main 
front group—such a small world. 
Why would Koch political interests 
want to fund amici in a case where a 
Koch front group is already the plain-
tiff? Well, let’s look at that case. The 
‘‘Becerra’’ in Americans for Prosperity 
Foundation v. Becerra is the California 
attorney general, a nominee for HHS 
Secretary now, I gather. The case is an 
abstruse technical challenge to how 
the IRS shares tax information with 
States. 
Why this gathering of the Koch-fund-
ed clan of front groups around this lit-
tle technical case? Because the life-
blood of all this dirty operation is dark 
money. Indeed, today, our Supreme 
Court is the Court that dark money 
built. So the dark money operation 
sees a chance to enshrine dark money 
in the American Constitution. The 
dark money forces that built this 
Court want the Court to expand the 
First Amendment to protect anony-
mous, dark money political spending 
by secretive billionaires and corporate 
interests. This is the case where they 
intend to make their move. It is wait-
ing in the Supreme Court right now. 
Who knows, maybe it has been waiting 
for Justice Barrett. 
Lined up as amici curiae in this oth-
erwise nondescript case, in the order of 
their Koch Foundation funding, are: 
the Cato Institute—I can’t read this 
well enough to point them out, but 
these are inhabitants of this graph as

well—$2.4 million from the Koch Foun-
dation; Texas Public Policy Founda-
tion, $1.5 million; Pacific Legal Foun-
dation, $1 million; New Civil Liberties 
Alliance, $1 million; Buckeye Institute, 
$104,200; Independent Women’s Forum,

Philanthropy 
Roundtable, 
$30,000; Institute for Justice, $12,584; 
and National Right to Work Legal De-
fense Foundation, $8,156. When you 
look at the kind of money that is being 
doled out, I think the Institute for Jus-
tice and the National Right to Work 
Legal Defense Foundation have some 
cause to complain that they got treat-
ed so poorly with such small donations 
from such a big operation. 
The gathering of that clan is not the 
only clue that something is up. Big 
players in the dark money racket, like 
the fossil fuel titan Marathon Petro-
leum 
and 
the 
massive 
climate 
obstructer that calls itself the U.S. 
Chamber of Commerce, are already ob-
jecting to requests for information 
about their dark money operations by 
asserting that such a right exists. They 
are already asserting that such a right 
exists, while the dark money schemers 
are lining up in this case to make that 
push to the Supreme Court. Wouldn’t it 
be convenient if they helped build a 
Court willing to agree with them and 
establish this new right to dark money 
influence? 
This whole dark money mess smells 
to high heaven. Why big donors feel 
they have to hide? Why this com-
plicated network to play Whac-A-Mole 
with different groups who can show up? 
Why the orchestration of Supreme 
Court briefs with groups that purport 
to be separate? Why the whole scheme? 
It is a recipe for corruption. It prevents 
citizens from understanding what is 
going on in their own democracy. It 
empowers the worst forces in politics. 
It is the mechanism through which cli-
mate denial has been effectuated, and 
it is wrapping its tentacles more and 
more tightly around our U.S. Supreme 
Court. 
And Donors Trust—that sweet little 
lamb—is at the center of the web 
dolling out hundreds of millions of dol-
lars—some lamb. Donors Trust is a 
wolf in lamb’s clothing or perhaps bet-
ter to say Donors Trust provides the 
lamb’s clothing that cloaks the wolves 
so that they can feed more voraciously 
and anonymously on America’s body 
politic. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I was lis-
tening to the previous speaker from 
Rhode Island, and I figure it is time to 
clarify a few things that are said about 
our President. 
I know that right now a lot of people 
are believing that we are going to have 
a change; that we will have a Demo-
cratic President. A lot of decisions are 
being made, talk is being made. But to 
show you that there is a big difference 
of opinion, I want to say a few things 
about our President just to remind peo-
ple. They have forgotten what has hap-
pened. Now, I know there are differing 
opinions on that, partisan opinions and 
all that. 
Right now, my very close friend from 
the Democratic aisle and I are going 
to, hopefully, have a vote tomorrow 
that will take place, the Defense au-
thorization bill—the biggest bill of the 
year, the most significant bill of the 
year. Senator REED
and I have an 
agreement on almost every element of 
it. And we have both come to the con-
clusion that it is a tremendous bill. It 
is one you really can’t justify opposing. 
A lot of things have been said that 
are not true, but I want to just men-
tion a couple of things because this is 
a good time to do it. 
We have a President who has done 
things that just have never been done 
before in terms of accomplishments, 
positive accomplishments. I remember 
2 years ago, I wrote this little card be-
cause I was keeping track of all these 
goods things that have happened. I re-
member showing it to the President at 
that time. He read that, and he was 
very excited about the way that we had 
composed them. Keep in mind, this was 
2 years ago. 
Look at these 10 things that this 
President has done: First of all, the big 
tax cut that he had. By the way, when 
we look at the fact that he did such 
great things for the economy—prior to 
the pandemic, we had the best economy 
we have had in my lifetime. The pan-
demic changed all of that. But he did 
this by looking back at history—and it 
was not a Republican; it was a Demo-
crat. It was President Kennedy who 
had the wisdom to say, when he was 
working on the Great Society pro-
grams that were going to cost so much 
money: Well, we have to raise our rev-
enue, and the best way to increase rev-
enue is to decrease tax rates. So he de-
creased tax rates. We all remember 
that. While it worked, unfortunately, 
the President died before he could real-
ly take advantage and enjoy the bene-
fits of the work he had done by his tax 
cuts. It has been tried since that time, 
and it has worked. 
But what this President did in addi-
tion to that, he didn’t have just tax 
cuts; he had regulation cuts. I call it 
the golden day of regulation relief, the 
best economy we have had in that pe-
riod of time. They say that full em-
ployment is 4 percent unemployment, 
when, in fact, we actually got down 
below 3 percent. That was something 
that has not been done in my memory, 
and all these things happened and good 
benefits came from that. 
There is a difference of opinion be-
tween Democrats and Republicans, and 
we understand that. I have always felt 
the best thing and indicator of success 
in the economy is to see how many 
people you get off of food stamps, and 
a lot of liberal friends say that they 
measure it by how many people get on 
food stamps. Nonetheless, we have 5 
million people off of food stamps. That 
is what happened, and that is why we 
had the economy that we had. I hate to 
think of where we would be today if we 
had started with an average economy. 
We started with the best economy we 
had in my lifetime, and that was be-
cause of the President and the support 
he had from our party. 
The second thing I hold up—now, 
keep in mind, I am from Oklahoma. We 
are an oil State. We renewed—during 
the Obama administration, there was a 
war on fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are 
coal, oil, and gas, and it was an effort 
to try to get it back into renewables. 
Someday we may have the develop-
ment of renewables. They are not there 
now. In spite of what the previous 
speaker said, they are not there and 
available now. So what this President 
did was he stopped the war on fossil 
fuels. 
As a result of that, we had—and this 
is in the first 2 years—a 277-percent 
growth in crude exports, 132-percent in-
crease in coal exports, and a 52-percent 
increase in natural gas exports. A lot 
of that translated into the economy 
that we were enjoying. 
In terms of illegal immigration—I 
know this became very controversial— 
the wall. People didn’t like the idea of 
the wall. I can remember a conversa-
tion I had with Netanyahu when I was 
in Israel once, and he said he didn’t un-
derstand how a modern State can have 
borders that are not secured. He said: 
You can’t do that. That doesn’t work. 
Well, he has now gotten that done 
against a lot of opposition—we all 
know that—in Israel. 
How many Presidents—every Presi-
dent I can think of in my career here in 
Washington has said we need to move 
the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jeru-
salem, but they don’t do it. So this 
President just went ahead and did it. 
He is a little abrupt—we understand 
that—but he got these things done. 
The WRDA bill—the Water Resources 
Development Act—right now and, actu-
ally, the FAA reauthorization were 
both booming successes. They were his 
efforts. 
And then the judges. I don’t know 
that it is a record, but in the period of 
time, the 4 years that this President 
has been in office, we have had about 
220 judges who have been confirmed. 
These are all judges who have one 
thing in common: They really believe 
in the Constitution. They are Constitu-
tionalists. In addition to that, he has 
three of the U.S. Supreme Court Jus-
tices. 
Then, on the repeal, if you talk to 
anyone in business in America—this 
was a couple of years ago—about the 
biggest problem they had was the 
Dodd-Frank effort. That was the over-
regulation of business and industry. 
And so he relaxed those rules, and that 
created a lot of prosperity, a reason for 
the economy that we have today, and 
the record employment that he has 
given us of 157 million jobs. 
This is back 2 years ago.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7321 
December 9, 2020 
Now, I would say, if you single out 
one thing—I don’t say this critically of 
the Obama administration. We all have 
different priorities, and I have consid-
ered President Obama to be a friend. 
However, his top priority was not a 
strong national defense. He had other 
priorities. We all know that. 
As a result of that, if you will take 
the last 5 years—that would have been 
from the year 2010 to 2015—in the last 5 
years, he reduced the funding of the 
military by 25 percent. It has never 
been done before. 
But that is something that this 
President came in and immediately— 
and I chair the committee, so I was 
very much involved in this. But we 
ended up with all these things that— 
the lifting of that and putting it back 
in the position that it should be. 
Now, this is interesting because 
somebody reminded me—John Bonsell 
reminded me this morning. He said: 
What you ought to do is get a list of 
these things that have happened since 2 
years ago. So real quickly, just to say, 
identifying China as the No. 1 adver-
sary in the NDS—that is the National 
Defense System, which has worked 
very successfully. That is a program 
that is put together by six Republicans 
and six Democrats, all experts in the 
field. 
I talked about national defense, and 
he stuck with that and has identified 
China for the problems that they are 
giving us right now. 
He had new investments in the fu-
ture. Hypersonics is a good example. 
After the last administration, China 
and Russia both surged ahead of us in 
the research on hypersonics. That is 
one of the most recent developments of 
modern equipment. That has worked, 
and we are not quite there yet, but we 
are catching up in the cyber world. He 
is advancing it in that area. 
Then as far as the terrorist leaders 
Baghdadi and Soleimani, both of them 
were considered to be the worst terror-
ists on the planet, and he has taken 
both of them out. 
He established the Space Force. The 
Space Force is something that we real-
ly needed to do not because so much 
that we were behind in anything but 
the fact that our competition—Russia 
and China—were in their particular 
space forces, and we wanted to make 
sure everybody knew and our partners 
knew that we were right there with 
them. 
Then, of course, he eliminated the 
widow’s tax. We remember that. 
And the Abraham accords—this is 
really interesting. We have Arab coun-
tries right now that are working close-
ly with Israel. This hasn’t happened be-
fore. The UAE is right now working 
with them. And the Israelis didn’t have 
to give up anything, so that is a major 
advancement that we are enjoying. 
Then, of course, one of the issues we 
are working on right now is on the 
arms sales. We feel that we need to be 
selling arms to our allies, and we want 
to make sure that the whole world 
knows that, as a loyal friend of ours, 
we want to make sure that we do for 
them what we should be doing for 
them. 
During that timeframe he rescued 55 
hostages in 24 countries. That is a big 
deal. 
So, anyway, all these things have 
been going on—and getting tough. I 
know people are upset with his atti-
tude toward NATO. He believes in 
NATO, but he believes that the part-
ners in NATO need to start carrying 
their fair share. And it worked. It in-
creased their share by about $130 bil-
lion. 
That is something that, when you 
talk to real people—when you get out 
of Washington and you talk to the peo-
ple on the street, they say: Why are we 
in NATO when they are not carrying 
their end of it? Well, that is all chang-
ing. 
Anyway, that is what this President 
has done. But there is one thing that is 
happening that I think is maybe the 
most significant thing that this Presi-
dent has accomplished. He came out 
with something. I don’t know who 
thought of the words ‘‘Warp Speed’’ be-
cause I have had a hard time remem-
bering that. I have to write it down be-
cause I forget it. 
But he came out with something 
where—General Perna is a real expert 
and has been monitoring what is going 
on and getting the medical equipment 
necessary to defeat this thing that we 
have been under now for almost a year. 
And he said—keep in mind, this is back 
in June. In June, he said, by year-end— 
by December, maybe as early as No-
vember, but by December we are going 
to have the decision made and have a 
way to stop the pandemic that has 
been plaguing us for so long. 
We had a hearing—and the Presiding 
Officer knows this because he was in 
attendance at that hearing—and we 
looked at the things that General 
Perna was coming up with that showed 
us conclusively that we were going to 
have a vaccine that was going to work 
by year-end and then it would take 
about 3 months after that to get the 
distribution going. 
So we are talking about having this 
thing over by April. Now, the inter-
esting thing—that happened in June, 
yet that is still, today—we are right on 
schedule for that to happen. 
My fellow Senator from Oklahoma, 
JAMES LANKFORD, gave a speech yester-
day. It was fascinating. He took a long 
time to do it, but he went into all the 
indicators that were out there, and you 
come to the conclusion that this 
plague is going to be over and we are 
going to be able to get back to normal. 
And that will be certainly good. 
So I just want to mention that those 
things are happening, and those things 
are things that were on behalf of our 
President. There are, out there, a lot of 
people—I have never seen the media 
turn against someone like they have 
our President. So people don’t even 
know these good things, but I am hop-
ing we can get this out so that people 
will be aware of it. 
Now, back to the bill that we are 
going to have. I know that my partner, 
who is the ranking member on the 
Armed Services Committee, is going to 
want to be heard concerning some of 
the great things that we are going to 
be doing in that bill. I will be doing the 
same thing tomorrow morning. 
So this is a bill that we can all be 
proud of. I have never seen it misrepre-
sented as much as this bill has been 
misrepresented. 
With that, I am anxious to hear my 
partner talking. 
I will yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
H.R. 6395 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, I also want 
to thank the chairman for his extraor-
dinary leadership in getting us to this 
point. 
For 59 years straight we have passed 
the National Defense Authorization 
Act, and I think, honestly, without the 
chairman’s leadership we would have 
failed this year. So he is owed a great 
debt of gratitude by all of us and appre-
ciation, particularly from the men and 
women of the military. 
Let me speak a bit about this year’s 
bill: the William M. (Mac) Thornberry 
National Defense Authorization Act for 
Fiscal Year 2021. 
We reached a conference committee 
report which was fair and bipartisan. 
In fact, I think the best testimony of 
that was the vote last evening by the 
House of Representatives—335 to 78, 
with 1 Member voting present. That is, 
by definition, bipartisan, substantive, 
overwhelmingly 
supported 
by 
both 
sides as a fair—not only fair but ex-
traordinarily beneficial piece of legis-
lation for the country. 
You don’t get that vote on something 
that is partisan and narrowly defined 
and divisive. This bill is bipartisan. 
Again, Exhibit A: the vote last night in 
the House of Representatives. 
We have passed it for 59 years. There 
should be no exception this year. This 
is the 60th. And I hope we complete 
that and I expect we will complete that 
tomorrow. 
And, indeed, this whole effort, like 
everything else in this country, has 
been twisted and exacerbated by the 
COVID virus. We have to deal with 
that, but we recognize that, despite all 
the complications, despite all of the 
issues that come before us, one of our 
most important constitutional duties 
is to provide for the security of this 
Nation and provide for the men and 
women who wear the uniform of the 
United States. This bill does that. 
This important bipartisan legislation 
enhances 
our 
national 
security, 
strengthens military readiness and de-
fense capabilities, protects our forces 
and their families, and it supports the 
defense industrial base. 
This bill authorizes the active and re-
serve component end strength nec-
essary to meet national defense objec-
tives, provides a 3-percent across-the-

board pay raise for the troops, and au-
thorizes a number of bonus, special, 
and incentive pay authorities nec-
essary to retain and recruit the highest 
quality individuals for military serv-
ice. 
The conference report, as I indicated, 
passed by an overwhelming margin in 
the House, and I hope and believe we 
will have that same outcome tomorrow 
in the Senate. 
Despite everything in this bill to sup-
port our forces and bolster our national 
security, there have been threats to 
veto the bill by the President. That is 
his prerogative as President of the 
United States, but our responsibility 
and our prerogative is to pass legisla-
tion which is sound, we hope bipar-
tisan, and serves the needs of the Na-
tion and, particularly in this case, the 
troops. And I believe we have done 
that. 
There has been some discussion by 
the President of a repeal of section 230 
of the Communications Decency Act of 
1996. Obviously that is not in our juris-
diction. It is a complicated issue. To 
simply, at the end of this process, stick 
it in does a great disservice to the com-
mittees of jurisdiction, as well as to 
the complexities involved in taking 
away a major factor in the operation of 
social media companies all across this 
country. 
So, once again, I think it was wise to 
resist trying to insert a repeal of sec-
tion 230 into the bill. Indeed, our na-
tional security and our troops should 
not be held, in a sense, hostage to a 
very specific business concern, and our 
legislation does not do that. 
As I mentioned a moment ago, the 
crisis affecting every citizen is an ex-
ponential spread of the COVID–19 virus, 
and our military is not immune. As of 
last Wednesday, more than 31,000 mili-
tary personnel were infected. If you 
add their families and Defense Depart-
ment civilians, the number is over 
48,000. These infections undermine our 
readiness, including the ability to train 
and to deploy safely. 
To respond to this health crisis— 
again, the most serious crisis we have 
faced in 100 years, with respect to the 
pandemic—the conference agreement 
requires the Department to develop a 
strategy for pandemic preparedness 
and response, maintain a 30-day supply 
of personal protective equipment, and 
to have the capability to resupply such 
equipment rapidly and review the Mili-
tary 
Health 
System’s 
response 
to 
COVID–19. 
The conference agreement also re-
quires the creation of a registry of 
TRICARE beneficiaries diagnosed with 
COVID–19 and provides transitional 
health benefits for National Guard 
members and their families. 
I can’t think of a more timely and 
necessary provision than this provision 
in our legislation, which addresses this 
pandemic that faces us today. 
Now, there has been one very high 
profile—there are several high profile 
but one high profile issue that is sur-
rounding the bill this year, and that is 
the conference agreement inclusion of 
the Senate provision renaming mili-
tary installations that are named after 
Confederate leaders. 
This provision establishes a commis-
sion to make recommendations for the 
renaming or removal of names, sym-
bols, displays, monuments, and para-
phernalia that honor or commemorate 
the Confederacy or any person who 
served voluntarily with the Confed-
eracy. The provision also requires the 
Secretary of Defense to rename and 
implement the commission’s plan with-
in 3 years of enactment. 
Now, I know the President recalls 
this, but this passed our committee by 
voice vote with one, I recall, objection 
by the Senator from Missouri. It came 
to the floor, and there were some at-
tempts to make changes, but changes 
were not made. The bill passed over-
whelmingly 
for—I 
believe 
over 
80 
votes—including the precise language 
that is in this conference report. 
So we went from committee to the 
floor, to the conference with the same 
language that was not objected to sig-
nificantly by anyone. I think that 
should be pointed out. 
The senior Department officials at 
the Department of Defense are all open 
to changing these names. There is bi-
partisan support and cooperation on 
this issue, and I think it will be some-
thing that will be implemented and 
will be appropriately implemented. 
The conference agreement also in-
cludes a number of provisions aimed at 
increasing 
diversity 
and 
inclusion 
within the Department of Defense and 
military services, including the cre-
ation of a Chief Diversity Officer with-
in the Department and the inclusion of 
programs at the Department to re-
spond to White supremacist, extremist, 
and criminal gang activity within the 
Armed Forces. 
I say with some sense of remorse and 
regret that, unfortunately, there are 
some—I don’t think significant num-
bers but some of these individuals. We 
have to respond to them, and we are re-
sponding to them. 
The conference report also includes 
the Elijah Cummings Anti-Discrimina-
tion Act of 2020, which expands and en-
hances anti-discrimination employee 
protections for Federal workers. 
Also, 
the 
conference 
agreement 
strengthens the Department’s civilian 
workforce by including technical fixes 
and improvements to the Paid Parental 
Leave Program authorized in last 
year’s Defense bill. 
As the Presiding Officer recalls, last 
year was a major breakthrough, giving 
Federal employees the incentive of 
paid parental leave. It has been ex-
tremely well received. Now we have 
made sure that no one has been left 
out. 
We are all, I believe, disappointed 
that, as we look at the record of all the 
services dealing with sexual assault in 
the military, they have not made the 
progress I think we all deem necessary. 
To reduce barriers and encourage vic-
tims of sexual assault to report that 
they were assaulted, the conference re-
port requires the Secretary of Defense 
to establish a safe-to-report policy that 
would allow victims to report sexual 
assault without being punished for 
minor misconduct related to the as-
sault. 
We are also concerned about the 
issue of domestic violence affecting our 
military families. The conference re-
port requires the Defense Department 
to contract with a private sector inde-
pendent entity to assess the Depart-
ment’s domestic violence program and 
to recommend improvements to en-
hance the prevention of and response 
to domestic violence in the military. 
Let me turn to the requirements of 
specific military services. The con-
ference report supports a number of 
programs necessary for modernization, 
including 
robust 
funding 
for 
the 
Army’s Future Vertical Lift Program 
and long-range precision fires. 
For the Navy and Marine Corps, the 
bill would add roughly $3 billion to au-
thorize a number of unfunded priorities 
identified by the Chief of Naval Oper-
ations and the Commandant, including 
funding for the CNO’s top unfunded pri-
ority, the 10th Virginia-class submarine 
in the current multiyear procurement 
program. It also mandates changes in 
the oversight and execution of ship-
building and unmanned systems devel-
opment programs—changes that should 
help instill more rigor and discipline 
within the Navy’s efforts. 
With respect to the Air Force, the 
bill helps improve oversight of the De-
partment by requiring the Secretary of 
Defense to submit an annual 30-year 
plan for the procurement of aircraft 
across the services—all the services— 
which is similar to the 30-year ship-
building report that is already in stat-
ute. The bill also supports the Depart-
ment’s efforts to achieve reduced oper-
ating and support costs of the F–35 pro-
gram. 
Turning to science and technology, I 
am pleased that the bill increases fund-
ing for important research activity 
such as artificial intelligence 
and 
quantum computing. It also includes 
several provisions that strengthen our 
domestic manufacturing and industrial 
base, including in critical sectors such 
as microelectronics, pharmaceuticals, 
and rare earth materials. 
The conference report adopts a large 
number of recommendations from the 
Cyberspace 
Solarium 
Commission, 
which was cochaired by Senator KING. I 
must applaud him for his extraordinary 
work. They did remarkable work, Sen-
ator KING and his colleagues in the 
Senate and the House of Representa-
tives. 
The conference report establishes the 
National Cyber Director position with-
in the Executive Office of the President 
to provide national leadership for cyber 
security, which cuts across many dif-
ferent agencies and jurisdictions. This 
is one of the key recommendations, but

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7323 
December 9, 2020 
we have many more recommendations 
included in the report. 
As we turn and look at the world out-
side of the United States, particularly 
with regard to Russia and Europe, the 
conference report enhances our ability 
to deter Russian aggression, maintains 
strong support for Ukraine, and reaf-
firms our commitment to the Trans-
atlantic Partnership by calling for a 
strong U.S. force posture and capabili-
ties in Germany. 
The conference report also expands 
sanctions on entities engaged in the 
construction of the Nord Stream 2 
Pipeline and a requirement to impose 
sanctions under the Countering Amer-
ica’s Adversaries Through Sanctions 
Act, CAASTSA, on Turkey for its pur-
chase of the Russian S–400 air defense 
system. 
Turning to China, our other major 
adversary—and as the chairman point-
ed out the two major features in the 
new national defense strategy authored 
under the guidance and direction of 
President Trump—turning to China, 
the bill established the Pacific Deter-
rence Initiative, a new authority for 
the Department of Defense modeled 
after the European Deterrence Initia-
tive, and authorizes an additional $150 
million in funding. And I give great 
credit to the chairman because it was 
his idea, and he asked me to partici-
pate with him. But it is a great rec-
ognition of the world as it is today— 
China in an adversarial position—and 
we responded to it. 
I believe this is one of our strongest 
bills yet on countering the threat that 
China poses to the United States and 
our 
partners 
and 
allies, 
including 
India, Taiwan, and other countries in 
the region. 
With respect to countering the con-
tinued threat posed by ISIS, the con-
ference report extends the Iraq and 
Syria train-and-equip programs at the 
requested funding level, while ensuring 
appropriate congressional oversight of 
the use of such funds. 
Specific to Iraq, the conference re-
port continues efforts to normalize se-
curity 
assistance 
to 
Iraq 
by 
transitioning funding to enduring au-
thorities and not other temporary au-
thorities we have been using over the 
last several years—many years, frank-
ly. 
For Afghanistan, the bill extends the 
authority to train and equip Afghan se-
curity forces and enhances congres-
sional oversight. It requires an assess-
ment of the progress made on such 
issues as anti-corruption, recruitment 
and retention of security forces, and 
commitments made by the Afghan 
Government in support of intra-Afghan 
negotiations. It also includes a restric-
tion on funding to reduce U.S. forces in 
Afghanistan until the administration 
submits an assessment of the impact of 
such actions on U.S. interests. 
In addition, the bill includes a provi-
sion to enhance congressional over-
sight of the administration’s negotia-
tions with the Taliban to ensure the 
Taliban is in compliance with the com-
mitments made on February 29, 2020, 
and to address current and projected 
threats to the homeland emanating 
from Afghanistan. 
The key commitment is that we 
would be able to maintain a counter-
terrorism presence that would be ade-
quate and sufficient to suppress any 
threat emanating from Afghanistan, 
and that has to be confirmed. We are 
still waiting for that confirmation. 
I am also pleased the conference 
agreement includes several provisions, 
collectively 
known 
as 
the 
United 
States-Israel Security Assistance Act, 
to extend foreign assistance, coopera-
tive development programs, and other 
support to Israel. These provisions 
demonstrate our unwavering commit-
ment to Israel. 
Turning to our nuclear triad, the 
conference report authorized the Presi-
dent’s request to continue the mod-
ernization of our nuclear deterrent, 
which is quickly nearing the end of its 
use life, and the President recognizes 
that very precisely. The conference re-
port will also ensure the continuation 
of much needed modernization efforts 
to continue to rebuild our aging Na-
tional Nuclear Security Administra-
tion infrastructure. The conference re-
port does not support additional test-
ing, as the directors of our weapons 
labs have assured us and certified that 
it is not necessary at this time. 
The bill before the Senate is bipar-
tisan, with strong support in Congress. 
This bill is critical to our national se-
curity, but more importantly, it pro-
vides the resources our troops need in 
order to do their job and return home 
safely to their loved ones. Any discus-
sion of vetoing this bill undermines the 
commitment, I believe, that we have 
made 
to 
our 
servicemembers 
and 
should be off the table. Vetoing this 
bill would send the wrong signal to our 
forces, our allies, and our adversaries 
at exactly the wrong time. It is not 
necessary, and it should be avoided. 
Let me close in the way that I began. 
Let me commend Senator INHOFE. He 
has worked this bill tirelessly, and I 
believe he has been fair and trans-
parent throughout the process. As I 
said before, the reason we have this bill 
for the 60th year—assuming our vote is 
strong tomorrow—is because of the 
chairman and several others, but it is 
the chairman principally. 
I would also like to take a moment 
to commend MAC THORNBERRY. The bill 
is named after Mac. He is an extraor-
dinary gentleman. I had the privilege 
of serving with him for 2 years in the 
House of Representatives. He is an in-
dividual whose wise counsel, whose in-
tegrity, whose decency, and whose 
dedication to the men and women of 
the armed services is unparalleled. He 
is an extraordinary gentleman. I can’t 
think of a more fitting tribute and a 
more apt tribute than naming this bill 
after MAC THORNBERRY. 
I have to conclude by saying that de-
spite the appearance we have done all 
this work, our staff is extraordinary. 
John Bonsell and Liz King—the staff 
directors—did superb work. Let me rec-
ognize my staff, my Democratic staff: 
Jody Bennett, Carolyn Chuhta, Jon 
Clark, Jonathan Epstein, Jorie Feld-
man, Creighton Greene, Ozge Guzelsu, 
Gary Leeling, Maggie McNamara Coo-
per, Kirk McConnell, Bill Monahan, 
Mike 
Noblet, 
John 
Quirk, 
Arun 
Seraphin, Fiona Tomlin, and last but 
not least, Elizabeth King. 
Again, this Fiscal Year 2021 National 
Defense Authorization Act conference 
report is the culmination of months of 
hard work. It is a good bill. I would 
say, in fact, it is one of the best bills 
that we have had in many, many years, 
and it will provide for our national se-
curity and our men and women in uni-
form and their families. I urge my col-
leagues to support it. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. INHOFE. Let me first of all say 
that my colleague, ranking member of 
the Armed Services Committee, Sen-
ator REED, is absolutely right. I think 
about the people that he was praising, 
the staff people. 
You don’t very often hear people 
back in the real world really appre-
ciating the time and effort that comes 
from the staff. In this case, the two in-
dividuals that Senator REED
talked 
about, John Bonsell, Liz King—I don’t 
remember one weekend that they have 
had off during this whole thing. 
They are just workaholics. They 
know how significant this is. They 
know we had a defense authorization 
bill for the last 60 years, and the worst 
thing we could do to our kids in the 
field who are risking their lives is not 
send them the resources necessary that 
are in this bill to defend America.

MORNING BUSINESS 
STOP THE WAIT ACT 
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, today I 
rise to discuss the dangerous practice 
we have in this country that forces 
people with disabilities to wait for ben-
efits and healthcare coverage. I would 
first, however, like to congratulate my 
colleague, the senior Senator from 
Rhode Island, for his diligence and per-
sistence in working to eliminate the 5- 
month waiting period for those who 
have amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, 
known as ALS. His perseverance is ad-
mirable, and I congratulate him for 
eliminating this misguided policy for 
people with ALS. 
My hope is we can expand this vic-
tory to eliminate the waiting periods

for Social Security Disability Insur-
ance benefits and Medicare coverage to 
all eligible Americans. 
Forcing Americans to wait 5 months 
to begin cash benefits and then another 
24 months for Medicare coverage is a 
dangerous policy. In many cases, appli-
cants have little or no income while 
they are waiting for government bene-
fits to begin. We should not be forcing 
someone with stage-4 breast cancer or 
Huntington’s Disease or any of the dis-
abilities or diseases that qualify a per-
son for Social Security Disability In-
surance to wait to receive benefits. 
Those who have been determined eligi-
ble are American workers who have 
paid into the Social Security system 
throughout their lives. We have an ob-
ligation to assist Americans in their 
time of need in a timely manner. When 
a person receives a diagnosis, bills do 
not 
wait 
5 
months 
to 
be 
paid, 
healthcare costs are not put on hold for 
2 years. Their rent, their utilities, 
their healthcare copayments come due 
immediately. Therefore, the benefits 
these American workers have paid for 
through their Social Security contribu-
tions should be made available to them 
when they are found eligible. 
I would again like to congratulate 
the senior Senator from Rhode Island. 
His bill is an important step forward 
for people with ALS and for all people 
eligible for SSDI benefits. Let’s use 
this moment to move forward and 
make comprehensive change to the 
way we administer SSDI benefits to all 
eligible Americans with disabilities. 
Every eligible applicant continues to 
have essential expenses and needs the 
cash benefits and healthcare coverage 
provided by Medicare. 
My bill, S. 2496, the Stop the Wait 
Act, would eliminate the waiting peri-
ods for those eligible for SSDI benefits, 
regardless of diagnosis. It would elimi-
nate the 5-month waiting period for 
SSDI benefits, and it would eliminate 
the 24-month waiting period for Medi-
care coverage. It would help keep peo-
ple from slipping in to poverty and 
would ensure they have healthcare cov-
erage. 
Today, let’s celebrate the policy vic-
tory and the great work Senator 
WHITEHOUSE has accomplished to im-
prove the lives of Americans with ALS. 
Tomorrow and for the days to come, 
let’s work to secure that victory for all 
Americans who are eligible for SSDI. 
They cannot wait. 
f 
PAID ACT 
Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. Mr. 
President, yesterday, the Provide Ac-
curate Information Directly, PAID Act 
took a pivotal step closer to becoming 
law. Once enacted, this vital legisla-
tion, which I had the privilege of co-
authoring with Senator Cardin, will 
save tens of millions of taxpayer dol-
lars through targeted and common-
sense updates to the Medicare sec-
ondary payer, MSP, statute, which 
Congress first codified four decades 
ago. The PAID Act aims to ensure that 
the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid 
Services, CMS, in coordinating claims 
related to Medicare Advantage MA, or 
Medicare Part D plans, can provide the 
information needed for settling parties 
to resolve claims-fairly and efficiently. 
In short, this bill is a boon for sen-
iors, Main Street job creators, and the 
American taxpayer. 
As this bill approaches the legislative 
finish line, I would like to thank Chair-
man GRASSLEY for his invaluable sup-
port in working with my office, as well 
as with our Democratic counterparts 
and with CMS, to bolster, refine, and 
identify legislative avenues for our 
proposal. I would also like to thank 
Senator CARDIN for his partnership in 
co-leading this legislation, along with 
Representatives KIND
and BILIRAKIS, 
who introduced a companion bill in the 
House, which passed by voice vote yes-
terday. Together, I feel confident that 
we can see the PAID Act signed into 
law by the end of the year. 
Congress amended the MSP statute 
in 2007 to require parties to a dispute— 
known as primary plans—to report set-
tlements, judgments, and awards to 
Medicare through so-called section 111 
reports. 
This 
amendment 
allowed 
Medicare to-seek recovery from set-
tling parties when Medicare paid for 
healthcare because other payment was 
not available or reasonably expected to 
be available. While this system has 
functioned well for the Medicare Fee- 
for-Service program, where CMS has 
the claims data needed for recovery, it 
has not worked successfully for the MA 
Part C and Part D programs, where 
CMS does not have the requisite Part C 
and Part D claims data and cannot re-
cover for payments that have been 
made. To compound the problem, set-
tling parties are often unable to iden-
tify the correct Part C or Part D plan 
to be able to coordinate benefits, 
should they choose to do so. This legis-
lation closes that critical information 
by having CMS communicate the Part 
C and Part D plan identification to set-
tling parties in response to a section 
111 report. CMS has that data and can 
provide it. 
Congress recognizes that for the last 
8 years, CMS has provided section 111 
reports to the Part C and Part D Plans, 
and Congress expects that CMS will 
continue to do so after this legislation 
is enacted. Further, the existing MSP 
statute and regulations impose specific 
requirements on CMS, and on Part C 
and Part D plans, to pay for claims in 
some situations, to not pay for claims 
in other situations, and to pursue re-
covery of claims when appropriate. 
Nothing in this legislation is intended 
to change any of those obligations or 
requirements, and Congress expects 
Part C and Part D plans to continue to 
seek recovery of claims by timely noti-
fying settling parties when a payment 
has been made that should be reim-
bursed, consistent with the CMS notice 
procedures. This legislation is only in-
tended to provide more information to 
the settling parties so that they have 
the ability to coordinate with Part C 
and Part D plans earlier, if they so 
choose. 
Congress has afforded CMS 12 months 
to implement this law, and we urge the 
agency to move with all deliberate 
speed to both implement its own sys-
tem changes and coordinate with pri-
mary plans throughout the implemen-
tation process. Regular communication 
and coordination will prove critical in 
ensuring that Primary Plans are aware 
of the data exchange requirements that 
CMS plans to implement and are pre-
pared as quickly as possible to utilize 
the data CMS will be providing under 
this law. By involving all stakeholders 
throughout the implementation proc-
ess, CMS can implement our intent 
that the needed plan identity informa-
tion be available for parties to coordi-
nate benefits as efficiently as possible.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
RECOGNIZING BAYSHORE FIT 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, as chair-
man of the Senate Committee on Small 
Business and Entrepreneurship, each 
week I recognize a small business that 
exemplifies the American entrepre-
neurial spirit at the heart of our coun-
try. It is my privilege to recognize a 
family-owned small business that pro-
motes American health and wellness by 
operating a gym and fitness business. 
This week, it is my pleasure to recog-
nize Bayshore Fit of Tampa, FL, as the 
Senate Small Business of the Week. 
In 2012, partners Jeff Fink and Beth 
Scanlan 
founded 
Bayshore 
Fit 
in 
Tampa, FL. Both Jeff and Beth had 
years of experience training for mara-
thons, bodybuilding, and fitness com-
petitions. Together, they created a 
gym that met the demand for a person-
alized alternative to large national 
gym chains. Jeff and Beth focused on 
helping every customer meet their 
health goals, developing a family- 
friendly, relationship-driven business. 
As their client base grew, they quickly 
moved their gym into a larger facility. 
Today, Bayshore Fit continues to 
serve the Tampa area, with members 
ranging from first-time gym attendees 
to senior citizens and even professional 
athletes. The gym has been featured in 
local media, recognizing their signifi-
cant membership growth and continued 
emphasis on personalized programs. 
Bayshore Fit’s emphasis on healthy 
living extends to their philanthropic 
endeavors. They are involved with the 
South Tampa Chamber of Commerce 
and the Westshore Alliance in Tampa’s 
Westshore business district. For more 
than 8 years, Bayshore Fit has spon-
sored local youth sports teams. They 
regularly support local nonprofit orga-
nizations, including Frameworks of 
Tampa Bay, Inc., which fosters youth 
social and emotional development. 
Like many of Florida’s small busi-
nesses, 
Bayshore 
Fit

December 9, 2020 
closed its doors due to the coronavirus 
pandemic. In April 2020, the U.S. Small 
Business Administration launched the 
Paycheck Protection Program, a small 
business relief program that I was 
proud to author. The PPP provides for-
givable loans to impacted small busi-
nesses and nonprofits who maintain 
their payroll during the COVID–19 pan-
demic. 
Jeff and Beth used their PPP loan to 
keep their business operating until 
Florida 
allowed 
gyms 
to 
reopen. 
Bayshore Fit pivoted to provide virtual 
classes and video training sessions. 
When they reopened, Bayshore Fit de-
veloped an outdoor workout facility. 
They also introduced a Bayshore Fit 
app to manage workout class schedules 
and the number of people allowed to 
enter the gym. 
Bayshore Fit exemplifies the unique 
role of relationship-driven small busi-
nesses in building communities. I com-
mend their support to youth athletics 
programs and promoting public health. 
Congratulations to Jeff, Beth, and 
the entire team at Bayshore Fit. I look 
forward to watching your continued 
growth and success.∑

TRIBUTE TO BRENDA TORPY 
∑ Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I rise 
today to recognize Brenda Torpy, who 
is retiring this month after decades of 
service at Champlain Housing Trust. 
Brenda is not only a leader and ally in 
the fight for affordable housing, she is 
a longtime friend. 
When I was elected mayor of Bur-
lington, VT, in 1981, I knew I had a 
unique opportunity to change the way 
things were done, and to serve working 
families and others who had been left 
behind by past administrations. My vi-
sion was for a municipal government 
that worked for every one and in-
creased fairness and equity so that all 
Burlington residents could get ahead. 
At the time, far too many residents 
were struggling to keep up with rising 
housing costs due to gentrification and 
development, and owning their own 
home—a hallmark of the American 
dream—felt like an impossible goal. I 
wanted to change that. 
My vision for housing in Burlington 
could never have become a reality 
without Brenda and her work to estab-
lish 
a 
community 
land 
trust 
in 
Vermont. Brenda served as the city’s 
first housing director in the newly cre-
ated Community and Economic Devel-
opment Office—CEDO—a role in which 
she demonstrated remarkable talent 
and dedication. It was Brenda and her 
colleagues who proposed the idea of a 
community land trust, which was a 
novel idea at the time. Thanks to their 
work with the Institute for Community 
Economics and their successful engage-
ment with the community, this innova-
tive model for affordable housing came 
to the city of Burlington and was es-
tablished as the Burlington Commu-
nity Land Trust, now the Champlain 
Housing Trust. The trust did some-
thing truly transformative: Through 
shared equity, it gave low-income peo-
ple access to homeownership that was 
never possible before. Because the land 
trust remains affordable in perpetuity, 
the homes are still affordable today 
and will remain so long into the future. 
From her role at CEDO, Brenda went 
on to play a pivotal role in the Cham-
plain Housing Trust’s growth and suc-
cess. She served as the first board 
president and, in 1991, became the exec-
utive director. Nearly 30 years later, 
the Champlain Housing Trust is the 
world’s largest community land trust, 
with 2,600 affordable homes, including 
566 designated for shared equity owner-
ship; more than 6,000 members; and 
nearly $300 million in assets. The 
Champlain Housing Trust has not only 
benefited Burlington area residents and 
Vermonters. Brenda has used her tal-
ent and dedication to assist countless 
communities around the country inter-
ested in starting their own programs, 
making the work of the trust a na-
tional and international model, now es-
tablished in it at least 23 States and 8 
countries. Additionally, as an active 
member of the Neighborworks Alliance 
of Vermont, Brenda partnered with 
other housing organizations to assist 
Vermonters all across our State. 
I am extremely pleased to see com-
munity land trusts serving people 
worldwide, 
and 
remain 
incredibly 
proud that the model was spearheaded 
in my hometown of Burlington, VT. 
While much work remains to achieve 
our shared goal of making affordable 
housing a human right, I am enor-
mously grateful to Brenda for her ca-
reer-long dedication to achieving this 
vision. With Brenda’s retirement at the 
end of this year, we will lose an excep-
tional leader in the housing commu-
nity, but I am confident that her con-
tributions will not be forgotten. The 
Champlain Housing Trust and its port-
folio represent an impressive legacy, 
but perhaps even more impressive is 
the enduring positive impact her work 
has had on the countless lives changed 
thanks to affordable housing. Because 
of Brenda, older Vermonters on fixed 
incomes are able to stay in their 
homes; New Americans and refugees 
can provide stability for their families 
as they adapted to a new culture and 
community; single parents can rely on 
a safe, consistent home in which to 
raise their children; and young home-
owners can break the cycle of poverty 
by purchasing an asset that will grow 
in value over time. Quite simply, 
Vermont and Vermonters are better off 
today because of Brenda. 
Becoming executive director of the 
Trust the same year I arrived in Wash-
ington, it is no exaggeration to say 
Brenda lent her expertise to me gener-
ously throughout my time in Congress. 
There was never an instance when my 
staff and I could not rely on Brenda to 
provide expert insights on the housing 
challenges we still face, and to put a 
human face on what can seem like ab-
stract and intractable problems. She 
also brought great energy and innova-
tion to this work, and her bold think-
ing—one of the qualities that made her 
indispensable in my municipal admin-
istration—will also be sorely missed. I 
count Brenda among my closest allies 
in affordable housing, and I have great-
ly appreciated working alongside her 
for nearly four decades. She has been a 
tremendous colleague and friend. I 
wish her all the best in her well-de-
served retirement.∑

f 
PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS 
The following petitions and memo-
rials were laid before the Senate and 
were referred or ordered to lie on the 
table as indicated: 
POM–263. A concurrent resolution adopted 
by the Legislature of the State of Louisiana 
urging the United States Congress and the 
Louisiana congressional delegation to take 
such actions as are necessary to fully fund 
the Livestock Indemnity Program in re-
sponse to the negative impact created by 
losses to the Louisiana livestock industry as 
a result of Hurricane Laura and Hurricane 
Delta; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nu-
trition, and Forestry. 
HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 24 
Whereas, Hurricane Laura made landfall 
along the coast of Louisiana on August 27, 
2020, as a category four storm, becoming the 
strongest storm in Louisiana history and 
causing an estimated ten billion dollars in 
damage from the southwestern to the north-
ern part of the state; and 
Whereas, Hurricane Laura created an esti-
mated one billion six hundred million dollar 
loss to the Louisiana agriculture industry, 
including a loss of one million eight hundred 
thousand dollars to the livestock sector 
alone; and 
Whereas, an estimated one hundred one 
thousand poultry, one hundred thirty cattle, 
and a dozen horses died as a direct result of 
the storm and the extreme health and insect 
conditions that followed; and 
Whereas, Louisiana was hit directly by 
Hurricane Delta on October 9, 2020, causing 
more catastrophic damage to many of the 
same areas of the state as Hurricane Laura; 
and 
Whereas, Hurricane Delta likely created 
numerous additional losses to the Louisiana 
agriculture industry, including livestock, 
the extent of which will only be known after 
surveys and research of the industry can be 
conducted; and 
Whereas, the 2014 Farm Bill authorized the 
Livestock Indemnity Program, within the 
United States Department of Agriculture, to 
provide benefits to eligible livestock owners 
or contract growers for livestock deaths in 
excess of normal mortality caused by eligi-
ble loss conditions, including adverse weath-
er, disease, and attacks; and 
Whereas, the United States Congress ne-
glected to fund the Livestock Indemnity 
Program 
properly, 
creating 
a 
situation 
where Louisiana livestock producers are un-
able to utilize the program at a time when it 
is needed most to offset losses created by 
Hurricane 
Laura 
and 
Hurricane 
Delta. 
Therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana 
does hereby memorialize the United States 
Congress and the Louisiana congressional 
delegation to take such actions as are nec-
essary to fully fund the Livestock Indemnity 
Program in response to the negative impact 
created by losses to the Louisiana livestock 
industry as a result of Hurricane Laura and 
Hurricane Delta. Be it further 
Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be 
transmitted to the presiding officers of the 
Senate and the House of Representatives of 
the Congress of the United States of America 
and to each member of the Louisiana con-
gressional delegation. 
POM–264. A concurrent resolution adopted 
by the Legislature of the State of Louisiana 
urging the United States Congress to take 
such actions as are necessary to pass a stim-
ulus plan that includes funds for unemploy-
ment, housing, local government, struggling 
businesses, education, and health care; to 
the Committee on Finance. 
HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 30 
Whereas, since surging around the globe 
into a worldwide pandemic earlier this year, 
the COVID–19 virus has taken an enormous 
economic and human toll across countries 
and continents, crippling heretofore healthy 
citizens and industries; and 
Whereas, to help states with costs for 
COVID–19 mitigation and response measures, 
the United States Congress passed the 
Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Secu-
rity (CARES) Act; and 
Whereas, measures designed to protect the 
health and safety of Louisiana’s populace 
from the COVID–19 virus have also had a 
negative impact on the economic fortunes of 
many of those same citizens through lost or 
reduced income from closures, capacity re-
strictions, and other public health measures; 
and 
Whereas, the cost of this highly infectious 
pandemic to Louisiana businesses, citizens, 
and local and state government continues to 
rise; and 
Whereas, the unprecedented number of un-
employment insurance claims due to COVID– 
19 has drained the state’s previously robust 
unemployment insurance trust fund; and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7327 
December 9, 2020 
Whereas, local revenue collections have 
plummeted as economic activity has slowed, 
and as a result, local governments are strug-
gling to provide crucial services; and 
Whereas, already made vulnerable by lost 
jobs or decreased income from the COVID–19 
pandemic, many Louisiana citizens face the 
prospect of housing insecurity as they strug-
gle to provide a safe and secure place for 
themselves and their families to live while 
also maintaining basic services such as 
water, electricity, and food; and 
Whereas, the federal government provided 
unemployment and housing assistance in its 
last COVID stimulus package, but there is a 
great need for further economic relief. 
Therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana 
does hereby memorialize the United States 
Congress to take such actions as are nec-
essary to pass a stimulus plan that includes 
funds for unemployment, housing, local gov-
ernment, struggling businesses, education, 
and health care; and be it further 
Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be 
transmitted to the presiding officers of the 
Senate and the House of Representatives of 
the Congress of the United States of America 
and to each member of the Louisiana con-
gressional delegation.

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTION 
By Ms. HIRONO: 
S. 4986. A bill to prevent an unin-
tended drop in Social Security benefits 
due to COVID–19 and the application of 
the National Average Wage Index, and 
improve Social Security and Supple-
mental Security Income benefits on an 
emergency basis; to the Committee on 
Finance. 
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, during 
the last year Americans everywhere 
have experienced the health, social, 
and economic impacts of COVID–19. 
Millions of workers and families have 
experienced unemployment or under-
employment, and millions more have 
struggled to cover rent, utilities, gro-
ceries, and other everyday living ex-
penses. 
People in Hawaii have fully experi-
enced these challenges. We went from 
having one of the lowest to one of the 
highest unemployment rates in the 
United States. At the height of the 
pandemic in May, Hawaii’s unemploy-
ment rate reached 23.5 percent—an un-
precedented number for our state. 
Family-owned 
businesses 
have 
closed, in many cases permanently, 
putting pressure on those families, 
their employees, and the communities 
they serve. Larger and medium-sized 
businesses have also closed, meaning 
furloughs, fewer hours, and reduced 
wages for their employees. 
Because of this, many families have 
had to make difficult decisions regard-
ing their household finances. 
Some families have had to use what-
ever limited resources they have saved 
over the years, including retirement 
savings, to keep their heads above 
water. Others have had to find different 
ways to make ends meet and pay their 
bills—despite fewer hours and reduced 
wages. 
Simply put, the economic downturn 
has been widespread, deeply-felt, and 
shared. 2020 has been a difficult year, 
and businesses, workers, and families 
will continue to feel its effects for 
many years to come. 
Congress needs to continue its work 
to provide relief for workers and fami-
lies, so today I am introducing the So-
cial Security COVID Correction and 
Equity Act. 
Specifically, this bill would provide 
temporary emergency relief for indi-
viduals who rely on Social Security, in-
cluding retirees, disabled workers, de-
pendent children and grandchildren, 
and others. 
Separately, the bill would also make 
a technical correction (or ‘‘fix’’) to the 
Social Security ‘‘notch’’ to make sure 
individuals who turn 60 this year (those 
in the ‘‘1960 cohort’’) are not unneces-
sarily penalized for the recent eco-
nomic downturn. 
Social Security benefits are cal-
culated based on an individual’s life-
time earnings, but are indexed to ac-
count for wage increases over time. As 
a result, lower wages this year will 
mean permanently lower benefits for 
certain beneficiaries unless Congress 
acts. This bill addresses how wages are 
indexed to calculate earnings when de-
termining benefits. 
By some estimates, the downturn 
could reduce benefits by around $960 
per year for the average worker. 
Preventing these reductions is a bi-
partisan issue, and I hope we can work 
together to address the issue for the 
millions of individuals who would be 
affected 
nationwide—including 
the 
17,800 seniors in Hawaii who turn 60 
this year. 
While most of these individuals will 
not receive their benefits for another 
two years, future retirees and other 
beneficiaries are concerned about the 
issue now, and we have an opportunity 
to provide them with some certainty 
during these difficult times. 
Workers and families are hurting 
now, and we need to do what we can to 
prevent them from being harmed in the 
future too. 
I encourage my colleagues to support 
this important bill. 
I yield the floor. 
By Mr. GRAHAM (for himself, 
Mr. COONS, Mr. RUBIO, Mr. 
CARDIN, Mrs. BLACKBURN, and 
Mr. CARPER): 
S. 4996. A bill to ensure funding of 
the United States trustees, extend tem-
porary bankruptcy judgeships, and for 
other purposes; considered and passed. 
S. 4996 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Bankruptcy 
Administration Improvement Act of 2020’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) Because of the importance of the goal 
that the bankruptcy system is self-funded, at 
no cost to the taxpayer, Congress has closely 
monitored the funding needs of the bank-
ruptcy system, including by requiring peri-
odic reporting by the Attorney General re-
garding the United States Trustee System 
Fund. 
(2) Congress has amended the various 
bankruptcy fees as necessary to ensure that 
the bankruptcy system remains self-sup-
porting, while also fairly allocating the costs 
of the system among those who use the sys-
tem. 
(3) Because the bankruptcy system is 
interconnected, the result has been a system 
of fees, including filing fees, quarterly fees in 
chapter 11 cases, and other fees, that to-
gether fund the courts, judges, United States 
trustees, and chapter 7 case trustees nec-
essary for the bankruptcy system to func-
tion. 
(4) This Act and the amendments made by 
this Act— 
(A) ensure adequate funding of the United 
States trustees, supports the preservation of 
existing bankruptcy judgeships that are ur-
gently needed to handle existing and antici-
pated increases in business and consumer 
caseloads, and provides long-overdue addi-
tional compensation for chapter 7 case trust-
ees whose caseloads include chapter 11 reor-
ganization cases that were converted to 
chapter 7 liquidation cases; and 
(B) confirm the longstanding intention of 
Congress that quarterly fee requirements re-
main consistent across all Federal judicial 
districts. 
(b) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this Act and 
the amendments made by this Act is to fur-
ther the long-standing goal of Congress of 
ensuring that the bankruptcy system is self- 
funded, at no cost to the taxpayer.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7331 
December 9, 2020 
Whereas Ethiopia has been beset in recent 
years by multiple human rights and humani-
tarian challenges, including targeted ethnic 
violence, natural disasters, and political un-
rest, leading to the internal displacement of 
more than 1,800,000 Ethiopians in 2020 alone; 
Whereas tensions between Prime Minister 
Abiy Ahmed’s Prosperity Party and the 
Tigray People’s Liberation Front, which was 
part of the ruling coalition in Ethiopia until 
late 2019, escalated when the Tigray People’s 
Liberation Front held elections in the region 
of Tigray on September 9, 2020, despite the 
decision by the Federal Government of Ethi-
opia to postpone general elections due to the 
COVID–19 pandemic; 
Whereas the Tigray People’s Liberation 
Front rejected the postponement of elections 
and considered the extension of the term of 
the Federal Government to be unconstitu-
tional, and the Federal Government subse-
quently deemed the Tigray elections illegit-
imate; 
Whereas, in the early hours of November 4, 
2020, the Tigray People’s Liberation Front 
carried out an attack on the Northern Com-
mand of the Ethiopian National Defense 
Forces; 
Whereas Prime Minister Abiy then ordered 
a military offensive and 6-month state of 
emergency in the Tigray region, which has 
evolved into an armed conflict in the region 
and surrounding areas between the Ethio-
pian National Defense Forces and the Tigray 
People’s Liberation Front, with reports of 
thousands of deaths; 
Whereas the Tigray People’s Liberation 
Front claims it acted in self-defense and has 
accused the Ethiopian National Defense 
Forces of striking some civilian targets; 
Whereas the Tigray People’s Liberation 
Front admits to having fired missiles at 2 
airports and having launched rockets across 
the border into Eritrea in what they say was 
retaliation for air strikes in the Tigray re-
gion; 
Whereas Amnesty International confirmed 
that, on November 9, 2020, ‘‘likely hundreds’’ 
of ethnic Amhara people were stabbed or 
hacked to death in the town of Mai-Kadra in 
the Tigray region, and some witnesses at-
tributed the killings to retreating Tigray 
People’s Liberation Front forces; 
Whereas the Ethiopian Human Rights 
Commission has expressed concern over the 
arrests of journalists in connection to the 
conflict in the Tigray region and called on 
the Government of Ethiopia to respect due 
process rights; 
Whereas the closures of roads and airports 
servicing the Tigray region have contributed 
to shortages of fuel and other necessary 
goods and impeded the delivery of humani-
tarian assistance to more than 2,000,000 peo-
ple already in need of aid, including approxi-
mately 100,000 Eritrean refugees and hun-
dreds of United States citizens living in the 
region; 
Whereas the Government of Ethiopia has 
shut down electricity, banking, internet, and 
telephone services in the Tigray region, cre-
ating additional challenges for the delivery 
of humanitarian services and the protection 
of civilians; 
Whereas the conflict has already forced ap-
proximately 50,000 Ethiopians to flee to 
Sudan, and aid agencies warn that more than 
200,000 refugees could enter Sudan, Djibouti, 
and Eritrea in the next 6 months; 
Whereas the United Nations High Commis-
sioner for Human Rights warned that ‘‘there 
is a risk this situation will spiral totally out 
of control, leading to heavy casualties and 
destruction, as well as mass displacement 
within Ethiopia itself and across borders’’; 
Whereas, 
according 
to 
international 
human rights organizations, Tigrayans have 
been suspended from their jobs and pre-
vented from leaving the country, and there 
are reports of surveillance and mass arrests 
of citizens of Ethiopia based on their eth-
nicity; 
Whereas the United Nations Special Ad-
viser on the Responsibility to Protect and 
the Acting Special Adviser on the Preven-
tion of Genocide have expressed deep concern 
over ‘‘reports of incidents of ethnically and 
religiously motivated hate speech, incite-
ment to violence and serious human rights 
violations 
including 
arbitrary 
arrests, 
killings, displacement of populations and de-
struction of property in various parts of the 
country,’’ stressing that the ethnically moti-
vated attacks and reported ethnic profiling 
of citizens constitute ‘‘a dangerous trajec-
tory’’ that heightens the risk of atrocity 
crimes; 
Whereas the conflict in the Tigray region 
occurs within the context of democratic 
transition in Ethiopia, an uptick in targeted 
ethnic violence in Ethiopia, ongoing talks, 
mediated by the African Union, between 
Ethiopia, Egypt, and Sudan over the filling 
and use of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance 
Dam, Ethiopia’s rapprochement with Eri-
trea, and the fragile democratic transition 
and peace process in Sudan; 
Whereas the conflict in the Tigray region 
jeopardizes the security and stability not 
only of Ethiopia, but of the broader East Af-
rica region, particularly as Ethiopia with-
draws its troops from Somalia to support do-
mestic needs, including the operation in the 
Tigray region; 
Whereas African Union Chairman Cyril 
Ramaphosa, President of South Africa, has 
appointed Joaquim Chissano, former Presi-
dent of Mozambique, Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, 
former President of Liberia, and Kgalema 
Motlanthe, former President of South Africa, 
as envoys to mediate a resolution to the con-
flict in the Tigray region, but the Govern-
ment of Ethiopia has dismissed calls for me-
diation as of December 2020; 
Whereas, on November 28, 2020, the Govern-
ment of Ethiopia claimed victory in the con-
flict after a series of artillery strikes on 
Mekelle, the capital city of the Tigray re-
gion, with Prime Minister Abiy announcing 
that his forces had ‘‘completed and ceased’’ 
military operations and would shift focus to 
rebuilding the region and providing humani-
tarian assistance while Federal police at-
tempt to apprehend leaders of the Tigray 
People’s Liberation Front; 
Whereas, although Prime Minister Abiy 
stated that no civilians were harmed by the 
operation in Mekelle, the communications 
blackout in the Tigray region impedes 
verification of that claim and the Inter-
national Committee of the Red Cross re-
ported on November 29, 2020, that 80 percent 
of patients at Ayder Referral Hospital in 
Mekelle were suffering trauma injuries; 
Whereas, on November 29, 2020, Debretsion 
Gebremichael, leader of the Tigray People’s 
Liberation Front, disputed Prime Minister 
Abiy’s claims of victory and told reporters 
that Tigray People’s Liberation Front forces 
were withdrawing from Mekelle but would 
continue fighting the Federal Government; 
and 
Whereas United Nations High Commis-
sioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi noted 
that although the Government of Ethiopia 
announced the completion of military oper-
ations in the Tigray region, it ‘‘does not 
mean the conflict is finished’’: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) strongly disapproves of the escalation 
of political tensions between the Govern-
ment of Ethiopia and the Tigray People’s 
Liberation Front into armed conflict and 
condemns in the strongest terms any and all 
violence against civilians, such as the re-
ported mass killings in Mai-Kadra, Ethiopia; 
(2) appreciates the readiness of Sudan and 
Djibouti to welcome refugees fleeing the con-
flict in the Tigray region of Ethiopia and 
supports the de-escalation efforts led by the 
African Union; 
(3) calls on the Government of Ethiopia to 
immediately and fully restore electricity, 
banking, telephone, and internet service in 
the Tigray region; 
(4) urges all parties to the conflict to— 
(A) cease all violence and refrain from ac-
tions that could spread or escalate the con-
flict, including attacks on international or 
civilian targets; 
(B) engage in good faith in regional and 
international mediation efforts to end the 
conflict and commit to a credible, inclusive 
dialogue towards a sustainable resolution of 
political grievances; 
(C) comply with international humani-
tarian law, guarantee unfettered humani-
tarian access to areas affected by the con-
flict, and take all possible steps to protect 
the safety of civilians, including refugees, 
displaced persons, and humanitarian aid 
workers; 
(D) respect and promote the rights of all 
people in Ethiopia to free expression, polit-
ical participation, and due process without 
discrimination based on ethnicity or reli-
gion; and 
(E) allow for, and cooperate with, inde-
pendent and transparent investigations of 
any alleged human rights abuses committed 
in the course of the conflict and hold per-
petrators to account; and 
(5) urges the Secretary of State, the Sec-
retary of the Treasury, and the Adminis-
trator of the United States Agency for Inter-
national Development, in coordination with 
the heads of other relevant Federal depart-
ments and agencies, to— 
(A) engage at the highest levels with lead-
ers of the Government of Ethiopia and the 
Tigray People’s Liberation Front to encour-
age dialogue to address the root causes of 
the conflict, achieve sustainable peace, and 
mitigate the humanitarian crisis; 
(B) end the pause of all non-life-sustaining 
assistance to Ethiopia and support program-
ming 
to 
meet 
immediate 
humanitarian 
needs, including of refugees and internally 
displaced persons, advance nonviolent con-
flict resolution and reconciliation, and aid 
democratic transition in Ethiopia; 
(C) consider imposing targeted sanctions 
on any political or military officials found 
responsible for violations of human rights 
carried out in the course of the conflict; 
(D) take all possible diplomatic steps to 
prevent further mass atrocities in Ethiopia; 
and 
(E) maintain close coordination with inter-
national allies and multilateral organiza-
tions regarding efforts to address the con-
flict in Ethiopia and bring attention to the 
conflict in international fora, including the 
United Nations Security Council.

enrollments of eligible veterans and eligible 
persons in each course or program of edu-
cation offered by that educational institu-

(A) of this paragraph regarding a violation of

‘‘(2) The factors set forth in this paragraph 
are the following: 
‘‘(A) That the Secretary’s action brings 
sufficient deterrence for future fraud against

strong enough to send a deterrent message 
to this and other educational institutions 
and owners.

secured an approved third-party auditor to 
verify the educational institution’s, or own-
er’s, advertising and enrollment practices for

taken steps to remove any pressure on its 
enrollment recruiters, including by remov-
ing enrollment quotas and incentives for en-
rollment. 
‘‘(E) That the State approving agency or 
the Secretary acting in the role of the State 
approving agency, has completed a risk- 
based survey and determined the educational 
institution is worthy of serving eligible vet-
erans and eligible persons. 
‘‘(3) Enforcement action under this section 
shall not preclude enforcement action under 
section 3690 of this title. 
‘‘(4) No action may be carried out under 
this subsection with respect to a final deter-
mination by the Under Secretary under sub-
section (g) while such final determination is 
pending review under subsection (i).

the 
Student 
Veteran

viding educational assistance to an indi-
vidual pursuant to subsection (a), the Sec-
retary may— 
(1) continue to pay a monthly housing sti-
pend under chapter 33 of title 38, United 
States Code, during a month the individual

ence allowances under chapters 30, 31, 32, 33,

stitution or enrolled in training at a training 
establishment and is pursuing such program

pends, payments, or subsistence allowances)

assistance provided pursuant to this section

implementation of watershed or greenway 
master 
plans, 
and

risk compensation districts where there is a 
desire to remove or set-back levees pro-

centives that reward developers for greater 
reliance 
on 
low 
impact

treating or bluff stabilization due to in-
creased flooding and disaster impacts.

ING CODE ENFORCEMENT.—A participating en-
tity may use capitalization grants under this

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Bankruptcy 
Administration Improvement Act of 2020’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) Because of the importance of the goal 
that the bankruptcy system is self-funded, at 
no cost to the taxpayer, Congress has closely 
monitored the funding needs of the bank-
ruptcy system, including by requiring peri-
odic reporting by the Attorney General re-
garding the United States Trustee System 
Fund. 
(2) Congress has amended the various 
bankruptcy fees as necessary to ensure that 
the bankruptcy system remains self-sup-
porting, while also fairly allocating the costs 
of the system among those who use the sys-
tem. 
(3) Because the bankruptcy system is 
interconnected, the result has been a system 
of fees, including filing fees, quarterly fees in 
chapter 11 cases, and other fees, that to-
gether fund the courts, judges, United States 
trustees, and chapter 7 case trustees nec-
essary for the bankruptcy system to func-
tion. 
(4) This Act and the amendments made by 
this Act— 
(A) ensure adequate funding of the United 
States trustees, supports the preservation of 
existing bankruptcy judgeships that are ur-
gently needed to handle existing and antici-
pated increases in business and consumer 
caseloads, and provides long-overdue addi-
tional compensation for chapter 7 case trust-
ees whose caseloads include chapter 11 reor-
ganization cases that were converted to 
chapter 7 liquidation cases; and 
(B) confirm the longstanding intention of 
Congress that quarterly fee requirements re-
main consistent across all Federal judicial 
districts. 
(b) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this Act and 
the amendments made by this Act is to fur-
ther the long-standing goal of Congress of 
ensuring that the bankruptcy system is self- 
funded, at no cost to the taxpayer.

INTRODUCTION OF THE FEDERAL 
GIFT SHOP TAX ACT 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 9, 2020 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I 
rise to introduce the Federal Gift Shop Tax 
Act, which would allow state and local govern-
ments to impose a sales tax on purchases at 
gift shops on federal property. These govern-
ments would be able to generate millions of 
dollars in new revenue at a time when they 
are struggling to meet their budgets because 
of 
the 
economic 
crisis 
caused 
by 
the 
coronavirus pandemic. 
When the federal government engages in 
activity that is not inherently governmental, 
such as operating a gift shop, there is no rea-
son to exempt customer purchases from a 
sales tax. The items sold at federal gift shops, 
such as jewelry, apparel, accessories, games, 
books and decor, would be subject to sales 
tax if sold on private property. Customers are 
often unaware of this sales tax exemption 
when shopping at gift shops on federal prop-
erty, so the introduction of a sales tax is un-
likely to have a significant impact on gift shop 
sales. It would, however, create a valuable 
revenue stream for struggling governments. In 
addition, state and local governments often 
provide uncompensated services to federal 
property, such as fire service, and allowing 
them to impose a sales tax on gift shops 
would allow them to recoup some of those 
costs. This bill is of particular importance to 
the District of Columbia, as it is home to a 
number of gift shops on federal property, such 
as at the Smithsonian Institution, the National 
Gallery of Art and the John F. Kennedy Center 
for the Performing Arts. 
State and local governments have taken the 
lead in combating the pandemic, meeting the 
moment with expanded services and support 
even as they lose significant revenue. This bill 
would give these governments an opportunity 
to make up a portion of their budget shortfalls 
by creating this new revenue stream. 
I strongly urge my colleagues to support this 
bill.

RECOGNIZING SOUTH TEXAS COL-
LEGE PRESIDENT DR. SHIRLEY 
A. REED 
HON. HENRY CUELLAR 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 9, 2020 
Mr. CUELLAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor South Texas College Founding Presi-
dent Dr. Shirley Reed. Dr. Reed has retired 
after more than 26 years serving as the found-
ing President of South Texas College. 
I first met Dr. Shirley Reed in the middle of 
a dusty field in Rio Grande City for the 
groundbreaking of South Texas College’s Stan 
County campus. Even though the wind was 
raising the dust and getting into our eyes, both 
of us were excited about the opportunities this 
new campus would bring for students and our 
community. Dr. Reed invited me to speak at 
this groundbreaking ceremony because as 
Chairman of the Education Subcommittee on 
Appropriations in the Texas State Legislature, 
I secured funding for fast-growing colleges 
throughout Texas, including South Texas Col-
lege. Since then, we have been working to-
gether to fund projects that advance access to 
quality education for the people of South 
Texas. 
South Texas College was founded back in 
1993 and Dr. Reed was selected as its found-
ing President. At that time, it was known as 
South Texas Community College and had 
about 1,000 students enrolled. However, 
through her steady leadership it grew into a 
multi-campus college with an enrollment of 
just under 30,000 students. It is also recog-
nized as the only community college in the 
State of Texas to offer 5 baccalaureate de-
grees. This was all accomplished despite the 
considerable doubt and obstacles that she 
faced when she was working towards her vi-
sion for the school. Now, she is a source of 
inspiration and a reminder of what can be ac-
complished through hard work and dedication. 
I want to congratulate Dr. Reed on her ten-
ure at South Texas College. Her passion, hard 
work, and leadership has created a revered 
education institution, driving regional and eco-
nomic prosperity in the region. As we move 
forward, let us take the time to appreciate 
President Reed and all the educators who 
dedicate their lives to preparing the next gen-
eration for their futures. However, in the words 
of President John F. Kennedy, ‘‘As we ex-
press our gratitude, we must never forget that 
the highest appreciation is not to utter words, 
but to live by them.’’ 
Madam Speaker, it is my honor to recognize 
the career and service of Dr. Reed.

TRIBUTE TO DR. VICTOR A. 
TRIANFO 
HON. JIM JORDAN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 9, 2020 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I am hon-
ored to commend to the House the service of 
Victor A. Trianfo, Jr., D.O. Dr. Trianfo is retir-
ing as Chief Medical Officer of Memorial 
Health in Marysville, Ohio, after more than two 
decades with that organization. 
Dr. Trianfo’s time at Memorial Health began 
in 1999. For the last ten years, he has served 
in various administrative roles there, including 
as Vice President of Medical Affairs and Qual-
ity. He took on CMO responsibilities in 2013, 
helping to oversee the medical staff, guide 
case management and home health, and lead 
important philanthropy programs that have al-
lowed the system to grow with the needs of 
the area. 
Dr. Trianfo is widely praised as Memorial 
Health’s biggest advocate, spearheading a 
partnership with The Ohio State University 
Wexner Medical Center to improve the deliv-
ery of cardiac care to Union County residents. 
His work to coordinate coronavirus response 
efforts with the Union County Health Depart-
ment is a model to health care leaders every-
where. 
Dr. Trianfo earned his medical degree at 
Ohio University College of Osteopathic Medi-
cine, having previously earned a nursing de-
gree and working as a travel nurse, a flight 
and trauma nurse, and a prison nurse. He was 
chief resident of family medicine at The Ohio 
State University, where he also served as As-
sistant Professor of Family Medicine and Resi-
dency Director. He and his wife, Susan, are 
the parents of three adult children. 
On behalf of the people of Ohio’s Fourth 
Congressional District, I am proud to join in 
the accolades to Dr. Trianfo for his 43 years 
of fine service to the medical profession. We 
wish him and his family every success as they 
move to a new chapter in their lives.

IN HONOR OF ROD HSIAO 
HON. JACKIE SPEIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 9, 2020 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Rod Hsiao as he leaves the San 
Mateo County Board of Education after 14 
years of service to the public. Rod is an out-
standing public servant and he will be missed 
by those who follow his work on the board. 
Rod Hsiao strongly supports inclusivity. 
While working in Washington, D.C., he co-
founded CAPAL, a 31-year-old nonprofit for 
students interested in public policy. He is the 
founder of nonprofit InPlay which combats the 
loss of educational progress that occurs 
amongst children during the summer break. 
InPlay provides a single point where parents 
can go to sign up children for free or low-cost 
summer education and recreational activities. 
He worked with the U.S. Small Business Ad-
ministration’s Council on Underserved Com-
munities and has served on the boards of var-
ious nonprofits. He was the co-founder of a 
local group encouraging Asian and Pacific Is-
landers to participate in elective office. 
The county board of education hears ap-
peals from parents denied inter-district trans-
fers by their district of residence. These are 
emotional moments when parents are hoping 
to have their children attend a different school. 
Rod asks probing questions to determine if 
there is any legal rational for the transfer to be 
granted. He looks to the best interests of stu-
dents and works hard to balance the interests 
of the home district with the student’s needs. 
Granting a charter to a proposed charter 
school is one of the more fraught activities of 
the county board of education. The issue only 
arises when the district in which the school is 
proposed to be established has denied the ap-
plication. Again, Rod seeks to improve public 
education through many avenues, including 
charter schools. These choices sometimes 
generate friction with one or more vocal 
groups, but he tries to ensure that the under-
served communities of San Mateo County 
have access to the best possible education. 
One example of ensuring access to high 
quality education is the countywide program 
known as The Big Lift. It is an initiative that 
grew out of a group in which Rod participated. 
The goal is to ensure that San Mateo County 
students are proficient in reading by the third 
grade. Rod served on the Peninsula Partner-
ship Leadership Council and worked with its 
successor agency as part of a team to design 
and launch The Big Lift. Although the pan-
demic has created obstacles, the program re-
mains strong. 
Jones Gulch is the beloved outdoor edu-
cation program offered by the San Mateo 
County Office of Education, operating for gen-
erations. It’s been said that, in some in-
stances, students arrive with their grand-
mothers who once went to Jones Gulch back 
when the grandmother was a middle school 
student. The camp is owned by the YMCA 
and operated in cooperation with the County 
Office of Education. In recent years, Rod is 
credited with maintaining the relationship and 
with strengthening the program by finding 
ways to do camp upgrades after decades of 
use. He has pushed hard to build housing at 
the site so that staff can fulfill their duties with-
out having to sometimes sleep on the floor of 
the camp office. 
Rod is a graduate of Oberlin College with a 
BA in Economics, and holds a Masters in Pub-
lic Policy from Harvard. Aside from his 
achievements in education, he has also con-
sulted to global companies and founded or 
worked for nonprofits that promote entrepre-
neurship and inclusivity. 
After nearly a decade and a half in a posi-
tion of educational leadership, Rod will now be 
able to spend more time with his wife, Linda, 
and sons Anthony and Timothy. He has 
burned the midnight oil on many occasions, 
and they will likely welcome him home on a 
more regular schedule. However, I know that 
Rod Hsiao will also remain active in public af-
fairs in San Mateo County. An advocate is re-
lentless by nature whether or not in elective 
office. I expect that Rod will remain engaged 
in creating educational opportunity and in en-
couraging participation by all segments of San 
Mateo County. We thank him for years of ef-
fort dedicated to building an America of which 
we may all be proud.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF MATTHEW J. BUNKER 
HON. BRYAN STEIL 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 9, 2020 
Mr. STEIL. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
remember the life and service of Matthew J. 
Bunker. Matthew grew up in Delavan, Wis-
consin and attended Delavan Christian School 
and Faith Christian School before receiving an 
appointment to the United States Military 
Academy at West Point. 
From an early age, Matthew knew that he 
wanted to serve America by joining the mili-
tary. Matthew’s dedication and talents were 
recognized when my predecessor, Congress-
man Paul Ryan, awarded Matthew an appoint-
ment to attend the United States Military 
Academy. After graduating from West Point, 
Matthew served with the Army’s 1st Cavalry 
as a Recon Scout at Joint Base Lewis- 
McChord in Tacoma, Washington. 
After his honorable service in the Army, 
Matthew pursued his lifelong dream of becom-
ing an explorer. Matthew loved the outdoors 
and adventure. He scaled mountains in the 
Pacific Northwest, hiked, mountain biked, and 
photographed those moments along the way. 
In addition to being an avid outdoorsman, 
Matthew was a man of strong faith and moral 
conviction. Wherever his adventures took him, 
he kept his family and God in mind. His father 
said that Matthew only loved two things above 
the outdoors: his family and God. 
Matthew Bunker passed away Friday, June 
26, 2020 while descending Mount Rainier on 
a backcountry hike and ski descent. He was 
28 years old. He was known for being smart, 
caring, having a great sense of humor, and for 
being a talented photographer, painter, and 
writer. 
My prayers are with his family, especially 
his mother Carolyn and his father Joe, who is 
a member of the First Congressional District’s 
Service Academy Nomination Board. May we 
remember Matthew and his service to our 
country and to others. May his adventurous 
spirit, strong faith, and moral conviction be an 
inspiration to us all.

RECOGNIZING WARREN G. 
GRAMMER OF POMONA, ILLINOIS 
HON. MIKE BOST 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 9, 2020 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize Warren G. Grammer of Pomona, Illi-
nois, in celebration of his upcoming 100th 
birthday. A World War II veteran and longtime 
public servant, Warren is a true American pa-
triot and a role model to many Illinoisans. 
Warren was born on December 22, 1920. In 
1943, Warren was drafted into the U.S. Army 
and served in the 45th Infantry as a rifle com-
bat infantryman and later as a military police-
man. During his service, he took part in eight 
different battles and was awarded the Silver 
Battle Star and the Bronze Battle Star. His 
proudest accomplishment, however, was par-
ticipating in his division’s liberation of the con-
centration camp in Dachau, Germany. When 
he was honorably discharged in September 
1945, Warren returned home to work for the Il-
linois State Police as a trooper before working 
as an officer in a juvenile detention center. 
Retiring as a Jackson County deputy, Warren 
left a legacy of public service and public safe-
ty. 
With a dedication to community and country, 
Warren is a truly part of America’s Greatest 
Generation. His longevity is worthy of recogni-
tion, but the work he accomplished in those 
years is even more important. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in honoring 
Warren Grammer for his incredible milestone. 
On behalf of Southern Illinois, happy birthday.

Mr. CUELLAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the career and service of United 
Independent School District Superintendent 
Roberto J. Santos. Mr. Santos will retire after 
more than 38 years serving the United Inde-
pendent School District. 
Mr. Santos is an individual who committed 
his life and career to the betterment of his 
community. Throughout his career in the field 
of education, he showed a steadfast dedica-
tion to every student he served. He also 
showed strong leadership in how he managed

one of the largest school districts in the State 
of Texas. During his tenure as Superintendent, 
United ISD earned an ‘‘A’’ rating by the Texas 
Education Agency two years in a row. In addi-
tion, and more importantly, Mr. Santos earned 
the respect and trust of his colleagues and the 
many people he helped during his tenure. 
Mr. Santos’s success as superintendent un-
doubtedly comes from the experience he 
gained serving in various roles for United ISD, 
including: Associate Superintendent for Stu-
dent 
Support 
Services, 
Assistant 
Super-
intendent for Support Services, Director for 
Human Resources, and Administrative Assist-
ant to the Superintendent. The skills he ac-
quired through these different positions en-
abled him to have the tools he needed for 
when he eventually became superintendent in 
2005. 
Over the course of his many years in public 
education, Mr. Santos attained numerous 
awards and recognitions. He is the recipient of 
the ‘‘Unsung Heroes Award’’ by the Laredo 
Next Generation Rotary Club; Future of Texas 
Award; Laredo Diploma Plus Foundation 
Leadership 
Award; 
Imaginarium 
‘‘Image 
Award’’; Latin American International Hall of 
Fame; Border Olympics Honorary Director; 
Martin High School Tiger Legend; LULAC 
Council No. 12 Tejano Achiever; Gateway to 
Mexico All-Sports Clinic Hall of Honor; Amer-
ican Cancer Society Relay for Life Honorary 
Chairman and March of Dimes Honorary 
Chairman. 
I want to congratulate Mr. Santos on his 
service to the United Independent School Dis-
trict. His compassion, hard work, and leader-
ship has molded an essential institution for the 
community, driving local economic and aca-
demic prosperity in Laredo. As we move for-
ward, let us take the time to appreciate Mr. 
Santos and all the educators who dedicate 
their lives to preparing the next generation for 
becoming valuable members of society. How-
ever, in the words of President John F. Ken-
nedy, ‘‘As we express our gratitude, we must 
never forget that the highest appreciation is 
not to utter words, but to live by them.’’ 
Madam Speaker, it is my honor to recognize 
the career and service of Superintendent Ro-
berto J. Santos.

ROSCOE D. CUNNINGHAM 
HON. JOHN SHIMKUS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 9, 2020 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, I rise be-
fore you today to remember Roscoe D. 
Cunningham—a 
remarkably 
accomplished 
man who made an unforgettable impact in 
Lawrence County, Illinois in his 97 years. 
Roscoe was born on September 15, 1923 to 
Roscoe and Bessie Cooper Cunningham. He 
graduated from Sumner High School in 1941, 
a place which instilled his love of learning and 
ability to quote poetry. He, then, attended the 
University of Illinois, but put a halt on his de-
gree to serve in World War II European Oper-
ations. He proudly served in the United States 
Army, Rainbow Division 4th Operations as a 
forward Observer with the artillery division 
where he was involved with the aeronautical 
observation of the dropping of bombs on 
enemy locations. In 1946, Roscoe was honor-
ably discharged from active duty with the rank 
of 1st Lieutenant. 
Returning to U of I, Roscoe earned a JD 
from the School of Law and was admitted to 
the Illinois Bar in 1948. He practiced law in 
Lawrence County for over 72 years. Roscoe 
proved to be a strong community leader, dedi-
cating his life to bettering his community in 
Lawrence County. He was considered one of 
the county’s most vocal advocates and, in 
2018, was awarded the Key to the City by 
Lawrenceville. He also participated extensively 
in state and national politics, serving as the 
States Attorney for four terms, the Illinois 
State Legislature for four terms, and Delegate 
to the Republican National Convention for 
three sessions. As an lllinois State Represent-
ative for the 54th District, Roscoe also proved 
to be a vocal advocate for his district. It is 
noted that he spoke eloquently from the 
House Floor and he could capture a room’s 
attention. Roscoe was also involved in more 
than 20 election campaigns throughout the 
years and he enjoyed meeting with and help-
ing constituents. 
Roscoe 
married 
Katheryn 
Suzanne 
Cunningham on May 1, 1954. They shared 64 
years of marriage and raised five children. 
Roscoe was frequently seen riding bikes with 
his children and/or grandchildren. At 87, he 
continued to bike from Sumner to Olney in 
support of the Special Olympics. 
Striving to better his community, Roscoe 
prioritized community service. He was espe-
cially proud of establishing and advancing the 
Cunningham’s Golden Age Club No. 1. His fa-
vorite Bible verse was Luke 9:62 which reads, 
‘‘No one, having put his hand to the plow, and 
looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.’’ 
These words inspired Roscoe to re-establish 
the hometown newspaper in his later years. 
The sections he created have led to The Sum-
ner Press’s legacy as the longest running, lo-
cally owned newspaper in Southern Illinois. 
Roscoe was an active member at First Chris-
tian Church for 66 years. He recognized the 
importance of Sunday School and spent many 
years teaching Sunday School to participate in 
the education of young students in their faith. 
He was a member of many community organi-
zations, including the Lawrence County Shrine 
Club, Lawrence County Republicans, and a 
lifetime member of the V.F.W. Post 2244, to 
name but a few among his expansive list of 
which he was a member. 
Madam Speaker, I take this time to recog-
nize a true agent of change in Lawrence 
County. Lawrence County will surely miss him, 
but they are left with his incomparable legacy.

INTRODUCTION OF THE OUR 
HOMES OUR VOTES ACT 
HON. JESU´S G. ‘‘CHUY’’ GARCI´A 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 9, 2020 
Mr. GARCI´A of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to introduce the Our Homes Our 
Votes Act along with my colleague from Penn-
sylvania, Mary Gay Scanlon. This bill will help 
close the voter turnout gap between rich and 
poor by making it easier for eligible tenants in 
federally subsidized housing to register to 
vote. 
People have fought and died for the right to 
vote in this country, but many still face barriers 
to voting. Tenants in federally subsidized 
housing already have their residence and 
identity verified by public agencies, and this 
bill will allow them to register to vote as they 
sign their lease without duplicating information 
or finding additional paperwork to fill out. 
The best way to confront this country’s his-
tory of voter suppression is to remove barriers 
to voting that exist today. Eligible voters in 
working class districts like mine vote at lower 
rates than wealthier voters, and that discrep-
ancy undermines our democracy. This bill is a 
step toward fixing that, and I urge this body to 
advance it.

ALS DISABILITY INSURANCE 
ACCESS ACT OF 2019 
SPEECH OF 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 8, 2020 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise in sup-
port of S. 578, the ALS Disability Insurance 
Access Act. I’m proud to be a cosponsor of 
this important legislation that enjoys over-
whelming bipartisan support in the Congress. 
This bill ends the five-month waiting period 
for people with ALS to access Social Security 
Disability. For some in the country, a five- 
month wait would not be a great burden, but 
for those with ALS, which is fatal, many die 
waiting, never receiving the benefits they 
earned by paying into Social Security. 
ALS is an aggressive neurodegenerative 
disease that robs people of their muscle 
movement, their employment, and their lives in 
a brief time following diagnosis. By ending the 
harmful waiting period, this bill will allow Amer-
icans who face an ALS diagnosis to imme-
diately receive the Social Security benefits 
they’ve earned and deserve. 
I salute my friend and colleague, Senator 
SHELDON WHITEHOUSE for authoring this impor-
tant legislation and I urge my colleagues to 
vote for this bill and for the President to imme-
diately sign it into law.

A lifelong resident of Leesburg Township, 
Charles Hall has been a county commissioner

dent of the Board. He studied business at 
Northern Illinois University and Butler Univer-
sity, later joining his brother in machinery 
sales in Marysville. Charles and his wife of 
more than fifty years, Peggy, are the parents 
of three, the grandparents of nine, and the 
great-grandparents of two. They are members 
of Richwood United Methodist Church.

CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 6395, 
WILLIAM M. (MAC) THORNBERRY 
NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZA-
TION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2021 
SPEECH OF 
HON. BARBARA LEE 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 8, 2020 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
opposition to the Conference Report on H.R. 
6395, the National Defense Authorization Act 
for Fiscal Year 2021. 
I’d like to thank my colleague, Chairman 
ADAM SMITH, for his consistent efforts to in-
clude key House provisions in this year’s 
NDAA conference report. I was very pleased 
that the provisions which the Congressional 
Black Caucus led that calls for the renaming 
of Confederate military bases made it into the 
final bill. There is a dangerous and hurtful leg-
acy of white supremacy in this country, and 
there is no place for the memorialization of the 
historical figures that perpetuated it, especially 
on our military bases. I’m pleased that the 
CBC and House Democrats successfully kept 
this important provision in the final text of the 
bill. 
However, the FY 21 NDAA continues our 
legacy of wasteful military spending and in-
vesting in war rather than peace. This legisla-
tion provides $732 billion in discretionary 
spending, nearly the exact same number as 
last year’s number, which was the largest 
number ever authorized. 
Especially as we fight back a catastrophic 
pandemic and public health crisis, Congress 
should not be rewarding the Pentagon with a 
massive spending increase. I cannot support a 
bill that funds the Pentagon at a level far be-
yond what is necessary for our national de-
fense, turning our backs on the serious human 
need we face today. 
For these reasons, I am unable to support 
the NDAA conference report and will vote no. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF SHAWN 
FARRITOR 
HON. ADRIAN SMITH 
OF NEBRASKA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 9, 2020 
Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam Speaker, 
today I rise to pay tribute to the life of Shawn 
Farritor. Shawn was born in June 1967 with a 
birth defect called transposition of the great ar-
teries, meaning the two main arteries leaving 
his heart were reversed. Shawn overcame 
these challenges to become an attorney and 
published author, and it inspired him to spend 
his life helping others. Shawn received a dou-
ble lung and heart transplant in December 
2019 and spent a year fighting to recover be-
fore leaving us in September 2020. He was 
born and raised in Ravenna, Nebraska, and 
spent his professional career in Grand Island 
and Hastings. 
Spending his professional career providing 
legal support to those who needed it most, 
Shawn made a big effort to learn the language 
and culture of those he served and was 
known as someone who ‘‘would actually lis-
ten.’’ He was a literacy council volunteer, 
United Way professional partner, and served 
on the Friendship House board of directors as 
Vice President. He was also an active sup-
porter of survivors of the transposition proce-
dure he underwent. For his contributions to 
communities in the Third District, Shawn is an 
honorable mention recipient of the 2020 Inno-
vation and Adaptation Recognition. 
Shawn is missed by all especially his wife, 
stepson, and family. He was beloved by all for 
his big heart and passion for helping others. 
We are grateful for Shawn and proud of every-
thing he has done for many Nebraskans.

RECOGNIZING UNIVERSAL CITY 
POLICE CHIEF GARY SPEER 
HON. HENRY CUELLAR 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 9, 2020 
Mr. CUELLAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the career and service of Universal 
City Police Chief Gary Speer. Chief Speer has 
retired after 40 years in law enforcement and 
36 years of service with the Universal City Po-
lice Department. 
Chief Speer is an individual who consist-
ently displayed the utmost commitment to his 
community. He began his career in law en-
forcement in 1981 as a reserve officer for 
Bexar County Precinct 3. He eventually served 
in a few different departments before joining 
the Universal City Police Department as a pa-
trolman in 1984. Over time he steadily rose 
through the ranks. He achieved the rank of 
Sergeant in 1989, Lieutenant in 1997, Assist-
ant Chief in 2001, and soon earned the posi-
tion of Chief in 2007. During this time, he was 
also honored with several awards including 
Police Officer of the Year by the Lions Club 
and Police Officer of the Year for the State of 
Texas by the American Legion. 
I have worked with Chief Speer over the 
years and witnessed first-hand the essential 
work he has done to keep his community safe. 
He cared deeply about the people he served 
and consistently showed what it means to put 
the well-being of others first. The dedication 
that he has shown to us all should be a con-
stant reminder of how we should be in our 
daily lives. This devotion to others is also con-
sistent with the history of his family. Chief 
Speer’s Grandfather, father, and brother all 
served their communities as members of law 
enforcement. 
In addition to the hard work and dedication 
he showed as a member of the law enforce-
ment community, he is also an active member 
of his community. He is a member of Shriners 
International, the San Antonio Livestock Expo-
sition and its Scramble Committee, the Texas 
Police Association, and the Texas Police 
Chiefs Association. But most importantly, he is 
a devoted father and grandfather. 
As we move forward, let us take the time to 
appreciate the service of heroes like Chief 
Speer and all the individuals who risk their 
lives each day to keep us safe. However, in 
the words of President John F. Kennedy, ‘‘As 
we express our gratitude, we must never for-
get that the highest appreciation is not to utter 
words, but to live by them.’’ 
Madam Speaker, it is my honor to recognize 
the career and service of Chief Speer.

HBCU PROPELLING AGENCY RELA-
TIONSHIPS 
TOWARDS 
A 
NEW 
ERA OF RESULTS FOR STUDENT 
ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 7, 2020 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a 
member 
of 
the 
bipartisan 
Congressional 
HBCU Caucus and an original co-sponsor, I 
rise in support of the bipartisan S. 461, the 
‘‘HBCU Propelling Agency Relationships To-
wards a New Era of Results for Students Act’’ 
(HBCU PARTNERS Act), which will strengthen 
partnerships between federal agencies and 
the country’s more than 100 Historically Black 
Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). 
The HBCU PARTNERS Act requires federal 
agencies with relevant grants and programs to 
undertake annual planning and coordinate 
their efforts to support and expand HBCU par-
ticipation in those programs. 
The bill strengthens the rigor and trans-
parency requirements of existing law by re-
quiring that agencies track their progress to-
ward past goals and share their plans with 
Congress. 
In addition, it codifies the White House 
Board of Advisors on HBCUs, ensuring an on-
going avenue for the institutions’ priorities and 
policy concerns to be raised. 
As a strong proponent of the preservation of 
our nation’s HBCU’s and MSI’s, I support this 
bill because our students deserve to receive 
an outstanding education and have access to 
equal resources, regardless of the institution 
they choose to attend. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud that one of the 
greatest HBCUs in the country, Texas South-
ern University, is located in my congressional 
district. 
Texas Southern University has a rich history

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E1123 
December 9, 2020 
Like most of my HBCU Caucus colleagues, 
I have worked closely with my local HBCU to 
provide funding and resources needed to en-
able them to fulfill their mission of educating 
the next generation of social engineers and 
conducting research programs addressing 
issues of major concern to the African Amer-
ican community. 
As Chair of the Homeland Security Sub-
committee on Transportation Security and In-
frastructure Protection in the 111th Congress, 
I authored the legislation to’ establish a Trans-
portation Security Center of Excellence at TSU 
and worked to help TSU secure $1.2 million in 
funding over four years from the Department 
of Homeland Security for this Center of Excel-
lence. 
One of my proudest accomplishments as a 
member of Congress is my success in working 
with federal officials in the Clinton Administra-
tion to settle the lawsuit against TSU that had 
been pending for more than 23 years. 
I was proud to spearhead the initiative that 
brought more than $13 million in financial aid 
relief for the students and campus of Texas 
Southern University. 
I also worked with TSU administrators to ini-
tiate digital archive projects to preserve the 
records of two of its most distinguished alum-
ni, the legendary Barbara Jordan and Mickey 
Leland, both of whom preceded me as the 
Member of Congress for the Eighteenth Con-
gressional District ofTexas, 
I was pleased to facilitate a partnership be-
tween Comcast and TSU’s School of Commu-
nication to provide scholarships and intern-
ships to TSU students and in-kind marketing 
services to the university. 
I also worked to secure funding needed to 
establish the Center for Transportation, Train-
ing and Research in the TSU College of 
Science, Engineering, and Technology. 
Mr. Speaker, HBCU’s have played a critical 
role in American history. 
As the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. stat-
ed: ‘‘The function of education is to teach one 
to think intensively and to think critically. Intel-
ligence plus character—that is the goal of true 
education.’’’ 
HBCUs do not just educate—HBCUs have 
and will continue to fill an important role in 
education opportunity and engagement for mil-
lions of young people from diverse back-
grounds. 
As leaders of this country, the success and 
expansion of HBCUs and minority-serving in-
stitutions falls on our shoulders and we must 
act swiftly to ensure that these institutions are 
protected. 
In an effort to maintain the legacy and edu-
cational quality of our I historically Black col-
leges and universities and minority-serving in-
stitutions, we must act urgently to ensure the 
proper relationships are established between 
all of these institutions and the Department of 
Homeland Security. 
I ask all members to join me in voting for S. 
461, the ‘‘HBCU Propelling Agency Relation-
ships Towards a New Era of Results for Stu-
dents Act.’’ 
IN HONOR OF AZALEA CHARITIES, 
INCORPORATED 
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 9, 2020 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Azalea Charities Incorporated, 
an all volunteer charitable organization located 
in the First District with a dual mission of pro-
viding support to Aid to Wounded Warriors 
and youth and special need projects. Over the 
last 22 years Azalea Charities Inc., has pro-
vided over 5 million dollars of support to these 
two mission areas, not only here in the First 
District, but across the nation as well as inter-
nationally. The motto of Azalea Charities is 
Working Together-Giving Together. 
Azalea Charities’ commitment to the ideals 
that America stands for, their good citizenship, 
self-sacrifice and longevity of service are a 
testament to all that is best about our country. 
From raising funds by partnering with local 
corporations and businesses to participating in 
events such as the Marine Corps Marathon 
and conducting their hallmark Pro Am Azalea 
Classic Invitational golf tournament, Azalea 
Charities dedication to service is to be com-
mended. 
After two decades, Azalea Charities Inc. is 
bringing their charitable era to an end. 
Therefore, Madam Speaker, I ask that you 
rise with me in honoring the men and women 
of Azalea Charities for their service to commu-
nity over these past 22 years of dedicated 
selfless service to the citizens of our great 
country.

IN HONOR OF RICH GARBARINO 
HON. JACKIE SPEIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 9, 2020 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize my dear friend and colleague 
Rich Garbarino: retiring from the city council of 
South San Francisco after 18 years and after 
a total of 38 years of service to the people of 
South San Francisco. Rich has been a steady 
voice of progress and leadership in the city. 
Councilmember Garbarino sat on the parks 
commission for 18 years which resulted in 
new parks being developed throughout the city 
including Summit, Orange and Cypress parks 
that were constructed or thoroughly renovated. 
Initial work on Centennial Way, a lengthy 
trail built to celebrate the 100th anniversary of 
the city, began while Rich was a commis-
sioner. Construction concluded years later 
after he joined the council. He was an enthusi-
astic advocate over all these years. Trail con-
struction costs were entirely defrayed through 
donations. 
When Rich began in public service, the east 
side of the city consisted of giant, abandoned 
steel mills worthy of any devastated war zone. 
As he completes his service, South San Fran-
cisco has become the biotechnology capital of 
the world. The steel mills were long ago swept 
aside to be replaced by Genentech’s sprawl-
ing campuses of billions of dollars of invest-
ment and those of many other companies. 
One is presently researching the aging proc-
ess with the hope of defeating it, while another 
is tackling sickle cell anemia. A third grows 
specialized mosquitoes aimed at stopping the 
spread of Dengue fever. A fourth is farming in-
side a warehouse using vertical fields, robots 
and artificial intelligence to produce vegetables 
that are so tasty they fly off the shelves at su-
permarkets. Rich Garbarino and his col-
leagues encouraged tens of billions of dollars 
in investment in the east side through their 
welcoming messages to the biotechnology in-
dustry. This was transformational. 
During his time in office, Rich worked hard 
in our State Capitol to represent other cities 
through the League of California Cities. He ex-
plained the need for local control over zoning 
and has long supported housing along the 
transit corridors of South San Francisco. Hun-
dreds of apartments and condominiums have 
been created in just the past few years, most 
located along the rail and bus lines that lace 
South San Francisco. 
He was a big supporter of Measure W, a 1⁄2 
cent sales tax approved by voters. As these 
industries and housing spring up in South San 
Francisco, the need for more police and a new 
municipal center featuring a police station and 
library became apparent. It’s paid for in part 
by Measure W. 
Over just the past 20 years, Rich Garbarino 
took on nearly 40 different community service 
commitments including serving on the public 
safety policy committee, President of the 
League of California Cities, a member of ad 
hoc committees on gun control and gang vio-
lence, president of his neighborhood home-
owner’s association, and serving as an advisor 
to the president of San Francisco State Uni-
versity. Some respond to a call for volunteers 
as if a recent shoulder separation prevented 
them from raising their hand. Rich has per-
sistent muscle spasms that compel his hand 
to fly upward. 
Rich and his wife Elaine have three chil-
dren, Gina, Rich Jr. and Andrea, and eight 
grandchildren. He is a quintessential family 
man, a great father and grandfather. This is 
also how he views his city. In Rich’s eyes, 
every resident of South San Francisco is part 
of a big family, and their needs are his pas-
sion. 
Some men see a city and mourn what has 
passed. Rich Garbarino sees his city and won-
ders about all that will someday come to pass. 
He’s proud that the cure to cancer will likely 
be discovered in South San Francisco. He 
marvels that housing now being built is just 
the start of what’s planned. He knows the 
downtown is on the crux of a revival and that 
residents will grow safer in the future as they 
work towards their common good. 
Madam Speaker, while the city’s residents 
will no longer have Rich Garbarino to watch 
over their best interests, they have the path 
that he helped lay down to carry them into the 
future. Godspeed to the pathbreakers, and to 
their leader in chief, Rich Garbarino, a man 
who devoted his years in office to create a to-
morrow for all.

HON. SCOTT PERRY 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 9, 2020 
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor and congratulate the outstanding Air-
men of the 193rd Special Operations Wing, 
Pennsylvania Air National Guard, for earning 
the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award—for the 
19th time. This highly prestigious award recog-
nizes the Wing’s exceptionally meritorious 
service from October 1, 2017 through Sep-
tember 30, 2019. 
During this period, this one-of-a-kind unit 
deployed more than 400 Service Members 
globally across 20 nations, filling numerous 
Reserve Component Posture taskings and 
missions. The specialized EC–130J Com-
mando Solo aircraft flew 115 combat missions 
and executed 1,009 broadcast hours, meeting 
all Central Command requirements while 
achieving an overall 1,463 sorties and 3,924 
flight hours. 
During the same period, the Wing also dis-
tinguished itself by deploying its world-class 
Airmen from their Engineering Installation, Red 
Horse, Security Forces, Air Operations Center, 
Communications, Air Support Operations and 
Medical units who expertly supported over-
seas contingency missions. Collectively, the 
Wing supported counter-terrorism/counter-nar-
cotics operations as well as named Operations 
Inherent Resolve, Freedom’s Sentinel, Spartan 
Shield, Atlantic Resolve, and Resolute Sup-
port, altogether advancing our military’s effec-
tiveness on the battlefield while protecting our 
Nation and our American way of life. 
The Airmen of the 193rd Special Operations 
Wing consistently demonstrate excellence in 
their training and operations across our Nation 
and around the world. On behalf of the 10th 
Congressional District of Pennsylvania, we’re 
honored to be the home of such a distin-
guished unit, and I commend the Wing for 
earning the Air Force Outstanding Unit 
Award—again. I extend my heartfelt thanks to 
them for their hard work, tireless dedication 
and steadfast service to the Commonwealth of

RECOGNIZING THE CAREER AND 
SERVICE OF MARIO R. JORGE, 
P.E., SAN ANTONIO DISTRICT EN-
GINEER 
HON. HENRY CUELLAR 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 9, 2020 
Mr. CUELLAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the career of Mr. Mario R. Jorge. Mr. 
Jorge is retiring after serving the Texas De-
partment of Transportation for more than 36 
years. 
Mr. Jorge, at the age of 12, immigrated with 
his family from Cuba to the United States in 
1974. While it was a challenging process for 
him and his family, they knew they were on 
the right path for a better future. Among the 
many difficulties he personally faced, Mr. 
Jorge started his education in the 7th grade 
without being able to speak a word of English. 
However, with hard work and diligence he was 
able to overcome this obstacle. He also found 
that he was particularly talented in the field of 
mathematics. Utilizing his skill in mathematics, 
Mr. Jorge went on to earn a bachelor’s degree 
in civil engineering from the University of 
Texas as well as a professional engineer’s li-
cense. 
Mr. Jorge began his career with TxDOT as 
a member of the survey crew and as a con-
struction inspector for the Pharr District in 
1983. In 1984, he was employed at the Dallas 
District where he worked in construction in-
spection and roadway design. He then trans-
ferred to the Pharr District in 1985 where he 
worked for several years and received the 
TxDOT Design Award for the US 83/281 inter-
change project in Pharr, before being pro-
moted to Area Engineer in 1993. However, 
through his continued hard work he was even-
tually promoted to District Engineer for the 
Pharr District in 2002. It was under his leader-
ship and guidance that the district completed 
the expansion and designation of over 100 
miles of interstate system on I–2 and US 69, 
as well as several international projects. None-
theless, after many years of service with the 
Pharr District, he soon became the District En-
gineer for the San Antonio District in 2013. In 
San Antonio, Mr. Jorge led the district with an 
even larger project delivery portfolio which in-
cluded expansions on US 281, I–10 West and 
East, 1–35 NEX, and LP 1604 North and 
South, an energy sector project delivery pro-
gram, and countless other initiatives with local 
partners and stakeholders. 
I have worked with Mr. Jorge for many 
years and witnessed first-hand his dedication 
to his work. A trait that he learned from his 
parents, who risked their lives and worked 
hard to realize the American dream. I also 
want to recognize him for being a strong lead-
er who made sure to always treat his col-
leagues with respect and care. A characteristic 
that allowed him to be successful in all of his 
endeavors. 
Madam Speaker, I congratulate Mr. Jorge 
on an outstanding career and wish him all the 
best in his next chapter of life. I also wish the 
best to his wife, Elsa, as well as his three 
sons and the rest of his family.

Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
congratulate the Leadership Council of South-
western Illinois in receiving the prestigious Ab-
ilene Trophy for its support of the men and 
women who serve at Southern Illinois’ Scott 
Air Force Base. 
Established in 1999, the Abilene Trophy is 
awarded every year in recognition of the best 
community support for an Air Force Base. This 
year, the Leadership Council of Southwestern 
Illinois was selected in part because of the 
growing Scott Patriot Program, which allows 
servicemembers to identify businesses, com-
munities, and organizations that are des-
ignated as ‘‘military friendly.’’ The partnership 
between the Leadership Council and Scott Air 
Force Base in the STEM and cybersecurity 
outreach 
programs 
provides 
local 
servicemembers and the surrounding commu-
nity the opportunity to work together and ener-
gize the regional economy. 
The Leadership Council Southwestern Illi-
nois and Scott Air Force Base play a vital role 
in our nation’s military readiness. As South-
western Illinois’ largest employer, Scott Air 
Force Base is a nationally-respected military 
instillation. We couldn’t be happier to have or-
ganizations like the Leadership Council sup-
porting their mission. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in honoring 
the Leadership Council Southwestern Illinois 
and Scott Air Force Base for this incredible 
partnership. On behalf of Illinois’ 12th Con-
gressional District, congratulations!

HONORING THE LIFE OF CAROL 
CONNOLLY, POET LAUREATE OF 
SAINT PAUL, MINNESOTA 
HON. BETTY McCOLLUM 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 9, 2020 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
pay tribute to the life of an extraordinary 
woman, Carol Connolly, Poet Laureate of 
Saint Paul, Minnesota. Carol passed away on 
November 23rd at the age of 85. 
Carol lived her entire life to the fullest in her 
beloved hometown of Saint Paul, and there 
was no greater joy than her family, raising 7 
children and nurturing 15 grandchildren and 
great grandchildren. In addition to being the 
heart of a large, loving family, she was active 
as a catalyst, connector and collaborator for 
her dynamic community. One of her dear 
friends aptly observed that ‘‘all roads to and 
from Saint Paul lead through Carol Connolly.’’ 
Inspired by the peace and civil rights move-
ments, she was busy throughout her life vol-
unteering for countless organizations, causes 
and candidates, not to mention running for po-
litical office herself. She truly became the 
change for good that she wanted to see in the 
world. 
Her artistic side shined just as bright, writing 
and publishing countless poems, plays and 
columns—and mentoring new writers along 
the way. At the 2006 ceremony where she 
was named Poet Laureate, she read one of 
her poems that captures the essence of this 
great American city where ‘‘neighborhoods are 
the foundation of our freedom, ‘‘ a place 
where, regardless of background, neighbors 
care for neighbors and the greatest strength is 
found in coming together: ‘‘A storm thunders 
along the river as it roams through the city, 
home to some of us for 2,000 years. Home to 
others of us who left our native lands to es-
cape famine, or war, or worse, and we are all 
immigrants. ‘‘ 
Carol’s boundless generosity and care for 
others touched the lives of so many—from her 
family and friends to strangers. Through her 
poetry, humor, advocacy and contagious en-
thusiasm and support for the arts and art mak-
ers in our community, she was determined to 
make the world a better place, and she did. 
Above all, she was a devoted and beloved 
mother and grandmother, sister and aunt. It 
was always clear how deeply she valued the 
lives of people around her. 
It was an honor to call Carol a friend and a 
neighbor for many years. Her selfless encour-
agement of others, especially of writers and 
women running for office, continues to inspire 
me and so many others throughout our com-
munity. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in cele-
brating the outstanding life of Carol Connolly, 
Poet Laureate of Saint Paul, Minnesota. 
CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 6395, 
WILLIAM M. (MAC) THORNBERRY 
NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZA-
TION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2021 
SPEECH OF 
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 8, 2020 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ad-
dress section 1242 of William M. (Mac) Thorn-
berry National Defense Authorization Act 
(NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2021, Clarification and 
Expansion of Sanctions relating to Construc-
tion of Nord Stream 2 or TurkStream Projects. 
On July 20th of this year during House con-
sideration of this bill, I rose in opposition to the 
amendment that added this provision to the 
NDAA, which targeted the Nord Stream 2 
project with additional sanctions. I was con-
cerned that these sanctions would target the 
wrong entities. Rather than deterring Russia 
and Putin, I was worried that it would be used 
to target European or American companies. 
Fortunately, through the conference proc-
ess, in which I was a conferee as Chairman 
of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, we 
were able to improve on the language that 
passed the initial House and Senate bills. The 
conferees decided to include an exception for 
certain governments and governmental enti-
ties. This change was an important and appro-
priate fix to ensure our allies and partners 
would not be targeted by sanctions under this 
provision. 
As a conferee on this provision, I want to 
make clear that the term ‘‘government’’ means 
any level of government in those countries, in-
cluding local and municipal governmental enti-
ties or authorities, and the term ‘‘business en-
terprise’’ does not include any entity that per-
forms any public functions or otherwise has 
any public responsibilities. 
I also want to commend my fellow con-
ferees for agreeing to expand and include new 
language requiring, before the imposition of 
any sanctions pursuant to this provision, con-
sultations by the Secretary of State with the 
governments of Norway, Switzerland, the 
United Kingdom, and member countries of the 
European Union. It is imperative that these 
consultations are true exchanges of views with 
the governments described, including EU 
member countries and institutions, conducted 
well before any sanctions would be imposed. 
The consultations must be deliberative and 
meaningful, and should take place at the For-
eign Minister level or higher. Simple notifica-
tion of a determination to proceed with the im-
position of sanctions is not a consultation and 
would not fulfil the requirements of section 
1242. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to express my ap-
preciation to my House and Senate colleagues 
for working with me to make sure this ex-
tremely difficult issue is handled with preci-
sion. In this revised provision, I think we got 
much closer to that goal. 
BENEFICIARY ENROLLMENT NOTI-
FICATION 
AND 
ELIGIBILITY 
SIMPLICATION ACT OF 2020 
SPEECH OF 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 8, 2020 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise in sup-
port of H.R. 2477, BENES Act of 2020, which 
has been amended to include H.R. 5534, the 
Comprehensive 
Immunosuppressive 
Drug 
Coverage for Kidney Transplant Patients Act. 
I advanced both bipartisan bills through my 
Health Subcommittee and I’m proud to support 
them on the Floor today. 
The BENES Act introduced updates the Part 
B enrollment process for the first time in 50 
years. It requires Medicare to notify people 
nearing eligibility about their rights and re-
sponsibilities, protecting beneficiaries from a 
lifetime of financial penalties for failure to en-
roll promptly. 
While most beneficiaries are still automati-
cally enrolled in Medicare Parts A and B at 
age 65 because they’re receiving Social Secu-
rity benefits, a growing number of Americans 
are not. 
In 2016, only 60 percent of Medicare-eligible 
65-year-olds were taking Social Security, com-
pared to 92 percent in 2002. 
The federal government provides virtually no 
notification to people who are nearing Medi-
care eligibility about their responsibilities, in-
cluding if they must actively enroll. 
If you do not enroll in Part B at age 65, then 
you are required to pay a Part B Late Enroll-
ment Penalty that accrues at 10 percent of the 
current Part B premium for every year a per-
son should have been—but was not—enrolled 
in Part B. 
The BENES Act requires the federal govern-
ment to notify people nearing Medicare eligi-
bility about their rights and responsibilities. 
The BENES Act also allows coverage to 
begin more quickly post-enrollment, with Medi-
care coverage beginning on the first of the 
month or the first of the following month when 
a person enrolls. 
The BENES Act has been championed by 
the Medicare Rights Center and over 70 other 
organizations dedicated to helping Medicare 
beneficiaries. I’m proud that the House is fi-
nally taking this much needed vote and I look 
forward to this important bill being passed by 
the Senate and signed into law. 
As part of this bill, the House will also pass 
the Comprehensive Immunosuppressive Drug 
Coverage for Kidney Transplant Patients Act, 
championed by Representatives KIND
and 
BURGESS for many years. I’m proud to be an 
original sponsor of this commonsense policy 
that will save money and, more importantly, 
lives. 
Today, while Medicare covers a lifetime of 
dialysis, but kidney transplant recipients cur-
rently lose their Medicare coverage 36 months 
after transplant. Without Medicare coverage 
for needed immunosuppressive drugs, trans-
plant patients risk losing their new kidney. This 
legislation closes that gap by continuing cov-
erage for kidney transplant recipients which a 
nonpartisan HHS analysis found would save 
375 kidney transplants each year. 
Like the BENES Act, advocates have been 
fighting for this immunosuppressive coverage

HONORING MAURICE R. ‘‘HANK’’ 
GREENBERG 
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 9, 2020 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, it is incum-
bent upon us to acknowledge patriots who 
have fought to secure and strengthen the 
cherished liberties that every American citizen 
holds dear. Maurice R. ‘Hank’ Greenberg is 
one of those patriots who has devoted his life 
to embracing and advancing the American 
spirit. 
Hank’s father died when Hank was six years 
old. The family moved to upstate New York to 
a dairy farm where a very long and back 
breaking day’s work was a common reality. 
Like so many others, he and his family were 
barely scraping by. Soon, America was at war. 
At 17, Hank left high school, enlisted in the 
Army and was attached to the 5th Ranger Bat-
talion which stormed the beaches of Nor-
mandy. Later, Hank was a member of the 
forces that liberated the concentration camp at 
Dachau. Hank remained in the U.S. Army Re-
serves as a first Lieutenant. When the Korean 
War broke out, Hank returned to service, ris-
ing to the rank of Captain. For his extraor-
dinary military service and sacrifice in the Eu-
ropean Theater and Korea, Hank was award-
ed the Bronze Star and the Award for Meri-
torious Unit Commendation. He was also be-
stowed with the prestigious Commandeur of 
the French Ordre National de la Legion 
d’Honneur. 
Between his years of military service, Hank 
finished high school, college and then law 
school. He credits the G.I. Bill with the oppor-
tunities he has had in his life. ‘‘It helped me 
build AIG (American International Group)’’ he 
said, which, under his leadership, became the 
largest insurance company in the world. Hank 
is currently chairman and Chief Executive Offi-
cer of C.V. Starr, a diversified financial serv-
ices firm. 
Hank’s service in our Armed Forces war-
rants our gratitude. His years as an American 
and international corporate leader, a visionary 
of globalization, an innovator, and philan-
thropist who has changed lives for the better 
in the United States and around the world are 
equally stellar and illustrious. And, at the age 
of 95, Hank is as involved as ever. 
Hank is the Honorary Vice Chairman of the 
Council on Foreign Relations and Vice Chair-
man of The National Committee on United 
States-China Relations. He is the past Chair-
man and Director of the Federal Reserve 
Bank of New York. Personally, and as Chair-
man of the Starr Foundation, one of the larg-
est private foundations in the United States, 
Hank oversees disbursement of major finan-
cial support to institutions worldwide. I have 
personally seen the transformational change 
he has made in the lives of thousands of older 
adults at the Hebrew Home at Riverdale, a na-
tionally renowned center for the aging, which 
I have had the great honor to represent for my 
32-year term. In acknowledgment of Hank’s 
longstanding support, the Hebrew Home has 
named its campus the Maurice R. and Corinne 
P. Greenberg Campus. 
Let us acknowledge the extraordinary ac-
complishments of a great American and vet-
eran, a champion of freedom, a patriot, a man 
who has been able to unite countries and 
human beings for the betterment of our great-
er good.

IN HONOR OF KARYL MATSUMOTO 
HON. JACKIE SPEIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 9, 2020 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Karyl Matsumoto as she com-
pletes her remarkable service on the South 
San Francisco city council. She served a 
record 23 years, including four terms as 
Mayor. When you do the math, Karyl has 
been on the council for nearly 2⁄3 of her years 
as a resident of South San Francisco. One 
has to ask if she ever had a moment to simply 
take a leisurely walk along the bayfront. 
South San Francisco has changed remark-
ably since Karyl joined the council. Its popu-
lation grew by 10,000 to a total of 68,000. In 
the Oyster Point area, biotechnology power-
house Genentech and sister companies are 
rapidly replacing traditional uses such as 
warehouses, 
food 
factories, 
airline-related 
businesses and transportation enterprises. 
The Caltrain station is moving and apartments 
are being constructed by the hundreds within 
walking distance of this location and the city’s 
BART station. The city has also become more 
diverse, with approximately 1⁄3 of its residents 
being of either Asian or Latino descent. 
Karyl has contributed to many of these 
changes. For example, she has served for 
over a decade on boards of the county’s 
transportation authority and Samtrans, the pro-
vider of bus services and management of the 
local train service. In South San Francisco, 
she strongly advocated for moving the train 
station. Her years as a Samtrans director are 
among 
her 
proudest 
achievements. 
She 
sought to build the bus service into one that 
takes care of San Mateo County’s wage earn-
ers, while also adapting the system to offer 
new express service, such as the pre-COVID 
line from Foster City to San Francisco. 
It costs a lot to live in San Mateo County. 
Average rent in South San Francisco is 
$3,000 per month. Karyl Matsumoto realized 
that it was impossible for many to survive if 
they had to earn $120,000 per year or more 
just to pay rent and avoid debt. She was the 
first on her council to propose an increase of 
the minimum wage to $15 per hour starting 
January 1, 2021, and her colleagues adopted 
that proposal. She also championed affordable 
housing and balancing jobs with housing in 
order to protect lower-income residents. 
During the course of her multi-decade-long 
public service career, Karyl Matsumoto has 
served on over 30 community groups and 
boards of nonprofits. Examples include the 
Peninsula Family YMCA, the San Mateo 
County Japanese American Citizens League, 
the Skyline College President’s Council Advi-
sory Board, and the United Way Community 
Impact Committee. She also founded the city’s 
youth commission. 
She worked for our esteemed colleague 
Congresswoman ANNA
ESHOO
when Con-
gresswoman ESHOO served on the San Mateo 
County Board of Supervisors, and for former 
State Senator Quentin Kopp. She co-founded 
the South San Francisco Community Outreach 
Program to bring together residents, busi-
nesses and advocacy groups on behalf of 
seniors, residents with special needs and 
other vulnerable residents. 
As a councilwoman, Karyl Matsumoto was 
fiscally conservative and supported building 
the city’s tax base to provide funds for such 
largescale community efforts as the new 911 
and police operations center. She also serves 
as one of two liaisons with the school district 
and on the Caltrain Modernization committee, 
keeping an eye on the progress of a $2 billion 
electrification project for our regional train sys-
tem. 
As she makes her case to colleagues, Karyl 
is known for saying, ‘‘Ergo,’’ and if she forgets 
someone’s name while making a point you 
might hear her say ‘‘Whosewhatis’’ as a 
placeholder. These endearing mannerisms 
signal that a significant point is about to be 
made because Karyl doesn’t let anything— 
even a momentary mind freeze—get in the 
way of the public’s interest. 
Madam Speaker, I can say without fear of 
contradiction that Karyl Matsumoto has made 
a tremendous difference in South San Fran-
cisco and throughout the county. We know her 
as an eager public servant who has a vast 
knowledge of the history of her city and of 
public policy. When she leaves, decades of 
perspective will go with her. All of us in the 
community thank her for a job well done and 
hope she can relax and leave the hard work 
of civic policymaking to others. After decades 
at the wheel, Karyl is getting off the bus. Her 
final stop, a stop called ‘‘success,’’ is just be-
yond the bus door.

RECOGNIZING WILSON COUNTY 
SHERIFF JOE D. TACKITT, JR. 
HON. HENRY CUELLAR 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 9, 2020 
Mr. CUELLAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Sheriff Joe D. Tackitt, Jr. after 28 
years of dedication and service to Wilson 
County, Texas. 
Sheriff Tackitt was elected in 1992 and over 
the course of his career, he worked tirelessly 
to keep his community safe. Through his hard 
work and efforts, he helped bring the Criminal 
Justice Center to Wilson County and improved

communications across the sheriff’s office 
while saving taxpayer money. He also in-
creased the number of full-time deputies on 
patrol to 25 and secured a nearly $7 million 
budget. In addition, he created the Sheriff 
Santa Program to help families in need during 
the holidays. 
I have worked with my friend Sheriff Tackitt 
for several years and witnessed first-hand the 
important work he has done for his commu-
nity. We must never forget his leadership dur-
ing the tragedy at Sutherland Springs Church 
in 2017 and how much he cared for his com-
munity as a third-generation native of Wilson 
County. The dedication that he showed to oth-
ers should be a constant reminder of how we 
should be in our daily lives. 
For his leadership and service, Sheriff 
Tackitt has received several awards. In 2018, 
his office was presented with the EMS Tele-
communicator Award by the Texas Depart-
ment of State Health Services for outstanding 
achievement. In addition, the Sheriffs’ Asso-
ciation of Texas recognized Sheriff Tackitt and 
his staff in 2019 for the outstanding support 
they provided for the 141st Annual Training 
Conference and Expo. 
In addition to his hard work as sheriff, he is 
active in his community as a member of the 
Sheriff’s Association of Texas, the Floresville 
Lions Club, and the Texas Jail Association. 
Along with his involvement in the community, 
he also served as a member of the Texas Air 
National Guard and is a devoted family man. 
As we move forward, let us take the time to 
appreciate the service of heroes like Sheriff 
Tackitt and all the individuals who risk their 
lives each day to keep us safe. However, in 
the words of President John F. Kennedy, ‘‘As 
we express our gratitude, we must never for-
get that the highest appreciation is not to utter 
words, but to live by them.’’ 
Madam Speaker, it is my honor to recognize 
the career and service of Sheriff Tackitt.

CONFERENCE REPORT TO ACCOM-

H.R. 
6395 
WILLIAM 
M. 
(MAC) 
THORNBERRY 
NATIONAL 
DEFENSE 
AUTHORIZATION 
ACT 
FOR FISCAL YEAR 2021 
HON. PETER A. DeFAZIO 
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 9, 2020 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, yesterday I 
voted in support of the Conference Report to 
accompany H.R. 6395, the William M. (Mac) 
Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act 
(NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2021. Make no 
mistake: I have opposed NDAA legislation in 
previous years, and I still have concerns about 
a number of provisions included in this year’s 
legislation, but this year’s conference legisla-
tion also contains numerous policy priorities 
that I strongly support. 
As with the initial House-passed NDAA, this 
legislation grants our men and women in uni-
form a well-deserved pay raise of 3 percent. 
This is the very least we can do for those who 
continue to make extraordinary sacrifices for 
our country. 
As Chair of the Transportation and Infra-
structure Committee, I fought to successfully 
include vital provisions important to Oregon 
coastal communities. This includes the Elijah 
E. Cummings Coast Guard Authorization Act 
of 2020, legislation to authorize funds for, rein-
force, and support the United States Coast 
Guard. I am also pleased that the conferees 
retained important provisions to reauthorize 
U.S. Maritime Administration (MARAD) pro-
grams, and for the first time provided MARAD 
with authority to provide financial assistance to 
the U.S. Maritime Transportation System in 
the event of a national emergency or disaster 
such as the current COVID–19 public health 
emergency. 
Given the Transportation and Infrastructure 
Committee’s jurisdiction over the Federal Avia-
tion Administration (FAA), I am proud that this 
legislation makes a long-overdue correction to 
ensure that the more than 45,000 FAA em-
ployees, as well as VA and other federal civil-
ian employees who were inexcusably left out 
of last year’s NDAA, receive twelve weeks of 
paid parental leave. 
I am also proud that the Conference Report 
includes long-overdue benefits for veterans 
exposed to Agent Orange. Specifically, the 
legislation adds Parkinsonism, bladder cancer, 
and hypothyroidism to the list of diseases as-
sociated with exposure to certain herbicide 
agents. This will ensure that tens of thousands 
of veterans with these diseases get the bene-
fits they deserve. 
While Congress must do much more to 
achieve racial justice in this country, I strongly 
support conferees’ retainment of language re-
quiring the Department of Defense (DOD) to 
remove all names, symbols, displays, monu-
ments, and more that honor Confederate indi-
viduals on DOD property. This demonstrates a 
strong bipartisan rebuke of President Trump’s 
inexplicable threat to veto the NDAA if this 
long-overdue provision is included. I also sup-
port the bill’s addition of needed diversity re-
quirements for DOD military and civilian per-
sonnel, as well as provisions to curtail transfer 
of various military-grade equipment to law en-
forcement agencies. In addition, I am a strong 
supporter of this bill’s requirement that federal 
law enforcement officers, active duty military, 
and National Guard members deployed in re-
sponse to public protests visibly display their 
name and agency on their uniform. This re-
quirement is especially crucial given Trump’s 
appalling use of unidentifiable federal agents 
and unmarked vehicles to detain peaceful pro-
testers in Portland, Oregon. 
I am pleased the conference legislation re-
fuses to authorize funding for President 
Trump’s dangerous and unnecessary pro-
posals to initiate new nuclear weapons testing. 
I also support the bill’s inclusion of funding for 
the Maritime Security Program (MSP) to help 
mitigate the impacts of COVID–19 on maritime 
carriers. Additionally, I support the Conference 
Report’s provisions to strengthen the federal 
government’s ability to combat money laun-
dering and counter financing for terrorism. 
The Conference Report also takes steps to 
counter China’s increasingly malign influence. 
This includes mandating a whole-of-govern-
ment strategy to deter China’s industrial espio-
nage and theft of intellectual property, as well 
as China’s large-scale theft of personal infor-
mation, It also establishes a plan to make the 
DOD less dependent on Chinese manufac-
turing, and it pushes back against China’s ap-
palling human rights abuses. While these are 
good first steps, I believe Congress can and 
should do more to combat China, including 
standing up against China’s trade abuses. 
The legislation also establishes guardrails 
that prohibit the Secretary of Defense from re-
ducing the civilian workforce unless and until 
the DOD first assesses the impact of such re-
ductions. This will help protect against Presi-
dent Trump’s ridiculous attacks—and potential 
future attacks—on civilian federal employees. 
This legislation includes hundreds-of-millions 
in funding for the construction of additional 
housing and barracks for training and enlisted 
personnel, as well as for oversight and im-
provement of the Military Housing Privatization 
Initiative (MHPI) program. The NDAA Con-
ference Report also continues Congress’s 
work to address the military’s culture of sexual 
misconduct by including provisions to enhance 
the prevention of and response to incidents of 
sexual trauma. 
While I strongly support many provisions in 
this year’s NDAA, I believe this legislation 
should have included additional provisions to 
rein in our bloated and wasteful defense 
spending, take back Congress’s constitutional 
war powers authority, and more. 
I believe this legislation could have made 
responsible cuts to our defense budget without 
jeopardizing the safety of our troops or under-
mining our national security. For years, Con-
gress has continued to increase the Penta-
gon’s budget despite overwhelming evidence 
of its waste and abuse of taxpayer money. 
That’s why I supported an amendment to re-
sponsibly reduce the Pentagon budget while 
retaining exceptions to protect service mem-
bers, civilian employees, and the vital Defense 
Health Program from this reduction. Frustrat-
ingly, this amendment failed to pass. 
In particular, I have always opposed the 
DOD’s 
Overseas 
Contingency 
Operations 
(OCO) account, a fiscally irresponsible fund 
that is not counted in the budget, recklessly 
adds to our mounting debt, and has no con-
gressional oversight. OCO is a Pentagon 
slush fund that gives a blank check to fund 
endless wars that Congress hasn’t authorized. 
I will continue fighting to finally eliminate this 
irresponsible fund.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E1128 
December 9, 2020 
I have long supported a financial audit of 
the Pentagon. Unlike every other federal 
agency, the DOD has yet to pass a financial 
audit. For three years in a row, the Pentagon 
has spectacularly failed full audits, which have 
highlighted numerous examples of waste and 
abuse. It is ridiculous to provide the Pentagon 
a massive spending increase—as this bill 
does—when the Pentagon cannot even ac-
count for how it spends taxpayer money. 
That’s why I offered an amendment to require 
and incentivize each DOD component to pass 
an audit by FY25. Unfortunately, my amend-
ment did not receive a vote. 
I believe this legislation should have in-
cluded 
more 
provisions 
to 
take 
back 
Congress’s constitutional war powers author-
ity. I am disappointed that conferees stripped 
out House-passed provisions that would have 
prohibited use of DOD funds to provide sup-
port to Saudi-led airstrikes in Yemen and pro-
hibit unauthorized participation of the U.S. mili-
tary in hostilities in Yemen. I also believe this 
legislation should have prevented the Presi-
dent from using unauthorized force in Iran, re-
pealed the long-outdated 2001 and 2002 au-
thorizations for the use of military force 
(AUMFs), and prohibited funding for the de-
ployment of dangerous low-yield nuclear 
weapons. 
I am also disappointed that other provisions 
which I support were not included in the Con-
ference Report. This includes provisions to 
amend the Insurrection Act to provide Con-
gress more transparency when a President 
deploys active duty military within the United 
States during civil unrest, utilize full Defense 
Production Act authorities to finally meet our 
country’s COVID–19 medical supply needs, 
block the Trump administration’s cruel ban on 
transgender individuals serving in the military, 
finally close down the unnecessary and un-
constitutional Guantanamo Bay prison facility, 
provide immediate student loan relief to the 
over 200,000 servicemembers who have pri-
vately held debt, and include my amendment 
to abolish the military draft. While the Con-
ference Report does take steps to help ad-
dress PFAS and PFOA contamination on mili-
tary installations, I believe this legislation 
should have done much more to address the 
public health threat that this contamination 
poses to our military members and Americans 
living near installations. 
The bottom line is that fiscal responsibility 
and accountability at the DOD would allow for 
taxpayer funds to be better spent supporting 
the needs of our troops, meeting our obliga-
tions to veterans, and ensuring our legitimate 
defense needs are prioritized while also bol-
stering long-underfunded domestic priorities.
