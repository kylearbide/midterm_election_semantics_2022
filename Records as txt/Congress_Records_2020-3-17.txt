PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Lord of majesty, in spite of our chal-
lenges, Your glory and power continues 
to inspire us. We exalt Your Name, 
even when we are overwhelmed by the 
problems we face. 
Lord, breathe Your strength and 
peace into our Senators and use them 
for Your glory. May they continue to 
totally depend on You, knowing that 
with Your mighty power You will sur-
round them with the shield of Your 
blessing. 
Holy God, Your goodness will prevail 
until the end of time. 
We pray in Your great Name. Amen.

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
HYDE-SMITH). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent to address the 
Senate for 1 minute in morning busi-
ness. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
as the coronavirus spreads, U.S. Fed-
eral health and intelligence agencies 
are working hard to protect the public. 
It is critical that their hard work not 
go to waste. Federal health agencies 
must have access to all intelligence 
community information that could 
help combat this pandemic. To help 
with that access, the intelligence com-
munity 
must 
guard 
against 
overclassifying information. In situa-
tions like this, information is power. 
Our Federal health and intelligence 
agencies are the best in the world. 
Let’s show the world that America can 
stop the spread of this virus. 
My tweet for the morning is this: 
2day at 948AM we just received the bill 
from 
the 
House 
the 
‘‘Families 
First 
Coronavirus Response Act’’ What business do 
democrats hv blaming McConnell all wknd 
for not calling a vote when we can’t do any-
thing until the House sends it over? They 
know better Stop the politics! 
This is in response to 172 calls my of-
fice got yesterday wondering why we 
have not voted on this important bill. 
So it is important for me to remind ev-
erybody that the Senate can’t pass this 
bill or even debate this bill until the 
House sends it over. We have now re-
ceived it, and I assume we will soon do 
that. 
I yield the floor. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
as the global outbreak of the new 
coronavirus continues to grow, its im-
pact on American families and small 
businesses is continuing to scale up. 
School closures are challenging both 
parents and teachers. Childcare clo-
sures are complicating family life even 
further. Main Street small businesses 
and their employees are grappling with 
an 
unprecedented 
situation, 
where 
their local leaders are effectively wind-
ing down their businesses for a period 
of time through no fault of their own. 
Major industries that our Nation relies 
on have seen businesses virtually dry 
up overnight—again, not due to any 
business decision they made but be-
cause of appropriate directives from 
public health experts. And most impor-
tant of all, our healthcare system and 
our doctors, nurses, and other frontline 
professionals are gearing up for what 
seems very likely to be the most sig-
nificant 
nationwide 
challenge 
they 
have faced in generations. At every 
level, this new challenge is testing or 
Nation and our institutions. 
Yesterday, my home State of Ken-
tucky reported its first coronavirus-re-
lated death. Our thoughts are with the 
family, friends, and neighbors in Bour-
bon County, who are mourning. 
I spoke with Governor Beshear yes-
terday, and we are continuing to stay 
in close touch. The Bluegrass has now 
confirmed 25 total cases to date. 
And we are heeding the sober warn-
ing of Dr. Fauci. This is what Dr. Fauci 
said: ‘‘Things will get worse before 
they get better.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1766 
March 17, 2020 
It is abundantly clear that our Na-
tion cannot afford partisan politics as 
usual. This is a moment for bold and 
bipartisan action. That is what the 
Senate did earlier this month when we 
passed billions of dollars in targeted 
funding to assist medical professionals 
and responders in every State and to 
ease the initial shock to small busi-
nesses. And that is what the Senate 
needs to expand on this week—bold and 
bipartisan action. 
Yesterday evening, the House finally 
completed 
its 
work 
on 
their 
coronavirus relief proposal, made a 
number of changes, and sent the paper-
work over here to the Senate. 
I know Senators on both sides are 
eager to assist workers, families, and 
small businesses with the financial 
fallout of this extraordinary period. So, 
as I said yesterday afternoon, Senate 
Republicans are convinced that the 
House’s 
noncomprehensive 
bill 
can 
only be the beginning—the beginning— 
of our efforts to support our health sys-
tem, assist individual Americans and 
families, as well as stabilize the U.S. 
economy. 
So, last night, a group of Republican 
Senators 
conferred 
with 
Secretary 
Mnuchin. He is returning to the Cap-
itol to meet with our entire conference 
today. We are continuing urgent talks 
on further legislation that will address 
head-on the three major priorities we 
have spent the last several days dis-
cussing in depth. 
No. 1, we need to provide more direct 
assistance for American workers and 
families. 
No. 2, we need further strong steps to 
secure our economic foundation, most 
especially our small businesses. In par-
ticular, it seems increasingly clear 
that the House’s effort to mandate that 
small businesses provide new worker 
benefits, just as many small businesses 
themselves are in significant jeopardy, 
might even be actually harmful unless 
we urgently address a broader package 
that includes more and broader small 
business relief. 
And, 
No. 
3, 
of 
course, 
the 
foundational priority is to continue 
providing all the support that our med-
ical professionals need as they fight 
this new virus on the frontlines. 
These conversations are ongoing. We 
are making progress. The House of 
Representatives may have left town, 
but the Senate is right here at work. 
We are crafting the major legislation 
that the American people deserve in 
the face of this major challenge. It is 
my intention that the Senate will not 
adjourn until we have passed signifi-
cant and bold new steps—above and be-
yond what the House has passed—to 
help our strong Nation and our strong 
underlying 
economy 
weather 
this 
storm. 
Now, before I conclude this morning, 
I wanted to take a moment to echo and 
amplify the updated guidance that our 
public health experts and the White 
House rolled out yesterday. As Presi-
dent Trump said yesterday, the next 2 
weeks are an important opportunity. 
Our Nation will have a major say in 
how long the virus will spread within 
the United States before it is con-
tained. 
Following the commonsense steps 
laid 
out 
by 
the 
White 
House 
Coronavirus Task Force can signifi-
cantly reduce each American’s risk of 
being exposed or spreading the virus 
within communities. 
First, obviously, those who feel sick, 
stay home. Those who feel sick, stay 
home. Unwell children should be kept 
at home. And anyone with questions 
about their symptoms should contact 
their medical provider. 
Wherever possible, Americans should 
engage in work or school from home. 
Those who cannot, including those 
whose in-person job functions are cen-
tral to our government or our Nation, 
must take especially seriously the 
CDC’s guidelines for health and hy-
giene, especially washing hands and so-
cial distancing. 
All Americans have been strongly 
urged to avoid eating or drinking out, 
to avoid discretionary travel, and to 
avoid visiting nursing homes or retire-
ment facilities unless—unless—it is to 
provide critical assistance. 
Some 
of 
these 
recommendations 
sound like basic common sense. Others 
of them would have sounded almost un-
thinkable just a few weeks ago. 
It is almost impossible to exaggerate 
the pace of change over the past weeks 
and days, but Americans are strong. 
We are resilient. This is a proud Nation 
with a world-changing history, and we 
have come through far greater chal-
lenges than this. This is not a time for 
fear or panic. It is a time to follow the 
facts, listen carefully to the experts, 
and take precautions to protect not 
only ourselves but the most vulnerable 
in our society. Every single one of us 
can do our part.

RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the leadership time 
is reserved. 
f 
MORNING BUSINESS 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the Senate will be 
in a period of morning business, with 
Senators permitted to speak therein 
for up to 10 minutes each. 
The Senator from Illinois. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, yes-
terday, the President of the United 
States and the Centers for Disease Con-
trol contacted us individually and at 
least through the media to advise us to 
avoid gatherings of more than 10 peo-
ple. It is a reflection of the national 
emergency we face and the public 
health crisis that America is facing 
head-on, as it should. 
This morning, as we opened the Sen-
ate, there were 18 people gathered on 
the floor of the Senate—3 Senators and 
15 staff people. As those who follow all 
the Senate can tell, our staffers come 
to work, as they are expected to, but 
come under circumstances that are 
more challenging than they were just a 
few weeks ago. 
I want to thank each and every one 
of them here on the floor, as well as 
the many who you don’t see, behind the 
scenes, who are necessary for the open-
ing of this Capitol and for the protec-
tion of everyone who works here. There 
are policemen and there are people en-
gaged in basic activities here who keep 
this magnificent structure functioning, 
and they come here now in the midst of 
a public health challenge, where most 
every American has been told to stay 
home: If you can possibly stay home, 
do it; for social distancing, make cer-
tain that you stay a certain distance 
between yourself and some other per-
son. Yet they come here, and we thank 
them for it. 
The obvious question is, Why are we 
here under these circumstances? We 
were called back into a week of legisla-
tive activity, which had been scheduled 
to be a week where we were back home 
in our individual States. There is a lot 
for me to do back home, and I am sure 
that is true for every Senator, from the 
crises which we had at O’Hare Air-
port—I was working on that on Satur-
day and Sunday night—to the issue of 
closing schools and feeding children, 
and all of the other issues that are part 
of this coronavirus challenge. 
But we were told to come back here 
this week, to make a trip back, to fly 
back from wherever, to come to the 
U.S. Capitol for two reasons. We were 
told we had to pass the Foreign Intel-
ligence Surveillance Act reauthoriza-
tion because it expired as of last week-
end. It turns out that we have found a 
way to avoid a necessary vote at the 
last minute. The Senate Republican 
leader agreed last night, just a few 
minutes before the scheduled vote, to 
accept a proposal that had been made 
to him by Republican Senator MIKE 
LEE of Utah last Thursday. The Senate 
Republican leader did not accept it 
then. He accepted it last night. The net 
result was we didn’t have to be present. 
We didn’t have to make the journey for 
that purpose. 
The second part of our return is 
equally important and maybe more so 
in light of this public health crisis, and 
that was to consider the measure that 
was taken up by the House of Rep-
resentatives and passed in the early- 
morning hours of Saturday. This meas-
ure, known as the Families First 
Coronavirus Response Act, is the sec-
ond piece of legislation we have consid-
ered and, I am sure, not the last. We 
are 
already 
talking 
about 
the 
coronavirus 3 act, which is likely to be 
debated and voted on soon. 
The point I am making is this meas-
ure, which was physically sent to us 
last night with technical corrections,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1767 
March 17, 2020 
could have been considered as early as 
last Saturday. By unanimous consent, 
the Senate can take up a measure be-
fore it physically arrives from the 
House. It has happened many times be-
fore. It is not extraordinary. The phys-
ical presence of the document is not 
necessary for this debate or for a vote 
to consider it. 
We acknowledge the fact that some-
times the movement of paperwork 
from the House may take a little 
longer than the actual time when we 
physically can take possession of it 
through other means. 
So the argument that was made this 
morning that it wasn’t until we re-
ceived the document last night that we 
could consider it is not accurate. Under 
the Senate rules, by unanimous con-
sent, we could have considered it as 
soon as it was enacted by the House. 
The question before us now is, What 
are we waiting for? There was a tech-
nical correction bill that was added to 
it yesterday, after the House overcame 
the objections of a Republican Con-
gressman. After his objections were set 
aside or satisfied, they moved forward 
with the technical corrections. 
We have the package. It is before us 
now. The obvious question is, Why 
aren’t we passing this measure imme-
diately? We should because contained 
in this measure are important changes 
in the law that will help American 
families respond to this coronavirus 
crisis—fundamental questions: Will we 
provide, for many American workers, 
medical leave if they decide that they 
don’t feel well and want to keep them-
selves, their family, their coworkers, 
and the public safe by staying home? 
They are afraid that if they don’t get 
a paycheck, they won’t be able to meet 
the needs of their families. So this bill 
extends the medical leave coverage to 
more workers across America. I am un-
happy that it doesn’t go further, and 
perhaps we can extend it further with 
the third iteration of our coronavirus 
legislative package. But there is no 
reason not to pass this and to pass it 
now and not to wait a day or two or 
three before we get around to it. Let’s 
do it. Let’s get it done. 
In addition, we have changes in un-
employment compensation. If someone 
literally loses their job because of this 
public health crisis, we want to make 
sure they have something coming in to 
help their families as quickly as pos-
sible. That is a measure I am sure all of 
us agree on—to change the unemploy-
ment compensation laws to help these 
families through very difficult times. 
Why would we wait to pass that? 
We should pass this by unanimous 
consent today and do it quickly. That 
is something I hope the Senate Repub-
lican leader will consider. There is just 
no reason for the delay. 
There are so many other things in-
volved in this. The basic issue of feed-
ing America is now in question. Who is 
going to feed these students whose 
schools have been closed across Illinois 
and across the United States? It is a 
practical challenge in Springfield, IL, 
as well as in Chicago. Well, we have 
issues 
that 
are 
raised 
by 
this 
coronavirus legislation that is before 
us that will change and strengthen 
food assistance at this time of public 
health crisis. Why wait? Let’s get this 
done by unanimous consent. We should 
be doing it and doing it right now. 
In addition to that, we provide addi-
tional Medicaid benefits to the States 
to deal with the obvious health chal-
lenges. We want to make sure that the 
healthcare 
workers—and 
God 
bless 
them for risking their lives for us—are 
paid. We want to make sure the equip-
ment that is needed by hospitals and 
clinics comes on board as quickly as 
possible. 
In my State of Illinois, we have chal-
lenges, from the city of Chicago to 
rural and small towns. They need help. 
The Medicaid assistance in this bill 
will provide help for them imme-
diately. Why wait? Let’s pass this and 
do it this morning. 
We 
also 
have 
free 
testing 
for 
coronavirus that is set out in the law. 
Whether you have insurance, whether 
you are covered by Medicare or Med-
icaid, you are going to be able to be 
tested—when the tests are available, I 
might quickly add—without cost to 
you. And that is the way it should be. 
These are things that are basic. They 
were agreed to not just by NANCY 
PELOSI, the Speaker of the House, but 
by 
the 
Trump 
White 
House, 
Mr. 
Mnuchin. The Secretary came forward 
and negotiated all the changes I have 
just described. So they are bipartisan 
in nature. 
There is no reason for us to delay 
this in any way. We should move on it 
quickly. Putting this off for a day or 
two or whatever the plan is with the 
Republican leadership is totally unnec-
essary and unfortunately requires staff 
to wait around here when they have 
been advised they should be home, 
there should be social distance, and 
they should be in a circumstance where 
they are not endangering themselves in 
terms of their health or anyone else’s. 
Let’s get this done. 
The third issue I want to raise is one 
which is critically important but I be-
lieve is timely. We have to think anew 
about the way the Senate does busi-
ness. If we are telling people to do their 
work from home when possible, tele-
conferencing as opposed to being phys-
ically present at work, what are we 
doing to achieve the same thing? 
There has been speculation, conjec-
ture about a coronavirus aid package— 
the third one in the series. I totally 
support it. On the Democratic side, we 
have a long list of particulars of things 
that we think will be helpful to get 
this economy back on its feet by start-
ing with families and workers and ex-
panding it to small businesses. It is a 
long list, it is a comprehensive list, and 
I am sure there are even more sugges-
tions that could come before us. How 
are we going to consider those? Are we 
going to meet as committees as we or-
dinarily do, in the same room, when we 
have been advised that is not a good 
idea from a public health viewpoint, or 
are we going to do it by teleconfer-
encing and Skyping and using modern 
technology? 
It is time for the Senate to wake up 
to the 21st century and to make sure 
we are using technology that allows us 
to communicate with one another 
without any danger or risk to public 
health. 
In addition to that, there is a more 
difficult question about how we can 
vote in the U.S. Senate if we are not 
physically present. I know that is 
being considered. Senator KLOBUCHAR 
and I have discussed it. I know she is 
thinking about it from a Senate rules 
perspective. Senator SCHATZ of Hawaii 
has raised the same question. Others 
have too. 
Let’s get into this. Let’s find a way 
to do this that protects the integrity of 
our voting procedure but acknowledges 
the reality that our physical presence 
on the floor may not be required to be 
actually present under the rules of the 
Senate—at least for the sake of count-
ing our votes. We ought to be dis-
cussing that this week and make sure 
we have a task force that is working on 
coming up with answers to that as 
quickly as possible. 
Finally, I think it is time for us to 
start meeting as committees by this 
teleconferencing and Skyping and talk-
ing about this coronavirus 3 package— 
the one that really stretches us beyond 
where we are. 
Let’s take a look at the first two 
measures. With coronavirus 1, which 
was a supplemental appropriation, the 
President asked for about $2 billion. We 
came up, on a bipartisan basis in just 2 
short weeks, with $8 billion, primarily 
focusing on healthcare resources, on 
research, and on developing vaccines. 
That was a must, and we did it on a bi-
partisan basis. 
The second package talks about fam-
ilies and workers and small businesses 
and how they should respond and how 
we can help them. 
The third package I think will take a 
look at the original two to see if they 
need to be changed in any way but to 
expand our reach even more. 
Let’s do it in the context that we are 
preaching to America. As we hold the 
press conferences in Washington and 
tell Americans ‘‘Avoid going to work 
physically if you can,’’ let’s try to find 
ways to make the Senate work without 
putting anyone’s health at risk. We can 
do that, but we need to do that to-
gether. 
Let me also say that the Senator 
from Kentucky said that the Senate 
will not recess until significant new 
measures beyond what the House has 
passed are considered. If there is a plan 
for that, please let us know. Those of 
us who are here and worried about 
whether there will be transportation 
back home to our families at some 
point would like to know what the 
schedule is going to be. If the Senate

leader, the Republican leader, has a 
plan, please share it with us too. All of 
us are waiting and anxious to know 
what our circumstances will be for the 
days ahead. 
I want to stay here and get the work 
done, but let’s do it in an orderly, safe, 
and nonrisky way. Let’s try to abide by 
the same guidelines we are preaching 
to the rest of America. Let’s use new 
technology. Let’s use our best thinking 
and come up with bipartisan answers. 
That, to me, is the way to manage the 
Senate in the midst of this national 
emergency. 
We shouldn’t be returning, as we 
have this week, and facing situations 
like last night where our vote was not 
even necessary. Many of us came here 
ready to vote and found that there had 
been an agreement that made such a 
vote unnecessary. 
It is time for a greater spirit of co-
operation and communication. Just to 
have the Republican side come up with 
their list and we come up with ours, 
without dialogue, doesn’t lead us to 
where we need to be. Let’s have that 
dialogue and do it in a safe and 
thoughtful way.

CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
our country is facing an unprecedented 
public health emergency with severe 
and potentially long-lasting economic 
consequences. As COVID–19 spreads, 
our local health officials and health ex-
perts tell us we are woefully unpre-
pared for what is about to hit us. Pub-
lic health infrastructure, like hospital 
beds and masks and ventilators, must 
be produced and procured. Testing is 
still not at its proper capacity. The re-
sulting economic downturn from this 
virus is already impacting millions of 
American families, workers, and busi-
nesses—small, medium, large, alike. 
First, on a personal note, please, 
Americans, take care of yourselves. 
Avoid 
unnecessary 
contact, 
even 
though I know so many of the meetings 
and gatherings and celebrations that 
we have planned must be postponed. It 
is painful but not as painful as the con-
tinuing spread of this awful virus. 
And a little advice—this is not uni-
versal, but I have heard this from a 
number of medical people whom I 
trust: Take your temperature in the 
morning and in the evening. It is a 
good way to check whether you have 
this illness and it is progressing within 
you. Not all experts agree with that, 
but many do. In my view, it can’t hurt. 
It is something I am doing. I am urging 
my family to do it, and I am urging my 
staff to do it. 
Our response in the Senate and in 
Congress—the 
response 
to 
the 
coronavirus—will require a massive 
mobilization of public resources—Fed-
eral, State, and local—as we have mar-
shaled before only in wartime. It is 
going to require Congress to work in a 
bipartisan way and with uncommon 
speed. And the American people, too, 
must pull together and sacrifice in 
ways small and large their normal way 
of life in an effort to combat this dis-
ease and limit its spread. All hands 
must be on deck because the task be-
fore us is daunting and may yet eclipse 
the pain felt by workers and families 
during the great recession—at least for 
many things. 
The first order of business here in the 
Senate is to take up and pass the re-
cent House bill and do it today. It will 
provide free coronavirus testing. That 
is essential. It would extend paid sick 
leave. It would give food assistance, 
Medicaid reimbursement, and expanded 
unemployment insurance. 
I understand that some of my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
might want to amend the legislation or 
have it written differently if they were 
the ones putting it together. But I re-
mind them that Leader MCCONNELL 
said that he would defer the agreement 
between the Speaker of the House and 
Secretary Mnuchin. The President has 
said he will sign this bill if the Senate 
passes it. If we change the bill, it will 
go back to the House and be delayed 
and delay the aid it contains for Amer-
ican families coping with the impact of 
the virus. 
Please, my colleagues, we will have 
other opportunities to legislate, and 
there will be a great need for them, but 
let’s move this now. Let’s move this 
now. I believe our side of the aisle will 
clear this. I hope the other side will, 
and it will be on the President’s desk 
today. Let’s hope, and let’s not delay 
any longer. 
But there is much more to be done. 
Once this legislation is sent to the 
President’s desk—COVID 2—our work 
will not be over, not even close. We 
must soon move to other very nec-
essary 
measures 
to 
address 
the 
coronavirus and its widening impact on 
the health and well-being of the Amer-
ican people. 
Today, I am presenting a series of 
proposals to congressional appropri-
ators that would provide initial infu-
sion of at least $750 billion. Our pro-
posal is big, it is bold, but it is also tar-
geted. It focuses on those Americans in 
the parts of the health sector and the 
economy most in need now: hospitals 
and treatment, unemployment insur-
ance and Medicaid, loan forbearance 
and aid for small business, childcare, 
and senior citizens. It focuses on those 
who need help—those who don’t have 
an income because they have lost their 
job temporarily; those who need help 
with senior citizens, with children who 
are not in school; hospitals that are 
short of equipment and maybe per-
sonnel. That is the immediate focus. 
That is what we must do right now. We 
must focus on those who need help im-
mediately and do it in a way that deals 
with the structural problems in the 
country that have made the attack of 
this virus more virulent, more harmful, 
and worse. 
By contrast, it is reported that the 
administration is proposing a massive 
Federal bailout of industry and a pay-
roll tax cut. If we are going to follow 
up the House bill with another major 
economic stimulus package, which we 
must, our major focus cannot be based 
on bailing out airlines, cruises, and 
other 
industries. 
We 
must 
first 
prioritize economic solutions that are 
focused on workers and their families, 
solutions that would allow us to fix our 
broken unemployment system; rebuild 
our public health system, which is 
overburdened; save small and medium- 
sized American businesses that have a 
cash crunch and will go out of business, 
even though they were healthy a 
month ago, because no one is buying 
their products or using their services. 
Let’s 
remember—corporations 
are 
not people. People are people. And 
when it comes to this cascading crisis, 
we should help our fellow Americans 
first, even as we plan and execute poli-
cies that protect our economy. The ad-
ministration’s proposal, if that is the 
sum of it—a massive bailout of indus-
try and a payroll tax cut—doesn’t do 
that. It doesn’t target the people who 
most need the help. Any package we 
are going to do here, which must be 
passed in a bipartisan way, must con-
tain large elements of what I am talk-
ing about and maybe other things as 
well that help the people who are in 
need. 
I will be sending my proposal and a 
PowerPoint slide to every one of my 
colleagues shortly, and I hope they will 
understand the need for it. I have con-
sulted with large numbers in our cau-
cus, and we have broad support for 
these proposals and some others. 
Again, when it comes to this cas-
cading crisis, we should help fellow 
Americans first, even as we plan and 
execute policies that protect our econ-
omy. 
First, we take actions to fight this 
virus. First, we get lifelines to our 
workers, our parents, our students, our 
seniors, our small businesses. If your 
house is on fire, the first thing you 
worry about is not smoke damage to 
the roof; you try to put out the fire. 
That is what our proposal does. It 
means, first and foremost, we work to 
address the virus itself and the people 
most impacted. 
In the midst of a sprawling health 
and economic catastrophe, industry 
bailouts should not be at the top of our

priority list. Our proposal also does not 
include a payroll tax cut. That option 
may be premature and the wrong re-
sponse to the problems we face today. 
There are much better ways to get 
money in the hands of the Americans 
who need it most and in the ways they 
need it most. 
For example, in our proposal, the 
Senate Democratic proposal, if you are 
a worker and lose your job or can’t 
work, you would qualify for nearly 
$10,000 over 6 months in unemployment 
benefits. If you can’t work because you 
get sick and your employer doesn’t 
provide paid sick leave, we would allow 
you to apply for unemployment insur-
ance and get reimbursed. Under Sen-
ator MURRAY’s leadership, we are also 
doing more on the sick leave front. 
If your hours are cut and you sud-
denly can’t pay your mortgage, you are 
going to lose your home, or if you are 
otherwise struggling to make ends 
meet because you choose to pay your 
mortgage but then can’t pay other 
vital expenses, our proposal would let 
you defer your mortgage loans for 6 
months with no penalty, fees, or im-
pact on your credit. We will do the 
same for student loans. We will do the 
same for small business loans. There 
will be a 6-month moratorium. That 
helps real people. 
If you are a working parent and sud-
denly you have to worry about finding 
a safe place for your kids to stay dur-
ing the day, we would provide emer-
gency funding to safely ramp up 
childcare services for heavily impacted 
parts of the country. If you are a small 
business suddenly facing cash flow 
problems, we would allow you to apply 
for low-interest loans and other forms 
of direct financial assistance that can 
offer relief quickly and allow you to 
overcome this problem and keep your 
business going in a healthy way. 
These are just a few examples. Our 
proposal includes much more but in-
cludes what is needed and needed im-
mediately. It includes what Governors 
across the country are calling for—aid 
to public health systems and citizens 
impacted by this crisis. 
I would say to my Republican col-
leagues: We want to work with you. 
You will have different ideas, but our 
ideas must be contained in a package. 
The thing the administration has been 
talking about, if that is true, is not 
good enough at all. 
There is one other thing we need. As 
more testing becomes available, the 
number of confirmed coronavirus cases 
will inevitably increase and the strain 
on our public health system will be-
come even greater. We are going to 
need massive investments to ensure we 
have the capacity and necessary infra-
structure to treat all Americans who 
need it. Our proposal addresses that as 
well. 
As we discuss what is to come in the 
next few weeks, I strongly urge my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle, both 
ends of the Capitol, to review our pro-
posal and organize our next legislative 
response around these ideas. 
In conclusion, this crisis is going to 
demand more from all of us—more 
from the administration and a Presi-
dent who has been far too slow in wak-
ing up to the scale of the challenges we 
now face, more from a Congress that 
has to set aside partisan squabbles and 
work together, and more from the 
American people, who must diligently 
follow public health guidance and en-
dure massive disruptions of their daily 
lives. I know my family is enduring 
that right now, and so are millions and 
millions of families across America. 
We have to stick together, be strong, 
support one another, and we will get 
through it. We will. We have not faced 
a public health crisis of this global 
scale in recent times. We are unsure 
how long the disturbance to our na-
tional economic life will last. Yet we 
Americans have overcome challenges 
of this magnitude and even greater be-
fore, and we will again. It will demand 
determination, cooperation, and sac-
rifice. It will demand an enormous, co-
ordinated effort by the Government of 
the United States at all levels to pro-
tect the health and safety of the Amer-
ican people. But we will overcome this 
problem, 
together—strongly, 
force-
fully, and smartly.

f 
FISA 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, the 
Senate had three priorities for this 
week: reauthorizing the expiring provi-
sions of the Foreign Intelligence Sur-
veillance Act, passing the second phase 
of our coronavirus response, and initi-
ating a serious discussion about what 
else we need to do to help Americans 
address this challenge. I have to say I 
am glad we have already made progress 
on all three fronts. 
On Sunday, several key provisions of 
the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance 
Act expired, including the provision 
that allows the FBI to wiretap lone- 
wolf terrorists—terrorists not affili-
ated with a specific terrorist organiza-
tion—and the roving wiretap provision 
that prevents the FBI from having to 
seek a new wiretap warrant each time 
a terrorist suspect changes his phone 
number. 
Every minute of every day, the men 
and women of our law enforcement and 
intelligence communities are working 
to track terrorist threats and prevent 
attacks on American citizens. We need 
to ensure that they have all the tools 
they need to do their jobs. 
The Foreign Intelligence Surveil-
lance Act provisions that expired Sun-
day are key weapons in the fight to 
keep Americans safe. I am pleased we 
were able to pass a 77-day extension 
yesterday and set up a process for con-
sideration of a long-term extension. 
I strongly support the bipartisan 
House bill, which combines extensions 
of these key anti-terrorism tools with 
new accountability measures that will 
ensure that law enforcement is held to 
the highest standards when pursuing 
surveillance of suspected terrorists and 
foreign agents. Attorney General Barr 
has also endorsed the House bill. I look 
forward to taking up this legislation 
and debating several issues raised by 
my colleagues before we are on the 
brink of another expiration. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. THUNE. Of course, the other 
thing we are focused on this week is 
the issue that is at the top of every-
one’s mind, and that is dealing with 
the coronavirus outbreak. 
Two weeks ago, Congress passed 
coronavirus legislation providing more 
than $8 billion in funding for virus re-
search, testing, and medical care. This 
week, we are looking to pass the sec-
ond phase of Congress’s response, and 
that is legislation to continue our in-
vestment in medical care and to begin 
to address the economic impact the 
coronavirus is having on American 
workers. 
The House has reached an agreement 
with 
Treasury 
Secretary 
Steve 
Mnuchin, and Senators are currently 
reviewing 
the 
House’s 
legislation, 
which arrived here in the Senate just 
this morning. I look forward to passing 
that bill this week. 
As the leader said on Sunday, Senate 
Republicans believe that any legisla-
tion we pass this week is only the be-
ginning of Congress’s response to the 
virus. 
As this outbreak continues to unfold, 
other issues will need to be addressed, 
and Senate Republicans are already 
planning for legislation to address fu-
ture priorities, whether they be in the 
increased funding for medical facilities 
or measures to provide support for 
American families and businesses. 
This is a challenging time for our 
country, but it is often in challenging 
times that we see the very best of 
America. We are seeing that already— 
in neighbors’ ensuring that neighbors 
are supplied with necessities; in sports 
figures’ donating to ensure that work-
ers at their arenas are still paid even 
when games aren’t being played; in res-
taurants’ helping to feed their neigh-
bors even though their businesses are 
currently suffering; in companies and 
arts organizations’ acting to provide 
free resources to families who are 
hunkering down at home; in the mil-
lions of Americans who are providing 
the essential services we need during 
this 
outbreak—from 
the 
workers’ 
stocking the shelves at our grocery 
stores and pharmacies to the truck 
drivers’ delivering needed goods across 
our country; finally and especially, in

our healthcare professionals, from doc-
tors and nurses to sanitation staff, who 
risk exposure every day to ensure that 
Americans receive the care they need. 
When we have come through this out-
break, all of us will want to be able to 
look back and say that we did every-
thing we could to help keep our fellow 
Americans safe and slow the spread of 
this disease. The best way to do that is 
by following the guidelines that we 
have been given—washing our hands 
frequently and thoroughly, practicing 
social distancing, avoiding large gath-
erings, and staying home when advised. 
Some of these measures may be incon-
venient, but they are a small price to 
pay to flatten the curve and limit the 
disease’s spread. 
While anyone can be hit hard by the 
coronavirus, there are a lot of people 
who are especially vulnerable to com-
plications—from elderly Americans to 
the many individuals who have pre-
existing conditions. Let’s do every-
thing we can to protect our fellow 
Americans and prevent our hospitals 
and our healthcare professionals from 
being overwhelmed with cases. 
I am confident that, if we pull to-
gether and look out for each other, our 
Nation will emerge from this challenge 
stronger. I look forward to working 
with my colleagues here in Congress to 
ensure that our Nation has the re-
sources it needs to combat and defeat 
this disease. 
I was encouraged to hear our Senate 
Democratic leader speak about his 
willingness to work with the Repub-
licans. Obviously, to do anything here 
in the Senate requires 60 votes, which 
means we have to have bipartisan co-
operation. We have a legislative vehi-
cle, as I mentioned, that contains a 
number of features that are helpful, I 
think, in terms of addressing the crisis 
that we are experiencing, not only on 
the healthcare front but on the eco-
nomic front with regard to the hard-
ships that are being experienced by 
millions of Americans. 
There is more that we need to do, and 
those discussions, as I mentioned, are 
underway, and I am hopeful that we 
will be able to come to a conclusion, to 
a resolution, that would be good not 
only for those Americans who have 
been hurting economically and who, 
perhaps, are not working and are not 
able to get to work, but for those busi-
nesses that have shut down—our small 
businesses that create the majority of 
jobs in this country—and for, cer-
tainly, the healthcare professionals, 
who, as I said, are on the frontlines 
every single day. We need to take every 
step we possibly can to ensure that we 
protect people from the spread of the 
disease and ensure that they continue 
to sustain their economic livelihoods 
in the midst of this crisis. 
Many of the things that are being 
discussed and worked on that will re-
quire collaboration with the Democrats 
and the House of Representatives will 
need to be approached in a bipartisan 
way. We need to recognize that the 
need is great and that the absolute ne-
cessity of cooperation is greater than 
ever. I look forward to working with 
our colleagues here this week as we 
move forward in a way that will, hope-
fully, lead to some very positive results 
and will address the very critical needs 
being felt by families all across this 
country as a result of this coronavirus 
disease.

CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I 
rise today at a pivotal time for our Na-
tion. It is quiet today in Big Sky Coun-
try. Over the last 36 hours, we have 
seen schools, restaurants, bars, gyms, 
ski resorts, and churches close. Thou-
sands of children are home from school, 
many unsure where their next meal 
will come from, and parents are with-
out childcare. 
There are no test kits to test for 
coronavirus to speak of—a few, but not 
nearly enough, and inadequate medical 
supplies in Indian Country. 
Thousands are concerned about what 
it means for their paychecks. Seniors 
are worried about their health. Busi-
nesses are forced to make very, very 
tough choices. 
Millions of Americans are depending 
on us here in Washington, DC, to act 
and to act quickly. The House jumped 
into action and began negotiating with 
the administration on a bill to address 
some of the most pressing and imme-
diate concerns of the coronavirus. A 
deal was struck, and the House passed 
the bill with an overwhelming bipar-
tisan majority. 
And what happened in the Senate? 
Well, last Thursday, the majority lead-
er sent us home. Business as usual. 
What 
we 
should 
have 
done—we 
should have stuck around and done the 
people’s work. But, instead, my friends 
in the majority decided we should oper-
ate as business as usual and take off 
Friday, take off the weekend, and go 
home. 
Well, this is not business as usual. If 
the majority leader would have lis-
tened to the CDC, he would have heard 
that what he did last Thursday was 
contrary to the recommendations they 
have made to avoid groups, to avoid 
airports. We did just the opposite. 
Millions of Americans are waiting for 
the Senate to act. What we are here to 
consider today, which we should have 
considered last Saturday, is an impor-
tant start toward providing needed re-
lief. It provides free testing, sick leave, 
unemployment insurance for those los-
ing their jobs through no fault of their 
own. 
We could have done this several days 
ago, but, instead, we continue to wait. 
We continue to wait as we have 
watched 
athletics 
shut 
down—the 
NCAA, baseball, hockey, basketball, 
NBA—restaurants, Broadway, schools 
close. The list goes on and on, and we 
continue to languish here in the U.S. 
Senate, supposedly the greatest delib-
erative body in the world. We do this 
while 4 in 10 Americans struggle to 
cover an unanticipated expense of $400. 
Let me say that again: 4 in 10 families 
are $400 away from financial crisis. 
This bill ensures that a hotel em-
ployee in Billings can stay home if she 
is feeling ill without sacrificing that 
$400 for rent, groceries, or childcare. 
A quarter of a million Americans go 
without medical care for fear of the 
cost. This bill ensures that no one is 
going 
without 
healthcare 
or 
coronavirus tests for fear of the ex-
pense. More than that, the bill would 
increase the amount of funding for 
Montana’s Medicaid Program to cover 
additional Medicaid expenses. 
Many kids in Montana rely on lunch 
that they get at their schools as the 
primary source of nutrition for the 
day. This bill will allow those students 
to continue to get lunch even if the 
schools are closed. 
Seniors who are homebound rely on 
meal delivery services such as Meals on 
Wheels. Missoula Aging Services is al-
ready preparing to use its allotment of 
millions of dollars in additional rev-
enue for senior nutrition, for providing 
more meals for seniors who are fol-
lowing recommendations to stay home. 
This pandemic is already causing sig-
nificant impacts to our economy. We 
know that all too well. This is why this 
bill addresses unexpected unemploy-
ment and helps small businesses cover 
paid sick leave for those who need it. 
Under this bill, low-income pregnant 
women and mothers with young chil-
dren who lose their jobs due to COVID– 
19 will be able to access food assist-
ance. All of these are commonsense, bi-
partisan solutions that the Senate has 
delayed for no good reason. 
On the farm, when there is work to 
be done, especially when it is time-sen-
sitive work, you don’t take a break. 
You get the job done. I call on my col-
leagues not to waste another moment— 
to hold a vote and get the job done. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1771 
March 17, 2020 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. 
CORNYN. 
Madam 
President, 
across our country, we are seeing cit-
ies, schools, businesses, and other orga-
nizations take the necessary and seri-
ous precautions to keep the American 
people safe from the spread of the 
coronavirus. School districts, colleges, 
and universities are canceling in-per-
son classes, churches are moving serv-
ices online, professional sports teams 
are hitting pause on their regular sea-
son, airlines are canceling flights, and 
many Main Street businesses are clos-
ing their doors. 
I know that all of this is a little dis-
orienting and certainly alarming. But 
while these measures aren’t normal, it 
is a sign that we are heeding advice 
from the experts, people like Dr. Fauci 
and organizations like the Centers for 
Disease Control. It is a sign that we are 
doing what we can to prevent or at 
least slow down community spread. It 
is a sign that we are standing together 
and making progress, ultimately ex-
pecting that we will get through this 
together. The difficult decisions that 
need to be made by elected officials, 
business owners, and community lead-
ers when they decide to shut down nor-
mal parts of our daily lives—these are 
not easy decisions for them to make. 
Despite the public health benefits 
these closures will provide, we are also 
expecting other serious—mainly eco-
nomic—consequences. 
Our 
economic 
engine is being brought to a halt as 
people are staying home rather than 
producing, and small businesses and 
their employees in particular are feel-
ing the impact. 
Jason Phillips is a manager at Zoli’s 
Pizza in Fort Worth, TX, and he has 
been in the service industry for more 
than 20 years. Still, he said he has 
never been in a situation quite like 
this one. He said this past Saturday 
that Zoli’s Pizza had about half the 
number of customers they have come 
to expect. 
Steven Startz has experienced a simi-
lar struggle. Last November, he opened 
a new restaurant in New Braunfels, TX, 
just north of San Antonio, called Le 
Citron European Cafe and Bistro. The 
first year for any new restaurant is 
bound to be tough. As luck would have 
it, a week after they opened, an oven 
broke, and it had to be replaced. But 
nothing has prepared Steven for the 
months of February and March, what 
they would bring. He was hoping, as 
you might imagine, for an uptick in 
tourists, which would mean more busi-
ness, but instead a pandemic has kept 
everybody at home. Rather than a posi-
tive bump in the business, revenue for 
his young restaurant is down 60 per-
cent. As a result, he has had to cut 
staff, and he hasn’t hired replacements 
for the employees he has recently lost. 
This is an all-too-familiar struggle 
for millions of Americans who are un-
able to go to work during this pan-
demic and are facing serious economic 
uncertainty about their future. Those 
in 
the 
service 
industry—especially 
those who rely on tips—are among the 
hardest hit. 
I am glad to say that soon the Senate 
will take action to provide additional 
relief. As the Presiding Officer knows, 
we passed an $8.3 billion emergency 
package to help fast-track discovery of 
a vaccine and to make sure that our 
healthcare sector is prepared for what 
is coming at it, or at least better pre-
pared. 
The House has now passed the Fami-
lies First Coronavirus Response Act, 
which we are in the process of taking 
up and will hopefully finish this week, 
and then I expect there will be a third 
installment—a stimulus package that 
Treasury Secretary Mnuchin will be up 
here on the Hill talking about today to 
try to help employees and employers 
and entire industries survive this eco-
nomic trauma. 
The Families First Coronavirus Re-
sponse Act will help protect both the 
physical and financial health of our 
country by supporting workers and 
their families impacted by the virus. It 
will remove financial barriers for Tex-
ans who need access to coronavirus 
testing, regardless of income or insur-
ance coverage. 
This is one of the things I talked to 
Governor Abbott about in particular. 
He said that there are two things that 
Texas needs. He said it is more testing 
and it is more protective equipment, 
personal protective equipment—PPEs, 
as they are called—in order for this 
testing to take place. 
While it is still true—according to 
the Centers for Disease Control—that 
you should not be tested unless you are 
experiencing symptoms and referred by 
a healthcare provider, it is clear that 
more testing is going to be needed, and 
indeed we have heard from the Presi-
dent and the Vice President and the ad-
ministration in general that we expect 
a huge ramping up of the capacity to 
test people so they can know whether 
they are positive and they need to stay 
in isolation or possibly need healthcare 
treatment or whether, like the Presi-
dent and one of our colleagues here, 
Senator GRAHAM, they are negative, 
and obviously the peace of mind that 
comes with that. This legislation re-
moves all financial barriers for that 
testing. 
For those who have private insur-
ance, it requires that all plans cover 
the cost of testing, including the cost 
of a provider, an urgent care center, 
and emergency room visits in order to 
get tested. As I said, right now, CDC 
protocol calls for a healthcare provider 
to make a diagnosis based on symp-
toms that would then lead to a test. 
Those are the same zero-cost meas-
ures that would apply to those covered 
by Medicare, Medicaid, and TRICARE. 
It also requires the National Disaster 
Medical System to reimburse the cost 
of testing for patients who are unin-
sured. 
In short, the bottom line is, no one 
will have to pay to be tested for the 
coronavirus, period. 
This legislation also includes a range 
of provisions to provide financial secu-
rity for those who are unable to work, 
and that is because they are protecting 
the public health. It will create a new 
Federal emergency paid sick leave pro-
gram 
for 
those 
impacted 
by 
the 
coronavirus. That means that any 
Texan—any American who is diag-
nosed, quarantining, or caring for a de-
pendent who was impacted by this 
virus will be able to take 14 days of 
paid sick leave. And many Texas work-
ers will be able to access 12 weeks of 
paid leave for virus-related long-term 
absences. These protections include 
workers who stay home to care for 
their loved ones, including staying 
home with their kids due to school clo-
sures. 
This bill also makes changes to un-
employment insurance. It will tempo-
rarily waive requirements for workers 
to prove they are actively searching for 
work during the public health emer-
gency response, and it will provide $1 
billion in emergency grants for States 
to support processing and paying un-
employment 
insurance 
benefits. 
In 
other words, we know that people are 
staying home because their employers 
have told them their businesses have 
been shut down. Even though they are 
not sick, they are suffering financial 
loss. The purpose of this is to make 
sure that through the vehicle of unem-
ployment insurance, they do get some 
money so that they can take care of 
their necessities and keep putting food 
on the table. 
This bill also takes serious steps to 
strengthen food security for those who 
are struggling with reliable access to 
healthy meals. This is one of the things 
I heard from a friend of mine out in 
West Texas just today concerned about 
the food banks that provide a safety 
net for people without access to reg-
ular, healthy food. This bill actually 
will send $400 million to local food 
banks, which are supporting those low- 
income families across the country, in-
cluding in places like West Texas. 
We know that older Americans are 
the most vulnerable when it comes to 
the coronavirus, and many are afraid 
to leave their homes at the risk of get-
ting sick. This legislation provides a 
quarter of a billion dollars for the sen-
ior nutrition program to provide home- 
delivered meals to low-income seniors. 
It also provides half a billion dollars 
for Federal food stamps. It provides 
flexibility on work requirements, so 
those who lose their jobs or aren’t able 
to work can receive assistance when 
they need it the most. 
I mentioned the food banks and the 
school lunch program. Last week, the 
U.S. Department of Agriculture ap-
proved a request from Texas with re-
gard to school lunches. Millions of 
Texas students are currently eligible 
for free lunch programs, but, obviously, 
when the schools close, they don’t get 
access to that nutrition. But thanks to 
the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 
Texas schools can continue to serve

free meals to low-income students, 
even when their schools are closed. 
This legislation also includes a range 
of measures to support healthcare 
workers, veterans, small businesses, 
and countless Texans who are strug-
gling financially as a result of this pan-
demic. 
Of course, we know we are all racing 
against the clock to respond to this 
virus, and it is important for Congress 
to act promptly to demonstrate to the 
American people that we understand 
the problem and that we are using 
every tool in our toolbox to respond to 
this crisis on their behalf. 
In any major event—whether it is a 
natural disaster or a pandemic—we 
need an all-of-government response. 
All of us need to be cooperating and 
working on the same page, moving as 
efficiently as we possibly can. 
As 
I 
said, 
the 
Families 
First 
Coronavirus Response Act builds on 
the $8.3 billion emergency spending bill 
that was signed into law by President 
Trump earlier this month. It also com-
plements the national emergency dec-
laration made by President Trump last 
week and Governor Abbott’s disaster 
declaration for the State of Texas. 
That is why I plan to support this bill 
when a vote is scheduled. 
I know there are other Senators who 
have said they have good ideas. Many 
of them are intriguing and I think 
would make a positive addition to this 
legislation, but I think in times like 
this, the thing we need to do is to work 
together and function expeditiously to 
get this legislation passed. And because 
we know there is going to be another 
installment—a third installment—to 
respond to the coronavirus, perhaps 
those other good ideas can be included 
in that additional legislation, which we 
will pass before we recess. 
I was interested to hear the majority 
leader say that we will not recess until 
we take up and pass that third install-
ment. I think his sense of urgency and 
his sense of determination and focus is 
well justified, and I congratulate him 
for that. I think we need to all pull to-
gether in a similar spirit of unity. 
I thank the Trump administration, 
especially 
Treasury 
Secretary 
Mnuchin, for working so quickly with 
Speaker PELOSI to build this package 
so that we can provide relief for Amer-
ican workers and families as soon as 
possible. 
This is not the first bill to strength-
en our response to the coronavirus, and 
it will not be our last. As I said, there 
is a bipartisan commitment to passing 
the third phase to strengthen our econ-
omy and support the industries and 
businesses that have been hit the hard-
est by this pandemic. 
Leader MCCONNELL has made clear 
his commitment to finding a bold, bi-
partisan solution to the economic chal-
lenges we are facing and will continue 
to face in the months ahead, and I am 
proud to support this effort. 
While conversations continue regard-
ing the next phase of our coronavirus 
response and what that may look like, 
I believe it is time to pass the Families 
First Coronavirus Response Act so that 
we provide this needed relief to the 
American people as soon as possible. 
(Mr. SULLIVAN assumed the Chair.) 
f 
RECESS 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
stand in recess until 2:15 p.m. 
There being no objection, the Senate, 
at 12:03 p.m., recessed until 2:15 p.m. 
and reassembled when called to order 
by the Presiding Officer (Mrs. CAPITO). 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
BLACKBURN). The Senator from New 
Jersey. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, 
first of all, I want to thank the staff 
here in the Senate. Even in these dif-
ficult times, they answer the call of 
doing the work of the American people, 
and I want to appreciate their being 
here so that the Senate can conduct its 
work. They are essential to being able 
to do that. So I want to acknowledge 
that. 
I come to the floor today as our 
country grapples with a global pan-
demic that, tragically, has claimed the 
lives of thousands of people around the 
world, including dozens throughout the 
United States and three in my home 
State of New Jersey. 
I come to the floor because I hope 
that people understand the fierce ur-
gency of ‘‘now’’—the fierce urgency of 
‘‘now.’’ This is a public health crisis, 
and we can’t wait to act. 
The rapid spread of COVID–19, also 
known as the coronavirus, has dis-
rupted our daily lives. It has desta-
bilized our economy and has imposed 
an enormous strain on our healthcare 
system. 
I think many failed to grasp the 
scope of this threat—the lack of a na-
tional response just as the virus began 
to reach America’s shores. But I am 
not here to talk today about where the 
administration went wrong; I am here 
to talk about how it can start making 
things right. 
If there is anything we have learned 
in recent weeks, it is that you have to 
be proactive. In the past week, the 
number of confirmed COVID–19 cases 
here in the United States jumped from 
around 1,000 to well over 4,000. While 
other countries were testing thousands 
of people, the United States was test-
ing mere dozens. While other countries 
were staging makeshift hospitals, we 
were overloading ours. While other 
countries implemented aggressive so-
cial distancing measures to limit the 
spread of COVID–19, our government 
sent mixed signals to the American 
people about the sacrifices they must 
make in order to save, maybe, their 
lives and, if not, the lives of others. 
State leaders like my own Governor, 
Phil Murphy, stepped in to fill the 
leadership void. Earlier this week, he, 
along with the Governors of New York 
and Connecticut, imposed new restric-
tions on restaurants, shops, and other 
public gathering spaces. These are 
tough, unquestionably, but we need 
every New Jerseyan, as well as every 
American, to take Federal and State 
recommendations 
about 
social 
distancing seriously, avoiding gath-
erings of more than 10 people, washing 
your hands frequently, and if you feel 
sick, staying home and calling your 
healthcare provider immediately. 
We all need to be part of the solution 
or we can become part of the statistics. 
We all need to be part of the solution. 
This is one time in which we all must 
come together as Americans and be 
part of the solution so that we are not 
part of the statistics. 
Already families are feeling the im-
pact, whether in lost wages, smaller 
paychecks, school closures, restaurant 
curfews, or outright job losses. That is 
why I am calling on the Senate to act 
today—today—on legislation that will 
provide paid leave and unemployment 
assistance to impacted workers, food 
assistance to children and seniors, 
more funding for Medicaid. We cannot 
leave families alone to weather the 
storm. 
We also need to do more to help res-
taurants and shops and other busi-
nesses struggling with the economic 
fallout of the coronavirus from manda-
tory curfews to supply chain shortages, 
to decreased demand for their services. 
They need help. At the end of the day, 
we want them to be able to survive the 
crisis in order to offer the employment 
that will be necessary to revive the 
economy. 
But we must remember that this is 
first and foremost a public health cri-
sis. The wealth of our Nation will ulti-
mately depend on the health of our Na-
tion. Nothing economically will be 
solved without dealing with the health 
of the American people, and we cannot 
ignore the demands that COVID–19 will 
make on our healthcare sector and, es-
pecially, hospitals in the days and 
weeks to come. 
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention, the CDC, has projected 
that between 160 million and 214 mil-
lion people could contract COVID–19 in 
the United States and that between 2.4 
million and 21 million of those infected 
could require hospitalization. As a 
means of comparison, our hospital sys-
tem has less than 1 million staffed 
beds, which would be inadequate even 
under the CDC’s most optimistic pro-
jections. 
Hospitals must also have the re-
sources and equipment available to 
treat the expected influx of patients. 
There is a significant concern that the 
Nation’s supply of mechanical res-
pirators and ventilators is inadequate 
to meet the exponential need we will 
likely experience in the coming weeks 
and months. The latest data indicates 
that there may be only 62,000 hospital 
ventilators in the entire nation. Even

if only half of those hospitalized re-
quire ventilation, our supply would be 
wholly inadequate to fill the demand. 
Healthcare workers also need protec-
tive gear to do their lifesaving work 
without risking infection to them-
selves. Unfortunately, there have been 
multiple reports of shortages of per-
sonal protective equipment even dur-
ing the opening days of this outbreak. 
Failure 
to 
protect 
our 
healthcare 
workers and support staff would cause 
a cascading effect that would cause our 
entire response to collapse. 
Simply put, we need the Federal Gov-
ernment to step in and provide real 
leadership. In the midst of a pandemic, 
State and local governments should 
not be left on their own, scrambling to 
find or purchase ventilators for pa-
tients, personal protective gear for 
healthcare workers, and other critical 
medical supplies. The Federal Govern-
ment has a tremendous obligation and 
an opportunity to help save lives by as-
sisting State and local governments in 
locating resources, using existing au-
thorities to increase manufacturing of 
ventilators and other critical equip-
ment, and preparing for the staging of 
temporary hospitals and beds, and 
more. 
Let’s look at military facilities that 
have been closed. There is one in my 
State. Let’s open them up. Let’s con-
struct MASH units. Let’s not wait. 
Let’s rent out hotels that are closing. 
These are some of the many actions 
that can be taken if we are decisive in 
our work. That is why I am calling on 
the President to immediately exercise 
the powers authorized by the Defense 
Production Act to defend the health 
and safety of the American people in 
the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. 
While the administration’s response 
has so far lacked the energy this crisis 
calls for, invoking the powers vested in 
the Defense Production Act will enable 
the Federal Government to step up and 
take the types of aggressive steps need-
ed in this time of uncertainty. It is 
that act that can give the Federal Gov-
ernment the power to say: We are 
going to become your partner. We want 
to infuse massive amounts of money to 
create the ventilators that we need, 
the personal protective gear that we 
need, and if we can’t get you to 
produce it, we are going to produce it. 
We need to use the power of the Fed-
eral Government to have the type of 
response that this moment calls for, 
that this crisis calls for. That is what 
government in its most significant mo-
ment is supposed to be all about. That 
is really what the Federal Government 
is supposed to be all about. What 
States cannot individually do or indi-
vidual communities cannot do, it is the 
power of the Federal Government that 
can do it. We must be willing to mobi-
lize that power. 
It is time the United States of Amer-
ica live up to its history of defeating 
extraordinary 
challenges 
and 
pre-
vailing in the face of great uncer-
tainty. It is time to harness the inge-
nuity of our people, the might of our 
manufacturing base, and the wisdom of 
our healthcare experts to confront 
COVID–19 to protect our families and 
our communities, to slow the spread of 
the virus so we don’t overwhelm our 
hospitals so that we can save lives. 
I have seen some of the projections. I 
hope, for God’s sake, they are wrong. 
But we will lose many people unless we 
all take this seriously and unless we 
act. This is a moment for action and to 
show the world once again that there is 
no challenge too great for the Amer-
ican people. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alabama. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. JONES. Madam President, today 
I want to talk just briefly about all 
that we can do. I know we are facing an 
emergency in this country. We are fac-
ing a healthcare crisis. 
Instead of talking about all that is 
going on here in Congress—and there is 
a lot going on that the people of Amer-
ica need to understand. You see empty 
Chambers right now, but the fact is, we 
are trying to do those things necessary 
to stop the spread of this virus as well. 
I want to talk a little bit about what 
we can do as Americans to protect our-
selves and our country. In doing so, I 
am thinking back to an old friend of 
mine from my younger days. 
Back when I was a kid, the National 
Park Service and others were con-
cerned about the forest fires around 
the country, and they came up with 
what is now an old friend of mine: 
Smokey Bear. Everybody remembers 
Smokey Bear. You still see Smokey on 
occasion because only you can prevent 
forest fires. 
Well, folks, we have forest fires rag-
ing around this country right now in 
the form of COVID–19, and only you 
can prevent the spread of that forest 
fire, the COVID–19 virus—only you. We 
have healthcare responders out there. 
We have emergency responders, people 
who are doing amazing work right now 
responding to this virus. But it is up to 
us. It is up to you. Only you can pre-
vent the spread by doing those things 
necessary to try to protect your com-
munities. The social distancing that 
people are talking about, the hand 
washing—all of those things are so im-
portant that we have to do as individ-
uals to make sure we flatten that 
curve. 
You don’t need to be going on spring 
break or vacation right now—none of 
this. With shutting down these busi-
nesses and things and people being at 
home, this is not vacation time. You 
can use it, but it is not a time to go out 
on vacation, to do those kinds of 
things. It is a time to try to protect 
yourself and your communities. 
Don’t go out and try to get tested un-
less you have symptoms and have 
talked to your healthcare provider. In 
Alabama right now, we are seeing long 
lines of folks who are lined up at a pri-
vate testing facility to try to get test-
ed. I don’t know all the protocols that 
they have, but I know my friends at 
the University of Alabama in Bir-
mingham—in the infectious disease 
center—with whom I have met and 
talked on a regular basis, say that the 
odds are that a number of those people 
in those lines don’t need to test right 
now. They are concerned. Everybody is 
worried. Everybody wants to know. But 
the fact is, there are not enough tests 
out there for everyone just yet. We are 
getting there. More and more tests are 
coming online. 
We also have to be concerned about 
the equipment—the swabs that are 
used, the test tubes that have to be 
used. Those are the things we are run-
ning in short supply of as well. 
So unless you have those symptoms, 
unless you see that you are getting 
sick, stay home. Stay with your fami-
lies. We are going to be inconvenienced 
for some time, but I think we need to 
do all we can to make those inconven-
iences as short-lived as possible. The 
short-term pain will mean long-term 
gain for all of us, but only if we follow 
the best practices that the CDC and all 
our departments of public health are 
talking about right now. 
We have legislative packages that 
are coming over from the House. We 
have more. I can tell you, for my folks 
in Alabama and the folks across the 
United States, your U.S. Senators on 
both sides of the aisle are working very 
hard to try to minimize this impact. 
There are things we can do now, and we 
are trying to get those done. There are 
things we can do to take care of small 
businesses and families, and we are 
working very hard to make sure those 
things get done now. 
Also, keep this in mind: This is going 
to be a work in progress. This is not 
something we know the long-term im-
plications of just yet. Our goal is to 
blunt that curve, as you have seen Dr. 
Fauci and others talking about, to try 
to stem the tide of this virus, to make 
it to where it is going to be manage-
able in our healthcare systems. If we 
can do that, we can better assess how 
we can protect small businesses and 
how we can protect working families 
and make sure they have the income 
they need to get by on a daily basis, 
knowing that when this crisis does sub-
side, they can get back to work and we 
can get this economy popping, as the 
President said earlier today. That is 
our goal. That is what we are trying to 
do. 
We also have to take a deep look at 
ourselves, I believe. Folks across the 
country need to take a deep look and 
see what we can do as States, as Mem-
bers of Congress, and as American peo-
ple to do better on our healthcare sys-
tem, which right now is under increas-
ing strain and stresses with this pan-
demic virus. We need to see, struc-
turally, those kinds of things that can 
help stem the tide of this virus but also 
put in place things that are going to

help our healthcare delivery system 
that we have in this country. Those are 
the kinds of things I hope we will take 
a look at as we go forward and we bet-
ter understand the problems we are 
facing in the United States. 
For me, ever since I started running 
for this office, I have talked about the 
need to expand Medicaid in Alabama. 
Right now, I am concerned about all 
Alabamans, but there are some 326,000 
people below the poverty line who do 
not qualify for Medicaid and are won-
dering right now: What is going to hap-
pen to me? What is going to happen be-
cause I don’t have health insurance? I 
can’t go get in that line in Birmingham 
that requires a Medicaid or a Medicare 
card or an insurance card. I don’t know 
what to do. 
We are working on things to try to 
help to do that, but I think expanding 
Medicaid is an important part of this. 
Those Alabamans who are at most risk 
from the COVID–19 virus are those in 
rural areas where hospitals are closing 
and who cannot get to a doctor—the 
community health centers are sparsely 
situated throughout the State—our 
seniors and people of all ages who have 
preexisting conditions. 
I want folks in Alabama to really 
think about this. We have now heard 
for a month or so that it is not just the 
elderly but it is people with certain 
preexisting conditions who are at most 
risk for the COVID–19 virus and signifi-
cant complications from the virus. 
Those are people who are diabetic; peo-
ple with cardiovascular disease; people 
with kidney disease; people who are, in 
fact, so much of the demographics of 
the State of Alabama. 
I have said it so many times: We are 
a relatively poor State. We are an 
unhealthy State. We have more people 
at risk for this virus than probably 
most because of the preexisting condi-
tions that exist among the populace in 
the State of Alabama. Those are the 
ones about whom we are concerned. 
There are consequences to Alabama’s 
not expanding Medicaid, and there are 
going to be consequences if we don’t do 
things in the future to try to make 
sure we get relief to all people. 
There are going to be consequences if 
the administration continues to fight 
in court to eliminate the Affordable 
Care Act and all of its protections for 
those with preexisting conditions. Why 
in the world, in this time of healthcare 
crisis, would the administration con-
tinue to do this just now? Now is the 
time that we need to be putting law-
suits aside, taking those lawsuits and 
putting them away and working to-
gether to try to do those things within 
the ACA to get coverage for so many 
more people. We can do that. We are 
seeing people rallying now here on the 
Hill and with the administration. That 
is what we need to be doing, not trying 
to work through lawsuits to get rid of 
the ACA. 
Now is the time that we need to be 
working together to make sure every-
one in this country gets the healthcare 
they need. We need to expand Med-
icaid, work together to keep rural hos-
pitals open, and not dismantle the ACA 
but improve the flaws in the existing 
ACA, making sure that everyone with 
a preexisting condition is protected. 
So I am once again calling on this ad-
ministration, calling on the 20 attor-
neys general from around the coun-
try—including my own in the State of 
Alabama—let’s get rid of this, and let’s 
work together to try to figure out how 
we can get healthcare into all ZIP 
Codes in America, including all the ZIP 
Codes in the State of Alabama. 
Folks, we have amazing opportuni-
ties here. It is a challenging time, but 
challenges also give us opportunities. 
We need to take those opportunities. 
We have that opportunity here in the 
Senate and the Congress and the Gov-
ernment of the United States, but we 
have these opportunities as a country. 
We have these opportunities for indi-
viduals. 
We have to act quickly and without 
regard to politics or party. The Amer-
ican people are looking to us—they are 
looking to this Congress, they are 
looking to the administration—to do 
those things necessary, to take the 
steps necessary to protect their fami-
lies, their communities, their liveli-
hoods, and our economy. We can do 
this, but we need to rise to the occa-
sion. We need to work quickly. We need 
to put the American people first. It is 
the American people’s interests who 
have to come first. 
As individuals, we have to review the 
responses to the COVID crisis as an act 
of citizenship. Every response has to be 
seen, in my view, as an act of citizen-
ship, not only for this country but for 
citizens of the world, to do the things 
that need to be done for yourself, for 
your family, but also for each other in 
the greater beloved community. We 
have to recognize that we all must 
make sacrifices. We are in this to-
gether. 
Our doctors, our nurses, and our 
healthcare professionals are already 
doing that. They are fighting with ev-
erything they have to minimize the 
suffering and to save as many as they 
can, often putting themselves in jeop-
ardy. One of the things we have to do is 
give them more tools to do their jobs. 
We are working on that. But these 
folks are those frontline folks. 
It is just like the first responders of 
9/11, who were running toward the dan-
ger to try to help others flee from it. 
That is what our healthcare profes-
sionals and our first responders are 
doing today. They are running toward 
the danger to try to minimize the suf-
fering and to save lives. 
Folks, everybody in America needs to 
hear all of this. We need to be thanking 
those people. We need to be thanking 
the folks who are still putting food on 
the shelves at the grocery stores, the 
people who are still stocking the sani-
tizer at the drug stores, the people who 
are still doing those routine things to 
help all Americans. 
We need to hear this as well: Staying 
at home for the next few weeks may be 
a hardship, but it is the right thing to 
do. It is the right thing to do not just 
for the obvious reasons of protecting 
yourself. You do it for your neighbors. 
You do it for your fellow citizens in 
your community. You do it for your 
grandparents. You do it for all of those 
close to you. That is how we stop this 
virus. That is how Smokey puts out the 
forest fires. It is each one of us. Only 
you can do this, and none of it will be 
easy. 
Financial hardships will be faced by 
far too many Americans already living 
on the edge. It is in our local commu-
nities that we have to respond to the 
heroic efforts to bridge these hardships 
for as many as possible and to make 
this period of disruption as short as 
possible. 
The truth is, it is you, Mr. and Mrs. 
America. It is you, the American peo-
ple, who are the best defense now. You 
are the frontline. You are the foot sol-
diers of trying to stem this crisis. 
Don’t shake hands as some sign of 
strength. Stopping that simple contact 
is not only going to keep you safer but 
it is going to strengthen the fight to 
stop these fires. Do those little things. 
The American people have to rally to 
this challenge not just for themselves 
but for each other, for the sick and the 
elderly and the most vulnerable in our 
society, for the doctors and the nurses 
who are on the frontlines, for the chil-
dren who will need those school lunch 
programs 
they 
can’t 
get 
because 
schools are out all across this country. 
We do it for those who can’t afford 1 
day—let alone 1 week or 2 weeks or a 
couple of months—of lost wages. That 
is who we have to do this for. 
Let me mention something. I want to 
talk a little bit directly to the younger 
folks in Alabama and the younger folks 
in our country. You are perhaps the 
most powerful voices and examples in 
this fight. You know that it is not like-
ly that you are going to personally suf-
fer the hardest of these hardships in 
the sense of getting this virus. It is not 
going to cause the incredible complica-
tions of so many others, but that 
makes you the most powerful weapon 
that we have in this fight. You can lead 
this country’s war against this disease. 
You can lead the State of Alabama and 
all of your States and your commu-
nities, and you do so by example, just 
like young people have done in the his-
tory of this country. Whether it was 
with the Vietnam war, whether it was 
through civil rights, whether it was 
through little things like buckling 
seatbelts, it is the younger folks in this 
country who have led the way and 
shown the examples. You are the most 
connected generation or couple of gen-
erations in the history of the world. 
By having those connections to each 
other, you have connections to your 
communities and to your grandparents 
and to your parents and your aunts and 
your uncles and those living down the 
street who might be shut in at this

point—sick and shut in—whom you can 
help and get the word out to. 
This is the moment in time where we 
can come together as a people. We can 
come together, and you as young peo-
ple, who get so maligned in so many 
different ways—and I see that—you are 
the prime examples, and you can lead 
this country at a time when we des-
perately need all people in this country 
to lead by example and by information. 
I know you will step up to do it. I know 
you will make sure that your kids are 
protected, but I know you will also 
make sure that you do those things and 
do what Smokey the Bear says, be-
cause it is only you that can prevent 
the forest fire of this virus from 
spreading. 
So that is our challenge today. That 
is the challenge for America and the 
individuals. 
As a body, I can assure folks that the 
Senate and the Congress are going to 
do everything we can to do our part to 
minimize the damage that this is in-
flicting, to help repair the damage, to 
make sure that we get back on our feet 
at the right time when this fire is 
stemmed. What we know and what is 
demanded of us as a U.S. Senate, what 
is demanded of us as a government, is 
nothing short of the same kind of gov-
ernment response—overwhelming re-
sponse—the same kind of commitment 
and response worthy of the sacrifices 
we are asking all American citizens to 
make in this fight. I believe that this 
Senate, I believe that the House, and I 
believe that the administration are up 
to that challenge, but we have to re-
member whom we are fighting for, and 
that is each of you—the American peo-
ple. 
We will do our part. We will make 
sure what we do as a response to this is 
worthy of the sacrifices that we are 
asking each one of you to make every 
day for an unknown foreseeable time. 
I yield the floor. 
(Ms. MCSALLY assumed the Chair.) 
(Mr. SASSE assumed the Chair.) 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
MCSALLY). The Senator from Nebraska. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. SASSE. Madam President, we are 
in the midst of two crises at once—one 
health-related and one economic. I 
tend to think that the prudent path 
forward on the health front is that 
even as we hope for the best, we should 
continue planning for the worst. If this 
nasty disease continues to ramp in 
roughly the same proportions as it has 
in Italy and Spain, it will overwhelm 
our hospitals. So I think the social 
distancing recommendations from the 
President and from the CDC over the 
last 4 days are a prudent action. 
At the same time, we are also in the 
midst of a genuine economic crisis. 
Lots of moms and dads are worried 
that they might be laid off, and lots of 
businesses are evaluating whether they 
are going to make payroll and whether 
they are still going to be in business 
months down the line. They are scared, 
and DC needs to act more urgently 
than we usually do, but just saying we 
need to act urgently is not a substitute 
for actually having good ideas and ac-
tually advancing good policies. 
There is a herd mentality around this 
building right now where a lot of nor-
mally smart people are literally saying 
things like: The most important thing 
is to be fast, even if the ideas that are 
being advocated for are not really 
ready for prime time and can’t really 
withstand the scrutiny of debate. That 
is a really dumb idea. It is a ready-fire- 
aim approach. We do indeed need to 
work fast, but working fast is no sub-
stitute for working smart. 
Again, I agree that this virus and the 
strategies necessary to contain it are 
producing some of the worst economic 
upheavals we have seen in a genera-
tion. 
Further, we need to be preparing for 
these unexpected economic hardships 
to last for 6 months or even longer. But 
that fact is a reason to prepare; it is 
not a reason to panic. That fact is a 
reason to debate hard and fast but still 
to debate what good policy looks like; 
it is not a reason to allow garbage poli-
cies to get by because someone simply 
says: No, no, no, we have to go faster. 
You can’t ask questions about the pol-
icy. 
Over the next 48 to 72 hours, this 
body will be making some crucial deci-
sions about somewhere between one 
and four spending packages. I agree 
with the President that this is an un-
precedented economic situation and 
that the Federal Government, at the 
health level, obviously has a fundamen-
tally crucial role to play in helping us 
get through this pandemic, which rec-
ognizes no borders or boundaries; thus, 
the Federal Government has to spend 
real money. As the third or fourth 
most conservative Member of the Sen-
ate by voting record, that is not lan-
guage I use a lot, saying that we are 
going to have to spend real, significant 
amounts of money, but that is clearly 
true in this moment. But saying we 
should spend real money is not the 
same as saying we should spend like id-
iots. 
Unfortunately, Washington, DC, so 
far has been handling our responsibil-
ities exactly as a lot of voters fear. 
Right now, the proposal on the table, 
which just came over from the House of 
Representatives, is for Washington, 
DC, to pull out its checkbook—which is 
really your checkbook—and just start 
firing. If you are an industry with a 
good lobbying team, you are told to 
line up at the door of the Treasury De-
partment and get in line because bail-
out after bailout is probably in the off-
ing. 
Right now, the plan around here is 
basically just to start shoveling money 
out of a helicopter, and the most im-
portant debate is whether Democrats 
or Republicans get to shovel the money 
first. This is a bad idea, and Wash-
ington should know better because 12 
years ago something just like this was 
tried, and the consequences were really 
significant and lasting. They are still 
with us. 
I want to be clear. I am not talking 
primarily about the total price tag. 
The price tag matters, but the point I 
am trying to debate today is whether 
we are going to spend the American 
people’s money wisely or foolishly, and 
we are not having a lot of debate about 
that. We are hearing a lot of people 
saying that the only important ques-
tion is whether we can act fast enough. 
If you act fast but you spend money 
that is ineffective, you didn’t effec-
tively act fast. 
The Congress 12 years ago shoveled 
lots and lots of money into supposedly 
shovel-ready projects which still can’t 
be found today. One trillion dollars in 
spending, and you can go to your Gov-
ernor and you can go to your State leg-
islature 
and 
go 
to 
your 
business 
roundtables and you try to find people 
who know where the $1 trillion of shov-
el-ready money went—I challenge you, 
that is not an easy thing to achieve. 
More than just the spending and the 
debt, though, it also produced serious 
backlashes of national political move-
ments on both the right and the left. 
The Occupy Wall Street movement, 
some of which became the Bernie Sand-
ers constituency, and the tea party 
were both spawned out of 2008 and 2009 
and are still with us in lots of ways 
that are not ultimately constructive 
for our body politic. 
We don’t need a policy where Wash-
ington, DC, handpicks winners and los-
ers. There is no one here in this Cham-
ber who is actually competent to do 
that. We are indeed in a period of ex-
traordinary uncertainty, but no politi-
cian actually knows what happens next 
week, let alone 6 months from now, and 
humility would require us to admit 
that a bit more. 
The proposal currently on the table 
from Speaker NANCY PELOSI is to blow 
through a massive amount of money on 
a policy core that isn’t actually well 
thought out. When you ask hard ques-
tions about the bill that has come over 
from the House, there is nobody who 
actually defends it as really good, well- 
thought-out policy. That is why the 
first version of their bill, which passed 
so urgently last week at 120 pages, last 
night required over 90 pages—we are 
right at 90 pages—of technical correc-
tions. Think about that. Imagine your 
kid does homework and—you say you 
wrote a 12-page essay, and after you 
turn it in, you say that 9 of the 12 
pages actually have to be thrown away 
and rewritten. That is what happened 
last night in the House of Representa-
tives. They tried to pass a 90-page fix 
to a 120-page bill that was supposedly 
really urgent last week. 
By the way, when you talk to the ar-
chitects of that legislation in private, 
when the cameras aren’t rolling, and 
you ask them hard questions about 
how their policy actually works, every-
one starts pointing at everyone else,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1776 
March 17, 2020 
and a lot of people admit that the bill 
might actually accelerate layoffs from 
small businesses. Think about that. 
The reason this first bill—if it ends 
up remaining independent rather than 
being bundled with the other ideas that 
are coming down the road in the form 
of industry-specific bailouts—this first 
bill, which is supposed to slow the pace 
of layoffs from small business, when 
you ask questions about it, the archi-
tects of the bill will admit to you in 
private that it might actually accel-
erate the pace of layoffs from small 
business. Nonetheless, despite admit-
ting that today’s version of the Rube 
Goldberg policy might have the oppo-
site of its intended effect, the main an-
swer you get is ‘‘We have to go very, 
very fast.’’ This is wildly irresponsible, 
what is happening here. 
Once the first couple hundred billion 
dollars of money is gone, that means 
there is less money left for the next 
round of stimulus and action and re-
covery and relief that are required. But 
besides money, it also means that 
there is less public trust left. There are 
gonna be more rainy days ahead in the 
coming weeks and months, and there is 
not a lot of grassroots American trust 
in the wisdom or the work ethic of this 
institution. Simply screaming that we 
should go faster is not a substitute for 
debating and advocating for the actual 
policy. 
We have many politicians pretending 
right now that they know how to cen-
trally plan rifle-shot bailouts industry 
by industry. It is not true, and even 
they don’t believe it. This is a game of 
pretend: Hurry up and look busy. If you 
are not sure what to do, just spend 
more of the people’s money, but do it 
faster. 
That is not good policy. That is not 
good stewardship of our responsibility. 
The Senate is supposed to exist to calm 
down the passions that lead the House 
to move fast and write policy that is 
bad enough that a 120-page bill requires 
90 pages of technical fixes. The Sen-
ate’s actual job in our bicameral con-
stitutional structure is to ask hard 
questions of legislation just like this. 
Here is the good news: We don’t have 
to mindlessly go down this path again. 
We can do better than this. We can af-
firm the policy goal that we do need to 
help get resources to the people who 
need them, but we can also make 
smarter, more responsible, less risky 
decisions right now that will provide a 
lifeline to people in need but will also 
leave room for further action in the fu-
ture, hopefully, as we know more in 
the coming days and weeks. 
So here is an alternate idea: Instead 
of DC pretending it is omnicompetent, 
let’s admit that a complex situation 
like what is actually happening in the 
small business environment in all 50 of 
our States will actually require dif-
ferentiated solutions. Let’s be sure we 
are accurately naming the problem 
here, because I am not talking now 
about the public health issues, like 
speeding 
the 
development 
of 
a 
coronavirus vaccine, where DC obvi-
ously needs to maintain a leading role, 
but I am talking precisely about the 
economic problem of the next 90 days. 
What is that economic problem? The 
question before us is, How do we mini-
mize the number of layoffs, and how do 
we minimize the number of small busi-
ness bankruptcies that are looming 
across our country? How do we make 
sure that more families can keep put-
ting bread on the table rather than be-
coming long-term dependencies on the 
State? We should be laser-focused on 
what the question is that we are actu-
ally debating in this Chamber this 
week. That is the question. Over the 
next 90 days, are there policy steps we 
can take to minimize the number of 
bankruptcies and layoffs that are going 
to affect American families so pain-
fully? 
Here are some needed truths: The 
feds don’t know the precise answer be-
cause there isn’t a single precise an-
swer. The answers—plural—are going 
to vary across our continent-sized Na-
tion of 325 million souls. If we pretend 
that we have a one-size-fits-all solution 
for this problem or if we pretend that 
DC can be fair, going industry by in-
dustry with rifle-targeted bailouts, we 
are going to screw up badly. The lobby-
ists are going to dominate the day, not 
the public interests. 
Again, I am open to spending in this 
moment, but that is not an excuse for 
failing to spend well. We need to spend 
the people’s money well, we need to 
steward our callings with humility, 
and we need to spend much better than 
this current House bill does. 
Let’s take the money that is being 
proposed and let’s direct more than 
half of it to our Governors so they may 
distribute it to families and small busi-
nesses. 
I trust Pete Ricketts, who is my Gov-
ernor. I trust Pete Ricketts a heck of a 
lot more than I trust NANCY PELOSI. 
Part of it is that Pete and I have more 
aligned political philosophies, but that 
is not really the point. The real reason 
I trust Pete Ricketts at this moment is 
the same reason why Senator FEIN-
STEIN would trust Gavin Newsom at the 
moment, and that is because my Gov-
ernor is on the ground with his 1.9 mil-
lion people. He is not in DC looking 
across a 325-million-person nation as if 
our problems are undifferentiated and 
as if the solutions can be one-size-fits- 
all. That is not going to work. That is 
going to waste the vast majority of the 
people’s resources. We have 50 different 
States with 50 different circumstances 
and needs. Californians have needs that 
Nebraskans don’t in this moment and 
vice versa. We can get money to the 
Governors quickly, and they can dis-
tribute it in ways that will best help 
their people. 
The 
House’s 
one-size-fits-all 
ap-
proach, this nationalized leave policy 
in this first bundled bill, is going to 
cause a lot of people to fall through the 
cracks. Why is it that different indus-
tries and different-sized firms are being 
treated so radically different? It is be-
cause of who was last in the Speaker’s 
office lobbying about the bill as they 
cobbled together the first 120 pages 
that needed 90 pages of corrections. 
The Rube Goldberg bill is going to 
create a handful of political winners, 
but it is going to create a whole lot 
more economic losers. 
Parts of these relief packages will 
need to come from DC in targeted 
ways; I admit that. Part of this is 
going to need to come from DC, but the 
idea that all of it can or that all of it 
should is arrogant. It is wrong, and it 
will be ineffective. 
Our Governors know their States and 
their people. Our Governors know how 
to build public-private partnerships. 
Congress doesn’t. Our Governors know 
so much better than we do what their 
workforce 
needs 
were 
before 
the 
coronavirus struck and what their 
workforce needs are going to be in late 
Q3 or in Q4 when, hopefully, the econ-
omy is humming again. Simply put, 
our Governors know how to target this 
money much more efficiently than we 
do so that much more of that money 
will make its way to Main Street. 
Lots of Governors have led well in 
the past 3 weeks. I mentioned my Gov-
ernor, Pete Ricketts, and how his 
strong leadership has been laying the 
groundwork to help shield our State 
from some of the worst ravages of this 
virus. Likewise, I would recognize Gov-
ernor DeWine from Ohio, who is show-
ing strong leadership on what it looks 
like to put facts front and center. 
What we need right now at the State, 
at the local, and at the Federal levels 
is not just any action. We need respon-
sible, effective, defensible action. This 
is not a time for Washington to go on 
an ‘‘anything goes’’ spending spree. It 
is not an opportunity for Washington’s 
connected insiders to exploit personal 
relationships to put their pet projects 
first on things that they wouldn’t have 
been able to get passed if it weren’t a 
time of crisis. We don’t have to go 
down that path. 
Instead, we can more efficiently and 
more wisely spend the people’s re-
sources. We can give our States and 
our Governors the lead in making sure 
that the majority of the money and the 
majority of the resources get where 
they are most needed. We can help fam-
ilies and businesses keep afloat during 
this storm by admitting that 50 labora-
tories of democracy are going to be 
more effective than a rifle shot ap-
proach from Washington. We can cre-
ate room for further action, but we can 
also acknowledge that the particular 
needs are going to evolve in the coming 
weeks. 
We need less instant certainty and 
more humility in this building. We 
should not pretend that the only gov-
ernment is the Federal Government. 
Congress should eat more humble pie. 
There is a reason why even the least 
popular Governor in America is more 
popular than almost everyone who 
works in this Chamber. There is a rea-
son for that, and the main reason is

S1777 
March 17, 2020 
that while Members of Congress spend 
lots of our time playing pundit, sadly, 
Governors actually lead. They manage 
budgets; they make decisions; they 
lead departments; and they engage 
their community in the actual private 
sector, not just hire lobbyists who 
work for the private sector. They are 
physically on the ground with the peo-
ple they serve. That means they know 
a thing or two about the businesses in 
their community. It means they know 
a thing or two about the industries 
that are rising and falling in their cit-
ies and in their rural areas. They have 
a kind of decentralized knowledge 
about this crisis and what is needed at 
this moment that people in Wash-
ington, DC, lack. 
Cable news is focused on Wall Street, 
but here is the deal: Main Street is 
going to be the place where lots of the 
pain is ultimately shouldered from this 
crisis, and when Wall Street needs 
something, Wall Street hires K Street, 
and Congress is told by K Street what 
they want, and that is usually what 
ends up in the bill. 
When Main Street needs something, 
they drive to Lincoln; they drive to In-
dianapolis and Nashville and Columbus 
and Albany and Sacramento; and the 
granular understanding of their par-
ticular problems is almost always more 
nuanced than is understood here. 
That is why, as long as Congress is 
debating this spending this week, I am 
going to be fighting to make sure that 
we give more than half of all this 
money to our Governors to distribute. 
They know how to spend this money 
better than this DC-centric House of 
Representatives bill. That is the way 
we can actually get this done and help 
our people grit through this time of un-
precedented economic uncertainty.

SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS 
SENATE 
RESOLUTION 
545—COM-
MEMORATING MARCH 17, 2020, AS 
THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 
REFUGEE ACT OF 1980, INCLUD-
ING THE AMENDMENTS MADE BY 
THAT ACT, AT A TIME WHEN 
THE 
NEED 
FOR 
BIPARTISAN 
SUPPORT OF THE REFUGEE RE-
SETTLEMENT PROGRAM OF THE 
UNITED STATES IS CRITICAL TO 
THE 
SURVIVAL 
OF 
THE 
PRO-
GRAM 
Mr. COONS (for himself and Mr. 
LANKFORD) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 545 
Whereas, after receiving bipartisan support 
in both the Senate and the House of Rep-
resentatives, the Refugee Act of 1980, S. 643 
(96th Congress), including the amendments 
made by that Act, was signed into law on 
March 17, 1980, to provide a domestic frame-
work for the United States to align with the 
international 
obligations 
of 
the 
United 
States, including under— 
(1) the Convention Relating to the Status 
of Refugees, done at Geneva July 28, 1951 (as 
made applicable by the Protocol Relating to 
the Status of Refugees, done at New York 
January 31, 1967 (19 U.S.T. 6223), to which the 
United States is a party); 
(2) the Convention against Torture and 
Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treat-
ment or Punishment, done at New York De-
cember 10, 1984, to which the United States is 
a party; 
(3) the Convention Relating to the Status 
of Stateless Persons, done at New York Sep-
tember 28, 1954; and 
(4) the Convention on the Reduction of 
Statelessness, done at New York August 30, 
1961; 
Whereas the humanitarian protection pro-
vided by the Refugee Act of 1980 (Public Law 
96–212; 94 Stat. 102), including the amend-
ments made by that Act, is consistent with 
the best values of the United States, such as 
judging people not ‘‘by the color of their 
skin but by the content of their character’’, 
championing religious liberty, standing up 
for one’s beliefs, standing up for those who 
are being mistreated, championing democ-
racy, and upholding the rights and practices 
of self-governance and free speech regardless 
of race, ethnicity, or nationality; 
Whereas refugees are courageous, hard- 
working people of conviction and values, de-
fenders of democracy and faith, and people 
who face persecution on account of race, reli-
gion, nationality, membership in a par-
ticular social group, or political opinion, and 
in some cases, face persecution because they 
allied with the United States in crucial mis-
sions, such as in Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, 
Iraq, and Afghanistan; 
Whereas the refugee resettlement program 
of the United States authorized under the 
Refugee Act of 1980 (Public Law 96–212; 94 
Stat. 102), including the amendments made

by that Act, is a life-saving solution critical 
to global humanitarian efforts that— 
(1) strengthens global security; 
(2) advances the foreign policy goals and 
national security interests of the United 
States; 
(3) supports countries that host hundreds 
of thousands, or even millions, of refugees; 
(4) collaborates with and supports the ef-
forts of the international community to sup-
port and resettle vulnerable populations; 
(5) stabilizes sensitive conflicts and regions 
around the globe; and 
(6) encourages other countries to con-
tribute through humanitarian support, reset-
tlement, and finding strategies to address ex-
isting conflict and prevent future conflict; 
Whereas the refugee resettlement program 
provides protection and resettlement oppor-
tunities to individuals from Iraq and Afghan-
istan who worked side by side with members 
of the United States Armed Forces and peace 
builders; 
Whereas the Department of State acknowl-
edged the partnership between the admission 
of refugees and the protection of inherent 
human rights in the 2018 Report on Inter-
national Religious Freedom and the 2018 
Country Reports on Human Rights Practices; 
Whereas refugees are major contributors to 
local economies, pay an average of $21,000 
more in taxes than they receive in benefits, 
and revitalize cities and towns by offsetting 
population decline and boosting economic 
growth throughout the United States by 
opening businesses, paying taxes, and buying 
homes; 
Whereas several industries rely heavily on 
refugee workers to support the economic sta-
bility of those industries, and low rates of 
arrivals of refugees, especially in towns that 
rely on refugee populations to revitalize the 
industries in those towns, have had serious 
effects on economic growth; 
Whereas, through the refugee resettlement 
program, the United States has proudly pur-
sued strategic and humanitarian interests, 
resettling more than 3,000,000 refugees in 49 
States over more than 40 years, and the pro-
gram has received support from Republican 
and Democratic Presidential administra-
tions and bipartisan congressional support, 
as Presidents have set, through Presidential 
determinations, an average annual refugee 
admissions goal of 95,000 refugees; 
Whereas, in collaboration with the Depart-
ment of State and through the Office of Ref-
ugee Resettlement, faith communities, civic 
leaders, local social service agencies, em-
ployers, and refugee resettlement agencies 
provide essential services and welcome refu-
gees who bring new life and vitality to local 
communities; 
Whereas, in 2020, the world is in the midst 
of the worst global displacement crisis in 
history, with more than 70,800,000 forcibly 
displaced 
persons, 
including 
more 
than 
25,900,000 refugees worldwide, more than 1⁄2 of 
whom are children, according to estimates 
from the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Refugees; 
Whereas, in 2018, global resettlement needs 
were not met despite the high number of ref-
ugees in need of third-country resettlement; 
Whereas a decline in refugee resettlements 
has had adverse impacts on the infrastruc-
ture of refugee resettlement in the United 
States, creating challenges for future in-
creases in resettlement; 
Whereas 
many 
Presidents 
have 
made 
changes and improvements to the refugee re-
settlement program while continuing to sup-
port and nurture its crucial role in humani-
tarian protection and in promoting the na-
tional security and strategic interests of the 
United States; 
Whereas refugees are the most thoroughly 
vetted class of foreign nationals to enter the 
United States and are subject to extensive 
screening checks, including in-person inter-
views, biometric data checks, and multiple 
interagency checks; and 
Whereas, as the major global humanitarian 
and strategic leader, the United States 
should operate its refugee resettlement pro-
gram in a manner consistent with global ref-
ugee resettlement need, the historical com-
mitment of the United States to refugee re-
settlement since the enactment of the Ref-
ugee Act of 1980 (Public Law 96–212; 94 Stat. 
102), and the critical humanitarian leader-
ship role of the United States on the world 
stage: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) reaffirms its bipartisan commitment— 
(A) to abide by the cherished domestic and 
international legal obligations of the United 
States to protect refugees who flee war, per-
secution, or torture in search of religious lib-
erty, democracy, peace, hope, and freedom; 
and 
(B) to recognize the importance of the ref-
ugee resettlement program of the United 
States as a critical tool for saving lives and 
as a critical function of United States global 
leadership— 
(i) to leverage foreign policy; 
(ii) to strengthen national and regional se-
curity; 
(iii) to support allies of the United States; 
and 
(iv) to demonstrate international support 
of refugees; and 
(2) calls upon the United States Govern-
ment— 
(A) to provide robust funding for refugee 
protection overseas and resettlement in the 
United States; 
(B) to uphold its international leadership 
role in responding to displacement crises 
with humanitarian assistance and protection 
of the most vulnerable populations; 
(C) to work in partnership with the inter-
national community to find solutions to ex-
isting conflicts and prevent new conflicts 
from beginning; and 
(D) to ensure the refugee resettlement pro-
gram of the United States is equipped to pro-
tect and support refugees, especially allies 
who need the support of the United States, 
as well as the international refugee assist-
ance community that needs United States 
leadership, and local communities across the 
United States who want to welcome refugees 
and continue together to build the American 
dream.
