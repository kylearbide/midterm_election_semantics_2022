PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick

Lord of the universe, father of us all, 
we thank You for giving us another 
day. 
As citizens continue to gather to ex-
press their frustration with so many 
ills in our time, imbue them with an 
increased sense of responsibility and 
good judgment that those who would 
engage in violence and destruction 
might be marginalized. 
Send Your spirit among Your people 
that we might be our best selves as 
members of an American community 
dedicated to constitutional norms of 
behavior and process. 
Fill all Members of Congress and the 
President with wisdom and a sense of 
shared purpose in providing the leader-
ship needed to steer through the 
treacherous seas of unease during the 
pandemic and its resultant effects. 
Continue to bless those who labor to 
attend to the sick among our citizens 
and those also who strive to find effec-
tive treatments and vaccines. 
Comfort those who are ill and those 
who mourn the loss of loved ones. Keep 
us all safe in Your divine mercy. 
May all that is done be for Your 
greater honor and glory. 
Amen.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
LIFE 
AND 
SERVICE 
OF 
WILLIAM 
JOHN 
BETTERS 
HON. THEODORE E. DEUTCH 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 1, 2020 
Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, today I rise 
to honor the late William John Betters for his 
distinguished service to our country and his 
community. 
Born on December 1, 1924, William is a 
World War II veteran, having served in the 
U.S. Air Force from 1942–1945. Like many of 
his fellow Americans at the time, William was 
proud to enlist at the young age of 17. During 
his service he was awarded the World War II 
Victory Medal, the American Campaign Medal, 
the European African Middle Eastern Cam-
paign Medal and the Purple Heart. 
After returning from serving his country, Wil-
liam created a business as self-employed 
plumber and contractor, building housing in his 
hometown. He also devoted his life to family, 
marrying Eleanor Kurkoski in 1946, having 3 
children, 3 grandchildren, and two great- 
grandchildren. One of his granddaughters has 
followed in his footsteps and is serving our 
country as a member of the Pennsylvania Na-
tional Guard. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing the life and service of Wil-
liam John Betters. 
f 
CONGRATULATING BECKY SHEA 
HON. EARL L. ‘‘BUDDY’’ CARTER 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 1, 2020 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor Ms. Becky Shea, who re-
cently retired from the Effingham County 
Chamber of Commerce. 
Ms. Shea worked with the Chamber for over 
7 years and served as the Office Manager and 
Membership Director. 
Although she was set to retire from the 
chamber last year, she decided to stay to help 
with the transition to the newest Chamber 
leader, who is now Andrew Cripps. Thanks to 
Becky’s efforts to maintain the productivity and 
organization of the office as a whole, the 
Chamber was able to adapt to the leadership 
change and address the challenges from 
COVID–19 effectively. 
Throughout Ms. Shea’s service to the 
Effingham Chamber of Commerce, she deliv-
ered exceptional results for all who worked 
with her. Becky approached every day with a 
can-do attitude and always went above and 
beyond to help make Effingham live up to its 
full potential. 
Her dedicated leadership set a positive ex-
ample for all, and she will be greatly missed 
by the Effingham Chamber of Commerce. 
HONORING KEN THOMAS 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 1, 2020 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize the outstanding achievements of 
Ken Thomas, a career Legislative Attorney 
with the American Law Division of the Con-
gressional Research Service (CRS), who re-
tired from CRS on August 28, 2020, after 36 
years of distinguished government service. In 
his 33 years with CRS, Ken became the lead-
ing expert on constitutional law, and he made 
invaluable contributions to the work of Con-
gress with his substantive knowledge in var-
ious legal areas. He advised Congress on 
statehood and other political status changes 
for the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, 
federalism, individual and civil rights, criminal 
law and procedure, the federal judiciary and 
education law. 
Over the years, House and Senate commit-
tees called on Ken to testify at hearings and 
share with them his expertise and non-par-
tisan analysis of important issues. Last year, 
for example, the House Committee on Over-
sight and Reform invited Ken to testify at a 
hearing on the Washington, D.C. Admission 
Act (H.R. 51). During the course of this high- 
profile and contentious hearing, Ken answered 
numerous questions from Members about the 
constitutionality of granting statehood to the 
District of Columbia, key to passage of H.R. 
51 by the House in June. 
My staff and I, in particular, relied on Ken 
for his analysis of legal issues involving the 
uniquely complicated relationship between the 
federal government and the District of Colum-
bia, ranging from constitutional law to the Dis-
trict of Columbia Home Rule Act to appropria-
tions law. Ken always provided prompt, well- 
reasoned and well-researched legal analysis. 
The following is a recommendation for one 
of the 28 CRS awards that Ken received: 
During his tenure in the American Law Di-
vision, Ken Thomas demonstrated a level of 
energy and dedication to the mission of serv-
ing Congress that has been extraordinary. He 
has willingly and without hesitation under-
taken challenging and difficult assignments 
from the Congress. He has been a prolific 
writer and has provided comprehensive and 
in-depth legal research and analysis in a 
number of legal areas . . . . He is always 
available for and capable of tackling new 
issues, especially those that pose complex 
constitutional questions. He regularly dem-
onstrates a high degree of intellectual curi-
osity, a trait that inspires him to ‘‘go the 
extra mile’’ for his congressional clients. 
During his career with CRS, Ken prepared 
over 200 written products for Congress, many 
of which have been cited in the CONGRES-
SIONAL RECORD, committee reports and con-
gressional hearings. Academic law reviews 
and national publications, such as The Wash-
ington Post, The Wall Street Journal and The 
National Journal, have also cited his work. 
Ken has also delivered many keynote Con-
tinuing Legal Education lectures sponsored by 
CRS to positive reviews. 
From 1996 through 2013, Ken was one of 
the key contributors to the Senate document 
‘‘The Constitution of the United States of 
America: Analysis and Interpretation’’ (Con-
stitution Annotated), serving as the Editor-in- 
Chief of the 2012 Centennial version of that 
volume, and he was the prime architect of the 
Constitution Annotated website. A public 
version 
of 
that 
website, 
constitu-
tion.congress.gov, was launched on Constitu-
tion Day 2019, and in the last 10 months, has 
had over 500,000 visits and one million page 
views. 
Ken received a B.A. in philosophy from 
Colby College in 1980 and a J.D. from The 
George Washington University in 1983. He 
worked at the U.S. Department of Education 
and as a clerk to Judge Bruce Mencher of the 
D.C. Superior Court before joining CRS. Ken 
has provided exemplary service to Congress 
throughout his distinguished career at CRS. I 
believe that all in Congress who have bene-
fitted from his expertise and counsel join me 
in wishing him the very best in the years to 
come.

HEALTH 
SYSTEM 
HON. STEVEN M. PALAZZO 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 1, 2020 
Mr. PALAZZO. Madam Speaker, today I rise 
to recognize Mr. Lee Bond and Singing River 
Health System for their outstanding service to 
the community of the Mississippi Gulf Coast. 
Mr. Bond has significant family roots on the 
Gulf Coast. He was born at Singing River

elor of Science degree in Accounting from the 
University of South Alabama, where he grad-
uated Summa Cum Laude. 
Mr. Bond is currently the Chief Executive 
Officer at Singing River Health System. Out-
side of work, he has held community leader-
ship roles in both Jackson and Harrison Coun-
ties. He has served on the Gulf Coast Busi-
ness Council, the Bacot McCarty Foundation, 
the Pascagoula River Audubon Center, Ducks 
Unlimited Gulf Coast Chapter, the Board of Di-
rectors for the Jackson County Chamber of 
Commerce, as well as the Past President of 
the Gulf Coast Chapter of Mississippi Society 
of CPAs. Mr. Bond is a graduate of Leader-
ship Jackson County, and was humbly recog-
nized as a Top 10 Outstanding Community 
Leader for South Mississippi. 
During these unprecedented times, Mr. 
Bond and the entire Singing River Health Sys-
tem has gone above and beyond to help the 
community suffering from this global pan-
demic.

COVID–19 provider on the Gulf Coast. It has 
cared for over 2,200 patients diagnosed with 
the virus. In response to the increased de-
mand, it continues to make improvements to 
its critical care nursing units to meet the needs 
of the most ill patients, has established com-
munity-based clinical patient navigators to

Mr. Bond credits the entire Singing River 
care and support services team for their ef-
forts to deliver lifesaving care to those hit 
hardest by the virus and continue to be their

CONGRATULATING PATRICK 
ROMEO 
HON. TIM RYAN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 1, 2020 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
congratulate Mr. Patrick Romeo, of Boardman, 
Ohio, on completing the Hoka Hey Motorcycle 
Challenge in Panama City, Florida, this Au-
gust. 
Being one of a hundred motorcyclists trav-
eling 10,000 miles on a country-wide, 13-day 
journey, Patrick embarked on an excursion in-
tended to raise awareness for veterans with 
traumatic brain injuries. This endurance chal-
lenge was aimed at testing the physical, men-
tal, and emotional limits of all participants. 
Mr. 
Romeo 
demonstrated 
extraordinary 
leadership along with outstanding integrity and 
values, qualities that empower and inspire in-
dividuals and families to overcome their phys-
ical, mental, or financial challenges. 
Resurrecting Lives Foundation, an Ohio- 
based nonprofit founded by Youngstown na-
tive Dr. Chrisanne Gordon, was Patrick’s des-
ignated charity. So far, Mr. Romeo has been 
able to help raise $16,000 for the charity, 
which advocates for veterans with traumatic 
brain injuries. 
The dedication and enthusiasm Patrick di-
rected towards this once-in-a-lifetime oppor-
tunity has left a positive impact upon the com-
munity. Patrick, you are truly an inspiration to 
all of us who serve the public, and for that, I 
am forever grateful.

HONORING 
THE 
50TH 
ANNIVER-
SARY OF UGA MARINE EXTEN-
SION AND GEORGIA SEA GRANT 
HON. EARL L. ‘‘BUDDY’’ CARTER 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 1, 2020 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor the University of Georgia 
Marine Extension and Georgia Sea Grant for 
celebrating the 50th year since its founding. 
In 1970, the University of Georgia initiated a 
marine extension service program with startup 
funds to assist the Cooperative Extension 
Service provided to agriculture. Edward Chin 
led the original program, and also had respon-
sibility for coordinating the university’s marine 
programs on Sapelo Island and Skidaway Is-
land. 
Today, the UGA Marine Extension and 
Georgia Sea Grant provides research, edu-
cation, and training in science to assist Geor-
gia in solving problems and recognizing oppor-
tunities for its coastal and marine environ-
ments. 
Because of all the exceptional work they 
have done throughout the years, they have 
helped promote the economic, cultural, and 
environmental health of Georgia’s coast. They 
have also aided in preparing Georgians to be-
come good stewards of coastal ecosystems 
and watershed resources. 
The Georgia Sea Grant College Program is 
part of a national network of 34 Sea Grant 
programs located in every coastal and Great 
Lakes state, Puerto Rico, Lake Champlain, 
and Guam. This program is among a network 
of over 300 institutions involving more than 
3,000 scientists, engineers, educators, stu-
dents, and outreach experts. 
As the Representative for Georgia’s coast, I 
can’t thank them enough for the work they 
have done to help improve our environment to 
support Georgia’s short- and long-term pros-
perity.

REMEMBERING RONNIE KOLE 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 1, 2020 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I would like to take the time to re-
member Ronnie Kole for his contribution to the 
musical community and his charitable work. I 
include in the RECORD the following article 
‘‘Ronnie Kole, renowned New Orleans pianist 
who performed for 6 presidents and a pope, 
dead at 89’’ by Dominic Massa on August 
28th from the The New Orleans Advocate: 
Ronnie Kole, the renowned New Orleans pi-
anist who performed for six presidents, a 
pope and audiences around the world, died 
Thursday. He was 89. 
Kole, a consummate entertainer known for 
his boundless energy, had been in declining 
health but stopped performing only recently, 
according to his son. Kole’s wife of 36 years, 
Gardner, died this past January. 
Kole’s career spanned nearly 70 years and 
took him to Carnegie Hall, concert venues 
and music clubs across the United States, 
Europe and Asia. He recorded dozens of al-
bums and was a frequent performer in New 
Orleans, where he settled in the 1960s before 
moving to Slidell some 30 years ago. 
Kole—who was tall, lanky, goateed and al-
ways immaculately dressed—entertained six 
U.S. presidents during his career. In 1987, he 
performed ‘‘Amazing Grace’’ for Pope John 
Paul II during the Holy Father’s visit to New 
Orleans. Kole performed at the outdoor Mass 
celebrated by the pope near the UNO Lake-
front Arena. Accompanied by a symphony 
orchestra and a 350-voice choir, Kole called 
the performance ‘‘the way I’ve always envi-
sioned doing ‘Amazing Grace,’ ’’ mixing the 
hymn with bits of ‘‘Jesus Christ Superstar’’ 
and the ‘‘Hallelujah Chorus.’’ 
The song was a hallmark of most every 
Ronnie Kole concert. His set lists showcased 
a diverse range of musical genres from mod-
ern and traditional jazz to show tunes, clas-
sical music and everything in between. A 
typical show might feature ‘‘Rhapsody in 
Blue,’’ ‘‘Somewhere Over the Rainbow,’’ 
‘‘What a Wonderful World,’’ selections from 
Mozart or Beethoven, ‘‘Ave Maria’’ and a 
souped-up version of ‘‘When the Saints Go 
Marching ln,’’ just to name a few. In between 
songs at his concerts, he would frequently 
entertain his audience with jokes, anecdotes, 
self-deprecating asides and musical history 
lessons. 
‘‘My feeling is, anything your mind can 
think of, you can put down on a piano,’’ he 
said in a 2004 Times-Picayune profile. ‘‘To 
me, a piano is an orchestra. It’s a very imag-
inative instrument that you can do most 
anything on, which I try to do. I try not to 
have limitations. I have a lot of fun with it. 
I love to entertain.’’ 
According to Times-Picayune music writer 
Keith Spera, Kole was renowned for his 
showstopping, all-request Broadway medley, 
which concluded with him playing the main 
melodic theme with his left hand and a suc-
cession of requested melodies with his 
right—simultaneously. 
Kole was a founder of French Quarter Fes-
tival, performing at the first event in 1984 
and every festival since. He was scheduled to 
perform at this year’s French Quarter Fest, 
as well as at the New Orleans Jazz and Herit-
age Festival, both of which were canceled be-
cause of the coronavirus pandemic. Kole had 
performed at nearly every New Orleans Jazz 
and Heritage Festival since its inception in 
1970 and played at the modern event’s pre-
cursor, the 1968 New Orleans Jazz Festival. 
Born Ronald Kuhn, Kole was a native of 
Chicago. He suffered from a heart condition 
as a child, which limited his outdoor activi-
ties. ‘‘When I was feeling good, I wanted to 
go outside and play ball, but when I was sick 
I was sometimes laid up for a month and a 
half, two months in bed,’’ he said in a 2012 
WWNO-FM interview. ‘‘My aunt played piano 
by ear and she had a big old upright piano. 
She showed me how to play ‘Chopsticks’ . . . 
and my mother and father said, ‘Maybe we 
should get him a piano. That would keep him 
from wanting to go outside to play base-
ball.’ ’’ 
Kole recalled first tickling the ivories 
around the age of 13 and considered himself 
largely self-taught. He went on the road in 
the Midwest to perform when he was just 16. 
Kole first came to New Orleans in 1957 to 
audition as part of a jazz trio. He didn’t get 
the job but he fell in love with the city. 
While back in Chicago, he crossed paths 
with New Orleans music great Al Hirt. Al-
though Kole had already toured the country 
and made somewhat of a name for himself as 
a young jazzman, he was uncertain of his ca-
reer path. Hirt, a nationally known jazz 
trumpeter, encouraged Kole’s career and 
gave it a major jump start by asking him to 
bring his ensemble to New Orleans in 1964 to 
serve as the house band for Hirt’s Bourbon 
Street club. 
‘‘I guess I owe everything to Al for bring-
ing me down,’’ Kole said in 1987. ‘‘And also 
for kicking me in the fanny a year or so 
prior to that, when I had totally given up 
and decided to play solo in a restaurant 
piano bar thing.’’ 
Kole worked at Hirt’s club for several 
years before opening his own club, Kole’s 
Korner, where he performed for six years. 
‘‘Man, I’m treated like a hometown boy 
here,’’ Kole said of the city in a 1967 Times- 
Picayune profile. ‘‘The people are wonder-
ful—even the club operators on Bourbon 
Street—there’s none of the cutthroat com-
petition here that I’ve found elsewhere. To 
us, New Orleans is the ideal place.’’ 
Before coming to New Orleans, Kole, who 
performed solo but also with a trio or septet, 
frequently played Las Vegas and on national

television, with appearances on ‘‘The To-
night Show with Johnny Carson,’’ ‘‘The Mike 
Douglas Show’’ and ‘‘The Merv Griffin 
Show.’’ 
A dedicated civic booster, Kole served as 
president and chairman of the Sugar Bowl, 
chairman of the Louisiana Tourist Commis-
sion and president of the World Trade Cen-
ter. He was also one of the investors in the 
New Orleans Buccaneers, the short-lived 
1960s team affiliated with the American Bas-
ketball Association, which later merged with 
the NBA. 
Kole was also known for his philanthropy. 
For nearly 30 years, the Jazz on the Bayou 
fundraiser, held at the Koles’ home on the 
banks of Bayou Liberty in Slidell, raised al-
most $2 million for local charities. Bene-
ficiaries included Easter Seals Louisiana, 
STARC, Safe Harbor, the Tammany Trace 
Foundation and other local charities. For 
many years, Kole also hosted the annual 
Easter Seals telethon on local television. 
He was a gourmet and wine connoisseur 
whose personal cellar once contained more 
than 3,000 bottles of vintage wines. His love 
for French wines and vineyards began with 
his 1984 honeymoon in France, where he and 
his wife Gardner would return every sum-
mer. 
Kole wrote several songs based on the vine-
yards and wines of France. He compiled them 
into a series of CDs, called ‘‘Music of the 
Vines.’’ The work earned him the honor of 
Chevalier of Arts and Letters, the highest 
award presented by the French government 
for achievement in the arts. ‘‘Music opens 
the door to anything in the world,’’ he once 
said, ‘‘and wine does, too.’’ 
A life-size statue of Kole, donning a tuxedo 
and holding a glass of wine, is included in 
the New Orleans Musical Legends Park on 
Bourbon Street, alongside fellow icons Pete 
Fountain, Fats Domino, Chris Owens, Irma 
Thomas, Allen Toussaint, Louis Prima and 
Hirt. 
Last year, the City of Slidell officially 
named its Heritage Park Amphitheater 
Stage ‘‘The Ronnie and Gardner Kole Stage’’ 
in recognition of the couple’s cultural con-
tributions to the city. 
Kole was inducted into the Louisiana 
Music Hall of Fame in 2012. 
In addition to the loss of his second wife, 
Gardner Morrow Schneider Kole, the musi-
cian also lost a son, James F. Kuhn. His first 
wife, Violet Shafer Kole, is also deceased. 
Survivors include five children, Sandra 
Kole Bernos, of Poplarville, Mississippi; 
Rhonda Kole Glassmeyer, of Slidell; Ronnie 
Kole Jr., of Lafayette; Bobbi Kole Ballero, of 
New Orleans; and James V. Kuhn, of Deca-
tur, Illinois; three stepchildren, Pete Schnei-
der, Chris Schneider and Doree Schneider 
Donovan, all of Slidell; as well as 12 grand-
children and 13 great-grandchildren.

HONORING THE LIFE OF JUDY 
WILSON CAGLE 
HON. DAN BISHOP 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 1, 2020 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Judy 
Wilson Cagle, who passed away on July 3rd 
at the age of 63. 
Mrs. Cagle was the owner and manager of 
both Rockingham Paint and Glass and Rock-
ingham Fitness. 
Along with owning two businesses, Mrs. 
Cagle was a tireless animal advocate and 
served for several terms on the board of the 
Richmond County Humane Society. There, 
she spearheaded a partnership with the Rich-
mond County Aging Services that allowed for 
low-income senior citizens to receive food for 
their pets. This partnership continues to this 
day. 
Mrs. Cagle’s efforts in the community will 
last for many years to come. May her dedica-
tion to the Rockingham community and animal 
rights be an example for all of us.

REMEMBERING LAWRENCE 
CONNEFF 
HON. EARL L. ‘‘BUDDY’’ CARTER 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 1, 2020 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to remember and honor Mr. Law-
rence ‘‘Pete’’ Conneff of Savannah, Georgia, 
who went to be with the Lord at the age of 90. 
Mr. Conneff attended Sacred Heart School, 
where he was a member of the drum and 
bugle corps, and graduated from Benedictine 
Military School, where he played football and 
basketball. 
After high school, he attended The Citadel 
and Armstrong College, and eventually be-
came a member of the Air National Guard. 
He was a loving, devoted husband to his 
wife Ann, and wonderful father to his five chil-
dren. He eventually became a treasured 
grandfather and great-grandfather to nineteen 
grandchildren and seven great grandchildren. 
Among his several family titles, he was a 
master plumber and owned Conneff Plumbing 
Co. Inc. since 1960. With Pete at the helm of 
the company for 60 years, it became one of 
the leading plumbing providers in the area. 
He was also a member of the Savannah St. 
Patrick’s Day Parade Committee since 1954, a 
charter member of the Irish Heritage Society, 
a member of the Sinn Fein Society, a third-de-
gree member of Knights of Columbus Council 
631, and a charter member of Knights of Co-
lumbus Council 5588. 
While there are many aspects to miss about 
Pete, his character and colorful storytelling al-
ways stood out and will leave a lasting impact 
on all the lives he touched. My thoughts and 
prayers will continue to be with Pete’s friends 
and family during this most difficult time.

HONORING 
THE 
40TH 
ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE FOUNDING OF THE 
CHRONICLE 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 1, 2020 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the 40th anniversary of the 
founding of The Chronicle newspaper. 
The Chronicle was established by Mark 
Frost in 1980 in Glens Falls, New York. 
Through hard work and determination, Mark 
turned an initial investment of $1,700 into a 
successful and profitable newspaper. He re-
mains the publisher and editor today, along-
side staffers who have been with The Chron-
icle for decades. In that time, they have estab-
lished a loyal base of readers and advertisers, 
becoming a cornerstone of the community. 
The Chronicle has long hosted events to 
provide a forum for discussion and to bring 
Glens Falls residents together, especially 
through Autumn Leaves: The Chronicle Book 
Fair. The fair is an opportunity to highlight and 
connect local authors and publishers, and dis-
cover books of all genres. Annual events like 
this are important to strengthen and grow the 
fabric of our communities, and I know many 
who are looking forward to safely resuming 
them as soon as possible. 
On behalf of New York’s 21st District, I 
would like to thank Mark and the entire Chron-
icle staff for their contributions to the commu-
nity and congratulate them on reaching this 
important milestone.

ball Hall of Fame (NVFHOF) and to congratu-
late the 2020 inductees and scholarship award

CONGRATULATING USS 
‘‘TENNESSEE’’ 
HON. EARL L. ‘‘BUDDY’’ CARTER 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 1, 2020 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to congratulate the USS Ten-
nessee, which is based at Naval Submarine 
Base, Kings Bay in the First District of Geor-
gia, for winning the 2020 Secretary of the 
Navy (SECNAV) Afloat Environmental Award. 
The SECNAV environmental programs rec-
ognize Navy and Marine Corps ships, installa-
tions, and people for outstanding performance 
in promoting environmental stewardship. 
These programs are important for achieving 
national defense strategy by taking a proactive 
role 
in 
enhancing 
mission 
effectiveness 
through the implementation of environmental 
programs. 
Additionally, they have allowed for expand-
ing mission requirements, protecting and im-
proving the environment, avoiding and reduc-
ing future liabilities, and building trust with 
partner nations. 
This is not the first time USS Tennessee 
has been honored for its success. In 2014, 
they won the SECNAV Award for Excellence 
in Submarine Safety, and they also won the 
Chief of Naval Operations Environmental 
Awards in submarine category in 2014, 2015, 
and 2016. 
USS Tennessee’s leadership and crew has 
demonstrated sustained commitment and suc-
cess in environmental protection because of 
their emphasis on the importance of each Sail-
or’s role in environmental conservation. I am 
thankful for the entire crew’s commitment to 
both serving our country and protecting our 
environment. 
RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF 
PAMELA HALL 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 1, 2020 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the life of Pamela 
Gayle Cooper Hall, who passed away on Au-
gust 1 after a courageous eight-year battle 
with cancer. 
Pamela’s life began on December 9, 1951; 
however, some may say, her cancer diagnosis 
was truly the start of her journey. A devoted 
Christian and member of Salem Baptist 
Church, Pam viewed her diagnosis as an invi-
tation—an invitation to share her journey and 
lead by example. She spent her years in treat-
ment, encouraging others who were in similar 
circumstances, making friends throughout the 
country in the process. Her passion and devo-
tion to Christ made her a confidante and lead-
er to many, as she always saw the goodness 
in others. 
Pam was also a leader in the professional 
world, as she had a reputation for diligence 
and thoroughness, earning her a business 
management position as well as the position 
of Director of Finance at JME, Inc. for 25 
years. Outside of her professional life, Pam 
also taught children’s Sunday School and 
treasured her women’s Sunday School Class. 
Pam’s colleagues became her family, and 
her diagnosis allowed her to inspire so many 
others. Her life was one of service, grace, and 
love for her family and community, and she 
will be greatly missed by all whom she en-
countered. 
Left to cherish her memory is her husband 
Larry Murrah Hall; daughter, Amy Hall Jones; 
son, Justin Lee Hall; her grandchildren, as 
well as many other friends and extended fam-
ily members.

HONORING RICHARD B. 
BLACKWELL’S 100TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. AMI BERA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 1, 2020 
Mr. BERA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize and celebrate the 100th birthday of 
Richard B. Blackwell from Sacramento, Cali-
fornia. Mr. Blackwell was born on August 28, 
1920, in Franklin, Indiana where he lived and 
worked on a family farm and graduated from 
the local high school. Mr. Blackwell went on to 
receive his Bachelor of Science degree in 
Marketing from Indiana University. 
Shortly after, he enlisted in the United 
States Navy in 1942 and attended Mid-
shipmen’s 
School. 
Mr. 
Blackwell 
served 
aboard the USS Colorado in the Pacific The-
ater during WWII as a Deck Gunnery Officer. 
He bravely served the United States and re-
ceived the Purple Heart and seven stars for 
his time in the Asiatic Pacific Theatre and Phil-
ippine Liberation campaign. 
After four years of service, he was honor-
ably discharged in 1946 and moved to Cali-
fornia to pursue his career. Mr. Blackwell 
worked in marketing and insurance and 
worked his way to become Vice-President of 
Cal-Farm Insurance. In 1969 he married his 
late wife, Ana Maria Morales, and lived in 
Oakland before moving to Sacramento, where 
he still resides. I ask my colleagues to join me 
in sending Mr. Blackwell and his family best 
wishes and great thanks for his service to this 
country as they celebrate his 100th birthday 
today.

IN HONOR OF THE MEMORY OF 
HAROLD LETINSKI 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 1, 2020 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the life of Harold Letinski. 
Mr. Letinski will forever be remembered for his 
unwavering dedication to the Downriver com-
munity, and he will be deeply missed. 
Over the course of 101 years, Harold 
Letinski watched the United States transform 
and witnessed the great challenges, hard-
ships, and victories our nation endured. A 
Downriver native, Mr. Letinski grew up in the 
Delray neighborhood of Detroit. As a child in 
the Great Depression, he rose at 5 a.m, each 
morning to deliver papers and knocked coal 
off train cars to ensure families in his neigh-
borhood could stay warm. After graduating 
from Southwestern High School in Detroit, Mr. 
Letinksi dutifully served his country with the 
Coast Guard during World War II. 
After the war, Harold Letinski returned to 
Michigan and committed himself to bettering 
his local community. Throughout his 20s, Mr. 
Letinski lived in Dearborn with his parents, but 
later moved to Allen Park after marrying his 
wife, Josephine, and started a family. He be-
came the patriarch of two children, seven 
grandchildren, 
thirteen 
great-grandchildren, 
and one great-great-grandchild. He worked for 
over three decades at the Ford Rouge Plant in 
the hot strip mill and was a founding member 
of the Father Saylor Knights of Columbus in 
Allen Park. He was a generous volunteer, and 
encouraged all to live a life of faith, kindness, 
and compassion. Among his friends and com-
munity, Mr. Letinski was known as a devoted 
family man who was gentle, kind, and loving. 
He rarely was upset, and always had a kind 
word to offer to others. Mr. Letinski’s passing 
is a loss to our entire community, but his 
warm legacy will forever endure. He and his 
generation’s contribution to progress will al-
ways be remembered, and his strength, faith, 
and perseverance though turbulent times pro-
vides a lasting example of what can be 
achieved when we all work together. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the life and legacy of Harold 
Letinski. We will forever remember his remark-
able life, work, and community impact. May he 
rest in eternal peace.

HONORING ROYCE CARTER 
HON. EARL L. ‘‘BUDDY’’ CARTER 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 1, 2020 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor my dear friend, Royce E. 
Carter. Throughout his adult life, Royce has 
been a dedicated leader in his community. He 
has been a passionate and devoted Pierce 
County resident and played an instrumental 
role in the implementation of a roundabout 
that was recently approved by the Pierce 
County Board of Commissioners. 
This roundabout is part of a realignment of 
County Farm Road to make way for the new 
Pierce County High School, and Royce was 
responsible for the oversight of the project 
from start to finish. 
Because of his immense dedication not just 
to this project, but every project he has spear-
headed in his community, the Pierce County 
Board of Commissioners named the round-
about the Royce E. Carter Roundabout. 
This dedication is a simple ‘‘thank you’’ for 
his leadership and for everything Royce has 
done to make Pierce County a better place. 
He has always approached every project and 
challenge with a can-do attitude, and he is 
kind to everyone he meets. 
I am thankful to know Royce, and I know he 
will continue to be an asset for Pierce County.

Mount Zion moved into their new building in 
March of 2010 and have called this sanctuary 
their home ever since. The church was origi-
nally organized in Stafford, Virginia in 1876 
shortly after the end of the Civil War by Rev-
erend Charles Gibson. In 1918 the church 
moved to Prince William County to better ac-
commodate its growing membership. In 1922, 
Mount Zion built their first Prince William 
County sanctuary in Triangle, Virginia, creating 
a spiritual home for people in and around the 
county. 
Since being founded in Prince William 
County, Mount Zion has played a fundamental 
role in building the community. Under the 
leadership of their Pastor, Reverend Dr. Alfred 
Jones, Jr. the Church has embodied its of 
‘‘Living By Faith.’’ Since his installation, Rev. 
Dr. Jones has served an instrumental role in 
the growth of membership to over 2000 mem-
bers and the development of five fundamental 
ministries: Evangelism, Inspired Arts, Christian 
Education, Discipleship Building and Family 
Life Principles. From these ministries, 37 sub-
ordinate ministries were established reaching 
into the lives of those beyond the church walls 
to provide financial support, clothing assist-
ance, and food assistance to the global com-
munity. Because of this continued growth and 
expansion of its mission throughout the com-
munity, Mount Zion opened a new sanctuary 
in 2010. The positive impacts on our region 
have continued to flourish this past decade 
through this new sanctuary. We in Prince Wil-
liam are lucky to have Mount Zion in our com-
munity. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in commending Mount Zion Baptist Church

REMEMBERING ROBERT EUGENE 
HELTZEL, JR. 
HON. TIM RYAN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 1, 2020 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Robert Eugene Heltzel, Jr., of 
Pepper Pike, Ohio, who passed away on Au-
gust 17, 2020, at the age of 73. 
Bob was born on January 22, 1947, in War-
ren, Ohio. He was the second eldest of seven 
children and attended St. Stephen’s Elemen-
tary School in Niles, Ohio. Bob ‘‘Robbo’’ was 
a 1965 graduate of Gilmour Academy in Gates 
Mills, OH. The friendships he made there re-
mained a source of strength and joy for him 
his entire life. 
In 1972, Bob married Heidi, the love of his 
life. They settled in Warren, OH, where they 
raised their five daughters. Bob was an active 
member of his community, generous bene-
factor, and tireless entrepreneur. 
Bob founded Kenilworth Steel Company in 
1981 where he served as CEO and President 
until his retirement in 2006 and remained a 
consultant until 2009. He dedicated almost 30 
years of his life to establishing a thriving busi-
ness driven by his desire to serve his family 
and the families of his employees. 
A lifelong lover of the game of golf, Bob 
dedicated several years to coaching not only 
family members, but the men’s golf team at 
John F. Kennedy high school in Warren, Ohio. 
Bob led the team to the State Tournament and 
became State Champions in 2001–2002. He 
was inducted into the Coaches Hall of Fame 
for his role as coach in 2014. Bob passed on 
his passion for golf to his five daughters and 
enjoyed endless spirited rounds with his sons- 
in-law, grandchildren, and dear friends. 
Bob was the loving husband of Heidi Heltzel 
(nee Browning) and devoted father of Jennifer 
Farrior (Julian) of Boulder, CO, Katie Ricotti 
(fiance Rocco DiPuccio) of University Heights, 
OH, Maggie Schumacher (Brett) of University 
Heights, OH, Robin Heltzel of Pittsburgh, PA, 
and Erin Moore (Tim) of Cleveland, OH. He 
was the proud grandfather of Robert and Leo 
Ricotti, Marley and James Farrior, Izzy and 
Andy Schumacher, and Elizabeth and Charlie 
Moore. He is preceded in death by his par-
ents, Robert Eugene Heltzel, Sr. and Mary 
Jane Heltzel (nee Hazzard), and brothers Paul 
and Mark Heltzel. 
Mr. Heltzel was the recipient of many hon-
ors throughout his life, but I have no doubt his 
greatest was being the husband to Heidi and 
the father and grandfather to his children and 
grandchildren. My deepest sympathies go out 
to Bob’s family and to all whose lives he 
touched. 
INTRODUCTION OF THE CONGRESS 
LEADS BY EXAMPLE ACT OF 2020 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 1, 2020 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the Congress Leads by Example Act 
of 2020, which would subject Congress and 
the rest of the legislative branch to many of 
the workplace laws that protect employees in 
the private sector and the executive branch. 
Congress should abide by the laws it imposes 
on the American people and businesses. In 
1995, Congress passed the Congressional Ac-
countability Act of 1995 (CAA), which applied 
13 civil rights, labor and workplace safety and 
health laws to Congress and legislative branch 
entities. In 2018, after reports of sexual har-
assment in Congress and in light of the 
#MeToo movement, Congress passed the 
Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 Re-
form Act (Reform Act), which changed the 
name of the Office of Compliance to the Office 
of Congressional Workplace Rights (OCWR), 
revised the process to resolve workplace 
claims and extended CAA protections to un-
paid staff, interns and fellows. It also made 
Members of Congress personally liable for 
their own violations of harassment and retalia-
tion laws. However, more remains to be done. 
The CAA and the Reform Act were impor-
tant first steps in making the legislative branch 
accountable for its employment practices, but 
they did not finish the job. As noted, the CAA 
did bring the legislative branch under 13 major 
civil rights, labor and workplace safety and 
health laws but it omitted important sub-
stantive and administrative protections. In its 
latest Section 102(b) biennial report to Con-
gress, the OCWR identified additional provi-
sions of federal workplace laws and standards 
that should be applicable to the legislative 
branch. OCWR’s recommendations include 
providing whistleblowers with protection from 
retaliation by making the Whistleblower Pro-
tection Act of 1989 applicable to the legislative 
branch. My bill takes into account the OCWR 
report, and seeks both to apply the standard 
of fairness to employees in the legislative 
branch that Congress requires for other em-
ployees and to provide a safer work environ-
ment for Congress, Capitol Hill employees and 
visitors by bringing the legislative branch in 
line with the legal requirements of private sec-
tor employers and the executive branch. 
My bill provides general whistleblower pro-
tections and anti-retaliation measures and 
makes additional Occupational Safety and 
Health Act (OSHA) retaliation provisions appli-
cable to the legislative branch. My bill also 
provides subpoena authority to OCWR to con-
duct inspections and investigations into OSHA 
violations. 
This bill also furthers the CAA’s mission to 
prevent discrimination in legislative branch of-
fices by prohibiting the legislative branch from 
making adverse employment decisions on the 
basis of an employee’s wage garnishment or 
involvement in bankruptcy proceedings pursu-
ant to the Consumer Credit Protection Act and 
Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code. 
Finally, this bill bolsters the CAA’s record-
keeping requirements. It extends the obligation 
to maintain accurate records of safety informa-
tion and employee injuries, as otherwise re-
quired by OSHA, as well as employee records 
necessary to administer anti-discrimination 
laws in the legislative branch. 
By passing this bill, Congress would help re-
store the public trust in this institution by re-
doubling our efforts to exercise leadership by 
example. I urge bipartisan support for this im-
portant measure.

REMEMBERING AND HONORING 
VENUS HOLMES 
HON. EARL L. ‘‘BUDDY’’ CARTER 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 1, 2020 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to remember and honor the life of 
Venus Holmes, who went to be with the Lord 
at the age of 82. 
To know Venus was to love her. She was 
a beloved resident of Brunswick and Darien, 
and she was a woman of faith and character. 
She was also a champion for civil rights and 
was a member of the NAACP for over 53 
years. Her life was marked by a long list of ac-
complishments and awards—she was truly a 
remarkable woman. 
Venus served as the 3rd Vice President of 
the Georgia State NAACP Conference, and 
served as Secretary of the Georgia State Con-
ference NAACP for nine years. In addition to 
her leadership titles, she received numerous 
accolades, including the Rudy Hurly Plaque 
Award for ‘‘Outstanding Service,’’ as well as 
the Thomas B. Murphy ‘‘Lifetime Achievement 
Award.’’ 
Venus was also chosen as ‘‘Woman of the 
Year’’ for the NAACP twice, served 14 years 
on the Brunswick School Board, and served 
as Vice Chair on the Brunswick School Board, 
as well. She was also a devoted member to 
her church, Mt. Calvary Baptist Church, where 
she was a musician for 39 years. 
Although Venus is no longer here on earth 
with us, her legacy will remain for years to 
come. My thoughts and prayers are with her 
family and friends during this most difficult 
time.

HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize Coach Gerry Pannoni and to con-
gratulate him and the South County High 
School football team, the Stallions, on their 6A 
State Championship. 
The South County football team was 
undefeated during their 2019 State Champion-
ship run. This was the first time in school his-
tory the Stallions won a state title. Their 15– 
0 record demonstrates the team’s dedication 
and hard work. The Stallions were led by head 
coach, Gerry Pannoni, who has been head 
coach at South County High School since 
2011. 
Coach Pannoni has been committed to the 
sport of football for several decades, both as

a player and a coach. After playing at 
Frostburg State, Coach Pannoni became an 
assistant Varsity Football Coach there in 1979. 
He then went on to build an extensive and 
successful career in numerous positions. He 
was a head football coach in Fairfax County 
and the surrounding area for more than 20- 
years before accepting the position of head 
coach at South County in 2011. 
Coach Pannoni has received numerous 
awards and honors throughout his many ac-
complished seasons. In his eight years at 
South County Coach Pannoni and the South 
County Stallions won the District Champion-
ship 6 times and he was named District coach 
of the year all 6 of those years. The Stallions 
won the Regional Championship 2 times 
under Coach Pannoni and he was named Re-
gion Coach of the year both years. Coach 
Pannoni was the first inductee into the South 
County High School Football Ring of Honor, 
which has been named after him. He was 
named Northern Virginia Football Hall of Fame 
Coach of the Year three times, in 2011, 2016, 
and most recently in 2019. During his tenure 
at South County, Coach Pannoni and the Var-
sity Football team have never had a losing 
record. Coach Pannoni has displayed strong 
leadership, professionalism, and dedication 
throughout his time at South County, and has 
been a true role model for all of the students 
on his team. I congratulate Coach Pannoni 
and the Stallion football program on winning 
the VHSL 6A State Championship. Although 
Coach Pannoni has relocated to another state, 
I wish him and the Stallions continued suc-
cess. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues 
please join me in honoring Coach Pannoni 
and the South County Stallions in recognition 
of their undefeated 6A State Championship 
season.

CELEBRATING FREEDOM 
HON. LEE M. ZELDIN 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 1, 2020 
Mr. ZELDIN. Madam Speaker, today, I rise 
to recognize composer Richard Fuchs of 
Coram, New York, and his 1983 composition 
entitled ‘‘Gettysburg.’’ His music, set to the 
awe-inspiring address given by President 
Abraham Lincoln in 1863, has given new, me-
lodious life to those brilliant two hundred and 
forty words, reminding modern audiences of 
the sacred and revolutionary ideals our coun-
try strives to embody. 
Just as Baltimore shopkeeper Thomas Carr 
first put Francis Scott-Key’s poem, ‘‘The De-
fense of Fort McHenry’’, to music in 1814, cre-
ating ‘‘The Star Spangled Banner’’, Mr. Fuchs 
found a similar way to preserve the Gettys-
burg Address. Ever since he first saw the 
speech engraved on the side of the Lincoln 
Memorial at 9 years old, he wanted to honor 
its eternal message in song. 
After years of tinkering with melody and 
meter, Mr. Fuchs finally published ‘‘Gettys-
burg’’ in 1983, just in time for the 120th anni-
versary celebration of the Gettysburg Address. 
Thirty four years after his first visit to the Lin-
coln Memorial, Mr. Fuchs performed his cre-
ation on the monument’s steps during this 
celebration, 
playing 
piano 
alongside 
his 
daughter and their hometown Centereach 
High School Choir. 
Since that first performance, Mr. Fuchs 
composition has been sung by choirs across 
the nation, from Tucson, Arizona to the Smith-
sonian. Over nearly four decades, through his 
music, Mr. Fuchs has helped preserve Presi-
dent Lincoln’s vision for America for an en-
tirely new generation, trying every day to live 
up to the principles of freedom, happiness, 
and equality our country’s founders spoke of. 
In 2013, Mr. Fuchs’ composition was per-
formed with one hundred and fifty chorus 
members at the very place President Lincoln 
first delivered the Gettysburg Address. Each 
member of the chorus represented each year 
since the historic event. 
Like President Lincoln’s address, Mr. Fuchs’ 
composition is yet another stark reminder of 
our constant, unfinished work as Americans to 
ensure liberty and justice for all.

HONORING ALANA SMITH 
SHEPHERD 
HON. EARL L. ‘‘BUDDY’’ CARTER 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 1, 2020 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor Alana Smith Shepherd, 
who recently celebrated her 90th birthday. She 
has lived a life of service, and has devoted 
her life to healing and helping others. 
Alana and her family co-founded the world- 
renowned Shepherd Center in Atlanta in 1975. 
Over the years, the Shepherd Center has 
grown from a six-bed unit to a remarkable 152 
bed rehabilitation hospital. 
The hospital specializes in medical treat-
ment, research, and rehabilitation for people 
with spinal cord injuries, brain injuries, and 
other neurological conditions. Thanks to Alana 
and her family’s efforts, they have helped 
countless individuals get the lifesaving care 
they need. 
In addition to her work with Shepherd Cen-
ter, Alana has advocated for accessibility to 
Atlanta’s 
MARTA 
bus 
system 
and 
the 
Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Air-
port, which is now one of the country’s most 
accessible airports. 
Alana was named one of the most influential 
people in Atlanta by the Atlanta Business 
Chronicle in 2014, among many other awards. 
She has also been a civic leader in her com-
munity, including serving as former vice presi-
dent and current member of the Rotary Club 
of Atlanta, and the secretary of the Board of 
Directors for the Atlanta Paralympic Games. 
In 1989, Alana was the first woman elected 
to be a member of the Buckhead Coalition, 
and in 2003, the first woman elected as chair-
man of the Coalition. 
I am thankful for the impact she has made 
on the state of Georgia, and I am blessed to 
know her.

safe and our streets clean, while building trust 
and relationships within the community. The 
untold sacrifice and unwavering commitment 
by our law enforcement officials to serve in an 
increasingly polarized climate, riddled with 
hate and violence, deserves recognition.

and community. This is simply an outstanding 
accomplishment.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF 
DEPUTY DYLAN PICKLE 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 1, 2020 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the life of Deputy 
Dylan Pickle, who passed away on Sunday, 
July 26, while conducting a safety checkpoint. 
Dylan was born on July 2, 1996, in Amory, 
Mississippi. At four years old, Dylan knew he 
wanted to wear a badge. After graduating from 
Amory High School, Dylan began to make that 
badge a reality. He pursued a degree in Crimi-
nal Justice at Itawamba Community College 
and joined the Army at only 17. 
Joining the Army was only the beginning for 
Dylan. He earned a medal at Quantico and 
would later receive three more for his heroism 
in Syria, where he served as a Specialist, be-
coming known for his leadership and his care 
for others. In 2016, Dylan brought his passion 
for serving home and began working with the 
Monroe County Sheriff’s Department as a pa-
trol deputy. 
Outside of his patrol duties, Dylan was a 
member of the First United Methodist Church. 
A momma’s boy, Dylan always made time for 
his family, especially his niece and nephews, 
whom he adored and spoiled whenever he 
could. Although serving his country was his 
passion, he also enjoyed going to the shooting 
range, collecting guns, listening to country 
music, and of course, socializing with his 
friends. 
Deputy Dylan Pickle’s life was one of serv-
ice, grace, and love for his family and commu-
nity. He will be greatly missed by all whom he 
encountered. 
Left to cherish his memory is mother, Debi 
Pearson; sister, Kristin Vuncannon; brother, 
Drew Pickle; step-sister, Kayla Pearson; as 
well as many other friends and extended fam-
ily members.

Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize the recipients of the 2020 Fairfax 
County Student Peace Awards. 
The Fairfax County Student Peace Awards

ior or Senior, or one student group active in 
promoting peace and/or removing the causes 
of conflict. Examples of outreach include: com-
mitting to peace by engaging in activities that 
strive to end conflict, either locally or globally, 
seeking to discuss or otherwise resolve poten-
tially controversial issues within the school or 
community, promoting the understanding of di-
visive issues and situations to bridge lan-
guage, ethnic, racial, religious, gender, sexual 
orientation, or class differences, and working 
to resolve conflicts among students or mem-
bers of the community who feel isolated or 
alienated.

AMARI PRESIDENT 
HON. JOE CUNNINGHAM 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 1, 2020 
Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of Amari President. 
Amari was only sixteen years young when 
he passed, but his wisdom was already far be-
yond his years. Despite being too young to 
vote, he knew the importance of his civic duty 
to hold public officials accountable and to be 
involved in his local community. That involve-
ment brought Amari into my life when he at-
tended one of my very first town halls and left 
me a question. In my subsequent conversa-
tions with Amari, it was clear his leadership 
and vibrancy were going to take him to big 
and wonderful places in life. 
Anyone who was lucky enough to know 
Amari knew his dreams were big, but achiev-
able for someone as bright and determined as 
him. You just knew Amari would find a way to 
achieve every single one of them, especially 
living up to his name and becoming a U.S. 
President one day. Amari had my vote. Be-
yond his ambition, his family knew Amari as 
compassionate, empathetic, and driven to 
serve others. Amari wanted to spread kind-
ness and joy wherever he went. He went the 
extra mile to be a beacon of light and knew 
how to brighten your day by sharing his 
warmth through a big grin. 
His sixteen years have left an indelible im-
print on the Lowcountry and his legacy will be 
found in every heart Amari touched, including 
mine. I mourn this tragic loss with his family, 
classmates, and the massive community that 
was blessed to know Amari and his greatness.

CONGRATULATING GENERAL 
BOBBY CHRISTINE 
HON. EARL L. ‘‘BUDDY’’ CARTER 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 1, 2020 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to congratulate General Bobby 
Christine from Georgia’s First Congressional 
District for being promoted from Colonel to 
Brigadier General on July 8. General Christine 
earned his undergraduate degree from the 
University of Georgia, and achieved his Juris 
Doctorate degree from Samford University’s 
Cumberland School of Law in Birmingham. 
He worked in the District Attorney’s Office in 
Augusta for a decade, and is one of only a 
few prosecutors in modern Georgia to win a 
conviction for a murder case where the body 
of the victim has never been located. 
General Christine was appointed Judge of 
Magistrate Court for Columbia County in 2005, 
and held that post until November 2017, while 
serving as Chief Magistrate from 2009 to 
2012. At the same time, he also maintained a 
private law practice. 
On November 22, 2017, General Christine 
was sworn in as United States Attorney for the 
Southern District of Georgia, having been 
nominated by President Trump and confirmed 
by the Senate. 
He has been an Army reservist since the 
age of 17, as a Combat Engineer and Judge 
Advocate. General Christine has a long list of 
military accomplishments, including the Legion 
of Merit, Meritorious Service Medal, Bronze 
Star Medal, and the parachutist badge. 
I am sure he will continue to serve our 
country beyond expectations in his new rank, 
and I am thankful for his courage, leadership, 
and perseverance. I want to congratulate Gen-
eral Christine and his family again on this 
achievement.

REMEMBERING ANNE MARIE 
SIMON VROSS 
HON. TIM RYAN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 1, 2020 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Anne Marie Simon Vross, of 
Youngstown, Ohio, who passed away peace-
fully Monday, June 29, 2020, surrounded by 
her family at the age of 87. 
Anne was born September 12, 1932, in 
Youngstown, the daughter of Alex and Tuban 
Simon. She was a 1951 graduate of Ursuline 
High School and attended Youngstown State 
University. 
Anne was the beloved matriarch of her fam-
ily. Always the best hostess, she made her 
home the common gathering place. Whether it 
was hosting Sunday dinner, planning her fa-
vorite holiday celebrations, or coordinating a 
reunion, she was always looking for ways to 
bring the family together, because that’s when 
she was the happiest. She never grew tired of 
going above and beyond to make sure her 
family was happy and well provided for. 
She was also a true professional career 
woman, serving in many different roles 
throughout her life. Despite her busy career, 
Anne always found time to volunteer. 
Anne truly loved politics and the ability to 
help improve the quality of life for all. She was 
founder of Canfield Federated Women’s Club, 
where she also served as a former president. 
She was a former member and corresponding 
secretary of Mahoning County President’s 
Club and the Federated Democratic Women of 
Ohio, and she was a former member and ex-
ecutive endorsement committee delegate to 
the State of Ohio Democratic Convention. She 
was awarded Democratic Woman of the Year 
by the John F. Kennedy Democratic Women’s 
Club and was named a Hall of Fame Inductee 
for her devotion and dedication to the Demo-
cratic party. 
Anne will be fondly remembered for her love 
of decorating, cooking, entertaining, and shop-
ping. She loved staying up on fashion so 
much that she was referred to as ‘‘the best- 
dressed lady in Mahoning County’’ on many 
occasions. 
Anne was dearly loved and will be deeply 
missed by her children, Anthony (Christine) 
Vross, Dianne Wyant, Dr. Sue Ellen (Dr. Eric) 
Espinal and Jackie (John) French; her grand-
children, Linda Terlesky, Laura Terlesky, 
Keely (John) Welch, Chelsea (Eric) Hillard, Al-
lison (Michael) Thomas, Marian (Phil) Nolletti,

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
CAMELOT 
NEIGHBORHOOD 
WATCH 
PRO-
GRAM ON ITS 40TH ANNIVER-
SARY 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 1, 2020 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize the Camelot Neighborhood Watch 
Program (CNWP) of Fairfax County, Virginia, 
and to congratulate it on the occasion of its 
40th anniversary. 
Neighborhood Watch Programs (NWP’s) are 
one of the oldest and best-known crime pre-
vention efforts in North America. In the late 
1960s, an increase in crime heightened the 
need for a prevention initiative focused on res-
idential areas and involving local citizens. The 
National Sheriffs’ Association responded by 
creating the National Neighborhood Watch 
Program in 1972 to assist citizens and law en-
forcement. Since that time, the mission of 
NWPs has expanded to include helping neigh-
borhoods focus on disaster preparedness and 
emergency response. 
While there are thousands of Neighborhood 
Watch Programs in the country all of which 
deserve our recognition and appreciation, the 
Camelot Neighborhood Watch Program stands 
out as one of the best in the Nation. The 
CNWP is the oldest, continuously active 
Neighborhood Watch in the United States. In 
the 40 years since its inception, the CNWP 
has achieved great success, helping lower the 
general crime rate in its community. 
In fact, the Fairfax County Mason District 
Police Department has recognized the CNWP 
as one of the most effective crime reduction 
units in the county and Camelot is one of the 
most crime-free communities in Fairfax Coun-
ty. The Virginia Crime Prevention Association 
has recognized the CNWP as the Best Neigh-
borhood Watch in Virginia and it has also 
been commended by the General Assembly of 
the Commonwealth of Virginia. 
Over the last four decades, more than 70 
volunteers have contributed 27,000 hours con-
ducting 20,500 patrols and logging 220,000 
miles. This dedication is a tribute to the resi-
dents of Camelot and to the leadership exhib-
ited by the program coordinators, past and 
present. 
Northern Virginia, particularly Fairfax Coun-
ty, is known as one of the best places in the 
nation in which to live, work and raise a fam-
ily. One of the main reasons for this designa-
tion is the community spirit that is on display 
in every corner of our region and exemplified 
by the Camelot Neighborhood Watch Pro-
gram. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the 
Camelot Neighborhood Watch Program for 40 
years of dedicated service to its neighbors. 
Programs like the CNWP are vital in our ef-
forts to combat crime. I call upon my col-
leagues to join me in applauding the CNWP’s 
past accomplishments and in wishing the pro-
gram continued success.

CONGRATULATING HOWARD SEPP 
HON. EARL L. ‘‘BUDDY’’ CARTER 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 1, 2020 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to congratulate Mr. Howard Sepp 
of Georgia’s First Congressional District who 
retired on July 1. 
Howard was a long-time vice president and 
administrator of the Southeast Georgia Health 
System’s Camden campus since 2003. He 
had overseen the Camden hospital for more 
than 17 years, during which he oversaw a $30 
million renovation and the addition of a wide 
array of medical services. 
Thanks to Howard’s efforts, the hospital 
grew remarkably, including adding cancer care 
services in 2012, the Camden Medical Plaza 
in 2013, and a new, state-of-the-art care cen-
ter which recently opened. He also helped 
spearhead the Coastal Community Health af-
filiation with Baptist Health System, which led 
to significant cost savings and improved co-
ordination through the Emergency Care Cen-
ter. 
In addition to being a leader for the hospital, 
he has also been an active civic leader. He 
has held positions with the Camden County 
Chamber of Commerce and Rotary Club of 
Camden County, and has helped with Leader-
ship Camden. Howard also serves as chair-
man of the Camden Partnerships and is a 
board member for the Coastal Georgia council 
of the Boy Scouts of America. 
Camden County is better because of How-
ard, and I can’t thank him enough for his over 
17 years of hard work to ensure people in

RECOGNIZING THE 2020 VFW POST 
7327 AMERICANISM AWARDS RE-
CIPIENTS 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 1, 2020 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 
7327 in Springfield, Virginia and the winners of 
its 2020 Americanism Awards. 
The Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) traces 
its beginnings to 1899 when veterans of the 
Spanish American War established local orga-
nizations to bring awareness to their service 
and to advocate for veteran’s retirement bene-
fits and improved medical care. Annually, the 
nearly 2 million members of the VFW and its 
Auxiliaries contribute more than 8.6 million 
hours of volunteerism in the community, in-
cluding participation in Make A Difference Day 
and National Volunteer Week. 
With approximately 600 Comrades and 150 
Ladies Auxiliary members, the Springfield 
VFW Post 7327 stands out for the depth of its 
commitment to our community. Often called 
‘‘The Friendliest VFW Post in Virginia,’’ Post 
7327 has one of the most aggressive ADOPT- 
A-UNIT programs in the entire VFW organiza-
tion to support our service members stationed 
overseas. VFW Post 7327 visits the VA hos-
pital at least quarterly, bringing along goodie 
bags for our Wounded Warriors. Each Thanks-
giving and Christmas, VFW Post 7327 adopts 
military families in need through the USO and 
provides them with meal baskets for each holi-
day, gifts for children, commissary cards for 
the parents, and a Christmas party where the 
children can meet Santa and receive a gift- 
filled stocking. The Ladies Auxiliary members 
collect, sort, and distribute more than 2,000 
pieces of clothing each month to various chari-
table organizations. 
VFW Post 7327 is a strong supporter of 
local youth organizations including the Boys 
Scouts, Girl Scouts, and Little League Base-
ball that contribute greatly to the education 
and well-being of our children. 
Each year, VFW Post 7327 bestows awards 
to local students who have submitted out-
standing essays on a specific theme and to 
local teachers and public safety officers in rec-
ognition of their extraordinary actions and 
dedication to the community.
