BIDEN’S BORDER CRISIS IS 
ADDING TO THE COVID CRISIS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Tennessee (Mr. ROSE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, 10 months 
into the Biden administration and cri-
sis defines this Presidency. 
Since President Biden took office, we 
have faced crisis after crisis, not the 
least of which is at our southern bor-
der. Right now, the United States is ex-
periencing the highest number of at-
tempted illegal border crossings in 21 
years. Some 1.7 million people were ap-
prehended attempting to enter the U.S. 
illegally in fiscal year 2021, ending Sep-
tember 30, which is a new record. Over 
164,300 attempted to cross just in Octo-
ber. This is 128 percent increase from 
last October. 
Since March 20, 95,000 illegal immi-
grants were released with notices to re-
port on their honor. President Biden 
recently announced a hotly debated ap-
proach 
to 
limiting 
the 
spread 
of 
COVID–19, mandating vaccinations for 
Federal 
workers, 
Federal 
contract 
workers, healthcare workers, and any-
one who works for a private business 
with over 100 employees. But take a 
guess as to who is not included in this 
wide-spread vaccine mandate—illegal 
immigrants. 
While President Biden blames Amer-
ican citizens for the increase in COVID 
cases, he refuses to call out the record 
number of illegal immigrants entering 
the 
United 
States 
from 
COVID 
hotspots around the world who are po-
tentially contributing to the spread of 
new and dangerous variants of the 
virus, like the delta, lambda, and mu 
strains. 
On September 20, when White House 
Press Secretary Jen Psaki was asked 
about this double standard, she is 
quoted as saying, illegal immigrants 
didn’t need to comply because ‘‘they 
are not intending to stay.’’ What a 
laughable statement. 
Once again, we are seeing the Biden 
administration choosing to put the in-
terests of illegal immigrants above the 
interests of the American people. Why 
is President Biden allowing this ever- 
growing burden on the already strained 
resources of this country to continue 
unabated? 
Our southern border is an ongoing, 
full-blown catastrophe and it should be 
treated as one. That is why I am call-
ing on President Biden to finally ad-
dress this historic disaster of his own 
making and at least make a good-faith 
effort to stem the flow of illegal immi-
gration, dangerous illicit drugs, and 
human trafficking in this country. And 
while he is at it, to implement stricter, 
more comprehensive and more effective 
COVID protections at our southern 
border. 
f 
SYSTEMIC RACISM IN THE 
JUDICIAL SYSTEM 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. GREEN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
and still I rise, a proud, liberated Dem-
ocrat. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address 
systemic racism in the judicial system. 
I believe one of the best ways to ex-
plain this and help persons understand 
with some degree of clarity is to use an 
example. 
Let’s use an example of a 25-year-old 
White man. Let us assume that he is 
jogging through a neighborhood near 
his home. Let’s assume that he is ac-
costed by three Black men in a truck 
with a liberation flag on it. And let us 
assume that when they accost him, one 
of them has a shotgun and there is an 
encounter with this person, who hap-
pens to be a Black man. The White 
man is jogging, the Black men are pur-
suing, and now there is an encounter. 
Let’s assume that this Black male 
shoots the White man, and in so doing, 
a case is brought to court by way of a 
video. Let’s assume that in this case, 
the prosecutor is Black, that the judge 
is Black, and let’s assume that the de-
fense attorneys are able to select a 
jury that has 11 Black people, one 
White person. 
Mr. Speaker, this happens quite often 
in our country. As a matter of fact, it 
can happen regularly in our country to 
Black people. Black people don’t have 
the luxury of being tried by juries with 
11 Black people on them. They are like-
ly to be fewer than three. Black people 
don’t have the luxury of being in a

courtroom where the judge is Black, 
the prosecutor is Black, the court re-
porter is Black, and the witnesses are 
Black. We have a moral imperative to 
address this level of systemic discrimi-
nation. We should do more than simply 
talk about it, however. Addressing it 
with words is important, but we have 
to do more than this. We must do more 
than desire to manage systemic rac-
ism. We want to end it. If we don’t end 
systemic racism, too many persons of 
color will continue to suffer, as is the 
case in this country today. 
We, in this Congress, can do some-
thing about this. We have a duty to do 
something about it, and that some-
thing has to entail dealing with what is 
called a peremptory challenge, which 
allows a lawyer to simply draw a line 
through the name of a person and have 
that person removed from the jury, as-
signing some specious reason for doing 
so, and end up with a Black person 
being tried by a jury that is almost 
White—11 Whites and one Black. 
The peremptory challenge is not 
something that is embedded in the 
Constitution. It is not something that 
is required. Persons can be removed 
from a jury for cause, but this cause, 
this peremptory challenge, is the cause 
that we should take a look at because 
it is absolute and it allows systemic 
racism to rear its ugly head in our 
courtrooms. 
I hope to present legislation address-
ing systemic racism by way of the pe-
remptory challenge. 
f 
BUILD BACK BETTER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Nebraska (Mr. BACON) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in strong opposition to the Build 
Back Better Act. 
President Biden, Leader SCHUMER, 
Speaker PELOSI, and Chairman BERNIE 
SANDERS have made it clear they want 
to transform America. In fact, those 
are their words. They want to trans-
form America using reconciliation, the 
so-called Build Back Better Act. They 
are trying to do it with a 50–50 Senate, 
a 3-seat majority in the House out of 
435 Members, and a President that won 
by just two States. 
Last November, the country did not 
vote for transformation, but for mid-
dle-of-the-road centrist policies and 
steady leadership. That is not what 
they got, and voters are mad. 
Just look at the polling. The Presi-
dent sits at a 38 percent favorable rat-
ing. The generic ballot for the House 
favors Republicans by 11 points—the 
biggest margin seen in the history of 
this polling. 
If there is any doubt, just review the 
recent results of Virginia where a Re-
publican was elected; in New Jersey 
where a Democrat squeaked by in his 
reelection. A 12-point swing in Virginia 
and a 14-point swing in New Jersey in 
just one year. 
Our Nation does not desire to be a 
giant welfare State with cradle-to- 
grave government oversight control-
ling their lives. Last year, the country 
didn’t vote to give amnesty and gov-
ernment payouts for adults who ille-
gally crossed our borders and jumped 
to the front of the line of those trying 
to come here through legal channels. 
The country did not vote to hire 87,000 
more IRS agents for auditing every-day 
Americans to raise $400 billion to pay 
for their reckless spending spree. 
We need IRS agents to provide cus-
tomer service to those still waiting for 
their tax refunds, sometimes a year 
late, but not for more audits. Ameri-
cans didn’t vote to raise taxes on a 
third of the middle class, which is what 
the left-leaning Tax Policy Center 
stated is the case, while it also found 
that two-thirds of millionaires will 
now get a tax break at the same time 
because of the changes made to the 
SALT deductions in this bad bill. 
Americans didn’t vote to remove the 
Hyde amendment that prevented our 
tax dollars from paying for abortions, 
and they did not vote to remove work 
requirements for able-bodied adults to 
receive welfare benefits. Americans did 
not vote to impede and ban domestic 
energy and mineral production, or to 
increase our reliance on China and 
OPEC. Our citizens did not vote to 
raise taxes on natural gas that Ameri-
cans use to heat their homes, and we 
did not vote to undermine our research 
and discovery of new drugs that can 
save people’s lives. 
Finally, Americans did not vote to 
give people earning up to $500,000 tax 
breaks for buying electric vehicles. The 
authors of this legislation have either 
misjudged or ignored where the coun-
try is at on these issues. This legisla-
tion is a total transformation, is what 
the President is saying, but it is a 
giant, 
welfare-State 
transformation. 
For these reasons, and many more, I 
will be voting ‘‘no’’ on the Build Back 
Better Act, and I urge my colleagues to 
do the same. 
Mr. Speaker, I pray that moderate 
Democrats will say no, and like many 
Americans, I am grateful that Senators 
MANCHIN and SINEMA have been voices 
of reason and commonsense. We need 
more of their voices.

HONORING HERB BARRET FOR A 
REMARKABLE LIFE OF SERVICE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
RUIZ). The Chair recognizes the gen-
tleman 
from 
New 
York 
(Mr. 
ESPAILLAT) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, last 
week, we celebrated Veterans Day. In 
that spirit, I rise today to honor a man 
of exemplary service, unwavering dedi-
cation to our country, and someone I 
am proud to call a constituent, Mr. 
Herb Barret. 
Mr. Barret is someone who has lived 
a remarkable life of service. He is a 
veteran and a former member of the 
Marine Corps who risked his life for 
our country in the Korean war—sadly, 
but often known, as ‘‘the forgotten 
war.’’ Marines live by a set of values 
and principles, such as honor, courage, 
commitment. They are the bedrock of 
our Nation’s character, and what Mr. 
Barret embodies every single day in 
our community. Throughout his es-
teemed career, Mr. Barret has shined 
bright as a beacon of perseverance and 
commitment, inspiring all of us with 
his valor along the way. 
Mr. Barret is a dedicated member of 
our community in New York City and 
has laid the groundwork for the next 
generation of public servants to follow 
in his footsteps. He is a living example 
that anything that is possible in this 
country through hard work, dedica-
tion, and perseverance, through the 
physical, mental, and moral battles 
faced during combat and while serving 
in our communities on behalf of our 
great Nation. He is a man of great in-
tegrity, courage, and humility, and I 
am proud to call him a member of our 
community. 
HONORING DR. JUAN TAPIA-MENDOZA 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I also 
rise today to honor Dr. Juan Tapia- 
Mendoza, a fellow Dominican immi-
grant and New Yorker who has fought 
tirelessly to achieve the American 
Dream—and that he did. 
Before Dr. Tapia-Mendoza opened his 
pediatric practice, he was a graffiti 
artist known only as ‘‘C.A.T. 87,’’ 
whose work was found all over the sub-
way cars and across the city of New 
York in empty lots, particularly in 
northern Manhattan and beyond. 
Though he dropped out of school at a 
young age, his art showcased a strong 
motivation, and he was able to channel 
that motivation into his studies and 
return back to Santo Domingo to study 
medicine. 
Upon his return, Dr. Tapia-Mendoza, 
opened Pediatrics 2000 group, which 
now has two locations in my district 
and serves over 20,000 children, sup-
porting not only the health of our chil-
dren, but their education and literacy 
as well, fostering the next generation 
of young leaders in our community. 
His clinic is also an art gallery, a 
center that brings together young peo-
ple in our neighborhood for healthy ac-
tivities; uniting medicine and art to 
uplift our children. 
Dr. Tapia-Mendoza’s incredible story 
was the subject of a recent documen-
tary titled, ‘‘The Graffiti Artist Who 
Became a Doctor,’’ which was recently 
awarded an Emmy award. 
Mr. Speaker, I am here not only be-
cause he won that Emmy but because 
he also was there for the entire com-
munity during this horrible pandemic. 
He is a shining example of how tenac-
ity, artistry, and community intersect. 
I commend Dr. Tapia-Mendoza for his 
work and for using his story to inspire 
a new generation of our Latino youth.

DEFENDING RIGHTS OF 
ESSENTIAL CAREGIVERS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
New York (Ms. TENNEY) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. 
TENNEY. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
the 
COVID–19 pandemic exposed so many 
vulnerabilities in our communities, our 
economy, and our healthcare system. 
None of us were prepared for the end-
less virtual meetings, school closings, 
and weeks spent in quarantine. Nor 
could we have been ready for the tragic 
loss of our neighbors and loved ones 
who were living in long-term care fa-
cilities across the Nation. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today about the 
grave impact the negligent policies im-
plemented during the COVID–19 pan-
demic had on the most vulnerable in 
our communities. 
Over the past nearly 2 years, we 
watched our grandparents in nursing 
homes and our family and friends in 
group homes struggling to maintain 
their health, dignity, and will to go on 
as they were left without the care and 
attention they deserved over long peri-
ods of isolation. 
When I was sworn in to serve in the 
117th Congress, one of the first bills I 
introduced was the bipartisan Essen-
tial Caregivers Act. This bill is a crit-
ical step to ensure that residents of 
long-term care facilities are not left to 
suffer in isolation during this or any 
future public health emergency. 
While shut out from their family and 
loved ones in isolation, many long- 
term care residents began suffering 
from depression, extreme loneliness, 
and a major decline in mental and 
physical health. It is the injustice of 
this 
century 
that 
this 
is 
going 
unaddressed by Congress. 
Since introducing the Essential Care-
givers Act, we have started a coalition 
of passionate and tenacious fighters 
across the country. It is the Essential 
Caregivers Movement. 
With me today, I have a book au-
thored by Karla Abraham-Conley, an 
amazing constituent of mine who also 
was prohibited from providing the 
needed care for her mother because of 
negligent policies in place by our 
former Governor. This is her great 
book. It is absolutely beautiful. ‘‘Pro-
tecting Them to Death’’ is the title. 
Folded into each page of Karla’s book 
are harrowing stories from individuals 
who either lost a loved one in a long- 
term care facility or witnessed from a 
distance as their loved ones suffered 
from serious declines in their mental 
and physical health. 
These are not just the stories of New 
Yorkers. These are accounts from all 
across the Nation as you go through 
each part of this book. I could flip 
every page of this book and tell you a 
story from every single State. They are 
heartbreaking. They are cruel. Most 
importantly, they motivate those with 
the power and responsibility to make a 
meaningful change for our future. 
When I see this book, I see the ways 
our laws have failed our constituents. I 
see the pain, but I also see the oppor-
tunity on every page, a chance for this 
Congress to stand up on behalf of these 
hurting Americans and boldly say: I 
will act. I will defend your rights as an 
essential caregiver. 
Before I close, I would like to share 
an excerpt from Karla’s personal story. 
‘‘I was my mother’s essential caregiver 
every single day prior to the lockdown. 
Suddenly, I wasn’t there anymore, and 
she was incapable of understanding 
why.’’ 
Karla continues by saying her moth-
er ‘‘was left to die alone in her bed, and 
not from COVID–19. She said to me via 
a virtual visit, ‘Get me outta here. 
They’re going to kill me,’ which is ex-
actly what happened.’’ 
When Karla was shut off from her 
mother, her mother’s state of health 
rapidly declined. Karla’s mother devel-
oped sepsis, renal failure, high sodium 
levels, swelling of the brain, and other 
symptoms that went unnoticed. After 
Karla fought tooth and nail to admit 
her mother to the emergency room, her 
mother passed away a week later. 
Mr. Speaker, what you have heard is 
unacceptable by all standards, but it is 
just one of thousands of stories I want-
ed to share. 
I thank Karla and so many essential 
caregivers, 
including 
our 
own 
VoicesForSeniors, 
another 
advocacy 
group in New York State, for sharing 
this dark chapter in their lives. 
Not many people can turn grief into 
action and start a nationwide move-
ment. Yet, in a time of incredible sad-
ness and loss, so many strong men and 
women chose to stand up and do just 
that. I applaud their courage, their 
bravery, and their tenacity in this 
fight. I introduced the Essential Care-
givers Act for each of them and their 
loved ones. 
Mr. Speaker, I am honored to lead 
this fight in Congress, but I am not 
leading it alone. I am joined by our col-
leagues from both sides of the aisle, in-
cluding the bill’s cosponsor and co- 
lead, Congressman JOHN
LARSON
of 
Connecticut. We are so grateful for his 
advocacy as well. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge more of my col-
leagues to join us to pass this bill, to 
make it a reality and help these people 
who are advocating across the Nation 
to protect those who could be in this 
jeopardy in the future. I will remain 
committed to this fight for so many 
families who were forced to comply 
with the careless policies that pre-
vented them from caring for their 
loved ones. 
f 
BENEFITS FOR BURN PIT-EXPOSED 
VETERANS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
ESPAILLAT). The Chair recognizes the 
gentleman from California (Mr. RUIZ) 
for 5 minutes. 
Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise in sup-
port of my bill, the Burn Pit Registry 
Enhancement Act, which passed the 
House unanimously yesterday, and to 
urge a vote in the Senate. 
The Burn Pit Registry Enhancement 
Act would strengthen the registry by 
allowing a registered veteran’s data to 
be updated by their family with his or 
her cause of death. 
This data is crucial to identify the 
vast array of illnesses that are causing 
young burn pit-exposed veterans to die 
and will help doctors recognize early 
symptoms of life-threatening condi-
tions and save lives. 
As a Nation, we have a responsibility 
to provide our veterans with the bene-
fits they have earned and deserve. We 
bear that responsibility even more 
heavily when the use of burn pits by 
our own military is causing veterans to 
develop rare pulmonary conditions and 
cancers. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge the Senate to 
take up my legislation and uphold our 
commitment to taking care of our vet-
erans. 
ALEJANDRO CAMACHO’S STORY 
Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to tell the story of my constituent, 
Alejandro Camacho, of Palm Desert, a 
veteran who has been affected by our 
military’s use of toxic burn pits, and to 
call for action. 
After graduating from La Quinta 
High School, Alejandro served our Na-
tion in the U.S. Marine Corps. From 
March to September 2009, he was sta-
tioned in south Sinjar, Iraq. 
At great personal sacrifice to him-
self, Alejandro served as a member of 
the 3rd Light Armored Reconnaissance 
Battalion, even missing the birth of his 
own son, Jacob, while he was stationed 
overseas. 
Every single day in south Sinjar, 
Alejandro breathed in toxic fumes, par-
ticulate matter, and carcinogens from 
the batteries, medical waste, and jet 
fuel that was burned in large burn pits 
on his base. 
When he returned home, the effects 
of breathing in those toxic fumes start-
ed taking a toll on his body. In 2019, 
Alejandro 
was 
diagnosed 
with 
embryonal carcinoma, an aggressive 
form of testicular cancer. He and his 
doctor believed his diagnosis to be 
linked to his exposures to fumes from 
burning jet propulsion 8 fuel, a known 
human carcinogen. 
When Alejandro underwent the ex-
cruciating chemotherapy process, his 
body fell apart. He lost 50 pounds. He 
lost feeling in his hands and feet, and 
he constantly heard ringing in his ears. 
Despite being deemed 40 percent dis-
abled, despite his repeated exposure to 
jet fuel fumes, and despite the diag-
nosis, the VA denied his claim for cov-
erage. Do you know why? Because the 
VA said there wasn’t ‘‘enough evi-
dence’’ to establish a connection be-
tween his burn pit exposure and the 
cancer he developed. 
Mr. Speaker, I am an emergency 
medicine physician and a public health 
expert, and in public health and in 
medicine, it is practice that if there is

a high enough suspicion based on the 
evidence available of a harm that 
causes a severe enough illness, then we 
need to act on that suspicion. 
We can’t afford to wait decades, like 
we did with Agent Orange, for that per-
fect study to establish a perfect cau-
sality between burn pit exposure and 
cancers and pulmonary conditions our 
veterans are developing and dying from 
right now. There is enough evidence to 
act. 
We 
must 
act 
for 
veterans 
like 
Alejandro 
and 
help 
him 
get 
the 
healthcare and benefits he earned when 
we sent him to war for our country. 
Alejandro is now cancer free, but the 
fight continues to get him the benefits 
he deserves. 
We 
are 
making 
real 
bipartisan 
progress on this front, with legislation 
like the Honoring our PACT Act, which 
takes an aggressive and comprehensive 
approach to the urgent healthcare cri-
sis that veterans like Alejandro are 
facing. 
This legislation will keep our Na-
tion’s promise to our veterans that we 
will take care of them after they serve 
our Nation. It contains my bill, the 
Presumptive Benefits for War Fighters 
Exposed to Burn Pits and Other Toxins 
Act. It creates a presumption of serv-
ice-related illnesses due to burn pits in 
order to take care of our veterans. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge this body to take 
up this bill to support Alejandro and 
the rest of our heroes in uniform. 
f 
INFLATION CRUSHING HOLIDAY 
BUDGETS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. MEUSER) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, Ameri-
cans are feeling the pinch of rising 
prices as they are gearing up to both 
host and visit their families and friends 
this holiday season. 
Thanksgiving is just around the cor-
ner, and it is shaping up to be the most 
expensive meal in the history of the 
holiday due to rising costs, largely 
from President Biden and Democrats’ 
failed economic policies. 
Inflation is at a 30-year high, crush-
ing American holiday budgets from the 
cost of travel, food, and gifts. The price 
of gasoline, Mr. Speaker, is up 61 per-
cent—nearly 
$4 
nationally—from 
a 
year ago, causing the price of driving 
and flying to see relatives skyrocket. 
Many Americans are now facing the de-
cision to cancel holiday travel due to 
these rising costs. 
Most holiday staple foods are signifi-
cantly more expensive as well, if Amer-
icans are lucky enough to find them on 
the grocery shelves due to the supply 
chain crisis we are facing. 
The cost of turkey is up about 20 per-
cent. Potatoes are up about 15 percent. 
Carrots are up almost 50 percent. Cran-
berries and biscuits are up nearly 10 
percent. And even pumpkin pie is way 
up. 
On average, a Thanksgiving meal 
this year will cost families between 15 
to 20 percent more than it did just 1 
year ago today. With the rising cost of 
energy and essential goods, nearly one- 
third of working families’ earnings are 
going to food and energy costs. 
Instead of finding ways to offset this, 
mitigate it, improve and fix the supply 
chain crisis, and bring domestic energy 
back to minimize these skyrocketing 
energy costs, President Biden and my 
colleagues in the Democratic Caucus in 
this House continue to push for a his-
torically 
large 
multitrillion-dollar 
spending bill called Build Back Better 
that will raise taxes and seriously dam-
age domestic energy production, which 
I completely don’t understand, nor 
does anyone in my district. 
As well, it has special interest tax 
cuts, and it will not cost zero. Can we 
please stop insulting the people? It will 
cost trillions, all the while suppressing 
our economy and opportunity. 
When you are in a hole, Mr. Speaker, 
you don’t keep digging, but our Demo-
crat friends continue to push for far- 
left policies that will further drive in-
flation by creating excess demand with 
no building of supply, which hurts low- 
income and middle-class families the 
hardest. 
Now is the time for Congress to pass 
pro-growth, free market legislation 
that will actually empower our econ-
omy and put more money into the 
pockets of the American taxpayer, not 
in the coffers of Washington. 
Mr. Speaker, the solutions are actu-
ally kind of simple. We must follow our 
rule book, which is known as the Con-
stitution. We must respect and abide 
by our oath to the Constitution, not 
with some crazy mandates coming out 
of Washington. We must strengthen 
our national security, including secur-
ing our borders. 
We must strengthen our economy, 
not grow our government. No one in 
my district is saying, hey, the Federal 
Government is not big enough. Let’s 
expand it by 30 percent. 
We must continue to focus on mak-
ing America the land of opportunity, 
the land of independence, not the land 
of dependence. That is not what we 
wrote way back when. This is done 
through education and through driving 
career opportunities. 
Mr. Speaker, we, as well, need to 
have an understanding that it is our 
job to be the adults in the room and be 
fiscally responsible with the taxpayers’ 
money. It is not our money; it is the 
taxpayers’ money. 
So the American people deserve bet-
ter. They deserve better from this 
House. We need to deliver. Truly, the 
idea of America depends upon it.

INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS 
IN THE STATE OF TEXAS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. GARCIA) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to celebrate the critical in-
vestments coming to my home State of 
Texas. 
This week, the President signed the 
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs 
Act. This bipartisan bill is bringing 
over $35 billion to Texas for important 
projects that will rebuild our commu-
nities. The fact is, Mr. Speaker, that 
this is long overdue. 
When I was a Harris County commis-
sioner, I built a few roads. I saw first-
hand how badly our roads and bridges 
had deteriorated. We regularly scored 
Cs and Ds on infrastructure that my 
precinct relied on every day, creating 
extra costs and putting lives in danger. 
In fact, roads in terrible condition have 
forced Texas drivers to pay over $700 in 
extra costs each year. Since 2011, Tex-
ans have seen their commute increase 
to about half an hour because our roads 
haven’t kept up with our growth. 
In that same time, Texans were hit 
with 60 extreme weather events that 
cost taxpayers over $200 billion. More 
than that, crumbling infrastructure 
has taken the lives of thousands in our 
great State. Just this February our 
electric grid nearly collapsed, and over 
200 people—many of them seniors— 
froze to death in their homes. 
We are past due in the work to im-
prove our State’s infrastructure. That 
is why I am proud to have voted for 
this jobs bill and for all of the invest-
ments coming to Texas. 
The bill that we passed is over $3.5 
billion to weatherize our grid and pre-
pare it for future crises. We also invest 
$27 billion in our State’s highways and 
bridges. We will also get $3 billion to 
bring safe, clean water to every Texan, 
especially in our rural communities. 
This is not small potatoes. 
We know how dangerous lead pipes 
are for growing children. Lead con-
tamination can cause developmental 
problems, mental health issues, and se-
rious medical emergencies. Because of 
this funding, we can remove lead pipes 
from Texas schools and ensure that 
every child can drink clean, safe water. 
Thanks to all of these investments, 
Texans will have safer commutes, 
cleaner water, and lower bills for reli-
able electricity. 
But this law does not solve just to-
day’s problems. It prepares us for to-
morrow’s opportunities. Thanks to this 
law, Texas will receive nearly half a 
billion dollars to expand the electric 
vehicle charging network. We will also 
receive over $1 billion to improve our 
State’s airports which are some of the 
Nation’s busiest. We can also expect 
over $100 million to bring internet ac-
cess to 1 million Texans who currently 
lack it. This is especially important to 
rural Texans like my sister who has to 
drive all the way into town to get to 
the library to access the internet. 
Mr. Speaker, it is time to solve these 
problems and create jobs for our com-
munity. That is what this law is going 
to do. The bill will create thousands of 
jobs in my State from construction

workers and laborers to engineers and 
scientists, and all of these are good- 
paying jobs. For every mile of road 
that is repaved from Houston to El 
Paso, we will be supporting roadway 
workers and construction workers. For 
every electrical line that is repaired to 
be more reliable in the cold, we will be 
supporting electricians and engineers. 
And for every lead pipe that is replaced 
to keep our children safe, we will be 
supporting 
plumbers, 
laborers, 
and 
other workers. 
Altogether, the Infrastructure In-
vestment and Jobs Act is just about 
that: rebuilding our infrastructure, in-
vesting in the future, and bringing 
jobs, jobs, jobs to our communities. 
I am looking forward to seeing these 
projects come together in my home 
State, and I am grateful for the leader-
ship of our President and this Congress 
in making sure that this can get to all 
communities in our country. 
Together we will truly build back 
better for Texas. 
f 
HISTORIC INFRASTRUCTURE 
INVESTMENTS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Massachusetts (Mrs. TRAHAN) for 5 
minutes. 
Mrs. TRAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of the Build Back Bet-
ter Act. 
Together with the historic infra-
structure investments signed into law 
by President Biden earlier this week, 
working families like the one I grew up 
in will be able to get back on their feet 
and succeed in an economy that finally 
works for them. 
Now, I have talked about my child-
hood on the floor of the people’s House 
before. My dad was a union ironworker, 
and like his union brothers and sisters 
have done for decades, he worked long, 
hard hours to provide for my three sis-
ters and me. When there wasn’t work 
for him at home in Massachusetts, he 
would travel out of State erecting 
bridges and buildings in New York, 
Maine, and other places, sometimes for 
months at a time. 
As a first generation American, a 
union job with benefits was better than 
most had, and it is certainly the reason 
I am standing here today. But the de-
mands of my dad’s job placed limita-
tions on what my mom could do for 
work. Despite the wages and benefits 
secured by his union, my parents 
couldn’t afford childcare for four girls. 
So my mom picked up jobs where she 
could to help make ends meet. Whether 
it was clerical work, cleaning homes, 
hostessing, or caring for kids, she did 
anything and everything possible to 
pay the bills while also making sure 
she was home to care for us when my 
dad was away. 
Here is the thing: My family’s story 
is not unique, not in the slightest. In 
fact, it is a story shared by millions of 
working families across our country 
who show up to work each day but 
don’t have the support they need to get 
ahead. 
My mom’s story is one that is shared 
by millions of working moms who want 
nothing more than to return to work 
and support their families but can’t be-
cause the math doesn’t work, giving 
them no choice but to stay at home 
and care for their families instead. 
Mr. Speaker, under President Biden’s 
leadership we are going to flip that 
script. 
The infrastructure package he signed 
into law earlier this week will create 
millions of jobs with family sustaining 
wages and benefits by repairing our 
roads, our bridges, our water systems, 
and more. 
But creating millions of jobs only 
works if workers are ready to fill them. 
That is why we are also working to 
pass the Build Back Better Act which 
will make unprecedented investments 
in working families. Families that con-
tinue to be the backbone of our coun-
try that we all have the honor of rep-
resenting. 
By 
expanding 
access 
to 
quality 
childcare, providing paid family and 
medical leave, establishing universal 
pre-K, and making home care afford-
able for our seniors, this legislation 
will 
propel 
parents—especially 
our 
working moms—back into the work-
force and full participation in our 
economy. 
By lowering healthcare costs and 
driving down prescription drug prices, 
the Build Back Better Act will ensure 
that families no longer have to choose 
between their health and their ability 
to put food on the table. By cutting 
taxes for low-income and middle-class 
Americans and extending the child tax 
credit payment that has served as a 
lifeline for so many, this package will 
keep money in families’ pockets. 
Passage of the Build Back Better Act 
will ensure that no one is left behind as 
we defeat COVID and rebuild our econ-
omy. That is why these provisions are 
supported by an overwhelming major-
ity of Americans—Democrats, Repub-
licans and Independents alike. Like 
President Biden, they recognize that 
when we invest in working families, 
America wins. 
Now, if my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle need to hear more 
about why they should support this 
bill, please let me know. My mom, 
Linda Loureiro, is happy to call you 
and tell you what the Build Back Bet-
ter Act would have done for her and 
moms like yours 40 years ago and why 
we need to get it done for her children 
and her grandchildren today. 
f 
NATIONAL APPRENTICE WEEK 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, our col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
who believe that the Build Back Better 
Act is going to make this country bet-
ter are trying to sell snake oil to the 
American people. There is an old say-
ing, Mr. Speaker: You can fool some of 
the people all of the time, all of the 
people some of the time, but you can’t 
fool all of the people all of the time. 
Frankly, the American people—some 
of them—have seen the light, and they 
understand that Build Back Better is 
going to bankrupt this country and 
that is not the way most Americans 
want to go. So we will see if the people 
who vote for Build Back Better have 
the real support of the American peo-
ple next year if that bill passes. 
Mr. Speaker, this is National Appren-
ticeship Week, and it is fitting that as 
the lead Republican on the Education 
and Labor Committee that we talk 
about the importance of apprentice-
ships. 
As we know, apprenticeships have 
been around since the beginning of 
time and they have been much more 
used in other countries. They were 
much used in our country for a long, 
long time. Then the numbers of them 
decreased. However, in recent years 
more and more Americans have found 
that apprenticeship programs are an ef-
fective option to help achieve their ca-
reer goals. 
I have had people in my family go 
through apprenticeship programs, and I 
know for a fact how valuable they are. 
These earn-and-learn programs offer 
students and workers a viable path to-
ward the American Dream, and it is 
very fitting that we should celebrate 
National 
Apprenticeship 
Week 
and 
highlight the apprenticeship programs 
across the country. 
However, unfortunately, the Biden 
administration is proposing to end the 
program dedicated to expanding ap-
prenticeships, cutting off this impor-
tant pathway to sustainable and re-
warding careers. By ending Industry- 
Recognized Apprenticeship Programs, 
or IRAP, President Biden is hurting 
workers and businesses nationwide. 
This decision moves our country back-
ward and will keep many Americans 
from being able to prepare for their fu-
ture. 
Instead of ending IRAPs, we should 
be working to inject innovation and 
flexibility 
into 
the 
apprenticeship 
model so that more Americans can get 
back to work and achieve the Amer-
ican Dream, no putting roadblocks in 
their way. Unfortunately, it is becom-
ing more and more clear with every ac-
tion of the Biden administration that 
the American worker is always going 
to take a backseat in President Biden’s 
America.

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Keep us alert, O God, in body, mind, 
and spirit, that in all that the day pre-
sents, we would remain attentive and 
faithful to the calling to which You 
have called each of us. 
Give strength to those among us 
whose bodies are burdened with the 
strain of long hours of weighty work, 
miles of travel to stay connected with 
constituents, or the vestiges of illness 
or injury. 
Give 
inspiration 
to 
those 
whose 
minds are wrought with innumerable 
issues for which they are held account-
able, facts and figures and derivative 
impacts that confound reason and tax 
the brain. 
Give respite to those whose spirits 
are weary from the challenges to their 
integrity, misgivings of their sense of 
purpose, and threats to their moral and 
ethical underpinnings. 
In You, O Lord, we find our strength, 
our inspiration, and our respite. May 
we turn to You throughout this day 
that we would find all that we need to 
remain steadfast and faithful in our 
service to You and to this Nation. 
In the power of Your name we pray. 
Amen.

Mr. WILSON of South Carolina led

lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
The SPEAKER. The Chair will enter-

PRIORITIZING LOCAL HIRES 
(Ms. BASS asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. BASS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the bipartisan Infra-
structure Investment and Jobs Act, 
which includes a local hire provision 
that I offered to allow local transpor-
tation projects like the Los Angeles 
Metro to prioritize the hiring of local 
Angelenos for projects that are taking 
place in their own backyard. 
My district has recently had two 
major construction projects. On the 
Westside, it is the Purple Line, which 
is going to connect UCLA to downtown 
L.A. In South L.A., it is the Crenshaw 
Line, which is going to bring a vital 
means of public transportation to 
neighborhoods historically neglected 
when it comes to economic investment. 
It really didn’t make sense that peo-
ple living in the neighborhoods where 
the projects were going through could 
not be prioritized for the jobs. That is 
why this provision is so important. 
With the local hire provision signed 
into law, people in Los Angeles neigh-
borhoods can be prioritized for jobs in 
L.A. We are bringing thousands of well- 
paying jobs to Los Angeles and putting 
tax dollars back into the communities 
that paid for the projects in the first 
place. 
f 
THREAT TAGS 
(Mr. CLINE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, being a 
parent is a sacred responsibility, and 
every parent simply wants what is best 
for their kids. That is why, over the 
past year, we saw parents speak up at 
local school board meetings all across 
the country. 
Whether it was pushing back against 
the radical teachings of critical race 
theory or voicing their opposition to 
mask mandates or allowing boys in 
girls’ bathrooms, parents were stand-
ing up for their kids. 
However, the National School Board 
Association deemed people exercising 
their First Amendment rights as do-
mestic terrorists, and the Department 
of Justice used this narrative to launch 
investigations into parents. 
Now we are learning from a whistle-
blower 
that 
the 
FBI 
was 
using 
antiterror tools to monitor parents and 
adding threat tags to files to track 
them. This is absurd. We should never 
criminalize parents for speaking up for 
their children. 
To make matters worse, we now 
know the Attorney General lied under 
oath when he said there was no coordi-
nation between the DOJ and the Na-
tional School Board Association. This 
administration 
has 
weaponized 
the 
DOJ for political gain and has chosen 
to stand with teachers unions over par-
ents and students. 
These actions are tyrannical, and 
Congress must know the extent to 
which parents were spied on. 
f 
BUILD BACK BETTER AGENDA 
PUTS FAMILIES FIRST 
(Ms. SEWELL asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. SEWELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to urge my colleagues to vote in 
favor of President Biden’s historic 
Build Back Better agenda. 
Already, 
congressional 
Democrats 
have come together to pass part one of 
the Build Back Better agenda. The bi-
partisan Infrastructure Investment and 
Jobs Act is the largest investment in 
United States infrastructure in nearly 
a century, and it will benefit my State 
of Alabama in so many ways. 
It will provide $5.2 billion to repair 
Alabama’s roads, $225 million to fix 
Alabama’s bridges, and $100 million to 
connect every Alabamian to high-speed 
internet. 
Now we have the opportunity to pass 
part two, the Build Back Better Act. 
That, too, will invest in Alabama by 
creating millions of good-paying jobs; 
providing affordable childcare for over 
300,000 
Alabamians; 
lowering 
healthcare costs for families, including 
300,000 Alabamians who fall into the 
Medicaid coverage gap; and delivering 
universal pre-K to over 110,000 Alabama 
3- and 4-year-olds. 
As co-chair of the Ways and Means 
Racial Equity Initiative, I have fought 
to ensure that equity remains a central 
focus, and I am proud that these bills 
will uplift our most vulnerable commu-
nities in so many transformative ways. 
It is fully paid for. I ask my col-
leagues to vote in favor of the Build 
Back Better Act. 
f 
BIDEN INFLATION CRISIS 
(Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, the Biden inflation crisis has 
hit the poor and middle-income fami-
lies the hardest. 
Inflation just reached a 30-year high, 
and consumer prices have increased to 
an astonishing 6.2 percent compared to 
12 months ago. This has serious im-
pacts on hardworking families as they 
try to make ends meet and prepare for 
the holiday season. 
Are you planning on buying a 16- 
pound turkey? Be prepared to pay 18 
percent more this year. That does not 
even include the stuffing. 
Are you planning on driving to visit 
family for the holidays? Plan on paying 
61 percent more in gas prices than last 
year. 
Instead of taking action to rein in 
wasteful government spending and ad-
dress rising costs, the White House is 
claiming a vote for the Build Back Bet-
ter plan will solve the inflation crisis, 
which is a complete lie any way you 
look at it. 
Their socialist spending plan will add 
more fuel to the inflation crisis and 
worsen their self-made supply chain 
crisis. 
It is no wonder a majority of Ameri-
cans disapprove of President Biden’s 
handling of the economy, and it gets 
worse every single day. 
Americans cannot afford to fund the 
Democrats’ liberal wish list, and it is

INVESTING IN BROADBAND IS 
ESSENTIAL 
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam 
Speaker, 
high-quality, 
high-speed 
broadband is essential in today’s inter-
connected and interdependent world. 
Underserved communities throughout 
America need internet access for edu-
cation, transportation, and healthcare 
services and to realize the full poten-
tial of all of our citizens. 
The American Rescue Plan provides 
money, lots of money, for State and 
local 
governments 
to 
expand 
broadband. The bipartisan infrastruc-
ture law builds on that effort by mak-
ing 
a 
$65 
billion 
investment 
in 
broadband. 
Madam Speaker, I urge the Federal 
Government and local governments in 
western New York to move quickly and 
effectively to ensure everyone can real-
ize their full potential with access to 
quality, high-speed broadband.

HONORING THE CAREER OF 
ROBERT LARSON 
(Mr. NEWHOUSE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the career of one of 
my constituents, Robert Larson, and 
congratulate him on his retirement. 
For 27 years, Bob served as commis-
sioner of the Port of Benton and has 
dedicated himself to serving his neigh-
bors and his community. 
Thanks to Bob’s efforts, the U.S. 
Navy and the Port of Benton were able 
to partner to bring a section of the 
USS Triton submarine to Richland in 
honor of veterans who served in Navy 
submarines. 
From 
strengthening 
local 
supply 
chains to preserving the history of the 
Hanford Site and so much more, Bob’s 
contributions to the Port of Benton, 
the greater Tri-Cities, the State of 
Washington, and our country are a true 
testament to his spirit of service. 
As a lifelong Washingtonian, on be-
half of the people of the Fourth Con-
gressional District, I extend my heart-
felt thanks to Bob for his decades of 
public service and wish him all the best 
in retirement.

OIL COMPANIES’ COSTS GO DOWN 
WHILE FUEL PRICES GO UP 
(Mr. LIEU asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. LIEU. Madam Speaker, I am 
upset about inflation. As our economy 
reopens and demand surges, big cor-
porations have taken advantage. They 
have squeezed consumers for profit and 
raised costs on everyday Americans. 
Corporate greed is a primary reason 
why costs for American businesses and 
families have gone up. I will give you 
one example. 
The cost of refining oil has gone 
down, yet gas prices went up. Let me 
repeat that again. The costs to oil com-
panies have gone down, and fuel prices 
went up. 
That is why I am joining President 
Biden in calling on the Federal Trade 
Commission to investigate whether oil 
and gas companies are engaging in 
anticompetitive or potentially illegal 
behavior to jack up your gas prices.

REJECT CRADLE-TO-GRAVE 
SOCIALISM 
(Mr. WALBERG asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. 
WALBERG. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
shortly, this body will begin debating 
the most radical and expensive spend-
ing bill in our Nation’s history. 
Shockingly, Democrats are intent on 
moving forward without the CBO’s 
final cost analysis. But independent es-
timates put the bill’s price tag around 
$4 
trillion, 
twice 
what 
Democrats 
claim. This level of reckless and un-
paid-for spending is unsustainable. 
On top of that, the problematic pro-
visions in this bill are a mile long. It 
will heighten the border crisis, under-
mine American energy, and worsen the 
inflation crisis. It will raise taxes on 
hardworking families and calls for hir-
ing 87,000 new IRS agents. 
Unbelievably, one of the biggest 
parts of this bill is a special tax break 
for the wealthy. The list of problems 
goes on and on, but the bottom line is 
this massive bill represents cradle-to- 
grave socialism. That is not what 
America stands for. 
Madam Speaker, please join me and 
reject this radical legislation.

HONORING DONALD L. HARRIS 
(Mr. PAYNE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1

Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to praise a great man from my 
district after his passing recently. Don-
ald Harris was a developer with a con-
science, a visionary, a dreamer, a 
thinker. He helped rebuild Newark and 
created housing projects in areas that 
needed redevelopment. 
His housing projects were more than 
just buildings. Mr. Harris used them to 
educate new residents on proper home-
ownership and how to move forward in 
this economy to sustain their lives. He 
made sure his projects created more 
opportunities for African Americans 
and other minorities. That is why he 
earned the Golden Broom Award for 
improving Newark’s quality of life. 
He was a man whose faith guided him 
to help those in need. He was an exam-
ple for all of us to follow. 
Madam Speaker, I am here to honor 
Donald Laverne Harris for a life well 
lived.

(Mr. VALADAO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. VALADAO. Madam Speaker, last 
month, I led the California Republican 
delegation in a letter to Secretary of 
the Interior Haaland and Secretary of 
Commerce Raimondo regarding the re-
initiation of consultation on the 2019 
biological opinions for the long-term 
operations 
of 
the 
Central 
Valley 
Project and the State Water Project. 
Despite our request for a response, 
we did not receive an answer by the set 
deadline. This issue is critical to my 
constituents in the Central Valley. 
Failure to provide answers to our ur-
gent questions is unacceptable. 
This week, I led another letter to 
Secretaries Haaland and Raimondo. 
Once again, we are demanding answers 
regarding 
the 
administration’s 
antiscience decision, which threatens 
the livelihoods of Central Valley farm-
ers and families. 
Madam Speaker, my colleagues and I 
will not back down, and I urgently re-
quest attention and response to this 
issue. 
f 
RECOGNIZING THE CAREER OF 
RANDY ROSENBAUM 
(Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize the distin-
guished career of an extraordinary 
Rhode 
Islander, 
my 
friend 
Randy 
Rosenbaum. 
For 27 years, Randy has served as the 
executive director of the Rhode Island 
State Council on the Arts, where he 
helped Rhode Island artists to share 
their gifts and talents with the rest of 
the world. 
From the up-and-coming artist to the 
well-established, the young artists to 
the old, Randy lifted up the work of a 
diverse, new generation of Rhode Is-
land artists. 
To put it simply, he is to the Rhode 
Island arts community what the smile 
is to the Mona Lisa. 
Randy has left an indelible mark on 
the Rhode Island arts scene, increasing 
RISCA funding ninefold, putting the 
Ocean State on the map as a film loca-
tion, and supporting Rhode Island’s $2 
billion arts economy. 
Randy’s leadership, now that he is re-
tiring after 30 years at the helm of 
RISCA, will surely be missed, but his 
legacy lives on through his countless 
accomplishments. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
congratulate 
Randy on his retirement, and I wish 
him all the best in his next chapter.

BIDEN INFLATION THANKSGIVING 
TAX 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, Thanksgiving 2021 
will be the most expensive meal in the 
history of the holiday. You pay with 
Biden inflation, build back bankrupt. A 
typical meal will cost more than ever. 
The Aiken Standard newspaper car-
toon today is correct. Some specific 
price increases include turkey up 27 
percent, carrots up 47 percent, potatoes 
13 percent, and cranberries up 5.2 per-
cent, in addition to gas up 61 percent 
and home heating bills up 54 percent. 
These are brutal realities for families 
as we celebrate being an American 
with Thanksgiving. 
Democrat elite think they are smart-
er than anyone, and they think Demo-
crat voters are ignorant to believe $5 
trillion in spending costs zero dollars. 
You pay with Biden inflation. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops 
who successfully protected America for 
20 years in the global war on terrorism 
as it continues moving from the Af-
ghanistan haven to America. 
Congratulations to the mayor-elect 
of 
Columbia, 
Republican 
Daniel 
Rickenmann, who is the first Repub-
lican in 40 years for the capital city 
elected yesterday. 
f 
EASING INFLATION 
(Mr. COHEN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, con-
trary to the remarks from my friend 
from South Carolina, leading econo-
mists in this country say that the 
Build Back Better bill will help on in-
flation. It will ease inflationary meas-
ures. It is important that we pass the 
Build Back Better bill if we are going 
to deal with inflation. 
Build Back Better, the Reuters Agen-
cy says Biden’s spending plan will not 
add to inflationary pressure. 
Mark Zandi, the chief economist at 
Moody’s Analytics, said, ‘‘The bills do 
not add to inflation pressures, as the 
policies help to lift long-term economic 
growth via stronger productivity and 
labor force growth, and thus take the 
edge off of inflation.’’ 
Madam Speaker, 17 Nobel Prize win-
ners in economics have already stated 
they believe the Build Back Better bill 
will ease longer term inflationary pres-
sures. 
So it is not an inflation problem. In 
fact, by passing the bipartisan infra-
structure bill, we make it easier for 
people to get to work and for goods to 
get to market. Improving our ports, 
our airports with cargo, our highways, 
and our rail, all of those things, make 
it easier for us to work against infla-
tion and to get goods to market and 
improve the economy. 
So we should pass Build Back Better, 
and hurray Biden. 
f 
RAISE THE FLAG OF FREEDOM 
(Mr. CAWTHORN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. CAWTHORN. Madam Speaker, 
the Halls of this hallowed Republic 
have become darkened with the smut 
and filth of corrupted justice. 
Imagine: a predawn raid. Waking 
from a dead sleep in sheer terror to 
men with guns screaming and search-
ing furiously for damning evidence 
against their authoritarian master. 
This horrifying vision is not pulled 
from the pages of some graphic novel. 
This was last week’s headlines. 
A dedicated group of whistleblowing 
journalists, including James O’Keefe, 
faced illegal raids by the FBI to con-
fiscate personal cellphones and crucial 
documents that incriminate tyrant Joe 
Biden. 
Madam Speaker, why do you sit in si-
lence while the White House’s secret 
police round up dissenters? 
Why do you sit in silence while dili-
gent journalists face harassment at the 
hands of left-wing enforcers? 
There is no greater tyranny than 
that which is perpetrated under the 
shield of law and in the name of jus-
tice. The flag of freedom lies in tatters 
when liberty is crushed beneath the 
heavy hand of a totalitarian regime. 
Hear my message loud and clear: The 
American people will raise that flag of 
freedom, and it will fly high again very 
soon. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
MCCOLLUM). Members are reminded to 
refrain from engaging in personalities 
toward the President. 
f 
HOLD MEMBERS ACCOUNTABLE 
FOR VIOLENT SPEECH 
(Ms. WILLIAMS of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Ms. WILLIAMS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise in support of the House 
resolution calling for the immediate 
censure of Representative PAUL GOSAR. 
Posting an edited video on social media 
depicting 
violence 
against 
another 
Member of this body is reprehensible. 
Make no mistakes, violent speech 
breeds violent actions. On my third day 
of Congress, I learned exactly how dan-
gerous words of leaders in this country 
can be. Allowing this type of dangerous 
messaging to go unchecked puts all of 
our lives at risk. Following the Janu-
ary 6 attacks, my family had to get se-
curity for our safety. I never imagined 
having to drop my kindergartner off at 
school with security in tow. 
This 
routine 
brand 
of 
violence 
against women in politics is a direct 
attempt to silence us. We can hold dif-
ferent opinions and disagree, but vio-
lent hate speech is unacceptable in any 
party. Leaders in Congress must be 
held accountable for their actions. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this basic standard 
of conduct and join me in holding my 
colleague accountable. 
f 
CATTLE MARKET INTEGRITY 
(Mrs. MILLER of Illinois asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, our Nation’s cattle ranchers 
are going bankrupt and yet, the price 
of beef remains expensive and con-
tinues to rise. 
The price disparities between live 
cattle prices and wholesale beef rise in 
tandem with historic levels of consoli-
dation in the meat packing sector and 
minimal levels of competition in the 
marketplace. 
My colleagues and I, along with cat-
tle producers nationwide, are asking 
for action to strengthen the integrity 
of the cattle market and are requesting 
an update on the Department of Jus-
tice’s investigation into the four larg-
est meatpackers in the United States. 
We must determine if any manipula-
tion, collusion, or other illegal activity 
may be occurring in order to ensure 
market transparency. 
It is vital for the continuation of the 
American beef industry that market 
manipulation is identified. We must 
stand with our farmers and ranchers 
for fair, competitive, and free market 
business practices. 
f 
BIPARTISAN INFRASTRUCTURE 
BILL 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
there was such exhilaration across the 
Nation as Democrats came together 
last week and moved forward on the bi-
partisan infrastructure bill with their 
vote and to catapult forward the build 
back America bill as well. 
Let me say how happy my constitu-
ents are for the $2.3 billion that will 
clean the water of old schools, homes, 
and apartments. This is something 
that we all fought together for. 
But I am excited about the future of 
this week passing BBB because I fought 
to reinsert the family medical leave 
and as well to ensure that all of us 
have an opportunity to have healthcare 
across America; Texas being the poster 
child for the uninsured. Madam Speak-
er, 766,000 will get insurance now be-
cause of the Build Back Better Act. 
There is breaking news, and the 
breaking news is inflation is not caused 
by the Build Back Better or the bipar-
tisan bill. It is caused by corporate 
greed; they put the price on goods. 
But, Madam Speaker, with the work 
of the Biden administration and Demo-
crats in Congress, we are going to see 
the economy drive for all of America, 
inflation no more.

COLLABORATION 
BETWEEN 
THE 
KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS 
AND THE UNITED STATES 
(Mr. HUIZENGA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize a symbol of 
true bilateral relations and collabora-
tion between the Kingdom of the Neth-
erlands and the United States. 
One hundred years ago, a group of 
Dutch Americans, including Franklin 
D. 
Roosevelt, 
established 
the 
Netherland-America Foundation. The 
creation of this foundation, commonly 
known as NAF, has spurred innovation 
and cooperation between our two na-
tions through engagement with the 
arts, business, and public policy. 
NAF works alongside the Caucus on 
the Kingdom of the Netherlands, which 
I am proud to co-chair, to strengthen 
the existing relationship between the 
United States and the Kingdom of the 
Netherlands. 
The Dutch-American network has es-
tablished deep connections throughout 
both of our nations, which is evident 
by the many NAF chapters spread from 
coast to coast here in the United 
States, including in my home area of 
west Michigan, as well as the Nether-
lands. 
One of the greatest examples of ex-
changes between our nations is the 
prestigious NAF-Fulbright Fellowships 
that enable the foundation to offer 
awards to Dutch and American schol-
ars pursuing graduate study degrees. 
I 
am 
honored 
to 
recognize 
the 
Netherland-America Foundation and 
its 100-year record of success in cele-
brating our shared heritage and en-
hancing our cultural exchange. These 
strong bonds will continue to build on 
our past successes and develop a more 
prosperous and mutually beneficial re-
lationship in the future. 
f 
BOLSTERING OUR NATION’S 
CRUMBLING INFRASTRUCTURE 
(Ms. BROWNLEY asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. BROWNLEY. Madam Speaker, 
since day one, Democrats have dili-
gently worked with the Biden adminis-
tration to bolster our economy and re-
build our Nation’s crumbling infra-
structure. 
Earlier this month Democrats deliv-
ered on their promise to the American 
people by passing the bipartisan Infra-
structure Investments and Jobs Act. 
The need for this historic investment 
in our roads and bridges and public 
transit and rail systems is clear in 
every State and every community 
throughout our country. 
Democrats not only delivered one of 
the largest Federal investments in our 
Nation’s infrastructure, but we are de-
livering access to broadband and high- 
speed internet, and we are delivering 
clean and reliable drinking water to 
America’s families. 
The 
bipartisanship 
infrastructure 
deal makes bold investments in our fu-
ture by creating good-paying American 
jobs, fighting back against the climate 
crisis, and rebuilding our economy 
from the middle out. 
We must continue to build on this 
success—ensuring our democracy deliv-
ers for the people—by passing Presi-
dent 
Biden’s 
transformative 
Build 
Back Better Act.

COMMUNICATION FROM THE 
CLERK OF THE HOUSE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Clerk of the House of 
Representatives: 
OFFICE OF THE CLERK, 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC, November 17, 2021. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR MADAM SPEAKER: Pursuant to the 
permission granted in Clause 2(h) of Rule II 
of the Rules of the U.S. House of Representa-
tives, the Clerk received the following mes-
sage from the Secretary of the Senate on No-
vember 17, 2021, at 11:22 a.m.: 
That the Senate agreed to Relative to the 
death of the Honorable Joseph Maxwell 
Cleland former United States Senator from 
the State of Georgia—S. Res. 451. 
With best wishes, I am, 
Sincerely, 
CHERYL L. JOHNSON,

PROVIDING 
FOR 
CONSIDERATION 
OF H. RES. 789, CENSURING REP-
RESENTATIVE PAUL GOSAR 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, by 
direction of the Committee on Rules, I 
call up House Resolution 795 and ask 
for its immediate consideration. 
The Clerk read the resolution, as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 795 
Resolved, That upon adoption of this reso-
lution it shall be in order without interven-
tion of any point of order to consider in the 
House the resolution (H. Res. 789) censuring 
Representative Paul Gosar. The amendment 
to the resolution printed in the report of the 
Committee on Rules accompanying this res-
olution shall be considered as adopted. The 
resolution, as amended, shall be considered 
as read. The previous question shall be con-
sidered as ordered on the resolution and pre-
amble, as amended, to adoption without in-
tervening motion or demand for division of 
the question except one hour of debate equal-
ly divided and controlled by the chair and 
ranking minority member of the Committee 
on Ethics or their respective designees. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Pennsylvania is recog-
nized for 1 hour. 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, for 
the purpose of debate only, I yield the 
customary 30 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma (Mr. COLE), 
who is the distinguished ranking mem-
ber of the Rules Committee, pending 
which I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. During consideration of 
this resolution, all time yielded is for 
the purpose of debate only. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers be given 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, yes-
terday the Rules Committee met and 
reported a rule, House Resolution 795, 
providing for consideration of H. Res. 
789, Censuring Representative PAUL 
GOSAR, under a closed rule. The rule 
self-executes a manager’s amendment 
from Chairman DEUTCH and provides 1 
hour of general debate equally divided 
and controlled by the chair and rank-
ing minority member of the Committee 
on Ethics or their respective designees. 
b 1230 
Madam Speaker, in any other Con-
gress, the actions of Representative 
PAUL GOSAR might be easier to dismiss. 
After all, every single minute of every 
single day, 5,000 minutes of content are 
uploaded onto YouTube. 
So my colleagues across the aisle or 
the public might ask, who cares about 
one YouTube video post by Representa-
tive GOSAR? He is just one of many 
Americans posting his fantasies online, 
even if his involve a violent scene in 
which he attacks and murders people 
that he has labeled as enemies of the 
American people, a colleague in Con-
gress, and the President of the United 
States. 
But it is just an anime video, so it is 
not a big deal, right? 
Actually, it is a big deal. And here is 
why: People listen to PAUL GOSAR. He 
is an elected official; and that gives 
him credibility, whether justified or 
not. So while there are indeed 5,000 
minutes of content uploaded every sin-
gle minute of every single day, Mr. 
GOSAR’s video got real attention, just 
as he intended. 
American citizens stopped what they 
were doing to watch something that a 
Member of the U.S. Congress had fash-
ioned. He posted it on his official Con-
gressional social media, where he has 
hundreds of thousands of followers, and 
where the video was viewed over 3 mil-
lion times. 
And what he posted was violence; 
fantasized violence. A wish made in a 
very specific way. 
As I said, in any other decade, or any 
other Congress, this public endorse-
ment of violence by a Member of Con-
gress might have been excused as a 
lapse in judgment, or even possibly a 
bad joke. 
But this Congress knows what hap-
pens when members of the radical right 
get stirred up by their leaders. 
Just a few months ago, this Congress 
had to hide in safe rooms under the 
protection of police and soldiers, or 
barricade ourselves in our offices be-
cause our place of work was over-
whelmed by armed citizens who wanted 
to hang some of us.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6330 
November 17, 2021 
This 
Congress 
has 
seen 
threats 
against Members of Congress more 
than double, forcing Members to pay 
for additional security for their homes, 
offices, and families; rethink how to 
engage with constituents; and even 
wear bulletproof vests to public events. 
So when a Member of this Congress 
fantasizes in public about beheading 
another Member of Congress, it is not 
fantasy to think that there are Ameri-
cans out there who will take such a 
video as a call to action. 
A recent poll reported that 85 percent 
of Americans get their news from 
Facebook, while only 13 percent of 
Americans get their news from print. 
Are we really to believe that during 
this moment in time, that among that 
85 percent, there are no Americans who 
will see this video and indulge in fan-
tasies of their own? 
Every single day Members of this 
body receive death threats. I have got-
ten them. We all have. Our staffs and 
families have to deal with abusive and 
violent phone calls, emails, letters, and 
social media posts. And these threats 
are particularly numerous and violent 
for Members who are women of color. 
So every day we have to deal with 
the threat that somewhere out there is 
a radicalized American who has been 
taught to hate us, to regard us as evil, 
to fantasize, and even mobilize using 
that same social media, to eliminate 
us, taught by conspiracy theorists and 
far-right extremists; or by a fellow 
Member of Congress. 
That is not imagination; that is fact. 
In any other context, and especially 
in any other workplace, someone post-
ing a video of himself killing a co-
worker would not be acceptable, and an 
employee who did that would almost 
certainly be fired. 
In any other context, and especially 
in a school, a student using school re-
sources to post a video of himself be-
heading a classmate and attacking a 
school official would not be acceptable, 
and that student would face discipli-
nary charges, if not criminal charges, 
and would likely be referred for a men-
tal health evaluation. 
But for the privileges traditionally 
afforded to Members of Congress, in 
any other context, someone posting a 
video of himself killing a Member of 
Congress and attacking the President 
of the United States would almost cer-
tainly be reported to the Secret Serv-
ice and U.S. Capitol Police. 
We must condemn this celebration of 
political violence because, in addition 
to upholding the honor and integrity of 
the U.S. Congress, every Member of 
this body deserves to come to work and 
feel safe. That is true for any worker in 
any part of this country. 
It is unacceptable that our colleague 
would have to sit across from someone 
who has threatened her life in such a 
vivid way, and it is unacceptable for 
this 
body 
to 
let 
that 
action 
go 
unpunished. 
This is the House of Representatives 
of the United States Congress. We are 
all elected to be the leaders of this 
great country, and with that role 
comes immense responsibilities. People 
look up to us, they take our lead. 
So when a Member posts a video of 
himself killing his colleague, that is 
obviously going to have an impact on 
the way people approach their politics. 
So we cannot dismiss Representative 
GOSAR’s violent fantasies as a joke be-
cause, in this decade, in this America, 
someone is going to take him seri-
ously. He is a public figure and, as we 
vividly saw on January 6, the words 
and actions of public figures can read-
ily act as a spark to the tinder of rad-
ical extremism. And God help us all 
when that happens. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I thank the gentlewoman from Penn-
sylvania (Ms. SCANLON), my friend, for 
yielding me the customary 30 minutes. 
Madam Speaker, today’s rule covers 
one item, a resolution censuring Rep-
resentative PAUL GOSAR for a video 
posted on his official Twitter account 
last week, and removing him from his 
seat on the Committees on Oversight 
and Reform and Natural Resources. 
Madam Speaker, today’s action, once 
again, tramples on the traditional 
norms of the House; the idea that the 
majority and the minority have the 
right to appoint their own members to 
committees as they see fit. It sets a 
dangerous and disturbing precedent 
that will likely change the character of 
the House in the years to come, and 
not for the better. 
And the majority is doing so solely 
to play politics with this moment and 
to score a cheap political point at the 
expense of a Member of the minority. 
But before I go into all of that, I do 
think it is important to lay out the se-
quence of events that occurred here, 
since I believe they are instructive. 
Last week, Representative GOSAR 
posted a video on his official Twitter 
account. This video was certainly pro-
vocative and, in my opinion, inappro-
priate. 
Upon being informed of the video’s 
existence, Leader MCCARTHY
imme-
diately took action and called Con-
gressman GOSAR, conveying the mes-
sage that this video was inappropriate. 
After that conversation, Congressman 
GOSAR took the video down and issued 
a statement explaining and clarifying 
its meaning, and stating that he cer-
tainly 
didn’t 
approve 
of 
violence 
against any person. 
Yesterday, Congressman GOSAR took 
the additional step of appearing before 
the Republican Conference to further 
explain his actions. He described that 
his intention was for a depiction in the 
video to be symbolic of the policies he 
opposes, not actual people. He clarified 
that he did not intend it to be an en-
dorsement of violence and, further, 
that he does not condone violence. 
But not content with his admission 
to a lapse in judgment, last night the 
majority made the decision to convene 
the Rules Committee on short notice 
to consider a resolution censuring Rep-
resentative GOSAR and removing him 
from his committee assignments. In 
doing so, the majority is acting in 
clear contrast to the existing precedent 
throughout the history of this institu-
tion; a precedent the majority has 
taken multiple deliberate steps to 
weaken in this Congress. 
Throughout the history of the House 
of Representatives, the majority and 
the minority have respected the right 
of each of their conferences to assign 
their respective members to commit-
tees. The decision about whether to 
seat a member on a committee, or to 
remove a member from a committee, 
traditionally rests with the respective 
conferences. 
Early this year, the majority took 
two actions to go against that tradi-
tion. First, the majority voted to re-
move a Republican Member of Congress 
from her committee assignments. 
Second, the Speaker unilaterally re-
fused to appoint two of Leader MCCAR-
THY’s choices to be Republican mem-
bers on the Select Committee on the 
January 6 attack and, instead, ap-
pointed Republicans she wanted on the 
committee. Both of these actions are in 
stark contrast to the norms and tradi-
tions of the House of Representatives. 
Today, the majority is taking a third 
such action. This continues to set an 
extremely dangerous precedent for the 
future of the institution. In future 
years, the precedent may be used to 
give the majority veto power over the 
minority’s 
committee 
assignments. 
That is a slippery slope for the institu-
tion to go down. 
But to make matters worse, in acting 
today, the majority is setting a stand-
ard for Members of the minority that it 
does not set for itself. There have been 
plenty of instances of Members on the 
majority side using intemperate lan-
guage, making statements that di-
rectly or could be construed as endors-
ing violence or taking controversial or 
inappropriate actions; yet, the major-
ity has yet to act to remove one of its 
own members from their committee as-
signments. 
This is a classic case of the old adage: 
‘‘Rules for thee but not for me.’’ That 
is deeply frustrating. 
Madam Speaker, if action is truly 
necessary today, then there are two 
other options for addressing Represent-
ative GOSAR’s actions than what the 
majority is proposing. First, the major-
ity can and should leave the matter up 
to Leader MCCARTHY and the Repub-
lican Conference. Indeed, this was the 
topic of discussion at yesterday’s Re-
publican Conference meeting and, his-
torically, neither Leader MCCARTHY 
nor the Republican Conference has 
shied away from disciplining Members. 
Second, the House also has the op-
tion of referring Representative GOSAR 
to the Ethics Committee. This is also 
an appropriate course of action, par-
ticularly if the majority believes that

November 17, 2021 
a violation of the Code of Ethics has 
occurred. Such a referral would give 
the bipartisan Ethics Committee the 
time to review the matter, allow Rep-
resentative GOSAR to present his argu-
ments, and give the committee the 
chance 
to 
make 
appropriate 
rec-
ommendations. 
But once again, the majority is rush-
ing forward with a resolution to strip a 
Republican member of a committee as-
signment without giving either of 
these two appropriate venues a chance 
to resolve the matter. In doing so, they 
are playing politics in the worst way, 
rushing to condemn a Republican Mem-
ber for actions for which he has already 
sought to address. 
It is disturbing to note the surprise 
on my Democratic colleagues’ faces 
last night at the Rules Committee 
when I referenced the public statement 
Congressman GOSAR released after re-
moving the video. They didn’t seem to 
know about it. I think they are con-
demning his actions and didn’t even 
know that he had already taken correc-
tive action. 
That goes to show, frankly, that we 
have not taken the appropriate care in 
looking at this matter, and certainly 
not given Representative GOSAR
the 
opportunity to address it. 
Madam Speaker, I urge opposition to 
the rule, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I would have to agree with my 
learned colleague that these are un-
usual actions, but these are also un-
usual times. Every time we have seen a 
new low in conduct from our colleagues 
across the aisle, we get crickets or ex-
cuses from the Republican Party. In-
deed, it took 9 days before the minority 
leader publicly spoke about this threat; 
and his silence spoke volumes, both to 
the American people and those who 
were paying attention to Mr. GOSAR’s 
post. 
Instead, we have heard multiple re-
ports that our colleagues are consid-
ering punishing their colleagues who 
voted for the bipartisan infrastructure 
package. I think that speaks volumes 
about where their priorities lie. 
We will continue to see Members 
emboldened by the lack of account-
ability engaging in evermore out-
rageous conduct, placing both the in-
tegrity of Congress and the safety of 
its Members at risk. 
While Mr. GOSAR
has since taken 
down his post, he has not apologized. In 
fact, he said publicly on TV that he 
does not apologize. He has doubled 
down on his decision to post the video 
saying, the cartoon exposes the threats 
to America. It doesn’t make a threat to 
anyone. 
I would have to disagree with his as-
sessment. 
As to the claim that there hasn’t 
been enough of a process, that this 
should have gone to the Ethics Com-
mittee; I will remind my colleagues 
that we heard in the Rules Committee 
last night that the majority requested 
an emergency meeting of the Ethics 
Committee, which the minority denied. 
And this isn’t a case where there are 
facts to discover. The actions of Rep-
resentative GOSAR were not hidden for 
an investigatory body to discover. His 
misconduct was paid for and produced 
with public resources and posted on an 
official public Twitter account, where 
it got more than 3 million views before 
it was taken down. 
There is no dispute about whether 
Representative GOSAR posted the rep-
rehensible video depicting the murder 
of one of his colleagues on his official 
channels. And the Republican Con-
ference has had 2 weeks to decide to 
take action and hold him accountable. 
Instead, they are debating whether to 
punish their colleagues for voting for 
infrastructure for the American people. 
So we have said that—it actually just 
strikes me as odd that our colleagues 
would argue that this forms a harmful 
precedent, and that the threat of vio-
lence or murder in the future might be 
cause to censure and strip members of 
their committees. If that is the case, 
then sign me up because I do think 
that is reprehensible and deserves cen-
sure. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. 
CAROLYN
B. MALONEY), the distin-
guished chairwoman of the Committee 
on Oversight and Reform. 
b 1245 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I rise in support 
of the rule and in support of the under-
lying resolution, H. Res. 789. This is an 
extraordinary measure, and I do not 
support it lightly. 
As chair of the Committee on Over-
sight and Reform, I support and defend 
the rights of all committee members to 
express their views, even if I disagree 
with them. But the honest exchange of 
ideas cannot happen when one com-
mittee 
member 
promotes 
violence 
against another. 
No 
other 
workplace 
in 
America 
would tolerate such dangerous conduct, 
and neither should the House of Rep-
resentatives. 
What Representative GOSAR
did is 
both despicable and beneath the office 
he holds. But make no mistake about 
it: Promoting political violence has 
real consequences. 
Many of our colleagues, including 
myself, and the Capitol Police have re-
ceived credible death threats. 
Rejecting violence should not be a 
partisan issue. I call on my Republican 
colleagues to join us today in demand-
ing accountability for those who pro-
mote it. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume 
simply to make a couple of quick 
points to some of my friends’ concerns. 
First of all, nobody has had 2 weeks 
to act. This incident occurred less than 
2 weeks ago, and we were in recess last 
week. So let’s focus on the here and 
now. 
I may be mistaken about this, but I 
don’t think we have kept the Ethics 
Committee from meeting about this. 
Quite the opposite, we wish they had. 
The chairman did say he would put in 
a request for an emergency meeting. 
The reality is, the majority moved 
ahead, I think, before that could hap-
pen. That process, I think, would have 
been the appropriate one to follow or 
an appropriate one to follow in this 
case. 
So, I just simply posit those things 
for the record. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Florida 
(Mr. 
GAETZ). 
Mr. GAETZ. Madam Speaker, I op-
pose political violence in all forms, re-
gardless of the politics of the target. 
I am no expert on Japanese anime, 
but I am told, and I do believe, that it 
is not real. What is real is the crisis on 
our border, the inflation crushing 
American families, unvetted Afghans 
in our country. What is definitely real 
is the violence that burned our cities 
and harmed our businesses in the sum-
mer of 2020, often encouraged by Demo-
crats in Congress. 
Anime is fiction to the point of the 
absurd. It is not really my thing, and it 
does glorify violence, but often to sym-
bolize conflict, not realistic harm to 
another person. 
In the last session week we had, we 
reviewed 
Steve 
Bannon’s 
podcast. 
Today, we are critiquing PAUL GOSAR’s 
anime. Next week, we might be indict-
ing Wile E. Coyote for an explosive ord-
nance against Road Runner. 
If you don’t like PAUL
GOSAR’s 
tweets, tweet back at him. We know 
there are plenty of folks in Big Tech 
who will amplify your message. 
The gentlewoman from Pennsylvania 
gave the game away. This really isn’t 
about a tweet. It is about removing a 
powerful conservative, PAUL
GOSAR, 
from the Committee on Oversight and 
Reform. It is about characterizing con-
servatives as threats to the country, 
dangerous, because despite the major-
ity’s references to the Biden infrastruc-
ture bill, they have received no bump 
from it. The American people are not 
really into the infrastructure bill, and 
so we are here reviewing mean tweets. 
All of us in Congress—I shouldn’t say 
all of us. Some of us have regretted 
things we have tweeted. I know I have. 
When we say uncouth things, we should 
resolve that. Congressman GOSAR re-
moved the tweet, and I hope he regrets 
it. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
an additional 30 seconds to the gen-
tleman from Florida. 
Mr. GAETZ. Madam Speaker, I would 
say I have regretted things I have 
tweeted. 
I 
hope 
that 
people 
who 
tweeted in support of violence in the 
summer of 2020 regret those tweets. I 
am not sure if they do or not.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6332 
November 17, 2021 
I would just suggest we have better 
things to do on the floor of the House 
of Representatives than be the hall 
monitors for Twitter. 
If we got a thousand Americans, in 
almost any district in America, and 
asked what was troubling them, I don’t 
know that we would find two in any 
district that would put PAUL GOSAR on 
the list of things that matter to them 
more than the issues that they face at 
their kitchen table. 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. RASKIN), a distinguished 
member of the Rules Committee. 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, is 
there a high school or a workplace in 
America that would do nothing if a 
student or a worker posted violently 
threatening material against a fellow 
student or a colleague? Please show it 
to me, if so. 
Last month, a high school student in 
Michigan made threatening statements 
about a specific classmate. He was ar-
rested. 
In Boulder, Colorado, several high 
school students were expelled for post-
ing violently threatening material on-
line. 
Last month, in Chicago, a firefighter 
was fired for his threatening social 
media posts, including a cartoon of 
someone running someone else over in 
a car. 
A woman in Pennsylvania who made 
violent threats against a colleague on 
Facebook was fired, and the State 
court found she was ineligible for un-
employment compensation because her 
violently threatening speech online 
constituted willful misconduct. 
It is remarkable to me, Madam 
Speaker, that we have colleagues who 
think we should do nothing in the face 
of a Member of the United States 
House of Representatives who posts an 
animated cartoon video of him killing 
a colleague. 
Congressman GOSAR is 62. Congress-
woman ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ is 
32. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, if we defeat the pre-
vious question, I will offer an amend-
ment to the rule to consider a resolu-
tion that would add a new House rule 
stating that any resolution proposing 
to remove a Member from a committee 
assignment shall not be in order unless 
offered by, or with the concurrence of, 
the leader of the party of the Member 
that is the subject of the resolution. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
my 
amendment 
would reinforce the longstanding norm 
of basic fairness that today’s resolu-
tion does not comply with. Throughout 
the entire history of the House of Rep-
resentatives, it has been an unwritten 
rule, or norm of conduct, that one 
party does not attempt to exercise a 
veto over the other party’s committee 
assignments. The reasons for this are 
obvious. It protects the operations of 
the institution and ensures that politi-
cally motivated attempts to remove 
Members from committees do not hap-
pen. 
But the majority’s actions, both 
today and earlier this Congress, threat-
en that norm and threaten to set off a 
new round of escalating partisan pun-
ishment anytime the majority changes 
hands. Establishing this as a written 
rule of the House would ensure that no 
Member ever faces this kind of partisan 
retribution again. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to include in the RECORD the 
text of my amendment, along with the 
extraneous 
material, 
immediately 
prior to the vote on the previous ques-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, like 
the 
distinguished 
gentleman 
from 
Oklahoma, I, too, long for the times 
when the norms of civilized conduct in 
this House were observed. When, per-
haps, our colleagues across the aisle 
can return to those norms, then mo-
tions and resolutions like the one we 
are considering today will not be nec-
essary. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PAYNE). 
Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to condemn the actions of Rep-
resentative PAUL GOSAR of Arizona and 
support this resolution. 
There have been many times when I 
have stood on this floor and disagreed 
with my Republican colleagues. At 
times, I have done so with passion. But 
I have never supported or promoted vi-
olence against any of them. The vast 
majority of my colleagues, Republican 
and Democrat, have shown that they 
feel the same way. 
We know that there is a line that 
cannot be crossed when it comes to 
how we refer to our political rivals, and 
Representative GOSAR has crossed that 
line. He crossed it when he created a 
video that depicts attacking President 
Joe Biden and killing Representative 
ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ. 
This behavior is unacceptable from 
any Member of Congress. It would not 
be tolerated in any workplace in the 
country, and it should not be tolerated 
here. 
That is why we must censure Rep-
resentative GOSAR
and remove him 
from his committees. We must show 
the country that inappropriate actions, 
like his video, have consequences. We 
must remind all Members that there is 
a certain decorum to how we treat each 
other that must be respected at all 
times. We must show the country that 
we can debate as Democrats and Re-
publicans but still respect each other 
as Americans. 
Madam Speaker, I heard the gen-
tleman from Florida mention Wile E. 
Coyote and the Road Runner. Yes, it is 
true that they are cartoons, but nei-
ther one of them can pick up a gun. 
Congressman GOSAR can. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
this is a very troubling moment in our 
history. 
After the rule is passed, you will see 
other Members come to the floor to 
continue this debate. 
I thought I would start out by hold-
ing up a most precious document, and 
that is the Constitution of the United 
States of America. I often get chills 
when I read its Preamble, which indi-
cates that the body of people who 
started this Nation organized to create 
a more perfect Union. 
I love to hear those words because 
what it suggests is that we wanted to 
be the standard-bearer for what is best 
and better in the world. We wanted to 
cease conflict. We wanted to be the de-
fenders of peace. And even with the 
original sin, we wanted somehow to be 
better than others. 
I get chills when I walk through the 
Halls of this very august place, to see 
the depictions of the debates in the 
early years, to realize how fragile de-
mocracy is, and how we could not last. 
I hold this up because, interestingly, 
we can be so proud that Congress was 
listed as the first body of government, 
Article I. 
As I read the charges in here, it gives 
us powers as the House of Representa-
tives. Nowhere is there a privilege to 
kill. Nowhere is there the instruction 
to kill. Nowhere is there an instruction 
to be free to murder. Yet, with a great 
deal of trepidation and sadness, I am 
here because of a video. 
This headline speaks to it: ‘‘House to 
vote on censuring Republican,’’ Mr. 
GOSAR, ‘‘who shared violent video tar-
geting’’ a Member of Congress. 
That is the crux of why we are here. 
It is not speech of people supporting 
the right to be free in this Nation and 
supporting 
the 
George 
Floyd 
bill, 
where protesters, peaceful and other-
wise, did rise up, young people, about 
66,000 in Houston, completely peaceful, 
as it was around the Nation. 
Don’t try to compare the pain of pro-
testers on an issue of justice with the 
actions of this gentleman. Yes, I call 
him that. 
Mr. GOSAR is seen delivering a fatal 
blow to the back of the monster’s head, 
and blood is seen gushing from the 
wound. The face is that of our col-
league, and it is violent. 
In addition, it is treasonous to be 
seen to attack the President of the 
United States of America. 
In one scene, footage of migrants 
crossing the Rio Grande is overlaid 
with what appears to be splattered 
blood. 
Who are we as a Nation? 
In 
another, 
the 
words 
‘‘drugs,’’ 
‘‘crime,’’ ‘‘poverty,’’ ‘‘money,’’ ‘‘mur-
der,’’ ‘‘gangs,’’ ‘‘violence,’’ and ‘‘traf-
ficking’’ flash across the screen. Mr. 
GOSAR knew what he was doing.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6333 
November 17, 2021 
The 1 minute and 32 seconds was 
posted by him. It shows him battling a 
towering, naked monstrosity with the 
face of that Democratic Member. It is 
against women of color; it is against 
women; and it is against Members of 
Congress. 
Last week, TED LIEU and I, and 30 
other Members, sent a letter to Repub-
lican leadership asking if there was one 
person that would call this out and in-
dicate shame, shame, shame. 
I include in the RECORD the letter 
that was sent to Republican leadership. 
CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES, 
Washington, DC, November 12, 2021. 
Hon. KEVIN MCCARTHY, 
Republican Leader, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR REPUBLICAN LEADER MCCARTHY: We 
write as members of the United States House 
of Representatives to express our extreme 
concern, indignation, and fear regarding the 
recent actions of Representative Paul Gosar 
and to ask that you publicly request a House 
Ethics Committee investigation into Mr. 
Gosar’s actions. 
On November 7, 2021, Mr. Gosar shared a 
grotesque video on Twitter in which his face 
and those of several other Republican Mem-
bers of the House are edited into the opening 
credits of the Netflix anime series Attack on 
Titan, and in which Mr. Gosar is depicted 
killing a giant monster with the face of a 
Democratic Member of Congress. 
The one minute and thirty-two-seconds 
video depicts Mr. Gosar battling a towering, 
naked monstrosity with the face of a Demo-
cratic Member of the House superimposed 
over the monster’s face. Mr. Gosar is then 
seen delivering a fatal strike to the back of 
the monster’s neck, and blood is seen gush-
ing from the wound. The video also depicts 
Mr. Gosar leaping at President Biden while 
brandishing two swords, and the video is 
interspersed throughout with real-life foot-
age of Border Patrol officers rounding up mi-
grants at the U.S.-Mexico border. In one 
scene, footage of migrants crossing the Rio 
Grande is overlaid with what appears to be 
splattered blood. In another, the words 
‘‘drugs,’’ 
‘‘crime,’’ 
‘‘poverty,’’ 
‘‘money,’’ 
‘‘murder,’’ ‘‘gangs,’’ ‘‘violence’’ and ‘‘traf-
ficking’’ flash across the screen. 
Sharing the glorification of violence ex-
pressed in this video goes far beyond the pro-
tections afforded by the Speech and Debate 
Clause in the Constitution and is beneath 
the dignity of a person serving in the Con-
gress of the United States. Mr. Gosar’s ac-
tions display a breakdown of reasoned dis-
course not seen in the House since the sum-
mer of 1856, when South Carolina Congress-
man Preston Brooks attacked Massachusetts 
Senator Charles Sumner with a cane on the 
Senate floor. The beating nearly killed Sum-
ner and contributed significantly to the 
country’s polarization over the issue of slav-
ery and to the use of violence that eventu-
ally led to the Civil War. 
In a like manner, Mr. Gosar’s actions serve 
solely to glorify the usage of violence 
against Members of the House. As we wit-
nessed with Mr. Gosar’s actions leading up to 
January 6, threats of violence and the glori-
fication of violence lead to actual violence. 
Mr. Gosar has continuously been a strong 
proponent of the Big Lie that President 
Biden lost the 2020 Presidential election. As 
reported by several media outlets, Mr. Gosar 
was intimately involved with the planning of 
the January 6 rally and, following the Janu-
ary 6 attack, Mr. Gosar called the insurrec-
tionists ‘‘peaceful patriots.’’ Rather than 
condemn calls for violence against Congress 
and actual violence against Congress, Mr. 
Gosar has instead shared an animated video 
of himself killing a fellow Member of Con-
gress. 
Less than one year has passed since Con-
gress witnessed the January 6 domestic ter-
rorists break into the Capitol building, van-
dalize and steal property, threaten our safe-
ty and lives, and attack and kill Capitol po-
lice officers. Less than one year has passed 
since we witnessed crowds chanting ‘‘Hang 
Mike Pence,’’ and ‘‘Hang Nancy Pelosi’’ out-
side this bastion of democracy. If ever there 
was a time for the House to come together to 
promote civility, discourse, and cooperation, 
it is now. 
For these reasons, we are asking that as 
the Leader of the Republican Conference you 
publicly request an investigation into Mr. 
Gosar’s actions by the House Ethics Com-
mittee to determine whether Mr. Gosar has 
violated the Rules of the House to a degree 
sufficient to warrant disciplinary action, in-
cluding ordering the cessation of conduct 
that threatens the lives of fellow Members of 
Congress and the President, removal from 
his Committee positions, censure, expulsion, 
or further disciplinary action as determined 
by the Committee or the House of Represent-
atives. 
We must act to protect the dignity and in-
tegrity of the House. 
Very truly yours,

Ms. JACKSON LEE. This brings me 
to tears. There is no celebration on 
this floor. It is imperative that we pass 
this resolution and Mr. GOSAR is cen-
sured and removed from his seat. The 
reason is you cannot depict the murder 
of another Member of Congress or the 
President of the United States. 
Madam Speaker, I stand here today as a 
senior member of the Committees on the Judi-
ciary, on Homeland Security, and on the 
Budget, to support this Rule governing debate 
of H. Res. 789 to censure Rep. GOSAR and to 
remove him from his committee assignment. 
I also stand here, Madam Speaker, to ex-
press my concern, indignation, and fear re-
garding Representative GOSAR’s actions. 
On November 7, 2021, Mr. GOSAR shared a 
grotesque video on Twitter in which his face 
and those of several other Republican Mem-
bers are edited into an anime segment, and in 
which Mr. GOSAR is depicted killing a giant 
monster with the face of a Democratic Mem-
ber of Congress. 
Mr. GOSAR is then seen delivering a fatal 
strike to the back of the monster’s neck, and 
blood is seen gushing from the wound. 
The video also depicts Mr. GOSAR leaping at 
President Biden while brandishing two swords, 
and the video is interspersed throughout with 
real-life footage of Border Patrol officers 
rounding up migrants at the U.S.-Mexico bor-
der. 
In one scene, footage of migrants crossing 
the Rio Grande is overlaid with what appears 
to be splattered blood. 
In another the words ‘‘drugs’’ ‘‘crime’’ ‘‘pov-
erty’’ ‘‘money’’ ‘‘murder’’ ‘‘gangs,’’ ‘‘violence’’ 
and ‘‘trafficking’’ flash across the screen. 
The one minute and thirty-two second video 
depicts Mr. GOSAR battling a towering, naked 
monstrosity with the face of a Democratic 
Member of the House superimposed over the 
monster’s face. 
This was a one minute and thirty-two sec-
ond speech threatening violence against a 
member of the House. 
Last week, my colleague TED LIEU and I, 
along with thirty other members of the House, 
sent a letter to Minority Leader MCCARTHY 
asking him to request an Ethics investigation 
into Mr. GOSAR’s actions. 
Rather than standing for the dignity of the 
House, Minority Leader MCCARTHY has done 
nothing. 
I would like to submit into the record the No-
vember 12, 2021 letter sent to Minority Leader 
MCCARTHY by myself, TED LIEU, and thirty 
other members of Congress. 
Sharing the glorification of violence ex-
pressed in this video goes far beyond the pro-
tections afforded by the Speech and Debate 
Clause in the Constitution and is beneath the 
dignity of a person serving in the Congress of 
the United States. 
Mr. GOSAR’s actions display a breakdown of 
reasoned discourse not seen in the House 
since the summer of 1856, when South Caro-
lina Congressman Preston Brooks attacked 
Massachusetts Senator Charles Sumner with 
a cane on the Senate floor. 
The beating nearly killed Sumner and con-
tributed significantly to the country’s polariza-
tion over the issue of slavery and to the use 
of violence that eventually led to the Civil War. 
In a like manner, Mr. GOSAR’s actions serve 
solely to glorify the usage of violence against 
Members of the House. 
As we witnessed with Mr. GOSAR’s actions 
leading up to January 6, threats of violence 
and the glorification of violence lead to actual 
violence. 
Mr. GOSAR has continuously been a strong 
proponent of the Big Lie that President Biden 
lost the 2020 Presidential election. 
As reported by several media outlets, Mr. 
GOSAR was intimately involved with the plan-
ning of the January 6 rally and, following the 
January 6 attack, Mr. GOSAR called the insur-
rectionists ‘‘peaceful patriots.’’ 
Rather than condemn calls for violence 
against Congress and actual violence against 
Congress, Mr. GOSAR has instead shared an 
animated video of himself killing a fellow Mem-
ber of Congress. 
Rather than uphold the dignity and sanctity 
of the House, Republican Leader MCCARTHY 
has done nothing 
Less than one year has passed since Con-
gress witnessed the January 6 domestic ter-
rorists break into the Capitol building, van-
dalize and steal property, threaten our safety 
and lives, and attack and kill Capitol police of-
ficers. 
Less than one year has passed since we 
witnessed 
crowds 
chanting 
‘‘Hang 
Mike 
Pence’’ and ‘‘Hang Nancy Pelosi’’ outside this 
bastion of democracy. If ever there was a time 
for the House to come together to promote ci-
vility, discourse, and cooperation, it is now. 
For these reasons, I urge all members to 
vote in favor of this Rule governing debate.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6334 
November 17, 2021 
We must act to protect the dignity and integ-
rity of the House. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from 
Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN), the 
distinguished chairman of the Rules 
Committee. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
want to thank the gentlewoman from 
Pennsylvania for yielding me the time 
and for her distinguished service on the 
Rules Committee. 
Madam Speaker, the standard we 
have set is simple. When a Member 
uses taxpayer money to produce a 
video encouraging violence against an-
other Member, they should lose the 
privilege of serving on a committee. 
That is what serving on a congres-
sional committee is. It is a privilege. It 
is not a right. 
I don’t know what Congressman 
GOSAR has said in the privacy of Re-
publican Conference meetings. I am 
not getting any invitations to those. 
Frankly, Madam Speaker, I don’t real-
ly care because it is what he said pub-
licly that counts, and publicly he has 
defended his actions. 
Can we just be honest here, Madam 
Speaker? For once, can my colleagues 
on the other side stand up to their 
leadership and say in public what they 
know to be true? 
After our colleague Gabby Giffords 
was shot, after the distinguished mi-
nority whip was shot, after what hap-
pened on January 6, after a record- 
breaking increase in threats against 
Members, will none of my colleagues 
on the other side admit that Congress-
man GOSAR should be held account-
able? 
And for all the talk from those on 
the other side about this standard 
somehow being a slippery slope, let me 
remind them that it is their own col-
leagues who have suggested removing 
Republicans not for advocating vio-
lence, but for voting for the bipartisan 
infrastructure bill. 
Is this the state of the Republican 
Party today? If you vote for a bipar-
tisan bill, your own colleagues will call 
for retribution, but if you tweet a video 
depicting the murder of a colleague 
and depicting violence against the 
President of the United States, that is 
somehow okay? Come on. 
His office produced this video, and 
Congressman GOSAR
defended it. We 
have people out there being influenced 
by garbage like this. We have Members 
being forced to pay for security. We 
have Members getting death threats. 
This is dangerous stuff that we are 
talking about here. 
But last night in the Rules Com-
mittee we heard a lot of rationaliza-
tion. We heard explanation. We heard 
whataboutism. Give me a break. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
the 
dangerous 
standard, the real slippery slope would 
be for this Congress to do nothing here, 
to be satisfied with a stern, private 
phone call from the Republican leader-
ship and no accountability. 
We cannot allow the normalization of 
political violence in America. Some-
thing is very, very wrong with that. 
And something is very, very wrong 
with anyone who thought posting this 
video was okay. 
Now, the minority leader had a 
‘‘stern, private call’’ with Congressman 
GOSAR. 
Guess 
what? 
That 
is 
not 
enough. There must be real con-
sequences. 
Censure and removing Congressman 
GOSAR
from his committee assign-
ments is appropriate here. This isn’t 
about partisanship or anyone’s voting 
record. This is about accountability, 
and at some point, we need to come to-
gether to uphold the integrity and the 
decency of this institution. 
To be honest, Madam Speaker, unfor-
tunately, I am not hearing a hell of a 
lot of willingness from many on the 
other side to do that. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I am 
prepared to close if the gentleman is 
prepared to close. I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time to close. 
Obviously, I oppose the rule. Today’s 
action threatens one of the key norms 
of this institution, the right of the ma-
jority and minority to make com-
mittee assignments for their respective 
Members. It threatens to set a new, 
dangerous precedent for this institu-
tion, allowing the majority to have a 
veto over the minority’s assignments. 
Representative GOSAR
has already 
addressed his misguided decision to 
post the video and has sought to rec-
tify it. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous 
question, ‘‘no’’ on the rule, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD a November 9 Insider article 
entitled: ‘‘GOP Lawmakers Want to 
Punish the 13 Republicans Who Voted 
for Biden’s Infrastructure Bill By Kick-
ing Them Off Congressional Commit-
tees, Report Says.’’ 
[From the Insider, Nov. 9, 2021] 
GOP LAWMAKERS WANT TO PUNISH THE 13 RE-
PUBLICANS WHO VOTED FOR BIDEN’S INFRA-
STRUCTURE BILL BY KICKING THEM OFF CON-
GRESSIONAL COMMITTEES, REPORT SAYS 
(By Tom Porter) 
Republican leaders in the US House of Rep-
resentatives are expecting a bid to punish 
the 13 Republicans who voted for President 
Joe Biden’s $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill by 
stripping them of committee assignments, 
according to a report. 
Punchbowl News reported that some Re-
publican lawmakers were determined to take 
action against the 13, several of whom are 
ranking members or senior Republicans on 
House committees or subcommittees. 
The report did not detail what level of sup-
port the move might have as of Tuesday 
morning. 
Under House rules, a party’s steering com-
mittee has the power to recommend that a 
lawmaker be removed from committee as-
signments, which is then subject to a vote by 
the caucus and the full House. 
It is a punishment that has historically 
been reserved for lawmakers who have been 
accused of crimes, or been involved with ex-
tremism. 
The support of the 13 Republicans was ulti-
mately vital for the infrastructure bill pass-
ing into law last week, with six Democrats 
voting against it amid a monthslong dispute 
in the party over a connected bill that is 
being stalled in the Senate. The infrastruc-
ture bill was passed by the Senate in a bipar-
tisan vote in June. 
The move to take action against the 13 Re-
publicans who supported the infrastructure 
bill highlights the fury of some GOP law-
makers against party colleagues for backing 
Biden’s legislation. 
Several hard line loyalists to former Presi-
dent Donald Trump on the far right of the 
GOP House caucus, including Reps. Marjorie 
Taylor Greene and Matt Gaetz, have been 
publicly critical of the 13 lawmakers. Trump 
himself has also criticized them. 
‘‘Here are the ‘Republicans’ that just voted 
to help Biden screw America,’’ Greene 
tweeted last week, branding them ‘‘traitors, 
and sharing pictures and phone numbers of 
them. 
In an Monday CNN interview, Rep. Fred 
Upton of Michigan—one of the 13 Repub-
licans who voted for the infrastructure bill— 
played a threatening message he’d received 
after the vote. 
‘‘I’ll tell you it’s a terrible way—we have 
seen civility really downslide here. I’m con-
cerned about my staff. They are taking these 
calls,’’ he said. 
There has long been tensions in the GOP 
between centrists and Trump loyalists. In 
May, Rep. Liz Cheney was removed from her 
leadership role in the House GOP over her 
criticism of Trump and his baseless claims of 
fraud in the 2020 election. 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, as I 
indicated, there are some in the Repub-
lican Conference who want to kick 13 
Republicans off their committees for 
voting for an infrastructure bill that 
will benefit their constituents, but 
when a Member of Congress publicly 
celebrates a video depicting the murder 
of a colleague, silence. 
It is disgraceful that Congress is the 
one place in the United States where a 
video calling for the murder of a Mem-
ber of Congress is not universally con-
demned, and it is a sad thing for this 
institution. 
Madam Speaker, we are here to ad-
dress the conduct of a Member of Con-
gress who disseminated and celebrated 
a video that portrays him murdering 
another Member of Congress and at-
tacking the President of the United 
States. 
The evidence speaks for itself. There 
is nothing more to review. Nothing to 
investigate. No questions to answer or 
facts to find. 
We have all seen the video. We have 
heard Mr. GOSAR’s response, and we 
have seen the lack of response from the 
Republican Party leadership to con-
demn Representative GOSAR’s celebra-
tion of violence to make clear that 
such actions are unacceptable, and 
that political violence is unacceptable 
in the United States of America.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6335 
November 17, 2021 
In the absence of meaningful action 
by his own party, it is up to Members 
of the House of Representatives and 
the country as a whole to decide 
whether such actions deserve con-
sequences. 
Today, we ask ourselves, is this be-
havior acceptable to you? Is it accept-
able to the American people? The way 
we vote today says a lot, not only 
about the integrity of the Members 
who are entrusted with the privilege of 
representing this great country, but 
also the direction in which we are 
headed. 
I am grateful to the few Republican 
colleagues who have the integrity and 
the guts, quite frankly, to condemn 
Mr. GOSAR’s actions. But, once again, 
Republican leadership lacks the cour-
age to properly manage the actions of 
their conference, and so Congress must 
act. 
Rejecting political violence should 
not be a partisan effort. How far has 
the party of Lincoln fallen that it 
would excuse this conduct? We must 
say that political violence is not ac-
ceptable in the United States of Amer-
ica. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support the rule and under-
lying resolution. 
The material previously referred to 
by Mr. COLE is as follows: 
Strike all after the resolving clause and in-
sert the following: 
That immediately upon adoption of this 
resolution, the House shall proceed to the 
consideration in the House of the resolution 
(H. Res. 796), amending the Rules of the 
House of Representatives to prohibit the 
consideration of a resolution proposing to re-
move a Member from a standing committee 
unless the resolution is offered by, or with 
the concurrence of, the Leader of the party 
of the Member that is the subject of the reso-
lution. The resolution shall be considered as 
read. The previous question shall be consid-
ered as ordered on the resolution to adoption 
without intervening motion or demand for 
division of the question except one hour of 
debate equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of the 
Committee on Rules. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX 
shall not apply to the consideration of House 
Resolution 796. 
H. RES. 796 
Resolved, 
SECTION 1. REMOVAL OF A MEMBER FROM A 
STANDING COMMITTEE. 
Clause 5(a)(1) of rule X of the Rules of the 
House of Representatives is amended to read 
as follows: 
‘‘(1)(A) The standing committees specified 
in clause 1 shall be elected by the House 
within seven calendar days after the com-
mencement of each Congress, from nomina-
tions submitted by the respective party cau-
cus or conference. A resolution proposing to 
change the composition of a standing com-
mittee shall be privileged if offered by direc-
tion of the party caucus or conference con-
cerned. 
‘‘(B) A resolution proposing to remove a 
Member from a standing committee shall 
not be in order unless offered by, or with the 
concurrence of, the Leader of the party of 
the Member that is the subject of the resolu-
tion. 
‘‘(C) The Committee on Rules may not re-
port a rule or order that waives the applica-
tion of subdivision (B).’’. 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time, and 
I move the previous question on the 
resolution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on ordering the previous 
question. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 221, nays

CENSURING REPRESENTATIVE 
PAUL GOSAR 
Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, pur-
suant to House Resolution 795, I call up 
the resolution (H. Res. 789) censuring 
Representative PAUL GOSAR, and ask 
for its immediate consideration. 
The Clerk read the title of the resolu-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
DEGETTE). Pursuant to House Resolu-
tion 795, the amendment printed in 
House Report 117–174 is adopted, and 
the resolution, as amended, is consid-
ered read. 
The text of the resolution, as amend-
ed, is as follows: 
H. RES. 789 
Whereas, on November 7, 2021, Representative 
Paul Gosar posted a manipulated video on his 
social media accounts depicting himself killing 
Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and 
attacking President Joseph Biden; 
Whereas the video was posted on Representa-
tive Gosar’s official Instagram account and used 
the resources of the House of Representatives to 
further violence against elected officials; 
Whereas Representative Gosar issued a state-
ment on November 9, 2021, defending the video 
as a ‘‘symbolic cartoon’’ and spreading hateful 
and false rhetoric about immigrants; 
Whereas the leadership of the Republican 
Party has failed to condemn Representative 
Gosar’s threats of violence against the President 
of the United States and a fellow Member of 
Congress; 
Whereas the Speaker of the House made clear 
that threats of violence against Members of Con-
gress and the President of the United States 
should not be tolerated and called on the Com-
mittee on Ethics of the House and law enforce-
ment to investigate the video; 
Whereas depictions of violence can foment ac-
tual violence and jeopardize the safety of elect-
ed officials, as witnessed in this chamber on 
January 6, 2021; 
Whereas violence against women in politics is 
a global phenomenon meant to silence women 
and discourage them from seeking positions of 
authority and participating in public life, with 
women of color disproportionately impacted; 
Whereas a 2016 survey by the Inter-Par-
liamentary Union found that 82 percent of 
women parliamentarians have experienced psy-
chological violence and 44 percent received 
threats of death, sexual violence, beatings, or 
abduction during their term; and 
Whereas the participation of women in poli-
tics makes our government more representative 
and just: Now, therefore, be it

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6337 
November 17, 2021 
(1) Representative Paul Gosar of Arizona be 
censured; 
(2) 
Representative 
Paul 
Gosar 
forthwith 
present himself in the well of the House of Rep-
resentatives for the pronouncement of censure; 
(3) Representative Paul Gosar be censured 
with the public reading of this resolution by the 
Speaker; and 
(4) Representative Paul Gosar be, and is here-
by, removed from the Committee on Natural Re-
sources and the Committee on Oversight and Re-
form. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The res-
olution, as amended, shall be debatable 
for 1 hour, equally divided and con-
trolled by the chair and ranking minor-
ity member of the Committee on Eth-
ics or their respective designees. 
The gentleman from Florida (Mr. 
DEUTCH) and the gentlewoman from In-
diana (Mrs. WALORSKI) each will con-
trol 30 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Florida. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and to 
include extraneous material on H. Res. 
789. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Florida? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. PELOSI). 
Ms. 
PELOSI. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for his recogni-
tion and for his distinguished service 
as the chair of the Ethics Committee. I 
call it by its official name having 
served there for 7 years myself. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today as the 
Speaker of the House of Representa-
tives, an institution that was designed 
by our Founders to be the people’s 
House, a House constantly invigorated 
by its accountability to the people 
every year. It is a place where slavery 
was abolished; a place where we have 
taken our men and women into service 
to protect freedom and democracy 
throughout the world; and a place 
where Medicare, Medicaid, Social Secu-
rity, and so many institutions meeting 
the needs of the American people were 
established. The list goes on and on 
about the distinguished nature of the 
House of Representatives. 
Maybe 12– or 13,000 people have been 
elected to this body over time—only a 
few hundred women—but all very dis-
tinguished, and great heroes of our 
country have served in this institution 
including President Abraham Lincoln. 
That was before the Chamber was the 
meeting ground. Statuary Hall is the 
place where his desk is memorialized 
to this day. 
So, Madam Speaker, when we come 
to this great institution, we under-
stand that there are 435 Members of 
Congress, but only one from each dis-
trict. Only one of us represents the 
thoughts, aspirations, dreams, fears, 
and hopes of our constituents. 
b 1415 
There is no bigger privilege for any 
one of us in the House, be it Speaker, 
whip, leader, any of the titles that our 
caucuses may bestow on us, that is as 
prestigious as saying that I speak for 
the people of my district, in my case, 
the district of San Francisco. 
So when we come here, we have a re-
sponsibility to uphold a high standard 
of integrity, decency, and respect for 
this institution. 
The Constitution charges us to be ac-
countable to the people, and we must 
represent the United States House of 
Representatives in a spirit in which 
our constituents and all Americans 
should be very proud. 
House rule XXIII provides for our 
Code of Official Conduct. This provi-
sion of our rules requires that we 
‘‘shall behave at all times in a manner 
that shall reflect creditably on the 
House.’’ 
Sadly, extremely disturbing actions 
taken last week by a Member of Con-
gress, threatening another Member, 
wildly violate this standard. These ac-
tions demand a response. 
We cannot have Members joking 
about murdering each other or threat-
ening the President of the United 
States. This is both an endangerment 
of our elected officials and an insult to 
the institution of the House of Rep-
resentatives. 
It is not just about us as Members of 
Congress. It is the danger that it rep-
resents to everyone in the country. If 
you are viewing this and thinking, 
well, when you run for Congress, you 
get threats and the rest. You don’t ex-
pect to get them from your colleagues. 
But, nonetheless, the example set in 
this House is one that is viewed across 
the country. Women across the country 
particularly feel vulnerable if insults 
of the nature that exist in this House 
are allowed to stand. I will speak about 
that in a moment. 
Again, when a Member uses his or 
her national platform to encourage vio-
lence, tragically, people listen to those 
words and they may act upon them. 
Words spoken by elected officials weigh 
a ton. People hear them very dif-
ferently. 
As the resolution that the committee 
is putting forth states: ‘‘Depictions of 
violence can foment actual violence 
and jeopardize the safety of elected of-
ficials, as witnessed in this Chamber on 
January 6, 2021.’’ 
It is inconceivable that a member of 
our community here would wish to re-
peat the violence of that dark day, that 
deadly day. 
As a woman Speaker of the House, I 
want to be clear. These threats specifi-
cally target a woman, a woman of 
color, which is part of, as the resolu-
tion states, a ‘‘global phenomenon 
meant to silence women and discourage 
them from seeking positions of author-
ity and participating in public life.’’ 
Again, this is about workplace har-
assment and violence against women. 
Yet, the Member has never apolo-
gized for his actions. ‘‘It’s a cartoon. 
Relax,’’ he said. 
Really? A cartoon? Relax? 
And he wrote to supporters: 
The hyperventilating and shrill accusa-
tions that this cartoon is dangerous are 
laughable or intentionally hyperbolic. 
‘‘I am entitled to speak to the people 
and to do so in a manner that is engag-
ing,’’ he said. 
Really? Is it engaging to depict kill-
ing a colleague or anyone? It is not 
just about Members of Congress; any-
one, threatening anyone. 
Disguising death threats against a 
Member of Congress and the President 
of the United States in an animated 
video does not make those death 
threats any less real or less serious. 
And indeed, conveying them this way 
makes them potentially more dan-
gerous by normalizing violence. 
It isn’t funny. And yes, you have a 
right to speak; and so do we have a 
right to react to what you are saying 
when you are threatening the lives of 
Members of Congress and the President 
of the United States. 
It is sad that this entire House must 
take this step because of the refusal of 
the leadership of the other party. In-
deed, it took 9 days before the minority 
leader publicly spoke out about this 
threat; and when he did, he merely 
said: 
It was not the Member’s intent to ever 
harm anyone. 
Really? 
And many other Members on the 
other side of the aisle have refused to 
strongly condemn these actions. One 
member of leadership said: ‘‘Unfortu-
nately, in this world we are in right 
now, we all get death threats, no mat-
ter what the issue is. 
Death threats from our colleagues? 
Death threats from Members of Con-
gress? We all get death threats? 
So Members think it is okay to use 
their platforms to directly encourage 
more death threats against their own 
colleagues? 
The resolution on the floor today is 
about accountability. It is about integ-
rity in this House. And it will serve as 
a reminder to this Congress and to this 
country that the House is committed 
to upholding the highest standards of 
decorum in all that we do, as is said in 
rule XXIII, ‘‘shall behave at all times 
in 
a 
manner 
that 
shall 
reflect 
creditably on the House.’’ 
In our actions, we must be mindful of 
all who make up our congressional 
community, including not only Mem-
bers, but also the committees, the com-
mittee staff, the institutional staff— 
and thank you for your service—the 
custodians of the Capitol, the Capitol 
Police, and others. 
As we proceed to make progress for 
the people, let us be guided by our love 
of this institution, respect for this in-
stitution in which we serve and, again, 
an example that we wish to show to the 
world. 
Again, a threat against anyone is 
wrong, whether you are a Member of

Congress or not. So this is just about 
the example, again, that is total viola-
tion by the action of the Member. 
Yes, indeed, Madam Speaker, it is a 
sad day for the House of Representa-
tives, but a necessary day, so that we 
can, again, behave at all times in a 
manner that shall reflect creditably on 
the House. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the distin-
guished chairman, again. I thank Con-
gresswoman JACKIE
SPEIER
for her 
leadership in bringing this legislation 
forward, this resolution forward. 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
MCCARTHY), the distinguished minority 
leader. 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, it 
is an old definition of abuse of power: 
‘‘Rules for thee, but not for me.’’ That 
is exactly what is happening here 
today. 
House Democrats are preparing, once 
again, to break another precedent of 
the United States House of Representa-
tives. 
It is an open secret that the Amer-
ican people are facing substantial chal-
lenges today. Many of these challenges 
are Washington-inflicted, of one-party 
rule, caused by the Biden administra-
tion’s incompetence and radicalism. 
Absolute chaos on the southern bor-
der; out-of-control crime; record-break-
ing gas prices and inflation; a broken 
supply chain; a historic labor shortage; 
a failing education system and, of 
course, the humiliating surrender in 
Afghanistan. 
Will this Congress be remembered as 
the Congress that addressed those seri-
ous challenges? Not a chance? 
Instead, I believe this Congress will 
go down in history as the broken Con-
gress. 
For nearly 4 years, as the House Re-
publicans have been voicing the needs 
of millions of Americans, House Demo-
crats have broken nearly every rule 
and standard in order to silence dissent 
and stack the deck for their radical, 
unpopular agenda. 
They broke the motion to recommit, 
the first time in the history of Con-
gress. They broke impeachment, not 
once, but twice. They broke in-person 
voting and replaced it with proxy vot-
ing, for the first time in history. And 
they broke the minority’s right to ap-
point members of its own choosing to 
committees. 
The Speaker is burning down the 
House on her way out the door. 
What’s worse, we got to this point on 
the basis of a double standard. Demo-
crats want to change the rules but 
refuse to apply them to their own cau-
cus. 
I listened to the Speaker talk about 
the highest standards. 
Madam Speaker, when a Democratic 
chairwoman flew to Minneapolis and 
told an angry crowd during the trial to 
‘‘stay on the streets,’’ ‘‘get more ac-
tive,’’ 
‘‘get 
more 
confrontational.’’ 
‘‘We’ve got to make sure they know we 
mean business.’’ That high standard, 
the Democrats refused to take action. 
The trial judge actually singled her 
out on her comments on an ongoing 
basis, which he said could become an 
issue on appeal. 
But this wasn’t the first time. No. 
This is three times. 
At a rally in Los Angeles, that same 
chairwoman, she told a mob: ‘‘If you 
see anyone from that Cabinet in a res-
taurant, in a department store, at a 
gasoline station, you get out and you 
create a crowd. And you push back on 
them. And you tell them that they’re 
not welcome anymore, anywhere.’’ 
She later defended that comment in 
another speech in L.A., saying—this 
same chairwoman, of the high stand-
ards— 
I did not threaten Trump constituents and 
supporters. I do that all the time, but I 
didn’t do it that time. 
This side of the aisle didn’t ask that 
chairwoman to lose her committee. We 
simply asked for an apology. 
Meanwhile, with that high standard, 
Speaker PELOSI and Leader HOYER de-
fended her. When asked about her Min-
neapolis comment, Leader HOYER de-
scribed her as ‘‘passionate—she be-
lieves in her issues.’’ She believes she 
should get in your faces. 
And Speaker PELOSI, oh, what did she 
do with that high standard? She com-
pared her comments in Minneapolis to 
Dr. King’s civil rights movement. You 
see, why would they do that? Rules for 
thee, but not for me. 
Just this month, the dossier’s prin-
cipal source was arrested by Special 
Counsel Durham for lying to the FBI. 
Think about everything that dossier 
put this country through for 2 years, 
based on fabricated evidence. The in-
fringements to due process; the spying 
on the Presidential campaign; and, of 
course, the $32 million spent by hard-
working taxpayers for a Mueller inves-
tigation. 
And yet, the Democratic chairman 
says, ‘‘I don’t regret it.’’ Why? Rules 
for thee, but not for me. 
When the Speaker of the House, on 
this very floor, engaged in personal-
ities, the floor shut down for 3 hours 
because no one wanted to take it to the 
top. Her entire caucus that believed in 
the higher standard voted to keep her 
words in the RECORD rather than strike 
them down. Why? 
Rules for thee, but not for me. 
The Speaker said: ‘‘I stand by my 
statement. I’m proud of the attention 
that’s being called to it.’’ 
Never happened before in the history 
of this body. Why? Because it is a bro-
ken Congress that believes in rules for 
thee, but not for me. 
This is part of a larger pattern. When 
a Congressman on the Intelligence 
Committee was targeted by a suspected 
Chinese Communist Party agent for 
years, the Democrats kept him on the 
committee. Why? Rules for thee, but 
not for me. 
When a Democrat Congresswoman 
said: 
‘‘Israel 
has 
hypnotized 
the 
world,’’ supporting Israel is ‘‘all about 
the Benjamins,’’ and that 9/11 was 
‘‘some people did something,’’ Demo-
crats actually defended her. Why? 
Rules for thee, but not for me. 
And when a Member of the Demo-
cratic leadership tweeted a week ago, 
‘‘Lock up Kyle Rittenhouse and throw 
away the key,’’ in an attempt to sway 
an ongoing trial, the Democrats said 
nothing. Why? Rules for thee, but not 
for me. 
Let me be clear: I do not condone vio-
lence, and Representative GOSAR has 
echoed that sentiment. The video was 
deleted. Democrats won’t listen be-
cause they will do anything to distract 
from the failures of one-party rule in 1 
year destroying a Nation. 
b 1430 
For Democrats, this vote isn’t about 
a video; it is about control. That is the 
one and only thing Democrats are in-
terested in—not condemning violence, 
not protecting the institution, not de-
corum or decency, just control. 
The Democrats want control, and 
they 
don’t 
care 
about 
the 
con-
sequences. They are destroying this in-
stitution, silencing the minority, and, 
therefore, silencing millions of Ameri-
cans. 
When I talked to Democrat leader-
ship when they told me what they 
wanted to do, I asked a simple ques-
tion: Have you seen the video? No, 
haven’t seen it. But they knew exactly 
what they wanted to do. It is inter-
esting. Without even watching, they 
decide the punishment. Why? No need. 
Rules for thee but not for me. 
What they have started cannot be 
easily undone. Their actions today and 
in the past have forever changed the 
way the House operates. It means that 
the minority rights that have served 
this body so well are a thing of the 
past. Furthermore, it means that, 
under the Pelosi precedent, all the 
Members that I mentioned earlier will 
need the approval of a majority to keep 
those positions in the future. 
What was interesting is, it is not just 
the Speaker who is making those deci-
sions. When the chairwoman incited 
those ideas three times, everyone in 
the Democratic Party had the ability 
to vote what they thought. Because of 
those high standards, they all voted to 
table. They all voted to table, not to 
remove this chairwoman from commit-
tees or ask for an apology. Why? Be-
cause you all believe in rules for thee 
but not for me. 
That legacy is a real culmination of 
Speaker PELOSI’s career. Make no mis-
take, the House is weaker, more par-
tisan, more self-focused today than 
when Speaker PELOSI became Speaker 
less than 4 years ago. Future Con-
gresses will suffer for it. More impor-
tantly, the American people have need-
lessly suffered because of it. They 
won’t soon forget it. 
It is about control. It is not about a 
standard that everybody lives by. It is 
a standard you enforce on one but not

upon yourself. You encouraged your 
own side to engage further when you 
all took a vote to table. 
It would be interesting to see, if your 
leadership hasn’t watched the video, 
how many of you who vote today have 
watched it. 
When it was requested, I contacted 
the Member. He took the video down. 
He put out a statement that he does 
not believe in violence to anyone. 
But, you see, when others on the 
other side of the aisle incite violence, 
it is okay because it is rules for thee 
but not for me. 
Unfortunately, this body has suffered 
greatly, and a new standard will con-
tinue to be applied in the future. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from New York (Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ). 
Ms. 
OCASIO-CORTEZ. 
Madam 
Speaker, I have been serving in this 
body just under 3 years. In that 3 years, 
an enormous amount has happened. 
In response to the Republican lead-
er’s remarks, when he says that this 
action is unprecedented, what I believe 
is unprecedented is for a Member of 
House leadership, of either party, to be 
unable to condemn incitement of vio-
lence against a Member of this body. 
It is a sad day when a Member who 
leads a political party in the United 
States of America cannot bring himself 
to say that issuing a depiction of mur-
dering a Member of Congress is wrong 
and instead decides to venture off into 
a tangent about gas prices and infla-
tion. 
What is so hard? What is so hard 
about saying that this is wrong? 
This is not about me. This is not 
about Representative GOSAR. But this 
is about what we are willing to accept. 
Not just the Republican leader, but I 
have seen other Members of this party 
advance the argument, including Rep-
resentative GOSAR himself, the illusion 
that this was just a joke, that what we 
say and what we do does not matter so 
long as we claim a lack of meaning. 
This nihilism runs deep, and it con-
veys and betrays a certain contempt 
for the meaning and importance of our 
work here; that what we do, so long as 
we claim that it is a joke, doesn’t mat-
ter; that what we say here doesn’t mat-
ter; that our actions, every day, as 
elected leaders in the United States of 
America don’t matter; that this Cham-
ber and what happens in it doesn’t 
matter. 
I am here to rise to say that it does. 
Our work here matters. Our example 
matters. 
There is meaning in our service. As 
leaders in this country, when we incite 
violence with depictions against our 
colleagues, that trickles down into vio-
lence in this country. 
That is where we must draw the line, 
independent of party identity or belief. 
It is about a core recognition of human 
dignity and value and worth. 
When we talk about, as mentioned in 
the resolution, that these depictions 
are part of a larger trend of misogyny 
and racist misogyny, this has results in 
dampening the participation. 
This vote is not as complex as, per-
haps, the Republican leader would like 
to make folks believe. It is pretty cut 
and dry: Does anyone in this Chamber 
find this behavior acceptable? Would 
you 
allow 
depictions 
of 
violence 
against women, against colleagues, in 
your home? Do you think this should 
happen on a school board, in a city 
council, in a church? If it is not accept-
able there, why should it be accepted 
here? 
Lastly, when the Republican leader 
rose to talk about how there are all of 
these double standards and lists a lit-
any of all of these different things, not 
once did he list an example of a Mem-
ber of Congress threatening the life of 
another. 
This is not about a double standard. 
What is unprecedented and what is 
tragic is the descent of transgression in 
this body. 
I grew up as a little girl with awe 
about our Nation’s Capitol, the rev-
erence and the importance and the 
gravity of our work here. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentlewoman from New York. 
Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. So, Madam 
Speaker, the question I pose to this 
body in response is: Will we live up to 
the promises we make our children, 
that this is a place where we will de-
fend one another, regardless of belief, 
that our core human dignity matters? 
If you believe that this behavior is 
acceptable, go ahead, vote ‘‘no.’’ But if 
you believe that this behavior should 
not be accepted, then vote ‘‘yes.’’ It is 
really that simple. 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
First, let me say I am not here to de-
fend any comments or actions made by 
Representative GOSAR or his staff. Let 
me be clear. I condemn all acts of vio-
lence. 
In fact, I am a recent victim of vio-
lence. Just a few months ago, a polit-
ical activist attempted to run me over 
with his car. When this happened, I im-
mediately contacted law enforcement. 
If a Member of Congress, anywhere, 
anytime, feels threatened, they should 
contact the police. 
Unfortunately, this posted video is 
not the first video or statement by a 
Member of Congress inciting or depict-
ing violence. Members on both sides of 
the aisle have made choices that I sure-
ly wouldn’t have made. 
But as the ranking member of the 
House Ethics Committee, I find myself 
on the floor now for the second time 
this year to address an issue that has 
been referred to the Ethics Committee 
but which has seen no committee proc-
ess before coming to the floor for a 
vote. 
Yesterday afternoon, the majority 
party 
drafted 
this 
resolution 
and 
scheduled this debate and floor vote 
today. The House Ethics Committee 
has had no time to consider this mat-
ter through the Ethics Committee 
process. 
And there is a process. The non-
partisan staff should have had the time 
to research and gather information, 
and the committee members should 
have conversations before making a de-
cision on whether and how to move for-
ward with any further investigation. 
The chairman claims to have reached 
out to schedule an emergency com-
mittee meeting last night, but the re-
ality is that he did so at a time when 
we had just been notified to appear on 
this resolution in front of the Rules 
Committee last night. 
Just for the record, the majority con-
trols when this resolution was intro-
duced, when the Rules Committee was 
scheduled, when the Ethics Committee 
meets, and when the resolution comes 
to the floor for a vote. If there is a 
scheduling conflict or an excuse as to 
why we are standing here today rush-
ing this to the floor, it is a conflict 
that was totally intended by the ma-
jority. 
So, here we are today, voting to re-
move a Representative from his com-
mittee and censure him on the House 
floor. 
Traditionally, Members are placed on 
committees by their own party, and 
they are removed from committees by 
their own party. Yet, this majority has 
broken precedent again and is remov-
ing a second Republican Member dur-
ing this Congress from their commit-
tees. 
Let me just say again: Members on 
both sides of the aisle have made 
choices that many of us would not have 
made. 
By rushing this vote to the floor 
today and ignoring the institutional 
process, the majority is setting a 
precedent again that may not serve 
this institution well in the future. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
this 
resolution, 
which was referred to the Committee 
on Ethics, seeks to censure Representa-
tive GOSAR and remove him from his 
positions on committees. 
We are acting on this resolution 
today because Representative GOSAR 
recently used House resources to dis-
seminate and celebrate a video that de-
picts the murder of a fellow colleague. 
I did see the video. I am sorry that 
the distinguished leader of the Repub-
lican side apparently chose not to or 
viewed it and deemed it something less 
than what it is, which is the horrific 
depiction of the murder of a fellow col-
league and threats to the President of 
the United States. 
We are acting on this resolution be-
cause Republican leadership has not

taken responsibility for members of its 
own Conference. 
When a fellow Member of Congress 
has been threatened with violence, the 
House cannot wait indefinitely for Re-
publican leadership to find its collec-
tive 
conscience 
and 
condemn 
the 
threat. When our colleague has been 
victimized, as women of color so often 
are, the House cannot ignore that 
threat. 
The full House must roundly reject 
Representative GOSAR’s conduct and 
prevent the normalization of violent 
imagery and rhetoric directed against 
Members of Congress. 
Just 10 months ago, this very Cham-
ber was attacked in an act of brutal, 
bloody savagery. All of us experienced 
it firsthand. Some of us were trapped 
in the upper gallery while an angry 
mob, wielding weapons, tried to beat 
down the Chamber doors to disrupt cer-
tification of President Biden’s elec-
toral college victory. 
b 1445 
Since 
January 
6, 
death 
threats 
against Members of Congress have mul-
tiplied, and several individuals have 
been arrested. The threat of actual vio-
lence against Members is real, and it is 
growing. 
So this resolution is vital to pro-
tecting our Members’ safety, but it is 
also vital to stemming the pernicious 
wave of political violence rising across 
this country, which is why Representa-
tive GOSAR’s video and his subsequent 
failure to publicly apologize or take 
full responsibility must be swiftly con-
demned. 
Any Member who uses his public 
platform to depict physical violence 
against another Member and the Presi-
dent reflects extreme discredit on this 
body. Such conduct violates the most 
basic standards of collegiality, civil 
discourse, and public decency. 
Clause 1 of our code of conduct re-
quires Members to behave ‘‘at all times 
in 
a 
manner 
that 
shall 
reflect 
creditably on the House.’’ If that rule 
is to have any meaning whatsoever, 
and if we are to fulfill our responsi-
bility to uphold the reputation of the 
House, 
Representative 
GOSAR
must 
face consequences for his conduct. 
Our Republican colleagues make hol-
low appeals to process, claiming that 
this resolution wrongly bypasses the 
Ethics Committee. But the ultimate 
power to censure a Member and remove 
that Member from a committee rests 
with this House. 
The committee can recommend such 
a sanction to the full House, but noth-
ing in our rules requires the House to 
wait, nor should the House wait in this 
instance. Not when there is a clear and 
present need to remove Representative 
GOSAR
from a committee on which 
Representative OCASIO-CORTEZ herself 
serves. 
There are no unresolved questions of 
intent. It is clear from the video, and 
from Representative GOSAR’s public 
comments minimizing it, that censure 
is appropriate and his immediate re-
moval from the Natural Resources and 
Oversight 
and 
Government 
Reform 
Committees is warranted. 
That is why the House must take this 
action today and why I urge my col-
leagues to support the resolution. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Arizona (Mr. GOSAR). 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today 
to 
address 
and 
reject 
the 
mischaracterized 
accusations 
from 
many in this body that the cartoon 
from my office is dangerous or threat-
ening. It was not, and I reject the false 
narrative categorically. 
I do not espouse violence toward any-
one. I never have. It was not my pur-
pose to make anyone upset. 
I voluntarily took the cartoon down 
not because it was itself a threat, but 
because some thought it was. Out of 
compassion for those who genuinely 
felt offense, I self-censored. 
Last week, my staff posted a video 
depicting a policy battle regarding am-
nesty for tens of millions of illegal 
aliens. This was an anime that speaks 
to young voters who are too often over-
looked. 
Even Twitter, the left’s mouthpiece, 
did not remove the cartoon, noting it 
was in the public’s interest for it to re-
main. The cartoon directly contributes 
to the understanding and the discus-
sion of the real-life battle resulting 
from this administration’s open border 
policies. 
This body is considering passage of 
Mr. Biden’s reckless, socialist/Marxist 
$4.9 trillion spending bill that provides 
$100 billion for amnesty to tens of mil-
lions of illegal aliens already in this 
country. This is what the left doesn’t 
want the American people to know. 
Our country is suffering from the 
plague of illegal immigration. I won’t 
stop pointing this out. 
Millions of illegal aliens, drugs, and 
human traffickers are being let in and 
moved around our country in the dead 
of night, all condoned by this adminis-
tration. 
For this cartoon, some in Congress 
suggest I should be punished. I have 
said decisively there is no threat in the 
cartoon other than the threat that im-
migration poses to our country, and no 
threat was intended by my staff or me. 
The American people deserve to have 
their voices heard in Congress. No mat-
ter how much the left tries to quiet 
me, I will continue to speak out 
against amnesty for illegal aliens, de-
fend the rule of law, and advance the 
America First agenda. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentleman. 
Mr. GOSAR. If I must join Alexander 
Hamilton, the first person attempted 
to be censured by this House, so be it. 
It is done. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. SPEIER), the au-
thor of this resolution. 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I take 
no pleasure in introducing this resolu-
tion. No one asked me to introduce it, 
no one tapped me on the shoulder. 
I am a victim of violence. I know 
what it is like. I also was in the gallery 
clamoring for life when the shots rang 
out in the Speaker’s lobby. 
We are here today because a sitting 
Member thought it was okay to post a 
deranged, animated video of himself 
killing a fellow Member of this House 
and also attacking the President of the 
United States. That video has been 
seen by three million people. It was up 
for over 2 days before it was taken 
down. 
Inciting violence begets violence. 
Congresswoman OCASIO-CORTEZ has be-
come the go-to subject of the radical 
right to stir up their base, as too often 
is the case for women of color. It is dis-
gusting and profoundly unacceptable. 
Tragically, the minority leader has not 
condemned the video. For 8 days, he 
said nothing. Silence speaks volumes. 
Silence normalizes violence. 
Violence against women in politics is 
a global phenomenon. A 2016 survey by 
the Inter-Parliamentary Union found 
that 82 percent of women parliamentar-
ians have experienced psychological vi-
olence, and 44 percent have received 
threats of death, rape, beatings, or ab-
duction. 
The intent of these online threats 
against women is clear: Silence them, 
strip them of their power, and discour-
age them from running for office. 
The Congressman defends his post, 
published with House resources and 
posted on his official Twitter and 
Instagram accounts. It didn’t stop 
there. He sent an email to supporters 
that weekend stating that the ‘‘faux 
outrage’’ was ‘‘infantile’’—this is not 
faux outrage. This is not infantile—and 
the 
accusations 
are 
‘‘shrill’’ 
and 
‘‘hyperventilating.’’ 
It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to 
glean that this is gendered, coded lan-
guage. The Congressman shows no re-
morse. In fact, yesterday the Congress-
man said, ‘‘I did not apologize.’’ 
Twenty-three Members of the House 
in the history of this country have 
been censured for actions including in-
sulting the Speaker or using unparlia-
mentary language. Certainly, conduct 
by a Member depicting murdering an-
other Member of the House deserves 
censure. 
Let me be clear. If a Democrat did 
the same thing, I would introduce the 
same resolution. 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Indiana (Mr. BAIRD). 
Mr. BAIRD. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise because, in light of recent events, 
I no longer feel like I can stay silent. 
The hypocrisy of this body consid-
ering the censuring and stripping of 
committee assignments of Representa-
tive GOSAR is illustrative of the inabil-
ity of this body to effectively legislate.

It demonstrates why many Ameri-
cans have lost all confidence in our 
ability to be and provide effective lead-
ership. 
I have found Mr. PAUL GOSAR to be 
an honorable and effective legislator, 
and I have found him to care deeply for 
his colleagues and America. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE). 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in strong support of this censure 
resolution. 
I watched this video, and I was 
sickened when I saw Mr. GOSAR depict-
ing the killing of another Member of 
this body and brandishing swords at 
the President of the United States. 
This kind of rhetoric is not just 
unfitting of a U.S. Representative, it is 
dangerous, and it can be deadly, as we 
saw on January 6 and in 2011 when an 
individual shot then-Congresswoman 
Gabby Giffords after Sarah Palin sent 
out a video with shooting targets on 
various congressional districts, includ-
ing Gabby’s. 
This is not a joke. This is not about 
politics. It is about safety. 
While healthy debate on the issues, 
on policy, is important, it is what 
keeps our democracy alive. This is not 
that. We cannot allow Members to en-
courage and incite violence, period. 
Mr. GOSAR, you are no Alexander 
Hamilton. You must be held account-
able. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are again reminded to address 
their remarks to the Chair. 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Arizona (Mr. BIGGS). 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, let’s 
take a look at what Democrats are ig-
noring so they can censure a conserv-
ative Republican because he posted a 
cartoon they found offensive and which 
he took down himself: 
More than two million illegal aliens 
crossing our border this calendar year; 
Attorney General Garland deploying 
Federal agents to spy on parents; 
Inflation driving gas prices up; 
Everybody’s Thanksgiving dinner is 
going up; 
A vax mandate that is clearly uncon-
stitutional; 
A bankruptcy-inducing, bureaucracy- 
bloating spending bill by Democrats; 
Supply chain in shambles; 
Democrats 
consistently 
ignoring 
calls to violence and anti-Semitic 
statements of their own; 
Foreign policy embarrassments; 
Americans 
languishing 
behind 
in 
Taliban-controlled Afghanistan; 
China, Iran, North Korea on the 
move. 
Yeah, we have been ignoring those 
things. But we are here today. 
I lived in Japan for several years. I 
speak Japanese. I read and write Japa-
nese. This is an anime. It is ‘‘Shingeki 
no Kyojin’’, highly popular, stylized, 
intended to demonstrate the alienation 
people feel, particularly young people 
in their cultures. 
Now, does anime have violence? Yes. 
It is highly stylized violence. It is not 
meant to induce people to violence. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentleman. 
Mr. BIGGS. It was not Mr. GOSAR’s 
intention, I believe, and he has made 
that clear, to induce anyone to vio-
lence. Like he, I also condemn vio-
lence, but I would ask you to recon-
sider further usurping and taking con-
trol of this body for political purposes 
because that is what is happening here 
today. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are again reminded to address 
their remarks to the Chair. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. HOYER), the House ma-
jority leader. 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I think 
all of us would wish that we were not 
here on a subject of this gravity, on a 
subject so present in our society at 
large: The exhortation to violence to 
accomplish one’s objectives. 
I have been sitting here since we 
started the debate, which was about 45 
minutes ago. So many get up and say, 
‘‘I do not support violence,’’ ‘‘I do not 
support this action,’’ but I will do 
nothing about it. 
Now, of course, they don’t say the 
last sentence. They just don’t do any-
thing. 
As I sat there as Mr. MCCARTHY was 
talking, I was thinking that he was 
getting up in my face and up in NANCY 
PELOSI’s face. I think that is what he 
was doing. I expect that in vigorous de-
bate. 
They focused on a non-analogous ac-
tion by a Member of this House, the 
chairman of the Financial Services 
Committee. Why did they do that? Be-
cause there is no analogous event to 
this one. In the 40-plus years that I 
have served here, there has never been 
a case like this. Never. 
b 1500 
This is not about control, as the ma-
jority leader would represent. It is 
about decency, democracy, and secu-
rity, and the rule of law. 
We have seen, Madam Speaker, over 
and over again in our politics that 
words matter, and actions matter even 
more. Vitriol, the glorification and 
promotion of violence, hate speech, and 
the failure to condemn all of these 
when they occur have created an at-
mosphere in our country, which sadly 
has now and too frequently been vis-
ited on this floor, that is not conducive 
to the exercise of free constitutional 
politics. 
A former leader of my party Dick 
Gephardt said that democracy was a 
substitute for war, that we should set-
tle our differences peacefully and non-
violently. 
The speech that has been the subject 
of this resolution whittles away at the 
rule of law and the civility needed for 
constructive debate. 
Indeed, violent words and images are 
too often a precursor to the practice of 
violence. We have seen that. We saw it 
on January 6 as the President of the 
United States incited and urged people 
to come to the Congress to stop democ-
racy in its tracks. 
And people wanted to hang the Vice 
President of the United States as a re-
sult of those words because he was not 
doing that because he thought it was 
not legal. He wanted to follow the law. 
My friend Gabby Giffords and Sen-
ator KELLY know that all too well, that 
violent words and images are too often 
a precursor, as does Representative 
SPEIER who worked for the late Rep-
resentative Leo Ryan and was herself 
badly injured in the shooting that took 
his life. My friend, the Republican 
whip, and his family know that words 
can encourage and result in violence. 
Last month, the family and constitu-
ents of Sir David Amess in the United 
Kingdom experienced the same pain. 
All of us who were in this Capitol on 
January 6 and those who stood in de-
fense of it know that pain. 
The loved ones of Officers Sicknick, 
Liebengood, Smith, DeFreytag, and 
Hashida carry that pain with them 
every day. 
Officer Evans’ family, as well, has 
been carrying that pain since April. 
Madam Speaker, so do the families of 
elected officials, journalists, and civil 
society leaders who have been killed or 
maimed by political violence across 
the world incited by rhetoric that is 
rationalized as acceptable in the polit-
ical environment. And then, oh, I don’t 
support violence. I don’t know how 
that happened. Yes, I said in front of 
the White House, ‘‘Go down to the Cap-
itol,’’ and although it wasn’t the exact 
words of ‘‘be violent,’’ it is what those 
who came down here expected the ex-
hortation to be. 
It would be naive, Madam Speaker, 
to suppose that we can eradicate the 
promotion of violence in wider society, 
either in our country or abroad. 
Such evil has always existed, and the 
internet and social media make it easi-
er to disseminate that malicious type 
of speech. 
But constitutional parliamentarians 
worldwide have long understood that in 
order to maintain the level of civility 
required to carry out the business of 
legislating for the people, we must 
have rules of decorum and limits on 
speech that would cause civil debate to 
devolve into uncivil attacks and polit-
ical violence. 
That is why we have rules in this 
House to enforce decorum and ensure 
civility. That is why we have rules of 
conduct, which the chairman of the 
Ethics Committee read a little earlier. 
It should be and is undebatable that 
this conduct violated that rule. 
Those rules apply not only to this 
floor but everywhere a sitting Member 
engages in work relating to his or her 
service as a Representative.

November 17, 2021 
When those rules were written, they 
did not anticipate that a Member 
would 
threaten 
violence 
directly 
against another Member. Not because 
it has never happened. A Congressman 
from South Carolina nearly beat to 
death a Senator from Massachusetts, 
Senator Sumner, because he wanted to 
abolish slavery. That, of course, was a 
crime. 
In some countries threatening public 
officials is a crime. They didn’t have to 
spell that out explicitly because it has 
always been understood that such be-
havior is unacceptable in this institu-
tion and incompatible with our service. 
Indeed, any kindergartner, frankly, 
Madam Speaker, will tell you that such 
behavior is wrong anywhere. 
The actions of Representative GOSAR 
this week and in weeks previously— 
much like the actions of Representa-
tive GREENE earlier this year—would 
convey a dangerous lesson to our chil-
dren and teenagers that the opposite is 
true, that threatening violence against 
those with whom one disagrees is ac-
ceptable. It is not. That bullying and 
encouraging one’s followers to menace 
another person or another group is 
somehow compatible with citizenship 
in a democracy and indeed a civilized 
society. It is not. 
The resolution before us today is nec-
essary because we in this House who 
speak for the American people must re-
flect, as the Speaker said, the highest 
standards of American society. 
I just came from the Speaker’s office 
not too long ago. I don’t know how 
many of you have been there, but over 
the door it says it is Robert H. Michel 
Rooms. 
I had the opportunity to serve with 
Robert Michel. Robert Michel was a 
Republican, and he was from Peoria, Il-
linois. He was one of the finest, most 
decent men that I have known, not just 
serving in the Congress of the United 
States, but have known. He said this: 
‘‘Civility means being tough without 
being mean, being witty without being 
malicious, and . . . believing in the 
power of reason to influence public de-
bate while still being aware of the 
power’’—hear these last words—‘‘being 
aware of the power of irrationality in 
public life.’’ 
This resolution, Madam Speaker, is 
necessary because when Members of 
Congress and other elected officials 
speak and act, our constituents and 
followers give great weight to our 
words and actions. 
It is a way for them to rationalize 
unacceptable behavior as was done on 
January 6. It is disgusting, Madam 
Speaker, whenever someone out in the 
world tweets a threat of violence or 
hateful content. 
But when a Member of this House 
does so, no matter how you rationalize 
it, no matter how you try to put lip-
stick on that pig, it is a threat of vio-
lence. 
What Representative GOSAR did last 
week is not just worthy of censure, it 
demands it. 
And for anyone who threatens to 
apply the same standard to Democrats 
in the future, as Ms. SPEIER said, I am 
with you. This is not about Repub-
licans or Democrats; this is about de-
cency. This is about security for our 
Members. This is about democracy, not 
violent overthrow or opposition. 
I, for one, will join you in enforcing 
that standard on any Democrat who 
violates it. But I will tell you this, 
Madam Speaker, the analogies that the 
Republicans have been making limp 
badly. 
I am certain my fellow Democrats 
will do the same. Because this is not 
about party, it is not about politics, it 
is not about partisanship. It is about 
decorum, civility, safety, and, yes, the 
rule of law that was trampled upon on 
January 6. 
But this is not about January 6. This 
is about this incident of a Member 
using whatever medium you want to 
say on the public dime threatening and 
showing the killing of a Member of this 
House. Can’t that appall you, even that 
act? Do you have no shame? Madam 
Speaker, those are the questions that I 
would ask. 
No one—Democrat or Republican— 
ought to be allowed to engage in the 
promotion of violence against a fellow 
Member, or indeed, a fellow American. 
Because we know where the glorifi-
cation and promotion of violence leads, 
and we have seen it. We have seen it 
this year and in previous years. 
Piercing tweets become sharp knives. 
Fiery words bring out deadly fire-
arms. 
And cartoon killing begets real life 
bloodshed. 
This resolution specifically addresses 
Representative GOSAR’s actions, but it 
also reflects more generally, Madam 
Speaker, what I hope is a sentiment 
shared by Members from both parties 
that we have seen too much of violent 
speech in our politics and in this coun-
try, and it must end. 
In February, when we considered a 
resolution relating to the violence-pro-
moting and undecorous actions of Rep-
resentative GREENE, I recalled the fa-
mous words of Edmund Burke, who 
viewed service in his nation’s Par-
liament as the highest calling. 
He said the only thing necessary for 
the triumph of evil is for good men and 
women—he did not add that but would 
today, certainly—that good men and 
good women do nothing. 
Once again, the Republican leader-
ship in this House has chosen to do 
nothing. It is interesting because a far 
lesser offense resulted in the removal 
of a Republican by the Republicans 
from committee, STEVE KING of Iowa. 
So, again, the House, in light of that 
void, must take action. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ 
on both sides of the aisle to uphold a 
standard that should be critical to us 
all. Some modicum of respect for those 
who are political opponents, Madam 
Speaker, and some restraint is in the 
way we depict them and ourselves. 
Vote ‘‘yes’’ on this resolution. 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Kentucky (Mr. COMER), the ranking 
member of the Oversight and Reform 
Committee. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, during 
Democrat’s leadership of the House, we 
have seen an unprecedented exercise of 
authority that only a Democrat could 
wield due to the authoritarian nature 
of the actions. 
Democrat leadership has fined Re-
publican Members for not masking, in-
stalled metal detectors, stripped an-
other Republican of committee assign-
ments, issued and sought to enforce 
sweeping subpoenas against the former 
President and his top advisers, and I 
am not just talking about subpoenas 
related to the events of January 6. 
Democrats on the Oversight Com-
mittee are chilling, if not infringing, 
the First Amendment rights of advo-
cacy groups, corporations, and individ-
uals. 
They have asked for communications 
between certain nonprofit organiza-
tions and certain Members’ offices. 
These communications fall squarely 
within the right to petition and freely 
associate. 
And today, we are debating a resolu-
tion to censure Dr. GOSAR for some-
thing he posted to his Twitter account. 
While Republicans certainly do not 
condone violence and extreme behav-
ior, my question for this body is: When 
will we exact punishment in an equi-
table—that is one of the favorite words 
of my Democrat colleagues—equitable 
manner? 
Madam Speaker, we have Democrat 
colleagues who routinely call for vio-
lence in the streets, make anti-Semitic 
comments on Twitter, launch obsceni-
ties at our elected officials, and engage 
in inappropriate relationships 
with 
Chinese operatives. 
Yet, Madam Speaker, these Demo-
crats maintain even their leadership 
positions on prestigious and sensitive 
committees like the Intelligence Com-
mittee. 
The last time we took this extraor-
dinary step to censure a member of 
this House it was Congressman Rangel, 
and that was after a thorough Ethics 
Committee investigation into tax eva-
sion, improper use of official resources, 
and other improper benefits. 
Instead of solving America’s crises— 
drugs flowing across the southern bor-
der, rising gas prices and grocery 
prices, and this ongoing pandemic—we 
are here on the floor debating the cen-
sure of Dr. GOSAR. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentleman. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I urge 
my colleagues to vote against this res-
olution. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. ESCOBAR), a member of 
the House Ethics Committee.

November 17, 2021 
b 1515 
Ms. ESCOBAR. Madam Speaker, like 
Representative OCASIO-CORTEZ, I, too, 
have served in this House for 3 years, 
and I have found the dignity and re-
spect that we deserve and owe one an-
other in this Chamber has been se-
verely lacking. 
While my Democratic colleagues and 
I continue to work on critical legisla-
tion that improves the lives of Ameri-
cans, Mr. GOSAR, a Member of the Re-
publican Conference, has decided to 
focus on promoting xenophobia and 
fetishizing violence, fanning the flames 
of hate. 
Words have power. My community 
knows that only too well. And the ex-
ample we set as Members of Congress is 
followed by millions of Americans. Mr. 
GOSAR’s actions continue to lower the 
bar, obliterate standards for respect 
and civility, and make this workplace 
unsafe by targeting a colleague—a 
woman of color. I would like to note 
that women of color are frequent tar-
gets of hateful rhetoric and attacks 
like these. 
In any other environment, someone 
like Mr. GOSAR
would have imme-
diately faced termination, would have 
to live with the consequences of his 
dangerous actions and words, but not 
in the Republican Conference. 
Mr. GOSAR’s video, which glorifies 
the gruesome killing of our colleague 
and a violent attack against our Presi-
dent should have sparked immediate 
condemnation and action by the minor-
ity leader and his entire conference. 
But instead, we are told to relax, and 
we are threatened, told that if we dare 
take action, we will face retaliation. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 15 seconds to the 
gentlewoman. 
Ms. ESCOBAR. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the chairman. 
Madam Speaker, I say to my col-
leagues, when you give hate, racism, 
and violence cover, you give it life. 
With this vote, we are saying ‘‘not on 
our watch.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I invite my Repub-
lican colleagues to do what is right and 
support this resolution. 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. ROY). 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, my colleague just 
referenced the phrase ‘‘any other envi-
ronment’’ that there would be some 
consequences. Well, this is not any 
other environment. This is the House 
of Representatives. We have constitu-
ents who elect us, send us to Wash-
ington to represent them, engage in de-
bate, engage in often heated discus-
sions with each other. This is not the 
same. 
One of the fundamental problems we 
have as a Chamber right now is that it 
is being treated that way. It is being 
treated that way by the majority. 
Shutting down our ability to engage in 
actual debate; shutting down our abil-
ity to move about the Chamber wear-
ing these masks; talking about right 
now with CMS and what is happening, 
as early as December 5, doctors in San 
Antonio, Texas, which I represent, 
being unable to perform their tasks as 
doctors, potentially resulting in loss of 
life and being able to carry out their 
livelihoods through vaccine mandates. 
We have got untold harm occurring 
in South Texas with bodies in body 
trailers. We have got people dying. We 
have got actual consequences from 
these vaccine mandates causing people 
to lose their jobs, whether it is OSHA- 
related, private-sector jobs, military, 
defense, border patrol; all this hap-
pening as we head towards December 3 
with a potential government shutdown. 
And this is what we are having an ac-
tual debate on the floor of the House 
for. 
I have not seen this Chamber look 
like this since I have been in Congress 
where we are debating an issue and we 
have got 100 Members on the floor. We 
are down here usually giving speeches 
to an empty Chamber. 
Now, look, let me be clear. I would 
not have posted that video. I would 
have told my staff I don’t want to do 
that, if I knew what was in it, okay? 
But the video that was posted was an 
effort to make a point. 
The SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentleman. 
Mr. ROY. And we are now getting 
into the business of chilling debate and 
discussion about censuring our Mem-
bers and going down the road of pulling 
each other off of committees. Where is 
this going to end? When Republicans 
are back in majority, where is that 
going to end? 
When my colleague, Ms. OCASIO-COR-
TEZ, in January called my former boss 
and my good friend, TED CRUZ, an at-
tempted murderer, and I sent a letter 
to the leader saying, I am not asking 
for her to be stripped from committees 
but just to apologize, it was met with 
utter silence. 
I called then and I call now for us to 
drop that down and actually engage in 
debate on the issues that matter, actu-
ally engage in debate on what is occur-
ring right now in America where people 
are getting harmed with vaccine man-
dates, tyranny, and open borders. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. GARCIA). 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, Representative GOSAR’s behavior is 
alarming, unacceptable, and should 
never, ever be tolerated. 
The official communication accounts 
of a Member of the United States Con-
gress should never in any way show or 
encourage violence against a colleague 
or threaten the President of the United 
States. 
On January 6, we personally experi-
enced the consequences of allowing this 
kind of viciousness and vulgarity. Put 
simply, violent images in our politics 
encourages violence against any of us. 
No one, especially women and women 
of color, should fear coming to do the 
work they were elected to do for the 
people. 
We must encourage our women to 
lead, not silence them by tolerating 
threats like Congressman GOSAR’s. As 
Members of Congress, we must set an 
example for the entire country instead 
of encouraging violence against others. 
It is our moral imperative to be colle-
gial to one another. It is our responsi-
bility to hold ourselves accountable. 
And it is our obligation to protect the 
integrity and honor of the United 
States Congress. 
Madam Speaker, children are watch-
ing. The world is watching. We must do 
better. 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
North Dakota (Mr. ARMSTRONG). 
Mr. ARMSTRONG. Madam Speaker, I 
was in Minneapolis the Saturday that 
speech was given, so to say that it 
wasn’t analogous, I think, is fairly un-
certain. The entire town was a tinder-
box. 
So as we continue to move through 
this, I would appreciate a little less of 
the self-righteous indignation. What is 
really damaging here and what is real-
ly unfortunate is that we have aban-
doned any recognition of institutional 
integrity, any pretense of fairness, any 
notion that something should be above 
partisanship. 
Because I got news—and I believe 
this—I thought what was said in Min-
neapolis doesn’t rise to incitement of 
violence. Jury tampering, possibly. Ir-
responsible, absolutely. The same thing 
goes for this post. It was dumb. It was 
silly. It was stupid. It was mean-spir-
ited. But you know what it is not? It is 
not incitement of violence. And when 
we use hyperbole in those words, we 
cause ourselves problems, but there is 
no point and attempt with the major-
ity at this point to follow through on 
any rules or procedures. 
The U.S. House of Representatives 
looks significantly more like a junior 
high lunchroom than a legislative 
body. If you are in our clique, you are 
okay. If not, tough. If we like you, no 
fines. If we don’t, we will take it out of 
your paycheck. A Member on your side 
calls for violence, motion to table; a 
Member on our side, stand in the well 
and answer for your sins. Rules matter, 
process matters, the institution mat-
ters. 
Madam Speaker, this will be the 
fourth 
Member 
of 
the 
minority 
stripped of their committees by the 
majority this Congress. That has never 
happened before, but it is going to hap-
pen again. 
And that is what I don’t understand. 
I understand completely why the ma-
jority’s leadership is willing to do any-
thing to maintain control over the cau-
cus until the next election. But in the 
process, you are all negatively and per-
manently changing the way this body

functions—forever. 
You 
are 
weaponizing the gavel against minority 
Members. And if you think it stops at 
the next election, I have no doubt that 
the leadership in the majority has no 
intention of going back to being a 
rank-and-file Member in the minority, 
but the rest of you all will. And how do 
you think this ends? When the pen-
dulum swings, and it will, we are all 
going to suffer the consequences. 
The SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentleman. 
Mr. ARMSTRONG. Madam Speaker, 
the institution is going to suffer for it, 
and it is already suffering for it. 
Committee 
structures, 
scheduling 
hearings, witness lists, these are all 
purviews of the majority. But rules of 
conduct and decorum have to be ap-
plied equally to all Members or the in-
stitution continues to degrade. 
Madam Speaker, the rules are not 
being applied equally. It is noticed by 
us. It is noticed by the American peo-
ple. It is unfortunate, and it is sad. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are again reminded to address 
their remarks to the Chair. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
South Carolina (Mr. CLYBURN), the 
House majority whip. 
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding me 
the time. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of this censure resolution. Today’s 
action is necessary due to Representa-
tive GOSAR’s shocking depiction of a 
murder of a colleague and a violent at-
tack against the President of the 
United States. This incendiary behav-
ior cannot go unaddressed. The minor-
ity leader’s failure to hold his con-
ference Member accountable leaves us 
no choice but to proceed with this ac-
tion. 
I often refer to the Hall of this House 
as America’s classroom. As Members of 
this august body, we should conduct 
ourselves in the way that we want our 
students to emulate. Mr. GOSAR’s be-
havior fails our students, fails our col-
leagues, and fails our Nation and ideals 
we espouse. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a unanimous 
vote for this resolution. 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. GOOD). 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Madam Speak-
er, as my colleagues before me have 
said, this is not about Mr. GOSAR. This 
is about hypocrisy from the majority 
and the double standard. Does anyone 
in this Chamber think we would be 
here today if the exact situation was 
reversed? Clearly, we would not be here 
today. 
Madam Speaker, the American peo-
ple don’t care about what we are doing 
here today. When we get back to our 
districts next week, no one will ask us, 
Well, what about the cartoon video? 
What happened with that? The media 
cares—as we can see here today—my 
colleagues across the aisle care because 
they have an opportunity again here. 
But what our hardworking constitu-
ents care about is the disastrous poli-
cies enacted by this administration and 
the majority; the disastrous policies, 
none of which are working. 
We cannot point to one thing in the 
country that is going well under these 
disastrous policies. The border inva-
sion, the rising gas prices, the out-of- 
control inflation, the reckless spending 
of our children’s future, the failure in 
Afghanistan, the failure of our stand-
ing around the world. There is not one 
issue—rising crime—nothing they can 
point to. 
So instead, we point to a distraction 
here today to pretend that this matters 
to the American people. We have got 
this faux outrage, as others who have 
said, because the Rasmussen poll said 
just this week that on the generic bal-
lot Republicans are up by 13 percent, 
but the tone-deaf majority is trying to 
ram through as much of their partisan 
agenda as they can. 
But what they are going to find out 
is America spoke two weeks ago in the 
election, and there are many of their 
constituents, and now former Demo-
crats who spoke two weeks ago as well, 
and they are saying, what in the world 
are we doing here on the House floor 
today? We are stalling before we try to 
pass a radical build back bankrupt Ber-
nie and AOC’s budget bill. And here we 
are today trying to punish a Member, 
another ounce of flesh, trying to si-
lence Republican voices on commit-
tees. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to vote against this sham bill 
and resolution. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from 
Florida 
(Ms. 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ). 
Ms. 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to urge the 
censure and the removal from commit-
tees of Mr. GOSAR for portraying the 
murder of a fellow colleague and pro-
moting violence against immigrants. 
We know that promoting visions of vio-
lence and spreading false, hateful rhet-
oric foments actual violence. January 6 
taught us that. And surely, we cannot 
use taxpayers’ own money to promote 
violent images and conduct directed at 
other Members. 
I still see bedside visions of my 
friend, Gabby Giffords, fighting for her 
life after being shot at a district event, 
her aide already dead. I shudder to re-
call our own colleague, Mr. SCALISE, 
limping to this very Chamber on a cane 
because someone tried to assassinate 
him. Explosive residue still clings to a 
stairwell outside my district office 
where a pipe bomb, sent by a deranged 
Trump supporter and handled by my 
staff later, had to be safely detonated. 
The history of violence aimed at 
women and people of color and those 
who 
defend 
them 
are 
among 
humankind’s worst chapters. 
Madam Speaker, it is ironic that Mr. 
GOSAR compares himself to Alexander 
Hamilton and another Member con-
dones the stylized violence portrayed 
by Mr. GOSAR, because Hamilton was 
actually killed by accepted high-class 
violence in his day in a duel. 
Madam Speaker, promoting and glo-
rifying such conduct cannot be con-
doned or ignored by this body. Voting 
to censure Mr. GOSAR today firmly de-
nounces it unequivocally. 
b 1530 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Louisiana (Mr. HIGGINS). 
Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, America is being crushed 
under the oppressive weight of the 
Democrats’ greed for lust and power. 
They want totalitarian control over 
every aspect of American life, and they 
are ruling the people’s House as if they 
were royalty. America is dissolving 
under our feet, and Democrats are wor-
ried about cartoons. 
In Afghanistan, Democrats led the 
betrayal of American honor and aban-
donment of American citizens, grant-
ing control of the Afghan theater to 
Taliban terrorists and arming those 
jihadist terrorists with billions of dol-
lars worth of American weapons sys-
tems. 
Our southern border control has dis-
integrated, American sovereignty lost, 
and control of our own border com-
pletely ceded to criminal cartels. 
American parents are tracked like 
terrorists and persecuted by our own 
FBI because parents had the audacity 
to challenge government indoctrina-
tion of their children, assembling to re-
dress their grievances at their own 
school boards in their own commu-
nities. American parents are treated 
like criminals. 
Americans are dealing with unbeliev-
able inflation. Families cannot afford 
groceries and fuel. 
Millions of Americans are being com-
manded by Federal decree to choose be-
tween losing their job or kneeling to 
comply with an unconstitutional, man-
dated medical procedure. 
And the oppressors intend to distract 
you with cartoons. 
Over the Speaker’s podium are for-
ever etched the words ‘‘In God We 
Trust.’’ Scripture says: A friend loveth 
at all times, and a brother is born for 
adversity. 
Madam Speaker, I stand today with 
my brother PAUL
GOSAR
because I 
stand against oppression and persecu-
tion. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. JONES), an Ethics Com-
mittee member. 
Mr. JONES. Madam Speaker, not 
since the Civil War has Congress oper-
ated under the constant threat of vio-
lence from some of its own Members, 
but here we are. That is the behavior 
that Mr. GOSAR has encouraged.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6345 
November 17, 2021 
Maybe I shouldn’t be surprised, hav-
ing watched so many of my colleagues 
on the other side of the aisle incite and 
then express support for the insurrec-
tionists who nearly killed us in this 
Chamber on January 6. 
We cannot let the Republican Party 
make Congress the only workplace in 
America where violence against your 
coworkers is not a crime but a creden-
tial. 
If we don’t hold people like Mr. 
GOSAR accountable, we will only em-
bolden the worst people in our politics 
to bring their fever dreams to life. 
That is why, today, we are standing 
up for the safety of our colleagues, for 
the safety of Congresswoman OCASIO- 
CORTEZ, and for the future of our de-
mocracy. 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. GOHMERT). 
Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, I 
looked at the video anime and was try-
ing to figure it out. I couldn’t see it. I 
am told if you stop it frame by frame, 
you can see what my Democrat friends 
are talking about. I couldn’t see it. I 
tried to freeze-frame, and I saw what I 
was told was supposed to be our col-
league, 
Congresswoman 
OCASIO-COR-
TEZ. I was insulted for her. If that is 
supposed to be her, that is really un-
fair. 
Madam Speaker, I didn’t see the vio-
lence being talked about. We should 
not condone violence. The reason it is 
so hard to sit here and listen to the 
condemnation from the other side is 
because 
when 
there 
was 
violence 
against us, there was no condemnation. 
My wife and I went to a speech at the 
White House, and I have yet to hear 
anybody condemn the attempted vio-
lence on us. We were chased for two 
blocks. RAND PAUL was on TV when he 
was chased because he had cameras and 
Secret Service around him. We didn’t 
have that. 
If it weren’t for a guy popping up and 
opening a locked door, we would have— 
I told Kathy: Look, I am afraid they 
are going to get here before this door is 
opened. You run on down to Pennsyl-
vania Avenue. There are cops down 
there. They will be beating on me; you 
just get away. 
Nobody has condemned all that vio-
lence that I have ever heard. 
This is where we ought to be able to 
come together. Oh, and by the way, 
people who committed violence and did 
crimes in this building need to be pun-
ished. For many of them, the most se-
rious crime was obstructing an official 
session of Congress. 
I didn’t know it was a crime in 2016, 
but most of the Democratic Party com-
mitted a felony right here in this 
Chamber by obstructing an official ses-
sion of Congress, not 6 hours like Janu-
ary 6, but 26 hours. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. LEE). 
Ms. 
LEE 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank 
Congresswoman 
SPEIER for her leadership as well as 
Chairman DEUTCH and the Speaker for 
bringing this with urgency. 
Representative GOSAR used taxpayer- 
funded resources to publicize a cartoon 
of him killing one of our House col-
leagues, Congresswoman OCASIO-COR-
TEZ, and threatening to kill the Presi-
dent. 
When Republicans don’t condemn 
death threats against their colleagues 
and the President, it sends a message 
to the public that these threats are 
condoned. Their silence and misrepre-
sentation in light of these threats 
speak volumes. 
Now, it might be easy for Mr. GOSAR 
to shrug this off as a joke, but it is not 
only Members of Congress but women 
and people of color throughout the 
country who deal daily with the threat 
of physical violence. This is no laugh-
ing matter. 
As someone who for decades has had 
to live with death threats, this is a mo-
ment when we need to say enough is 
enough. Hate speech leads to hate vio-
lence. Death threats can lead to death. 
Threats to murder people can lead to 
criminal charges. 
This is the minimum we need to do. 
It reinforces that this behavior will not 
be tolerated. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this resolution. 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Ohio (Mr. JORDAN), the ranking mem-
ber on the Judiciary Committee. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, as we 
speak, the FBI is treating parents as 
terrorists. The Department of Justice 
is getting ready to pay people $450,000 
who illegally entered our country. And 
Democrats in Congress later this week 
plan to spend $2 trillion more, which 
we all know will only exacerbate the 
already 30-year-high inflation. 
What are they doing today? Cen-
suring a Member for a cartoon. You 
have got to be kidding me. You have 
got to be kidding me. 
What scares me most about all of 
this is the attack that we have seen on 
the First Amendment over the last 
year from the left, from the Demo-
cratic Party. They are attacking moms 
for standing up and speaking at a 
school board meeting. There are still 
places in this country where a full con-
gregation cannot meet on a Sunday 
morning, stopping Americans from ex-
ercising their First Amendment free-
dom of religion rights. 
The Speaker of the House stopped 
Americans 
from 
petitioning 
their 
Member of Congress to redress their 
grievances and wouldn’t even let them 
in their own Capitol. 
Now, here we go again, censuring 
speech. The most fundamental liberty 
we have is our right to speak, our right 
to talk, our right to communicate, and 
they are going after that today because 
they don’t like freedom. You can see it. 
They don’t like it. 
This is wrong. We know it is wrong, 
what they are doing to our colleague, 
Mr. GOSAR. I hope they will have sec-
ond thoughts and that we will vote this 
down. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄4
minutes to the gentleman 
from Minnesota (Mr. PHILLIPS), an Eth-
ics Committee member. 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Madam Speaker, I 
love freedom. I love George Wash-
ington. I keep this book on my desk, 
‘‘George Washington’s Rules of Civility 
and Decent Behaviour.’’ I encourage 
every colleague in this body—every one 
of us—to keep this on your desk and 
refer to it. 
I have heard everything talked about 
today—inflation, 
Afghanistan, 
schools—except the issue we are here 
for: a censure of a Member of Congress 
who issued a despicable video showing 
the killing of a fellow Member of Con-
gress. 
Worst of all, most despicable of all, 
the object of the censure said it was to 
attract a new generation. Think about 
that: to attract a new generation of 
Americans. 
We have to do better, my friends. 
Come on. 
To my friend from Virginia who said, 
if Democrats had done this, what would 
we do? Rest assured, my friends, every 
one of you, we would do the same thing 
because I will never ever allow a fellow 
Member of Congress to threaten or dis-
tribute a video showing the killing of 
one of us, let alone another American. 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Colorado (Mrs. BOEBERT). 
Mrs. BOEBERT. Madam Speaker, 
Democrat policies are so pathetic and 
have done so poorly that the left has 
nothing else to do but troll the inter-
net, looking for ways to get offended, 
and then try to target Members and 
strip them of their committees. This is 
a dumb waste of the House’s time. But 
since the Speaker has designated the 
floor to discuss Members’ inappropriate 
actions, shall we? 
The jihad squad member from Min-
nesota has paid her husband—and not 
her brother husband, the other one— 
over a million dollars in campaign 
funds. This Member is allowed on the 
Foreign Affairs Committee while prais-
ing terrorists. 
A Democrat chairwoman incited fur-
ther violence in the streets outside of a 
courthouse. 
Then the cherry on top, my colleague 
and 3-month Presidential candidate 
from California, who is on the Intel-
ligence Committee, slept with Fang 
Fang, a Chinese spy. Let me say that 
again. A Member of Congress who re-
ceived classified briefings was sleeping 
with the enemy. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Pennsylvania (Ms. WILD), an Eth-
ics Committee member. 
Ms. WILD. Madam Speaker, as Maya 
Angelou said, ‘‘When someone shows 
you who they are, believe them the 
first time.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6346 
November 17, 2021 
Despite PAUL GOSAR’s history of dan-
gerous rhetoric, and despite his con-
duct showing him to be a dangerous ex-
tremist, he is still here in Congress. 
Now he has depicted himself killing 
one of our colleagues and the President 
of the United States. 
Never doubt that leaders’ calls for vi-
olence can lead to actual violence. We 
have seen it throughout the world, and 
we have seen it right here on January 
6. 
Nor should the actions of his tax-
payer-paid staff in creating and dis-
seminating this vile video be ignored. 
They are grown adults, and they have 
cultivated a hostile work environment 
for the subject of this disgusting video 
and for her staff. 
PAUL
GOSAR
has glorified violence 
against a duly elected official who 
came here to serve her district. She, 
nor any of us, sign up for this kind of 
abuse. Our families should not have to 
live with the fear that we will be the 
subject of violent attacks. 
PAUL GOSAR has shown who he is. Be-
lieve him. Censure him. 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. 
RICE). 
Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, with so many real problems 
facing Americans created by the Biden 
administration—open borders, soaring 
gas prices, sky-high grocery bills, and 
our embarrassment in Afghanistan— 
my friends across the aisle assemble us 
here today to debate a cartoon. 
Political cartoons routinely depict 
violence. It is not new. Cartoons have 
depicted violence since there were car-
toons. 
If you don’t believe me, google ‘‘po-
litical cartoons 2021.’’ You will see a 
depiction of Joe Biden killing a Repub-
lican with a steamroller and a Repub-
lican elephant trampling voters, among 
many others. 
Now, I will ask all of you out there to 
watch the Gosar cartoon that is occu-
pying the floor of the United States 
Congress for over an hour today. Is it 
inappropriate? 
Yes. 
Childish? 
Of 
course. Stupid? Without question. But 
is it a threat? Absolutely not. 
Now, I know some Members may 
need to seek therapy because they saw 
this cartoon. But is it a threat? Abso-
lutely not. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Massachusetts (Ms. CLARK), the 
Assistant Speaker of the U.S. House of 
Representatives. 
Ms. 
CLARK 
of 
Massachusetts. 
Madam Speaker, it started with a 
white supremacist online fringe move-
ment, and it turned into a deadly Janu-
ary 6 insurrection. 
Now I stand before you because a 
Member of this body has once again 
had her life threatened, but this time 
by a colleague who posted a video of 
killing her on his official account. 
Think about that. 
It is no coincidence that the recipi-
ents of this violence are most often 
women and women of color because 
this violence is directly connected to 
sexism and racism. 
We cannot and must not accept this 
behavior. 
Silence 
and 
excuses 
are 
condoning it. And the excuses we have 
heard today—this is okay because it is 
a highly stylized killing; it is a car-
toon; it was some sort of youth out-
reach—are grotesque. 
Enough is enough. Vote for this reso-
lution. Vote for censure. Vote for de-
cency. 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
b 1545 
Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. AGUILAR), who is the 
vice chair of the Democratic Caucus. 
Mr. 
AGUILAR. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
when an armed mob stormed the Cap-
itol earlier this year, they did so under 
the belief that political violence was 
an acceptable means to an end. As 
leaders and as Members of this body, 
every one of us has a responsibility to 
stand up and to make clear that way of 
thinking is unacceptable. 
We have a responsibility here to 
work together to keep our colleagues, 
our staff, and all of the people who 
work in this building safe. That goal 
becomes more difficult when Members 
are making open threats of violence on 
social media. 
It is not acceptable for a Member of 
Congress to insinuate that they want 
to violently kill another Member, and 
we need to directly respond to this 
threat. 
Today, we have an opportunity to 
send a strong, unified, bipartisan mes-
sage against this kind of conduct. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on the resolution 
to ensure accountability and recommit 
ourselves to the safety of every Mem-
ber and future Member of this body. 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. JEFFRIES), who is the 
chairman of the House Democratic 
Caucus. 
Mr. JEFFRIES. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in strong support of this censure 
resolution. Inciting violence is unac-
ceptable. Threatening to kill a col-
league, the President of the United 
States, or any American, is unaccept-
able. 
I rise to make it clear that we have 
an opportunity today to choose de-
cency over demonization, to choose ci-
vility over cynicism, and to choose the 
rule of law over recklessly violent be-
havior. That is why the House of Rep-
resentatives is acting and acting deci-
sively. We cannot normalize violence 
today, we cannot normalize violence 
tomorrow, and we cannot normalize vi-
olence at any point moving forward in 
our future. The House will hold PAUL 
GOSAR accountable for his violent and 
deplorable behavior whether the cover- 
up caucus likes it or not. 
Madam Speaker, vote ‘‘yes’’ on this 
censure resolution. 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 45 seconds to the gentlewoman 
from 
New 
Mexico 
(Ms. 
LEGER 
FERNANDEZ). 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, serving in public office is and 
should be a sacred responsibility, and 
that responsibility calls upon us to 
condemn hate when we see it. If we let 
hate fester and spread, then it will de-
stroy us. That is why one in three 
women have been attacked violently in 
this country and around the world. 
But instead of apologizing today, Re-
publicans chose to vilify immigrants 
yet again which is an outrage when the 
victim is herself a Latina. 
Madam Speaker, do you remember 
the gunman who traveled to El Paso to 
kill Mexicans after Republican politi-
cians demonized them? 
Scripture says: Love thy neighbor as 
thyself. 
And we must also love this institu-
tion. It is the love for this institution 
and the love for our fellow Members 
which is calling upon us to pass this 
resolution. 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, I 
am prepared to close. I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, I 
have no further speakers, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, I absolutely reject 
violence and calls for violence against 
any Member of Congress or anyone 
else. But by rushing this vote to the 
floor today and ignoring the process, 
the majority is setting a precedent 
that I fear may not serve this institu-
tion well in the future. 
The majority should withdraw this 
resolution, and, if it chooses, pursue 
this matter properly through law en-
forcement and/or the Ethics Com-
mittee. 
If the resolution is not withdrawn, 
then I am going to vote ‘‘no’’ and hope 
at some point that the Ethics Com-
mittee will, once again, serve this body 
as it was intended. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues 
to vote ‘‘no,’’ and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time to 
close. 
Madam Speaker, none of us wants to 
be here today revisiting the violent im-
agery and the vile, hateful content 
that Representative GOSAR delighted in 
disseminating over his official social 
media 
accounts—material 
defended 
over and over and over today by our 
colleagues. 
Had Republican leadership acted as 
they should have to hold their own 
Members 
accountable 
when 
they 
breach the most basic standards of de-
corum and decency, we wouldn’t be 
here. Yet, the House cannot ignore

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6347 
November 17, 2021 
Representative GOSAR’s conduct as Re-
publicans would have us do. 
January 6 must serve as a reminder 
of just how important this action is 
that we are about to take. On January 
6, violence stoked by hateful imagery 
and inflammatory rhetoric over social 
media found its way to the steps of the 
United States Capitol and the doors of 
this Chamber. 
On that day, insurrectionists broke 
those windows right near where I 
stand. Capitol Police officers drew 
their weapons, and Members bravely 
blocked the entrance. Heroes valiantly 
repelled the attack on our democracy. 
On this day, with our votes on this 
resolution, let us reject the notion that 
it is ever acceptable for a Member of 
Congress to threaten the safety of a 
fellow Member or depict the murder of 
a fellow Member. Let this resolution 
serve as an unwavering statement that 
never in this House should this type of 
horrific, violent imagery be deemed ac-
ceptable. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues 
on the other side of the aisle to smash 
the partisan lens through which they 
view this behavior and this debate. I 
ask all of my colleagues to support 
safety, civility, and decency by voting 
for H. Res. 789. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, Rep-
resentative GOSAR is a member of this institu-
tion as am I, and as is Representative 
OCASIO-CORTEZ, and so are roughly fifty other 
women of color. 
We all walk the same hallways and took the 
same oath of office. We are here to serve our 
districts and the American people. The graphic 
video that Rep. GOSAR posted violates every 
sense of mutual respect that we should have 
for one another. Not only that, but it also dan-
gerously promotes violence towards a sitting 
member of Congress who is a powerful Latina. 
It’s exactly the type of misogynistic and racist 
recklessness that the previous President de-
ployed, and social media companies eventu-
ally stripped him of his accounts. 
Rep. GOSAR needs to be held accountable 
for this and that’s what we are doing today. 
We need to deliver a message that in the peo-
ple’s house, this dangerous behavior will not 
be tolerated. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 795, the pre-
vious question is ordered on the resolu-
tion and the preamble, as amended. 
The question is on the resolution. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, 
on that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered.

MOMENT OF SILENCE HONORING 
THE LIFE AND SERVICE OF THE 
HONORABLE LARRY HOPKINS 
(Mr. BARR asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today with my colleagues from the 
Kentucky delegation to honor the life 
of a true American patriot, former 
Congressman 
Larry 
Hopkins, 
who 
served in this body from 1979 to 1993 
and passed away early yesterday. 
Throughout his extraordinary career 
in public service, Larry served in the 
Kentucky State legislature and for 
over a decade in Congress in the seat I 
now hold. 
Larry’s career in public service began 
as a U.S. marine in 1954. It was that 
love for the military that Larry would 
bring with him to the Congress, where 
he rose to become the top Republican 
on the Armed Services Committee. 
Larry’s humor was famous with both 
his constituents and his colleagues, al-
ways offering a disarming joke to 
lighten the mood or evoking a good 
laugh. 
Above all, Madam Speaker, Congress-
man Hopkins was proud of his work 
across the aisle and the relationships 
he had with all his colleagues, Repub-
licans and Democrats alike. 
In these divided times, let us be in-
spired by the legacy of Congressman 
Larry Hopkins to come together and 
solve the problems of our day not as 
Republicans 
or 
Democrats, but as 
Americans who all love our country. 
On behalf of a grateful Nation, I in-
vite my colleagues in the House to join 
me in praying for Larry’s family: his 
wife, Carolyn; and three children, Shae, 
Tara, and Josh. 
I now ask that the House observe a 
moment of silence to honor the life of 
Congressman Larry Hopkins. God bless 
Larry Hopkins.

BUILD BACK BETTER IS HISTORIC 
LEGISLATION 
(Ms. NORTON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, Build 
Back Better not only meets long- 
awaited critical needs, such as clean 
energy technology, it is fully paid for, 
unlike the 2001 and 2017 tax cuts under 
Republican Presidents. 
This is because the largest corpora-
tions and the highest income Ameri-
cans will pay their fair share, are not 
rewarded for shipping jobs and profits 
overseas, and will have more difficulty 
avoiding IRS compliance. 
Moreover, 17 Nobel Prize-winning 
economists say the bill’s investments 
enhance productive participation in 
our economy and ease the long-term 
inflation pressure that is the frontline 
concern of Americans today. 
Congress will make history by pass-
ing this historic legislation.

DADS ON DUTY 
(Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to offer much-de-
served recognition to the group of 
faithful fathers known as Dads on 
Duty, who have stepped up to serve as 
role 
models 
for 
the 
students 
at 
Southwood High School in my home-
town of Shreveport. Since the dads 
came to school, instances of disruptive 
behavior have plummeted, and spirits 
have been raised to new heights. 
These Dads on Duty walk the halls 
every day and talk to students about 
personal responsibility, self-discipline, 
and strong work ethic. They are there 
to encourage the kids and set an exam-
ple in their words and in their actions. 
It is irrefutable the role that fathers 
play in the life of a child. And now 
since these dads have made it a point 
of engaging directly with the kids at 
Southwood, school fights haven’t been 
a problem, grades and attitudes have 
risen, and the whole Nation’s attention 
has been drawn to this inspirational 
endeavor. 
They have made an incredible dif-
ference in the lives of everyone in-
volved. So we want to say thank you to 
the Dads on Duty for their incredible 
work and extraordinary example. May 
it be duplicated nationwide.

The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms.

WE MUST ACT ON THE OPIOID 
EPIDEMIC 
(Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to call on my colleagues to 
act on the opioid epidemic roiling our 
Nation. 
Today, we learned that between May 
of 2020 and April of 2021, more than 
100,000 
Americans 
died 
of 
drug 
overdoses, a grim, grim record. 
Drug overdoses now surpass deaths 
from car crashes and gun violence. 
Fentanyl alone was responsible for 
more overdoses than there were in all 
of 2016, just five years ago. 
We must expand access to medica-
tions like naloxone, which reverse an 
opioid overdose, and mental health 
services to crack down on overdose 
deaths from synthetics and opioids. 
Congress cannot do it alone. 
In every community across the coun-
try, there are dedicated public servants 
and committed groups working to com-
bat these figures and help individuals 
and families. Groups like the Lake 
County Opioid Initiative in my dis-
trict, cofounded by Mike Nerheim and 
Chelsea Laliberte-Barnes. 
After 8 years, Mike is stepping down 
as chair, and Chelsea is stepping up. I 
thank Mike for his leadership, and as 
the cofounder and advocacy strategist 
for Live4Lali. I know Chelsea will con-
tinue the great work of LCOI at this 
critical time. 
Now Congress must help Mike, Chel-
sea, and the countless others around 
the country for whom this fight is so 
personal. 
f 
PARENTS HAVE A RIGHT TO 
VOICE THEIR OPINIONS 
(Mr. ROSENDALE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to condemn Merrick Garland tar-
geting parents who express their views 
on how their children are educated. 
Recently, parents have risen up to 
voice their opposition to schools indoc-
trinating their children with critical 
race theory, but Merrick Garland won’t 
stand for folks exercising their paren-
tal rights. 
Merrick Garland testified before the 
Senate Judiciary Committee that he 
didn’t think parents getting angry at 
school boards constitute domestic ter-
rorism, and that he could not imagine 
a circumstance where they would be la-
beled as domestic terrorism. 
Despite this, it is now clear Garland 
has weaponized the FBI’s counterter-
rorism division against concerned par-
ents, using threat tags to label and sur-
veil them as domestic terror threats. 
Parents have a right and an obliga-
tion to voice their opinion on how their 
children are educated, and I whole-
heartedly agree critical race theory 
has no place in our classrooms. 
Weaponizing the FBI against con-
cerned parents is dangerous and an ab-
solute disgrace. 
Merrick Garland must resign imme-
diately. Thank God he isn’t on the Su-
preme Court.

MINNESOTANS NEED BUILD BACK

ability and childcare affordability cri-
sis, a massive racial wealth and edu-
cation gap.

as much as they spend on mortgage

CONGRATULATING KATIE HEARN 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to congratulate 
Katie Hearn for her appointment to the 
Georgia State Rehabilitation Council. 
Beginning as an intern for the At-
lanta Braves, this year’s world cham-
pions, Katie’s passion for the Braves 
community propelled her to a full-time 
position within the organization. How-
ever, at the age of 28, Katie was diag-
nosed with a rare brain disorder that 
caused her to lose her sight. 
Her illness forced her to step down 
from her position as she adjusted to 
her new normal, but Katie is resilient 
and soon returned to the Atlanta 
Braves, where she currently works as a 
senior coordinator for digital and ac-
cessible services. 
Katie has always been committed to 
ensuring every visitor has an incredible 
experience in Truist Park. 
In 2018 the Braves awarded her with 
the Walker Banks Award for her ex-
traordinary customer service. 
Katie’s passion for providing oppor-
tunities to Georgians with disabilities 
to live, work, and thrive in our State is 
truly inspiring. 
I am honored to recognize Katie for 
this prestigious accomplishment, and I 
am grateful for her service.

HISTORIC 
LEGISLATION 
EMPOW-
ERS THE GREAT LAKES REGION 
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to applaud President Biden’s bi-
partisan Infrastructure Investment and 
Jobs Act. This historic legislation is an 
enormous win for the American people. 
Finally, from coast to coast, in every 
State, district, and territory of our Na-
tion, the Infrastructure Investment 
and Jobs Act will deliver significant 
new resources. Together, America will 
restore our Nation’s crumbling infra-
structure. Together, we will create mil-
lions of good-paying jobs over the next 
decade. 
The Great Lakes region will be em-
powered with billions of dollars to re-
build our roads, bridges, rail lines, revi-
talize our water infrastructure and air-
ports. 
We 
will 
deploy 
modern 
broadband connectivity and new car-
bon-free energy systems. 
By properly rewarding those who 
make and build what makes and builds 
America, we will create a fairer, more 
just, and more prosperous future for 
our middle-class workers, families, and 
communities. 
For years there has been talk about 
infrastructure. President Biden is de-
livering and building back better for 
Americans from coast to coast.

NOTHING COMES FOR FREE 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, this 
Friday the Congressional Budget Office 
allegedly will release their assessment 
of President Biden’s Build Back Better 
agenda under budget reconciliation. 
Their 
assessment 
will 
determine 
whether the Democrats have come up 
with enough tax increases and other 
measures that will actually cover the 
cost of the bill over the next 10 years. 
But the White House seems to now 
believe that the nonpartisan Congres-
sional Budget Office isn’t qualified to 
provide us with an objective cost esti-
mate, even though that is the entire 
point of the CBO. 
As the Congressional Budget Office is 
forcing the Biden administration to ac-
knowledge that their Build Back Bet-
ter agenda will certainly cost a lot 
more than the zero dollars he initially 
claimed, Biden is still telling Demo-
crats to disregard the report. 
Madam Speaker, nothing comes for 
free; and so far, initial estimates from 
the Congressional Budget Office show 
that the Build Back Better agenda will 
increase our national deficit by more 
than $150 billion each year. 
Had it not been for some Democrats 
listening to the Republicans’ insistence 
that we don’t vote until we at least 
have a price tag, President Biden prob-
ably would have been able to sneak 
this through the House without having 
to admit its true cost. 
f 
REPORT ON THE SOUTHERN 
BORDER 
(Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
haven’t seen the Vice President at the 
border lately. I was down there about a 
month ago, and I just want to share a 
few things that I learned down there 
that maybe somebody else can pass on 
to her. 
First of all, when you’re at the Yuma 
center, when you walk along the path 
the people walk to get in this country, 
it is littered with photo IDs. Obviously, 
people do not want the United States 
Government or Border Patrol to know 
who they are. So this is a sign we are 
getting people in this country who 
have a lot to hide. 
The second thing to point out that I 
was not aware of until I talked to the 
Border Patrol, is they feel they don’t 
have the right to test somebody for 
COVID. We know that some people who 
are testing positive are already let in 
the country. I was not aware until I 
went down there that it is the current 
policy if you say, I want to test you for 
COVID, and you refuse, they just let 
you in. 
The third thing I want to point out is 
that apparently they are advertising 
on Central American TV for people to 
come here. 
Obviously, if we had a better rela-
tionship with those Central American 
countries, this wouldn’t be going on, 
but if you wonder why so many people 
are coming here, it is because the drug 
gangs are advertising on TV. 
f 
THANKSGIVING TAX 
(Mrs. STEEL asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mrs. STEEL. Madam Speaker, we are 
just 1 week away from Thanksgiving, 
and American families are bracing for 
one of the most expensive in history. 
The cost of almost everything is up; 
from the turkey to the pumpkin pie, 
your Thanksgiving meal will cost you 
significantly more than last year’s. 
Rising costs aren’t just making it 
hard to put food on the table. The price 
of a gallon of gas is up 61 percent na-
tionally from last year, making it 
more expensive for families to travel to 
loved ones this holiday season. 
Inflation is a hidden tax that hurts 
the lowest income Americans the most. 
This Thanksgiving tax is just the lat-
est example of bad economic policies 
that are making life for Americans 
more expensive. 
Throwing trillions of dollars at the 
problems we are facing is not the solu-
tion and will only make these issues 
worse.

VACCINE MANDATES ARE 
UNCONSTITUTIONAL 
(Mr. FALLON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. FALLON. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to discuss the unconstitutional 
overreach shown by this President in 
his recent vaccine mandate. And don’t 
be fooled, this is nothing more than an 
attack on frontline workers, small 
businesses, and the rights of every 
American. 
OSHA’s regulatory powers are lim-
ited to the workplace and the work-
place alone. 
Joe Biden is now trying to use OSHA 
as an instrument in his political game;

mandating a vaccine, and taking away 
medical freedoms from millions of 
Americans. 
This goes far beyond OSHA’s jurisdic-
tion, and it is incomprehensible. 
It affects employees’ ability to make 
life-changing, personal healthcare deci-
sions. 
This is the textbook definition of 
‘‘tyranny,’’ and it must be stopped. 
The policies this administration con-
tinues to hand out are rising prices, 
bottlenecking our supply chain, and 
causing a historic labor shortage. 
What do they think a draconian fine 
of $14,000 per employee will do to em-
ployers? I will tell you what it will do; 
it will bury our economy. 
Big Government is not the solution. 
It is the problem.

SELF-INFLICTED CRISES OF THE

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-

isiana (Mr. JOHNSON) is recognized for 
60 minutes as the designee of the mi-
nority leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members have 5 legislative days to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the sub-
ject of my Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Louisiana? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, during what should be a pe-
riod of sustained economic recovery, 
job growth has stalled, consumer prices 
are skyrocketing, and many shelves 
are empty thanks to supply chain 
chokepoints. 
Nevertheless, House Democrats are 
forging ahead to pass their 2,100-page 
reckless tax and spending spree before 
they even know how it impacts the 
budget and before the American people 
can understand even what is in it, 
which is certain to drive up consumer 
prices even further and make job 
growth that much harder. 
Make no mistake, this bill is a 
clunker. If you can stomach the price 
tag and look underneath the hood, you 
will see tax breaks for the rich; you 
will see incentives to stay home in-
stead of going back to work; massive 
taxpayer subsidies for inefficient green 
energy sources; and fewer cures for 
rare diseases. 
The bill eliminates jobs. It reduces 
paychecks. It increases government de-
pendency. It crushes small businesses. 
It repeals longstanding protections 
against taxpayer funding of abortions. 
And it taxes American companies at a 
higher rate than Communist China. 
Yes, that is all in the bill. 
During our time this afternoon, in 
addition to the House Democrats’ dis-
astrous 
left-wing 
agenda, 
my 
col-
leagues and I will be discussing the 
many self-inflicted crises of the Biden 
administration. Whether it is the most 
expensive Thanksgiving in history, in-
flation, skyrocketing gas prices, or our 
overwhelmed 
southern 
border, 
one 
thing is for certain, the answer to the 
countless Democrat-caused crises is 
not more Democrat-authored policies. 
I thank my colleagues for being here 
today, and I yield to the gentleman 
from Ohio (Mr. JOHNSON). 
Mr. 
JOHNSON 
of 
Ohio. 
Madam 
Speaker, this administration’s assault 
on American energy—oil, natural gas, 
and coal—is causing energy prices to 
surge. They say they are doing this to 
address climate change, but make no 
mistake, this is not about carbon, it is 
about control. President Biden and his 
liberal allies in this body do not want 
our Nation to return to the energy 
independence we had just 2 short years 
ago because it means they would have 
less control over our daily lives. 
They want working families to feel 
economic pain in order to force them 
to change their behavior and reject fos-
sil fuel generated electricity. 
Consider this. Gas prices are up 61 
percent over last year. 
It is estimated American families 
could face a 54 percent increase in their 
home heating bills this winter. 
When asked about its plan to lower 
energy prices, the Biden administra-
tion essentially told us that high en-
ergy prices are punishment for using 
fossil fuels—oil, gas, natural gas, coal— 
and that sacrifices must be made to 
make progress on the climate crisis, 
something China and Russia are abso-
lutely not willing to do. 
Surging energy prices in the Biden 
administration’s out-of-control govern-
ment spending that is causing inflation 
to surge to more than 6 percent is caus-
ing everything to cost more, from gaso-
line to groceries. 
Yet, while this Thanksgiving could 
be the most expensive in history, one 
administration official called this in-
flation tax a ‘‘high–class problem.’’ 
Put simply, when inflation increases, 
wages decrease. Everyday goods cost 
more. It hurts the poor, the middle 
class, our seniors, and those living day- 
to-day on a fixed income the most. 
Make 
no 
mistake, 
hardworking 
Americans can’t afford this adminis-
tration’s agenda and its complete lack 
of compassion and respect for working 
families any longer. 
I urge my colleagues to stand up to 
this administration’s far-left social re-
engineering agenda and the assault on 
fossil fuels that will continue harming 
the very Americans they claim so 
much to want to help the most. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. C. SCOTT FRANKLIN). 
Mr. C. SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today on behalf 
of families who will enjoy Thanks-
giving with their loved ones next week. 
This American tradition is an oppor-
tunity to give thanks for all our many 
blessings. 
Yet through no fault of their own, 
millions of hardworking families are 
struggling to count their blessings this 
year. Thanks to liberal policies en-
acted by the Biden administration and 
congressional Democrats, inflation is 
soaring, gas prices have spiked more 
than 50 percent, and supply chain dis-
ruptions are leaving store shelves 
empty. The cost of Thanksgiving din-
ner this year will be the highest in his-
tory, and it will cost more for folks to 
drive or fly to spend their holidays 
with loved ones. 
American families are hurting. 
My Democrat colleagues and their 
liberal elite mouthpieces in the media 
claim to be champions of the poor and 
the working class, yet an NBC cor-
respondent claims it’s a dirty little se-
cret that Americans can afford to pay 
more for their groceries because they 
saved money when they were trapped 
in their homes during the COVID pan-
demic. She also had the audacity to 
say that because more than half of 
Americans are invested in the stock 
market and it has been doing well that 
most people are actually better off 
now. 
How out of touch can she be? First, 
clearly she has zero regard for the half 
of the country that isn’t fortunate 
enough to have a stock portfolio. Sec-
ond, good luck trying to eat your 401(k) 
for Thanksgiving. Those are designed 
for retirement so tax penalties for 
early withdrawals are harsh. Here is 
the real dirty little secret: She knows 
that, but she is so beholden to the left 
that she is willing to provide them free 
cover. 
Washington Post and Bloomberg op- 
ed writers are telling us we should 
lower our expectations and live more 
like Europeans by simply getting used 
to the idea of empty store shelves. 
These out-of-touch elites are chan-
neling a let them eat cake mentality 
while American families are suffering. 
Recent elections have shown that 
Americans reject these attempts to 
fundamentally change our Nation from 
a prosperous environmental country 
into a suffering socialist regime.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6351 
November 17, 2021 
Inflation, intrusive government regu-
lations, and overreaching policies have 
left American families with less money 
and limited buying power. 
No American should ever have to 
lower their expectations while living in 
the most prosperous country in the 
world. As Americans, we are blessed to 
live in a country where we are free to 
pursue economic prosperity, even dur-
ing difficult times. 
Many of the economic challenges 
faced by American families today were 
created by the policies of an out-of- 
touch liberal ruling class, yet we stand 
on the brink of ramming through the 
largest and most expensive tax and 
spend initiative in history. 
It reminds me of the final scene in 
the movie ‘‘Thelma and Louise’’ when 
the lead characters drive their car off a 
cliff rather than face the consequences 
of their actions. Democrat Party lead-
ers are willing to figuratively drive our 
country off the cliff if that is what it 
takes to pass the build back broke pro-
gram in an electric car, I am sure. 
As we prepare to celebrate Thanks-
giving, I ask my Democrat colleagues 
and media elites to take a long, hard 
look at what their policies are doing to 
working-class Americans. 
Just say no. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from

Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I thank

for hosting this Special Order tonight. 
Madam Speaker, it has been 10 
months since Joe Biden took office, 
and look at the state of our country. 
Our southern border is eroding before 
our very eyes. Gas prices are sky-
rocketing. Inflation has gone up every 
month. Our currency is diminishing at 
an alarming rate. And now Americans 
are about to sit down to the most ex-
pensive Thanksgiving in history. 
How can anyone justify the fact that 
a bag of carrots has a price tag 48 per-
cent higher than just a year ago? 
My colleagues across the aisle know 
full well that every American is hurt-
ing because of their bad policies. They 
conveniently avoid the topic, telling 
people that inflation is actually a good 
thing. 
Give me a break. Try telling that to 
those hardworking Americans at the 
grocery store or at the gas pump now. 
What will it take for the left to fi-
nally come to their senses and say no 
more? 
b 1700 
Is commonsense and wisdom some-
thing of the past? Outdated and dis-
regarded? Democrats criticize us for 
telling the American people that they 
are destroying the country. They try to 
divert the American people’s attention 
by censuring a Republican congress-
man over a cartoon; but I would ask 
them to simply look around. We are in 
a state of crisis and decay; and hard-
working, law-abiding, freedom-loving 
Americans fear the inevitable outcome 
should we continue down this path. 
That outcome, what is it? Socialism, 
folks. 
Today, I ask my Democrat colleagues 
to look at the burden that they have 
put on the American people and face 
the fact that history has so clearly 
written—a socialist utopia simply does 
not exist. 
Today, I ask them, on behalf of every 
single American in this Nation, to find 
the courage and rise and say enough. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I thank my friend for that re-
minder that socialism never worked 
and never has. It is a fool’s errand. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROSE). 
Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my colleague from Louisiana for the 
opportunity 
to 
address 
the 
House 
today. 
This week, President Biden signed 
into law the $1.2 trillion Infrastructure 
and Investment Jobs Act, which fo-
cuses more on pushing Democrats’ far- 
left socialist policies than on Amer-
ica’s crumbling infrastructure needs. 
Madam Speaker, the signing of this 
bill comes on the heels of Democrats’ 
reckless taxing-and-spending spree and 
senseless policies that have created an 
economic crisis of monumental propor-
tions. 
As the Biden administration takes a 
victory lap, the American people are in 
no mood to celebrate. Inflation is at a 
30-year high as prices on everything 
are more now than they were just 1 
year ago. Gas is up 49 percent; beef is 
up 20 percent; home heating bills are 
up 28.1 percent. 
Under 
the 
Biden 
administration, 
working families are getting crushed. 
Increased costs at the grocery store 
and the gas pump and higher home 
heating bills are squeezing Americans 
dry. Skyrocketing inflation is driving 
down real wages for hardworking mid-
dle-class families and making it more 
difficult for those living on fixed budg-
ets to make ends meet. 
Instead of addressing the root cause 
of inflation—which, by the way and for 
the RECORD, is largely caused by out- 
of-control 
government 
spending— 
House Democrats are continuing to 
push their sweeping $1.75 trillion build 
back broke act. 
This package would once again hand 
out cash to households and create new 
paid leave benefits with no expectation 
of work. However, as we all know, an 
engaged workforce is key to invig-
orating economic recovery and slowing 
inflation. Make no mistake, wasteful 
and increased spending by Democrats, 
much of which is being funded by even 
more borrowed money, won’t slow in-
flation; it will supercharge it. 
Madam Speaker, I strongly urge 
President Biden and Democrats in Con-
gress to reconsider the devastating eco-
nomic consequences they are proposing 
to enact. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I thank my friend. He is so 
right about that. The hardworking 
American families are feeling the pain 
from Tennessee all the way to Cali-
fornia. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
OBERNOLTE), my good friend. 
Mr. OBERNOLTE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today deeply 
concerned that this body is scheduling 
a vote on what will likely be the most 
expensive spending package in the his-
tory of the United States without 
knowing the true cost of that package. 
Our own House rules, House rule XIII, 
requires us to wait for a score from the 
Congressional Budget Office before vot-
ing on a budget bill, and the budget 
reconciliation and Impoundment Con-
trol Act of 1974 requires the CBO to 
issue that score. But unfortunately, we 
are rushing through this vote without 
even knowing the true cost of the bill. 
Last week, I led a group of almost 
half of the House of Representatives in 
sending a letter to the Speaker urging 
her not to vote on this bill until its 
true costs are known. I am sure most 
Americans saw the President of the 
United States go on television two 
weeks ago and tell the American public 
that this spending bill will not add a 
single dollar to the national deficit. 
And our response to that is, if that is 
the case, Mr. President, prove it. Prove 
it by waiting for the CBO to issue a 
score on that bill. 
The reason why we are so concerned 
about this issue is that any economist 
will tell you that deficit government 
spending is dangerously inflationary, 
and we are already seeing the highest 
inflation in the United States in over 
40 years. 
Folks in my district are paying over 
$20 more today to fill the gasoline tank 
on their cars just to go to work than 
they were just a year ago. This infla-
tion is hurting everyday Americans 
and it will hurt them more if this bill 
spends more than it takes in in taxes, 
and every indication is that it will. 
Madam Speaker, I urge this body to 
wait for the Congressional Budget Of-
fice to score this bill before voting on 
it. It is the responsible thing to do. 
Anything less would be an abdication 
of our responsibility to the people that 
we represent. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from New Jersey (Mr. VAN 
DREW). 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Louisiana 
for doing this and for yielding and for 
all of his good work. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today, a week 
before one of America’s oldest, most 
deeply rooted holidays, ashamed of 
what this administration is doing to 
our great United States of America. 
American families look forward to a 
Thanksgiving feast where they are fi-
nally able to see distant relatives, re-
flect on their lives and, of course, share

November 17, 2021 
a table covered in food made from old 
family recipes. 
Yet, this year, families aren’t think-
ing about that. They are not thinking 
about what they will cook, but rather, 
how they will afford a Thanksgiving 
meal. Turkey prices are up 18 percent. 
Pumpkin pie is up 17 percent. Carrots, 
strangely enough, up 50 percent. Some 
families might not even have to worry 
about these rising food costs because 
they might not be able to travel to see 
their families due to soaring gas prices. 
A gallon of gas is up 61 percent, on av-
erage. If they are able to travel despite 
the price increases, they may enter a 
frigid home, as the cost to heat our 
homes has increased by 54 percent. 
The root cause of these price in-
creases is no big secret to anyone. 
They are the direct result of failed 
Biden policies. Policies that have led 
to rampant inflation, a crippled supply 
chain, and labor shortages on a scale 
that we never would have ever imag-
ined. 
Despite recent comments made by 
this administration and the media, in-
flation is a bad, bad thing. Buying a 
home? More expensive. Building a 
home? More expensive. Renting an 
apartment? More expensive. Gas, gro-
ceries, turkeys, and presents, more ex-
pensive. This is the Biden Thanks-
giving tax. 
Americans deserve a joyous Thanks-
giving after the suffering our Nation 
has endured over the past 2 years. And 
this administration is on track to be 
known as the grinch who not only stole 
Christmas, but the grinch that stole 
Thanksgiving as well. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I appreciate the comments of 
the gentleman. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. PFLUGER). 
Mr. PFLUGER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my colleague from Louisiana. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to ad-
dress a very important issue in our 
country. Crisis after crisis after crisis 
that we see, including last week where 
the President gathered with world 
leaders to discuss a fairytale climate 
agenda that will literally dismantle 
America’s national security based on 
disinformation. 
If we continue down this path, all 
Americans should worry about one 
thing: Where is our energy going to 
come from? We are told that we must 
dismantle the American oil and gas 
production to save the planet, but in 
2019, U.S. harmful emissions were 13 
percent less than they were in 2005. No 
other country has cut their footprint 
more in that short amount of time. 
And what is responsible for this? 
Well, it is not electric vehicles. It is 
not unreliable energy sources. It’s the 
American shale revolution. Clean-burn-
ing natural gas is critical in allowing 
us to achieve affordable, reliable en-
ergy supply without the harmful emis-
sions and the increases like we see 
from major polluters like Russia and 
China. But instead of building on that 
progress, President Biden and Demo-
crats are crippling the American en-
ergy sector and emboldening our for-
eign adversaries. 
I am proud to represent the men and 
women of the Permian Basin and the 
job that they do to keep the lights on 
to make sure that we have that afford-
able, reliable energy, and that it is run-
ning every single day. 
It is time to put Midland over Mos-
cow. Any vote for reconciliation might 
as well be a vote for Russia. I am urg-
ing my colleagues to vote ‘‘no.’’ 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I thank my friend. Midland 
over Moscow, we ought to print T- 
shirts with that one. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Tennessee 
(Mr. 
BURCHETT), where they are deeply con-
cerned about this as well. 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Vice Chairman JOHNSON
for 
yielding to me and the adequate job 
that he is doing. 
Madam Speaker, I recently overheard 
some East Tennesseans talking at the 
gas pumps at the local Pilot station. 
And a fellow said, it is almost like 
these politicians want to make gas 
more expensive. Well, I think my con-
stituents are on to something. 
Conversations like this one I have 
heard at my local Pilot station have 
been happening everywhere all across 
this country. Americans are so dis-
pleased with gas prices, they are slap-
ping these Biden ‘‘I did that’’ stickers 
on the pumps. I don’t recommend doing 
that, but it seems to me somebody is 
taking the initiative to do it. 
Madam Speaker, Joe Biden’s war 
against affordable energy is hurting 
millions of Americans’ ability to trav-
el. Commutes to work, family road 
trips, trips to the park, airline travel— 
all are soaring in costs. The White 
House lacks any and all sympathy for 
what this crisis means for working 
Americans. 
Joe Biden’s Energy Secretary even 
laughed when asked how her depart-
ment planned to stabilize gas prices. I 
thought that was the ultimate act of 
arrogance. It is the ‘‘let them eat cake 
too’’ kind of thing. 
I guess this is easy for Joe Biden and 
his Cabinet to ignore. American tax-
payers fund all their travel in those 
fancy private cars and jet airplanes 
they fly around in. Their attitude is in-
sulting and it is arrogant. No wonder 
Joe Biden is blind to what is going on. 
He never sees a bill for any of it, not a 
doggone bit. 
The holiday season is right around 
the corner, people will be celebrating 
Hanukkah and Christmas, and I predict 
holiday travel this year will be the 
most expensive on record. Americans 
will have Joe Biden’s war on affordable 
energy to thank for their enormous 
travel expenses. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman 
JOHNSON for the adequate work he is 
doing. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman’s 
adequate comments. And I will tell the 
gentleman that they are going to have 
to amend and print new stickers for 
the gas pumps because if our Democrat 
colleagues vote for this monstrosity, 
they are going to have to make a new 
sticker that says, ‘‘I and the House 
Democrats did that.’’ That is what is 
going down. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. HICE). 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Madam Speak-
er, the House Democrats have done 
this. It is all one big party. And while 
we are going to be celebrating Thanks-
giving next week, families gather to-
gether giving thanks, I am absolutely 
confident there will not be one family 
in America giving thanks for the eco-
nomic crisis created by President Joe 
Biden and the Democrats—the crisis, 
economically, that they are serving the 
American people. 
According to the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture, this is going to be the 
most expensive Thanksgiving in his-
tory. From turkey to potatoes, pump-
kin pie—you name it—this is going to 
be the most expensive Thanksgiving 
ever; probably a whole lot fewer second 
trips for food, or thirds, or whatever 
your family is accustomed to. 
Meanwhile, what is the answer that 
our Democrat friends are giving us? 
Democrats here in Washington have a 
great solution: Let’s spend trillions of 
more dollars. Let’s make inflation go 
up even more. Let’s put more pain and 
suffering around the Thanksgiving ta-
bles and the pocketbooks of the Amer-
ican 
people. 
While 
Americans 
are 
pinching their pennies, literally, to 
live within their means, President 
Biden and his socialist cronies from the 
other side of the aisle here in Wash-
ington are wanting to spend even more 
of the hard-earned money of the Amer-
ican taxpayer and the American work-
er. 
b 1715 
The Democrat socialist gravy train 
has left the station, and the American 
people, I assure you, are not at the 
table. They are not on board with what 
is happening in this country. 
Americans are the ones paying the 
price for this. They are paying the 
price for President Biden’s budget- 
busting policies—more money at the 
gas pumps, more money at the Thanks-
giving table this year, more money for 
everyday goods. We can go down the 
list. 
It is high time—it is past time—that 
President Biden and the Democrats 
stop this reckless, runaway spending. 
Our economy cannot afford trillions 
more dollars that we don’t have for un-
necessary spending for socialist, Marx-
ist spending, robbing us not only of our 
hard-earned income but our liberties, 
our freedoms that we love and cherish 
in this country. 
It is time that we put a stop to this 
nonsense. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, that voice from Georgia is so

strong. I think we are going to stick 
with that theme. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. CLYDE). 
Mr. CLYDE. Madam Speaker, too 
many falsehoods have been spread 
about the Democrats’ multitrillion- 
dollar tax and spend bill, the most rad-
ical and expensive piece of legislation 
in our history. 
The American people deserve to 
know the truth about the grave rami-
fications of passing this fiscally irre-
sponsible liberal wish list. 
Let’s unpack some of these egregious 
Pinocchios. 
For starters, the left has erroneously 
claimed that the so-called Build Back 
Better Act is fully paid for and will 
cost American taxpayers zero dollars. 
This is false. 
While we have not yet received the 
official CBO score, models show that 
Biden’s 
Big 
Government 
socialist 
spending package should cost more 
than double what Democrats have pre-
viously reported. The number could be 
upward of $4.5 trillion, with $3 trillion 
of it being in new debt. 
Additionally, President Biden has 
touted for months that this legislation 
will not raise taxes on Americans earn-
ing less than $400,000 a year. According 
to early reports from the Congressional 
Budget Office, this is completely false 
as well. 
A recent analysis from the Tax Pol-
icy Center found that the reckless rec-
onciliation bill would hike taxes for 20 
to 30 percent of middle-class families 
next year, yet taxpayers in the top 5 
percent will see a combined total tax 
cut of $32 billion. What a slap in the 
face to millions of small businesses, 
hardworking employees, and their fam-
ilies. 
Lastly, the President and his Demo-
crat allies have absurdly stated that 
passing their pricey package will help 
ease inflation. Ease inflation? Really? 
This is completely illogical and defies 
all reason unless, of course, your intent 
is to deceive. 
Injecting trillions of dollars of bor-
rowed Federal money into the econ-
omy, with billions of it going to cli-
mate change, will only worsen the al-
ready burdensome effects of record- 
high inflation. The result will be Amer-
icans struggling to afford gas, gro-
ceries, and heating bills. 
Keep in mind, the sole intent of the 
Biden, Bernie bankruptcy act’s enor-
mous cost is to fund unpopular and 
radical policies, such as taxpayer-fund-
ed abortion, weaponizing the IRS, and 
mass amnesty for illegal migrants. Oh, 
and don’t forget about the 150-plus new 
government programs that will further 
expand the Federal Government’s size 
and scope. 
Simply put, the unfortunate truth is 
that by ramming through their Big 
Government socialist spending spree, 
Democrats are selfishly prioritizing 
their dangerous, far-left agenda over 
the needs of the American people. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
Alabama (Mr. MOORE). 
Mr. MOORE of Alabama. Madam 
Speaker, I appreciate your leadership 
on this. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today alarmed 
by the unprecedented wasteful spend-
ing from Washington that is fueling in-
flation and risking the future of our 
Republic. 
Last week, this Congress passed a $1.2 
trillion infrastructure bill. Despite the 
bill’s characterization, less than 10 per-
cent went to traditional—what us 
southerners and commonsense people 
call roads and bridges. But $200 million 
went back to a park in Speaker 
PELOSI’s own backyard. 
According to The New York Times, 
certainly not an ally of the Repub-
licans, the Democrats’ reconciliation 
bill before us this week includes a $4.1 
billion tax break for people who buy 
electric bicycles; $2.5 billion for tree 
equity—I am not sure what that is; and 
another $2.5 billion to help contingency 
fee lawyers recoup expenses. 
Madam Speaker, this captures ex-
actly what is wrong with Washington. 
Too many politicians up here will glad-
ly endorse trillions in new spending for 
a few pennies of pork to come back to 
their district. They put their political 
futures above our own Nation. 
Well, I am sick of it, and the Amer-
ican people are, too. Congress is bleed-
ing the American people dry with 
waste and pet projects it claims is 
being spent in their own best interests. 
Sure, I would love for the Federal 
Government to build a new road in my 
district, but I refuse to sacrifice the 
health and viability of this Nation to 
get it. Most patriotic Americans would 
agree with me. 
Roads and bridges come and go, but if 
we foolishly squander the Nation our 
forefathers fought so hard to create, we 
will selfishly allow this great Amer-
ican experiment to die because of our 
own greed. Shame on us because we 
will have ultimately failed those who 
elected us and sent us here to protect 
their best interests. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. CARTER). 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, the spending spree continues 
this week as Democrats continue to try 
to ram their ridiculous reconciliation 
bill down our throats. 
The radicals have been back-seat 
driving far too long. Our holiday cheer 
is now being threatened by this admin-
istration’s refusal to cut up the credit 
cards. It is truly astonishing. 
We are all set to experience the most 
expensive Thanksgiving in our coun-
try’s history, thanks to these reckless 
spending habits perpetrated by the 
White House. Turkey prices are up 27 
percent. Potatoes are up 13 percent. 
Carrots are up 47 percent. The beloved 
pumpkin pie from Costco is up 17 per-
cent. 
The Consumer Price Index is up 6.2 
percent overall. This is an indicator of 
how much extra people are having to 
pay for their goods. 
In addition, natural gas is up 40 per-
cent, and home heating oil is up 60 per-
cent. Americans are being forced to 
pay more to heat their homes at a time 
when the weather is at its coldest. No-
where in America should hardworking 
taxpayers have to choose between heat-
ing their home and putting food on the 
table. 
These 
are 
not 
pandemic-related 
issues anymore. They are government- 
created issues. This is what socialism 
looks like. Joe Biden says: Get used to 
it. 
Empty shelves, runaway inflation, 
and 
government 
control—this 
no 
longer looks like America. It looks like 
a failed socialist nation. That is what 
it looks like. 
We will not cave to the desires of the 
far left. We will push back. America 
will remain free, and we will prevail. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I thank Mr. CARTER for that 
optimistic close. As Ronald Reagan 
said, we are the ‘‘last best hope of man 
on Earth.’’ We better hold it. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Illinois (Mrs. MILLER). 
Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, the only thing President 
Biden, Speaker PELOSI, and the Demo-
crats in Congress will be building back 
better is China’s economy. Truly, they 
are building Beijing back better. 
A new report released today shows 
that China has officially surpassed the 
U.S. as the richest nation in the world 
because Congress gave China most fa-
vored nation status under the Clinton 
administration. They have definitely 
tipped the scales for Chinese manufac-
turing. 
D.C. politicians themselves have been 
enriched off of China, while the Amer-
ican middle class suffers. Now Demo-
crats are pushing the Green New Deal 
policies that will make the middle 
class suffer even more with higher gas 
prices and home heating bills this win-
ter. 
Biden’s policies enrich China because 
they manufacture solar panels, lithium 
batteries, and windmills, and taxpayers 
are going to be forced to subsidize this. 
China mines these minerals for bat-
teries and solar panels with child labor 
and slave labor. When asked about the 
slave labor behind the Green New Deal, 
John Kerry said it was ‘‘not my lane.’’ 
That is despicable. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I thank my friend. It is a 
shame that China is being assisted by 
these Democrat policies, even as they 
openly challenge us. Another thing 
Ronald Reagan warned us about is that 
weakness invites aggression. This is a 
dangerous game. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Oregon (Mr. BENTZ). 
Mr. BENTZ. Madam Speaker, Amer-
ican families and businesses across our 
country are facing a crisis, a crisis of 
inflation, the likes of which we have 
not seen for more than 30 years. Last 
month, the Consumer Price Index hit a 
30-year high.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE

November 17, 2021 
What does this mean for everyday 
Americans? Gas prices are up 50 per-
cent from last year. Food prices are 
rising to the highest level in 12 years. 
The price of eggs is up 42 percent. The 
price of milk is up 17 percent. The price 
of a new car is up $5,000. Home prices 
are going through the roof. 
Last week, I met with farmers and 
ranchers in central Oregon who are 
paying far more for fertilizer, feed, 
fuel, herbicides, and all crop inputs. 
This is on top of the incredible difficul-
ties caused by historic drought, supply 
chain 
disruptions, and a shocking 
shortage of labor. 
Given all this, what are President 
Biden and Speaker PELOSI doing to ad-
dress the biggest inflationary spike in 
decades? Well, they have no plan ex-
cept to spend even more trillions of our 
tax dollars on more and probably irre-
versible welfare programs. 
The $2 trillion spending bill would 
raise taxes, increase our national debt, 
and drive inflation even higher. Sadly, 
American families will pay for this bill 
one way or another—but most imme-
diately, right now, through inflated 
prices on everything from diesel fuel to 
the Thanksgiving turkey. 
The $2 trillion Build Back Better bill 
is on top of the $1.9 trillion spent in 
March and the $1.2 trillion spent a few 
weeks ago. Even former officials from 
the Obama administration have warned 
that these unprecedented levels of 
spending will result in higher inflation. 
American farmers are now warning 
that this spending bill could result in 
the demise of many family farms and 
ranches. 
Spending trillions upon trillions of 
dollars will cause more crippling infla-
tion for American families and busi-
nesses. This radical reconciliation bill 
would not help us build back better. In-
stead, it will damage my State and our 
Nation for generations to come. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, it will damage all of our 
States. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Tennessee (Mr. KUSTOFF). 
Mr. KUSTOFF. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend from Louisiana for ar-
ranging the time to talk to the Nation 
today about these very important 
issues. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to talk 
about the reckless spending plans put 
forward by Democrats, which I think, 
without a doubt, have put our country 
in a real economic crisis. 
Let me take you back to March 
when, along purely partisan lines, 
Democrats pushed through a $1.9 tril-
lion spending plan. Just 2 weeks ago, 
Democrats pushed through another $1.2 
trillion in spending. This week, we may 
likely vote on the Democrats’ social 
spending plan, which would drive the 
total spending to almost $5 trillion 
when you add together all three of 
these spending bills. 
Now, if you will focus for a moment 
on the runaway inflation that has real-
ly been exacerbated and inflamed by 
this massive spending, it was reported 
just last week that the Consumer Price 
Index, which measures this data, rose 
over 6 percent. That is the highest 
level in 30 years. 
This means that the price of every-
day goods has skyrocketed. I am talk-
ing about everything: cars, appliances, 
food, gas. Estimates are that the price 
to heat your home this winter could be 
54 percent higher this year compared to 
last winter. Americans—our constitu-
ents—are getting hit really hard finan-
cially, and there is no end to it in 
sight. 
Without a doubt, the huge social 
spending bill that we may vote on this 
week will leave severe and long-lasting 
consequences. 
Madam Speaker, I want to point you 
to a story that ran yesterday in The 
Washington Times. Here is the head-
line: ‘‘Biden’s social welfare bill breaks 
pledge to not raise taxes on people 
making less than $400,000.’’ The news-
paper cites the Joint Committee on 
Taxation. 
b 1730 
Now, here is the deal: with the social 
spending bill beginning in 2023, tax-
payers making between $50,000 and 
$75,000 annually would see a tax in-
crease. For people earning between 
$75,000 and $100,000 a year, the tax in-
crease is 2.9 percent. Folks making be-
tween $100,000 and $200,000 per year 
would see a tax increase of 7.4 percent 
in 2023. 
Madam Speaker, let’s listen to our 
constituents. Let’s focus on the real- 
world problems that they are dealing 
with every day and that they talk to us 
about. Let’s work on the supply chain. 
Let’s focus on the threat from China. 
Let’s stop this massive spending. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I thank my friend for pros-
ecuting the case. That was his back-
ground. 
Madam Speaker, may I inquire how 
much time is remaining in the hour. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has 201⁄2 minutes remaining. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman 
from Oklahoma (Mrs. BICE). 
Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to address the 
record-breaking 
inflation 
that 
will 
make next Thursday the most expen-
sive Thanksgiving in history due to 
Biden’s and Democrats’ detrimental 
policy decisions. The American people 
will feel the impact of rising inflation 
this Thanksgiving and holiday season. 
Prices of ingredients for the tradi-
tional Thanksgiving dinner are sky- 
high, with turkey costs up 27 percent, 
pumpkin pie up 17 percent, and carrots 
up 47 percent. Beyond the pricey meal, 
travel costs are surging because a gal-
lon of gas costs 61 percent more than a 
year ago and airfare is expected to in-
crease 18 percent, placing a burden on 
families to visit loved ones for the holi-
days. On top of this, simply staying 
warm this winter will cost more. Heat-
ing bills are projected to rise as much 
as 54 percent compared to last winter. 
While these everyday prices are sky-
rocketing, wages are stagnant, which 
means decreased purchasing power for 
hardworking Americans. Not only will 
they have less money to spend on 
Thanksgiving traditions and holiday 
gifts that will have a damaging impact 
on our small businesses and our overall 
economy, but the livelihoods of Ameri-
cans will be harmed by the difficulty to 
afford day-to-day necessities. 
Madam Speaker, Biden’s failed poli-
cies 
are 
hitting 
home. 
As 
shown 
through the significant drop in his ap-
proval rating, Americans are desperate 
for a solution to fix these insane price 
increases. 
Instead, what is Biden’s response? 
Continue to push the partisan rec-
onciliation bill that would pump the 
economy with trillions more dollars in 
spending for social programs that are 
not paid for, further exacerbating this 
inflation crisis and causing American 
taxpayers to suffer the effects for gen-
erations to come. 
There are grave consequences to 
careless actions. I urge my colleagues 
and the American people to recognize 
this Thanksgiving as a direct result of 
excessive government spending and 
shutting down our country’s energy 
production. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. The gen-
tlewoman has said it very well. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Wisconsin 
(Mr. 
GROTHMAN). 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
would like one more time to address 
the reconciliation package. We know 
that it is a very large spending package 
and will result in more welfare and, in-
evitably, we will have to have more 
taxes which will put a damper on the 
economy. 
But let’s look at the type of vision 
that the Democratic Party has for our 
country given what they are spending 
the money on. We know we have a big, 
illegal immigration crisis in this coun-
try—everybody knows 8,000 people in 
the country last July, 105,000 this July. 
What are we going to do with it? 
We have record amounts of fentanyl 
coming across the southern border. We 
respond with a provision giving 7 mil-
lion people a path to amnesty which is 
a magnet to get more people here. We 
make it more difficult to remove peo-
ple from the country if they commit 
crimes, including sex offenses and fire-
arm convictions without any discretion 
from DHS. So, Madam Speaker, you 
want to make it more difficult to get 
even the criminal element out of the 
country. 
But, finally, we promised anybody 
coming into the country free college. 
Pell grants that are designed for poor 
Americans are going to go to people 
who come here illegally. We want the 
average American to sit there at home 
paying $30,000 or $40,000 tuition, in debt 
until they are 30 or 40 years old, but if 
you come here illegally, boom, free col-
lege.

November 17, 2021 
The second thing we get out of here 
is a new welfare problem in this coun-
try. We are encouraging people not to 
work. We are encouraging people not to 
get married. 
How do they respond? 
Look at the recent increase in food 
stamp benefits, the massive amount of 
money going to low-income housing, 
the increase in the earned income tax 
credit, and the larger Pell grants. Ev-
erywhere you look in this bill, Madam 
Speaker, is more money for people of a 
certain lifestyle at the expense of the 
person who is getting married and 
working harder. 
Race preferences are throughout this 
bill. It seems like they are incapable of 
doing a program that benefits all 
Americans. 
It 
is 
always 
targeting 
somebody from this race or that race 
or this gender or that gender. It is a 
very divisive bill. 
There is a great increase in govern-
ment’s role in raising children. It is the 
government that pays for all the 3- and 
4-year-old kids. It is kind of the oppo-
site of what America is supposed to be 
where the child’s upbringing is family 
centered. Now we want to make the 
child’s upbringing government cen-
tered. 
Finally, it creates more of a surveil-
lance state. There are 87,000 new IRS 
agents. 
What could they possibly do? 
But, obviously, Madam Speaker, you 
can see where we are headed as a coun-
try. At a time when our factories and 
farms can’t find anybody to work, we 
are going to take unemployed people 
and make them IRS agents. 
In any event, I urge Americans to 
pay attention to where the money is 
going in this bill because it is the type 
of America our forefathers never would 
have imagined. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. I thank 
my friend for his common sense. We 
will continue with that theme. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Indiana (Mr. BAIRD). 
Mr. BAIRD. Madam Speaker, I want 
to thank my colleague for giving me 
the opportunity to speak. 
Madam Speaker, at a time when 
Americans are facing the highest infla-
tion rates in decades and small busi-
nesses are struggling to recover from 
the devastating impact of COVID–19, 
House Democrats will soon consider 
the most radical spending package in 
American history. 
Unfortunately, instead of giving fam-
ilies and businesses a hand up by get-
ting able-bodied Americans back to 
work and taking steps to resolve our 
supply chain crisis, Democrats’ far left 
socialist package will do little more 
than exacerbate our inflation crisis and 
harm the growth of small businesses. 
Earlier this month the University of 
Pennsylvania’s 
Wharton 
School 
of 
Business released a model that found 
the bill will cost more than twice the 
estimated cost. If that is not bad 
enough, the Tax Policy Center recently 
found that this spending spree would 
raise taxes on middle-class Americans 
by up to 30 percent. 
This anti-growth package will de-
stroy thousands of jobs, burden many 
business owners with restrictive taxes 
intended to help pay for this bloated 
spending bill, and will surely be a 
death knell for many businesses on 
struggling 
Main 
Street 
and 
hard-
working Americans struggling to con-
tend with soaring inflation rates. 
Month after month we have watched 
the Biden administration deliver dis-
appointing jobs reports with the labor 
force participation rate falling to 61.6 
percent in September alone. This labor 
shortage is only fueling our economy 
and supply chain crisis, but instead of 
encouraging Americans to get back to 
work, 
President 
Biden 
and 
House 
Democrats are including provisions 
that discourage unemployed Americans 
from finding a job. 
If Democrats really want to build 
back better, they should be cham-
pioning policies that actually help our 
small business owners and the middle 
class, not exacerbating the problems 
they are struggling to overcome. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Any 
time a Bronze Star and Purple Heart 
recipient speaks, we ought to listen. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Virginia (Mr. CLINE.) 
Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, I want 
to thank my friend for yielding and for 
sponsoring 
this 
evening’s 
Special 
Order. 
Madam Speaker, this week the Labor 
Department’s consumer price index 
jumped 6.2 percent in October from a 
year earlier, reflecting an increase in 
the cost of goods and services as well 
as energy and food. Fuel costs surged 
30 percent. 
I have a quote from someone here in 
Washington about that. This politician 
said, ‘‘By all accounts, the threat posed 
by record inflation to the American 
people is not transitory and is instead 
getting worse. From the grocery store 
to the gas pump, Americans know the 
inflation tax is real and DC can no 
longer ignore the economic pain Amer-
icans feel every day.’’ 
Now, that wasn’t my colleague, Con-
gressman JOHNSON. That wasn’t Minor-
ity Leader KEVIN MCCARTHY or Con-
gressman JIM JORDAN. No. That was 
Senator JOE MANCHIN who said that 
just today. He is recognizing that not 
just West Virginians, but all Ameri-
cans are feeling the pain at the pump, 
at the grocery store, and all across the 
economy. 
It is coming from legislation that our 
President pushed earlier this year and 
that House Democrats helped get be-
hind—the so-called American Rescue 
Plan. No less than our President him-
self said this about public frustration, 
‘‘And people are feeling it. They’re 
feeling it. Did you ever think you’d be 
paying this much for a gallon of gas? In 
some parts of California, they’re pay-
ing $4.50 a gallon. 
‘‘That’s why it’s so important that 
we do everything in our power to sta-
bilize the supply chain.’’ 
But what he did through passage of 
this American Rescue Plan is actually 
cause inflation to jump that much fur-
ther forward, and he conceded on 
Wednesday that inflation is at a three- 
decade high because people have more 
money now as a result of the $1.9 tril-
lion stimulus legislation. 
And what has he proposed to do now? 
Double down and spend an additional 
$2 trillion. 
What does he think that will do to 
inflation 
in 
this 
country, 
Madam 
Speaker? 
He has already said, ‘‘And the irony 
is: People have more money now be-
cause of the first major piece of legisla-
tion I passed. You all got checks for 
$1,400. You got checks for a whole 
range of things. . . . It changes people’s 
lives. 
‘‘But what happens if there’s nothing 
to buy and you got more money? . . . It 
creates a real problem.’’ 
He did say that, and it did create a 
real problem. It creates a problem to 
the tune of inflation rates at a 30-year 
high and gas prices up 61 percent from 
last year. 
So if the President recognizes that 
his last multitrillion-dollar bill caused 
the economics peril we are facing, then 
why is he proposing spending an addi-
tional $2 trillion on social programs we 
don’t need and we can’t afford—150 new 
government programs? 
Propping up the Green New Deal 
won’t 
solve 
the 
economic 
crisis. 
Weaponizing the IRS against Ameri-
cans won’t lower inflation. Taxing mid-
dle-class 
families 
won’t 
put 
more 
money in the people’s pockets. 
Do you know what would actually 
help get this country’s economy back 
on track, Madam Speaker? 
Fiscal 
responsibility. 
Americans 
want a Thanksgiving meal that won’t 
be the most expensive in the history of 
the holiday, not a progressive wish list 
that will only make the situation 
worse. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. We are 
going to feel the pain. My friend is ex-
actly right. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. SESSIONS). 
Mr. SESSIONS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Congressman JOHNSON for this 
opportunity. 
Madam Speaker, we are here to talk 
to the American people about ideas 
that roam across our Nation. They are 
conversations that take place around 
every table, and next week at Thanks-
giving we will have those conversations 
at my table and others around the 
country. 
Madam Speaker, you just heard a 
good discussion about inflation. But 
part of inflation comes from govern-
ment spending, and part of government 
spending comes from policy that this 
President and this administration’s 
Democratic Party supports. 
Madam Speaker, 1.6 million people 
have come to our borders and come 
across, and we are doing things that 
will encourage them to come here. We

are doing things that will encourage 
them when we give them free edu-
cation, free healthcare and to pay for 
them to do those things. 
b 1745 
So, Madam Speaker, tonight we want 
to speak specifically about this thing 
that is called inflation. Inflation is re-
lated to Federal monetary and fiscal 
policy. Inflation is that thing that oc-
curs in the economy when the price of 
goods and services rise and rise expo-
nentially. 
Normally, an administration would 
look at about a 2 percent growth, a 2 
percent inflation rate, which would be, 
generally 
speaking, 
an 
acceptable 
growth for a GDP model as well as in-
flation rate. 
This administration, however, began 
with President Biden going down and 
visiting the king of inflation, former 
President Jimmy Carter, talking to 
this Nation about how great Jimmy 
Carter’s service was. Well what he real-
ly meant to say was I admired his poli-
cies, progressive liberal policies that 
took this country to have 16 and 18 per-
cent interest rates, interest rates that 
raised prices an excessive amount of 
money for families for a generation 
that could not buy homes. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
the 
Republican 
Party is here speaking, just as the 
American people are, and we recognize 
that this administration has made dear 
and great friends with the conditions 
that create inflationary spiral. 
This administration knows exactly— 
they have smart people there, but it is 
their policies that they demand to 
have, and those policies bring about re-
sults that end up making friends with 
inflation: Higher prices for goods and 
services; more government spending. 
This 
is 
big 
expensive 
government 
spending across the board. 
And so the American people will have 
the most expensive Thanksgiving in 
years; the highest inflation rate in 30 
years. Oh, that would be back to 
Jimmy Carter. No wonder President 
Biden visited his favorite—or second 
favorite President, Jimmy Carter, be-
cause he wants to make friends with 
the conditions that create inflation: 
Big government spending, prices rising, 
government control of the goods and 
services. 
And just like Jimmy Carter, he had a 
Senate, a House, and a Presidency to 
be very successful. 
Madam Speaker, the American peo-
ple spoke again last night in local elec-
tions down in South Carolina. They 
spoke a week ago in State elections. 
Madam Speaker, the American peo-
ple deserve better. Better comes from 
policy, and better comes from adults 
who will recognize that it is not just 
politics, it is about the American peo-
ple who want and need to have more 
take-home pay and more ability to 
take care of themselves; not big, expen-
sive socialist government that even 
breaks the laws of this country. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman for his service to this con-
ference but, more importantly, for 
making sure that the American people 
hear the other side of the story. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, that was so well said, and the 
American people are going to speak 
again next fall; we know that for cer-
tain. 
Madam Speaker, I am happy to yield 
to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. 
CLYDE). 
Mr. CLYDE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and service of 
Jackson County Deputy Lena Mar-
shall, whose picture is displayed beside 
me right here. 
Last week, Jackson County lost a 
mother and a heroic law enforcement 
officer. After responding to a domestic 
call that spiraled into a violent shoot-
out, Deputy Marshall tragically lost 
her life while serving to keep Geor-
gians in our community safe. 
While I never had the privilege of 
meeting Deputy Marshall personally, I 
am deeply moved by her immeasurable 
sacrifice and willingness to put Geor-
gians’ safety above her own. 
As a resident of Jackson County my-
self, I believe I can speak for all of us 
in the county in saying that we are for-
ever thankful for Deputy Marshall’s 
dedication, her service, and her brav-
ery. 
My wife, Jennifer, and I continue to 
pray for Lena’s family and for her fel-
low Jackson County officers during 
this difficult time. 
May God bless our men and women in 
blue who selflessly put their lives on 
the line every day to keep us safe. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. LAMALFA). 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I 
rise tonight as we talk about this issue 
with our upcoming Thanksgiving holi-
day, expected, of course, to be the most 
expensive meal in the history of that 
holiday. 
This is more proof that the Demo-
crats are driving up inflation with 
their spending policies. Spending piles 
of dollars does not create an economy, 
it actually hurts the value of the dol-
lars. 
USDA’s Turkey Market News Report 
showed the price of turkey itself is 
going to be up 22 percent from last 
year. Pumpkin pie, potatoes, cran-
berries, all up in price. 
Inflation, of course, is the most re-
gressive of actual taxes on the people 
because it hits those on a fixed income 
the hardest. Low and middle-income 
have tough decisions to make on 
whether it is going to be—how they are 
going to handle their food costs and up-
coming heating oil and gas to stay 
warm this winter. 
Democrats have been touting that 
they will tax billionaires and the rich 
and corporations but, instead, we have 
seen them advocating for policies that 
lead to inflation, directly harming 
those low and middle-income Ameri-
cans, as well as making tax breaks for 
the rich while they are touting them. 
Congress cannot spend its way out of 
a problem, as some in the administra-
tion have suggested. It would only 
make the issue worse. 
We must stop passing massive spend-
ing bills and, instead, work on the bur-
densome regulations and get out of 
businesses way so they can thrive, ex-
pand their businesses, and hire employ-
ees. 
Indeed, we need to work on the im-
portant supply chain issues that are 
still clogging our ports, keeping our 
products from being exported, from ag-
riculture, all those things that need to 
be shipped out. Instead, we aren’t cut-
ting very good deals with China when 
they can just send their stuff over to 
us. 
So that would insulate our economy 
from inflation by having a real econ-
omy at home that is not dependent 
upon borrowed dollars for big spending. 
Indeed, I keep asking, Biden adminis-
tration, whose side are you on? 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, how much time is remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has 5 seconds remaining. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I thank my friends for par-
ticipating tonight, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
f 
PROGRESSIVE CAUCUS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentlewoman from 
New Mexico (Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ) is 
recognized for 60 minutes as the des-
ignee of the majority leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members have 5 legislative days to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the sub-
ject of my Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New Mexico? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, Monday was such an exciting 
day for our country. President Biden 
signed the Infrastructure Investment 
and Jobs Act into law, and we came 
one step closer toward making the nec-
essary investments to help our commu-
nities thrive; to help them thrive, not 
just survive. 
And I want to point out that, al-
though it is called the bipartisan infra-
structure act, we had very few Repub-
licans in this House vote for that bill. 
In my State, the Republican Congress-
woman did not vote for the infrastruc-
ture act; so she voted against the clean 
water. 
She 
voted 
against 
the 
broadband. She voted against the infra-
structure that we need to keep our 
roads safe and our bridges strong 
enough so that kids can cross them in 
their school buses to get to school. 
But the Democrats delivered that 
bill, and the Democrats are going to 
deliver the Build Back Better agenda.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6357 
November 17, 2021 
And the reason why we need to pass the 
Build Back Better Act, it is para la 
gente. It is for the people. It is for our 
communities. 
Just a few weeks ago, my Progressive 
Caucus colleagues and I held a Special 
Order hour dedicated to the many 
great things in the Build Back Better 
Act. But, there is so much in there that 
is good that we are back here tonight 
to continue to highlight the benefits 
for our communities. 
Madam Speaker, throughout the pan-
demic, New Mexicans lost their liveli-
hoods. They put savings toward just 
surviving. If it wouldn’t have been for 
the American Rescue Plan, they would 
have lost their homes. The eviction 
moratorium helped them. 
Housing—I want to talk a little bit 
about housing because that is some-
thing I have worked on for many, many 
years in my district. We know that 
housing instability and the shortage of 
affordable housing hurts our working 
families. 
Many saw their dreams of home own-
ership vanish with the pandemic and 
the recession. But, with Build Back 
Better, we have an opportunity to 
change that. We know that the biggest 
barrier to purchasing a home is the 
lack of savings needed for a downpay-
ment. People just don’t have $10,000 or 
$20,000 to put down on a downpayment. 
And current benefits like mortgage 
deductions don’t help low-income fami-
lies looking to buy a home. They don’t 
help middle-class families, because you 
need the money at the time you are 
buying the house, at closing. 
So, to successfully address the afford-
able housing shortage and the growing 
racial gap that comes along with it, we 
need to make sure there is access to 
home ownership, especially for commu-
nities like in New Mexico, or Native 
American, Latino, African American, 
Black, Indigenous communities, we 
need to make sure that we provide 
them with the homeownership assist-
ance when it is needed, which is at 
closing. 
And you know what? Build Back Bet-
ter does just that. It makes one of the 
largest investments in housing down-
payment assistance in history. 
I am proud to have been one of those 
many in our caucus who advocated for 
the $10 billion that is in Build Back 
Better to help first-generation home-
owners purchase their home. 
In my beautiful New Mexico, we are 
lucky to have an organization that I 
have worked with for 20 years. It is 
called Homewise, an organization that 
helps create successful homeowners so 
that families can improve their long- 
term financial wealth. We have finan-
cial fitness classes. We also help people 
with downpayment assistance. But we 
could use more of that. We never have 
enough downpayment assistance. 
But one of the people that we helped 
was Maria Luisa. Maria Luisa first 
came to the United States from Mex-
ico. She had a dream to own a home of 
her own and to create that better life 
for herself. She found that dream hard. 
She found herself living on the streets 
of Santa Fe, but she turned her life 
around. She got her GED. She got her 
residency, her green card. She took 
classes at the Santa Fe Community 
College in community health, and she 
found Homewise, and she found her 
first home with our help. 
She says that being a homeowner 
lifts her spirits and gives her con-
fidence in her own future. She knows 
that she will be able to pass along the 
savings that are incorporated into that 
home of her own to her children. 
Spirit and confidence in the future, 
that is what Democrats are about. We 
are about opportunity. We are about 
creating that belief in the future and 
making it possible for working fami-
lies. 
I am glad to be on the floor with my 
progressive colleagues to talk about 
the many opportunities that Build 
Back Better has. 
But I want to take a little moment 
right now and have us walk back a 
year. Thanksgiving. Do we remember 
what Thanksgiving was like a year 
ago? 
In my household, we always have a 
sit-down dinner for about 24 people. 
You know, we believe in those extended 
tables. And everybody comes. Some-
body will make the turkey, somebody 
else will make the green chili and the 
red chili, because you can’t do without 
red chili and green chili if you are from 
New Mexico. And everybody brings 
what they made with such love to the 
table, and we sit around together and 
share stories and share good food and 
laugh and tease. 
Last year, did we do that? No. Last 
year, we had a Zoom Thanksgiving. 
Last year, we were living in despair. 
We were living with our former Presi-
dent, who made fun of COVID. We were 
living with politicians from the other 
side of the aisle who called it a hoax. 
And we could not gather. We could not 
celebrate. 
What a difference a year makes. 
What a difference leadership makes. 
Under President Biden and the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan, we have made it pos-
sible for our families to gather to-
gether once again because we made 
sure that they didn’t get kicked out of 
their homes; that they had a place to 
invite their family too with the money 
that we put into rental assistance. 
We made sure that they could get 
that vaccination; that they could have 
those shots. And anybody who wants it 
in the United States can get a shot, 
can be vaccinated, can get their boost-
er, so that they protect everybody in 
their community. And that is what we 
need to celebrate, and that is what we 
need to respect because a year later, 
the American Rescue Plan has done so 
much for our communities. 
b 1800 
But, yes, it is true. As those on the 
other side of the aisle state, we are see-
ing inflation. But gas prices, who con-
trols gas prices? Oil and gas companies 
do. Who protects oil and gas compa-
nies? Republicans protect oil and gas 
companies. 
They 
protect 
those 
corporations. 
They do not let us attack their cor-
porations or tax those corporations. So 
Democrats have to do it themselves. 
We need to remember that it is 
greedy corporations that are raising 
the prices and profiting off of working 
families. 
We need to remember that it is 
Grubhub that is increasing the price of 
deliveries by 30 percent, and none of 
that is going back to the mom-and-pop 
restaurants. It is going to those cor-
porations that don’t want to pay taxes. 
But in the Build Back Better Act, we 
are going to make sure that corpora-
tions pay their fair share so they can 
stop fueling the inflation that the Re-
publicans protect. They are fueling the 
inflation, and Republicans are pro-
tecting those corporations. Let’s call it 
like it is. 
But right now, I want to go back to 
all the amazing things that are in the 
Build Back Better Act. I am going to 
call on our wonderful Representative 
WATSON COLEMAN, my colleague, who 
always stands ready to tell the stories 
of what it means on the ground in our 
community, for our people, from vi-
sions like Build Back Better. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. WAT-
SON COLEMAN). 
Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Madam 
Speaker, first of all, I thank Represent-
ative LEGER FERNANDEZ for managing 
this very important Special Order 
hour. I want to tell her and you, 
Madam Speaker, that I have been to-
tally inspired by my colleague’s com-
ments thus far on the benefits of the 
Build Back Better Act, on helping us to 
remember and to reimagine. 
I remember Thanksgiving as well. I 
come from a big family, and there are 
about 30 of us that get together. It 
didn’t happen last year. But because of 
this leadership out of this administra-
tion, the Democratic Caucus in this 
House and in the Senate, we were able 
to deliver resources so that people 
could get the things that they need to 
stay in their homes and get vaccinated. 
I, for one, am happy to say that my 
whole family is vaccinated, and we also 
have the booster, so we are going to get 
together for this Thanksgiving dinner. 
I am grateful to the visionary Presi-
dent, Joe Biden, for this. 
I am here tonight to speak about 
something that I am passionate about. 
I want you to know, Madam Speaker, 
that I am rising today because I feel 
that the way our country has treated 
working people has just been unaccept-
able. 
Billionaires pay a smaller share of 
their wealth in Federal taxes than the 
middle-class 
and 
the 
working-class 
people who built this country. 
Our system is antithetical to our 
country’s founding principles, and, yes, 
it is broken. Our country has failed its

people, and we must do better. We 
can’t do better, though, without build-
ing back better. 
Although the current bill does not in-
clude all that we had hoped it would, it 
is still going to transform the lives of 
those who need it most. 
For example, it will give working 
parents the freedom to raise their new-
born children and make a living. That 
is why Build Back Better extends the 
already extremely successful child tax 
credit 
expansion 
Democrats 
first 
passed in the American Rescue Plan 
earlier this year. 
It also incorporates my Healthy 
MOM Act to ensure new mothers have 
12 months of postpartum healthcare 
coverage so they are supported when 
they need it most. 
It will also make an unprecedented 
investment in putting floors beneath 
our feet and roofs above our heads. The 
Build Back Better Act includes $65 bil-
lion for safer, more accessible public 
housing. It also invests an additional 
$25 billion to construct and rehabili-
tate low-income family housing and 
another $9 billion for lead remediation 
to safeguard our children’s health. 
This bill also puts us back on the 
right path to prepare against the 
threat of climate change. It makes a 
historic 
$29 
billion 
investment 
in 
greenhouse gas reduction and $3 billion 
for climate justice block grants. It will 
also ban new offshore oil and gas leas-
ing along our coasts to create a clean-
er, brighter future where all of our 
children can thrive. 
Right now, the American Dream is 
just that, a dream, for far too many 
people. Building back better is a cru-
cial step toward making that dream a 
reality. 
Since our Nation’s founding, working 
Americans have paid more than their 
fair share. It is time we finally reward 
them. 
Today’s Build Back Better Act is not 
the bill we had in mind when the Presi-
dent first announced his agenda, but 
we are still on the verge of making the 
biggest investment in working Amer-
ican families in more than half a cen-
tury. 
I am very proud of that. We all ought 
to be very proud of that. We ought to 
be proud that we can work hard. We 
stood together; we fought together; and 
together, we can make it happen. 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, New Jersey is so lucky to 
have Representative WATSON COLEMAN 
because she knows what is needed on 
the ground. 
Yes, indeed, it is together, and that 
is what I like about our Caucus and 
what we are doing. We are doing it to-
gether. We are not about division. We 
are about unity. 
That is what we represent, right? Be-
cause we know that community work-
ing together, living together, and grow-
ing together is how we succeed in life. 
I want to raise another part of where 
Build Back Better is very important. I 
am chair of the Indigenous Peoples 
Subcommittee. I am so lucky to have 
the Jicarilla Apache Nation, the Nav-
ajo Nation, and 16 different Puebloan 
Tribes in my district. They tell me 
about their needs. I have walked in 
their villages. I have sat at their feast 
days. 
I know the pandemic hit them hard-
est of all. We saw the death and despair 
in our Tribal communities. So what we 
did in Congress, what we did in the 
Natural Resources Committee, was to 
make sure that their voices were 
heard. We provided $14 billion in the 
American Rescue Plan and another $12 
billion for their communities. 
We have been hearing lately about 
the incredible, sad stories that come 
from the fact that there was a time in 
America’s history when we took chil-
dren away from their Tribes, away 
from their culture, and we put them in 
boarding schools, and many died. We 
were trying to erase the savage Indian, 
and those were the words that were 
used. It didn’t work. The Tribes are 
alive and with us. We must respect 
that history. 
I am proud that both the American 
Rescue Plan and the Build Back Better 
Act have $200 million for Native Amer-
ican languages because it is through 
language that you preserve a culture 
and that you preserve an identity. 
Add that together with the fact that 
we are going to have $470 million for 
Tribal climate resilience because we 
have moved Tribes from their home-
lands and put them in places where 
they are at the greatest risk from the 
climate crisis. We include money for 
drought relief because they are at the 
greatest risk of thirst because of the 
droughts that will be caused. 
We have $2.3 billion for the Indian 
Health Service. This will help us ad-
dress the backlog. 1993 is when we 
started setting out the list of Indian 
Health Service buildings that needed 
repair, and we still have a 1993 list that 
we have not met. 
I am very proud of what we have 
done in Build Back Better to address 
the needs of our Native Americans and 
our urban Native Americans in our 
Tribes. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. 
PRESSLEY), my colleague in the Con-
gressional Progressive Caucus, a gen-
tlewoman but fierce and proud. 
Ms. PRESSLEY. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my dear and fierce colleague 
from New Mexico for convening us this 
evening. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today on be-
half of the communities in my district 
and across our Nation who for too long 
have been asked to wait, for those who 
have had their justice delayed, time 
and again, by inaction, obstruction, or 
the status quo. 
I rise today because I support the 
worker and their family, caregivers 
and childcare workers, parents and es-
sential frontline workers, our disabled 
siblings, 
our 
environmental 
justice 
communities, 
and 
our 
immigrant 
neighbors. 
For months, we held the line to en-
sure that we leave no family, no work-
er, and no community behind. I rise so 
that we can secure the strongest poli-
cies and investments for our most 
marginalized communities, to deliver 
meaningful, tangible change to im-
prove their conditions and to impact 
their daily lives. 
This week, the House has the oppor-
tunity and the obligation to legislate 
justice and begin rebuilding as a 
stronger, more just Nation that takes 
care of its people, not because it is 
good politics—I will let the pundits 
speak to that—but because as law-
makers we have a decisive mandate 
from the people to deliver policies and 
budgets that value the lives and liveli-
hoods of everyone in our communities. 
That means passing the President’s full 
agenda, which is the people’s agenda. 
I represent Massachusetts’ Seventh 
District, one of the most unequal dis-
tricts in the country and in the Com-
monwealth, where in a 3-mile radius, 
life expectancy drops from 92 years in 
Back Bay to 59 years in Roxbury, and 
the median household income drops by 
$50,000; where childcare costs remain 
some of the highest in the entire Na-
tion, $21,000 a child for center-based 
care; where the rising rates of asthma, 
extreme heat, and sea level rise dis-
proportionately impact frontline envi-
ronmental justice communities like 
Chinatown, East Boston, and Chelsea. 
The hurt and harm in my community 
run deep, and I see it every day. These 
inequities and disparities are not natu-
rally occurring. They are the direct re-
sult of decades of precise and inten-
tional policy violence and underinvest-
ment that has been codified into our 
laws and our budgets for generations. 
In this moment, as we do the work to 
build back better and do so equitably, 
we must be just as precise and just as 
intentional in legislating and investing 
in justice, equity, and healing. That is 
why we can’t afford to leave any work-
er, any family, or any community be-
hind. 
Madam Speaker, the Build Back Bet-
ter Act is our chance to chart a new 
path forward and reverse the genera-
tions of policy violence inflicted on our 
most vulnerable, to finally make uni-
versal paid leave a reality for the mil-
lions of workers, disproportionately 
Black and Brown women, who have 
been pushed out of the workforce, left 
to make the impossible choice between 
keeping food on the table or caring for 
themselves or a sick loved one; for the 
childcare worker taking care of our ba-
bies but can’t make enough to take 
care of their own; to finally invest in 
home- and community-based services 
for the elderly and disabled as the crit-
ical infrastructure that it is; to finally 
make affordable childcare and uni-
versal pre-K a reality; to combat cli-
mate change; to close the homeowner-
ship gap; to rebuild our crumbling 
housing stock; and finally to honor our 
promises to our immigrant neighbors. 
These investments are possible; they 
are popular; and they are necessary.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6359 
November 17, 2021 
We can wait no more. There is no def-
icit of resources in this country, only a 
deficit of empathy and political cour-
age. 
We must pass the Build Back Better 
Act this week and make the long-over-
due investments that our workers, 
families, and communities have been 
denied for too long. 
Our Nation is in crisis. The urgency 
could not be more clear. How we meet 
this moment will have lasting impacts, 
and history will remember us for it. 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, I think this reference to how 
history will judge us is important be-
cause we are facing a historical mo-
ment right now. The decisions we make 
on the floor of this House this week 
will determine whether our future is 
one that is inclusive and that includes 
every single family and community in 
this great Union of the United States 
or whether it continues to leave people 
behind. 
Right now, those who are being left 
behind include the vast majority of 
Americans. What we are doing with 
this legislation is creating the kind of 
opportunity, creating the kind of jobs 
so that everybody can come forward 
and thrive. 
b 1815 
We are focusing on women. This is a 
women’s agenda. The Build Back Bet-
ter Act is a women’s agenda because it 
is the women who had to drop out of 
the workforce to care for their children 
because there wasn’t enough childcare 
available or it was too expensive. 
In New Mexico, we just learned that 
almost 21 percent of the women in New 
Mexico dropped out of the workforce 
because 
they 
could 
not 
afford 
childcare. 
Build Back Better addresses that. It 
is going to make sure that no family 
pays more than 7 percent of their in-
come on childcare. That is the kind of 
agenda that every family wants, be-
cause they want to make sure that 
their children are cared for and are ei-
ther in a great childcare center or are 
in that pre-K that is so essential so 
that they can succeed later in life. 
We know that the science has shown 
us that if you have quality pre-K for 
your 3-year-olds, for your 4-year-olds, 
you are going to have a successful life, 
you are going to earn more in income, 
you are going to graduate from high 
school, you are going to earn addi-
tional degrees. It is going to be better. 
So we are taking the investments 
today and we will recoup the benefits 
12 years from now, 18 years from now. 
And that is believing in our future. We 
are investing in what we believe in. 
I also want to take a moment to ad-
dress the fact that this bill is fully paid 
for, so when anybody ever says that it 
is going to increase our deficit, know 
ye that it is not true what they say be-
cause this bill is fully paid for. 
It is paid for by making sure that tax 
cheats don’t get to cheat anymore. We 
are going to invest in the IRS so that 
they can audit and go after tax cheats. 
Who wants to defend tax cheats? Do 
you really want to be defending tax 
cheats? I hope not because everybody 
should pay their fair share. 
We are going to make sure that no-
body earning less than $400,000 a year 
pays any more in taxes. Indeed, this is 
one of the biggest tax cuts that we are 
doing for regular people. Not like the 
tax cut they passed in 2017 which bene-
fited only the wealthy and the corpora-
tions. This tax cut is a benefit to our 
working families, to our middle-class 
families. 
The child tax credit is available to 
all now. Everybody who is receiving 
that 
$300-per-child 
payment 
every 
month, that is going to continue be-
cause of the American Rescue Plan and 
because of Build Back Better. If any-
body says it is going to add to the debt, 
know that they are not speaking the 
truth. 
The other thing that Build Back Bet-
ter does is it has the biggest impact on 
addressing 
and 
combating 
climate 
change in American history. Anybody 
who has lived through this summer, 
through last winter, the storms, the 
climate disasters knows that it is not a 
hoax, as some have argued. 
Climate deniers have been proven 
wrong because we all witness what is 
happening with our climate. We all 
know that it will cost us billions and 
trillions of dollars if we do not act. 
In my beautiful New Mexico, if we do 
not act to combat the climate crisis, 
we will become an extension of the 
Sonoran Desert. I love my mountain 
streams. I love the snowfall that falls 
on our ski resorts and in our moun-
tains and trickles down to our rivers 
and provides us with the water we need 
for our farms and our fields and to 
quench our thirst. 
I love that snow. If we do not address 
the climate crisis, we will not see that 
snow in winters to come. We might not 
see it this winter. So I am very pleased 
at the investments that we are making 
to combat the climate crisis in the 
Build Back Better Act. 
The infrastructure bill also included 
some key provisions. It included provi-
sions for my Orphaned Well Cleanup 
and Jobs Act to plug orphaned wells 
and protect our communities from the 
dangerous methane they spew into the 
air. We know that methane is many 
times, 35 times more dangerous to our 
climate than carbon, and so it is im-
portant to plug up those orphaned 
wells that oil and gas companies have 
abandoned. Not all of them, but there 
are too many that have abandoned 
those wells, and they are called or-
phaned. They are spewing methane 
into the air right now. 
I visited one with our Labor Sec-
retary. It was right next door to a 
school. The methane that leaks from 
that abandoned and dirty well is 
breathed into the lungs of our stu-
dents. The infrastructure bill will help 
clean it up, but the Build Back Better 
bill will say we don’t want this to hap-
pen over and over again. 
Build Back Better says: You can’t 
walk away, oil and gas companies, you 
can’t walk away from those wells and 
leave the mess for the taxpayers to 
clean up. 
We asked the Interior Department to 
strengthen the bonding requirements 
so that the bonds cover the cost of 
cleaning them up. We also establish an 
idled-well fee so that oil and gas com-
panies don’t have and don’t let these 
wells just sit unattended. If you are 
not going to be pumping from the well, 
close it down. Don’t just let it spew 
methane into the air. 
I also helped secure $240 million for a 
Just Transition investment fund to 
create new economic opportunities in 
our energy communities. New Mexico 
relies on oil and gas for jobs and tax 
revenues. I am acutely aware of the 
benefits that this industry has brought 
to our State, but I am also acutely 
aware of the need to transition in a 
way that honors our communities and 
our workers who have worked in this 
industry, who have fueled our econ-
omy. 
We now need a transition to renew-
able energy and to a clean energy econ-
omy, but in that transition we cannot 
leave any worker behind. And so Build 
Back Better includes money to invest 
in those communities so we can see 
new businesses arise. It also includes 
money to invest in the workers so that 
if they need to gain new skills that we 
are there for them, that our commu-
nity colleges are there for them, that 
our apprenticeships are there for them. 
But many of the skills that we need, 
like cleaning up the orphaned wells, 
are the same skills that you would use 
in the industry itself. So we are going 
to be creating good-paying jobs, and we 
are making sure in the Build Back Bet-
ter plan that those jobs are union, if 
they want to be. We are making sure 
that we prioritize the jobs that pay 
well and that treat their workers well. 
We also are investing in a civilian 
climate corps. I am very proud to have 
had my first job in the conservation 
corps, the Youth Conservation Corps. 
It taught me that cleaning and pro-
tecting our environment is hard work. 
I went out there with my boots and my 
shovel and my pickaxe, and we helped 
create trails, and we helped clean up 
those trails. It taught me about work 
ethic, but it also taught me about the 
importance of caring for the land that 
we love. 
The civilian climate corps will do the 
same, but it will grow it. I have met 
with those who are engaged, like the 
Rocky Mountain Youth Corps. I give a 
shout-out to the Rocky Mountain 
Youth Corps because they are there 
managing our forests, working to pro-
tect our forests, and earning their de-
grees, starting new businesses coming 
from that experience in the climate 
corps, in the Rocky Mountain Youth 
Corps. 
We are going to be investing in thou-
sands and thousands of jobs for young 
people who will be able to go on and se-
cure education, if that is what they

want, or start a business, if that is 
what they want, from the skills that 
they will have learned from the cli-
mate corps. 
We also are going to be strengthening 
domestic manufacturing and the sup-
ply chains for critical goods because it 
is only when you address the root 
cause of the problems, which is our 
supply chains that you solve the prob-
lem. 
We want to bring back manufac-
turing to this continent, to this coun-
try. There are those who talk about it 
the same way they talked for years 
about 
infrastructure 
week, 
but 
it 
doesn’t help if all you do is talk about 
it. What you need to do is deliver. In 
the infrastructure plan, we are deliv-
ering to bring back the jobs that are 
needed to build those bridges. We are 
building that infrastructure. 
We are delivering because Democrats 
deliver. In Build Back Better, we are 
going to be delivering the jobs of the 
future. We are going to be delivering 
the investments in manufacturing. We 
are going to be delivering the invest-
ments so our consumers can realize the 
benefits so that they are paid more and 
can really have the respect that comes 
along with a job that has the kind of 
benefits you need. 
We are going to be delivering pre-
scription drug price negotiation. We 
are going to be delivering the lowering 
of healthcare costs because for too long 
we have had those who would stand for 
Big Pharma instead of for those who 
need insulin, those who need Humira, 
those who need the kinds of drugs that 
make their life bearable, those who 
need the kinds of drugs that allow 
them to survive. 
What we are doing in Build Back Bet-
ter is making sure that we can nego-
tiate to reduce those drug prices. That 
is something that we know Americans 
want. And so when we do not get a sin-
gle Republican vote for lowering drug 
prices, remember that, that Repub-
licans were unwilling to vote to lower 
drug prices because that is what this 
bill does. 
Remember that Republicans were un-
willing to vote for infrastructure, be-
cause that is what the infrastructure 
plan did. 
I am asking, however, that we re-
ceive those votes, that we receive bi-
partisan support for the kinds of in-
vestments that we are going to be 
doing for our people. 
I yield now to the gentleman from 
Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE), an amaz-
ing colleague in the Congressional Pro-
gressive Caucus, an amazing colleague 
from the Equality Caucus who has 
fought for the rights of all Americans. 
He has fought for the Equality Act. He 
is one of the drafters of the Equality 
Act. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding, 
and I appreciate the opportunity to 
speak about the President’s vision for 
really investing in working families in 
this country and doing it in a way, par-
ticularly after COVID, that the econ-
omy is rebuilt so that everyone has op-
portunities and that not only people at 
the top realize their full potential and 
reap all the benefits, but that everyone 
in this country can benefit from the 
economic recovery that the President 
has articulated in the Build Back Bet-
ter plan. 
I have been in Congress now 11 years. 
I don’t know that we have ever had a 
better example of what leadership from 
the President means in terms of under-
standing that the best way to grow the 
economy is to invest in working fami-
lies, to invest in middle-class families 
by making sure they can access all of 
the opportunities that exist in this 
country. 
And what are those struggles? Af-
fordable childcare, universal pre-K, job 
training, lowering prescription drug 
costs, lowering the cost of healthcare. 
When the President made his address 
to the joint session of Congress, what 
struck me in that speech was that 
President Biden identified virtually 
every single struggle I hear about from 
my constituents in Rhode Island—the 
high cost of prescription drugs, the 
high cost of healthcare, the high cost 
of childcare, the inability to access 
pre-K, difficulty retraining because of 
the absence of job training programs. 
It is as if the President put together 
everything I have heard that folks 
struggle with every day in this coun-
try, and he drafted and included all 
those in the Build Back Better provi-
sions. 
When you take the bipartisan infra-
structure bill along with the Build 
Back Better legislation which we are 
about to pass, we are going to create 
11⁄2 million jobs a year for a decade, and 
that is extraordinary. These are good- 
paying, union jobs. 
We are going to, for the first time, 
take on in a serious way the climate 
crisis. We are going to drive down costs 
of everything from prescription drugs 
to childcare to healthcare, and the best 
part about it is it is paid for by making 
sure the wealthiest people in this coun-
try and the most profitable corpora-
tions pay their fair share. My constitu-
ents pay their fair share. They expect 
everyone to do the same. 
And so we have this extraordinary in-
vestment in working families that is 
going to give people an opportunity, 
move so many of the obstacles that 
allow folks to return to the workforce, 
particularly women. Women were dev-
astated by the pandemic, particularly 
devastated. 
b 1830 
If we did the bipartisan infrastruc-
ture bill alone, a lot of that economic 
recovery would escape women in this 
country. The Build Back Better provi-
sions are going to ensure many of those 
obstacles that prevent women from re-
entering the workforce are addressed 
so that our economy can realize the 
full benefit of the extraordinary talent 
of women in the workforce. 
This economic recovery that we are 
all craving after 2 years of a very dif-
ficult time with this pandemic, that 
economic recovery is going to reach ev-
eryone in this country. It is going to 
begin with working families and mid-
dle-class families, who for the first 
time, I think, are going to be the focus 
of a very comprehensive strategy. 
I am excited. I feel particularly hon-
ored to be in Congress at this moment, 
and I thank the President for his lead-
ership in developing a plan to rebuild 
the middle class and address so many 
of the challenges that working families 
face. 
I thank you for giving me an oppor-
tunity to speak during this Special 
Order hour, and I look forward to the 
passage of Build Back Better and all it 
is going to mean for families in my 
State and all across this country. 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, I do love it when this Presi-
dent always says we are going to re-
build this economy from the bottom up 
and the middle out because that is ex-
actly who he is focused on. He is fo-
cused on giving us the opportunities, 
my constituents as well. 
You know, there could not be two 
States that are more different than 
Rhode Island and New Mexico, but 
these are the same things we hear in 
New Mexico. We are addressing those 
in Build Back Better, and I can’t be 
more excited as a freshman to be able 
to be here on the floor of the House and 
to vote for the American Rescue Plan 
because that really was the first step. 
The American Rescue Plan saved our 
economy. It saved families from home-
lessness. It lowered hunger. It ad-
dressed the pandemic by giving us the 
vaccine. 
The second step was the infrastruc-
ture bill. We talked earlier about how, 
last Thanksgiving, we were apart. This 
Thanksgiving, we are together because 
of the American Rescue Plan. 
But the infrastructure bill, that is 
about 
repairing 
our 
infrastructure, 
which has been too long ignored. 
Then this last one, Build Back Bet-
ter, I am just overjoyed that I get to 
serve in Congress in this historic mo-
ment to work on these things that will 
be benefiting my grandchildren and 
their grandchildren. I want to leave 
them with this beautiful place we call 
home intact. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6361 
November 17, 2021 
There was no objection. 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, I 
have said it before and I will say it 
again: The greatest threat that this 
pandemic has imposed on the American 
people is growing government control 
over their lives. 
A stalled supply chain, exploding in-
flation, and a crisis at our southern 
border are all issues that require im-
mediate attention. Yet, the Biden ad-
ministration is not addressing any of 
these issues. 
Instead, President Biden thinks it is 
a good idea to ignore the crisis he cre-
ated and impose a crushing Federal 
vaccine mandate on businesses that 
will affect more than 80 million Ameri-
cans and decimate our workforce. 
My colleagues and I have had enough 
with President Biden’s tone-deaf man-
dates. 
Today, I was joined by all 50 Repub-
lican Senators and 107 Members in the 
House in introducing a Congressional 
Review Act to nullify President Biden’s 
vaccine mandate on America’s workers 
and businesses. 
This mandate is illegal, and we are 
fighting to stop it. I am joined by my 
colleagues this evening to explain why 
we need to stop this. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Illinois (Mrs. MILLER). 
Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, I thank Representative KEL-
LER
for yielding. It has been great 
starting the day today in prayer for 
our country and now finishing with 
this Special Order. 
The Fifth Circuit blocking OSHA’s 
COVID mandate is a huge win for the 
American people, but Biden and the far 
left aren’t going to give up this power 
grab without a fight. 
This vaccine mandate would destroy 
what is left of our economy and make 
Americans less safe. 
We are forcing people to quit their 
jobs with unconstitutional mandates 
from an out-of-control Federal Govern-
ment. 
This mandate is causing the Amer-
ican people to be less safe by making 
firefighters, police officers, Border Pa-
trol, and nurses to choose between the 
jab or their job. 
If U.S. military members are dis-
charged, China and our adversaries 
stand to be the beneficiaries. 
Natural immunity is completely ig-
nored 
because 
natural 
immunity 
doesn’t have a lobbyist here in D.C. 
We cannot sit idly by while the gov-
ernment works to centralize the per-
sonal health information of Americans. 
Americans have the God-given right to 
the pursuit of happiness, and we will 
not bow to king Biden and his uncon-
stitutional edicts. 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Kansas 
(Mr. MANN). 
Mr. MANN. Madam Speaker, I thank 
Congressman KELLER for hosting this 
Special Order and for his hard work 
and leadership. 
I rise today with you and scores of 
our colleagues to call for congressional 
review of President Biden’s vaccine 
mandates. 
During his tenure in the White 
House, 
President 
Biden 
has 
cir-
cumvented this Congress to issue mul-
tiple executive orders imposing vaccine 
mandates on all Federal employees, 
Federal contractors, healthcare work-
ers, and even private businesses with 
more than 100 employees. 
These mandates are forcing Ameri-
cans to choose between their pay-
checks and their principles. 
I have heard from multiple agents at 
the USDA’s Farm Service Agency who 
have chosen to resign rather than re-
ceive the vaccine. Just a year ago, 
these same agents were deemed essen-
tial, connecting vital resources to 
farmers and ranchers, and today, they 
are out of a job. 
Congress should immediately review 
these mandates in full and take up leg-
islation like my bill, the Stop Vaccine 
Mandates Act, which would have pro-
hibited OSHA from implementing a 
vaccine mandate on private businesses 
altogether. 
Anyone who wants to receive a vac-
cine should do so, but that is a per-
sonal healthcare decision. It is not an 
arena for mandates from the govern-
ment, and I am deeply disappointed by 
President Biden’s policies and lack of 
responsible, legitimate concerns sur-
rounding them. I will continue to push 
against these overreaching mandates 
with all of us and will fight to protect 
the freedoms of the American people. 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Georgia 
(Mr. ALLEN). 
Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my colleague, Mr. KELLER, for leading 
this important effort in letting the 
American people know that we are 
fighting for you. 
As I said since day one, folks should 
consult with their doctor and get the 
vaccine if they are able. But instead of 
allowing local healthcare providers and 
communities to instill confidence in 
the vaccine, the Biden administration 
is choosing to push a top-down govern-
ment mandate, which does not work 
and will never work. 
It comes down to this: Workers 
across the country are facing the 
choice to get vaccinated or lose their 
job. 
This is the epitome of government 
overreach. Every American has the 
right to earn a living. 
While I believe this mandate is likely 
unconstitutional, I look forward to 
watching it continue moving through 
the courts. 
It is also our duty as Members of 
Congress to fight this legislatively. 
That is why it is important to exercise 
our authority under the Congressional 
Review Act to nullify this rule. 
I am proud to fight for over 80 mil-
lion workers who will be impacted by 
this overreaching mandate by ensuring 
this rule has no force or effect. 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin 
(Mr. GROTHMAN). 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, 
like all other Congressmen, I am sure, 
my office has received many calls from 
people objecting to the OSHA rules and 
the CMS rules related to employees of 
hospitals. 
It amazes me, the number of articu-
late doctors and nurses and other em-
ployees out there who have good rea-
sons not to take the vaccine. Whether 
their doctors have told them don’t take 
it because you already have antibodies, 
you have too many antibodies, the vac-
cine is going to make you sick; wheth-
er it is doctors who tell their patients 
you better not take the vaccine, your 
cancer is in remission, the vaccine can 
weaken you and bring it back. 
Again and again, it appalls me that 
doctor Biden decides to weigh in and 
knows better for these people than 
what their own doctors do, not to men-
tion there are plenty of things on the 
internet—which may be true even 
though they try to take them down and 
keep us in the dark—indicating that 
some very articulate people believe the 
vaccines are not for you anyway, and 
there are other ways to deal with the 
problem. 
It is such a gross grab of power to 
think you can tell other people what 
they have to do with their own bodies. 
I sure hope America stands up and says 
no to this kind of hatred and arro-
gance. 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Oklahoma 
(Mr. HERN). 
Mr. HERN. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. 
KELLER) for hosting this Special Order 
this evening and for leading the charge 
on the Congressional Review Act. 
President Biden is characterizing his 
agenda with three simple words: Build 
Back Better. More appropriately, it 
should be build back broke. 
Our economy is in shambles, our sup-
ply chain strained to the breaking 
point, and inflation is out of control, 
and our friends across the aisle refuse 
to recognize that. At the heart of all 
these lies, lies a devastating labor 
shortage. 
A few commonsense measures would 
address these problems to bring an end 
to the many crises, but President 
Biden instead chose to mandate vac-
cinations for workers, forcing small 
businesses to either fire their workers 
or face large fines. 
Earlier today, OSHA announced that 
it will suspend enforcement of Biden’s 
immoral and unconstitutional vaccine 
mandate after being blocked by the 
Fifth Circuit Court. Biden and his pup-
peteers knew that this mandate would 
likely not be held up in court but still 
went through with it anyway, proving 
their allegiance to the radical socialist 
mob rather than to the Constitution of 
these great United States. 
To every American who raised your 
voice up and stood up to the gross Fed-
eral overreach, this victory is for you. 
I am proud to stand with my colleagues 
in opposition to this government over-
reach.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6362 
November 17, 2021 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Georgia 
(Mr. CARTER). 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding. 
I rise today in opposition of the 
President’s unconstitutional vaccine 
mandate. 
Today, OSHA finally suspended en-
forcement of its vaccine mandate in re-
sponse to the Fifth Circuit Court’s rul-
ing earlier this month. The only reason 
this happened is because Republicans 
and the people demanded that our 
rights be protected and used the power 
given to us by our Constitution to de-
fend those rights. 
And we can’t stop now. 
If these mandates are about public 
health, why do one-third of physicians 
disagree with them? 
If these mandates are responding to 
an emergency, why do they not take ef-
fect until January 4? 
If the mandates are based on science, 
why are we only looking at vaccine 
status and not natural immunity? 
It is because Washington Democrats 
are trying to control you, not protect 
you. 
Democratic leaders can’t seem to fol-
low their own rules and expectations. 
They party and gather with no masks, 
yet they expect their constituents to 
wear a mask at gatherings or even not 
gather at all. 
President Biden, hypocrisy is not a 
viable COVID–19 mitigation strategy. 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Alabama 
(Mr. CARL). 
Mr. CARL. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my colleague from Pennsylvania for 
his leadership on this issue. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to oppose 
President 
Biden’s 
unconstitutional 
vaccine mandates on our businesses. 
I believe this vaccine is effective. 
That is why I took it, and that is the 
reason my family has taken it. But I 
strongly believe getting the vaccine 
should be a personal choice, not a man-
dated choice. 
The Federal Government has no right 
to mandate the vaccine on job creators 
or workers who are already struggling 
to recover from this pandemic and to 
get our supply chain back working 
properly again. The last thing they 
need right now is more government 
rules and regulations, and that is all 
we are seeing out of this administra-
tion. 
The American people are fed up with 
it. They are fed up with Big Govern-
ment overreach in our lives. 
That is why I am proud to stand with 
so many of my colleagues to introduce 
this Congressional Review Act resolu-
tion, which would officially strike 
down President Biden’s illegal vaccine 
mandate on our businesses. 
We will continue doing all we can to 
fight back against President Biden’s 
war on American workers, and I urge 
my colleagues on both sides of the aisle 
to stand with us. 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Michigan 
(Mr. WALBERG). 
b 1845 
Mr. WALBERG. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, today, we are here 
to take a stand against President 
Biden’s unconstitutional vaccine man-
date on private businesses and their 
employees. And in the end, I think it is 
clear that we need to make sure we un-
derstand this is unconstitutional, this 
goes against the American way and the 
American ideals. 
By invoking the Congressional Re-
view Act, we are taking an important 
step to protect the liberties of millions 
of Americans in the workforce, and 
more importantly, to protect American 
ideals and the freedoms that we expect. 
In his first year as President, Presi-
dent Biden has led a lackluster eco-
nomic recovery plagued by record in-
flation, supply chain backlogs, and 
workforce shortages. The President’s 
coercive mandate will only worsen 
issues within the workforce as millions 
could face termination—wrongly and 
unnecessarily. 
I have heard from many constituents 
concerned 
about 
their 
livelihoods. 
Small 
businesses 
concerned 
about 
keeping 
their 
doors 
open. 
Rural 
healthcare providers concerned about 
meeting staffing demands and even 
staying in business. While I am encour-
aged to see the early court rulings on 
this issue, and OSHA’s step to back up 
a little bit today, Congress must not 
stand on the sidelines. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my col-
league from Pennsylvania for his lead-
ership in introducing this legislation, 
and I am proud to be a cosponsor. 
We have had enough topdown man-
dates. 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Michigan. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. 
FOXX), a great mentor, an outstanding 
person, my good friend. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding, and I thank 
him for leading this Special Order to-
night. 
Madam Speaker, the Biden adminis-
tration’s unprecedented OSHA vaccine 
mandate is a massive power grab. This 
national diktat was recently found 
likely to be unlawful by the Fifth Cir-
cuit and it stretches the power of the 
Federal Government beyond recogni-
tion. Requiring employers to be the 
vaccine and testing police and telling 
them who they can and cannot employ 
is a bridge too far. 
Further, this mandate will crush 
businesses with exorbitant costs while 
exacerbating the worker shortage. Why 
would the Biden administration make 
this crisis worse? It is clear that the 
Biden administration is using this pan-
demic as an excuse to inflate the power 
of the Federal Government as far as 
possible. That is what we must resist. 
To get our economy back on track, 
we don’t need more crippling mandates 
and regulations, we need to support 
workers and job creators. 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Tennessee 
(Mr. 
BURCHETT), my friend and colleague. 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Pennsyl-
vania (Mr. KELLER), and thank him for 
his better-than-lackluster handling of 
this event tonight. It is much appre-
ciated. 
Madam Speaker, for the past several 
weeks, I have been coming down here 
to make the point over and over again 
that Joe Biden’s vaccine mandate is ri-
diculous and unconstitutional. Many of 
my colleagues have done the same. We 
all agree that no American should lose 
their job for deciding not to take the 
coronavirus vaccine. 
Today, our efforts paid off. Biden’s 
Occupational Safety and Health Ad-
ministration announced just a few 
hours ago that it is suspending plans to 
implement a vaccine mandate on large 
employers. The bureaucrats saw the 
writing on the wall after a court 
blocked 
the 
vaccine 
mandate 
last 
weekend. 
The victory doesn’t mean the fight is 
over. Joe Biden’s administration will 
try again to punish Americans who de-
cide not to take the shot. As a matter 
of fact, they are even advising some to 
just disregard the court order. 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate Mr. 
KELLER for leading this effort to over-
turn Biden’s vaccine mandate. It is 
good to know we have this legislative 
measure ready to go if Biden launches 
another attack on unvaccinated Ameri-
cans. 
Madam Speaker, many Americans 
still 
have 
questions 
about 
the 
coronavirus vaccine. They should have 
the freedom to make the choice that is 
right for them without government 
threatening their jobs. Our country is a 
symbol of personal liberty and free-
dom, a government vaccine mandate is 
out of touch with these values. 
We have a responsibility to preserve 
our Nation’s values to protect our con-
stituents from extreme government 
overreach. 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. PFLUGER). 
Mr. PFLUGER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Pennsyl-
vania (Mr. KELLER), my colleague. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to shed 
light on the outrageous overreaching 
vaccine mandate that is devastating 
the lives of Americans, including those 
that I represent. 
Everywhere I go in my district, I 
hear from workers across all sectors 
who are facing the prospect of being 
fired. And why? Simply because Joe 
Biden and the White House think that 
they know better, that they have made 
a different medical decision than the 
powers that be in the White House.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6363 
November 17, 2021 
A few examples of calls that I have 
received just this week: A soon-to-be- 
mother who doesn’t want to take the 
vaccine until after she gives birth is 
facing 
termination. 
The 
countless 
healthcare workers who have sacrificed 
so much for the last year-and-a-half- 
plus to save the lives of all of us to be 
there to serve us, and now they are fac-
ing termination. A married couple re-
cently moved to San Angelo during the 
pandemic in search of freedom and per-
sonal liberty that Texas so desperately 
promises the rest of the country. And 
now the husband, an Air Force veteran 
and a Border Patrol agent, faces termi-
nation due to President Biden’s egre-
gious Federal overreach. 
It is about control. This is about con-
trol. This vaccine mandate is another 
example of Democrats’ belief that the 
government should control every as-
pect of our lives. 
America, wake up. The message is 
the same: That the President thinks he 
knows better for you than you know 
for yourself. We must strike down 
Biden’s unconstitutional vaccine man-
date now. 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman very much for 
those remarks. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Utah (Mr. MOORE). 
Mr. MOORE of Utah. Madam Speak-
er, I thank my colleague from Pennsyl-
vania. 
Madam Speaker, today, I stand in op-
position to President Biden’s vaccine 
mandate on businesses issued by the 
Occupational Safety and Health Ad-
ministration, or OSHA. 
The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals 
confirmed that the Biden administra-
tion is severely misusing his power. 
While OSHA’s delegated authority was 
intended to be used with precision and 
tact, President Biden has wielded it 
carelessly. 
Just yesterday, in keeping with the 
Fifth Circuit’s ruling, OSHA itself sus-
pended implementation of this man-
date. Even so, my colleagues and I in 
Congress know we, too, must fight 
against this mandate. 
The COVID–19 vaccines are miracles 
of modern medicine and has saved lives 
and quickened the end of the pandemic. 
My family has embraced it. I am 
comfortable with my parents having 
used this to live a more outward life, 
but we cannot forget that America is 
founded upon principles enshrined in 
our Constitution that protect an indi-
vidual’s ability to make their own de-
cisions. 
When I swore to uphold the Constitu-
tion, I promised to fight against efforts 
to undermine these rights, and I stand 
by that oath today. 
Madam Speaker, I urge support for 
this CRA. 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for those com-
ments. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Kansas (Mr. ESTES), my 
good friend and colleague. 
Mr. ESTES. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for hosting this Special 
Order. 
Madam Speaker, following the Biden 
administration’s 
overreaching 
man-
dates, hundreds of Kansans have shared 
their concerns with me about how this 
would affect their jobs, livelihoods, and 
families. 
One vaccinated individual wrote say-
ing, ‘‘I would love for people to be vac-
cinated, but mandating a vaccination, 
and even worse, making the employers 
the enforcers, is yet another example 
of government pushing more onto the 
plates of business managers.’’ 
Others tell me how they have been at 
the same company for decades, some 
near retirement and some who con-
tinue to work faithfully in person each 
day through the pandemic, especially 
our first responders and healthcare 
workers, yet they are being demoted or 
forced to retire or resign because they 
made 
some 
personal 
healthcare 
choices. One teacher wrote, ‘‘My doctor 
and I discussed the vaccine and deemed 
it would not be good for me to get it. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
these 
Kansans 
aren’t anti-vaccine, they just don’t be-
lieve that the Federal Government 
should be forcing them and their neigh-
bors to make a healthcare decision or 
lose a job. 
My colleagues and I are utilizing the 
Congressional Review Act to attempt 
to strike down one of these mandates, 
hopefully putting an end to this over-
reach by the administration and the 
Federal Government. 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the good gentleman from Kan-
sas. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
SMUCKER), my good friend and fellow 
Pennsylvanian. 
Mr. SMUCKER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Mr. KELLER for his leadership on 
this issue. My wonderful colleague 
from Pennsylvania introduced the Con-
gressional Review Act, and I rise today 
in strong support of this act, which 
would block President Biden’s mis-
guided and, frankly, I think unconsti-
tutional mandate. I thank him for his 
efforts and I am very, very happy to be 
able to support that. 
Madam Speaker, I will say first, that 
I think the U.S. and what we have ac-
complished in developing a vaccine 
through Operation Warp Speed was a 
remarkable achievement of science and 
of a system in our country that devel-
ops the best medical system and the 
best drugs from across the world. And 
to be able to do that in the amount of 
time that it was done and to manufac-
ture those drugs in a large scale is 
nothing short of amazing. 
Personally, for myself, my family, we 
have discussed this with our doctor. We 
got the vaccine early on when it be-
came available. And I have encouraged 
Pennsylvanians to speak with their 
own doctors and make their own deci-
sions about the direction they want to 
take. And many Pennsylvanians have, 
and I think Mr. KELLER knows this as 
well. 
We now are at over 70 percent of our 
Commonwealth vaccinated, which begs 
the question for me: What ever hap-
pened to herd immunity? What ever 
happened? 
Every one of us were in the room 
early on during this vaccine when we 
heard from Dr. Fauci and heard from 
other experts who talked about herd 
immunity. And they were talking 
about herd immunity being achieved 
when about 70 percent—or even less 
after we learned that COVID was not as 
fatal as was originally feared. At that 
point, we could do away with govern-
ment mandates—many that were un-
necessary in the first place, by the 
way—but we could reopen the economy 
and could control COVID; 70 percent. 
We are there, but nobody is talking 
about it anymore. CDC doesn’t talk 
about it. This administration doesn’t 
talk about it. What happened? 
Madam Speaker, so I agree, there has 
got to be something else going on. And 
other speakers tonight have talked 
about it. There has got to be something 
more, and I fear it is control. It is con-
trol that people want. 
I think we should trust the science. I 
think you should listen to your med-
ical 
professionals. 
Certainly, 
it 
shouldn’t be government topdown man-
dates. 
I hear from employers every day who 
are worried that this mandate will fur-
ther harm their ability to hire and re-
train staff. They are already having a 
lot of problems due to some of the poli-
cies of this administration, but this 
will make it a lot worse. And I also 
hear from employees every day that 
are worried that this mandate may 
threaten their jobs and may threaten 
their livelihoods. 
I have been heartened that over half 
of States have sued the administration 
to reverse this mandate, and I have 
also joined with my Republican col-
leagues from Pennsylvania to call on 
our attorney general in our State to 
join that litigation. 
Madam Speaker, I stand ready to op-
pose this mandate; do everything that 
I can to block this and any vaccine 
mandates that this White House puts 
forth. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. KELLER 
for his leadership. 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Pennsyl-
vania. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. LAMALFA), 
my good friend. 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman and appreciate 
him hosting this Special Order for us 
here tonight. 
Madam Speaker, so what do we have? 
The Biden administration has been try-
ing to keep their fingerprints off of it 
for a long time. They have been trying 
to let others do their dirty work; the 
airlines, the hospitals, forcing these 
vaccines on people. Why is that? They

don’t want to have their fingerprints 
on it. 
So now they are getting impatient. 
You can go back and look at clips 
where they say, Oh, it is not the role of 
the Federal Government, by Jen Psaki, 
by others in the administration. It is 
not our job. We are not supposed to do 
this. Now they don’t care. They are 
pushing forward. 
So the Fifth Circuit came in and 
said, You are going overboard by get-
ting OSHA to do the dirty work for 
you. They said it was ‘‘staggeringly 
overbroad,’’ and they told them take 
no steps to implement or enforce the 
mandate until further court order. It 
raises serious constitutional questions. 
It likely exceeds the Federal Govern-
ment’s authority. 
So they have stepped out of line and 
they have been slapped back. It is 
amazing, because the people on the 
front lines this year-and-a-half our 
nurses, doctors, and others that are 
called the essential employees, have 
been playing good ball. Now, they are 
being told, Oh, that is not good enough 
anymore. You can’t have your job any-
more unless you take this vaccine. 
Personal decisions. You can’t undo a 
vaccine once you have had it taken. 
And so the aggressiveness of this ad-
ministration towards people’s personal 
decisions is just amazingly overbroad. I 
am really pleased we are doing this 
Congressional Review Act to nullify 
OSHA’s mandate that has been, at 
least for a while, set aside by the Fifth 
Circuit Court and hopefully joined 
across the street by the Supreme 
Court. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman for the time.

Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, I ap-
preciate the remarks from the gen-
tleman of California and all the Mem-
bers who stood here today. I thank my 
colleagues in both the House and the 
Senate for standing with the American 
people in opposition to this blatant 
overreach by President Biden. 
Our Congressional Review Act resolu-
tion puts every Member of Congress on 
record. You are either for this blatant 
government overreach and control, or 
you are against it. You are either with 
this kind of control, or you are with 
the American people. 
Well, I will tell you right now, my 
colleagues who spoke here today, the 
people who are helping with this Con-
gressional Review Act, my colleagues 
in the Senate, we are with the people 
for whom we work. We are with the 
American people, saying they know 
best. 
It is not government that runs things 
here in America. It is we the people. 
We stand with the people in opposing 
this overreach by the Biden adminis-
tration. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

bers are reminded to refrain from en-

TRANSGENDER DAY OF 
REMEMBRANCE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. NEW-
MAN) for 30 minutes. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. NEWMAN. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on the subject of my 
Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Illinois? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. NEWMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today on behalf of the transgender 
Americans who must fight every day 
for their right to live as their authen-
tic selves. 
This Saturday, November 20, marks 
Transgender Day of Remembrance, a 
day to honor the memory of the 
transgender 
and 
nonbinary 
people 
whose lives were lost this year in acts 
of violence. 
Tomorrow, I am proudly joining my 
colleagues 
and 
fellow 
Transgender 
Equality Task Force co-chairs, Rep-
resentatives 
PRAMILA
JAYAPAL
and 
JENNIFER WEXTON, to formally intro-
duce a resolution to nationally com-
memorate this very somber annual ob-
servance. 
At least 375 transgender or nonbinary 
individuals across the globe have been 
killed this year—375. In our Nation 
alone, it breaks my heart to say that, 
so far this year, the Human Rights 
Campaign has reported at least 46 
transgender or gender nonconforming 
people were killed by violent means. 
We say ‘‘at least’’ because we believe 
this number is actually much higher 
due to the unfortunate prevalence of 
underreporting or misreporting vio-
lence against this community. 
They were friends, family, loved 
ones, parents. They were taken far too 
soon. We must honor their memory 
with a commitment to fight anti-trans 
hate and violence anywhere it exists. 
It is with this commitment that I 
now read the names of each of these 
Americans into the CONGRESSIONAL 
RECORD. May their memory serve as a 
call to action for all of us:

Madam Speaker, may we honor their 
memory today and every day. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to my col-
league from the great State of Rhode 
Island (Mr. CICILLINE), the chair of the 
congressional 
LGBTQ-Plus 
Equality 
Caucus. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding, 
for leading us in this Special Order 
hour, and for saying out loud the 
names of the individuals who we have 
lost. 
I am proud today to rise in recogni-
tion of Transgender Day of Remem-
brance, which we will mark this Satur-
day, November 20, and in remembrance 
of the transgender and gender noncon-
forming people whose lives were taken 
this year. 
Madam Speaker, 52 years ago, in the 
early morning hours of June 28, 1969, 
New York City Police raided the Stone-
wall Inn, a popular gay bar in Green-
wich Village. It had become a refuge 
and a well-known gathering place for 
LGBTQI-plus individuals. 
This was the third such raid on 
Greenwich Village bars in a short pe-
riod of time. Tired of harassment and 
blatant discrimination, patrons began 
clashing with law enforcement outside 
the 
Stonewall 
Inn 
on 
Christopher 
Street. 
This was not the first time LGBTQI- 
plus people fought back, but these 
clashes sparked an uprising that would 
unfold over the next 6 days and fun-
damentally change LGBTQI-plus activ-
ism in the United States and around 
the world. 
At the forefront of this uprising were 
transgender and gender nonconforming 
people like Marsha P. Johnson, the P 
standing for ‘‘pay it no mind,’’ a com-
mon response Marsha would say to 
questions about her gender.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6365 
November 17, 2021 
Too often, transgender individuals 
are left out of the story of the LGBTQ- 
plus 
rights 
movement, 
especially 
transgender women of color like Mar-
sha, as well as Sylvia Rivera and Miss 
Major Griffin-Gracy. 
These three icons and so many other 
activists like them were and continue 
to be the backbone of the LGBTQ-plus 
civil rights movement. Miss Major, 
currently in her eighties, continues to 
fight against the disproportionate in-
carceration rates of transgender peo-
ple. 
Tragically, so far this year, at least 
46 
transgender 
or 
gender 
noncon-
forming people have been fatally shot 
or killed by other violent means in our 
own country. 2021 marks an alarming 
milestone for the transgender commu-
nity: the deadliest year on record for 
transgender and gender nonconforming 
people. Let me say it again: the dead-
liest year on record for trans and gen-
der nonconforming people. 
This epidemic of violence particu-
larly affects transgender women of 
color, specifically Black and Latinx 
transgender women, who make up more 
than three-quarters of the recorded 46 
violent deaths this year. These deaths 
are horrific, and we must act to end 
this violence. 
The right to live freely without fear 
of persecution or discrimination is one 
that every person needs and deserves. 
The Equality Act adds sexual orienta-
tion and gender identity as protected 
classes through existing civil rights 
law, ensuring that the transgender 
community would have the same pro-
tections as everyone else. I am so 
proud that we have passed that out of 
the House, and it is awaiting action 
from the Senate. 
The 2021 Transgender Day of Remem-
brance House resolution, of which I am 
a proud cosponsor, commemorates No-
vember 20, 2021, as a day of remem-
brance and memorializes the lives lost 
at the hands of anti-transgender vio-
lence in the United States and around 
the world. I urge all of my colleagues 
to support this resolution. 
Now is the time to show solidarity 
with the trans community. They have 
done the work to bring injustice 
wrought against the LGBTQI-plus com-
munity to light. They bear the brunt of 
violence, abuse, and even death. It can-
not continue. We must not let it con-
tinue. 
Madam Speaker, as we remember the 
names of the transgender individuals 
who gave their lives for this cause, we 
honor their legacy by continuing the 
fight to ensure that all people, regard-
less of gender and gender identity, are 
treated equally and justly in this coun-
try. 
Madam Speaker, the forces working 
against progress are strong, but we are 
stronger. I thank Congresswoman NEW-
MAN for being one of the co-chairs of 
the Transgender Equality Task Force 
of the Equality Caucus, for the good 
work in developing this resolution, and 
for leading this Special Order hour to-
night. 
Ms. NEWMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Congressman CICILLINE, who is 
an amazing champion for the Equality 
Act and all things LGBTQI. I couldn’t 
be more pleased to be his colleague. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. TAKANO), a 
co-chair of the Congressional LGBTQ- 
plus Equality Caucus and the chairman 
of the House Veterans Affairs’ Com-
mittee, where he champions legislation 
to serve our LGBTQ-plus veterans. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
thank 
Congresswoman 
NEWMAN
for 
yielding. It is a great honor to be here 
today 
under 
such 
somber 
cir-
cumstances. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in rec-
ognition of Transgender Day of Re-
membrance and Transgender Aware-
ness Week. It is with a heavy heart 
that I recognize that this has been the 
deadliest 
year 
on 
record 
for 
our 
transgender sisters, brothers, and sib-
lings. I want to share with you the 
names of three individuals that we lost 
in my home State of California. I 
grieve with the families, loved ones, 
and communities that lost these young 
people far too early for no reason other 
than hate. 
Rayanna Pardo, age 26, was a beloved 
daughter and sister living in East Los 
Angeles who left behind a family and 
community that loved her deeply. She 
was lost in March of this year. 
Natalia Smut, age 24, was a cele-
brated drag artist from Milpitas, Cali-
fornia. She gave captivating perform-
ances and had a courageous and cre-
ative spirit, and she was described by 
those who knew her as a jewel in her 
community. She was lost in April. 
Poe Black, also known as Oliver 
Jackson and Legion, was an indige-
nous, trans-masculine and two-spirit 
activist and artist. He was a tireless 
advocate who used his social media 
platform to support various social jus-
tice causes, including by documenting 
his transition to educate and inspire 
his followers. He was lost in May. 
Each of these young people leaves be-
hind a network of family, friends, and 
community upon which they have 
made an indelible impression. I join 
their communities in honoring their 
light and legacy and share in the grief 
that they were taken from the people 
who loved them. 
It is in remembrance of these three 
individuals 
that 
I 
say 
this: 
Transgender Week of Awareness cannot 
only be about awareness. It also must 
be about action. 
We cannot pretend that the rhetoric 
heard here in this Chamber and in 
statehouses across the country does 
not have a direct impact on the lives of 
transgender people. This year, we have 
seen the introduction of over 100 anti- 
trans bills in State legislatures, whip-
ping up a moral panic around the iden-
tities of adults and targeting children. 
The 
dehumanizing 
debates 
over 
whether an individual should have con-
trol over their own body, whether they 
should be allowed to compete on the 
athletic field, whether they even exist, 
these arguments all connect directly to 
the 
types 
of 
attacks 
that 
killed 
Rayanna, Natalia, Poe Black, and so 
many more. 
It is not enough to only recognize the 
devastating statistics. We must also 
make policy decisions that recognize 
transgender people for who they are. 
Who are they? They are loved ones, 
community members, family members, 
individuals who add depth and richness 
to our society and are defined by far 
more than statistics, hatred, or big-
otry. 
So this Transgender Remembrance 
Day, remember those who were lost by 
making noise. Raise your voice against 
the persistent and dangerous misin-
formation about transgender identity. 
Raise your voice in celebration of loved 
ones, friends, family, and community 
members who are transgender. 
Raise your voice to support the next 
generation of transgender and non-
binary young people so that they may 
recognize the great beauty and joy in 
their identity rather than living in fear 
or shame. 
b 1915 
Now, we cannot bring those who have 
been lost back to their loved ones, but 
we can play a role in ensuring that 
other friends, families, and commu-
nities do not have to suffer a loss like 
Rayanna’s, Natalia’s and Poe Black’s 
communities did. So I call on my col-
leagues this year to turn awareness 
into action because making policy that 
centers on safety, equity, and pros-
perity for transgender people should 
not be an effort that lasts only a week, 
but it should be all year round and 
throughout the rest of our lives. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my friend 
for yielding. 
Ms. NEWMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Congressman TAKANO for all his 
advocacy and leadership. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from the great Common-
wealth 
of 
Massachusetts 
(Ms. 
PRESSLEY), who is a champion of 
LGBTQ-plus rights and whose inter-
sectional approach is simply inspira-
tional. 
Ms. PRESSLEY. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in recognition of Transgender Day 
of Remembrance. 
In 1999, Rita Hester, a transgender 
woman, was murdered in Allston, a 
neighborhood in my district, the Mas-
sachusetts Seventh. In response to this 
horrific tragedy, this day was created 
to memorialize the loss of her life and 
far too many others due to transphobic 
violence. 
The cruelty of transphobia is a 
threat that we must confront and root 
out wherever it exists. Whether in 
music or on television or in the hal-
lowed Halls of the Nation’s Capitol, 
there is no place for hatred because 
someone is brave enough to show up 
exactly as they are and to live their 
truth. 
Yet in 2021, we have seen at least 46 
transgender or gender nonconforming

people killed. We have been robbed of 
at least 46 souls, disproportionately 
Black and Latinx transwomen, and 
these are only the ones who have been 
properly reported. 
On the floor of Congress, we speak 
their names:

Zoella ‘‘Zoey’’ Rose Martinez 
Jo Acker 
Jessi Hart 
Rikkey Outumuro 
Marquiisha Lawrence 
Jenny De Leon 
And Jahaira DeAlto who was mur-
dered in my district. 
Jahaira, a friend, a mother, and an 
activist spoke out 22 years ago when 
Rita Hester was killed. As a survivor of 
domestic violence, she advocated for 
gender affirming shelters and, with 
kindness in her heart, opened her home 
to queer and trans people with nowhere 
to go. 
Jahaira DeAlto’s compassion will for-
ever be her legacy, alongside her leg-
endary status in the ballroom commu-
nity for serving ‘‘everyday realness.’’ 
While we grieve the loss of loved 
ones, neighbors, and colleagues, we 
must also hold space to celebrate their 
lives and the differences they make in 
ours. 
Transgender people are community 
organizers, military soldiers, and jus-
tice seekers who have put their bodies 
on the line domestically and abroad to 
fight for a safe and equitable society. 
They are artists, healers, and enter-
tainers who nurture our soul and 
spread joy wherever they go. Most im-
portantly, transgender people are bea-
cons of hope and pillars of courage 
serving as living testaments of what it 
means to be unapologetically you. 
While transphobia seeks to erase 
these truths, we must affirm the dig-
nity of every member of the trans com-
munity. 
So 
I 
rise 
today 
to 
remember 
Transgender Day of Remembrance and 
recommit myself to the work of justice 
and equity for all people, including my 
transgender siblings in the movement 
for liberation. Our destinies are tied. 
Ms. NEWMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Congresswoman PRESSLEY for all 
her great work. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from the great State of Cali-
fornia (Ms. JACOBS), who is a proud sis-
ter to a trans brother and gender non-
conforming sibling. 
Ms. JACOBS of California. Madam 
Speaker, I thank Congresswoman NEW-
MAN for yielding and thanks to the 
Equality Caucus for organizing this 
Special Order. 
As the gentlewoman mentioned, I am 
the proud sister of a trans brother and 
a gender nonconforming sibling. I am 
also the proud Representative of Hill-
crest, the heart of San Diego’s LGBTQ- 
plus community, so this issue is deeply 
personal to me and to the people whom 
I love. 
Every time that we hear about an-
other trans person being murdered, I 
think about my siblings and my con-
stituents, and my heart breaks because 
this epidemic of violence has gone on 
for too long. 
For too long, trans voices have been 
silenced, ignored, and disrespected. 
Whether they are trying to access 
healthcare, trying to find housing, or 
even when they are just trying to go 
about their daily lives, our trans neigh-
bors and friends face discrimination, 
harassment, and a pervasive lack of re-
sources. 
Even in this body, we have colleagues 
actively working to prevent equality 
for the trans community who continue 
to misgender and dehumanize our trans 
friends and family and continue deny-
ing them the support they need and are 
trying to keep them on the margins of 
our society. 
This rhetoric and this anti-trans leg-
islation making its way through the 
country has real-world consequences. 
With the recent news of the killing of 
Marquiisha Lawrence in South Caro-
lina, 2021 just became the deadliest 
year on record for trans and nonbinary 
people. This year alone at least 45 
trans people have been killed. 
It is, at least, because all too often 
when trans people are killed, the de-
tails of their lives are misreported. 
They are misgendered or deadnamed in 
police reports and death certificates. 
So not only are their lives being taken 
from them, their authentic identity— 
who they really were and fought so 
hard to be—is also being erased. So we 
must continue to say the names of peo-
ple like Poe Black and Natalia Smut 
who were killed this year in California. 
Their lives are a reminder that we 
must continue to fight for trans equal-
ity especially for transwomen of color. 
As important as it is for us to cele-
brate the lives of the trans people who 
were taken from us, we also need to 
celebrate trans people when they are 
still alive. So this Transgender Aware-
ness Week, let us commit to uplifting 
trans people when they are still here 
not only after they are gone. 
I honor the strength and resilience of 
the trans community. I will continue 
to make their voices heard in the Halls 
of Congress, and I will continue to ad-
vocate for the support that they have 
been denied for far too long. 
I want any young person who is 
watching this to know that they are 
perfect, they are loved, and they are 
needed in this world exactly the way 
they are, and I will be here every day 
fighting for them. 
Ms. NEWMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Congresswoman JACOBS for her 
kind remarks. 
I have one more speaker, Madam 
Speaker. We have Representative AL 
GREEN, who is an LGBTQ ally. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. GREEN). 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I thank the gentlewoman for yield-
ing. 
And still I rise, Madam Speaker, as a 
proud ally of the transgender commu-
nity. And I rise tonight with a special 
message. This message means a lot to 
me because I truly believe that the 
pledge is correct. We pledge allegiance 
to the flag of the United States of 
America, and to the Republic for which 
it stands, one nation under God with 
liberty and justice for all. 
All cannot exclude the trans commu-
nity. All has to include the trans ba-
bies and the children in Texas who are 
having to suffer through debates about 
what they can do athletically. All has 
to include people who lose their lives 
simply because they are being who 
they are. 
I rise with a message of I am with 
you, I am your ally, and I live today to 
live to see the day that transwomen 
will not have to live in fear of dying be-
cause of who they are and trans chil-
dren can grow up and simply be chil-
dren in this country where we pledge 
liberty and justice for all. 
Ms. NEWMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Congressman GREEN. He is abso-
lutely right. All is all and love is love. 
That concludes our Special Order 
hour. I want to thank each of my col-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6367 
November 17, 2021 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, and still I rise. And I rise on this oc-
casion to bring to the attention of this 
House H. Res. 746, the Original Na-
tional Domestic Violence Awareness 
Month Resolution of 2021. 
H. Res. 746 expresses support for Na-
tional Domestic Violence Awareness 
Month and that Congress should con-
tinue to raise awareness of this issue. 
This resolution has 160 original co-
sponsors including 18 Republicans. It is 
a bipartisan resolution. I am honored 
to say that the lead cosponsor from 
Louisiana, Mr. GARRET GRAVES, is a 
person who has been very helpful in 
helping to get this resolution presented 
and get signatures of persons who 
would be supportive. 
Domestic violence is a more prolific 
problem than many realize. Domestic 
violence is a problem that too often is 
concealed. Many people don’t report 
the fact that they are being abused. 
People are locked in. They find them-
selves having to live with abuse be-
cause the abuse is being perpetrated by 
someone that they love and someone 
whom they care for but someone who 
does not care as much for them. 
Nearly one in three college women 
say they have been in an abusive dat-
ing relationship. Ninety-two percent of 
homeless 
women 
experience 
severe 
physical or sexual abuse at some point 
in their lifetimes. 
A 2020 survey by the National Net-
work to End Domestic Violence re-
ported that 76,525 violence victims were 
served by domestic violence shelters 
and programs around the Nation in a 
single day. Additionally, 11,047 requests 
for services went unmet—went unmet— 
because of a lack of resources. We have 
to do more to help the victims of do-
mestic violence. Congress can do more 
to help the victims of domestic vio-
lence. Congress should do more to help 
the victims of domestic violence. 
Domestic violence impacts individ-
uals of any gender. One in four women 
and one in seven men ages 18 and older 
will experience domestic violence at 
some point in their lives. Women ages 
18 to 34 experience the highest rates 
per capita of intimate partner violence. 
Domestic violence impacts individ-
uals of any race. African-American 
women experience intimate partner vi-
olence at a rate 35 percent higher than 
that of White women and about 2.5 
times the rate of women of other races. 
b 1930 
Twenty-one to 55 percent of Asian 
and Pacific Islander women report ex-
periencing domestic violence; that is, 
physical assault, sexual assault, or 
both, during their lifetimes. 
37.1 percent of Latinx females are 
victimized by intimate partner vio-
lence in a lifetime. One in three Native 
American women will be raped, and 6 
in 10 will be physically assaulted in 
their lifetimes. 
Domestic violence impacts individ-
uals of any sexual orientation. Sixty- 
one percent of bisexual women, 43.8 
percent of lesbian women, 37.3 of bisex-
ual men, and 26 percent of homosexual 
men experience intimate partner vio-
lence during their lifetimes. 
Too often, children are affected by 
domestic violence and sexual assault. 
One in 15 children are exposed to inti-
mate partner violence each year, and 90 
percent of these children are eye-
witnesses to such violence. 
Children exposed to domestic vio-
lence are more likely to attempt sui-
cide, abuse drugs and alcohol, run away 
from home, and become victims of 
human trafficking. Our children are 
suffering. Those who witness these acts 
of domestic violence need help. We 
need to provide more counseling for 
children. 
Even when this tragedy occurs, it is 
shameful for children to have to wit-
ness it. But more tragic than that, 
when children themselves are victim-
ized, they have to carry that memory 
with them for a lifetime. 
One in 10 District of Columbia high 
school students reported experiencing 
physical violence from a dating partner 
in the past year. Half of youth who 
have been victims of both dating vio-
lence and rape attempt suicide, com-
pared to 12.5 percent of non-abused 
girls and 5.4 percent of non-abused 
boys. 
One large study found that men ex-
posed to physical abuse, sexual abuse, 
and adult domestic violence as children 
were almost four times more likely 
than other men to have perpetrated do-
mestic violence as adults. 
The point to be made is, those who 
suffer from domestic violence and 
abuse are likely to perpetrate domestic 
violence and abuse; not all, but a good 
many. 
There is a need for primary schools, 
secondary schools, and postsecondary 
schools to educate students about the 
issues of domestic violence, sexual as-
sault, dating violence, and stalking. 
Education is the means by which many 
can avoid becoming victims. We must 
do more to educate our young. 
The term domestic violence is often 
inadequate because it fails to capture 
the full extent of the impacts that the 
event can have on a victim’s life. The 
average cost of intimate partner vio-
lence over a victim’s lifetime for med-
ical and mental healthcare services is 
about 
$103,000-plus—that 
is 
for 
women—and $23,000-plus for men. 
The term domestic violence also fails 
to capture how, in some instances, do-
mestic violence literally means domes-
tic murder because, on average, more 
than three women are murdered by 
their husbands or their boyfriends in 
the United States every day. 
Most murdered transgender women 
are killed by intimate partners. 
However, in spite of all of this, there 
is hope. Survivors of domestic violence 
are strong, courageous, and resilient, 
but they need help. Surviving the phys-
ical and mental abuse requires more 
than simply relocating. Many times, 
counseling is needed. 
The strength that they have is some-
thing that we can admire, but that 
strength can be fortified if they can 
have proper counseling so that they 
can get the assistance that they need, 
not only to stabilize themselves men-
tally, but also to understand that they 
are not the reason for the violence 
being perpetrated upon them. Too 
often, the victims believe that they are 
responsible for the actions of the per-
sons who are abusing them. They need 
help. 
This is what we can do. We can help 
to make sure people understand that 
victims are not responsible for what 
perpetrators do. 
A recently released multistate study 
shows that the Nation’s domestic vio-
lence shelters are addressing victims 
urgent and long-term needs, and are 
helping victims protect themselves and 
their children. Domestic violence advo-
cates provide lifesaving essential serv-
ices. There is a need to increase, not 
reduce funding for programs aimed at 
intervening in and preventing domestic 
violence in the United States. 
So therefore, I am so proud tonight 
to say that we should resolve that the 
goals and ideals of Domestic Violence 
Awareness Month are important; that 
these goals and ideals should be pur-
sued; that this House of Representa-
tives can do more to help the victims 
of domestic violence. 
I would also add that this resolution 
expresses the sense that the House of 
Representatives—that 
Congress— 
should continue to raise awareness of 
domestic violence and its devastating 
effects on individuals, families, com-
munities, and support programs de-
signed to end domestic violence in the 
United States. 
Madam Speaker, people ought not 
have to live in fear because they hap-
pen to be in an abusive relationship. 
Yes, people can take their issues to the 
police. Women can. But too often they 
have to debate within themselves the 
consequences of going to the police, the 
authorities, because they understand, 
many of them, that they have no other 
place to turn to. 
But thank God this Congress has pro-
vided enough money for shelters so 
that many can leave the environment 
where the abuse is being perpetrated. 
This is a serious issue that we should 
all be concerned with. If we allow the 
perpetration and perpetuation of do-
mestic violence to continue, it does not 
bode well for the fiber and fabric of our 
country. This is a great country, and a 
great country can protect people who 
are being abused in their own homes. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

LEAVE OF ABSENCE 
By unanimous consent, leave of ab-
sence was granted to: 
Mr. GRIFFITH (at the request of Mr. 
MCCARTHY) for today on account of a 
funeral for a slain officer in his dis-
trict.

following nomination, which the clerk

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader is recog-
nized. 
NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
later today, the Senate is scheduled to 
take the first procedural step to begin 
consideration of the annual defense 
bill. 
Our Republican colleagues have said 
for weeks that we need to move quick-
ly to take up the NDAA and pass it 
through the Chamber. 
This morning, we are continuing to 
work with our Republican colleagues 
to strengthen the substitute with as 
many amendments from Senators as 
possible. We are making really good 
progress, and so we will give the Armed 
Services Committee more time this 
morning to review the text and come 
to a final agreement. 
But the Senate needs to move for-
ward on this bill, and quickly. With so 
much bipartisan interest in getting 
NDAA done soon, I see no reason why 
we can’t finish this legislation or come 
to an agreement to finish this bill 
quickly. 
I thank my colleagues from both 
sides of the aisle, and especially our 
committee chairs. I thank them be-
cause they are propelling this impor-
tant legislation forward. 
BUILD BACK BETTER AGENDA 
Now on Build Back Better—I want to 
return to a comment made recently by 
the other side that crystalizes the dif-
ference between how the two parties 
see today’s challenges. 
‘‘A gold mine.’’ ‘‘A gold mine.’’ Those 
three words were used by my colleague, 
the junior Senator from Florida, when 
talking about Americans struggling 
with rising costs. A gold mine for 
them. 
If you want to know why Americans 
can get frustrated with Washington, 
look no further than the comments 
like the one from the gentleman from 
Florida. 
The Republicans, who voted for a 
giant tax break for millionaires and 
billionaires, don’t have any solutions 
for working families, but they see po-
litical gold in exploiting their strug-
gles. 
Families are still struggling to pull 
themselves out of a once-in-a-century 
economic 
crisis 
brought 
about 
by 
COVID. They want to pay less for 
things like groceries, healthcare, pre-
scription drugs, and childcare. They 
want us to find ways to make that hap-
pen, and that is just what Democrats 
are doing in Build Back Better. But, 
unfortunately, 
Republicans 
appear 
more 
interested 
in 
politics 
than 
progress. 
It is simple: If we want to fight infla-
tion, if we want to create more jobs— 
so many businesses are short of work-
ers—and if we want to lower costs and

S8320 
November 17, 2021 
make sure families have more money 
in their pockets, the best thing—the 
best thing—we can do is pass Build 
Back Better. 
Seventeen 
Nobel 
Prize-winning 
economists—and more from both sides 
of the political spectrum—have said 
that this bill will help relieve infla-
tionary pressures over the long term. 
And this morning, an exclusive by 
Reuters confirmed that, for all the Re-
publicans howling at the Moon about 
inflation, Build Back Better will not— 
will not—increase inflation. 
And here is what the leading econo-
mist at Moody’s said: 
The bills do not add to inflation pressures, 
as the policies help to lift long-term eco-
nomic growth via stronger productivity and 
labor force growth, and thus take the edge 
off inflation. 
Stronger growth, less inflation. I will 
say it again: If you want to fight infla-
tion, if you want to lower costs and 
grow the economy, support Build Back 
Better. If you want to fight inflation, 
support Build Back Better. 
Build Back Better is going to help 
families 
save 
money 
by 
making 
childcare more affordable. It is going 
to give parents a tax break so they can 
pay for diapers and groceries and gas. 
It is going to lower the cost of prescrip-
tion drugs, like insulin and cancer 
treatments; and it is going to put more 
Americans to work, help our economy 
grow in the long term. 
The American people want these 
things. 
Why won’t a single Republican come 
out and vote for them—a single Repub-
lican? Why do Republicans seem so in-
tent on opposing lowering the price of 
insulin or giving parents a middle-class 
tax break? 
Given the choice between helping 
families afford childcare and leaving 
them to fend for themselves, Repub-
licans are telling families: You are on 
your own. 
Listen to the list of things I just 
mentioned: middle-class tax breaks, 
lowering 
prescription 
drug 
costs, 
childcare. 
These 
aren’t 
handouts. 
These aren’t luxury items. To so many 
families, they are daily essentials, and 
they are just the beginning of what the 
BBB would offer. 
While Democrats are fighting to pass 
legislation to lower costs, Republicans, 
who spent years under Donald Trump 
trying to repeal healthcare and give 
tax breaks to the ultrarich, are oppos-
ing tax cuts to the middle class while 
rooting for prices to go up and up—a 
gold mine. 
Americans won’t forget who in Wash-
ington is fighting for them and who is 
spending their time trying to exploit 
their hardships. 
KIGALI AMENDMENT 
Finally, the Kigali Amendment. Yes-
terday, the Senate received a message 
from the White House calling for us to 
approve a treaty amendment that will 
curb our country’s use of dangerous 
hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs. 
Commonly 
known 
as 
the 
Kigali 
Amendment, 120 countries have agreed 
to the amendment. Even China is on 
the list. We should join it too. 
HFCs 
are 
dangerous 
greenhouse 
chemicals found in everyday appliances 
from air-conditioners to refrigerators. 
They are thousands of times more dam-
aging to our atmosphere than carbon 
dioxide. We had made progress in 
eliminating these chemicals before the 
Trump 
administration 
characteris-
tically, unfortunately, took us back-
wards. 
Phasing out these HFCs is very im-
portant and will go a long way in fight-
ing climate change and protecting the 
environment for future generations. 
And it is supported by the business 
community too, as it will open up com-
panies to markets for HFC alternatives 
overseas, promoting investment, inno-
vation, and greater economic activity. 
Approving this amendment will re-
quire two-thirds of the Senate. Reduc-
ing our country’s use of HFCs has been 
a bipartisan priority in the past. In 
fact, last December, the Senate ap-
proved the first-ever agreement to 
phase down HFCs—a significant win for 
fighting the climate crisis. It should be 
a bipartisan priority right now. 
In the wake of the President’s visit 
to Glasgow, approving this amend-
ment—which much of the world al-
ready embraces—is essential for telling 
the world we are committed to fighting 
the climate crisis. If we want to lead 
the world on this issue, it must—it 
must—get done. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT—H.R. 4350 
Now, Madam President, I ask unani-
mous consent that the cloture vote on 
the motion to proceed to H.R. 4350 
occur at a time to be determined by 
the majority leader, following con-
sultation with the Republican leader. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Is there objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The Republican leader is recognized. 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
a lot has gone wrong since this unified 
Democratic government took the reins 
back in January. 
Let’s take a look at foreign policy. 
The Biden administration’s clumsy re-
treat from Afghanistan left Americans 
behind, who wanted out, and handed 
the country to a government staffed 
with terrorists that used to be locked 
up at Guantanamo Bay. 
Let’s take a look at energy independ-
ence. Or should I say energy depend-
ence? President Biden canceled our 
own Keystone XL Pipeline but cleared 
the path for a new pipeline for Vladi-
mir Putin. The amount of Russian oil 
that America has to import has al-
ready nearly doubled on the Demo-
crats’ watch. 
Look at the border. Illegal crossers 
are flooding across our southern border 
at an all-time high. The Democrats 
have interior enforcement arrests down 
to a decade low. 
But there is no question what crisis 
is at the top of the minds of middle- 
class Americans. There is no question 
what is keeping working Americans 
awake at night. It is inflation. Infla-
tion. The runaway prices and unpre-
dictability that Democrats’ policies 
have fueled. 
Ninety percent of Americans told one 
recent survey that they are somewhat 
or extremely concerned with inflation. 
We are a huge and diverse country. It 
is hard to get 9 in 10 Americans to 
agree on almost anything, but less 
than 1 year under Democrat policies, 90 
percent of America is worried about in-
flation. 
And it is no wonder. Year on year, 
consumer prices have risen faster than 
they have in over three decades. Last 
month marked the fifth month in a row 
that inflation has topped 5 percent. 
These across-the-board numbers can 
sound a little abstract, so let’s make it 
very tangible. In the past year, buying 
meat, fish, and eggs has gotten 12 per-
cent more expensive. A gallon of gas 
costs the average American $1.31 than 
it did a year ago. And heaven forbid 
anyone having to replace a family car 
this year; used auto prices are up 26 
percent. 
Even getting family and friends to-
gether for Thanksgiving is a much 
pricier prospect than it was last year. 
Turkey alone is an extra 25 cents per 
pound. Factor in all the fixings, and 
some estimates project a feast next 
week will run families up to 15 percent 
more than it did last year. 
For a while, the White House tried to 
downplay the problem. President Biden 
and his team told American families 
that costs weren’t really rising as 
much as it seemed; or that, OK, costs 
were rising, but it would only last a 
few months; or, as some liberals ar-
gued, that if you remove food costs, 
housing costs, and transportation costs 
from the equation, inflation really 
wasn’t all that bad. 
Some have tried to argue that ramp-
ant inflation is actually a high-class 
problem to have because at least we 
aren’t in a recession. I am not kidding. 
I guess they think working Americans 
should stop complaining and be grate-
ful things aren’t even worse. 
But a sad irony is that inflation is 
exactly the opposite of a high-class 
problem. Inflation is like a huge, re-
gressive tax hike that hits the middle 
class, the working class, and the poor 
far more than it hurts wealthy people. 
The three biggest drivers of the stag-
gering 6.2 percent inflation rate we

logged last month were housing, trans-
portation, and food. These are not lux-
uries, they are essentials, and they 
take up a much bigger share of fami-
lies’ budgets from the middle class on 
down. 
The Democrats’ inflation is func-
tioning like an ultrapunitive tax on 
American families who can least afford 
it—exactly the opposite of a ‘‘high- 
class problem.’’ 
It didn’t have to be this way. The in-
flation spike wasn’t just predictable; it 
was, in fact, predicted. This past 
spring, I warned my Democratic col-
leagues right here on the floor that 
their unbelievably expensive and poor-
ly 
targeted 
spending 
bill 
that 
masqueraded as COVID relief would 
turn our strong economic recovery into 
an inflationary mess. Many of my Re-
publican colleagues said the same 
thing. But Democrats didn’t have to 
take our word for it; even their own fa-
vorite liberal economists, like Presi-
dent 
Clinton’s 
Treasury 
Secretary 
Larry Summers and President Obama’s 
CEA Chairman Jason Furman warned 
that liberal bill might supercharge in-
flation. 
Now, our Democratic colleagues want 
to ram through another, even bigger, 
reckless 
taxing-and-spending 
spree 
that would make inflation even worse. 
Many of those same liberal economists 
support this new spending spree be-
cause of all the leftwing goodies that 
are packed into it, but even they large-
ly admit—these who support this new 
leftwing proposal—even they admit the 
package would make inflation even 
worse next year. 
Steven Rattner, a senior economic 
adviser to President Obama, just wrote 
in the New York Times that ‘‘The 
original sin’’—the original sin—‘‘was 
the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan. 
. . . That has contributed materially to 
today’s inflation levels.’’ He goes on to 
say that Democrats’ new taxing-and- 
spending spree ‘‘can be deemed ‘paid 
for’ only if one embraces budget gim-
micks, like assuming that some of the 
most important initiatives will be al-
lowed to expire in just a few years. The 
result [is] a package that front-loads 
spending while tax revenues only ar-
rive over [the course] of a decade.’’ Mr. 
Rattner cites an outside estimate that 
‘‘the plan would likely add $800 billion 
or more to the deficit over the next 
five years, exacerbating inflationary 
pressures.’’ 
Now, the person I just quoted is a 
former 
top 
adviser 
to 
President 
Obama—by definition a liberal Demo-
crat—explaining that the Democrats’ 
new proposal as currently constituted 
would make inflation worse—worse. He 
says it is the Democrats’ proposal 
itself that needs to be built back bet-
ter. 
President Biden and his party have 
already 
brought 
needless 
pain 
on 
American families with their reckless 
spending. Ramming through another 
multitrillion-dollar, partisan wish list 
would only compound the damage. The 
hard-working men and women of this 
country cannot afford to be guinea pigs 
in a socialist experiment where Demo-
crats try to inflate their way out of in-
flation.

Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

Mr. SCHUMER. I move to proceed to

The bill clerk read as follows: 
Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 144, 
H.R. 4350, a bill to authorize appropriations 
for fiscal year 2022 for military activities of 
the Department of Defense, for military con-
struction, and for defense activities of the

OFFICER 
(Mr.

so ordered. 
INTERPOL 
Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, this 
Saturday, the International Criminal 
Police Organization, better known as 
INTERPOL, will begin its annual Gen-
eral Assembly in Istanbul. 
INTERPOL is a vital global law en-
forcement network that helps police 
from different countries cooperate with 
each other to control crime. Unfortu-
nately, it has also become a tool in the 
hands of despots and crooks who seek 
to punish dissidents and political oppo-
nents in an effort to turn other coun-
tries’ law enforcement against the rule 
of law. 
Rooting out this sort of abuse should 
be the top priority going into the 
INTERPOL General Assembly. These 
abuses make a mockery of INTERPOL 
and are threatening its continued ex-
istence. 
INTERPOL’s Constitution cites the 
universal declaration of human rights 
as the basis for police cooperation. Im-
portantly and significantly, Article 3 of 
that declaration forbids INTERPOL 
from engaging in any ‘‘activities of a 
political, military, religious or racial 
character.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S8322 
November 17, 2021 
All 194 member nations have com-
mitted to uphold Article 3 and the en-
tire INTERPOL Constitution. So it is 
troubling—as a matter of fact, it is 
even worse than troubling; it is egre-
gious—that INTERPOL chose to host 
this year’s General Assembly in Tur-
key, a country that has become one of 
the worst abusers of INTERPOL’s Red 
Notice and Blue Notice systems. 
Turkey has repeatedly weaponized 
INTERPOL to persecute and arrest 
government critics on politically moti-
vated charges. Journalist Can Dundar 
is a prime example. Mr. Dundar is one 
of Turkey’s most prominent media per-
sonalities 
and 
has 
received 
inter-
national awards for defending freedom 
of the press. 
In 
2018, 
Turkey 
demanded 
that 
INTERPOL issue a Red Notice for Mr. 
Dundar’s arrest. What had he done? He 
simply criticized his government. He 
had reported on the Turkish Govern-
ment supplying arms to an Islamist 
group in Syria. He was charged by a 
Turkish court with espionage and aid-
ing a terrorist group—the group was 
never named—and sentenced to 271⁄2 
years in prison in absentia. 
Thankfully, Germany has refused to 
extradite Mr. Dundar, but this is the 
sort of thing we see from this year’s 
host of the conference. 
In June of this year, Turkish media 
reported that INTERPOL had rejected 
nearly 800 Red Notices sent by the 
Turkish Government. 
A Swedish human rights group re-
ported that in 2016, after the failed 
coup in Turkey, the Turkish Govern-
ment 
filed 
tens 
of 
thousands 
of 
INTERPOL notifications targeting per-
sons who were merely critics and polit-
ical opponents of the government. 
Some of these people were stranded in 
international airports, detained and 
handed over to Turkey, where they 
ended up in prison. 
There are also alarming signs that 
Turkey is trying to leverage this year’s 
General Assembly to further its own 
authoritarian goals. This past June, 
Turkish 
Deputy 
Foreign 
Minister 
Yavuz Selim Kiran openly asserted 
that the General Assembly in Istanbul 
‘‘will be an important opportunity . . . 
[to] explain in detail . . . our rightful 
position regarding our fight against 
terrorist organizations and our re-
jected Red Notices.’’ 
Translation: Turkey plans to use this 
high-level event to mislead and lie to 
the international community. They 
will no doubt try to explain why Presi-
dent Erdogan should be able to hunt— 
hunt—down his critics in foreign coun-
tries, using foreign law enforcement 
through INTERPOL. This will be a 
travesty—one that indeed threatens 
the legitimacy and future viability of 
INTERPOL. 
Of course, Turkey is not the only of-
fender we could talk about. Russia, 
China, and Venezuela have routinely 
misused INTERPOL to oppress their 
critics. The case of Bill Browder, a 
fierce critic of the Putin regime and 
advocate for the Magnitsky Act, is 
probably the most well-known example 
of such abuse. Vladimir Putin has 
issued no fewer than eight INTERPOL 
diffusions seeking to have Bill Browder 
extradited—none of which, thankfully, 
have been obeyed. 
These abuses should not be allowed 
to go on. INTERPOL needs protection 
on behalf of countries that actually be-
lieve in human rights, that believe in 
open dissent and the rule of law. Pro-
viding that protection is why I have in-
troduced the Transnational Repression 
Accountability and Prevention Act, or 
TRAP Act. This is a bipartisan effort, 
with four Republican cosponsors and 
four Democratic cosponsors. This bi-
partisan legislation would fortify U.S. 
systems against INTERPOL abuse and 
would require that we use our influence 
to push forward due process and trans-
parency reforms at INTERPOL. Amer-
ican law enforcement should never be 
doing the work of foreign crooks and 
dictators. 
I hope that I can count on my col-
leagues in this Chamber to support this 
much needed legislation, and I invite 
my colleagues to be added to the co-
sponsor list. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from South Carolina. 
REMEMBERING HUGH K. LEATHERMAN, SR. 
Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, later 
this afternoon, I will be introducing 
with 
Senator 
SCOTT—my 
colleague 
from South Carolina, TIM
SCOTT—a 
statement for the record honoring the 
life of Senator Hugh K. Leatherman, 
Sr. 
We just lost one of the most distin-
guished members of the State Senate 
in the history of South Carolina. Sen-
ator Leatherman was a 40-year member 
of the South Carolina State Senate. He 
was the finance chairman, and his lead-
ership is legendary. With his help and 
assistance, the Port of Charleston is on 
track to become one of the premier 
ports on the east coast. He was indis-
pensable in recruiting Boeing, Honda, 
and Volvo to South Carolina. 
He was a dear friend of both myself 
and Senator SCOTT. I have never known 
a more effective voice for South Caro-
lina. He loved the Pee Dee, the Flor-
ence area he represented, but when it 
came to helping South Carolina, Sen-
ator Leatherman was always there. 
You could count on him to lead from 
the front. Trying to solve problems was 
his life’s work rather than creating 
problems. 
I want to let the people of South 
Carolina know we have lost a giant. 
There will be a big vacuum, and all of 
us in our State are going to have to up 
our game to replace the vacuum cre-
ated by Senator Leatherman. 
His legacy is just extraordinary. He 
touched so many lives. He led the ef-
fort to put $300 million up front to 
deepen the Port of Charleston at a crit-
ical time. I could go on and on and on 
about how he helped every corner of 
the State, from the mountains to the 
sea. He was a giant of the South Caro-
lina Senate. His voice will be missed. 
He has a record of accomplishment 
that is just, again, legendary. 
To his family and legions of friends, 
we mourn Senator Leatherman’s loss, 
but you have a lot to be proud of. Now 
is the time to celebrate this great 
statesman’s life. Senator Leatherman 
was truly a statesman. He could work 
across the aisle. He knew how to get 
things done. He used the power given 
to him by his constituents and his fel-
low colleagues in the South Carolina 
Senate for the greater good. There is 
no better legacy or no better statement 
about a politician than to say that he 
used his power for the greater good. 
The statement will be forthcoming 
from myself and Senator SCOTT. 
To his family and friends, we stand 
with you. You will not go through this 
journey alone. 
To my many friends in South Caro-
lina from the Pee Dee, you lost a great 
champion, and I will do everything I 
can to help fill that vacuum and void. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maine. 
NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT 
Mr. KING. Mr. President, I rise to 
discuss the National Defense Author-
ization Act for Fiscal Year 2022. 
I want to make two basic points at 
the beginning and then discuss some of 
the specifics of the bill. 
The first is the word ‘‘deterrence.’’ 
The cornerstone of our defense policy 
is deterrence. The best battle is the one 
that doesn’t occur. The best war is the 
one that doesn’t occur. And there are 
those who will say that this bill au-
thorizes a very large amount of expend-
itures. I can assure you that war would 
dwarf the expenditures in this bill. 
And deterrence is the whole idea of 
having a force that would convince any 
potential adversary that attacking the 
United States is a losing proposition, 
that it would cost them more than 
they would ever gain. 
That has been our strategy for many 
years. It is our strategy going forward, 
and I will talk about it in some specific 
terms with regard to this bill. But it is 
important to understand that that’s 
why we are doing this defense bill, is to 
provide and strengthen and ensure that 
this country has the forces and the 
weapons that are necessary to deter 
any potential adversary. 
The second concept that, generally, I 
want to discuss is consensus. When I go 
home to Maine, people are amazed that 
we do anything together, because all 
they see on the TV news and read in 
the newspapers is about conflict—bick-
ering, arguing, differing. Why can’t 
they get anything done? What they 
don’t know is that we do get a great 
deal done, and a lot of it is by unani-
mous consent, by consensus. 
This bill is a good example. This is 
the 61st year that the National Defense 
Authorization Act has come to Con-
gress, and we hope it is going to pass 
this year. For the past 60 years, every 
single year, we have passed a National 
Defense Authorization.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S8323 
November 17, 2021 
And we usually—well, not usually, 
not almost always—we always pass 
them on a bipartisan basis. This bill 
came out of the committee 25 to 1. 
That is pretty close to unanimous. And 
we always get substantial support in 
our committee, the Armed Services 
Committee, but also on the floor of the 
United States Senate. 
Why? 
Because the Members of this body, 
just as the people across this country, 
are committed to those who serve in 
uniform, and they are committed to 
the idea of peace and the idea of deter-
ring adversaries and avoiding conflict 
and war. 
They all think that all we do is 
argue, and this bill is proof that that is 
not the case. 
When I first got here, my first two 
chairs of the Armed Services Com-
mittee were Carl Levin and John 
McCain, Senators who represented, in 
my mind, the best of the tradition of 
this Senate. They argued fiercely in 
favor of their positions, worked hard to 
resolve conflict within the committee, 
and were absolutely committed to the 
values of the United States of America. 
Despite all the partisan differences 
that exist in the country, this bill is an 
example that we are still united when 
it comes to the defense of the United 
States. 
It comes on the heels of Monday’s 
signing of the historic bipartisan infra-
structure bill. I think it is interesting 
that the bill has in its name—it has a 
name, I am not even sure what it is, 
but everyone refers to it as the ‘‘bipar-
tisan infrastructure bill’’ because it 
was supported by bipartisan majorities 
in both Houses. And in this bill, we are 
coming together to do something simi-
lar, to support our country and, par-
ticularly, to support those who put 
their lives on the line to defend this 
country. 
And I want to stop there for just a 
second. We all go through life getting 
various jobs, signing up for jobs, apply-
ing, and then you sign a form and you 
join the company. There are very few 
jobs in our society when you sign on 
the dotted line, you are literally put-
ting your life on the line. Members of 
the military and first responders are 
the only people I can think of that do 
that. It is something we need to remind 
ourselves. In addition to all the other 
responsibilities that you are taking on 
when you join the military, you are lit-
erally signing to commit your life, if 
necessary, in defense of this country. 
I believe this bill is essential to pro-
tecting our servicemembers, the indus-
trial base which serves the defense of 
our country, and, collectively, our na-
tional security. The Armed Services 
Committee has produced a bill that 
will make our Nation safer and strong-
er. 
For example, taking care of our serv-
icemembers: 2.7 percent pay raise for 
military servicemembers and the De-
partment of Defense civilian work-
force. That pay raise is important, and 
if this bill doesn’t pass, it won’t hap-
pen. So that is one of the immediate 
reasons that we need to pass this bill, 
to provide a pay raise to our military 
personnel. 
They will also receive 12 weeks of pa-
rental leave for birth, adoption, and 
foster care placement of a child. 
One of the provisions that I am inter-
ested in is that there is substantial 
support in this bill for our naval infra-
structure. It authorizes funding, for ex-
ample, to Arleigh Burke-class destroy-
ers, which Bath Iron Works in the 
State of Maine will be able to compete 
for, and this, in furtherance, supports 
our Navy’s ability to deter adversaries 
around the world. 
It is no secret that the Pacific is an 
important area of potential conflict. 
And the Pacific is an ocean and it re-
quires ships in order to project power, 
and those ships are built here in Amer-
ica. And this bill demonstrates Con-
gress’ intent to support the Navy, to 
support shipbuilding, and to support 
the industrial base. 
One of the things the bill does is pro-
vide for a new—what they call a 
multiyear contract, where the Navy 
commits to buying more than one ship 
at a time, which gives them a better 
price per ship. That is good for the tax-
payers and also gives some assurance 
to the industrial base that the jobs will 
be there and the work will be there in 
order to maintain the support. 
We often forget that the companies 
that do these—produce these amazing 
products cannot be turned off and on 
like a switch. I have visited shipyards. 
I visited in Norfolk; I visited in Maine, 
Portsmouth, and at Bath Iron Works 
many times. And these are amazingly 
complicated pieces of machinery. I be-
lieve that the destroyers built at Bath 
Iron Works are quite possibly the most 
complex product built in America. 
And the people who build them have 
to know that they are going to have a 
job a year from now and 2 years from 
now. We can’t go herky-jerky from one 
year to the next. Once you lose a weld-
er who goes somewhere else, it is hard 
to get them back. 
So the maintenance of the industrial 
base, whether it is in shipbuilding, air-
craft, humvees, whatever the vehicles 
are, whatever the platforms are that 
support our military, it has to be done 
on a consistent and predictable basis so 
that those factories, large and small— 
and, by the way, there are thousands of 
small businesses that support these 
larger industries. They have to know 
that there is some future, and that is 
why things like a multiyear procure-
ment is very important. This industrial 
base is not something that you can 
turn off and on. 
There is a research provision in this 
bill that is very important. University 
of Maine is one of those universities 
that provides vital research to the 
military, because we always have to be 
thinking not about the last war or the 
last conflict, but the future. And every-
body in this room knows that the fu-
ture is going to be based upon newer 
and newer and newer technologies. So 
research is an essential part of building 
the strength of this country. 
I worked for the last 2 years on some-
thing called the National Cyberspace 
Solarium Commission. Our job was to 
come 
together 
to 
form 
and 
rec-
ommend—recommend—a 
national 
strategy in cyberspace to defend this 
country, which we did in March of 2020. 
A number of the recommendations of 
our commission were enacted last year, 
either in the National Defense Author-
ization Act or in other areas of legisla-
tion that we passed. And, this year, 
there are some really crucial ones in 
this year’s National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act—crucial provisions to defend 
this country in cyberspace. 
The next 9/11 will be cyber, and if we 
are not ready for it after all the warn-
ings that we have had, shame on us. 
Worse than shame on us; it will be de-
structive of this country. And that is 
why I am so proud that there are provi-
sions in this bill that will help us to re-
spond, that will help us to understand 
what is going on, will help the private 
sector and the Federal Government to 
work together to meet and defeat this 
21st century challenge. 
In many ways, cyber is a new manner 
of conflict. We have to reimagine con-
flict. Traditionally, we think of con-
flict and war as Army versus Army and 
Navy versus Navy, Air Force and Coast 
Guard, and now the Space Force. 
But cyber is all about the private 
sector. Eighty-five percent of the tar-
get in cyberspace is in the private sec-
tor, and they are not going to have 
their own army. So that is where there 
has to be a new relationship of trust 
and confidence between the private 
sector and the public sector in order to 
successfully defend this country in 
cyberspace. And, indeed, there is a pro-
vision, hopefully, that will enter this 
bill through the manager’s package 
that will deal exactly with that sub-
ject. 
This bill also secures the future of 
the nuclear triad. Strategic forces, oth-
erwise known as nuclear weapons, are 
hard to talk about. They are hard to 
think about because they are so hor-
rendous. 
But to go back to the beginning of 
my remarks, the issue here is deter-
rence, and we have had a deterrent 
strategy virtually since 1945, and it has 
worked. Thank God there has not been 
a use of nuclear weapons since 1945. 
Why? 
Because of the strategy that every 
adversary knows that they will pay an 
awful price, if they attack us, using nu-
clear weapons. 
As chairman of the Subcommittee on 
Strategic Forces, we have had hear-
ings, we have had discussions, we have 
had readings on how do we successfully 
modernize our nuclear triad—bombers, 
submarines, and missiles—in such a 
way as to ensure the vitality of the de-
terrent strategy. 
The problem is that all three of those 
legs of the triad have basically been

unattended to for 30 or 40 or sometimes 
50 years. And as they degrade in capa-
bility, so also degrades the capability 
of our deterrence. 
If the adversaries look and say, 
‘‘They are trying to fly 50-year-old air-
planes, or they are trying to defend 
themselves with missiles that they are 
unsure of whether they will work,’’ 
then the adversary says, ‘‘Well, maybe 
we can get away with an attack.’’ 
And therein lies a path to a horren-
dous nuclear conflict, which has to be 
avoided. The best way to avoid it is to 
be sure that our deterrence is credible. 
The only way to make it credible is to 
be sure that it is modernized. That is 
exactly what this bill contemplates. 
Another provision of this bill that, I 
think, is critically important is a sub-
stantial change in the military code of 
justice, with regard to sexual assault, 
that puts in place an independent pros-
ecutor system to take the decisions 
about moving forward on sexual as-
sault claims out of the chain of com-
mand and puts it in a special profes-
sional prosecutor’s decision. 
I think that is important not only for 
the practical effect, but for the mes-
sage that it sends to soldiers and sail-
ors and airmen and guardsmen that we 
are serious about this; that they can 
feel comfortable reporting violations; 
that they can come forward and that 
there is no danger that the complaints 
that they make will be swept under the 
rug. 
I think this is an important provision 
of this bill, and I want to commend my 
friend Senator GILLIBRAND, who has 
spent as long as I can remember—as 
long as I have been on the committee, 
which is 9 years, working on this issue, 
and, in many ways, this is the culmina-
tion of her work. 
Another provision of this bill that I 
am particularly interested in is that 
we learn the lessons from 20 years in 
Afghanistan. Senator DUCKWORTH has 
proposed the creation of an Afghan war 
commission, an independent commis-
sion, not made up of generals, not 
made of people who were in Afghani-
stan, but of people who can take a 
clear-eyed look at the successes and 
mistakes concerning our engagement 
in Afghanistan. I think this commis-
sion is an important idea. I was de-
lighted 
to 
support 
Senator 
DUCKWORTH’s proposal. 
Another provision that we hope will 
be included within the National De-
fense Authorization Act this year is 
the United States Innovation and Com-
petition Act, which we have already 
passed here in this body, but if we put 
it in this bill, it will then go to the 
other body, and there will be consider-
ation there. 
This is a critical piece of legislation 
to enable competition with China. And 
make no mistake, we are in competi-
tion with China. So passing that bill as 
part of the national defense bill, to me, 
makes total sense because we are talk-
ing about national security, and being 
competitive in areas like AI and chips 
and quantum computing is as much a 
part of national security as bombers 
and submarines. 
It also includes a provision about 
competition in the Arctic, which is one 
of the areas of the world that is open-
ing to competition and, potentially, to 
conflict. We don’t want that to happen. 
Finally, the bill reasserts the funda-
mental congressional responsibility—I 
almost said ‘‘prerogative,’’ but it is 
not. It is a responsibility of Congress 
to make the decision as to when this 
country is committed to war. 
In recent years—well, a little his-
tory. The last time the Congress de-
clared war was in 1942. We have had 
AUMFs, authorizations for use of mili-
tary force. This bill will repeal two of 
the early AUMFs that have been used 
as a kind of blank check by the execu-
tive to deploy troops and engage in 
conflict around the world. In 1991 and 
2002, there were AUMFs involving Iraq. 
If you go back to the debates of the 
Constitutional Convention, I think it 
was—I want to say—August 17, 1787, 
when there was a debate about the war 
power, and there were those who said 
the Executive has to have the power to 
declare war; Congress is too cum-
bersome; the Executive can only do 
that. 
There were others who said: Wait a 
minute. We rebelled against the King 
of England because we didn’t like the 
King and the prince being able to uni-
laterally take us into war. 
The compromise was to divide the re-
sponsibility. The President is the Com-
mander in Chief, but Congress has the 
responsibility to declare war. This 
power has not been usurped by modern 
Presidents. It has been abandoned—it 
has been given up—by modern Con-
gresses. This bill is a step away from 
what, I think, is a serious gap in our 
adherence to the fundamental purpose 
of the Constitution. 
So there is plenty of good in this bill; 
there is plenty to celebrate. I am de-
lighted to be able to support it. I have 
only just scratched the surface, but it 
is a kind of truism that you will never 
be successful in a military context if 
you are fighting the last war. You have 
to think about conflict in the future. 
In Maine, sometimes people say: We 
have never done it that way before. 
I am sure the Presiding Officer hears 
that in Colorado, and you hear it all 
around the country: We have never 
done it that way before. 
If that is our attitude, we are sunk. 
We have to think about what is coming 
at us, about what is in the future. 
Cyber will be part of any kind of con-
flict we may become engaged in, and I 
hope we never become engaged in a se-
rious conflict. Again, that is the entire 
purpose of this bill. It is to deter any 
potential adversary from thinking that 
they can successfully attack this coun-
try. 
This bill defends the interests of 
America. It defends the interests of our 
military and our wonderful military 
people who are deployed around the 
world and, as I say, who are putting 
their lives on the line for this country. 
We can come together, hopefully, in 
the next few days, in a bipartisan way, 
to pass this bill, to pass the word, in 
the words of President Kennedy, ‘‘to 
friend and foe alike,’’ that we will ac-
cept the burdens of leadership and that 
we will meet our responsibility to John 
McCain, to Carl Levin, to all those who 
have come before us, and to the people 
of the United States of America. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
ROSEN). The Senator from Missouri. 
INFLATION 
Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, one of 
the most striking things, I think, we 
are beginning to notice this year is 
that the holidays are taking on a real-
ly different look than we have seen in 
a long time. 
Actually, for about a generation now, 
we have seen more choices and, more 
often than not, declining prices, which 
has made it possible for American fam-
ilies to have things that, in the past, 
they had not thought were possible for 
them to have. 
The pandemic, of course, was a big 
obstacle a year ago, as people were 
forced to alter or cancel their plans for 
their families to get together. And I 
think many of us were really looking 
forward to a more traditional holiday 
season this year. Hopefully, that sea-
son still allows people to get together. 
But I think we are also beginning to 
see people think they are going to have 
to scale back their celebrations or be 
prepared to pay a lot more for them; 
maybe just simply paying a lot more to 
get there, to start with, as gasoline 
costs have gone up dramatically. I 
think we are about 46 percent higher in 
our gas costs than we were a year ago. 
For a lot of families, that is a deciding 
item of whether you can actually get 
to Grandma’s house or not. 
This time, the change in plans isn’t 
because of the virus; it is because of in-
flation and supply side issues that, 
frankly, the government has done a lot 
to help cause. 
Jason Furman, who was the Chair-
man of President Obama’s Council of 
Economic Advisers, said recently: ‘‘The 
original sin was [the size of the] Amer-
ican Rescue Plan.’’ 
According to Jason Furman, he said: 
‘‘It contributed to both higher output 
[and] also higher prices.’’ 
Now, what he was talking about was 
the American Rescue Plan. This was 
the so-called COVID relief plan from 
March. It was a law that the Demo-
crats passed entirely by themselves— 
despite there being a lot of warnings 
that the economy was already begin-
ning to recover—that put another $2 
trillion into the economy, including a 
lot of money that went to State gov-
ernments that, clearly, didn’t need it 
and local governments that, maybe, 
needed it a little more than the States 
did. 
We had States that were having all-
time high revenues, and we had already

helped States in a number of different 
ways. Then, suddenly, we had to beat 
all of that by sending money to States 
and sending $2,000 to everybody, al-
most, and thought that wouldn’t have 
any impact. 
I am not sure who we were trying to 
save in this effort for relief. There was 
no reason to believe, in March, that the 
economy wasn’t headed on the way 
back. What we did in March with that 
legislation was just pour more fire on 
an economy that was already about to 
roar back in a good way. 
The warnings were right on the 
money. In October, inflation rose 6.2 
percent over the cost of a year ago. 
That is the highest increase in infla-
tion in 30 years. 
A lot of Americans alive today and, 
certainly, a lot of Americans who are 
in the workforce today don’t remember 
the inflation of the seventies and the 
early eighties that made it just hard 
for families to keep up; that made it 
hard for families to buy a house; that 
made it hard for families to pay the 
basic bills. 
I hope that we are not going to get a 
strong reminder of that, but it cer-
tainly looks like we are. 
The prices for many of the things 
that will be on the Thanksgiving table 
are going up. The New York Times, 
about 2 weeks ago, had a front-page ar-
ticle that this would be the most ex-
pensive Thanksgiving ever. Then they 
went through that list of things to talk 
about that. 
The price of turkey, by the way, has 
gone down a little bit in the last few 
days. It was projected to be 20 percent 
higher. It is only 18 percent higher. So 
your principal protein on the Thanks-
giving table will cost 20 percent more 
or 18 percent more than it did a year 
ago. 
Other protein is even higher than 
that. Potatoes are 17 percent higher 
than they were a year ago. Green beans 
are 39 percent higher than they were a 
year ago. 
I don’t know if we are beginning to 
see a pattern here or not, but there, 
clearly, is one. 
Butter is about 30 percent higher 
than it was a year ago. If your grand-
mother’s recipe for stuffing—or, as my 
grandmother called it, dressing; we had 
turkey and dressing when I was grow-
ing up—includes onions, onions are 50 
percent higher than they were a year 
ago. 
So, between the labor shortages, the 
high costs of raw materials, and more 
expensive transportation, the food sup-
ply chain is just about as messed up as 
the rest of the supply chain. 
We don’t import nearly as much food 
as we may import other things, but 
that food supply chain isn’t working 
for us either. 
Now, shoppers are already beginning 
to see bare spaces on grocery store 
shelves. Places you were going 6 
months ago, when you had a choice or 
even 6 weeks ago when you had a 
choice, suddenly there is one item 
there of what you are trying to buy or 
maybe no items of what you are trying 
to buy. There is just simply not a 
choice that you can make at the store 
because the product you want to get is 
not there—and not just the brand-name 
product, the product is not there in 
growing cases. 
What are we going to see when the 
Christmas holiday—the holiday shop-
ping season really begins right after 
Thanksgiving. Black Friday, or what-
ever other day you are going to do that 
shopping in, I think you are going to 
see—American families and American 
individuals are going to see lots of 
challenges. 
Wait times for ocean freight—we 
have all seen those pictures now of the 
backup of ships waiting to get to the 
port in every port in the country— 
every port in the country. Wait times 
are about 45 percent longer than it was 
last year at this time. 
Shipping rates from China are around 
400 percent, four times higher than 
they were a year ago. Things that cost 
$2,000 a container now are much more 
likely to cost something like $12, $15, 
or even $20,000, just for the container— 
moving the container from where it is 
filled up to where it gets off the boat at 
one of our ports. 
Traffic jams at the big ports are a 
problem in every place. There is a 
shortage of 80,000 truckdrivers to move 
things once they get unloaded. 
We made it so appealing for some 
people to stay home from work that 
they have, at this point, still decided 
not to go back to work or decided to 
retire early. They were getting that en-
hanced unemployment check for a cou-
ple of years, decided that maybe that 
life in the truck, which is a hard life, 
or that life on the dock, which is a 
hard life, or that life at the grocery 
store stocking shelves, which can be 
challenging every single day, or any 
other job was just not a job that they 
were going to go back to. 
I mentioned President Obama’s eco-
nomic adviser earlier. Well, he said an-
other pretty revealing thing at the 
same time when he talked about sup-
ply-side problems. He said, and this is 
his quote also: ‘‘It would be foolish to 
count on a return to normal within the 
next year.’’ Within the next year. 
So things are not going to get better 
if we don’t get back. They are likely to 
get worse. 
Then he said inflation ‘‘is likely to 
remain uncomfortably high.’’ 
Now, I am not going to talk about 
what 
his 
personal 
economic 
cir-
cumstances may be, but if they are un-
comfortably high for him, they are 
painfully high for lots of families. 
So here we go again. By the way, not 
only was the $2 trillion bill done just 
by one party—not a single Republican 
voted for it in March. Not only did that 
feed the flames of inflation, but now we 
are right back talking about a bill that 
if every program was extended through 
the 10 years, it would be a $4 or $5 tril-
lion bill. It is impossible to understand 
how you wouldn’t see that as another 
thing that is going to really create 
great risk. We have had every warning 
sign we could possibly have. 
When Washington pays people not to 
work, it gets awfully difficult to fill all 
the open jobs. When Washington gives 
people money that Washington has bor-
rowed or just simply kind of made up, 
that is awfully hard. 
The predictions that have been made 
about what happens with excessive un-
employment payments, the predictions 
that have been made about money bor-
rowed and put into the economy that 
we don’t have, have actually turned 
out to be right on target. 
So Republicans are warning again, if 
our colleagues on the other side con-
tinue to plan to move forward with an-
other—however number you want to 
describe it. I think it is very fair, if all 
of these programs are extended, to de-
scribe it as $4 to $5 trillion. It is fair to 
describe it as $2 trillion, if actually you 
start these programs that people will 
like having government take this new 
responsibility and then think they can 
actually stop after 1 year or 2 years or 
3 years. 
Nobody believes that, and frankly I 
don’t know anybody on the other side 
who thinks that is the plan. They un-
derstand the plan is to have a $2 tril-
lion pricetag and a $5 trillion ultimate 
payout 
for 
the 
things 
that 
that 
pricetag starts to pay for. 
Nothing about being uncomfortably 
high—let’s talk about the pain that 
you could have as you tighten your 
belts not just for the holidays but for 
the foreseeable future. 
Transportation, food, home heating 
in the winter, it doesn’t get more basic 
than that. And if transportation costs 
go up, gasoline goes up 46 percent, food 
goes up 15 to 20 percent. Home heating 
costs are projected, in many places, to 
go up somewhere between 50 and 100 
percent. Even if you got a little bit of 
a raise at work, that raise is imme-
diately taken away by just the basic 
fundamental things you have to have. 
We need to work with our friends on 
the other side. We need our friends on 
the other side to see the warning signs 
of what has happened with what we 
have done, what has been done this 
year already, and exactly understand 
what will happen. 
If we do more of the same, we are 
going to get more of the same, and 
more of what is happening right now is 
not what people we work for need or 
deserve. I hope we get serious about 
the things that our actions create. 
With that, I yield back. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, I appreciate my colleague from 
Missouri and his remarks about how we 
need the other side to work with us. 
And that is so very true because this 
administration, the Biden administra-
tion, has refused to drag themselves 
away from the political posturing and 
move toward actually governing and

November 17, 2021 
addressing 
the 
problems 
that 
the 
American people would like to see ad-
dressed. They have sent this economy 
into the gutter. 
Now, think about it. Just a few years 
ago, we had the best economy that we 
had had in decades. Unemployment for 
women, for African Americans, for His-
panics hit an alltime low; wage growth 
at an alltime high. Now the economy is 
in the gutter. Our southern border is 
now in shambles. The hearing we had 
yesterday with Secretary Mayorkas 
was so dissatisfying because he did not 
have facts and figures and answers, and 
we see a country that is incredibly di-
vided. 
But at least the American people now 
know just how in denial the White 
House is about what is takes to be liv-
ing in the real world. Their constant 
attempts to downplay the mess they 
have made have had the opposite ef-
fect, and now everyone knows just how 
out of touch they are with anyone who 
regularly pulls in at the gas station to 
fill up their own car or darkens the 
door of a grocery store to buy the gro-
ceries that they need. 
Yesterday, I came to the Senate floor 
and asked the question: What will it 
take for the Biden administration to 
take the threat of Chinese aggression 
seriously? 
The evidence is staring them in the 
face, and yet they refuse to acknowl-
edge that there is a danger; that China 
is our adversary. Certainly, the Presi-
dent’s phone call did not give us any 
comfort in knowing that he under-
stands they are an adversary. 
And today, I have a similar question: 
What will it take for the Biden admin-
istration to take the American people 
seriously when they repeatedly warn us 
that the economy is in trouble? They 
are living the warning signs every sin-
gle day. 
But try as they might to convince us 
otherwise, this administration’s talk-
ing points are all about happy talk, 
better jobs numbers, and the pockets of 
growth. But this is not anything that 
is representative of the economy at 
large. 
Still, every policy that they proposed 
this year assumes that the costs of in-
flation are a myth; that inflation is 
concocted by Republicans; that it is 
there as a talking point to scare Amer-
ican families. 
How completely out of touch can this 
administration be? They are proving 
the point that they are elitists; that 
they live in a bubble. 
What they keep saying to people is: 
Oh, you know, it is a dollar here. It is 
a dollar there. It doesn’t really matter 
that much. 
But, of course, it does matter. 
Anyone who has taken the time out 
of their life to rear a family and any 
mother who gets up in the morning and 
she is trying to feed the kids and get 
them to school and shuttle kids into 
the minivan and then she is off to work 
and then they are off to activities in 
the afternoon, she knows that pennies 
add up to dollars, which adds up to 
hundreds of dollars, and it goes quick-
ly—in a hurry. 
I talked to someone last weekend. 
They were talking about how a man-
ageable trip to the grocery store now 
has the potential to just blow their 
budget. They are somebody who likes 
to use cash, not credit cards. They put 
it all in envelopes, and they plan out 
their expenditures. They are seeing 
firsthand what this budget is doing to 
their monthly budget for their family. 
The sad thing is, this is all happening 
just in time for Thanksgiving, just in 
time for the Christmas holidays. 
But, you know, you don’t need to 
take my word for it. My colleagues 
don’t need to take my word for it. Let’s 
look at the Bureau of Labor Statistics 
to tell the story. This is a Federal bu-
reau, and they keep this data. Their 
data is telling quite an interesting 
story. 
I have a poster here that actually 
shows you the percentage increase you 
are going to see. The Thanksgiving tur-
key will cost you 6.1 percent more this 
year than last. If you want to get a 
ham, that is going to be an extra 12 
percent. If you are serving veggies with 
the turkey and ham, that is an extra 
8.2 percent. The price of a cup of coffee 
for after dinner, that is up 5.7 percent. 
And the grand finale, the homemade 
apple pie is up 5.1 percent. And I hope 
that you weren’t planning on driving 
out of town for your Thanksgiving din-
ner because gas prices are up $1.23 a 
gallon since last October. Think about 
that, $1.23 a gallon—a gallon. 
Now, this is sticker shock every time 
you pull into the gas pump. It is stick-
er shock every time you go to the gro-
cery store. And, as you can see what it 
was last year, you are seeing these 
stickers on gas pumps all across Ten-
nessee. 
Yes, the Biden administration, they 
can say: I did that. 
Decisions that the President has 
made—stopping the Keystone Pipeline, 
moving us from being energy inde-
pendent and exporting oil to making us 
dependent on OPEC, of all things, so 
that we can drive our cars and heat our 
homes—it outrageous. 
I would encourage President Biden 
and my Democratic colleagues to re-
member that, when it comes to budgets 
and 
families 
managing 
their 
way 
through this inflation, they can’t have 
it both ways. 
Back in January, they told congres-
sional Republicans that their bipar-
tisan bailout bill was the only thing 
standing between the average Amer-
ican family and financial ruin. Now, 
the very idea that pricing and spending 
power matters seems extremely un-
popular with our friends on the left. 
Suddenly, they expect the American 
people to put on a brave face, to treat 
shortages like a minimalist trend, and 
to cut back where they can. 
Do you know what, Madam Presi-
dent? The American people don’t want 
to live in austerity; the American peo-
ple want to go to the grocery store and 
find the food that they need. It is stun-
ning, the attitude of the left. It is stun-
ning, the disregard that they have for 
average American families who are 
working hard every single day. 
Of course, people who are now strug-
gling to make ends meet could stay 
home. They could stay right at home 
this holiday season. They could park 
the car, cook a small meal, and swal-
low their disappointment. But do you 
know who won’t be doing that this hol-
iday season? President Joe Biden. You 
won’t see him making sacrifices to sus-
tain the narrative. 
I have a feeling I won’t see many of 
my Democratic colleagues passing on 
Thanksgiving dinner to show solidarity 
with families who couldn’t stretch 
their paycheck far enough for that 
Thanksgiving turkey. 
I would hope that something here in 
all of this data would remind you. The 
Bureau of Labor Statistics—that is 
where I am getting the data. I am hop-
ing it would remind my friends across 
the aisle that this is not about proving 
a point. This is about the average 
American’s growing inability to put 
food on the table. 
You may not have to worry about an 
extra $30 or $40 on the grocery bill, but 
most Tennesseans do worry about that. 
And for some people spending more 
isn’t even an option. 
It is time to adjust the priorities of 
the Democrats. It is time for this ad-
ministration to adjust their priorities. 
It is time for them to meet the people 
where they are and not where they 
think that the people should be forced 
to go by their socialist agenda. 
I would encourage my colleagues: 
Pay attention to what the people of 
this country are telling you. Govern 
accordingly. People are depending on 
it. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING

The

The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll.

for the quorum call be rescinded.

Day. I was in Wyoming and started 
Veterans Day the way I do every year, 
which is in Douglas, WY, in Converse 
County, at the American Legion. 
We raised the flag at 7 a.m. We 
kicked off a day of Veterans Day cere-
monies all around Wyoming. Last 
week, I visited with veterans all 
around the State. I will share with you 
the things that I hear all across Wyo-
ming. 
What I continue to hear is that since 
Joe Biden took office, our Nation has

world has become more dangerous and 
our Nation is now less safe. 
In August, Joe Biden oversaw the 
tragic and failed withdrawal from Af-
ghanistan. Because of the President’s 
weakness, 
incompetence, 
and 
mis-
management, the Taliban took over Af-
ghanistan in just a matter of weeks. 
Just before the withdrawal, terrorists 
killed 13 of our troops. It was the dead-
liest day for our military in a decade. 
One of those fallen heroes was Rylee 
McCollum of Wyoming. All of Wyoming 
felt the terrible loss of this 20-year-old 
marine. He was a statewide high school 
wrestling champ. 
On August 30, the Biden administra-
tion left hundreds of Americans behind 
enemy lines, in spite of the fact that 
the President said he wouldn’t leave 
anyone behind. The administration has 
admitted to the Armed Services Com-
mittee that more than 400 Americans 
are still behind enemy lines. 
Joe Biden’s Afghanistan surrender 
was a national disgrace. The con-
sequences are being felt all around the 
world. Our friends are furious. Our en-
emies are emboldened. 
Last month, we saw a hypersonic 
missile being tested. We see that an 
emboldened Vladimir Putin now has 
stationed 100,000 troops near the border 
with Ukraine. Vladimir Putin con-
tinues to speak of Ukraine as if it is 
part of Russia. 
North Korea showed last month that 
they can launch ballistic missiles from 
submarines. 
Iran will soon have much, much more 
cash than they did when President 
Biden took office. You say: How could 
that be? Well, one reason for the influx 
of cash is the rising price of oil and a 
weak enforcement of the sanctions 
that we have against Iran. It is easier 
for them to sell and more profitable to 
do so. The Biden administration is try-
ing to negotiate with Iran from a posi-
tion of weakness. 
Yet the most alarming developments 
are the strides being made right now in 
China. Since Afghanistan fell, China 
has aggressively flown dozens of mili-
tary planes over Taiwan’s air defense 
zones. The Pentagon admitted recently 
that China now has the largest navy in 
the world. China plans to build more 
than 100 new ships over the next 8 
years. China is also building about 300 
missile silos and plans to have 1,000 nu-
clear missiles in the next 8 years. 
China recently tested a hypersonic 
weapon capable of use around the 
world. 
These are pressing challenges, chal-
lenges like we haven’t seen since the 
Cold War. This administration has been 
caught flatfooted. 
At the White House, utter incom-
petence. At the Pentagon, complete 
mismanagement. At the State Depart-
ment, global weakness. No one has 
been fired. No one has been held ac-
countable over the withdrawal from Af-
ghanistan. No one has resigned. There 
has been no accountability. 
It is astonishing, but the President 
must still believe in his statement 
where he said it was ‘‘an extraordinary 
success.’’ He may be the only one in 
America who believes that. Our en-
emies are getting stronger, and the 
Democrats are asleep at the switch. 
The Pentagon Press Secretary was 
asked last week which is a bigger 
threat—which is a bigger threat— 
China or climate change? His response: 
‘‘They are equally important.’’ This is 
the Pentagon Press Secretary. This 
isn’t somebody at the EPA. This is 
somebody responsible for the defense of 
this Nation. This is not just false; it is 
absurd for this to be the policy of this 
administration. 
Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is fo-
cused on fighting so-called dissident 
ideologies in our military. The Chair-
man of the Joint Chiefs of Staff testi-
fied in Congress that he supports serv-
icemembers studying critical race the-
ory. 
Our enemies are not following that 
path. Oh, no, they are focused on win-
ning wars. The Biden administration 
seems to be focused on liberal fan-
tasies. 
Well, I believe it is about to get a lot 
worse. 
That 
is 
because 
President 
Biden’s vaccine mandate will likely 
cause the discharge of thousands of 
servicemembers. It is certainly a con-
cern of mine with our National Guard 
in Wyoming, as it is with troops 
around the country and around the 
world representing and defending our 
Nation. 
Recruitment was difficult already. 
Our troops are feeling the pain of infla-
tion cutting into their paychecks, and 
now the President seems to be deter-
mined to decimate their ranks. 
I fully support vaccination. I am a 
doctor. I am vaccinated; so is my fam-
ily. I am pro-vaccine. I am anti-man-
date. 
At a time when our enemies are get-
ting stronger, we don’t need to drive 
the men and women who defend our 
Nation out of the military. 
Now, the Senate has still not passed 
the National Defense Authorization 
Act. The Senate went Independence 
Day, Memorial Day, and Veterans Day 
with no action on the Defense bill. The 
majority leader now says the Senate 
will finally get around to it. Why did it 
take so long? 
The Senate has been debating a reck-
less 
tax-and-spending 
blowout 
the 
American people did not ask for, do not 
want, cannot afford, as prices continue 
to grow and go up and up and up, when 
the cost of Thanksgiving dinner is 
going to be the most expensive in the 
history of our Nation. 
And we are here in the Senate and 
the House. What are they doing? They 
are debating taxpayer dollars for ille-
gal immigrants instead of taxpayer 
dollars for American heroes. We have 
been debating taxpayer dollars for 
what Democrats call tree equity. The 
New York Times even wrote about it 
today. 
We ought to be debating national se-
curity. We should be talking about the 
U.S. Army instead of Democrats who 
have been talking about an army of cli-
mate activists and an army of IRS 
agents. 
We just honored veterans last Thurs-
day. We will give thanks again for all 
of them next Thursday on Thanks-
giving Day. 
It is time, today, for the United 
States to do right and for the Senate to 
do right by all of them. I urge my col-
leagues to focus on a bipartisan Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act, the 
Defense bill, for the defense of our Na-
tion. It is time we prove to the Nation 
that we do support our troops and we 
do protect them against—and protect 
all of us against—rising threats and 
keep this great Nation safe. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
BALDWIN). Without objection, it is so 
ordered. 
NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT 
Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, 
day after day here on the floor of the 
Senate and back in their States, many 
of my colleagues talk to the American 
people about how deeply concerned 
they are about the deficit and the na-
tional debt. They tell us that we just 
don’t have enough money to expand 
Medicare, to cover dental care for sen-
iors, to cover hearing aids, to cover 
eyeglasses. We just don’t have enough 
money to do what every other major 
country on Earth does, and that is 
guarantee paid family and medical 
leave. 
At a time when hundreds of thou-
sands of bright young people are unable 
to afford a higher education and mil-
lions are struggling with student debt, 
my colleagues tell us that we just don’t 
have enough money to provide 2 years 
of free tuition at community colleges. 
When we have over 500,000 Americans 
sleeping out on the streets, including a 
few blocks away from the Nation’s Cap-
itol, we just don’t have enough money 
to build the low-income and affordable 
housing this country needs. 
At a time when the scientists are 
telling us that we face an existential 
threat in terms of climate change, we 
are told that we just don’t have enough 
money to transform our energy system 
away from fossil fuel and create a plan-
et that will be healthy and habitable 
for our kids and future generations. 
Just don’t have enough money. 
Yet, today, the U.S. Senate will 
begin consideration of an annual de-
fense budget that costs $778 billion— 
$778 billion for one year. That is $37 bil-
lion more than President Trump’s last 
defense budget and $25 billion more 
than what President Biden requested. 
By the way, all of this money is 
going to an Agency, the Department of

Defense, that continues to have mas-
sive cost overruns year after year, 
wasting enormous amounts of money, 
and is the only major governmental 
Agency in the Federal Government not 
to 
successfully 
complete 
an 
inde-
pendent audit. 
Now, isn’t it remarkable how, even as 
we end the longest war in our Nation’s 
history, the war in Afghanistan, con-
cerns about the deficit and the na-
tional debt seem to melt away under 
the influence of the military-industrial 
complex. People sleeping out on the 
street, people dying because they don’t 
have any healthcare, kids unable to get 
the early childhood education they 
need—not a problem. Can’t afford to 
pay for those things, but somehow, 
when it comes to the defense budget 
and the needs of the military-indus-
trial complex, we just cannot give 
them enough money. 
But that is not all, and I want the 
American people to know this, as I sus-
pect many don’t. 
It is very likely that in the Defense 
bill or attached to the Defense bill, 
there will be a so-called competition 
bill, and this bill is a $250 billion bill 
that includes $52 billion in straight 
corporate welfare, with no strings at-
tached, for a handful of extremely prof-
itable microchip companies. 
Now, is there a problem in that our 
country is not producing the kinds of 
microchips 
and 
the 
number 
of 
microchips that we should? The answer 
is yes. It is an issue we have to deal 
with, but we can deal with it in a way 
other than simply handing money to a 
handful of enormously profitable cor-
porations with no protection for the 
taxpayers at all. 
By the way, I should also mention 
that as part of the so-called competi-
tion bill, there is also a $10 billion 
handout to Jeff Bezos, one of the 
wealthiest people in our country, for 
space exploration. 
Combining these two pieces of legis-
lation would push the pricetag of the 
Defense bill to over $1 trillion for 1 
year. I want people to remember that 
because when we talk about Build Back 
Better, we are talking about a 10-year 
bill. This is 1 year. 
Meanwhile, while there is limited 
discussion about the Defense bill or 
corporate welfare in the competition 
bill, Congress has spent month after 
month discussing the Build Back Bet-
ter Act, which on an annual basis costs 
far less than the Pentagon budget, and 
discussing whether or not we can afford 
to protect the working families of our 
country whose needs have been ignored 
decade after decade, who in many cases 
are living paycheck to paycheck, can’t 
afford housing, can’t afford prescrip-
tion drugs, and can’t afford to send 
their kids to college. We can’t address 
their needs—no, no, no—because we are 
too busy worrying about throwing 
money at the Pentagon and large, prof-
itable corporations. 
If there was ever a moment in mod-
ern American history when we need to 
fundamentally review our national pri-
orities, now is that moment. Whether 
it is transforming our energy system 
away from fossil fuels; whether it is 
guaranteeing paid family and medical 
leave; 
whether 
it 
is 
providing 
healthcare to all of our people as a 
human right, as virtually every other 
major country does; whether it is tak-
ing on the greed of the pharmaceutical 
industry, which charges us by far the 
highest prices in the world for prescrip-
tion drugs; whether it is addressing our 
crisis of affordable housing or pro-
viding childcare and pre-K to the little 
kids, now is the time to reassess our 
priorities. Now is the time to fight for 
real change. 
But instead of addressing these major 
issues that impact the lives of working 
families all across this country and 
that the working class of this country 
desperately wants, Congress comes to-
gether, Democrats and Republicans, 
with minimal debate, to support an ex-
ploding Pentagon budget, which is now 
higher than the next 13 nations com-
bined and represents more than half of 
our discretionary spending. 
After adjusting for inflation, we are 
now spending more on the military 
than we did during the height of the 
Cold War or during the wars in Viet-
nam or Korea. And I would like to reit-
erate, this is after the war in Afghani-
stan has ended. That is why I have in-
troduced an amendment with Senator 
MARKEY to reduce the military budget 
by $25 billion, down to what President 
Biden requested. 
Let’s be clear. This is not a radical 
idea. It is the military spending pro-
posed by the President of the United 
States and the amount requested by 
the Department of Defense. I look for-
ward to support on that amendment, 
especially from the deficit hawks, who 
I know are very, very concerned about 
the deficit. 
I should also point out that this ex-
traordinarily high level of military 
spending comes at a time when the De-
partment of Defense is the only Agency 
of our Federal Government that has 
not been able to pass an independent 
audit and when defense contractors are 
making enormous profits while paying 
their CEOs exorbitant compensation 
packages. 
Let’s not forget that in this so-called 
competition bill, there will be a provi-
sion which provides $53 billion in emer-
gency appropriations for the microchip 
industry with no strings attached. 
Let me repeat that. We are talking 
about more than $53 billion in Federal 
funds, and by the way, I suspect there 
will be more taxpayer money coming 
to these corporations from State and 
local government with no strings at-
tached. 
Do we need to expand the microchip 
industry in this country so we can be-
come less dependent on foreign coun-
tries? Yes. But we can accomplish that 
goal without throwing money at these 
companies with no protections for the 
taxpayers. 
In total, my guess is that five—one, 
two, three, four, five—major semicon-
ductor companies will likely receive 
the lion’s share of this taxpayer hand-
out. Those companies are Intel, Texas 
Instruments, Micron Technology, Ana-
log Devices, and NVIDIA. 
I should also point out that these five 
companies made nearly $35 billion in 
profits last year combined and spent 
more than $18 billion buying back their 
own stock. 
I should also point out that these five 
corporations combined paid their CEOs 
a combined $85 million in compensa-
tion last year. 
Further, it is important to point out 
that this is an industry that received 
nearly $6 billion in government sub-
sidies and loans over the years, and it 
is an industry that has shut down over 
780 manufacturing plants in the United 
States and eliminated 150,000 American 
jobs in the last 20 years—29 percent of 
its workforce—while moving most of 
its production overseas. In other words, 
over the years, in order to make more 
money, they decided to outsource their 
operations and, in the process, throw 
American workers out on the street. 
So let’s be clear what is happening 
here. In order to make more profits, 
these companies took good government 
money and then offshored good Amer-
ican jobs. Now, for that bad behavior, 
these same companies are being re-
warded with some $53 billion in no- 
strings corporate welfare to undo the 
damage that they did. 
That may make sense to somebody; 
not to me. That is why I have intro-
duced Senate amendment No. 4722, 
which would prevent microchip compa-
nies from receiving taxpayer assistance 
unless they agree to issue warrants to 
the Federal Government. If private 
companies are going to benefit from 
over $53 billion in taxpayer subsidies, 
the financial gains made by these com-
panies must be shared with the Amer-
ican people, not just wealthy share-
holders. 
In other words, all this amendment 
says is that if these companies want 
taxpayer assistance, we are not going 
to socialize all of the risks and pri-
vatize all of the profits. 
Let me be very clear. This is not a 
radical idea. These exact conditions 
were imposed on corporations that re-
ceived taxpayer assistance in the bipar-
tisan CARES Act, which passed the 
Senate 96 to nothing. In other words, 
every Member of the U.S. Senate has 
already voted for the conditions that 
are in my amendment. 
CARES was not the first time that 
Congress passed warrants and equity 
stakes tied to government assistance. 
During the 2008 financial crisis, Con-
gress required all companies taking 
TARP funds to issue warrants and eq-
uity stakes to the Federal Govern-
ment. 
The bottom line is that taxpayers 
should not just be handing out money 
to large, profitable corporations and 
well-paid CEOs. They deserve to ben-
efit as well.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S8329 
November 17, 2021 
In addition to making sure that com-
panies allow for warrants and equity 
stakes, this amendment would require 
that these companies cannot buy back 
their own stock, nor outsource Amer-
ican jobs, nor repeal existing collective 
bargaining agreements, and remain 
neutral in any union organizing efforts. 
Here is something else—I think peo-
ple think that I am kidding here, but I 
am not; this is really true—here is 
something else that is in the so-called 
competition bill that must be ad-
dressed. Unbelievably, this bill would 
provide and authorize some $10 billion 
in taxpayer money to Jeff Bezos, the 
second wealthiest person in America, 
for his space race with Elon Musk, the 
wealthiest person in America. This is 
beyond laughable, and I will be intro-
ducing an amendment to strike this 
provision. Frankly, it is not accept-
able. It is not an issue that we have 
discussed terribly much, but it is not 
acceptable that the two wealthiest peo-
ple in this country, Mr. Musk and Mr. 
Bezos, take control of our space efforts 
to return to the Moon and maybe even 
the extraordinary accomplishment of 
getting to Mars. This is not something 
for two billionaires to be directing; this 
is something for the American people 
to be determining. 
Let me just say a few words about 
why there is so much waste and fraud 
and abuse in the military. Again, I al-
ways find it amazing how, when it 
comes to programs directed at ordinary 
people, low-income people, all kinds of 
investigations and all kinds of lan-
guage about how we have to protect 
the taxpayer from fraud, but when it 
comes to the massive amount of money 
that we put into the Pentagon, not a 
whole lot of attention paid to that. 
One of the reasons that we have so 
many cost overruns and one of the rea-
sons that we have so much fraud and so 
much abuse is that the Pentagon has 
been unable to pass an independent 
audit 30 years after Congress required 
it to do so—30 years. 
I think one of the points that need to 
be remembered is that on September 
10, 2001, 1 day before the terrible attack 
on our country, then-Secretary of De-
fense Donald Rumsfeld said, talking 
about the Pentagon: 
Our financial systems are decades old. Ac-
cording to some estimates, we cannot track 
$2.3 trillion in transactions. We cannot share 
information from floor to floor in this build-
ing— 
The Pentagon— 
because it’s stored on dozens of technological 
systems that are inaccessible or incompat-
ible. 
Yet, 20 years after that statement—a 
rather profound statement by then- 
Secretary of Defense Donald Rums-
feld—the Pentagon has still not passed 
a clean audit despite the fact that the 
Pentagon controls assets in excess of 
$3.1 trillion or roughly 78 percent of 
what the entire Federal Government 
owns. 
Just this week, the Pentagon an-
nounced that it will fail its fourth con-
secutive financial audit in a row. That 
is why I have introduced an amend-
ment with Senator GRASSLEY
that 
would require the Pentagon to pass a 
clean audit this year. If it fails to do 
so, 1 percent of its budget would be re-
turned to the Treasury each year until 
it obtains a clean audit operation. I 
think 30 years is maybe just enough 
time to make that demand. 
I think that at this moment in Amer-
ican history, it is appropriate for the 
American people and for my colleagues 
here in the Senate to remember what 
former Republican President Dwight D. 
Eisenhower said in 1953 when he was 
President. 
As we all recall, Dwight D. Eisen-
hower was a four-star general, not a 
politician, who led the Allied Forces to 
victory in Europe during World War II. 
So this was no peacenik. This was a 
man who saw more death and more 
military battles than probably any 
human being should have to. 
This is what Eisenhower said: 
Every gun that is made, every warship 
launched, every rocket [fired], signifies in 
the final sense a theft from those who hun-
ger and are not fed, those who are cold and 
are not clothed. This world in arms is not 
spending money alone. It is spending the 
sweat of its laborers, the genius of its sci-
entists, the hopes of its children. 
That was Dwight D. Eisenhower, and 
that is what he said 68 years ago. It 
was true then. It is even more true 
now. 
If the horrific coronavirus pandemic 
has taught us anything—a pandemic 
which has cost us now almost 700,000 
lives—it 
is 
that 
national 
security 
means more than just building bombs 
or missiles or jet fighters or tanks or 
submarines or nuclear warheads and 
other weapons of mass destruction. Na-
tional security also means doing every-
thing that we can to protect the lives 
of ordinary Americans, many of whom 
have been abandoned by their govern-
ment for decades. These are people, 
right now, who are struggling to put 
food on the table, people who are now 
experiencing a lower life expectancy 
than was the case in the past, and 
these are people who, in many in-
stances, when they get sick, can’t even 
afford to go to a doctor. 
When we analyze the Defense Depart-
ment’s budget, it is important to note 
that Congress has appropriated so 
much money to the Defense Depart-
ment that the Pentagon literally does 
not know what to do with it. According 
to the GAO, over the course of 11 years, 
the Pentagon returned an astonishing 
$128 billion in excess funds back to the 
Treasury. 
And, over the past two decades, while 
we have funneled out money to the de-
fense contractors, it is important to 
note that virtually every major defense 
contractor in the United States has 
been fined for misconduct and fraud, 
all while making huge profits. Since 
1995, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and 
United Technologies have paid over $3 
billion in fines or related settlements 
for fraud or misconduct. Meanwhile, 
the CEOs of these large defense compa-
nies enjoy incredibly large compensa-
tion packages—in fact, on average, 
over 100 times more than does the Sec-
retary of Defense. 
I have also filed an amendment with 
Senator MARKEY
and Representative 
RO KHANNA, in the House, to finally 
end all U.S. support for the Saudi war 
effort in Yemen. This amendment sim-
ply codifies the prohibition on support 
for the Saudi war, and it already 
passed both Houses of Congress, in 2019, 
in a bipartisan way. At that time and 
in 2019, various officials now in the 
Biden-Harris administration signed a 
letter supporting this measure. The 
House has already passed this amend-
ment for the third consecutive year. It 
is long overdue for this provision to be 
included in the final Defense policy bill 
that is sent to the President’s desk. 
In addition to Yemen, I have long-
standing concerns about the situation 
in Gaza. That is why I have introduced 
an amendment to request a series of re-
ports on the humanitarian crisis in 
Gaza and on steps that the United 
States can take to ease that crisis and 
bring desperately needed humanitarian 
and reconstruction aid to the Pales-
tinian people in Gaza. 
I would also point out that, when I 
talk about healthcare, I talk about 
dental 
care, 
and 
I 
think 
most 
healthcare experts understand that 
dental care is part of healthcare. In my 
home State of Vermont, veterans who 
are eligible for dental care at the VA 
have no access to a VA dental facility. 
That is why I have introduced an 
amendment to the NDAA to require 
the Department of Veterans Affairs to 
maintain a dental clinic in every State 
of this country so that all veterans 
have access to the dental care that 
they need. 
I believe in a strong military, but I 
do not believe that we can keep throw-
ing more money into the Pentagon 
than it needs at a time when working 
families all across this country are 
struggling to put food on the table for 
their kids and when 140 million Ameri-
cans can’t afford the basic necessities 
of life without going into debt. 
In 1967, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., 
warned us that ‘‘a nation that con-
tinues year after year to spend more 
money on military defense than on pro-
grams of social uplift is approaching 
spiritual death.’’ 
Dr. King was right. That was true in 
1967. It is true today. 
Let me just conclude with another 
quote from one of the great Republican 
Presidents in American history, and he 
is Dwight D. Eisenhower. This is what 
he said as he was leaving office back in 
1961. 
He said: 
In the councils of government, we must 
guard against the acquisition of unwarranted 
influence, whether sought or unsought, by 
the military industrial complex. The poten-
tial for the disastrous rise of misplaced 
power exists and will persist.

That was Dwight Eisenhower, and 
what he was talking about was the in-
credible power then of the military-in-
dustrial 
complex—of 
the 
revolving 
door, where people go from the mili-
tary into defense companies. It was 
true then; it is truer now; and that 
truth is manifested in the fact that we 
have a bill which is now spending $25 
billion more than the President of the 
United States requested. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The jun-
ior Senator from Florida. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 3224 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam Presi-
dent, as empty shelves grow more and 
more common, prices are surging high-
er, and small businesses can’t access 
the goods they need to serve their cus-
tomers. Joe Biden’s supply chain and 
inflation crises are devastating for so 
many Americans, but it is our poorest 
families—those on low and fixed in-
comes, like mine growing up—who are 
hurt the most. 
Just last week, we saw the new CPI 
inflation data come out. Rates are the 
highest they have been in more than 30 
years. Every month, when I see Biden’s 
new inflation numbers come out—and 
they are always worse than the month 
before—I think about my mom. Grow-
ing up, I watched my mom struggle 
every day just to put food on the table 
and make ends meet for our family. 
Now countless families across America 
are dealing with that same struggle 
today all because of Joe Biden’s reck-
less, socialist policies, like his uncon-
stitutional vaccine mandates. These 
policies are fueling inflation and the 
current supply chain crisis, but Biden 
and his administration do absolutely 
nothing to fix it. 
Throughout my years in business and 
8 years as the Governor of Florida, I 
learned that, when you are trying to 
solve a problem, the best place to start 
is by bringing people together. When 
hurricanes devastated Florida, and we 
had to deal with restoring power and 
communication services and getting 
resources where they were needed 
most, we brought people together and 
got to work to solve problems, but you 
don’t see any of that with this adminis-
tration. 
Just look at inflation. I have been 
talking about inflation nonstop all 
year, and it is getting worse and worse 
and worse. Biden has totally ignored it. 
His administration has attacked people 
like Larry Summers and me. Larry 
Summers is a Clinton-Obama appointee 
who warned early on that reckless 
spending was going to fuel a massive 
inflation crisis. 
Now we are seeing the same thing 
with Biden’s supply chain crisis. I have 
called 
on 
Commerce 
Secretary 
Raimondo 
and 
Transportation 
Sec-
retary Buttigieg to come before the 
Commerce 
Committee 
and 
testify 
about what they are doing to resolve 
this problem. They haven’t shown up. 
We haven’t had a single hearing on this 
crisis in the Commerce Committee. I 
have seen them on TV dismiss the se-
verity of the problem. I was surprised 
to see that Secretary Buttigieg had 
time to attend a bill signing but still 
hasn’t been to California to get work-
ing on the massive supply chain issues 
that are stranding dozens of ships off 
the California coast. 
Unlike the Biden administration, I 
am not going to sit around and play TV 
commentator. Families in Florida ex-
pect and deserve more than that. That 
is why I was proud to partner with my 
friend and colleague Congressman CAR-
LOS GIMENEZ to introduce the Supply 
Chain Emergency Response Act to get 
products flowing to American families 
and businesses again. Our legislation is 
simple and common sense. Congress 
passed the CARES Act to help our 
economy survive the effects of COVID 
and the economic lockdowns. We know 
that much of that money remains 
unspent and that it could be used for 
far more important purposes. 
We also know that there are dozens 
of ships waiting to dock and be un-
loaded at California ports right now. 
Our bill would redirect $125 million of 
unspent, unobligated CARES Act funds 
to help pay for the costs of moving 
cargo ships, which are waiting to dock 
on the west coast, through the Panama 
Canal, so they can dock along the east 
coast, including in States like Florida. 
I am going to be clear. This bill does 
nothing to mandate that ships be redi-
rected to the east coast. It simply pro-
vides an option and the funding to off-
set some of the costs. The bill would 
also allow Governors to use their 
unspent and unobligated CARES Act 
funds to offset port fees and other re-
lated State-level expenses. It is the 
pretty simple idea of using the money 
meant to help with the economic re-
covery to actually help with the eco-
nomic recovery. 
Just last week, at the Port of Palm 
Beach, I had a meeting with port and 
business leaders who are seeing the 
delays and effects firsthand. Their 
businesses are hurting and are left 
waiting for weeks and months for the 
resources they need to run their busi-
nesses and serve their customers. We 
need a solution, and Florida’s ports are 
ready and able to help with this crisis, 
and with the holidays getting closer 
and closer, we can’t waste any more 
time. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Senate proceed to the 
immediate consideration of S. 3224, 
which is at the desk. Further, I ask 
unanimous consent that the bill be 
considered read a third time and passed 
and that the motion to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The junior Senator from Washington. 
Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, 
reserving the right to object, I know 
my colleague—well, I assume my col-
league is sincere about his interest in 
doing something about our issues of 
port 
congestion 
and 
supply 
chain 
issues, but I disagree with his approach 
here today. 
I have, personally, worked very hard 
on increasing the amount of invest-
ment in port infrastructure that was in 
the bill—just signed by the President 
on Monday—that helps to increase port 
capacity around the United States. 
Why? Because we have seen, even in a 
pandemic, an increase in trade and port 
activities. So, yes, we have to invest in 
our infrastructure. 
I take disagreement with my col-
league’s 
characterization 
that 
the 
President hasn’t done anything be-
cause the President has helped at L.A.- 
Long Beach in reducing the congestion, 
and he has put in place a better COVID 
response process. My colleagues need 
to understand that longshoremen died 
in the COVID pandemic while deliv-
ering goods and products to us in the 
United States of America. They died. 
So getting a better response in vac-
cination for people working on our 
docks is incredibly important. So the 
President has done something. He has 
got a better COVID response; he has 
basically helped at reducing conges-
tion; and he has got a plan to invest in 
our ports all over the United States of 
America. 
I know my colleague wishes that it 
would be so simple, but these shipping 
companies are reporting more than $200 
billion in profit—$200 billion in profit 
even during the pandemic. So they are 
not lacking for money. And, if they 
wanted to go to those ports, they would 
go to those ports. We heard from one of 
the big shipping associations that 
going anywhere, just to say that you 
want to go there when there are 
logistical and cost reasons that don’t 
likely bear out, eventually, the cus-
tomer really just wants to go where 
the customer wants to go. 
That is why it is so important to in-
vest in our ports. That is why we led 
the charge for a $2.25 billion invest-
ment. Why? Because 95 percent of con-
sumers live outside of the United 
States. And if we want to be involved 
in the trade economy, we should invest 
in our infrastructure to get product to 
and from our citizens, to other citizens 
of the world, the 95 percent who live 
outside of the United States. 
So I don’t think giving shippers—who 
are having a recordbreaking profit 
year—more money is going to make 
them go to other ports. So I do hope 
that we continue to look at ways to 
catch up from the fact that production 
in many areas of our economy were off. 
There is no bigger example than the 8- 
percent reduction in oil from OPEC in 
2020. 
Talk about something we need to ad-
dress, my colleagues and I sent a letter 
to President Trump about high oil 
prices in 2018, and we recommended 
these various things that the President 
should do: leverage a relationship with 
the Saudi Crown Prince to urge them 
to increase capacity in world oil sup-
plies, make sure the energy Secretary

is communicating that with Vienna 
and OPEC nations, initiate world-trade 
disputes regarding countries’ anti-com-
petitive practices, work with our Euro-
pean allies and China and make sure 
that they are working on this issue. We 
just had a hearing this morning asking 
the FTC, if they do see any kind of ma-
nipulation or moving of supply, please 
investigate it; and, in this case, we 
said, Abandon the Trump administra-
tion’s rollback of fuel economy stand-
ards. 
Because guess what Americans want 
when there are high oil prices? They 
want fuel-efficient cars. 
That also is what we just legislated, 
and that is why we need to keep work-
ing on this issue, because as long as we 
are in a world oil market, and as long 
as we are under these pressures of 
OPEC, we are never going to win the 
day. The best way to win the day is to 
get an economy that is less dependent 
on those prices being impacted by 
OPEC. 
Now, I may shock some people here 
this afternoon, but I am for getting rid 
of the Trump 301 tariffs. These have 
cost us enormously in the Pacific 
Northwest—higher seafood costs, high-
er equipment costs, higher cost on ag-
riculture products, higher costs on 
aerospace. 
So we have had the two dilemmas of 
a COVID pandemic taking a workforce 
out of production, literally. I don’t 
know if my colleague supported the aid 
to the airline industry or not, but basi-
cally COVID hit, it ended up costing 
over 15,000 jobs in the aerospace sector 
in my State—gone, gone, gone. So not 
here today. 
If you imagine, if that happened with 
the airline production—why? Because 
what airline was going to buy a new 
plane? It wasn’t going to happen. 
People are saying now they don’t 
think it is going to happen until 2023 or 
2024, even though there are some an-
nouncements happening now. In gen-
eral, people don’t think that the airline 
sector is going to recover to where it 
was before for several years. 
So just imagine if every other sector 
did the same thing, that reduced their 
workforce in response to COVID, and 
now we are seeing the impacts of that. 
So what do we do? Let’s be smart 
about each of these cost areas and fig-
ure out what we can do to reduce those 
costs. 
Giving $125 million to basically the 
shipping companies of the world that 
basically have made record profits— 
one company said that was the biggest 
profit last year that they have made in 
117 years. OK. So they don’t need more 
money to just go from LA, Long Beach 
to Miami. 
But I want the Senator of Florida to 
know I actually believe in his port 
economy. I don’t know what is going to 
happen to the port economies of the 
world. I don’t know if we are going to 
switch dynamics. 
We have supported freight invest-
ment because freight can’t wait. If you 
don’t have good freight movement, you 
are going to lose to some other coun-
try. So we supported that. 
In fact, I see my colleague from 
Maryland here. The director for the 
Port of Baltimore came and became 
the director of the Port of Seattle. And 
I said: Do you think if we invest in 
freight, moving freight, somehow we 
might lose to the west coast and other 
places? 
He said: The business is just going to 
continue to grow, and everybody will 
lose if we don’t increase more effi-
ciencies. 
That is the objective: increase more 
efficiencies at every port. 
I know the Presiding Officer from the 
Great Lakes wants to do the same 
thing, increase the capacity and effi-
ciency of the Great Lakes. Let’s get an 
icebreaker. Let’s invest in port infra-
structure. We led the charge. Why? Be-
cause I know that the Presiding Officer 
today knows that the competitiveness 
of your State in Wisconsin depends on 
manufacturers getting those products 
made and outside your State and on to 
a world market. 
That is what is going to help us with 
our economy and reducing price, is to 
get production up and to get product 
moving efficiently. 
So if my colleague—and I sincerely 
offer this—wants to help me, because I 
guarantee you not everybody on my 
side is going to call for this, but I am 
definitely calling for a repeal of the 301 
Trump tariffs. I didn’t approve them 
when he did it the first time because 
these kind of punitive tariffs just basi-
cally exacerbated the problem with re-
taliatory tariffs, and those retaliatory 
tariffs are costing us right now. 
I know that Secretary Yellen is look-
ing at this, I know that USTR is look-
ing at this, and I would just encourage 
the President to look at this. And I 
would encourage the President to do 
everything he can to work with our na-
tion countries to put pressure on 
OPEC, just as we did before, to try to 
address this issue on price. But let’s 
work not on reducing the cost to ship-
ping companies that don’t need any-
thing because they have seen record 
profits; let us instead invest in our 
ports and our ports economy. 
So, Madam President, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam Presi-
dent, I appreciate my colleague, and I 
am proud to serve on the Senate Com-
mittee on Commerce, Science, and 
Transportation with her. 
Just remember, what we are talking 
about here is a supply chain problem, 
and let’s not ignore a very important 
fact. That committee has not held a 
single hearing on this crisis. 
I have been calling for Secretary 
Buttigieg and Secretary Raimondo to 
testify in the Commerce Committee on 
Biden’s supply chain crisis for weeks 
and haven’t seen one bit of action 
taken to make that happen. I don’t 
think we can wait any longer. Amer-
ican families can’t wait any longer. 
Biden’s supply chain crisis is hurting 
American families everywhere right 
now. The President’s failed policies and 
unconstitutional vaccine mandates are 
stifling business growth, crippling our 
supply chain, and fueling his—his—in-
flation crisis. Restoring our supply 
chains is critical to getting the Amer-
ican economy rolling again and some-
thing President Biden doesn’t seem to 
understand, but we need solutions. 
I actually feel sorry that my Demo-
cratic colleagues have to cover for the 
President’s failures instead of actually 
helping the American people. Passing 
this bill today would have given us the 
opportunity to provide some needed re-
lief in the supply chain and help lower 
costs for American families who are 
worried about whether they will be 
able to afford Thanksgiving dinner and 
Hanukkah gifts and holiday gifts. 
We need solutions now, and today’s 
inaction is a perfect example why the 
American people don’t trust Wash-
ington to get anything done. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
NOMINATION OF DILAWAR SYED 
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, ear-
lier this afternoon, I convened a meet-
ing of the Small Business and Entre-
preneurship Committee as its chair-
man. We had noted an agenda to act on 
the nomination of Dilawar Syed to be 
the Deputy Administrator of the Small 
Business Administration. 
This was not our first attempt, and I 
am going to outline all the efforts that 
we have made to get a vote on Mr. 
Syed. But to my disappointment, the 
Democrats were there ready to vote on 
the nomination. 
We also had two important pieces of 
legislation that we were scheduled to 
vote on, and every Republican refused 
to show up, denying us a quorum to be 
able to conduct business. 
Let me share with my colleagues the 
state of play on this individual and on 
this nomination. President Biden nom-
inated Dilawar Syed to be the Deputy 
Administrator of the Small Business 
Administration on March 3. He is a 
well-qualified entrepreneur and a small 
business advocate. 
After reviewing his paperwork and 
ethics agreement, the committee held 
a hearing on Mr. Syed’s nomination on 
April 21. Now, during that hearing, 
Ranking Member PAUL raised serious 
concerns about PPP and Economic In-
jury Disaster Loan—EIDL—received by 
Lumiata, a tech company from which 
Mr. Syed serves as the CEO. After 
weeks of negotiations, I brokered a 
compromise between Ranking Member 
PAUL and the SBA that provided access 
to the company’s loan applications. 
On June 8, I personally sat down with 
Ranking Member PAUL
and a rep-
resentative of the Small Business Ad-
ministration outside the Senate Cham-
ber to review those documents and en-
sure that the loans were properly at-
tained, which they clearly were. The

November 17, 2021 
following day, the documents were 
made available to all of the committee 
members on the Small Business Com-
mittee. 
Now, what that record showed is that 
those loans were taken out in regular 
order, that they were entitled to the 
PPP loan and the EIDL. But it also 
showed something that was quite re-
markable. Mr. Syed returned the PPP 
loan without forgiveness. He was enti-
tled to forgiveness, but, as he said, he 
was able to get access to additional 
capital and didn’t need the government 
help and thought it was the right thing 
to return the loan without forgiveness. 
What exemplary action. 
Satisfied that we had resolved the 
issue, Senator PAUL agreed to my re-
quest that the committee schedule a 
vote to report out the nominee on June 
16. After achieving a quorum of Sen-
ators, I moved to report the nomina-
tion by voice vote, as requested—a 
common practice in the Senate. A few 
Republican members asked to be re-
corded as voting no, which is also a 
common practice in the Senate. 
However, we were later informed by 
the Senate Parliamentarian that the 
nomination could not be reported to 
the full Senate because a Republican 
staff member raised an objection that 
there had not been a rollcall vote in 
our committee. 
A new objection was then raised 
based on Mr. Syed’s involvement in 
Emgage, a nonprofit organization that 
supports the Muslim-American com-
munity. One Republican office even 
circulated an email that focused on Mr. 
Syed’s Muslim religion and place of 
birth. 
Two weeks after the meeting, on 
June 30, I received a letter from eight 
Republican members suggesting that 
Mr. Syed’s involvement in Emgage was 
evidence of an Israel bias and support 
for Boycott, Divestment, and Sanction 
movement—the BDS movement. This 
is 2 weeks after we have already had 
our first committee vote. 
Mr. Syed had a relationship with this 
company, and this company had no 
record of this type of bias. Mr. Syed re-
sponded to these concerns in a letter 
that he stated he is ‘‘a proud first-gen-
eration Muslim-American but also pro- 
Israel.’’ 
He clearly stated that he does not 
support the BDS movement and be-
lieves ‘‘Israel to be a major partner in 
supporting the growth of America’s in-
novative small businesses.’’ 
Several Jewish organizations have 
come to Mr. Syed’s defense. For exam-
ple, the American Jewish Committee 
wrote: 
The unsupported accusation that somehow 
Jewish businesses are those with ties to 
Israel may not fare as well under Mr. Syed’s 
leadership in the Small Business Adminis-
tration . . . has no factual grounding. In-
deed, he has specifically disavowed support 
for the . . . (BDS) movement. . . . AJC re-
jects the charge that simply an affiliation 
with Emgage would reflect negatively on an 
individual, organization, or agency. 
And AJC went even further and 
called 
the 
Republican 
accusations 
against Mr. Syed ‘‘un-American.’’ 
On Thursday, July 15, the committee 
again attempted to hold a business 
meeting to report out the nomination. 
We thought we had resolved all the 
issues. We resolved the issues con-
cerning the loans. Everybody agreed 
they were proper. There was no con-
cern about Mr. Syed’s views in regards 
to Israel. That had been resolved. 
So, Mr. President, I was puzzled that, 
on the July 15 meeting, all 10 Repub-
lican members boycotted the meeting 
and 
a 
reporting 
quorum 
was 
not 
achieved. We couldn’t take action. I 
couldn’t understand why because we 
had resolved the two issues—the first 
issue, and then it changed to a second 
issue. 
But it was not until a week later that 
committee Republicans changed course 
again and developed a new line of at-
tack, this time linking the nomination 
to PPP loans received by entities of 
Planned Parenthood. 
On July 22, all 10 committee Repub-
licans released the following state-
ment: 
The SBA has wrongfully approved nearly 
$100 million in taxpayer-funded Paycheck 
Protection Program loans to Planned Par-
enthood branches across the country. On 
June 30th alone, SBA approved four PPP 
loans to Planned Parenthood affiliates de-
spite a determination from the last Adminis-
tration that these entities were ineligible for 
the program. We will not allow a vote on this 
nominee until the SBA takes action to re-
cover the wrongfully acquired PPP funds by 
Planned Parenthood entities. 
Mr. President, I am going to go 
through in detail as to how these loans 
were not improperly given and that the 
ground rules we set up were followed 
by Planned Parenthood and other non-
profits of similar type of organization. 
Where they came up with this line is 
still somewhat of a puzzlement to me 
since my Republican colleagues were 
engaged with us in developing the PPP 
program and the eligibilities for the 
PPP program. 
Since that date, I have tried several 
times to hold business meetings to re-
port out the nomination, but Repub-
licans would not attend markups that I 
attempted to hold on September 21, No-
vember 4, and again today. On Sep-
tember 29, I attempted to discharge Mr. 
Syed’s nomination from the committee 
by unanimous consent—that is after 
our voice vote that had already ap-
proved his nomination—but Ranking 
Member PAUL objected to my request 
on the Senate floor. 
The Planned Parenthood issue pre-
dates the Syed nomination and even 
the Biden administration. It goes back 
to March of 2020 when this committee 
took the lead—the Small Business 
Committee took the lead in drafting 
the bipartisan CARES Act. 
I was proud to be part of a team that 
includes Senator SHAHEEN, Senator 
RUBIO, and Senator COLLINS. We sat 
down and went line by line drafting the 
PPP legislation that we are talking 
about. We negotiated back and forth in 
good faith on the provisions of this bill. 
It was truly a bipartisan effort. 
Republicans controlled the Senate. 
We worked with the Republicans, and 
we came up with a bipartisan bill to 
help America’s small businesses. That 
legislation 
made 
501(c)(3)s—non-
profits—and veteran nonprofit organi-
zations with up to 500 employees eligi-
ble for the PPP loans. This was a mu-
tual decision. We knew it had some 
controversy associated with it. There 
are faith-based groups that people have 
some concern about getting govern-
ment support. There are different orga-
nizations that people might have a con-
cern. But we felt that during this pan-
demic, it was important to preserve 
our small business entities, whether 
they were for-profit or nonprofit, and 
that was a bipartisan decision that was 
made by Democrats and Republicans. 
During the negotiations of March 
2020, then-Chairman RUBIO added lan-
guage to an early draft that would 
have prohibited nonprofit entities that 
receive Medicaid assistance from get-
ting PPP loans. This was presumably 
an effort to deny Planned Parenthood 
the opportunity to participate in the 
program. But because of the way it was 
drafted, it also affected a lot of non-
profits. It affected programs such as 
domestic abuse centers or homes for 
the disabled. It was soundly rejected in 
our group as not being a workable re-
striction, that we could not support 
that type of prohibition. 
So we negotiated back and forth, and 
we could not resolve the issue. Eventu-
ally this issue, along with other issues 
that we couldn’t resolve, was taken up 
to the joint leadership of the Senate 
Republicans and Democrats who were 
trying 
to 
resolve 
issues 
that 
we 
couldn’t resolve in our committee de-
liberations. It was at that level that a 
compromise was reached to add lan-
guage that applied the SBA affiliation 
rules to nonprofits—not the Medicaid 
language but the affiliate rules. We had 
no objection to that. We felt that non-
profits should be subject to the same 
restrictions as for-profit entities as far 
as whether they were truly inde-
pendent or part of just a national 
group, whether there was control on 
the affiliate. So we thought that made 
sense. 
In April of 2020, the SBA, under the 
Trump administration, released guid-
ance on applying the affiliation stand-
ards to nonprofits, which is where we 
are getting to the determinations made 
by Planned Parenthood. 
The part of the affiliation that ap-
plies to nonprofits relates to common 
management. I am going to quote for 
the RECORD. I have the full statement 
here of what the affiliate rules were, 
but let me just read into the RECORD 
the relevant section that applies to the 
controversies—I don’t think it is con-
troversies—the Republican controversy 
on Planned Parenthood. 
Affiliation arises where the CEO or Presi-
dent of the applicant concern (or other offi-
cers, managing members, or partners who

control the management of the concern) also 
controls the management of one or more 
other concerns. Affiliation also arises where 
a single individual, concern, or entity that 
controls the Board of Directors or manage-
ment of one concern also controls the Board 
of Directors or management of one [or] more 
other concerns. Affiliation also arises where 
a single individual, concern or entity con-
trols the management of the applicant con-
cern through a management agreement. 
Now, the question is, Does the na-
tional group control the personnel and 
board of the affiliate? That is how the 
rules apply. 
Planned Parenthood of America de-
termined its entities were eligible be-
cause it does not exercise control over 
its member organizations and does not 
have a common management. Each 
member organization is its own inde-
pendent, not-for-profit, tax-exempt or-
ganization with its own independent 
board of directors that is solely respon-
sible for the hiring and retention of its 
CEO. Planned Parenthood of America 
does not have the power to remove 
CEOs or directors from its individual 
member organizations. 
Now, Mr. President, this type of fed-
erated structure is common in the non-
profit world, and it is the reason why 
nonprofits such as the YMCA and Boys 
& Girls Clubs also qualified and re-
ceived PPP loans, forgivable loans. We 
recognize that they have a large na-
tional structure, but the individual en-
tities are small entities and are inde-
pendently managed and controlled. 
In May of 2020, under the Trump ad-
ministration, 38 Planned Parenthood 
entities received correspondence from 
Associate Administrator Bill Manger 
with a preliminary finding that the en-
tities may not be in compliance with 
the affiliation rules. 
To my knowledge, Mr. Manger only 
sent letters to Planned Parenthood en-
tities, not to any of the other similarly 
structured entities. Now, I say that be-
cause we now have learned that there 
was a list—a hold list of a much larger 
number of entities that there was a 
concern as to whether they qualified 
under the affiliation rules, but only 
Planned Parenthood received the May 
2020 letter, not the other groups that 
had a similar structure. 
The letter that was sent out is titled 
‘‘Notice of Investigation and Request 
for Records.’’ This was sent out in May 
2020 to 38 Planned Parenthood entities. 
The Planned Parenthood entities re-
sponded to these letters. They con-
tested the finding. Every Planned Par-
enthood company that received cor-
respondence in May of 2020 contested 
its findings. The letter is pretty de-
tailed in what it spells out. It spells 
out all the reasons why they comply 
with the affiliation rules, and it talks 
all about it, about all the different rea-
sons why they were qualified to receive 
their funds. 
Mr. President, it ends with this line. 
This is how Planned Parenthood re-
sponded to the May 2020 letter: 
I trust that this response resolves the mat-
ter. 
May 2020. 
Nine months later, under the Trump 
administration, no additional action 
that we are aware of was taken by the 
SBA to contest Planned Parenthood’s 
eligibility for the PPP money, so it 
was clear that the Trump administra-
tion decided not to take action. 
So where are we now? 
It is also important to note that PPP 
loans were not used by Planned Parent-
hood to provide any health services. We 
are not talking about providing health 
services here. The law is very specific 
as to what the funds can be used for: 
payroll costs, healthcare benefits for 
the employees, paid leave for the em-
ployees, allowance for dismissal or sep-
aration, interest on mortgage expenses, 
rent and utilities, interest on debt 
prior to February 15, 2020. 
I was somewhat puzzled by all of this, 
but in an attempt to broker another 
compromise, after dealing with wheth-
er the PPP loans and the business enti-
ty were proper, whether there was any 
semblance of concern about his atti-
tude in regards to Israel—having satis-
fied that, I made another effort to try 
to deal with Senator PAUL and the 
members of the committee to see what 
they wanted. 
Mr. Syed had nothing to do with 
these loans. Mr. Syed is fully qualified. 
The SBA needs a Deputy Adminis-
trator confirmed to deal with all of the 
programs that we have passed in the 
last 2 years to help small businesses. 
They need a confirmed manager to 
work between us and our constituents 
and make sure these programs are 
working effectively. 
So what else could I provide? Yester-
day, I invited all of the Republican 
members to come to my office—or 
come to the small business office and 
we would make available all of the in-
formation SBA has in regards to these 
Planned Parenthood loans. They will 
make it available—all the loans that 
were given out, when they were given 
out, what was forgiven, what was not 
forgiven, second-round PPP loans, all 
of it. I don’t know what else we can do. 
Not one showed up to review the infor-
mation. 
I can appreciate the fact that this 
issue may make Republicans who op-
pose Planned Parenthood politically 
uncomfortable. I can understand that. 
But Democrats also disagree with 
views of many organizations that re-
ceived PPP loans. 
Last December, the Washington Post 
reported that 14 organizations des-
ignated as hate groups by the Southern 
Poverty Law Center or the Anti-Defa-
mation League received PPP loans. 
These are legal entities that qualified 
for the program because we can’t draft 
it based upon the mission of a par-
ticular organization; we have to draft 
it in a way that those that are legiti-
mate businesses and operations can 
qualify for the loans. And we did that. 
We don’t judge who we are giving the 
money to, whether we like what they 
are doing or not. That is not what this 
is about. 
As I said in the committee a little 
earlier today, it is important for the 
Small Business Committee to get back 
to its bipartisan tradition. 
I hope that my Republican colleagues 
will accept the information that we 
have made available, work with us, and 
let’s get Mr. Syed confirmed. Let’s get 
him confirmed because he is the right 
person for this position at this time. 
The SBA desperately needs a confirmed 
Deputy Administrator, with all the 
work that we put on them, and all the 
help. Our small business community 
needs to have an accountable, con-
firmed Deputy Administrator so that 
they have an accountable person who 
can work with us to make sure our pro-
grams are not only administered prop-
erly but we get the information to 
modify these programs to make them 
work moving forward. We are already 
in the process of considering additional 
legislation. It is so important to have a 
confirmed Deputy Administrator of Mr. 
Syed’s experience in order to help us 
with that. 
I 
must 
tell 
you, 
Administrator 
Guzman is doing a fantastic job. She is 
one person. She needs a Deputy. It is 
time that we get this person confirmed. 
There has not been an articulated rea-
son why this person should not be con-
firmed. 
Mr. President, I know we have had 
this debate on nominations that are 
here on the floor. We are wondering 
why people vote against them. I can’t 
even get a vote in our committee on 
this because the Republicans won’t 
show up for a vote. 
I think, in respect for the system, it 
is important that the Small Business 
Committee have an opportunity to 
vote on Mr. Syed’s nomination, which I 
hope then would be on the floor 
promptly for confirmation. 
I see that Senator LEE seems to be on 
the floor. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER

KAINE). The Senator from Utah. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 3225 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, yesterday, I 
came to the Senate floor and spoke on 
President Biden’s vaccine mandate. I 
explained that I have now come to this 
Chamber a total of 16 times and offered 
12 different bills that would counter-
act, limit, or, in one way or another, 
restrain the vaccine mandate. I also ex-
plained that, unfortunately, each of 
these bills has been rejected by Demo-
crats in the Senate. 
I have spoken to Utahns and folks 
from across country who have ex-
pressed to me their frustration at mov-
ing goalposts and changing expecta-
tions in the middle of the pandemic. 
President Biden’s vaccine mandate, 
which has been halted now by the U.S. 
Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, 
happens to be among the latest at-
tempts to force Americans to make 
health decisions under the threat not 
just of unemployment but also under 
the threat of becoming unemployable. 
That is a taxing burden for anyone to 
bear. Anyone who has kids at home or

November 17, 2021 
if they don’t have kids at home, if they 
are just supporting themselves, these 
days all Americans are helping some-
one or something that they love, that 
they care about, and they ought to 
have the opportunity do that. They 
ought not have their ability to make a 
living threatened by virtue of a dis-
tinct religious belief or a particular 
medical concern or a particular desire 
not to receive a particular treatment. 
I will reiterate here what I have said 
before. I have been vaccinated. My 
family has been vaccinated. I believe 
that the vaccines are helping countless 
Americans be protected against the 
dangers of the COVID–19 virus. 
Just the same, there is a big dif-
ference between believing the vaccine 
does good and receiving the vaccine, on 
the one hand, and, on the other hand, 
saying that anyone who disagrees or 
who thinks that it is not right for 
them, for one reason or another, ought 
to be fired from their job and rendered 
unemployable as a result. That is very, 
very different. That is something that 
very few Americans would agree is 
right. 
In fact, according to a recent Axios 
poll, only 14 percent of Americans be-
lieve that someone who decides not to 
get the vaccine should be fired as a re-
sult of that decision. 
Now, in some lines of work, this sort 
of thing is already coming into play. 
For example, our military servicemem-
bers and frontline workers who sac-
rificed so much to care for and protect 
the American people during the pan-
demic are already being forced out of 
work. I have heard from many mem-
bers of our Armed Services from Utah 
who are being discharged under less- 
than-honorable conditions and under 
conditions that are in no way, shape, or 
form appropriate in light of their 
many, many years of faithful, honor-
able service to this country. They are 
losing their jobs—and not just their 
jobs but also their benefits, their dig-
nity, their ability to serve further. You 
know, I have introduced and offered up 
a bill that would help them, but Demo-
crats objected to that. 
On November 4 of this year, a couple 
of weeks ago, the Centers for Medicare 
and 
Medicaid 
Services—known 
as 
CMS—imposed a requirement that all 
healthcare workers at facilities par-
ticipating in Medicare and Medicaid be 
vaccinated by January 4. This require-
ment, if it takes effect, will affect mil-
lions of Americans in tens of thousands 
of care centers across the Nation. And 
unlike the mandate imposed by OSHA, 
which has now mercifully been stayed, 
at least for the pendency of the litiga-
tion pending in the U.S. Court of Ap-
peals for the Fifth Circuit, this man-
date—this particular mandate—gives 
no option for testing if someone has re-
ligious, moral, or medical objections to 
the vaccine. 
Now, let’s just think about this on an 
individual level. There are nurses in 
this country who worked faithfully and 
tirelessly throughout the pandemic, 
without 
regard 
to 
their 
own 
cir-
cumstances, in some cases without re-
gard to their own health, their own 
sanity, putting their lives at risk at 
times. They have gone to work caring 
for others, and they have saved lives in 
the process. They accepted the risk, 
and they were rightfully heralded as 
heroes for doing that. They still are he-
roes, and they still should be heralded 
as heroes. But many of these same 
nurses caught COVID at work and have 
recovered. They are, in fact, heroes. 
But now the Biden administration is 
giving them an extraordinary—and I 
would add extraordinarily cruel—ulti-
matum; one that I don’t think I have 
ever seen in government; one that I 
didn’t ever expect I would see in gov-
ernment. Those very same doctors and 
nurses and other healthcare workers— 
the same people we appropriately de-
scribed as heroes—can either get a 
medical procedure they don’t want or 
lose their current employment and any 
future realistic prospect of employ-
ment. 
Let that sink in for a moment. What 
if this were you? What if this were your 
spouse or your child, someone you 
loved? What if this were your friend or 
your neighbor? The truth is, these peo-
ple fit into all those categories. They 
are not our enemies. They are our 
friends, our neighbors, our family 
members, our loved ones. At a min-
imum, they are people who served val-
iantly throughout a pandemic, and 
they should not be punished; they 
should be thanked. 
These heroes will be thanked for 
their service with a pink slip and a 
boot out the door as they become out-
casts in the very profession that they 
have selflessly chosen and the very pro-
fession for which they have spent a lot 
of money and a lot of time receiving 
training and the very profession to 
which they dedicated their lives. What 
a tragedy. What a needless, senseless 
tragedy. 
These are not abstract anecdotes. 
This isn’t just hypotheticals, specula-
tion. No, not at all. I have heard from 
hundreds of Utahns who risk losing 
their employment if these vaccine 
mandates take effect. They are every-
day Americans. They are good Ameri-
cans. They are valiant Americans. Of-
tentimes, they are struggling to make 
ends meet and to feed their families. 
They are our neighbors, our friends, 
our caretakers, our heroes. They de-
serve the respect that is necessarily 
implicit in the ability to make deci-
sions for themselves, including these 
decisions for themselves. 
Additionally, as a practical matter, 
it is extremely foolish to be pushing 
healthcare professionals out of their 
jobs at the precise moment when our 
healthcare system is under such in-
credible strain. Hospitals are under-
staffed as it is. I mean, a lot of places 
are understaffed. Hospitals are particu-
larly understaffed even without this 
mandate. So requiring medical facili-
ties to fire perfectly good doctors and 
nurses and technicians is only going to 
further strain our system and place 
more Americans at risk of serious 
harm. 
So today I am offering my 13th bill in 
the effort to curb the vaccine man-
dates. My Respecting Our Frontline 
Workers Act would simply prohibit any 
Federal Agency from requiring that 
staff and healthcare facilities be vac-
cinated against COVID–19 as a condi-
tion of that facility being able to par-
ticipate in Medicare, Medicaid, and 
CHIP. But this bill would provide cer-
tainty to our Nation’s healthcare he-
roes and honor the sacrifices that they 
have made to help Americans in need 
at a time when we were, as a country, 
facing great need. It will keep our 
healthcare system strong during what 
is still a really difficult time. This bill 
is the reasonable, compassionate an-
swer to the current situation. I encour-
age my colleagues to support it. 
To that end, Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of S. 3225, which is at the desk; I 
further ask that the bill be considered 
read a third time and passed and that 
the motion to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Reserving the right to 
object. Mr. President and colleagues, 
sadly, this is the third time I have had 
to come to the Senate floor to object to 
Republican proposals dealing with far- 
fetched claims about vaccines. 
And today I am struck by one issue 
in particular because my background is 
working with senior citizens. I was the 
director of the Gray Panthers at home 
for almost 7 years. I ran the legal aid 
office for the elderly. I went into public 
service because of my passion for the 
cause of the elderly and trying to pro-
tect their well-being and keeping them 
safe. 
It is almost as if this unanimous con-
sent request ignores the extraordinary 
human toll COVID–19 took on senior 
citizens in nursing homes across the 
country: nearly 200,000 dead in nursing 
homes and other long-term care facili-
ties since the beginning of the pan-
demic—mothers and fathers, grand-
mothers and grandfathers. That is 
roughly 1 in 10 residents in those nurs-
ing facilities, according to an analysis 
of State and Federal data by the 
COVID tracking project. 
How many of those senior citizens 
died alone, without being able to spend 
their final hours or days with their 
loved ones? How many others of those 
fortunate enough to survive the pan-
demic were still separated from their 
family 
members 
for 
months 
and 
months and months in 2020? 
We also know that the risks to nurses 
and doctor and EMTs were massive as 
well. One major investigation found 
that more than 3,600 healthcare work-
ers died of COVID in the first year of 
the pandemic—the worst pandemic in a

century that our country is still wres-
tling with as we speak. Nobody in this 
Chamber should forget that just over 
the last week, there have been more 
than 1,000 COVID deaths per day. 
And in my view, it doesn’t do any 
good to unnecessarily suppress access 
to highly effective vaccines while there 
is a deadly virus circulating and mu-
tating around the country and around 
the world. 
Seniors who live in nursing homes 
and long-term care facilities are safer 
when the people around them get vac-
cinated. And I just hope that our col-
leagues will recognize the importance 
of that basic proposition. When Ameri-
cans are vaccinated, they and the peo-
ple around them, based overwhelm-
ingly on the factual evidence, are less 
likely to die of COVID–19. And every-
body ought to be interested in stopping 
this virus with these overwhelmingly 
effective vaccines. It shouldn’t take a 
requirement to get healthcare workers 
to protect themselves and their pa-
tients. 
As I close, I think—and, again, I am 
sad to have to come to the floor and 
get into this issue, but because of my 
background working with senior citi-
zens, I think it is bad for senior citi-
zens, bad for the elderly to continue 
these frightening remarks about vac-
cines and vaccine policies. They pro-
longed the pandemic. They led to more 
infections and deaths. 
With respect to the proposal that is 
before the Senate, I simply don’t be-
lieve Senators should oppose policies 
that would keep America’s elderly citi-
zens safer after the pandemic has cost 
so many lives of America’s senior citi-
zens. Therefore, I object. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
LUJA´ N). Objection is heard. 
The Senator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I appreciate 
the thoughtful remarks from my friend 
and colleague, the distinguished Sen-
ator from the State of Oregon. 
The Senator from Oregon and I have 
spent a lot of time working on a num-
ber of issues together. He and I agree 
on a number of issues and have worked 
together to ensure the privacy of the 
American people and make sure that 
they are protected from an over-
reaching government, one that some-
times has intruded on them in viola-
tion of the spirit, if not also the letter, 
of the Fourth Amendment. 
I remember when I first came to the 
Senate, the Senator from Oregon took 
me to lunch and we had a good chat. He 
introduced me to a lot of concepts in 
the Senate and has always been a good 
friend to me. 
I feel the need to respond to some of 
these issues. Yes, I, too, like my friend 
and colleague, the distinguished Sen-
ator from Oregon, wish that we didn’t 
have to come to the floor to discuss 
these things. I wish that it weren’t nec-
essary because I wish that we weren’t 
even talking about firing people, about 
people losing their jobs, becoming un-
employed and possibly unemployable 
as a result of Federal policy that re-
fuses to allow people to make decisions 
on their own. 
Insofar as my friend, the Senator 
from Oregon, describes the policy of 
firing people who refuse to get the vac-
cine as necessary to protect the elder-
ly, I would respectfully submit that 
quite the opposite is true. We are actu-
ally imperiling those who might need 
medical treatment the most, including 
the sick and the elderly. 
Insofar 
as 
we 
destabilize 
our 
healthcare workforce—which, make no 
mistake, this maximum mandate does; 
it does that unquestionably—remember 
that the CMS mandate that we are 
talking about, unlike the OSHA man-
date, doesn’t give any option to allow 
for testing, for example, if someone has 
a religious or a moral or a medical ob-
jection to the mandate. 
So what this really is going to do is 
it is going to take a lot of people out of 
the healthcare workforce and sideline 
them. 
Yes, this is going to be devastating 
to those individuals. You are suddenly 
taking away their means of providing 
for their needs and those of their fam-
ily. It would be absolutely devastating 
to them, as I mentioned a minute ago. 
This is also a field in which they in-
vested a lot of time and money—sweat, 
blood, and tears—to getting the edu-
cation and professional certifications 
necessary to work in a field that has a 
lot of requirements attached to it, and 
with good reason. It is not good for 
anyone, least of all the elderly, to de-
stabilize that same workforce. 
Insofar as we are going to talk about 
what is better for the healthcare sys-
tem, I just would respectfully reach the 
exact opposite conclusion of that pro-
posed by my friend from Oregon. This 
isn’t going to make things better. It is 
going to make things worse. 
My friend from Oregon also described 
the approach that I am taking of pro-
tecting the individual healthcare work-
er’s right to make an appropriate deci-
sion without government interference; 
described that and, as I understood it, 
my other efforts to try to curb the 
more egregious impacts of the vaccine 
mandates imposed by the Biden admin-
istration as somehow unnecessarily 
suppressing access to the vaccine. 
I want to make very clear that just is 
not accurate. I would state that as not 
at all consistent with what I am doing. 
Not a single one of my proposals would 
suppress access to the vaccine. 
Each time I have come to the floor 
and talked about these things, I have 
made very clear that I have been vac-
cinated. Every member of my family 
has been vaccinated. I have encouraged 
everyone I know to get the vaccine. 
The vaccine, really, is a medical mir-
acle of sorts, and it is one that is pro-
tecting a lot of people. 
Not everyone agrees with me. But 
the fact that they don’t agree with me, 
the fact that they don’t agree with 
President Biden or anyone else in gov-
ernment doesn’t mean they should lose 
their job for it. But it sure as heck 
doesn’t mean that firing them because 
they won’t get the vaccine and then op-
posing the effort to force their firing 
would somehow amount to an act of 
suppressing access to the vaccine. 
That is a logical syllogism that just 
doesn’t work. In no way, shape, or form 
would we be suppressing access to the 
vaccine if we liberated the American 
people from an overreaching executive 
who is insisting that people be fired if 
they don’t agree with the President’s 
officially sanctioned view on vaccines. 
My friend also noted that people are 
safer when they get vaccinated. I be-
lieve this is generally true. I don’t 
think it is going to encourage more 
people to get vaccinated by telling 
them that they are going to get fired if 
they don’t. 
Particularly with the subject matter 
we are covering today, where we are 
talking about the CMS end of the vac-
cine, these are people who work in 
healthcare. These are people who are 
highly educated in it, who have profes-
sional certifications, in many cases, 
graduate degrees in healthcare. They 
can make their own informed decision 
as to what to do. I tend to believe that 
people are generally safer when they 
get vaccinated, but that doesn’t mean 
that firing them is the right thing to 
do. 
Look, finally, my friend from Or-
egon—and I don’t use that term loose-
ly. He and I talk regularly. He was in 
my office earlier today, and we were 
talking about an upcoming game be-
tween the University of Utah and Or-
egon. When he refers to frightening re-
marks regarding the vaccine, I am not 
sure what he is referring to. I hope he 
is not referring to remarks debating 
the merits, or lack thereof, of vaccine 
mandates. Nothing about these re-
marks should strike anyone as fright-
ening. 
What I think would be frightening 
would be if tens, if not hundreds, of 
millions of Americans are threatened 
with getting fired based on their re-
fusal to get the vaccine. I don’t think 
we will ever reach a point where there 
are that many people who decide not to 
get vaccinated. It is certainly not 
going to be hundreds of millions of peo-
ple declining to be vaccinated. 
But whatever the number is, it still 
doesn’t make it right for the President 
of the United States to just decide ar-
bitrarily that they either have to fol-
low his medical advice and that of his 
administration or get fired; to choose 
between getting an undesired medical 
procedure, or, on the other hand, losing 
their opportunity to put bread on the 
table for their children. 
It is not constitutional. It is not 
within 
Congress’s 
power. 
Congress 
hasn’t exercised that power. It cer-
tainly hasn’t given that power to the 
President of the United States. 
Regardless of all those statutory and 
constitutional arguments, this is a fun-
damentally, 
morally 
flawed 
propo-
sition that says everyone has to get

this; and if you disagree, you will get 
fired; we will render you unemployed 
and unemployable. This is wrong, and 
it is especially wrong to do to our 
healthcare workers. 
Let’s not do this. I urge my friend 
and colleague from Oregon to recon-
sider. We can do better than that. The 
American people expect more. They de-
mand better, and we need to listen to 
them. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Hampshire. 
NOMINATIONS 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to discuss what 
are, sadly, the harmful impacts of on-
going partisan obstruction in the Sen-
ate. 
Earlier today, at the Small Business 
Committee, 
our 
colleague, 
Senator 
CARDIN, who is chair of the Senate 
Committee on Small Business and En-
trepreneurship, held a business meet-
ing—I think about the fifth one—to try 
to advance the nomination of Mr. 
Dilawar Syed to be the Deputy Admin-
istrator of the Small Business Admin-
istration. 
As we know, the Small Business Ad-
ministration is a very important Agen-
cy under the best of circumstances. It 
does great work, but during this pan-
demic, for the past year, it has become 
absolutely indispensable as we tried to 
address the continuing economic im-
pact of COVID on our small businesses. 
In order for it to operate effectively, 
in order for us to hold the Agency ac-
countable for administering the small 
business relief programs that Congress 
has designed to pass, we have an obli-
gation to ensure that the Small Busi-
ness Administration has a fully func-
tioning and Senate-confirmed leader-
ship team. 
Unfortunately, as Senator CARDIN 
and others witnessed just a few hours 
ago, Republicans, again, on the Small 
Business Committee—all of the Repub-
licans on the Small Business Com-
mittee—have orchestrated a complete 
blockade of Mr. Syed’s nomination, 
preventing it from even coming to the 
floor of the Senate for debate and con-
sideration. 
And what is so confusing, Mr. Presi-
dent, is that there doesn’t seem to be a 
reason to the Republicans’ objections 
to Mr. Syed. It keeps changing. No one 
has raised any questions about Mr. 
Syed’s competence or his experience or 
his suitability to serve as Deputy SBA 
Administrator. 
In fact, several months ago, we tried 
to advance the nominee in our first ef-
fort in a business meeting by a voice 
vote, and several Republican Members 
of the Small Business Committee who 
are now participating in this obstruc-
tion voted yes at that time, including 
the ranking member. 
Now it appears that this boycott is 
part of a pattern by just a handful of 
Members who simply want to stop any 
action that would allow the Biden ad-
ministration to have a full complement 
of Senate-confirmed officials at crit-
ical Federal Agencies so they can then 
carry out their work as directed by 
Congress. 
Unfortunately, I would also note that 
this partisan brinkmanship and ob-
struction doesn’t end with domestic 
and economic matters. I want to point 
out, again, the dangerously slow con-
firmation process of our State Depart-
ment 
nominees 
and 
ambassadors. 
Again, we have a few Republican Mem-
bers of the Senate who are not just 
threatening our economic recovery and 
the health of our small businesses; 
they are threatening our national secu-
rity by slowing the process to schedule 
nomination 
hearings 
for 
qualified 
nominees and by placing holds on their 
confirmation because of their own per-
sonal political issues. 
I appreciate that some of those issues 
are very important. Nord Stream 2, I 
support, but holding these ambas-
sadors, holding these State Depart-
ment officials is not going to change 
what happens with Nord Stream 2. All 
it is going to do is make the United 
States less effective and less secure in 
the world. 
Today, only 30 Ambassadors have 
been confirmed by the Senate. This ad-
ministration had to wait over 200 
days—200 days—for its first Ambas-
sador to be confirmed, compared to 
only 62 days for the previous adminis-
tration. 
For the first 300 days of the previous 
administration, 55 State Department 
nominees were confirmed by the Sen-
ate. In the first 300 days of Biden’s 
Presidency, the Senate has confirmed 
one-quarter of that number. 
Actions speak louder than words. If 
our colleagues care about our national 
security, they would match deeds with 
words and swiftly confirm the 59 State 
Department nominees who are await-
ing confirmation on the Senate floor. 
Unfortunately, the holdup is not only 
on the floor of the Senate but also in 
the 
Foreign 
Relations 
Committee. 
Eleven nominees in committee are 
awaiting business meetings, and 21 
haven’t even been able to have a hear-
ing to advocate for themselves and 
their qualifications. 
What is worse from my perspective, 
the nominations that are being af-
fected by this obstruction are dis-
proportionately women. In a Foreign 
Service where men still outnumber 
women and where we are trying to be-
come a more diverse State Depart-
ment, it is critical that we confirm 
these qualified women. 
Amid increased Russian aggression 
toward our Ukrainian allies, it is par-
ticularly important that we confirm 
without delay the nominee to be Am-
bassador to NATO, Julie Smith. 
How can we advocate for American 
interests abroad, how can we represent 
American citizens abroad, how can we 
support our economic interests if we 
don’t have people in place who can do 
that? 
When we look at the increasing glob-
al threats to the United States, oper-
ating with a depleted diplomatic corps 
jeopardizes our national security. It 
jeopardizes U.S. interests and the safe-
ty of Americans at home and abroad. 
The political games that are being 
played by a few Members of this body 
are risking very serious consequences. 
I see my colleague from Ohio, who is 
the cochair of the Ukrainian Caucus, 
has come in. Perhaps he would work 
with me to try to get Julie Smith, our 
Ambassador to NATO, confirmed so 
that we have somebody there who can 
help as we are looking at the crises 
that are happening in Eastern Europe. 
I know we can work together in a ra-
tional, bipartisan way to address our 
country’s basic needs because we have 
just seen it. We saw it with the bipar-
tisan infrastructure bill that was just 
signed this week. Confirming Presi-
dential nominees is one of the most 
fundamental 
responsibilities 
of 
the 
Senate. It is the heart of article II in 
the Constitution. 
What we have seen to date is no sub-
stantive objection to the nomination of 
Dilawar Syed to be Deputy SBA Ad-
ministrator or to the nominations to 
fill numerous critical national security 
and foreign policy positions. This is ob-
struction for obstruction’s sake, and it 
has very real consequences for our 
country, for our small businesses, and 
for our national security and foreign 
policy. I hope that we will be able to 
work together on both sides of the aisle 
to address those nominees, who must 
be confirmed if we are to represent 
American 
interests 
at 
home 
and 
abroad. 
Again, I want to thank Chairman 
CARDIN for his hard work as head of the 
Small Business Committee and for the 
work that he has done on the Foreign 
Relations Committee as we have tried 
to address those people who need to be 
confirmed. Obviously, he has worked 
very closely with Senator MENENDEZ, 
the chair of the Foreign Relations 
Committee. These are two committees 
that I have the honor of serving on, and 
they have historically operated on a 
very 
bipartisan, 
very 
collaborative 
basis. That is why it is so disheart-
ening to see the breakdown that is oc-
curring. 
I hope that our colleagues will have a 
change of heart, that we will be able to 
move forward, and that we will be able 
to work together. I look forward to 
doing everything I can to make that 
happen. 
I yield the floor.

TRIBUTE TO DR. KRISTINA M. JOHNSON 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to pay tribute to Dr. Kristina M. 
Johnson and celebrate her investiture 
as the 16th president of the Ohio State 
University. 
Dr. Johnson brings more than 30 
years of experience and leadership in 
the academic, business, and public pol-
icy sectors to Ohio State, along with 
some very ambitious goals she has for 
the university.

November 17, 2021 
Although the formal investiture was 
postponed until this Friday, November 
19, due to COVID, Dr. Johnson actually 
assumed the presidency in August of 
last year, and her leadership has al-
ready helped the university community 
to come together during the past year 
of the pandemic. Ohio State is in full 
swing—classes, research, and other ac-
tivities. They have a darn good football 
team under her leadership as well—cur-
rently No. 4 in the country and on its 
way up. Go, Bucks. 
The Ohio State University was found-
ed in 1870 as a land grant university— 
the first of its kind in Ohio. Over the 
years, the university has grown into 
one of the largest and best respected 
institutions in the country. 
Dr. Johnson actually has close fam-
ily ties to Ohio State. Family lore has 
it that Dr. Johnson’s grandfather, who 
graduated from Ohio State in 1896, met 
Dr. Johnson’s grandmother on the Co-
lumbus campus. We like to think those 
close ties to OSU and deep family roots 
in Ohio have made her a Buckeye in 
spirit all along. 
Dr. Johnson comes to the Ohio State 
University after a long career in aca-
demic and business leadership. She pre-
viously served as the chancellor of the 
State University of New York system 
and has founded and served as CEO of 
several successful science and tech-
nology companies, served as the Under 
Secretary of Energy at the Department 
of Energy, and held academic leader-
ship positions in institutions such as 
Johns Hopkins University, Duke Uni-
versity, and the University of Colorado 
at Boulder. Her breadth of experience 
from academic leadership, business, 
and public policy gives her the impor-
tant tools to successfully lead the Ohio 
State University. 
I have enjoyed getting to know Dr. 
Johnson over the past year and a half, 
and I have been impressed with how 
the students have embraced her. It is a 
great student body. I have seen that 
firsthand at Ohio State, having taught 
four courses at the Glenn School of 
Public Affairs—now the Glenn College 
of Public Affairs—before being elected 
to the U.S. Senate, and I am proud to 
have been a member of the advisory 
board of the exciting Glenn College for 
the past 12 years. 
I believe the students and the faculty 
and the alumni and the friends who 
make up the Ohio State University 
community are very fortunate to have 
Dr. Johnson at the helm during this 
time. I wish her the very best as she 
continues to guide Ohio State into the 
future while focusing on academic ex-
cellence and building a strong and pas-
sionate community of Buckeyes. I look 
forward to continuing to work with Dr. 
Johnson to ensure her success and the 
success of the great institution, the 
Ohio State University. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Louisiana. 
INFLATION 
Mr. KENNEDY. Gosh, Mr. President, 
I wish I didn’t have to give this talk. 
I think it is a bipartisan observation 
that, unfortunately, Americans are 
paying a lot more for just about every-
thing. I asked my staff to put together 
some inflation numbers, and they are 
just breathtaking: gasoline, up 50 per-
cent; rental cars, up 42.9 percent; you 
need a used car or truck, they are up 26 
percent; a turkey, 20.2 percent; bacon, 
20.2 percent; beef, 20.1 percent; pork 
chops, 15.9 percent; bedroom furniture, 
12 percent higher than last year; eggs, 
up 11.6 percent; televisions, up 10 per-
cent; frozen fruits and vegetables, up 
71⁄2 percent; chicken, up 8.8 percent; 
shoes, up 8 percent; baby food, up 8 per-
cent; children’s clothes, up 7.6 percent. 
And I could keep going. Unbelievable. 
Now, I believe in calling them like I 
see them. I think most fairminded 
Americans know that President Biden 
is responsible for this inflation. You 
don’t have to be Einstein’s cousin to 
figure that out. But put the politics 
aside. The shame of all this is that the 
burden of these price increases is fall-
ing on the backs of the American peo-
ple, and while Washington is obsessed 
with the politics of it, the American 
people and the people in my State have 
to bear the cost. 
A lot of people, Mr. President, as you 
well know, just can’t afford to pay 50 
percent more to fill up their gas tanks. 
They can’t afford to have to stop and 
go arrange a bank loan to go to the gas 
station or to the grocery store. 
Unfortunately, for Americans in my 
State and your State and across the 
country, here with winter coming on, 
the cost of heating homes is also going 
up just in time for temperatures to 
fall. So the cost of heating is going up, 
and the temperatures are going down. 
A lot of families are going to have to 
shell out up to 30 percent more for nat-
ural gas than they did this past year. 
Ask them if their income went up 30 
percent. 
As our days grow shorter, the eco-
nomic landscape, unfortunately, is get-
ting darker. 
Thanksgiving is just around the cor-
ner. It is a cherished American holiday. 
But even the holiday that Americans 
observe in order to count our blessings 
is coming with new hardships. Accord-
ing to the New York Times, Thanks-
giving 2021, and I quote, ‘‘could be the 
most expensive meal in the history of 
the holiday.’’ 
As I just mentioned a few seconds 
ago, frozen turkey is going to set you 
back 20 percent more than it did last 
year. If you like gravy with your tur-
key, get ready to pay 7 percent more 
for gravy. Maybe you don’t eat meat. 
Maybe you are a vegan. Unfortunately, 
frozen vegetables are also going to cost 
you 7 to 71⁄2 percent more, and the high 
prices only apply if you can find food in 
the supermarkets. Some of these food 
products, you can’t even find with 
Google. There is no guarantee that the 
cranberry sauce and the sweet potatoes 
will be in stock come dinnertime. 
Now, this is America. This is 2021. 
This isn’t the Soviet Union, 30, 40, 50 
years ago. My God, Washington ought 
to hide its head in a bag. 
The official general inflation rate is 
6.2 percent higher than it was last Oc-
tober, and that happens to be the larg-
est increase in over 30 years. But we all 
know, and I can tell you, real people in 
the real world who go to the grocery 
store and the clothing store and pay 
their insurance bill and go try to buy 
an automobile know that it is not 6.2 
percent. It is a lot higher. 
I need to ask a question, though. Are 
you really surprised? Are you really 
surprised that prices are rising when 
the Biden administration is printing 
money, when the Biden administration 
is exploding our debt, when the Biden 
administration is forfeiting America’s 
energy independence, when the Biden 
administration is paying people to 
watch Netflix instead of producing the 
goods we need, when the Biden admin-
istration is ignoring gridlock in our 
supply chain? The American people 
aren’t surprised. 
For months—for months—the White 
House has turned gaslighting Ameri-
cans about the inflation crisis into an 
art form. White House officials pretend 
inflation—if you ask them—oh, it is 
just temporary—a temporary problem. 
Temporary, a rat’s rear end. It is actu-
ally a soul-crushing, job-killing tax on 
working Americans. That is what infla-
tion is. 
Every time you go to the grocery 
store, your taxes go up. And inflation 
hits lower-income and middle-income 
families the hardest. And anyone who 
doesn’t believe that should ask Sec-
retary Kerry whether fuel prices have 
grounded his private jet. Of course not. 
He is rich. He has got a private jet. He 
doesn’t feel it. 
You know who feels it? The moms 
and dads in this country who get up 
every day, who go to work and obey the 
law and pay their taxes and try to do 
the right thing by their kids and try to 
save a little money for retirement. 
That is who pays this tax that the 
economists call inflation. 
This inflation didn’t just appear out 
of nowhere. I mean, any economist 
with a pulse knows where this inflation 
came from. Inflation comes from too 
much money chasing too few goods. 
And when you have an administration, 
as we do with the Biden administra-
tion, that spends money like it was 
gully dirt, whose mantra is, ‘‘We can’t 
possibly spend enough taxpayer money, 
there is not enough hours in the day’’— 
of course, you don’t have inflation. Of 
course, you don’t have inflation. 
Now, what is President Biden doing 
tonight? Well, I have noticed that the 
Biden administration, when it comes to 
economics and other areas as well, 
they never make the same mistake 
twice. They make it five or six times, 
just to be sure. 
So how’s the Biden administration 
going to deal with this economic can-
cer of inflation which is killing the 
American people? Their idea is: Let’s 
go pass a spending orgy bill—they call

it reconciliation—of epic, epic propor-
tions, chockful of welfare blowouts 
when we can’t afford the social pro-
grams we have now. 
Are you kidding me? 
Are you kidding me? 
And one White House official claimed 
earlier this week that the President’s— 
he calls it a $1.75 trillion bill. It is 
going to end up, we all know, being a 
lot more than that. He says it will ac-
tually 
reduce 
inflation. 
Right—and 
those aren’t hogs in the hog lot. 
Just wait. The fact is, unless you 
were in the quad playing Frisbee dur-
ing Econ 101, you know this is truth. 
The fact is that massive government 
spending has kept workers on the side-
lines and has fueled inflation. But the 
only comfort the permanent Wash-
ington types are sending to folks gath-
ered around a historically expensive 
Thanksgiving table is that more—not 
less—more of the same insane policies 
are coming down the pipeline through 
what the President calls the Build 
Back Better bill. And I think most 
Americans call it the Build Back 
Broker bill. 
Have you looked at the bill? 
I looked at the House bill a bit. I 
started reading it. I am probably going 
to go broke just reading the thing. 
Neosocialists love this bill. They love 
it like the devil loves sin, but the 
American people aren’t going to love 
it. Louisianans are not going to love it. 
Louisianans love their families, and 
they just want to provide for them, es-
pecially at Thanksgiving and at Christ-
mas. And they can’t do it with infla-
tion raging. 
This Thanksgiving, what most Amer-
icans need the most is relief—not just 
relief from inflation, but relief from 
bad leadership. 
Now, I want my friends in the Biden 
White House to know that I am genu-
inely interested in working with them 
to solve America’s inflation problem, 
but you are not going to do it by spend-
ing more money. You are not going to 
do it by throwing gasoline on the fire. 
The first rule is to do no harm. Do no 
harm, and by that, I mean that my 
Democratic friends should stop trying 
to ram this multitrillion dollar tax- 
and-spend bill through Congress. And 
they should stop for two reasons: 
Americans don’t want it, and Ameri-
cans can’t afford it. 
So this Thanksgiving, Madam Presi-
dent—and I hope you have a good one— 
I hope my Democratic friends will give 
up on tying millstones around the neck 
of the American economy. I hope they 
will give up fueling inflation with an-
other extremist spending orgy bill. 
And if they would do that, if they 
would just do that, Americans could sit 
down to eat next Thursday and give 
thanks that compassion and common 
sense have finally prevailed in Wash-
ington, DC, where, frankly, on most 
issues, common sense is illegal. 
Madam President, I suggest the ab-
sence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
SMITH). The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
BORDER SECURITY 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, yes-
terday, the Secretary of Homeland Se-
curity, Mr. Mayorkas, testified before 
the Senate Judiciary Committee. It is 
the first time he has been before the 
Judiciary Committee for an oversight 
hearing. Of course, our minds were all 
on the crisis that is currently under-
way—and has been since the beginning 
of this year—at the border. 
When our colleague Senator LINDSEY 
GRAHAM asked him how he would rate 
his own performance so far, he gave a 
bizarre answer. He said: ‘‘I [would] give 
myself an A for effort.’’ Well, that is 
the type of rating you would give your-
self if you offered to cook dinner and 
completely bungled the recipe, or if 
you ordered a really thoughtful Christ-
mas gift for your spouse, but it didn’t 
arrive on time, you would give yourself 
an A for effort. But when you are talk-
ing about the person who is responsible 
for some of our Nation’s most critical 
responsibilities for which there are 
life-and-death consequences, an A for 
effort is hardly acceptable, and in this 
case, it is an overly generous assess-
ment. 
Over the last year, Customs and Bor-
der Protection has encountered more 
than 1.7 million migrants along the 
southern 
border—the 
highest 
on 
record. In 1 month alone, more than 
213,000 migrants crossed the border, in-
cluding 19,000 unaccompanied children. 
The Secretary may think he is worthy 
of an A for effort, but the numbers cer-
tainly do not reflect that. 
The American people are clearly con-
cerned about the way things are going. 
A recent poll found that more than 80 
percent of voters think illegal immi-
gration is a serious issue. Nearly two- 
thirds believe that the President’s Ex-
ecutive orders actually encourage more 
illegal immigration, and, as a result, 
only 35 percent of voters approve of the 
President’s handling of the border. 
Leaders in the administration have 
tried to play the blame game, saying, 
well, they inherited policies from the 
previous administration that led to the 
crisis. That seems to be part of the 
playbook—let’s 
blame 
Trump; 
let’s 
blame the previous administration and 
absolve ourselves of any responsi-
bility—but they have simply failed to 
provide an explanation to why those 
policies led to 460,000 fewer encounters 
in fiscal year 2020 but more than 1.7 
million in 2021. 
There is no question at all that this 
crisis is a direct result of the Biden ad-
ministration’s words and deeds. Back 
in February, just a few weeks after 
President Biden took his oath of office, 
migrants who were interviewed in their 
trek from their homes across our bor-
der said as much. One woman who 
crossed the Rio Grande River on a 
smuggler’s raft said that she and her 1- 
year-old son only came to the United 
States because of the Biden adminis-
tration. She said: ‘‘That gave us the 
opportunity to come.’’ The administra-
tion has signaled that it is not only OK 
with the record levels of illegal immi-
gration but that it is actively encour-
aging more people to make the trek. 
Prior to the Biden administration’s 
border crisis, there was a clear and sen-
sible process for migrants who crossed 
our border to claim asylum. That indi-
vidual would be processed by the Bor-
der Patrol and undergo a credible fear 
assessment, which is the standard for 
claiming asylum, essentially deter-
mining, at least as a preliminary mat-
ter, whether they would qualify for 
asylum. If so, that person would be 
issued a notice to appear at a future 
court hearing—a critical document 
that tells asylum seekers when and 
where to show up for their day in 
court. 
But 
under 
Secretary 
Mayorkas’s 
leadership, that is not happening any-
more. I have heard from many folks in 
Texas about the fact that huge num-
bers of migrants are now being released 
without a notice to appear. Thousands 
of migrants have been released with 
what is now called a notice to report— 
essentially, a document that says: 
When you get where you are going, 
turn yourself in to your local Immigra-
tion and Customs Enforcement office. 
Well, these migrants haven’t under-
gone a credible fear screening, so we 
have no way of knowing how many of 
them will likely, potentially, qualify 
for asylum. We do know, based on deci-
sions from immigration courts, that 
only about 10 percent of the people who 
claim asylum actually qualify under 
the prevailing legal standard. 
Because these migrants haven’t un-
dergone 
preliminary 
screening, 
we 
have no information about the validity 
of their asylum claims. And it is un-
clear whether the administration has 
given any teeth at all to the warning 
that the failure to contact the local 
ICE office may result in your arrest. In 
other words, there are no consequences 
for not showing up. 
The Department of Homeland Secu-
rity is now telling us that they have 
stopped issuing notices to report, but 
the truth is, they have just changed 
the title. They are still paroling mi-
grants into the United States without 
issuing a notice to appear. When these 
migrants inevitably fail to turn them-
selves in to the nearest ICE office—and 
ICE’s internal figures suggest the com-
pliance rate is unsurprisingly low—it 
isn’t clear that the Department of 
Homeland Security will do anything at 
all to locate them and remove them 
from the United States even though 
they haven’t complied with the process 
that they have been told they must 
comply with. The Biden administration 
has made it even easier for migrants to 
disappear into the great American 
heartland.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S8339 
November 17, 2021 
Several 
weeks 
ago, 
Secretary 
Mayorkas gave migrants another rea-
son to believe that they could make it 
across our borders and be able to stay. 
According to Secretary Mayorkas, ille-
gally entering our country is no longer 
reason enough for ICE to begin removal 
proceedings. The Secretary’s guidance 
provided a few exemptions. In theory, 
illegal border crossers are a priority for 
enforcement but only if they are appre-
hended in the United States after un-
lawfully entering after November 1, 
2020. It is unclear what the magic is 
with that date. In other words, ICE 
agents can’t touch them unless another 
law enforcement agency picks them up 
first. 
It says individuals convicted of seri-
ous criminal conduct who pose a cur-
rent threat to public safety should be a 
priority for removal, but it is unclear 
what crimes meet those criteria. Is dis-
tributing or receiving child pornog-
raphy considered serious criminal con-
duct? What about crimes like embez-
zlement? larceny? breaking and enter-
ing? sex offenses? It is unclear exactly 
what the standard is, and I think that 
is on purpose because clearly Secretary 
Mayorkas does not want the Border 
Patrol and Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement to actually enforce the 
law that Congress has written. We are 
the ones who make the policy, and the 
Border Patrol and Immigration and 
Customs Enforcement simply execute 
that 
policy. 
Clearly, 
Secretary 
Mayorkas is trying to confuse things 
such that no apprehension and deten-
tion takes place at all. 
What if the distribution of child por-
nography, let’s say, happened 4 years 
ago? Is the perpetrator no longer a pri-
ority for apprehension and removal 
now that the threat isn’t ‘‘current’’? In 
fact, the Secretary explicitly says the 
threat shouldn’t be determined accord-
ing to bright lines or categories. In 
other words, he wants to continue to 
fuzz it up and make it ambiguous. I 
don’t understand why if you are actu-
ally serious about enforcing our laws. 
Is there a reason that any migrant con-
victed of possessing or distributing 
child pornography should be allowed to 
remain in the United States? 
The Secretary indicates that even 
certain migrants, like those who are el-
derly or provide for their families, 
should be exempt from the law. That 
clearly is not within the authority of 
the Secretary to decide against whom 
the laws should be enforced. Does that 
mean that someone who committed a 
sexual assault 20 years ago but now has 
a family who depends on him should be 
able to remain in the United States? 
It defies all common sense to ask our 
law enforcement officers to turn a 
blind eye when they encounter individ-
uals who have clearly broken the law. 
Imagine calling the police to report an 
intruder in your home and being told, 
unless this person is young, childless, 
and murdered a member of your fam-
ily, we can’t do anything or we won’t 
do anything. 
The reality of the situation, however 
inconvenient it may seem for our col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle, is 
that, by entering the United States il-
legally—by doing that—migrants have 
broken the law, and there have to be 
consequences. The Secretary cannot, 
consistent with his oath of office, 
refuse to enforce those laws in order to 
appease his party’s political base. 
In fact, by clearly outlining who will 
and who will not be able to remain in 
the United States, notwithstanding 
what the law says, the administration 
is actually encouraging even more mi-
grants to put themselves in harm’s way 
to come to the United States. This is 
known as pull factors, which actually 
encourage more illegal immigration. 
Under this guidance, visa overstays 
aren’t a priority for enforcement at all. 
If somebody comes in on a visa but 
overstays that visa, they are illegally 
present in the United States, but they 
don’t have to worry about the Biden 
administration actually enforcing the 
law and removing them. In other 
words, the guidance is an open invita-
tion for migrants to disregard the 
terms of their entry into the United 
States. 
When President Biden’s nominee for 
the Customs and Border Protection 
testified before the Senate Finance 
Committee, I asked the police chief 
from Arizona if he agreed that the 
Biden administration’s policy of non-
enforcement is a pull factor that is en-
couraging more illegal immigration. 
He admitted that, yes, it is. 
So, yesterday, I asked Secretary 
Mayorkas the same question: Does this 
guidance of nonenforcement send a sig-
nal to criminal organizations, human 
smugglers, and migrants that if they 
illegally enter the United States and 
commit no other crimes, they can 
stay? 
He said: No. That is 100 percent false. 
But 
I 
disagree 
with 
Secretary 
Mayorkas. He is clearly not telling the 
truth. There is a clear correlation be-
tween the Biden administration’s reck-
less policies and the record level of ille-
gal migration. 
Any administration, of course, has a 
certain amount of discretion when it 
comes to enforcement, but what we are 
seeing from Secretary Mayorkas isn’t 
an exercise of discretion, and it is cer-
tainly not A-for-effort worthy. I don’t 
think 
anyone 
expected 
Secretary 
Mayorkas to lead the charge to secure 
our borders and crack down on illegal 
immigration, but he is not even doing 
the bare minimum that his job descrip-
tion requires. 
The truth is, the Biden administra-
tion has fumbled the border crisis at 
every turn. The President sent smoke 
signals about open borders before he 
even took office, and his administra-
tion has rolled out incentive after in-
centive for migrants to continue to 
break the law, and it has tied the hands 
of dedicated law enforcement officers 
who put their lives on the line to pro-
tect the American people. 
We have got a border czar who once 
compared ICE to the Ku Klux Klan, and 
we have a DHS Secretary who gives 
himself an A even though more than 1.7 
million migrants have crossed the bor-
der since he took office in February. 
So, while Secretary Mayorkas thinks 
he is entitled to an A for effort, there 
is no question that, on balance, the 
Biden administration has earned an F 
for its response to the border crisis. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant bill clerk pro-
ceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
INFLATION 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
inflation soared to a 31-year high in Oc-
tober. 
Now, after thinking about it, it 
seems President Biden and his allies 
are sensing inflation may endanger 
their reckless tax-and-spending agen-
da. Now, as a result, they have taken 
to arguing that the cure for the infla-
tion spurred by their reckless spending 
is to pursue even more reckless spend-
ing. 
I am not buying it. The American 
people aren’t buying it either. 
President Biden and his allies have 
been wrong about inflation from day 
one, and they are wrong now. Imme-
diately after taking office, we all know 
what happened: They pursued a par-
tisan $2 trillion liberal wish list pack-
age under the guise of COVID relief, 
and only 9 percent of it was to fight 
COVID. 
Congress had already approved $4 
trillion in bipartisan relief, including a 
nearly $1 trillion bill, only a month 
prior to the President’s inauguration. 
And all that money that was spent re-
covering from Congress shutting down 
the economy in March of 2020 was all 
passed in a bipartisan, cooperative 
way, not like bills this year are tuned 
up to just be partisan, with the major-
ity Democrats of the House and Senate 
supplying all the support. 
Now, our economy was already on the 
road to recovery when the President 
was sworn in, and highly effective vac-
cines were allowing economic activity 
to bounce back, and it did bounce back 
quickly. 
I, along with many on my side of the 
aisle, warned that adding $2 trillion on 
top of the existing relief—that money 
still 
entering 
the 
economy—risked 
sparking inflation, and it has. 
And 
it 
wasn’t 
just 
Republicans 
sounding the inflation alarm. Long-
time Democratic economist Professor 
Larry Summers, who held top posts in 
both the Obama and Clinton adminis-
trations, also made his inflation con-
cerns known. So Democrats in Con-
gress and the White House don’t even 
heed the advice of their own.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S8340 
November 17, 2021 
In a February Washington Post op- 
ed, Professor Summers warned Presi-
dent Biden’s so-called COVID package 
might ‘‘set off inflationary pressures of 
a kind [that] we have not seen in a gen-
eration, with consequences for the 
value of the dollar and financial sta-
bility.’’ Six and two-tenths inflation 
just announced, which proves that Pro-
fessor Summers was right. 
With a prominent liberal economist 
such as Larry Summers raising infla-
tion concerns, wouldn’t one think the 
President of the United States would 
begin to take the risk of inflation very 
seriously? It is not how it is turning 
out. Instead, President Biden and sen-
ior administration officials are dou-
bling down, arguing the real risk was 
not spending enough. 
Now, think about that for a second. 
Congress had already spent almost as 
much responding to COVID, in infla-
tion-adjusted dollars, as it did in wag-
ing World War II. Yet we are somehow 
expected to believe too little spending, 
not inflation, was the real risk. 
In reality, President Biden and con-
gressional Democrats were simply de-
termined to not let a crisis go to waste. 
They couldn’t let a ‘‘high class prob-
lem’’ like inflation get in the way of 
passing ‘‘the most progressive piece of 
legislation in history.’’ 
How out of touch is that? Remember, 
inflation is a regressive tax that hurts 
the poor the most, increasing the cost 
of food, clothing, and shelter; in other 
words, affecting the basic essentials of 
life. Then, in the months to follow, in-
flation began to tick upward. In April, 
inflation clocked in at an annualized 
rate of 4.1 percent—the highest spike 
since the financial crisis of 2008. 
Nothing to see here, the Biden ad-
ministration officials said. That infla-
tion was solely due to ‘‘base effects’’— 
those are their words, ‘‘base affects’’— 
that resulted from prices being sup-
pressed during the pandemic. 
In a month or two, they said infla-
tion was to return to normal or you 
heard the word ‘‘transitional’’ infla-
tion, as Fed Chairman Powell was 
preaching to the entire country. Now, 
of course, Powell has changed his mind, 
to some extent. 
Now, around the same time, Presi-
dent Biden released his reckless tax- 
and-spending agenda, calling for an ad-
ditional—can you believe it?—$4,000 in 
spending? 
Professor 
Larry 
Summers 
again 
sounded the inflation alarm warning, 
‘‘[W]e are injecting more demand into 
the economy than the potential supply 
. . . and that will generate over-
heating.’’ 
Now, skip ahead a month to June. In-
flation surges to 5.4 percent. Again, the 
administration claims that there is 
nothing to worry about. Again, we are 
told inflation is merely transitory and 
solely the result of bottlenecks in the 
supply chain. 
Inflation remained at those elevated 
levels of 5.4 percent July through Sep-
tember. Inflation was persisting longer 
than the administration expected. But 
they were still sure it was only transi-
tory. 
According to President Biden, ‘‘[N]o 
serious 
economist’’—those 
are 
his 
words—‘‘[N]o serious economist’’ was 
predicting spiraling inflation. Really? 
Larry Summers, a Harvard professor 
and former Clinton Secretary of Treas-
ury, isn’t a serious economist? 
I will tell you how serious of an econ-
omist he is. I think he got on the Har-
vard staff at a very young age with a 
title of distinguished professor. And I 
think he was only about 30 years of age 
at that time. Then, early this month, 
the inflation numbers for October were 
released. Inflation surged to 6.2 per-
cent. That is the highest inflation rate 
in 31 years. 
Only then did the administration 
begin to acknowledge that inflation is 
a problem. To do otherwise would be an 
insult to the intelligence of the Amer-
ican public. Hard-working Americans 
have been experiencing historically 
high price increases for more than half 
a year. 
The Biden inflation tax on average 
Americans is now $175 a month, which 
equates to about an extra $2,100 of 
costs every year. Gone are the claims 
that inflation is transitory. Instead, 
according 
to 
President 
Biden, 
‘‘[i]nflation hurts Americans’ pocket-
books, and reversing this trend’’ is his 
‘‘top priority.’’ 
Now, President Biden and his allies 
claim the key to reversing this infla-
tion trend is to enact the same reckless 
tax-and-spending 
agenda 
that 
they 
have been pursuing all year. How con-
venient. The solution to surging infla-
tion is the same agenda he has been 
passing all along. 
I won’t go as far as President Biden 
and try to claim no serious economist 
agrees with him. However, even the 
economists cited by the administration 
as supporting their agenda do have ca-
veats. Those caveats include that their 
spending policies are entirely paid for 
and are structured in a way that will 
increase labor productivity. 
The current version of their spending 
plans doesn’t come close to meeting 
those huge caveats. The President 
claims his agenda is completely paid 
for, but those claims rest solely on 
sleight of hand and budget gimmickry. 
Their largest gimmick comes from 
artificially sunsetting spending provi-
sions that they do not intend to expire 
while imposing a permanent tax hike. 
In other words, increasing taxes and 
accounting it for over the 10-year pe-
riod of time that the Congressional 
Budget Office looks ahead—spend that 
money in the first 2 or 3 years, and 
then supposedly the program is going 
to sunset. But everybody knows that 
these programs won’t sunset. So you 
better figure what the long-term cost 
is. And that is that $4.2 trillion that 
has been in the press since this Build 
Back Better program hit the press. 
Now, on another point, even taking 
President Biden’s claim at face value, 
his agenda will result in hundreds of 
billions of dollars of increased deficit 
spending in the near term, fueling cur-
rent inflation pressures. 
Moreover, according to a Penn Whar-
ton Budget Model and its analysis, 
under the more realistic assumption 
that their spending proposals are made 
permanent, their plan would increase 
debt and deficit by more than $2 tril-
lion over 10 years. The Penn Wharton 
Budget Model shows that. 
As a result, then, by 2050, govern-
ment debt would be 24 percent higher, 
economic growth would be 3 percent 
lower, and wages would be 1.7 percent 
less than they otherwise would be. 
Now, he calls the program Building 
Back Better. This is a recipe for build-
ing back worse. The bottom line is that 
the President’s ill-designed spending- 
and-tax spree isn’t deficit neutral. It 
won’t boost productivity, but it will 
fuel inflation. So I think after this Oc-
tober report comes out of inflation 
being the highest in 31 years at 6.2 per-
cent, it is time to pause and rethink 
this entire approach. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

REMEMBERING HUGH K. 
LEATHERMAN, SR. 
Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, along 
with my fellow Senator from South 
Carolina, Mr. SCOTT, I rise today to 
honor the life of South Carolina State 
Senator Hugh K. Leatherman, Sr., who 
passed away, surrounded by his loving 
family, on November 12, 2021, at the 
age of 90. 
Senator Leatherman was born on 
April 14, 1931, in Lincoln County, NC. 
He was raised on a farm and attended 
North Carolina State University, earn-
ing a degree in civil engineering in 
1953. In 1955, he moved to South Caro-
lina to start a concrete company, be-
fore starting his political career. His 
expansive political career began in 1967 
after being elected to serve on the 
Quinby Town Council. During his term 
on the town council, he served as 
mayor pro tempore for the town of 
Quinby from 1971 to 1976. In 1980, Sen-
ator Leatherman ran for South Caro-
lina State Senate and served the people 
of District 31, which includes Dar-
lington and Florence Counties. On 
June 18, 2014, Senator Leatherman was 
elected president pro tempore. He also 
served as the chairman of the powerful 
senate finance committee, as well as a 
member of the ethics, interstate co-
operation, rules, transportation and 
the labor, commerce and industry com-
mittees. 
As a State senator, a position he held 
for 
more 
than 
40 
years, 
Senator 
Leatherman’s dedication to the State 
could not be questioned. When it came 
to the needs of South Carolina, he was 
always at the forefront of getting 
things done. His statewide perspective 
led him to championing the Port of 
Charleston Harbor Deepening Project, 
as well as recruiting companies like 
Boeing, Honda, and Volvo to come to 
the State he loved so intensely. He will 
be remembered as having one of the 
most effective voices for his region and 
the State and was always looking to-
wards what the State of South Caro-
lina could become. 
Senator Leatherman’s devotion to 
his State and his constituency should 
be a model from which all public serv-
ants look to follow. We grieve his loss

TRIBUTE TO JAMES AND MARTY 
HARRIS 
Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, today 
I rise to honor Wisconsin residents 
James ‘‘Jim’’ and Marty Harris for 
their humanitarian work in Southeast 
Asia and their embrace of those dis-
placed from that region. These two life-
long educators have made it their life’s 
mission to welcome Hmong and Lao 
refugee families to Central Wisconsin, 
as well as make a positive impact for 
those living in Laos. 
Over the course of more than 20 
years, the Harris’ have made over 20 
trips to Laos. Beginning in 2000, they 
began the effort to reconnect families 
from their Wisconsin community with 
friends and relatives left behind when 
they departed their homeland. During 
these trips, they assisted Lao villagers 
in desperate need of medical care, 
helped provide hospitals with medical 
supplies, 
and 
provided 
many 
Lao 
schools with their very first library, a 
most appropriate endeavor for the now 
retired elementary school principal 
and retired English and art teacher. 
However, their largest impact comes 
with their assistance in the removal of 
bombs, 
land 
mines, 
and 
other 
unexploded ordnances that dot the La-
otian landscape after years of war and 
turmoil. As Jim told me during a visit 
I made to Laos several years ago, 
‘‘Many villagers are waiting 40 years 
for four days of help.’’ To address this, 
the Harris’s founded the nonprofit ‘‘We 
Help War Victims,’’ an organization 
that assists survivors of war and other 
conflicts to rebuild their lives. With 
half of its annual budget stemming 
from fundraising sales of Lao coffee 
beans, it allows paid teams to continue 
ordnance removal even when Jim and 
Marty aren’t able to be halfway around 
the world. Countless lives and limbs 
have been saved because of this con-
tinuing work and dedication. Now, vil-
lages can enjoy expanded gardens and 
rice fields. This increased agricultural 
output allows these populations to bet-
ter sustain themselves and provide food 
for neighboring communities. 
With every trip, Jim returned to Wis-
consin with relics and mementos gath-
ered during his time in Laos. Slowly, 
this collection has amassed to become 
one of, if not the largest, known pri-
vate collection of Southeast Asian arti-
facts in all of the United States. Jim 
started off by displaying some of these 
items at the school he worked at as 
principal. In 2016, he made the collec-
tion more accessible by developing an 
exhibition called ‘‘From Laos to Amer-
ica: The Spirit of ’76’’, which was 
housed at the Wausau Center Mall in 
Wausau, WI. Since then, more than 
10,000 people have visited the museum. 
The ‘‘From Laos to America’’ collec-
tion now enters into a new chapter in 
2021. This impressive collection has 
found a new home in Washington 
Square in downtown Wausau. Jim and 
Marty have also partnered with the 
Hmong American Center to ensure that 
this collection remains in central Wis-
consin. This new home will highlight 
the full collection and provide edu-
cational opportunities so the commu-
nity and visitors alike can learn more 
about the Southeast Asian refugee ex-
perience. I am pleased to celebrate this 
important partnership and the new 
home for this important collection, and 
I am proud to commend Jim and Marty 
on their tireless humanitarian work 
and advocacy in Southeast Asia and in 
central Wisconsin.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
COUNTRY MUSIC HALL OF FAME 
2020 INDUCTEES 
∑ Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, it 
is my privilege to finally congratulate 
the 2020 Country Music Hall of Fame 
members-elect Dean Dillon, Marty Stu-
art, and Hank Williams, Jr. With the 
postponement of their medallion cere-
mony until this coming Sunday, I can 
tell you that Music City is ready to 
welcome them into the Circle. 
Dean Dillon, this year’s songwriter 
inductee, is the heart and soul behind 
some of country music’s most iconic 
hits. With imagery as vivid as a golden 
sun-drenched memory and melodies as 
smooth as Tennessee whiskey, Dean 
captured the attention of music fans 
and earned the admiration of the in-
dustry’s most well-respected artists. In 
Nashville, the good word is that ‘‘it all 
begins with a song,’’ and in Dean’s 
case, his songbook has inspired genera-
tions of young writers to give them-
selves up to the art of storytelling. 
Marty Stuart, this year’s modern era 
artist inductee, is a jack of all trades 
and an undisputed master of each of 
them. He started his journey to the 
Hall of Fame at the age of 13 and, over 
the course of his career, earned the re-
spect of his peers with his skills as a 
musician, singer, songwriter, producer, 
and television host. Today, he is recog-
nized not only for his contributions to 
his craft, but for his role as one of the 
foremost custodians of country music’s 
legacy. 
Hank Williams, Jr., this year’s vet-
erans era artist inductee, bridged gen-
erations and genres with his own spe-
cial blend of family tradition, outlaw 
swagger, and a singular disregard for 
the rules. Over the course of five dec-
ades and more than 100 appearances on 
the charts, Hank proved that what 
many insiders foolishly dismissed as 
the underbelly of country music was in 
fact home to musicians and fans alike 
who preferred to create their own abso-
lution rather than seek it within the 
glittering confines of the mainstream. 
On behalf of the entire Tennessee del-
egation, I thank Dean, Marty, and 
Hank for their passion and artistry. 
Your talents are a gift, gentlemen. 
Thank you for sharing them with us.∑

TRIBUTE TO DAVID J. BERGER 
∑ Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask my 
colleagues to join me in honoring and 
thanking an outstanding public serv-
ant, Mayor David J. Berger, who will 
retire at the end of this month, after 
dedicating his life to serving his be-
loved city of Lima, OH. He leaves this 
office with a legacy of service and ac-
complishments. 
Dave has served as the mayor of 
Lima, OH, for a remarkable 32 years. 
He is the proud son of an IBEW union 
worker and was raised with a keen 
sense of service to others and a dedica-
tion to his Catholic faith—two things 
that would guide him throughout his 
career. Dave’s faith led him to attend a 
seminary high school and then St. 
Meinrad’s seminary in southern Indi-
ana. Upon leaving the seminary, he at-
tended Catholic University of America 
in Washington, DC, where he received 
both his bachelor’s and master’s de-
grees. 
Following graduation, his faith and 
commitment to service brought him to 
Lima, OH, where he served as the exec-
utive director of Rehab Project. He 
worked to bring opportunity for a sec-
ond chance to Ohioans in prison, help-
ing provide training to build and ren-
ovate homes. This work led him to run 
for mayor in 1989 and, after a success-
ful campaign, serve in that position 
ever since. 
From his work serving as a founding 
member of the bipartisan Ohio Mayors 
Alliance, to serving as cochair of the 
U.S. Conference of Mayors Water Coun-
cil, Dave has worked with mayors and 
legislators on both sides of the aisle to 
always be a persistent advocate for the 
people of Lima and the concerns and 
challenges 
faced 
by 
many 
cities 
throughout the industrial Midwest. 
Dave is well known for his work ad-
vocating for water infrastructure and 
has spent half of his career as mayor 
leading negotiations with the U.S. and 
Ohio EPAs to work to solve a combined 
and sanitary sewer overflow problem 
that has plagued many cities. My staff 
and I regularly met with Dave about 
these issues and acted upon his ideas 
and suggestions. 
We have also worked together on sev-
eral community projects. From helping 
to launch a My Brother’s Keeper chap-
ter in his city to advocating for public 
infrastructure investments or ensuring 
employers in Lima honor the dignity of 
work by respecting labor union rights, 
David and I have spent years collabo-
rating to help the local community 
flourish. 
With his commitment to push for re-
search and economic development, and 
improving the city’s downtown, Dave 
has lent his time and wisdom to serv-
ing on the board of directors of the

November 17, 2021 
Ohio Energy Advanced Manufacturing 
Center; Downtown Lima, Inc.; the 
Allen Economic Development Group; 
and West Ohio Community Action 
Partnership. His pursuit of partner-
ships among these organizations and 
many community-driven task forces 
have helped support the city’s workers 
and helped retain vital employers in 
the community, including the Lima 
Refinery, the Joint Systems Manufac-
turing Center, JSMC, and the Ford En-
gine Plant. 
I am grateful that our friendship long 
predates both of our political careers— 
Dave is a fellow native of Mansfield, 
OH. He is also a fellow Eagle Scout. 
One my most prized photos is that of 
then-Col. John Glenn posing with me 
as I am awarded the Eagle Scout badge 
at the Johnny Appleseed Council’s 
Eagle Scout ceremony. What that 
photo does not show is that Mayor 
Berger was there as well. 
Dave’s legacy will live on in the city 
he loved—the jobs he saved and se-
cured, the water infrastructure he im-
proved, the businesses he helped thrive 
and grow, and, most importantly, the 
lives he helped change for the better. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in 
wishing my friend, Mayor David J. 
Berger, a long and happy retirement. 
Dave has done so much good for so long 
for the people of Lima, and because of 
his work, Lima’s next mayor, Sharetta 
Smith, has a strong foundation to con-
tinue addressing the challenges facing 
this city in the heart of Allen County. 
Dave, thank you for 32 years of dedi-
cated service and for the legacy you 
have created. I know it has not always 
been, easy but all your efforts are ap-
preciated.∑

TRIBUTE TO MAJOR DANIELA 
RAGEN 
∑ Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, today I 
have the distinct honor of recognizing 
MAJ Daniela Ragen, U.S. Army Na-
tional Guard, of Broadwater County, as 
Montanan of the Month for her service 
to our Nation. 
Daniela knew from a young age that 
she wanted to be a soldier. As soon as 
she enlisted in the Army, Daniela faced 
a challenge—a language barrier. She 
persisted and studied tirelessly to pass 
her English exams with high scores—so 
high she was accused of cheating and 
was forced to retake the exam. That 
didn’t deter her. She retook the exam 
and passed again with flying colors. 
Following a period of service on Ac-
tive Duty, Major Ragen joined the Ari-
zona National Guard, where she contin-
ued her career as an analyst in the 
Joint Counter Narcotics Task Force. 
Major Ragen then enrolled in the selec-
tive 15-month officer candidate school, 
where she was 1 of only 6 participants 
who graduated from a starting class of 
21 students. 
In addition to serving her country, 
Daniela has served the great State of 
Montana as a coordinator for the Mon-
tana National Guard Counter Drug 
Program. In this position, Daniela rep-
resents the best of both the National 
Guard and the State of Montana 
through her values of service, leader-
ship, and persistence. She was even se-
lected by her colleagues to serve as the 
chair for Northwest Region Advisory 
Committee 
for 
the 
National 
Counterdrug Program. 
On top of being an exemplary Mon-
tanan and soldier, Daniela is a wife and 
a mother of five children, one of whom 
is currently serving in the Montana 
National Guard. Her husband, LTC 
Chase Ragen, is also a long-serving of-
ficer in the Montana National Guard. 
Major Ragen truly embodies the val-
ues of a soldier and the spirit of a Mon-
tanan. It is my honor to recognize 
Daniela for her resilience, courage, and 
commitment to serving her great State 
and country. Keep up the great work, 
Major Ragen.∑ 
f 
RECOGNIZING CHEZ PANISSE 
∑ Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, I rise 
to recognize the 50th anniversary of 
Chez Panisse, the pioneering home of 
farm-to-table cooking in Berkeley, CA. 
Chez Panisse was founded in 1971 by 
Alice Waters, then a young Montessori 
teacher. She felt that by strengthening 
her community’s connection to sea-
sonal foods and local growers, she 
could foster new ideas and connections. 
At the core of the new restaurant was 
a sense of social responsibility and lim-
itless communal potential. 
Guided by Alice Waters’ ideals, Chez 
Panisse spurred a movement of slow 
food and local eating, showing that 
sustainability could ground a gourmet 
menu. Alice Waters mentored countless 
young chefs on her staff, many of 
whom went on to open restaurants, 
found companies, or write cookbooks of 
their own. Today, the style pioneered 
at Chez Panisse is known as California 
cuisine. 
And Alice Waters never lost sight of 
the principles that inspired her. To 
commemorate the restaurant’s 25th an-
niversary in 1996, she launched the 
Chez Panisse Foundation, which sup-
ports organic gardening and culinary 
education in schools. Thousands of 
schools across the world now benefit 
from the curriculum developed through 
her Edible Schoolyard Project. 
Chez Panisse is an icon of the Cali-
fornia culinary scene, offering a testa-
ment to the fruits of eating locally and 
sustainably. 
I 
congratulate 
Alice 
Waters and all the staff of Chez Panisse 
on this remarkable anniversary and 
send my best wishes for the decades to 
come.∑

NATING NOVEMBER 17, 2021, AS 
‘‘NATIONAL BUTTER DAY’’ 
Ms. SMITH (for herself and Ms. KLO-
BUCHAR) submitted the following reso-
lution; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 453 
Whereas, around the world, butter can be 
found in cuisines of every culture, each of 
which use butter to enhance recipes and en-
rich lives; 
Whereas butter has been on the dinner 
table for individuals for hundreds of years; 
Whereas butter has served as a staple for 
family recipes that have been passed down 
for generations; 
Whereas the average individual in the 
United States eats 6.3 pounds, or about 25 
sticks, of cow’s butter each year; 
Whereas butter sculptures have been used 
to celebrate scenes and individuals from 
across the United States since the 19th cen-
tury; 
Whereas butter is the crucial ingredient in 
mouth-watering sauces, rich cookies, creamy 
mashed potatoes, hearty casseroles, and 
much more; 
Whereas butter producers, processors, and 
dealers have always ensured that butter was 
available for cooks across the United States; 
and 
Whereas butter has improved the meals 
that have brought families and friends to-
gether: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates November 17, 2021, as ‘‘Na-
tional Butter Day’’; and 
(2) encourages the people of the United 
States to celebrate National Butter Day 
with their favorite buttery dishes and baked

FIELD 
Mrs. SHAHEEN (for herself, Mr. COT-
TON, Ms. KLOBUCHAR, Mr. BLUMENTHAL, 
Ms. ROSEN, Mr. HOEVEN, and Mrs. 
HYDE-SMITH) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee on Armed Services: 
S. RES. 454 
Whereas establishing an annual ‘‘National 
Warrior Call Day’’ will draw attention to the 
members of the Armed Forces whose connec-
tion to one another is key to the veterans 
and first responders in the United States 
who may be dangerously disconnected from 
family, friends, and support systems; 
Whereas the number of suicides of mem-
bers of the Armed Forces serving on active 
duty increased to 377 in 2020, a figure up from 
348 in 2019; 
Whereas the suicide rate for veterans has 
steadily increased since 2006, with 6,261 vet-
erans taking their own lives in 2019; 
Whereas, after adjusting for sex and age, 
the rate of veteran suicide in 2018 was 27.5 
per 100,000 individuals, higher than the rate 
among all United States adults at 18.3 per 
100,000 individuals; 
Whereas more veterans have died by sui-
cide in the last 10 years than members of the 
Armed Forces who died from combat in Viet-
nam; 
Whereas many of the veterans who take 
their own lives have had no contact with the 
Department of Veterans Affairs; 
Whereas the Coronavirus Disease 2019 
(COVID–19) pandemic can lead to increased 
isolation and disconnection, further exacer-
bating mental and physical ailments such as 
post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic 
brain injury; 
Whereas the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention note that law enforcement 
officers and firefighters are more likely to 
die by suicide than in the line of duty, and 
emergency medical services providers are 
1.39 times more likely to die by suicide than 
members of the general public; 
Whereas invisible wounds linked to an un-
derlying and undiagnosed traumatic brain 
injury can mirror many mental health condi-
tions, a problem that can be addressed 
through appropriate medical treatment; 
Whereas additional research is needed to 
highlight the connection between traumatic 
brain injury as a root cause of invisible 
wounds and suicide by members of the 
Armed Forces and veterans; and 
Whereas November 21, 2021, would be an ap-
propriate day to designate as ‘‘National War-
rior Call Day’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the designation of November 
21, 2021, as ‘‘National Warrior Call Day’’; 
(2) encourages all individuals in the United 
States, especially members of the Armed 
Forces serving on active duty and veterans, 
to call up a warrior, have an honest con-
versation, and connect them with support, 
understanding that making a warrior call 
could save a life; and 
(3) implores all individuals in the United 
States to recommit themselves to engaging 
with members of the Armed Forces through 
‘‘National Warrior Call Day’’ and other con-
structive efforts that result in solutions and 
treatment for the invisible scars they carry.

SENATE RESOLUTION 455—DESIG-
NATING NOVEMBER 2021 AS ‘‘NA-
TIONAL HOSPICE AND PALLIA-
TIVE CARE MONTH’’ 
Ms. ROSEN (for herself, Mr. BAR-
RASSO, Ms. BALDWIN, and Mrs. FISCHER) 
submitted the following resolution; 
which was considered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 455 
Whereas palliative care and hospice serv-
ices— 
(1) can empower individuals to live as fully 
as possible, surrounded and supported by 
family and loved ones, despite serious ill-
nesses or injuries; and 
(2) are critical parts of the continuum of 
supports and services people with serious ill-
ness and their families need; 
Whereas the Coronavirus Disease 2019 
(COVID–19) pandemic public health emer-
gency has— 
(1) led to a sudden and unexpected increase 
in the number of individuals facing a serious 
illness or injury, which has brought atten-
tion to the need for better understanding and 
use of— 
(A) hospice; 
(B) palliative care; and 
(C) advance care planning; 
(2) disproportionately impacted residents 
of nursing homes and other long-term care 
facilities; and 
(3) limited access to family caregivers who 
play a critical role in palliative care and 
hospice for their loved ones; 
Whereas ensuring access to palliative care 
and hospice for all individuals in the United 
States in need, regardless of age, race, eth-
nicity, or socioeconomic status, is impor-
tant; 
Whereas palliative care and hospice aims 
to bring patients and family caregivers high- 
quality care delivered by an interdiscipli-
nary team of skilled health care profes-
sionals, including— 
(1) physicians; 
(2) nurses; 
(3) social workers; 
(4) therapists; 
(5) counselors; 
(6) health aides; 
(7) spiritual care providers; and 
(8) other health care professionals; 
Whereas there is a need to increase train-
ing opportunities for health care profes-
sionals to receive interdisciplinary team- 
based training in palliative care and hospice; 
Whereas hospice focuses on quality of life 
through pain management and symptom 
control, caregiver assistance, and emotional 
and spiritual support, with the goal of allow-
ing patients to live fully until the end of life, 
surrounded and supported by loved ones, 
friends, and caregivers; 
Whereas trained palliative care and hos-
pice professionals, during a time of trauma 
and loss, can provide grief and bereavement 
support services to individuals with a serious 
illness or injury, the family members of 
those individuals, and others; 
Whereas palliative care is a patient and 
family-centered approach to care that— 
(1) provides relief from symptoms and 
stress; 
(2) can be complementary to curative 
treatments; and

November 17, 2021 
(3) improves the quality of life of the pa-
tient and their family; 
Whereas, in 2019, more than 1,660,000 indi-
viduals in the United States living with a se-
rious illness or injury, and the families of 
those individuals, received care and support 
from 
hospice 
programs 
in 
communities 
across the United States; 
Whereas volunteers continue to play a 
vital role in supporting hospice care and op-
erations; and 
Whereas palliative care and hospice pro-
viders encourage all patients to learn more 
about their options for care and to share 
their preferences with family, loved ones, 
and health care professionals: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates November 2021 as ‘‘National 
Hospice and Palliative Care Month’’; and 
(2) encourages the people of the United 
States— 
(A) to increase their understanding and 
awareness of— 
(i) care for hospice patients with a serious 
illness or injury; and 
(ii) the benefits of integrating palliative 
care early into the treatment plans for pa-
tients with a serious illness or injury; 
(B) to recognize the care and dedication 
of— 
(i) millions of family caregivers; and 
(ii) tens of thousands of palliative care and 
hospice staff and volunteers; and

liative Care Month’’ with appropriate activi-
ties and programs.

At the end of title XII, add the following: 
Subtitle H—U.S.-Greece Defense and 
Interparliamentary Partnership Act of 2021 
SEC. 1291. SHORT TITLE. 
This subtitle may be cited as the ‘‘U.S.- 
Greece Defense and Interparliamentary Part-
nership Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 1292. FINDINGS. 
Congress makes the following findings: 
(1) The United States and Greece are 
strong allies in the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization (NATO) and have deepened 
their defense relationship in recent years in 
response to growing security challenges in 
the Eastern Mediterranean region. 
(2) Greece participates in several NATO 
missions, including Operation Sea Guardian 
in the Mediterranean and NATO’s mission in 
Kosovo. 
(3) The Eastern Mediterranean Security 
and Energy Partnership Act (title II of divi-
sion J of Public Law 116–94), authorized new 
security assistance for Greece and Cyprus, 
lifted the United States prohibition on arms 
transfers to Cyprus, and authorized the es-
tablishment of a United States-Eastern Med-
iterranean Energy Center to facilitate en-
ergy cooperation among the United States, 
Greece, Israel, and Cyprus. 
(4) The United States has demonstrated its 
support for the trilateral partnership of 
Greece, Israel, and Cyprus through joint en-
gagement with Cyprus, Greece, Israel, and 
the United States in the ‘‘3+1’’ format. 
(5) The United States and Greece have held 
Strategic Dialogue meetings in Athens, 
Washington D.C., and virtually, and have 
committed to hold an upcoming Strategic 
Dialogue session in 2021 in Washington, D.C. 
(6) In October 2019, the United States and 
Greece agreed to update the United States- 
Greece Mutual Defense Cooperation Agree-
ment, and the amended agreement officially 
entered into force on February 13, 2020. 
(7) The amended Mutual Defense Coopera-
tion Agreement provides for increased joint 
United States-Greece and NATO activities at 
Greek 
military 
bases 
and 
facilities 
in 
Larissa, Stefanovikio, Alexandroupolis, and 
other parts of central and northern Greece, 
and allows for infrastructure improvements 
at the United States Naval Support Activity 
Souda Bay base on Crete. 
(8) In October 2020, Greek Foreign Minister 
Nikos Dendias announced that Greece hopes 
to further expand the Mutual Defense Co-
operation Agreement with the United States. 
(9) The United States Naval Support Activ-
ity Souda Bay serves as a critical naval lo-
gistics hub for the United States Navy’s 6th 
Fleet. 
(10) In June 2020, United States Ambas-
sador to Greece Geoffrey Pyatt characterized 
the importance of Naval Support Activity 
Souda Bay as ‘‘our most important platform 
for the projection of American power into a 
strategically dynamic Eastern Mediterra-
nean region. From Syria to Libya to the 
chokepoint of the Black Sea, this is a criti-
cally important asset for the United States, 
as our air force, naval, and other resources 
are applied to support our Alliance obliga-
tions and to help bring peace and stability.’’. 
(11) The USS Hershel ‘‘Woody’’ Williams, 
the second of a new class of United States 
sea-basing ships, is now based out of Souda 
Bay, the first permanent United States naval 
deployment at the base. 
(12) The United States cooperates with the 
Hellenic 
Armed 
Forces 
at 
facilities 
in 
Larissa, Stefanovikio, and Alexandroupolis, 
where the United States Armed Forces con-
duct training, refueling, temporary mainte-
nance, storage, and emergency response. 
(13) The United States has conducted a 
longstanding International Military Edu-
cation and Training (IMET) program with 
Greece, and the Government of Greece has 
committed to provide $3 for every dollar in-
vested by the United States in the program. 
(14) Greece’s defense spending in 2020 
amounted to an estimated 2.68 percent of its 
gross domestic product (GDP), exceeding 
NATO’s 2 percent of GDP benchmark agreed 
to at the 2014 NATO Summit in Wales. 
(15) Greece is eligible for the delivery of ex-
cess defense articles under section 516(c)(2) of 
the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 
2321j(c)(2)). 
(16) In September 2020, Greek Prime Min-
ister Kyriakos Mitsotakis announced plans 
to modernize all three branches of the Hel-
lenic Armed Forces, which will strengthen 
Greece’s military position in the Eastern 
Mediterranean. 
(17) The modernization includes upgrades 
to the arms of all three branches, including 
new anti-tank weapons for the Hellenic 
Army, new heavy-duty torpedoes for the Hel-
lenic Navy, and new guided missiles for the 
Hellenic Air Force. 
(18) The Hellenic Navy also plans to up-
grade its four MEKO 200HN frigates and pur-
chase four new multirole frigates of an un-
disclosed type, to be accompanied by 4 MH- 
60R anti-submarine helicopters. 
(19) The Hellenic Air Force plans to fully 
upgrade its fleet of F–16 jets to the F–16 
Viper variant by 2027 and has expressed in-
terest in participating in the F–35 Joint 
Strike Fighter program. 
SEC. 1293. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
It is the sense of Congress that— 
(1) Greece is a pillar of stability in the 
Eastern 
Mediterranean 
region 
and 
the 
United States should remain committed to 
supporting its security and prosperity; 
(2) the 3+1 format of cooperation among 
Cyprus, Greece, Israel, and the United States 
has been a successful forum to cooperate on 
energy issues and should be expanded to in-
clude other areas of common concern to the 
members; 
(3) the United States should increase and 
deepen efforts to partner with and support 
the modernization of the Greek military; 
(4) it is in the interests of the United

duced 
platforms 
and 
weapons 
systems

continue to deepen strong partnerships with 
the Greek military, especially in co-develop-
ment and co-production opportunities with

(10) in accordance with its legal authorities 
and project selection criteria, the United 
States Development Finance Corporation 
should consider supporting private invest-
ment in strategic infrastructure projects in 
Greece, to include shipyards and ports that 
contribute to the security of the region and 
Greece’s prosperity; 
(11) the extension of the Mutual Defense 
Cooperation Agreement with Greece for a pe-
riod of five years includes deepened partner-
ships at Greek military facilities throughout 
the country and is a welcome development; 
and 
(12) the United States Government should 
establish the United States-Eastern Medi-
terranean Energy Center as authorized in 
the Eastern Mediterranean Energy and Secu-
rity Partnership Act of 2019.

feasible, of the funds appropriated for the 
European Recapitalization Incentive Pro-
gram, $25,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2022

as appropriate to assist the country in meet-
ing its defense needs and transitioning away

stitutions, including the Food and Agri-
culture Organization of the United Nations 
(FAO), the World Organisation for Animal 
Health (OIE), the World Health Organization 
(WHO), and the United Nations Environment 
Programme (UNEP), together with leading 
intergovernmental and nongovernmental or-
ganizations, veterinary and medical colleges, 
the Department of State, and the United 
States Agency for International Develop-
ment (USAID), should promote the paradigm 
of One Health as an effective and integrated 
way to address the complexity of emerging 
disease threats, and should support improved 
community health, biodiversity conserva-
tion, forest conservation and management, 
sustainable agriculture, and safety of live-
stock, domestic animals, and wildlife in de-
veloping countries, particularly in tropical 
landscapes where there is an elevated risk of 
zoonotic disease spill over. 
SEC. 1076. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
It is the policy of the United States to— 
(1) support the availability of scalable and 
sustainable alternative sources of protein 
and nutrition for local communities, where 
appropriate, in order to minimize human re-
liance on the commercial trade in live wild-
life for human consumption; 
(2) support foreign governments to— 
(A) reduce commercial trade in live wild-
life for human consumption; 
(B) transition from the commercial trade 
in live wildlife for human consumption to 
sustainably produced alternate protein and 
nutritional sources; 
(C) establish and effectively manage and 
protect natural habitat, including protected 
and conserved areas and the lands of Indige-
nous peoples and local communities, particu-
larly 
in 
countries 
with 
tropical 
forest 
hotspots for emerging diseases; and 
(D) strengthen public health capacity, par-
ticularly in countries where there is a high 
risk of emerging zoonotic viruses and other 
infectious diseases; 
(3) respect the rights and needs of indige-
nous peoples and local communities depend-
ent on such wildlife for nutritional needs and 
food security; and 
(4) facilitate international cooperation by 
working with international partners through 
intergovernmental, international, and non-
governmental organizations such as the 
United Nations to— 
(A) lead a resolution at the United Nations 
Security Council or General Assembly and 
World Health Assembly outlining the danger 
to human and animal health from emerging 
zoonotic 
infectious 
diseases, 
with 
rec-
ommendations for implementing the closure 
of wildlife markets and prevention of the 
commercial trade in live wildlife for human 
consumption, except where the consumption 
of wildlife is necessary for local food secu-
rity or where such actions would signifi-
cantly disrupt a readily available and irre-
placeable food supply; 
(B) raise awareness and build stakeholder 
engagement networks, including civil soci-
ety, the private sector, and local and re-
gional governments on the dangerous poten-
tial of wildlife markets as a source of 
zoonotic diseases and reduce demand for the 
consumption of wildlife through evidence- 
based behavior change programs, while en-
suring that existing wildlife habitat is not 
encroached upon or destroyed as part of this 
process; 
(C) encourage and support alternative 
forms of sustainable food production, farm-
ing, and shifts to sustainable sources of pro-
tein and nutrition instead of terrestrial wild-
life, where able and appropriate, and reduce 
consumer demand for terrestrial and fresh-
water wildlife through enhanced local and 
national food systems, especially in areas 
where wildlife markets play a significant 
role in meeting subsistence needs while en-
suring that existing wildlife habitat is not 
encroached upon or destroyed as part of this 
process; and 
(D) strive to increase biosecurity and hygi-
enic standards implemented in farms, gath-
ering centers, transport, and market systems 
around the globe, especially those special-
izing in the provision of products intended 
for human consumption.

ernments, multilateral entities, intergovern-
mental organizations, international part-
ners, private sector partners, and nongovern-
mental organizations to carry out activities 
supporting the following objectives, recog-
nizing that multiple interventions will like-
ly be necessary to make an impact, and that 
interventions will need to be tailored to the 
situation to— 
(1) immediately close wildlife markets 
which contain taxa listed pursuant to sec-
tion 1074 and uncontrolled, unsanitary, or il-
licit wildlife markets and prevent associated 
commercial trade in live wildlife, placing a

CAUSES
OF 
ZOONOTIC DISEASE OUTBREAKS.—The Adminis-
trator of the United States Agency for Inter-
national Development, in consultation with 
the Secretary of the Interior, shall increase 
activities in United States Agency for Inter-
national Development programs related to 
conserving biodiversity, combating wildlife 
trafficking, sustainable landscapes, global 
health, food security, and resilience in order 
to address the threats and causes of zoonotic 
disease outbreaks, including through— 
(A) education; 
(B) capacity building; 
(C) strengthening human, livestock, and 
wildlife health monitoring systems of patho-
gens of zoonotic origin to support early de-
tection and reporting of novel and known 
pathogens for emergence of zoonotic disease 
and strengthening cross-sectoral collabora-
tion to align risk reduction approaches in 
consultation with the Director of the Cen-
ters for Disease Control and the Secretary of 
Health and Human Services; 
(D) improved domestic and wild animal 
disease monitoring and control at production

systems, particularly in tropical countries, 
to prevent the creation of new pathways for 
zoonotic pathogen transmission that arise 
from interactions among wildlife, humans, 
and livestock populations; 
(G) minimizing interactions between do-
mestic livestock and wild animals in mar-
kets and captive production; 
(H) supporting shifts from wildlife markets 
to diversified, safe, affordable, and accessible

APPRECIATING 
CHAIRMAN 
HUGH 
LEATHERMAN 
WHO 
PASSED 
AWAY FRIDAY 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, November 17, 2021 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, Roxanne, a native of Florence, and 
I extend our thoughts and prayers for Jean 
and the family of South Carolina State Senate 
Finance Chairman Hugh Leatherman of Flor-
ence. 
I was grateful to serve with Chairman 
Leatherman for 17 years in the State Senate 
and I saw firsthand his determined service for 
the citizens of the Pee Dee. He was relentless 
recruiting industries to locate for jobs and it is 
appropriate the new billion dollar terminal for 
the Port of Charleston is named in his honor. 
We worked together as conservative Demo-
crats and Republicans in the State Senate to 
develop The Renegades, challenging the sta-
tus quo. With his party switch to Republican, 
he was unleashed to promote limited govern-
ment with expanded freedom, leading to the 
Republican majority today. 
The following is the obituary provided by the 
Waters-Powell Funeral Home: 
Senator Hugh K. Leatherman, Sr., died 
peacefully at his home on Friday, November 
12, 2021, after a recent non-COVID related ill-
ness. He was surrounded by his beloved wife, 
children, and his grandchildren. 
Senator Leatherman was born in Lincoln 
County, North Carolina on April 14, 1931, the 
son of the late John and Ada Gantt 
Leatherman. In addition to his parents, he 
was predeceased by his brother, Ralph 
Leatherman. He is survived by his loving 
wife of 43 years, Jean Helms Leatherman, his 
children: Sheila Hardee (John), Hugh Ken-
neth Leatherman, Jr., MD (Sue), Karen 
Leatherman 
(Robin 
Parker), 
Lynn 
Leatherman, Amy L. Smith (Merritt), Sarah 
L. Allen, MD (Keels). Grandchildren: Hugh K. 
Leatherman, III (Cate), Alice Anne Coakley 
(John), John N. Hardee, II, Ada Cathryn 
Allen, McCauley Allen, Louise Allen, Mary 
Keels Allen and Lula Smith. Great-grand-
children: Hugh K. Leatherman, IV, Tucker 
Leatherman, and John A. Coakley, V. Hugh 
is also survived by his sisters Jewell Eggle-
ston (Max) and Jeanette Schalow (Dick) 
along with niece, Tracy Eggleston. 
A well-known public servant and successful 
businessman, Senator Leatherman received 
a Bachelor of Science degree in civil engi-
neering from North Carolina State Univer-
sity. In 1955, he formed Florence Concrete 
Products in Florence, South Carolina, which 
grew into a successful business with over 147 
employees and is still in operation to this 
day. 
In 1967, he was elected to Town Council in 
Quinby, South Carolina and in 1980, he was 
elected to the South Carolina Senate where 
he continued to serve until his death. During 
his tenure in the Senate, he held many lead-
ership positions including President Pro 
Tempore from 2014–2019 and Chairman of the 
Senate Finance Committee from 2001 until 
his death. 
His legacy is felt at home and across the 
entire state. He played a leading role in re-
cruiting Honda and Boeing, among many 
others, to open plants in South Carolina as 
well as obtained funding to improve the 
South Carolina Port. A terminal at the Port 
was named in his honor for his ongoing ef-
forts in support of this important driver to 
our state’s economic development. He was 
also a leading advocate to improve South 
Carolina’s road infrastructure. 
A tireless leader and champion for Flor-
ence County, he dedicated his life to improv-
ing his cherished Pee Dee region with an em-
phasis on education, infrastructure, and job 
creation. Senator Leatherman played a vital 
role in gaining support and funds for en-
hancements to Francis Marion University, 
the Florence Veteran’s Village, The Con-
tinuum Center for Education and Training, 
and Florence-Darlington Technical College, 
among many others. He was also key in cre-
ating the Pee Dee Medical Health Education 
Consortium that will enhance medical and 
health science education at Francis Marion. 
Senator Leatherman knew first-hand the 
importance of a quality education and at-
tributed much of his success to family and 
teachers who believed in him and ensured he 
became the first member of his family to 
graduate from college. He passed on this love 
of education to his children ensuring a col-
lege education became the norm and not the 
exception. He was often quoted as saying, 
‘‘They can take everything away from you, 
but they can’t take away your education.’’ 
Senator Leatherman was an active mem-
ber of Central United Methodist Church and 
the Florence Rotary Club.

last 36 years, the people of Susquehanna Val-
ley have known Kim as an anchor of WGAL’ 
s evening news, serving as their Senior An-
chor. Kim has been the longest serving anchor 
in the station’s history. She has earned 12 
Mid-Atlantic Emmy Awards and many other 
distinguished recognitions for her reporting. 
Beyond sharing the news with our commu-
nity, Kim has worked to give back. She has 
supported charitable efforts for the Children’s 
Miracle Network, The Salvation Army, The Ex-
traordinary Give and more. She also has been 
an advocate on behalf of families who are car-
ing for loved ones with dementia, as she cares 
for her husband John who has Lewy Body De-
mentia. 
Kim said that it was ‘‘her lifelong dream to 
work at WGAL 8.’’ And so, we thank her for 
living out her dream to faithfully share the 
news with our community for so many years. 
We wish her continued success and happi-
ness in her retirement.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE LIFE OF 
BISHOP DR. MACY CARR 
HON. MIKE ROGERS 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, November 17, 2021 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize the remarkable life of 
Bishop Dr. Macy Carr who passed away on 
November 5, 2021. 
Macy Carr was born in Anniston, Alabama, 
on May 14, 1942 to Joseph and Mattie Carr. 
He was the second of eight children. He grad-
uated from Cobb High School in 1962. He at-
tended Alabama State University prior to en-
listing in the United States Army in 1963. His 
military decorations include the National De-
fense Service Medal, the Vietnam Campaign 
Medal with one device, the Overseas Bar, the 
Army good conduct medal and qualified as a 
sharpshooter twice on the M–16 and M–14 ri-
fles. 
After serving in the Army, Carr returned 
home and devoted his life to Christ. He began 
as a member of Miracle Revival Temple 
(MRT) under the leadership of Pastor Ruby K. 
Blackwell and Elder Paul Blackwell, Sr. He be-
came head Deacon and a member of the 
evangelistic team. 
Not only did Bishop Carr find the Lord and 
a church home at MRT, but he also found his 
wife, Sister Lana T. Carr. 
He united with the Back to the Bible Ministry 
under Bishop Raymond Moss, Sr. It all began 
in the basement of Carr’s house. His family 
made the weekly trek to Marietta, Georgia, for 
seven years. This established the Alabama 
Back to the Bible Miracle Revival Fellowship 
Church in September of 1987. 
In 2010, The Alabama Back to the Bible 
Church entered the family of Full Gospel Holy 
Temple Church Inc. under the late Apostle 
Lobias Murray and the late Evangelist Dr. 
Shirley Murray. Bishop Carr was blessed to 
see his son and daughter-in-law, Elder Chris-
topher D. Carr, Sr. and Lady LaShunda S. 
Carr elevated to Pastor and First Lady of An-
niston Full Gospel Holy Temple Church Inc. 
just before his transition. 
He was blessed with four wonderful chil-
dren, 16 grandchildren, four great-grand-
children and one on the way. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in remem-
bering Bishop Carr and his life of service.

IN MEMORY OF NORM HARDEE 
HON. TOM COLE 
OF OKLAHOMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, November 17, 2021 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, in the early 
morning hours of Sunday, November 14, 
Norm Hardee entered eternal life and joined 
the communion of saints after a more than 30- 
year battle with Parkinson’s disease. He was 
surrounded by those who loved him, including 
his soul mate, Jana. 
Norm was born on March 14, 1948 to 
Donnie and Mary Hardee in Mullins, South 
Carolina. He was raised a poor sharecropper’s 
son in the tobacco fields of North Carolina. 
Norm enlisted in the U.S. Navy January 6, 
1969, which enabled him to find and marry the 
love of his life, Jana Nall, in 1973. Norm went 
on to become a commissioned officer in the 
Navy, serving for 20 years until his retirement 
in 1989. When he gave his final salute, he 
didn’t hesitate to head west to his adopted 
home of Oklahoma. 
Following his Naval career, he went on to 
become the electronics instructor at the 
Pontotoc County Career Tech Center in Ada, 
Oklahoma. Norm made a positive and lasting 
impact on the lives of many who served with 
him in the Navy as well as his students in the 
classroom. He was a proud father to two chil-
dren, Jill and Ben, a doting Papa to five 
grandchildren, and one great granddaughter. 
He is survived by his loving wife of 48 
years, Jana; daughter, Jill Daugherty and hus-
band Michael; son, Ben Hardee and wife

RECOGNIZING PASTOR JAMES D. 
CORBETT 
HON. GREGORY F. MURPHY 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, November 17, 2021 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to pay a heartfelt tribute 
to Pastor James D. Corbett of Greenville, 
North Carolina, to honor his long and illus-
trious life in service to his God and country. 
In 1977, Pastor James D. Corbett became a 
born-again believer and received the baptism 
of the Holy Spirit while serving in the United 
States Army. After eight years of active duty in 
the military, God called Pastor Corbett into the 
ministry. He returned to Greenville, NC, where 
he attended Pitt Community College. Pastor 
Corbett later received a BSA degree in Ac-
counting from East Carolina University where 
he was a two-time honor graduate. Pastor 
Corbett went on to earn his Doctoral degree in 
Biblical Studies and Divinity from the World 
Christian College Council in Fresno, California 
in December 1994. He also received an Hon-
orary Degree from Covenant Theological Sem-
inary in Creve Coeur, Missouri. Pastor Corbett 
currently serves as the Eastern Regional Di-
rector and Trustee for the International Con-
vention of Faith Ministries. 
In 1984, Pastor Corbett and the late Pastor 
Delores Corbett founded Greenville Commu-
nity Christian Church. God gave him a vision 
to minister to the whole man: spirit, soul and 
body. The vision includes reaching commu-
nities with the gospel and taking the message 
of Jesus Christ around the world. It includes 
mass media presentation, training sessions, 
schools for ministry, programs for the dis-
advantaged and a Christian K–12 school. 
His practical teaching is done through indi-
vidualized group fellowships, seminars, cru-
sades, the Word in Season devotional, CDs, 
books, radio, internet and television broad-
casts. His messages are widely distributed 
throughout the world. Lives are being saved, 
healed and delivered by the power of God 
through his ministry. He is also an author of 
three books: Men of Honor, Tithing the Tithe 
and Honoring Your Husband-Honoring Your 
Wife. 
Pastor James D. Corbett and Lady Sarah 
were united in marriage in February 2013. 
They have five children, fourteen grand-
children and five great-grandchildren. To-
gether, they help meet the needs of people by 
reaching the lost for Christ. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in honoring 
the accomplishments of Pastor James D. 
Corbett and recognizing all that he has done 
for his community.

RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE OF 
MIKE MADDOX 
HON. RALPH NORMAN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, November 17, 2021 
Mr. NORMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the lifesaving and heroic actions 
of Mike Maddox of Rock Hill, South Carolina. 
On the evening of August 13, 2021, Mike 
was enjoying a quiet evening out to dinner 
with his wife and members of their church 
family. While dining, Mike noticed a gentleman 
at a nearby table began choking. He quickly 
realized the gentleman had a complete airway 
obstruction and immediately sprang into ac-
tion. With confidence and composure, Mike di-
rected bystanders to call 911 while he began 
performing the Heimlich maneuver repeatedly 
until the gentleman’s airway cleared. The gen-
tleman soon resumed breathing and was then 
examined by EMS. Throughout the evening, 
Mike displayed brave yet humble leadership. 
In addition to these valiant actions, Mike is 
also an involved and dedicated community 
leader. A strong man of faith, Mike is an active 
member of the West End Baptist Church and 
a Lieutenant Colonel in the South Carolina 
State Guard Chaplains Corps. Mike has also 
achieved great professional success and cur-
rently serves as a corporate Vice President 
with Bayview Financial.

HON. SUZAN K. DelBENE 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, November 17, 2021 
Ms. DELBENE. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to thank Mary Kate McTague for three years 
of invaluable service to my office and my con-
stituents in Washington’s 1st Congressional 
District. Mary Kate joined my office as an in-
tern in September 2018, became my sched-
uler in January 2019, and was promoted to di-
rector of operations in May 2021. In each of 
these roles, Mary Kate exceeded the mark 
and met the challenges that come with run-
ning congressional operations with her signa-
ture resourcefulness, quick wit, and joyful per-
sonality. Over her tenure, she played an in-
strumental role in overseeing the smooth man-
agement of a fast-paced office and shaping in-
ternal processes—all while building lasting re-
lationships with my team and those who had 
the pleasure of getting to know her. Mary Kate 
has grown into an amazing leader, and we will 
sorely miss her. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Mary Kate and wishing her the 
best on her next step, one that she will un-
doubtedly rise to meet and make the most of.

tinues to show to this day. 
For 102 years, Mr. DeHerrera has led an

gress and recognize his noble service.
