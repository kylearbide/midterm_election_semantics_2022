PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret

prayer: 
Holy God, create in us a pure heart. 
Fill us with new life and a steadfast 
spirit. As we acknowledge the sins of 
our past, do not cast us from Your 
presence, but grant us Your mercy. 
Holy spirit, inspire us to be one will 
with Your own. When we are inclined 
to cruelty and unkindness, summon us 
to unity with Your perfect will that we 
would endure the temptation to hurt or 
hate but pursue Your truth in the 
trials around us. 
Holy Redeemer, restore to us the joy 
of Your salvation. Give us confidence 
in Your deliverance, that we would 
breathe freely believing—knowing—we 
are wholly Yours to follow You, to 
glow with the light of Your love, and to 
live into the promise of Your eternity. 
Grant 
that 
our 
lives 
would 
be 
strengthened to go forth to serve You 
and Your creation. May this day we 
love as You have loved and do as You 
would do. 
By the power of Your spirit and in 
Your most holy name we pray. 
Amen.

Vol. 167 
WASHINGTON, TUESDAY, MAY 25, 2021 
No. 91 
Senate 
The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the Honorable RAPH-
AEL G. WARNOCK, a Senator from the 
State of Georgia. 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal God, You watch over those 
who seek to serve Your purposes. You 
surround them with Your favor, pro-
viding for all their needs and empow-
ering them to become more than con-
querors in fulfilling Your will. 
May the reverential gratitude of our 
Senators fill them with hope for all the 
days to come. Teach them to live lives 
of complete honesty as they seek to 
stay on the pathway You have provided 
for their lives. 
Lord, as You teach our lawmakers to 
live according to Your truth, rescue 
them from the forces that seek to bring 
pain and disgrace. 
We pray in Your powerful Name. 
Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The Presiding Officer led the Pledge 
of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

APPOINTMENT OF ACTING 
PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will please read a communication 
to the Senate from the President pro 
tempore (Mr. LEAHY). 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read the following letter: 
U.S. SENATE, 
PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE, 
Washington, DC, May 25, 2021. 
To the Senate: 
Under the provisions of rule I, paragraph 3, 
of the Standing Rules of the Senate, I hereby 
appoint the Honorable RAPHAEL G. WARNOCK, 
a Senator from the State of Georgia, to per-
form the duties of the Chair. 
PATRICK J. LEAHY, 
President pro tempore. 
Mr. WARNOCK thereupon assumed 
the Chair as Acting President pro tem-
pore. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader is recog-
nized. 
f 
MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, before 
I begin on the prepared remarks I have, 
I note that, this morning, MARJORIE 
TAYLOR
GREENE, a Republican Con-
gresswoman from Georgia, once again, 
compared preparations taken against 
COVID to the Holocaust. These are 
sickening, 
reprehensible 
comments, 
and she should stop this vile language 
immediately. 
f 
NOMINATION OF KRISTEN M. 
CLARKE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, a year 
ago today, on another front equally im-
portant, George Floyd was murdered in 
broad daylight by a police officer sworn 
to protect and serve. Our country was 
forever changed by the stomach-churn-
ing video of Derek Chauvin killing Mr. 
Floyd. 
It sparked a summer of protest un-
like any we have seen in American his-
tory. Around the world, the name of 
George Floyd was chanted in Rome, 
Paris, and London, Amsterdam, Berlin, 
and Mexico City. As recently as this 
weekend, professional soccer players in 
the British Premier League knelt be-
fore the game in support of the global 
movement against racism touched off 
by George Floyd. 
This was not only a fight for justice 
for one man and his family, whom I 
have had the privilege to meet with, 
but a fight against the discrimination 
that Black men and women suffer at 
the hands of state power not just here 
in America but around the globe. It is 
a fight that continues today. 
Here in the Senate, we will continue 
that fight when we vote to confirm the 
first woman—the first Black woman— 
to ever lead the Justice Department’s 
Civil Rights Division, which was cre-
ated in 1957 as the civil rights move-
ment began to uphold the constitu-
tional rights of all Americans but par-
ticularly the most vulnerable. When it 
comes to justice in policing, the crimi-
nal justice system, and at the ballot 
box, the Civil Rights Division is often 
the tip of the spear: conducting inves-
tigations of police departments with 
patterns or practices of constitutional 
violations and defending the funda-
mental voting rights of every Amer-
ican citizen. 
So, in a way, as we continue to pur-
sue strong policing reform legislation, 
it is appropriate that we confirm 
Kristen Clarke—a proven civil rights 
leader—to the position of Assistant At-
torney General, where she can continue 
the fight against bigotry in many 
ways. It is appropriate we do it today. 
Though my Republican colleagues 
have tried to twist her words to make 
her sound like some radical, Ms. Clarke 
is, in reality, a hugely accomplished 
civil rights attorney who has earned 
the respect of all sides. Much like her 
future colleague at the Justice Depart-
ment, Vanita Gupta, Kristen Clarke 
has been endorsed by a wide range of 
law enforcement groups. The truth is, 
Ms. Clarke will make an exceptional 
leader of the Civil Rights Division. 
So, again, in a very significant way, 
as we continue to pursue strong polic-
ing reform legislation, the fight for ra-
cial justice by confirming Kristen 
Clarke on the anniversary of George 
Floyd’s murder is particularly poign-
ant and appropriate. 
Of course, Congress must also pursue 
strong legislation to end racial bias in

law enforcement. Senators BOOKER and 
SCOTT, as well as Representative BASS 
and others, have been working dili-
gently behind the scenes to fashion 
such a bill on a bipartisan basis. That 
important work must continue as we 
strive to ensure George Floyd’s tragic 
death will not be in vain. 
f 
U.S. INNOVATION AND 
COMPETITION ACT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, on an-
other matter, the Senate continues to 
work on the U.S. Innovation and Com-
petition legislation that will lay the 
foundation for the next century of 
American economic leadership. 
I have spoken a lot about the sub-
stance of this bill. So, this morning, I 
want to reinforce how bipartisan and 
inclusive this bill is. It is the product 
of at least a half a dozen Senate com-
mittees, meaning that nearly every 
single Member of the Senate has had 
fingerprints on this bill in one way or 
another. 
The two pieces of legislation that 
form the core of the bill—the Endless 
Frontier Act and the Strategic Com-
petition Act—passed out of committee 
on overwhelmingly bipartisan votes: 24 
to 4 in the Commerce Committee and 
21 to 1 in the Foreign Relations Com-
mittee. That kind of bipartisanship— 
almost unanimous support in multiple 
Senate committees—is rare when it 
comes to major legislation. It goes to 
show just how bipartisan this issue is 
and this legislation is as, literally, doz-
ens of bipartisan amendments were 
added to the bill before it ever reached 
the floor. 
Here on the floor, we are going to 
continue working through a series of 
amendments from both sides. With 
such a depth of cooperation and con-
sensus between our two parties, there 
will be no reason we can’t wrap up this 
bill this week and achieve a strong re-
sult for our country. Leader MCCON-
NELL should be welcoming this biparti-
sanship as we move forward on the bill. 
f 
WASHINGTON, D.C. ADMISSION ACT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, on a 
final matter, later today, a group of 
Senators will come to the floor to high-
light an important issue: DC statehood. 
The District of Columbia has more 
residents than in Vermont and Wyo-
ming and has nearly the same number 
as Delaware, Alaska, and several other 
States. They have the same obligations 
of citizenship. DC residents pay Fed-
eral taxes. They can be summoned for 
juries. They have served in every war 
since the Revolution, but they are all 
denied real representation here in Con-
gress. 
DC statehood is an idea whose time 
has come. So I want to thank Senator 
CARPER for organizing a group of Sen-
ators to shine a spotlight on this issue 
today. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY 
LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican leader is recog-
nized. 
f 
ISRAEL 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, the 
world is relieved that Hamas has 
stopped firing rockets at Israel’s cities 
and, for the moment, the fighting has 
stopped. 
Israel’s response to Hamas’s ter-
rorism was entirely justified. It was 
targeted, 
restrained, 
and 
extraor-
dinarily 
precise. 
So 
it 
was 
dis-
appointing 
to 
see 
disproportionate 
blame heaped upon Israel, the victim, 
and disproportionate pressure put on 
Israel’s democratic, coalition govern-
ment to spearhead the cease-fire with 
the aggressors. 
Israel’s actions appear to have helped 
restore some measure of deterrence and 
damaged Hamas’s ability to wage ter-
ror, but we have every reason to expect 
the terrorist commanders will seek to 
rebuild their arsenal with assistance 
from their sponsors in Tehran. 
The Biden administration must not 
pursue Iran policies that make this 
process even easier. We should not lift 
terrorism and missile sanctions just to 
leap back into discussions over the 
flawed Obama-era nuclear deal. Al-
ready, this administration removed 
terrorism sanctions on Iran’s Houthi 
proxies in Yemen, hoping to encourage 
negotiations. Instead, the Houthis have 
escalated their offensive, rejected di-
plomacy, and actually fired into Saudi 
Arabia. Likewise, giving Iran relief 
from sanctions will just yield more 
support for terrorists like Hezbollah 
and Hamas. 
Now, I am encouraged that the Presi-
dent has committed to refilling Israel’s 
Iron Dome stockpiles. I hope his budget 
proposal coming this Friday will make 
room for increased military assistance 
to Israel and reflect the fact that 
America’s interests are not served by 
cutting our own defense budget. 
Sadly, here in Congress, more and 
more Democrats are falling under the 
anti-Israel influence of the farthest left 
branch. From the junior Senator from 
Vermont, we have a resolution to block 
a routine sale of precision-guided mu-
nitions that would make it harder for 
Israel to avoid civilian casualties as it 
defends itself; from a Congresswoman 
from New York, the accusation that 
Israel is an ‘‘apartheid state.’’ 
Historically, support for Israel has 
been bipartisan. During the last major 
flare-up with Hamas back in 2014, when 
hundreds of rockets were fired at 
Israel, the Senate passed a resolution 
reaffirming our support for Israel and 
making clear Hamas’s responsibility 
for the violence, and we did it by unan-
imous consent. 
Back in 2019, after another rocket at-
tack, the Democratic leader insisted, 
‘‘No government can allow its civilians 
to be subject to rocket attack.’’ He 
said he stood ‘‘shoulder-to-shoulder 
with the people of Israel . . . and doing 
what they must do to defend their 
homeland.’’ 
That was true in 2019. Well, this 
month’s attacks involved not hundreds 
but literally thousands of rockets. Yet, 
instead of vocal support for Israel, 29 
Senate Democrats pressured Israel’s 
coalition government to stop defending 
itself. One of our colleagues who ran 
for President said the United States 
helping our ally means ‘‘supplying 
weapons to kill children.’’ Their base is 
energized. An open letter from hun-
dreds of former Democratic Party and 
campaign staffers has urged President 
Biden to be harder on Israel. Appar-
ently, a lot can change in just 2 years. 
Helping Israel defend itself against 
terrorists shouldn’t be a divisive issue. 
The Senate should vote on Senator 
SANDERS’ resolution and reject it over-
whelmingly. 
f 
ANTI-SEMITISM 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, now 
on a related matter, the despicable, 
age-old specter of anti-Semitism con-
tinues to rear its head, even here in our 
country. 
Last week, authorities from New 
York to Los Angeles were investigating 
assaults on Jewish people. According 
to press reports, in New York City, one 
Jewish man was kicked, punched, and 
sprayed with chemicals by five or six 
men yelling anti-Sematic things. That 
happened, by the way, right in Times 
Square. A synagogue in Arizona was 
vandalized. So was another in Illinois. 
A Jewish family visiting South Florida 
had a car pull up next to them and 
multiple occupants begin screaming: 
‘‘Free Palestine . . . die, Jew.’’ That is 
what he got for wearing his yarmulke 
in public. 
The head of the Anti-Defamation 
League said: 
We are tracking acts of harassment, van-
dalism, and violence as well as a torrent of 
online abuse . . . it’s happening all around 
the world. 
This garbage—this garbage didn’t 
begin a few weeks ago. It isn’t a re-
sponse to geopolitics. This hatred long 
predates the recent fighting between 
Israel and Hamas, and it hasn’t gone 
anywhere since the cease-fire. 
This spring, in the shadow of this 
Capitol Building, a U.S. Capitol Police 
officer was killed in broad daylight by 
an unbalanced follower of the Nation of 
Islam, the extremist group led by the 
anti-Semite Louis Farrakhan.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3387 
May 25, 2021 
This trash should be the easiest thing 
in the world for every person in a lead-
ership position to call out. But per-
haps—perhaps—because Israel has be-
come a strangely controversial issue on 
the far left, the condemnations do not 
seem to be flowing quite as easily and 
unequivocally as they should. 
Yesterday, a Democratic Congress-
man from Minnesota tweeted this: 
I’ll say the quiet part out loud. It’s time 
for ‘‘progressives’’ to start condemning anti- 
Semitism and violent attacks on Jewish peo-
ple with the same intention and vigor dem-
onstrated in other areas of activism. The si-
lence has been deafening. 
I couldn’t say it better myself. 
So Senator COTTON and I are intro-
ducing new legislation to fight anti- 
Semitism. Our bill will support State 
and local law enforcement and ensure 
the bigoted thugs who are attacking 
Jewish Americans face the full force of 
our justice system. 
I am proud to be cosponsoring this 
legislation, although I regret that in 
the year of 2021, it remains, unfortu-
nately, necessary. I hope every one of 
our colleagues will join Senator COT-
TON and myself. 
f 
AFGHANISTAN 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, now 
on one final matter, the President’s de-
cision to retreat from Afghanistan is 
not clear-eyed or strategic; it is dan-
gerous, wishful thinking. 
As discussions with the administra-
tion are making clear, this decision is 
not underpinned by a coherent plan to 
mitigate the geopolitical and humani-
tarian risks that our departure will 
create. 
When we are gone, after we leave, 
there is every reason to believe al- 
Qaida will regroup in its historic safe 
haven. Giving up the high ground while 
the enemy is still on the battlefield 
isn’t a strategic move. Neither is bank-
ing on conducting so-called ‘‘over the 
horizon’’ 
counterterrorism 
missions 
without presence on the ground. If we 
have learned anything in the fight 
against terrorists, it is the importance 
of reliable access and local partner-
ships. Give up the former, and we like-
ly lose the latter. 
The military currently flies both re-
connaissance 
and 
strike 
missions 
against terrorists from within Afghani-
stan. The country is not easy to get to. 
Its immediate neighbors are Iran, 
Pakistan, and Russian-influenced Cen-
tral Asian nations. They aren’t exactly 
likely to let us base significant coun-
terterrorism units in their countries. 
So where will we be basing these 
forces? How will we maintain sorties 
from thousands of miles away? How 
many forces will be required to secure 
our Embassy? If a pro-Taliban mob 
threatens to overrun it, what will we 
do to protect it? Where will a quick-re-
action force be based if not in Afghani-
stan? Will it be quick if its response 
time goes from minutes to hours? We 
learned from Benghazi the so-called 
tyranny of distance. If the Taliban 
takes Kabul, will the Biden administra-
tion recognize it as the legitimate gov-
ernment of Afghanistan? Will we shut-
ter our Embassy and our aid programs? 
The reality is, they don’t know. They 
can’t say. There is no plan. 
It is not courageous to abandon our 
allies. That is a view many Democrats 
said they held when the last President 
considered withdrawing from Syria and 
Afghanistan. But now, as Afghans, es-
pecially women and girls, face even 
worse dangers, many Democrats have 
suddenly become much less vocal. The 
horrific—horrific—reports 
of 
the 
Taliban beginning to reimpose their 
version of sharia law are just a taste of 
the catastrophes facing our friends in 
Afghanistan who have borne the brunt 
of the fight. Human rights. Women’s 
rights. Counterterrorism refugee flows. 
As far as I can tell, the administration 
has no plan. 
But the world is watching—allies and 
adversaries. Democrats can dress up 
this decision in flowery language, but 
the world will see it for what it is: re-
treating from the fight, abandoning 
our partners. 
This is the President’s decision. He 
chose precipitous withdrawal from Af-
ghanistan. Unbelievably, he even chose 
the anniversary of September 11 as the 
deadline. As his team belatedly con-
fronts him with the risks and the con-
sequences of this decision, I hope the 
President will think again and recon-
sider.

AFGHANISTAN 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, when I 
listened to the speech by Senator 
MCCONNELL, the Republican leader, 
about Afghanistan, it transported me 
back in history to October of 2002, 
when I was a U.S. Senator representing 
the State of Illinois, just days away 
from a reelection campaign, and we 
faced a historic vote here in the U.S. 
Senate. The vote was whether or not 
we would invade Iraq; whether the 
United States would give the President 
the authority to send American forces 
to Iraq. There were 23 votes against 
that invasion. I was 1 of them, 22 
Democrats and 1 Republican. 
I can remember that night so well. It 
was late, past midnight, when the vote 
was finally taken. But we had pre-
viously taken another vote, and al-
though I had voted against the inva-
sion of Iraq, I saw the invasion of Af-
ghanistan as a different story. We be-
lieved that Osama bin Laden and al- 
Qaida, responsible for 9/11, were in Af-
ghanistan. And the story was—the 
story line, and I bought it completely— 
if we don’t tell people like Osama bin 
Laden that there is a price to pay for 
attacking America and killing 3,000 in-
nocent people, who are we, and who 
will be the next attacker? 
So I voted. I voted for the invasion of 
Afghanistan and believed that was the 
right thing to do at that moment in 
history. That vote passed unanimously 
here in the Senate. There was only one 
dissenting vote in the House of Rep-
resentatives, Congresswoman BARBARA 
LEE of California. Virtually everyone 
else—everyone else, both political par-
ties—voted for the invasion of Afghani-
stan. 
I will tell you, there was not a single 
Senator or Congressman who would 
have stood up that evening on that 
vote and announced ‘‘I am prepared to 
vote for the longest war in American 
history,’’ because that is what we 
ended up voting for. 
It was our belief that if we came into 
Afghanistan, we could stop using this 
country as a haven for terrorism and 
we could help escort them into the 21st 
century. 
Well, after 20 years, after thousands 
of Americans gave their lives and thou-
sands more were critically injured, 
after the spending of trillions of dollars 
in Afghanistan, we learned a bitter les-
son. Our willingness was not enough. 
The people in Afghanistan have to be 
prepared to embrace change for it to 
happen. 
We had to create an army in Afghani-
stan, a security force. It virtually 
didn’t exist. The warlords had their 
military, and they were for sale, usu-
ally, to the highest bidder. And we 
were trying to create a national secu-
rity force. We were trying to create a 
nation, which was quite a challenge. 
I am not going to dwell on what hap-
pened, the bitter disappointments. But 
when I hear Senators come to the floor 
saying, ‘‘Isn’t it a shame that we are 
leaving Afghanistan? They are going to 
descend into chaos and many, many 
problems,’’ my question to them is: So 
what would you have us do? Continue

with the troops risking their lives in 
Afghanistan for another 20 years, for 
another trillion dollars? 
Not me. I believe we have reached a 
point where we have to do everything 
we can to help Afghanistan really 
progress into the 21st century. Yes, I 
feel a personal obligation to the men 
and women who risked their lives for 
our troops. 
For those who are opposed to or 
unaccepting of the notion of refugees 
coming to the United States, for good-
ness’ sake, let us have the character to 
stand behind those Afghan men and 
women who risked their lives for our 
soldiers and who are now probably 
marked by the Taliban for death them-
selves. Yes, I would open our doors to 
them. They gave their lives for our 
men and women, and we should never 
forget it. I hope my friends on the 
other side of the aisle who have strong 
feelings about immigration would at 
least realize that these individuals are 
critically important to our role in his-
tory and our message to the rest of the 
world when we seek their assistance. 
S. 1260 
Mr. President, this week we are going 
to consider a critically important bill 
that will help secure America’s role as 
a global leader in science and tech-
nology. 
The 
investments 
that 
the 
United States Innovation and Competi-
tion Act of 2021 makes in innovation 
will help ensure our prosperity and na-
tional security. It supports American 
research and development and will help 
to grow America’s industrial and man-
ufacturing base by investing in clean 
energy, 
cyber 
security, 
and 
bio-
technology. 
I thought a few years ago, reflected 
on the fact that I served in the House 
and Senate, there have been moments, 
particularly important moments that 
didn’t receive the recognition they de-
served, and one of them was a bipar-
tisan decision by several legislators: 
John Porter, who was a Republican 
Congressman from Illinois; Senator 
Arlen Specter, a Republican Senator 
from Pennsylvania; and Senator Tom 
Harkin, a Democratic Senator from 
Iowa. Back in the day, they made a de-
cision to try to double the research 
budget for the National Institutes of 
Health—quite an undertaking. I have 
seen a lot of things come and go with 
the Congress, and that I thought was as 
ambitious as it gets. 
They did it. They ended up doubling 
the NIH budget and received some rec-
ognition for it, but far less than what 
they deserved. 
So I went back out to the National 
Institutes of Health and spoke to Dr. 
Francis Collins, whom we are lucky as 
Americans to have in that position 
leading that great Agency. I said: Dr. 
Collins, I remember those days with 
Specter and Harkin and Porter. What 
can we do now, our generation, to help 
you at the National Institutes of 
Health? I don’t think I can double the 
budget. I wish I could. But what can I 
do? 
He said: Senator, if you could per-
suade Congress to give us 5 percent real 
growth every year—real growth over 
inflation—we will light up the score-
board. These researchers will stay on 
the job. They won’t worry about 
whether next year there is going to be 
funding. And you are going to see some 
remarkable things occur. 
I said I will set out to do that. I knew 
at the time that I needed help. So I 
turned to PATTY MURRAY on the Demo-
cratic side, who has been our leader at 
the HELP Committee and on the Ap-
propriations Committee. And we then 
turned to Senator ROY BLUNT of Mis-
souri, Republican leader of the sub-
committee, as well as Lamar Alex-
ander, our retired friend from the State 
of Tennessee. 
So the four of us came together, and 
in a span of 5 or 6 years, we took the 
NIH budget from $30 billion to $40 bil-
lion, just at the right moment. We 
didn’t anticipate COVID–19, but here it 
came, challenging us: Are we ready? 
Can we develop a vaccine in a timely 
fashion? 
And, thank goodness we could, be-
cause of the investment that we had 
made as a Congress and the American 
people in this Agency. It paid off. Not 
only did we save lives in the United 
States; we saved lives around the 
world, and we will continue to because 
of that good work. 
I came to believe that that was criti-
cally important and went to the De-
partment of Energy, sitting down with 
the Secretary, 5 or 6 years ago, and 
told him the story about our commit-
ment to NIH. And I said: You know, I 
guess it is conceivable that we will do 
research that will lead to some treat-
ment of Alzheimer’s and dementia. We 
know that it is picking up speed, unfor-
tunately, because people are living 
longer. 
He said: Do you have any idea what 
Agency of government is responsible 
for creating electronic means of moni-
toring this sort of change in our brains, 
the change that leads to Alzheimer’s? 
I said: No, I don’t. 
He said: Well, it is the Office of 
Science in the Department of Energy. 
And I thought to myself: DURBIN, you 
should have known better. It isn’t just 
the NIH. There are Agencies all around 
our Federal Government that are doing 
research that complement one another. 
So I came up with the notion to take 
that NIH model of 5 percent real 
growth and start applying it to all the 
other research and innovation Agencies 
of our Federal Government. 
This bill we are considering this 
week, this United States Innovation 
and Competition Act, acknowledges 
that and makes the investment in re-
search. I will tell you, I can’t think of 
anything we can do that is more bipar-
tisan and will be accepted by the Amer-
ican people than the knowledge that 
we are going to continue to encourage 
and subsidize, if you will, scientists 
and researchers to move us forward in 
innovation and technology. 
This bill increases funding for the 
National Science Foundation and the 
Department of Energy. That is going to 
spur research. It is going to help at 
universities around my State and all 
around the Nation, and it has been a 
priority, as I mentioned, for years. 
But one important way we can com-
pete economically in the world is by 
boosting support for domestic manu-
facturing and strengthening our do-
mestic supply chain. The legislation 
that we are considering this week does 
that exactly: $52 billion to boost our 
semi-conductor manufacturing capa-
bilities. This includes $10.5 billion for 
semiconductor research and develop-
ment; $2 billion for legacy chip produc-
tion to support the auto industry; $2 
billion for research, testing, and work-
force development for semiconductor 
needs at the Department of Defense; 
$500 million for coordination with for-
eign government partners to support 
international 
semiconductor 
supply 
chains. And importantly, this bill also 
ensures the payment of prevailing 
wages on construction projects that 
are supported by this funding. 
Many semiconductor manufacturing 
jobs already pay more than typical 
manufacturing jobs, and they should, 
but the workers who will help build the 
facilities 
won’t 
necessarily 
benefit 
from that unless we ensure the same 
standards that we apply to other feder-
ally funded construction projects apply 
here. 
Research shows us that providing 
prevailing wage boosts worker produc-
tivity and provides good value to tax-
payers. Several studies have found that 
construction costs are not affected by 
prevailing wage rates. It is our goal to 
compete with China and other nations, 
and China, unfortunately, has morally 
abhorrent labor practices. Let’s do bet-
ter. Let’s show them and the world 
that we can do better. 
In 1990, the United States produced 37 
percent of the world’s semiconductors. 
That was 30 years ago—30 years ago, 37 
percent. It is 12 percent today. What a 
dramatic decline. We want to turn that 
around. 
Now there are some who question us, 
who 
question 
whether 
the 
United 
States should invest in this kind of 
technology on semiconductors. I call 
them the second-place finishers. They 
decided that the United States can 
have a solid second-place finish from 
this point forward. I couldn’t disagree 
more. 
This Nation can lead by example and 
investment, and that is what this bill 
does. And those who are against it have 
to explain why giving dominance in 
this critical industry to another coun-
try, whether it is China or any other 
nation, is in the best interest of the 
growth of the United States and in the 
best interest of the next generation of 
American workers. 
We are already facing a global short-
age in microchips that led to layoffs in 
my State and in many other places. Il-
linois has been a leader in auto manu-
facturing, and I believe it will be in the

future, as well, thanks to dedicated 
workers like those at the Stellantis 
plant in Belvidere, IL, who assemble 
the car known as the Jeep Cherokee. 
Unfortunately, that plant had to shut 
down just a few weeks ago. Why? A 
global 
shortage 
of 
semiconductors. 
Earlier this month, Stellantis an-
nounced as many as 1,640 employees of 
the plant will be laid off in July be-
cause of the shortage. A similar story 
at Ford’s Chicago assembly plant that 
has 5,800 workers—this plant was idled 
through April, with shutdowns extend-
ing into May. 
We are not seeing this only in Illi-
nois. It has been estimated as many as 
3.9 million fewer vehicles will be pro-
duced this year because of the semicon-
ductor shortage. Last month, in the 
State of Kentucky—Kentucky—Ford 
announced the temporary shutdown of 
its Louisville plant, impacting more 
than 8,000 of its employees. And Ford’s 
Louisville Assembly Plant, which em-
ploys nearly 4,000 workers, is expected 
to close through mid-July. 
GM halted production lines in Ten-
nessee and Kansas and at several other 
facilities this spring. 
The news of these layoffs and plant 
closures underscores the urgent need 
for Congress, on a bipartisan basis, to 
address this microchip shortage. And 
the good news is that we have a real 
opportunity to pass legislation that 
will offer help to these workers and 
families. These investments in the 
CHIPS Act will not only address our 
immediate market needs but help to 
ensure that manufacturers don’t face 
shortages in the future. 
This funding will help support jobs 
through the entire supply chain—from 
construction of new facilities to manu-
facturing and development of chips, to 
workers in the auto industry who de-
pend on this supply. 
This bill makes a strategic invest-
ment that will help to counter the 
growing threat caused by the rapid de-
velopment of China’s economy. I hope 
my colleagues will join me in sup-
porting these important provisions to 
boost our domestic supply chain and 
support American jobs. Or we can de-
feat this measure. We can decide it is 
too much money, spending it at the 
wrong time. That is part of the second- 
place finish club, which you might find 
in the U.S. Senate. I don’t want to be 
a part of it. I believe in the brains and 
the brawn of American workers. I be-
lieve they are productive people and 
that our researchers can lead the 
world, as they have over and over 
again, if we trust them and we invest 
in them. 
I yield the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican whip is recog-
nized. 
H.R. 1 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, H.R. 1, 
the Democrats’ supposed election in-
tegrity bill, is filled with bad ideas: 
making the Federal Election Commis-
sion into a partisan body; effectively 
banning voter ID and gutting other 
safeguards against voter fraud; pro-
viding for taxpayer funding of political 
campaigns. 
Nowhere is that more true than when 
it comes to the bill’s truly terrible pro-
visions on the IRS. 
Everyone remembers the IRS scandal 
during 
the 
Obama 
administration. 
Around 2013, it emerged that the 
Obama IRS had been unfairly singling 
out conservative organizations apply-
ing for tax-exempt status, slow-walk-
ing their applications and subjecting 
them to burdensome extra scrutiny. 
This had been going on for more than 2 
years, and top IRS officials com-
pounded the Agency’s misdeeds by pro-
viding misleading information to Con-
gress. 
Well, Americans should brace them-
selves, because if H.R. 1 is ever en-
acted, it would allow for the same kind 
of targeting that went on under the 
Obama administration, if not worse. To 
start with, H.R. 1 repeals a Treasury 
Department rule finalized last year 
that was designed to help prevent the 
kind of abuse that went on under the 
Obama IRS. 
Under the rule, many tax-exempt or-
ganizations are no longer required to 
turn over to the IRS the names and ad-
dresses of individuals who have made 
substantial donations. This is not in-
formation the IRS needs to know for 
tax purposes, and there is no reason the 
Agency should have information be-
yond what it needs to do its job. 
I am proud to be a cosponsor of Lead-
er MCCONNELL
and Senator BRAUN’s 
bill which would permanently codify 
the Treasury rule and its protections 
against unnecessary disclosure. Pro-
viding the IRS with additional extra-
neous information opens up opportuni-
ties for the kind of abuses we saw dur-
ing the Obama administration. 
But stopping IRS abuse doesn’t seem 
to be a big priority for the Democrat 
Party. Indeed, there is reason to be-
lieve at least some Democrats would 
like the IRS to take a more aggressive 
role in Americans’ lives. And so H.R. 1 
explicitly repeals the Treasury Depart-
ment rule, but that is not all. 
As if Democrats were determined to 
prove that they intend to weaponize 
the IRS, H.R. 1 and S. 1, which is the 
Senate version of the House bill, would 
allow the IRS to consider organiza-
tions’ views when deciding whether or 
not to grant them tax-exempt status. 
Let me repeat that. H.R. 1 and S. 1 
would allow the IRS to consider an or-
ganization’s 
views 
when 
deciding 
whether or not to grant that organiza-
tion tax-exempt status. 
It is difficult to think of a more out-
rageous and dangerous provision. This 
rule would allow any administration of 
either party to use the IRS to censor 
and suppress groups whose ideas the 
party in power opposes. If the adminis-
tration in power doesn’t like the posi-
tions that your organization cham-
pions, say goodbye to your hopes for 
tax-exempt status. The Obama IRS 
scandals could look tame compared to 
the kind of political weaponization of 
the IRS that could occur under H.R. 1. 
This provision could have real polit-
ical implications. Selectively granting 
tax-exempt status could be a means of 
weakening 
political 
opposition. 
A 
group that can’t get tax-exempt status 
may be a group that never gets off the 
ground for financial reasons and, thus, 
a group that never becomes a signifi-
cant voice in opposition to policies of 
the reigning party. 
Do you think this is a worst case sce-
nario? Well, let’s remember that some-
thing like this already happened under 
the Obama administration. The IRS 
was weaponized once, and it can be 
weaponized again, especially if Demo-
crats succeed in their efforts to elimi-
nate safeguards against such abuse. 
And, of course, if the President has 
his way, the IRS may soon be swim-
ming in money that would substan-
tially increase its reach. President 
Biden wants to provide the IRS with— 
get this—an additional $80 billion over 
10 years. That would give the IRS a 
larger budget than the Department of 
Labor, the Department of Commerce, 
the Department of the Interior, the 
Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention, and other significant govern-
ment Agencies. It would allow the IRS 
to hire nearly 87,000 new employees— 
87,000. All told, the Biden plan would 
double the number of IRS employees 
over the next decade. 
Now, the reason President Biden 
gives for this massive increase in IRS 
funding is increased enforcement ef-
forts in order to close the tax gap— 
that gap that exists between taxes 
owed and what Americans end up actu-
ally paying. But there is little reason 
to believe that the IRS will come any-
where close to recovering the amount 
of money the President claims it can 
recover, even with a massive infusion 
of cash. And there is reason to be seri-
ously concerned about what that mas-
sive infusion of cash, plus new report-
ing requirements on Americans’ bank 
and Venmo accounts, could mean for 
IRS intrusion into Americans’ lives. 
President 
Biden, 
of 
course, 
also 
claims that any increased enforcement 
will be targeted against wealthy Amer-
icans. In what is becoming a typical 
Democrat class-warfare rhetoric, the 
President states that ordinary Ameri-
cans 
pay 
their 
taxes 
while 
some 
wealthy Americans dodge them. Of 
course, according to the IRS, our Na-
tion has a relatively high and stable 
voluntary tax compliance rate, and tax 
compliance levels remain largely un-
changed since at least the 1980s. And, 
in fact, failure to pay tax owed occurs 
among all kinds of taxpayers in every 
place along the income spectrum. But 
the White House isn’t letting those 
facts interfere with its class-warfare 
rhetoric. 
What is more, what guarantees will 
we have other than Democrats’ say-so 
at this point that this infusion of 
money will be restricted to combating

tax evasion? As far as I can tell, there 
is nothing to prevent the new agents 
the IRS will hire from being retasked 
at some point to other priorities, like 
investigating the views of conservative 
organizations before deciding whether 
or not to grant them tax-exempt sta-
tus. 
Closing the tax gap is a serious goal 
that deserves serious discussion, and it 
is possible that a targeted IRS funding 
increase for that purpose would be 
worth considering. But $80 billion is a 
ridiculous number. In the words of one 
of President Obama’s IRS chiefs: ‘‘I’m 
not sure you’d be able to efficiently use 
that much money.’’ 
And any plus-up in funding for the 
IRS should be accompanied by serious 
reforms, as well as many protections— 
not 
fewer 
protections—against 
IRS 
politicization. 
While the Obama IRS scandal rep-
resents one of the more egregious 
abuses of the Agency’s power, the IRS 
is well known for serial mismanage-
ment, like Americans’ inability to ac-
tually get through to the IRS with 
their questions. 
The Washington Post reported in 
April that if you were calling the IRS 
this tax season, you had a 1-in-50—1-in- 
50—chance of actually getting to speak 
to a human being. 
In May, the Treasury Inspector Gen-
eral for Tax Administration released a 
report on the 2021 filing season, which 
noted the IRS struggled to get new 
hires squared away on the job partially 
because it is—and here, I am going to 
have to quote from this report—‘‘dif-
ficult to find working copiers . . . to be 
able to prepare training packages for 
new hires.’’ That is right. And I wish 
those were the only Agency printer or 
copier problems, but they are not. 
Let me quote from the inspector gen-
eral’s report again. 
Audit teams continue to perform onsite 
walkthroughs at the Ogden, Utah, and Kan-
sas City, Missouri, Tax Processing Centers to 
meet with staff to discuss challenges they 
are facing as it relates to addressing the on-
going backlogs of inventory. A major con-
cern 
that 
surfaced 
during 
these 
walkthroughs was a lack of working printers 
and copiers. IRS management estimated 
that, as of March 30, 2021, 69 [or] (42 percent) 
of 164 devices used by the Submission Proc-
essing functions are unusable and others are 
broken but still functioning. IRS employees 
stated that the only reason they could not 
use many of these devices is because they are 
out of ink or because the waste cartridge 
container is full. 
That is from the inspector general’s 
report. I wish this were a joke, but that 
is straight out of the IG’s report. 
Hearing that, you might think that 
we don’t need to worry about the 
weaponization of the IRS because the 
Agency isn’t capable of work that so-
phisticated. But, as we know, that isn’t 
true. 
The 
IRS 
was 
successfully 
weaponized for political purposes dur-
ing the Obama administration, and the 
same thing could happen again, espe-
cially if Democrats succeed in remov-
ing protections against IRS abuse. 
As our Nation’s revenue-collecting 
Agency, the IRS is an Agency with im-
mense power, and it is not a voluntary 
government program. Americans don’t 
get to choose whether or not they 
interact with the IRS. For that reason, 
it is vital that there be as many safe-
guards in place as possible to prevent 
the IRS from abusing its power or 
being used for political purposes. 
We have seen plenty of evidence that 
the IRS often doesn’t use the money or 
resources that it currently has in a re-
sponsible way. And any increase in 
money for the IRS—which it certainly 
should not be anywhere close to $80 bil-
lion—should be matched with signifi-
cant reforms and increased account-
ability. 
And H.R. 1, with its multitude of un-
wise and unconstitutional provisions 
even beyond the alarming provisions I 
have discussed today, must be stopped. 
Otherwise, the Biden legacy may be the 
weaponization of the IRS. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
PADILLA). The Senator from New Jer-
sey. 
NOMINATION OF KRISTEN M. CLARKE 
Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, it is a 
real honor to be rising today to speak 
in advance of the vote on Kristen 
Clarke’s nomination to serve as the At-
torney General of the Department of 
Justice. 
If she is confirmed, Kristen Clarke 
will be tasked with overseeing the Jus-
tice Department’s work to protect the 
civil rights of all Americans. 
I have known Kristen Clarke for 
years. I have worked with her. I know 
her, and I can tell you that there can 
be no one better for this job. 
To say that Kristen Clarke has an 
impressive resume is a gross under-
statement. She started her career at 
the Justice Department in the Civil 
Rights Division. She worked with the 
NAACP Legal Defense Fund. She led 
the Civil Rights Bureau for the State 
of New York Attorney General’s Office 
and most recently served as president 
and executive director of the Lawyers’ 
Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. 
No one could blame Kristen Clarke, 
after this entire career of service and 
all that she has given, if she decided to 
take a step back and find a less de-
manding job, perhaps a far more lucra-
tive job. But Ms. Clarke has dedicated 
herself to the highest principles of our 
Nation—indeed, to the founding ideals 
of our country, formed with the Bill of 
Rights, focusing on this idea of civil 
rights for all. 
This is not just her job. This has been 
her calling. This is her consistent con-
viction—to serve, to sacrifice for our 
Nation’s most sacrosanct ideals. 
She has chosen to serve this country 
now at a time when we need her leader-
ship more than ever. She is an asset to 
our country, and I believe she will 
serve with extraordinary distinction as 
a guardian of our civil rights. 
We need her experience. We need her 
expertise. We need her heart, her com-
mitment, her deep thoughtfulness. 
She is the daughter of immigrants, 
and after growing up in public housing, 
in a low-income household, Ms. Clarke 
made it to some of our most pres-
tigious institutions and made it her 
cause to make the best out of herself. 
She is an incredible success story. She 
is a person who has overcome tremen-
dous odds and advanced herself, not 
just for personal excellence but for 
public service. This makes her, in my 
book, a champion. 
Yet there are still those in this con-
firmation process who want to say that 
Ms. Clarke is the wrong person for the 
job. They are actually using smear tac-
tics and lies to try to misrepresent who 
Ms. Clarke is as a person. There is a 
saying, ‘‘Let the work I have done 
speak for me,’’ and I wish folk would 
listen. 
She has prosecuted hate crimes. She 
has defended people’s voting rights. 
She has fought against religious dis-
crimination. She has dedicated her ca-
reer to the cause of equal justice under 
law. 
Ms. Clarke is the right person for 
this job. She is exactly who we need. 
At a time when we are confronting ris-
ing hate crimes in America, dramati-
cally more instances of vandalism and 
violence 
against 
Asian 
Americans, 
against 
Jewish 
Americans, 
against 
transgender Americans, we need some-
one leading the Civil Rights Division 
who will stand up for all Americans, 
who has experience prosecuting hate 
crimes and makes it clear in this Na-
tion that all are created equal and en-
dowed by their Creator with funda-
mental civil rights. That is who she is 
now and who she has been for her en-
tire career. 
There are folks and forces working to 
strip away and weaken and undermine 
these fundamental rights. We see ef-
forts to weaken our democracy, to 
threaten our principles. We need some-
one who will stand up and affirm who 
we are as a people—a nation that be-
lieves in robust voting rights, a nation 
that believes in the equal dignity of all 
people, a nation that believes in pro-
tecting religious liberty. We need a 
champion now as much as ever. We 
need Kristen Clarke leading the Civil 
Rights Division at the Department of 
Justice. 
And it is not just me saying that. It 
is just not Democrats saying that. 
There are over 70 bipartisan former 
State attorneys general. We see police 
leaders, law enforcement leaders en-
dorsing her, prosecutors endorsing her, 
the Anti-Defamation League and 69 dif-
ferent local, State, and national Jewish 
organizations, 
all 
agreeing 
that 
Kristen Clarke is the right person to 
stand for us, to work for us, to fight for 
us, to champion for our precious civil 
rights at the Department of Justice. 
So many different individuals from 
all across the political landscape, from 
all different backgrounds, and so many 
organizations representing all of our 
diversity are speaking out in a chorus 
of conviction about not just how good

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3391 
May 25, 2021 
Kristen Clarke is but how urgent her 
nomination is because of who she has 
shown herself to be time and again: an 
unassailable, impressive career of serv-
ice, service, service. She is and has 
been a servant leader for all of her ca-
reer; a person of profound integrity; 
someone whose passion, whose sac-
rifice, whose struggle in the pursuit of 
justice has already made this Nation 
better. 
I will say something on a personal 
note in closing. I have worked with 
Kristen Clarke for years now on things 
that we have done together, like a bi-
partisan criminal justice reform bill. 
I had the occasion years ago of meet-
ing her when she was out in Wash-
ington with her son. He was a young 
guy, not that tall. Then, during her 
hearings in the Judiciary Committee, I 
saw her again present herself in an ex-
traordinarily powerful manner, with 
grace and expertise, but I saw that 
young man now had grown up. He is a 
big guy. And it would be a leap of ego 
for me to say that I saw myself in this 
young man because he is probably a lot 
smarter than I was when I was his age 
and clearly is a better athlete, even 
though I will say for the record that 
the older I get, the better I am in 
sports. 
But I think about her career, and 
then I align it to what she has done in 
raising a young Black man in America. 
While I couldn’t project myself onto 
him, I thought a lot about my mom in 
her. My mom raised my brother and me 
in a nation that strove to be who we 
say we are, a nation of liberty and jus-
tice for all. But where she knew we 
were falling short, she didn’t raise us 
to be bitter; she raised us to be better. 
She raised us by setting an example, a 
woman who—from sitting in at a lunch 
counter to desegregate a restaurant, to 
helping organize the March on Wash-
ington, she showed me by example. As 
James Baldwin has said, children are 
never good at listening to their elders, 
but they never fail to imitate them. 
I want you all to know that in 
Kristen Clarke, we have an extraor-
dinary American, an extraordinary per-
son, and a great mom. And I know 
what she has done with her life. She 
has lived perhaps with the greatest 
principle of all, which is for us in this 
generation to make a better way for 
the next, for us to make a more perfect 
Union, for us to understand that the 
arc of the moral universe is indeed long 
but we must bend it more towards jus-
tice. 
I tell my colleagues and urge you to 
confirm her to this sacrosanct and ur-
gent position today because I am con-
fident to the core of my being that she 
will not just make us proud, she will 
not just defend those who are having 
their rights trampled or their dignity 
marginalized, but that she will make a 
better way for an America that fulfills 
its promise, still not yet achieved, for 
us to be a nation with liberty and jus-
tice for all. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, 
here we go again. Just a few weeks ago, 
the Senate debated Vanita Gupta’s 
nomination 
for 
Associate 
Attorney 
General, so let’s review the bidding 
from that. 
Gupta was eminently qualified for 
her role. She had support from the 
foremost law enforcement leaders and 
groups in the country. She had proven 
herself handling high-level government 
responsibilities. But Republicans set 
their hair on fire trying to take Ms. 
Gupta down. They grasped for some-
thing, anything, to dent her prospects. 
Eventually they landed on contorting 
an 8-year-old op-ed, even calling her 
accurate responses to their questions 
about it lies. It wasn’t pretty. 
Now we are back on the floor with 
Republican hair aflame again, this 
time over the nominee to run the Jus-
tice Department’s Civil Rights Divi-
sion, Kristen Clarke. Like Ms. Gupta, 
Ms. Clarke is eminently qualified. She 
knows civil rights law inside and out. 
She has run one of the Nation’s leading 
civil rights organizations. She is a su-
perb, well-trained, experienced lawyer. 
Conservatives have endorsed her, like 
President George W. Bush’s DHS Sec-
retary Michael Chertoff and former Re-
publican National Committee Chair-
man Michael Steele. Law enforcement 
organizations like the Major Cities 
Chiefs 
Association 
and 
the 
Inter-
national Association of Chiefs of Police 
support her. 
She ought to have flown through 
committee and been a quick vote here 
on the floor, but, no, it is hair-on-fire 
time again. Why all the coifs aflame? 
Look behind the smokescreens and re-
member that the No. 1 strategy of the 
Republican Party for 2022 is to keep 
voters from voting. And guess what. 
Ms. Clarke will run the voting rights 
section of the Department, and Ms. 
Gupta, who used to run that same Civil 
Rights Division, will supervise her as 
Assistant Attorney General. 
Behind the ruckus over Ms. Gupta 
and now Ms. Clarke is a dark money 
operation out to suppress the vote. It 
has the trade craft of a covert oper-
ation—cutouts, front groups, secret 
money—and that covert operation is 
now focused on preventing, as our col-
league Senator WARNOCK says, ‘‘some 
people’’ from voting. And Ms. Clarke 
and Ms. Gupta will be the lawful, legal 
opposition to the dark money, voter- 
suppression apparatus. 
Here is what we know. When Trump 
was in power, this covert op ran a dark 
money-funded apparatus within the 
Federalist Society to select Federal 
judges. For 4 years, the Federalist So-
ciety’s operation was the gatekeeper to 
the Federal bench. Virtually every ju-
dicial candidate who passed through 
this dark money-funded turnstile was 
approved by big, anonymous donors out 
to control the courts. Donors got to ap-
prove judges and Justices who would 
have their backs. 
That dark money turnstile was step 
1. Step 2 was dark money-funded polit-
ical campaigns for Senate confirmation 
of the nominees who got through the 
turnstile. For Trump’s three Supreme 
Court nominees, this was done by the 
Judicial Crisis Network, headquartered 
literally down the hall from the Fed-
eralist Society—not just the same 
building, the same hallway, but they 
also share staff. In each Supreme Court 
confirmation, a $15 million or a $17 mil-
lion check from a secret donor would 
fund the advertising campaign. 
Step 3 is dark money-funded front or-
ganizations appearing before the donor- 
selected Justices in orchestrated flo-
tillas with common donors behind 
them, undisclosed to the Court. 
When Trump lost, of course, step 1 
and step 2 lost their salience and closed 
up shop. But with Trump judges still 
on the court, these front groups are 
still at it. In one case before the Su-
preme Court right now, 50 organiza-
tions—50 
organizations—that 
filed 
briefs received funding through right-
wing groups involved in this operation. 
Dark money funding can’t be traced 
back to its original donors, obviously, 
because it is dark money, but a 2019 
Washington 
Post 
investigation 
re-
vealed that one guy, Leonard Leo, 
while executive vice president of the 
Federalist Society, from 2014 to 2017 co-
ordinated $250 million—a quarter of a 
billion dollars—across a network of the 
front groups engaged in this court cap-
ture operation. Recent testimony in 
my Courts Subcommittee raised that 
number to over $400 million—nearly 
half a billion dollars—through 2018. 
Four hundred million is a lot of money, 
but a captured court, that is a pearl be-
yond price. 
This Leo operation worked wonder-
fully during the Trump Presidency. Do-
nors got their judges. Judicial Crisis 
Network and Leonard Leo got their 
dark money. But then that Post inves-
tigation came out, and Trump’s polling 
started to tank. So, like a burned 
agent, Leonard Leo bugged out. 
Where did he bug out to? Well, Leo 
surfaced early last year with a group 
called the Honest Elections Project. 
These phony-baloney front groups love 
to have the name that is the exact op-
posite of what they are actually doing. 
So this one is called the Honest Elec-
tions Project, and it has been running 
voter suppression activities in key bat-
tleground States, sending threatening 
letters to local election officials, and 
filing lawsuits to restrict voting—and, 
of course, all dark money-funded. 
But poke a little further and you dis-
cover 
that 
the 
Honest 
Elections 
Project is a legal alias of something 
called the Judicial Education Project, 
which is—you guessed it—the sister 
group to Judicial Crisis Network—yep, 
Leo’s judicial confirmation attack-ad 
organization. And, of course, behind 
this covert op was dark money, much 
of it run through DonorsTrust, the 
identity-laundering, dark money ATM 
established by the Kochs’ donor net-
work. Before it took on this Honest

Elections Project alias, more than 99 
percent 
of 
the 
Judicial 
Education 
Project’s 2018 revenue was a single, 
anonymous $7.8 million donation that 
came through, of course, DonorsTrust. 
There is no way to know who cut that 
check. 
What does all this dark money fina-
gling and front group subterfuge tell 
us? As a reporter for the Guardian ob-
served, the Honest Elections Project, 
so-called, melds two goals of the right-
wing dark money operation: One, pack 
the Federal judiciary, and two, bring 
voting rights cases before the packed 
courts. Rigging elections by keeping 
‘‘some people’’ from voting is now a 
Republican priority, and if Trump 
judges will help, so much the better. 
Just recently, we actually learned 
more about the covert voter suppres-
sion operation. The watchdog group 
Documented and the magazine Mother 
Jones uncovered a video of a presen-
tation by the dark money group Herit-
age Action to its top donors. In the 
video, the presenter brags about get-
ting what she called ‘‘key provi-
sions’’—‘‘key provisions’’—into voter 
suppression legislation in dozens of 
capitals around the country. 
She tells the donors, and I am 
quoting here, ‘‘In some cases, we actu-
ally draft them for them’’—they actu-
ally draft the laws for the State legis-
latures—‘‘or,’’ she said, ‘‘we have a sen-
tinel’’—a 
sentinel; 
what 
a 
creepy 
word—‘‘we have a sentinel on our be-
half give them the model legislation so 
it has that grassroots, from-the-bot-
tom-up type of vibe.’’ Big donors love 
that 
grassroots, 
from-the-bottom-up 
type of vibe. 
There is lots of dark money that 
fuels this covert op. Heritage Action 
says it plans to spend $24 million in 
eight battleground States to ‘‘create 
an echo chamber’’ of relentless lob-
bying for voter suppression bills. They 
say they will be coordinating with 
known Koch network groups like the 
Susan B. Anthony List, Tea Party Pa-
triots, and FreedomWorks. 
This operation is the kind of stuff 
that we might want our intelligence 
services to do in enemy countries to 
create disruption and discord and pro-
vide secret influence. The idea that 
creepy billionaires are running covert 
operations in and against our own 
country, that ought to make you 
cringe. 
Not only is this behavior morally 
corrupt, it may have broken rules. One 
State legislature has already floated an 
ethics probe into Heritage Action’s 
sentinels jamming phony bills through 
their chamber. 
So back to Senate Republicans get-
ting their hair on fire over Kristen 
Clarke and Vanita Gupta. These two 
women scare the daylights out of this 
dark money operation behind Repub-
lican voter suppression. Ms. Clarke 
knows the Voting Rights Act cold; she 
won voting rights cases against voter 
suppression laws all over the country. 
Put Jim Crow 2.0 up against a Depart-
ment of Justice Civil Rights Division 
led by Kristen Clarke, and that dark 
money voter suppression operation has 
a problem. So the big dark money do-
nors behind this covert operation will 
raise whatever ruckus they can—first, 
to try to stop Vanita Gupta, which 
didn’t work, and now to stop Kristen 
Clarke, which won’t work—all in an ef-
fort to protect their dark money 
scheme to prevent some people from 
voting. You have to look behind the 
smokescreen sometimes to understand 
what is going on. It is not pretty, but 
it is the truth. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kentucky. 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I ask unan-
imous consent to be able to conclude 
my remarks before the vote begins. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
GOVERNMENT SPENDING 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, about 50 
years ago, William Proxmire rose in 
this esteemed body and told us about 
government waste. He called it the 
Golden Fleece Award. They were study-
ing things like dating and love and 
what makes love, and we had these 
great scientific studies about love. 
These are William Proxmire’s words 
from the early 1970s. He was a conserv-
ative Democrat. 
He says: 
I object to this [study on love] because no 
one—not even the National Science Founda-
tion—can argue that falling in love is a 
science; not only because I’m sure that even 
if they spend $84 million or $84 billion they 
wouldn’t get an answer that anyone would 
believe. I’m also against [this study on love] 
because I don’t want the answer. 
I believe that 200 million other Americans 
want to leave some things in life a mystery, 
and right at the top of things we don’t [need] 
to know is why a man falls in love with a 
woman and vice versa. 
Stirring words. The Golden Fleece 
Award—I remember as a kid everybody 
talked about it. It was in the news-
papers. So what have we done to curb 
the wasteful appetite, the abuse of gov-
ernment that has happened at the Na-
tional Science Foundation since 1972? 
Not a damn thing. 
Here is one of my other favorites 
from William Proxmire’s days. The 
FAA was named for spending $57,000 on 
a study of the physical measurements 
of 432 airline stewardesses. These in-
cluded the distance from knee to knee 
while sitting and the length of the but-
tocks. Fifty-eight thousand dollars— 
this was your government money being 
put to good use. 
So fast forward, and we spend about 
$8 billion a year with the National 
Science Foundation. Is it getting any 
better? Are they doing a better job at 
overseeing their money? Well, I don’t 
know. This bill is going to increase 
their funding by 68 percent. There is 
$29 billion in this bill for the National 
Science Foundation. So don’t you 
think the American people deserve to 
know where their money is being 
spent? 
This was from their sister Agency, 
the NIH, but you know we can’t get 
started without talking about it. This 
is over $800,000 to study whether or not 
Japanese quail are more sexually pro-
miscuous on cocaine. I am not making 
this up—$800,000 of taxpayer money to 
study whether Japanese quail are more 
sexually promiscuous on cocaine. 
Do you think we could have just 
polled the audience? Do you think we 
could have just said: What do you 
think? Because that is sort of the an-
swer. The answer is yes. And yet your 
government spent 800 grand on that. 
And then when we pointed it out 5 
years ago, did they do anything to re-
form it? No. They are here today to 
give the Agencies that are doing this 
research more money. 
Another one that I think is quite re-
vealing is this study that is about Pan-
amanian male frog calls. You have 
about half a million dollars, and they 
wanted to know whether or not the 
male mating call is different in the 
country than it is in the city. 
Now, coming from a rural State like 
Kentucky, I can tell you the male mat-
ing call is different in the country than 
it is in the city. But nobody in Ken-
tucky wants a half a million dollars 
spent on a Panamanian frog’s male 
mating call. This is not a good use of 
money. 
So if someone told you your govern-
ment was spending this money, would 
you give them more? Would you give 
the Agency more if they were doing 
this or less? I think less. 
In looking at the National Science 
Foundation’s spending, we also found 
that they spent $30,000 studying Ugan-
dan gambling habits. Really? We are 
studying why people gamble in Uganda, 
why there is a black market in Uganda. 
Well, do you know what? I think we 
know the reason. When government op-
presses business and regulates business 
to death, they go to the black market. 
If you make something illegal, you 
often get more of it. But we spent 
$30,000 traveling over to Uganda to 
study 
their 
gambling 
habits—utter 
waste of money. We should not reward 
these people with more money. 
We spent about half a million on a 
video game. This is an app for your 
phone. I know we all need things to do 
when we should be working or at 
school. This is an app for school-
children to teach them alarmism over 
climate change. So you can click on 
the app, and it will scare you to death 
that California is going to be under-
water in 100 years—none of which is 
true, all of which is alarmism, and a 
half a million dollars spent by the gov-
ernment to alarm our schoolchildren is 
not a good idea. 
This next study points out a problem 
with funding, in general, in our govern-
ment. You give funds for something 
that ostensibly might be a good cause. 
So a couple of years ago, they gave 
money for autism—$700,000 for autism. 
And you think, well, autism, you know, 
even myself, as conservative as I am, I

can probably say, well, that is some-
thing we ought to study, autism. Well, 
they subcontracted 700 grand of it to a 
bunch of egghead researchers to watch 
Neil Armstrong’s statement on the 
Moon. Do you remember the black-and- 
white photo? He is on the Moon, and he 
says, ‘‘[O]ne small step for man, one 
giant leap for mankind,’’ or did he real-
ly say: One small step for a man? 
So these researchers took $700,000 to 
listen to that crackly old cassette re-
cording and find out, did he say ‘‘man’’ 
or did he say ‘‘a man’’? So we studied 
the preposition ‘‘a,’’ and we spent 700 
grand listening to the tape over and 
over and over again. And do you know 
what they determined? They just can’t 
decide. They are unsure, but they did 
recommend more money to study the 
problem further. 
This is insulting to the American 
taxpayer. We should not be giving 
these people more money; we should be 
giving them dramatically less money. 
But it also points out one of the re-
forms that I have proposed for this 
Agency. One of the problems with the 
National Science Foundation is, if I 
want to do research on Japanese quail 
snorting cocaine, guess what, I can ask 
for the same people who are studying 
snorting cocaine in animals—I can ask 
them to be on my peer committee. I 
can choose the people on my peer com-
mittee. So if I want to study animals 
snorting cocaine, I pick other research-
ers who are studying animals snorting 
cocaine. Guess what. They tend to say 
yes. If they say yes, the scientist gets 
on the next peer Commission, and he 
says or she says yes for their snorting 
cocaine research. 
This is crazy. We should not let these 
so-called scientists pick who is on their 
committee. Not only that, I think we 
ought to have a taxpayer advocate. 
Could we not have just someone with a 
good dose of common sense who says 
we shouldn’t take autism money, steal 
it, and spend it on a bunch of idiots lis-
tening to what Neil Armstrong said 
when he landed on the Moon? So that 
is part of the reform we should have. 
One of my other alltime favorites 
from the National Science Founda-
tion—this kind of goes back to William 
Proxmire and love and happiness—they 
wanted to know if you take a selfie of 
yourself while smiling and you look at 
it later in the day, will that make you 
happy? 
Really? That is a half a million dol-
lars. I don’t think we need a scientist 
to say that that is BS and that govern-
ment has got no business doing this 
kind of research. I don’t even know 
how you could even call this research 
with a straight face. But it goes on 
year on, year on. We have been com-
plaining about this since 1972, so you 
would think maybe we would have less 
of it. We are giving them more money. 
So we are now increasing their budget 
by 68 percent despite this kind of re-
search. 
The last one I have is this. We spent 
$1.3 million on insect ranching. This is 
money that was sent to study whether 
or not we could put insects into animal 
feed. We spent another $3 million, 
though, wanting to know if humans 
would eat ants to prevent climate 
change. 
What will you do, America, to com-
bat climate change? Will you eat ants 
to combat climate change? That was a 
study. This is not science. This is ridic-
ulous in nature. 
Actually, I lied. I have got one more 
example. We spent $1.5 million study-
ing lizards on a treadmill. So I know 
you have all been curious, when lizards 
walk and they kind of waddle and they 
have a funny walk, why do they walk 
that way? What is going on in their 
knee joints? What do their hip joints 
look like when they waddle across the 
lawn? Everybody wants to know that, 
but are you willing to spend $1.5 mil-
lion of your taxpayer dollars to take x 
rays—live, real-time x rays—of a lizard 
walking on a treadmill? I tend to 
think, you know, maybe Alzheimer’s 
research, 
maybe 
cancer 
research, 
maybe heart research. But spending 
good, hard cash on x rays of a lizard on 
a treadmill does not strike me as the 
most pressing concerns of government. 
I would argue that instead of increas-
ing their money, we should be decreas-
ing their money. We also need to have 
oversight on where our money is being 
spent. There is a great deal of cir-
cumstantial evidence now that NIH 
money went to the Wuhan Institute of 
Virology. There is a great deal of evi-
dence at least suggesting that the pan-
demic may have started there. We 
don’t know for certain. I am not saying 
that it did, but there is evidence now 
that suggests that it might have. No. 1, 
there is no animal host for COVID–19. 
We have not found—of the thousands of 
animals we tested in the wet market, 
none of them had COVID–19. When you 
take COVID–19 and you try to infect 
bats, 
which 
is 
where 
most 
coronaviruses come from, what do you 
discover? You discover that COVID–19 
is actually not very well infected in 
bats. The bats don’t catch it very eas-
ily. It seems as if COVID–19 is most 
adaptive for humans. But if it came 
from animals, shouldn’t there be an 
animal host that is readily infected by 
this? 
The other evidence we have in the 
last couple of days is confirmation that 
three individuals at the Wuhan Insti-
tute got sick in November of last year, 
sick enough to be in the hospital from 
a virus that was previously undis-
closed. They worked in the Wuhan In-
stitute. We are told this came from the 
wet market lab from exotic animals, 
but not one animal tested positive for 
the virus. 
We have an amendment we are hop-
ing will be adopted by this body that 
says gain-of-function research, as de-
fined by the NIH in 2014, will not be 
permitted in China. We will not fund it 
with American dollars. 
But it is like so much waste in gov-
ernment, I think there is no reason to 
be sending any money to China for re-
search. They are a rich country. For 
goodness’ sake, we are worried about 
them outcompeting us, stealing our in-
tellectual property, and then we send 
them millions of dollars to do research. 
Why 
don’t 
they 
spend 
their 
own 
money? Do we trust them enough? Are 
they open enough to tell us what is 
going on in the lab that we want to 
give them money? 
I think, without question, they have 
not shown this, and now we are finding 
out that people were sick in the lab in 
November. 
No more money should go to China 
for research on gain of function, which 
means increasing the virulence or 
pathogenicity or the transmissibility 
of COVID virus to humans. I urge this 
body to adopt my amendment, which 
says, from here on out, China doesn’t 
get any money to create superviruses 
in a lab, and we should continue to in-
vestigate this because 3 million people 
have died worldwide. We have disrupted 
the entire world’s economy over a 
virus. If it came from a lab, we need to 
know it, and it needs to be fully inves-
tigated.

NOMINATION OF KRISTEN M. CLARKE 
Mr. 
COTTON. 
Madam 
President, 
today the Senate will vote on Kristen 
Clarke’s nomination to head the De-
partment of Justice’s Civil Rights Divi-
sion—one of the most powerful posi-
tions at the Department of Justice. I 
will, of course, oppose her nomination. 
We get a lot of partisan nominees 
around here. So that is not very sur-
prising. But Ms. Clarke isn’t just par-
tisan. She is extremely partisan. She 
called Senator MURKOWSKI ‘‘shameful.’’ 
She accused Senator MANCHIN of being 
disingenuous. And she casually slan-
dered 
200—200—sitting, 
Senate-con-
firmed judges as ‘‘white male extrem-
ists.’’ If confirmed for this position, she 
will be entrusted with representing the 
U.S. Government in front of those very 
judges—not exactly a credible advocate 
for our people, if you ask me. 
Ms. Clarke’s radicalism doesn’t stop 
with ad hominem insults. It thor-
oughly infects her professional judg-
ment as well. Ms. Clarke has consist-
ently demonstrated that she is more 
interested in attacking police and call-
ing everybody a racist than finding the 
facts or reviewing the evidence. 
When it comes to racially incendiary 
cases, she proudly fans the flames of di-
vision. Last year, she repeatedly—re-
peatedly—spread the falsehood that 
Jacob Blake, who had a knife and was 
actively resisting arrest, was, in fact, 
‘‘unarmed’’ when he was shot by the 
police. In part because of falsehoods 
like that one, riots engulfed the city of 
Kenosha, WI. 
She also claimed that Officer Darren 
Wilson, who shot and killed Michael 
Brown in Ferguson, MO, was only exon-
erated ‘‘based on racism.’’ When I 
asked Ms. Clarke if she had reconsid-
ered that unsubstantiated opinion, she 
pretended not to know enough to an-
swer the question, at first, which is re-
markable given that the shooting in 
Ferguson is one of the most publicized 
and explosive cases in recent years; 
also remarkable because she appar-
ently knew enough to tar a grand jury 
of normal American citizens as yes, 
once again, racist, but not enough to 
answer simple questions. 
Ms. Clarke’s opinion on the Ferguson 
case sets her apart from other staunch 
liberals like Vanita Gupta and Eric 
Holder. Both have acknowledged that 
Officer Wilson was justified in the use 
of force, echoing the Obama Depart-
ment of Justice, which came to the 
very same conclusion. In defiance of all 
evidence, in spite of her good friend Ms. 
Gupta’s views, Ms. Clarke still dissents 
from this conclusion. So I cannot be-
lieve it—I am genuinely astonished— 
but Joe Biden has somehow found a 
nominee more radical than Vanita 
Gupta. That is an impressive accom-
plishment, one that should give Sen-
ators who supported Ms. Gupta more 
than ample ground to oppose Ms. 
Clarke. 
Moreover, Ms. Clarke is a firm and, 
until very recently, a vocal supporter 
of defunding the police. Ms. Clarke 
wrote an article less than a year ago— 
not some college paper. Less than a 
year ago, Ms. Clarke wrote an article 
with ‘‘Defund the Police’’ in the title. 
She stated: ‘‘Must invest less in police’’ 
three times in the text of that article. 
She 
also 
wrote: 
‘‘I 
advocate 
for 
defunding policing operations.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3395 
May 25, 2021 
I don’t know. Call me naive. Call me 
simple. When you write an article enti-
tled ‘‘Defund the Police’’ and when you 
say, ‘‘[W]e must invest less in the po-
lice’’ and ‘‘I advocate for defunding po-
licing options,’’ it sounds to me like 
you support defunding the police. But, 
apparently, I am wrong about that be-
cause when she was asked about this at 
her hearing, Ms. Clarke denied—amaz-
ingly, 
denied—that 
she 
supported 
defunding the police. She claimed that 
when she wrote that ‘‘we should defund 
the police,’’ she actually meant that 
we should not defund the police. As-
toundingly, she blamed an editor for 
coming up with the title to her piece 
but conveniently can’t recall what an 
alternative title she suggested would 
have been or whether she objected to a 
title that was apparently the exact op-
posite of what she intended. 
Now, maybe this shouldn’t be sur-
prising. After all, her article title was 
‘‘I prosecuted police killings. Defund 
the Police—but be Strategic.’’ Appar-
ently, the strategy is lying, because 
that is what we saw at our committee. 
We said: Ms. Clarke, the title of your 
article is ‘‘Defund the Police.’’ 
Like, I didn’t choose the title. 
Ms. Clarke, you wrote three times in 
the story ‘‘defund the police.’’ 
She is like: I don’t support defunding 
the police. 
But, Ms. Clarke, you wrote here, as 
well, that we should invest less in the 
police. 
She is like: No, I don’t think we 
should invest less; we should invest 
more. 
The old argument: It is not my dog. 
It didn’t bite you. You kicked him 
first. 
Regardless of what she and her de-
fenders might say, one thing is crystal 
clear: A vote for Kristen Clarke is a 
vote to defund the police. 
Finally, not surprisingly, we come to 
Ms. Clarke’s consistent dishonesty, du-
plicity, and evasion throughout her 
hearing and written statements. In one 
particularly 
bizarre 
incident, 
Ms. 
Clarke claimed in her hearing that she 
was proud to have the endorsement of 
the National Association of Police Or-
ganizations, a group which represents 
nearly a quarter million law enforce-
ment officers. 
Now that would be big news, a huge 
endorsement. So I asked my staff to 
get me a copy of the endorsement let-
ter. It turns out they couldn’t because 
it doesn’t exist. 
Now, that is not good, but people 
misspeak all the time, especially when 
under pressure. So I wanted to give Ms. 
Clarke a chance to correct the record. 
I asked for clarity in a written ques-
tion. Thankfully, Ms. Clarke responded 
that she had misstated the facts. 
OK. That is fine, I accept that expla-
nation. Again, people misspeak. No one 
is perfect. Yet imagine my surprise 
when I received an answer to another 
written question that claimed almost 
verbatim the same thing she had said 
in her hearing—that she was endorsed 
by this organization. 
She similarly responded to at least 
three other Senators that she was en-
dorsed by this organization, even after 
admitting just a few pages earlier in 
her written answers that she had mis-
stated that she had such an endorse-
ment. At that point, that is not a sim-
ple mistake. It is not misspeaking. It is 
not a fib. It is totally and completely 
untrue in written testimony to the 
U.S. Congress. Yet she has not apolo-
gized. She has not acknowledged this 
blatant lie. 
This episode sadly proves that she 
lacks the transparency and honesty to 
be trusted in such an important posi-
tion. 
You know, my Democratic colleagues 
have, for the last 4 years, endlessly lec-
tured about the need for the Depart-
ment of Justice to be free from par-
tisan politics and for it to be run by se-
rious, 
competent 
individuals. 
They 
seems to have a slightly different view 
today. From her extremism to her lack 
of candor, Ms. Clarke is unfit to lead 
any organization in the Department of 
Justice—indeed, simply to serve the 
Department of Justice. If the Demo-
cratic Senators vote to confirm Ms. 
Clarke, they will be responsible for 
every battle she wages in Joe Biden’s 
war on the police, and I will make sure 
that their voters know about it. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The as-
sistant majority leader is recognized. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak for 15 min-
utes before the rollcall vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, it 
was 1 year ago today. It was a street 
corner in the city of Minneapolis, the 
corner of 38th and Chicago Avenue. For 
9 
minutes 
and 
29 
seconds, 
Derek 
Chauvin, 
a 
Minneapolis 
policeman, 
knelt on George Floyd’s neck. As he 
knelt on his neck, he stared into a 
camera with a look that haunts me to 
this day. Those 9 minutes and 29 sec-
onds took George Floyd’s life and 
changed America’s national conversa-
tion about law enforcement. Those 9 
minutes and 29 seconds sparked a glob-
al movement and compelled us to bear 
witness to the reality of racial injus-
tice in our country. 
In this Senate we are in a privileged 
position to face that reality and to 
continue America’s long, sometimes 
bitter march toward equal justice 
under the law. That is why I rise today 
in support of Kristen Clarke’s nomina-
tion to be Assistant Attorney General 
for the Civil Rights Division of the De-
partment of Justice. 
It is worth noting the history of this 
position. The Civil Rights Division is 
one of the most important components 
of the Justice Department. The Attor-
ney General’s Office has existed since 
1789. The Justice Department itself was 
not created until after our Civil War. 
During the days of Reconstruction, 
after that war, our Nation resolved to 
take new steps to form a more perfect 
Union through the 13th Amendment’s 
abolishing slavery, the 14th Amend-
ment’s guarantee of due process and 
equal protection, and the 15th Amend-
ment’s protection of all citizens’ funda-
mental right to vote. 
The Department of Justice was cre-
ated after the passage of those amend-
ments and entrusted with the responsi-
bility to defend the rights of Ameri-
cans, particularly the newly emanci-
pated, formerly enslaved Americans. 
Given the Department’s immediate 
imperative to protect and preserve 
civil rights, President Ulysses S. Grant 
appointed Amos Akerman to be the 
first Attorney General to lead this new 
Department. Why? He had extensive 
experience in prosecuting voter intimi-
dation as the U.S. attorney in the 
State of Georgia. 
More than 150 years later, the Civil 
Rights Division of the Justice Depart-
ment now is entrusted with that con-
stitutional responsibility. The Division 
enforces Federal statutes prohibiting 
discrimination based on race, color, 
sex, sexual orientation, gender iden-
tity, disability, religion, national ori-
gin, and citizenship status. 
And just as President Grant ap-
pointed a legal expert with a breadth of 
experience to lead the newly formed 
Justice Department in 1870, today, 
President Joe Biden has chosen Kristen 
Clarke to take up the mantle as the 
head of the Civil Rights Division. With 
her breadth of experience defending the 
civil rights of all Americans, Kristen 
Clarke is singularly qualified to lead 
this Division, particularly at this mo-
ment in history. 
Kristen Clarke will be the first Sen-
ate confirmed woman of color to do 
so—the first. 
When I listen to the caricatures that 
are portrayed on the floor of the Sen-
ate about this woman, I find it hard to 
believe they are talking about the 
Kristen Clarke that we met in open 
Senate hearings. 
We know what happened to the Civil 
Rights 
Division 
under 
President 
Trump. Under President Trump and 
Attorneys General Sessions and Barr, 
the Civil Rights Division was dev-
astated. Over the past 4 years, the Di-
vision rescinded guidance protecting 
transgender students, prohibited the 
use of consent decrees for local police 
departments that had engaged in sys-
temic misconduct, and abandoned the 
prior legal positions supporting Ameri-
cans’ fundamental right to vote. 
I believe America needs a Civil 
Rights Division that vigorously de-
fends the civil rights of all Americans. 
Kristen Clarke is the legal expert we 
need to restore and reinvigorate the 
Civil Rights Division. 
You wouldn’t know it from the char-
acterizations on the other side about 
her experience, but, notably, she is a 
veteran of two of its sections. She 
began her legal career defending voting 
rights in the Voting Section and later 
prosecuted hate crimes in the Divi-
sion’s Criminal Section. She personally

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3396 
May 25, 2021 
understands the key role the Division’s 
line attorneys play in protecting civil 
rights. 
Since leaving the Civil Rights Divi-
sion, Ms. Clarke has continued defend-
ing civil rights in State government 
and national civil rights organizations. 
First, Ms. Clarke co-led the NAACP 
Legal Defense and Educational Fund’s 
voting rights work, litigating voting 
rights cases under the Voting Rights 
Act and the National Voter Registra-
tion Act. Then she served as a civil 
rights official for the New York State 
Attorney General’s Office, where she 
played a key role in launching a reli-
gious rights initiative to address faith- 
based discrimination. 
When you listen to those assign-
ments and the fact that this woman 
was chosen to head these divisions, 
how can it possibly square with some 
of the caricatures that have been 
drawn on the floor today about who she 
is? 
Most recently, Ms. Clarke was chosen 
to lead the Lawyers’ Committee for 
Civil Rights Under Law. Those of us 
who follow this closely know it is one 
of the most preeminent civil rights 
groups in America. During her tenure, 
the Lawyers’ Committee has taken on 
a huge caseload and doubled in size to 
address the most pressing civil rights 
issues of our time, including hate 
crimes. 
Here is the part that I want to make 
a special emphasis on. Both Vanita 
Gupta and Kristen Clarke have exten-
sive endorsements from law enforce-
ment organizations. Yet, when they 
were characterized on the floor of the 
Senate by their critics, they were char-
acterized as haters of police and law 
enforcement. It just mystifies me how 
Senators can come to the floor know-
ing these organizations and believe 
that these two women have hood-
winked them into believing that they 
support law enforcement. The women 
and men in law enforcement aren’t 
pushed around and aren’t easily de-
ceived. They have endorsed these two 
women, and today we address Kristen 
Clarke’s nomination because of the 
records they have written, not over a 
period of days or weeks or months but 
years and in some cases decades, that 
they have written. 
Consider this statement from Sheriff 
David Mahoney from Dane County, WI, 
recently stepped down from the Na-
tional Sheriffs’ Association. 
Let me quickly add, the National 
Sheriffs’ Association is a powerful or-
ganization, and it is one that isn’t 
pushed around by any politicians. 
Sheriff Mahoney wrote—and I want 
to quote his words after some of the 
outrageous charges that have been 
made against Ms. Clarke this after-
noon. Sheriff Mahoney wrote: ‘‘Build-
ing trust between law enforcement and 
communities is essential for law en-
forcement to effectively serve all mem-
bers of our community. It is with this 
in mind that I strongly support Kristen 
Clarke. Ms. Clarke has built trust in 
every stage of her career.’’ 
Does that sound like someone who 
wants to defund the police? Do you 
think that this Sheriff Mahoney from 
Dane County in Wisconsin would say 
that about someone who wants to 
defund police? 
He went on to say: ‘‘When she was a 
federal prosecutor as a young attorney, 
she gained the trust of federal agents 
and domestic violence survivors and 
crime victims. When she was the Chief 
of the Civil Rights Bureau in the New 
York State Attorney General’s office, 
she built trust among New Yorkers to 
protect their rights, and with the Law-
yers’ Committee, she gained the trust 
of hate crimes victims and survivors.’’ 
She has so many endorsements from 
law enforcement groups and from pros-
ecutors. I am not going to read them 
all into the RECORD. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent to have letters of support for 
Ms. Clarke printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
Record, as follows:

Ms. Clarke has displayed the qualities of 
leadership, empathy, excellence, and persist-
ence in supporting and defending the U.S. 
Constitution while ensuring equal protection 
and justice for all Americans. This has been 
exhibited countless times in roles such as 
President of the Lawyers’ Committee for 
Civil Rights Under Law and Manager of the 
Civil Rights Bureau of the New York Depart-
ment of Law. 
It is NOBLE’s belief that Ms. Clarke will 
help to ensure the delivery of its mission 
which is to ensure equity in the administra-
tion of justice in the provision of public serv-
ice to all communities, and to serve as the 
conscience of law enforcement by being com-
mitted to Justice by Action. 
In closing, this correspondence acts as a 
formal endorsement of Ms. Kristen Clarke as 
the next Head of the U.S. Department of Jus-
tice Civil Rights Division. 
Sincerely, 
DWAYNE A. CRAWFORD, 
Executive Director. 
MAJOR CITIES CHIEFS ASSOCIATION,

Hon. LINDSEY GRAHAM, 
Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, 
U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. 
Hon. DIANNE FEINSTEIN, 
Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, 
U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. 
DEAR
CHAIRMAN
GRAHAM
AND
RANKING 
MEMBER FEINSTEIN: The Major Cities Chiefs 
Association, a professional organization of 
police executives representing the largest 
cities in the United States and Canada, is 
proud to endorse President Biden’s nomina-
tions of Lisa Monaco to serve as Deputy At-
torney General, Vanita Gupta to serve as As-
sociate 
Attorney 
General, 
and 
Kristen 
Clarke to serve as Assistant Attorney Gen-
eral for Civil Rights. 
The Department of Justice (DOJ) has been 
tasked with addressing a complex set of 
issues, including police reform, criminal jus-
tice reform, violent crime, and domestic ex-
tremism. The team President Biden has 
nominated is immensely qualified for this re-
sponsibility. The nominees have decades of 
experience serving in senior leadership roles 
within DOJ, other elements of the justice 
system, the private sector, civil rights and 
civil liberties organizations, and other key 
stakeholder groups. This experience will be 
invaluable as they work to tackle the many 
challenges facing DOJ. 
In conversations with MCCA leadership, 
the nominees listened intently to our con-
cerns and expressed a desire to collaborate 
closely with the MCCA. They indicated that 
open lines of communication and MCCA 
input are critical in addressing shared prior-
ities such as advancing constitutional polic-
ing, improving officer health and wellness, 
and combatting the rise in violent crime cur-
rently occurring across the country. 
President Biden’s DOJ nominees also made 
it clear that they neither support defunding 
the police nor believe that doing so will 
bring about the change our communities are 
calling for. They pledged to work closely 
with the MCCA to support and amplify the 
efforts already underway by many local law 
enforcement agencies to develop and imple-
ment policies and practices that are fair, eq-
uitable, transparent, and build trust and le-
gitimacy with all members of the commu-
nity. 
The MCCA believes these nominees will be 
effective leaders and valuable partners for 
local law enforcement agencies. On behalf of 
the MCCA membership, I respectfully re-
quest the Committee act swiftly and support 
the nominations of Ms. Monaco, Ms. Gupta, 
and Ms. Clarke. 
Sincerely, 
ART ACEVEDO, 
Chief, Houston Police Department, 
President, Major Cities Chiefs Association.

forts to recruit, train, mentor and promote 
qualified Hispanic American men and women 
committed to a career in the criminal jus-
tice arena and to the communities in which 
they serve and protect. 
HAPCOA acknowledges the work ethic and 
commitment of Ms. Clarke and believe that 
she will be an effective leader as the next

DEAR MAJORITY LEADER SCHUMER, MINOR-
ITY LEADER MCCONNELL, CHAIRMAN DURBIN 
AND RANKING MEMBER GRASSLEY: I write to 
express my strong support for Kristen 
Clarke, the President’s nominee to serve as 
Assistant Attorney General of the Civil 
Rights Division. 
I serve as the Sheriff in Dane County, Wis-
consin. I was first elected to this position in 
2006 and have served four terms in office, and 
have over 40 years of service in law enforce-
ment. Our office serves the city of Madison, 
the capital of Wisconsin, and its surrounding 
cities and towns. I also serve as President of 
the National Sheriffs’ Association, an orga-
nization I hold in very high regard. 
Building trust between law enforcement 
and communities is essential for law enforce-
ment to effectively serve all members of our 
community. This overarching value is a bed-
rock principle that has guided my steward-
ship of the Sheriff’s office, and is shared by 
law enforcement leaders all across the coun-
try. This bedrock value is also important to 
federal law enforcement leaders, who partner 
with state and local law enforcement to pro-
mote public safety and build public trust. 
It is with this in mind that I strongly sup-
port Kristen Clarke, the President’s Civil 
Rights Division nominee. Ms. Clarke has 
built trust at every stage of her career. When 
she was a federal prosecutor as a young at-
torney, she gained the trust of federal agents 
and domestic violence survivors and crime 
victims. When she was the Chief of the Civil 
Rights Bureau in the New York State Attor-
ney General’s office, she built trust among 
New Yorkers to protect their rights to prac-
tice their faiths, to allow for language ac-
cess, and to protect against discrimination 
at work. When Ms. Clarke left government 
service to lead the non-profit Lawyers’ Com-
mittee of Civil Rights Under Law, Ms. Clarke 
gained the trust of hate crimes victims and 
survivors, to ensure that they could obtain 
justice against their perpetrators. 
As a tireless advocate for those who have 
been targeted by inequality, hate, and dis-
crimination, Ms. Clarke is exactly the type 
of person who should be charged with guard-
ing and enforcing this country’s core federal 
civil rights laws. She is an exemplary lawyer 
and leader who possesses the character, 
qualifications, and commitment to lead the 
Civil Rights Division. 
I urge you and your colleagues to support 
Ms. Clarke’s nomination. 
Thank you for your consideration. 
Sincerely, 
DAVID J. MAHONEY, 
Sheriff, Dane County, Wisconsin. 
Mr. DURBIN. The point I am trying 
to make is this: At this moment in his-
tory, filling this Division, the Civil 
Rights Division, on the anniversary of 
George Floyd’s murder on the streets 
of Minneapolis, we are choosing the 
first woman of color in the history of 
the United States to head this Divi-
sion. 
It 
is 
a 
historic 
choice. 
It 
shouldn’t be trivialized by those who 
want to paint a caricature of this 
woman not even close to the truth. It 
shouldn’t be trivialized by ignoring the 
many endorsements she rightfully re-
ceived because of her good life’s work, 
having spent her entire career defend-
ing the civil rights of all Americans. 
Ms. Clarke is the right person for the 
job. President Joseph Biden believes 
that. The Attorney General believes it, 
and I believe it as well. At a time when 
we have seen an appalling rise in hate 
crimes, we need someone with her ex-
perience to head this Division. 
I urge my colleagues to take note of 
the continued need for the Civil Rights 
Division to do its important work 150 
years after its creation. Given that 
need and Ms. Clarke’s breadth and 
depth of experience, I urge all of my 
colleagues to vote in favor of her nomi-
nation. 
I yield the floor.

CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. MARSHALL. Madam President, I 
am here today to talk about the ori-
gins of the COVID–19 virus. I want to 
stop and thank the scientists and jour-
nalists who risked and in some in-
stances gave their lives to get the ge-
netic sequence of the virus and some 
hints of its origin out to the rest of the 
world to give us a fighting chance. 
I also want to thank the NIH and Dr. 
Francis Collins, whose team was able 
to stabilize the virus within a matter 
of weeks and share that technology 
with the world. This helped to quickly 
launch the success of Operation Warp 
Speed, as well as other research for 
testing, anti-virals, and vaccines. 
But now here we are 16 months into 
the most catastrophic health disaster 
of our lifetime, and we still have more 
questions than answers. At least 3 mil-
lion lives have been claimed by the 
virus, and we still don’t know its ori-
gin. More specifically, we don’t know 
its geographical or biological origin. 
The world deserves to know and needs 
to know where and how it started. Was 
it naturally occurring, or was it made 
in a lab? 
I am here today to tell you, the pre-
ponderance of evidence suggests that 
this virus leaked from a lab in Wuhan. 
But first let’s look at the mounting 
evidence suggesting that COVID–19 is 
truly a supervirus, the product of lab 
manipulations, including viral gain of 
function. In order to do this, we need 
to look at the world history of two 
similar events and the great work of 
scientists surrounding the containment 
of SARS in 2002 and MERS in 2012. 
For SARS, it took 4 months to find 
an intermediate host, a civet, a rac-
coon-looking mammal. Yes, it only 
took 4 months to prove that the SARS 
virus went from a bat to a civet to a 
human. Significantly, scientists found 
24 viral ancestors to SARS, as the virus

spontaneously mutated from a virus 
that would not easily attach to human 
cells into a more lethal virus. 
For MERS, it only took 9 months to 
find the virus occurring naturally in 
bats, and the intermediate host was 
camels. 
Yet, with COVID–19, here we are 
some 16 months later, and we have no 
intermediate host and no COVID–19 
found in a live bat. The Chinese tell us 
they tested over 80,000 viral sequences 
and have come up empty. Coincidence? 
No precursors, no grandfather or 
great-grandfathers, nothing close to re-
sembling COVID–19 has been found in 
nature. As a matter of fact, the closest 
virus we know of to COVID–19 is 
RaTG13, which has called the Wuhan 
Institute of Virology home for several 
years. This virus was supposedly from 
bats in Yunnan and transported by sci-
entists to the Wuhan viral lab, but of 
course the Chinese won’t hand the 
virus over to the world now for further 
study. 
Is it possible that RaTG13 could have 
been 
manipulated 
into 
COVID–19? 
Some experts would say yes. And we 
know, based upon the words of the WIV 
researcher, Dr. Shi, that the WIV had 
eight similar viruses to RaTG13, but 
China won’t share those either. What 
are they hiding? 
Here is another interesting feature of 
COVID–19. It likes humans more than 
bats. As a matter of fact, it doesn’t 
harm bats. So the CCP propaganda 
claims this virus comes from bats, but 
it doesn’t like bats. Riddle me that. 
Furthermore, no ancestors of COVID– 
19 have been found. Recall what typi-
cally occurs in nature is multiple 
mutations, just like with the SARS in-
fection. We should be able to find mul-
tiple mutations as the virus goes from 
bat loving, to an intermediate liking 
animal, to human liking, to human 
loving. We would certainly welcome 
contrary evidence from the Wuhan 
labs. 
Now if you will, forgive me for being 
a bit of a biology lover, but as a physi-
cian, I think we have to consider just 
how utterly ferocious and seemingly 
too perfect for nature this virus really 
is. 
COVID–19 has a very unique spike 
protein made up by two units. The first 
unit has an amazing affinity for human 
lung cells. It sticks like glue to human 
lung cells even if you only get a small 
whiff of it, and it uses the same human 
lung receptor that researchers in the 
United States and WIV have been 
working on together for viral gain of 
function and similar lab techniques for 
years. Perhaps this is just another co-
incidence. 
To be fair, I really do think all the 
research has been done with the best of 
intentions to develop vaccines for a 
possible future epidemic. For all I 
know, the research already done may 
have significantly sped up the success 
of Operation Warp Speed. 
Next we need to discuss one last 
point about this protein spike and how 
it interacts with human lung cells. And 
if there is a smoking gun, this is it. Re-
member I talked about this spike, this 
crown having two components, two 
units. Well, it just so happens that the 
human lung cell has a special cleaver, 
a cleaver that can recognize—you 
guessed it—a perfect spot on the 
COVID–19 spike. Bats don’t have this 
ability, but human lung cells do. 
Anyway, what happens is, after the 
COVID–19 virus attaches to the human 
lung cell like glue, the human lung cell 
cleaves the COVID–19 in this perfect 
spot, and only after this cleavage oc-
curs can the virus dump its genetic 
makeup into the human cell and take 
over the human genetic machinery. 
Now, just don’t forget your ninth 
grade biology class. A virus needs an-
other organism to reproduce, and this 
COVID–19 virus, once it grabs a human 
lung cell, it is not letting go until it 
takes over and starts to multiply like 
rabbits. After one cell grabs hold and 
dumps its genetic content, a chain re-
action occurs that really reminds me of 
a nuclear chain reaction. Once viral 
replication ignites, it is next to impos-
sible to stop. 
There are more microbiology nuances 
we could talk about and why this 
supervirus is not seemingly a virus 
from Mother Nature, but I think you 
get my point. Yes, I could be wrong. I 
hope I am wrong. But only the Wuhan 
labs have the data to prove me wrong, 
and I am afraid the data that would 
prove me right or wrong has been for-
ever destroyed. 
The geographical origination of this 
virus is much less complex to discuss. 
Today, all evidence points to the geo-
graphical start of this virus from or in 
very close proximity to the Wuhan 
labs. The wet market origination the-
ory has been completely dismantled 
and is really nothing more than the 
usual CCP propaganda and coverup 
that we have all seen too often. 
Now we know without any doubt that 
multiple infections predated the Janu-
ary 2020 event surrounding the wet 
market theory, and all these infections 
can be traced to a close proximity of 
the Wuhan labs. In fact, U.S. intel-
ligence 
reports 
recently 
confirmed 
what we have known for months—that 
some WIV researchers were hospital-
ized as early as the fall of 2019. 
Just to be clear, these bats that are 
known to harbor this family of viruses 
have a range of some 50 miles but live 
in caves in Yunnan Province approxi-
mately 1,000 miles away from Wuhan. 
The chances of a bat carrying this 
highly infectious virus 1,000 miles away 
without leaving a trail of infections be-
tween Yunnan and the WIV would be 
like the same person walking from New 
York to Kansas and being struck by 
lightning seven times and surviving. 
Again, China has the evidence to 
prove these theories wrong, and I wel-
come that data. As a physician, a Sen-
ator, a father, and a grandfather, we 
have to assume and prepare for the 
worst and judge the situation based 
upon the body of evidence that best de-
scribes this event. We have to get to 
the bottom of this regardless of whose 
fault it is or isn’t. We will need to 
know how to forgive. We will need to 
make others take responsibility. But 
what we can’t do is keep burying our 
heads in the sand, which is why I am 
calling on the U.S. delegation to the 
World Health Assembly meeting this 
week to do everything in their power 
to ensure that a full and unrestricted 
international scientific and forensic in-
vestigation into the origins will be au-
thorized and also for a parallel com-
prehensive, bipartisan Senate inves-
tigation into the origins as well. 
When that is finished, we need to 
take up the guardrails for viral gain-of- 
function studies. But in the meantime, 
the American people—really the entire 
world—deserve to know the answers to 
the origins of the COVID–19 virus. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
S. 1260 
Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I 
want to rise to say a few words about 
the U.S. Innovation and Competition 
Act, which we are debating today. I 
think that the thrust of that act and 
what we are trying to accomplish is 
enormously important. 
Right now, as I think most people 
know, we have a crisis in terms of 
microchip 
production 
here 
in 
the 
United States, and we are becoming in-
creasingly dependent upon countries 
all over the world. For our own manu-
facturing sector—the automobile sec-
tor, the electronics sector—that is a 
very bad position to be in, and also, ob-
viously, being dependent on other 
countries for microchips is a dangerous 
place to be in terms of national secu-
rity. 
I especially like provisions in this 
legislation which will increase funding 
for research and development, increase 
funding for science and technology, and 
invest in more Ph.D.s. We need more 
Ph.D.s in our country in science, tech-
nology, engineering, and math. I think 
those are very important steps in the 
right direction. 
But I do have some very serious con-
cerns about two provisions in this bill. 
No. 1, I am deeply concerned about the 
provisions which will provide $52 bil-
lion in emergency appropriations for 
the microchip industry, with no strings 
attached. Let me repeat that. We are 
talking about $52 billion in Federal 
funds—and, by the way, I suspect there 
will be more taxpayer money coming 
to these corporations from State and 
local government—with no strings at-
tached. And, second of all, there is a 
provision in this bill, not an appropria-
tion but an authorization, to provide 
some $10 billion to the Blue Origin 
space company, which is owned by the 
wealthiest person in the world, Mr. 
Bezos.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3399 
May 25, 2021 
When we talk about the microchip 
industry, we are talking about an in-
dustry that is not a poor, struggling in-
dustry. In fact, it is an extremely suc-
cessful and wealthy industry that is 
worth now more than half a trillion 
dollars—more than $500 billion. We are 
talking about an industry, interest-
ingly enough, that, at the same time 
we are now trying to provide corporate 
welfare to them, is an industry that 
has shut down over 780 manufacturing 
plants in the United States over the 
past several decades and laid off 150,000 
American workers. So what you have is 
a situation that, over the last two dec-
ades, these very large corporations 
said: Why do I want to stay in the 
United States of America, pay workers 
here a living wage, protect environ-
mental standards? I can go to compa-
nies in Asia and elsewhere and buy my 
products from them. The result, again, 
is 780 manufacturing plants in the last 
several decades have shut down in 
America, and 150,000 American workers 
were laid off. 
Now, let’s talk about how we don’t 
know 
exactly—nobody 
does—where 
this $52 billion in corporate welfare is 
going to go. But, obviously, it will go 
to some of the larger microchip compa-
nies, and one of the very largest is 
Intel. 
Let me say a word about Intel. Last 
year, Intel made nearly $21 billion in 
profits. So we are proposing to provide 
many billions of dollars to a company 
that, last year, made $21 billion in prof-
its. They spent $14.2 billion on stock 
buybacks—$14.2 
billion 
on 
stock 
buybacks. And, by the way, this com-
pany which is in line for a major infu-
sion of U.S. taxpayer money, provided 
$110 million signing bonus to its CEO, 
Patrick Gelsinger. 
Since 2015, this very same company, 
Intel, has shipped over 1,000 jobs over-
seas. Now, interestingly enough, Intel’s 
CEO has admitted recently that it does 
not need corporate welfare. Let’s give 
them credit for that. The CEO recently 
said his investment in America ‘‘does 
not depend on a penny of government 
support or state support or any other 
investments to make it successful and 
never will.’’ They are prepared to do it 
on their own, which is what we hope 
most private corporations would do. 
Now, among the other very large, 
leading microchip companies is the 
well-known Texas Instruments. They 
may well be in line to receive billions 
of dollars in corporate welfare as well 
under this piece of legislation. 
Last year, Texas Instruments made 
$5.6 billion in profits and spent $2.5 bil-
lion buying back its own stock, while 
it has outsourced thousands of jobs to 
low-wage countries. The CEO of Texas 
Instruments made over $30 million in 
total compensation last year—more 
than 400 times what the median worker 
at that company made. And this is also 
another company in line to receive bil-
lions and billions of dollars in Federal 
corporate welfare. 
Who else might receive corporate 
welfare under this bill? Well, how 
about the major semiconductor com-
pany from Taiwan called the Taiwan 
Semiconductor 
Manufacturing 
Com-
pany, or what is often referred to as 
‘‘TSMC,’’ which is a very, very, very 
large microchip company. It is inter-
esting to note who is the largest share-
holder in that company. Well, it should 
not surprise anybody because this is 
how countries around the world do in-
dustrial policy, but the largest share-
holder in TSMC is the Government of 
Taiwan. So when you give TSMC 
money, you are giving that money di-
rectly to the Government of Taiwan. 
Samsung, another very large cor-
porate entity, South Korean, it owns 
several plants in Texas. So what we are 
looking at here is a reality where tax-
payer money from working people in 
this country will be going to large, 
profitable corporations, and several of 
them are owned literally by other enti-
ties. 
In total, the top five semiconductor 
companies 
that 
may 
well 
receive 
grants under this legislation made 
nearly $35 billion in profits and spent 
more than $18 billion buying back its 
own stock last year. 
So here is the bottom line. I believe 
that we do want to grow the microchip 
industry here in the United States of 
America for reasons that everybody is 
familiar with. That is the industry 
that we need if we are going to grow 
the automobile industry, the elec-
tronics industry, and every other in-
dustry in this country. And we need to 
not be dependent upon China and other 
countries for the microchips that are 
used in these products. 
So I am sympathetic to the goal of 
this bill, but I am not sympathetic 
with the idea of simply laying out $52 
billion of taxpayers’ money with no 
strings attached. 
That is why I have introduced Senate 
amendment No. 2016. This amendment 
would prevent microchip companies 
from receiving taxpayer assistance un-
less they agree to issue warrants to the 
Federal Government. 
If private companies are going to 
benefit from over $52 billion in tax-
payer subsidies, the financial gains 
made by these companies must be 
shared with the American people, not 
just wealthy shareholders. In other 
words, all this amendment says is that 
if these companies want taxpayer as-
sistance, we are not going to socialize 
all of the risks and privatize all of the 
profits. 
And let me be very clear; this is not 
a radical idea. This is not something 
that I made up or any other Senator 
made up. These exact conditions were 
imposed on corporations that received 
taxpayer assistance in the bipartisan 
CARES Act, which passed the Senate 
96 to 0. In other words, every Member 
of the U.S. Senate has already voted 
for the conditions that are in the 
amendment that I cosponsored by Sen-
ator WARREN, by the way. They are in 
the amendment that we are offering. 
Further, this amendment will also 
require companies—again, all of this 
was in the CARES Act. Every Member 
or at least 96 Members of the Senate 
voted for these conditions—not a new 
idea. So in addition to making sure 
that companies allow for warrants, it 
would be demanded that they could not 
buy 
back 
their 
own 
stock, 
not 
outsource American jobs overseas, not 
repeal existing collective bargaining 
agreements, and remain neutral in any 
union organizing effort. 
Again, these are not new ideas, not 
radical ideas. All of these conditions 
are identical to the conditions that 
were placed in the CARES Act, which 
passed 96 to nothing. 
I also want to say a word about the 
provision in there that authorizes $10 
billion for Blue Origin, a company 
owned by Mr. Bezos. 
You know, when we were younger 
and Neil Armstrong made it to the 
Moon, there was incredible joy and 
pride in this country that the United 
States of America did something that 
people forever had thought was impos-
sible. We sent a man to the Moon, an 
extraordinary 
accomplishment. 
And 
the entire world watched that event 
with bated breath. It was just an ex-
traordinary accomplishment for all of 
humanity, not just the United States, 
but we have a special pride because 
that was our project. 
I worry very much that what we are 
seeing now are two of the wealthiest 
people in this country—Mr. Musk, Elon 
Musk, and Mr. Bezos—deciding that 
they are going to take control over our 
space efforts to get to the Moon and 
maybe even the extraordinary accom-
plishment of getting to Mars. What an 
accomplishment that would be. 
But I have to tell you that I have a 
real problem that, to a significant de-
gree, we are privatizing that effort. So 
that as a nation, we will not sit with 
pride in saying we did it but instead 
saying, well, maybe Mr. Bezos or 
maybe Mr. Musk sent somebody to the 
Moon or maybe even to Mars. This is 
something that should be an American 
effort, that all of us should be part of 
and not simply be a private corpora-
tion undertaking. So I have a real 
problem with the authorization of $10 
billion going to somebody who, among 
other things, is the wealthiest person 
in this country. 
So what I hope very much is that my 
amendment will be a part of the man-
agers’ amendments. I suspect there are 
Republicans who often tell us about 
wanting to save taxpayer dollars and 
not just throw them about who would 
be sympathetic to this effort, and I 
know there are a number of Democrats 
who are as well. So I would hope very 
much that my amendment No. 2016, 
which will be modified to just include 
provisions that were in the CARES bill, 
that it will be included in the man-
agers’ amendments that we will be vot-
ing on shortly. 
With that, I leave the microphone.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3400 
May 25, 2021 
Mr. 
CORNYN. 
Madam 
President, 
Texas has always been a proud sup-
porter of an ‘‘all of the above’’ energy 
strategy. We are often recognized as an 
oil and gas powerhouse, which we are, 
but most folks don’t know that we are 
the No. 1 producer of energy from wind, 
the No. 1 renewable resource. In fact, 
we now produce one-quarter of all wind 
energy in the United States. So if 
Texas were a country—and my friend 
from Vermont may be interested in 
this—we would be the fifth largest 
wind energy producer in the world. 
Mr. SANDERS. I did know that. 
Mr. CORNYN. And we don’t have any 
plans of stopping there. We are also 
making serious strides in energy inno-
vation. 
A couple of years ago, I visited the 
NET Power plant in La Porte, TX, 
right outside of Houston. NET Power is 
significant because it has developed a 
first-of-its-kind power system that gen-
erates affordable zero-emissions elec-
tricity. Using their unique carbon cap-
ture technology, they have taken nat-
ural gas, one of the most prevalent and 
affordable energy sources, and made it 
emission-free. That is what innovation 
can produce: emission-free electricity 
from natural gas. 
As impressive as this project is, 
though, it is made even better by the 
fact that it is not unique. Private com-
panies are harnessing the power of 
human ingenuity to make our most 
used energy sources emission-free. Ear-
lier this year, for example, ExxonMobil 
announced a $100 billion carbon capture 
and storage project in the Houston 
area, otherwise known as the energy 
capital of the world. This would create 
a carbon capture innovation zone to 
significantly reduce carbon emissions. 
ExxonMobil estimates this project 
has the potential to store up to 100 mil-
lion metric tons of carbon per year by 
the year 2040. A decade later, Houston 
could be carbon-neutral. 
These kind of developments, I think, 
are incredibly exciting, and they show-
case, once again, the power of innova-
tion not by the government but by the 
private sector. 
If we are able to reduce emissions 
without harming our energy security, 
raising taxes, killing high-paying jobs, 
or driving up costs to consumers on a 
fixed income, why wouldn’t we? Break-
neck changes in technology have fueled 
our economy, propelled the commu-
nications sector, and completely trans-
formed our daily lives. 
It is time to harness American inge-
nuity to revolutionize the energy sec-
tor. Smart policies can’t prioritize only 
conservation, 
productivity, 
or 
eco-
nomic power. We need to strike a bal-
ance of all three. You are simply not 
going to achieve the balance by impos-
ing heavy-handed regulations or mak-
ing it more expensive. Unfortunately, 
that seems to be exactly the path our 
Democratic colleagues in the Finance 
Committee want to take. 
Over the last couple of years, we have 
seen no shortage of unrealistic and 
downright harmful policies that are ad-
vocated for in the name of reducing 
carbon emissions. Some of our col-
leagues have proposed everything from 
the socialist paradise that is the Green 
New Deal to a more targeted but no 
more realistic net zero emissions bill. 
Tomorrow, as I suggested, the Fi-
nance Committee will mark up the lat-
est proposal, legislation introduced by 
Chairman WYDEN known by the innoc-
uous name of the Clean Energy for 
America Act. But the bill is anything 
but innocuous. The bill proposes a com-
plete overhaul of the energy tax code 
to finance the full gamut of clean en-
ergy policies. At its core, though, it is 
an anti-fossil fuel bill. 
Given the fact that more than 60 per-
cent of our electricity is generated by 
fossil fuels, that strikes me as a pretty 
radical position to take. This proposal 
uses a variety of tax increases to place 
a squeeze on fossil fuel producers and 
to push America toward renewables, 
which accounted for no less than 20 
percent of our energy production last 
year. In other words, they want to push 
us into the renewable space that only 
accounted for 20 percent of our energy 
production—completely unrealistic. 
This proposal would drive up costs 
for American energy producers and 
consumers, who would be the ones ulti-
mately footing the bill. Namely, senior 
citizens and those on fixed incomes 
would be the ones hurt the most. 
I also have serious concerns about 
how this dramatic shift would impact 
our energy security. The higher cost of 
domestic oil would, once again, make 
the United States rely on countries 
like Russia, Iran, and Venezuela for 
our energy needs, and obviously we can 
all see the dangers that would produce. 
Our friend John McCain aptly de-
scribed Russia at one time as ‘‘a gas 
station masquerading as a country.’’ 
Well, that was pretty funny, but it is 
also 
pretty 
accurate. 
Having 
the 
United States and our other allies over 
a barrel because of lack of energy di-
versification and domestic production 
gives them a lot of power—and too 
much power. 
We know what it has been like for re-
cent decades before we became more 
self-sufficient when it came to energy 
production. I remember, back in 1980, 
Jimmy Carter famously issued the Car-
ter doctrine after the Soviets invaded 
Afghanistan. He suggested that if any-
one, any country, any adversary of the 
United States were to blockade the 
Strait of Hormuz, it would be an act of 
war 
because 
the 
oil 
that 
flowed 
through the Strait of Hormuz was es-
sential for our national security and 
our economy. 
So why in the world would we want 
to return to those bad old days when 
we were dependent on imported en-
ergy? Well, this issue was further un-
derscored in 2009, when Russia effec-
tively turned off the gas in Ukraine for 
almost 3 weeks. This affected at least 
10 countries in Europe whose natural 
gas flowed through that pipeline in 
Ukraine. 
If these tax hikes slowly strangle 
U.S. energy companies, we could end 
up in the same position: dependent on 
others for our basic energy needs. After 
years of building our energy independ-
ence and strengthening our energy se-
curity, now is not the time to turn 
back the clock. We simply should not 
put ourselves in a position where we 
are reliant on any other country, let 
alone our adversaries, to keep our 
lights on and to keep our economy 
humming. 
And the consequences don’t stop 
there. Beyond harming our energy se-
curity, the legislation that the Finance 
Committee 
will 
consider 
tomorrow 
would kill countless high-paying jobs. 
It would weaken our global competi-
tiveness and reverse the economic 
gains we have made because of a thriv-
ing oil and gas industry. And that is 
just scratching the surface of this mis-
guided bill. 
One of the most outrageous provi-
sions, though, is the electric vehicle 
tax credit proposal. We all know that 
out of the 280 million cars on the road 
in America, the vast majority of Amer-
icans drive cars that run on gas or die-
sel. When they fill up their tank at the 
gas station, they pay a user fee, or a 
tax, on every gallon they buy. Some of 
that money goes into the highway 
trust fund, the pot of money that pays 
to build and repair the roads and 
bridges we drive on every day. As we 
all know, though, the highway trust 
fund is in dire straits. Unless some-
thing changes, the shortfall over the 
next decade is expected to be nearly 
$200 billion. 
Those who drive electric cars don’t 
buy gasoline, obviously. They don’t 
contribute to the highway trust fund. 
They don’t pay anything to drive on 
the roads and bridges every other 
American has to pay for and ulti-
mately subsidizes. 
The proposal by the chairman of the 
Finance Committee doubles down on 
this problem and makes Americans do 
even more to subsidize the pricey elec-
tric vehicles owned by wealthy con-
sumers. This legislation extends elec-
tric vehicle incentives, which will 
come at the cost of other taxpayers, 
without addressing the fact that elec-
tric vehicles are already driving on 
taxpayer-funded roads virtually free of 
charge. This is incredibly expensive 
and benefits only a limited group of 
wealthy Americans. 
Let’s compare the cost of this pro-
gram to the carbon capture projects I 
mentioned. Current electric vehicle 
subsidies equate to spending about $455 
for every ton of CO2 that is reduced. As 
a reminder, this applies only to emis-
sion reduction for cars. Electric vehicle 
subsidies have zero bearing on the car-
bon emission of the manufacturing sec-
tor, power generation, or other emis-
sion-intensive industries. 
Carbon capture and storage, like the 
ExxonMobil project I mentioned ear-
lier, can apply to virtually every 
source of emissions and at a much

lower cost. CO2 can be abated for $100 
to $200 per ton. That is less than half 
the price of an electric vehicle subsidy. 
I support efforts to reduce carbon 
emissions to preserve our air, land, and 
water for future generations, but those 
efforts don’t have to come at this sort 
of exorbitant price. You can support all 
energy sectors and innovation and con-
servation. These are not mutually ex-
clusive. 
One great example is a bill I intro-
duced called the LEADING Act, which 
was signed into law last year. This leg-
islation incentivizes the research and 
development of carbon capture tech-
nology for natural gas and innovation 
in the energy industry at large. That is 
how we can keep costs down for tax-
payers and maintain this revolution in 
the energy sector. 
So I will continue to push back on ef-
forts to weaken our energy independ-
ence and harm our economy in pursuit 
of arbitrary goals. There is simply no 
reason to stick taxpayers with the bill 
for these unnecessary policies when 
there are better commonsense ways to 
promote both innovation and conserva-
tion. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
ORDER OF BUSINESS 
Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the Sen-
ate resume legislative session; that the 
Senate resume consideration of S. 1260; 
and that the following amendments be 
called up and reported by number: 
Wyden, 1975; Crapo, 1565; Paul, 2003; 
Ernst, 1507; Daines, 1787; and Lee, 1891; 
further, that at 4:45 p.m. today, the 
Senate vote in relation to the amend-
ments in the order listed with no 
amendments in order to these amend-
ments prior to the vote in relation to 
the amendment, with 60 affirmative 
votes required for adoption and 2 min-
utes of debate, equally divided, prior to 
each vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
LEGISLATIVE SESSION 
The Senate will now resume legisla-
tive session. 
The Senator from Mississippi. 
S. 1260 
Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I 
would like to be recognized for a mo-
ment before we proceed. 
This is an important step in the con-
sideration of the Endless Frontier Act. 
We have just locked in six votes for 
this afternoon—two important side by 
sides, WYDEN and CRAPO on Finance 
Committee matters; a Paul amend-
ment on the National Institutes of 
Health funds being used in China; an 
Ernst amendment on the Wuhan lab; a 
Daines 
amendment 
on 
intellectual 
property in China; and the Lee amend-
ment on stem cell research. 
This is a great step forward; that the 
Senate is proceeding this afternoon to 
regular order, and regular order allow-
ing Senators to come forward and offer 
amendments that might improve the 
bill is helpful. It is hoped that we can 
do that again tomorrow and Thursday 
and move toward an opportunity to 
pass this bill. 
I would point out to my colleagues— 
and I know the distinguished chair of 
the Finance Committee will agree with 
this. We have locked in six 15-minute 
votes. In fairness, really, the five sub-
sequent votes should be 10-minute 
votes. We can fool around and wander 
in here for hours and be here until 8 or 
we can begin at 4:45 and resume the 
practice that we had for years before 
we quit doing regular order in this 
body. 
If Members will hold each other ac-
countable and if the Chair is willing to 
say after a certain amount of time, if a 
straggler is missing, that that Senator 
simply has missed votes, then we can 
do this in an orderly fashion. I have an 
appointment at 5:30 that I have had to 
cancel. Perhaps others will have to do 
that too. 
But we are making progress on a 
very substantive bill about the future 
of this country and moving toward 
competing in a better way with China. 
And I would suggest that maybe ap-
pointments in the early afternoon 
might be canceled, and we can get back 
to quick votes and be considerate of 
others, realizing that some of us may 
miss votes if we are late. I make that 
suggestion, and I thank my colleagues 
on both sides of the aisle for the hard 
work in locking in these six votes. 
I yield back.

ating objectives, and congressional over-
sight requirements relating to the response 
to the COVID–19 pandemic) 
At the end of title III of division F, add the 
following: 
SEC. 6302. TRADE POLICY AND CONGRESSIONAL 
OVERSIGHT OF COVID–19 RESPONSE. 
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) it is imperative to promote the develop-
ment and deployment of vaccines, including 
to address pandemics like the pandemic re-
lating to COVID–19 and its variants; 
(2) as a developed nation with a long-
standing commitment to promoting global 
health, innovation, access to medicine, pub-
lic welfare, and security, the United States 
will continue to use the resources and tools 
at its disposal to promote the distribution of 
life-saving COVID–19 vaccines to other coun-
tries; 
(3) President Biden should continue to 
work with foreign governments, multilateral 
institutions, 
nongovernmental 
organiza-
tions, manufacturers, and other stakeholders 
to quickly identify and address, through tar-
geted and meaningful action, obstacles to 
ending the COVID–19 pandemic, whether 
those obstacles are legal, regulatory, con-
tractual, or otherwise; 
(4) in any efforts to address trade-related 
obstacles to ending the COVID–19 pandemic, 
President Biden should consider how any ac-
tion would complement the whole-of-govern-
ment approach of the President to ending 
the COVID–19 pandemic worldwide, including 
how any action would impact competitive-
ness, innovation, and the national security 
of the United States in the short- and long- 
term; 
(5) the President should strive to create 
the most appropriate balance between access 
to COVID–19 vaccines and therapeutics and 
generating an innovative environment in the 
United States; 
(6) the President should take into account 
the efforts of malign nations or entities to 
obtain intellectual property of United States 
persons through forced technology transfer, 
theft, or espionage, and accordingly make all 
efforts to protect that intellectual property 
from such nations or entities; and 
(7) in any efforts to address trade-related 
obstacles to ending the COVID–19 pandemic, 
Congress expects timely and meaningful con-
sultations on any negotiations and any 
agreements or decisions reached regarding 
matters of concern to members of Congress 
and their constituents, including issues of 
competitiveness, innovation, and national 
security. 
(b) TRADE POLICIES WITH RESPECT TO THE 
COVID–19 PANDEMIC.— 
(1) IN
GENERAL.—It is the policy of the 
United States to facilitate an effective and 
efficient response to the global pandemic 
with respect to COVID–19 by expediting ac-
cess 
to

vaccines, 
medicines, 
diagnostics, medical equipment, and per-
sonal protective equipment. 
(2) ELEMENTS.—The United States Trade 
Representative shall pursue a timely, effec-
tive, and efficient response to the trade as-
pects of the COVID–19 pandemic, including 
by endeavoring to— 
(A) expedite access to medicines and life- 
saving products through trade facilitation 
measures; 
(B) obtain a reduction or elimination of 
nontariff barriers and distortions that im-
pact the procurement of life-saving products; 
(C) take action to increase access to 
COVID–19 vaccines globally, while avoiding 
providing access to intellectual property to 
nations or entities that seek to utilize the

technology for other uses or that may other-
wise pose a threat to national security; 
(D) eliminate practices that adversely af-
fect trade in perishable or temperature-sen-
sitive products, and facilitate the transfer of 
materials and products in a manner that pre-
serves their integrity; 
(E) further strengthen the system of inter-
national trade and investment disciplines by 
demonstrating sufficient flexibility to re-
spond to a global crisis while retaining a bal-
anced approach to the rights of innovators; 
(F) encourage greater cooperation between 
the World Trade Organization and other 
international organizations and public-pri-
vate 
partnerships, 
including 
the 
World 
Health Organization, the United Nations 
Children’s Emergency Fund (commonly re-
ferred to as ‘‘UNICEF’’), the World Bank, 
and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance; and 
(G) take into account other legitimate do-
mestic policies of the United States, includ-
ing health and safety, national security, con-
sumer interests, intellectual property rights, 
and the laws and regulations related thereto. 
(c) CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT, CONSULTA-
TIONS, AND ACCESS TO INFORMATION.— 
(1) INTENT
TO

States Trade Representative enters any ne-
gotiation pursuant to the trade policies de-
scribed in subsection (b), the Trade Rep-
resentative shall— 
(A) submit to Congress and publish in the 
Federal Register a statement specifying the 
objectives of the United States in pursuing 
the negotiation; and 
(B) submit to Congress an assessment of 
how and to what extent entering the nego-
tiation will achieve the trade policies de-
scribed in subsection (b). 
(2) CONSULTATION
AND
BRIEFING
BEFORE 
MAKING PROPOSALS.—Before making any tex-
tual proposal pursuant to the trade policies 
described in subsection (b), the United States 
Trade Representative shall—

Expansion Act of 1962 (19 U.S.C. 1872), consult 
with the heads of relevant Federal agencies, 
including the Secretary of Commerce, the 
Secretary of Health and Human Services, 
and the Secretary of Defense, which shall in-
clude, as appropriate, discussion of— 
(i) the most effective means of addressing 
the COVID–19 pandemic and any variants to 
the COVID–19 virus, including by increasing 
the distribution of COVID–19 vaccines; 
(ii) any sensitive technology or intellec-
tual property rights related to the proposal; 
(iii) any nations or entities of concern that 
may benefit from the proposal; and 
(iv) other issues that may influence nego-
tiations with respect to the proposal; and

PROPERTY 
PROVISIONS 
OF 
ECO-
NOMIC AND TRADE AGREEMENT BE-
TWEEN THE GOVERNMENT OF THE 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND 
THE GOVERNMENT OF CHINA. 
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) the Agreement includes significant 
mandates for the People’s Republic of China 
related to its domestic intellectual property 
regime, including with respect to copyrights, 
trademarks, trade secrets, and patents; 
(2) the changes included in the Agreement, 
if implemented effectively, should improve 
the domestic intellectual property frame-
work of the People’s Republic of China, 
which has historically proven to harm the 
innovation and creative communities in the 
United States; 
(3) despite commitments made by the Gov-
ernment of the People’s Republic of China 
under the Agreement, ongoing market access 
barriers, uneven enforcement, measures re-
quiring forced technology transfer, and seri-
ous deficiencies in the rule of law continue 
to make the business environment in the 
People’s Republic of China highly chal-
lenging for rights holders in the United 
States; 
(4) as reflected in the 2021 report by the 
United States Trade Representative required 
under section 182(h) of the Trade Act of 1974 
(19 U.S.C. 2242(h)) (commonly referred to as 
the ‘‘Special 301 Report’’), the People’s Re-
public of China has consistently been listed 
in that annual report since 1989 as a trading 
partner of the United States that ‘‘fails to 
provide adequate and effective IP protection 
and enforcement for U.S. inventors, creators, 
brands, manufacturers, and service pro-
viders, which, in turn, harm American work-
ers’’; and 
(5) Congress encourages the United States 
Trade Representative, the Attorney General, 
the Secretary of State, the Secretary of 
Homeland Security, the Secretary of Com-
merce, and the Director of the United States 
Patent and Trademark Office— 
(A) to use all available tools to ensure that 
the People’s Republic of China fully imple-
ments its commitments under the Agree-
ment; and 
(B) to actively consider additional means 
to require the People’s Republic of China to 
address unfair market access barriers, forced 
technology 
transfer 
requirements, 
and 
broader intellectual property theft concerns, 
including through future trade agreements 
and working with partners in multilateral 
organizations, such as the Group of 7 (G7), 
the Group of 20 (G20), and the World Trade 
Organization.

The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MUR-
PHY). The Senator from Delaware. 
WASHINGTON, D.C. ADMISSION ACT 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise 
this afternoon, along with several of 
our colleagues, to discuss the need to 
end the policy of taxation without rep-
resentation, which millions of Ameri-
cans in the District of Columbia have 
endured for over 200 years and hun-
dreds of thousands still endure today. 
This policy was wrong in 1776, when 
13 colonies took on the mightiest na-
tion on Earth to end it. It is wrong 
today, and we seek to end it through 
the enactment of S. 51, the Wash-
ington, D.C. Admission Act. 
In just 6 days, our country will ob-
serve Memorial Day, a holiday often 
observed to mark the start of summer. 
We celebrate it to mark the start of 
summer. But on Memorial Day of this 
year, many of us will pause to remem-
ber the generations of Americans in 
our Armed Forces who have laid down 
their lives for our country. That is 
what Memorial Day is all about. This 
day means something special in my 
own family. My own maternal grand-
mother was a Gold Star mother. 
With the death of John McCain, I am 
the last Vietnam veteran serving in the 
U.S. Senate. 
The names of some 58,000 men and 
women with whom John and I served 
are engraved on a black granite wall 
near the Lincoln Memorial, just a few 
miles from where we are standing 
today. The heroes named on that wall 
include brave men and women from 
Washington, DC, as well. Since World 
War I, in fact, over 5,000 Americans 
from the District of Columbia have lost 
their lives in service to the United 
States. And, today, roughly 15,000 DC 
residents are on Active Duty or serving 
as reservists or members of the Na-
tional Guard in the States. That is 
15,000 Americans serving dutifully in 
the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, or 
the Coast Guard. 
Our Nation’s Capital is home to more 
than just monuments and museums. It 
is home to Americans who work, who 
start businesses, and who contribute to 
America’s economy. And just like all 50 
States represented in this body, the 
District of Columbia is home to vet-
erans and servicemembers who risk 
their lives for our country, even today. 
But, year after year, they come home 
to find that they are still denied the 
ability to have a real say in our Na-
tion’s future. 
These heroes are among the nearly 
700,000 Americans who call the District 
home and for generations have lived 
without voting representation in Con-
gress. That is why I view Washington, 
DC’s statehood not as a Republican or 
Democratic issue, not as a political 
issue but as an American issue—as an 
issue of basic fairness and equality. 
Earlier this year, the senior Senator 
from Utah sought to overturn a law 
passed by the DC City Council, right 
here on the Senate floor. As U.S. Sen-
ators, neither of us should have such an 
opportunity to intervene in a local 
matter like that. But in the Senate, we 
have power over the budget of the Dis-
trict of Columbia—let me just point 
this out—a city that has a double A- 
plus credit rating—double A-plus. I am 
an old State treasurer. That is pretty 
darned good—better than most States, 
in fact, if you check. 
We also have confirmation power in 
the Congress over the District’s judges, 
an arrangement that needlessly led to 
extensive judicial vacancies and de-
layed justices for weeks, for months, 
and, in some cases, for years. That is 
wrong. 
I reminded my colleagues that day 
that no one in this room was elected by 
the people of the District of Columbia. 
Nobody in this room was elected by the 
people of the District of Columbia, and 
no one here was able to stand up and 
represent their interests. This should 
be unacceptable in a 21st century de-
mocracy. 
However, I believe that the tide is 
starting to turn. I believe we can fi-
nally make DC statehood a reality dur-
ing this Congress, the 117th Congress. 
We have a fearless champion in the 
House, 
Congresswoman 
ELEANOR 
HOLMES NORTON. With her leadership, 
along with that of the Speaker and 
Leader STENY HOYER, the House passed 
their DC statehood bill last month for 
the second time—the second time ever. 
We also have, for the first time, a 
President who formally supports end-
ing this policy—this modern-day pol-
icy—of taxation without representa-
tion. And in the Senate, we have a 
record 45 cosponsors on our bill to 
make the District of Columbia a State, 
a number that represents Members 
from rural and urban areas alike. This 
number has grown steadily since my 
friend, our former colleague, Joe Lie-
berman—a fiercely independent Sen-
ator from Connecticut—led this charge 
in the Senate before passing the baton 
to me in 2013. 
I know that some of our colleagues 
have said that DC statehood is uncon-
stitutional. To be clear, the District of 
Columbia has taken the same steps for 
statehood that 37 other States have 
taken since 1791—the same steps—a 
process clearly laid out in our Con-
stitution. This case was made clearly 
in a letter to Congress just this week 
from nearly 40 leading constitutional 
scholars, who wrote that Congress is 
well within its rights to grant state-
hood. 
On a different holiday later this sum-
mer, we will be celebrating July 
Fourth to remember those who fought 
for our independence, and I will remind 
my colleagues again that the Founding 
Fathers, the same men who wrote our 
Constitution, had a rallying cry during 
the Revolutionary War: There is no 
taxation without representation. 
Yet that is exactly what is happening 
to the citizens in the District of Co-
lumbia today. The reality is that these 
citizens pay the most—get this, the 
citizens of the District of Columbia pay 
the most—in per capita Federal income 
taxes in the United States, more than 
any other State, but they have no say 
in how those dollars are spent, none. 
This second-class status must come 
to an end, and we in Congress are the 
ones who can do something about it. 
Winston Churchill once said: You can 
always count on America to do the 
right thing in the end, after they have 
tried everything else. 
It is never too late to do the right 
thing. The right thing to do now is to 
ensure that nearly 700,000 Americans 
living in the District of Columbia, 
serving in our military, voting, actu-
ally have a chance to vote on the rep-
resentation in this body and in the 
House. The right thing to do is to end 
this policy of taxation without rep-
resentation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3404 
May 25, 2021 
With that, I thank you, and I yield 
the floor to some of my colleagues who, 
I believe, will be joining us on this call, 
including the Senator from New Jer-
sey. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I am 
honored to join in a colloquy with 
some of my colleagues today on this 
urgent issue to really talk about the 
central function of our democracy, 
whether the ideals of this Nation are 
real for every American. 
Now, if you cut me, I am going to 
bleed Jersey. But let me tell you very 
plainly that I am proud to have grown 
up in Jersey, but I am also proud to 
have been born in Washington, DC. 
This is where my parents met after col-
lege. This is where they fell in love. 
Their first date was at the Jefferson 
Memorial, at the paddle boats there at 
the Reflecting Pool. They, there, re-
member—telling 
me—just 
the 
love 
they had for each other that was al-
ready dawning, but also this fierce alle-
giance to this incredible community 
that is Washington, DC. My mom 
talked about the activism that was 
here. She was working for the public 
schools as a speech pathologist, and 
she talked about this patriotic feel 
that she had, especially when she was 
helping to organize the March on 
Washington. The words on the Jeffer-
son Memorial, where my parents had 
their first date, at the end of Declara-
tion of Independence, say: ‘‘[W]e mutu-
ally pledge . . . our Lives, our For-
tunes, and our sacred Honor.’’ 
That is what we are called to pledge 
to one another, but for too long the 
people of this city have not had the 
honor, the privileges, the equal citizen-
ship rights that so many others in 
every State in our Union, in all parts 
of our democracy, enjoy. These are 
rights, as my colleague says, that 
Washington, DC—in fact, dispropor-
tionate to many other States—people 
from this community have bled for and 
died for. 
This city is an extraordinary place. 
It is a community. It outnumbers, in 
fact, in population other States. And 
we believe that the ideals of one per-
son, one vote, no taxation without rep-
resentation—that 
all 
of 
these 
are 
rights being denied fellow Americans. 
Where is the honor in that? 
Veterans and servicemembers living 
here in DC did indeed fight for us, put 
their lives on the line for us, but do not 
have equal citizenship rights. 
The people of DC pay both local and 
Federal taxes that go to help the peo-
ple in red States and blue States. They 
are a city that pays more taxes than 
they are necessarily receiving back, 
but when the people of DC need help, 
when they need an advocate with vot-
ing power, they don’t have one in this 
body or in the one across the hall. 
The lack of representation really has 
consequences—serious ones—that sig-
nificantly decreases DC’s leverage in 
getting laws passed and securing vital 
resources for its residents. We saw this 
firsthand in the first COVID–19 stim-
ulus bill. Washington, DC, received $725 
million less in critical aid than other 
less populous States. That was funding 
needed for Washington, DC, first re-
sponders, for COVID–19 tests, and other 
important lifesaving services. They 
were treated as second-class citizens. 
How is this fair? How is this just? 
How is this sacred honor? And how can 
this be partisan? These are our sac-
rosanct values for those of us on both 
sides of the aisle. This is how our de-
mocracy was intended to function. 
These were some of the elements of the 
Revolutionary War. 
I am hard-pressed to believe that my 
colleagues on either side of the aisle 
don’t recognize that to deny the people 
of Washington, DC, representation is 
contrary to the values that we state 
regularly on this floor. Making DC a 
State is truly a civil rights issue, and 
it is also an issue of racial justice. 
DC is a majority-minority city, and 
the people of this city deserve the same 
opportunity that other less populated 
States have to make their voices heard 
in Congress. This is especially urgent 
as we are seeing so many States around 
the country enact sweeping voting laws 
intended to make it harder for the DC 
majority—Black and Brown folks—to 
even vote. 
As U.S. Senators, we have an obliga-
tion not just to pass laws but to be 
stewards of democratic ideals and prin-
cipals. We took an oath to that. Mak-
ing DC a State is not just a matter of 
civil rights for DC. It is about all of us 
because our democracy will only sur-
vive as long as its true representation 
is that of all of its people. Truly, we 
know in this Nation—it has been said 
by greater leaders before us—that in-
justice anywhere is a threat to justice 
everywhere. 
The people of DC have made clear 
what they want, saying it loudly. They 
deserve full citizenship rights. They de-
serve the right to vote. They deserve 
the right to have representation. They 
want to be the 51st State. They should 
be the 51st State. 
My parents lived for many years in 
this city, and I heard about DC state-
hood as a little boy growing up in New 
Jersey. For them, it was a matter of 
dignity and respect. It was a matter of 
valuing this community and the rich-
ness of its people. To them, it is a 
shortfall in the evolution of our democ-
racy that the people of this great city 
should be denied the very ideals that 
are written on the Jefferson Memorial. 
I urge my colleagues to move on this 
and to grant this DC statehood and to 
afford them the sacred honor that all 
Americans deserve. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia. 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I am 
thrilled to rise and join my colleagues 
in pressing the case for DC statehood. I 
won’t be long because I was on the 
floor about 3 weeks ago talking about 
this same matter. I really talked about 
Virginia then. I talked about Patrick 
Henry. 
The phrase ‘‘no taxation without rep-
resentation’’ is a phrase that we learn 
coming up in elementary school. The 
root of it isn’t really at the beginning 
of, say, the Declaration of Independ-
ence or during the Revolutionary War; 
that phrase really came about as colo-
nists rallied to oppose the Stamp Act. 
The Stamp Act was an act of Par-
liament in 1765 that put a tax on paper 
goods, including newspapers and pam-
phlets and periodicals. The English 
Crown was getting very, very worried 
about the restive nature of Americans 
pressing their case for being treated 
equally as royal colonists and subjects 
of the Crown, but they were not happy 
with the way they were being treated. 
The Stamp Act was an attempt not 
just to levy a tax, but it was also an at-
tempt to shut down their rights to 
have political discussions. 
Patrick Henry led an effort in the 
Virginia General Assembly in 1765 that 
came to be known as the four resolves. 
He put five resolves on the table, one of 
which was set aside, but four resolves 
were passed, and the core of the four 
resolves was to protest taxation with-
out representation. 
One of my great regrets was wanting 
to hear the great orators of history and 
never to have had a chance to hear 
Patrick Henry, although I have heard 
good Patrick Henry impersonations at 
St. John’s Church in Richmond. What a 
powerful speaker—the ‘‘Give me liberty 
or give me death’’ speech on the very 
kind of verge of the United States de-
claring independence; his court advo-
cacy as a relatively untrained lawyer 
in Virginia on behalf of religious free-
doms so that people who were not part 
of the established Church of England 
could still practice their faith as they 
chose. But many believe that Henry’s 
advocacy against the Stamp Act was 
his most powerful oratory. 
I read excerpts from the resolves 
when I was here 3 weeks ago, but now 
I want to jump from Patrick Henry to 
somebody else who is very much in the 
spirit of Patrick Henry, and that is 
Frederick Douglass. 
If DC becomes a State, it will become 
a State named in honor of the aboli-
tionist Frederick Douglass. 
Frederick Douglass certainly was an 
inheritor of the Patrick Henry tradi-
tion. He was enslaved for the first 20 
years of his life, and then following the 
Civil War, he moved to the Nation’s 
Capital to become so many things—dip-
lomat, civil rights leader, confidant of 
President Lincoln, President Grant, 
and others. 
In his autobiography, ‘‘The Life and 
Times 
of 
Frederick 
Douglass,’’ 
he 
wrote: 
The District of Columbia is the one spot 
where there is no government for the people, 
of the people, and by the people. Its citizens 
submit to rulers whom they have had no 
choice in selecting. They obey laws which 
they had no voice in making. They have a

[sic] plenty of taxation, but no representa-
tion. In the great questions of politics in the 
country, they can march with neither army 
[neither party], but are relegated to the posi-
tion of neuters. 
Those are the words of the great 
Frederick Douglass echoing the Pat-
rick Henry speech a century earlier 
against the Stamp Act. Those words 
are as true today as they were when he 
wrote them, and they were as true 
when he wrote them as when Patrick 
Henry delivered them in 1765. 
In the history of States coming into 
the Union, most States have some pret-
ty interesting background and history, 
but there are some common themes. 
The 
two 
commonalities—but 
then 
there has been one quirk that I want to 
mention as I conclude—the two com-
monalities are States come into the 
Union when they achieve sufficient 
population and when they have a dem-
onstrated desire that is not just tem-
porary, effervescent, but is essentially 
fixed and permanent. 
In the mid-1800s, Congress would set 
a population deadline. Say, for exam-
ple, in the Northwest Territory, Michi-
gan was told: As soon as you get to 
60,000 residents, then we will entertain 
you if you want to be a State, but you 
have to do a referendum first. 
There is no minimum number estab-
lished by Congress in terms of popu-
lation now to become a State, but we 
would all agree that DC would pass any 
minimum because DC is larger than 
States that currently are part of the 
Union. So whatever criteria we might 
set—well, you need to be of sufficient 
size to be a State—DC has met that. 
DC has met the second criteria as 
well, which is demonstrated desire, 
most recently in a referendum in 2016 
where the overwhelming sentiment of 
DC, as you would expect, was a patri-
otic sentiment: We want to be a State 
of the greatest Nation on Earth. 
So those two criteria have usually 
been sufficient for States having dem-
onstrated that or territories or popu-
lations having demonstrated that to 
become part of the Union and to have 
their star added to the flag of this 
country. 
There 
have 
been 
controversies, 
though, bluntly, when States have siz-
able minority populations. 
The quest of Hawaii for statehood 
took longer than it otherwise would 
have because many Members of this 
body stood on the floor and expressed 
concerns about whether Hawaii would 
be a cultural match for the United 
States because of the predominant API 
and indigenous population. I am sad to 
say that some of those who took the 
floor and raised those questions and ob-
jections were from Virginia. 
The State of New Mexico had a par-
ticularly rocky path to becoming a 
State because Members of this body, 
including from Virginia, took the floor 
and raised a question about the size, 
the population, the percentage of New 
Mexico’s indigenous and Latino popu-
lation. 
About 46 percent of the population of 
DC is African American, folks who— 
many march in the footsteps and quest 
for the same equality that Frederick 
Douglass was questing for in the 1800s. 
I hope we can show that the failures 
of the past that led statehood for New 
Mexico and Hawaii to take perhaps 
longer than should have been the 
case—I hope we will have learned 
something from that and can move fi-
nally to grant these 700,000-plus resi-
dents of this wonderful city in our Na-
tion’s Capital the ability to be a State. 
The last thing I will say is this. I did 
say this when I was on the floor 3 
months ago. We haven’t added a State, 
we haven’t added a star to our flag for 
I guess 70 years now, about 70 years. I 
don’t think a fixed number of stars on 
the flag sends a message of a growing, 
thriving nation. I think it might send 
the message of a nation that is kind of 
fixed. When you are fixed and set and 
not willing to change, I believe that 
can almost send a little bit of a mes-
sage of decline. 
Throughout our Nation’s history, the 
addition of stars to the flag has sent 
the message of an America that—we 
are not done growing. We are not done 
expanding. We are on the move. His-
tory isn’t done with us yet. 
The fact that we haven’t added a 
State—this has been the longest period 
of time in the history of the United 
States where we haven’t added a star 
to the flag. I think doing so would sug-
gest very powerfully that the best days 
of our Nation aren’t behind us; they are 
still ahead of us. 
For these reasons and those articu-
lated by my colleagues, I strongly sup-
port the effort for DC statehood. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I 
want to start by thanking the senior 
Senator from Delaware for his long-
time persistence in making sure that 
this Congress ultimately does the right 
thing and makes the District of Colum-
bia the 51st State. 
I want to thank Congresswoman EL-
EANOR HOLMES NORTON for representing 
the people of the District of Columbia 
so ably. She deserves a vote in the 
House of Representatives just like 
every other Member of the House of 
Representatives from the 50 States. 
The District of Columbia deserves two 
Senators right here in the U.S. Con-
gress. 
I want to thank President Biden for 
saying that if this Senate will just get 
this bill to his desk, he will sign that 
piece of legislation and make sure that 
these people in the District of Colum-
bia are represented as every other cit-
izen in the 50 States is currently rep-
resented. 
All of us come to this floor and we 
hear our colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle talking about the importance of 
democracy 
overseas. 
We 
criticize 
China, rightly, when it begins to snuff 
out the right to vote in Hong Kong. We 
criticize the authoritarian rulers in 
Belarus when they clamp down on free-
dom. We look around the world, and we 
try our best to establish a standard for 
standing up for the principle of democ-
racy. We are not always consistent. We 
are not always constant in that mes-
sage, but we make an effort to do that. 
We need to look in the mirror and 
make that same effort right here at 
home. 
I hear so many of my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle talking 
about the importance of democracy 
around the world, but when it comes to 
granting the people in the District of 
Columbia the full rights of a democ-
racy—the right to two votes in the 
Senate and a vote in the House—they 
are not there. 
The people of the District of Colum-
bia are fed up and tired of the hypoc-
risy. They are even more fed up about 
what my friend and colleague, the Sen-
ator from Virginia, was just talking 
about—the fact that they contribute in 
every way to our country but are de-
nied the right to have voting represen-
tation in the House and the Senate. 
As the Senator from Virginia said 
and others have said, a founding prin-
ciple of our revolution was the idea 
that nobody should be subject to tax-
ation without representation. The Sen-
ator from Virginia talked about Pat-
rick Henry, and there are others who 
we know established that principle. 
Here in the Nation’s Capital, the people 
of the District of Columbia pay higher 
taxes than those in 22 other States; yet 
they don’t have a vote in the House or 
two Senators to represent them. 
They have also had people who served 
in every one of our wars, who spilled 
blood for this country. Yet, while they 
helped to protect our democracy from 
threats abroad, they don’t have the 
right here, in our democracy, to cast 
those votes for voting representatives 
in the House and the Senate. 
This is not a partisan issue. We know 
it shouldn’t be. We know that if every 
Member put on a blindfold and just 
said that the people of the District of 
Columbia 
deserve 
a 
vote 
without 
thinking of the political outcome, the 
people of the District of Columbia 
would have a State. 
As others have pointed out, two 
States have smaller populations, but 
they have two Senators who can cast 
votes here in this Chamber. The State 
of Wyoming and the State of Vermont 
are both smaller population-wise than 
the District of Columbia, but they have 
those rights and representatives here 
in the U.S. Senate. 
We should move forward with the 
State of Washington, Douglass Com-
monwealth, and to hear our Republican 
colleagues oppose this idea, since they 
don’t want to take it on the principle 
of democracy—we have heard some ab-
surd reasons given for why the District 
of Columbia should not be a State. 
Here are a few. And if anybody doubts 
that Republican Members in the House 
or Senate have said these things, I will 
be happy to show it to you.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3406 
May 25, 2021 
We have heard from Members of Con-
gress that people of the District of Co-
lumbia don’t deserve statehood because 
it doesn’t have a landfill. We have 
heard that the District of Columbia 
shouldn’t be given statehood because it 
needs more car dealerships. First, they 
said: Well, it can’t be a State because 
it has no car dealerships, but now it 
doesn’t have enough of them. Others 
have said: Well, because it lacks a min-
ing industry, how could it possibly be a 
State? And then most recently, we 
heard that it would be unfair to give 
the people of the District of a Columbia 
a State here because their representa-
tives would have an unfair advantage. 
They would have special superpowers 
because they would be so close to this 
Capitol that they would somehow be 
able to get an unfair leg up on every-
body else here in the U.S. Senate. 
These are reasons that Republican 
House Members and Senators have 
given for denying the people of the Dis-
trict of Columbia the right to state-
hood. We all know what they are. It is 
just a wall of excuses in their trying to 
obfuscate and prevent us from getting 
to the main issue. If you don’t want to 
talk about the principle of democracy, 
change the subject. 
The real concern, as we know, is that 
the people of the District of Columbia 
will cast votes for representatives in 
the House and Senate who they think 
best reflect their interests, and they 
believe that, in the current situation, 
those seats will go to Democratic 
Members in the Senate and the House. 
As my colleagues have said, the Dis-
trict of Columbia is comprised of a ma-
jority of people of color, and the Sen-
ator from Virginia talked about the 
history of that having been an impedi-
ment to the admission of some other 
States in the past before the country 
did the right thing. We have the power 
to do the right thing. 
I have here a letter from 39 constitu-
tional scholars affirming our authority 
to make the District of Columbia the 
51st State. We should do it. 
Frederick Douglass once noted that 
the District of Columbia was ‘‘one spot 
where there is no government for the 
people, of the people, and by the peo-
ple.’’ His words are a call from his-
tory—a call that demands that we re-
flect on this act of selective disenfran-
chisement that has been happening for 
generations and which is still hap-
pening to this day right outside of this 
building right now. Let us change that 
today. Let us change that and make 
this the 51st State and name it in 
honor of Frederick Douglass. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I first 
want to thank my colleague and friend 
Senator CARPER for leading this effort 
with S. 51, the Washington, D.C. Ad-
mission Act. It is long overdue that we 
acknowledge an injustice in our coun-
try and give the citizens of the District 
of Columbia their full representation 
rights by statehood. 
I have been working on this issue for 
a long time. When I was the speaker of 
the Maryland General Assembly almost 
40 years ago, the Maryland General As-
sembly took action to give full rep-
resentation to the people of the Dis-
trict in the Congress of the United 
States. That was 40 years ago, and we 
are still working on this issue. It is 
long overdue that we acknowledge a 
shortcoming in our own system for 
700,000 residents of the District of Co-
lumbia. 
I had the honor of chairing the U.S. 
Helsinki Commission. It is the imple-
menting arm for the Helsinki Final Act 
of the Organization for Security and 
Cooperation in Europe. It has the mem-
bership of all of the countries of Eu-
rope and the former Soviet Union, Cen-
tral Asia, Canada, and the United 
States. I mention that because in 1975, 
those countries entered into an agree-
ment on basic, fundamental demo-
cratic principles, including the right to 
have representative government. 
That document also gives us the op-
portunity and obligation to question 
whether member states are in compli-
ance with the Helsinki Final Act. Quite 
frankly, we have used that opportunity 
to raise issues in countries. 
Our Presiding Officer has been very 
aggressive in his comments about Rus-
sia, and we have used that to bring up 
the fact that Russia violated the com-
mitments of the Helsinki Final Act 
when it invaded Ukraine and when it 
took over Crimea, and it is still inter-
fering with the sovereignty of Ukraine. 
We have offered our objections when 
Russia’s Government has stepped on 
the human rights of the people of its 
own country—like those of Aleksei 
Navalny’s, the opposition leader, being 
imprisoned and tortured. That is in 
violation of the Helsinki Final Act. We 
have raised those issues. 
We have raised those issues about an-
other member state, Turkey, when 
they have jailed journalists or failed to 
allow civil society an opportunity to be 
heard, for they are violations of the 
Helsinki Final Act. 
For us to have credibility in raising 
these issues of other countries that are 
violating the fundamental principles, 
we have to self-evaluate where we are. 
If we are going to be leaders, we have 
to acknowledge our own shortcomings 
and take steps to eliminate those 
shortcomings. 
Quite frankly, we are an outlier when 
it comes to the representation for the 
people of the District of Columbia. We 
have violated their basic rights. We are 
the only country in the world wherein 
the citizens of its capital do not have 
the opportunity to vote for representa-
tives in the national legislature. That 
is not a distinction that we want to 
have. 
The 700,000 people who live in the 
District are being denied representa-
tion in their government. As has been 
pointed out, it is larger than some of 
our States. Those States have fewer 
people but have two U.S. Senators and 
a Member of the House of Representa-
tives, and the people of the District 
should be likewise treated. 
This is not a matter of politics; this 
is a matter of fundamental rights. 
America’s strength is in our values, in 
who we are as a people. Our ability to 
lead globally depends upon our doing 
the right thing at home. 
We need to give the District of Co-
lumbia that status. The House has al-
ready done this. It passed H.R. 51. It 
has done this and has given the bill to 
us. All we need to do now is take it up 
and pass it. So let us act now, at long 
last, and do what is right for the people 
of the District and do what is right for 
the people of our Nation by correcting 
this violation that we have in our sys-
tem. Let’s pass S. 51, led by Senator 
CARPER, for DC statehood and make 
sure that America continues to lead in 
democratic values around the world. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Indiana. 
Mr. YOUNG. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to complete my re-
marks before any rollcall votes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
S. 1260 
Mr. YOUNG. Mr. President, this week 
is Indy 500 Week in the State of Indi-
ana. For these 7 days, Hoosiers will be 
swept up in the pageantry and the tra-
dition of the Greatest Spectacle in 
Racing. Every minute this week is 
leading toward the moment when the 
white flag comes out, signifying the 
final lap, when the drivers make one 
last push toward the finish line. 
I couldn’t help but think about this 
annual tradition as we enter the home 
stretch on the Endless Frontier Act in 
the coming days. The legislation has 
evolved and improved and grown over 
the last few months. We now know it as 
the U.S. Innovation and Competition 
Act, but as we head into this week, I 
thought it important to reset and 
refocus on why we began this journey 
in the first place. 
For me, it began back in 2019, in the 
gym of all places, where one morning, 
Senator SCHUMER and I began talking 
about the need to go on offense against 
the Chinese Communist Party. Since 
the Cold War, Beijing has aimed to 
overtake America, not with weapons 
but through innovation, through eco-
nomic growth. Through Made in China 
2025, Beijing set out with a deliberate 
plan to dominate the world through 
strategic investments and emerging 
technologies, all of which have the po-
tential to fundamentally change this 
century’s economic and security envi-
ronment for good or for ill. 
Until now, we have primarily focused 
on 
defensive 
countermeasures 
to 
thwart aggression by the Chinese Com-
munist Party: blocking Huawei, impos-
ing export controls, and improving for-
eign investment rules. Look, these pri-
orities are really important, and they 
must remain part of the mix, but if

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3407 
May 25, 2021 
America is to lead the world in the 21st 
century, it is neither realistic nor prac-
tical to build an economic iron curtain 
around China. You see, just as we did 
in the 20th century, we must not sim-
ply contain our leading global compet-
itor but, instead, outinnovate and out-
grow it. We must go on offense. 
The Endless Frontier Act was and is 
our effort to do just that, to make the 
kinds of research and science invest-
ments we haven’t made for decades. We 
are creating a new Technology Direc-
torate at the National Science Founda-
tion and creating regional tech hubs to 
ensure we are leveraging the talents 
and abilities of Americans across the 
country, with the corresponding eco-
nomic benefits reaching those in the 
heart of our country, not just those on 
the coasts. 
This legislation will be a boost to our 
economy, but make no mistake—it is 
not just about the economy. This is 
about deciding which standards, which 
values are going to animate these new 
technologies in the future: the values 
we see cracking down on protesters in 
the streets of Hong Kong? the values 
that enslave millions of Uighurs in 
Xinjiang? our American values, which 
recognize that all men are created 
equal and are endowed by their Creator 
with certain unalienable rights? 
America is watching, and the free 
world is watching. All who are watch-
ing should be encouraged. You see, this 
body has largely embraced this objec-
tive. We have continued to go through 
the regular Senate order—an increas-
ingly rare accomplishment in this 
body—of allowing each Member to offer 
amendments to improve this legisla-
tion. In fact, it was marked up in the 
Senate Commerce Committee and ap-
proved by a vote of 24 to 4. Last week, 
it came to the Senate floor, and we 
considered more amendments. This 
week, we will consider even more 
amendments. 
As is typically the case in regular 
order, 
nobody 
gets 
everything 
he 
wants, including the bill’s authors. As 
one example, through the markup proc-
ess, less investment than I had origi-
nally proposed will now be provided to 
the NSF Tech Directorate, but that is 
OK. It is OK because this change and 
others are ones I can live with so that 
we can come together and prove that 
our system works while advancing a 
once-in-a-generation 
investment 
in 
science and technology. 
We must send a message to the au-
thoritarians in Beijing. They say we 
are too divided to lead the world in the 
21st century. It is time to come to-
gether and prove them wrong. 
As we Hoosiers say at the Indianap-
olis Motor Speedway, the white flag is 
out. This is the final lap for this bill in 
the U.S. Senate. I look forward to see-
ing this open process through to the 
finish line so that, together, we can 
outcompete, outinnovate, and outgrow 
the Chinese Communist Party. 
I thank the Presiding Officer. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Idaho. 
Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that I and Senator 
WYDEN and Senator SCHUMER may be 
able to complete our remarks before 
the vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
AMENDMENT NO. 1565 
Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise 
today to speak on amendment No. 1565 
to the U.S. Innovation and Competi-
tion Act, or USICA, the underlying 
bill. 
My amendment preserves the con-
stitutional authority of Congress over 
international trade. It does so by en-
suring the President cannot waive or 
modify congressionally approved trade 
agreements, including the WTO Agree-
ment on Trade-Related Aspects of In-
tellectual Property Rights, or TRIPS— 
the TRIPS Agreement. And the reason 
is that the TRIPS Agreement, like the 
USICA, contains provisions that facili-
tate the leadership of the United 
States in scientific and technological 
innovation. 
China is challenging that leadership 
through predatory practices aimed at 
our highest value sectors, including 
our pharmaceutical sector. Plain and 
simple, China wants our intellectual 
property. 
Remarkably, the administration an-
nounced, without consulting Congress, 
that it would support a waiver of U.S. 
intellectual property rights under the 
TRIPS Agreement with respect to vac-
cines. Moreover, the U.S. Trade Rep-
resentative declined to confirm that 
she would oppose letting this waiver 
extend to China. 
Colleagues, there are vaccines pre-
cisely because the innovative U.S. 
firms exist because of strong IP protec-
tions. The problem with access to vac-
cines is not intellectual property. The 
problem is the manufacturing capacity. 
This amendment I am proposing al-
lows the administration to proceed, 
providing it is willing to make the 
case, including by presenting evidence 
and respecting Congress’s authority. 
The outcome is subject to congres-
sional approval, just like the original 
TRIPS Agreement. 
I also demand real consultation with 
Congress. My colleague’s amendment 
provides only that the administration 
will provide relevant proposals and per-
tinent documents to Congress related 
to the final agreement. There is no rea-
son to grant this leeway to the admin-
istration given its existing failure to 
consult with us. 
My amendment requires the adminis-
tration to provide the text of any U.S. 
proposal to Congress 5 business days 
before it is tabled in a trade negotia-
tion, not after it has agreed to amend 
a congressionally approved agreement. 
With respect to that agreement and 
the other WTO agreements, we have 
spoken clearly as a body that the 
United States can withdraw from these 
agreements if, and only if, Congress 
passes a resolution to that effect. 
For example, it requires reports on 
issues central to whether the adminis-
tration’s decision makes sense and pro-
vides for consultation by the adminis-
tration with the public and Congress 
concerning its proposal. This will fa-
cilitate transparency, identify any na-
tional security risks presented by the 
administration’s proposal, and, impor-
tantly, will stop an action that does 
not further vaccine access or present a 
risk to our national security. 
Accordingly, if the administration’s 
proposal is determined by the adminis-
tration’s own Agencies not to present a 
risk to U.S. national security and that 
it positively facilitates vaccine access, 
the administration may continue nego-
tiating and seeking an outcome for a 
waiver. 
It must not be the case that once 
Congress approves a trade agreement, 
the administration can simply with-
draw rights or obligations under a con-
gressionally approved trade agreement 
or alter its terms however it sees fit. 
Yet that is exactly what the adminis-
tration is seeking to do here. 
If we were to accept that proposition, 
what is the point for Congress’s ap-
proving any future trade agreement if 
the administration can simply alter it 
without again coming to Congress to 
make that change? 
This amendment ensures that the ad-
ministration’s proposal will, in fact, 
get a vote by applying fast-track-like 
procedures to its conclusions. It also 
prohibits our IP from going to China or 
Russia. 
I have only one redline, which I sus-
pect all of you share: The administra-
tion may not waive U.S. IP rights 
under the TRIPS Agreement to China 
and Russia. Congress approved the 
entry of these two countries into the 
WTO precisely because we wanted to 
hold them accountable to WTO rules. 
Russia and China are a threat to 
American innovation and the principle 
reason why the USICA is before us on 
the floor of the Senate today. So why 
would we then allow the administra-
tion to legally bless their malfeasance? 
If we must stand together and waive 
the IP rights of Americans, the least 
we can do is insist that China and Rus-
sia, which tout the successes of their 
own vaccines, not be allowed to take 
hard-earned U.S. technology. 
This concern is particularly valid 
since the Chinese Government is ac-
tively trying to steal mRNA tech-
nology, and its efforts to develop such 
technology is led, in fact, by an arm of 
the Chinese military. 
USICA is a sincere, bipartisan effort 
to promote American innovation in the 
face of China’s predations. My amend-
ment complements that effort and 
must likewise be considered. 
I encourage all of my Democrat and 
Republican colleagues to support it.

ator from Oregon. 
AMENDMENT NO. 1975

leagues, Senator CRAPO
has brought 
forward an amendment to the competi-
tion bill. It deals with the Biden ad-

May 25, 2021 
would participate in negotiations on 
intellectual 
property 
and 
the 
coronavirus vaccines. 
Unfortunately, my friend’s amend-
ment also goes far beyond the current 
pandemic and adds roadblocks to any 
improvements 
to 
any 
other 
trade 
agreements into the future. So I must 
oppose Senator CRAPO’s amendment. 
I am offering an alternative, which 
the Senate will also vote on shortly. 
The fact is that even though COVID is 
receding in many American commu-
nities, the virus will still be a danger 
to Americans as long as there are out-
breaks 
and 
mutations 
around 
the 
world. 
That is a big reason why the Biden 
administration is working overtime to 
increase vaccine production and dis-
tribution as quickly as possible in our 
country and around the world. It is 
also why the administration announced 
its intention to participate in negotia-
tions over the vaccine IP waivers. The 
U.S. Trade Representative will be in 
charge of our participation in those ne-
gotiations. 
Again, 
unfortunately, 
the 
Crapo 
amendment would tie up our U.S. 
Trade Representative in bureaucratic 
redtape and reporting for many months 
before she could speak to any of our 
trading partners about the issue. 
Ambassador Tai and the Biden ad-
ministration recognize that the TRIPS 
waiver is not going to end the pan-
demic overnight. However, the Amer-
ican people and countries around the 
world cannot afford the delay that the 
Crapo amendment would cause. 
The Crapo amendment puts the U.S. 
Trade 
Representative 
into 
what 
amounts to a straitjacket, making it 
hard—if not impossible—to negotiate 
fixes or modifications to any trade 
agreement, for any reason. It would 
make the process for modifying an 
agreement more difficult than getting 
into that agreement in the first place. 
That is a big roadblock to improve-
ments that could raise standards for 
workers and the environment. 
I will close by mentioning that I have 
filed an alternative, amendment 1975. 
My 
amendment 
guarantees 
trans-
parency and consultations throughout 
the negotiations. It makes clear that 
the United States must promote global 
access to vaccines, all while safe-
guarding our IP from hostile foreign 
powers and protecting American inno-
vation. 
So here is the bottom line: It is not 
only possible, it is absolutely essential 
for our system to include strong intel-
lectual property protections, as well as 
exceptions to promote the common 
good at the same time. 
My amendment strikes the right bal-
ance. The Crapo amendment just goes 
too far in the direction of blocking the 
administration from using all available 
tools to fight the pandemic and to 
make improvements to any other trade 
agreements. 
For that reason, I urge Senators to 
support my amendment, 1975. I urge 
my colleagues to oppose my friend’s 
amendment, the Crapo amendment, 
and that will be the next vote. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that all votes after 
the first be 10 minutes in length, and 
we are going to try to stick to it as 
best we can. So please, Members, we 
are trying to finish. We have six votes. 
We are trying to get them done. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under

prior to the vote in relation to the 
Paul amendment No. 2003. 
The Senator from Kentucky. 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, we may 
never know whether the pandemic 
arose from the lab in Wuhan, but we do 
know that so far no intermediate ani-
mal host has been discovered. Thou-
sands of animals at the wet market 
have been looked at. None of them 
have carried COVID–19. We have tried 
to infect COVID–19 into bats. It doesn’t 
grow well in bats. It seems most adapt-
ed and suitable for humans. We may 
not know whether this ever arose out 
of a Wuhan lab, but I think gain-of- 
function research, where we take a 
deadly virus, sometimes much more 
deadly than COVID, and then we in-
crease its transmissibility to mammals 
is wrong. 
In 2014, NIH stopped all of this re-
search. I am using the same definition 
to say any gain-of-function research 
should not be funded in China with 
U.S. taxpayer dollars. I recommend a 
‘‘yes’’ vote. 
VOTE ON AMENDMENT NO. 2003 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to vitiate the 60- 
vote requirement for this amendment 
and yield back time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
All time is yielded back. 
The question is on agreeing to the 
amendment. 
It seems as if the ayes have it. 
(Applause.) 
The amendment (No. 2003) was agreed 
to. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Let’s hear it for 
RAND PAUL for passing an amendment 
unanimously. 
AMENDMENT NO. 1507 TO AMENDMENT NO. 1502 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, there will now be 2 
minutes of debate, equally divided, on 
the Ernst amendment No. 1507. 
The Senator from Iowa. 
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, for years 
prior to the COVID pandemic, U.S. tax-
payer dollars were being funneled into 
Communist China’s state-run Wuhan 
Institute of Virology. 
After COVID appeared in the vicinity 
of the Wuhan Institute, instead of co-
operating with efforts to discover the 
source of the outbreak, Chinese offi-
cials instead ordered the destruction of 
some of the coronavirus samples and 
blocked access to the lab. 
China continues to obstruct inter-
national efforts to discover the origins 
of COVID, refusing to allow inde-
pendent scientists to review the data-
base of coronaviruses that were being 
studied in the Wuhan Institute. 
Providing additional U.S. funds to 
subsidize any state-run lab in China, 
especially the Wuhan Institute of Vi-
rology, goes against the very purpose 
of the underlying bill, which is to sup-
port more research in the United 
States to better compete with China. 
My amendment would assure that 
not another dime of taxpayer dollars 
goes to subsidizing Communist China. 
With that, I yield. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
VCOTE ON AMENDMENT NO. 1507 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to vitiate the 60- 
vote requirement for this amendment, 
and I yield back time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
All time is yielded back. 
The question is on agreeing to the 
amendment. 
The amendment (No. 1507) was agreed 
to. 
(Applause.) 
AMENDMENT NO. 1787 TO AMENDMENT NO. 1502 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, there will be 2 min-
utes of debate, equally divided, prior to 
the consideration of the Daines amend-
ment No. 1787. 
Senator DAINES. 
Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, this 
amendment is called the Protecting IP 
Act. It is a bipartisan amendment that 
will help increase enforcement of the 
United States and China phase one 
trade deal. 
This deal put in place important pro-
tections 
for 
America’s 
intellectual 
property, 
the 
research 
inventions, 
copyrights, and more. 
China has been a notorious and serial 
abuser of American intellectual prop-
erty for decades, and that is why the 
phase one deal put in place a number of 
important safeguards. Unfortunately, 
China has not lived up to their end of 
the deal. It is critical that we hold 
China accountable for its commit-
ments. 
As we debate increasing investment 
in advanced research, we cannot look 
the other way and allow China to con-
tinue to steal American intellectual 
property. That is why I introduced this 
bipartisan Protecting IP amendment 
with Senator CORTEZ MASTO, to ensure 
the President and the USTR uses all 
available tools to enforce the phase one 
agreement. 
We are in a race against China and 
must 
remain 
globally 
competitive. 
That is why I urge my colleagues to 
support this commonsense and bipar-
tisan agreement. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
VOTE ON AMENDMENT NO. 1787 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to vitiate the 60- 
vote requirement for this amendment 
and yield back all time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
All time is yielded back. 
The question is on agreeing to the 
amendment. 
The amendment (No. 1787) was agreed 
to. 
AMENDMENT NO. 1891 TO AMENDMENT NO. 1502 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, there will now be 2 
minutes of debate, equally divided, 
prior to the vote in relation to the Lee 
amendment No. 1891. 
The Senator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unani-
mous consent to speak up to 2 minutes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, all human 
lives from conception to natural birth 
have innate, immeasurable dignity and 
worth. They are not play things. They 
are not mere objects for scientific ex-
perimentation. 
Experiments that use aborted fetal 
tissue and practices that create and de-
stroy human embryos or human lives 
in their earliest stages of development 
flatly deny that truth. Unfortunately, 
our 
own 
tax 
dollars 
sometimes 
incentivize experiments of this very 
kind. And the bill before us provides no 
exceptions, no protections to prevent 
it. 
The Endless Frontier Act includes 
over $80 billion of authorized funding 
for key areas of biotechnology, medical 
technology, genomics, and synthetic 
biology without any ethical guardrails 
or protections for the earliest stages of 
life. 
Many Americans do not want to see 
their taxpayer dollars used to destroy, 
experiment on, or unethically alter 
human life, and they shouldn’t be 
forced to do so. 
Now, thankfully, there are some of 
these protections in annual appropria-
tions measures that go through the De-
partment of Health and Human Serv-
ices. And they have been there for dec-
ades, but because this bill expands re-
search at the NSF, the Department of 
Commerce, and the Office of Science 
and Technology, which are funded 
through a different appropriations bill 
through CJS, the HHS riders do not 
apply. 
That is why I am offering this 
amendment, which would simply pro-
hibit any research funded through the 
Endless Frontier Act from using fetal 
tissue obtained from an abortion and 
creating, destroying, discarding or put-
ting human embryos at risk. 
While the NSF currently has an 
Agency policy that bans research in 
which a human embryo is created or 
destroyed, this would codify that. We 
need it to codify that. We need this to 
be consistent with what we do else-
where to protect the sanctity of human 
life. 
Look, human lives at every stage are 
too precious to tinker with. Our re-
search and laws should uphold this 
truth. This amendment would help en-
sure permanent protections to do pre-
cisely that. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, this 
bill is an important opportunity for 
Congress to put partisanship aside and 
help families in our country by boost-
ing American competitiveness. This 
means making sure American research 
is guided by science, not by ideology. 
Unfortunately, with this amendment, 
the Senator is doing the exact oppo-
site. This amendment says, loud and

clear, that even during a pandemic, 
supporters will put ideology ahead of 
science and ahead of patients’ health 
and gladly undermine the same type of 
research 
that 
helped 
develop 
new 
therapies for COVID–19. 
This is an irresponsible, ideological 
attack on science and medical re-
search. And it not only undermines 
doctors and researchers and patients’ 
healthcare, it also undermines the goal 
of this whole bill, which is to boost 
American innovation and competitive-
ness. I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 1520 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I 
rise tonight to once again call for this 
entire body to have the opportunity to 
consider the Military Justice Improve-
ment and Increasing Prevention Act. 
This would ensure that people in the 
military who have been subjected to 
sexual assault and other serious crimes 
get the justice they deserve. 
I first introduced this legislation in 
2013. Since then, the committee has 
had 8 years to consider it, to ask ques-
tions, to pursue changes, and to imple-
ment alternative solutions, and we 
have. In fact, over the period of 15 
years, the committee enacted nearly 
250 legislative provisions designed to 
address the scourge of sexual assault in 
the military. We have modified data re-
porting requirements. We have added 
questions to surveys. We have required 
annual reports on the status of sex of-
fense investigations. We have required 
developments of strategies to hold 
leadership accountable. We have char-
tered special panels, commissions, and 
advisory committees to address this 
problem, and we have enacted their 
recommendations. 
We have made scores of small adjust-
ments, and they have just not moved 
the needle. The most recent annual re-
port from the Department of Defense 
proves it. Reports of sexual assault 
have increased virtually every single 
year and remain at record highs, while 
prosecution and conviction rates have 
declined. The current system is not 
working. We need real reform, and we 
have the legislation to do it. 
In 2014, I asked for a vote on this bill, 
and it earned majority support—55 
votes—but it was filibustered. In 2015, 
again I earned majority support, but it 
was filibustered. I asked for a vote in 
2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020, and I was 
denied every single time. 
I am again asking on behalf of serv-
icemembers who do so much for this 
country, who will sacrifice themselves 
and their lives for this Nation, and on 
behalf of the bipartisan, filibuster- 
proof majority of Senators who support 
this legislation and want to enact this 
reform, and this vote is being denied 
again. 
How long must our servicemembers 
wait for real reform? How long must 
they wait for a criminal justice system 
that is worthy of their sacrifice? There 
is no persuasive argument for the need 
to allow more time to consider this leg-
islation in committee. The committee 
has had nearly a decade to consider it. 
Most Members of this body have had 
years to consider it, and those who 
have had the least time to consider it, 
our newest Members, have already seen 
the need for reform. Nine out of ten 
new Senators, Republicans and Demo-
crats alike, including the two new 
members of the Armed Services Com-
mittee, have already cosponsored this 
bill. 
This bill is now supported by 64 bi-
partisan Senators who deserve to have 
the opportunity to cast a vote for this 
important bill. We don’t have to take 
the time for another incremental step. 
It is time to bring this vote to the 
floor. 
I ask unanimous consent that, at a 
time to be determined by the majority 
leader, in consultation with the Repub-
lican leader, the Senate Armed Serv-
ices Committee be discharged from fur-
ther consideration of S. 1520 and the 
Senate proceed to its consideration; 
that there be 2 hours for debate equally 
divided in the usual form; and that 
upon the use or yielding back of time, 
the Senate vote on the bill with no in-
tervening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, for the rea-
sons that I articulated last evening, I 
object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
The Senator from New York. 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I 
continue to advocate for the ability of 
this body to vote up or down on this 
bill. This is an important moment in 
our Nation’s history. This is a genera-
tional change whose time has come. 
Previously, when such important re-
forms were needed, such as the don’t 
ask, 
don’t 
tell 
repeal, 
they 
were 
brought directly to the floor. It is time 
to bring this to the floor. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I ask

the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered.

RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE 1921 TULSA RACE 
MASSACRE 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 
234, submitted earlier today. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The clerk will report the resolution 
by title. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A resolution (S. Res. 234) recognizing the 
100th Anniversary of the 1921 Tulsa Race 
Massacre. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the resolution. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I 
know of no further debate on the reso-
lution. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
further debate? 
Hearing none, the question is on 
adoption of the resolution. 
The resolution (S. Res. 234) was 
agreed to. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the preamble 
be agreed to and the motions to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon 
the table with no intervening action or 
debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The preamble was agreed to.

mitted Resolutions.’’)

S3411 
May 25, 2021 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, next 
week is a summer anniversary, 100 
years since the Tulsa massacre. Before 
1921, Greenwood District, also known 
as Black Wall Street, was a vibrant, 
thriving, prosperous Black community. 
But then, on the evening of May 31 into 
the early morning of June 1, 1921, there 
was a horrific massacre where hun-
dreds of Black Tulsans were murdered 
and thousands were made homeless 
overnight. It was awful. 
But as terrible as it was, that is why 
it is important to come together to 
honor the victims and their families 
and share their stories today with fu-
ture generations. I am honored to co-
sponsor Senator LANKFORD’s resolution 
today to remember this anniversary. 
Together, we can all work to lift up 
the story of Black Wall Street and use 
this anniversary to remember, reflect, 
and work, as we do every day, toward 
reconciliation. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, Sen-
ator INHOFE and I and this body have 
just passed by voice vote a resolution 
recognizing the 100th anniversary of 
the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre. It is a 
significant resolution not only to be 
able to recall what happened in that 
terrible time in 1921 but to also recog-
nize the 13 Black towns that still re-
main in Oklahoma. 
It is an interesting history that we 
have in Oklahoma, and I encourage 
folks to be able to find out more about 
us as a State. From the late 1800s to 
the early 1900s, Black individuals and 
families from all over the South were 
fleeing away from where they were 
being oppressed, and they were coming 
to Oklahoma, setting up vibrant com-
munities. Over 50 all-Black towns rose 
up in Oklahoma. 
In fact, there was some dialogue in 
the early 1900s about possibly having 
Oklahoma be an all-Black State even. 
These Black communities were rising 
up around our State looking for oppor-
tunities, freedom, and a chance for a 
better life. Thirteen of those fifty 
towns still remain today as commu-
nities. Many of the individuals in these 
towns are friends and people whom I 
know and Senator INHOFE and I have 
the honor of being able to represent in 
this great body. 
I think about Dr. Donnie Nero, Sr. He 
is the President of the African Amer-
ican Educators Hall of Fame. He is the 
one who helped found and pull this all 
together. He has an attitude in wonder-
ful Clearview, OK, and he says: ‘‘One of 
the greatest motivational concepts ac-
cessible to mankind is ‘Recognition.’’’ 
He says recognition is about remem-
brance and acknowledgment. 
We are taking a moment as a Senate 
today to be able to acknowledge these 
13 Black towns that still remain in 
Oklahoma and to be able to look at 
some of the history of what happened 
during that time period. So let me 
walk through this somewhat. 
Tullahassee was founded in 1883. It is 
regarded as one of the oldest surviving 
historically Black towns in Indian Ter-
ritory. 
Langston, founded in 1890, and was 
named after John Mercer Langston, an 
African-American educator and U.S. 
Representative from Virginia. Seven 
years later, the Oklahoma Territorial 
Legislature established the Colored Ag-
ricultural 
and 
Normal 
University, 
which would later be called Langston 
University. This historically Black col-
lege and university has grown from 41 
students in 1897 to over 3,000 students 
today. Prominent Oklahomans such as 
Melvin Tolson, Ada Lois Sipuel Fisher, 
Clara Luper, E. Melvin Porter, Fred-
erick Moon, Marques Haynes, Zelia 
Breaux, Isaac W. Young, Inman Page, 
and Zella Black Patterson all resided 
in the town of Langston or called 
Langston University home. 
Tatums was founded in 1895. It was 
named after brothers Lee B. Tatum and 
Eldridge ‘‘Doc’’ Tatum. They found 
prosperity in 1929 when oil wells were 
drilled in Tatum. Norman Studios even 
filmed a silent movie called ‘‘Black 
Gold,’’ using the brothers in their film. 
Taft was founded in 1902 on land al-
lotted 
to 
Creek 
Freedman. 
They 
changed their name from Twine, which 
they were originally, to Taft to honor 
the then Secretary of War and later 
President William Howard Taft. 
Grayson was bustling with five gen-
eral stores, two blacksmiths, two drug 
stores, a cotton gin and a physician 
shortly after it was founded in 1902. It 
was originally known as Wildcat. It 
was changed in 1909 to honor the Creek 
chief, George W. Grayson. 
Boley was a town established in 1903 
and named after J.B. Boley, a railroad 
official of the Fort Smith and Western 
Railway, and grew to be the largest Af-
rican-American town in Oklahoma. 
Only 5 years after being founded, Book-
er T. Washington visited the town and 
wrote about the prosperity that he had 
witnessed. Boasting the first Black- 
owned bank, the First National Bank 
of Boley was owned by D.J. Turner. It 
received a national charter and rose to 
be one of the largest and wealthiest ex-
clusively Black communities. Today, 
Boley still hosts the Nation’s oldest 
annual Black rodeo. 
Rentiesville, founded in 1903, was de-
veloped on 40 acres owned by William 
Rentie and Phoebe McIntosh. The Mis-
souri, Kansas and Texas Railway devel-
oped a flag stop, putting Rentiesville 
on the map. John Hope Franklin, a 
scholar of African-American history 
who promoted dialogue that reshaped 
American views on race relations, was 
born in Rentiesville in 1915. The Frank-
lins later moved to Tulsa, where John 
Hope Franklin graduated from Booker 
T. Washington. He survived the 1921 
Tulsa Race Massacre, and he went on 
to become one of the most decorated 
historians. He inspired the John Hope 
Franklin Center for Reconciliation, 
Reconciliation Park in Tulsa, and an 
elementary school in North Tulsa. 
Rentiesville continues to host the 
Dusk Til’ Dawn Blues Festival that at-
tracts blues artists and all the folks 
who come in. 
Clearview, a town I have already 
mentioned, was founded in 1903 along 
the tracks of the Fort Smith and West-
ern Railroad, was widely known for its 
baseball team, but it is widely known 
now for the Hall of Fame for Black 
Educators. It is a place that I would 
encourage people to be able to stop in 
and to be able to see. And it is an an-
nual tradition where individuals from 
around the State ride in to be able to 
recognize Black educators to be recog-
nized that year in the Hall of Fame 
ceremony led by Dr. Nero, Sr. 
Brooksville, founded in 1903, origi-
nally named Sewell, was renamed in 
1912 in honor of the first African Amer-
ican in the area, A.R. Brooks. 
Red Bird, founded in 1907 along the 
Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railroad, 
was built on the land allotted by the 
Creek Nation. E.L. Barber was one of 
the town’s original developers and the 
first justice of the peace and an early 
mayor. Before Red Bird officially be-
came a town, Barber organized the 
First Baptist Church in 1889, which 
grew to be the largest church in Red 
Bird. 
Summit was founded in 1910 along 
the Missouri, Kansas and Texas Rail-
way. 
Vernon was founded in 1911 on Tan-
kard Ranch in the Creek Nation and 
was home to many trailblazers such as 
Ella Woods, who was the first Post-
master, and Louise Wesley, who estab-
lished the first school and church. 
Lima, founded in 1913 along the Chi-
cago, Rock Island, and Pacific Rail-
road. 
The 
Mount 
Zion 
Methodist 
Church was built in 1915 and still 
stands to this day. 
And, of course, the most famous and 
prosperous of all of the Black commu-
nities was Greenwood. Greenwood Dis-
trict became a thriving community 
where Black business owners, schools, 
and churches flourished. By the late 
1910s, it was the wealthiest Black com-
munity in all of the United States. The 
community earned the name ‘‘Black 
Wall Street’’ from the famed African- 
American author and educator I al-
ready spoke of, Booker T. Washington. 
The history of these historically 
Black towns is interwoven into the his-
tory of Oklahoma and the history of 
the United States. The residents of 
these towns have achieved great suc-
cess and faced tremendous challenges. 
The stories of these Black towns and 
communities in Oklahoma are also in-
extricably linked to the events of May 
30 through June 1 of 1921, when the 
Greenwood District in North Tulsa 
burst into flames. 
An important part of history is 
learning from the past. It is not look-
ing at an incident in isolation. It is 
what came before and after. This week-
end, the Nation will pause and reflect 
on the 100th anniversary of the 1921 
Tulsa Race Massacre, the worst race

massacre in the history of the United 
States. 
But we can’t look at Greenwood as if 
it was a single weekend. It was a pros-
perous, thriving Black community. 
And it still has a history to be able to 
share in our future. 
Maybe you have heard me share the 
story on the floor of the Senate before. 
In the past several years, I talked 
about the race massacre, here in com-
mittee meetings and in conversations 
around this body. There is a signifi-
cance of the 100th anniversary, not just 
for Tulsa and my State, but for the rest 
of the Nation as well. So let me re-
count this again. 
On May 30, 1921, a young Black man 
named Dick Rowland was in downtown 
Tulsa. He entered the Drexel Building 
to use the only bathroom in the area 
that was available for Black people to 
be able to use in downtown Tulsa. 
An incident occurred in the elevator 
between 
Dick 
Rowland 
and 
Sarah 
Paige, and Sarah Paige screamed. We 
really 
don’t 
know 
what 
happened 
there, but as the doors opened, she 
screamed. The police did an investiga-
tion and the next day they went to 
Dick Rowland and they detained him 
at the Tulsa Police Department for 
questioning before removing him to the 
Tulsa Courthouse to be able to be con-
fined. 
On May 31, 1921, the Tulsa Tribune 
released a sensationalist story claim-
ing that a young Black man had at-
tacked a White girl in an elevator in 
the Drexel Building. That story and 
long, simmering tensions in the city 
led to a large group of White individ-
uals surrounding the courthouse to de-
mand that Dick Rowland be released so 
he could be lynched. 
A group of Black men traveled to the 
courthouse to help defend Dick Row-
land from the angry mob, many of 
them veterans from World War I who 
had served honorably there. 
After a scuffle at the downtown 
Tulsa courthouse, White rioters pur-
sued the men back to the Greenwood 
District and the violence escalated dra-
matically. Literally, as the violence in-
creased, the White rioters that really 
became a mob were deputized to be 
able to handle the issues in Greenwood. 
They gathered firearms as they ran the 
few blocks from central downtown 
Tulsa into Greenwood just north of 
Tulsa. 
Houses and businesses were burned 
and looted throughout the Greenwood 
District, and the attacks lasted well 
into the night and well into the next 
day before being quelled by the Okla-
homa City National Guard. In less than 
24 hours, 35 city blocks were destroyed 
by fires, 6,000 African American indi-
viduals were detained, and up to 300 
lives were lost. 
Out of the 23 churches that were lo-
cated in the Greenwood area prior to 
the 1921 massacre, only 13 of the 
churches 
survived 
and 
only 
three 
churches were able to be rebuilt after 
being 
destroyed—Paradise 
Baptist 
Church, Mount Zion Baptist Church, 
and Vernon AME Church. 
It was a horrific day, and 100 years 
later, the residents and businesses in 
the Greenwood District still carry on 
the legacy of resilience and determina-
tion. 
For the past few years, I have been 
working to tell this story. For some— 
even some Oklahomans—it is a story 
that they had not heard before. Five 
years ago, I started telling the story in 
Washington, DC, and when I told it, 
hardly anyone knew about it. Now ev-
eryone I speak to is familiar with the 
story. 
We have pulled this story out of the 
dark ages of history and lifted it up for 
our Nation to be able to see and our 
Nation is looking at it. In Oklahoma, 
many people now know about that ter-
rible 2-day period when rioters set a 
community on fire and set our Nation 
back. But I also tell people that you 
can’t understand Tulsa and Oklahoma 
unless you understand May 31 and June 
1 of 1921. 
So I worked to develop a curriculum 
to ensure future generations of Oklaho-
mans 
learn 
the 
accurate 
historic 
events of 1921. Before we started work-
ing on the curriculum, our schools had 
a mandate to teach the 1921 massacre. 
But there were no materials to actu-
ally use to teach that accurate history. 
There were no visuals. There was no 
curriculum. Now there are. We pulled 
all those together and made that re-
source free to every educator in Okla-
homa and every educator in America 
that wants to be able to teach that his-
tory accurately. 
During this same time period, 5 or 6 
years ago, I started working on some-
thing I called Solution Sundays, be-
cause when I started speaking about 6 
years ago now to individuals all around 
Tulsa and around the State about the 
Tulsa Race Massacre, I usually started 
the conversation the same way: May 31 
and June 1 of 2021, I would say, about 6 
years ago, the entire country is going 
to pause. I don’t know how long. They 
may pause for a minute. They may 
pause for an hour. They may pause for 
a day or for a weekend. 
But the entire country will pause and 
will look at Tulsa and look at Okla-
homa and will ask themselves one 
question: What has changed in America 
in race relations in the last 100 years? 
I said 6 years ago, that is a fair ques-
tion for someone to ask; we had better 
be able to answer it when May 31 of 
2021 comes. 
Little did I know 6 years ago, when I 
started asking that question and con-
tinued to ask that question when it 
was 5 years, 4 years, 3 years, 2 years, 
and the next year—little did I know— 
about the events dealing with race that 
would happen in the last 12 months and 
the awakening that in the Nation real-
ly has happened to what is still left un-
done in the issue of race in America. 
I started something about 6 years 
ago. At this same time, I started ask-
ing about what would we say. I started 
challenging families with something I 
called Solution Sundays. It is a simple 
idea, quite frankly. I would just ask 
people that I would encounter, of all 
races, of all backgrounds, a simple 
question: Has your family ever invited 
a family of another race to your home 
for dinner? 
I thought it was simple until, when I 
would ask people, I would get the same 
answer back. I would ask people: Has 
your family ever invited a family of 
another race to your home for dinner? 
And the most common answer I got 
back was: I have friends of another 
race. 
To which I would always smile and 
say: That is not what I asked. I asked: 
Has your family ever invited a family 
of another race to your home for din-
ner? 
And what I found in my State was 
that most individuals of every race all 
answered it the same way: That has 
never happened in my house. 
So I would ask them a simple ques-
tion. A national conversation about 
race is not something that happens on 
TV. A national conversation on race 
happens at our dinner tables with our 
families. 
We should not expect that the Nation 
will speak on race when our families 
are not. And the best way for our fami-
lies and to show our kids that this is 
normal conversation is to have a fam-
ily over of another race to sit around 
the table. 
What I like to say to people is, we 
will never get all the issues of race on 
the table until we get our feet under 
the same table and just talk and just 
get to know each other as friends. The 
Nation will not shift on race relations 
until each of our families shifts on race 
relations. 
I continue to be able to challenge 
this simple concept of Solution Sun-
days. By the way, if you want to pick 
a different day, that is fine with me. 
But Sunday seems to be a pretty good 
day just to invite someone over for din-
ner or for lunch. 
In just a few days, people from all 
over the country will fly into Tulsa, 
some of them for the first time. They 
are going to participate in events to 
commemorate the hundredth anniver-
sary. It is my hope that what they see 
will be a model of reconciliation for 
the rest of the country. But after the 
anniversary passes and the crowds 
leave and the national folks will go on 
to doing something else, we will still be 
around. Tulsa and all of Oklahoma will 
still need to finish the work that has 
begun on race. 
I will still be around North Tulsa. I 
have lots of friends there. And I know 
there will be an ongoing dialogue, still, 
about reconciliation because the big 
event that the whole world turns the 
television cameras on for doesn’t solve 
the issues of race. We solve that as in-
dividuals and as a family. 
You see, I believe, like many do, that 
I have a calling toward reconciliation. 
As a follower of Jesus, as I read

through the New Testament, I bump 
into passages like Second Corinthians, 
chapter 5, where Paul wrote to us and 
said we have the ministry and the mes-
sage of reconciliation. 
Now, I understand that Paul first 
meant that was an ability to be able to 
come to God and be reconciled to God. 
And I do believe firmly that every indi-
vidual can be reconciled with God, and 
I am glad to share that message of 
ministry. But I also believe it is a chal-
lenge to each of us to work toward rec-
onciliation. Where relationships are 
broken, we are the reconcilers, and we 
have a ministry and a message of rec-
onciliation. 
My friend Robert Turner is the pas-
tor of Vernon A.M.E. Church, in the 
heart of Greenwood. He and I were vis-
iting last week on the phone, talking 
through the things coming up in the 
days ahead. As I was chitchatting with 
my friend, he said: I have to tell you 
about my sermon that I preached a 
couple of weeks ago. 
So I said: Tell me all about it. 
Pastor Turner said: I preached on 
Matthew, the tax collector, also called 
Levi. 
And we spent some time talking 
about that. 
And he said: What I told my con-
gregation was that Jesus called Mat-
thew, the tax collector, to be one of his 
disciples, but he also called Simon the 
Zealot to be one of his disciples. 
Now, you may not know, but the tax 
collectors were loyal to the Romans. 
They were Jews who were loyal to the 
Roman authority, and the zealots were 
Jews who were adamantly opposed to 
the Roman authority. So, literally, 
Jesus grabbed two people from opposite 
political perspectives—opposite, if I 
can say it, political parties—and he 
grabbed both of them and said: I want 
you to be my disciple. 
And Pastor Turner said: There is a 
lot that we can learn from Jesus, be-
ginning with what Jesus said: Every-
one is welcome, from every political 
perspective, to come and follow Him. 
Pastor Turner, you are spot on. My 
friend, keep preaching it. But excuse 
me for noticing, Jesus is the one who 
set the example, and he called all of us 
to be able to follow it. 
Now, I have to tell you, Pastor Tur-
ner and I don’t agree on everything. We 
may not even vote alike, though, hon-
estly, I have never asked him how he 
votes. But he is my friend, and he is 
my partner of reconciliation. 
For 6 years, I have asked people 
across Oklahoma, when May the 31st 
comes and the Nation stops and asks, 
‘‘What has changed in the last 100 
years?’’ We should be prepared to an-
swer. That weekend is here, and each of 
us should be able to answer that for our 
lives and for our families. 
Let’s finish the work. We are not 
done on racial reconciliation. Let’s fin-
ish the work, starting with our own 
families, our own communities, and 
our own lives. 
God help us to carry on the ministry 
and the message of reconciliation. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
f 
ENDLESS FRONTIER ACT— 
Continued 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. HAS-
SAN). The Senator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam Presi-
dent, before I begin, let me just say a 
word of thanks to my two colleagues 
from Oklahoma for this moment that 
we have had on the Senate floor. 
I was privileged to be waiting to give 
my remarks to hear them speak, and I 
thought this was a wonderful moment. 
We have our challenges around here, 
but if we had more moments like this, 
we would get through our challenges 
better. I congratulate and thank both 
of my colleagues. 
U.S. SUPREME COURT 
Madam President, there is a scheme 
afoot, a scheme I will be talking about 
in weeks ahead—a long-running, right-
wing scheme to capture the Supreme 
Court. 
Special interests are behind the 
scheme. They control it through dark 
money—hundreds of millions of dollars 
in anonymous hidden spending. We will 
dwell in later speeches on how the 
scheme operates. 
This first speech seeks its origins. 
The scheme is secret, and because of its 
secrecy, it is hard to know exactly 
where the story should begin. 
The one place you could begin is with 
a 
corporate 
lawyer—the 
Virginian 
Lewis Powell. An authorized biography 
of Lewis Powell by his fellow Vir-
ginian, renowned UVA law professor 
John Jeffries, reveals Powell to be a 
tough and incisive lawyer, willing and 
able to make sharp, even harsh, deci-
sions, but a man of courtly and decent 
matters, well settled in the White male 
social and corporate elite of Richmond, 
VA. There he developed his legal and 
business career through the 1950s and 
1960s. 
A successful corporate law practice 
often 
entailed 
joining 
corporate 
boards. Richmond was a home to Big 
Tobacco, and Powell’s legal career led 
him on to Richmond’s tobacco and 
other corporate boards. 
Richmond was Virginia’s sibling rival 
to Charlottesville, which could boast of 
Thomas Jefferson’s nearby Monticello, 
his renowned University of Virginia, 
and all the cultural and academic vi-
brancy bubbling around that great uni-
versity. Richmond—Richmond was the 
working sibling, hosting the State’s 
capitol and its political offices and 
serving as its corporate center. 
Powell was an ambitious Richmond 
corporate lawyer, and the turbulence of 
the 1960s was broadly distressing to 
America’s corporate elite. The civil 
rights movement disrupted Jim Crow 
across the South, drawing out and ex-
posing to the Nation the racist vio-
lence that had long enforced the social 
and legal norm of segregation and up-
setting America’s all-White corporate 
suites and boardrooms. 
Anti-war 
protesters 
derided 
Dow 
Chemical Company’s manufacture of 
napalm and scorned the entire mili-
tary-industrial 
complex. 
Women’s 
rights protesters challenged all-male 
corporate management structures. The 
environmental 
movement 
protested 
chemical leaks, toxic products, and the 
poisons 
belching 
from 
corporate 
smokestacks. 
Public 
health 
groups 
began linking the tobacco industry to 
deadly illnesses, and lead paint compa-
nies to brain damage in children. 
Ralph Nader criticized America’s car 
companies 
for 
making 
automobiles 
that were ‘‘Unsafe at Any Speed’’ and 
causing carnage on America’s high-
ways. 
America’s 
anxious 
corporate 
elite saw Congress respond with new 
and unwelcome laws and saw courts re-
spond with big and unwelcome ver-
dicts. Something had to be done. 
Powell’s prominence in Virginia’s 
civic, legal, social, and corporate cir-
cles had brought him attention in 
Washington, DC. And a new client of 
his, the Washington, DC-based U.S. 
Chamber of Commerce, asked Powell 
for his help. The Chamber commis-
sioned from Powell a secret report, a 
strategic plan for reasserting corporate 
authority over the political arena. 
The secret Powell report, titled ‘‘At-
tack on American Free Enterprise Sys-
tem,’’ was telling. It was telling, first, 
for the apocalyptic certainty of its 
tone. Powell’s opening sentence was: 
‘‘No thoughtful person can question 
that the American system is under 
broad attack.’’ By that, he meant the 
American economic system, but that 
assertion was footnoted with the par-
allel assertion that—and I am quoting 
him again—‘‘The American political 
system of democracy under the rule of 
law is also under attack.’’ 
This was, Powell asserted, ‘‘quite 
new in [American history].’’ 
‘‘Business and the enterprise system 
are in deep trouble,’’ he wrote, ‘‘and 
the hour is late.’’ 
The secret Powell report was an 
alarm. 
The report is populated with liberal 
bogeymen: the bombastic lawyer Wil-
liam Kunstler; the popular author of 
‘‘The Greening of America,’’ Charles 
Reich; the consumer advocate Ralph 
Nader, whom Powell said there should 
be, and I am quoting here, ‘‘no hesi-
tation to attack.’’ 
Against them, Powell set establish-
ment defenders like columnist Stewart 
Alsop and conservative economist Mil-
ton Friedman. Powell cloaked the con-
cerns of corporate America as concerns 
of ‘‘individual freedom,’’ a rhetorical 
framework 
for 
corporate 
political 
power that persists to this day. 
The battle lines were drawn. Indeed, 
the language in the Powell report is 
the 
language 
of 
battle: 
‘‘attack,’’ 
‘‘frontal assault,’’ ‘‘rifle shots,’’ ‘‘war-
fare.’’ The recommendations are to end 
compromise 
and 
appeasement—his 
words: ‘‘compromise’’ and ‘‘appease-
ment’’—to understand that, as he said, 
‘‘the ultimate issue may be survival’’— 
and he underlined the word ‘‘survival’’

in his report—and to call for ‘‘the wis-
dom, ingenuity and resources of Amer-
ican business to be marshaled against 
those who would destroy it.’’ 
Well, for this, you had to have a plan, 
and the Powell plan was to go big. Here 
is what he said: 
‘‘Strength lies in organization, in 
careful long-range planning and imple-
mentation, in consistency of action 
over an indefinite period of years, in 
the scale of financing available only 
through joint effort, and in the polit-
ical power available only through 
united action and national organiza-
tions.’’ 
Powell recommended a propaganda 
effort staffed with scholars and speak-
ers, a propaganda effort to which 
American business should devote ‘‘10 
percent of its total advertising budg-
et,’’ including an effort to review and 
critique textbooks, especially in eco-
nomics, political science, and soci-
ology. 
‘‘National television networks should 
be monitored in the same way that 
textbooks should be kept under con-
stant surveillance,’’ he said. Corporate 
America should aggressively insist on 
the right to be heard, on ‘‘equal time,’’ 
and corporate America should be ready 
to deploy, and I am quoting him here, 
‘‘whatever degree of pressure—publicly 
and 
privately—may 
be 
necessary.’’ 
This would be ‘‘a long road,’’ Powell 
warned, ‘‘and not for the fainthearted.’’ 
In his section entitled ‘‘The Ne-
glected Political Arena,’’ Powell rec-
ommended using political influence to 
stem ‘‘the stampedes by politicians to 
support any legislation related to ‘con-
sumerism’ or to the ‘environment.’ ’’ 
And, yes, Powell put the word ‘‘envi-
ronment’’ in derogatory quote marks 
in the original. 
‘‘Political power,’’ Powell wrote, ‘‘is 
necessary; . . . [it] must be assiduously 
cultivated; and . . . when necessary 
. . . must be used aggressively and 
with determination.’’ He concluded 
that ‘‘it is essential [to] be far more ag-
gressive than in the past,’’ with ‘‘no 
hesitation to attack,’’ ‘‘not the slight-
est hesitation to press vigorously in all 
political arenas,’’ and no ‘‘reluctance 
to penalize politically those who op-
pose’’ the corporate effort. In a nut-
shell, no holds barred. 
And then came the section of the se-
cret report that may have launched the 
scheme to capture the court. It is 
called ‘‘Neglected Opportunity in the 
Courts.’’ This section focused on what 
Powell called ‘‘exploiting judicial ac-
tion.’’ He called it an ‘‘area of vast op-
portunity.’’ 
He wrote: ‘‘Under our constitutional 
system, especially with an activist- 
minded Supreme Court’’—I will inter-
vene to say, of course, we have today, 
as a result of the scheme, the most ac-
tivist-minded Supreme Court in Amer-
ican history, but back to his quote— 
‘‘especially with an activist-minded 
Supreme Court, the judiciary may be 
the most important instrument for so-
cial, economic and political change.’’ 
Powell urged that the Chamber of 
Commerce become the voice of Amer-
ican business in the courts, with a 
‘‘highly competent staff of lawyers,’’ if 
‘‘business is willing to provide the 
funds.’’ He concludes: ‘‘The oppor-
tunity merits the necessary effort.’’ 
The secret report may well have been 
the single most consequential piece of 
writing that Lewis Powell ever did in a 
long career of consequential writings. 
The tone and content of the report ac-
tually explain a lot of decisions in his 
future career. Yet this secret report re-
ceived no attention—not even a passing 
mention—in 
Professor 
Jeffries’ 
de-
tailed, authoritative, and authorized 
Powell biography. 
The secret chamber report was not 
disclosed to the U.S. Senate in Senate 
confirmation proceedings when, short-
ly after delivering his secret report to 
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Lewis 
Powell was nominated to the U.S. Su-
preme Court by President Richard 
Nixon. 
The secret report was dated August 
23, 1971. Two months later, on October 
22, Nixon nominated Powell to the Su-
preme Court. Lewis Powell was sworn 
in as an Associate Justice of the Su-
preme Court on January 7, 1972, less 
than 6 months after this secret report 
was delivered to the chamber. 
To be continued.

SAFEGUARDING AMERICAN INNOVATION ACT 
Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I 
rise today in strong support of the 
Safeguarding 
American 
Innovation 
Act. This is legislation that has been 
included in the substitute amendment 
to the bill we are working on this 
week, called the Endless Frontier Act, 
or as it has now been called, the U.S. 
Innovation and Competition Act. 
Well, if our goal is to increase U.S. 
competitiveness and encourage more 
U.S. innovation, we have to not only 
invest in research and innovation, we 
have to be sure that we are keeping our 
investment in research and intellectual 
property from being taken by our com-
petitors and used against us. That is 
what this legislation does. 
By the way, that is just common 
sense, or so you would think, but that 
is not what we found during a bipar-
tisan investigation during the Perma-
nent Subcommittee on Investigations. 
Instead, during a yearlong inquiry, we 
uncovered that our government and 
our research institutions over the last 
couple of decades have permitted China 
to take advantage of a lax U.S. ap-
proach to safeguarding our taxpayer- 
funded innovation, be it in our college 
campuses or in our research labs, nor 
was law enforcement, principally the 
FBI, doing anything significant to 
combat this threat. In fact, at our 
hearing on the report about 18 months 
ago, the FBI admitted in sworn testi-
mony that they have been asleep at the 
switch, essentially. 
Our PSI investigation detailed the 
rampant theft of U.S. taxpayer-funded 
research and intellectual property by 
China by way of their so-called China 
recruitment 
programs, 
mainly 
the 
Thousand Talents Plan. China uses 
these plans to systematically find 
promising researchers and promising 
research that China is interested in, 
and they recruit those researchers. 
These programs have not been subtle. 
The Thousand Talents Plan is perhaps 
the best understood of these programs, 
although there are actually a couple 
hundred of them. Our PSI investigation 
documented how the Thousand Talents 
Plan was used to target and steal tax-
payer-funded research and IP for at 
least two decades in this country, and 
much of that research and innovation 
was taken from our labs to China and 
went directly into fueling the rise of 
the Chinese economy and the Chinese 
military. 
While this is what China has done 
and continues to do, this is really 
about us. We have to get our own house 
in order. Specifically, we found that 
the Chinese Government has targeted 
promising U.S.-based research and re-
searchers. Often, this research is fund-
ed by U.S. taxpayers. We spend about 
$150 billion a year on taxpayer-funded 
research in places like the National In-
stitutes 
of 
Health, 
the 
National 
Science Foundation, and the Depart-
ment of Energy for basic science re-
search. And with this legislation we 
are talking about tonight on the floor, 
the Endless Frontier Act, we are talk-
ing about a huge increase in the 
amount of Federal spending for this 
kind of research. 
The annual $150 billion that has gone 
out over the years has been a good in-
vestment of taxpayer dollars, I believe. 
Why? Because it has led to some amaz-
ing things, from cures for everything 
from viruses to particular kinds of can-
cer, to technologies that support our 
defense base, to manufacturing tech-
nology that has made us more efficient 
as a country. But it is not good if the 
U.S. taxpayer is paying for this good 
research, and then China is taking it to 
fuel their own economic and military 
rise. 
China has not just stolen some of the 
research funded by U.S. taxpayers; 
China has actually paid these grant re-
cipients to take their research over to 
China at Chinese universities—again, 
universities affiliated with the Chinese 
Communist Party. They have been 
very clever about it. They want to be 
sure that China is a stronger compet-
itor against us, and they take the re-
search 
delivered 
from 
the 
United 
States to what is referred to as shadow

May 25, 2021 
labs in China, where they replicate the 
research. 
Rather than pointing the finger at 
China, we ought to be looking at our 
own government and our own institu-
tions and doing a better job with the 
things we can control. Again, let’s get 
our own house in order. We have made 
some progress in doing that. 
Following our November 2019 PSI in-
vestigation I talked about and the re-
port we issued, in December of 2020, 
John Demers, the Assistant Attorney 
General for National Security and head 
of the Justice Department’s China Ini-
tiative, announced that more than 1,000 
researchers 
affiliated 
with 
China’s 
military left the United States fol-
lowing a crackdown on recipients of 
taxpayer-funded Federal grants con-
cealing their affiliation with China’s 
Thousand Talents Program. One thou-
sand researchers left the United States. 
That news followed multiple guilty 
pleas and a string of arrests of aca-
demics affiliated with American uni-
versities for alleged crimes related to 
concealing their participation in Chi-
na’s talent recruitment programs while 
accepting American taxpayer funds and 
taking research to China. 
After two decades of allowing this ac-
tivity to go on, over the past 18 
months, we have finally begun to crack 
down. In my own State of Ohio, in my 
home State, there have been some re-
searchers who have been arrested. How-
ever, as our investigation found and 
law enforcement told us, the Federal 
Government is limited in the actions 
they can take under current law. It is 
our 
responsibility 
in 
Congress 
to 
change that. 
All of the arrests in connection with 
the Thousand Talents Plan have been 
related to peripheral financial crimes, 
like wire fraud and tax evasion, not the 
core issue of the conflict of commit-
ment, conflict of interest, the taking of 
American taxpayer research, and also 
taking money from China. Why? Be-
cause it is not currently a crime to 
knowingly hide foreign research fund-
ing on a Federal grant application, as 
an example. In other words, if you are 
performing research funded by the U.S. 
taxpayer and also being paid by China 
to do the same research, there is no 
law that states you have to disclose 
that funding from China. That is just 
wrong. 
Since our report, the National Insti-
tutes of Health has started to require 
that that information be disclosed. The 
NIH is alone so far in requiring that. 
But even there, there is still no law re-
quiring disclosure. 
The arrests made since our PSI re-
port have not been about that core 
issue of researchers hiding foreign 
funding from China and stealing our re-
search. So we need to change the laws 
so we can give our law enforcement 
community the tools they need to go 
do the job that all of us expect is being 
done. 
The Safeguarding American Innova-
tion Act goes directly to the root of 
this problem and makes it punishable 
by law to knowingly fail to disclose 
foreign funding on Federal grant appli-
cations. While this is a criminal stat-
ute, it is really about transparency, 
which is a core tenet of the U.S. re-
search enterprise. 
Our bill also makes other important 
changes informed by our investigation. 
It requires the Office of Management 
and Budget, OMB, in the executive 
branch to streamline and coordinate 
grant-making 
between 
the 
Federal 
Agencies so there is more continuity, 
accountability, and coordination when 
it comes to tracking the billions of dol-
lars of taxpayer-funded grant money 
that is being distributed. 
Again, the underlying legislation 
here in the Chamber tonight is about 
more money going into research. Let’s 
be sure that there is transparency and 
that we know how it is being distrib-
uted. We found in our investigation 
that this kind of coordination and 
transparency was sorely lacking and 
long overdue. 
Our legislation also allows the De-
partment of State to deny visas to for-
eign researchers coming to the United 
States who they know are going to ex-
ploit the openness of our research en-
terprise 
to 
acquire 
sensitive 
and 
emerging technologies against the na-
tional security interests of the United 
States and to benefit an adversarial 
foreign government. 
This may surprise you, but the State 
Department can’t do that now. It is a 
loophole in the law. In finalizing our 
language for the substitute, we worked 
very closely with career State Depart-
ment employees, who were desperate to 
get this authority to keep, say, mem-
bers 
from 
the 
People’s 
Liberation 
Army, who are definitely connected 
with the Chinese military, from com-
ing over here and attending con-
ferences where sensitive, export con-
trolled technology is being talked 
about and distributed. 
Our bill also requires foreign institu-
tions and universities to tell the State 
Department whether a foreign re-
searcher will have access to export con-
trolled technologies and also to dem-
onstrate to the State Department that 
they have a plan to prevent unauthor-
ized access to any export controlled 
technologies at the research institu-
tion. 
That is really important. It seems 
like basic information that the State 
Department would get here, that would 
have been provided all along, but it 
hasn’t been. Providing this information 
as part of the visa process should also 
help streamline the process for the 
State Department and for these re-
search institutions. I think it is good 
for both to make sure that this is clear 
and we know what the rules are. 
We also require increased trans-
parency in reporting foreign gifts and 
contracts at our colleges and our uni-
versities. Those schools are now going 
to need to report any foreign gift or 
contract worth $50,000 or more. The 
current threshold is $250,000. More 
transparency is a good thing. 
We also empower the Department of 
Education to work with these univer-
sities and research institutions to en-
sure that this can be complied with in 
a way that doesn’t create undue red-
tape and expenditures. That is not the 
idea. The idea is to have transparency 
but have it be something that is effi-
cient. But we also allow the Depart-
ment of Education for the first time to 
fine universities that repeatedly fail to 
disclose these gifts. We have actually 
found that about 70 percent of univer-
sities weren’t following the current 
law, partly because there was no fine. 
There was really no accountability. 
All of the changes that I have out-
lined are necessary to help keep Amer-
ica on the cutting edge. In order to be 
globally competitive, we have to be 
more effective at pushing back against 
the specific threat from China and 
from other nations, like Russia, Iran, 
and North Korea, looking to steal our 
research and our intellectual property. 
Until we start to clean up our own 
house and take a firmer stance against 
foreign influences here in this country 
trying to take our research, we are 
going to keep losing the innovations 
that we create here, and we will be less 
competitive. That is why the Safe-
guarding American Innovation Act is 
so important to be included in this bill. 
I will finish by noting that this has 
been truly a nonpartisan effort—not 
just bipartisan but nonpartisan—from 
the start. We wanted to ensure that, in 
a thoughtful, smart, and effective way, 
we were responding to the very real 
threat that we identified from China 
and other foreign adversaries. 
I want to commend my partner in 
our PSI investigation and cosponsor of 
our legislation, Senator TOM CARPER. I 
also want to thank the Presiding Offi-
cer tonight for her role in this, for her 
contributions and her support. I also 
want to say that I appreciate Senators 
PETERS and SCHUMER and their staff for 
working with us to finalize the lan-
guage, as well as the State Department 
and other officials from the Trump ad-
ministration and the Biden administra-
tion who provided important assist-
ance. 
Safeguarding American innovation is 
always a good idea, but it is particu-
larly important in the context of the 
legislation before us that provides ex-
ceptionally large amounts of Federal 
money for research to make us more 
competitive. I support that research, 
but I don’t want the taxpayer funds to 
go in the front door and then to have 
the research go out the back door to 
China or other adversaries. That is not 
what this should be about, and thanks 
to this legislation being included in 
this law, I feel confident that it will 
not be about that. 
I yield back my time.

jority leader.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3416 
May 25, 2021 
the substitute amendment of the com-
petition bill and on the motion to pro-
ceed to the House-passed legislation to 
create an independent commission to 
investigate and report on the attack of 
January 6, setting up a potential vote 
this week. 
On the competition bill, this legisla-
tion is the product of at least half a 
dozen Senate committees, working for 
months—months—in a bipartisan way. 
That means that every single Member 
of the Senate has had their fingerprints 
on it in one manner or another. 
The Senate has been making great 
progress so far this week. To borrow an 
expression that might appeal to my 
colleague and partner from Indiana, 
Senator YOUNG, we are approaching the 
final straightaway of the race. We have 
completed a very efficient series of 
votes on six amendments this after-
noon, five of which were sponsored by 
Republicans. That is in addition to four 
amendment votes we have already held 
and literally dozens—dozens—of bipar-
tisan amendments that were added to 
the bill before it even reached the 
floor. 
This is regular order in action. Mem-
bers on both sides have clamored that 
we bring bills to the floor, debate 
them, and ask for amendments. That is 
what is happening here. This is a bipar-
tisan bill that came out of committees 
with overwhelming votes—21 to 1 in 
Foreign Relations and 22 to 4 in Com-
merce, with a lot of bipartisan input in 
both committees and throughout—and 
now we are debating it on the floor. 
I believe the depth of bipartisanship 
on this bill reveals two things: one, 
just how much of a hunger there is on 
both sides of the aisle to tackle the 
issue of American leadership in the 21st 
century. It also shows a hunger to 
work in a bipartisan way, and we hope 
that our colleagues will understand 
that as we seek now to invoke cloture 
on the bill after we do several more 
amendments. 
With the finish line in sight, we need 
to continue working together to see 
this bill through. As I said, we will con-
sider a few more amendments tomor-
row and Thursday, including a man-
agers’ amendment, before final pas-
sage. If both sides continue to work in 
good faith to schedule amendment 
votes, which has been the hallmark so 
far, there is no reason we can’t finish 
the competition bill by the end of the 
week. And we will look for a signal 
from our Republican friends that, when 
we cooperate, we will move forward 
and not move to block or delay unnec-
essarily. 
Now, of this bill, again, I cannot say 
how important it is to the future of 
America. Investing in science and inno-
vation has been a hallmark of why this 
country has led the world in economic 
growth, in good-paying jobs, in cre-
ating 
a 
brighter, 
sunnier, 
happier 
America. Our failure to invest could 
lead to a real decline—a cloudiness 
over America and its future. We have 
to move forward, and that is why this 
bill has gotten such great support. This 
is not a minor bill. Just because there 
is not partisan fighting doesn’t mean it 
is not one of the most important bills 
we have passed in a very long time, and 
we will look back in history and say 
that this was a moment when America 
got a grip back on itself and moved for-
ward after several years of languishing, 
at best. 
JANUARY 6 COMMISSION 
I am also going to move to file clo-
ture on the motion to proceed to the 
House-passed legislation to create an 
independent commission to investigate 
and report on the attack of January 6, 
setting up a potential vote this week. 
We all know the commission is an ur-
gent, necessary idea to safeguard our 
democracy. What happened on January 
6 was a travesty—a travesty. It risked 
America in ways we haven’t seen in 
decades, maybe even in our history al-
together. 
In the wake of January 6, unfortu-
nately, too many Republicans in both 
Chambers have been trying to rewrite 
history and sweep the despicable at-
tack on our democracy under the rug. 
If people believe the Big Lie—if they 
believe that this election was not on 
the level, spread by the Big Lie of Don-
ald Trump and his legions in the 
press—our democracy erodes. At the 
core of this democracy is the belief 
that we vote; the process is fair; and 
then whoever is fairly elected we re-
spect as our leader. That has not hap-
pened for the first time in a long time. 
I so respect our two Republican col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
who say they will vote for this pro-
posal. I hope many more will. We have 
to get it passed. Each Member of the 
Senate is going to have to stand up and 
decide: Are you on the side of truth and 
accountability or are you on the side of 
Donald Trump and the Big Lie? 
We cannot let this lie fester. We must 
get at the truth. We must restore faith 
in this grand, wonderful, beautiful, 
evolving experiment—the greatest de-
mocracy that has ever been seen on 
Earth. We can’t let that go away. By 
sweeping all of this under the rug and 
by having so many people believe the 
lies, we could see the Sun begin to set 
on America. I hope that doesn’t hap-
pen. I pray that doesn’t happen. I don’t 
believe it will happen because I believe 
we will rise to the occasion and get at 
the truth.

MEMORIAL DAY 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam Presi-
dent, I rise today in remembrance and 
recognition of the tremendous sacrifice 
of America’s fallen military members 
who have given their life in service to 
our Nation and defense of our free-
doms. 
As we commemorate Memorial Day 
this year on Monday, May 31, we honor 
and remember the brave men and 
women whose lives have been lost in 
defense of the freedoms we hold dear. 
Without their incredible sacrifice, our 
Nation and the very ideals of democ-
racy, freedom, and liberty we so proud-
ly represent would not have endured. 
On this occasion, as we express our 
Nation’s gratitude to our fallen heroes, 
we remember the words written by 
President Abraham Lincoln to Mrs. 
Lydia Bixby following the loss of her 
five sons. In his letter, dated November 
21, 1864, President Lincoln wrote, ‘‘I 
pray that our Heavenly Father may as-
suage the anguish of your bereave-
ment, and leave you only the cherished 
memory of the loved and lost, and the 
solemn pride that must be yours to 
have laid so costly a sacrifice upon the 
altar of freedom.’’ 
Our Nation can never fully repay the 
debt of gratitude owed to these fallen 
heroes and their families. Each year, 
on Memorial Day, we pledge that their 
service and sacrifice will never be for-
gotten. 
We also take this opportunity to 
thank the many men, women, and or-
ganizations that work every day to 
support our military and veteran com-
munity, as well as the families of fall-
en heroes. I especially would like to 
recognize the work of American Legion 
Post 135, in my hometown of Naples, 
FL. The work American Legion Post 
135 and the many other veterans and 
military organizations do to support 
our families and communities is great-
ly appreciated. 
I ask that all Floridians and all 
Americans join me today in pausing for 
a moment to reflect on the sacrifice of 
America’s great heroes and all who 
have made the ultimate sacrifice in 
service to us and this great Nation.

REMEMBERING REAR ADMIRAL 
RICHARD T. BRENNAN, JR. 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I 
rise today to honor RDML Richard T. 
Brennan, Jr., of the National Oceanic 
and 
Atmospheric 
Administration, 
NOAA, Commissioned Corps, one of our 
Nation’s eight uniformed services. Ad-
miral Brennan most recently served as 
the Director of the Office of Coast Sur-
vey, one of America’s oldest bureaus, 
created by Thomas Jefferson in 1807 to 
produce nautical charts to help the Na-
tion with safe shipping, national de-
fense, and maritime boundaries. Unfor-
tunately, 
Admiral 
Brennan

S3418 
May 25, 2021 
away suddenly on May 13, 2021, due to 
complications from surgery. He was 52 
years old. 
Former leaders of the storied ‘‘Sur-
vey of the Coast,’’ going back to the 
first 
superintendent, 
Ferdinand 
R. 
Hassler, were either impeccable sur-
veyors, expert scientists, ingenious en-
gineers, master shiphandlers, intrepid 
explorers, 
or 
visionary 
risk-takers. 
With 27 years of diverse experience and 
a constant desire to learn more, Admi-
ral Brennan embodied all of those 
qualities and more. He served on nearly 
every hydrographic ship in NOAA’s 
fleet, surveying the East Coast, Carib-
bean territories, the Gulf of Mexico and 
the Pacific Coast into remote areas of 
Alaska, even mapping far into the Arc-
tic Ocean to support the U.S.’s Law of 
the Sea claim. Whether discovering a 
new, uncharted seamount deep in the 
Chukchi Sea or uncovering the sunken 
remains of a lost locomotive tender car 
off the tidal banks of the Piscataqua 
River, Admiral Brennan’s endless en-
thusiasm for mapping our oceans and 
coasts was infectious to all who sailed 
with him. 
During his various land assignments, 
Admiral Brennan provided valuable 
technical direction to the many phys-
ical scientists, hydrographers, cartog-
raphers, and officers who worked for 
him while leading change to pull chart-
ing services ever more into the digital 
age. He served as a reliable resource to 
various 
maritime 
stakeholders 
and 
other Federal Agencies, using his effec-
tive interpersonal skills to bring NOAA 
assets to bear in addressing their con-
cerns. He notably earned the NOAA 
Corps Commendation Medal and the 
Department of Commerce Group Silver 
Medal for his service during Hurricane 
Irene by coordinating NOAA resources 
to quickly reopen the port of Norfolk, 
a waterway that is as vital for national 
security as it is for global commerce. I 
am proud to point out that along the 
way, he earned a master’s degree in 
ocean engineering at the University of 
New Hampshire’s esteemed Center for 
Coastal and Ocean Mapping. 
However, Admiral Brennan’s stellar 
career is not what endeared himself to 
so many or what makes his passing so 
devastating. He was an exemplary civil 
servant and leader, and he is remem-
bered as the person whom so many 
were grateful to work alongside during 
their own careers. People across the 
country remember Admiral Brennan 
for his empathy, wry humor, gen-
erosity, 
friendship, 
and 
humanity. 
Many sought his guidance on personal 
matters as much as they did on profes-
sional challenges, and he went out of 
his way for them, seeking out the 
struggling colleague to cheer them up 
with his warm wit or changing plans to 
chat over a commiserating meal. The 
task at hand was important to Admiral 
Brennan, but he never looked past the 
people around him, putting them first. 
My thoughts are with NOAA and the 
maritime community, knowing that 
his loss has created a hole in the hearts 
of all who were fortunate to know him. 
More importantly, my deepest sym-
pathies go out to his wife Tracey and 
his two sons, Ty and Sam, who lost a 
wonderful husband and loving father 
far too soon. By all accounts, Admiral 
Brennan’s family were front and center 
in his life, and they never left his 
thoughts, especially when he was away 
in support of NOAA’s mission. 
On behalf of all the people of New 
Hampshire, I ask my colleagues and all 
Americans to join me in honoring Ad-
miral Brennan for his leadership, integ-
rity, and dedicated years of service to 
this grateful Nation. May he rest in 
peace.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
REMEMBERING WILLIAM ‘‘BILLY’’ 
JORDAN JARRELL 
∑ Mr. 
DAINES. 
Madam 
President, 
today I have the honor of recognizing 
the life of a great man, William 
‘‘Billy’’ Jordan Jarrell. Billy passed 
away on May 11, 2021, after suffering 
from juvenile diabetes since he was 12. 
Billy was part of a large, loving fam-
ily. He was a beloved brother, son, 
cousin, and uncle. Growing up, Billy 
could often be found on the baseball 
field, where he excelled and was even 
inducted into the Major League Base-
ball Hall of Fame in a section dedi-
cated to Little League. He was also an 
avid Alabama football fan. Former 
teammates, classmates, and coworkers 
all miss him greatly. 
I am thankful for the passion that 
Billy showed for public service and 
grateful for the time that he dedicated 
to advocating for a range of issues in-
cluding energy and Native American 
issues. 
It is my honor to pay tribute to 
Billy, who was loved by many. I pray 
that his friends and family find peace 
in this hard time.∑

UTAH 2021 SERVICE ACADEMY 
APPOINTEES 
∑ Mr. LEE. Madam President, it is my 
distinct pleasure to recognize 13 exem-
plary men and women who are among 
the best and brightest that Utah has to 
offer. These individuals have answered 
the call to service by applying and re-
ceiving appointments to the U.S. Air 
Force Academy, the U.S. Merchant Ma-
rine Academy, the U.S. Military Acad-
emy, and the U.S. Naval Academy. 
As a Member of Congress, it is my 
privilege under title 10 of the United 
States Code to nominate a number of 
young men and women to attend these 
iconic service academies. However, re-
ceiving a congressional nomination 
does not guarantee acceptance. To be 
admitted, each applicant must meet— 
on his or her own merits—the acad-
emies’ rigorous standards. 
I am happy to report that all of the 
appointees being recognized today sur-
passed the expected standards. Not 
only have they demonstrated their im-
pressive mental and physical aptitude, 
they have also shown their high moral 
character, the capacity for leadership, 
courage, honesty, prudence, and self- 
discipline. These appointees maintain a 
steadfast commitment to service and 
to standing up for our country. They 
emulate the foundational character 
qualities upon which our service acad-
emies are built. 
I can say, without hesitation or exag-
geration that you would be hard- 
pressed to find a more accomplished, 
talented, patriotic group of American 
citizens anywhere. They will be a cred-
it to our Nation as they set off for Col-
orado 
Springs, 
Kings 
Point, 
West 
Point, and Annapolis. I look forward to 
seeing what they accomplish in the 
years to come. I am honored to recog-
nize 
and 
congratulate 
these 
fine 
Utahns in the U.S. Senate.

f 
STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTION 
By Mr. PADILLA (for himself, 
Mr. LANKFORD, Mrs. FEINSTEIN, 
Ms. SMITH, and Mr. MORAN): 
S. 1797. A bill to amend the Indian 
Health Care Improvement Act to ex-
pand the funding authority for ren-
ovating, constructing, and expanding 
certain facilities; to the Committee on 
Indian Affairs. 
Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, I rise 
to introduce the bipartisan ‘‘Urban In-
dian Health Providers Facilities Im-
provement Act.’’ 
This legislation honors our Federal 
trust responsibility by providing parity 
to Urban Indian Organizations that 
provide culturally competent health 
care to Native Americans living in 
urban areas. 
This legislation would remove the 
unjust and arbitrary restriction that 
prevents Urban Indian Organizations 
from using appropriated funds for con-
struction and facilities upgrades. 
This restriction is particularly un-
tenable in the midst of the COVID–19 
pandemic. 
Current law only permits the Indian 
Health Service to make construction 
or facilities funds available to Urban 
Indian Organizations to assist them in 
meeting or maintaining a now-obsolete 
accreditation standard. 
This limitation prevents Urban In-
dian Organizations from using appro-
priated funding for facilities, mainte-
nance and improvement, sanitation, 
equipment, and other necessary con-
struction upgrades, which limits their 
ability to provide the quality health 
care that Native Americans deserve. 
Urban Indian Organizations are the 
only tribal health organization bur-
dened by this restriction. This legisla-
tion would provide parity to Urban In-
dian Organizations and improve the 
safety and quality of care for urban In-
dians. 
California is home to one of the larg-
est populations of Native Americans, 
and Los Angeles and San Francisco 
have two of the largest urban Native 
American populations in the country. 
Almost 90% of Native Americans in 
California live in urban areas and 
therefore don’t access health care 
through their tribe. 
Further, there are no Indian Health 
Service hospitals in California, so the 
California Urban Indian Organizations 
are a lifeline to Native Americans in 
my state. Removing this unjust burden 
on Urban Indian Organizations would 
allow them to improve the quality of 
the culturally competent care that 
they provide. 
I thank Senator LANKFORD for co- 
leading this bill with me, and Congress-
men GALLEGO
and BACON
for intro-
ducing this legislation in the House of 
Representatives. 
I look forward to working with my 
colleagues 
to 
pass 
the 
bipartisan 
‘‘Urban Indian Health Providers Facili-
ties Improvement Act’’ as quickly as 
possible. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the 
floor. 
By Mr. KAINE (for himself and 
Ms. MURKOWSKI): 
S. 1804. A bill to amend the Public 
Health Service Act to improve mater-
nal health and promote safe mother-
hood; to the Committee on Health, 
Education, Labor, and Pensions. 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. president. There are 
significant racial and ethnic inequities 
in maternal and infant mortality rates 
in the U.S. American Indian/Alaska 
Native women are more than twice as 
likely as nonHispanic white women to 
die as a result of pregnancy or its com-
plications, and the infant mortality 
rate among babies born to American 
Indian/Alaska Native women is 2.1 
times higher than that of non-Hispanic 
white women. According to the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention, the 
maternal mortality rate for non-His-
panic Black women in 2018 is more 
than 2.5 times higher than the mater-
nal mortality rate of non-Hispanic 
white women, and the infant mortality 
rate of non-Hispanic Black women is 
more than 2.3 times higher than the in-
fant mortality rate of non-Hispanic 
white women. Any pregnant woman 
choosing to have a child should be able 
to do so safely without regard to in-
come, race, ethnicity, employment sta-
tus, or any other socio-economic fac-
tor. 
This is why Senator MURKOWSKI and 
I are reintroducing the Mothers and 
Newborns Success Act, which aims to 
reduce maternal and infant mortality, 
ensure that all infants can grow up 
healthy and safe, and protect women’s 
health before, during, and after preg-
nancy. Our legislation supports innova-
tion in maternal health delivery and 
improves data collection on maternal 
mortality and maternal deaths, includ-
ing implementing quality assurance 
processes to improve the validity of 
pregnancy checkbox data from death 
certificates so that we can better un-
derstand 
the 
causes 
of 
maternal 
deaths. The bill will help ensure that 
women are matched with birthing fa-
cilities that are risk-appropriate for 
their particular needs to improve ma-
ternal and neonatal care and health 
outcomes. The legislation strengthens 
support for women during the critical 
postpartum 
period, 
the 
year 
after 
birth. 
The bill also establishes a public and 
provider awareness campaign through 
the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention to promote awareness of 
maternal health warnings signs and 
the importance of vaccinations for 
pregnant women and children, ensuring 
pregnant women get the vaccinations 
they need. The bill promotes maternal 
health research, providing technical 
assistance to states to ensure represen-
tation of communities of color in key 
datasets. The bill establishes a Na-
tional Maternal Health Research Net-
work at the National Institute of 
Health to support innovative research 
to reduce maternal mortality and pro-
mote maternal health. The bill sup-
ports the Rural Maternity and Obstet-
ric Management Strategies (RMOMS) 
Program at the Health Resources and 
Services Administration to improve ac-
cess to, and continuity of, obstetrics 
care in rural communities, including 
thorough use of telehealth. 
No woman should fear for her or her 
child’s health because of socio-eco-
nomic factors, such as race or geo-
graphic location. We need to ensure 
more women of color and their chil-
dren, particularly Black women and 
children given the significant dispari-
ties they experience, receive equitable 
care and a fair chance for a healthy 
pregnancy and safe delivery. COVID–19 
and its impact on pregnant women has 
only underscored the need for urgent 
action. The Mothers and Newborns 
Success Act is a significant step to-
ward reducing racial, ethnic, and geo-
graphic inequities in maternal and in-
fant health. I’m calling on my Senate 
colleagues to cosponsor this bill and 
support its passage so we can enact 
positive systemic changes to make sure 
more women and newborns thrive and 
have the maximum chance for success.

ters’’, and ‘‘Rape their daughters’’; 
Whereas an elderly Jewish man was beaten 
with sticks by a mob at a pro-Palestinian 
protest in Toronto; 
Whereas a Member of Congress called 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 
an ‘‘ethno-nationalist’’ on the floor of the 
House of Representatives and in a tweet ac-
cused the Israeli military of committing war 
crimes; 
Whereas, after the announcement of a 
ceasefire in Israel, a Member of Congress 
tweeted, ‘‘The Israeli military’s occupation

Whereas a Member of Congress described 
Israel in a tweet as an ‘‘apartheid state’’; and 
Whereas a Member of Congress tweeted

tion; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Commerce, Science, and 
Transportation: 
S. RES. 233 
Whereas there are more than 57,000,000

Whereas bicycle tourism contributes bil-
lions of dollars annually to the United 
States economy;

vide an opportunity to educate United States 
citizens about the importance of bicycle 
safety and the health benefits of cycling; and

National Bike Month to educate citizens of 
the United States about the importance of 
bicycle safety and the health, transpor-
tation, and recreational benefits derived 
from cycling; 
(2) health and transportation professionals 
and organizations should promote bicycle 
safety and the benefits of cycling; and

the millions of cyclists in the United States 
and the national and community organiza-
tions, individuals, volunteers, and profes-
sionals associated with cycling for pro-
moting bicycle safety and the benefits of cy-
cling.

SENATE RESOLUTION 234—RECOG-
NIZING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY 
OF THE 1921 TULSA RACE MAS-
SACRE 
Mr. LANKFORD (for himself and Mr. 
INHOFE) submitted the following reso-
lution; 
which 
was 
considered 
and 
agreed to: 
S. RES. 234 
Whereas in the early 1900s many Black in-
dividuals and families settled throughout 
Oklahoma, setting up vibrant communities 
and dozens of all-Black towns. These individ-
uals came looking for new opportunities, 
freedom, and a chance for a better life; 
Whereas the most famous and prosperous 
of these Black communities was in Tulsa’s 
Greenwood District; 
Whereas O.W. Gurley, a wealthy Black 
business owner, moved to Tulsa in 1906 and 
purchased tracts of land sold primarily to 
Black individuals and families. The land 
stretched from Pine Street to the north to 
Archer Street on the south and Detroit Ave-
nue on the west and the Midland Valley rail 
line on the east; 
Whereas 
segregation 
and 
the 
inacces-
sibility of resources led O.W. Gurley and oth-
ers to open a variety of commercial estab-
lishments, including rooming houses, gro-
cery stores, barber shops, beauty salons, res-
taurants, clothiers, pharmacies, movie thea-
ters, dance halls, pool halls, confectioneries, 
jitney services, and professional offices (such 
as for doctors, lawyers, dentists, and ac-
countants);

owners, schools, and churches flourished and, 
by the late 1910s, it was the wealthiest Black 
community in the United States; 
Whereas churches such as Vernon African 
Methodist Episcopal Church, Mt. Zion Bap-
tist Church, First Baptist Church North 
Tulsa, Paradise Baptist Church, Metropoli-
tan Baptist Church, and others became cen-
tral to the family life and culture of the 
Greenwood District;

home to prominent professionals such as Dr. 
A.C. Jackson, who was known as the most 
skilled Black surgeon in the United States, 
and prominent attorney B.C. Franklin; 
Whereas Ellis Walker Woods, who walked 
more than 500 miles from Memphis to Okla-
homa, answered the call for African-Amer-
ican teachers and became the first principal 
of Booker T. Washington High School; 
Whereas, by 1921, the community was home 
to thousands of Black residents who lived 
and worked in the most prosperous Black 
community in the United States; 
Whereas the community earned the name 
the ‘‘Negro Wall Street of America’’ (later, 
simply known as the ‘‘Black Wall Street’’) 
from the famed African-American author 
and educator, Booker T. Washington; 
Whereas, as the opportunities for Black 
families grew, the community began to at-
tract more Black families, business owners, 
well-educated professionals, and individuals 
fleeing racial oppression and discrimination 
in other States; 
Whereas the town of Tullahassee, Okla-
homa, founded in 1883, is regarded as one of

of Indian Territory; 
Whereas the area where Tullahassee was 
founded was originally part of the Creek Na-
tion and the town had an established school 
by 1850; 
Whereas the town of Langston, Oklahoma, 
was founded in 1890 and named after John 
Mercer Langston, an African-American edu-
cator and Member of the House of Represent-
atives from Virginia; 
Whereas, 7 years later, the Oklahoma Ter-
ritorial Legislature established the Colored 
Agricultural and Normal University (re-
ferred to in this preamble as ‘‘CANU’’), 
which would later be renamed Langston Uni-
versity. The university has grown from 41 
students in 1897 to more than 3,000 in 2021; 
Whereas prominent Oklahomans such as 
Melvin Tolson, Ada Lois Sipuel Fisher, Clara 
Luper, E. Melvin Porter, Frederick Moon,

Young, Inman Page, and Zella Black Patter-
son resided in Langston or called CANU

Gold, a silent film, in Tatums and enlisted 
the citizens of the town and Marshal L. B. 
Tatums to be featured in the movie; 
Whereas the town of Taft, Oklahoma, 
founded in 1902 on land allotted to Creek 
Freedman, changed its name from Twine to

general stores, a drugstore, a brickyard, a 
soda pop factory, 2 hotels, and a bank; 
Whereas the town of Grayson, Oklahoma, 
brimmed with 5 general stores, 2 black-
smiths, 2 drug stores, a cotton gin, and a 
physician soon after it was founded in 1902. 
Originally known as Wildcat, the town 
changed its name in 1909 to honor the Creek 
Chief George W. Grayson; 
Whereas the town of Boley, Oklahoma, es-
tablished in 1903 and named after J.B. Boley, 
a railroad official of the Fort Smith and 
Western Railway, grew to be one of the 
wealthiest and largest Black towns in Okla-
homa; 
Whereas, only 5 years after being founded, 
Booker T. Washington visited Boley and 
wrote about the prosperity he had witnessed; 
Whereas, in 2021, Boley still carries on 
their standing tradition of a Black commu-
nity-based rodeo, now the oldest of its kind 
in the Nation; 
Whereas the town of Rentiesville, Okla-
homa, founded in 1903, was developed on 40 
acres owned by William Rentie and Phoebe 
McIntosh; 
Whereas John Hope Franklin, a prominent

decorated historians; 
Whereas the town of Clearview, Oklahoma, 
founded in 1903 along the tracks of the Fort

rounding counties would come to watch the 
baseball team play, turning the railroad 
tracks into substitute bleachers; 
Whereas the town of Brooksville, Okla-
homa, founded in 1903, was originally named 
Sewell. The town was renamed in 1912 to 
honor the first Black man in the area, A. R. 
Brooks; 
Whereas, 
soon 
after 
the 
town 
of 
Brooksville was established, Rev. Jedson 
White 
founded 
the 
St. 
John’s 
Baptist 
Church; 
Whereas George W. McLaurin, who was the 
first Black graduate at the University of 
Oklahoma, taught at the local school in

the Creek Nation; 
Whereas E. L. Barber was one of the origi-
nal developers of the town of Red Bird, the 
first justice of peace of the town, and an

Whereas the town of Vernon, Oklahoma, 
founded in 1911 on Tankard Ranch in the 
Creek Nation, was home to many trailblazers

master, and Louise Wesley, who established 
the first school and church in the town;

neath a tree. New Hope Baptist Church still 
stands in 2021 after more than 100 years; 
Whereas the town of Lima, Oklahoma, 
founded in 1913 along the Chicago, Rock Is-
land and Pacific Railroad, came together as 
a community to improve their town. To-
gether, they built the Mount Zion Methodist 
Church in 1915, which still stands in 2021; 
Whereas, the history of these historically 
Black towns is interwoven into the history 
of the State of Oklahoma and the residents 
of these towns have achieved great successes 
and faced tremendous challenges; 
Whereas the stories of the Black towns and 
communities in Oklahoma are inextricably 
linked to the events of May 30 to June 1, 
1921, in the Greenwood District of North 
Tulsa, Oklahoma; 
Whereas, on May 30, 1921, a young Black 
man named Dick Rowland was in downtown 
Tulsa, Oklahoma, and entered the Drexel 
Building to use the only bathroom in the 
area available to Black people; 
Whereas an incident occurred on the eleva-
tor between Dick Rowland and Sarah Paige, 
the elevator operator, and Sarah Paige 
screamed; 
Whereas, after a police investigation, the 
next day Dick Rowland was detained at the 
Tulsa Police Department for questioning be-
fore being moved to the Tulsa Courthouse for 
additional security; 
Whereas, on May 31, 1921, the Tulsa Trib-
une released a sensationalist story claiming 
that a young Black male had attacked a 
White girl; 
Whereas that story and long-simmering 
tensions in the city led to a large group of 
White individuals surrounding the court-
house to demand that Dick Rowland be re-
leased so that he could be lynched; 
Whereas a group of Black men traveled to 
the courthouse to help defend Dick Rowland 
from the angry mob; 
Whereas, after a scuffle at the downtown 
Tulsa courthouse, White rioters pursued 
Black men to the Greenwood District and 
the violence escalated; 
Whereas houses and businesses were looted 
and burned throughout the Greenwood Dis-
trict and attacks lasted well into the next 
day before being quelled by the Oklahoma 
City National Guard; 
Whereas, in less than 24 hours, 35 city 
blocks were destroyed by fires and 6,000 Afri-
can-American individuals were detained; 
Whereas, out of the 23 churches that were 
located in the Greenwood area prior to the 
1921 Massacre, only 13 churches survived and 
only 3 churches were able to be rebuilt after 
being destroyed: Paradise Baptist Church, 
Mount Zion Baptist Church, and Vernon 
AME Church; 
Whereas, outside of the massacre area, 5 
churches were able to rebuild after being de-
stroyed; 
Whereas, the Black citizens in Tulsa began 
rebuilding the Greenwood District imme-
diately, with Church services resuming the 
following Sunday; 
Whereas this new Black Wall Street 
reached an economic peak in the mid-1940s 
but subsequently declined for many reasons 
that undermined the economic foundation of 
the community; 
Whereas, almost 100 years later, the resi-
dents and businesses in the Greenwood Dis-
trict carry on the legacy of resilience and de-
termination; 
Whereas Greenwood is home to thousands 
of individuals and families who make impor-
tant contributions to their city and the 
United States and there are countless minor-
ity-owned businesses in Greenwood that 
drive the local economy; 
Whereas there is still much work to do to 
heal the community and ensure all people in 
Greenwood have the promise of a brighter to-
morrow; and 
Whereas Greenwood is a community still 
scarred by the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre, but 
not defined by it: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) acknowledges that the 1921 Tulsa Race 
Massacre was the worst race massacre in the 
history of the United States; 
(2) recognizes that because of the worst 
race massacre in the history of the United 
States, several hundred Black residents of

the Greenwood District were killed and thou-
sands were made homeless overnight, and 
the most prosperous Black community in the 
United States was decimated; 
(3) urges that the history of what happened 
in Tulsa during the course of those 2 days in 
1921 be taught in the schools of the United 
States in a factual and accurate manner; 
(4) recognizes the important work of 
groups such as the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre 
Centennial Commission, the John Hope 
Franklin Center for Reconciliation, and oth-
ers who work tirelessly to ensure the story 
of the Greenwood District is accurately told 
and remembered; 
(5) believes that while significant progress 
has been made in the 100 years since the 1921 
Tulsa Race Massacre, there is still work to 
be done towards racial reconciliation, which 
can only be accomplished through open, re-
spectful, and frank dialogue; 
(6) encourages families of all races to in-
vite families of different races to their 
homes to have discussions on race, with par-
ents setting examples for their children on 
how to engage in a conversation that will 
build better understanding of, and respect 
for, people of different races; 
(7) believes that the significance of the 1921 
Tulsa Race Massacre and the complete his-
tory of the Greenwood District warrant the 
placement of the area on the National Reg-
istry of Historical Places and urges the De-
partment of Interior to work with the com-
munity to accomplish this as soon as pos-
sible; 
(8) hopes that the 100th anniversary week-
end is a moment for the country to look to 
Tulsa to see how racial relations have 
changed during the last 100 years, to cele-
brate improvements, and to reflect upon the 
areas where more work is needed; 
(9) urges all people of the United States to 
continue seeking greater understanding, dia-
logue, and closer connections to people of 
different races; and 
(10) recognizes the need to help the remain-
ing 13 Black towns in Oklahoma to preserve 
their historic legacy of political freedom and 
ensure their stories are known to future gen-
erations of Oklahomans and people of the

SENATE RESOLUTION 235—DESIG-
NATING MAY 15, 2021, AS ‘‘NA-
TIONAL MPS AWARENESS DAY’’ 
Mr. BENNET (for himself and Mr. 
GRAHAM) submitted the following reso-
lution; 
which 
was 
considered 
and 
agreed to: 
Whereas mucopolysaccharidosis (referred 
to in this preamble as ‘‘MPS’’) are a group of 
genetically determined lysosomal storage 
diseases that render the human body incapa-
ble of producing certain enzymes needed to 
break down complex carbohydrates; 
Whereas MPS diseases cause complex car-
bohydrates to be stored in almost every cell 
in the body, which progressively leads to cel-
lular damage; 
Whereas the cellular damage caused by 
MPS— 
(1) adversely affects the human body by 
damaging the heart, lungs, bones, central 
nervous system, and other internal organs; 
and 
(2) often results in intellectual disabilities, 
short stature, corneal damage, joint stiff-
ness, loss of mobility, speech and hearing im-
pairment, 
heart 
disease, 
hyperactivity, 
chronic respiratory problems, and, most 
painfully, a drastically shortened life span; 
Whereas symptoms of MPS are usually not 
apparent at birth; 
Whereas, without treatment, the life ex-
pectancy of an individual afflicted with MPS 
begins to decrease at a very early stage in 
the life of that individual; 
Whereas research has resulted in the devel-
opment of limited treatments for some MPS 
diseases; 
Whereas, as of the date of adoption of this 
resolution, promising advancements in the 
pursuit of treatments for additional MPS 
diseases are underway; 
Whereas, despite the creation of new rem-
edies, the blood-brain barrier continues to be 
a 
significant 
impediment 
to 
effectively 
treating the brain, which prevents the treat-
ment of many of the symptoms of MPS; 
Whereas the quality of life of individuals 
afflicted with MPS and the treatments avail-
able to those individuals will be enhanced 
through the development of early detection 
and early intervention techniques; 
Whereas treatments for and research ad-
vancements relating to MPS are limited by a 
lack of awareness about MPS diseases; 
Whereas the lack of awareness about MPS 
diseases extends to individuals within the 
medical community; 
Whereas the cellular damage caused by 
MPS makes MPS a model for the study of 
many other degenerative genetic diseases; 
and 
Whereas 
the 
development 
of 
effective 
therapies and a potential cure for MPS dis-
eases can be accomplished by increased 
awareness, research, data collection, and in-
formation distribution: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates May 15, 2021, as ‘‘National 
MPS Awareness Day’’; and 
(2) supports the goals and ideals of Na-
tional MPS Awareness Day.

S. RES. 236 
Whereas, in the case of United States v. 
Wornick, Cr. No. 20–106, pending in the United 
States District Court for the District of Col-
orado, the prosecution has requested the pro-
duction of testimony and, if necessary, docu-

Whereas, pursuant to sections 703(a) and 
704(a)(2) of the Ethics in Government Act of 
1978, 2 U.S.C. §§ 288b(a) and 288c(a)(2), the 
Senate may direct its counsel to represent 
current and former employees of the Senate 
with respect to any subpoena, order, or re-
quest for testimony or documents relating to 
their official responsibilities; 
Whereas, by the privileges of the Senate of 
the United States and Rule XI of the Stand-
ing Rules of the Senate, no evidence under 
the control or in the possession of the Senate 
may, by the judicial or administrative proc-
ess, be taken from such control or possession 
but by permission of the Senate; and 
Whereas, when it appears that evidence 
under the control or in the possession of the 
Senate may promote the administration of 
justice, the Senate will take such action as 
will promote the ends of justice consistent 
with the privileges of the Senate: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That Bailey McCue, an employee 
of the office of former Senator Cory Gardner, 
and any other employee of the former Sen-
ator’s office from whom relevant evidence 
may be necessary, are authorized to testify 
and produce documents in the case of United 
States v. Wornick, except concerning matters 
for which a privilege should be asserted. 
SEC. 2. The Senate Legal Counsel is author-
ized to represent Senator Gardner and any 
employees of his former office in connection 
with the production of evidence authorized 
in section one of this resolution.

SENATE 
RESOLUTION 
237—AP-
PROVING OF THE SALES OF DE-
FENSE ITEMS TO ISRAEL NOTI-
FIED TO CONGRESS ON MAY 5, 
2021 
Mr. CRUZ (for himself, Mr. HAGERTY, 
Mrs. BLACKBURN, Mr. BARRASSO, Mr. 
JOHNSON, Mr. COTTON, and Mr. RUBIO) 
submitted the following resolution; 
which was referred to the Committee 
on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 237 
Whereas, in the Arms Export Control Act 
(22 U.S.C. 2751 et seq.), Congress reaffirmed 
that it is the policy of the United States to 
facilitate the common defense of the United 
States and friendly countries by entering 
into international arrangements with those 
countries through authorized sales of defense 
items; 
Whereas, in the Arms Export Control Act, 
Congress established that it is ‘‘the sense of 
the Congress that all such sales be approved 
only when they are consistent with the for-
eign policy interests of the United States’’; 
Whereas section 36(c) of the Arms Export 
Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2776(c)) requires that 
the President transmit to the leaders and 
relevant committees of Congress certifi-
cations for proposed licenses for the export 
of certain defense items to Israel in the 
amount of $100,000,000 or more; 
Whereas, on May 5, 2021, the Department of 
State transmitted to Congress certifications 
pursuant to section 36(c) of the Arms Export 
Control Act for exports to Israel of defense 
items valued in excess of $800,000,000, includ-
ing munitions and defensive systems; and 
Whereas, on January 19, 2021, in testimony 
to the Committee on Foreign Relations of 
the Senate, now-Secretary of State Blinken 
emphasized that the incoming Presidential 
administration’s ‘‘commitment to Israel’s 
security is sacrosanct and this is something 
that [now-President Biden] feels very strong-
ly’’ and that ‘‘the foundation of our relation-
ship is support for Israel’s security’’: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) finds that the sales of defense items to 
Israel notified to Congress by the Depart-
ment of State on May 5, 2021, are consistent 
with the foreign policy interests of the 
United States; and 
(2) approves of those sales.

SEC. 6302. TRADE POLICY AND CONGRESSIONAL 
OVERSIGHT OF COVID–19 RESPONSE. 
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) it is imperative to promote the develop-
ment and deployment of vaccines, including 
to address pandemics like the pandemic re-
lating to COVID–19 and its variants; 
(2) as a developed nation with a long-
standing commitment to promoting global 
health, innovation, access to medicine, pub-
lic welfare, and security, the United States 
will continue to use the resources and tools 
at its disposal to promote the distribution of 
life-saving COVID–19 vaccines to other coun-
tries; 
(3) President Biden should continue to 
work with foreign governments, multilateral 
institutions, 
nongovernmental 
organiza-
tions, manufacturers, and other stakeholders 
to quickly identify and address, through tar-
geted and meaningful action, obstacles to 
ending the COVID–19 pandemic, whether 
those obstacles are legal, regulatory, con-
tractual, or otherwise; 
(4) in any efforts to address trade-related 
obstacles to ending the COVID–19 pandemic, 
President Biden should consider how any ac-
tion would complement the whole-of-govern-
ment approach of the President to ending 
the COVID–19 pandemic worldwide, including 
how any action would impact competitive-
ness, innovation, and the national security 
of the United States in the short- and long- 
term; 
(5) the President should strive to create 
the most appropriate balance between access 
to COVID–19 vaccines and therapeutics and 
generating an innovative environment in the 
United States; 
(6) the President should take into account 
the efforts of malign nations or entities to 
obtain intellectual property of United States 
persons through forced technology transfer, 
theft, or espionage, and accordingly make all 
efforts to protect that intellectual property 
from such nations or entities; and 
(7) in any efforts to address trade-related 
obstacles to ending the COVID–19 pandemic, 
Congress expects timely and meaningful con-
sultations on any negotiations and any 
agreements or decisions reached regarding 
matters of concern to members of Congress 
and their constituents, including issues of 
competitiveness, innovation, and national 
security. 
(b) TRADE POLICIES WITH RESPECT TO THE 
COVID–19 PANDEMIC.— 
(1) IN
GENERAL.—It is the policy of the 
United States to facilitate an effective and 
efficient response to the global pandemic 
with respect to COVID–19 by expediting ac-
cess 
to 
life-saving 
vaccines, 
medicines, 
diagnostics, medical equipment, and per-
sonal protective equipment. 
(2) ELEMENTS.—The United States Trade 
Representative shall pursue a timely, effec-
tive, and efficient response to the trade as-
pects of the COVID–19 pandemic, including 
by endeavoring to— 
(A) expedite access to medicines and life- 
saving products through trade facilitation 
measures; 
(B) obtain a reduction or elimination of 
nontariff barriers and distortions that im-
pact the procurement of life-saving products; 
(C) take action to increase access to 
COVID–19 vaccines globally, while avoiding 
providing access to intellectual property to 
nations or entities that seek to utilize the 
technology for other uses or that may other-
wise pose a threat to national security; 
(D) eliminate practices that adversely af-
fect trade in perishable or temperature-sen-
sitive products, and facilitate the transfer of 
materials and products in a manner that pre-
serves their integrity; 
(E) further strengthen the system of inter-
national trade and investment disciplines by 
demonstrating sufficient flexibility to re-
spond to a global crisis while retaining a bal-
anced approach to the rights of innovators; 
(F) encourage greater cooperation between 
the World Trade Organization and other 
international organizations and public-pri-
vate 
partnerships, 
including 
the 
World 
Health Organization, the United Nations 
Children’s Emergency Fund (commonly re-
ferred to as ‘‘UNICEF’’), the World Bank, 
and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance; and 
(G) take into account other legitimate do-
mestic policies of the United States, includ-
ing health and safety, national security, con-
sumer interests, intellectual property rights, 
and the laws and regulations related thereto. 
(c) CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT, CONSULTA-
TIONS, AND ACCESS TO INFORMATION.— 
(1) INTENT
TO
NEGOTIATE.—If the United 
States Trade Representative enters any ne-
gotiation pursuant to the trade policies de-
scribed in subsection (b), the Trade Rep-
resentative shall— 
(A) submit to Congress and publish in the 
Federal Register a statement specifying the 
objectives of the United States in pursuing 
the negotiation; and 
(B) submit to Congress an assessment of 
how and to what extent entering the nego-
tiation will achieve the trade policies de-
scribed in subsection (b). 
(2) CONSULTATION
AND
BRIEFING
BEFORE 
MAKING PROPOSALS.—Before making any tex-
tual proposal pursuant to the trade policies 
described in subsection (b), the United States 
Trade Representative shall— 
(A) consistent with section 242 of the Trade 
Expansion Act of 1962 (19 U.S.C. 1872), consult 
with the heads of relevant Federal agencies, 
including the Secretary of Commerce, the 
Secretary of Health and Human Services, 
and the Secretary of Defense, which shall in-
clude, as appropriate, discussion of— 
(i) the most effective means of addressing 
the COVID–19 pandemic and any variants to 
the COVID–19 virus, including by increasing

SEC. 3219L. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON DEFENDING 
AUSTRALIA FROM ECONOMIC COER-
CION. 
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) the alliance between the United States 
and Australia provides strategic, economic, 
and cultural value to both nations; 
(2) the security and prosperity of each is 
vital to the future security and prosperity of 
both nations; 
(3) the close, longstanding cooperation be-
tween the United States and Australia in 
strategic and military affairs is built on 
strong bonds of trust between the two na-
tions that bolster security and stability in 
the Indo-Pacific; 
(4) Australia is currently the target of a 
concerted campaign of economic coercion by 
the People’s Republic of China aimed at pun-
ishing the government and people of one of 
the United States’ closest allies for the exer-
cise of their sovereign, democratic rights; 
(5) the People’s Republic of China has em-
ployed similar forms of economic coercion 
against other countries on many other occa-
sions, not only within the Indo-Pacific but 
around the world; 
(6) such a campaign, if successful, has the 
potential to undermine the sovereignty of 
Australia and the ability of the Government 
of Australia to act in concert with the 
United States toward the shared goal of a 
free and open Indo-Pacific; and 
(7) the routine use of economic coercion by 
the People’s Republic of China against Aus-
tralia and other countries undermines those 
countries’ ability to speak or act in defense 
of their own sovereignty, democratic values, 
and human rights, and is therefore a threat 
to a free and open global order. 
(b) STATEMENT OF POLICY.—It shall be the 
policy of the United States— 
(1) to stand with Australia in its moment 
of need, providing relevant support to the 
Government and people of Australia to miti-
gate the costs of economic coercion by the 
People’s Republic of China to the greatest 
extent possible; 
(2) to work with the Government of Aus-
tralia and other allies and partners to co-
ordinate collective, cooperative responses to 
both threatened and actual instances of eco-
nomic coercion by the People’s Republic of 
China; and 
(3) to devise a strategy to guide the imple-
mentation of such responses, and to put in 
place the appropriate personnel, mecha-
nisms, and collective structures to facility 
their effectiveness.

AWARENESS. 
(a) SHORT
TITLE.—This section may be 
cited as the ‘‘Shareholder National Security 
Awareness Act of 2021’’. 
(b) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) The national security of the United 
States is a necessary condition for the ad-
vancement of the national public interest, 
the general welfare, and the volume of credit 
available for trade, industry, and transpor-
tation, which form the bases for the neces-
sity of the regulation of transactions in se-
curities, as described in section 2 of the Se-
curities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78b). 
(2) Transactions in securities may ad-
versely affect the national security of the 
United States in a manner that is analogous 
to the circumstances described in paragraphs 
(3) and (4) of section 2 of the Securities Ex-
change Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78b), which 
state that the unreasonable expansion and 
contraction of the volume of credit is caused 
by the susceptibility of the prices of securi-
ties to manipulation and control, excessive 
speculation, and sudden and unreasonable 
fluctuations. 
(3) In the case of the national security of 
the United States, the susceptibility of the 
prices of securities to manipulation and con-
trol, excessive speculation, and sudden and 
unreasonable fluctuations may create busi-
ness 
financing 
conditions 
that 
prevent, 
erode, or cause the abandonment of long- 
term investment that is necessary for the 
formation, development, and maintenance of 
capital assets that perform functions that 
are essential to the national security of the 
United States by— 
(A) undervaluing those capital assets rel-
ative to their necessity to the United States; 
and 
(B) overvaluing transactions that would re-
duce, downsize, outsource, or offshore the op-
eration of those capital assets. 
(4) In the report to Congress required under 
section 2504 of title 10, United States Code, 
with respect to fiscal year 2020, the Depart-
ment of Defense stated that ‘‘a U.S. business 
climate that has favored short-term share-
holder earnings . . . [has] severely damaged 
America’s ability to arm itself today and in 
the future’’. 
(5) The susceptibility of the prices of secu-
rities to manipulation and control, excessive 
speculation, and sudden and unreasonable 
fluctuations establishes, with respect to cap-
ital assets that are essential to the national

in cross-agency activities and where compo-
nent inspectors general may have otherwise 
faced significant challenges; 
(3) because of the cross-agency nature of 
Federal science and technology activities, 
Congress created the Office of Science and 
Technology Policy to coordinate and har-
monize among science functions at agencies; 
(4) the United States innovation eco-
system, which uses multiple science agencies 
to invest in research and development, can 
make it more difficult to identify and re-
move scientists who violate research integ-
rity principles; 
(5) the single agency jurisdiction of an 
agency inspector general can be a disadvan-
tage with respect to their oversight roles, 
and opportunities to strengthen the system 
may exist; 
(6) single agency jurisdiction of inspectors 
general may also make it difficult to har-
monize principles and standards for over-
sight of waste, fraud, and abuse among agen-
cies; and 
(7) certain issues of fraud, waste, and abuse 
in Federal science and technology activities 
span multiple agencies and are more appar-

At the appropriate place, insert the fol-

Subtitle C—Cyber and Technology Diplomacy 
SEC. 4271. SHORT TITLE. 
This subtitle may be cited as the ‘‘Cyber 
Diplomacy Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 4272. FINDINGS. 
Congress makes the following findings: 
(1) The stated goal of the United States 
International 
Strategy 
for 
Cyberspace, 
launched on May 16, 2011, is to ‘‘work inter-
nationally to promote an open, interoper-
able, secure, and reliable information and 
communications infrastructure that sup-
ports international trade and commerce, 
strengthens international security, and fos-
ters free expression and innovation ... in 
which norms of responsible behavior guide 
states’ actions, sustain partnerships, and 
support the rule of law in cyberspace’’. 
(2) In its June 24, 2013, report, the Group of 
Governmental Experts on Developments in 
the Field of Information and Telecommuni-
cations in the Context of International Secu-
rity (referred to in this section as ‘‘GGE’’), 
established by the United Nations General 
Assembly, 
concluded 
that 
‘‘State 
sov-
ereignty and the international norms and 
principles that flow from it apply to States’ 
conduct of ICT-related activities and to their 
jurisdiction over ICT infrastructure with 
their territory’’. 
(3) In January 2015, China, Kazakhstan, 
Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbek-
istan proposed a troubling international code 
of conduct for information security, which 
could be used as a pretext for restricting po-
litical dissent, and includes ‘‘curbing the dis-
semination of information that incites ter-
rorism, separatism or extremism or that in-
flames hatred on ethnic, racial or religious 
grounds’’. 
(4) In its July 22, 2015, consensus report, 
GGE found that ‘‘norms of responsible State 
behavior can reduce risks to international 
peace, security and stability’’. 
(5) On September 25, 2015, the United 
States and China announced a commitment 
that neither country’s government ‘‘will 
conduct or knowingly support cyber-enabled 
theft of intellectual property, including 
trade secrets or other confidential business 
information, with the intent of providing 
competitive advantages to companies or 
commercial sectors’’. 
(6) At the Antalya Summit on November 15 
and 16, 2015, the Group of 20 Leaders’ 
communique´— 
(A) affirmed the applicability of inter-
national law to state behavior in cyberspace; 
(B) called on states to refrain from cyber- 
enabled theft of intellectual property for 
commercial gain; and 
(C) endorsed the view that all states should 
abide by norms of responsible behavior. 
(7) The March 2016 Department of State 
International Cyberspace Policy Strategy 
noted that ‘‘the Department of State antici-
pates a continued increase and expansion of 
our cyber-focused diplomatic efforts for the 
foreseeable future’’. 
(8) On December 1, 2016, the Commission on 
Enhancing National Cybersecurity, which 
was established within the Department of 
Commerce by Executive Order No. 13718 (81 
Fed. Reg. 7441), recommended that ‘‘the 
President should appoint an Ambassador for 
Cybersecurity to lead U.S. engagement with 
the international community on cybersecu-
rity strategies, standards, and practices’’. 
(9) On April 11, 2017, the 2017 Group of 7 
Declaration on Responsible States Behavior 
in Cyberspace— 
(A) recognized ‘‘the urgent necessity of in-
creased international cooperation to pro-
mote security and stability in cyberspace’’; 
(B) expressed commitment to ‘‘promoting 
a strategic framework for conflict preven-
tion, cooperation and stability in cyber-
space, consisting of the recognition of the 
applicability of existing international law to 
State behavior in cyberspace, the promotion 
of voluntary, non-binding norms of respon-
sible State behavior during peacetime, and 
the development and the implementation of 
practical cyber confidence building measures 
(CBMs) between States’’; and 
(C) reaffirmed that ‘‘the same rights that 
people have offline must also be protected 
online’’. 
(10) In testimony before the Select Com-
mittee on Intelligence of the Senate on May 
11, 2017, Director of National Intelligence 
Daniel R. Coats identified 6 cyber threat ac-
tors, including— 
(A) Russia, for ‘‘efforts to influence the 
2016 U.S. election’’; 
(B) China, for ‘‘actively targeting the U.S. 
Government, its allies, and U.S. companies 
for cyber espionage’’; 
(C) Iran, for ‘‘leverag[ing] cyber espionage, 
propaganda, and attacks to support its secu-
rity priorities, influence events and foreign 
perceptions, and counter threats’’; 
(D) 
North 
Korea, 
for 
‘‘previously 
conduct[ing] 
cyber-attacks 
against 
U.S. 
commercial entities—specifically, Sony Pic-
tures Entertainment in 2014’’; 
(E) terrorists, who ‘‘use the Internet to or-
ganize, recruit, spread propaganda, raise 
funds, collect intelligence, inspire action by 
followers, and coordinate operations’’; and 
(F) criminals, who ‘‘are also developing 
and using sophisticated cyber tools for a va-
riety of purposes including theft, extortion, 
and facilitation of other criminal activi-
ties’’. 
(11) Information and communication tech-
nologies are among a broader set of critical 
and emerging technologies that underpin 
United States national security and eco-
nomic prosperity. The 2017 National Security 
Strategy noted the central importance of 
‘‘emerging technologies . . . such as data 
science, 
encryption, 
autonomous 
tech-
nologies, gene editing, new materials, nano-
technology, 
advanced 
computing 
tech-
nologies, and artificial intelligence.’’. 
(12) The 21st century will increasingly be 
defined by economic and military competi-
tion rooted in technological advances. Lead-
ers in adopting critical and emerging tech-
nologies, and those who shape the use of such 
technologies, will garner economic, military, 
and political strength for decades.

even greater control in the future as tech-
nology continues to develop. 
‘‘(3) The internet and other interactive 
computer services offer a forum for a true di-
versity of political discourse and viewpoints, 
unique opportunities for cultural develop-
ment, and myriad avenues for intellectual 
activity, and regulation of the internet must 
be tailored to supporting those activities. 
‘‘(4) The internet and other interactive 
computer services have flourished, to the 
benefit of all Americans, with a minimum of 
government 
regulation, 
and 
regulation 
should be limited to what is necessary to 
preserve the societal benefits provided by

SEC. 3219L. SENSE OF SENATE ON ALLOCATION 
OF SPECIAL DRAWING RIGHTS BY 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
RELATING TO COVID–19 PANDEMIC. 
It is the sense of the Senate that— 
(1) it is in the strategic interests of the 
United States to help ensure that COVID–19 
vaccines are available to other countries, 
particularly poorer countries with limited 
resources, not only as a timely live-saving 
and humanitarian measure, but also as the 
best way to protect hard-fought gains made 
against the pandemic in the United States; 
(2) the people of the United States will 
never be fully protected against the COVID– 
19 pandemic until the pandemic is also 
brought under control through vaccination 
around the world; 
(3) the release of Special Drawing Rights 
by the International Monetary Fund, as was 
done after the 2008 global economic crisis, is 
a no-cost way to help poorer countries pro-
cure COVID–19 vaccines and protect against 
the instability caused by a severe economic 
downturn; 
(4) helping protect against another global 
economic meltdown by releasing Special 
Drawing Rights is also a way to help protect 
United States export jobs at home, and why 
the move is supported by leaders of United 
States businesses and labor organizations;

(5) any allocations of Special Drawing 
Rights approved by the International Mone-
tary Fund to help with the purchase of

nomic impact of the pandemic should in-
clude ongoing efforts to discourage countries 
that are allies of the United States from ex-

Congress that— 
(1) the modernization of the land-based 
intercontinental ballistic missile, ballistic 
missile 
submarines, 
and 
nuclear-capable 
heavy bomber aircraft is essential to main-
taining a competitive edge over the People’s 
Republic of China and providing security for 
allies of the United States in the region; 
(2) continued support for the moderniza-
tion of the nuclear triad will be a necessary 
consideration during ratification of any fu-
ture arms control treaty with the People’s 
Republic of China; 
(3) the nuclear forces of the People’s Re-
public of China will significantly evolve over 
the decade after the date of the enactment of 
this Act as the People’s Republic of China 
modernizes, diversifies, and increases the 
number of its land-, sea-, and air-based nu-
clear delivery platforms; 
(4) the People’s Republic of China is pur-
suing a nuclear triad with the development 
of a nuclear-capable air-launched ballistic 
missile and improving its ground and sea- 
based nuclear capabilities; and 
(5) new developments in 2019 further sug-
gest that the People’s Republic of China in-
tends to increase the peacetime readiness of 
its nuclear forces by moving to a launch-on- 
warning posture with an expanded silo-based 
force. 
(b) STATEMENT OF POLICY.—It is the policy 
of the United States— 
(1) to advance the strategic deterrence ca-
pabilities of the United States both quan-
titatively and qualitatively; 
(2) to ensure the safety, reliability, and 
performance of the nuclear forces of the 
United States; 
(3) to fully modernize the United States 
nuclear triad as needed to maintain the pre-
mier nuclear force on the planet; and 
(4) that any new nuclear arms limitation 
treaties must include the People’s Republic 
of China before ratification.

SEC. llll. UNITED STATES GRAND STRATEGY 
WITH RESPECT TO CHINA. 
(a) FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.— 
(1) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
(A) The United States is in a new era of 
geostrategic and geoeconomic competition 
with the People’s Republic of China, a great 
power that seeks to challenge international 
norms, laws and institutions, and confront 
the United States across diplomatic, eco-
nomic, military, technological, and informa-
tional domains. 
(B) As it has during previous periods of 
great power competition, the United States 
must articulate and refine its grand strat-
egy, including through rigorous testing of 
assumptions and by drawing on expertise 
outside the United States Government, to 
ensure its ultimate success, as well as global 
peace, stability, and shared prosperity. 
(C) In January 1950, President Truman re-
quested an in-depth report on the state of 
the world, actions taken by adversaries of 
the United States, and the development of a 
comprehensive national strategy, resulting 
in a paper entitled ‘‘United States Objectives 
and Programs for National Security’’, also 
known as NSC-68. 
(D) President Eisenhower utilized experts 
from both within and outside the United 
States Government during Project Solarium 
to produce NSC 162/2, a ‘‘Statement of Policy 
by the National Security Council on Basic 
National Security Policy’’ in order to ‘‘meet 
the Soviet Threat to U.S. security’’ and 
guide United States national security policy. 
(E) President Ford authorized the Team B 
project to draw in experts from outside the 
United States Government to question and 
strengthen the analysis of the Central Intel-
ligence Agency. 
(F) A model for United States strategy on 
a great power competitor is the January 17, 
1983, National Security Decision Directive 
Number 75, approved by President Reagan, to 
organize United States strategy toward the 
Soviet Union in order to clarify and orient 
United States policies towards specific objec-
tives vis a vis the Soviet Union. 
(2) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that the United States should draw 
upon previous successful models of grand 
strategy to articulate a strategy that appro-
priately addresses the evolving challenges 
and contours of the new era of geostrategic 
and geoeconomic competition with the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China.

Tuesday, May 25, 2021 
Mr. 
LARSON

Connecticut. 
Madam

horrific shootings in Atlanta, Georgia, on 
March 16, 2021, and reaffirming the House of 
Representative’s commitment to combating 
hate, bigotry, and violence against the Asian- 
American and Pacific Islander community. I 
fully condemn the shootings in Atlanta on 
March 16, 2021, and stand fully committed to 
combating hate, bigotry, and violence against 
the Asian-American and Pacific Islander com-
munity. Had I been present for this vote, I 
would have voted AYE on roll call vote 149.

RECOGNIZING CAPTAIN JOHN 
MARSHALL BRANCH 
HON. EARL L. ‘‘BUDDY’’ CARTER 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 25, 2021 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize Captain John Mar-
shall Branch for twenty-six years of excep-
tional service to our country. 
Captain Branch was commissioned in 1995 
after earning a Bachelor of Science in Man-
agement from the U.S. Coast Guard Academy 
in New London, Connecticut. 
Since then, he has over three thousand and 
five hundred hours of flight experience, served 
at six air stations, and deployed to six of the 
seven continents. 
From 2016 to 2018, Captain Branch served 
as the Commanding Officer of Air Station Sa-
vannah, successfully supporting hurricane and 
disaster response, search and rescue, and law 
enforcement in the southeast, as well as air-
space protection for the President and Na-
tional Capital Region. 
Captain Branch has a long list of military ac-
complishments, including the Korea Defense 
Service Medal, two Commendation medals, 
the Antarctic Service Medal, and the Achieve-
ment Medal, amongst others. 
I am proud to rise today to honor Captain 
Branch for his leadership, and commitment to 
our country. I want to thank Captain Branch 
and his family for his service. 
INTRODUCING HOUSE RESOLUTION 
SUPPORTING 
THE 
GOALS 
AND 
IDEALS 
OF 
NATIONAL 
POPPY 
DAY 
HON. ANDRE´ CARSON 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 25, 2021 
Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to re-introduce a resolution recognizing 
and supporting the goals and ideals of Na-
tional Poppy Day, May 28. The importance of 
this day cannot be overstated. It’s a day full of 
respect and remembrance for servicemembers 
who sacrificed so much for our Nation. The 
poppy flower has long been a marker of re-
spect and a way to raise awarerness and sup-
port for members of our Nation’s veterans 
communities, servicemembers, and their fami-
lies. On May 28, we share our respect for their 
work on behalf of our country by acknowl-
edging the poppy flower’s symbolism, and by 
recognizing their sacrifices—all by donning our 
‘‘poppy red.’’ 
The red-flowered corn poppy became sym-
bolic as a living representation of the brave 
soldiers who paid the ultimate sacrifice on the 
fields of battle in World War I. Since that time, 
the red of the poppy flower—itself a symbol of 
the blood shed by those who have served— 
has been worn as a gesture of gratitude and 
recognition of others’ respective sacrifices for 
their country, in different theaters of war. 
In the United States, The American Le-
gion—and the entire American Legion Fam-
ily—first called attention in 1920 to the sym-
bolic importance of the poppy flower. At that 
time, near the end of the war, red-flowered 
corn poppies were especially linked to the 
poem In Flanders Fields, which reads: 
‘‘In Flanders Fields the poppies blow, be-
tween the crosses, row on row’’ 
This reference, evoking images of the pop-
pies that sprang up in the churned-up earth of 
newly dug soldiers’ graves in parts of Belgium 
and France following World War I, encap-
sulates the symbolic importance of National 
Poppy Day. 
I am proud to have partnered with The 
American Legion on this bill as their head-
quarters is in Indianapolis, in my district, and 
we invite all Members of Congress to wear 
their poppy red, support the goal and ideals of 
National Poppy Day on May 28, and pay trib-
ute to those who have sacrificed for our coun-
try. I also invite all of my colleagues to join me 
in sponsoring this resolution. 
INTRODUCTION 
OF 
THE 
WOMEN 
WHO 
WORKED 
ON 
THE 
HOME 
FRONT WORLD WAR II MEMO-
RIAL ACT 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 25, 2021 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the Women Who Worked on the 
Home Front World War II Memorial Act, which 
would authorize the establishment of a memo-
rial on federal land in the District of Columbia 
commemorating the efforts of the 18 million 
American women who kept the home front 
running during World War II. I thank Senators 
TAMMY DUCKWORTH and MARSHA BLACKBURN 
for introducing the companion bill in the Sen-
ate. The House passed this bill by voice vote 
last Congress. 
As a teenager, Raya Kenney, the founder of 
the non-profit Women Who Worked on the 
Home Front Foundation and my constituent, 
came up with the idea of a memorial to honor 
the women on the home front who supported 
the World War II effort. She rightfully ques-
tioned why the women on the home front 
whose efforts were so instrumental in main-
taining the stability of the country during World 
War II have not received as much recognition 
for their contributions as the men who fought 
bravely in World War II. 
This bill would authorize the Women Who 
Worked on the Home Front Foundation to es-
tablish a memorial to honor these women. The 
memorial is designed to be interactive and to 
educate visitors on the important roles women 
played during World War II. Between 1940 
and 1945, the percentage of women in the 
workforce increased from 27 percent to nearly 
37 percent, and by 1945 one in four married 
women worked outside of the home. The work 
done by women on the home front opened 
doors for women in the workplace widely and 
had a profound effect on the job market going 
forward. As a result of their efforts, millions of 
American women on the home front redefined 
‘‘women’s work’’ and paved the way for future 
generations. 
Many women also played critical roles in 
support of the war effort. More than 10,000 
women served behind the scenes of World 
War II as code breakers. Due to the classified 
nature of their work, they did not receive rec-
ognition for their tireless efforts until recently. 
Women were also trained to fly military aircraft 
so male pilots could leave for combat duty 
overseas. More than 1,100 female civilian vol-
unteers flew nearly every type of military air-
craft as part of the Women Airforce Service 
Pilots (WASP) program. WASP flew planes 
from factories to bases, transported cargo and 
participated in simulation strafing and target 
missions. These women were not given full 
military status until 1977, and it was not until 
2010 that they were recognized with the Con-
gressional Gold Medal.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E572 
May 25, 2021 
Women have been historically underrep-
resented in our memorials, particularly the me-
morials on federal land in the nation’s capital. 
It is fitting to authorize a memorial that would 
allow millions of visitors to D.C. to understand 
and honor the heroic efforts of these women 
and their lasting impact on the fabric of our 
society. 
I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

RECOGNIZING MR. RAVINDER 
SINGH SHERGILL 
HON. DAVID G. VALADAO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 25, 2021 
Mr. VALADAO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in honor of the life of Mr. Ravinder 
Singh Shergill, who passed away on April 22, 
2021. 
Mr. Shergill was born on September 12, 
1956, in Punjab, India. At the age of seven-
teen, he immigrated to the United States and 
later graduated from UC Berkeley with a 
Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering. 
He went on to work for National Semicon-
ductor for more than three decades. As an en-
gineer, Mr. Shergill held patents involving disk 
storage and helped create the USB specifica-
tions. As a manager, he admired and re-
spected as a mentor to his colleagues. His 
story is truly an embodiment of the American 
Dream. 
Mr. Shergill had a great appreciation for 
America, but he never forgot his roots. He was 
committed to bridging the Sikh and American 
communities together and was a founding 
member of the Sikh Youth of California and 
America. 
Mr. Shergill is remembered as a caring hus-
band, father, and grandfather with a love for 
books, history, music, and film. He is survived 
by his wife, Grace Rosa; his children, Simren, 
Kiren, and Kevan; and his grandchildren 
Leena, Mary, Samuel, and Briya. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the 
United States House of Representatives to 
join me in honoring the life of Mr. Ravinder 
Singh Shergill. Our thoughts and prayers are 
with his family and friends during this difficult 
time.

HONORING 
NEW 
YORK’S 
BRAVE 
FIRST 
RESPONDERS, 
PARA-
MEDICS, 
EMERGENCY 
MEDICAL 
TECHNICIANS 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 25, 2021 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor New York’s brave First Re-
sponders, Paramedics, and Emergency Med-
ical Technicians as we celebrate National 
Emergency Medical Services Week. I recog-
nize the great impact and sacrifice our EMS 
providers make to keep our communities safe. 
EMS systems provide lifesaving care and 
are an integral part of our communities’ 
wellbeing. Emergency medical responders are 
first on the scene of what is often the worst 
days of people’s lives. Despite the great phys-
ical and mental toll, EMS providers continu-
ously put the care of others before them-
selves. Their selfless perseverance and rig-
orous training allow them to be prepared for 
any situation. I am profoundly grateful for all 
those who choose to serve our community in 
this way. 
The 21st Congressional District of New York 
is home to the oldest continuously run com-
mercial ambulance service in the country. 
Guilfoyle Ambulance was established in 1907 
and is currently owned and operated by Bruce 
G. Wright. The first ambulance was a horse 
drawn carriage and the business now boasts 
16 ambulances. Today, Guilfoyle is certified at 
the Paramedic level and provides basic and 
advanced life support transportation as well as 
Paramedic service for over 8,500 requests 
and over 600 transports each year. The com-
pany operates in the majority of Jefferson 
County, including Fort Drum, as well as in 
some neighboring towns in St. Lawrence. 
Lewis, and Oswego Counties. Guilfoyle is just 
one of the many critical components of our 
EMS systems in the 21st District. 
On behalf of New York’s 21st Congressional 
District, I am proud to represent thousands of 
hardworking EMS providers and I am honored 
to recognize them on this National Emergency 
Medical Services Week. I thank them for safe-
guarding our community.

CONGRATULATING UNIVERSITY OF 
COLORADO’S SENIOR STRATEGIC 
ADVISOR 
AND 
FORMER 
VICE 
CHANCELLOR, FRANCES DRAPER, 
ON HER RETIREMENT 
HON. JOE NEGUSE 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 25, 2021 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, today I wish 
to honor and thank a Boulder Colorado trail-
blazer: Frances Draper. It’s hard to distill such 
a luminous human into a few short para-
graphs. Frances is equal parts tough and kind; 
cooperative and indomitable; pragmatic and 
optimistic. ‘‘There’s a pony in here for every-
one,’’ is Frances’s way of pointing out that by 
working together—by seeking to collaborate 
rather than divide—we can almost always get 
to win-win outcomes. 
In her role at the University of Colorado- 
Boulder, Frances reimagined and transformed 
the way that the city and the University col-
laborate, and ushered in a spirit of teamwork 
in town-and-gown relations that serves as a 
model for our Nation. She has served as a 
beacon of opportunity and decency in our 
community, representing the university and the 
city with honor, integrity and humanity. 
Prior to joining the university, Frances was 
Executive Director of the Boulder Economic 
Council, manager of the Sun Microsystems 
business and finance line for General Electric, 
and a legislative aide to Harrison Schmidt, 
U.S. Senator from New Mexico. Frances has 
lived in Boulder for close to 40 years, during 
which time she served on crucial local boards 
such as Foothills United Way, Naturally Boul-
der, I Have a Dream, and Boulder Rotary. She 
was also instrumental in establishing CO- 
Labs, a consortium of Colorado-based re-
search laboratories. 
Neither the city of Boulder, nor the Univer-
sity of Colorado-Boulder, would be what they 
are today without Frances’ wisdom, gen-
erosity, and tireless advocacy. Frances is the 
kind of person who makes the world a better 
place as she goes, and in doing so, inspires 
those around her to rise similarly to that en-

RECOGNIZING MAY AS SAVE YOUR 
TOOTH MONTH 
HON. JANICE D. SCHAKOWSKY 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 25, 2021 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Save Your Tooth Month. 
This month celebrates Americans saving their 
natural teeth and recognizes the ‘‘savers’’— 
endodontists—who make this possible. 
The more than 5,000 endodontists in the 
U.S. play an important role in providing oral 
health care throughout our country, spread 
awareness about practicing good oral hygiene, 
and emphasize the value of retaining one’s 
natural teeth and smile. 
Endodontists are dentists that specialize in 
diagnosing and treating tooth pain and per-
forming root canal treatment. Following the 
dental school, endodontists have completed 
an additional 2 to 3 years of advanced train-
ing. This gives them enhanced precision, mak-
ing them highly skilled in performing complex 
treatments. 
Teeth are a gateway to nutrition, a sign of 
emotion, and a signal of overall good health. 
We all feel better when our teeth are clean 
and pain-free. And although dentures can 
work well and have improved significantly, 
they are never as good as a full set of natural 
teeth. Our natural teeth are worth saving, and 
endodontists focus their careers solely on 
doing just that. 
Nothing looks, feels, or functions like your 
natural tooth. Regular brushing and flossing, 
along with 6-month check-ups from your den-
tist, can help you keep your teeth for a life-
time. It is worth the extra few minutes each 
day to maintain good oral hygiene. 
If you do experience issues with your teeth, 
seek out proper dental care. In particular, if 
you have tooth pain, you can seek treatment 
from an endodontist. Endodontists use the 
most current and advanced technology to treat 
dental patients. 
It should be noted that it is extremely safe 
to visit the endodontist during the COVID–19 
pandemic, with endodontists practicing the ut-
most caution and disinfection protocol. Even at 
the height of America’s spring 2020 shutdown, 
most endodontic practices remained open to 
safely treat dental emergencies. 
Thank you to all the endodontists for your 
dedicated work in helping us maintain our nat-
ural teeth. Happy Save Your Tooth Month.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 150TH AN-
NIVERSARY OF THE WAUPACA 
FIRE DEPARTMENT 
HON. MIKE GALLAGHER 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 25, 2021 
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise in celebration of the 150th Anniversary of 
the Waupaca Fire Department. The Waupaca 
Fire Department was formed shortly after the 
founding of the city of Waupaca on May 11th, 
1871. As the Waupaca community celebrates 
this milestone, we look back on the out-
standing history of the department and critical 
role they have played in the community. 
Throughout their history the department has 
grown immensely and now provides service to 
approximately 150 square miles. For 150 
years, the department has remained com-
mitted to serving the city of Waupaca and sur-
rounding communities to the highest degree. 
In total, the Waupaca Fire Department’s Fire 
Inspection Division works incredibly hard to 
keep the community safe, conducting an im-
pressive 550 inspections for commercial busi-
ness in 2019 alone. Their work demonstrates 
not only the amount of expertise and knowl-
edge the department holds, but the impor-
tance the department places on keeping their 
communities safe. 
Over the last 150 years, the department has 
faced many challenges, but their efforts to 
give back to the community have never 
wavered. From participating in the Annual Bat-
tle of the Badges Softball Tournament, where 
the Fire Department takes on the Police De-
partment, to hosting corn roasts and raffles, 
the Waupaca Fire Department is a true pillar 
of the community and Northeast Wisconsin. 
Many Waupaca families have benefited from 
the department’s thoughtfulness and gen-
erosity. When the department is not fighting 
fires and saving lives, their members donate 
their time and efforts to making Waupaca a 
better place. The department played a key 
role in countless improvements around the 
city, such as the playground in South Park 
and the construction of multiple shelter homes. 
I commend the department’s dedication and 
commitment to the Waupaca community. The 
Waupaca Fire Department supplies the com-
munity with incredibly trained individuals who 
are able to handle fire and other emergencies 
at a moment’s notice. It is evident that the 
knowledge, dedication, and perseverance con-
veyed through the men and women of this de-
partment are deserving of the highest degree 
of admiration. 
I invite all members of this body to join me 
in celebrating the sesquicentennial of the 
Waupaca Fire Department. The Waupaca Fire 
Department is a true credit to the community 
and deserving of the highest degree of rec-
ognition.

RECOGNIZING THE WEST COAST 
UNIVERSITY—TEXAS 
HEALTH-
CARE HEROES APPRECIATION 
HON. BETH VAN DUYNE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 25, 2021 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Madam Speaker, on be-
half of the 24th Congressional District of the 
U.S. House of Representatives and all of the 
communities that Dallas Medical Center and 
Dallas Regional Medical Center serve, and the 
West Coast University—Texas students pur-
suing careers in healthcare at a time when we 
need them more than ever, it is an honor and 
a privilege to have the opportunity to person-
ally thank them and all of our healthcare he-
roes for their service and selfless acts of 
caregiving during this pandemic. 
These frontline caregivers demonstrate tre-
mendous courage and put themselves on the 
line every day to ensure the health and safety 
of our community. 
During the last 15 months, the effects of the 
Covid pandemic required a personal sacrifice 
from each one of them unlike any other time 
in our country’s history. These frontline 
healthcare workers experienced long, long 
hours for months on end, caring for thousands 
of critical patients, and losing more life than 
anyone can bear to witness. 
These nurses and staff provided care for 
others while worried about their own health 
and the well-being of their family. Yet, they 
came to work every day. 
For their uncommon bravery and resilience, 
I say ‘‘thank you!’’ 
To express this appreciation, thess certifi-
cates commemorate the healthcare heroes at 
Dallas Medical Center and Dallas Regional 
Medical Center. 
In addition, I have another certificate to rec-
ognize the students of West Coast Univer-
sity—Texas, which focuses on educating and 
training the next generation of nurses and 
healthcare workers. These students have cho-
sen to pursue careers in healthcare despite 
witnessing one of the most challenging times 
in the history of their profession. I have deep 
respect for their courage and service to our 
community. 
Words are not enough to express the grati-
tude that I feel for the healthcare workers 
throughout the Dallas-Fort Worth area, the 
State of Texas, and across the country. 
All of them deserve to be honored and cele-
brated.

RECOGNIZING CAPTAIN STELLA 
MELANSON 
HON. EARL L. ‘‘BUDDY’’ CARTER 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 25, 2021 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize and honor Captain 
Stella Melanson for her remarkable career 
with the Hinesville Police Department. 
Captain Melanson began working at the 
Hinesville Police Department in 1976 and be-
came Hinesville’s first certified female peace 
officer. 
Over the past 43 years there has not been 
one area of the police department that Captain 
Melanson has not been involved in. 
She has served on patrol, within the Detec-
tive’s Division, Administrative Services Divi-
sion, and was a founding member of the Tri- 
County Protective Agency for domestic vio-
lence victims. Captain Melanson would humbly 
argue that she does not play a big role within 
the police department, but her lifelong service 
proves otherwise. 
During her time, she has provided the 
Hinesville Police Department with tremendous 
leadership and management. 
She has dedicated her life to protecting and 
serving others and I thank her for her 43 years 
of service.

INTRODUCTION OF THE NATIONAL 
CENTER 
FOR 
THE 
ADVANCE-
MENT OF AVIATION ACT OF 2021 
HON. ANDRE´ CARSON 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 25, 2021 
Mr. CARSON. Madam Speaker, today I join 
my colleagues, Rep. DON YOUNG of Alaska, 
Chairman Emeritus of the Transportation 
Committee, and Rep. RICK LARSEN, Chairman 
of the Aviation Subcommittee, in re-introducing 
the bipartisan and bicameral National Center 
for the Advancement of Aviation Act of 2021. 
Our committee has worked for years to make 
American skies the safest in the world, and to 
strengthen the industry workforce to maintain 
the highest standards of aviation excellence. 
Our legislation, the National Center for the 
Advancement of Aviation (NCAA) would sup-
port and promote collaboration amongst civil, 
commercial, and military aviation sectors to 
address the demands and challenges associ-
ated with ensuring a safe and vibrant national 
aviation system through research, education, 
and training. 
Too often in the past, innovation and les-
sons learned in various aviation sectors has 
not been shared in a collaboratively or timely 
manner, especially considering rapid develop-
ments in new technology. Our bill helps break 
down silos across commercial aviation, gen-
eral aviation and military aviation sectors that 
will not only improve safety and best practices, 
but also expand opportunities for those inter-
ested in the aviation workforce—for the young 
and not so young, from those just starting out, 
to those with experience who want to move 
into other types of aviation work. 
The National Center would focus on four 
key areas with an emphasis on aviation work-
force development. First, it would support edu-
cation efforts and provide resources to cur-
riculum developers so educators at all levels 
have the tools and training to educate the next 
generation of aviation professionals. 
Second, the national center would provide a 
forum 
to 
leverage 
and 
share 
expertise 
amongst industry sectors including the dis-
semination of existing high school education 
curriculum to develop and deploy a workforce 
of pilots, aerospace engineers, unmanned air-
craft system operators, aviation maintenance 
technicians, or other aviation maintenance 
professionals needed in the coming decades. 
Third, it would serve as a central repository 
for economic and safety data research and 
analysis allowing a comprehensive perspective 
of industry information that would improve 
safety for all stakeholders. 
Finally, it would support symposiums and 
conferences to facilitate collaboration across 
the industry and develop future advancements 
for the aviation and aerospace community. 
This legislation would also allow the FAA to 
focus on safety, certification, and air traffic op-
erations. 
The national center would be funded by 
using a small percentage of the interest ac-
crued annually on the taxes and fees collected 
from users of our aviation system and depos-
ited into the aviation trust fund. In other words,

CALLING ON THE NEED FOR COM-
PREHENSIVE 
MENTAL 
HEALTH 
LEGISLATION 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 25, 2021 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to call my colleagues’ attention to the dire 
need for Congress to continue building upon 
recent investments in mental health care. 
The American Rescue Plan funding for the 
Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services 
Administration is commendable but Congress 
must hone its focus to address this ongoing 
crisis by working to create and pass com-
prehensive mental health legislation. 
I, alongside Members of the Congressional 
Mental Health Caucus and the Bipartisan 
Mental Health and Addiction Taskforce, are 
working to pull together key pieces of legisla-
tion to establish a comprehensive Mental 
Health Crisis Response Act. 
I ask my colleagues, both Democrats and 
Republicans, to please work with us and send 
bills our way to present to leadership and the 
White House, as the fundamentals of our so-
cial economy depend on the good health of 
our citizenry and their ability to access quality 
and affordable behavioral health services. 
Throughout my 38 years in Congress, I 
have heard countless stories from constituents 
who face barriers when accessing essential 
mental health services. We must work to over-
come these issues. 
Further, we must enhance our Nation’s ca-
pacity to address the negative social and 
physical determinants of health that cause 
trauma and behavioral health problems, as 
well as deploy more effective upstream pre-
vention strategies. 
It’s past time for Congress to take meaning-
ful action, targeting provider shortages, reim-
bursement parity, housing support, treatment, 
and increased Federal funding to push the 
bounds of Federal research. 
Full recovery from the pandemic will be con-
tingent upon addressing the behavioral health 
conditions of our population, because mental 
health is public health.

HONORING BLACK DOCTORS 
COVID–19 CONSORTIUM 
HON. DWIGHT EVANS 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 25, 2021 
Mr. EVANS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor The Black Doctors COVID–19 Consor-
tium who leveraged their medical expertise 
and connections to facilitate testing and pro-
vide vaccines where measures are most need-
ed in the Philadelphia region. They stepped up 
to level the playing field by testing and vacci-
nating thousands of people in at-risk commu-
nities. 
Surgeon Ala Stanford along with a dedi-
cated team of volunteers have sought to elimi-
nate health disparities during the Covid–19 
pandemic. The Black Doctors COVID–19 Con-
sortium was founded by Dr. Stanford in the 
spring of 2020, to address the lack of Covid– 
19 testing in low-income and communities of 
color in Philadelphia, who also happened to 
have the highest positivity rates. Their efforts 
undoubtedly saved countless lives. 
Dr. Stanford left her role as a pediatric sur-
geon to dedicate her time to aggressively con-
front the growing health disparities in Black 
communities during the pandemic. According 
to the Centers for Disease Control—Black pa-
tients represent 22 percent of Covid cases 
and are 2.8 times more likely to be hospital-
ized and 1.9 times more likely to die due to 
Covid–19 as compared to White Americans. 
These starks figures are what drove Dr. Stan-
ford to create the formation of BDCC. She de-
clared, ‘‘There was no testing in communities 
where people were dying the most. So, we 
created it.’’ Her work has been invaluable to 
the city of Philadelphia, particularly for low-in-
come and vulnerable residents. 
The consortium has tested more than 
25,000 people and vaccinated more than 
50,000 Philadelphians at 50 clinics. It also of-
fers home vaccinations for people who can’t 
access clinics. These services have been pro-
vided free to the public. They have recently 
partnered with Uber to provide 10,000 free 
rides aimed at helping people get to and from 
BDCC sites. Their work has drawn praise from 
the Biden’s administration top health officials. 
‘‘She is the perfect example of how a commu-
nity member can stand up and lead during a 
time of crisis,’’ Surgeon General Vivek Murthy 
said. 
The Black Doctors COVID–19 Consortium 
held a ‘‘vaxathon’’ a 24-hour, walk-up vaccine 
site, which saw a massive turnout. The group 
vaccinated nearly 4,000 people, 75 percent of 
whom were people of color. It was a wildly 
successful event designed to increase the

number of vaccinations given to Black Phila-
delphians and to reduce the vaccination dis-
parity between White and Black Philadel-
phians. 
Dr. Ala Stanford is the recipient of several 
awards including the Health Equality Advocate 
award, and she is a decorated and revered 
physician who is considered a champion for 
health equity and access. She is a native of 
North Philadelphia who pours her all into cre-
ating wellness outcomes for her communities. 
Her accolades are lengthy, and she’s the first 
Black woman pediatric surgeon trained entirely 
in the United States. She’s board certified by 
the American Board of Surgery in both pedi-
atric and adult surgery. 
With all her accomplishments and commu-
nity work, Dr. Stanford has received a great 
deal of national media attention for her phe-
nomenal work with the BDCC in providing 
care during the pandemic. Her work is re-
garded as a model for sound community 
health engagement. Assistant U.S. Secretary 
of Health Dr. Rachel Levin stated: ‘‘The Black 
Doctors COVID–19 Consortium is such a fan-
tastic example of how we’re going to reach in-
dividuals in their communities with messages 
from people that they know and people that 
they trust—trusted messengers like Dr. Stan-
ford.’’ 
The Third Congressional District of Pennsyl-
vania extends gratitude to the Black Doctors 
COVID–19 and Dr. Ala Stanford for their dedi-
cated support and extraordinary service to the 
people of Philadelphia in their effort to provide 
testing and expand access and equitable dis-
tribution of the coronavirus vaccine.

HONORING ASIAN AMERICAN PA-
CIFIC ISLANDERS IN SAN ANTO-
NIO 
HON. JOAQUIN CASTRO 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 25, 2021 
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in honor of the Asian American and 
Pacific Islanders (AAPIs) in San Antonio, 
Texas, and across the United States. Since 
1977, every May, we celebrate and recognize 
the accomplishments of AAPI communities. 
Though a modest population, we have a vi-
brant community of AAPIs in San Antonio that 
contribute greatly to our city’s prosperity. 
Since 1860s, immigrants of Asian descent 
began migrating to Texas and Southwestern 
States and today the AAPI community account 
for 5 percent of the total population in Texas, 
and it’s one of the fastest growing commu-
nities in the United States. Like many immi-
grants, Asian Americans were often unwel-
come and suffered racism and discrimination. 
For example, the Chinese Exclusion Act of 
1882 prohibited individuals arriving or staying 
in the United States solely based on their eth-
nicity. 
Today, AAPI communities continue to face 
discrimination and even violence, which is 
often underreported. During COVID–19, hate 
crimes against AAPIs have grown exponen-
tially and the community is still living in fear. 
In recognition of the continued threats that 
AAPI communities endure, Congress passed 
legislation that President Biden signed into law 
to ensure hate crimes against AAPIs are in-
vestigated and prosecuted. Our Nation must 
come together and work to address centuries 
of discrimination that impedes our Nation from 
its full promise of equality and justice for all. 
Over the generations, AAPI communities 
have made significant contributions in the arts, 
government, business, medicine, and edu-
cation. In San Antonio, our city is led by Ron 
Nirenberg, the city’s first mayor of Asian de-
scent. I’m also particularly proud of AAPI vet-
erans, including 33 individuals who have been 
awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor, 
and also AAPI men and women who serve our 
Nation in uniform. 
Madam Speaker, I am grateful for our Na-
tion’s AAPI communities, and I am proud to 
recognize their accomplishments. Thank you.

MILITARY APPRECIATION MONTH 
HON. ED CASE 
OF HAWAII 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 25, 2021 
Mr. CASE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor each and every person who wears a 
uniform or has served in our country’s Armed 
Forces and celebrate National Military Appre-
ciation Month. 
My home state of Hawaii is home to over 
142,000 military members, family and support 
personnel, making it the largest and most im-
portant multi-service military ‘ohana in the 
IndoPacific. We are deeply grateful to those 
who are regularly deployed to protect our Ha-
waii, along with the many more who are proud 
to volunteer their time, skills and abilities to 
the task of making our country and our world 
a better place for all. 
Just as crucial to the fabric of Hawaii’s mili-
tary community is the more than 108,000 vet-
erans who call Hawaii home. These men and 
women served with honor, and we must al-
ways ensure they are provided with the bene-
fits they so rightfully earned and deserve. 
I also want to extend my enduring gratitude 
to the families of our soldiers, sailors, marines, 
airmen and guardsmen who made the ultimate 
sacrifice for our nation. 
Freedom, justice equality—these are the 
values that the men and women of our Armed 
Forces are charged to preserve and protect. 
Each of us owes our very best efforts to en-
sure that America’s servicemembers can de-
fend our values. We must make sure they are 
mission-ready, with the training and equipment 
necessary to carry out their duties here in our 
country and overseas. 
As a member of the House Appropriations 
Subcommittee on Military Construction, Vet-
erans Affairs and Related Agencies, I am 
dedicated to properly supporting our present 
military members and their families and ful-
filling the promises made to our veterans. 
Their service deserves our nation’s respect 
and recognition not just for this month—but 
every day. 
Move forward with strength (Imua).

(FPS) in recognition of their service to our Na-
tion. After passing the Capitol security bill in 
this Chamber earlier this week, it is only nat-
ural that we highlight the work of our protec-
tion agencies and their commitment to the 
Federal workforce. As a former law enforce-
ment officer, I understand the pivotal role of 
security today more than ever. Following the 
U.S. Capitol attacks on January 6, we wit-
nessed firsthand how important it is to have 
law enforcement agencies like FPS to protect 
our Federal facilities and workforce. 
For half a century, FPS has served and pro-
tected the American people and government 
business with honor, integrity, and commit-
ment. Since its inception in 1971, FPS has 
contributed to the protection of people and 
property in the Federal Government by identi-
fying and mitigating vulnerabilities through risk 
assessments, law enforent, intelligence anal-
ysis, and security measures. Two major acts 
of terror against the United States have 
shaped FPS to anticipate emerging threats 
more effectively: the bombing of the Murrah 
Federal Building in Oklahoma City in 1995, 
and the terror attacks on September 11. 
Today, FPS provides the Department of 
Homeland Security Secretary with a highly 
trained, nationwide force that can support 
needs in countering emerging or existing 
threats and terrorism, within the boundaries of 
our Nation and territories. It is also responsible 
for protecting over 9,000 facilities and more 
than 1.4 million people who work, visit, or con-
duct business at these facilities each day. 
FPS has shown that it is a leader within the 
law enforcement and protection community. It 
is their work and dedication that brings us 
closer to the vision of a Federal workforce and 
workplace that is safe, secure, and resilient 
moving forward. 
Madam Speaker, I hope my colleagues will 
join me in recognizing one of our Nation’s 
most critical Federal agencies.

REMEMBERING AND HONORING 
MARY LOTT WALKER 
HON. EARL L. ‘‘BUDDY’’ CARTER 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 25, 2021 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today with a heavy heart to remember 
and honor Mary Lott Walker of Blackshear, 
Georgia who passed away on May 12th at the 
age of 85. 
Mary loved her city of Blackshear, her state 
of Georgia, and her country the United States 
of America devotedly. 
After graduating from Georgia State College 
for Women, Mary began her influential career 
in public education. 
Mary was also involved in politics, becoming 
the first woman in Blackshear to serve as 
Mayor pro-term. Through her work in Georgian 
education, politics, and historical preservation, 
Mary inspired young people to achieve great-
ness. 
Above all, she devoted more than 67 years 
of 
membership 
and 
leadership 
to 
the 
Blackshear Presbyterian Church. 
Mary’s profound community impacts will be 
felt for generations to come. 
My thoughts and prayers are with her fam-
ily, friends, and all who knew her during this 
most difficult time.

HONORING GOVERNOR CARLOS 
ROMERO-BARCELO´  
HON. DON YOUNG 
OF ALASKA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 25, 2021 
Mr. YOUNG. Madam Speaker, I rise con-
cerning the passing of my long-time friend and 
a great leader, Carlos Romero-Barcelo´, former 
governor of Puerto Rico. Carlos passed away 
on May 2, 2021 at the age of 88. I offer my 
deepest condolences to his family and loved 
ones, as well as those whose lives he im-
pacted during his tenure. 
Carlos Romero-Barcelo´ was a timeless cru-
sader for Puerto Rico. Throughout his life, he 
led the fight for equal recognition of Puerto 
Ricans, and I was especially proud to work 
with him while he served as the Resident 
Commissioner for the island in Congress. 
Carlos lived a life of public service for Puer-
to Rico. He served as Mayor of San Juan and 
then as Governor before being elected to be 
Resident Commissioner for Puerto Rico in 
1992. He dedicated his life to achieve equal 
rights for the U.S. citizens of Puerto Rico. I 
was truly honored to know him and call him a 
friend. 
I was proud to serve with him on the House 
Natural Resources Committee. There we 
worked together advocating for Puerto Rico, 
and I was proud to support his efforts to 
achieve equality for the U.S. Citizens of Puer-
to Rico. His tireless work deepened Puerto 
Rico’s relationship with the United States, and 
I was proud to stand by him as a leader of the 
island. 
We honor his legacy and mourn his loss 
alongside his family—his wife Kathleen, and 
his children Carlos, Andres, Juan Carlos, and 
Melinda—and our friends, the people of Puer-
to Rico. 
CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF MR. 
RICHARD BATES 
HON. TED LIEU 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 25, 2021 
Mr. LIEU. Madam Speaker, I rise to cele-
brate the life of Mr. Richard Bates, who 
passed away outside Washington, D.C., on 
December 31, 2020. He was a beloved hus-
band, father, and community member. 
Mr. Bates was born in Washington, D.C., on 
September 2, 1950 to Can and Sylvia Bates. 
In 1978, he married his best friend and the 
love of his life, Rose Bates. He served as ex-
ecutive director of the Democratic Congres-
sional Campaign Committee before joining the 
Walt Disney Company, where he worked for 
30 years. He opened Disney’s first Wash-
ington, D.C., office, and served as the Senior 
Vice President of Government Relations. 
Richard’s loved ones, friends, and col-
leagues remember him for his compassion, 
sense of humor, and kindness. He was a pas-
sionate advocate for the creative industries 
and was well-respected for his skill and knowl-
edge in his field. In 2018, he was elected to 
the board of trustees of an advocacy organiza-
tion fighting for free speech and working in 
communications policy issues, the Media Insti-
tute. Most importantly, he was dedicated to his 
friends and family, and inspired those around 
him to do what they love and follow their 
dreams. 
Richard is survived by his wife, Rose; two 
sons, Ricky (Noelle) and Chris; brother, Rob-
ert (Judith); and other relatives. He will also be 
missed by his canine-granddaughter, Betty.

HONORING IRIS TUN AS IOWAN OF 
THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 25, 2021 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize an outstanding member of our com-
munity, Iris Tun, by naming her for Iowan of 
the Week. 
Iris is a co-founder and a family advocate at 
the Ethnic Minorities of Burma Advocacy and 
Resource Center (EMBARC) of Iowa, which is 
Iowa’s first and only refugee-led service pro-
vider that strives to address shared issues and 
uplift all refugee communities. 
Refugees from Burma began arriving in 
Iowa in 2007 and 2008 as a priority class of 
refugees, part of the nearly 1.5 million refu-
gees that have fled Burma since the early 
1960s. EMBARC was created in 2012 to help 
these new refugees settle into Iowa. At first, 
Iris helped the team provide resources and 
videos translated from English to Burmese 
and Karen, but their operation has since ex-
panded. 
When 
the 
COVID–19 
pandemic 
hit, 
EMBARC Iowa got to work creating videos 
and 
informational 
resources 
about 
the 
COVID–19 virus and aid that was available in 
13 different languages to help those who had 
lost jobs, facing eviction and struggling with 
virtual schooling. Over the past year, more 
than 8,000 refugees and immigrants have re-
ceived support from EMBARC and RISE 
AmeriCorps members—95 percent of whom 
were essential workers. 
When Iris is not making videos for EMBARC 
Iowa, she translates voter registration forms at 
her church for free. In Iowa, it’s illegal for the 
state to translate official government forms, in-
cluding election forms, which makes it hard for 
non-fluent English speakers to collect voting 
information. 
As we celebrate Asian American and Pacific 
Islander Heritage Month, it’s important to note 
the difficulties the Asian American and Pacific 
Islander communities still face here in Amer-
ica. This week, the House passed the COVID– 
19 Hate Crimes Act to highlight the increased 
violence Asian American and Pacific Islanders 
have encountered since the beginning of the 
COVID–19 pandemic. 
Iris’s work is vital to putting an end to these 
hate crimes because her work as a translator 
allows folks to communicate and better under-
stand each other. That’s why I would like my 
colleagues to rise with me and recognize this 
exemplary woman, Iris Tun, as our Iowan of 
the Week.

CONGRATULATING 
MASTER 
SER-
GEANT LOUIS C. GRAZIANO ON 
HIS DECREE AND MEDAL AS A 
CHEVALIER IN THE ’ORDRE NA-
TIONAL 
DE 
LA 
LE´ GION 
D’HONNEUR’ 
HON. JODY B. HICE 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 25, 2021 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to pay tribute to Master Sergeant 
Luciano ‘‘Louis’’ C. Graziano, a resident of the 
Tenth Congressional District of Georgia and 
the last known surviving witness to the Ger-
man surrender of World War II. His story is 
truly incredible, and his contribution during his 
tour of duty with the U.S. Army in Europe is 
worthy of our nation’s everlasting gratitude. 
On June 6, 1944, D-Day, Louis was aboard 
a landing craft with his men and landed upon 
the sands of Omaha Beach in Normandy 
France. Once beached, Louis drove a truck 
full of gasoline onto the sand. With no place 
to go, he abandoned the vehicle and gathered 
his weapons to get into the fight. He took up 
a position at the base of a cliff and fired a 
burst from a flame thrower to take out a Ger-
man machinegun nest. 
But, Madam Speaker, further up the cliff 
were even more enemy machinegun nests. In 
quick thinking, Louis took a flare gun and fired 
a flare into those positions hoping to direct the 
fire of allied ships cruising just off the beach. 
The gun crews on the ships responded as 
hoped, unleashing their fire from larger caliber 
guns destroying those positions beyond. 
Advancing beyond the shores of Normandy, 
the French city of St. Lo and Reims were soon 
liberated. It was in Reims that Louis’s skill in 
his craft would come into play and eventually 
afford him a seat to history itself. Upon estab-
lishment of a command post within the heavily 
mined city, Louis was ordered to install Gen-
eral Eisenhower’s phone line. This phone line 
was vital for the General’s real time commu-
nication, helping to bring about a timelier allied 
victory.

May 25, 2021 
As allied forces fought to reclaim the town 
of Bastogne, the Germans mounted a last- 
ditch counteroffensive known as the ‘‘Battle of 
the Bulge.’’ In response, all troops were being 
mustered to come to the rescue of encircled 
troops near the Belgian town of Bastogne. In 
a dangerous mission, Louis and his Captain 
had to search and find the lost armored ele-
ment. They suffered frostbite, but their effort 
was successful. After, Louis returned to Reims 
to recover. 
Among the buildings in Reims, there was a 
‘‘Little Red Schoolhouse’’ where General Ei-
senhower had his headquarters. It was there 
that the unconditional surrender of Germany 
was signed in the early morning hours of Mon-
day, May 7, 1945. Louis was there, in the 
room, as General Yodl of the German Army 
signed the articles of surrender. 
Madam Speaker, Louis has served our Na-
tion with integrity, excellence, and courage, 
and we, as Americans, owe him an enormous 
debt of gratitude for his incredible sacrifices to 
serve and protect our country at home and 
abroad. He not only has earned the admiration 
of his fellow Americans but that of our allies 
as well. On April 6, 2021, French President 
Emmanuel Macron approved awarding him the 
French Legion d’honneur, which is the highest 
French order of merit that can be bestowed 
upon an individual. For these reasons, I am 
honored to represent him in Congress, and it 
is with pride that I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing the life and legacy of Mas-
ter Sergeant Luciano ‘‘Louis’’ C. Graziano.

CONGRATULATING THE TOWN OF 
CLAYTON ON THE COMPLETION 
OF 
THE 
CEROW 
RECREATION 
PARK ARENA RENOVATION 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 25, 2021 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate the Town of Clayton on 
the completion of the Cerow Recreation Park 
Arena addition and renovation project. Addi-
tionally, I rise to recognize Leonard ‘‘Obie’’ 
O’Brien as the new wing is dedicated in his 
honor. 
The renovation and addition were made 
possible through funding from the United 
States Department of Agriculture Rural Devel-
opment program. The Town of Clayton also 
received grants from Empire State Develop-
ment and the state Office of Parks, Recre-
ation, and Historical Preservation through the 
Regional Economic Development Council Ini-
tiative. I am grateful that these sources of 
funding are available to support infrastructure 
updates and economic development projects 
in rural areas such as our district. Community 
gathering spaces are the foundation of our 
North Country community and foster a sense 
of neighborly spirit. This renovation will also 
increase the economic impact made by the 
park arena, attracting more visitors and events 
to the space, promising prosperity for the 
Town. Local businesses truly are the back-
bone of the North Country and I will continue 
working in Congress to support them. 
The newly named Leonard ‘‘Obie’’ O’Brien 
wing is aptly dedicated in recognition of the 
many years of service Obie gave to the Clay-
ton sports community. Obie operated the girls’ 
basketball program for 25 years, Clayton 
Minor Hockey for 14 years, and the Clayton 
Youth Commission for 4 years. He founded 
the local Maverick Ski Club and was selected 
as Clayton’s Citizen of the Year in 2003. Re-
grettably, Obie passed away in June 2020 
after a battle with cancer before the comple-
tion of the renovation. With the many years 
Obie had spent in this complex, I believe he 
would be honored to be remembered so fond-
ly. 
On behalf of New York’s 21st Congressional 
District, I would like to congratulate the Town 
of Clayton on the successful completion of this 
project. I hope that every person who walks 
through these doors looks to the example that 
Obie left and embodies his love for the game 
and above all his kindness to everyone he en-
countered.

INTRODUCTION 
OF 
THE 
YOUNG 
AMERICANS 
FINANCIAL 
LIT-
ERACY ACT 
HON. ANDRE´ CARSON 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 25, 2021 
Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Madam Speaker, 
today I am pleased to re-introduce the Young 
Americans Financial Literacy Act. Financial lit-
eracy is critical to ensuring future financial re-
sponsibility. Studies have shown that 88 per-
cent of Americans believe finance education 
should be taught in schools and 92 percent of 
K–12 teachers believe that financial education 
should be taught in school, but only 12 per-
cent of teachers actually teach the subject. 
Yet, according to a 2020 survey, less than half 
of States require high school students to take 
a personal finance course, and less than 17 
percent of high school students were required 
to take a semester-long personal finance 
course. 
I believe that Congress has an opportunity 
and a responsibility to address the pressing 
needs of individuals faced with the loss of 
their financial stability and the challenges of 
economic uncertainty. This should include fi-
nancial literacy education reform and long- 
term solutions to prevent future personal finan-
cial disasters. Research-based financial lit-
eracy education programs are needed to 
reach individuals at all ages and socio-
economic levels, particularly those facing 
unique and challenging financial situations, 
such as high school graduates entering the 
workforce, soon-to-be and recent college grad-
uates and young families, and to address the 
unique needs of military personnel and their 
families. High school and college students 
who are exposed to cumulative financial edu-
cation show an increase in financial knowl-
edge, which in turn drives increasingly respon-
sible behavior as they become young adults. 
According to the Government Accountability 
Office, giving Americans the information they 
need to make effective financial decisions can 
be key to their well-being and to the country’s 
economic health. The global financial crisis, 
when many borrowers failed to fully under-
stand the risks associated with certain finan-
cial products, and currently, the economic 
hardships presented by the sudden disruptions 
caused by the spread of COVID–19, under-
score the need to improve individuals’ financial 
literacy and empower all Americans to make 
informed financial decisions. This is especially 
true for young people as they are earning their 
first paychecks, securing student aid, and es-
tablishing their financial independence. There-
fore, focusing economic education and finan-
cial literacy efforts and best practices for 
young people between the ages of 8 to 24 is 
of utmost importance. 
I believe America should be leading the 
world with the best-educated students who will 
drive our economic innovation and success, 
so please join me in cosponsoring the Young 
Americans Financial Literacy Act. This act: 
Establishes a grant program in the Bureau 
of Consumer Financial Protection to develop 
and implement financial literacy programs for 
young people ages 8 to 24, 
Incentivizes the development of partnerships 
between institutions of higher education, local 
educational agencies, nonprofit organizations, 
and financial institutions to develop programs 
aimed at young Americans in different phases 
of their life; 
Ensures the development of evidence-based 
instructional material that is geared towards 
targeted groups and addresses unique life sit-
uations, including bankruptcy, foreclosure, stu-
dent loans, credit card misuse; and 
Conducts ongoing assessment and account-
ability of the program over the short- and long- 
term to ensure that grant money achieves the 
greatest impact. 
I urge all of my colleagues to join me in 
supporting the Young Americans Financial Lit-
eracy Act.

Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Madam Speaker, 
it is with sincere appreciation that I recognize 
Dr. Diane Culpepper for her leadership and 
service as Executive Director of Lake Tech-
nical College. After more than a decade of 
service, Dr. Culpepper will retire from Lake 
Technical College this August. 
Dr. Culpepper earned both her bachelor’s 
degree in Business Administration and Mar-
keting and her master’s degree in Vocation 
Administration from the University of Central 
Florida. She earned her Ph.D. in Workforce 
Education from the University of South Florida.

has increased enrollment, fostered new part-
nerships with business and industry, and en-
hanced the quality of academic offerings. Most 
recently, at the direction of Dr. Culpepper, in

RECOGNIZING THE FIFTIETH ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE BEEF ’N’ BAR-
REL RESTAURANT 
HON. TOM REED 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 25, 2021 
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, today I rise to 
recognize the fiftieth anniversary of the Beef 
’N’ Barrel Restaurant in Olean, New York, and 
congratulate the owners, Jim, Mike, and PJ 
McAfee for reaching this milestone. 
The Beef ’N’ Barrel is a family-owned beef 
and steakhouse restaurant located at 146 
North Union Street in the Olean area that has 
been celebrated for years. During our visits to 
this establishment, we have been impressed 
by the ownership and staff, as well as the 
quality of service and products they provide. 
For fifty years, the restaurant has kept its 
doors open and satisfied customers, whether 
they were area visitors or life-long residents. 
The restaurant opened in May of 1965 
under the ownership of Neil and Denis 
Goodemote but was later sold to Jim McAfee 
in 1971. The restaurant has expanded over 
the years, from seating for fifty patrons to 
room for over three hundred in its current lo-
cation. 
The McAfee family has operated the Beef 
’N’ Barrel with hard work, dedication, and 
great effort over the years. We congratulate 
them on their extraordinary efforts to keep this 
restaurant growing and thriving, providing a 
delicious meal to all who visit. Whether it be 
a daily special, item from the beef bar, burger 
or other specialty, the quality of food and serv-
ice received is outstanding. 
Given the above, I ask that this Legislative 
Body join me to recognize the fiftieth anniver-
sary of the Beef ’N’ Barrel Restaurant in 
Olean, New York, and congratulate the own-
ers, Jim, Mike, and PJ McAfee for reaching 
this milestone.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF DOROTHY ANN MROWKA 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 25, 2021 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, it is with 
great sadness that I rise today to honor the 
life of the late Dorothy Ann Mrowka, of 
Colchester, Connecticut, who passed away at 
her home on April 29, 2021 at the age of 78. 
Known by everyone as Dot, her involvement in 
the civic and cultural communities of eastern 
Connecticut made her beloved by many. 
Born in New London, CT on October 13, 
1942, Dot spent her entire life in eastern Con-
necticut. Committed to education, she earned 
a Masters degree in Business Administration 
which lead to a successful career as a com-
puter programmer at AETNA insurance. She 
moved to Colchester in 1973 and then married 
her beloved husband Lucien Mrowka a short 
time later. They were married for 38 years be-
fore he sadly predeceased her in 2012. 
Truly, there is not an organization in 
Colchester that has not been touched by Dot. 
She was a devout parishioner at St. Andrews 
Church serving on the Ladies Guild and the 
First Friday Rosary Guild. Dot was an active 
member of both the St. Joseph’s Polish Soci-
ety and Colchester Grange No. 78. She was 
very involved with the Colchester Democratic 
Town Committee, and the Federation of 
Democratic Women. She was the recipient of 
the Ella Grasso award by Connecticut Demo-
crats not once, but twice and selected to serve 
on the Democratic State Central Committee. 
Her service to the community did not stop 
there. Dot was a fierce defender of a free and 
fair election and served Colchester residents 
as the Registrar of Voter for 25 years. Many 
happy marriages began with her proclamation 
of ‘‘I now pronounce you husband and wife’’ 
as she served as a Justice of the Peace. Her 
selfless service to her community is unparal-
leled. 
I met Dot early in my career in Congress, 
and her friendship over the years has been in-
valuable. There are few in this district that 
knew their community as well as Dot did. She 
was a tireless campaign volunteer who never 
shied away from all the ‘‘nuts and bolts’’ of or-
ganizing 
a 
headquarters, 
leading 
phone 
banks, lit drops or election day logistics. The 
election eve ‘‘get out the vote’’ spaghetti sup-
per at the Colchester Polish Club was a must 
stop for Democratic candidates at every 
level—including House Speaker NANCY PELOSI 
in 2006. The void her passing leaves is 
unmeasurable. I know her memory will con-
tinue through her family—her son Jeffrey Wat-
son; her daughter, Tammy and her husband 
Ricky Keller; her brother Joseph Ploszaj; her 
sisters Peggy Fedus and Mary Lou Johnson, 
and her two beloved grandchildren Tyler Kelly 
and Taylor Watson. 
Madam Speaker, it is an honor to represent 
constituents as honorable and impactful as 
Dot. While we all mourn her loss, we can at 
least find solace that her story, memory, and 
purpose lives on in through countless others. 
I find it fitting that we, the People’s House, 
add her name and character into the CON-
GRESSIONAL RECORD and ask that the entire 
House join me in recognizing the life of Doro-
thy Ann Mrowka, never forgetting the impor-
tance of building our connections with others.

CONGRATULATING THE REPUBLIC 
OF AZERBAIJAN 
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 25, 2021 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate the Republic of Azerbaijan on 
its 103rd anniversary of their annual Republic 
Day as well as its 30th anniversary of inde-
pendence from the Soviet Union. 
I do not want my good wishes to be seen 
as ignoring the issues currently going on be-
tween Azerbaijan and Armenia. I am putting 
my faith and confidence that the hostilities are 
resolved, and the appropriate borders will be 
restored. Independence for Azerbaijan is a 
time to reflect on the territorial sovereignty and 
right to independence for other nations as 
well, as liberty benefits everyone. 
Azerbaijan is an important partner in the re-
gion. I find this year’s occasion special be-
cause it marks 30 years since Soviet occupa-
tion. The Soviet Union and its ideas of com-
munism subjected millions of people to author-
itarian rule, stripping them of their natural, 
human rights. However, the people of Azer-
baijan have successfully emerged from this 
dark period in history and continue to be a 
shining example of democracy and independ-
ence. 
It’s important that the people of the United 
States recognize the nations that emerge from 
authoritarian rule to contribute to the ever- 
growing push for liberty and self-governance. 
Azerbaijan, after being subject to centuries of

USSR, were rewarded with the gift of inde-
pendence. That is why this week we can 
proudly stand with our friends in Azerbaijan to 
celebrate their 103rd Republic Day and share 
in our collective belief in freedom. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues 
to join me in celebrating Azerbaijan’s Republic 
Day and in recognizing our shared commit-
ment to freedom, democracy, and the principle 
of self-governance. I would like to share my 
most heartfelt congratulations on this momen-

REMEMBERING REV. E. BAXTER 
MORRIS 
HON. STENY H. HOYER 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 25, 2021 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I rise to pay 
tribute to the late Rev. E. Baxter Morris, who 
passed away on May 2. His funeral took place 
on Saturday, May 15, at the church that he led 
for nearly half a century. Many of us in this 
House knew Rev. Morris as a gracious host 
when we traveled to Montgomery, Alabama, 
on the annual Faith and Politics Institute Civil 
Rights Pilgrimage. He and his congregants at 
the historic First Baptist Church welcomed us 
with a very moving service followed by a 
home-cooked meal that made us feel like we 
were part of their community. I spoke with him 
at those lunches and, like so many others, 
came to see his wisdom, patience, and grace. 
I know that Rev. Morris, who was the con-
gregation’s longest-serving pastor, will be 
deeply missed by all who knew him and wor-
shiped with him. 
One of my most cherished memories of 
congressional pilgrimages to the First Baptist 
Church and other now-sacred places is shar-
ing the experience with my dear friend John 
Lewis. John would remind us of the time in 
youth when he helped organize and lead the 
Freedom Rides. That effort began 60 years 
ago this spring. In late May 1961, around 
1,500 community members, Freedom Riders, 
and civil rights activists had gathered to wor-
ship at First Baptist Church, when they were 
besieged by a mob of as many as 3,000 white 
supremacists. Joining John Lewis inside were 
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Fred Shuttlesworth, 
Diane Nash, James Farmer, and the Rev. 
Ralph Abernathy, who was the senior pastor 
of the church at that time. It took a historic 
intervention by President John F. Kennedy 
and Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, 
which involved calling out the Alabama Na-
tional Guard, to break that siege and save the 
lives of those inside. That incident, known now 
to history as the First Baptist Church Siege, 
was a pivotal moment in the effort to deseg-
regate public transportation across the South. 
Thus when Rev. Morris became the senior 
pastor of First Baptist Church in 1972, it al-
ready had a storied history. He did his utmost 
to preserve that history and ensure that his 
congregants and visitors alike never forgot the 
important role that First Baptist Church played 
in the march for freedom, equality, and civil 
rights in our country. Indeed, at the lunches I 
attended with John and other Members of 
Congress, Rev. Morris would remind us that 
his church had been founded shortly after 
emancipation by those who had endured slav-
ery. When a fire destroyed their original 
church building, the congregants banded to-
gether to build the current structure, donating 
bricks for its construction. For that reason, it is 
also known as the Brick-a-Day Church. 
Rev. Morris understood that his pastoral 
work reached far beyond the walls of First 
Baptist Church. He regularly volunteered his 
time as a mentor throughout the Montgomery 
community, and he served as Chaplain for the 
Montgomery Police Department for more than 
two decades. The Operation Good Shepherd 
program organized with other religious leaders 
from across the city endeavors to help law en-
forcement de-escalate encounters with resi-
dents and promote cooperation instead of con-
frontation. I know that his presence and con-
tributions will be greatly missed across Mont-
gomery and its region. 
I join in offering my condolences to Rev. 
Morris’ wife, Rebie, and their family as well as 
the entire First Baptist Church community. I 
will never forget the wisdom he shared with us 
or his warm and kind welcome and the won-
derful meals we had over the years fixed by 
the members of First Baptist. 
Now, he and John and Martin and Ralph 
and so many other great men and women of 
justice and courage march on together in eter-
nal peace.

REMEMBERING AND HONORING 
JIM WALTERS 
HON. EARL L. ‘‘BUDDY’’ CARTER 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 25, 2021 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to remember and honor Jim Wal-
ters who passed away on February 22nd at 
the age of 83. 
Throughout his life, Jim was no stranger to 
making an impact and improving the lives of 
others. Jim moved to Gainesville, Georgia in 
1971 where he raised his family and became 
a pillar of philanthropy and generosity in this 
community. 
He was a pioneer in the Georgia Industrial 
Loan Association, owning many loan offices 
and businesses throughout the state and 
country. 
Through his success, Jim gave back to his 
community in countless ways. 
He served on Georgia’s Board of Natural 
Resources, the Georgia Ports Authority, and 
40 different nonprofit organizations. 
He mentored, encouraged, supported and 
inspired all who met him, and Georgia will be 
forever touched by his legacy. 
My thoughts and prayers are with his family, 
friends, and all who knew him during this most 
difficult time.
