COMMEMORATING 
TOWN 
OF 
RAYVILLE 
AND 
EULA 
D. 
BRITTON ALUMNI ASSOCIATION 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Louisiana (Mr. ABRAHAM) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to commemorate the efforts of 
the town of Rayville, Louisiana, and 
the Eula D. Britton Alumni Associa-
tion to preserve their community’s 
heritage. 
The only part of Eula D. Britton 
school still standing is its gymnasium, 
but that didn’t stop the 1960 graduate 
class from doing something good. Quin-
cy Mason, who is in the audience 
today, and the rest of the alumni asso-
ciation purchased and turned it into a 
museum, showcasing the school’s his-
tory. 
First known as Rayville Colored 
School, its first class of 11 students 
graduated in 1939. It was renamed 
Rayville Rosenwald High School in 
1949, and eventually Eula D. Britton 
High School in 1956 after its long-serv-
ing principal, Eula D. Britton. 
In 2014, Quincy Mason, who is present 
here today in the House gallery, as I 
said, had the idea to petition for a his-
torical marker to commemorate the 
school’s history for generations to 
come. This year, on July 3, it will be-
come a reality when the marker is 
dedicated by its alumni association. 
The town of Rayville, Louisiana, is 
proud of Quincy Mason, who went on to 
play professional baseball for the Chi-
cago Cubs organization and was in-
ducted into the Southern University 
Sports Hall of Fame in 2015. 
Mr. Speaker, please join me in hon-
oring the town of Rayville and the 
Eula D. Britton Alumni Association for 
their efforts to preserve their commu-
nity’s rich history. 
THANKING RONNIE ANDERSON 
Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to thank Mr. Ronnie Anderson 
for his 51 years of service to Louisiana 
farmers and ranchers. 
After graduating from LSU in 1970 
with a degree in animal science, Ron-
nie returned home to work on his fam-
ily’s farm. He quickly became involved 
in the Louisiana Farm Bureau Federa-
tion and was elected president of his 
parish chapter shortly thereafter. 
In 1989, he was elected president of 
the statewide farm bureau, and he has 
been elected an additional 31 times 
since. 
I have known Ronnie personally for 
many, many years as a farmer myself, 
and it has always been clear to me that 
he loves Louisiana agriculture. When I 
was elected to Congress, I came to rely 
on his counsel to advocate for our 
farmers and ranchers. 
During his tenure, the Louisiana 
Farm Bureau has grown from 67,000 
members to more than 148,000, and 
Ronnie still raises several hundred 
head of cattle, as well as horses, hay, 
and timber, on his farm in East and 
West Feliciana Parishes in my congres-
sional district. 
In addition to his work at home and 
with the farm bureau, Ronnie has 
served for all but 2 years since 1997 on 
the Louisiana State University Board 
of Supervisors. 
Mr. Speaker, please join me in thank-
ing Ronnie Anderson for his many, 
many years of service to Louisiana and 
wish him well as he retires after 31 
years as president of the Louisiana 
Farm Bureau Federation.

HONORING ALVARO CIFUENTES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. SOTO) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise 
to honor the life of my longtime friend 
and mentor, Alvaro Cifuentes. 
On March 2, Puerto Rico suffered a 
tragic loss. 
Born in Mayaguez, Alvaro graduated 
magna cum laude from the University 
of Puerto Rico in 1972, earning a bach-
elor’s of business administration. 
He then went on to graduate from 
law school from the University of Puer-
to Rico School of Law, earning a J.D., 
again magna cum laude, in 1975. 
He came from a long line of wise po-
liticos from Puerto Rico who helped 
navigate the island over decades. 
Alvaro practiced law for 17 years and 
became a managing partner at the law 
firm of Goldman Antonetti in San 
Juan. 
In 1992, he managed Pedro Rosello’s 
successful race for Governor of Puerto

Rico, a man who would go on to win 
two terms, a hard task in the history of 
the island. 
After serving as Governor Rosello’s 
chief of staff for 3 years, he moved to 
Washington, D.C., where he focused on 
building the Democratic Party within 
the Hispanic community. From 2001 to 
2005, he served as the chair of the 
DNC’s Hispanic Caucus, where he in-
creased the party’s Hispanic member-
ship by over 30 percent. As chair, 
Alvaro rebuilt an unprecedented His-
panic campaign network and called for 
John Kerry to work toward winning 
Hispanic votes. 
In 2004, he earned the honor of being 
named one of the 100 most influential 
Hispanics in the United States by the 
Hispanic Business Magazine. 
Anyone 
who 
crossed 
paths 
with 
Alvaro knew he was a true man of the 
people and a fearless champion of Puer-
to Rico statehood. I remember the first 
time we talked about how important 
statehood would be for Puerto Rico. 
He recalled the story of the mighty 
pung, a story in Chinese folklore that 
talked about a huge bird that played 
with other smaller birds on a tiny is-
land and had a wingspan over 500 me-
ters. 
They would laugh at this giant bird, 
the mighty pung, with his awkward-
ness. He found out, through the hawk, 
that through thermal glides, he would 
be able to potentially fly like the other 
birds. 
He set off, needing a year to reach 
the height required. When asked about 
this difficult task and his inability to 
fly, he said: ‘‘It is okay. We have a long 
way to go.’’ 
That is where Alvaro talked about 
statehood, about how it has been over 
120 years, and about how we have an is-
land that is larger in population than 
26 States, yet it is taking over a cen-
tury for us to even get to this point, 
but it is okay. Alvaro passed before 
getting to see it happen. We have a 
long way to go. 
He is survived by three children, 
Alvaro, Carolina, and Natalia Isabel. 
Alvaro, you will be dearly missed by 
myself, by so many in Florida, and on 
the island of Puerto Rico, but the fight 
will continue to live on. 
f 
RECOGNIZING K–9 VETERANS DAY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
March 13 as K–9 Veterans Day, an op-
portunity to commemorate the work-
ing dogs that support our men and 
women in uniform. 
This year marks the 78th anniversary 
of the establishment of the K–9 Corps. 
After the attack on Pearl Harbor, the 
Army began training for the K–9 Corps 
in 1942, originally known as the War 
Dog Program. In the years that passed, 
the K–9 Corps has become a vital part 
of our Armed Forces operations. 
Though military working dogs ini-
tially served as morale boosters for our 
soldiers, they were eventually trained 
and incorporated into combat. A dog’s 
sense of smell is 5 to 10 times stronger 
than a human’s, which has made them 
expert counterparts in detecting explo-
sive devices. 
More than 1,500 dogs served in the 
Korean war, 4,000 in Vietnam, and 
many more in Afghanistan and Iraq. 
Like their human counterparts, our 
military K–9s eventually retire. Many 
dogs and their handlers develop a 
strong bond during their service to-
gether. 
Sadly, prior to the year 2000, military 
working dogs were considered ‘‘equip-
ment’’ and were either left behind or 
euthanized at the end of their service. 
Today, retired military working dogs 
are put up for adoption, and their per-
sonal handlers get first priority to give 
them a home. 
To further this effort, the American 
Humane Society works to unite our 
four-legged heroes with their handlers 
by raising funds to ensure their safe 
transport home. 
Oftentimes, these retired dogs will 
serve as support animals to service-
members who may be suffering from 
PTSD and other disabilities, both men-
tal and physical. Our veterans can 
greatly benefit from the assistance and 
the companionship that a dog provides, 
and our K–9 veterans benefit from their 
newfound forever homes. 
Our K–9 veterans have served our 
country, and they, too, deserve to be 
honored for their service. 
RECOGNIZING NATIONAL RED CROSS MONTH 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
March as National Red Cross Month. 
This tradition began in 1943 when 
President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued 
the proclamation to designate the 
month of March to celebrate Red Cross 
volunteers, donors, and instructors. 
The history of the Red Cross, how-
ever, goes back even further into 
American history. In 1881, Clara Barton 
established the organization right here 
in Washington, D.C., to better serve 
people in need. On June 5, 1889, Clara 
Barton and five volunteers came to 
Johnstown to respond to the Johns-
town Flood. 
For more than 100 years, the Amer-
ican Red Cross has worked to support 
those in need, whether they are men 
and women in uniform or victims of 
natural disaster. 
Perhaps 
the 
organization’s 
best- 
known program, the American Red 
Cross established the first nationwide 
civilian blood donation program in the 
1940s. 
According to the organization, some-
one in the United States needs blood 
every 2 seconds. There are regular 
blood donation drives right here on 
Capitol Hill, where we can all volun-
teer to donate blood that has the po-
tential to save a life. 
Less than 38 percent of the U.S. popu-
lation is eligible to give blood, and 
only 3 percent of those individuals do-
nate annually. 
The critical need for blood and the 
lifesaving potential that comes from a 
donation cannot be overstated. 
The American Red Cross has always 
been a leader in this effort, and today, 
they still provide more than 40 percent 
of the blood products in the United 
States. 
The success of the Red Cross relies on 
the generosity of the American spirit. 
This month and all year long, I am 
thankful for their service to our Na-
tion.

COMMENDING HEMET AND PALM 
SPRINGS FIREFIGHTERS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. RUIZ) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, this week, 
members of the Hemet and Palm 
Springs Fire Departments gathered in 
Washington, D.C., for the International 
Association of Firefighters’ annual leg-
islative conference. 
I met with several of them in my of-
fice and want to express my personal 
appreciation for their unrelenting serv-
ice that so often goes above and beyond 
their call of duty. 
Last December, tragedy struck in my 
district when three children and their 
father died in an apartment complex 
fire in Hemet, California. 
Despite the dangerous and grim cir-
cumstances, Hemet first responders 
worked heroically and helped save 
lives. 
Days later, the Hemet Fire Depart-
ment, in a demonstration of kindness, 
joined with community members to 
give financial support for the victims’ 
family and everyone affected by the 
fire. 
They simply said they were closing 
the loop. From fire to getting them 
back on their feet, they saw it as their 
responsibility to help those who were 
afflicted. 
This act of compassion shown by the 
first responders is just one example of 
the selflessness in which they live their 
lives every day. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the firefighters 
from Hemet and Palm Springs, and I 
thank 
first 
responders 
everywhere. 
Their heroism is as inspiring as it is 
impactful.

RECOGNIZING CATHERINE LANG 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Nebraska (Mr. BACON) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in honor of Women’s History 
Month to recognize a dedicated public 
servant from Nebraska’s Seventh Dis-
trict. Catherine Lang’s record of lead-
ership and advocacy for the State’s 
small business community has im-
proved the lives of many Nebraskans. 
Catherine earned both her bachelor 
of fine arts and juris doctor degrees

March 11, 2020 
from the University of Nebraska-Lin-
coln. As a leader with a passion for fos-
tering educational and economic op-
portunities for Nebraskans, she has 
worked hard to build a more robust en-
vironment for businesses and univer-
sities. She also plays an active role in 
several philanthropic and public orga-
nizations. 
b 1015 
Not only has she grown as a leader, 
the responsibilities entrusted to her 
have grown as well. Catherine has been 
crucial 
in 
guiding 
State 
agencies 
through periods of transition and ex-
pansion. Throughout her career, she 
has served Nebraska as the Department 
of Revenue’s deputy tax administrator, 
the Nebraska property tax adminis-
trator, the commissioner of labor, and 
as the director of the Department of 
Economic Development. 
Catherine inherited a legacy of serv-
ice from her parents, Hugh and Lillian 
Lang. Her father, Commander ‘‘Chic’’ 
Lang, served as a distinguished Navy 
pilot during World War II and later as 
an instructor at the U.S. Navy War 
College, and her mother enlisted in the 
U.S. Air Force. 
Catherine’s parents instilled in her a 
value she has instilled in her three 
sons: the importance of a college edu-
cation as a door to opportunity. Be-
cause of this, the Lang family estab-
lished a scholarship for students at the 
UNO College of Business for the pur-
pose of cultivating opportunity and 
character. 
Currently, Catherine holds the posi-
tion of State director of the Nebraska 
Business Development Center and as-
sistant dean at the UNO College of 
Business. She leads statewide outreach 
for NBDC and builds collaborative ef-
forts in the Nebraska University sys-
tem to support the institution’s mis-
sion of economic development. 
Thank you, Catherine, for dedicating 
your life to serving and inspiring oth-
ers, and we thank you for strength-
ening relationships within our commu-
nity. 
HONORING TIMOTHY KENNY ON HIS RETIREMENT 
Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Timothy Kenny and his 
exceptional service as the executive di-
rector of the Nebraska Investment Fi-
nance Authority, or NIFA. Timothy 
has been serving Nebraskans in this 
role since 1994. Before he joined NIFA, 
he served as director of programs for 
the Utah Housing Finance Agency and 
as executive director of the Texas 
Housing Finance Agency. 
NIFA administers programs to help 
Nebraskans finance affordable housing, 
medical facilities, community infra-
structure, and industrial development 
projects. They also serve first-time 
farmers and ranchers by providing af-
fordable financing strategies across the 
Great Plains. 
In the 36 years of its existence, NIFA 
has worked diligently to finance over 
91,000 mortgages for affordable single- 
family homes. Additionally, over 23,600 
affordable rental housing units for Ne-
braskans living on a budget have been 
created. Under Tim’s leadership, NIFA 
has taken care of our Armed Forces by 
providing over $96.1 million in home 
buyer’s assistance. 
Previously, Timothy served as a cer-
tified public accountant for a private 
tax and audit practice in Dallas, Texas, 
and then worked his way up to chief fi-
nancial officer for homebuilding and 
real estate firms in Texas and Colo-
rado. 
He now resides in Cass County, Ne-
braska, with his wife, Sara, three chil-
dren, and numerous grandchildren. On 
top of his commendable public service, 
Timothy has supported his children 
and country through more than 20 de-
ployments in the United States Armed 
Forces. 
Timothy continues to be active in 
Nebraska by serving on the National 
Council of State Housing Agencies, the 
National Association of Home Builders, 
the Nebraska Subprime Advisory Task 
Force, and the Governor’s Disaster Re-
covery Task Force. He exemplifies 
what it means to be a Nebraskan 
through his hard work, service to oth-
ers, and compassion for those in need. 
I congratulate Timothy on a notable 
career of public service and a retire-
ment that is well deserved.

SIMLEY WRESTLING TEAM STATE 
CHAMPIONS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Minnesota (Ms. CRAIG) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, today I rise 
to congratulate the Simley Spartans 
wrestling team on their AA State 
championship. 
Simley High School in Inver Grove 
Heights is surely proud of their accom-
plishments, as are we all in the Second 
Congressional District. In fact, their 
head coach, Will Short, called it a per-
fect season. 
Congratulations to the Spartan wres-
tlers. They have demonstrated excel-
lence in their sport and a strong com-
mitment to the success of their team. 
They have delivered outstanding re-
sults that they can be proud of in their 
school and their community. 
I thank especially the parents, the 
coaches, the teachers, and the mentors 
who have dedicated their time to mak-
ing their season successful. 
Congratulations, Simley. 
f 
SENATOR 
SCHUMER’S 
UNBECOM-
ING 
COMMENTS 
TO 
SUPREME 
COURT JUSTICES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Kansas (Mr. MARSHALL) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, last 
week in the Senate, a resolution was 
introduced to censure Senate Majority 
Leader CHUCK SCHUMER for his threat-
ening comments directed at Supreme 
Court Justices on the steps of the 
Court during an abortion-related case. 
These comments were not only unbe-
coming of a Senator, but they were 
simply egregious. They crossed the 
line. 
As representative leaders, we are 
held to a higher standard of conduct, 
and Senator SCHUMER failed to meet 
that standard. I call on my colleagues 
on the other side of the Capitol to sup-
port this censure for the preservation 
of this institution, for the preservation 
of 
the 
constitutionally 
separate 
branches of government, and for the 
health of our Republic. 
FEED YOUR MIND 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, this 
week the USDA, EPA, and FDA have 
partnered to announce a new public 
education campaign aimed at helping 
consumers better understand what is in 
their food. 
The Feed Your Mind initiative was 
developed to answer the most common 
questions that consumers have about 
genetically modified foods, commonly 
referred to as GMOs. This study will in-
clude what GMOs are, how and why 
they are made, how they are regulated, 
and it will address health and safety 
questions that consumers may have 
about these products. 
Biotechnology has allowed important 
advances in crop technologies and im-
proved our farmers’ ability to continue 
to provide safe, nutritious, and afford-
able food. Unfortunately, some con-
sumers have fallen victim to untrue or 
totally misleading rumors about what 
GMOs do for our food, creating confu-
sion and stifling innovation in the agri-
culture industry. 
I want to applaud the Trump admin-
istration for taking on the important 
task of providing factual information 
and important information about the 
food we grow right here in Kansas and 
across the United States. No consumer 
should have to fear their food or ques-
tion the technology that goes into 
making their meals possible. 
The United States has the single 
safest, most reliable, and most afford-
able food source in the entire world, 
and our farmers work daily to inform 
the public about what they do in the 
field. These resources will be an impor-
tant supplement to their outreach ef-
forts. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP’S CORONAVIRUS LEADERSHIP 
PLAN 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, the 
Wuhan coronavirus is certainly on the 
front of Americans’ minds these days, 
but before I speak about the virus, I 
would like to talk about leadership. 
I often tell the kids I work with that 
leadership is doing the right thing 
when it is not popular. Here in Wash-
ington, I have learned that doing the 
right thing is when you know over 90 
percent of the press and 90 percent of 
the media is going to disagree with 
you. 
Leadership is when President Trump 
banned travel from China on February 
2. While some people went so low as to 
call this xenophobic, as a physician, 
this early decision, I believe, has saved 
thousands of American lives.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1594 
March 11, 2020 
By now, we have millions of test kits 
distributed out across the country. I 
want to just reassure Americans that 
this testing is covered by Medicare, by 
Medicaid, and by most every one of 
their insurance companies. 
I also want to reassure Americans 
that antivirals and vaccines are in 
early phases of trials, way ahead of de-
velopment. We are very optimistic that 
these antivirals may soon be available 
for those who are impacted the most by 
this Wuhan virus. We are also opti-
mistic that these vaccines will be 
available by this next winter. 
We have a plan. The President has 
given us a plan. Let’s stick to this 
plan. We are implementing this plan, 
and it is working. 
Again, 
as 
a 
physician 
who 
has 
worked with health departments, I am 
truly impressed by how we have con-
tained this virus and how our local 
health departments are working so 
hard to minimize the spread of this 
virus. I am absolutely amazed that we 
only have approximately 1,000 Ameri-
cans impacted by the Wuhan viruses at 
this time. 
In the meantime, again, let’s go back 
to our plan. It is not a time to panic. 
This is a time to wash your hands, 
limit your travel, and, by the way, 
open your windows and doors when you 
are at home and let some of this fresh 
air come in which this virus does not 
like a bit. 
So, thanks, Mr. President, for deliv-
ering on your plan. We are truly im-
pressed as physicians in Congress by 
the great job that you are doing and 
the leadership you are showing. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair.

WOMEN’S HISTORY MONTH: 
MARGARET HUDSON 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. COSTA) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. 
COSTA. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
every 
March, we honor the extraordinary 
contributions of women who have 
shaped our Nation’s history and those 
who continue to pave the way for the 
next generation. This year also marks 
the 100th year since the 19th Amend-
ment granted women the right to vote. 
Think about it, just in the last 100 
years. Our Nation is now going on 245 
years old. A century later, the women 
who have done so much for our country 
throughout our Nation’s entire history 
continue to make a difference. 
I am proud, today, to say that I serve 
with a record number of women in Con-
gress as we continue to fight for issues 
that are so important: equal pay, re-
productive freedom, and so much more. 
Mr. Speaker, as we use this oppor-
tunity 
to 
celebrate 
the 
incredible 
women who have changed the world in 
your life and in my life, I would like to 
pay tribute to an iconic woman, an art-
ist in my home of Fresno, California, 
Margaret Hudson. 
Ms. Hudson passed away last month, 
but her legacy lives on in her clay 
sculptures of California wildlife that 
can be seen on display throughout the 
valley. It is incredible work. 
From a young age, Margaret loved to 
spend time outdoors hiking in such 
places as Sequoia National Park. Her 
appreciation for the beautiful land-
scape of the Central Valley would later 
influence so much of her artwork that 
we enjoy today. 
She attended college in New England 
and served as a missionary in Japan 
and South Korea for several years. Her 
love for art blossomed years later, 
when she began sculpting from memo-
ries of her time in South Korea. She 
became one of the first female art en-
trepreneurs in Fresno when she opened 
up her own studio in 1972. 
Through the years, Margaret ex-
panded her interest in the arts to 
painting and held many of her own art 
shows to display her work and to en-
courage young artists such as herself, 
especially women. Margaret’s artwork 
is a fixture throughout the Central 
Valley, with permanent works on dis-
play at our Valley Children’s Hospital 
and Fresno Chaffee Zoo. 
Her work continues to inspire us, and 
I think it is a reflection of her appre-
ciation and respect for the natural 
beauty and landscapes that we have in 
California and throughout our country. 
Certainly, the Sierra Nevada and the 
San Joaquin Valley were among many 
of the reflections and renderings of the 
creation of the art that she was so 
proud of and that we so much enjoy 
today. 
So I ask my colleagues to join me in 
recognizing the life and the contribu-
tions of Margaret Hudson. Her artwork 
continues to inspire and is cherished as 
a part of all of those who know it and 
who enjoy it. 
God bless you, Margaret. You made a 
difference.

RECOGNIZING JOSH SPEIDEL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Indiana (Mr. PENCE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Josh Speidel, an extraor-
dinary young man from my hometown 
of Columbus, Indiana. 
Josh was an Indiana All-Star high 
school basketball player when he was 
in a tragic car accident. Josh spent 
many months in hospitals and rehab 
learning how to walk and talk again. It 
was a difficult journey, but Josh’s fam-
ily never lost hope. 
The University of Vermont honored 
Josh’s 
basketball 
scholarship 
he 
achieved before the accident and wel-
comed him back with open arms. I am 
proud to say that Josh recently scored 
his first point in his college basketball 
career and will soon be graduating 
from the university. 
I wish Josh the best of luck in his fu-
ture. He is an inspiration to all of us.

IVY TECH CC FLIGHT PROGRAM 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the Hoosier State’s first 
community college flight program and 
to commend the partnership between 
Ivy Tech Community College and the 
Columbus Municipal Airport. 
Since 2017, Ivy Tech Columbus has 
been offering Ivy Tech’s first aviation 
associate’s degree and an aviation 
management program. 
This program is designed to give stu-
dents hands-on pilot training. In addi-
tion to flight time, students also train 
on a flight simulator at the Columbus 
Municipal Airport. 
I look forward to seeing more skill- 
based programs like this to help our 
youth in their careers. 
WOMEN’S HISTORY MONTH 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
as we celebrate the importance of 
Women’s History Month. I would like 
to take this opportunity to celebrate 
women throughout the Sixth District 
who make a difference in our everyday 
lives. 
I think of women business leaders, 
humanitarians, and activists in our 
communities, like Jeanie Hahn, Jean 
Ann Harcourt, Sue Saunders, Lisa 
Fisher and Celeste Calvitto. 
We recognize Linda Ostewig, who 
leads a faith-based nonprofit for strug-
gling teens to learn healthy lifestyle 
patterns in our own Hancock County. 
I am reminded of the example set by 
Susan Stahl, who has led Girls Inc. in 
Madison for over three decades. 
We recognize leaders like Wendy 
Elwood in my hometown of Columbus, 
who last year was named ‘‘Woman of 
the Year’’ by The Republic newspaper. 
Indiana’s First Lady, Janet Holcomb, 
is also from our district in Muncie. 
The people of Indiana’s Sixth District 
are blessed to have so many women 
helping lead and inspire our commu-
nities. 
We celebrate and honor them as part 
of Women’s History Month. 
INCLUSION OF POULTRY IN U.S.-U.K. TRADE 
NEGOTIATIONS 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to voice my support for one of the big-
gest industries in my district—the 
poultry industry. 
I urge the administration and Am-
bassador Lighthizer to include poultry 
in any U.S.-U.K. trade deal. 
As the second largest exporter of 
chicken and the largest exporter of tur-
key, the U.S. will continue to gain mo-
mentum in this industry if the U.K. is 
added as a new market. 
Indiana is the fifth largest turkey 
producer and second largest egg pro-
ducer in the United States. A U.K. 
trade agreement will boost our Hoosier 
poultry farmers, who are an essential 
part of our Indiana economy. 
As Indiana’s Sixth District Rep-
resentative, I will continue to support 
our Hoosier farmers and fight for their 
access to free markets. 
FARMING AND CARBON SEQUESTRATION

farming and the agriculture commu-
nity has on carbon sequestration. 
The use of cover crops increased by 15 
percent per year since 2012. This means 
that 20 million acres across the U.S. 
are likely to be planted in cover crops 
this year with the potential to seques-
ter about 60 million metric tons of CO2, 
equal to the emissions of over 12 mil-
lion cars. 
The use of ethanol and biodiesel is 
notably reducing greenhouse gas emis-
sions, the same amount as if 17 million 
cars were taken off the road in 2018. 
Mr. Speaker, I will continue to sup-
port the agriculture community and its 
leadership in being stewards of our en-
vironment. 
f 
BLACK MATERNAL HEALTH 
MOMNIBUS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. ADAMS) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, today I 
rise to speak about the Black Maternal 
Health Momnibus, an historic and com-
prehensive package that tackles one of 
the greatest public health crises of our 
time. 
My work on Black Maternal Health 
began when my daughter, a Black mom 
herself, survived a complicated preg-
nancy that almost claimed her life. 
How many people my age aren’t as 
lucky, and now have grandkids who 
grew up without a mommy? 
I knew when I got to Congress, I had 
to make this a priority. 
In 2018, Senator KAMALA HARRIS and 
I worked with the Black Mamas Matter 
Alliance to introduce resolutions hon-
oring the first Black Maternal Health 
Week, as well as the Maternal CARE 
Act. That effort led to last April, when 
Congresswoman 
LAUREN
UNDERWOOD 
and I launched the Black Maternal 
Health Caucus. 
This issue was deeply personal for 
both of us. We wanted to raise aware-
ness, educate our colleagues, and shine 
a bright spotlight on the maternal 
health crisis—of mothers needlessly 
dying during what should be one of the 
most joyous times of their lives. 
Our caucus has grown to more than 
100 members in less than a year, which 
I imagine might be a record feat, but it 
speaks to the importance of this issue 
and how it resonates so deeply within 
Congress and across party lines. 
Black maternal health is not a par-
tisan issue. It is a life-and-death issue. 
The main goal of the caucus is to de-
velop and advance evidence-based pol-
icy solutions. 
The 
Black 
Maternal 
Health 
Momnibus Act of 2020 builds upon ex-
isting maternal health legislation by 
filling gaps through nine new bills to 
comprehensively address every aspect 
of the Black maternal health crisis. 
Throughout the process, we were very 
intentional about centering the voices 
of Black women and ensuring that 
Black women-led organizations were 
consulted early and often. 
The Momnibus makes investments in 
social determinants of health, commu-
nity-based organizations, the growth 
and diversification of the perinatal 
workforce, improvements in data col-
lection and quality measures, digital 
tools like telehealth and innovative 
payment models. 
In addition to direct efforts to im-
prove Black maternal health outcomes, 
the Momnibus focuses on high-risk 
populations, 
including 
women 
vet-
erans, incarcerated women, and Native 
Americans. 
Mr. Speaker, I also want to take a 
moment to speak about the bill that I 
am leading within the package: The 
Kira Johnson Act. 
Kira was an entrepreneur, she trav-
eled the world, and she was a mother to 
a healthy, little boy. 
On April 12, 2016, she checked into a 
hospital with her husband, Charles, to 
give 
birth 
to 
their 
second 
child, 
Langston. 
Despite being in excellent health, de-
spite 
being 
a 
successful 
business-
woman, despite having health insur-
ance, and doing everything right, Kira 
did not make it out alive. She died 
from hours of neglect and severe hem-
orrhaging, nearly 12 hours after safely 
delivering her second son. 
Kira Johnson mattered. 
Kira deserved better. 
And this legislation says, unequivo-
cally, that Black Mamas matter. It 
makes 
investments 
in 
community- 
based organizations that are leading 
the charge to protect moms: By sup-
porting maternal mental health condi-
tions and substance use disorders; by 
supporting doulas and perinatal health 
workers; and addressing social deter-
minants of health, like housing, trans-
portation, and nutrition. 
It also supports research, bias and 
racism training programs, and the es-
tablishment of Respectful Maternity 
Care Compliance offices to address bias 
and racism. 
At its core, this bill is about account-
ability and empowering our commu-
nity health partners who have been 
providing safe and culturally-sensitive 
care to Black moms for years. 
Again, I am thrilled for the accumu-
lation of nearly a year of research, in-
formation-gathering, and collaboration 
with key stakeholders. 
For decades, the U.S. maternal mor-
tality and morbidity rates have gotten 
worse for all mothers, but especially 
for Black women whose health out-
comes are further compounded by sys-
temic and structural racism. 
The 
Black 
Maternal 
Health 
Momnibus is an historic piece of legis-
lation that not only targets failures in 
maternal healthcare, but also address-
es pervasive maternal health dispari-
ties through solutions that are cul-
turally competent and proven effec-
tive. 
It provides a roadmap so that our 
healthcare systems, our providers, and 
society will finally make Black mater-
nal and infant health a priority. No one 
should have to lose another friend, 
auntie, sister, daughter, or mommy to 
this crisis. 
Mr. Speaker, let’s get it done for all 
of the moms out there. 
f 
CELEBRATING BRIGADIER 
GENERAL SHAWN MANKE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Minnesota (Mr. STAUBER) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Shawn Manke from 
Cambridge, Minnesota, for his recent 
promotion to the rank of brigadier gen-
eral in the Minnesota National Guard. 
Shawn grew up on the shores of Spec-
tacle Lake in southwestern Isanti 
County, and spent his summers work-
ing at his family’s resort. He is a proud 
graduate 
of 
Cambridge-Isanti 
High 
School. 
Upon graduation from the ROTC pro-
gram at the University of North Da-
kota, Shawn was commissioned as an 
Army aviator in 1991. After being re-
leased from Active Duty, Shawn knew 
he was not ready to give up his life of 
service and enlisted as an officer in the 
Minnesota National Guard. 
During his time with the Minnesota 
National Guard, Shawn has held many 
leadership positions, including director 
of Army aviation, commander of the 
34th Combat Aviation Brigade, and 
commander of the 2nd Battalion 147th 
Assault Helicopter. 
Shawn’s exemplary leadership has 
earned him numerous military awards, 
such as the Legion of Merit, Bronze 
Star Medal, and the Meritorious Serv-
ice Medal with four bronze oakleaf 
clusters. 
Brigadier General Shawn Manke is 
an 
accomplished 
officer 
with 
the 
knowledge and experience necessary 
for his new role. 
Mr. Speaker, on behalf of Min-
nesota’s Eighth Congressional District, 
I thank him for his years of dedicated 
service, and congratulate him on his 
well-deserved promotion. 
STANDING WITH THE GRAND RAPIDS COMMUNITY 
Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today on the House floor to offer words 
of consolation and support to the 
Grand 
Rapids 
community 
in 
Min-
nesota’s Eighth Congressional District 
as they mourn the loss of two local 
businesses from a tragic fire. 
Last Saturday, a fire broke out in 
the basement at Lakeview Behavioral 
Health, and quickly spread to the VFW 
Post 1720 building next door. 
While we are fortunate that no one 
was harmed in the fire, both businesses 
are a total loss. 
I was deeply saddened by this news, 
as the VFW Post in Grand Rapids 
served as a place where combat vet-
erans could gather for support and ca-
maraderie since 1929. It also housed 
valuable historic memorabilia, much of 
which is now gone. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the brave fire-
fighters 
and 
first 
responders

quickly responded to this emergency 
and prevented this fire from spreading 
further. Your dedication to this com-
munity is greatly appreciated. 
Mr. Speaker, my heart goes out to 
the veterans who frequented this VFW 
post, 
the 
patients 
who 
attended 
Lakeview Behavioral Health, and the 
entire Grand Rapids community as 
they recover from this loss. 
Please know that I stand by ready to 
help in whatever way I can during this 
rebuilding process. 
HONORING THE LIFE’S WORK OF HOWARD 
HEDSTROM 
Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the contributions of 
Howard Hedstrom of Grand Marais, 
Minnesota, and the entire Hedstrom 
family. 
Last month, at the age of 71, Howard 
retired as president of Hedstrom Lum-
ber Company, a business that his fam-
ily built from the ground up and ran 
for over 100 years. 
Howard’s 
grandfather, 
Andrew 
Hedstrom, was a Swedish immigrant 
who pieced together a used sawmill to 
build a company that would employ 
three generations of Hedstroms. 
While Hedstrom Lumber Company 
had humble origins, thanks to deter-
mination, leadership, and the foresight 
of company employees, like Howard, it 
evolved into one of the largest employ-
ers in Cook County, Minnesota. 
Mr. Speaker, for generations, Min-
nesotans have worked in our forests, 
helping to support their families and 
boost rural economies. The Hedstrom 
family is a fine example of this great 
tradition. 
I am incredibly grateful to Howard 
and his entire family for their dedica-
tion to the Grand Marais community 
and Minnesota as a whole. 
Mr. Speaker, I wish Howard a relax-
ing retirement spent with his wife, 
Bonnie, and the rest of his loved ones. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE AND 
MEMORY OF SUSIE SCHLOMANN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. SMUCKER) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and memory of 
Mrs. Susie Schlomann of Shrewsbury, 
Pennsylvania, who suddenly passed 
away unexpectedly last week. 
Mr. Speaker, after Pennsylvania’s 
Congressional 
District 
boundaries 
changed, I had the privilege to rep-
resent southern York County. I quickly 
came to know Susie. Susie was pas-
sionate and proud of her conservative, 
political beliefs, volunteering much of 
her time furthering the causes which 
she supported, and she was never shy to 
share her thoughts about what was 
happening here in Washington. 
Susie came to Shrewsbury from Long 
Island, where she raised her family, in-
cluding her three children, Tristan, 
Ted, and Rebecca, and where, in 1978, 
she married the love of her life, her 
late husband, Rick. In addition to her 
three children, Susie is survived by five 
grandchildren, her brother Andrew, and 
her sister, Amanda. 
Mr. Speaker, we wish all those who 
are grieving, comfort. And we give 
thanks for having had the opportunity 
to know Susie, who filled so many peo-
ple’s lives with happiness. 
f 
COMBATING THE INHUMANE 
PRACTICES AT PUPPY MILLS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to bring attention to the 
concerning 
issue 
of 
puppy 
mills 
throughout the State of Pennsylvania 
and across America. If we all care for 
our canine companions, we cannot con-
tinue to support the horrifying prac-
tices at puppy mills. 
Mr. Speaker, it is well-documented 
that puppy mills supply pet stores with 
puppies. My home State of Pennsyl-
vania is no exception. 
Cutting off the puppy mill to pet 
store supply chain will decrease the de-
mand for puppies raised in puppy mills. 
The inhumane practices at most puppy 
mills are shocking, appalling, and un-
acceptable. We have all seen the im-
ages on television. 
Stores that sell commercially-raised 
puppies operate based on an outdated 
and 
socially 
unacceptable 
business 
model. We need to work to shift the pet 
markets towards humane sources, in-
cluding shelters and rescues that are 
burdened with finding families for 
homeless pets, thousands of which have 
to be euthanized in Pennsylvania each 
year. 
President Truman once said: If you 
want a friend in Washington, get a dog. 
Mr. Speaker, let’s show our best 
friends the love they deserve by com-
bating the inhumane practice of puppy 
mills. 
b 1045 
CELEBRATING HOUR OF CODE 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to bring attention to the 
school-based initiative designed to in-
crease student interest in the world of 
coding. The Hour of Code, which occurs 
every year during Computer Science 
Education Week, has the goal to teach 
students coding basics. 
The Bristol Township School District 
is one of several around the world tak-
ing advantage of this program, and 
they are leading the way in our com-
munity. Bristol Township schools are 
known for their science, technology, 
engineering, art, and math initiatives, 
and they held multiple events to allow 
students to participate in the Hour of 
Code. 
The 
introductory 
program 
uses 
games to teach younger children. By 
showing kids the basics of coding, it 
can spark an interest in computer 
science and engineering, which, as our 
society 
becomes 
more 
technology 
based, can be incredibly valuable skills 
to have. 
I 
applaud 
the 
Bristol 
Township 
schools for participating in this pro-
gram, and I hope that other school dis-
tricts across our community and across 
our Nation will follow the lead of Bris-
tol Township schools. 
CONGRATULATING ROOSEVELT ELEMENTARY’S 
MILLER MEAN MACHINES 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize the champions 
of the Eleanor Roosevelt Elementary 
School’s 
10th 
annual 
Super 
Duper 
Bowl, the Miller Mean Machines. 
Since 2010, Roosevelt Elementary, in 
Falls Township, has come together for 
a flag football tournament. The tour-
nament consists of fifth-grade students 
and their teachers coming together for 
a fun day outside. The event also acts 
as a fundraiser, taking donations of 
both food and money for the Bucks 
County Emergency Homeless Shelter 
and the Children’s Hospital of Philadel-
phia. 
Mr. Speaker, any event that brings 
our community together for a day of 
fun, teamwork, and sportsmanship, 
while also helping those in need, should 
be celebrated by this House. 
Congratulations again to the Mean 
Machines, and I thank Eleanor Roo-
sevelt Elementary for being an edu-
cational leader in our community. 
f 
HONORING HEROES OF ROCK HILL 
POLICE DEPARTMENT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
South Carolina (Mr. NORMAN) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor two heroes of my local 
police department in Rock Hill, South 
Carolina. 
In May of last year, Sergeants Cedric 
Stokes and Bruce Haire demonstrated 
the meaning of compassion when they 
used unconventional means to save the 
life of another man. 
That day, the police department 
heard reports of a man seeking to com-
mit suicide while streaming it live on 
social media. Without a moment’s hesi-
tation, these officers used social media 
to identify the man online and, upon 
identification, 
coordinated 
rapidly, 
with the help of Facebook employees, 
to ensure that the man was found and 
promptly cared for in a medical facil-
ity. 
Ours is a brave new world, and the 
implications of new technology cut 
both ways. On this day, it was at once 
a morbid display of pain, but also a 
beacon signaling for help. 
A quote came to mind when I read of 
these officers’ heroic responses. In the 
words of Theodore Roosevelt: 
Do what you can with all you have, wher-
ever you are. 
On behalf of the Fifth District, I 
commend the officers of the Rock Hill 
Police Department for their unwaver-
ing and adaptive dedication to protect 
and serve.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1597 
March 11, 2020 
Without officers like Sergeant Cedric 
Stokes and Sergeant Bruce Haire, we 
would be one beautiful life shorter and 
our community all the lesser for it. 
I think of the words of Winston 
Churchill, who said, when Great Brit-
ain was under siege by Germany: 
There will be a time when doing your best 
isn’t good enough. We must do what is re-
quired. 
These officers did what was required. 
God bless. 
f 
REAUTHORIZING PATRIOT ACT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Kentucky (Mr. MASSIE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. MASSIE. Mr. Speaker, some of 
my colleagues today will offer a bill to 
reauthorize the PATRIOT Act. 
It will have the thin varnish of re-
form on it, designed to whitewash the 
egregious 
constitutional 
violations 
that have been going on, but it is the 
Americans who are going to be shel-
lacked by this legislation and the proc-
ess used to pass it. 
I want to read the Fourth Amend-
ment and part of the Fifth Amendment 
to the Constitution here today on the 
floor. 
‘‘The right of the people to be secure 
in their persons, houses, papers, and ef-
fects, against unreasonable searches 
and seizures, shall not be violated, and 
no warrants shall issue, but upon prob-
able cause, supported by oath or affir-
mation, and particularly describing the 
place to be searched, and the persons or 
things to be seized.’’ 
The Fifth Amendment says: Nor shall 
any person be ‘‘deprived of life, liberty, 
or property, without due process of 
law.’’ 
So, let’s think about some of these 
words because they are being treated 
as if they are curse words or dirty 
words today. Warrant, due process, 
probable cause, these are all things 
that are guaranteed as rights for all 
Americans in the Constitution, and 
none of those can be guaranteed with-
out transparency. 
We can’t have star chambers and 
kangaroo courts. This has to happen in 
daylight, and it has to be reviewable by 
the people in order to know that these 
things are true. 
These things, they are inconvenient, 
a warrant, due process, probable cause. 
They are inconvenient for investiga-
tors. They are inconvenient for pros-
ecutors. They sometimes get in the 
way. They make the job of finding the 
criminals, of finding the terrorists, a 
little bit harder. But they are guaran-
teed rights of all Americans, so we 
have to keep them in the process. 
But let me talk about the legislative 
process here today, and I want to chal-
lenge the authors of this bill to come 
down here and defend what they have 
done. 
This bill started out in a committee. 
This is how it is supposed to happen, as 
a base bill. Then, as the debate started 
getting underway, oh, it got inconven-
ient. Things were said that people 
didn’t want to be said. Amendments 
were offered to make it more constitu-
tional. They didn’t like that. 
What did they do? The chairman of 
the committee pulled the bill, canceled 
the hearing, and canceled the markup 
of this bill, and they took it behind 
closed doors. They took it into the 
back room to write it. They took it 
into the back room to draft it. 
Why did they go into the back room? 
Because the lobbyists aren’t in the 
committee, and the deep state doesn’t 
get a vote on the committee, so they 
got them in the back room with them. 
The lobbyists and the deep state helped 
draft this bill that we are going to vote 
on today. 
How much time do we have to review 
it? Less than 24 hours. Last night is 
when they made the text available. 
There is a rule in this House that 
guarantees 72 hours to review a bill. 
They are going to suspend that rule 
here in a few minutes, and people will 
willingly vote to suspend that rule so 
they can ram this bill through, so that 
they can reauthorize the unconstitu-
tional provisions of the PATRIOT Act. 
Now, I understand terrorists, foreign 
terrorists, don’t have constitutional 
rights, so that is why the PATRIOT 
Act and the Foreign Intelligence Sur-
veillance Act were passed, so that 
those impediments wouldn’t be in the 
way when you are going after terror-
ists, foreign terrorists. But everybody 
is presumed innocent until proven 
guilty, so we need to maintain that. 
One of the worst things that has hap-
pened as a result of the FISA and the 
PATRIOT Act is that a Presidential 
candidate was spied on. He is now the 
President. He overcame that. But this 
bill should fix that. 
A candidate, Presidential, congres-
sional, city councilman, never again 
should they be spied on using these 
tools that are supposed to go after ter-
rorists, after foreigners. 
I urge my colleagues in the House— 
well, the ones who have offered this 
bill, I urge them to get down here and 
defend what they have done. I urge 
them to come down here and explain 
why they don’t want us to have—they 
don’t want you to have 72 hours to look 
at this bill. Come down and defend 
that. 
Then, for all of my other colleagues 
here in the House, I urge you to vote 
‘‘no.’’ And for my friends in the Senate, 
vote ‘‘no’’ as well. 
If this should make it to the Presi-
dent’s desk, which I fear it is going 
to—I fear it is going to be on his desk, 
and he has some unwise or insincere 
counselors right now. I urge the Presi-
dent, if this should make it to his desk, 
to remember what they did to him with 
this legislation. Remember. And I urge

PRAYER 
Reverend Jonathan Slavinskas, St. 
Bernard’s Church of Our Lady of Provi-
dence Parish, Worcester, Massachu-
setts, offered the following prayer: 
Eternal Word, we come to You with 
praise and thanksgiving for the many 
blessings that You bestow upon us. We 
thank You for the blessings of our 
faith, freedom, and Nation. 
As we gather, we do so rejoicing, giv-
ing thanks for being able to live in a 
nation that provides us with the oppor-
tunity to freely elect the women and 
men within this assembly who have 
been called to assist in guiding our Na-
tion. 
Our prayer is that, through the Mem-
bers of this assembly’s diverse and 
unique gifts and talents that You have 
bestowed upon them, they might be 
woven together as one, continually 
championing the common good for all 
within our Nation. 
We pray that, in moments of dis-
agreements and debate, an authentic 
understanding 
and 
mutual 
respect 
might prevail, bearing witness to the 
gift of collaboration for the promotion 
of the common good. 
We pray for Your continual blessings 
to flow upon this assembly and the 
works that come forth, and we pray for 
all of those who have been affected by 
illness and disease that they may find 
healing and comfort in this time of un-
certainty. 
We pray for all of this in Your name. 
Amen.

Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina led

United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

WELCOMING REVEREND 
JONATHAN SLAVINSKAS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without 
objection, the gentleman from Massa-
chusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN) is recognized 
for 1 minute. 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to welcome to the House 
floor my dear friend, Father Jonathan 
Slavinskas, who offered today’s open-
ing prayer. 
Father Jonathan, as most of his pa-
rishioners call him, is the pastor of St. 
Bernard’s Church of Our Lady of Provi-
dence Parish on Lincoln Street in 
Worcester, Massachusetts. A lifelong 
resident of Worcester, he is also the po-
lice chaplain for Worcester, Auburn, 
and Southbridge. 
What makes Father Jon so extraor-
dinary is his complete devotion to 
bettering the lives of his parish com-
munity, especially the young people. 
He hosts an annual Halloween party for 
hundreds of neighborhood kids so they 
have a safe place to go trick-or-treat-
ing. 
Stories abound of his little acts of 
kindness, like buying pizza for kids 
hanging out on the church steps or 
opening up the church gym for youth 
basketball games or making it a point 
to walk around the neighborhood and 
simply say ‘‘hi.’’ 
Madam Speaker, Father Jon’s com-
passion and commitment to making 
everyone feel welcome at St. Ber-
nard’s—no matter who they are—is 
truly remarkable. He is an inspiration 
to us all.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The

HONORING THE LIFE OF RON 
PETTENGILL 
(Mr. MORELLE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. MORELLE. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the life of my dear 
friend, Ron Pettengill, a pillar of the 
Rochester 
community, 
who 
passed 
away on February 28. 
As head of the local carpenters union 
in Rochester and Monroe County build-
ing trades, Ron defined the Rochester 
labor movement, dedicating himself 
and his life’s work to improving the 
lives of working people everywhere. 
Our community is a better and more 
equitable place because of his tireless 
commitment to advocating for social 
change. Ron’s work will continue to 
open doors for people in our commu-
nity for generations to come. I am so 
proud to have been able to call him my 
friend. 
I join all of Rochester in mourning 
his loss and extend my prayers and 
deepest sympathies to the Pettengill 
family. 
f 
TRUMP KEEPING AMERICANS 
SAFE 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I am grateful to 
President Donald Trump for focusing 
on the safety and health of American 
families since the beginning of his ad-
ministration. Not only did President 
Trump immediately take action to ad-
dress the coronavirus with a travel 
ban, he has increased funding for im-
portant disease research and prepared-
ness efforts since he first took office. 
President Trump has focused on a 
whole-of-government approach in com-
bating the coronavirus by ensuring 
State, local, public, and private offi-
cials are prepared to keep families safe. 
He has made the swift decision to ap-
point Vice President MIKE PENCE head 
of the Coronavirus Task Force, who is 
skilled as a voice for this important 
service. 
Since President Trump was elected, 
his administration has increased fund-
ing to the National Institutes of Health 
by 39 percent, the Centers for Disease 
Control by 24 percent, balanced bio-
medical research by 35 percent, Stra-
tegic National Stockpile by 32 percent, 
and infectious disease response by 70 
percent. This administration is com-
mitted to keeping families safe while 
preparing our country for disease out-
breaks. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops, 
and we will never forget September the 
11th in the global war on terrorism.

STAND UP AND BE COUNTED IN 
2020 CENSUS 
(Ms. PLASKETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. PLASKETT. Madam Speaker, as 
we approach April, you will begin to 
hear more and more about the Census. 
The Census is the most important 
count of people in our country, respon-
sible for allocating nearly $800 billion 
in Federal funding, and it takes place 
only once every decade. 
By standing up and being counted in 
the 2020 Census, Madam Speaker, you 
are ensuring that your State or terri-
tory has access to the funding it needs 
for 
police 
and 
fire 
departments, 
healthcare, roads, and many other 
vital programs. 
Madam Speaker, you don’t need to be 
an inventor, a doctor, or even a Mem-
ber of Congress to shape the future of 
your community. By being in the 2020 
Census, you will help inform funding 
for local school programs and roads in 
our community. 
We all count and we all get to shape 
our future by participating in the 2020 
Census. You can make a difference in 
our community this year and respond 
to the 2020 Census, whether online, by 
mail, or by phone. 
Be counted this April.

CHINESE ENTITIES RECEIVING 
AMERICAN INVESTMENTS 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. 
LAMALFA. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
China considers the United States their 
biggest threat in their search for global 
dominance. However, the truth is that 
China’s recent rise is being enabled by 
institutional and individual investors 
in the United States, including Fed-
eral, State, and public pension funds 
like the TSP and CalPERS in Cali-
fornia. 
A number of Chinese entities, which 
are receiving American investments, 
are engaged in activities that violate 
U.S. law and hurt our national security 
interests, especially our military, like 
China Telecom’s social credit score 
system and their repression of the 
Uighurs, which the House voted to con-
demn earlier this year. 
Our public pensions should not be al-
lowed to become a new funding vehicle 
for Communist China, which serves as 
a threat to current and retired Federal 
and State employees who are unknow-
ingly enabling their aggression against 
U.S. interests.

Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, last Sunday, March 8, 
Gunnery Sergeant Diego Pongo and 
Captain Moises Navas made the ulti-
mate sacrifice while serving their

Camp Lejeune in eastern North Caro-
lina in my district. They were both 
killed in action while supporting Iraqi 
forces in clearing out a tunnel of ISIS 
fighters. 
Given the current coronavirus situa-
tion, it is easy to lose sight of the sac-
rifices of our servicemembers and their 
families, but we absolutely cannot 
allow this condition to make us forget 
about our men and women in uniform 
here and abroad. 
The deaths of these two brave ma-
rines are a somber reminder that our 
servicemembers and their families sac-
rifice so much for us each and every 
day, no matter the circumstances, so 
that we can live in peace and freedom. 
My thoughts and prayers are with 
MARSOC, Navas’ and Pongo’s brothers 
in arms, and especially their families

RECOGNIZING CROSSROADS 
QUARTET’S 60-YEAR ANNIVERSARY 
(Mr. COMER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Crossroads Quartet 
for their 60th anniversary of vocalizing 
Southern 
Gospel 
music 
throughout 
Kentucky and other States. 
Founded in 1960 in Russell Springs, 
Kentucky, this fine group of constitu-
ents has now been active within the 
music world for 60 consecutive years. 
They have traveled thousands of miles, 
worn out four Dodge vans, and touched 
numerous lives. 
While some of the names and faces 
have changed, the inspiring mission of 
Crossroads Quartet has remained a 
constant. 
Today 
founding 
member 
Vernie 
McGaha, 
alongside 
Brian 
McGaha, Dave Powell, and Randy Hart, 
continues to fulfill the original calling 
of Crossroads Quartet. 
I am proud to be their voice in Wash-
ington and am confident that their mu-
sical ministry will be active for many 
years to come. Their decades of con-
tributions are certainly deserving of 
recognition by this entire body.

BROOKWOOD COMMUNITY 
(Mr. OLSON asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. OLSON. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to invite the entire Congress and all 
my fellow Texans, especially my neigh-
bors in Texas 22, to the biggest Texas- 
size birthday party of 2020. 
This picture to my left is pure 
Brookwood. They are turning 35 years 
old this year. Since 1985, citizens at 
Brookwood with mental and physical 
challenges are taught real job skills. 
They are infused with pride, self-worth, 
and Christian love. 
Brookwood was started by Yvonne 
Streit. Her 1-year-old daughter, Vicki, 
had severe brain damage. Yvonne had a 
mission. From her backyard to church-
es to the current two campuses with 
230 or more citizens, Brookwood is 
making their citizens in Texas better 
every single day. 
Their official birthday party is April 
3 at 11 a.m. The catering is done by the 
Brookwood Cafe. If you want a belly 
full of food and a heart full of Christian 
love, come see us in Brookwood.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF 
BONNIE DUVALL 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor 
the life of Ms. Bonnie McWhorter 
Duvall. Bonnie recently lost her battle 
with cancer at just 61 years of age. 
Bonnie was the matriarch of a strong 
farm family from Greensboro, Georgia. 
She was a member of the Green County 
Farm Bureau Women’s Committee, a 
mother of four, and a wife to American 
Farm Bureau Federation President 
Zippy Duvall. 
Bonnie and Zippy spent more than 40 
years together, and she enjoyed trav-
eling the country by his side to meet 
with many of our Nation’s farmers over 
the years. 
Though it is a comfort to know that 
Bonnie is no longer suffering, it is a 
great sadness that she was taken from 
her family and friends far too soon. 
I would like to extend my deepest 
sympathies to Zippy and the rest of the 
Duvall family at this difficult time. 
They are, and will continue to be, in 
my prayers.

NATIONAL DEVELOPMENTAL 
DISABILITIES AWARENESS MONTH 
(Mr. TAYLOR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. 
TAYLOR. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
today, I rise to recognize the 33rd Anni-
versary of National Developmental Dis-
abilities Awareness Month. 
This 
important 
commemoration 
serves to raise awareness and promote 
respect for those with intellectual and 
developmental disabilities, while also 
highlighting the importance of inclu-
sion. 
It is estimated there are over 4.6 mil-
lion individuals in the United States, 
and over 250,000 individuals in North 
Texas alone, with intellectual and de-
velopmental disabilities. Texas’ Third 
Congressional District is home to in-
credible organizations, including Cor-
nerstone Ranch, My Possibilities, and 
LifePath Systems. 
Madam Speaker, I am honored to rec-
ognize these dedicated organizations, 
staff, and volunteers serving as stead-
fast advocates fostering opportunity 
for these individuals to realize their 
full potential. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues 
in the House of Representatives to join 
me in thanking these organizations for 
their hard work and recognizing those 
with developmental disabilities.

The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms.

Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, for 
the purpose of debate only, I yield the 
customary 30 minutes to the gentle-
woman from Arizona (Mrs. LESKO), 
pending which I yield myself such time 
as I may consume. During consider-
ation of this resolution, all time yield-

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers be given 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, on 
Monday, the Rules Committee met and 
reported a rule, House Resolution 891, 
providing for consideration of Senate 
amendment to H.R. 2486, S.J. Res. 68, 
and H.R. 6172. 
The rules provide for consideration of 
two House amendments to the Senate 
amendment to H.R. 2486, which con-
tained the text of the NO BAN Act and 
the Access to Counsel Act. 
It also provides for consideration of 
S.J. Res. 68 under a closed rule, with 1 
hour of general debate controlled by 
the chair and ranking minority mem-
ber of the Committee on Foreign Af-
fairs. It also provides the joint resolu-
tion with one motion to commit. 
The rule also provides for consider-
ation of H.R. 6172 under a closed rule, 
with 1 hour of general debate equally 
divided among and controlled by the 
chairs and ranking minority members 
of the Committee on the Judiciary and 
the Permanent Select Committee on 
Intelligence. 
Lastly, this rule self-executes a man-
ager’s amendment from Chairman NAD-
LER to H.R. 6172 and provides one mo-
tion to recommit with or without in-
structions. 
Madam Speaker, we are now 3 years 
into a policy that is the antithesis of 
what this country stands for: the Presi-
dent’s shameful and un-American Mus-
lim ban. President Trump chose Holo-
caust Remembrance Day, of all days, 
to sign his first executive order on this. 
That shut the door to thousands of ref-
ugees fleeing war—the very people who 
had seen America as a beacon of hope 
and were trying to build a better life. 
Instead, this administration turned 
its back on innocent women, children, 
and families desperate to escape vio-
lence. That is callous, that is wrong, 
and it goes against everything America 
is founded on. 
President Trump has claimed his 
Muslim ban is all about national secu-
rity. But let’s be honest here, it was 
never about that. 
It is about a President trying to ful-
fill offensive campaign promises and 
further his harmful rhetoric about 
Muslims. 
As a candidate for President, Donald 
Trump said he would certainly look at 
closing mosques in the United States. 
He floated the idea of creating a data-
base for all Muslim Americans. And he 
even suggested that Muslims in Amer-
ica were cheering as the World Trade 
Centers fell on September 11. What an 
ugly, ugly thing to say. 
Madam Speaker, I could go on and on 
and on. This is truly offensive stuff— 
ideas that should be left somewhere in 
the darkest corners of the internet. 
Then, in December of 2015, he called 
for, ‘‘a total and complete shutdown of 
Muslims entering the United States.’’ 
This ban is his attempt at turning 
that campaign rhetoric into actual pol-
icy, however cruel and unnecessary. 
My colleagues, Representatives CHU, 
JAYAPAL, and ROSE, put its impact best 
when they wrote in a recent op-ed 
piece: ‘‘That means more grandchildren 
who will never be able to kiss their 
grandparents, more loved ones unable 
to say good-bye at a funeral, more 
graduations where the proud student 
has no beaming parents cheering for 
them in the crowd, and more families 
forced to make impossible decisions 
under the most trying circumstances.’’ 
I have met people impacted by the 
Muslim ban, Madam Speaker. It is peo-
ple like Benham Partopour, a chemical 
engineering student getting his Ph.D. 
at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in 
my home district in central Massachu-
setts. 
He is an Iranian national who was in 
Iran when President Trump’s executive 
order went into effect. He had a visa, 
but no airlines were willing to sell 
plane tickets that would allow him to 
return to the United States. So, like 
many other people across the globe, he 
was stranded. 
My office worked with school offi-
cials and the ACLU Massachusetts 
every day until he was able to return 
home to the United States a week 
later. 
This is who the President is afraid of, 
Madam Speaker, a bright young man 
trying to study at a top American uni-
versity. He is just one of the roughly 
135 million people impacted by this pol-
icy. 
This isn’t about crafting sound na-
tional security policy; this is about 
something much more sinister. That is 
shown by the fact that the President 
kept drafting versions of his Muslim 
ban until a watered-down version was 
able to pass legal muster with conserv-
atives on the Supreme Court. But even 
they required the administration to 
grant waivers proving the ban had a 
‘‘legitimate national security inter-
est.’’ 
Yet, the State Department has ap-
proved just 10 percent of all waivers so 
far, just 10 percent. 
Madam Speaker, does this President 
really believe that 90 percent of Mus-
lims from impacted countries are ter-
rorists? There is absolutely no evidence 
of that. 
And it gets worse. According to re-
ports, this administration is now con-
sidering expanding its travel ban to 
even 
more 
countries. 
Enough 
is 
enough. 
Our country already had one of the 
strongest vetting systems anywhere in 
the world. We don’t need any arbitrary 
and offensive bans. We can tell the dif-
ference between a real threat and the 
student traveling back to college. 
That is why this underlying measure 
will reverse the bans the President has 
put in place over the last 3 years, and 
it will ensure people at ports of entry 
can seek legal advice during the 
screening process. 
The principle that our diversity is 
our strength, and the idea that our 
country is strengthened by immigra-
tion, these are core values of this

March 11, 2020 
Democratic majority. That is why we 
have made this a clear choice and pro-
vided a clean up-or-down vote. No stall-
ing tactics. No partisan gimmicks. And 
I think it is an appropriate process be-
cause I want to prevent cynicism and 
ugliness from being celebrated here on 
the House floor. 
The administration’s rhetoric and, 
quite frankly, so many people here on 
this floor have often demonized immi-
grants. It is offensive, and it is not 
worthy of a debate. 
Either you believe we are a nation 
defined by the Statue of Liberty wel-
coming immigrants or one that uses re-
ligious discrimination in immigration 
decisions. I think this is an easy call. 
Also included in this rule, Madam 
Speaker, is a reauthorization of the 
USA FREEDOM Act, as well as a War 
Powers Resolution led by Senator 
KAINE that would require a vote in 
Congress authorizing the use of force 
before the President escalates hos-
tilities in Iran. 
Madam Speaker, this Democratic 
majority promised to take it up if it 
passed the Senate, and I am proud that 
it did, with broad bipartisan support. 
This is not a partisan measure. Eight 
Republicans joined with Senator KAINE 
in supporting this War Powers Resolu-
tion. 
Passage here would send the Kaine 
resolution directly to the President’s 
desk. 
b 1230 
Madam Speaker, I don’t support the 
FISA reauthorization bill. I appreciate 
the bipartisan work that went into try-
ing to fashion a compromise, but in the 
final analysis, I, in good conscience, 
can’t support it. 
But on the other matters, make no 
mistake: This is a historic opportunity. 
Congress has a chance to reassert its 
constitutional authority over matters 
of war and peace; to live up to its Arti-
cle I responsibility; and to truly re-
spect our troops by giving them the de-
bate on the future that they deserve, 
should tensions with Iran escalate 
again. 
I hope all my colleagues seize it, and 
I urge a strong vote for this rule. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume, 
and I thank Representative MCGOVERN 
for yielding me the customary 30 min-
utes. 
Madam Speaker, the rule before us 
today, the Senate amendment to H.R. 
2486, contains the text of two pieces of 
legislation, H.R. 2214 and H.R. 5581, 
along with the Senate version of the 
Affordable Prescriptions for Patients 
Act of 2019 as a pay-for. 
Also included are S.J. Res. 68, a reso-
lution to direct the removal of United 
States Armed Forces from hostilities 
against the Islamic Republic of Iran, 
and H.R. 6172, the USA FREEDOM Re-
authorization Act. 
By combining all of these bills to-
gether, Democrats have prohibited the 
minority, meaning the Republicans, 
the ability to offer a motion to recom-
mit on the floor. The only thing I can 
think of is that I guess they are afraid 
we might pass our seventh MTR, as we 
passed one last week. 
H.R. 2214 eviscerates the President’s 
ability, under the law, to limit who 
may legally enter the United States. 
President Trump has utilized existing 
law to determine which countries fail 
to meet international standards of in-
formation sharing or identity manage-
ment, or were at a high risk of ter-
rorism or public safety concern, and 
the executive orders he issued reflected 
that determination. The majority is 
now seeking to prevent the President 
from ever using that authority again. 
The bill terminates the executive or-
ders currently in place and ceases ‘‘all 
actions taken pursuant to any procla-
mation or executive order terminated’’ 
by the bill, which means that all infor-
mation sharing on terrorists, crimi-
nals, and other security threats would 
cease. 
The seven countries specifically tar-
geted with travel restrictions in Execu-
tive Order 13769 were actually coun-
tries that were determined by Congress 
and the Obama administration to be 
countries of particular concern for ter-
rorism activity. 
This bill contains onerous reporting 
and consultation requirements that 
would effectively prevent the President 
from acting quickly in the event quick 
action would be needed. 
For example, H.R. 2214 requires con-
sultation between only the Secretary 
of State and the Secretary of Home-
land Security. However, this does not 
cover many emergencies the President 
needs to respond to. 
For example, in the event of a disease 
outbreak, 
including 
the 
novel 
coronavirus, the Centers for Disease 
Control would need to be consulted 
with respect to suspending entry of 
certain populations. 
The combined rule also includes H.R. 
5581. This legislation would require the 
Department of Homeland Security to 
ensure that every individual who is 
subject 
to 
a 
secondary 
inspection 
would be guaranteed access to counsel 
or anyone of their choosing within an 
hour. 
This definitely would have serious 
logistical and practical consequences 
for CBP’s ability to quickly and effi-
ciently screen travelers and carry out 
the mission of facilitating unlawful 
trade and travel. CBP conducts over 17 
million 
secondary 
inspections 
each 
year. 
Can you imagine that, for every car, 
a CBP officer is looking at a screen, 
when there is the X-ray machine of the 
car, and they radio over to the CBP of-
ficer at the port of entry and say: 
‘‘Hey, look in the trunk’’? Then, they 
would have to wait an hour if the per-
son objects and says, ‘‘Oh, I want coun-
sel,’’ or, ‘‘I want my relative to come 
within an hour.’’ I mean, this is just 
way onerous. 
This combined rule also contains S.J. 
Res. 68, a resolution to direct the re-
moval of the United States Armed 
Forces from hostilities against the Is-
lamic Republic of Iran. 
First, I want to note that Secretary 
Pompeo testified in front of the House 
Foreign Affairs Committee that ‘‘we 
are not’’ engaged in hostilities against 
Iran. Thus, the joint resolution is un-
necessary. 
While Congress has a constitutional 
duty to authorize the use of military 
force, we should not be issuing blanket 
prohibitions without taking the time 
to develop an appropriate Authoriza-
tion for Use of Military for the Middle 
East. 
The net effect of the bill may be to 
make many U.S. counterterrorism op-
erations in the Middle East illegal. 
Rather than handcuffing our Armed 
Forces, we should be providing them 
with the tools they need to effectively 
combat terrorism against America and 
Americans abroad. 
Lastly, this rule contains H.R. 6172, 
the USA FREEDOM Reauthorization 
Act. This bill reauthorizes expiring 
provisions necessary to defend the 
United States, while also including sig-
nificant reforms to the Foreign Intel-
ligence Surveillance Act to restore ac-
countability. 
In order to ensure that past FISA 
abuses, like those against Carter Page, 
never happen again, numerous reforms 
are included to protect the American 
people from both terrorist threats and 
government overreach. 
For example, the bill requires the At-
torney General to transmit rules to en-
sure that FISA applications are accu-
rate and complete. The Attorney Gen-
eral would also be required to approve, 
in writing, a FISA investigation of an 
elected official or a Federal candidate. 
Also, the FISA court will now tran-
scribe hearings, with DOJ giving FISA 
applications and relevant materials to 
Congress in a timely manner, to ensure 
we can conduct appropriate oversight. 
It also creates a new division within 
DOJ, a compliance officer, that will 
specifically look at these FISA applica-
tions to make sure they are accurate. 
Although I am pleased with much of 
the FISA reform bill, it is unfortunate 
that it is included with a lot of other 
bills in this rule, controversial bills 
that I don’t like. Therefore, I urge op-
position to the rule, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, for the record, I 
want my colleagues to know that 
pandemics 
and 
instances 
like 
the 
coronavirus are already covered by the 
legislation. Nothing in this bill pro-
hibits the President from using author-
ity under section 212(f) to contain the 
coronavirus. 
This bill allows the President to sus-
pend the entry of a class of individuals 
if it is determined that they would un-
dermine the security or public safety of

the United States or the preservation 
of human rights, democratic processes 
or institutions, or international sta-
bility. 
But out of an abundance of caution, 
the Judiciary Committee added a clari-
fication clause on page 7 of the NO 
BAN Act, which clearly states that the 
term ‘‘public safety’’ includes efforts 
necessary to contain a communicable 
disease of public health significance, as 
defined in section 34(2)(b) of title 42, 
Code of Federal Regulations. 
So, this has nothing to do with 
coronavirus. We are taking action on 
this bill basically to end the Presi-
dent’s discriminatory travel bans. 
Madam Speaker, I am quoting from a 
letter from the ACLU that I will in-
clude in the RECORD. 
AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION, 
March 10, 2020. 
VOTE ‘‘YES’’ ON NO BAN ACT, VOTE ‘‘NO’’ ON 
ANY AMENDMENTS OR OTHER CHANGES 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of the 
American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), and 
our more than 8 million members, sup-
porters, and activists, we write to express 
our support for the NO BAN Act, though we 
have concerns about language that has been 
added. As the NO BAN Act is scheduled for a 
floor vote this week, it is essential that no 
further changes be made to the bill—so that 
this authority cannot be used to ban whole 
communities. 
We urge you to vote ‘‘YES’’ on the NO BAN 
Act in its current form and vote ‘‘NO’’ on 
any amendments or other changes. The 
ACLU will score this vote. 
The ACLU continues to support the version 
of the NO BAN Act scheduled for a floor vote 
this week. However, we have concerns about 
recent language included in the bill defining 
public safety to address ‘‘communicable dis-
ease’’ in response to the current climate and 
fear around COVID–19 (coronavirus). These 
changes are unnecessary and further stig-
matize immigrant communities where many 
are facing discrimination in the United 
States given the Trump administration’s 
stereotypes about communities of color and 
immigrants—including 
in 
reference 
to 
coronavirus. There is a long history in the 
United States of inaccurate connections be-
tween health risks and immigrants, which 
has resulted in irrational immigration poli-
cies and discrimination; we are not inter-
ested in repeating the mistakes of our past. 
Any restrictions related to coronavirus, such 
as those regarding China and Iran, must be 
based in science and public health, not poli-
tics or xenophobia. 
The NO BAN Act continues to achieve the 
ultimate goals of the legislation, which are 
to rescind the Muslim ban, refugee Muslim 
ban, and asylum ban, and make critical 
changes to the Immigration and Nationality 
Act (INA) by putting in place a more strin-
gent standard for presidents invoking any 
similar suspension or restriction. During the 
House Judiciary Committee markup, the bill 
was amended to rescind the President’s re-
cently expanded Muslim ban which was 
issued on January 31st, and targets more Af-
rican countries, and requires visa reporting 
related to this ban. 
Under current law, the executive branch 
claims the authority to bar the entry of 
large groups of people without effective ac-
countability and without regard for the poli-
cies codified in other parts of the INA. The 
NO BAN Act would strengthen limitations 
on this authority by raising the standard for 
invoking it. Rather than the current broad 
and undefined standard, the proposed bill 
would require the executive branch to meet 
a more stringent standard—based on ‘‘spe-
cific and credible facts’’ that any suspension 
of or restriction from entry must be con-
nected to ‘‘specific acts’’ that have actually 
occurred. Furthermore, the bill requires that 
any such suspension or restriction meet a 
compelling government interest and that the 
government use the least restrictive means 
in doing so. 
The NO BAN Act would also establish a 
system of checks and balances whereby Con-
gress would be routinely notified and briefed 
on the status, implementation and constitu-
tional and legislative authority of the execu-
tive branch’s actions. Finally, the proposed 
legislation would expand the non-discrimina-
tion provision of the INA to prohibit dis-
crimination based on religion. While lan-
guage connecting these two critical changes 
to the INA has been removed, the bill now 
includes a rule of construction indicating 
that the President, Secretary of State, and 
Secretary of Homeland Security cannot use 
this authority to act in a manner that is in-
consistent with other policy decisions in im-
migration law. 
This bill is a significant step forward for 
Muslim communities and other communities 
that could be targeted discriminatorily or 
without good reason. By creating sub-
stantive standards and accountability, it 
greatly reduces the possibility of future bias- 
based bans. 
The ACLU urges you to vote ‘‘YES’’ on the 
NO BAN Act in its current form and vote 
‘‘NO’’ on any amendments or other changes. 
Thank you for your attention to this matter. 
Sincerely, 
RONALD NEWMAN, 
National Political Di-
rector. 
MANAR WAHEED, 
Senior Legislative and 
Advocacy Counsel. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, 
one of the things they point out here, 
which I want to agree with, is that 
they say: ‘‘There is a long history in 
the United States of inaccurate con-
nections between health risks and im-
migrants, which has resulted in irra-
tional immigration policies and dis-
crimination; we are not interested in 
repeating the mistakes of our past. 
Any 
restrictions 
related 
to 
coronavirus, such as those regarding 
China and Iran, must be based in 
science and public health, not politics 
or xenophobia.’’ 
What a radical idea, to actually base 
some of these decisions on science. Yet, 
we know that this administration 
doesn’t have any regard for science. 
Madam Speaker, I will also include 
in the RECORD a May 20 Washington 
Post article titled ‘‘ ‘I think Islam 
hates us’: A timeline of Trump’s com-
ments about Islam and Muslims.’’ 
[From the Washington Post, May 20, 2017] 
I THINK ISLAM HATES US: A TIMELINE
OF 
TRUMP’S COMMENTS ABOUT ISLAM AND MUS-
LIMS 
(By Jenna Johnson and Abigail Hauslohner) 
President Trump is in Saudi Arabia this 
weekend to meet with Arab leaders, visit the 
birthplace of Islam and give a speech about 
religious tolerance with the hope of resetting 
his reputation with the world’s 1.6 billion 
Muslims. But it’s unclear if a two-day visit 
is enough to overshadow his past statements 
about Islam and its faithful, with his rhet-
oric becoming more virulent as he cam-
paigned for president. 
Here’s a look back at some of the com-
ments that he has made: 
March 30, 2011: For years, Trump publicly 
questioned then-President Barack Obama’s 
religious beliefs and place of birth. As he de-
bated running for president in the 2012 elec-
tion, Trump said in a radio interview: ‘‘He 
doesn’t have a birth certificate, or if he does, 
there’s something on that certificate that is 
very bad for him. Now, somebody told me— 
and I have no idea if this is bad for him or 
not, but perhaps it would be—that where it 
says ‘religion,’ it might have ‘Muslim.’ And 
if you’re a Muslim, you don’t change your re-
ligion, by the way.’’ (Obama is a Christian, 
and state records show he was born in Ha-
waii.) 
Sept. 17, 2015: At a campaign town hall in 
New Hampshire, a man in the audience 
shouted out: ‘‘We have a problem in this 
country; it’s called Muslims. We know our 
current president is one.’’ The man men-
tioned Muslim ‘‘training camps’’ and asked: 
‘‘When can we get rid of them?’’ Trump re-
sponded: ‘‘We’re going to be looking at a lot 
of different things. You know, a lot of people 
are saying that, and a lot of people are say-
ing that bad things are happening out there. 
We’re going to be looking at that and plenty 
of other things.’’ 
Sept. 20, 2015: On NBC News, Trump was 
asked if he would be comfortable with a Mus-
lim as president; he responded: ‘‘I can say 
that, you know, it’s something that at some 
point could happen. We will see. I mean, you 
know, it’s something that could happen. 
Would I be comfortable? I don’t know if we 
have to address it right now, but I think it 
is certainly something that could happen.’’ 
Sept. 30, 2015: At a New Hampshire rally, 
Trump pledged to kick all Syrian refugees— 
most of whom are Muslim—out of the coun-
try, as they might be a secret army. ‘‘They 
could be ISIS, I don’t know. This could be 
one of the great tactical ploys of all time. A 
200,000–man army, maybe,’’ he said. In an 
interview that aired later, Trump said: ‘‘This 
could make the Trojan horse look like pea-
nuts.’’ 
Oct. 21, 2015: On Fox Business, Trump says 
he would ‘‘certainly look at’’ the idea of 
closing mosques in the United States. 
Nov. 16, 2015: Following a series of terrorist 
attacks in Paris, Trump said on MSNBC that 
he 
would 
‘‘strongly 
consider’’ 
closing 
mosques. ‘‘I would hate to do it, but it’s 
something that you’re going to have to 
strongly consider because some of the ideas 
and some of the hatred—the absolute ha-
tred—is coming from these areas,’’ he said. 
Nov. 20, 2015: In comments to Yahoo and 
NBC News, Trump seemed open to the idea of 
creating a database of all Muslims in the 
United States. Later, he and his aides would 
not rule out the idea. 
Nov. 21, 2015: At a rally in Alabama, Trump 
said that on Sept. 11 he ‘‘watched when the 
World Trade Center came tumbling down. 
And I watched in Jersey City, N.J., where 
thousands and thousands of people were 
cheering as that building was coming down.’’ 
Nov. 22, 2015: On ABC News, Trump doubled 
down on his comment and added: ‘‘It was 
well covered at the time. There were people 
over in New Jersey that were watching it, a 
heavy Arab population, that were cheering 
as the buildings came down. Not good.’’ 
(While there were some reports of celebra-
tions overseas, extensive examination of 
news clips turn up no such celebrations in 
New Jersey.) 
Nov. 30, 2015: On MSNBC, a reporter asked 
Trump if he thinks Islam is an inherently 
peaceful religion that’s been perverted by a 
small percentage of followers or if it is an in-
herently violent religion. Trump responded:

‘‘Well, all I can say . . . there’s something 
going on. You know, there’s something defi-
nitely going on. I don’t know that that ques-
tion can be answered.’’ He also said: ‘‘We are 
not loved by many Muslims.’’ 
Dec. 3, 2015: The morning after Syed 
Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik killed 14 
people in San Bernardino, Calif., Trump 
called into Fox News and said: ‘‘The other 
thing with the terrorists is you have to take 
out their families, when you get these ter-
rorists, you have to take out their families.’’ 
(Killing the relatives of suspected terrorists 
is forbidden by international law.) Later, in 
a speech to the Republican Jewish Coalition, 
Trump criticized Obama for not using the 
phrase ‘‘radical Islamic terrorism’’ and com-
mented: ‘‘There’s something going on with 
him that we don’t know about.’’ 
Dec. 6, 2015: On CBS News, Trump said: ‘‘If 
you have people coming out of mosques with 
hatred and death in their eyes and on their 
minds, we’re going to have to do something.’’ 
Trump also said he didn’t believe the sister 
of one of the San Bernardino shooters who 
said she was crestfallen for the victims, say-
ing: ‘‘I would go after a lot of people, and I 
would find out whether or not they knew. I 
would be able to find out, because I don’t be-
lieve the sister.’’ 
Dec. 7, 2015: Trump’s campaign issued a 
statement saying: ‘‘Donald J. Trump is call-
ing for a total and complete shutdown of 
Muslims entering the United States until 
our country’s representatives can figure out 
what is going on.’’ Trump read this state-
ment aloud at a rally in South Carolina. 
Dec. 8, 2015: On CNN, Trump quoted a wide-
ly debunked poll by an anti-Islam activist 
organization that claimed that a quarter of 
the Muslims living in the United States 
agreed that violence against Americans is 
justified as part of the global jihad. ‘‘We 
have people out there that want to do great 
destruction to our country, whether it’s 25 
percent or 10 percent or 5 percent, it’s too 
much,’’ Trump said. 
Dec. 13, 2015: On Fox News, Trump was 
asked if his ban would apply to a Canadian 
businessman who is a Muslim. Trump re-
sponded: ‘‘There’s a sickness. They’re sick 
people. There’s a sickness going on. There’s 
a group of people that is very sick.’’ 
Jan. 12, 2016: At a rally in Iowa, Trump 
shared his suspicions about Syrian refugees 
and then read the lyrics to Al Wilson’s 1968 
song ‘‘The Snake,’’ the story of a ‘‘tender 
woman’’ who nursed a sickly snake back to 
health but then was attacked by the snake. 
Trump often read these lyrics at rallies. 
Feb. 3, 2016: Trump criticized Obama for 
visiting a mosque in Baltimore and said on 
Fox News: ‘‘Maybe he feels comfortable there 
. . . There are a lot of places he can go, and 
he chose a mosque.’’ (It was Obama’s first 
visit to a mosque during his presidency, and 
it was made in an effort to encourage reli-
gious 
tolerance 
in 
light 
of 
growing 
antiMuslim sentiment.) 
Feb. 20, 2016: After Obama skipped the fu-
neral of Supreme Court Justice Antonin 
Scalia, Trump tweeted: ‘‘I wonder if Presi-
dent Obama would have attended the funeral 
of Justice Scalia if it were held in a Mosque? 
Very sad that he did not go!’’ (Obama did pay 
his respects when Scalia’s body lay in repose 
in the Supreme Court.) That night at a rally 
in South Carolina, Trump told an apocryphal 
tale that he would return to repeatedly 
about U.S. Gen. John J. Pershing fighting 
Muslim insurgents in the Philippines in the 
early 1900s and killing a large group of insur-
gents with bullets dipped in pigs’ blood. 
March 9, 2016: On CNN, Trump said: ‘‘I 
think Islam hates us. There’s something 
there that—there’s a tremendous hatred 
there. There’s a tremendous hatred. We have 
to get to the bottom of it. There’s an unbe-
lievable hatred of us.’’ 
March 22, 2016: Soon after three suicide 
bombings in Brussels tied to a group of 
French and Belgian Muslims, Trump told 
Fox Business: ‘‘We’re having problems with 
the Muslims, and we’re having problems with 
Muslims coming into the country.’’ Trump 
called for surveillance of mosques in the 
United States, saying: ‘‘You have to deal 
with the mosques, whether we like it or not, 
I mean, you know, these attacks aren’t com-
ing out of—they’re not done by Swedish peo-
ple.’’ 
On NBC News, Trump added: ‘‘This all hap-
pened because, frankly, there’s no assimila-
tion. They are not assimilating . . . They 
want to go by sharia law. They want sharia 
law. They don’t want the laws that we have. 
They want sharia law.’’ 
March 23, 2016: In an interview with 
Bloomberg TV, Trump said that Muslims 
‘‘have to respect us. They do not respect us 
at all. And frankly, they don’t respect a lot 
of the things that are happening throughout 
not only our country, but they don’t respect 
other things.’’ 
March 29, 2016: During a town hall in Wis-
consin, 
CNN’s 
Anderson 
Cooper 
asked 
Trump: ‘‘Do you trust Muslims in America?’’ 
Trump responded: ‘‘Do I what?’’ Cooper 
again asked: ’Trust Muslims in America?’’ 
Trump responded: ‘‘Many of them I do. Many 
of them I do, and some, I guess, we don’t. 
Some, I guess, we don’t. We have a problem, 
and we can try and be very politically cor-
rect and pretend we don’t have a problem, 
but, Anderson, we have a major, major prob-
lem. This is, in a sense, this is a war.’’ 
May 20, 2016: On Fox News, Trump said this 
of Muslims: ‘‘They’re going to have to turn 
in the people that are bombing the planes. 
And they know who the people are. And 
we’re not going to find the people by just 
continuing to be so nice and so soft.’’ 
June 13, 2016: The day after the mass shoot-
ing at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Trump de-
clared in a speech in New Hampshire that 
‘‘radical Islam is anti-woman, anti-gay and 
anti-American.’’ He criticized his Demo-
cratic rival, Hillary Clinton, for refusing to 
use the term ‘‘radical Islam’’ and for speak-
ing positively of Islam. ‘‘Hillary Clinton’s 
catastrophic immigration plan will bring 
vastly more radical Islamic immigration 
into this country, threatening not only our 
society but our entire way of life. When it 
comes to radical Islamic terrorism, igno-
rance is not bliss. It’s deadly—totally dead-
ly,’’ Trump said. Later he added: ‘‘I want 
every American to succeed, including Mus-
lims—but the Muslims have to work with us. 
They have to work with us. They know 
what’s going on.’’ 
June 14, 2016: At a rally in North Carolina, 
Trump noted that the Orlando shooter’s par-
ents are Muslim Americans who immigrated 
from Afghanistan. ‘‘The children of Muslim 
American parents, they’re responsible for a 
growing number for whatever reason a grow-
ing number of terrorist attacks,’’ he said, 
adding that immigration from Afghanistan 
has increased five-fold. ‘‘ . . . Every year we 
bring in more than 100,000 lifetime immi-
grants from the Middle East and many more 
from Muslim countries outside of the Middle 
East. A number of these immigrants have 
hostile attitudes.’’ 
June 15, 2016: On Fox News, Trump said 
this of Muslims who immigrate to the United 
States: ‘‘Assimilation has been very hard. 
It’s almost—I won’t say nonexistent, but it 
gets to be pretty close. And I’m talking 
about second and third generation. They 
come—they don’t—for some reason, there’s 
no real assimilation.’’ 
July 21, 2016: In accepting the Republican 
Party’s presidential nomination, Trump fo-
cused heavily on ‘‘brutal Islamic terrorism’’ 
and promised: ‘‘I will do everything in my 
power to protect our LGBTQ citizens from 
the violence and oppression of a hateful for-
eign ideology.’’ 
July 24, 2016: On NBC News, Trump de-
fended his proposal for a Muslim ban, despite 
some of his aides insisting he had rolled it 
back. ‘‘People were so upset when I used the 
word Muslim. ‘Oh, you can’t use the word 
Muslim,’ ’’ Trump said. ‘‘. . . But just re-
member this: Our Constitution is great, but 
it doesn’t necessarily give us the right to 
commit suicide, okay? Now, we have a reli-
gious—you know, everybody wants to be pro-
tected. And that’s great. And that’s the won-
derful part of our Constitution. I view it dif-
ferently. Why are we committing suicide? 
Why are we doing that?’’ 
Aug. 11, 2016: At a meeting of evangelical 
leaders in Orlando, Trump said: ‘‘If you were 
a Christian in Syria, it was virtually impos-
sible to come into the United States. If you 
were a Muslim from Syria, it was one of the 
easier countries to be able to find your way 
into the United States. Think of that. Just 
think of what that means.’’ 
Aug. 18, 2016: During a rally in North Caro-
lina, Trump said that ‘‘all applicants for im-
migration will be vetted for ties to radical 
ideology, and we will screen out anyone who 
doesn’t share our values and love our peo-
ple.’’ 
Sept. 19, 2016: At a rally in Florida, Trump 
reacted to explosions over the weekend in 
New York and New Jersey and said: ‘‘There 
have been Islamic terrorist attacks in Min-
nesota and New York City and in New Jer-
sey. These attacks and many others were 
made possible because of our extremely open 
immigration system, which fails to properly 
vet and screen the individuals and families 
coming into our country. Got to be careful.’’ 
Jan. 27, 2017: Within a week of becoming 
president, Trump signed an executive order 
blocking Syrian refugees and banning citi-
zens of seven predominantly Muslim coun-
tries from entering the United States for 90 
days. This order goes into effect imme-
diately, prompting mass chaos at airports, 
protests and legal challenges. Rudolph W. 
Giuliani, a close adviser to the president, 
later said on Fox News: ‘‘So when [Trump] 
first announced it, he said, ‘Muslim ban.’ He 
called me up. He said, ‘Put a commission to-
gether. Show me the right way to do it le-
gally.’ ’’ 
Feb. 28, 2017: Despite urging from some of 
his Cabinet members, Trump continues to 
use the term ‘‘radical Islamic terrorism,’’ in-
cluding in a speech to a joint session of Con-
gress. 
March 6, 2017: Trump issues a new travel 
ban for citizens from six majority-Muslim 
countries, which is also challenged in the 
courts. 
April 29, 2017: At a rally celebrating his 
100th day in office, Trump once again dra-
matically read ‘‘The Snake.’’ 
May 17, 2017: At a commencement cere-
mony, Trump previewed his upcoming over-
seas trip and said: ‘‘I’ll speak with Muslim 
leaders and challenge them to fight hatred 
and extremism and embrace a peaceful fu-
ture for their faith. And they’re looking very 
much forward to hearing what we, as your 
representative, we have to say. We have to 
stop radical Islamic terrorism.’’ 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, 
the President’s comments and tweets 
about Muslims are truly, truly offen-
sive, and I could list everything he said 
here today, but it is a long, long list. I 
think repeating those words would be a 
mistake because they are unworthy of 
this floor.

tinues a sad and unfortunate history of

March 11, 2020 
policies that used immigration law to 
target people based on their back-
grounds. We have had policies in our 
history that targeted immigrants from 
China, Japan, and Asia, and laws that 
qualified people of White descent for 
naturalization at the expense of every-
one else. 
Those policies are wrong. They are 
shameful. And they went against ev-
erything this country stands for. Presi-
dent Trump’s Muslim ban belongs right 
beside them, in the dustbin of history, 
as well. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I yield 
4 minutes to the gentleman from Okla-
homa (Mr. COLE), my good friend. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman from Arizona, my 
good friend, for yielding time. And 
frankly, I want to associate myself 
with her remarks about the underlying 
legislation. 
My remarks, Madam Speaker, will 
focus on the manner in which the bills 
that are before us are being brought to 
the floor. 
It is, frankly, very disappointing to 
me, Madam Speaker, that this even 
needs to be said. But given the grave 
consequences of what the majority is 
proposing to do procedurally, I cannot 
condemn today’s rule strongly enough. 
In today’s measure, what the major-
ity is proposing amounts to a de facto 
change to the House rules, one that 
will trample on the rights of the mi-
nority and deny any opportunity to 
amend the bill on the floor. 
Rather than bringing up the two im-
migration items as the standalone bills 
that they actually are, the majority 
has instead chosen the procedural gim-
mick of using a Senate-amended House 
bill to package these items together. 
This has the same effect of denying the 
minority the more than 100-year-old 
right to make a motion to recommit, 
or MTR, as they are commonly known, 
before moving to final passage. 
This is because, under House rules, 
the minority is not allowed to offer an 
MTR on any House measures that have 
been amended by the Senate. Of course, 
for the majority, the denial of the mi-
nority’s traditional rights to an MTR 
is the whole point of this procedural 
exercise. These underhanded proce-
dural shenanigans are specifically in-
tended to deny the minority the right 
to an MTR on these bills. 
Before my friend, the chairman, re-
sponds with the number of times a Re-
publican majority used this procedure, 
let me be perfectly clear. As he knows, 
we never, never did that as a means to 
deny the minority an MTR. In fact, we 
did it in consultation with the minor-
ity and with the sole goal of accel-
erating passage of key bipartisan legis-
lation in the Senate. 
So, why does the Democratic major-
ity insist on these procedural gym-
nastics? I can think of only one reason: 
The majority is embarrassed that the 
minority has now passed an MTR six 
times in this Congress, including one 
just last week. 
Madam Speaker, this is now the sec-
ond time in the past 6 weeks that the 
majority is explicitly adopting a proce-
dure to deny the minority our rights. 
b 1245 
I think that if the majority is really 
so frightened of the motion to recom-
mit and they really want to do away 
with MTRs, then they should change 
the standing rules of the House, and 
that needs to happen on a vote on the 
House floor so that everyone can see 
what the majority is actually doing 
and how it operates. 
When Republicans were in the major-
ity, the thought of limiting the use of 
the MTR to silence minority voices 
never once crossed our minds, and that 
is because we recognized the impor-
tance of the MTR to this institution. It 
has been around since the very begin-
ning of the institution, and it has been 
in its present form since 1909. 
In fact, in 1919, Representative Abra-
ham Garrett of Tennessee was quoted 
as saying: ‘‘The motion to recommit is 
regarded as so sacred it is one of the 
few things protected against the Com-
mittee on Rules by the general rules of 
the House.’’ 
Evidently, not anymore. 
The present majority is not content 
with that state of affairs, which is why 
they are trying, once again, to do an 
end run around the House rules and 
adopt a procedural gimmick specifi-
cally to stop the minority from exer-
cising its right to an MTR. It is beyond 
disappointing, Madam Speaker. 
It is shocking that the majority 
would feel the need to rig the entire 
system to shut us up. My goodness, 
they have a 35-seat majority. But we 
all know why that is. It is because the 
majority cannot effectively defend its 
own policies. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I yield 
an additional 30 seconds to the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma. 
Mr. COLE. So, today, Madam Speak-
er, I call on all Members to vote ‘‘no’’ 
on this rule. I ask that my colleagues, 
regardless of party, reject this rigged 
process, reject this rule, and act to pro-
tect the rights of every Member of this 
Chamber. The future of the institution 
depends on it. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself as much time as I may 
consume. 
Madam Speaker, I have high regard 
for my ranking member, Mr. COLE, and 
I know he and I both share enormous 
respect for this institution, but I am 
going to say for the Record that this 
process that we are using is not un-
usual. It is a process that was used by 
Republicans numerous times during 
their majority, including 15 times dur-
ing the past two Republican-led Con-
gresses, to send bills over to the Senate 
for their expedited consideration. 
And I will say, with respect to the 
gentleman, he mentioned that we were 
consulted about these processes in the 
past. I was never consulted when the 
Republicans used this process. In fact, 
I remember a time when the Repub-
licans basically hijacked a Democratic 
bill to attach something to it, without 
even consulting the sponsor of the bill. 
So I am not sure what the gentleman 
was alluding to, and I don’t know what 
my friend’s intentions were when they 
utilized this process. 
Madam Speaker, I can’t speak to the 
motivations of the previous majority 
when they used this process over a 
dozen times, but what I can speak to is 
the impact. Each time this process was 
used by the Republican majority, the 
Democratic minority was unable to 
offer a motion to recommit. That is 
just a fact. 
Republicans used this process 15 
times over the past two Congresses, 
and, you know, I get it. My Republican 
friends want to have an opportunity to 
try to politicize this debate even more 
around immigration. But I just want to 
remind everybody why we are here. 
The offensive things that this Presi-
dent has said about immigrants and 
about Muslims are unconscionable. 
These travel bans serve no purpose 
other than to discriminate against 
Muslims and people from predomi-
nantly Muslim countries. 
President Trump issued these base-
less travel bans under the guise of na-
tional security. But we all know what 
they are really about. They fulfill 
Trump’s offensive campaign promise 
calling for a ‘‘total and complete shut-
down of Muslims entering the United 
States.’’ 
Those are the President’s words. 
These discriminatory bans have a 
real impact on real people’s lives and 
have already affected more than 135 
million individuals. So that is why we 
are debating whether to terminate the 
travel bans and to stand up against dis-
crimination and hate without any dis-
tractions, without any political gim-
micks. 
I know my friends are not happy with 
that, but we are going to do the right 
thing. We are going to stand up to hate 
and bigotry and discrimination, and we 
are going to move this legislation for-
ward, and everybody will have an up- 
or-down vote. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, before 
I yield time to my friend, I want to 
point out again that Mr. COLE has been 
here a long time, and when he says to 
the public on the floor that when Re-
publicans used this process of com-
bining the bills together in a rule that 
it was to expedite it over to the Sen-
ate, I believe him. And so I believe that 
their motivation is different, and that 
is to prevent the minority from having 
a motion to recommit. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 10 minutes to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Georgia 
(Mr. 
WOODALL), my good friend. 
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend from Arizona for 
yielding.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1605 
March 11, 2020 
I want to stipulate, Madam Speaker, 
that I have seen the gentleman from 
Massachusetts, the leader of our com-
mittee, do some things on that com-
mittee that no one else has tried to do. 
I was in this institution for a decade 
as a chief of staff, now a decade as a 
Member of Congress, and he has done 
some amazing things that I believe will 
serve this institution and serve the 
committee, not just this Congress, but 
next Congress and for decades to come. 
And I applaud him and his very capable 
team for pushing those initiatives for-
ward. 
But, today, Madam Speaker, we are 
talking about the exact opposite side of 
that coin, things that are done in the 
name of expediency today that may 
well do damage to this institution, not 
just this Congress and next Congress, 
but for decades to come. Habits happen 
in this institution, Madam Speaker. 
Habits happen. 
My friend from Massachusetts used 
to work for a great leader in this insti-
tution, Mr. Joe Moakley. In fact, his 
picture hangs on the wall as a former 
chairman of the Rules Committee. 
I used to work for a great Member of 
this institution as well, Madam Speak-
er, Mr. John Linder, out of the great 
State of Georgia. He also served on the 
Rules Committee. 
As we come down to the floor today, 
for my friends of the majority to de-
fend for the second time in 6 weeks 
taking away the minority’s right to 
have any input on the process whatso-
ever, I thought I would go back 20 
years from today, back to the year 
2000, when the gentleman from Massa-
chusetts’ former boss and my former 
boss sat in these very same chairs. 
At that time, Madam Speaker, Re-
publicans were in the majority. I will 
go back to October 3 of 2000 when Mr. 
Linder took to the floor and said: 
And the rule provides a motion to recom-
mit, as is the right of the minority. 
Republicans were in control, com-
plete control, of this institution. They 
could jam anything through that they 
wanted to jam through. But it was the 
right of the minority to have at least a 
final voice and a final opportunity to 
amend the bill. 
October 12, a week later, Mr. Linder 
and Mr. Moakley were on the floor 
again. Mr. Linder says: 
And, finally, the rule provides for one mo-
tion to recommit, as is the right of the mi-
nority. 
Again, Madam Speaker, October 19 of 
that same year, just a week after that, 
Mr. Linder and Mr. Moakley on the 
floor again: 
The rule provides a motion to recommit, as 
is the right of the minority. 
We will go a week after that, Madam 
Speaker. Same two gentlemen on the 
floor again, same Republican majority 
in charge. Mr. Linder, on the floor: 
Resolution . . . as is the right of the mi-
nority. 
A week after that, Madam Speaker: 
Motion to recommit, with or without in-
structions, as is the right of the minority. 
I will go on and on and on. Because 20 
years ago, it was not a question of 
whether or not the minority would 
have a single voice. Remember, Madam 
Speaker, these bills that the gentleman 
from Massachusetts is talking about, 
these immigration bills, went through 
committee, no Republican amendments 
were adopted; went to the Rules Com-
mittee, no Republican amendments 
were made in order. There has been ab-
solutely no minority input of any kind 
on these bills he is talking about. 
There is so much more in this under-
lying bill. But 20 years ago, the habit 
was we would recognize that the mi-
nority has a right. 
In fact, I don’t even need to go back 
20 years, Madam Speaker. I serve on 
the Select Committee on Moderniza-
tion. That is a bipartisan committee 
here in the House that is designed to 
look at the current rules and organiza-
tion of the House and talk about how it 
is that we can do better. 
I don’t have to go back 20 years, 
Madam Speaker. I can go back to last 
year, March 13, 2019, a press release 
from the Speaker of the House, NANCY 
PELOSI, on the remarks that she made 
in front of that joint select committee 
looking at modernizing the institution. 
And she said: Some people have talked 
about changing the motion to recom-
mit, this or that. But she said: 
I am a big respecter of the rights of the mi-
nority in the Congress of the United States, 
and I believe as Speaker of the whole House 
that initiatives you put forth must come 
from the whole House. 
We are looking at how to make the 
motion to recommit better, Madam 
Speaker. I will take us back to a pre-
scription drugs bill just a few short 
weeks ago, where the minority traded 
away its right to a motion to recommit 
in favor of a complete substitute. 
Let’s debate the issues instead of the 
motion to recommit. The motion to re-
commit that passed last week, Madam 
Speaker, said let’s not allow violent 
convicted criminals to serve as TSA 
agents. 
This is what the majority is pro-
tecting America from: amendments 
from the minority that would protect 
TSA employees from working side by 
side with violent convicted felons. This 
isn’t 
an 
adversarial 
idea, 
Madam 
Speaker. This is an idea that we all 
agreed on, which is why it passed with 
great bipartisan support. 
You never know when the bad habits 
you get into are going to stick. 
I will take you back to a time when 
my friend, Mr. MCGOVERN, and my 
ranking member, Mr. COLE, were on 
the floor just few short years ago, and 
my friend from Massachusetts said 
this. He said: 
Mr. Speaker, I have nothing but the high-
est respect for my colleague from Oklahoma 
(Mr. COLE), and I know he wants this House 
to run better. But the fact of the matter is 
I feel bad that he has to defend this lousy, 
restrictive, indefensible process. That is our 
job on the Rules Committee sometimes. 
And I want to say to my friend from 
Massachusetts, as he said to our friend 
from Oklahoma: I have nothing but the 
highest respect for my colleague from 
Massachusetts, and I know that he 
wants this House to run better. But the 
fact of the matter is I feel bad that he 
has to defend this lousy, restrictive, in-
defensible process. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, let me just say for 
the record, nobody is changing the 
MTR. We are using a process that my 
Republican friends used over a dozen 
times in the past, in the last Congress. 
Yes, the Rules Committee has an ob-
ligation to try to make sure that we 
bring important legislation to the floor 
in a fair and reasonable process, and we 
are doing that. 
But we also have an obligation—— 
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, will 
the gentleman yield? 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
would prefer not to be interrupted. I 
am in the middle of—Madam Speaker, 
I yield to the gentleman from Georgia, 
because he keeps on interrupting me. 
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I 
don’t think of it as interrupting. I 
apologize to Chairman MCGOVERN. I 
think of it as elucidating. 
What my friend has said is absolutely 
right. This process has been used be-
fore, just not for this purpose, which is 
why Politico ran—— 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
reclaim my time. 
Do you know what? The result, when 
my friends used this process, is the 
same. We were not allowed to offer an 
MTR to any of the bills when they uti-
lized this process. 
b 1300 
And so, I just state that that is just 
a fact. But the Rules Committee also 
has an obligation, and I believe every-
body in this House has an obligation to 
stand up against bigotry and hate and 
racism and religious discrimination, 
and that is what these underlying bills 
deal with. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD a February 16, 2020, The Guard-
ian article, titled; ‘‘ ‘Trump is deciding 
who is American’: how the new travel 
ban is tearing families apart.’’ 
[From the Guardian, Feb. 16, 2020] 
TRUMP IS DECIDING WHO IS AMERICAN: HOW 
THE NEW TRAVEL BAN IS TEARING FAMILIES 
APART 
(By Sean Levin) 
It started out as a joyous day for Olumide. 
On 31 January, the 32-year-old Nigerian 
American learned in an email that the US 
was finally processing the visa applications 
of his wife and daughter in Nigeria. 
Hours later, Donald Trump shattered their 
celebration, announcing that he was adding 
six countries to the travel ban, including Ni-
geria. The decision cuts off pathways to per-
manent US residency for Nigerians, throwing 
Olumide’s case into limbo at the final stage 
of the process. It leaves his wife and and 11- 
year-old girl stuck across an ocean with lit-
tle hope of making it to the US. 
‘‘This is inhuman,’’ said Olumide, a sys-
tems analyst and US military veteran who

served in Afghanistan and lives in Wash-
ington DC. He asked to use his middle name 
out of fear he might jeopardize his case. ‘‘As 
a soldier, I understand the need to protect 
the country. But to completely shut the 
doors . . . it’s just plain wrong.’’ 
MILLIONS OF AFRICANS NOW BANNED: ‘WE ARE 
NOT CRIMINALS’ 
Trump’s January order builds on the 2017 
travel ban that has continued to target five 
Muslim-majority 
countries, 
and 
signifi-
cantly restricts permanent residency for na-
tionals from Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Nigeria 
and Myanmar. It also blocks people from 
Tanzania and Sudan from obtaining green 
cards through the ‘‘diversity visa’’ lottery. 
Just like the 2017 restrictions, it blocks 
permanent immigration from the targeted 
countries, making limited exceptions if ap-
plicants prove that denials would cause 
‘‘undue hardship’’ and that granting them 
visas would support ‘‘national interest’’. 
The original ban already resulted in denied 
visas for more than 42,000 people, the major-
ity from Iran. The addition of the new coun-
tries has doubled the number of Muslims tar-
geted across the globe to roughly 320 million, 
advocates estimate. Roughly one-quarter of 
all Africans are now affected. The restric-
tions now apply to 13 countries, including 
Nigeria, home to Africa’s largest population 
and economy. It cuts off countries where 
some are fleeing violence. Some estimate the 
new ban, which goes into effect on 21 Feb-
ruary, could hinder more than 12,000 immi-
grants seeking to resettle in the US and re-
unite with family in the next year. 
The restrictions are a signature component 
of Trump’s aggressive anti-immigrant agen-
da, which has included curbs on legal migra-
tion, a destruction of theAmerican asylum 
system, an all-time low cap on refugees, ex-
panded detention and mass deportations. 
‘‘Trump started out by scapegoating Mus-
lims in 2017,’’ said Javeria Jamil, attorney 
with Asian Americans Advancing Justice’s 
Asian Law Caucus, who has been fielding 
calls from families affected by the new ban. 
‘‘Now, it’s not just the Muslim ban. It has 
turned into an African ban.’’ 
The Trump administration has claimed 
that the ban, which blindsided some dip-
lomats, is a national security measure, and 
that the added countries failed to meet US 
security and information-sharing standards. 
But immigrant rights groups said the pol-
icy is a political maneuver amid Trump’s re-
election campaign—and one that will have 
profound consequences. 
‘‘People are in turmoil,’’ said Audu Kadiri, 
a 43-year-old community organizer who left 
Nigeria in 2014. He had planned to bring his 
mother to the US, but the ban may make 
that impossible. The activist, who now lives 
in the Bronx, hasn’t yet told his mother 
about Trump’s order, because he doesn’t 
know how to break the news. ‘‘There is so 
much collateral damage, it’s hard to quan-
tify.’’ 
In Nigeria, Kadiri was an LGBTQ+ rights 
advocate who worked on HIV prevention and 
other human rights issues. He was forced to 
flee due to his activism and sought asylum 
in the US. It’s now unsafe for him to return 
to Nigeria, which is why he wants his 68- 
year-old mother to come to the US. 
He hasn’t seen her since 2014 and, if Trump 
is re-elected, he fears it will be at least an-
other five years before they reunite. She’ll 
probably miss the birth of his third child. 
‘‘Nigerians have contributed to the devel-
opment of this country, like every immi-
grant community,’’ he said. ‘‘We are not 
criminals.’’ 
TORN APART, WITH DWINDLING OPTIONS 
Before the January announcement, the 
Trump administration had already clamped 
down on travel from Africa, including hikes 
in visa fees, and new obstacles and increased 
denials for Nigerians seeking approval for 
short-term visits. The US further suspended 
visitor visas from Eritrea in 2017. 
That means families have been fighting for 
years to use the dwindling avenues available 
to them to reunite, and for those who have 
invested significant time and money into the 
process, the sudden news of an outright ban 
was particularly brutal. 
‘‘There’s nothing you can do, and it makes 
you feel so helpless,’’ said Olumide, the vet-
eran. Olumide arrived in the US from Nigeria 
when he was 10 years old. He met his wife in 
Nigeria in 2012 after he left the military, and 
the two got married last year. 
US Citizenship and Immigration Services 
approved the petition for his wife and daugh-
ter in January, just before the announce-
ment of the ban. But they don’t yet have 
their visas—and the ban may make it impos-
sible to get them. 
Olumide had hoped they would be starting 
their lives together in the US by now, and 
said he was pained by feelings of guilt: ‘‘I 
made promises to her.’’ The couple hasn’t 
fully processed the news, he added: ‘‘We 
don’t want to think about not being to-
gether.’’ 
He noted that his daughter has typhoid and 
his wife has malaria, and he constantly fears 
for their health and safety. 
Hana Mohamed, a 20-year-old student in 
San Diego, who grew up in Sudan, said she 
was eager for her grandparents to come to 
the US, especially so her grandmother could 
get medical care in California: ‘‘It’s just so 
sad and frustrating. They are getting older, 
and I want to see them before anything hap-
pens.’’ 
Mohamed said it was difficult to accept 
that the US was banning large groups of 
Muslims in the name of safety while seeming 
to do little about the ongoing terror threat 
of American mass shootings: ‘‘It’s just so 
shocking that we have come to this day 
where a whole nation of people are getting 
discriminated against. Isn’t the purpose of 
the United States to stand up for everyone 
who is getting hurt and treat them right?’’ 
One Eritrean American who works as an 
engineer in Silicon Valley, and requested an-
onymity for fear of hurting his family’s case, 
has petitioned for his mother to come live 
with him in the US and was hoping she 
would soon get an interview date at the em-
bassy. Then the new ban was unveiled. 
‘‘We’ve waited our turn. We’ve followed the 
law. I’m a tax-paying citizen contributing to 
the economy,’’ he said, noting that his moth-
er is 69 years old and lives alone in Eritrea. 
‘‘This is just pure evil.’’ 
He said he felt Trump was implementing 
the ban as a ‘‘soundbite for the campaign’’ 
while disregarding that it would leave Eri-
treans like his mother with no options: 
‘‘This was our only hope to get her here.’’ 
For Eritreans, the ban comes as as the 
Trump administration has ramped up depor-
tations of Eritrean asylum seekers, despite 
the US government’s own acknowledgment 
of the torture and arbitrary detention Eri-
treans are currently facing. 
Abraham Zere, an Eritrean journalist who 
was granted asylum in the US and now lives 
in Ohio, said it seemed some Eritreans were 
reluctant to speak out about the ban and 
live in fear of potential repercussions from 
both governments: ‘‘People are scared to 
even discuss it.’’ 
Zere’s own family is affected: his mother is 
still in Eritrea, separated from her children. 
She can’t even video chat with her family be-
cause of the poor internet in Eritrea, which 
means she never gets to see her grand-
daughter, an eight-year-old she hasn’t yet 
met, he said. 
Some warn the ban may have life-or-death 
consequences. For queer and transgender mi-
grants in the targeted countries, it could 
lead them to embark on perilous journeys to 
escape to the US as they run out of options, 
said Zack Mohamed, who is Somali Amer-
ican and a member of the Black LGBTQIA+ 
Migrant Project: ‘‘This is a big ‘not welcome’ 
sign in front of our faces.’’ 
In response to questions about the impact 
on migrants fleeing violence, a US state de-
partment spokesperson said the ban was not 
meant to ‘‘limit the ability of an individual 
to seek asylum’’, adding: ‘‘Our first priority 
remains national security. We continue to 
work with our dedicated consular officers in 
the field to identify and expedite those indi-
viduals with urgent travel needs.’’ 
Asked about charges that the ban is dis-
criminatory, the spokesperson said the re-
strictions are based on ‘‘nationality’’ and 
‘‘visa category’’ and that ‘‘consular officers 
do not adjudicate based on religion’’. The 
spokesperson said there were specific cri-
teria to determine which countries are re-
stricted and noted that Chad was on the 
original list but removed in 2018. 
FIGHTING TO END THE BAN 
With the first travel ban upheld by the US 
supreme court, there are few recourses left 
to challenge the policy. Advocates are hop-
ing a Democratic president will immediately 
repeal the ban and have also recently re-
newed the push for Congress to pass the No 
Ban Act, which would end the ban and pre-
vent discriminatory immigration policies. 
Until then, Trump will continue to use his 
executive power to try to redefine what it 
means to be a citizen, advocates warned. 
‘‘The president of the United States, the 
US government is explicitly trying to decide 
who gets to be an American,’’ said Eric 
Naing, who is Burmese American and works 
with Muslim Advocates, a group that has 
challenged the ban. His family would not 
have been able to come to the US if the ban 
on Myanmar had been in place. ‘‘He’s saying 
I 
shouldn’t 
be 
American. 
My 
parents 
shouldn’t be American. It’s deeply upset-
ting.’’ 
Olumide noted that the ban was punishing 
countless American citizens like him: ‘‘It’s 
hurting the exact people you’re trying to 
protect.’’ 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, 
the President’s travel ban isn’t just 
bad policy, it is cruel. And it is tearing 
families apart. 
That includes veterans who have 
served our Nation, some of whom were 
in the middle of the process of bringing 
their families to America when this 
policy came down. Now they worry 
their loved ones may never be able to 
join them here in the United States, all 
because of a completely arbitrary Mus-
lim ban. 
One veteran said in this piece, ‘‘As a 
soldier, I understand the need to pro-
tect the country. But to completely 
shut the doors . . . it’s just plain 
wrong.’’ 
These veterans aren’t trying to en-
danger our country, Madam Speaker, 
they put their lives on the line to pro-
tect it. But this is the kind of real-life 
impact we are seeing. The President’s 
ban is not just offensive, it is actively 
separating loved ones, including those 
who have served this country on the 
battlefield. I mean, it is time to say: 
‘‘Enough.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1607 
March 11, 2020 
My friends like to talk about how 
they support our troops and our vet-
erans. Well, this policy is adversely im-
pacting so many of our veterans. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD a February 2, 2020, New York 
Times article, titled, ‘‘New U.S. Travel 
Ban Shuts Door on Africa’s Biggest 
Economy, Nigeria.’’ 
[From the New York Times, Feb. 2, 2020] 
NEW U.S. TRAVEL BAN SHUTS DOOR ON 
AFRICA’S BIGGEST ECONOMY, NIGERIA 
(By Ruth Maclean and Abdi Latif Dahir) 
The newlyweds had already been apart for 
half 
their 
yearlong 
marriage. 
Miriam 
Nwegbe was in Nigeria. Her husband was in 
Baltimore, and until she could join him, ev-
erything was on hold: finding a home to-
gether, trying for their first baby, becoming 
an American family. 
Then, on Friday, their lives were thrown 
into disarray by the expansion of President 
Trump’s ban on immigration to include six 
new countries, including four in Africa. Nige-
ria, the continent’s most populous nation, 
was one of them. 
‘‘America has killed me,’’ Ms. Nwegbe’s 
husband, Ikenna, an optometrist, texted her 
when he heard. ‘‘We are finished.’’ 
A year after the Trump administration an-
nounced that a major pillar of its new strat-
egy for Africa was to counter the growing in-
fluence of China and Russia by expanding 
economic ties to the continent, it slammed 
the door shut on Nigeria, the continent’s big-
gest economy. 
The travel restrictions also apply to three 
other African countries—Sudan, Tanzania, 
and Eritrea—as well as to Myanmar, which 
is accused of genocide against its Muslim 
population, and Kyrgyzstan, a former Soviet 
state. 
The ban will prevent thousands of people 
from being able to move to the United 
States. 
The initial ban, which was put into effect 
in 2017, restricted travel from some Muslim- 
majority countries as part of Mr. Trump’s 
plan to keep out ‘‘radical Islamic terrorists.’’ 
It has already affected more than 135 million 
people—many 
of 
them 
Christians—from 
seven countries. 
With the new expansion, the ban will affect 
nearly a quarter of the 1.2 billion people on 
the African continent, according to W. 
Gyude Moore, a visiting fellow at the Center 
for Global Development, a research group, 
potentially taking a heavy toll on African 
economies—and on America’s image in the 
region. 
‘‘Chinese, Turkish, Russian, and British 
firms, backed by their governments, are 
staking positions on a continent that will 
define the global economy’s future,’’ he said, 
adding, ‘‘One hopes that the United States 
would follow suit and fully engage with the 
continent—but that hope fades.’’ 
The rationale for the new restrictions var-
ies depending on country, but the White 
House announcement said that most of the 
six countries added to the list did not com-
ply with identity-verification and informa-
tion-sharing rules. 
And Nigeria, it said, posed a risk of har-
boring terrorists who may seek to enter the 
United States. The country has been hit bru-
tally by the Islamist group Boko Haram, 
though the extremists have shown little sign 
that they have the capability to export their 
fight overseas. 
Critics, many of whom also denounced the 
initial ban, saw something far more venal at 
play. 
‘‘Trump’s travel bans have never been 
rooted in national security—they’re about 
discriminating against people of color,’’ Sen-
ator Kamala Harris, the former Democratic 
presidential candidate, declared on Sunday. 
‘‘They are, without a doubt, rooted in anti- 
immigrant, white supremacist ideologies.’’ 
Two Democrats still in the race also 
weighed in. Elizabeth Warren described the 
measure as a ‘‘racist, xenophobic Muslim 
ban.’’ Former Vice President Joseph R. 
Biden Jr. called it ‘‘a disgrace.’’ 
And Nancy Pelosi, the house speaker, said 
Democratic lawmakers would push ahead 
with a measure to forbid religious discrimi-
nation in immigration policy. 
Beyond those people who may now never 
make it across American borders, the new 
ban could also affect millions who have no 
plans to travel to the United States them-
selves but may have benefited from the bil-
lions of dollars in remittances visa holders 
send home each year. 
The United States may also emerge a 
loser, studies suggest. Nigerians are among 
the most successful and highly educated im-
migrants to America. (Mr. Trump, demand-
ing to know why immigration policies did 
not favor people from countries like Norway, 
once disparaged those from Africa and Haiti, 
and said Nigerians would never go back to 
their ‘‘huts’’ if they were allowed in.) 
Hadiza Aliyu lives in Borno, the Nigerian 
state at the epicenter of the Boko Haram cri-
sis that has left tens of thousands dead. But 
she thought she had found a way out. 
Ms. Aliyu was preparing to apply to move 
to the United States, where she once studied 
and where her two brothers live. 
She was furious when she heard about the 
extended ban. 
‘‘Trump has been looking for a way to get 
at us Africans for a very long time, and fi-
nally got us,’’ Ms. Aliyu said. ‘‘To hell with 
Republicans and their supremacist ideas.’’ 
Mika Moses moved to Minnesota from Ni-
geria nine years ago to join his mother and 
siblings, who were allowed entry after the 
family was attacked in religious riots in 
their northern city of Kaduna in 1991. His 
wife, Juliet, and their daughter were plan-
ning to join him, but are stuck in Kaduna, 
where Ms. Moses sells soda in a small store. 
She said they were heartbroken by the 
news that the move would now be impos-
sible. 
‘‘I have been struggling to raise our daugh-
ter alone,’’ she said. ‘‘Why would Trump do 
this to us, after we have waited for nine 
years?’’ 
Nigerians already living in the United 
States have been calling lawyers to try to 
figure out whether they will have to leave. 
Marilyn Eshikena, a biomedical research 
ethicist, has lived in the United States for 
the past seven years, but her visa expires 
this year. Her employer sponsored her appli-
cation for a green card. 
‘‘If it turns out that everything needs to 
stop, they will feel cheated, because they 
spent a lot of money on this process,’’ Ms. 
Eshikena said. ‘‘I will also feel cheated, be-
cause all the time that I spent working here 
will ultimately be for nothing. I can’t even 
imagine what packing up and leaving will 
mean for me.’’ 
Her departure may also have serious con-
sequences for her brother, who is studying in 
Canada. Ms. Eshikena has been sending part 
of her earnings to help pay his rent. 
Some Nigerians praised Mr. Trump for his 
decision, arguing it might make it more dif-
ficult for those responsible for stealing gov-
ernment money back home to find cover in 
the United States, and force the country’s 
leaders to be more honest and work harder 
to develop Nigeria. 
In 2018, 7,922 immigrant visas were issued 
to Nigerians. Of these, 4,525 went to the im-
mediate relatives of American citizens, and 
another 2,820 to other family members. An 
estimated 345,000 people born in Nigeria were 
living in the United States in 2017, according 
to the census bureau. 
If the visas are coveted in Nigeria, they are 
just as prized in African countries like Eri-
trea, where government repression is ramp-
ant and those who try to leave face obstacles 
and danger. With more than 500,000 refugees 
living outside the country, Eritrea was the 
ninth-largest source of refugees in the world 
in 2018, according to the United Nations, but 
fewer than 900 Eritreans received immigrant 
visas to the United States that year. 
Abraham Zere, a journalist who moved to 
the United States from Eritrea in 2012, had 
dreamed of living in the same country as his 
mother since leaving home. On Saturday, he 
said his plans to bring her to the United 
States had been thrown into disarray. His 
family has been in constant communication 
on the messaging platform WhatsApp trying 
to understand what the ban will mean for 
them. 
‘‘This decision complicates everything and 
creates fear,’’ said Mr. Zere, 37, a doctoral 
candidate at the School of Media Arts and 
Studies at Ohio University. 
Mr. Zere and other Eritreans say they 
can’t go back. They fear they will be pun-
ished for criticizing the government or leav-
ing without approval. 
‘‘If I can’t be reunited with my mother,’’ 
Mr. Zere said, ‘‘it nullifies the whole notion 
of protection and punishes innocent citizens 
for reasons they had no slightest part in.’’ 
With nine siblings scattered across Europe, 
Africa, and the United States, Mr. Zere said 
their family has never had a full family por-
trait taken. 
The economic consequences of the ban 
could be far-reaching, experts said. 
‘‘Being cut off from the largest economy in 
the world systematically is problematic,’’ 
said Nonso Obikili, a Nigerian economist. 
The biggest impact, he said, could be on re-
mittances. 
Nigerians abroad send home billions of dol-
lars each year, $24 billion in 2018 alone, ac-
cording to the accounting firm PwC. With 
Nigeria’s economy highly dependent on oil 
and its unemployment rate at 23 percent, 
this money provides a lifeline for millions of 
its citizens. 
The new restrictions come at a time when 
the United States says it wants to jockey for 
power in Africa, particularly through its 
‘‘Prosper Africa’’ initiative announced last 
summer, which aims to double two-way 
trade and investment. 
‘‘If on the one hand you’re trying to make 
a push into Africa, and on the other hand 
you’re barring the largest African country 
by population from moving to your country, 
then it does send mixed signals,’’ Mr. Obikili 
said. 
In January 2017, Mr. Trump’s travel ban 
targeted several other African nations, in-
cluding Chad, Libya, and Somalia. Chad was 
later removed from that list, but the execu-
tive order halted the plans of thousands of 
Somali refugees living in camps in Kenya 
who were about to travel to the United 
States and start new lives. 
According to the United States Depart-
ment of Homeland Security, nearly 30,000 Ni-
gerians overstayed their nonimmigrant visas 
in 2018. The number of Nigerians visiting the 
United States dropped sharply after the 
Trump administration made it harder for 
visitors to obtain visas last summer. 
The new restrictions affect those who want 
to move to the United States, not visit it. 
The six countries newly added to the immi-
gration ban are not easily categorized to-
gether by religion. Nigeria, for example is 
thought to be home to more than 200 million 
people, roughly half of them Muslim and half 
Christian. Of the four African countries

newly singled out, only Sudan has a signifi-
cant majority of Muslims. 
The United States has left Sudan on a list 
of state sponsors of terrorism, even as the 
country works to reverse decades of authori-
tarian rule under President Omar Hassan al- 
Bashir, who was deposed in April. 
‘‘This ban contributes to the overall im-
pression that Sudan remains a very fragile 
state,’’ said Cameron Hudson, a senior fellow 
with the Atlantic Council, a research group. 
Many people from the countries newly tar-
geted by the ban said the uncertainty was 
the hardest thing to bear. Ms. Nwegbe, the 
newlywed, who works as the chief operating 
officer of a tourism company that tries to 
encourage people to visit Africa, said the ban 
came as she and her husband were building 
their future. 
‘‘We’re in limbo and our relationship is suf-
fering,’’ she said. ‘‘This is unnecessary hard-
ship.’’ 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, 
the President’s ban is not about na-
tional security, it is about targeting 
immigrants from predominantly Mus-
lim countries. 
In 2017, the President issued an exec-
utive order that banned foreign nation-
als from seven Muslim-majority coun-
tries from entering the United States. 
Then earlier this year, he went even 
further, expanding the travel ban to six 
more countries. 
This is affecting over 300 million peo-
ple on the African Continent and refu-
gees from Myanmar, where the Muslim 
minority is facing a genocide—geno-
cide, Madam Speaker. 
This administration is closing the 
door on the very people who are strug-
gling to survive. That is not the Amer-
ica that I know. That is not an Amer-
ican value. We need to act to defend 
our values. 
Madam Speaker, I just want to point 
out to my colleagues that what is in 
place right now, what this White House 
has done, I think by any objective or 
reasonable measure, is wrong. It re-
flects badly on who we are as a coun-
try. It is not just. It is not fair. It is so 
wrong. 
And we all—I don’t care what our po-
litical persuasion may be, I don’t care 
whether you support the President in 
his reelection bid or not—I mean, we 
have to do what is right for our coun-
try. This is doing great damage to who 
we are. It represents the kind of closed- 
mindedness, and the kind of bigotry 
that we should all be fighting against. 
Madam Speaker, I hope my friends 
will vote for the rule and vote for this 
legislation. I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. MCCARTHY). 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
And I apologize if I jumped ahead in 
any way, shape, or form. I appreciate 
the opportunity to speak. 
Madam Speaker, with all that is 
going on this week, Democrats have 
still found time for their favorite pas-
time, voting on partisan legislation 
that would actually make our country 
weaker. 
Democrats could not have picked a 
worse week to try to undermine Amer-
ican travel restrictions. 
President Trump’s quick decision to 
restrict travel to countries like Iran 
and China; now that was smart. It was 
a smart response, and it is helping to 
keep America safe. The President’s ac-
tions, then and now, are clearly within 
his rights. 
But today, I want to talk about the 
rights of this Congress, of this body, 
and how Democrats want to take those 
away. 
For the second time this Congress, 
the House is considering two important 
pieces of legislation by attaching them 
to completely unrelated shell vehicles, 
thereby preventing the minority from 
offering a motion to recommit. 
Now, the last time this occurred, 
Representative RO KHANNA actually ad-
mitted the maneuver was intentionally 
designed to silence dissenting opinions. 
He didn’t just admit it, he bragged 
about it, that they would be able to 
deny the voice of Congress. 
And now, with last week’s passage of 
the sixth motion to recommit this Con-
gress, Democrat leadership is once 
again choosing to restrict debate on an 
issue of national security. It is not 
only that this is bad for America, it is 
bad for the tradition of fairness and 
free debate that, you know what, 
Democrats promised to uphold. 
Don’t take my word for it. I listened 
to my friend, Chairman MCGOVERN of 
the Rules Committee say, in Sep-
tember 2018, and I quote, Madam 
Speaker, he boasted on this very floor: 
‘‘If Democrats are trusted with the ma-
jority, we will have a more accommo-
dating process. This place will be run 
like professionals. Ideas will be allowed 
to come forward, and the House of Rep-
resentatives 
will 
actually 
debate 
again.’’ 
If there is one thing we know about 
this Democrat majority, it is that they 
overpromise and under-deliver. Today 
is no exception. 
The right that Democrats want to 
take away is an important right, 
maybe one of the most important in all 
of Congress. It is the last chance for a 
minority party to offer amendments on 
legislation. It is called the motion to 
recommit. 
As you know, the motion to recom-
mit has been a hallmark of the House 
for more than 100 years. It was created 
to give the minority party the right 
‘‘to have a vote upon its position upon 
great public questions.’’ 
I have got to be very clear. Elimi-
nating this would be a nuclear option. 
That is why I sent a letter—actually 
two letters—to Democrat leadership to 
stop this madness. Unfortunately, my 
last letter to Leader HOYER on this 
subject went unanswered, so did my 
letter this week to Leader HOYER and 
Chairman MCGOVERN. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD both of the letters at this time. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC, January 27, 2020. 
Hon. STENY H. HOYER, 
Majority Leader of the House, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR MAJORITY LEADER HOYER: I am writ-
ing to request that you suspend consider-
ation of this week’s Iran-related legislation 
until basic and essential rights of the minor-
ity are observed. 
As we both can agree, the decision to go to 
war is the most significant choice Congress 
can make, followed only by impeachment. 
No matter what one thinks of the 2002 
AUMF, there are weighty consequences— 
both real and symbolic—when the House de-
bates overturning military authorization 
and possibly cutting funding for American 
troops serving in a volatile theater. I would 
hope that such an extraordinary step would 
be taken with a careful eye towards pro-
moting full and thorough deliberation. 
Unfortunately, the manner in which you 
intend to bring these measures to the floor is 
anything but full and thorough. Specifically, 
by attaching these items to an unrelated 
Gold Medal bill, you purposefully eliminated 
the last opportunity afforded to the minority 
party to amend legislation—the Motion to 
Recommit—a maneuver Representative Ro 
Khanna recently admitted was intentionally 
designed to silence dissenting opinions. 
Simply put, this is wrong—and I believe 
you know it to be in bad faith. In fact, we are 
unaware of the House ever debating matters 
of war and peace in such an unprecedented, 
irregular, and restrictive way. 
From its inception in 1909, the Motion to 
Recommit was created with the stated pur-
pose of giving the minority party the right 
‘‘to have a vote upon its position upon great 
public questions.’’ Certainly, the issue before 
us this week meets the standard of a great 
public question. 
More recently, you, yourself, stated: ‘‘More 
members, from across the ideological spec-
trum, need to have input into the work we 
do.’’ I would respectfully ask that we strive 
towards that standard and immediately rem-
edy this overreach so the minority may be 
allowed to offer input on the legislation be-
fore us, as has been tradition for over one 
hundred years in the House. 
It had been my hope that in this new year. 
we would begin to move on from the numer-
ous abuses or power we witnessed on the part 
of the House majority during the impeach-
ment proceedings. If, however, we can no 
longer count on fundamental safeguards to 
minority rights being guaranteed, I fear your 
decision this week will only serve to further 
erode trust, fairness, and comity in this in-
stitution moving forward. 
I look forward to your response on this 
critical matter. 
Sincerely, 
KEVIN MCCARTHY, 
House Republican Leader.

am writing to request that you suspend con-
sideration of this week’s Judiciary legisla-
tion until basic and essential rights of the 
minority are fairly observed. 
For now the second time this Congress, it 
appears the House will consider two pieces of 
legislation by attaching them to a com-
pletely unrelated shell vehicle, thereby pre-
cluding the minority from offering a motion 
to recommit.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1609 
March 11, 2020 
The last time this occurred, Representa-
tive Ro Khanna admitted the maneuver was 
intentionally designed to silence dissenting 
opinions. Coming on the heels of the 6th mo-
tion to recommit being adopted this Con-
gress, it serves to reason that Democrat 
Leadership is once again willfully choosing 
to restrict debate, rather than promote a full 
and thorough deliberation of these measures. 
My last letter to Leader Hoyer on this sub-
ject regrettably went unanswered. Given the 
gravity of this new precedent you are setting 
for our institution, I believe all members de-
serve a public response to the following ques-
tions: 
Will you commit to ending this practice, 
which has been pursued without any con-
sultation or sign-off from our side of the 
aisle? 
If not, are you contemplating using any 
Republican-sponsored vehicles in this ploy, 
which presumably would be done without 
their approval? 
What is the status of the request by fresh-
men Democrats to consider ending the use of 
the motion to recommit entirely? 
As you both know, the motion to recommit 
has been a hallmark of the House for over 
one hundred years. It was created with the 
stated purpose of giving the minority party 
the right ‘‘to have a vote upon its position 
upon great public questions.’’ 
In my view, eliminating the motion to re-
commit would be akin to the ‘‘nuclear op-
tion’’ in the House. I sincerely believe nei-
ther of you seeks to have that ignominious 
distinction on your resumes. However, your 
actions thus far in the 116th Congress sadly 
do not inspire confidence. 
Though we may not serve in the majority 
at present, our members still represent mil-
lions of Americans across the country who 
lend us their voice and count on us to fight 
for their priorities in Washington. In that 
spirit, I would respectfully ask that we not 
proceed on these measures until the minor-
ity is allowed to offer meaningful input on 
the matters before us through a motion to 
recommit, as has been tradition in the House 
since 1909. 
We look forward to your response on this 
critical matter. 
Sincerely, 
KEVIN MCCARTHY, 
House Republican Leader. 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I 
believe the Members of this House de-
serve a public response about this situ-
ation. Will Democrats commit to end-
ing this abusive practice, or do they 
plan to follow the lead of their fresh-
men and end the use of the motion to 
recommit entirely, to end a 100-year 
history of the body of this House? 
MTRs not only promote full and 
thorough deliberation, but they also 
improve legislation. Think for a mo-
ment, just within this Congress, 6 out 
of 60 MTRs have been adopted by this 
Congress. Think about that. 
That means a bipartisan majority of 
this House felt the need to improve 10 
percent of the bills put forward on 
which MTRs were offered. That should 
show you how vital the last amend-
ment is and always should be. 
Madam Speaker, though we may not 
serve in the majority right now, our 
Members still represent millions of 
Americans who lend us their voice and 
count on us to fight for their priorities 
in Washington. 
Madam Speaker, the last 8 years this 
House had a different majority. I hap-
pened to have the privilege of serving 
as majority leader. Not once did we 
ever consider taking away the MTR, 
because we believed in the minority’s 
rights and the traditions of the institu-
tion in which we are privileged to 
serve. 
We believed that the power of the 
idea should win. We believed in the 
promises that we made and that is why 
we kept them. We would not make 
promises while in the minority, and 
when we captured the majority, in less 
than a year, break them time and 
again. We would not go unanswered, a 
question from the minority as well. 
There is something bigger than poli-
tics. It is the voice of the American 
public—to use the sheer power of poli-
tics to silence millions of Americans is 
just wrong; to change a tradition that 
has been around more than 100 years; 
to make sure a bill cannot become bet-
ter simply because you want the par-
tisan side; or to be so afraid of the de-
bate to deny it to happen, we are so 
much better than that—the rights and 
the traditions of this institution in 
which we have always been privileged 
to serve. I wish I could say the same 
for this new Democrat majority. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I just want to re-
mind the distinguished minority leader 
that in the last Congress my Repub-
lican friends used this exact same proc-
ess 15 times, and it ended up denying us 
a motion to recommit. 
But I also want to say, I don’t need 
any lectures about how this House 
should be run from the distinguished 
gentleman from California. I remind 
my friends on both sides of the aisle 
that in the last Congress when the Re-
publicans were in charge, it was the 
most closed Congress in the history of 
the United States of America. 
No other Congress in our history had 
more closed rules where Members were 
denied the ability to offer anything on 
the House floor. And my friends some-
how take that as a great sign of—I 
don’t want to go back to those days. 
Madam Speaker, I will just say one 
other thing. The distinguished minor-
ity leader made the statement that 
somehow this bill that we are trying to 
bring forward somehow would make 
this country less safe. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD an article that appeared in the 
New York Times, titled ‘‘Trump’s 
Travel Ban, Aimed at Terrorists, has 
Blocked Doctors.’’ 
[From the New York Times, Feb. 6, 2017] 
TRUMP’S TRAVEL BAN, AIMED AT TERRORISTS, 
HAS BLOCKED DOCTORS 
(By Donald G. McNeil Jr.) 
The Trump administration has mounted a 
vigorous defense of its ban on travel from 
seven majority-Muslim nations, saying it is 
necessary to prevent terrorists from entering 
the United States. But the ban, now blocked 
by a federal judge, also ensnared travelers 
important to the well-being of many Ameri-
cans: doctors. 
Foreign-born physicians have become cru-
cial to the delivery of medical care in the 
United States. They work in small towns 
where there are no other doctors, in poor 
urban neighborhoods and in Veterans Affairs 
hospitals. 
Foreign-born physicians ‘‘are the doctors 
in small towns in Maine and Iowa,’’ said Dr. 
Patricia F. Walker, the associate director of 
the University of Minnesota’s Global Health 
Pathway, which helps refugee doctors prac-
tice in the United States. 
‘‘They go to the places where graduates of 
Harvard Medical School don’t want to go,’’ 
she said. 
Across the United States, more than 15,000 
doctors are from the seven Muslim-majority 
countries covered by the travel ban, accord-
ing to The Medicus Firm, a firm that re-
cruits doctors for hard-to-fill jobs. That in-
cludes almost 9,000 from Iran, almost 3,500 
from Syria and more than 1,500 from Iraq. 
Dr. Hooman Parsi, an oncologist so tal-
ented that he has an O–1 visa granted to indi-
viduals 
with 
‘‘extraordinary 
ability 
or 
achievement,’’ was to start seeing patients 
on Wednesday in San Bernardino, Calif. 
A federal judge in Seattle lifted the admin-
istration’s travel ban on Friday, and a fed-
eral appeals court has declined to restore it. 
Yet Dr. Parsi is still stuck in Iran, waiting 
for a delayed visa amid the confusion while 
his American employer fumes. 
‘‘We need him desperately,’’ said Dr. Richy 
Agajanian, the managing partner of the On-
cology Institute of Hope and Innovation, 
which had just hired him. ‘‘We had an office 
completely 
constructed—we 
spent 
three 
months on it, and it was supposed to open 
Feb. 1. Now we can’t open it. This is really 
sad and frustrating.’’ 
The 30-doctor practice does a lot of work in 
the Inland Empire, in San Bernardino and 
Riverside Counties, Dr. Agajanian noted. 
‘‘It’s very sparse in doctors out there—many 
miles between oncologists,’’ he said. ‘‘The 
patients he would be seeing have to travel 
another 25 miles now. Our doctors are al-
ready overworked, and now they’ll have to 
be on call more often.’’ 
The United States has a persistent doctor 
shortage, 
even 
though 
31 
new 
medical 
schools have opened since 2002 and many ex-
isting ones have increased class sizes, ac-
cording to Merritt Hawkins, a Dallas-based 
medical recruiting firm. 
It also noted that there are 22 percent 
more residencies available each year than 
there are American graduates to take them. 
Graduates of foreign medical schools now fill 
that gap; the largest number come from 
India, followed by Pakistan, China, the Phil-
ippines, Iran and Israel. 
(Iran is on Mr. Trump’s exclusion list; 
Pakistan, a Muslim-majority country with a 
history of internal and external terror at-
tacks, is not.) 
Many foreign graduates have J–1 visas, 
which give them about three years to com-
plete their residencies. ‘‘They must pass li-
censing exams and they must do a residency 
to practice here, even if they’re superstars 
where they come from,’’ said Phillip Miller, 
a Merritt Hawkins spokesman. 
Foreign-born graduates have often worked 
at world-class institutions and have pub-
lished academic papers, so they have higher 
average scores than American graduates on 
the medical knowledge portions of the li-
censing examinations, according to Merritt 
Hawkins research—though most initially 
score lower on the clinical skills portions, 
which include English and communication 
skills. 
‘‘I had to work my butt off to get here,’’ 
said Dr. Abdelghani el Rafei, a first-year 
resident at the University of Minnesota. 
‘‘They only take the top graduates from 
schools in countries like mine.’’

Such foreign-born graduates must return 
home when their visas expire, but they can 
get extensions if they agree to work in an 
area that the Department of Health and 
Human Services considers ‘‘medically under-
served,’’ which is roughly defined as having 
less than one primary care doctor for every 
3,000 people. 
Those who practice in an underserved area 
for several years can apply for green cards. 
‘‘After that, they can practice anywhere, but 
at least you’ve had three or four years of a 
physician in your town, and that’s pretty 
significant,’’ Mr. Miller said. 
Citing figures from the Iowa Board of Med-
icine, The Des Moines Register reported last 
week that 172 doctors practicing in Iowa 
were from the seven countries subject to Mr. 
Trump’s travel ban, and that 23 percent of 
the state’s 13,000 practicing doctors were 
born outside the United States. 
Andrea 
Clement, 
a 
spokeswoman 
for 
Medicus, said that 76 percent of the foreign 
doctors it placed last year had gone to areas 
with fewer than 25,000 people or to small to 
medium-size cities of 25,000 to 500,000. 
It placed more foreign doctors in Wisconsin 
than in any other state, she said, followed by 
California, Texas, Maryland, Oregon, Mis-
souri, Tennessee, Ohio and Arizona. 
Some urban areas are medically under-
served, too. While Manhattan’s Upper East 
Side has five times the number of doctors it 
needs to be adequately served under federal 
guidelines, parts of the Bronx and Brooklyn 
have acute doctor shortages. 
More than 150,000 residents of Brooklyn’s 
Bedford-Stuyvesant section, for example, are 
rated as medically underserved under federal 
guidelines. One of the doctors stranded over-
seas last week, according to Pro Publica, was 
Dr. Kamal Fadlalla, an internal medicine 
specialist from Sudan who is a second-year 
resident at Interfaith Medical Center, which 
serves 
Bedford-Stuyvesant 
and 
Crown 
Heights. 
Many foreign-born doctors, experts said, go 
into family medicine, pediatrics, internal 
medicine, general surgery and other front- 
line specialties where they see thousands of 
patients a year, including many on Medicare 
and Medicaid, rather than pursuing lucrative 
urban specialties like plastic surgery. 
As an oncologist, Dr. Parsi was an excep-
tion. He moved to the United States in 2007 
for postdoctoral work in molecular biology. 
Then, after passing his medical exam, he 
completed his residency at the University of 
Cincinnati and a fellowship in hematology 
and oncology at the University of Pittsburgh 
Medical Center. 
Because he had to leave the country to get 
his new visa stamped into his passport, he 
had flown to Dubai, in the United Arab 
Emirates. He cleared a security vetting 
there, he said, but had to wait a few days for 
the visa, so he flew to Tehran to see his fa-
ther. 
But the new court ruling affects only those 
who had current visa stamps in their pass-
port, so even though he is being issued a new 
visa, he still cannot return to the United 
States, he said on Saturday. 
‘‘Everyone, including me, would like to 
keep the bad people out,’’ said Dr. Naeem 
Moulki, a Syrian citizen who is finishing his 
medical residency in Minneapolis and plans 
to begin a cardiology fellowship in Chicago 
in the fall. ‘‘But this is not the best way to 
do it. If I have to leave, it affects my pa-
tients.’’ 
Dr. El Rafei said that the ban, which 
means he cannot go home to see his family, 
had depressed him. 
‘‘I felt like I was back in Syria again,’’ he 
said. ‘‘You feel hunted there, as if you did 
something wrong, even if you didn’t. Now I 
feel the same way here.’’ 
He sees patients one day a week at the 
V.A. Hospital in Minneapolis, where he is 
sometimes asked where he is from. 
‘‘One of my patients, he was a veteran in 
his 60s, said to me, ‘Why do you people hate 
us?’ ’’ he said. ‘‘I told him about Syria. I said: 
‘We don’t hate you. The bad people you see 
on TV are the same people who make us suf-
fer, too.’ ’’ 
‘‘I love this country,’’ he added. ‘‘There’s a 
time in our residency when we can work in 
Africa or someplace. I want to work in a 
small American town, to show people that 
we’re not all bad. The U.S. gives us a lot, so 
we want to give back what we can.’’ 
Correction: Feb. 6, 2017 
An 
earlier 
version 
of 
this 
article 
misattributed a quotation about the prepara-
tion necessary for a foreign doctor to get 
work in the United States. It was said by Dr. 
Abdelghani el Rafei, a first-year resident at 
the University of Minnesota, not Dr. Naeem 
Moulki, a Syrian citizen who is finishing his 
medical residency in Minneapolis. 
Correction: Feb. 25, 2017 
An article on Feb. 6 about the effect of the 
Trump administration’s ban on travel from 
seven majority-Muslim nations on foreign- 
born doctors in the United States described 
incorrectly the physicians seeing patients in 
rural settings. Forty-two percent of doctor 
visits in these areas are handled by family 
physicians, not by foreign-born physicians. 
(The figure for foreign-born physicians is not 
known.) 
Mr. MCGOVERN. It says: ‘‘Foreign- 
born physicians have become crucial to 
the delivery of medical care in the 
United States. They work in small 
towns where there are no other doc-
tors, in poor urban neighborhoods and 
in Veterans’ Affairs hospitals.’’ 
It also says: ‘‘Across the United 
States, more than 15,000 doctors are 
from the seven Muslim-majority coun-
tries covered by the travel ban, accord-
ing to The Medicus Firm, a firm that 
recruits doctors for hard-to-fill jobs. 
That includes almost 9,000 from Iran, 
almost 3,500 from Syria, and more than 
1,500 from Iraq.’’ 
I didn’t hear a single word about 
that. I didn’t hear a single word about 
how denying doctors the ability to 
come here is somehow in our national 
interest. Not a single word objecting to 
the hate-filled rhetoric coming out of 
this White House denigrating Muslims. 
We have a President who bragged 
about trying to put in place a Muslim 
ban. I mean, we have a lot of talk on 
this floor about the need for religious 
freedom and to speak out against dis-
crimination against individuals based 
on their religion, and yet, not a word 
about that. 
So, what we are doing by bringing 
these bills to the floor, we are standing 
up for American values, we are reject-
ing bigotry, we are rejecting hate, we 
are rejecting intolerance. 
Madam Speaker, I hope all my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle will 
support our effort. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. MCCARTHY). 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, 
my dear friend raised an issue that is 
very interesting, because he knows 
this. At any time that it was used it 
was in consultation with the minority. 
Even when it was taken away, you 
know what we did, we added back an 
amendment so you could have the de-
bate on the floor. It was only during 
appropriations consultation with you 
to be able to move something in a 
timely manner. He understands that. 
Madam Speaker, my only question to 
my friend on the other side is: Will the 
gentleman answer the letter? When the 
minority leader of the House sent the 
Rules Committee chairman a letter— 
the simple question is—with three sim-
ple questions: Will the gentleman take 
this opportunity to answer the letter? 
That is all I ask. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate the distinguished minority 
leader’s question. I would just say to 
him that the letter that he referred to, 
I read about it in the press. I didn’t re-
ceive it until last night. 
I will also say to him, again, this 
consultation that he talks about is 
something that none of us have any 
recollection of. 
In fact, I remember when the Repub-
licans hijacked the Democratic bill to 
basically deny us a motion to recom-
mit. We were never consulted about 
that. 
I would simply say to my friends on 
the other side of the aisle that this is 
about whether or not we are going to 
stand and tolerate a policy that I think 
by any measure is bigoted and, quite 
frankly, undermines our values. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
b 1315 
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
We have obviously had a heated de-
bate today, and it has been interesting. 
Of course, we disagree on a number of 
things. 
Madam Speaker, if we defeat the pre-
vious question, I will amend the rule to 
immediately bring to the floor Leader 
MCCARTHY’s 
bill, 
H.R. 
6177, 
which 
would require Members of Congress to 
disclose delinquent tax liabilities and 
wage garnishments. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to insert the text of my 
amendment in the RECORD, along with 
extraneous 
material, 
immediately 
prior to the vote on the previous ques-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Arizona? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I yield 
3 minutes to the gentleman from Illi-
nois (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS) to further ex-
plain the amendment and the leader’s 
bill. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gentle-
woman for yielding. 
As my friend said, if we defeat the 
previous question, we will offer H.R. 
6177. Leader MCCARTHY’s bill, H.R. 6177, 
is simple. It requires Members of Con-
gress to disclose unpaid tax liabilities

and garnishments in their annual fi-
nancial disclosure reports. 
As we approach tax season, where, 
under a penalty of fine or prison, we 
expect every American to file their 
taxes, those same hardworking Ameri-
cans deserve to know whether their 
Representatives are doing the same. 
And, like the American public, if a 
Member of this body fails to meet their 
tax obligations, my bill requires their 
pay be placed into escrow until their 
tax obligation is met. This is respon-
sible governing that informs the public 
and holds all of us accountable. 
The House should advance this legis-
lation today. 
This bill falls under the jurisdiction 
of the Committee on House Adminis-
tration, and, as ranking member, I am 
prepared to work with the Chief Ad-
ministrative Officer to execute this 
legislation. Also, as ranking member of 
the committee, I have seen legislation 
run through this committee that tried 
to use the tax dollars of hardworking 
Americans to fund their own congres-
sional campaigns. Every member of the 
majority in this room, in this Cham-
ber, cosponsored that bill when it was 
introduced. 
This 6-to-1 small dollar match of 
campaign dollars would have created a 
mandatory donation from the Amer-
ican taxpayer to each congressional 
candidate, meaning, for every $200 do-
nated to a campaign, the Federal Gov-
ernment—the 
taxpayers—would 
give 
$1,200 to that Member of Congress’ 
campaign. 
Imagine if every Member of Con-
gress—not counting all the candidates 
in each congressional race, just the 
current 435 Members—received just $1 
million in matched funds from the Fed-
eral Government, from the taxpayers. 
That is close to half a billion dollars 
going just to the campaigns, the polit-
ical coffers of Members of Congress. 
If it is the position of the majority 
party to force Americans to support 
politicians with their tax dollars and 
raise the taxes of hardworking fami-
lies, we should at least let those same 
Americans know which of us in this 
body are even paying their own taxes. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. In addition to the NO BAN bill, 
there is also a War Powers Resolution 
bill that will be made in order if this 
rule passes. 
I include in the RECORD a February 14 
New York Times article, titled: ‘‘White 
House 
Memo 
Justifying 
Suleimani 
Strike Cites No Imminent Threat.’’ 
[From The New York Times, Feb. 14, 2020] 
WHITE HOUSE MEMO JUSTIFYING SULEIMANI 
STRIKE CITES NO IMMINENT THREAT 
(By Catie Edmondson) 
WASHINGTON.—The White House told Con-
gress on Friday that President Trump au-
thorized the strike last month that killed 
Iran’s most important general to respond to 
attacks that had already taken place and 
deter future ones, contradicting the presi-
dent’s claim that he acted in response to an 
imminent threat. 
In a legally mandated, two-page unclassi-
fied memo to lawmakers, the White House 
asserted that the strike that killed Maj. Gen. 
Qassim Suleimani was ‘‘in response to an es-
calating series of attacks in preceding 
months’’ by Iran and Iran-backed militias. 
‘‘The purposes of this action were to pro-
tect United States personnel, to deter Iran 
from conducting or supporting further at-
tacks against United States forces and inter-
ests, to degrade Iran’s and Quds Force- 
backed militias’s ability to conduct attacks, 
and to end Iran’s strategic escalation of at-
tacks,’’ said the report, which was trans-
mitted on Friday to the House Foreign Af-
fairs Committee. 
The document confirmed what lawmakers 
had privately suspected as the Trump admin-
istration has offered a shifting set of jus-
tifications for the strike against General 
Suleimani in Baghdad—taken with no con-
gressional consultation—which brought the 
United States and Iran to the brink of war. 
‘‘This official report directly contradicts 
the president’s false assertion that he at-
tacked Iran to prevent an imminent attack 
against United States personnel and embas-
sies,’’ Representative Eliot L. Engel of New 
York, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs 
Committee, said in a statement. ‘‘The ad-
ministration’s explanation in this report 
makes no mention of any imminent threat 
and shows that the justification the presi-
dent offered to the American people was 
false, plain and simple.’’ 
In the days after the strike that killed 
General Suleimani, administration officials 
gave a variety of rationales for the action as 
they confronted questions about why the 
president undertook such a provocative 
move that could incite an escalation with a 
dangerous rival. Mr. Trump and other top of-
ficials, including Secretary of State Mike 
Pompeo, said the strike was conducted in re-
sponse to imminent threats to American 
lives, but they declined to provide any evi-
dence, leaving lawmakers in both parties 
irate. 
Pressed over several days, Mr. Pompeo 
conceded that the United States did not have 
specific intelligence on where or when an at-
tack would take place. Mr. Trump claimed 
that four American embassies had been tar-
geted for attacks, but under questioning dur-
ing a television interview, Mark T. Esper, 
the secretary of defense, said he had seen no 
evidence of that. 
Mr. Trump later insisted on Twitter that 
General Suleimani had, in fact, been plan-
ning an imminent attack on United States 
forces, but added, ‘‘it doesn’t really matter 
because of his horrible past!’’ 
Representative Michael McCaul of Texas, 
the top Republican on the Foreign Affairs 
Committee, said in a statement that ‘‘U.S. 
intelligence indicated Soleimani was plot-
ting more attacks on Americans and he was 
an authorized target in Iraq because of the 
ongoing threat he posed to Americans 
there.’’ 
‘‘The administration would have been ‘cul-
pably negligent’ if they hadn’t acted,’’ Mr. 
McCaul said, quoting Gen. Mark A. Milley, 
the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. ‘‘It 
is unfortunate that Democrats continue to 
criticize the president for a successful U.S. 
military strike of this brutal terrorist with 
American blood on his hands.’’ 
The report on Friday came a day after the 
Senate passed a resolution aimed at restrain-
ing Mr. Trump’s war-making powers with 
Iran. The rare bipartisan vote illustrated the 
depth of the skepticism in both parties about 
the president’s strategy, and lawmakers’ 
frustration with the administration’s refusal 
to consult Congress on military matters. The 
House is expected to pass the measure soon, 
sending it to the president’s desk. Mr. 
Trump’s advisers have said he will veto it. 
The White House infuriated lawmakers in 
early January when it sent Congress a for-
mal notification of the drone strikes re-
quired under the War Powers Act. Law-
makers had expected it to lay out a legal jus-
tification for the strike, but the entire docu-
ment was classified, and officials who read it 
said it contained no information on future 
threats or an imminent attack. 
Lawmakers were further angered by a se-
ries of briefings delivered by top administra-
tion officials that they described as insulting 
and demeaning, complaining that they were 
dismissed for questioning the administra-
tion’s strategy. 
Friday’s report also only discussed pre-
vious acts of aggression by Iran. It cited as 
a legal framework the president’s constitu-
tional powers as commander in chief and the 
authorization for the use of military force in 
Iraq that Congress passed in 2002, using two 
justifications the administration has pre-
viously mentioned. 
‘‘Iran’s past and recent activities, coupled 
with intelligence at the time of the air-
strike, indicated that Iran’s Quds force posed 
a threat to the United States in Iraq,’’ the 
report said. 
Congressional Democrats have coalesced 
behind a new push to repeal the 2002 law, 
which was passed to authorize a military re-
sponse to Saddam Hussein and his govern-
ment. They said Mr. Trump’s broad reading 
of it illustrated how the statute has been 
stretched and distorted to accommodate 
missions that Congress never envisioned 
when it was debated. 
‘‘To suggest that 18 years later this au-
thorization could justify killing an Iranian 
official stretches the law far beyond any-
thing Congress ever intended,’’ Mr. Engel 
said. 
The House last month voted to repeal the 
2002 law, with lawmakers in both parties ar-
guing that the authorization had become 
outdated and been abused by presidents as a 
blank check to circumvent Congress in tak-
ing military action. During negotiations on 
the annual defense policy bill, the White 
House, focused on creating the Space Force 
as the sixth branch of military and main-
taining the ability to divert military con-
struction funds to pay for the border wall, 
was initially open to repealing the 2002 law, 
but the Pentagon intervened. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, 
Congress has been clear, we did not au-
thorize the President’s, in my opinion, 
reckless actions, nor have we provided 
any authorization for the use of force 
against Iran. 
What we are hearing from the admin-
istration, on the other hand, has been 
about as clear as mud. Initially, Presi-
dent Trump and other administration 
officials claimed the January strike 
was in response to an imminent threat. 
Now we have confirmed through a le-
gally mandated report to Congress 
from the administration that that was 
not the case. 
This report made no mention of im-
minent threat, confirming the fact 
that President Trump was legally re-
quired to come to Congress for ap-
proval before carrying out the strike. 
The President may not like it, but 
the Constitution is clear: The Presi-
dent must seek specific authorization 
from Congress for any use of force 
against Iran, period. 
And I would just simply say that this 
shouldn’t be controversial 
because, 
whether you support the President ex-
tending military operations against

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1612 
March 11, 2020 
Iran or not, we should all agree that 
Congress has a constitutional responsi-
bility here. 
I want to commend my friends in the 
Senate for passing the Kaine resolu-
tion, and I thank the eight Republicans 
who stood up for the institution and for 
Congress’ constitutional authorities. I 
point that out, as well, and I hope that 
my colleagues will support the rule and 
support the Kaine resolution when it 
comes up for a vote. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
In closing, I urge my Democratic col-
leagues to bring to the floor border se-
curity measures that will help us help 
those who are truly in danger and in 
need of asylum. We can all agree these 
are issues that need to be fixed. Now 
let’s work together for all our constitu-
ents to get things fixed. 
Madam Speaker, I urge ‘‘no’’ on the 
previous question, ‘‘no’’ on the under-
lying measure, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, 
how much time do I have remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Massachusetts has 6 min-
utes remaining. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, my friends on the 
other side of the aisle want us to get 
lost on the process, but we can’t lose 
sight of the policy. This is about 
whether Congress should repeal Presi-
dent Trump’s Muslim ban, and we don’t 
agree—I would say, respectfully, to my 
colleague—on the Rules Committee. 
This is about whether we should pre-
vent this administration from putting 
in place more discriminatory travel 
bans in the future, whether individuals 
deserve access to legal advice during 
the screening process at ports of entry, 
and whether Congress should vote be-
fore any escalation in hostilities with 
Iran. 
That is what is before us in the rule 
today. These are incredibly important 
issues. They go to the heart of what 
America is supposed to be about. 
Now, some on the other side are 
upset that they can’t use certain par-
liamentary procedures to debate all 
kinds of divisive issues. Instead, they 
want to make this debate about any-
thing other than the President’s reck-
less foreign policy. I get that, but we 
are not going to get distracted here. 
This President is already looking at 
expanding his cruel travel ban. His ap-
proach abroad is totally unpredictable, 
and either you are going to stand up 
for America and stand up for our val-
ues, or you are going to stand by the 
President. That is the choice before us. 
For us, the choice is clear. I have 
constituents who have been adversely 
impacted, whose lives have been ripped 
apart by this President’s immigration 
policies. It is heartbreaking. It is not 
who we are. And, for whatever reason, 
the President continues down this road 
of dividing this country along racial 
lines, along religious lines, I mean, you 
name it—constant division. 
Enough. Enough. We are better than 
that. We are better than that. 
I hope that there is a strong bipar-
tisan vote in support of the No Muslim 
Ban Act. This is not who we are. We 
can’t let this be who we are. 
I strongly urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on the 
rule. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the 
President. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, when 
the Committee on Rules filed its report (H. 
Rept. 116–415) to accompany House Resolu-
tion 891, the Committee was unaware that the 
waiver of all points of order against consider-
ation of the H.R. 6172 included a waiver of 
Clause 9 of rule XXI, which requires a list of 
all earmarks, limited tax benefits, or limited 
tariff benefits contained in the measure, or a 
certification that the measure does not contain 
any of those items. However, per Chairman 
SCHIFF’s statement submitted for printing in 
the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD on March 11, 
2020, the provisions that warranted a referral 
to the Permanent Select Committee on Intel-
ligence in H.R. 6172 do not contain any con-
gressional earmarks, limited tax benefits, or 
limited tariff benefits as defined in Clause 9 of 
rule XXI. 
The text of the material previously 
referred to by Mrs. LESKO is as follows: 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 891 
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 12. Immediately upon adoption of this 
resolution, the House shall resolve into the 
Committee of the Whole House on the state 
of the Union for consideration of the bill 
(H.R. 6177) to require Members of Congress to 
disclose delinquent tax liabilities and wage 
garnishments, and for other purposes. The 
first reading of the bill shall be dispensed 
with. All points of order against consider-
ation of the bill are waived. General debate 
shall be confined to the bill and shall not ex-
ceed one hour equally divided and controlled 
by the chair and ranking minority member 
of the Committee on House Administration. 
After general debate the bill shall be consid-
ered for amendment under the five-minute 
rule. All points of order against provisions in 
the bill are waived. When the committee 
rises and reports the bill back to the House 
with a recommendation that the bill do pass, 
the previous question shall be considered as 
ordered on the bill and amendments thereto 
to final passage without intervening motion 
except one motion to recommit with or with-
out instructions. If the Committee of the 
Whole rises and reports that it has come to 
no resolution on the bill, then on the next 
legislative day the House shall, immediately 
after the third daily order of business under 
clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Com-
mittee of the Whole for further consideration 
of the bill. 
SEC. 13. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not 
apply to the consideration of H.R. 6177. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time, and 
I move the previous question on the 
resolution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on ordering the previous 
question. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The yeas and nays were ordered. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 9 of rule XX, this 15- 
minute vote on ordering the previous 
question will be followed by 5-minute 
votes on: 
Adoption of the resolution, if or-
dered; and 
The motion to suspend the rules and 
pass S. 760. 
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 226, nays 
186, not voting 17, as follows:

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1616 
March 11, 2020 
S.J. RES. 68 
Resolved by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. FINDINGS. 
Congress makes the following findings: 
(1) Congress has the sole power to declare 
war under article I, section 8, clause 11 of the 
United States Constitution. 
(2) The President has a constitutional re-
sponsibility to take actions to defend the 
United States, its territories, possessions, 
citizens, service members, and diplomats 
from attack. 
(3) Congress has not yet declared war upon, 
nor enacted a specific statutory authoriza-
tion for use of military force against, the Is-
lamic Republic of Iran. The 2001 Authoriza-
tion for Use of Military Force (Public Law 
107–40; 50 U.S.C. 1541 note) against the per-
petrators of the 9/11 attack and the Author-
ization for Use of Military Force Against 
Iraq Resolution of 2002 (Public Law 107–243; 
50 U.S.C. 1541 note) do not serve as a specific 
statutory authorization for the use of force 
against Iran. 
(4) The conflict between the United States 
and the Islamic Republic of Iran constitutes, 
within the meaning of section 4(a) of the War 
Powers Resolution (50 U.S.C. 1543(a)), either 
hostilities or a situation where imminent in-
volvement in hostilities is clearly indicated 
by the circumstances into which United 
States Armed Forces have been introduced. 
(5) Members of the United States Armed 
Forces and intelligence community, and all 
those involved in the planning of the Janu-
ary 2, 2020, strike on Qasem Soleimani, in-
cluding President Donald J. Trump, should 
be commended for their efforts in a success-
ful mission. 
(6) Section 5(c) of the War Powers Resolu-
tion (50 U.S.C. 1544(c)) states that ‘‘at any 
time that United States Armed Forces are 
engaged in hostilities outside the territory 
of the United States, its possessions and ter-
ritories without a declaration of war or spe-
cific statutory authorization, such forces 
shall be removed by the President if the Con-
gress so directs’’. 
(7) More than 100 members of the United 
States Armed Forces sustained traumatic 
brain injuries in the Iranian retaliatory at-
tack on the Ain al-Assad air base in Iraq de-
spite initial reports that no casualties were 
sustained in the attack. 
(8) Section 8(c) of the War Powers Resolu-
tion (50 U.S.C. 1547(c)) defines the introduc-
tion of the United States Armed Forces to 
include ‘‘the assignment of members of such 
armed forces to command, coordinate, par-
ticipate in the movement of, or accompany 
the regular or irregular forces of any foreign 
country or government when such military 
forces are engaged, or there exists an immi-
nent threat that such forces will become en-
gaged in, hostilities’’. 
(9) The United States Armed Forces have 
been introduced into hostilities, as defined 
by the War Powers Resolution, against Iran. 
(10) The question of whether United States 
forces should be engaged in hostilities 
against Iran should be answered following a 
full briefing to Congress and the American 
public of the issues at stake, a public debate 
in Congress, and a congressional vote as con-
templated by the Constitution. 
(11) Section 1013 of the Department of 
State Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1984 
and 1985 (50 U.S.C. 1546a) provides that any 
joint resolution or bill to require the re-
moval of United States Armed Forces en-
gaged in hostilities without a declaration of 
war or specific statutory authorization shall 
be considered in accordance with the expe-
dited procedures of section 601(b) of the 
International Security and Arms Export 
Control Act of 1976. 
SEC. 2. TERMINATION OF THE USE OF UNITED 
STATES FORCES FOR HOSTILITIES 
AGAINST THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF 
IRAN. 
(a) TERMINATION.—Pursuant to section 1013 
of the Department of State Authorization 
Act, Fiscal Years 1984 and 1985 (50 U.S.C. 
1546a), and in accordance with the provisions 
of section 601(b) of the International Secu-
rity Assistance and Arms Export Control Act 
of 1976, Congress hereby directs the Presi-
dent to terminate the use of United States 
Armed Forces for hostilities against the Is-
lamic Republic of Iran or any part of its gov-
ernment or military, unless explicitly au-
thorized by a declaration of war or specific 
authorization for use of military force 
against Iran. 
(b) RULE
OF
CONSTRUCTION.—Nothing in 
this section shall be construed to prevent the 
United States from defending itself from im-
minent attack. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
joint resolution shall be debatable for 1 
hour equally divided and controlled by 
the chair and ranking minority mem-
ber of the Committee on Foreign Af-
fairs. 
The gentleman from New York (Mr. 
ENGEL) and the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. MCCAUL) each will control 30 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and to include ex-
traneous material in the RECORD re-
lated to S.J. Res. 68, currently under 
consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of this measure, a resolution that 
will allow Congress to stand up for its 
constitutional responsibilities over war 
powers, a resolution that will send a 
clear message that the American peo-
ple don’t want war with Iran and that 
Congress has not authorized war with 
Iran. 
In the few months since the House 
last took up legislation to address the 
administration’s policy toward Iran, 
much has shifted. 
I think we are all relieved that ten-
sions have ratcheted down. After the 
strike that took out Qasem Soleimani, 
we appeared to be on the brink of a di-
rect conflict with Iran, but things have 
cooled off since. Some will say this res-
olution is no longer needed or has no 
legal effect because we are not shoot-
ing at Iran today. They say we are not 
in hostilities with Iran. 
But that is not an accurate reading 
of the law. The drafters of the War 
Powers Resolution accounted for the 
situation we are in today. They were 
clear that Congress’ powers are not as 
narrow as the administration would 
like us to believe and, apparently, as 
some Members of this body would like 
us to believe. 
The committee report from 1973 says, 
‘‘In addition to a situation in which 
fighting actually has begun, hostilities 
also encompasses a state of confronta-
tion in which no shots have been fired 
but where there is a clear and present 
danger of armed conflict.’’ That sounds 
a lot like what we are facing today, ex-
cept shots have been fired on both 
sides. 
Further, the President had to send 
6,000 additional troops to the Middle 
East after the Soleimani incident, pre-
cisely because there is a clear and 
present danger of armed conflict. 
Congress doesn’t have to wait until 
the President alone decides to use mili-
tary force again. Indeed, it is our re-
sponsibility to do something because 
we know that tensions could flare up 
again at a moment’s notice. 
b 1415 
Iran has not been deterred, as the ad-
ministration promised. Indeed, there 
have already been four attacks on 
American personnel after the President 
ordered Soleimani’s killing, injuring 
more than 100 U.S. servicemembers. 
This isn’t deterrence. The regime is 
again pushing ahead with research into 
a nuclear weapon and expanding its 
stockpile of enriched uranium. 
Now, I don’t like the Iranian Govern-
ment. I don’t like what they stand for. 
I don’t like what they do. But the re-
ality is this: Following the strike, we 
are now closer to a war with a country 
that is closer to possessing a nuclear 
weapon. 
The last few weeks have also shown 
the administration scrambling to come 
up with a legal justification for the 
strike. Contrary to the initial claims, 
it quickly became clear that there was 
no imminent threat. 
In fact, when the administration sent 
a legally required report to Congress, 
laying out the legal and policy jus-
tifications, there was no mention of an 
imminent threat—none whatsoever. 
What was in that report, however, 
was an alarming claim that under-
scores why it is so important to press 
ahead with this resolution. According 
to the administration, the strike on 
Soleimani was legally authorized by 
the 2002 Saddam Hussein war author-
ization. Let me say that again: the 2002 
Saddam Hussein, Iraq war authoriza-
tion. 
Madam Speaker, I was here in 2002 
when the House considered that resolu-
tion, and I can tell you: Congress did 
not intend for it to authorize a war 
against Iran. Read it. Nowhere will you 
find any mention of Iran. 
Incidentally, the House has voted to 
repeal this out-of-date war authoriza-
tion, thanks to Congresswoman LEE’s 
efforts, which I have supported. 
I have heard some arguments that 
the 2002 authorization wasn’t just 
about Saddam, but was also about ter-
rorism, because that legislation says 
Saddam Hussein might give al-Qaida 
weapons of mass destruction. That 
finding was debunked a long time ago, 
and it still has nothing to do with Iran.

Some also claim that because the 
forces in Iraq under the 2001 and 2002 
war authorizations have acted in self- 
defense against Iraqi militias backed 
by Iran, that somehow means that the 
2002 AUMF can be used to attack Iran 
directly. 
Anyone who is confused about this 
needs to read the administration’s 
legal rationale more closely. They have 
been all over the map, trying to untan-
gle this confusion, but their official 
justification is clear. It distinguishes 
the Soleimani killing from the defen-
sive actions taken against militias— 
apples and oranges. 
The administration, and any admin-
istration, should not be relying on the 
2002 AUMF for anything, but we should 
all be able to recognize that attacking 
Iran is very different from other uses of 
force in Iraq. 
It is an absurd reading of the author-
ization, and if the administration is 
going to lean on that outdated law for 
this, what else do they plan to use it 
for? 
Some executive branch officials, past 
and present, also argue that the Con-
stitution gives the President sweeping 
unilateral power to use military force 
without coming to Congress. I will say 
that again: without coming to Con-
gress. But even among this group, it is 
hard to find anyone who actually be-
lieves Congress authorized the strike 
against Soleimani. 
What has me worried is that the 
President made a decision to escalate 
tensions with Iran; failed to consult 
Congress, even though he had ample 
opportunity to do so; misled the Amer-
ican people about why the strike was 
necessary; and then switched gears and 
conjured up this dubious, after-the-fact 
legal justification. 
Here is the reality: The American 
people don’t want war with Iran. The 
Congress has not authorized war with 
Iran. That should be crystal clear. 
Congress has the right to declare 
war. It is in the Constitution. It 
doesn’t say that the President has the 
right, any President. It doesn’t say the 
President has the right; Congress has 
the right. 
We are trying to fulfill the Constitu-
tion. We are trying to take the Con-
stitution back to the way it was and 
the way it was interpreted. Congress 
has the power to declare war. 
Many of us are very concerned that 
since December 7, 1941, when President 
Franklin Roosevelt stood up and de-
clared war against Japan, we have not 
had a declared war since then. So, what 
has that done? It has really rendered 
Congress impotent. Congress, essen-
tially, has no say, and the President is 
the one who decides unilaterally. 
That cannot be. That should not be. 
It is going directly against the Con-
stitution, and we should not stand for 
it any longer. 
So, as I said, the American people 
don’t want war. Congress has not au-
thorized war. That should be crystal 
clear. 
However, since the administration is 
somehow claiming that Congress has 
already authorized force against Iran, 
then it becomes that much more im-
portant for Congress to go on record 
saying otherwise, and that is what this 
joint resolution would do. 
We passed a similar measure in Janu-
ary. At the time, my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle argued that the 
House version was unenforceable be-
cause it was a concurrent resolution, 
that it would never go to the Presi-
dent’s desk and wouldn’t have the 
power of law. 
I disagreed with that assessment. In 
my view, the House version was a clear 
exercise of Congress’ authority over 
war powers. We don’t have authority 
over war powers only if the President 
says so. We have authority over war 
powers because the Constitution says 
so. 
The House and Senate have both 
acted, and the Supreme Court has 
made clear that the President’s Article 
II war powers are at their lowest ebb 
when he acts against the express will of 
Congress. We have expressed our will. 
The President does not have authority 
for war with Iran. 
But the legislation we are consid-
ering today takes a step further. It is a 
joint resolution, not a concurrent reso-
lution, so it will go straight to the 
President’s desk if it passes the House 
unamended. 
It is important that Congress stands 
up for itself, but more important is 
that Congress stands up for its con-
stitutional authorities and makes it 
clear that we don’t want war and that 
we haven’t authorized war with Iran. 
Advancing this measure would be the 
right thing to do under any cir-
cumstances, but it is especially impor-
tant in the face of an administration 
that, again and again, tries to brush 
Congress aside as though we are an an-
noyance rather than a constitutionally 
coequal branch of government. 
Now, I will be honest and say that 
this has been done by subsequent ad-
ministrations on both sides of the 
aisle. Well, we don’t want it done by 
any administration. Congress has the 
power to declare war—not a President, 
Congress. 
We are not an annoyance; we are a 
constitutionally coequal branch of gov-
ernment. I am glad to support this 
measure. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I just have to say, here we go again. 
This is the third time in 2 months that 
the Democrat leadership has put this 
divisive and irresponsible debate on the 
House floor. 
I have to ask, Madam Speaker, what 
are we doing here today on this War 
Powers Resolution again? 
Our constituents are concerned about 
the impact of coronavirus on American 
lives and the United States economy, 
not partisan posturing. In fact, the 
WHO 
just 
declared 
that 
the 
coronavirus is now a pandemic. 
Madam Speaker, that is what we 
should be focused on here today. 
This political War Powers Resolution 
is based on a false premise. It orders 
the President to terminate hostilities 
against Iran. The problem is, for the 
other side, we are not engaged in hos-
tilities in Iran. 
I asked Secretary Pompeo that very 
question on February 28, 8 weeks after 
the Soleimani strike, before our Com-
mittee on Foreign Affairs: Are we en-
gaged in hostilities against Iran? His 
response was: ‘‘We are not.’’ 
Our military commander in the Mid-
dle East agrees. General McKenzie was 
asked yesterday at the Armed Services 
Committee if we are engaged in hos-
tilities against Iran or Iranian forces. 
He said, as Secretary Pompeo said: 
‘‘No, we are not.’’ 
I am a strong supporter of our Arti-
cle I powers, as I know the chairman is 
as well. If we were to launch strikes in 
Iran, I believe that the President would 
need to come before this body to ask 
for a new authorization. 
But that, Madam Speaker, is not 
what we are facing. This text com-
pletely ignores the remarkable re-
straint that the President has shown 
over the past few months. He has used 
force only when necessary to protect 
American lives. 
I was with the President at the White 
House when he was deciding how to re-
spond to Iran’s shooting down of our 
drone. He would have been justified, I 
believe, in taking out launch sites, but 
he decided to deescalate instead. He 
was very clear, saying: ‘‘I do not want 
to go to war with Iran.’’ 
The January 2 strike on Qasem 
Soleimani inside Iraq, not Iran, was 
not an escalation by the United States. 
It was an appropriate response to his 
deadly targeting of Americans and dip-
lomats in Iraq. 
Soleimani has the blood of hundreds 
of Americans on his hands. Most re-
cently, he organized an escalating se-
ries of attacks in Iraq, an escalating 
series of these attacks which killed an 
American, wounded multiple U.S. serv-
icemen, and involved the siege of our 
Embassy, an attack on our Embassy in 
Baghdad. 
The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff, General Milley, said the adminis-
tration would have been ‘‘culpably neg-
ligent’’ had they not acted to take him 
out. 
The strike on Soleimani in Iraq was 
totally justified as self-defense under 
the President’s Article II constitu-
tional powers. 
Jeh Johnson, President Obama’s gen-
eral counsel at the Department of De-
fense and Secretary of Homeland Secu-
rity, a person I have great, tremendous 
respect for and who I worked very 
closely with when I was chairman of 
the Homeland Security Committee, in 
his words, he stated that Soleimani 
‘‘was a lawful military objective, and

the President, under his constitutional 
authority as Commander in Chief, had 
ample domestic legal authority to take 
him out without an additional congres-
sional authorization.’’ 
This is the man in the Obama admin-
istration who approved the airstrikes 
against the terrorists. 
More importantly, the Soleimani 
strike was a success. Let me quote 
from a recent Washington Post article, 
where they said: The Revolutionary 
Guard ‘‘now finds itself on the back 
foot, a notable change after success-
fully projecting its power in the Middle 
East over recent years.’’ 
The Quds Force—Quds, meaning Je-
rusalem—that is their ultimate objec-
tive, to annihilate the State of Israel. 
‘‘The Quds Force has been significantly 
deterred 
from 
retaliating 
further 
against the United States.’’ 
But the Democrats cannot admit 
anything good can come from this 
President, and that has consequences. 
In my judgment, we are wasting pre-
cious legislative days and setting a ter-
rible precedent of abusing War Powers 
procedures. 
This will be the fifth time that this 
Congress, and in this Congress, that we 
are considering a War Powers Resolu-
tion directing the President to with-
draw U.S. forces from wars we are not 
actually fighting—three on Iran and 
two on Yemen. 
Iran and its proxies are watching 
right now, as we spin our wheels. What 
they see, Madam Speaker, unfortu-
nately, is not a united America, but a 
divided America that does not fully 
support the ability of our Commander 
in Chief to adequately respond to 
threats against Americans. 
Now is not the time to tie our Com-
mander in Chief’s hands. Now is the 
time to support our troops and to sup-
port our diplomats. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
b 1430 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
3 minutes to the gentleman from Vir-
ginia (Mr. CONNOLLY), a distinguished 
member of the Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my good friend, the chairman of 
the Foreign Affairs Committee, and I 
thank my friend, the ranking member 
of the Foreign Affairs Committee, for 
their good work. 
I understand we have a difference of 
opinion, and I do deeply respect my 
friend from Texas and his substantive 
and thoughtful contributions to our 
foreign policy debate in our com-
mittee, but I must disagree with the 
argument that we ought to be focused 
on only one thing right now. 
As grave as the coronavirus crisis 
is—and I would be happy to talk about 
that and the missteps of this adminis-
tration in making it worse—Congress 
is the people’s body. We are here de-
fending the legislative branch of gov-
ernment and its constitutional role on 
matters of war and peace. What could 
be more serious? 
The fact that we are here the third 
time doesn’t make it any less grave or 
serious. It underlines the importance of 
the issue and the fact that many of us 
in this body are going to continue to be 
here on the floor until Congress re-
asserts the role the chairman outlined 
for us that is the constitutional role. 
We have allowed way too much power 
to gravitate to the executive branch. 
We have abrogated our responsibilities 
here in Congress for decades. We like 
having it both ways. We tsk-tsk when 
the executive branch, we think, crosses 
the line, but we don’t want to take re-
sponsibility for it. 
This resolution asks Congress to do 
just that: stand up and take responsi-
bility, while holding the executive 
branch accountable. 
President Trump ordered a provoca-
tive and disproportionate drone strike 
that killed the Iranian Quds Forces 
commander, 
Major 
General 
Qasem 
Soleimani, a bad actor, but that begs 
the question: Should we have done it? 
And, oh, by the way, what level of 
consultation and intelligence ought to 
be shared with the legislative branch 
that has constitutional responsibility 
for matters of war and peace? 
We know the administration had to 
do some fast footwork to rationalize 
why now, why him, why there, and, oh, 
by the way, what are the consequences 
of doing that? In all of those questions, 
even with a formal briefing of Con-
gress, the administration simply did 
not have good answers. In fact, they 
had contradictory answers. 
Taking Soleimani out, my friend 
from Texas says, was a good thing. 
Well, it is not without consequences. 
We evacuated nonessential personnel 
from Iraq as a consequence of that 
move because of the terror threat. One 
hundred U.S. military personnel suf-
fered brain damage or head damage be-
cause of the retaliatory strikes on the 
U.S. base in Iraq. These things have 
consequences. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. ENGEL. I yield an additional 1 
minute to the gentleman from Vir-
ginia. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, 
reining in the administration is the 
right thing to do until and unless we 
get answers and debate and intel-
ligence provided to the legislative 
branch for justification as we move for-
ward. 
The idea that we are not at war with 
Iran so it is actually a redundant or 
unnecessary conversation, I think, is 
not an argument. In fact, now is pre-
cisely the time to constrain the execu-
tive branch, to set boundaries, to make 
sure they understand that Congress re-
asserting itself will set boundaries and 
legitimate 
barriers 
for 
proceeding 
down that road without first coming to 
the 
legislative 
branch 
as, 
indeed, 
Franklin Delano Roosevelt did in 1941, 
walking right down, with great dif-
ficulty, that aisle, asking Congress to 
declare war; and, indeed, Congress lis-
tened and responded. That is how it 
ought to work. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. ZELDIN), a member of 
the Foreign Affairs Committee, who 
served in the United States Army and 
fought in Operation Iraqi Freedom. 
Mr. ZELDIN. Madam Speaker, thank 
you to lead Republican MCCAUL for im-
portant words to start today’s debate. 
For the third time in 2 months, as he 
pointed out, we are here to debate an 
Iran War Powers Resolution. Once 
again, this resolution requires termi-
nating the use of force against Iran, 
even though U.S. Forces are not en-
gaged in hostilities against Iran. 
As we stand here today, the Presi-
dent has repeatedly said in the past 
that he does not want a war with Iran. 
I don’t. This body doesn’t. My constitu-
ents don’t. 
The President, himself, as lead Re-
publican MCCAUL has pointed out, has 
shown incredible restraint when oppor-
tunities have presented, when there 
was legal justification to strike back. 
We must continue to pursue peace 
through strength. The military option 
is the last possible option that we 
should ever use, but we need Iran to 
understand that it is on the table. 
My colleague from the other side of 
the aisle who just spoke used the term 
‘‘disproportionate’’ to describe taking 
out Qasem Soleimani. As people listen 
to today’s debate, and if you are one of 
the 600-plus families who lost your son 
or daughter, your husband or your 
wife, maybe your mother or father be-
cause of Qasem Soleimani, if you are 
one of the thousands of people who 
were 
injured 
because 
of 
Qasem 
Soleimani, 
U.S. 
troops—600 
U.S. 
troops, thousands of U.S. troops were 
injured because of Qasem Soleimani, 
and, literally, in the days leading up to 
this attack, we had U.S. citizens who 
were killed and wounded because of 
Qasem Soleimani. 
What is the justification? What was 
Qasem Soleimani doing in Iraq? How 
about we look at IRGC’s own state-
ment of January 3? The IRGC said that 
Soleimani was in Iraq to ‘‘plan a con-
frontation against the new scheme of 
the Americans to rebuild DAESH and 
the Takfiri groups in order to again 
disrupt Iraq’s security.’’ 
Anyone who wants to suggest that 
Soleimani was in Iraq to do anything 
that was good and not to be planning 
and engaged in hostilities has to ignore 
the IRGC’s own words. 
The IRGC is a designated foreign ter-
rorist organization. Qasem Soleimani 
is a designated terrorist himself, as 
sanctioned by the United States and 
the EU and the U.N., and we took him 
out. And I say good. 
To hear my colleague on the other 
side of the aisle call it dispropor-
tionate, my question is: How many 
more U.S. troops have to die at the 
hands of Qasem Soleimani before it is

proportionate? How many more have to 
lose arms and legs at the hands of 
Qasem Soleimani until my colleagues 
on the other side of the aisle will call 
it proportionate? 
I salute the President for making a 
decision; it was well done. 
I encourage all of my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘no’’ on this resolution. 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to gentlewoman from Min-
nesota (Ms. OMAR), a member of the 
Foreign Affairs Committee. 
Ms. OMAR. Madam Speaker, it is 
gratifying to see that Congress is be-
coming serious about restoring our au-
thority over matters of war and peace. 
Our oversight responsibilities don’t end 
when the news cycle changes. I hope 
that the outcome of this vote today 
will be another bipartisan rejection of 
war with Iran. 
But let’s be honest. We know that the 
eventual outcome will be a Presi-
dential veto. We have been through 
this already with the Yemen War Pow-
ers Resolution when we passed it last 
year. 
But despite the inevitable veto, it is 
critically important that we are here 
today voting to insist on our constitu-
tional power. Our Founders understood 
that these decisions are too important 
to rest in the hands of one person. 
The decision to assassinate General 
Soleimani was a reckless and badly 
considered decision that made Ameri-
cans less safe, and it opened the door to 
a series of escalating retaliations that 
makes the world less safe. 
But my vote today is not just about 
this particular strike or preventing a 
particular war. My colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle were eager to 
claim these authorities when there was 
a Democratic President in the Oval Of-
fice. Had I been in office then, I would 
have joined them in demanding con-
gressional authorization for wars in 
Libya and Syria. It should not depend 
on what political power is in the White 
House. 
We should be consistent in our prin-
ciples. In my view, this means main-
taining the momentum of this vote and 
our previous vote to repeal the 2002 
AUMF. It means finally taking up BAR-
BARA
LEE’s bill to repeal the 2001 
AUMF as well. 
Madam Speaker, I support this reso-
lution. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. WALTZ), a veteran of the 
war in Afghanistan and the first Green 
Beret elected to Congress. 
Mr. WALTZ. Madam Speaker, I find 
this interesting and sad. Since the last 
time 
we 
were 
here, 
for 
all 
the 
handwringing, all of the hues and cries 
that the President was taking us to the 
brink of war, that he was a warmonger, 
that this was so reckless as we are still 
hearing today, well, what has actually 
happened? 
The problem with my colleague’s ar-
gument is that it flies in the face of 
what is actually happened in the Mid-
dle East. 
What has happened is deterrence has 
been restored. It is relatively peaceful 
at this point. 
I say, ‘‘relatively.’’ The fact is that 
we don’t have thousands of boots on 
the ground in Teheran or in Iran. 
What we all know who have actually 
fought against the Quds Force and 
fought against the Iranians is they are 
deterred by strength and emboldened 
by weakness. 
So this bill seeks to restrain the 
President, who has shown incredible re-
straint. 
Did he respond to the attacks on 
international shipping? No. 
Did he respond to attacks on world 
energy supplies? No. 
Did he respond to the attack on an 
American drone? No. 
Only after another American was 
killed—yet 
another 
American 
was 
killed—and our Embassy was attacked 
did he finally respond. And what did he 
do? A limited, proportional, targeted 
strike in Iraq—not Iran—that had zero 
civilian casualties. 
And every American, from the lowest 
private to the Commander in Chief, has 
the right to self-defense. It was his 
duty. It was the President’s duty as 
Commander in Chief to stop the Ira-
nian escalation and to respond. 
And, by the way, what did he do? He 
took down the head of a terrorist orga-
nization who was declared, under the 
Obama administration, a terrorist, no 
different than Osama bin Laden, no dif-
ferent than al-Baghdadi. A terrorist is 
a terrorist. 
In this case, Soleimani was a massive 
and serial human rights abuser, respon-
sible for the deaths of tens of thou-
sands of people across the Middle East, 
and the world is a better place for the 
fact that he is no longer on this Earth. 
Madam Speaker, all this is doing is 
seeking to tie the President’s hands; 
and the last thing I want is any Com-
mander in Chief—and to my col-
league—for any party having to come 
back to this body to defend Americans, 
to defend our diplomats, and to exer-
cise his right to take terrorists off the 
face of this Earth. 
I cannot encourage my colleagues 
more strongly to oppose this resolu-
tion. This is politics at its worst. 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I now 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. LEE). 
Ms. 
LEE 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank the Chairman for 
yielding and also for his consistent 
leadership on issues of war and peace 
and making sure that Congress does its 
job. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of S.J. Res. 68, which is a resolu-
tion terminating the use of U.S. Armed 
Forces from hostilities against Iran. 
This critical resolution helps put a 
check on the administration’s reckless 
and irrational military action against 
Iran. 
The American people do not want, 
nor can we allow, another unnecessary 
war of choice in the Middle East. This 
resolution is an important step in our 
efforts to prevent that from happening. 
Make no mistake: The assassination 
of Mr. Soleimani just a few months ago 
placed us on the brink of war. This did 
constitute an act of hostility against 
Iran, and, in fact, injured at least 100 of 
our brave troops. Also, it hurt our na-
tional security and made us less safe. 
President Trump’s continued and 
reckless military action without con-
gressional approval or authorization 
caused this crisis. But we are here 
today to make clear that the President 
cannot launch a war with Iran without 
the explicit authorization of Congress. 
Madam Speaker, we have been down 
this dangerous path before in Iraq, and 
we cannot afford another ill-advised, 
destructive, and costly war in the Mid-
dle East. 
And, yes, I opposed the use of force 
without 
congressional 
authorization 
during the previous administration. 
This is not a partisan issue. Congress 
must do its job, and we must even go 
further to restore our constitutional 
duty over military action. 
I hope the Senate takes up my bill, 
H.R. 2456, to repeal the 2002 Iraq 
AUMF, which the House passed in Jan-
uary, which the administration, mind 
you, used as the basis for the assassina-
tion of Soleimani and its military hos-
tilities toward Iran. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
an additional 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from California. 
b 1445 
Ms. 
LEE 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, let me remind you that the 
2002 Iraq resolution was introduced to 
address weapons of mass destruction 
purportedly in Iraq. Now, this was a 
lie, it was put forth by the Bush admin-
istration. And many of us who were 
here tried to halt the use of force and 
to allow the inspectors to complete 
their inspections. Unfortunately—and I 
had an amendment to do this—it re-
ceived just 72 votes. 
Now, regardless of how one voted, the 
2002 authorization was specific to Iraq, 
not Iran, nor any other country. And so 
it is past time that Congress reassert 
our congressional authority on matters 
of war and peace. We must also return 
to diplomacy and peace and stop these 
endless wars. 
So I urge my colleagues to vote 
‘‘yes’’ on this. It is time that we do our 
job. Congress has been missing in ac-
tion. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Virginia (Mr. RIGGLEMAN), 
who served in the United States Air 
Force for over a decade and is a vet-
eran of Operation Allied Force and En-
during Freedom. 
Mr. RIGGLEMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
stand in strong opposition to H.R. Res. 
68, which is a divisive resolution that 
ties President Trump’s hands during a 
time when our Nation and regional al-
lies like Israel need our support.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1620 
March 11, 2020 
This resolution ignores efforts the 
President has made to avoid war, in-
stead continuing the Democratic Par-
ty’s fixation on the President’s strike 
on Qasem Soleimani in Iraq. 
My background does give me an ex-
pert perspective on the challenges in 
the Middle East, and an understanding 
of the current situation on the ground. 
Not only did I deploy directly after 9/ 
11, I was the counter-IED team chief in 
2006 and 2007 for the Counter-IED Oper-
ations Intelligence Integration Center. 
So our team saw firsthand what Ira-
nian Quds Forces could do to U.S. 
forces based on IED deployment and 
technology transfer. 
This was not some type of reckless 
assassination. This was a targeted 
elimination of a terrorist on our target 
list. President Trump’s escalated air 
strikes against those planning to in-
flict harm on Americans are warranted 
responses against Iranian actions. 
The United States reserves the right 
to defend itself, especially against bad 
actors like Soleimani and Iran. Instead 
of supporting a President who struck a 
terrorist, Democrats have retreated to 
partisan 
talking 
points 
and 
have 
flocked to this bill, which undermines 
the President’s actions and shows a 
lack of American resolve to our en-
emies abroad. This legislation harms 
our ability to protect American inter-
ests. It harms our military prepared-
ness. 
Lines 20–25 of the resolution state 
that the President must terminate the 
use of United States Armed Forces for 
hostilities against Iran ‘‘or any part of 
its government or military?’’ 
Does this include proxies in Iraq, Af-
ghanistan, Lebanon, Algeria, Yemen, 
Bahrain, and Shia militia groups? The 
IRGC is a foreign terrorist organiza-
tion, including its Quds Force. 
Soleimani was with a person called 
al-Muhandis, the center of command 
and control against American forces, 
Shia militia groups, and an Iranian 
proxy. Do we consider force protection 
conditions? The Commander in Chief 
needs flexibility in this new Arab war-
fare. 
And I do agree that it is time for 
Congress to update our authorizations 
for use of military force. I am eager to 
participate in this process during this 
time of asymmetric warfare and rapid 
response to terrorism. Let’s provide so-
lutions. Let’s not provide political hy-
perbole. 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Washington (Ms. JAYAPAL). 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of this War Pow-
ers Resolution to ensure that the 
President cannot start a war with Iran 
without Congress’ approval. 
I understand this is the fourth time 
that the House will vote to say ‘‘no’’ to 
war with Iran since President Trump 
ordered an unauthorized, illegal strike 
on Iranian General Soleimani. We 
passed our own war powers measure, 
led by Representative SLOTKIN. 
We passed a bill with bipartisan sup-
port to cut off funding for unauthor-
ized, 
offensive 
military 
operations 
against Iran. And we voted to repeal 
the 2002 Iraq war authorization that 
the Trump administration has inappro-
priately used to justify the strike on 
Soleimani and potential future strikes 
against Iranian targets. 
Madam Speaker, we have to be clear 
that this is not about whether General 
Soleimani was a good guy or a bad guy. 
Nobody is really disputing that. 
The question here is: What is Con-
gress’ authority to have a say on 
whether or not the United States is 
going to war? If we are going to send 
troops into war, then we have an obli-
gation to vote on that, to debate that, 
and to make sure that we preserve the 
congressional authority. 
And I think, Madam Speaker, that 
this is something that both Democrats 
and Republicans have consistently suc-
cumbed to. So we have consistently, 
Democrats and Republicans, given au-
thority to the Chief Executive that is 
not theirs to start with. Congress has 
spoken again and again on this. We 
should have learned by now. 
The American people have spoken. 
They don’t want us in endless wars 
without authorization from Congress, 
without a debate here in Congress, 
without utilizing those Constitutional 
powers that our Founding Framers 
gave us. It is time for us to do this, and 
to ensure that the President listens. 
So today, I am urging all of my col-
leagues to set aside partisanship, to 
think about this as something that we 
are reclaiming for ourselves as Con-
gress, to support this resolution that 
has already passed the Republican-held 
Senate with bipartisan support. 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I want to, again, 
state the main reason for us voting on 
this. I am no fan of the regime in Iran. 
And 
I 
certainly 
was 
no 
fan 
of 
Soleimani, who had blood on his hands 
and did all kinds of heinous things. I 
don’t care so much about them. 
What I care about is us. What I care 
about is the Constitution of the United 
States of America. It was drafted a cer-
tain way. It wasn’t drafted to say that 
the President, no matter who that 
President is, no matter what party 
that President is from, the President 
has authority to do whatever he likes. 
It clearly says—and I said this be-
fore, but I think it is worth repeating. 
It clearly says that Congress has the 
power to declare war. Congress. And 
what we are trying to do on this side of 
the aisle is trying to strike that bal-
ance, the checks and balances. We all 
learned them when we went to school, 
checks and balances. 
The Constitution doesn’t say the 
President can do anything he wants 
and the Congress must follow suit. It 
says that Congress has the sole right to 
declare war. 
It is really disturbing to me that sub-
sequent Presidents—and this isn’t only 
the fault of one President or one polit-
ical party. This is a road that we all 
share blame for this—we have allowed 
our branch of government to wither on 
the vine when it comes to declaring 
war, when it comes to war powers. 
We have essentially said that any 
President can just declare war, and 
Congress has got to go along with it. If 
you don’t go along with it, somehow 
you are unpatriotic or you don’t care 
about the country. Quite the opposite. 
Quite the opposite. 
We care about the country and we 
are patriotic, and that is why we be-
lieve that the Constitution needs to be 
adhered to. 
Now, I would also encourage my col-
leagues to look more closely at the 
facts, instead of just accepting what 
the executive branch is saying about 
reinterpreting the law. 
As I said in my opening statement, 
the drafters of the War Powers Resolu-
tion were clear, that the situation we 
are in today is in a state of hostility. 
We are constantly today in a state of 
hostility. 
The committee report passing the 
War Powers Resolution from 1973, in 
the Congress, says: ‘‘In addition to a 
situation in which fighting actually 
has begun, hostilities also encompasses 
a state of confrontation in which no 
shots have been fired, but where there 
is a clear and present danger of armed 
conflict.’’ 
Certainly, we are in that situation 
now. That is exactly the situation we 
are in right now. 
So Congress’ powers are not as nar-
row as the administration would like 
us to believe. I don’t care who is Presi-
dent, and I don’t care about who is 
elected in Congress. What I care about 
is that Congress fulfill its duties; fulfill 
its duties as the Constitution says that 
we must. 
So we are doing this again because 
the other body has not been coopera-
tive and doesn’t seem to want to make 
a move on anything. We are doing this 
because we have to do this. We are 
doing this because this is important. 
And no matter, again, 10 years from 
now, 20 years from now, there will be 
other Members here, I would hope that 
whoever is President then—no matter 
what party, whoever controls the ma-
jority of Congress—no matter what 
party, this is not political. This is not 
about party. This is not about trying 
to do anything, as far as I am con-
cerned, except reestablishing Congress’ 
right to declare war. 
I don’t know what is more important 
than war and peace. I certainly don’t 
think Congress ought to start giving 
away its responsibilities. 
I have been in this body a long time, 
and we have constantly argued against 
the administration—no matter who 
was 
in 
that 
administration—from 
usurping the roles that Congress has, 
from taking away congressional power, 
not only on matters of peace and war, 
but on everything; earmarks or any-
thing you want to say.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1621 
March 11, 2020 
Congress has just sort of said to the 
President: Go ahead, you make the de-
cision. We are just sort of along for the 
ride. We are kind of observers. We are 
observers. 
Well, we are not observers. We are 
people who care very dearly about the 
Constitution. 
And, again, I conclude by saying, 
Congress has the right to declare war. 
Only Congress has the right to declare 
war. That is what we are affirming 
today, and why I hope we get votes 
from both sides of the aisle. This is not 
a political discussion. It doesn’t matter 
who is in the White House. It doesn’t 
matter who is in Congress. What mat-
ters is that Congress not cede its re-
sponsibility to any other branch but its 
own. 
Madam Speaker, I am prepared to 
close, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time to 
close. 
Madam Speaker, there was reference 
that the taking out of Soleimani was 
an assassination. I just want to remind 
this body of Jeh Johnson’s words, 
President Obama’s general counsel at 
the Department of Defense, Secretary 
of Homeland Security, who I have tre-
mendous respect for. He signed off on 
airstrikes under the Obama adminis-
tration, stating that Soleimani was a 
lawful military objective, and the 
President, under his Constitutional au-
thority as Commander in Chief, had 
ample domestic legal authority to take 
him out without additional congres-
sional authorization. I think that real-
ly puts this matter to rest. 
But let me also say that the chair-
man and I are very bipartisan. We re-
spect this committee. We respect the 
integrity of this committee. We both 
see the world very much in the same 
way. I know the chairman is not a sup-
porter of Soleimani. I believe the 
chairman believes, as I do, that the 
world is safer without Mr. Soleimani in 
it. 
The chairman and I are very staunch-
ly pro-Israel, and are for Israel, and 
very much against the actions of the 
Ayatollah in Iran. So I don’t question 
the chairman whatsoever. 
In fact, I take great pride in the fact 
that the chairman and I work very well 
together. When we disagree—and some-
times we do—we agree to disagree, and 
we do so with civility, which I think 
has been lost at times in this body, in 
this town. And so I want to start with 
that. 
I will say that all the hearings I have 
had, and briefings prove that Soleimani 
was a terrorist who actively engaged in 
a campaign of violence against Ameri-
cans and our interests. And after not 
one, two, but three times debating this 
issue on the floor, I think we about 
said all we can say. 
I think we can all agree he was a bru-
tal terrorist and that the world is bet-
ter off without him. 
b 1500 
But I have to question, why now are 
we debating this? Our country is facing 
a public health emergency. 
Madam Speaker, as I stated, the 
World Health Organization just an-
nounced in the time of this debate that 
the coronavirus is now a pandemic. 
As of today, there are more than 
121,000 reported cases of coronavirus 
worldwide, including over 1,000 right 
here in the United States. And while 
the CDC maintains the likelihood of a 
person catching the disease is low, the 
fallout from the fear caused by COVID– 
19 is real and is causing real damage. 
Just 2 days ago, people were watch-
ing as their 401(k)s and retirement 
funds 
were 
disappearing 
and 
Wall 
Street saw the biggest drop in more 
than a decade. I know in my district, 
the city of Austin suffered a significant 
economic blow with the cancellation of 
South by Southwest, an event the 
chairman and I were actually sched-
uled to speak at regarding how we were 
the committee that works together and 
doesn’t give in to toxic partisan poli-
tics. 
Last year, this conference in my 
hometown brought more than $350 mil-
lion to Austin, making it the most 
profitable event for the city’s hospi-
tality industry. More communities are 
facing economic fallout, as well. And 
the fear is only rising as we continue 
to see more stories. 
Several Members of Congress them-
selves, our colleagues, are currently 
self-quarantining 
after 
potentially 
being exposed to the virus, yet we are 
talking about this resolution today. 
I would just close by saying, I was 
back in my district over the weekend 
talking to my constituents. They were 
really not concerned about the War 
Powers Resolution. Their number one 
concern right now is: My God, is my 
child going to get coronavirus? Am I 
going to get coronavirus? When is it 
going to impact my backyard, my 
neighbors? They want to be safe, and 
they want Congress to do something. 
I am hopeful, Madam Speaker—I 
know they are in negotiations right 
now between the leadership of our two 
parties that we can come together, just 
as we did last week, in passing a $7.8 
billion supplemental to address this 
crisis—that we can come together as 
Republicans and Democrats to do good 
things for the American people and to 
protect the American people and to 
make them safe. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, before 
I close, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Massachusetts 
(Mr. 
MOULTON). 
Mr. MOULTON. Madam Speaker, we 
are here today to fundamentally do our 
jobs. That is something that we ask of 
our troops every single day across the 
world on the front lines in places like 
Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, and through-
out Africa. 
There is bipartisan concern, bipar-
tisan recognition that Iran has ill will 
towards the United States, that Iran is 
an enemy of the United States, that 
Iran wants nothing more than to see 
our country and our democracy die. 
The most solemn responsibility that 
we have in ensuring that that doesn’t 
happen is upholding the fundamental 
principles of our country and of our de-
mocracy, of showing that we have the 
courage here in Congress to uphold 
that oath, that same oath that we ask 
our troops to uphold in far more dif-
ficult circumstances every single day. 
Iran is threatened by us because of 
the values that we represent and the 
power that those values carry in the 
world. It is when we abandon those val-
ues, when we undermine those prin-
ciples, when we forget that oath to our 
Constitution that our enemies start to 
win. 
I have fought Iranians on the ground 
in Iraq. I have seen Iranians kill Amer-
icans. I remember how much more ac-
curate the Iranian mortars were than 
the Iraqi ones we were used to facing. 
I get this, but I also never forget that 
oath that we took, and this resolution, 
passing this resolution is about uphold-
ing that oath to our Constitution. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to yield such time as he may 
consume to the gentleman from Ala-
bama (Mr. ROGERS), a member of the 
Armed Services Committee and the 
lead Republican of the Homeland Secu-
rity Committee. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam 
Speaker, I thank my friend from Texas 
for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, today, we are deal-
ing with legislation that didn’t make 
sense on January 9, it didn’t make 
sense on January 30, and it doesn’t 
make sense today. 
Today marks the third time the 
House has considered a version of this 
legislation in just 3 months. I am back 
to remind my colleagues that our con-
flict is not with the Iranian people, but 
with their tyrannical and murderous 
regime. 
The 
Iranian 
Government, 
using 
agents like General Soleimani and the 
IRGC, has been arming Shia militias, 
including Hezbollah and others across 
the Middle East for decades. General 
Soleimani’s organization was respon-
sible for the deaths of nearly 600 Amer-
icans. 
This resolution offers safe harbor to 
those killers. 
It offers safe harbor to the Iranian 
Revolutionary Guard Corps, a des-
ignated foreign terrorist organization. 
It offers safe harbor to terrorist 
groups receiving advanced weapons di-
rectly from the Iranian Government. 
These forces are critical to the Aya-
tollah’s clear goal of complete influ-
ence over the entire Middle East. 
But the American people know the 
regime’s legacy. They know the Aya-
tollah doesn’t care about the bloody 
cost of its terrorism. The legislation 
before the House today only paves the 
way for new Iranian aggression.

Chief does nothing to fix the problems 
in the Middle East. 
I 
believe 
this 
resolution 
makes 
America less safe. It makes a mockery 
of years of dedicated counterterrorism 
efforts. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ for 
the third time in 3 months on coddling 
Iranian terrorists. 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
I believe I have said about everything 
I can say on this issue, so I won’t take 
up more time of Congress, other than 
to say we are not at war with Iran. If 
we were, I would be the first one to say 
Congress has a responsibility to act. If 
Soleimani was taken out in Iran, I 
would be the first to say we need an 
Authorization 
for 
Use 
of 
Military 
Force. 
Congress does have the power to de-
clare war under the Constitution, and 
many colleagues on my side of the aisle 
agree with that concept, but it is just 
not factually what is happening on the 
ground today in Iran. If that day hap-
pens, we are fully prepared to have this 
discussion. This is what I would call a 
premature argument to make. 
And I would say, with respect to up-
dating the 2001 and 2002 AUMFs, I have 
had several meetings with Members on 
both sides of the aisle, many of whom 
were not here when those were passed 
by Congress in 2001 and 2002, who also 
agree that we should be working to 
modernize these Authorizations for Use 
of Military Force. 
I think there is that consensus, 
Madam Speaker, here today. I would 
encourage my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle—and I know Chairman 
ENGEL is also supportive of working to-
gether—to try to modernize these Au-
thorizations for Use of Military Force. 
But that is not the situation on the 
ground today, and I cannot support 
this resolution simply for the fact it is 
based on a false premise. It will tie the 
hands of our Commander in Chief to re-
spond in self-defense to Americans, our 
diplomats serving over there very 
bravely, and our American soldiers who 
are over there very bravely—it ties his 
hands 
to 
defend 
from 
an 
attack 
launched by Iran. 
And lastly, I say, Mr. Soleimani was 
not a good man. He was an evil master-
mind of terror. For two decades he 
killed Americans. He brought the Rus-
sians into Syria. They slaughtered tens 
of thousands of innocent people in 
Syria. He is responsible for so much 
blood on his hands. 
I would close by saying—and I do 
think there is consensus on this issue, 
as well—that the world is indeed a bet-
ter place without this mastermind of 
terror, the greatest mastermind since 
bin Laden was removed from the face 
of this Earth. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
I have said all along that this is not 
a partisan issue, and it isn’t. Executive 
branch officials from both parties have 
tried to sideline Congress when it 
comes to war. It is time we said: 
‘‘Enough.’’ It may be in the executive 
branch’s interest to keep Congress out, 
but that doesn’t make it legal or make 
it right. 
Madam Speaker, no one in this body 
mourns Qasem Soleimani, certainly 
not me. No one doubts that he was a 
hardened terrorist with the blood of 
Americans and others on his hands. 
But that is not the issue before us 
today. 
The issue is that the Trump adminis-
tration decided to kill him without au-
thorization from Congress, without any 
prior consultation with Congress, then 
misled the American people about why 
that was necessary. And then, when the 
administration’s explanation couldn’t 
withstand scrutiny, they tell us Con-
gress had already authorized military 
action against Iran. 
Madam Speaker, I think we would 
know if we had voted to authorize mili-
tary action against Iran. Those aren’t 
the kinds of votes you easily forget. 
So, today, we will vote on this reso-
lution and send it to the President’s 
desk. And it carries with it a very 
clear, very important message: Con-
gress has not authorized war, and Con-
gress has not authorized war against 
Iran. 
It is remarkable that we even need to 
say this, but as is often the case, up is 
down, down is up, laws don’t matter, 
and Congress doesn’t matter because 
the Constitution doesn’t matter. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
JAYAPAL). The time of the gentleman 
has expired. 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
for debate has expired. 
Pursuant to the rule, the previous 
question is ordered on the joint resolu-
tion. 
The question is on the third reading 
of the joint resolution. 
The joint resolution was ordered to 
be read a third time, and was read the 
third time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 1(c) of rule XIX, further 
consideration of S.J. Res. 68 is post-
poned.

ing amendments made by provisions of this 
Act other than this section, the amendments 
made by this section shall be treated as hav-
ing been enacted immediately before any 
such amendments by other provisions of this 
Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill, 
as amended, shall be debatable for 1 
hour, equally divided among and con-
trolled by the chair and ranking minor-
ity member of the Committee on the 
Judiciary and the chair and ranking 
minority member of the Permanent Se-
lect Committee on Intelligence. 
The gentleman from New York (Mr. 
NADLER), the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. 
JORDAN), the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. SCHIFF), and the gentleman 
from California (Mr. NUNES) each will 
control 15 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York (Mr. NADLER). 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
sert 
extraneous 
material 
into 
the 
RECORD. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, the Foreign Intel-
ligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, au-
thorizes the government to collect for-
eign intelligence in the United States 
under the supervision of a secret court. 
It is one of the most complicated, 
technical statutes we handle, but the 
story of FISA and how Congress reacts 
to its use is really very simple. 
Some measure of surveillance is nec-
essary to keep our country safe. Left 
unchecked, 
however, 
the 
executive 
branch is all too willing to unleash its 
considerable surveillance capabilities 
on the American people. 
Our job as Members of Congress is to 
make sure that our intelligence capa-
bilities are robust, but also to provide 
that critical check, to claw back au-
thorities that go too far, and to press 
for changes that protect our civil lib-
erties to the maximum extent possible. 
H.R. 6172, the USA FREEDOM Reau-
thorization Act, is one step in that on-
going project of protecting our civil 
liberties. 
It is by no means a perfect bill. There 
are many other changes to FISA that I 
would have liked to have seen here, but 
this bill includes very important re-
forms. 
First and foremost, it ends the NSA’s 
call detail records program, which

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1628 
March 11, 2020 
began as part of a secret and unlawful 
surveillance project almost 20 years 
ago. This experiment has run its 
course, and our responsibility is to 
bring it to its formal end. It should 
never have been permitted to start, but 
now at least we can finally end it. 
This bill also prohibits the use of sec-
tion 215 to acquire information that 
would otherwise require a warrant in 
the law enforcement context. Our un-
derstanding of the Fourth Amendment 
has come to recognize a privacy inter-
est in our physical location, and this 
legislation provides new protections 
accordingly. 
As the law continues to evolve, the 
public will see how the government ap-
plies these standards in the FISA 
court. This bill requires the govern-
ment to disclose all significant opin-
ions of the FISA court within 180 days. 
The bill also requires a one-time his-
torical review of all significant opin-
ions issued by the court since its incep-
tion. The Department of Justice may 
have good cause to classify the details 
of any particular case, but there is no 
reason that important interpretations 
of the law should be kept secret. There 
never was, and we finally managed to 
get rid of it. 
Now, since we circulated the original 
draft of this bill, we have heard from a 
wide range of stakeholders, from the 
most 
progressive 
Members 
of 
the 
Democratic Caucus to the staunchest 
supporters of President Trump, and 
they have convinced us to make yet ad-
ditional changes. 
To address the concerns of those who 
seek additional guarantees of privacy, 
we have added new retention limits, 
new reports to explain key legal issues, 
and an explicit prohibition on the use 
of section 215 to obtain GPS and cell 
site location information. 
Other Members asked us to address 
the deep structural flaws in FISA iden-
tified by the inspector general in the 
report issued late last year. We have 
done just that. Working with our Re-
publican colleagues, we have mandated 
additional transparency in FISA appli-
cations, created additional scrutiny for 
cases that involve elected officials, and 
elevated the consequences for mis-
representing information to the FISA 
court. 
I should also address the Members on 
both sides of the aisle who urged oppo-
sition to this bill because it does not 
contain every reform we might have 
wanted. 
Madam Speaker, I agree. It does not 
contain every reform that I want. I am 
no fan of the underlying authorities. 
I represent Lower Manhattan. I was 
in Congress when the World Trade Cen-
ter was hit. Then and now, I resented 
that the government exploited 9/11 to 
pass the PATRIOT Act, which was 
much too restrictive of civil liberties, 
and other measures that I find dan-
gerous and overbroad. 
For many years, I led the opposition 
to reauthorization of the business 
records provision of FISA, which we 
are finally doing something about 
today. 
I am a founding member of what was 
then called the PATRIOT Act Reform 
Caucus to reform the PATRIOT Act. I 
have voted against every FISA bill 
that did not contain significant reform. 
But the measure before us today does 
contain significant reform—again, not 
every change we would like to see, cer-
tainly not many of the changes I would 
like to see, but very decisive steps in 
the direction of protecting our civil 
rights and our civil liberties. 
We are taking that step as we 
should—together, in a bipartisan fash-
ion, and in complete agreement that 
when it comes to safeguarding our civil 
liberties, we have done what we could 
do, and we still have a great deal of 
work to do. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this measure, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I might con-
sume. 
I rise in support of the reform legisla-
tion. 
This bill is not perfect, as the chair-
man said. It does not contain every re-
form that I would like to see or the re-
forms that I advocated for and many 
others advocated for, but it is a start. 
Most importantly, this bill is an im-
provement over what currently exists, 
over the status quo. 
The legislation begins to address the 
problems that we saw with the FBI’s il-
legal surveillance of Trump campaign 
associate Carter Page. 
On December 9, 2019, the nonpartisan 
Justice Department inspector general 
released a 400-page report detailing the 
FBI’s misconduct and the failures in 
its warrantless surveillance of Mr. 
Page. 
Congressman MEADOWS and I urged 
our Democratic chairman to hold hear-
ings on this report, but they were not 
interested. 
Still, I hope all of my colleagues had 
a chance to read the inspector gen-
eral’s report because it should concern 
every single American. 
Remember, if our law enforcement 
agencies can do this to a President, 
imagine what they can do to you and 
me. 
The Justice Department inspector 
general found 17 significant errors or 
omissions in the FISA warrant applica-
tions for Mr. Page. Said more plainly, 
they lied to the court 17 times. 
They didn’t tell the court important 
information, like the guy who wrote 
the dossier was being paid for by the 
opposition 
party’s 
campaign. 
They 
didn’t tell the court the guy who wrote 
the document, the dossier, that they 
used to get the warrant was ‘‘des-
perate’’ to stop Trump and had commu-
nicated that to the Justice Depart-
ment. 
The inspector general also found 51 
factual assertions made to the FISA 
court that were wrong or unsupported. 
It detailed how the FBI was too eager 
to rely on phony political opposition 
research 
conducted 
by 
Christopher 
Steele and, as I said, funded by the 
Democrats. 
According to the inspector general: 
‘‘The FISA request form drew almost 
entirely from Steele’s reporting in de-
scribing the factual basis to establish 
probable cause to believe that Page 
was an agent of a foreign power,’’ 
which was not true. 
The inspector general determined 
that the FBI did not have corrobo-
rating information to support the spe-
cific allegations made against Mr. 
Page. In fact, Steele was feeding the 
FBI gossip and innuendo as proof of 
wrongdoing. Then, the FBI used that 
information, as I said, to spy on an 
American citizen, without corrobo-
rating the information. 
This is a great misuse of immense 
power that our Federal Government 
agencies have, and it is a severe abuse 
of trust. 
Now, there has been a lot of talk 
about accountability for this mis-
conduct, and I absolutely agree. There 
needs to be accountability at all levels. 
The inspector general found that an 
FBI attorney actually doctored a piece 
of evidence. An FBI attorney did this. 
He doctored a piece of evidence that he 
used to obtain the warrant to spy on 
Mr. Page. 
The attorney took an email that 
would have cut against the surveil-
lance order on Mr. Page and changed 
its meaning. He changed its meaning 
180 degrees so that it would support the 
surveillance. This is totally unaccept-
able. 
The same FBI lawyer who the inspec-
tor general found to have shared anti- 
Trump text messages with his col-
leagues, writing all kinds of things— 
‘‘the crazies won finally,’’ ‘‘viva la re-
sistance’’—this attorney went on to 
serve 
on 
Special 
Counsel 
Robert 
Mueller’s team investigating the de-
bunked allegations about Russian col-
lusion. 
The FBI’s misconduct on FISA is not 
limited to junior staffers, as some of 
my colleagues have asserted. Such 
rampant and flagrant abuse can occur 
only because of senior leadership fail-
ures: Director Comey, Deputy Director 
McCabe, and General Counsel Jim 
Baker. 
In fact, the inspector general said as 
much in his report. Here are his words: 
‘‘In our view, this was a failure of not 
only the operational team, but also of 
the managers and supervisors, includ-
ing senior officials, in the chain of 
command.’’ 
It is no coincidence that the two 
most senior FBI officials involved, Di-
rector Comey and Deputy Director 
McCabe, were both referred for crimi-
nal prosecution by the inspector gen-
eral for wrongdoing related to the in-
vestigations. 
We cannot forget this background be-
cause that is why this reform legisla-
tion—again, while not everything we 
hoped for—is a necessary first step.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1629 
March 11, 2020 
This bill would add several require-
ments to ensure a FISA application is 
complete and accurate. It requires the 
Attorney General to sign off on a FISA 
investigation of an elected official or 
candidate for Federal office. It forces 
the Justice Department to fire anyone 
who knowingly hides information from 
the FISA court. And the bill enhances 
congressional oversight of the FISA 
process. 
It also allows the FISA court to ap-
point an amicus in cases involving po-
litical activities of a U.S. person. Be-
cause the FISA process is ex parte— 
meaning, of course, the U.S. person is 
not represented—I hope the appoint-
ment of the amicus will help the FISA 
court to protect the civil liberties of 
U.S. persons. 
Like I said, I think we can and 
should do more, and I look forward to 
working with the chairman toward 
that end. But right now, this bill would 
improve the civil liberty protections of 
U.S. citizens. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I in-
clude in the RECORD this letter from 
the chairwoman of the Committee on 
Oversight and Reform. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT AND REFORM, 
Washington, DC, March 10, 2020. 
Hon. JERROLD NADLER, 
Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: I am writing to you 
concerning H.R. 6172, the ‘‘USA Freedom Re-
authorization Act.’’ There are certain provi-
sions in the legislation which fall within the 
Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on 
Oversight and Reform. 
In the interest of permitting your Com-
mittee to proceed expeditiously on this bill, 
I am willing to waive this Committee’s right 
to sequential referral. I do so with the under-
standing that by waiving consideration of 
the bill, the Committee on Oversight and Re-
form does not waive any future jurisdic-
tional claim over the subject matters con-
tained in the bill which fall within its Rule 
X jurisdiction. I request that you urge the 
Speaker to name Members of this Committee 
to any conference committee which is named 
to consider such provisions. 
Please place this letter into the Congres-
sional Record during consideration of the 
measure on the House floor. Thank you for 
the cooperative spirit in which you have 
worked regarding this matter and others be-
tween our respective Committees. 
Sincerely, 
CAROLYN B. MALONEY, 
Chairwoman. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
as a senior member of the Judiciary 
Committee, I am delighted to be able 
to join our Republican colleagues and 
Democratic colleagues and those of us 
who have advocated for a progressive 
mindset as it relates to civil liberties 
in this country in support of the reau-
thorization of the USA FREEDOM Act. 
With that backdrop, however, I want 
to say to my good friend, he knows 
that the inspector general’s report in-
dicated that there was no political mo-
tive to the beginning of the investiga-
tion. And even though referrals have 
been made, none of the individuals he 
mentioned have been criminally pros-
ecuted. 
That is behind us, to a certain ex-
tent, but it is a good backdrop to make 
sure that anything we do, no matter 
who the individuals are, that we do it 
with the impeccable credentials of the 
Constitution, civil liberties, civil jus-
tice, and equality. 
That is why I rise to support this leg-
islation, although I know that a more 
detailed review might have warranted 
some additional fixes. 
But I think it is important to take 
note that we do have the prohibition of 
the government from using section 215 
to collect any records that would re-
quire a warrant if the information 
being assessed was for law enforcement 
purposes. 
We are trying to contain and con-
strain. The bill requires the govern-
ment to provide notice to individuals 
whose information is collected pursu-
ant to 215, and it strengthens First 
Amendment protections by requiring 
the FISA court and the Foreign Intel-
ligence Surveillance Court of Review 
to appoint an amicus curiae in any in-
stance where an application by the 
government presents significant con-
cerns about impinging on the First 
Amendment. 
The bill also strengthens the amicus 
curiae’s ability to protect privacy in 
civil liberties cases. As well, it directs 
the Privacy and Civil Liberties Over-
sight Board to conduct a study of the 
way the government’s use of FISA au-
thorities may be premised. 
The bill improves transparency. The 
bill 
strengthens 
reporting 
require-
ments. It strengthens, as I said, the 
Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight 
Board. 
In further debates right after 9/11, I 
worked on a number of legislative ini-
tiatives, including one bill in 2013, the 
FISA Court and Sunshine Act, bipar-
tisan legislation that provided much- 
needed transparency without compro-
mising national security to the deci-
sions, orders, and opinions of the For-
eign Intelligence Surveillance Court. 
That language is in this bill, the op-
portunity to review those decisions and 
for those decisions to be able to be re-
viewed as well. 
I am a longstanding supporter of the 
USA FREEDOM Act, particularly be-
cause section 301 of that bill, which is 
not in this bill, has protections against 
reversed targeting. 
b 1530 
Each moment that we have an oppor-
tunity to provide security for this Na-
tion we also have the equal oppor-
tunity of infringing on the civil lib-
erties of our fellow citizens. It is im-
portant today to stand on this floor 
and say to the American people that 
we do believe in their constitutional 
rights and the Bill of Rights. This leg-
islation is to further contain those in-
fringements and to protect the rights 
of our citizens. 
Madam Speaker, I want my col-
leagues to support this legislation. 
Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the 
Judiciary Committee and as an original co- 
sponsor of the USA Freedom Act, which 
stands for ‘‘Uniting and Strengthening America 
by Fulfilling Rights and Ending Eavesdropping, 
Dragnet-collection, 
and 
Online 
Monitoring 
Act’’, I rise in support of the ‘‘USA Freedom 
Reauthorization Act of 2020.’’ 
I support the USA Freedom Reauthorization 
Act of 2020 for several reasons: 
1. The bill continues to prohibit the NSA 
from collecting bulk phone records. By doing 
so, the government no longer has the author-
ity to collect large amounts of call detail 
records on an ongoing basis. The Call Detail 
Records program not only resulted in the over- 
collection of records that the NSA did not have 
authority to receive but also resulted in several 
technical problems. 
2. The USA Freedom Reauthorization Act 
prohibits the government from using Section 
215 to collect any records that would require 
a warrant if the information being accessed 
were for law enforcement purposes. This pro-
vision ensures that Section 215 can keep 
pace with future developments in the law as 
courts interpret Carpenter v. United States and 
apply it to other contexts. 
3. The bill requires the government to pro-
vide notice to individuals whose information is 
collected pursuant to Section 215 if the gov-
ernment plans to use that information, or any 
information derived from it, in a criminal case 
or other legal proceeding. 
4. The USA Freedom Reauthorization Act 
strengthens First Amendment Protections by 
requiring the FISC and the Foreign Intel-
ligence Surveillance Court of Review to ap-
point an amicus curia in any instance where 
an application by the government presents 
significant concerns about impinging on the 
First Amendment activities of Americans. 
5. The bill contains other measures to 
strengthen amici curiae’s ability to protect pri-
vacy in civil liberties in cases to which they 
are appointed. 
6. The USA Freedom Reauthorization Act 
directs the Privacy and Civil Liberties Over-
sight Board to conduct a study of the way the 
government’s use of FISA authorities may be 
premised on or may impact protected classes, 
including based on race, ethnicity, national ori-
gin, religion, or sex. 
7. The bill improves transparency by requir-
ing the declassification of significant FISC and 
FISC–R opinions within 180 days. 
8. The USA Freedom Reauthorization Act 
strengthens the reporting requirement for Sec-
tion 702 queries by eliminating an existing ex-
emption for the FBI. 
9. The bill strengthens the Privacy and Civil 
Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB) by allow-
ing members to be reappointed to consecutive 
terms and to continue serving after their terms 
have expired, should they so choose. 
The USA Freedom Act was first passed in 
2015 as the House’s unified response to the 
unauthorized disclosures and subsequent pub-
lication in the media in June 2013, regarding 
the National Security Agency’s collection from 
Verizon of the phone records of all of its 
American customers, which was authorized by 
the FISA Court pursuant to Section 215 of the 
Patriot Act.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1630 
March 11, 2020 
Public reaction to the news of this massive 
and secret data gathering operation was swift 
and negative. 
There was justifiable concern on the part of 
the public and a large percentage of the Mem-
bers of this body that the extent and scale of 
this NSA data collection operation, which ex-
ceeded by orders of magnitude anything pre-
viously authorized or contemplated, may con-
stitute an unwarranted invasion of privacy and 
threat to the civil liberties of American citizens. 
To quell the growing controversy, the Direc-
tor of National Intelligence declassified and re-
leased limited information about this program. 
According to the DNI, the information acquired 
under this program did not include the content 
of any communications or the identity of any 
subscriber. 
The DNI stated that ‘‘the only type of infor-
mation acquired under the Court’s order is te-
lephony meta data, such as telephone num-
bers dialed and length of calls.’’ 
The assurance given by the DNI, to put it 
mildly, was not very reassuring. 
In response, many Members of Congress, 
including then Ranking Member Conyers, Mr. 
SENSENBRENNER, and myself, introduced legis-
lation in response to the disclosures to ensure 
that the law and the practices of the executive 
branch reflect the intent of Congress in pass-
ing the USA Patriot Act and subsequent 
amendments. 
For example, I introduced H.R. 2440, the 
‘‘FISA Court in the Sunshine Act of 2013,’’ bi-
partisan legislation, that provided much need-
ed transparency without compromising na-
tional security to the decisions, orders, and 
opinions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveil-
lance Court or ‘‘FISA Court.’’ 
Specifically, my bill required the Attorney 
General to disclose each decision, order, or 
opinion of a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance 
Court (FISC), allowing Americans to know how 
broad of a legal authority the government is 
claiming under the PATRIOT ACT and Foreign 
Intelligence Surveillance Act to conduct the 
surveillance needed to keep Americans safe. 
These requirements were then incorporated 
in substantial fl part in the USA Freedom Act, 
which required the Attorney General to con-
duct a declassification review of each deci-
sion, order, or opinion of the FISA court that 
included a significant construction or interpre-
tation of law and to submit a report to Con-
gress within 45 days. 
As I indicated, perhaps the most important 
reasons for supporting passage of the USA 
Freedom Reauthorization Act is the prohibition 
on domestic bulk collection, as well as its en-
hanced First Amendment protections, both of 
which seek to protect American citizens from 
the NSA’ s abuse of power through unlawful 
collection of personal data. 
I was also a longstanding supporter of the 
USA Freedom Act, particularly because Sec-
tion 301 of the bill contained protections 
against ‘‘reverse targeting,’’ which became law 
when an earlier Jackson Lee Amendment was 
included in H.R. 3773, the RESTORE Act of 
2007. 
‘‘Reverse targeting,’’ a concept well known 
to members of this Committee but not so well 
understood by those less steeped in the 
arcana of electronic surveillance, is the prac-
tice where the government targets foreigners 
without a warrant while its actual purpose is to 
collect information on certain U.S. persons. 
One of the main concerns of libertarians 
and classical conservatives, as well as pro-
gressives and civil liberties organizations, in 
giving expanded authority to the executive 
branch was the temptation for national security 
agencies to engage in reverse targeting may 
be difficult to resist in the absence of strong 
safeguards to prevent it. 
The Jackson Lee Amendment, preserved in 
Section 301 of the USA Freedom Act, reduced 
even further any such temptation to resort to 
reverse targeting by making any information 
concerning a United States person obtained 
improperly inadmissible in any federal, state, 
or local judicial, legal, executive, or administra-
tive proceeding. 
Madam Speaker, I noted in an op-ed pub-
lished way back in October 2007, that as Alex-
is DeTocqueville, the most astute student of 
American democracy, observed nearly two 
centuries ago, the reason democracies invari-
ably prevail in any military conflict is because 
democracy is the governmental form that best 
rewards and encourages those traits that are 
indispensable to success: initiative, innovation, 
courage, and a love of justice. 
I support the USA Freedom Reauthorization 
Act of 2020 because it will help keep us true 
to the Bill of Rights and strikes the proper bal-
ance between cherished liberties and smart 
security. 
I urge my colleagues to support the USA 
Freedom Reauthorization Act. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I will just real quickly say that the 
gentlewoman is exactly right. People 
should be prosecuted. It was so bad in 
the Carter Page application. Here is 
what the former chief judge of the 
FISA court said: 
The frequency with which representations 
made by FBI personnel turned out to be un-
supported or contradicted by information in 
their possession and with which they with-
held information detrimental to their case 
calls into question whether information con-
tained in other FBI applications is reliable. 
Put in plain English: You lied so 
much, how can we trust any other rep-
resentation you have made to the 
court? 
That is what this legislation is de-
signed to begin to address and protect 
American citizens who will be in front 
of this court. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. 
SENSENBRENNER), 
who 
has 
been 
a 
strong advocate in this area and former 
chairman of the Judiciary Committee. 
Mr. 
SENSENBRENNER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I am no stranger to this de-
bate. In the aftermath of 9/11, I stood 
on this floor to advance the USA PA-
TRIOT Act. I still believe, as I did at 
the time, in its necessity to protect our 
country from terrorist attacks. 
In 2015, after abuses of the surveil-
lance authorities were brought to 
light, I fought for reforms that resulted 
in the passage of the USA FREEDOM 
Act. 
Today I rise in support of this reau-
thorization bill. The expiring provi-
sions are still necessary to the national 
security of the United States. However, 
much like in 2015, we have been made 
aware of surveillance abuses that re-
quire our attention. I believe this bill 
offers substantial reforms to the For-
eign Intelligence Surveillance Act, re-
forms that are imperative for account-
ability and the restoration of Ameri-
cans’ confidence in our intelligence 
system. 
The FISA abuses in the Carter Page 
case were staggering. We learned about 
these when Inspector General Michael 
Horowitz released his report on Decem-
ber 9, 2019. I said at the time that Con-
gress had the responsibility to fully ex-
amine his findings and to take correc-
tive actions. 
Unfortunately, we have not fully ex-
amined this report. Despite being re-
leased 3 months ago, we have not held 
one hearing on the House side. There is 
documented 
evidence 
of 
errors, 
missteps, and omissions that resulted 
in the degradation of Carter Page’s 
constitutional rights, and, to date, the 
House majority has largely ignored it. 
So I am glad that the majority is fi-
nally acknowledging the abuses in the 
Horowitz report by introducing correc-
tive actions in this bill. 
There are several good provisions for 
accountability in the bill. For in-
stance, the Attorney General must now 
approve, in writing, the FISA inves-
tigation of an elected official or can-
didate for Federal office. Also, the leg-
islation expands the use of an amicus 
in cases involving the political activi-
ties of U.S. citizens. The legislation 
creates checks to ensure that informa-
tion being presented to the FISC is ac-
curate. 
It is impossible to legislate away bad 
behavior by malicious actors, but this 
legislation places much-needed safe-
guards to prevent another Carter Page- 
type scandal from happening again. 
My colleagues who wish we should do 
more are right; we should do more. But 
with a deadline on Sunday, we must ei-
ther act now or let these important na-
tional security authorities expire. 
Since the inception of the PATRIOT 
Act, I have fought for oversight of pow-
erful surveillance apparatus. I believe 
that the reforms presented in this bill 
are a good step to restoring the over-
sight. 
The reauthorization reinforces essen-
tial and effective tools that have been 
in place since 9/11, while also strength-
ening the protection of citizen civil lib-
erties in the United States. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the distinguished 
gentleman from Illinois (Mr. QUIGLEY). 
Mr. QUIGLEY. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in strong support of this USA 
FREEDOM 
Reauthorization 
Act 
of 
2020. 
This bill strikes just the right bal-
ance between protecting our national 
security and strengthening civil lib-
erties. It preserves critical tools used 
by authorities to investigate inter-
national terrorism and foreign intel-
ligence matters, but also makes sig-
nificant reforms to enhance privacy 
and transparency. 
I would like to quickly highlight 
some of the important privacy protec-
tions included in the bill.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1631 
March 11, 2020 
For example, the FBI may no longer 
be able to keep business records col-
lected under FISA indefinitely. Those 
records would have to be destroyed 
after 5 years, except in very narrow cir-
cumstances. 
The government will also have to 
provide notice to individuals whose 
business records are used in a criminal 
case or other proceeding unless the 
proceeding’s adjudicator finds that dis-
closure would harm national security. 
Individuals who receive notice would 
then be able to challenge the legality 
of the government’s collection, a right 
that should be maintained when intru-
sive national security authorities are 
used to gather evidence. 
In addition to these privacy enhance-
ments, the bill also requires greater 
transparency about how the govern-
ment uses FISA. The bill imposes a 180- 
day clock on declassification of signifi-
cant opinions issued by the FISA court 
and requires the government to look 
further in its historical records than it 
has done before. 
Moreover, the bill enhances trans-
parency in the intelligence commu-
nity’s annual public reports so we get a 
better sense of when the government 
conducts U.S. person queries into FISA 
data. 
These are but some examples of the 
important transparency and private re-
forms contained in this bill. These re-
forms are all accomplished without 
negatively impacting our national se-
curity. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to join me in voting for it. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Arizona (Mr. BIGGS). 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
The recurring theme that I have 
heard today is that we should be doing 
more to fix FISA. That is not unlike 
what James Madison described in the 
Federalist Papers when he described 
parchment barriers between the var-
ious 
departments 
of 
government, 
meaning the three branches of govern-
ment, afraid that all of it could be 
sucked into the vortex of power—those 
are 
his 
words—of 
the 
legislative 
branch. 
And here we are discussing parch-
ment barriers for those who have basi-
cally abused the FISA process so far. 
We are putting more parchment bar-
riers in place, but they don’t mean 
anything. They don’t mean anything if 
you never see someone prosecuted. 
So let’s talk about one of the things 
that has been touted, a lengthening of 
the time of sentencing from 5 years to 
8 years if you are found to commit 
abuse. 
How 
about 
contempt 
pro-
ceedings that are being put in here? 
But do you know what? We know 
FISA was abused. We know that people 
lied to the court, and we know some-
thing else. The Inspector General rec-
ommended criminal charges be filed on 
people. 
These parchment barriers make no 
sense, have no strength and no efficacy 
when we don’t see someone indicted, 
charged, or convicted. To say some-
thing is criminal in nature doesn’t 
matter when you don’t prosecute them. 
If you want to deter somebody, you 
must see prosecution so, that way, you 
get specific deterrence for that indi-
vidual or general deterrence to the rest 
of the people who are inclined to com-
mit bad acts. 
The flaws in this bill are that we 
don’t see application of any of these re-
forms. So we can tout them all we 
wish—a whole litany of them—but 
until you actually hold people account-
able, this bill has no efficacy. For that 
reason, I will be opposing. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Ohio (Mr. DAVIDSON). 
Mr. DAVIDSON of Ohio. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to caution my 
colleagues about this false dilemma of 
security versus freedom and about sup-
porting and defending our Constitution 
against all enemies foreign or domestic 
by abridging the rights and freedoms 
protected by our Constitution. 
I want to applaud, frankly, the be-
hind-the-scenes folks on the commit-
tees who worked hard to make this bill 
better than the status quo. Many of my 
colleagues will look at this, and, frank-
ly, that has been the argument by the 
ranking member and the chairman 
that this bill really isn’t that good of a 
bill, that it is really not what we 
should do, but it is better than the sta-
tus quo. 
Too often that is what happens here. 
I think that might leave people with 
the false perception that we couldn’t 
do better. But the reality is there is bi-
partisan 
agreement 
and 
bicameral 
agreement on the Safeguarding Ameri-
cans’ Private Records Act. 
The bill that the committee was 
going to move forward with was pulled. 
The committee process didn’t take 
place because there was a bipartisan 
coalition of conservatives and progres-
sives who had a plan to amend the bill. 
It may, in fact, have been a completely 
different bill. 
We also didn’t take it through com-
mittee. We also didn’t allow any 
amendments, so numerous good amend-
ments weren’t even able to be consid-
ered, amendments like the confess your 
transgressions amendment that would 
say that, of all these agencies that re-
port, the Director of National Intel-
ligence would say: What has been done 
to discipline people who access these 
records in violation of statute? 
My colleague, Mr. BIGGS, highlighted 
the real problem. There is one standard 
for everyday Americans and a different 
one for the powerful and connected. 
Our Justice Department needs to hold 
someone accountable. Whether it is in 
my district, in a Republican district, or 
one of my colleagues’ districts, in a 
Democratic district, we get the same 
question: When is someone going to 
jail? 
We need to know that the law is 
being followed, that Lady Justice does 
have a blindfold on, and that there is 
one standard. This falls far short of 
that, and it is not the standard that 
should be used against American citi-
zens; therefore, it is not the standard 
that should be used to secure our coun-
try. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, may I 
inquire of the Chair how much time the 
minority has remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Ohio has 21⁄2 minutes re-
maining. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
North Dakota (Mr. ARMSTRONG). 
Mr. ARMSTRONG. Madam Speaker, 
to my colleagues on both sides who 
think that this bill doesn’t go far 
enough, I can tell you that, probably 3 
days ago, I was 100 percent in your 
camp. If you would have told me today 
I was going to stand up and speak in 
favor of this bill, I would have told you 
that is not true, yet here I am. 
The reason is because I think we are 
dealing with some issues that are im-
portant to discuss: 
One, there is no legislation that we 
can write that will make bad actors 
not be bad actors. There is no amicus 
provision or any provision that is going 
to allow for somebody who is going to 
lie to their own superiors to not lie to 
somebody else. 
Two, the provisions of lone wolf and 
roving wiretaps are incredibly impor-
tant to national security. There is not 
a lot of debate amongst those things. 
Three, FISA and title 1 were origi-
nally designed because of abuses to 
civil rights. We know that title 1 has 
been abused, and that is why we are 
here. 
But are we better off without title 1? 
I don’t think so. We weren’t before. We 
are better off with it. 
So what does this bill actually do 
that is important, that is why a guy 
like me who believes in the Fourth 
Amendment, 
believes 
in 
the 
First 
Amendment, and believes in the pri-
vacy of our citizens, why would I stand 
here? 
Because 
it 
increases 
trans-
parency; it moves it through the proc-
ess faster; it puts real compliance 
checks in place; and it holds people ac-
countable both through a contempt 
proceeding and enhanced criminal pen-
alties. 
When we are dealing with something 
as important as civil liberties, I think 
we have to ask the question: Are we 
better off tomorrow than we are today? 
This bill puts us in a better position to-
morrow than it did yesterday. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Ohio has 1 minute remain-
ing. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time to 
close.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1632 
March 11, 2020 
Madam Speaker, as the gentleman 
from North Dakota just articulated, 
the bill is better than where we are 
currently—no call detail records, ami-
cus kicks in if there is a First Amend-
ment concern of any American citizen 
who is in front of the court. The pen-
alties are real: You lie to the court, 
you omit information from the court, 
or you go leak information about the 
application you submitted to the court, 
there are enhanced penalties. 
There is the transcript provision. 
There is now a transcript that will be 
given to the intelligence community. 
That is a good step, knowing that 
somebody is going to be looking at 
what you are doing and is going to see 
it in a real timeframe is important. 
The annual assessment from the IG, 
the same IG who just told us 3 months 
ago that the FBI went to the court in 
the Carter Page application and lied 17 
times, that individual, Mr. Horowitz, 
will be doing an annual assessment; 
compliance office within the Depart-
ment of Justice so that there are more 
people looking at the application on 
the front end, hopefully, we don’t have 
as many problems; and finally, as the 
chairman indicated, no cell site GPS 
location indication without a war-
rant—those are victories for the Amer-
ican citizen. It is not as much as we 
would like, but it is a darn good first 
step. 
Madam Speaker, I urge people to sup-
port the legislation, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
I just want to say that I am in com-
plete agreement with the ranking mi-
nority member that this is a very good 
bill, that we do a lot of things that we 
ought to do, that we don’t do a lot of 
things, unfortunately, that we should 
do, but we did what we could. 
Undoubtedly, the ranking member 
and I have different ideas. Some of the 
things which he thinks we did not 
enough I think we did too much and 
vice versa, but we did have some of the 
things he thinks that we shouldn’t 
have done I wish we had done. But we 
did manage to reach agreement. 
As I said, I believe it is a very good 
bill. It is not as protective of civil lib-
erties as I would like to see it, but we 
got as far as we possibly could, and so 
I urge everyone to vote for this bill. 
I know there will be some dissent on 
our side of the aisle based on civil lib-
erties concerns. I can only say that, 
with most of those concerns that I 
have heard voiced, I agree with them, 
but we just couldn’t get them. 
Before I close, I want to recognize 
the staff on both sides of the aisle who 
have worked around the clock for the 
past few weeks to reach a compromise 
and bring this bill to the floor. 
Although there are too many to 
name here, I should single out the fol-
lowing individuals: Aaron Hiller, So-
phia Brill, and Sarah Istel from my 
staff; Wells Bennett, Nicolas Mitchell, 
Raffaela Wakeman, and William Wu 
from the Permanent Select Committee 
on 
Intelligence 
majority; 
Ryan 
Breitenbach and Bobby Parmiter from 
the Judiciary Republican side; Stephen 
Castor and Tyler Grimm from Mr. JOR-
DAN’s staff; and Laura Casulli, Meghan 
Green, and Allen Souza for the HPSCI 
Republicans. 
b 1545 
The country should be proud of what 
we have all accomplished here, what 
they have accomplished here, and I 
thank each and every one of them. 
Madam Speaker, in closing, I will 
simply say that it is our responsibility 
to work across the aisle and across the 
branches of the government to bring 
our national security in line with our 
values. 
We have done so here, but that work 
is an ongoing project. It must not end 
today, because we have a long way to 
go yet. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support the USA FREEDOM 
Reauthorization Act, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from California (Mr. SCHIFF) 
and the gentleman from California (Mr. 
NUNES) each will control 15 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California (Mr. SCHIFF). 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of the USA FREEDOM Reauthor-
ization Act of 2020. 
This bill makes a number of critical 
and important reforms to strengthen 
civil liberties and privacy protections 
under the Foreign Intelligence Surveil-
lance Act while simultaneously pro-
tecting the national security of the 
United States. In addition, the bill pro-
vides for greater transparency and in-
creased oversight and accountability to 
ensure the integrity of the FISA proc-
ess. 
Over the past several weeks, Chair-
man NADLER and I, along with Speaker 
PELOSI
and Majority Leader HOYER, 
have worked with Members from across 
the caucus and the aisle to develop a 
set of reforms that our Democratic 
Caucus could be proud to support. This 
bill is a result of that effort. It builds 
on the achievements of the USA FREE-
DOM Act of 2015, which passed with 338 
votes in the House and the over-
whelming support of the Democratic 
Caucus to put in place long-sought re-
forms to FISA. 
The three expiring provisions that 
this bill would reauthorize are vitally 
important to protecting national secu-
rity. One of those measures, the roving 
wiretap provision, authorizes contin-
ued court-approved surveillance of tar-
gets, even if they change their phones 
or other devices. Its expiration, or that 
of the other two provisions, would be 
to no one’s benefit. Our counterterror-
ism and national security activities 
would be severely hamstrung, and we 
would have lost the opportunity to 
press for reforms that we are seeking. 
At the outside of this process, admin-
istration officials, like the Attorney 
General, along with Senate Republican 
leadership, made it clear that they pre-
ferred a clean and permanent reauthor-
ization of these authorities. On a bipar-
tisan basis, this bill rejects that de-
mand, producing a bill that holds firm 
to our commitment to civil liberties, 
oversight, and transparency, and, im-
portantly, has an important sunset. 
Let me describe just a few of the re-
forms included in this legislation: 
The bill would end, once and for all, 
NSA’s authority to collect call detail 
records on an ongoing basis, and de-
stroy all records previously obtained 
under these authorities. 
This bill would require that the gov-
ernment get a warrant under FISA, if 
one would be needed in the law enforce-
ment context. 
This bill would prohibit the govern-
ment from retaining business records 
for more than 5 years, with exceptions, 
such as an imminent threat to human 
life. 
This bill would expand the appoint-
ment of amici in FISA court pro-
ceedings, permit amici to seek access 
to more information, and creating a 
framework for amicus to seek higher 
court review of questions of law to the 
FISA courts. 
The bill would also strengthen the re-
quirement for the declassification and 
release of FISA court opinions and 
apply the requirements retroactively 
to prior to the enactment of the 2015 
USA FREEDOM Act. 
Madam Speaker, I recognize there 
are additional reforms that Members 
would like to see in the bill. I sought 
additional reforms as well. As with any 
negotiation, no one side is getting ev-
erything they want, but I believe it is 
important to enhance transparency 
and privacy safeguards whenever pos-
sible. 
But this is a strong result that 
makes substantial reforms that so 
many members of our caucus, myself 
included, have worked hard to secure 
for many years. And I will continue to 
work to secure further protections for 
privacy and civil liberties and to pro-
vide vigorous oversight of FISA. 
Madam Speaker, I support the bill, 
which makes important reforms to the 
FISA process and urge Members to 
vote ‘‘yes,’’ and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. NUNES. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, the Foreign Intel-
ligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, is a 
critical tool for thwarting terrorist 
plots and collecting vital intelligence 
on actors who are hostile to U.S. inter-
ests. 
During the FBI’s 2016 Russia collu-
sion investigation, however, FBI offi-
cials grossly abused FISA to spy on an 
associate of a Presidential campaign 
they opposed. 
The purpose of the bill before us 
today is to reauthorize expiring FISA 
authorities while ensuring that other

FISA tools can never again be turned 
against the American people for polit-
ical purposes. 
In 2017, in the course of our own in-
vestigation on Russia, House Intel-
ligence 
Committee 
Republicans 
re-
ceived strong indications that FISA 
had been severely abused in order to 
spy on Carter Page, a former associate 
of the Trump campaign. 
As we investigated the matter, we 
were stonewalled at nearly every junc-
ture by top officials of the FBI and the 
Department of Justice. Their denials of 
any wrongdoing were uniformly re-
peated by the media and by political 
figures, who were spreading the false 
accusation that Trump campaign offi-
cials colluded with the Russian Gov-
ernment to interfere in the 2016 Presi-
dential election. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank my 
Republican colleagues and staff on the 
committee who persisted amid the 
most determined obstruction of any in-
vestigation this House has seen in a 
long time. 
I also want to thank our Republican 
colleagues on the House Oversight and 
Judiciary 
Committees 
who 
worked 
hard to uncover the full extent of this 
malfeasance. 
The full scope of the abuse was even-
tually detailed by Inspector General 
Michael Horowitz, whose December 
2019 report revealed 17 major mistakes 
and omissions, along with many lesser 
abuses. 
Among many other abuses the In-
spector General found, is that the FBI 
had used unverified allegations from 
the Steele dossier to get a FISA war-
rant on Carter Page; had misrepre-
sented the reliability of those allega-
tions to the court; had omitted excul-
patory information from their submis-
sion; and had doctored an email to hide 
Page’s prior cooperation with a U.S. in-
telligence agency. 
H.R. 6172 is the first step in imposing 
reforms to address these gross abuses 
and restore accountability in the FISA 
process. These reforms include but are 
not limited to: 
Requiring the Attorney General’s ap-
proval in order to obtain a FISA war-
rant for any candidate for Federal of-
fice; 
Imposing stronger penalties for those 
who conceal information from the 
FISA court or leak FISA-derived infor-
mation; and 
Providing 
clear 
authorization for 
Congress to access FISA materials so 
that elected officials can better oversee 
FISA cases without obstruction. 
This legislation makes strong re-
forms that will protect the American 
people 
from 
government 
overreach 
while continuing to protect the home-
land from terrorist threats. 
Close Congressional oversight of the 
FISA process, which will be enhanced 
significantly by this bill, must con-
tinue in order to prevent future abuses. 
What happened to the Trump campaign 
in 2016 can never be allowed to happen 
again, not to a political campaign and 
not to an American citizen. 
I believe I speak for all Republicans 
when I say that our work is not fin-
ished. We will continue to look for fur-
ther ways to improve both privacy pro-
tections as well as FISA’s effectiveness 
in defusing national security threats to 
our country. 
Madam Speaker, I urge support of 
H.R. 6172, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I yield 
4 minutes to the gentleman from Con-
necticut (Mr. HIMES). 
Mr. HIMES. Madam Speaker, I thank 
and compliment the chairman and the 
ranking member—and the chairman 
and ranking member of the Committee 
on the Judiciary—for doing such good 
and bipartisan work at this rather 
tense and polarized time around reau-
thorizing a number of authorities that 
have been, not just important, but es-
sential to keeping the American public 
safe. 
And they did that, of course, mindful 
of the need to balance those authori-
ties and those activities with the very 
legitimate civil liberties interests that 
we all have, and with our obligation to 
the Constitution, which we all swear 
an oath to support and defend. 
Madam Speaker, as the chairman 
said, this bill will reauthorize, even as 
it imposes additional oversight, a cou-
ple of very important authorities, 
while ending the authority that I think 
in the last several years was most 
problematic to me, to many people in 
this Chamber, and to the American 
people, which was the bulk collection 
of telephone metadata. 
That was a debate that led to the 
original USA FREEDOM Act of 2015, to 
those reforms, and gets us to where we 
are today where Americans can know 
that the NSA, a foreign intelligence 
agency, will not be collecting their 
records, their metadata. And I believe 
that that is a very substantial achieve-
ment in today’s bill. 
I would like to take a moment, 
though, to wrestle with a charge that 
was leveled by my friends and col-
leagues on the progressive side, and 
their recommendation with respect to 
this bill. Their statement called these 
authorities ‘‘sweeping unconstitutional 
surveillance.’’ And, with respect, I 
would say that none of that is true. 
Sweeping. Let’s talk about sweeping 
for a second. I guess we could argue 
about exactly what that means, but of 
the authorities that are being dis-
cussed, we are ending the metadata 
program. 
The 
lone-wolf 
authority, 
which allows us to surveil a potential 
terrorist who is not affiliated with a 
designated terrorist group, has never 
been used. That leaves, of course, the 
roving wiretap authority, which is used 
in a pointed and careful way and has 
been used to save lives and prosecute 
terrorists. That is not, I would suggest 
with respect, sweeping. 
So constitutional, the charge that 
this is unconstitutional is something 
that we should examine and take seri-
ously. In this time of overheated rhet-
oric, I think it is important that we be 
very clear and very specific in the 
words that we use. So let me just say 
about the charge that there is any-
thing unconstitutional in these au-
thorities: 
No provision has ever been held to be 
unconstitutional 
by 
the 
Supreme 
Court, by the FISA court itself, or by 
any other court. 
And it is not just the courts, these 
authorities have been subject to review 
by the President’s Civil Liberties Over-
sight Board, and they have not deemed 
any of these authorities unconstitu-
tional. 
They have been subject to Congres-
sional scrutiny and, of course, most fa-
mously and most recently, subject to 
review by the Inspector General, who— 
yes—discovered very significant defi-
ciencies in the way a FISA application 
dealing with an American citizen was 
dealt with. 
My friends who are concerned about 
the possibility of the unconstitutional 
activity should remember, not a single 
authority has ever been deemed to be 
unconstitutional. And over and over 
again, the FISA court, and most re-
cently Inspector General Horowitz, has 
pushed back hard on misbehavior, on 
negligence in this area. 
So what we are left with here is bal-
ance. And as the chairman and as the 
ranking member have said, the reforms 
that are made in this bill with respect 
to empowering an amicus, with respect 
to giving the President’s Civil Lib-
erties Oversight Board additional au-
thorities strike that balance. 
Madam Speaker, I close by urging my 
colleagues to accept that we have made 
a lot of progress, that this was all 
about preserving civil liberties, and to 
vote in favor of H.R. 6172, the USA 
FREEDOM 
Reauthorization 
Act 
of 
2020. 
b 1600 
Mr. NUNES. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. MCCARTHY), the Republican 
leader. 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, 
before I begin, I want to thank the gen-
tleman, the ranking member of the In-
telligence Committee. He warned the 
American public when he was chair. He 
warned them and told them that FISA 
was not used correctly, that the power 
of the government overstretched their 
arms. 
But even when the other elements of 
government said no, they did not, even 
when others got on to that exact same 
position and told us everything was 
fine with FISA, it was not until the in-
spector general got his report that the 
truth was known. 
I thank Congressman DEVIN NUNES 
for being the truth, telling it to the 
American public, and staying with it 
when others wanted to lie. 
That is why we are here today. That 
is why this will not continue or ever 
happen again. 
Madam Speaker, at the heart of our 
Constitution is a simple idea, the idea

of checks and balances. These prin-
ciples protect Americans’ freedoms by 
creating safeguards against the poten-
tial of government overreach of power. 
Unfortunately, in 2016, those checks 
and balances were not in place to stop 
individuals at the highest level of the 
FBI and Justice Department from spy-
ing on Carter Page, an American cit-
izen who could have been one of us. 
They used the secretive FISA courts, 
which are meant to keep Americans 
safe from foreign enemies, to attempt 
to undermine their domestic political 
opponent at that time, then-candidate 
Donald Trump. 
After years of thorough and inde-
pendent investigation, we now know 
the truth: what happened in 2016 was 
politically motivated; it was com-
pletely unjustified; and it must never 
happen again. 
This bipartisan legislation addresses 
the need for greater accuracy and ac-
countability in the FISA process. It 
does not damage the legitimate au-
thorities our intelligence community 
relies on to keep us safe, but it does 
strengthen protections for civil lib-
erties. 
Among its many reforms, this legis-
lation increases the punishment for un-
authorized disclosure of FISA applica-
tions, authorizes an amicus to be ap-
pointed to cases involving political ac-
tivity, and enhances oversight by Con-
gress and creates a new Office of Com-
pliance. 
These reforms are an astonishing ac-
complishment in a period of divided 
government. That just tells you how 
important FISA reforms and checks 
and balances truly are. 
Outside this Chamber, there are 
quotes from famous Americans who 
dedicated their lives to preserving 
American freedom. 
One of those individuals, Patrick 
Henry, was so passionate about his de-
fense of freedom that he famously said: 
‘‘Give me liberty or give me death.’’ We 
can learn a lot from Henry’s total de-
votion to the American cause. 
We can learn a lot from those who 
are willing to stand up to oppressive 
Big Government, who would use an 
arm illegally against the check and 
balance just to try to have an outcome 
in a political race. 
We could thank those like DEVIN, 
who stood for the American public and 
the truth, or those in other committees 
who helped work on this, the JIM JOR-
DANs, the DOUG
COLLINSes, that we 
would not be here today and getting a 
new compliance office, a check and bal-
ance to make sure what happened in 
2016 cannot happen again. 
I do urge all my colleagues to vote 
‘‘yes.’’ I do urge that this is a turning 
point, that even though in these com-
mittees they could have told us, and 
they did, that there was nothing 
wrong, that we had to continue to fight 
to get an inspector general to have the 
truth. 
Now, we have a check and balance 
that we will not have to wait for that. 
Even if somebody tries to use it in the 
wrong manner, it cannot happen again. 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. LOFGREN). 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I 
am especially thankful to Chairman 
SCHIFF for yielding me this time since 
I have reached a different conclusion 
on the bill than he has. 
I would like to quote from the Amer-
ican Civil Liberties Union letter re-
ceived today. The American Civil Lib-
erties Union strongly urges us to vote 
‘‘no’’ on this bill. 
They say: ‘‘Over the last several 
years, it has been abundantly clear 
that many of our surveillance laws are 
broken.’’ But that, ‘‘disappointingly, 
the reforms contained in H.R. 6172 are 
minimal—in many cases merely rep-
resenting a codification of the status 
quo. In addition,’’ the ACLU says, ‘‘the 
bill contains provisions that would be a 
step back from even our flawed current 
law.’’ 
The ACLU goes on to say that ‘‘the 
bill fails to require that individuals re-
ceive appropriate notice and access to 
information when FISA information is 
used against them,’’ that ‘‘the bill fails 
to fully address deficiencies with the 
FISA court that have led to illegal sur-
veillance,’’ that ‘‘the bill fails to ap-
propriately limit the types of informa-
tion that can be collected under sec-
tion 215,’’ that ‘‘the bill fails to appro-
priately raise the standard for col-
lecting information under section 215,’’ 
and that ‘‘the bill fails to appropriately 
limit the retention of information col-
lected under section 215.’’ 
I agree with the chairman that the 
roving wiretap provision in the act is 
important and should be renewed. But 
I cannot support the bill that is before 
us today, and I say that with tremen-
dous respect for Chairman SCHIFF. We 
have had very candid and useful discus-
sions. I appreciate the effort that he 
has put into this. 
I have put in a lot of effort, too. But 
in the end, we have a bill that I think 
should not be supported. I intend to 
vote ‘‘no,’’ with tremendous respect for 
the chairman and the effort that he has 
put into this. 
Mr. NUNES. Madam Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. GOHMERT). 
Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate my friend yielding to me, 
and I appreciate my colleague, Ms. 
LOFGREN’s comments. 
Any law that is based on a lie has a 
good chance of being a problem. The lie 
starts with the initial FISA, the For-
eign 
Intelligence 
Surveillance 
Act. 
Yet, it is not foreign. 
Now, since I have been here, whether 
it is the PATRIOT Act or reauthorizing 
the FISA court, we are told: Look, 
American citizens have nothing to 
worry about because the only Amer-
ican 
citizen 
that 
gets 
caught 
up 
through the FISA court is somebody 
that is dealing with a known foreign 
terrorist or a known foreign organiza-
tion engaged in terrorism. You know, 
just avoid dealing with terrorists, and 
you are going to be okay. 
The problem is, I keep hearing, this 
is a good first step. No, this isn’t the 
first step. This is the last step, and as 
my friend Ms. LOFGREN said, it doesn’t 
go far enough. 
As my friend MICHAEL CLOUD said, 
under the current bill, they ignored the 
penalty for lying to the judge, which 
was a 5-year sentence. Now, under the 
new law, they can ignore an 8-year sen-
tence. That doesn’t really help preserve 
anybody’s rights. 
This was not done in the committee. 
It did not have proper debate. The se-
cret court had the bill pulled away 
from 
the 
full 
committee, 
so 
we 
couldn’t debate it. We couldn’t discuss 
it, and it was pulled into a secret nego-
tiation that many of us were not part 
of. 
Look, having the Attorney General 
sign it doesn’t work either, and it 
shouldn’t be a special category for Fed-
eral elected officials. In fact, what it 
should be is all Americans. 
Acting Attorney General Rosenstein, 
he signed off on one of the applications 
himself. Obviously, that is not a deter-
rent. 
We need to fix the FISA court. This 
doesn’t do it, and I will vote ‘‘no’’ until 
we have adequate reforms that do. 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I have 
no further speakers. I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. NUNES. Madam Speaker, I yield 
3 minutes to the gentleman from Utah 
(Mr. STEWART). 
Mr. STEWART. Madam Speaker, let 
me state a fact. FISA has been abused 
by those who are trusted with author-
ity, and we can’t let it happen again. 
This is what we know are also facts: 
An opposing campaign paid a foreign 
citizen to dig up dirt on President 
Trump and his campaign associates. 
These allegations—produced, by the 
way, by a foreign citizen—came to be 
known as the Steele dossier. The cam-
paign then fed these bogus allegations 
through the administration, to include 
leadership at the FBI, the CIA, the De-
partment of Justice, and even the 
State 
Department. 
Then, 
the 
FBI 
shamefully used these bogus allega-
tions as the basis for a secret wiretap, 
of course, on the famous Mr. Carter 
Page. 
The FBI deliberately hid the fact 
that these allegations were both known 
to be bogus and the fact that the cam-
paign had paid for them. The applica-
tion on Mr. Page cited a news article 
corroborating these allegations, but 
the FBI hid from the court the fact 
that they knew the source of these ar-
ticles was the author of the dossier. 
We discovered that the FBI and DOJ 
investigators in this case demonstrated 
enormous bias against the Trump cam-
paign with such words as: we will stop 
him; he won’t become President; viva 
la resistance. 
Finally, the inspector general re-
vealed that an FBI attorney altered a

document to deceive the court regard-
ing Mr. Page’s relationship with an-
other agency. 
These are shocking abuses of power, 
and the reforms in this bill will stop 
them from ever happening again. 
I am proud to have been the author 
of the bill that is the basis for some of 
these reforms. 
It requires an amicus review for ap-
plications against U.S. citizens when 
their First Amendment rights are in 
question. 
It requires the court to maintain a 
transcript. I have read this FISA appli-
cation. It begs for questions to be 
asked. We don’t know if the judges 
were curious or asked obvious ques-
tions because we don’t have a tran-
script. 
It requires the government to keep a 
log. 
It enhances penalties for up to 8 
years for those who improperly surveil 
or deceive the court. It allows agencies 
to take immediate action, including 
termination, of those who do. 
Madam Speaker, it is incumbent on 
us, as an institution, to ensure these 
abuses simply don’t happen again. The 
USA FREEDOM Reauthorization Act 
will accomplish this. 
Let me end by saying this: To those 
who oppose this bill, if you vote 
against this bill, you keep the status 
quo. FISA remains in place. The ability 
to abuse FISA doesn’t change. 
Vote ‘‘yes’’ on this bill or accept fu-
ture abuse. That is the choice we have 
before us. I hope that we don’t do that. 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NUNES. Madam Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Ar-
kansas (Mr. CRAWFORD). 
Mr. CRAWFORD. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of the USA 
FREEDOM 
Reauthorization 
Act 
of 
2020. 
I would also like to associate myself 
with the comments of my friend and 
colleague from Utah (Mr. STEWART). 
I also acknowledge and applaud the 
efforts of the distinguished gentleman 
from California (Mr. NUNES), whose te-
nacity brought this to bear. I appre-
ciate his leadership on this issue. 
This is a bipartisan piece of legisla-
tion that makes urgent and necessary 
reforms to the FISA process, which, as 
Inspector General Horowitz found 3 
months ago, was misused to conduct il-
legal surveillance on Carter Page, a 
U.S. person. 
This bill enhances requirements on 
the FBI and DOJ to ensure all applica-
tions are accurate and complete. This 
bill creates a compliance officer at the 
FBI who is directly responsible for 
making sure FBI agents are following 
the law. 
This bill heightens criminal penalties 
to deter bad actors and other layers of 
review to root them out. 
Finally, the bill reauthorizes three 
counterterrorism tools that are signifi-
cantly important to our national secu-
rity. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to support 
this bill, and I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote from 
my colleagues. 
Mr. NUNES. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Just a couple of comments for some 
of my colleagues who I know are con-
cerned that this doesn’t go far enough. 
One of the concerns they have is that 
there is an ongoing investigation led 
by the U.S. attorney out of Con-
necticut, and there is a lot of con-
sternation on our side of the aisle that 
nothing has been done yet. 
I want to assure my colleagues that 
even if that gets to a point where peo-
ple are held accountable for what we 
believe to be criminal activity, these 
reforms in this new piece of legislation 
where we opened up title I, we believe 
that we have all the reforms that are 
necessary to prevent this malfeasance 
from happening again in the future. 
b 1615 
If this doesn’t work and if this does 
happen again, I think then you will 
have what some people want, which is 
a complete elimination of the court 
and this entire system. 
I hope that we don’t get to that point 
in this country, because these tools 
have worked well as long as the people 
who are conducting and using these 
surveillance capabilities don’t decide 
to turn them on political opponents. 
So I want to, you know, assure my 
colleagues on this side of the aisle that 
we feel like these reforms are as far as 
we need to go at this time, no matter 
what the ultimate conclusion is of the 
U.S. attorney out of Connecticut on 
whether 
or 
not 
to 
bring 
charges 
against those who perpetrated these 
crimes and criminal activity. 
Madam Speaker, I am prepared to 
close at this time. 
In closing, the weaponization of 
FISA, as exhibited in 2016, should never 
have happened, and this bill aims to 
prevent future gross abuses from occur-
ring again. 
I would like to thank my staff, par-
ticularly Allen Souza, Laura Casulli, 
Meghan Green, Andrew House, and 
Betsy Hulme, for all their efforts to 
reach 
this 
bipartisan 
compromise. 
They worked many, many hours with 
Members of both parties and colleagues 
of both parties, staff of both parties, 
from the Judiciary Committee and the 
Republican and Democratic leadership, 
to reach this bipartisan compromise. 
I am also fairly confident, with the 
remarks that have been made on the 
Senate side, that this will be a rare op-
portunity where we actually pass a 
bill, and it appears like the Senate is 
prepared to accept a complete House- 
produced product, which I think means 
a lot to everyone involved in this proc-
ess, that that rarely happens, espe-
cially in this day and age. 
Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of 
H.R. 6172, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
I want to, for my Democratic col-
leagues, provide a reality check on 
some of what they have heard during 
this debate. 
It is important to remember that the 
inspector general report—which, by the 
way, doesn’t go to the expiring provi-
sions that we are here to authorize 
today. But the inspector general report 
found no evidence of spying on the 
Trump campaign. 
The inspector general found no evi-
dence of political bias influencing deci-
sionmaking in the investigation of the 
Trump campaign and its connections 
to Russia during the 2016 election. 
The inspector general found that the 
investigation, in fact, was properly 
predicated, 
that 
investigation 
into 
many of the more than 100 unexplained 
and often falsely denied contacts be-
tween the Trump campaign and the 
Russians during the 2016 campaign, in-
cluding a notorious secret meeting in 
Trump Tower between the President’s 
son, son-in-law, and campaign chair-
man with a Russian delegation that 
was set up by a series of emails in 
which a Russian delegation offered dirt 
on Hillary Clinton to the Trump cam-
paign, and the President’s son, on be-
half of that campaign, said that he 
would love it and set up that secret 
meeting. Now, my colleagues don’t 
think that is collusion; the American 
people do. 
Bob Mueller, for his part, much as his 
report has been misrepresented, makes 
it clear in the very first pages of the 
report that he does not address the 
issues of collusion, only whether he can 
prove criminal conspiracy. 
So it is important, with that reality 
check, to once again return to the bill 
before us. With respect to the bill be-
fore us, we do make important changes 
to strengthen the privacy protections, 
the civil liberties protections. We also 
retain the important tools necessary to 
help protect the country, the business 
records provision, the lone-wolf provi-
sion, as well as the roving wiretaps. 
The roving wiretap provision, for ex-
ample, allows the government, when 
someone, for example, in the midst of 
planning a crime of terrorism uses 
phones disposably and goes from one 
phone to another, it is not necessary to 
go and get a new warrant every time 
they change phones. The warrant can 
follow the individual rather than the 
phone. 
The business records provision has 
also been very important in terms of 
our efforts at foreign intelligence gath-
ering as well as counterterrorism. 
Those authorities would be retained, 
but new protections would be put in 
place 
such 
that 
business 
records 
couldn’t be retained more than 5 years 
unless certain exceptions applied, pro-
tections where, if business records 
gathered in the FISA context are used 
in a criminal proceeding, there is no-
tice given to people that they are being 
used in a criminal proceeding. 
There is expansion of the amicus au-
thorities so that we have the amicus

involved in a broader scope of cases so 
the court has the advantage of inde-
pendent judgment. 
Some of those reforms come out of 
the inspector general’s recommenda-
tions and looking into the FISA appli-
cation involving Carter Page. Many of 
those recommendations have nothing 
to do with Carter Page and are long-
standing interests of the privacy com-
munity in trying to strengthen some of 
the privacy protections. 
I also want to take this opportunity 
to thank Representative LOFGREN and 
Representative JAYAPAL. We worked 
extensively, have spent hours our-
selves, our staff, consulting and trying 
to make this a better and stronger bill. 
While I regret that we couldn’t get it 
to the point where those two esteemed 
Members felt they could support the 
bill, nonetheless, their input made this 
bill better, and I am grateful for their 
hard work and advocacy on behalf of a 
stronger privacy and civil liberties pro-
tection. 
This vote today is the culmination of 
many months of negotiations. There-
fore, with our diverse Caucus, with our 
friends in the other party who, as you 
have heard today, we have strong dis-
agreements over the Russia investiga-
tion, the Trump campaign’s conduct, 
as well as the FISA process, but, none-
theless, in the interest of our Nation’s 
security, we were able to get to com-
mon ground on this measure, giving 
the government the critical tools it 
needs to protect the country while ad-
vancing civil liberties and privacy 
rights. 
This 
bill 
creates 
a 
much-needed 
change to the way government uses 
FISA, ensures the government is more 
transparent and accountable, and I 
urge my colleagues to support the bill. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam Speaker, 
in 2016, our nation’s premier law enforcement 
agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, 
weaponized its authority to illegally surveil a 
U.S. citizen for political purposes. 
What happened to Carter Page, then-can-
didate Trump, and the Trump campaign was 
wrong, and it is our responsibility to ensure it 
never happens again. The USA Freedom Re-
authorization Act achieves that, but our work 
is far from done. 
While this bill doesn’t include every reform 
sought by Republicans, it does accomplish our 
central goal: To institute necessary safeguards 
to protect the civil liberties of every American 
and reauthorize critical counterterrorism provi-
sions. 
This bipartisan legislation also protects U.S. 
citizens from being spied on for political pur-
poses by requiring that the Attorney General 
approve any investigation of an elected official 
or federal candidate. This provision directly 
addresses the abuses against Carter Page 
and the Trump campaign. 
Some have claimed that provision prioritizes 
politicians over Americans. It does not. That 
provision addresses the real abuse docu-
mented by House Republicans and the DOJ 
Inspector General—abuse that strikes at the 
core of our democratic republic. 
In addition to multiple other reforms, this 
legislation makes it a crime to willfully make a 
false statement to the court, and increases 
penalties for those who abuse the system. 
These provisions are aimed like a laser at the 
abuses that occurred in 2016 and 2017. 
Madam Speaker, Congress must continue 
to conduct vigorous oversight and work with 
our law enforcement and intelligence commu-
nities to restore the American people’s trust in 
these critical institutions. 
Our government’s primary duty is to protect 
its citizens and their constitutional rights, and 
every American should have confidence we’re 
fulfilling that role. 
I urge my colleagues to support this vitally 
important legislation. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
for debate has expired. 
Pursuant to House Resolution 891, 
the previous question is ordered on the 
bill, as amended. 
The question is on the engrossment 
and third reading of the bill. 
The bill was ordered to be engrossed 
and read a third time, and was read the 
third time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the passage of the bill. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The yeas and nays were ordered. 
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 278, nays 
136, not voting 15, as follows:

(6) For more than two decades, Qassem 
Soleimani posed a deadly threat to American 
personnel and interests as commander of the 
Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary 
Guard Corps, which is responsible for Iran’s 
extraterritorial military and clandestine op-
erations. His activities to fund and train 
Iran’s terrorist proxies in Iraq, Syria, Leb-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1638 
March 11, 2020 
to the deaths of more than 600 United States 
troops. 
(7) In late 2019, Soleimani began escalating 
Iranian-supported attacks on Americans, in-
cluding the assault on the United States Em-
bassy in Baghdad and a rocket attack that 
killed an American citizen and wounded four 
United States servicemembers in Iraq. Prior 
to his death, Soleimani was traveling around 
the Middle East coordinating further attacks 
on Americans. 
(8) Removing Qassem Soleimani from the 
battlefield has increased the safety and secu-
rity of American troops, diplomats, and citi-
zens, of our partners and allies, including the 
State of Israel, and of the world. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Texas is recognized for 5 minutes in 
support of his motion. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, here 
we are, once again, debating war pow-
ers when the simple fact is we are not 
engaged in hostilities against Iran. 
Why are we wasting precious floor 
time when all the American people 
really care about today is coronavirus? 
Today the WHO declared it a pandemic. 
That is the biggest threat to our Na-
tion today. 
So, why are my colleagues launching 
more partisan political attacks against 
this President for taking justified mili-
tary 
action 
to 
protect 
Americans 
against one of the world’s most dan-
gerous terrorists? 
That is why my motion states that 
Soleimani was a terrorist and that the 
world is safer without him, just like 
the world was safer when President 
Obama ordered the strike on bin Laden 
when Republicans and Democrats came 
together to praise his decision. Presi-
dent Obama conducted thousands of 
unauthorized strikes in Libya unre-
lated to protecting Americans, and at 
that time Leader PELOSI said that she 
was satisfied he had the authority for 
those strikes. 
Soleimani was a mastermind of ter-
ror in the Middle East for two decades, 
and that is why President Obama des-
ignated him as a terrorist. 
Soleimani 
funded, 
trained, 
and 
equipped Iran’s terrorist proxies in 
Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Yemen, and Af-
ghanistan. 
Soleimani is the one who convinced 
Russia to fight for Assad. 
Tens of thousands of innocent people 
in Syria are dead today, victims of war 
crimes, because of Soleimani. 
Soleimani played a key role in the 
crackdown of protesters in Iraq that 
killed hundreds of Iraqis. 
Most importantly, Madam Speaker, 
he has the blood of over 600 American 
soldiers on his hands. 
Under Soleimani’s command, Iran 
tried to assassinate the Saudi Ambas-
sador to the United States in a Wash-
ington, D.C., restaurant less than 4 
miles from where we are standing 
today. 
The danger he posed to the United 
States was not just a thing of the past. 
He was directing a campaign of terror 
and violence against us in Iraq, which 
killed one American and injured four 
other servicemen. 
He orchestrated the attack on our 
Embassy in Baghdad. 
Look at this picture. This was not 
simply a brush fire, Madam Speaker. 
They stormed and attacked our Em-
bassy under Soleimani’s orders. 
What more evidence do we need than 
this? 
Soleimani was not done after his at-
tack on our Embassy. He wasn’t on a 
vacation when he went to meet with 
his top lieutenants in Damascus, Leb-
anon, and Baghdad. Secretary Pompeo 
testified 
to 
our 
committee 
that 
Soleimani was in the region actively 
plotting to kill Americans. He was 
going to report back to Tehran, to the 
Ayatollah, to plan future attacks. 
What if our President had done noth-
ing and our Embassy was attacked 
again like in 1979 with diplomats taken 
hostage? What if the President did 
nothing? What if more United States 
troops were killed? What then would 
the other side of the aisle be saying? 
Madam Speaker, the enemies of our 
country are watching this debate right 
now, and they need to know darn well 
that, if you kill or injure Americans, 
you will pay the price. 
Like President Reagan, I am a firm 
believer in peace through strength. 
When we show strength like we did 
with this necessary strike, our enemies 
back down. 
So, Madam Speaker, I call upon my 
colleagues to drop their partisanship, 
to stand as Americans as we did when 
President Obama struck bin Laden, and 
to support this simple fact that the 
world 
is 
a 
better 
place 
without 
Soleimani. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I claim 
the time in opposition to the motion to 
commit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Maryland is recognized 
for 5 minutes. 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I doubt 
that there is a person on this floor who 
disagrees with the premises that Mr. 
MCCAUL just stated. Soleimani was a 
bad person. I said during the course of 
debate on the Slotkin amendment, 
which referenced exactly that premise, 
that no one lamented the loss of Mr. 
Soleimani—no one. That is not what 
this bill is about, nor is that what this 
amendment is about. 
This bill, which is called a partisan 
bill by Mr. MCCAUL, had 15 percent of 
the Republicans in the United States 
Senate vote for it. 
This bill, called a partisan bill, says 
the bill we are voting on, the bill we 
are going to pass, says that Members of 
the United States Armed Forces and 
intelligence community and all those 
involved in the planning of the Janu-
ary 2, 2020, strike on Qasem Soleimani, 
including President Donald J. Trump, 
should be commended for their efforts 
in a successful mission. That is what 
the bill that we are asking this body to 
vote for says. 
Madam Speaker, does that sound to 
you like a partisan document? 
Now, Madam Speaker, the purpose of 
this motion is to kill this bill. This is 
a Senate bill. It will send it back to 
committee. It will not allow it to pass 
with an amendment, and it will pre-
clude it from going to the President of 
the United States. 
Now, what this issue is about is our 
Constitution, about the power of this 
body, about the responsibility of this 
body, and about the authority of this 
body to declare or not declare war. 
That is what this bill is about. 
There may be some in this body who 
want to shrink from that responsibility 
and send it to the President of the 
United States, but our Founders be-
lieved that was not what our democ-
racy ought to be. It ought to be the 
Representatives of the people who take 
them to war, not a President—any 
President, Democratic or Republican— 
to take us to war. 
This is about our responsibility. It 
commends President Trump, and it 
commends our Armed Forces, and it al-
lows them to defend themselves if at-
tacked. But it stands for the propo-
sition that I hope all Members are for, 
that we, the Representatives of the 
American people, ought to decide on 
their behalf whether they or their sons 
and daughters go to the point of the 
spear at war—not just one person. 
There are a lot of countries in this 
world where one person makes the de-
cision. They are called dictators. Our 
Founding Fathers did not want dic-
tators running America. 
And I say to my colleagues, of 
course, our Republican friends who are 
offered this amendment never vote for 
an MTR, because—and I will not read 
the litany of quotes from so many of 
you—an MTR is simply to delay and 
defeat. Your quotes, not mine. 
So I ask all of us, without exception, 
vote against this MTR, vote to send 
this bill to the President of the United 
States, supported by 15 percent of the 
Republicans in the United States Sen-
ate. It is not a partisan bill. It doesn’t 
attack President Trump. In fact, it 
says, ‘‘our troops,’’ and ‘‘President 
Trump ought to be commended.’’ It is 
in the bill. 
Don’t tell me this is a partisan act. It 
is not. It is an act of responsibility, 
and to our oath of office, and to the 
Constitution of the United States. Vote 
‘‘no.’’ 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair. 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without 
objection, the previous question is or-
dered on the motion to commit. 
There was no objection. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion to commit. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the noes appeared to have it. 
RECORDED VOTE 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I de-
mand a recorded vote.

CELEBRATING SCORING 
SENSATION RAKIYAH SELLERS 
(Mr. PAYNE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate a scoring sensation 
in my district, Rakiyah Sellers. The 
senior guard at College of Saint Eliza-
beth scored her 1,000th career point in 
February. 
She began her basketball career at 
the Ivy Hill Elementary School in New-
ark, New Jersey. From there, she con-
tinued to shine as a standout player for 
the Lady Jaguars of Newark’s Arts 
High School. 
Her scoring milestone came in a Co-
lonial States Athletic Conference semi-
final. Her team, College of Saint Eliza-
beth, beat Notre Dame of Maryland 
University 76–51. 
In the conference final, Rakiyah had 
4 points, 2 assists, 2 blocks, and 3 
steals. Unfortunately, her Eagles of 
Saint Elizabeth lost to the Keystone 
Giants 72–61, but that does not dim her 
accomplishment. She is a shining star 
of Newark, and I am proud to highlight 
her today.

HONORING LIFE OF DR. DAVID L. 
RICE 
(Mr. BAIRD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BAIRD. Madam Speaker, today, I 
rise to celebrate and honor the life of 
Dr. David L. Rice. 
Dr. Rice was the founding and first 
president of the University of Southern 
Indiana, where he worked from 1967 
until his retirement in 1994. 
Before his time at the University of 
Southern Indiana, Dr. Rice earned a 
bachelor of science in agriculture and a 
master of science and a doctor of phi-
losophy in education, all from Purdue 
University. 
While studying at Purdue, he met his 
wife, Betty J. Fordice, and the two 
were shortly wedded to one another. 
The following year of their marriage, 
Dr. Rice answered the called for his 
country and served in the United 
States Army infantry in Korea. 
After serving in the military, Dr. 
Rice returned to Indiana, where he 
taught public school while pursuing his 
advanced degrees at Purdue. 
In 1967, Dr. Rice was appointed to 
lead the Evansville campus of Indiana 
State University. By 1985, under his 
leadership, the campus became its own 
separate university, the University of 
Southern Indiana. 
During his tenure, the University of 
Southern Indiana grew in enrollment

from 992 students to 7,443, expanded the 
curriculum from 2-year degree pro-
grams to a comprehensive range of bac-
calaureate and master’s degree pro-
grams. He did such an exemplary job, 
they honored him by naming the li-
brary after him. 
Dr. Rice was also very dedicated to 
bettering his community. He was a 
member of countless groups and orga-
nizations, such as being on the board of 
the Evansville Museum of Arts, His-
tory and Science, and starting an orga-
nization called Leadership Everyone. 
The group looks to develop leaders in 
the community who are committed to 
utilizing inclusion and creativity in 
order to bring positive change. 
Dr. Rice’s legacy of service and 
achieving 
excellence 
will 
live 
on 
through all the lives he impacted and 
through the David L. Rice and Betty 
Fordice Rice Presidential Scholarship. 
Most importantly, his memory will 
live on through his family. Dr. Rice is 
survived by his wife of 69 years, Betty 
‘‘Janey’’ Fordice Rice, and their two 
children, along with six grandchildren.

NOW IS TIME TO ACT ON 
CORONAVIRUS 
(Mr. KILMER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. KILMER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to share my sympathies for lives 
lost due to the coronavirus and to offer 
my gratitude to the first responders, 
healthcare professionals, and others 
working to respond to this public 
health emergency. 
Now is the time for action. 
Last week, Congress approved $8.3 
billion in funding to ensure the Federal 
Government steps up to the scale and 
seriousness of this growing crisis: pub-
lic health funding, support to State 
and local health agencies, investments 
in R&D for vaccines, and a measure I 
led to help our small businesses that 
are already feeling the impact. 
This week, the Federal Government 
should go further to help workers and 
families across the country. I am proud 
the House will be moving to ensure 
paid sick days and economic assistance 
for impacted workers, to increase ca-
pacity of the medical system, to pro-
tect first responders, to make testing 
more widespread and free, and to en-
sure access to food for the most vulner-
able Americans. 
There is no time to waste. The House 
should act now to ensure the safety 
and security of the American people.

RECOGNIZING ACHIEVEMENTS OF 
HAROLD AGNEW 
(Mr. BURCHETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to recognize the achievements of 
Harold Agnew, from Knoxville, Ten-
nessee. 
At 91 years young, Harold continues 
to be active in our community through 
his job as a barber and a gospel musi-
cian. 
Harold was raised on a farm in South 
Carolina but came to call Knoxville 
home in his adult years. For 61 years, 
Harold has been a barber and still 
works 6 days a week at Gam’s Barber-
shop in Mechanicsville. 
Anyone who has had their hair cut by 
Harold will notice something unique 
about him. He is a gifted singer who 
sings gospel tunes as he works. He is a 
member of the group known as Brother 
Agnew and the Angel Voices, which re-
leased their latest album called ‘‘Serv-
ing the Lord’’ in November 2019. 
At 91 years old, Harold has a cheerful 
personality and optimistic attitude. He 
continues to live his life to the fullest, 
with no intention of taking a step back 
from his day job. 
One of the lyrics from his recent 
songs is, ‘‘but sometimes a nobody is 
your somebody.’’ Harold believes ev-
eryone matters, regardless of who you 
are. That is a message we can all be-
lieve in. 
Congratulations, Harold, on all your 
success. Keep being an outstanding 
member of our great community.

Ms. SPANBERGER. Madam Speaker,

‘‘Pete’’ Taylor, the owner of a commu-
nity pharmacy in our district and our 
Central Virginian of the Week.

RECOGNIZING ENTREPRENEUR 
ANGIE RUFF 
(Mr. SPANO asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. SPANO. Madam Speaker, today, 
I rise to recognize Women’s History 
Month, a time to highlight the many 
often-overlooked female contributions 
to our national history. 
Great 
women 
have 
undoubtedly 
helped make America great. From the 
classroom to the boardroom, from Cap-
itol Hill to outer space, their impact is 
undeniable. 
Now, across our land, women-owned 
businesses are thriving in our booming 
economy above all others. Over the 
past 5 years, these businesses have 
grown by 21 percent, compared to 9 per-
cent across all other sectors. 
An example of this entrepreneurial 
spirit is seen in Lakeland, Florida’s 
own Angie Ruff. Mrs. Ruff opened a dry 
food manufacturing business in 2018. 
Through her dedication and passion for 
creating good local jobs, her warehouse 
has since tripled in size, and her head 
count quadrupled. The future for her 
and other entrepreneurs like her looks 
bright. 
It is because of individuals like Angie 
Ruff, who are making history, that I 
am proud to represent Florida’s 15th 
District on the House Small Business 
Committee, and it is because of dedi-
cated women like her that we can 
proudly say: America is back and open 
for business.

HONORING SEEING EYE DOGS 
(Ms. SHERRILL asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor The Seeing Eye and 
Seeing Eye dogs for being named the 
State dog of New Jersey. 
Seeing Eye dogs are New Jersey’s 
cutest export. But that alone does not 
capture the inspiring and important 
work behind an organization that has 
partnered more than 17,000 service dogs 
in North America. 
The Seeing Eye is the world’s oldest 
guide dog school, dedicated to enhanc-
ing the independence, dignity, and self- 
confidence of people who are blind. 
Headquartered in Morristown, they 
breed, raise, and train service dogs, and 
work with blind individuals to handle 
and care for their dogs. 
They conduct research on canine 
health and development, and they 
helped to lead the passage of the Amer-
icans with Disabilities Act. 
I have seen the care the organization 
puts into pairing each individual with 
the right dog, fundamentally trans-
forming their owners’ lives. 
I would like to thank The Seeing Eye 
for 91 years of leadership and State 
Senator Tony Bucco and the late Sen-
ator Anthony M. Bucco for their work 
to make the Seeing Eye dog New Jer-
sey’s State dog.

Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, 
this past Saturday, I was proud to at-
tend the Eagle Scout Court of Honor 
for 
Thomas 
Scott 
Jefferson 
in 
Whitesboro, south Jersey. TJ is a mem-
ber of Whitesboro Troop 104. 
TJ not only was an exemplary stu-
dent, maintaining a 4.0 GPA through-
out high school, but he was also a com-
mitted volunteer at CCWI, a homework 
club, among other after-school activi-
ties. 
He is currently studying classical 
performance voice at William Paterson 
University. He has an avid love for the 
arts, performing and starring in nu-
merous plays, operas, and choirs. 
TJ has become recognized for his 
singing voice, and he has continued to 
perform not only across the region but 
even training on Broadway in New 
York City. 
We are so proud of you, TJ. I look 
forward to big things from you. I am 
confident you will live up to the name 
‘‘Thomas Jefferson.’’ 
Congratulations to you and to your 
family. Some people look to sports or 
movie stars or, heaven forbid, politi-
cians as role models. But it is individ-
uals like you that inspire me. 
You are one of my heroes. I know 
your future is bright, and may God 
bless you.

THE NEED FOR PAID SICK LEAVE 
(Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend her remarks.) 
Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. 
Madam Speaker, last night, I was so 
pleased to hold a telephone townhall 
with 
my 
colleague, 
Representative 
CHRIS PAPPAS, New Hampshire public 
health officials, and over 10,000 Granite 
Staters to provide an update on the im-
pact of the coronavirus. 
I continue to hear from constituents 
who are concerned, and a recurring 
theme for many is a lack of access to 
paid sick leave, which complicates our 
ability to address this public health 
crisis. 
When faced with an illness or medical 
issue, many Americans face a chal-
lenging decision to put their job and 
their income at risk or risk their own 
health and the health of their col-
leagues and their community. 
I 
am 
proud 
to 
support 
ROSA 
DELAURO’s legislation to expand access 
to paid sick leave so that workers are 
able to follow the directives of public 
health officials and stay home from 
work when they are feeling ill. 
As Congress continues to address 
policies to protect the American people 
against the spread of the coronavirus, I 
urge consideration of this important 
bill. 
MATERNAL HEALTH CRISIS 
(Ms. SCANLON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to celebrate the historic bi-
partisan legislative package introduced 
this week to address the United States’ 
urgent maternal health crisis. I am re-
ferring to the Black Maternal Health 
Momnibus. 
Each year, 700 women in our country 
die from pregnancy complications, but 
3 in 5 of those deaths could be pre-
vented. 
The United States’ maternal mor-
tality rate is exponentially higher than 
that of any other developed country, 
and Black women are three times more 
likely to die from pregnancy-related 
complications than White women, a 
glaring disparity that we cannot ig-
nore. 
In my community, organizations like 
The Foundation for Delaware County 
and the Maternity Care Coalition have 
stepped up to address this crisis, but 
we must do more. 
I am proud to join Congresswomen 
LAUREN UNDERWOOD and ALMA ADAMS, 
Senator KAMALA
HARRIS, and other 
congressional leaders in introducing 
the Black Maternal Health Momnibus. 
The momnibus provides a comprehen-
sive approach to maternal health, and 
particularly Black maternal health, by 
funding 
community-based 
organiza-
tions, investing in social determinants 
that influence maternal health out-
comes, and growing and diversifying 
the prenatal workforce. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
important legislation for all our fami-
lies. 
f 
CHINA AWARENESS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
SCANLON). Under the Speaker’s an-
nounced policy of January 3, 2019, the 
gentleman from Florida (Mr. YOHO) is 
recognized for 60 minutes as the des-
ignee of the minority leader. 
Mr. YOHO. Madam Speaker, what I 
would like to do for the next few min-
utes is talk about an awareness cam-
paign, and that is to make people 
aware of China and what China is 
doing. 
We all know about China, a big coun-
try, wealthy country, a country that 
has come out of poverty and has be-
come an industrial powerhouse. They 
have become a world power. Yet a lot 
of people don’t understand what China 
really is doing. 
When one really studies the history 
of China and sees where they are going, 
it is pretty remarkable that many of 
our countries around the world and our 
companies around the world do busi-
ness with China. 
The Communist Party took over in 
1949, and that is when Mao Zedong 
came to power. He laid out a vision 
that I think any world leader would be 
proud of. He laid out a 100-year plan. In 
fact, they call it the 100-year mara-
thon. 
We have seen a remarkable advance-
ment of China, but, unfortunately, it 
was at the expense of many along the 
roadways. 
We look at what they have done; and 
their goal, if you listen to what Xi 
Jinping has said when he came to 
power, was he wanted to remove any 
Western influence from China. 
This 
was 
not 
too 
long 
after 
Tiananmen Square, where people in 
China were promoting liberties and de-
mocracies, and then the Tiananmen 
Square massacre happened where thou-
sands of people were run over by tanks 
in the streets as the world watched. 
Yet China has taken that history and 
swept it under the rug and pretends it 
didn’t happen. But we know. We have 
seen the videos. 
Since that time, Xi Jinping has come 
out with a very strong statement. In 
fact, in 2017, in the Sixteenth Chinese 
Communist Party Congress, he made a 
statement, and it is a warning, and it 
should be a wake-up call for all people 
who are buying products from China. 
In that statement, he said: The era of 
China has arrived. No longer will China 
be made to swallow their interests 
around the world. It is time for China 
to take the world center stage. 
As we looked into that—and we have 
talked to people from Hong Kong and 
from China—their intent is very real, 
it is very true, and it is very out front. 
They are not trying to hide anything. 
Their goal is to be a world dominant 
power, or the world dominant power. 
What we are seeing today in the 
world is a tectonic shift in world pow-
ers that we haven’t seen since World 
War II. China has made very clear what 
their intent is. 
Then they have marched on a cam-
paign since 1949. Deng Xiaoping, in the 
eighties, said that it could not compete 
with American or Japanese technology 
and manufacturing, but what they 
could do is they could corner the mar-
ket on rare earth metals. 
As China came into the modern 
world, America and other countries 
helped China in technology, science, 
research, in advancement of weaponry, 
thinking that China would come along 
and become more Western democracy 
in their thinking. That is the furthest 
from the truth. 
As China moved on, Deng Xiaoping’s 
vision came to realization. They talked 
about cornering the market on rare 
earth metals. Well, today, they control 
virtually 100 percent of the rare earth 
metals that are needed in our elec-
tronics, in our cell phones, in our mis-
sile guidance systems and our sat-
ellites. 
China has gone on to corner the mar-
ket in the APIs in our pharma-
ceuticals. The APIs are the active 
pharmaceutical ingredients. They con-
trol approximately 85 to 90 percent of 
that. They control the majority of the 
minerals and vitamins that go into our 
livestock feed.

H1651 
March 11, 2020 
So their intent is very clear, yet they 
hide behind policies that favor China. 
In the WTO, when they became a 
member of that in the nineties, they 
entered with a developing nation sta-
tus. Today, they are the second largest 
economy in the world. They are build-
ing five aircraft carriers. They have 
got a space program. They have ex-
panded around the world through their 
One Belt, One Road initiative. Yet, 
today, in the WTO, they claim devel-
oping nation status. 
It is time that we let everybody 
know these things and wake up the 
American people and our manufactur-
ers. China has risen, yet it has been at 
the expense of other nations. It is been 
through coercion, intimidation, not 
honoring contracts, and not honoring 
laws that are world norms. 
A good example of that is what is 
going on in the South China Sea. They 
have reclaimed landmasses, and they 
went ahead and built facilities on these 
to the point where they have military 
installations, runway strips, military 
barracks, offensive and defensive weap-
ons on there, military radar systems. 
Xi Jinping, when he was here visiting 
President Obama in 2015, said they 
have no intention of militarizing those 
structures; yet, today, they are milita-
rized. 
China has encroached on the ASEAN 
nations in the East China Sea, in the 
South China Sea, and they have gone 
into the exclusive economic zones in 
those areas, not honoring the world 
norms or the laws of the sea. In fact, 
the Philippines took them to court. 
At the court arbitration, China lost 
the case. They said they had no claims 
to the nine-dash lines that China 
claims that the Philippines challenged 
them on. The Philippines won, yet 
China ignored that ruling and kept 
doing the dredging of the landmasses, 
destroying thousands of acres of coral 
reefs and laying claim to that area. 
China has used their heavy hands 
with our corporations when somebody 
does something unfavorable to what 
China wants. An example is the Mar-
riott Hotel employee who had men-
tioned something favorable about Tai-
wan. That person got fired. 
We have seen that over and over 
again with different industries. Just re-
cently, the manager of the Houston 
Rockets 
tweeted 
in 
favor 
of 
the 
protestors in Hong Kong to stay strong 
for liberties and freedoms, and we all 
know what China did. The NBA backed 
down to placate China. We have seen 
this with corporation after corpora-
tion. We have seen Nike do this. We 
have seen other corporations do this. 
I think today, in the modern world 
today and what we are going through 
with 
the 
coronavirus—another 
gift 
from China—is the supply chain that 
they control of so many products that 
the world is dependent on, and I think 
this is a wake-up call that we need to 
remove manufacturing from China. We 
can’t do it as a government, but our 
manufacturers can. 
We have drafted a policy. It is called 
‘‘Manufacture the ABC Method,’’ and 
that is manufacturing anywhere but 
China. 
When we make a product in China, 
China benefits from it. China intro-
duces their Chinese Communist Party 
members 
within 
their 
corporation. 
Many times, our corporations have to 
give up their intellectual property. So 
China benefits from this by the theft of 
that property plus the production of 
that property. They counterfeit so 
many of our manufacturers’ products, 
and our manufacturers go out of busi-
ness. 
We have met with many manufactur-
ers that went over there initially for 
cheaper labor. Within 5 years, China 
has copied that product. That product 
is competing against the original man-
ufacturer. It is being sold cheaper, and 
it is of an inferior quality, so it ruins 
the reputation of the manufacturer and 
they wind up going out of business. 
Then China just keeps producing. We 
see it over and over again, that they 
keep doing that. 
We see constant abuses of human 
rights that we have seen over and over 
again, and these have been reported in 
the news. So many times we stand up 
for human rights around the world, and 
if we really, truly believe that as a na-
tion, we believe in those values of lib-
erty and freedom, that all people are 
created equal, that they have the right 
to life, liberty, and the pursuit of hap-
piness, they have the right of due proc-
ess, they have the right to a court of 
law, if we believe in those things, we 
have to look at our trade policies. 
Why are we trading with a country 
that blatantly ignores those? 
I think I want to just pivot to Hong 
Kong. 
I think everybody in the world agrees 
that Hong Kong is a province of China. 
In 1997, Great Britain and China came 
to an agreement that they would allow 
Hong Kong to go back to China over a 
50-year process, and that was going to 
be from 1997 to 2047. 
Hong Kong had the ability and the 
guarantee that they would be a semi-
autonomous region, a portion of China, 
that they would have an independent 
judiciary system, they would have 
their own election process. 
Yet 22 years into that process, we see 
the heavy hand of Xi Jinping and the 
heavy hand of the Chinese Communist 
Party. 22 years into that agreement, Xi 
Jinping came out publicly and said, as 
far as he was concerned, that agree-
ment is null and void. 
We saw the extradition bill that was 
brought up by their chief executive of-
ficer, Carrie Lam, and we know that 
she didn’t bring that up by herself. 
That was at the direction of Beijing. 
What that law did is it was robbing 
liberty and freedom from the people of 
Hong Kong. And it is sad, because the 
people of Hong Kong have always 
known liberty and freedom in today’s 
modern world. But, unfortunately, the 
people of China—Xi Jinping and the 
Chinese Communist Party—they, un-
fortunately, have never experienced 
liberty and freedom because they have 
lived under a communist, repressive re-
gime that we have seen only grow 
stronger. 
We did a floor speech down here on 
Tiananmen Square on the anniversary 
last summer, and shortly after that, 
within weeks, there were the protests 
in Hong Kong about the extradition 
bill. 
b 1815 
And when you have 2 million people 
coming out in the streets in a province 
of China that has less than 8 million 
people, you have got a quarter of your 
population, and it was young people, it 
was old people, it was educated people, 
it was business people, mothers, fa-
thers, children, and they are all pro-
testing against the heavy-hand of 
China, because what they saw was free-
dom and liberty being taken away from 
them. 
If that was an isolated case, that 
would be one thing, but what we have 
seen with China is the intimidation, 
the erasing of cultures, as they have 
done with the Tibetans, as they have 
tried to do with other ethnic minori-
ties in their country, whether it is the 
Uighurs, the East Turkistan region, 
the Kyrgyz. And we see this over and 
over again, yet they make no apologies 
for it. 
China is One Belt One Road. Or the 
Belt and Road Initiative is often re-
ferred to as One Belt One Road, and it 
goes one way, and that goes to the Chi-
nese Communist Party. 
They do predatory lending practices 
that put other countries in debt where 
they can’t pay it back, and China 
winds up taking strategic ports. They 
have strategically done this around the 
world. They are in the Western Hemi-
sphere and they are marching on. 
The purpose of this Special Order to-
night is to get people to pay attention 
to what China is doing. Who are we 
going to do business with in the future? 
We have got a country that their 
goal is to take over the world. Xi 
Jinping says, and their philosophy is, 
you cannot have two suns in the sky at 
the same time, meaning one has to 
come down; and in their philosophy 
that would be us. Again, those are very 
confrontational points of view that 
they are pursuing, and they are pur-
suing them rapidly. 
We have seen the intimidation of cor-
porations with them. We have seen the 
intimidation of China and their heavy- 
hand with other countries. 
The Czech Republic was going to 
have their Speaker of the House go to 
Taiwan to do some business there. 
China told them if they went there, the 
Czech Republic, their auto company, 
could no longer do business in China. 
We have seen them do this with Mer-
cedes Benz. If they don’t buy Chinese 
batteries, they can no longer market in 
China, even though the majority of the 
Mercedes Benz Corporation is con-
trolled by a Chinese individual.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1652 
March 11, 2020 
We have seen the race for the 5G 
phone network with Huawei, with ZTE, 
in 2012, in this country. In this body 
here, in the House Intelligence Com-
mittee and the Senate Intelligence 
Committee, both ZTE and Huawei, in 
2012, were deemed a national security 
risk. Yet, they keep going on and claim 
to be private enterprises. Yet, we know 
that the Chinese Communist Party and 
Government have invested heavily in 
those companies. 
And what they are doing is, they are 
using their technology that will be able 
to be invaded through the backdoor by 
the Chinese Communist Party to be 
able to spy on people. Today, China has 
the most CCT cameras, closed-circuit 
television cameras, to where today in 
modern China they are using these tel-
evision cameras to grade their citizens. 
They have good citizen scores. If you 
don’t do what the Chinese Communist 
Party tells you, you can’t travel, you 
can’t bank, you can’t go to the res-
taurants. 
It is 1984, George Orwell’s story is 
happening right now. 
And what they are doing is they are 
doing that to suppress people. They 
have offered that technology around 
the world. They are using it in Hong 
Kong. 
They 
have 
offered 
that 
to 
Maduro in Venezuela to control his 
people. The Iranian ayatollahs want to 
use that technology. Vladimir Putin 
wants to use it. 
And what we are finding is any au-
thoritarian or despotic government 
wants that technology so that they can 
control their citizens. If you look in 
the Xinjiang region, which is East 
Turkistan. East Turkistan has been an 
Asian area of China for over 100 years. 
Yet, when the Communist Party came 
in they took it over, recently they re-
named it Xinjiang, which means New 
Territory. And I bring that up because 
it is home to a Muslim population, the 
Uighurs, the Kyrgyzstans, the Kyrgyz, 
that are being suppressed by China. 
I think we have all heard of the con-
centration camps that are going up all 
over China. We have done hearings—I 
sit on the Foreign Affairs Committee, I 
chaired the Asia Pacific Subcommittee 
last year, the ranking member this 
year, and we have had hearing after 
hearing on the human rights suppres-
sion, just the terrible things that they 
are doing over there. 
When we looked into it, we have 
enough reports to feel this is true. 
What they are doing is, China has in-
terned over a million Uighurs, and 
other ethnic groups, the Kyrgyz, the 
Turkistans, they have put them into 
these so-called re-education camps, but 
they are not re-education camps, they 
are concentration camps. 
They 
have 
armed 
crematoriums 
around the country associated with 
these camps. And my question when we 
were in the Foreign Affairs Committee 
doing this hearing: Why do you need an 
armed crematorium? You know, the 
people that are supposed to be there 
are supposed to have passed away. 
But we recently met with some peo-
ple that—I found it very interesting. 
The people we met with were from East 
Turkistan. They had a Cossack person 
with them who had just won an award 
from Mike Pompeo and First Lady 
Melania 
Trump, 
for 
her 
courage, 
Women of Courage Award. 
And what we found as we were listen-
ing to the story is, this family, an edu-
cated 
family, 
the 
husband 
was 
a 
schoolteacher, the wife was a prac-
ticing medical doctor. I mean, they 
were model citizens. 
Well, the husband saw what was hap-
pening to his relatives, what was hap-
pening in the Xinjiang area, so he got 
passports, took himself and his kids 
out. The wife, the doctor, applied for a 
passport, China would not allow her to 
go. They felt she needed to go to the 
re-education camp. This is a lady that 
is a doctor that was practicing. China 
puts them in there, saying it was a 
threat to our country, she was a ter-
rorist, they need to be re-educated. 
What China is trying to do is erase 
other cultures. We have just seen this 
over and over again. And so when we 
spoke to these people that were in our 
office this week, I asked them, I said: 
Do you have reports of abuses? And 
they went on and on about the abuses. 
How they strap people in chairs, they 
electrocute them, they torture them, 
pull out their fingernails. The women 
were being raped, people were being—I 
can’t say murdered, because they said 
they would disappear and never be seen 
again. 
These are things—you know, it is not 
just hearsay. We have reports from all 
kinds of magazines, all kinds of re-
searchers. 
Here is one from Radio Free Asia, 
‘‘China Secretly Transferring Uyghur 
Detainees from Xinjiang to Shaanxi, 
Gansu Province Prisons.’’ And it goes 
on talking about ethic Uighurs held in 
political ‘‘re-education camps.’’ I am 
going to put quotes around that be-
cause they are not re-education camps, 
they are concentration camps, because 
the Chinese Communist Party is the 
highest of the hierarchy, there can be 
nothing higher than that. And if you 
have a religion, and you have a deity 
above that, that puts the Chinese Com-
munist Party and people like Xi 
Jinping in fear because they don’t 
know how to control free thought. 
These people are being sent to prisons 
in those provinces. 
‘‘China to address an overflow in 
overcrowded camps, where up to 1.1 
million Uyghurs and other Muslim eth-
nic minorities accused of harboring 
strong religious views and politically 
incorrect ideas have been held since 
April of 2017.’’ This is something that 
has been going on not just 3 years, but 
longer than that, but it is coming to 
light. 
We have asked their ambassadors, 
have they had the Western Press in 
there, free and open presses? And they 
said: Oh, no, there is no need. These 
aren’t going on. But we know they are 
going on. This is just one report. 
I have another one here, Madam 
Speaker, information concerning China 
killing prisoners to harvest organs. 
This is something we have heard over 
and over again. We have had hearings 
on this. This is a multi-billion-dollar 
industry in China. It happens to any-
body that doesn’t agree with the Com-
munist Party. They get picked up, they 
get imprisoned. Health checks are 
done. In fact, this person that was in 
our office is a medical doctor, she 
would do the health checks on these 
young Muslim men, and they would get 
a red check if they were healthy. And 
in the darkness of night, they would 
disappear, never to be seen again. 
The China Tribunal, which was a tri-
bunal put together to look into this, 
has published its final judgment. ‘‘The 
China Tribunal concluded ‘that forced 
organ harvesting has been committed 
for years throughout China on a sig-
nificant scale, and the tribunal has had 
no evidence that the significant infra-
structure 
associated 
with 
China’s 
transplantation industry has been dis-
mantled and absent a satisfactory ex-
planation as to the source of readily 
available organs concludes that forced 
organ 
harvesting 
continues 
till 
today.’ ’’ 
I don’t know how a civilized world 
can tolerate such atrocities. And when 
I see the armed crematoriums or the 
Uighurs being taken from their homes, 
forced from their homes, forced into a 
concentration camp, and then being 
rented out or sold as chattel to manu-
facturers, and this is well-documented, 
I don’t know how we can tolerate that 
or how we can look at our trade poli-
cies to do those kind of deals with a 
country that works like that. 
If they treat their own people that 
way, how do we expect they are going 
to treat any of us? 
We have talked about Tibet. We have 
talked about Xinjiang, East Turkistan, 
the purging of individuals, the social 
credit scores, the coercion and intimi-
dations. 
I haven’t touched on the theft of in-
tellectual property. There is over $600 
billion of intellectual property theft 
that goes on and erodes economies all 
over the world. 
I want to read an article here just 
briefly. ‘‘China Compels Uighurs to 
Work in Shoe Factory That Supplies 
Nike.’’ And I don’t bring Nike’s name 
out to put a ding on Nike. It says: ‘‘The 
workers in standard-issue blue jackets 
stitch and glue and press together 
about 8 million pairs of Nikes each 
year at the Qingdao Taekwang Shoes 
Company, a Nike supplier for more 
than 30 years and one of the American 
brand’s largest factories. 
‘‘They churn out pair after pair of 
Shox, with their springy shock absorb-
ers in the heels, and the signature Air 
Max, plus seven other lines of sport 
shoes. 
‘‘But hundreds of these workers did 
not choose to be here: They are ethnic 
Uighurs from China’s western Xinjiang 
region’’—which again means New Ter-
ritory, 
they 
renamed 
from

Turkistan—‘‘sent here by local au-
thorities in groups of 50 to toil far from 
home. 
‘‘After intense international criti-
cism of the Communist Party’s cam-
paign to forcibly assimilate the mostly 
Muslim Uighur minority by detaining 
more than a million people in re-edu-
cation camps, party officials said last 
year that most have ‘graduated’ ’’— 
graduated from a work camp. 
And, again, if you talk to these peo-
ple—I have talked to pharmacists, I 
have talked to lawyers, I have talked 
to engineers, I have talked to doctors, 
they didn’t need to be re-educated. 
What China wanted to do was intimi-
date them, and basically brainwash 
them from their habits of a religion, of 
practicing their religion, and become 
good model Chinese citizens that bow 
down to the Communist Party. 
‘‘But there is new evidence to show 
that the Chinese authorities are mov-
ing Uighurs into government-directed 
labor around the country as part of the 
central government’s ‘Xinjiang Aid’ 
initiative. 
‘‘For the party, this would help meet 
its 
poverty-alleviation 
goals’’—and, 
again, this is a doctor. They are say-
ing, we need to alleviate their poverty 
goals—‘‘but also allow it to further 
control the Uighur population and 
break familial’’— 
The Uighur workers, they are afraid 
or 
unable 
to 
interact—the Uighur 
workers at these facilities are afraid or 
unable to interact with anyone in this 
town where they went to north of 
Qingdao, beyond the most superficial of 
transactions at the stalls or in the 
local stores where they go. They won’t 
talk to anybody. 
b 1830 
They won’t talk to anybody. The peo-
ple at these towns say: ‘‘Everyone 
knows the Uighurs did not come here 
on their own free will. They were 
brought here,’’ said one of the fruit 
sellers at her stall. ‘‘The Uighurs had 
to come because they didn’t have an 
option. The government sent them 
here,’’ another vendor told the report-
ers. They were sent forcibly. 
The report that we read did not ask 
their names out of concern for their 
safety, so they could not discuss the 
issues. 
Like I said, we met with Mrs. 
Sayragul Sauytbay, an ethnic Kazakh 
from East Turkistan that, today, is 
now called, as I said, Xinjiang. She is 
the one who shared this. She is a true 
freedom fighter. 
As we move on and we look at what 
China is doing, they have controlled so 
much of the supply chain. 
Then we see what happened with the 
coronavirus. 
The coronavirus came 
out. It started off in Hubei province in 
Wuhan. The epicenter was supposedly a 
fish market or a fresh market. 
With my science background, if you 
have an epicenter, you want to do your 
forensics and study it from an epide-
miological standpoint. China didn’t do 
that. 
We had a hearing where we had two 
epidemiologists there. They did not do 
the proper epidemiological studies, yet 
they destroyed any evidence that was 
there. 
Then the doctors that tried to report 
this wound up being put in prison, in 
jail. They came down with the virus, 
and then they died. 
China has done this over and over 
again. 
Then that virus spread around the 
world. This will be reported, I am sure, 
in history as the Chinese plague that 
they tried to hide and conceal like they 
did SARS and MERS. 
As we look at this as a nation and we 
make trade agreements and we work 
with these countries around the world, 
we should look at whom we are trading 
with. 
We have a standard that is known 
around the world. We have a rule of law 
honoring our contracts, and when we 
look to do business with people, we 
should do business with people we 
know, like, and trust, and I don’t think 
those apply to China. 
When you see the heavy hand of what 
China is doing, I just think, as a na-
tion, with our trade agreements and 
with our businesses going over there, 
we all need to relook at what we are 
doing. If they will treat Hong Kong 
that way with those students over 
there and then the threat of taking 
over Taiwan and their goal of taking 
over the world, I think that is some-
thing we all need to look at and say: 
Do you know what? We need to diver-
sify. 
That is why we are kind of proud to 
talk about the manufacturing policy, 
the ABC method, anywhere but China. 
Go to Vietnam. Go to Indonesia. Go to 
anywhere but a country that wants to 
take us over. 
I want to close on two things here. 
One is we had the students of Hong 
Kong who led the protests. They came 
to our office and they brought me this 
plaque. It says: ‘‘Democracy Now. 
Stand With Hong Kong.’’ They brought 
this plaque up, and as I have been able 
to travel around the world and I have 
seen how other countries look at Amer-
ica and they look at the ideals and the 
principles of this country, that is what 
they want. 
It made me think that America is 
bigger than a Presidency. It is bigger 
than a Republican or a Democratic 
Party. It is those ideals, and it is those 
ideals that these students in Hong 
Kong who brought us this plaque are 
willing to take a chance and protest 
the Chinese Communist Party. They 
burned their flag and held up the 
American flag because that represents 
liberties and freedoms. 
Taiwan is a different subject. Taiwan 
has never been part of the People’s Re-
public of China, the Communist Party, 
nor will they ever be. They have their 
own borders. They have their own mili-
tary, their own economy, their Western 
democracy, yet China wants to claim 
them as their own. 
I think this is a wake-up call for 
China. If you have got a quarter of a 
population in a province who knows 
they are part of China, you can’t do 
that to Taiwan because, when you look 
at the agreement we have with Taiwan, 
we have an agreement to make sure 
they have the equipment to protect 
themselves in a defensive manner. 
I want to end with what we started 
with. When we looked at the students 
from Hong Kong, it made me think. I 
think we have all seen pictures of 
grass. It is green, tender, new shoots. 
They are very tender. If we were to 
compare that with pavement, this is 
hard road. This is asphalt. 
If I were to ask you which one is 
tougher, which one is stronger, I think 
we would all say the asphalt is; right? 
But if we say this is freedom and lib-
erty and this is repression from com-
munism, which one is more powerful, 
liberties 
and 
freedoms 
will 
break 
through that force that is trying to 
suppress them. 
That is what is going on in the world, 
and that is why China will never suc-
ceed long-term in what they are doing. 
That is why the people of Xinjiang, the 
Uighurs, will win, because they have 
the strength of a blade of grass that 
can grow through the asphalt. 
I think I shared that the other day. 
These are the people who are standing 
up strong through that suppression. 
These are the people who have been 
there. 
My heart goes out to those people be-
cause I can look back at our country 
when it was formed. We were under the 
suppression of another power, and we 
decided that we weren’t going to live 
there because we are not designed that 
way as people. 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate the op-
portunity to be here, and I want people 
to think when they go to buy some-
thing and it says ‘‘Made in China,’’ find 
a different source. Buy it somewhere 
else. Encourage your manufacturers, 
your Nikes, your basketball teams to 
go somewhere else. Don’t go to a coun-
try that is doing virtually genocide 
today. 
If we look back to World War II when 
Eisenhower went to Auschwitz and the 
concentration camps and they saw the 
death and destruction and he said, 
‘‘Never again,’’ we as a nation have a 
responsibility to move everything that 
we can so that the Chinese Communist 
Party has to change their way. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

this great Nation. I am also proud to be 
a 
liberated 
Democrat, 
unbought, 
unbossed, speak truth to power, speak 
truth about power, a liberated Demo-
crat. And I rise tonight with a very 
special message at this time in the his-
tory of our country. 
We find ourselves now in a state of 
fear. Unfortunately, too much of what 
we have based our response on to the 
novel coronavirus has been fear, not 
facts. We should act on facts, not fear. 
My hope is that after I say a few words 
tonight, I will at least cause some per-
sons to rethink some of what they have 
already concluded. 
I am a person who believes that there 
is a philosophy, an adage, if you will, of 
live and let live. This is not my philos-
ophy, live and let live. It simply says: 
You go your way and live your life; I 
will go my way and live my life. 
If this philosophy prevailed, I would 
not be in the Congress of the United 
States of America because a good many 
people did not embrace live and let 
live. Dr. King did not embrace it. 
A good many people embrace a phi-
losophy that I now embrace, and that 
is live and help live. It is because of 
other people who made great sacrifices 
that I am able to stand here in the well 
of the Congress of the United States of 
America. It was a live and help live 
philosophy that made it possible for me 
to be here. There were persons who 
lived and some who died so that I 
would have this opportunity. 
I can bring Schwerner, Goodman, and 
Chaney to your attention. Schwerner 
and Goodman were not African Ameri-
cans, by the way. They lost their lives 
in the cause of freedom along with 
Goodman, who was an African Amer-
ican. They were trying to help some-
body. That was a live and help live phi-
losophy. 
There was John Shillady in Austin, 
Texas, an NAACP fieldworker, who was 
beaten by a mob. He was trying to help 
Black people. 
In a sense, there is a debt that I owe, 
and whenever I have the opportunity, I 
try to repay it. So tonight, with our 
country in this state of fear, I would 
like to ask some things of people and 
share some thoughts. 
The first thing that I want to address 
is what we expect from others. 
We now expect others who are sick to 
stay home. If you are sick and you 
think that you have a virus and you 
are concerned, we want you to stay 
home. Of course, see your physician, 
get an opinion from your physician, 
but if you are ill and you may be con-
tagious, we believe that you should 
stay home. 
That is what we are saying to people 
across the length and breadth of the 
country. We believe that this is a patri-
otic thing to do, to stay home. Do what 
you can from home. Work from home. 
Well, that can work for a lot of peo-
ple. It can work for Members of Con-
gress because we will be paid if we 
work from home. We will be paid, and 
we will be appreciated for staying 
home because we don’t want to spread 
an illness from one person to another 
by being in the workplace. That works 
quite well for Members of Congress. 
But what about the person who 
works for minimum wage? $7.25 an 
hour is still the minimum wage, the 
Federal minimum wage in this coun-
try. A good many places pay more than 
$7.25 an hour, but it is the Federal 
standard for the minimum wage. 
$7.25 an hour, that is not a lot of 
money for most of the people who work 
here, but to a good many people it is 
the means by which they maintain 
their dignity and keep food, clothing, 
and shelter for themselves and others. 
A good many of them are not in jobs 
that will pay them if they stay home. 
They are being patriotic Americans. 
They are doing what we are asking, but 
they won’t get paid. They have to 
make a choice: Do they stay home and 
do that which we deem to be prudent 
and necessary, or do they come to work 
so that they will be able to put food on 
the table, so that they will have the 
shelter necessary to protect them from 
the environment? Will they have the 
necessary clothing so that they may 
continue to traverse through the ele-
ments? 
But even at $7.25 an hour, there is an-
other case to be made, because some 
workers make less than the minimum 
wage of $7.25 an hour. These are the 
persons who work and they receive 
tips. They make $2.13 an hour. We ex-
pect them to stay home if they are 
sick. 
Many of them work in the food serv-
ice industry. They will serve our food. 
We want them to stay home if they are 
ill because we don’t want them to con-
taminate the food. But these persons 
who serve our food, $2.13 an hour, patri-
otic Americans, if they stay home and 
they are not paid, they have a choice: 
Do they stay home or do they come to 
work ill? 
I say to the employers: Please give 
consideration to your minimum wage 
workers, $7.25 an hour. Perhaps it is $15 
an hour. Give some consideration to 
them. And especially those who are 
working for $2.13 an hour. Give them 
some consideration. Help them through 
this time of crisis, because they are 
helping us through this time of crisis. 
They are there for us by staying 
home. They are doing the patriotic 
thing. We should do the patriotic thing 
and give them some consideration. 
I plan to support legislation, hope-
fully, that will emanate from this 
House that would give persons some 
amount of money. 
b 1845 
I think that we are at a point in our 
history when people who are going to 
have to stay at home are going to have 
to be accorded some sort of emolument 
because we don’t want them to come to 
work and contaminate others. We don’t 
expect them to do that which we would 
deem to be unpatriotic, so we have to 
help them. 
I heard a person this morning talk 
about $1,000 for persons who need help 
or $1,000 to persons in general, some 
amount. I am not sure what the exact 
amount should be, but I do know we 
have to give some consideration to per-
sons who are working for minimum 
wages and especially persons who are 
working for $2.13 an hour, for tips. 
There are those who contend that if 
you are working for $2.13 an hour, you 
will get a lot of money in those tips, 
and you will be able to do what some 
will say, that ‘‘I did.’’ That is not me 
saying the ‘‘I,’’ but I am now speaking 
the words of others. They will say: ‘‘I 
was able to work my way through col-
lege on tips.’’ Well, good for you. A 
good many others are not able to do 
such. A good many others are barely 
getting by on $2.13 an hour. 
I talk to people when I eat at these 
various cafeterias, and I have spoken 
to people who work in cafeterias in 
Houston, Texas, who tell me that they 
have gone home and made not more 
than $2.13 for each of the hours. They 
didn’t get any tips. There are days 
when they get no tips. 
I would hope that they would get an 
abundance of tips, but the truth is, 
there are days when they do not. And 
they deserve some help because they 
are doing what we are asking when 
they stay at home. So, if they stay at 
home and don’t come to work, I would 
hope that we would give them some 
consideration. 
Live and help live. That is the philos-
ophy I embrace. That is the philosophy 
that will cause an employer to con-
clude that he or she, or the company, 
should help people who we are asking 
to stay at home. 
Live and help live, not live and let 
live: ‘‘I am going to live my life. You 
stay at home. Sorry. Can’t help you.’’ 
No, let’s help those persons who have 
to stay at home because they are ill 
and are wage earners. Live and help 
live. 
Live and help live is a philosophy 
that I think we should embrace when 
we speak of persons who are of dif-
ferent ethnicities. More specifically, 
now, I am going to talk about persons 
of Asian ancestry. 
I am standing here tonight to speak 
up on behalf of persons of Asian ances-
try, and I am going to speak on their 
behalf as it relates to the novel 
coronavirus because ugly things are 
happening to persons of Asian ances-
try. 
I am here because I want to live and 
help live. I want to help them through 
this time of crisis when they are hav-
ing to experience xenophobia and na-
tivism. 
I have here some examples of what 
persons of Asian ancestry are experi-
encing, and I am here to live and help 
them live. I believe that somebody 
helped me to get where I am, and I 
have a debt that I owe, that I pray that 
I will be able to repay. 
Tonight, I would call to everybody’s 
attention a person in New York, a

woman on a subway who was attacked 
by persons who said that she was dis-
eased. They used a word that I would 
not use—the b-word is what it is called 
in this forum tonight—because she had 
on a face mask. 
People have assumed that this is ben-
eficial. It may not be. Many sci-
entists—the persons who are supposed 
to know, the persons who deal with 
these things, who have studied these 
things—are saying to us that the mask 
doesn’t help people, in general. It does 
help the persons who are aiding and as-
sisting us, perhaps the physicians and 
nurses. 
Be that as it may, if a person chooses 
to wear the mask and happens to be of 
Asian ancestry, that person ought not 
be attacked, that person ought not be 
spoken to in harsh language. 
People have a right in this country 
to wear the type of face gear that they 
choose. If they choose to wear a mask, 
so be it. 
We ought to respect people and not 
assume things and say things about 
them because of their ethnicity, be-
cause of their ancestry. 
Another example, a person who is of 
the Hmong ancestry was checking in at 
a hotel and was told that Asians are 
not welcome. That is not a live-and- 
help-live philosophy. That is a form of 
nativism and xenophobia that is invid-
ious, that is harmful to our society and 
harmful to this person trying to check 
into a hotel. 
I remember a time in this country 
when there were certain places that I 
could not check into simply because of 
the hue of my skin. I was not allowed. 
There 
were 
signs 
that 
said: 
‘‘No 
coloreds allowed.’’ Those were the po-
lite signs. There were some that had 
words that I will not repeat. 
But I remember this. And when I re-
member this, I relate to persons of 
Asian ancestry told that they can’t 
come into a given business place sim-
ply because of who they are. 
I am here because I believe in live 
and help live, and I want to help them 
through this time of crisis. 
In California, a 16-year-old high 
school student was sent to the emer-
gency room after being attacked by 
bullies who accused him of having the 
coronavirus simply because of his eth-
nicity. 
I have been attacked in my life, 
chased because of my ethnicity. I re-
flect on this, and it causes me to un-
derstand the plight of this person. 
I stand here tonight to speak up, to 
speak on behalf of people of Asian an-
cestry who are being assaulted, who 
are being accused, who are being denied 
simply because of who they are. 
I have an indication that even just 
looking Asian has been enough to in-
cite attackers, to hurl insults and ac-
cuse individuals of being disease car-
riers. 
Friends, this is a time for us to band 
together and come together as a Na-
tion. This is not a time for us to en-
gage in this sort of phobia, this xeno-
phobia, this nativism. This is not the 
time. 
This disease is not something that is 
related to any ethnicity. It is not re-
lated to any party. It doesn’t assault or 
attack Republicans or Democrats be-
cause they happen to be of a certain 
party. It doesn’t matter what your gen-
der is. 
This disease attacks you because you 
are a human being and because you 
have been exposed to it in such a way 
as to allow it to enter your body. 
We ought to see each other now as 
people of one race, the human race. We 
ought to see each other as people who 
we should help live. 
We should embrace the philosophy of 
live and help live. Help the minimum 
wage worker. Help those who are not as 
fortunate as we are. Help those who 
may not be of the same hue as you. 
Help those who have been accused and 
attacked. This is a time for us to send 
a message that we won’t tolerate it. 
I am here because I believe that 
Asian Americans, those of Asian ances-
try, should not have to defend them-
selves by themselves. 
I think that it is important for per-
sons who are not of Asian ancestry to 
send a message that we stand with 
them, 
and 
we 
stand 
against 
the 
Islamophobia that might ensue, the 
homophobia, all the various invidious 
phobias that can ensue from persons 
deciding that they are going to attack 
people because they are different. 
I have moved on from the Asian an-
cestry now to persons who are dif-
ferent. In this country, we ought not 
attack people simply because they are 
different. 
I believe that the differences that we 
have can make a difference in the cul-
ture, and it makes us richer for having 
these various differences. They are 
good for the country. 
Please, let us send a message that we 
will not tolerate persons being as-
saulted because of who they are, that 
we will not tolerate persons being de-
nied the opportunity to have access to 
various places within our society that 
we ordinarily would have access to 
simply because we happen to have the 
bill of fare. If we can pay our way in, 
pay for the hotel room, then I think we 
ought to allow people to have access. 
More important than all of these, I 
think that it is important for us to 
treat each other with dignity and re-
spect simply because we are people of 
the same creator. That creator, I be-
lieve, expects us to treat each other 
the same, regardless of our hues, re-
gardless of our various differences. 
This is an opportunity for us to pull 
together. I believe that this is a great 
adversity, but I also believe that it pro-
vides us a great opportunity to come 
together and stand up for each other. 
Let us live and help live. Let us not 
live and let live, simply leave people to 
find their way as best they can. 
Let’s help people through life. I am 
here because somebody helped me, and 
I want to be there to help others. 
I promise that I will do what I can to 
be of service to man, to humans, more 
specifically, to men and women in this 
society. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
f 
PUTTING ECONOMIC REPORTS IN 
CONTEXT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman 
from 
Arizona 
(Mr. 
SCHWEIKERT) for 30 minutes. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Madam Speaker, 
we try to come here every week to do 
sort of a combination of economic re-
ports and what we believe is a solution 
to long-term debt. 
Often, we sort of get a little, shall we 
say, technical, if not a bit geeky. But, 
tonight, I am going to try to do a little 
bit of that but also try to put it in con-
text to where I think we are. 
We in the Joint Economic Com-
mittee, and also even some of the staff 
from the Ways and Means Committee— 
and bless their souls for tolerating my 
questions. They have been very helpful, 
but there is still a lot of things we 
don’t know. But I want to start off 
with encouragement. 
About 20 minutes ago, I got off the 
phone with my father. My father is in 
his mid-eighties, still doing pretty darn 
well but still has some health issues. 
How do you turn to a family member 
like that—he is blessed to live in 
Scottsdale, Arizona, which is just a 
beautiful, beautiful place—and say, 
‘‘Father, for the next few weeks, you 
may want to not go to the different ac-
tivities,’’ which I know he loves, the 
art shows, the art walks, and all of 
these other things that are activities 
in our community. 
For the next few weeks, because of 
the things we are learning about the 
coronavirus, the populations that ap-
pear to be most at risk are those with 
a series of health issues. Do you have 
heart issues? Do you have diabetes? Do 
you have lung issues? Particularly, are 
you in your seventies or, in my father’s 
case, mid-eighties? 
Sort of the moral outreach I am 
going to ask everyone to think about is 
my call to him: ‘‘Hey, we have family 
in the neighborhood. If we can convince 
you to maybe spend a little bit more 
time around the house and avoid 
crowds and some of your activities, we 
will be happy to make sure food and 
things are dropped off at the house. If 
you need your pharmaceuticals picked 
up, we will be happy to go out and do 
that. We will try to be good family and 
be supportive.’’ 
Why don’t we take that same con-
cept, as both Democrats and Repub-
licans, and say to the VFW, the Legion, 
my Knights of Columbus club, or some 
of the other things in our community: 
Are you reaching out to the seniors in 
your community? 
b 1900 
Are you reaching out to those who 
may have certain health issues?

March 11, 2020 
If they are making the decision to 
follow what our county and State 
health departments are suggesting, 
what the CDC, HHS, and the others are 
suggesting, that, if you are in those 
more statistically vulnerable popu-
lations, you are going to stay home, 
avoid the crowds, those things, at least 
for a few weeks, what do we as a com-
munity do? What do those organiza-
tions do to reach out to their friends 
and their members and let them know 
they are loved and let them know we 
care, but also provide a little bit of 
that human contact, even if it is 
through the phone, even if it is through 
FaceTime. 
We were having the conversation of 
putting my little daughter a little 
more so he could FaceTime and have 
that contact with his granddaughter, 
but also picking up the food, the phar-
maceuticals, and other things so that 
we don’t create a situation where we 
take a vulnerable population and make 
them isolated from everyone else; so 
just a little moment of kindness, a lit-
tle moment of thought. 
If it is our grandparents or the friend 
from over at the VFW and they happen 
to be in those age brackets, they have 
what 
they 
call 
morbidity, 
comorbidities—and 
I 
always 
mis-
pronounce that, so forgive me—what do 
we as a community do to try to actu-
ally reach out and be supportive and be 
helpful? 
These are the sorts of things that 
those of us who are Members of Con-
gress go to, all these briefings. We hear 
all the statistics. We are moving 
money around. We are trying to get the 
manufacturing and testing of all these 
things where they need to go. And a lot 
of good things are happening. 
We know there are a lot of really 
smart people going as fast as they can, 
but now is the moment also for a lot of 
us in our communities to reach out and 
say: Look, the experts are saying, at 
least for the next few weeks, maybe the 
best thing is, if you are in that defined 
vulnerable population, stay home. 
How do we, as their friends and 
neighbors, make sure that they are not 
feeling locked away and isolated, that 
they are still loved and they are still 
part of our community? It is also our 
moral obligation to reach out and help 
our neighbors, bringing things to their 
doorstep. 
So, actually, what I am calling for— 
that is not Republican or Democrat; it 
is actually being human—is that idea 
of let’s make that happen. 
This evening I am going to do a tele-
phone townhall in our district. That is 
actually going to be one of the themes. 
We have already been on the phone 
reaching out to a number of the vet-
erans service organizations because we 
know, in a lot of their organizations, 
their mean ages are much, much older. 
So how do we get the younger vet-
erans now to actually be that contact 
with the world for those older veterans 
who may be choosing to isolate for a 
little bit? 
Madam Speaker, math is math. We 
see the data that so many who are 
young seem to be doing just great. 
Someone like myself, I am a fairly se-
vere asthmatic. I worry a little bit. But 
we are washing our hands, and we are 
taking the basic precautions you would 
take during any severe flu season. 
We actually now have a little timer 
in our office, and every couple of hours, 
we are washing the doorknobs and 
doing things like that. It is a little 
compulsive, but it is the right thing to 
do. 
So I just ask all of us, don’t be 
macabre, don’t be looking down. This 
is just part of life. But let’s treat it 
like adults. Let’s respect the profes-
sionals and their talents and the infor-
mation they are providing us and let’s 
work through this. Let’s do the right 
things. But also, let’s not isolate those 
populations we are being told are vul-
nerable. 
On one hand, we are saying: You real-
ly should stay out of crowds, stay out 
of these things for a few weeks. We 
have the moral obligation to make 
them know they are still loved and 
cared for. 
All right. A couple of things I do 
want to go through because we are try-
ing to get our head around what is hap-
pening economically. 
The fact of the matter is we just 
don’t know yet. We don’t have enough 
inbound data. I can give you some 
great data where we were a week ago. 
Has that changed? I promise you it has 
changed. But how much? 
The good news is we went into this 
March actually surprisingly economi-
cally healthy. Do you remember last 
Friday, the jobs report number? 
Now, remember, that jobs report 
number is looking back over the last 
month and working out particularly 
over the last week and the hires. But 
when you are gaining over 273,000 new 
jobs, Madam Speaker, that is pretty 
amazing, particularly where we were in 
the cycle. 
Forgive me for reaching back here. I 
hope I am not breaking a protocol, but 
I actually subscribe to an app called 
GDP Now. It is the Atlanta Fed’s cal-
culator. 
On March 6—that is the last update— 
they were at 3.1 percent GDP for this 
quarter. That is wonderful. 
Do I think we are going to end up 
there? Probably not. But it at least 
lets you know there was something 
really, really positive happening in the 
economy. 
When you start seeing numbers like 
this where we were hitting 3.5 percent 
unemployment—and I am going to 
touch on that just because I am fas-
cinated with labor force participation 
and what that means to economic 
growth, but also what it means to the 
numbers of people in our community 
who are choosing to come back into 
the labor force, come back to work. 
These are people who quit. There are 
fancy economic terms of the margin-
ally detached, but from a societal 
standpoint 
and 
from 
an 
economic 
standpoint, when those who are not 
looking all of a sudden start popping 
up in the data as coming back into the 
labor force, these are wonderful things. 
We were clicking along pretty darn 
well. 
When you start looking at this Feb-
ruary jobs report, we, as all Americans, 
should have been really happy with the 
economic robustness and stability. 
I am also going to show another 
board and demonstrate how we are also 
the engine that is basically saving the 
rest of the world economically. We are 
pulling the rest of the world along 
where, just a few years ago, 3 years 
ago, the rest of the world was actually 
moving up and they were sort of pull-
ing us along. Now that is somewhat re-
versed. 
You always have to put that in con-
text, Madam Speaker, because it gives 
you a sense of how strong the last cou-
ple years have been economically, par-
ticularly for labor markets. 
I have been behind this mike a dozen 
times showing the wage charts and the 
miracle that has really happened the 
last couple years for the working poor. 
It is a certain societal cruelty we 
have had for the last couple decades of 
our brothers and sisters who didn’t 
have particular skills or may not have 
finished high school, the really smart 
economists were functionally writing 
them off. They were going to be part of 
the permanent underclass. 
In many ways, if you sort of step 
back, there is a level of cruelty in just 
taking any American and saying: You 
don’t have certain things we think the 
economy is going to look for. We are 
writing you off. 
One of the great miracles we have 
had in the last couple years is that 
population, that bottom 10 percent of 
income earners—we refer to them as 
the working poor because they often 
have very moderate to low to none in 
the way of skills—their wages have ac-
tually been going up the fastest, double 
the mean of everyone else. 
So part of our theme is also growth is 
moral. You can see it in society in how 
many people who have had a pretty 
rough decade seem to have come back 
the last couple of years. 
But now we are going to have to face 
the issues of what do the next couple 
months look like with the coronavirus, 
what sort of disruption, what do we do 
as a body to maximize economic sta-
bility, also be rational, and then get 
back to the pattern that actually was 
helping so many Americans start to 
have these opportunities. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
hopefully, 
that 
doesn’t become partisan. Hopefully, 
that is just math and smart people 
coming up with ways, because those 
policies actually affect people’s lives. 
That is the decision whether you can 
buy that new vehicle or buy a house or 
some of these other opportunities out 
there. 
This slide is one we have been work-
ing on as a concept. It is a little noisy,

and these are really hard types of 
charts to read and look at, but it is 
really important. 
We had lots of smart people a couple 
years ago basically saying that, as we 
are getting older as a society, we are 
never getting back to those days of the 
mid-1960s and labor force participation. 
It is just not going to happen. 
Then we started to break apart some 
of the numbers, and we found this real-
ly interesting thing out there: We 
have, functionally, millions of Ameri-
cans who were not looking—they basi-
cally had quit in previous years—who 
suddenly are coming back into the 
labor force. 
So this is a slide of the share of 
newly employed from outside the labor 
force. So these are folks we don’t con-
sider traditionally as, well, they are 
part of our unemployment statistics or 
they are part of the rolling—they are 
getting 
unemployment 
benefits, 
or 
they have been looking, or even outside 
the marginally attached population. 
These are, functionally, folks who were 
not even looking. 
What is stunning is you can see the 
wild ride we have had. Post the 2008 re-
cession, this population had just sort of 
detached. They were in the mid-fifties 
of looking at working, coming into the 
labor force. Today, this population is 
starting to approach the mid-seventies, 
and it has substantially happened in 
just the last couple of years. 
I want to argue that is a combination 
of lots of complex things, and it is 
something we don’t talk about enough. 
Because there has been wage growth, 
the value of their labor has gone up. 
You may actually get some things 
that are uncomfortable to talk about, 
Madam Speaker, and the numbers are 
difficult, so it is still theoretical. Some 
things have happened with immigra-
tion that have also made their labor, 
possibly, more valuable. 
The other thing also is that work has 
changed, where, if you or I went back 
10 or 15 years ago for parts of this popu-
lation, they are not picking up bags of 
concrete. Now their work has changed. 
Is that part of it? 
We have these fancy economists who 
come in and walk through all these dif-
ferent reasons, and we are trying to get 
our head around it, but the one thing 
we know is that there is something 
good happening in our society. 
How do we as policymakers, those of 
us on the more conservative side, our 
brothers and sisters who might be on 
the more liberal side, and some of the 
people in the middle who call them-
selves moderate, how do we actually 
come up with ways to keep these good 
things happening? How do you do that 
in a society right now where our poli-
tics are often so polarizing? 
I want to argue we actually have a 
moral obligation to figure out things 
that are working, figure out what is 
making them work, and do more of it. 
This is a slide I am just putting up 
because it rounds out a discussion we 
were having a couple of weeks ago 
about what is happening in the world. 
If you see the blue, Madam Speaker, 
that is the G–7. That actually has the 
United States in it. If you look at the 
orange, that is actually the G–7 with-
out the United States. So call it the G– 
6, I guess. The green is the United 
States. 
If we go back to the numbers that 
were coming out in 2017, you see the 
rest of the world through economic 
growth was very similar to the United 
States. They were helping us; we were 
helping them. But you can also see the 
last couple years the United States’ 
economic growth has dramatically sur-
passed the rest of the industrialized 
world, the big economies. 
There is this push-pull concept in 
economic growth. In the last couple 
years, we are basically—if you look at 
the last two sections of the graph, you 
start to understand that we are the en-
gine that functionally has been keep-
ing much of the rest of the world 
afloat. You can also see the incredible 
spike in growth and the continued 
growth post-tax reform. 
The fact of the matter is what we did 
in the U.S. tax reform and the eco-
nomic growth that it brought did 
things for the entire world. It is in the 
charts. It is in the data. 
The other thing I want to put up, and 
I try to put this up about once a month 
just because it is that continuing con-
versation that we often get lost in our 
rhetoric and we get a piece of rhetoric 
in our head, we get behind micro-
phones, we say it over and over and 
then, later on, find out that the math 
actually doesn’t match the rhetoric. 
This is actually what we call tax re-
ceipts. Many of you will think of it as 
revenues, but the proper term from the 
IRS and those of us on the Ways and 
Means Committee is ‘‘receipts.’’ These 
are revenues as they are booked into 
Treasury. It is just really, really im-
portant to get your head around this. 
In 2017, ‘18, and ‘19, even though we 
are post-tax reform and we had lots of 
really smart people—Members of Con-
gress and economists—who were saying 
that this chart was going to crash this 
way, it didn’t. As a matter of fact, if 
you look at this chart, those are the 
highest receipts in U.S. history. 
b 1915 
So I beg of us—at some point those 
folks who will spend their time attack-
ing the tax reform—I understand it is 
an election year—attempt to tell the 
truth about the math. And the ulti-
mate test is: Are we getting the reve-
nues in or not? 
Now, the mix of the revenues has 
changed. Corporate taxes are down. In-
dividual taxes are way up, particularly 
payroll, because more Americans are 
working. But that was the idea. And it 
wasn’t just a Republican idea. If you 
actually go back during the Obama 
years, President Obama’s economic 
team actually recommended much of 
the same thing in corporate taxes. 
The difference is, it happened over 
here, so, therefore, it must be vilified, 
even though that is truly unfair. This 
has been an economic concept for 
years. We finally got it delivered, and 
it is working. 
This is the chart that I will often get 
the most phone calls about, and it is 
getting a little dated. We need to up-
date it. The chart is not adjusted with 
constant dollars. That means over the 
next 30 years—this is a 30-year chart— 
you would probably reduce the num-
bers by a third, and that just means ad-
justing the purchasing power of today’s 
dollar for an inflated dollar in the fu-
ture. 
The chart is very, very simple, 
though. And it is one where I am trying 
to communicate the future debt—and 
it is overwhelming—that is coming is 
demographics. It is those of us who are 
baby boomers; we are getting older. We 
have earned benefits. We have earned 
Social Security. We have earned Medi-
care. We just have a small problem. We 
didn’t set aside the actual cash. 
So here is a simple thought experi-
ment with this chart: 
This is Social Security. This is Medi-
care. If we would pull those out, 30 
years from now—actually now, it is 
like 28 years—we would have $23 tril-
lion in the bank. But if we roll Social 
Security and Medicare back in, Social 
Security and Medicare’s shortfall is 
$103 trillion at the end of that 30 years, 
meaning when you add these two to-
gether, you are functionally at an $80 
trillion debt. 
And what is really hard for this body 
to talk about is saying we have made 
promises, we are going to have to find 
a way to keep them. So every week we 
try to come here and say, ‘‘there is a 
way to do that.’’ But you have to be 
willing to engage in something that 
sometimes is disharmonious around 
here, and sometimes just a little com-
plicated. Because let’s face it, as a 
body, we have difficulty doing one 
major concept, and our argument is 
you need to do dozens of things, and we 
almost need to do all of them imme-
diately. 
And what is so frustrating and heart-
breaking is almost all of these turn 
partisan. And the ones that are tech-
nology we will find a way to make par-
tisan and they are all absolutely nec-
essary to create the economic growth, 
to 
create 
the 
price 
disruption 
in 
healthcare. As you just saw, most of 
that $80 trillion debt at the end of that 
30 years is Medicare. 
I use this slide over and over, but we 
are trying to make an argument. A tax 
code, a regulatory code, an immigra-
tion code that maximizes economic ex-
pansion, incentives to be in the labor 
force. 
And think about that. We right now 
still have a problem with millennial 
males coming into the labor force. We 
have had a miracle in the last 20 
months of millennial females coming 
back in. They are coming in like crazy. 
We still have a problem with millen-
nial men.

How about people who are older? Can 
you design incentives in the Social Se-
curity, Medicare, and other benefits to 
stay or come back into the labor force 
with their talents? 
The other one is: Are we willing to 
actually 
unleash 
technology? 
And 
these are the presentations I have en-
joyed the most. Just last week, I was 
here on the floor showing things, tech-
nology-wise, that could crash the price 
of healthcare. We actually brought in a 
slide a couple of weeks ago saying 
there was a major success in being able 
to put in T-cells that grew pancreatic 
cells, and those pancreatic cells in a 
mouse looked like they were growing 
insulin. 
Now, when you go from a mouse ex-
periment to humans, it is a decade. But 
the previous slide, you saw the math 
for Medicare—and Medicare is the key 
driver of U.S. debt in the future—30 
percent of Medicare’s debt is just dia-
betes. As a body, let’s make sure the 
resources, the talents, the mechanisms, 
the encouragement, all the things we 
can do to create those disruptions is 
not a cure for something like diabetes 
because it is good policy. It is the 
moral, ethical thing to do, and it is 
also an amazing change in U.S. debt if 
you just cured diabetes. 
Now diabetes, it turns out, is com-
plicated. There are autoimmune issues. 
There are lifestyle issues. There is 1 
and 2. It is complicated. But that is the 
way we need to be thinking around 
here if we are going to have an impact. 
Well, it turns out in that same dis-
cussion of technology, a couple of years 
ago, I became fascinated with the con-
cept of a universal flu vaccine. And the 
Gates Foundation, I believe, has moved 
$60 million there. I believe Congress, a 
couple of years ago, we started to move 
some lines of research money into that 
concept. Now, we are told it is com-
plicated, but we may be a couple of 
years away from actually having a uni-
versal flu vaccine. 
So think about the societal economic 
disruption we believe we are stepping 
into right now. Now, it is not going to 
last forever, but it will last for a little 
while. Just that technology of some-
thing like a universal flu vaccine may 
become the solution that this type of 
viral—this economic disruption, soci-
etal health disruption, never happens 
again. 
My argument is, I think, fairly ele-
gant. We need to do all these growth 
and cost and technology disruptions. 
And if we do them, I believe we can 
make an argument that the ability to 
keep promises—our promises for Social 
Security, our promises for Medicare— 
there is a path. It is just uncomfortable 
to talk about these things, because 
when you use the word ‘‘disruption,’’ 
that often means someone’s business 
model, someone’s current technology. 
We have used the example dozens of 
time here on the floor: ‘‘How many of 
you went to Blockbuster Video last 
weekend?’’ Of course not. The tech-
nology changed. Now, you hit a button 
at home and you stream your enter-
tainment. 
We need to make sure that those 
types of disruptions are now happening 
in environment and healthcare tech-
nology, and who knows what else. We 
also see some of them even now coming 
in energy generation. 
So there is a path. We don’t have to 
be dour as we think about the future of 
the United States. It is actually incred-
ibly optimistic. But to make the opti-
mism a reality, this body needs to stop 
being dysfunctional. We cannot spend 
another year of our lives like we did 
last year, functionally accomplishing 
nothing of value. We are better than 
that. We know there is a path. We ac-
tually know the math. Now, let’s just 
get our act together. 
f 
OUR IMMIGRATION ISSUES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman 
from 
Wisconsin 
(Mr. 
GROTHMAN) for 30 minutes. 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
think one more time we have to ad-
dress what I feel 10 years from today 
will be viewed as the most significant 
issue that our Congress has to deal 
with, and that is immigration. 
Madam Speaker, I want to mention 
the issue one more time, because a cou-
ple of weeks ago, I again went to the 
Arizona border to see what is going on, 
and I have since talked to a leader of 
the union of the Border Patrol agents. 
I say this is the most important issue 
because our immigrants are going to 
determine where America is or what 
America is like 10 or 20 years from 
now. Donald Trump has made a lot of 
progress on the border, but we have to 
remember all of this progress—or al-
most all of this progress—is solely 
caused by our President. 
First 
of 
all, 
let’s 
recount 
the 
progress. He has begun to build the 
wall. When I was down in Arizona, I 
saw 12 miles of the wall along the Ari-
zona border. While it is possible to get 
over the wall, it is very difficult. 
The wall is 30-feet high. It is very dif-
ficult, and people, I think, only in the 
best of physical shape can get 30 feet 
up. There is sometimes concertina wire 
at the top, which causes some people, 
at least in Nogales, to get stuck at the 
top, and it is very difficult to get back 
down. So that is some progress. 
We also have made progress, and we 
have reached agreement with Mexico, 
saying ‘‘if you are coming here for asy-
lum, you have to be held on the Mexi-
can side of the border pending a hear-
ing.’’ Not only does this cause people 
not to be able to come across imme-
diately but discourages people from 
Central America or Africa or South 
America from coming here in the first 
place. 
Because 
prior 
to 
President 
Trump becoming President or reaching 
an agreement with the Mexican Gov-
ernment, people would come here, say 
they were seeking asylum, and they 
would be placed somewhere in the 
United States and never show up at the 
hearing anyway. Therefore, this is the 
way we have many people who are 
going to wind up living in America. 
And the third thing President Trump 
has done, is he has put in a public 
charge rule covering people coming 
here legally, saying, ‘‘we do not want 
you in this country if you are going to 
wind up taking advantage of our public 
benefits.’’ It is not too strict of a law. 
He allows people to stay for 1 or 2 
months, if they are on food stamps dur-
ing that period of time—but, obviously, 
given that we can pick whoever we 
want around the world, we do not—our 
country right now, which is running a 
trillion-dollar deficit—want to take 
more people who are taking money out 
of this system rather than putting 
money in this system. 
So the question is: What should Con-
gress do now that we have kind of 
begun to take control of our borders? 
The first thing we have to do is we 
have to permanently change our asy-
lum laws so that in the future when 
people come here, we know we are deal-
ing with people who genuinely have to 
seek asylum. We should not be tak-
ing—per President Trump—people who 
have to cross several countries to get 
here. 
If you are in Venezuela, and you are 
genuinely at risk for your life, what 
would you do? You would move to Co-
lombia. You would move to Panama. 
You would move to Costa Rica. You 
won’t go through six or seven countries 
to get to the United States. 
Secondly, we have to hire more peo-
ple at the border. As we put up our 
wall, and as we hold people south of the 
border who are seeking asylum, more 
people will try to sneak in the country. 
As more people try to sneak in the 
country, it is more important that we 
have border patrol agents. 
Over time, the drug cartels, which 
run the southern border, become more 
and more sophisticated. They have 
spotters along the border. And, quite 
frankly, they have equipment that is 
superior sometimes to the equipment 
our own Border Patrol has. 
As long as we continue to allow this 
to happen, the cartels south of the bor-
der break up families. And they break 
up families by using minors, 16-, 15-, 14- 
year-olds to smuggle drugs across the 
border. They use these young people as 
spotters, knowing full well that if they 
are caught, they will not wind up in 
American jails but just turned around 
and sent back south of the border 
again. 
Another thing that we have to look 
at is we should pass a bill, which I have 
introduced in the past, saying no pub-
lic benefits for people who are not 
American citizens. Historically, in this 
country, when people come here, many 
return to their country of origin. The 
reason they return to their country of 
origin is they are not able to find work 
here. 
We ought to across-the-board say, 
‘‘no public benefits for people who are

not citizens.’’ As far as the few situa-
tions in which help is needed, that can 
always be handled by the many gen-
erous Americans who do feel these peo-
ple should stay in the country, but it 
should not be a guaranteed right. 
The next thing we have to do—as 
long as people are coming into our 
country—is get rid of the rule, which is 
the birthright citizenship rule. Among 
westernized countries, United States 
and Canada are the only two countries 
who allow someone to become a citizen 
if you are born in the country. There is 
a reason other nations don’t do this. 
We want to properly vet the new fam-
ilies that are coming here. If we say 
that anybody who has a child in the 
United States becomes a citizen, the 
parents will follow, and our new gen-
erations will not be picked by appro-
priately vetting the future immigrants. 
They will be picked by whoever hap-
pens to come here. 
Our intent has never been that if you 
get a green card, that if you are here 
on a student visa—much less sneak 
into the country illegally—that your 
children become citizens. 
I think it is important that we deal 
with these issues promptly. And I say 
that because we will go back to the 
days of 140,000 people being appre-
hended at the border if we have a Presi-
dent who doesn’t go ahead with these 
three 
commonsense 
measures 
that 
President Trump has taken time to 
deal with. 
I implore the press to report any 
progress on these issues, and to sum-
marize again and again for the Amer-
ican public the progress that is made 
by President Trump and what would 
happen 
if 
President 
Trump 
would 
leave. It would result in a permanent 
change of America. 
Again, we want immigrants. Presi-
dent Trump has increased the number 
of people being legally sworn in this 
country over the last few years, but we 
have to pick our immigrants. And if we 
do not pick our immigrants, we are 
going to wind up permanently chang-
ing an America in which we do not 
like.

Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 11, 2020 
No. 47 
Senate 
The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Arise, O Judge of the Earth, and 
bring healing and help to our Nation 
and world. We praise You that Your 
plans succeed and Your precepts are 
sure. 
Lord, You know our thoughts before 
we think them. Encourage our law-
makers to do Your will. Give them the 
wisdom to totally depend upon Your 
unfailing love, remembering that un-
less You help them, they labor in vain. 
Lord, when doubts fill their minds, 
provide them with the renewed hope in 
the ultimate triumph of Your purposes. 
We pray in Your strong Name. Amen.

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
LOEFFLER). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 
minute in morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
LITHUANIA 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
30 years ago today, the freely elected 
Parliament of Lithuania declared the 
restoration of that country’s independ-
ence. Lithuania’s brave actions began 
the breakup of the Soviet Union, some-
thing all freedom-loving Americans 
ought to be celebrating. 
The modern Republic of Lithuania is 
102 years old as of last month, and the 
United States has maintained contin-
uous diplomatic relations with Lith-
uania since 1992—in other words, since 
the period of time that the Soviet 
Union had jurisdiction over it. In these 
last 30 years, since the return of free-
dom, we have seen the partnership be-
tween 
our 
two 
countries 
become 
stronger than ever. 
Lithuania is a close U.S. ally, a bea-
con of Western values, and very much 
on the frontlines of freedom. I thank 
Lithuania for its friendship, for its im-
portant contributions to our North At-
lantic Treaty Organization alliance, 
and for its vocal defense of our shared 
values. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
yesterday President Trump visited the 
Capitol to discuss the ongoing efforts 
to fight the new coronavirus and its 
growing footprint here in the United 
States. 
As Vice President PENCE, Dr. An-
thony Fauci, and the other administra-
tion experts related in their briefing 
yesterday, we should expect a number 
of cases to continue to climb through-
out our country. Fortunately, our Na-
tion was rated the best prepared in the 
world for this kind of outbreak, and we 
are continuing to scale up our response 
every day. 
My home State of Kentucky cur-
rently has eight confirmed cases. I ap-
plaud the efforts of State and local 
leaders who are working together with 
Federal officials to proceed carefully 
and intelligently. 
Our public health experts are com-
piling the best guidance for individ-
uals, families, businesses, schools, and 
healthcare professionals in one place, 
and www.coronavirus.gov is the place 
to go. I encourage every American to 
read through the information, particu-
larly 
anyone 
whose 
personal 
cir-
cumstances 
make 
additional 
pre-
cautions a wise idea. 
President Trump and Senators also 
discussed potential policies to soften 
the economic impact of the virus. Over 
the last 3 years, we have built a his-
torically strong economy of American 
workers and middle-class families. We 
should take sensible steps to help that 
momentum continue, notwithstanding 
this new challenge. 
I am glad the Secretary of the Treas-
ury and the Speaker of the House are 
engaging in direct bipartisan talks on 
this subject. Congress has already pro-
vided billions in new funding to Fed-
eral, State, and local health leaders. I 
hope we can bring the same bipartisan 
energy to any steps that prove nec-
essary to support our strong U.S. econ-
omy. 
Now, it has been sad but not sur-
prising 
to 
see 
some 
of 
President 
Trump’s Democratic critics here in 
Washington fall back on the same old 
predictable partisan attacks, even at a 
time like this, but across the country, 
where leaders are working together on 
the frontlines, we have seen something 
different. I want to commend the 
Democratic Governor of California, 
who stated on Monday that he had been 
in close touch with the President and 
Vice President and appreciated their 
attention and support. 
Here is what he said: 
He said everything I could have hoped for. 
. . . We had a very long conversation, and

every single thing he said, they followed 
through on. 
That is the Governor of California 
talking about the Republican President 
of the United States. He praised the ad-
ministration’s work on this and said: 
‘‘It starts at the top.’’ 
So, clearly, this does not have to be 
a time for partisan bickering. The 
American people know that. The lead-
ers around the country know that. I 
hope our Democratic colleagues here in 
Washington understand the American 
people expect us to be working to-
gether on this problem. 
f 
ELECTION SECURITY 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
now on another matter, yesterday, 
both the House and Senate were briefed 
by top intelligence community officials 
on the state of ongoing efforts to pro-
tect the security of American elec-
tions. 
I was glad that so many Members 
took the chance to hear directly from 
the experts. This issue is very impor-
tant, and it is bad for our democracy 
that some have sought to politicize it. 
All of us should acknowledge the 
threat, and all of us should applaud the 
unprecedented step this administration 
has taken to protect against it. These 
significant efforts undertaken by the 
administration and funded by the Con-
gress are actually working. 
Since 2017, the hundreds of millions 
of dollars we have directed to help 
State and local election officials rein-
force their systems have been finding 
their mark. 
In all 50 States and across thousands 
of jurisdictions, new tools, more re-
sources, and greater coordination have 
our Nation’s defenses in a stronger 
place. This includes far greater coordi-
nation with the social media compa-
nies to combat foreign disinformation, 
as well as close collaboration between 
the Federal Government and State and 
local jurisdictions on protecting elec-
toral infrastructure. 
And to date, the intelligence commu-
nity reports they have not seen any 
foreign 
interference 
that 
aims 
to 
change vote tallies or prevent Ameri-
cans from voting. So the American peo-
ple are absolutely right to have con-
fidence in the integrity of our voting 
systems, and they actually do. 
As I mentioned yesterday, one new 
survey has found that more than 70 
percent—70 percent—of Americans are 
confident their State and local authori-
ties will oversee a fair and accurate 
election this November. That is 70 per-
cent of the American people who have 
confidence in the fairness of the elec-
tions this November. 
As an aside, this is worth remem-
bering as our Democratic colleagues 
try to claim that election security de-
mands things like an unprecedented 
Washington 
power 
grab 
over 
the 
nuanced details of how States and lo-
calities conduct elections or addressing 
things like campaign finance. These 
are longtime leftwing goals that have 
basically nothing whatsoever to do 
with the actual threats now before us. 
But the American people’s confidence 
in the key institutions of our democ-
racy does not mean they are compla-
cent; they aren’t. The same survey 
shows the American people understand 
full well that foreign adversaries like 
Russia want to divide our country and 
distort 
our 
discourse 
through 
disinformation. 
The intelligence community con-
firms that as well. Our intelligence ex-
perts have publicly assessed that Rus-
sia and other adversaries will continue 
looking for ways to warp our public de-
bate from overseas. 
We all need to be aware that our ad-
versaries seek to exploit the openness 
of our society to turn Americans 
against 
ourselves. 
Adversaries 
like 
Russia want to exacerbate social and 
political tensions in our country. They 
want to undermine our confidence in 
our own election and our democratic 
institutions. 
This 
is 
why 
I 
have 
stressed that politicians need to be 
careful not to take the bait. It is why 
the President signed an Executive 
order to enable sanctions against any 
person or any country that attempts to 
meddle in our elections. It is why this 
administration has created new proce-
dures for promptly notifying cam-
paigns that are targeted by foreign en-
tities, unlike—unlike—how the Obama 
administration hid the ball back in 
2016, and it is why the new, tough for-
eign policies of the last 3 years will 
continue to be essential. 
Narrow, tailored solutions are impor-
tant, but the best way for the United 
States to defend ourselves and our in-
terests against any malign behavior is 
to possess unquestionable strength and 
make it perfectly clear we are not in-
terested in being pushed around. 
I have been a Russia hawk for more 
than 30 years. I am on record from the 
late years of the Clinton administra-
tion warning Democrats not to be 
naive about a new President-elect by 
the name of Vladimir Putin, so I ap-
plaud 
this 
administration’s 
tough 
stance with Russia. And I am pleased 
that 
Democrats 
have 
stopped— 
stopped—mocking 
Republicans 
for 
being too tough on Russia and have 
come around to our point of view. 
We have come a long way since the 
passivity and the failures of the Obama 
administration back in 2016, but the 
work is not finished, and Senators are 
fooling themselves if they think this is 
just about Russia. 
We must stay vigilant—all of us; Fed-
eral leaders, State and local election 
officials, and every American citizen. 
Every one of us has a part to play in 
protecting our democracy.

CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, yes-
terday afternoon, South Dakota Gov-
ernor Kristi Noem notified me that 
multiple residents of South Dakota 
have 
tested 
positive 
for 
the 
coronavirus. While this is obviously 
something we had hoped to avoid, we 
knew this was a possibility, and South 
Dakota has spent weeks preparing to 
deal with an outbreak. 
Over the next few days, public health 
officials will be checking into where 
these individuals have been so that 
anyone with whom they came in con-
tact can be notified. My staff and I are 
working closely with the Governor and 
her team, and I will continue to care-
fully monitor the situation. 
At the Federal level, I am focused on 
making sure that State and local gov-
ernments have the resources they need 
to deal with the virus. Last week, I was 
proud to support bipartisan legislation 
committing 
significant 
Federal 
re-
sources to the coronavirus fight. 
I am praying for all of the South Da-
kotans who are affected by the virus, 
and I want to thank the healthcare 
workers who are on the frontlines of 
this fight. We are lucky to have you.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1679 
March 11, 2020 
piece of legislation that should have 
been able to advance in the Senate. It 
contains measures from more than 60 
Senators, and 90 Senators voted last 
week to begin debate on the bill. I am 
disappointed that we couldn’t maintain 
that bipartisan momentum and get 
this bill over the finish line. 
The United States is in a pretty good 
position when it comes to energy right 
now. Our energy supply is abundant, 
and energy prices are generally afford-
able. But we are in this position for a 
reason—because we took steps to in-
crease our domestic energy supply and 
lessen our dependence upon foreign oil. 
We can’t afford to become compla-
cent. If we want to keep American en-
ergy affordable and abundant, we need 
to make sure that we stay on the cut-
ting edge of energy innovation and con-
tinue to invest in our domestic energy 
supply, from oil and natural gas to re-
newable energy sources like hydro-
power and wind. We also need to make 
sure we stay on top of threats to our 
energy grid and our energy security. 
The American Energy Innovation Act 
is designed to help maintain American 
strength in the energy sector. It in-
vests in a wide range of clean energy 
technologies, from wind and solar to 
hydropower and geothermal. It focuses 
on improving research into carbon cap-
ture, and it directs the establishment 
of a research and development program 
to identify ways to use captured car-
bon. 
The bill also invests in advanced nu-
clear energy research so that we can 
regain our edge in the use of this clean 
energy technology, and it focuses on 
improving energy storage. Many mod-
ern 
clean 
energy 
technologies 
are 
intermittent or lack the reliability of 
traditional 
electric 
sources. 
The 
amount of energy produced from wind, 
for example, is dependent on the 
amount of wind on any given day, so it 
must be backed up by a traditional 
plant, often powered by natural gas. 
Creating new ways to store clean en-
ergy will allow us to increase our reli-
ance on renewable energy sources. 
Another area that needs to be ad-
dressed when it comes to renewable en-
ergy is recycling. Solar panels, wind 
turbine blades, and electric car bat-
teries are key components of clean en-
ergy production, but all of these com-
ponents eventually reach the end of 
their life. Both solar panels and wind 
turbine blades eventually have to be 
replaced, and car batteries eventually 
lose their ability to hold a full charge. 
The question becomes what to do 
with these components. Wind turbine 
blades can be well over 150 feet long 
and weigh somewhere around 15 tons. 
That takes a lot of room in a landfill. 
In the case of electric vehicle batteries, 
we are not just talking about filling up 
landfills. We are talking about poten-
tially hazardous waste if lithium or 
other materials leak from the battery. 
While recycling and reuse methods 
exist for clean energy components, 
much more work needs to be done to 
ensure that clean energy doesn’t even-
tually result in massive buildups in 
landfills. Since roughly a quarter of 
the net electricity generated in my 
home State of South Dakota comes 
from wind, I am particularly interested 
in what it would take to recycle or 
reuse the blades from wind turbines on 
a large scale. 
I am very pleased that my wind en-
ergy recycling amendment was in-
cluded in the chairman’s substitute 
amendment to the American Energy 
Innovation Act. My amendment would 
establish a competition to identify in-
novative uses for wind blades that have 
reached the end of their life, with a 
focus on uses that present the greatest 
potential for large-scale commercial 
deployment. 
With an estimated 32,000 wind blades 
likely to be removed from U.S. wind 
turbines in the next 4 years, it is past 
time to get American innovators fo-
cused on this problem. I appreciate 
Chairman MURKOWSKI’s interest in ad-
dressing this side of green energy and 
hope that we can continue this work. 
In addition to clean energy and inno-
vation, the American Energy Innova-
tion Act focuses on boosting the secu-
rity of our electric grid. It invests in 
cyber security and grid modernization 
and focuses on improving our domestic 
supply of some of the key elements and 
minerals that we rely on for manufac-
turing—everything 
from 
computer 
chips, to batteries, to defense applica-
tions. 
Right now, we have to import too 
much of these critical minerals from 
countries like China. For the sake of 
our national security, it is important 
that we find ways to identify supplies 
of these minerals here at home. 
Finally, the American Energy Inno-
vation Act invests in workforce devel-
opment. All of the innovative tech-
nologies in the world will not help us if 
we don’t have the skilled workers to 
operate 
and 
maintain 
these 
tech-
nologies. We need to ensure that, while 
we are investing in innovation, we are 
also investing in the energy workforce 
of the future. 
As I said, it is disappointing that the 
Senate wasn’t able to move forward on 
this bipartisan legislation. I hope we 
will be able to continue discussing this 
bill and the Senate will take it up 
again in the near future. 
The American Energy Innovation Act 
would promote clean energy develop-
ment, help maintain a strong domestic 
energy supply, increase the security of 
our energy grid, and invest in Amer-
ican workers. We need to get this legis-
lation across the finish line. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader is recognized. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
the United States has more than 1,000 
confirmed 
cases 
of 
COVID–19, 
the 
coronavirus. The actual number, how-
ever, could be much higher. We don’t 
truly 
know 
how 
many 
cases 
of 
coronavirus there are in the United 
States because our testing regime has 
been entirely inadequate. 
The CDC took weeks to develop test-
ing kits that worked properly, and the 
Federal Government was far too slow 
in allowing hospitals, medical labs, and 
public health clinics to conduct tests 
on their own. The New York Times this 
morning has a story about how doctors 
and clinicians in Washington State 
were forced to wait a period of weeks 
for samples of the coronavirus and ap-
proval to test patients for the virus, 
even after they had suspected cases. 
The virus was spreading in the United 
States for weeks, without our knowl-
edge, because we could not reliably test 
for it. 
Even now, the administration has 
been laggard about making sure that 
testing kits are available to all who 
need them, and the United States is 
trailing countries around the world in 
our testing capacity. We, who were 
supposed to have the greatest public 
health system in the world, are lagging 
behind many countries, and it is a mat-
ter of life and death. 
Last night, I spoke with the mayor of 
New Rochelle, NY, where multiple in-
fections 
have 
been 
confirmed 
and 
where residents are now living under a 
3-square-mile containment area. The 
mayor told me that despite the best ef-
forts of the State of New York—and 
they are doing a good job—there are 
not enough coronavirus testing kits for 
the community. I asked him what his 
major problem was. He said: Lack of 
testing kits, lack of testing. I fear that 
what is happening in New Rochelle will 
happen in cities and towns across the 
country. It is virtually certain that a 
limited 
quarantine 
or 
containment 
area will be imposed on other cities, 
like they were in New Rochelle, and we 
need to make sure the mistakes that 
have plagued the whole testing regime 
is not repeated when other cities have 
to be under some limited quarantine. 
Those cities have to able to get the 
tests and resources they need, and New 
Rochelle still isn’t getting them be-
cause of the Federal Government. 
I honestly don’t know why it has 
taken so long for the Trump adminis-
tration to get a handle on testing, 
which is the most powerful tool in 
helping us respond to the spread of the 
virus. I honestly don’t know why, after 
this issue with testing has been glaring 
and very public, the administration has 
still not announced anything resem-
bling a coherent plan to fix the prob-
lem. 
This morning, I am demanding that 
the Trump administration do five

things to improve the Nation’s ability 
to test for the coronavirus in the 
United States: 
One, expedite the approval of labs 
that are ready and willing to provide 
testing. Every lab that is able to pro-
vide testing should be up and running 
as soon as possible. 
Two, provide daily updates on the 
volume of tests, both available and ex-
pected, and set up a special office or 
bureau within HHS dedicated to man-
aging the acquisition and distribution 
tests. The conflicting reports and lack 
of information have left States unable 
to plan. 
Three, support the use of automated 
testing to increase the speed and vol-
ume with which testing is conducted. 
Four, ensure that patients who need 
tests face no out-of-pocket costs. The 
coverage requirements for testing are 
currently a patchwork of State execu-
tive orders and private company ac-
tions. We need Federal leadership. Hun-
dreds of millions of Americans do not 
know if they can access affordable test-
ing. 
And, five, ensure that COVID–19, 
coronavirus, hotlines are fully staffed 
and responsive to patients and pro-
viders who have questions and con-
cerns. 
Our top priority at the moment is to 
confront the spread of this disease 
head-on. The first is making sure com-
munities across the country have the 
testing capability and capacity that 
they need. 
The public also needs clear guidance 
from the Federal Government regard-
ing how to best avoid contracting this 
virus. It has been reported that Federal 
health 
officials 
recommended 
that 
older Americans refrain from air travel 
for this reason, but the White House 
overruled them. What exactly hap-
pened here? Were health officials over-
ruled for political reasons? What is the 
truth? And what is the recommenda-
tion of our Federal health experts 
going forward, most importantly? 
The coronavirus has also created tur-
bulence in our economy and disrupted 
daily life for many Americans. As I 
have said before, by far, the best way 
to respond to any adverse effects on 
our economy is to deal with the 
coronavirus itself. You treat the dis-
ease, not the symptoms. But even as 
we focus primarily on combating the 
spread of COVID–19, we should consider 
relief to American families and work-
ers who are impacted. 
Later this morning, I will join Sen-
ators MURRAY, BROWN, DURBIN, WYDEN, 
CARDIN, and others to announce a se-
ries of measures that Senate Demo-
crats believe we should take up to pro-
vide economic relief to working Ameri-
cans during the coronavirus outbreak. 
I will have more details at that time, 
at 11:30. But for now, I want to make 
one thing clear. When it comes to pro-
viding short-term economic relief, our 
priority should be the American peo-
ple, not corporations. 
That means targeted measures that 
give working families the flexibility 
and support they need during a medical 
emergency. That means money goes di-
rectly to the people and workers af-
fected and who need help, not money 
tossed out of an airplane and hope that 
some lands on the people who need the 
help. 
It does not mean bailing out the oil 
and gas industry, as the press reported 
was under consideration at the White 
House. It does not mean deregulating 
the banking industry, as another re-
port said was a part of the discussion 
at the White House. It does not mean 
another corporate tax cut. 
In the face of test shortages, growing 
cases, and lack of medical supplies, 
President Trump seems more inter-
ested in bailing out oil and gas compa-
nies and other big interests than in 
helping the families struggling to af-
ford coronavirus treatment. 
As the spread of coronavirus con-
tinues within our borders, Democrats 
remain 
committed—absolutely 
com-
mitted—to finding ways we can protect 
Americans most at risk by this disease. 
President Trump should work with us 
in Congress to make sure we continue 
managing this pandemic in a measured, 
responsible, and transparent manner. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
SASSE). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 3415 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, Senator 
ALEXANDER is here. Senator MURRAY 
will be joining us in a moment. They 
are the chair and ranking member of 
the Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions Committee, which has jurisdic-
tion over this very important issue of 
sick leave with sick pay. Many compa-
nies do that in this country. We are the 
only wealthy country in the world that 
doesn’t have a real policy. As Senator 
ALEXANDER says, we do this for Federal 
employees. It should be for more than 
those of us who are Federal employees. 
Today, we need to get help to the 
people who need it now: parents whose 
children’s schools are closed; people 
who aren’t getting paid; people who 
have trouble making rent or making 
their mortgage payments or their stu-
dent loan payments. Paid sick days are 
one of the most important ways we do 
that. That is why we need to pass this 
bill today. 
Think about restaurant workers pre-
paring our food. Think about what you 
do if your child’s school closes down for 
a week. For so many people, taking a 
sick day means going without pay and 
potentially losing their jobs. Put your-
self in their position. It is hard for us 
to do—we are lucky enough and privi-
leged enough to have these jobs—and 
for most of our staff also. But think 
about a worker making $12 an hour. 
That worker has symptoms. She is the 
only working person in her family. She 
might 
think 
her 
illness 
is 
the 
coronavirus; nonetheless, her illness is 
debilitating enough that it is hard for 
her to go to work. She is making $12 an 
hour. She stays home and loses $100 
that day. She has a $700-a-month rent 
payment or possibly lower than that if 
she is making $12 an hour. She has to 
make a decision: Do I go to work and 
potentially infect others but get my 
pay and maybe make myself sicker, or 
do I stay home to get well and give up 
that $100? 
Then you think about some of those 
other workers. Someone might be a 
restaurant worker preparing our food. 
What do you do if your child’s school 
closes down for a week, as schools—al-
ready Ohio State, Kent State, Case 
Western, and Baldwin Wallace have 
shut their doors. They have not really 
shut their doors; they are doing learn-
ing by distance, tele-learning. It means 
a number of people at those schools are 
in a very different situation with their 
employment. 
Taking a sick day means going with-
out pay. Taking a sick day may mean 
losing your job. It hurts everyone. If 
you are lucky enough to have paid 
time off—everybody is at risk when 
more people are out and about when 
they are sick. 
Our office gets calls from workers all 
the time. Senator ALEXANDER has Ten-
nesseans calling him. Senator MURRAY 
has Washingtonians calling her, ask-
ing: What do I do if I come down with 
something? I have to choose between 
going to work while I am sick or losing 
a paycheck or losing my job. 
Because of our policy, we have put 
people in that situation or they are in 
that situation, and we have an obliga-
tion now to do something about it. It is 
unacceptable that millions of Ameri-
cans are faced with that impossible 
choice. 
That choice gets worse. I don’t know 
how many people are faced with that 
choice today. We know it is millions. 
Tomorrow, it will be 1.2 times that, 
and the next day, it may be half again. 
We know this is getting worse before it 
gets better. 
I am not an alarmist. I think we have 
some of the best health officials in the 
world. We have public health profes-
sionals who I think—the Governor of 
Ohio, a Republican, Mike DeWine, and 
I have talked a couple of times exten-
sively. People in Ohio are doing this 
right. 
We don’t always get the leadership 
out of the White House we would like 
when we see the President saying 
something that is almost the opposite 
of our public health professionals. I 
tend to listen to the public health pro-
fessionals. I know Senator ALEXANDER 
does too. I would be hopeful that the 
President does. 
We know this impossible choice is 
getting more and more serious. Some 
corporations do the right thing, but

March 11, 2020 
many are not doing the right thing. 
Some are promising they are going to 
do the right thing, but promises are 
not enough. We need to pass this bill 
now. 
Our legislation would require all em-
ployers to allow workers to accrue 7 
days of paid sick leave, and the bill 
would also provide an additional 14 
days that would be available imme-
diately in the event of any public 
health emergency like we have right 
now. This is a public health emergency. 
We need to do emergency kind of legis-
lation. This is an unusual, extraor-
dinary problem. We have to do some-
thing extraordinary here. Passing this 
bill allowing workers to accrue 7 days 
of paid sick leave and providing an ad-
ditional 14 days available immediately 
in the event of any public health emer-
gency is what we need to do. 
Congress 
can’t 
wait. 
People 
are 
choosing between going to work sick 
and missing a paycheck. They are mak-
ing that choice every day. People in 
Memphis and Cleveland and people in 
Omaha and Dayton are making that 
choice every day—do I go to work sick, 
or do I stay home and miss that $120 I 
was going to earn this week? 
We need to do this today. We need 
this bill to prevent the spread of 
coronavirus and stop this crisis from 
getting worse. It is about the dignity of 
work. It is about public safety. 
I will wait for Senator MURRAY to 
make the UC request. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak as in 
morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I also 
want to thank all of my colleagues who 
are coming down to speak about this 
today. 
Families in my home State of Wash-
ington are scared. They are frustrated. 
They are angry. And so am I. New re-
porting now makes it clear that even 
after researchers in Seattle raised seri-
ous concerns about the possibility of 
community 
spread 
in 
Washington 
State and tried to work with Federal 
agencies to conduct testing, the admin-
istration didn’t work with them to let 
the public know how serious the 
coronavirus was. You can be sure I am 
going to get to the bottom of this and 
make sure it will never happen again. I 
am furious that instead of acting with 
urgency, they did nothing; instead of 
acting with transparency, they kept 
quiet; instead of working to keep fami-
lies safe, they wasted valuable time. 
And now in my State, 24 people have 
died. Over 1,000 across the country are 
confirmed to be infected, and experts 
are telling us that many more are like-
ly to be ill. 
I am hearing from people in my home 
State of Washington who are worried 
about their older relatives who are 
dying alone; worried about having to 
miss work and being unable to pay 
their rent; worried about how to keep 
their children safe at school and how to 
care for them and make sure they get 
a nutritious meal if their schools can-
cel. I am hearing from small business 
owners who are worried because no one 
is now coming through their door and 
they are unsure how to support the 
workers going forward. I am hearing 
from communities that are worried 
about how they protect people who are 
experiencing homelessness. I have seen 
a lot in my years as a Senator, but I 
am not exaggerating when I say this is 
one of the most trying times I have 
ever seen in my State experience. 
I am absolutely going to be holding 
this administration accountable for 
missing so many opportunities to get 
ahead of this, but I am also going to be 
doing everything in my power to make 
sure we do not miss significant oppor-
tunities. We still have time to slow 
this down and manage it as best we 
can. 
Our primary goal right now for peo-
ple in my home State and across the 
country needs to be slowing the spread 
of the virus in areas where there are 
outbreaks so that areas where it has 
not hit so hard yet have the time to 
prepare. One of the best ways we can do 
this is by allowing workers who feel 
sick or who need to stay home with a 
child whose school is closed to do so 
without losing a paycheck or their job. 
Workers and their families want to 
do the right things for themselves and 
for their communities, but for many of 
our 
workers—restaurant 
workers, 
truckdrivers, service industry work-
ers—they may not have an option to 
take a day off without losing their pay 
or losing their job. That leaves them 
with the impossible choice between 
putting food on their table and paying 
the bills or the rent and protecting 
themselves and others. That is not a 
choice we should be asking anyone to 
make in the United States of America 
in the 21st century. Yet 32 million peo-
ple in our country today—or about one 
out of every four private sector work-
ers—are faced with this impossible 
choice every time they get sick. Right 
now, this choice has unique and poten-
tially dire consequences. 
I have been advocating for legislation 
to allow workers to earn paid sick days 
since 2004, along with my colleague 
Congressman ROSA
DELAURO
in the 
House. Time and again, we have been 
told no even though that simple step is 
critical, as we now see, for public 
health and gives workers the flexibility 
they need. In fact, we last introduced 
our bill in March of 2019, and here we 
are almost a year later to the day 
without the very policies in place that 
would have now helped millions of our 
workers and bolstered our resilience in 
the face of this exact kind of public 
healthcare crisis that paid sick days 
are intended to prevent and to miti-
gate. 
We now have another opportunity to 
get this right. I am here to ask my col-
leagues to support our new emergency 
paid sick days legislation, which would 
ensure workers would have 14 days of 
paid sick leave immediately in re-
sponse to public health emergencies 
like the one we face today in addition 
to allowing workers to gradually earn 
their 7 days of paid sick leave. 
It would mean you would not lose a 
paycheck if, like so many parents in 
my home State of Washington and 
across the country are facing, your 
child’s school has to close in the com-
ing weeks because of this health out-
break. It would mean you would not 
lose a paycheck if your family member 
were quarantined and you needed to 
stay home to take care of him so that 
you would not spread the virus. Also, if 
you could not go to work because you 
were sick or your workplace were shut 
down, as we are seeing in so many 
places, you wouldn’t lose pay. These 
are the real challenges people are now 
facing and will continue to face. 
Our bill would help these workers im-
mediately, the minute it becomes law. 
We have enough delay when it comes to 
paid sick days, so let’s get this done. 
Let’s keep working, as we need to do, 
on a comprehensive, coordinated re-
sponse that focuses squarely on what 
our families and our workers and our 
small businesses need in the weeks and 
months ahead. 
The Democrats on this side have a 
lot of ideas that we are laying out in 
response to this, including how to 
make sure these tests are affordable, 
that we support our most vulnerable 
communities, and that we reckon with 
the economic impact this crisis is hav-
ing on our communities and Nation. 
There is a lot we need to do in the 
weeks and months ahead, but I urge us 
to start today with this simple, really 
important issue. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Committee on Health, 
Education, Labor, and Pensions be dis-
charged from further consideration of 
S. 3415, a bill to allow Americans to 
earn paid sick time so that they can 
address their own health needs and the 
health needs of their families; that the 
Senate proceed to its immediate con-
sideration; that the bill be considered 
read a third time and passed; and that 
the motion to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table with no 
intervening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Tennessee. 
Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, in 
reserving the right to object, I will 
continue to work with the Senator 
from Washington State, as we always 
do, and on a comprehensive response to 
the this issue, the coronavirus. She and 
I have had four briefings, and we will 
have another one tomorrow. We have a 
history of being able to come to agree-
ment on these matters. 
The idea of there being paid sick 
leave is a good idea, but if Washington, 
DC, thinks it is a good idea, Wash-
ington, DC, should pay for it. When I

was the Governor of Tennessee, noth-
ing used to make me more unhappy 
than when some well-meaning indi-
vidual in the U.S. Senate or U.S. House 
would come up with a big idea, pass it, 
take credit for it, and send me the bill. 
Employees are struggling, and so are 
employers struggling, but it is not a 
cure for the coronavirus to, in the mid-
dle of this matter, put a big, new, ex-
pensive Federal mandate on employers 
who are struggling. Paid sick leave is a 
good idea, and we do it in my office. 
The Federal Government now does it, 
and many businesses do it. Yet, if the 
Federal Government wants to require 
it, the Federal Government should pay 
for it. 
I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Washington. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I do 
appreciate the fact that the Senator 
from Tennessee has been a great part-
ner with me on many issues. I will keep 
talking to him about this. 
Let me just say, without doing this, 
the cost to businesses is going to grow 
exponentially. We have already seen it 
on Wall Street, and we are seeing it in 
our communities. Because people are 
not getting paid, they are going to 
work and are spreading this virus. We 
are seeing the impact and will continue 
to see it in our communities as fewer 
people go to their stores or as fewer 
people go to their businesses. 
We either do this now or we are going 
to continue to pay for it in the future. 
I am sorry it has been objected to 
today, because I think it is such a crit-
ical step with regard to this public 
health crisis we are having. We need to 
get this done. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, as I 
watch up close and from afar Senator 
ALEXANDER’s and Senator MURRAY’s so 
often working together on issues like 
this, 
I 
absolutely 
believe 
Senator 
ALEXANDER when he says it is a good 
idea. Yet, as Senator MURRAY just said, 
there are all kinds of costs being im-
posed on businesses as a result of peo-
ple who go to work sick. It is also more 
expensive for public hospitals and more 
expensive as more people get sick and 
what that means to Medicaid. These 
costs are impossible to quantify today 
with our not having a sick leave policy. 
A year from now, we will be able to 
look back on what the costs really 
were, and they will have been over-
whelming. A solid, coherent sick leave 
policy—something modest like Senator 
MURRAY
is calling for—could really 
make a difference. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Colorado. 
REMEMBERING FELIX SPARKS 
Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor to remember the life 
and service of a Colorado hero and to 
reflect on an upcoming anniversary of 
an event during World War II. 
The hero’s name is Felix Sparks—a 
name that may very well be familiar to 
the people of Colorado. Felix Sparks 
was born in Texas, though. We have a 
lot of Texans in Colorado, but this one 
made the right choice and stayed in 
Colorado. He was born in San Antonio, 
TX, in 1917, and he spent his childhood 
around Miami, AZ, where his family 
and father worked in a mining com-
pany. He was in high school during the 
Great Depression and was the eldest of 
five siblings. 
Soon after graduating from high 
school, Felix decided to enlist in the 
U.S. Army. Upon completing his enlist-
ment, Felix enrolled at the University 
of Arizona and completed the Citizens’ 
Military 
Training 
program, 
which 
earned him a commission as a second 
lieutenant. Mr. Sparks then went on to 
pursue a pre-law degree. He had just 
finished his first semester of that effort 
when he was ordered to report for duty 
to the 157th Infantry Regiment in Colo-
rado. He was ordered to report at the 
very beginning of World War II. That 
year was 1940—right before the United 
States officially entered World War II. 
Neither Felix Sparks nor the Amer-
ican people knew it at the time, but 
World War II was about to change the 
history of the United States and the 
world forever. Felix would be on the 
frontlines of one of the most pivotal 
moments of World War II. 
As a little bit of background on his 
work, along with the National Guard 
units from Oklahoma, Arizona, and 
New Mexico, Colorado’s 157th Infantry 
Regiment mobilized in support of the 
U.S. Army’s 45th Infantry Division in 
Oklahoma, also known as the Thunder-
bird Division. 
The division set sail for North Africa 
in June 1943 for its first mission—the 
invasion of Sicily. Over the next 511 
days, Felix Sparks and his fellow sol-
diers 
in 
the 
Thunderbird 
Division 
would participate in so many well- 
known combat operations in Sicily, 
Naples-Foggia, Rome-Arno, Southern 
France, the Ardennes-Alsace, Rhine-
land, and Central Europe. It was an in-
credibly well-documented, decorated 
campaign. Yet, of these 511 days, Felix 
Sparks most often recounted one day 
in particular more than any other. 
That day was April 29, 1945. 
On April 29, 1945, LTC Felix Sparks 
was the commander of the 3rd Bat-
talion, 157th Infantry Regiment, and on 
that day, that April day, after so many 
days of fighting and after what they 
had already seen, the 157th Infantry 
Regiment, along with units of the 42nd 
Infantry Division and the 20th Armored 
Infantry Division, led the liberation of 
approximately 32,000 prisoners at the 
Dachau concentration camp. Although 
his unit had suffered thousands of cas-
ualties over the course of the war, 
what Lieutenant Colonel Sparks and 
his soldiers discovered at Dachau was 
beyond compare. 
Felix Sparks described that day as 
one of the darkest days of his lifetime 
and, I can only imagine, one of the 
darkest days of lifetimes put together. 
Along with many of his fellow soldiers, 
he would spend the rest of his life reliv-
ing the horrors of what he witnessed at 
Dachau. As they neared the camp, the 
American forces discovered nearly 40 
railroad cars that were filled with de-
composing bodies. Felix Sparks said 
the ‘‘stench of death was overpow-
ering’’ and that what he saw at the 
camp made Dante’s Inferno seem ‘‘pale 
compared to the real hell of Dachau.’’ 
Inside the camp were even more bodies 
and more than 30,000 survivors—sur-
vivors of one of the darkest places in 
one of the darkest moments in world 
history. 
We say we must never forget the hor-
rors of the Holocaust, but Felix Sparks 
and the Americans who liberated Da-
chau didn’t have a choice. They could 
never forget and will never forget. 
Felix Sparks said: 
The men of the 45th Infantry Division were 
hardened combat veterans. [We had seen so 
many fights.] We had been in combat almost 
two years at that point. While we were ac-
customed to death, we were not able to com-
prehend the type of death that we encoun-
tered at Dachau. 
There is no going back. There is no 
forgetting. There is no trying to erase 
from memory the horrors of Nazism 
and seeing it up close. The liberation of 
Dachau would be one of the Thunder-
bird Division’s final missions during 
World War II. The division was offi-
cially deactivated on December 7, 
1945—4 years after Pearl Harbor. 
Following the end of the war, Felix 
Sparks attended the University of Col-
orado Law School in Boulder, CO—my 
alma mater. He graduated in 1947 and 
started a law practice in Delta, CO, 
while he also served as a district attor-
ney. In 1956, Felix Sparks was ap-
pointed as the youngest ever—in Colo-
rado’s history—associate justice of the 
Colorado Supreme Court. 
Then, in 1958, Felix accepted the role 
of director of the Colorado Water Con-
servation Board, where he was instru-
mental in the development of sustain-
able water policies for the State. For 
those not familiar with Colorado, this 
is an incredibly important position. We 
are a State whose history is written in 
water. Yet that wasn’t enough for Felix 
Sparks. It was not all. 
Felix Sparks wasn’t just serving in 
his civilian life; he continued his mili-
tary service as well. After returning 
home from World War II, Felix had 
joined the Colorado Army National 
Guard. He would go on to serve in and 
take command of the Colorado Na-
tional Guard for nearly 30 years be-
tween the two—both service and com-
manding. He retired at the rank of 
brigadier general. 
As both a civilian and a soldier, Felix 
Sparks truly exemplified servant lead-
ership. His sense of duty to our Nation 
and to my home State lives on today, 
and I am proud to honor his legacy and 
life of service. Felix Sparks died on 
September 24, 2007, at the age of 90. He 
is buried in Wheat Ridge, CO.

leagues from both sides of the aisle, I

will soon be introducing a resolution to 
commemorate the 75th anniversary of 
the liberation of the Dachau concentra-
tion camp during World War II and to 
honor the service of Felix Sparks, as 
well as of the courageous personnel he 
fought alongside and of the brave men 
and women they saved along the way, 
and in memory of the tens of thousands 
who were brutally and savagely mur-
dered by the Nazi regime. 
We must never forget what happened. 
Unfortunately, far too many Ameri-
cans and far too many people around 
the world may put aside these mo-
ments of our darkest time in history 
and forget or can’t name a ghetto or a 
concentration camp today. That is 
something that we have to fix, that we 
have to correct, that we have to con-
tinue to speak of—the horrors that can 
never be repeated in the darkest times 
of our history. 
I invite all of my colleagues to join 
me in supporting this resolution. We 
already have the Senators from the 
States that participated in the Thun-
derbird Division so that we may re-
member the lives lost to the atrocities 
of the Holocaust and to World War II 
and remember the tens of thousands 
who were spared by the brave acts of 
our Nation’s military. We must never 
forget. I urge my colleagues to support 
this resolution in one more showing to 
never forget. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would 
like to address the issue which will be 
before us at noon on the vote, but, pre-
ceding that, I would like to say a word 
on a different topic that certainly is on 
everybody’s mind, and that is the 
coronavirus. 
I was recently notified by my Gov-
ernor, Governor Pritzker, that we have 
run into a shortage in our State of the 
test kits that are necessary. Some 330 
Illinoisans have been tested to date, 
and these are people who, on physi-
cian’s orders, should be tested because 
of exposure to coronavirus or because 
of the vulnerability of the patient and 
the suspicion that they may have been 
exposed to the virus. 
The difficulty that we have run into 
is that the testing process apparently 
is coming to a stop. We are running out 
of the test kits, and there has been 
contact made with the Centers for Dis-
ease Control to determine why we are 
not getting responses on this need for 
additional kits in our State to test peo-
ple who are truly vulnerable. 
I don’t believe our situation could be 
unique. I imagine other States are fac-
ing this same challenge. 
I reached out to the Centers for Dis-
ease Control within the hour and had a 
lengthy conversation about the situa-
tion that we are facing. 
Originally, the coronavirus test kits 
faced a shortage of reagents that were 
necessary to take the initial test. It 
turns out they are now facing a new 
challenge: It is an issue of the global 
supply of enzymes that are used by lab-
oratories to analyze the test results. 
This is a commercially available en-
zyme that is now in short supply, and 
CDC is desperately looking for other 
commercial sources that are reliable 
that can come to the rescue. 
The testing process, of course, is 
going to stop if the laboratories can’t 
take the initial test results and test 
them to see whether they are positive 
or negative. They are looking for alter-
native ways at the CDC to meet this 
need. It is a critically important issue, 
and the lack of these enzymes limits 
the actual tests that can be taken 
across the United States. 
The source at the CDC told me this 
situation is not unique to our country. 
It is a commercially produced product, 
and they are looking for other sources, 
either within the United States or 
without, as quickly as possible. This is 
a market-driven problem, and the CDC 
is looking across the market for 
sources to solve the problem. 
For the time being, there is no relief 
in sight in Illinois or other places that 
have run into this same issue, where 
people desperately need to be tested to 
determine whether they are positive 
for this virus, and the testing, even if 
it takes place, cannot go through the 
laboratory approval. 
The commercial supplies of this en-
zyme, apparently, are depleted at this 
moment. It is an urgent issue, as I 
mentioned repeatedly. They are look-
ing for optional alternative platforms 
for this laboratory testing. 
Now, I would say at this point I don’t 
want to speculate on what that means. 
It is far beyond my personal expertise. 
But it is an indication of a desperate 
situation in many places. It is one that 
we need to respond to and quickly. 
To argue that there are enough test 
kits that have been distributed is ques-
tionable to start with. But even if dis-
tributed and they cannot be analyzed, 
it really doesn’t give us the informa-
tion necessary to protect the Ameri-
cans who may be vulnerable. 
The bottom line is this. This admin-
istration is facing a challenge over test 
kits that still have many unanswered 
questions. How did other countries in 
the world—Korea and others—come up 
with test kits early on in volumes that 
were necessary to address this problem, 
and the United States did not? Why 
didn’t we accept these test kits in 
other countries that apparently do 
come up with results that are needed 
and necessary? 
I don’t know those answers. Only 
time will provide them to us. But, in 
the meantime, we have appropriated 
all the funds and more asked for by the 
Trump administration to deal with this 
issue, on a bipartisan basis, and that is 
exactly what we should continue to do. 
But we need start-to-finish straight an-
swers from everyone in the administra-
tion and outside about this public 
health threat. 
Credibility is the first step toward 
dealing with a public health challenge 
such as the one we face today, and this 
test kit issue is clearly central to our 
bringing this situation under control— 
the sooner we get straight answers and 
good information and can respond to it 
quickly, the better for our Nation. 
H.J. RES. 76 
Mr. President, in just a few minutes, 
we will see a vote on the floor of the 
U.S. Senate that is fairly unique. There 
aren’t many votes in this Chamber. 
This one, actually, is meaningful, be-
cause this issue before us on a vote at 
noon today relates to student bor-
rowers 
who 
went 
to 
colleges—pri-
marily, for-profit colleges and univer-
sities—and ended up attending those 
schools, going deeply into debt by bor-
rowing money from the government to 
go to school, only to learn at a later 
stage that they were misled. 
The schools didn’t tell them the 
truth. The schools many times told 
them that if they took certain courses, 
there was a job waiting for them. In 
some cases they even told how much 
the jobs paid. They went on to say that 
the schools themselves had certain peo-
ple on the faculty with certain quali-
fications, and it turned out that wasn’t 
true. In addition, many students were 
told that the hours that they took at 
these for-profit schools could be trans-
ferred to other schools if they wanted 
to complete someplace else. It turns 
out that wasn’t true either. These stu-
dents were basically defrauded. 
If you can understand the predica-
ment, here is a student customer sit-
ting at a desk in an office at a for-prof-
it college or university being asked 
questions and being given information 
for the most important contract they 
will sign in their early lives. Many of 
these students incurred substantial 
student debt based on the representa-
tions and misrepresentations of these 
colleges and universities. 
They find out now that the schools 
have gone bankrupt in some cases, and 
some schools that didn’t go bankrupt 
ended up providing them with training 
and education completely inadequate 
for them to find a job. Here is the stu-
dent deep in debt, having wasted years 
of their lives in these for-profit col-
leges and universities with nowhere to 
turn. Their lives are affected by it. 
Who wouldn’t be? Whether it is 
$20,000 or $50,000 or $100,000 in debt, it 
quickly adds up, and students find 
themselves literally in chains because 
of student debt and because of mis-
representations made by the schools. 
You might say: What is the govern-
ment going to do about it? We decided 
years ago exactly what we should do 
about it. We put in the Higher Edu-
cation Act something called the bor-
rower defense, and here is what it said.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1684 
March 11, 2020 
If you went to a school and they lied to 
you, if they misrepresented what you 
were going to receive in your edu-
cation, if they deceived you and de-
frauded you, and then you incurred a 
student debt because of it, you can go 
to the U.S. Department of Education 
under what is known as the borrower 
defense program and seek relief from 
some or all of your student debt. 
This borrower defense program is not 
new. It has been around many years. 
But in the year 2014, it became a pop-
ular situation, sadly, because these for- 
profit schools were defrauding so many 
thousands of students. Over 200,000 stu-
dents currently have a claim at the 
U.S. Department of Education that 
they were deceived by these for-profit 
schools, which are notorious for the 
representations and misrepresentations 
they make to these students. 
These 200,000 students went to the 
Department of Education and said: Be-
cause there is statutory relief here, we 
are 
asking 
you, 
Secretary 
Betsy 
DeVos, to give us relief from this debt. 
We were students at these schools. 
And she has refused. She has refused 
to take up their cases, refused to con-
sider the merits of them, despite the 
fact that President Obama, before her 
and through the Department of Edu-
cation, was actually using this pro-
gram and this law to help the students. 
To add insult to injury, Secretary 
DeVos said: Incidentally, we are going 
to change the standards at the Depart-
ment of Education for students who 
feel that they have been defrauded and 
that the schools have misrepresented 
things to them. 
How did she change the standards? 
She made it extremely difficult for 
these students to get any relief from 
the student debt from the schools that 
misrepresented them. Instead of the 
students’ being able to rely, for exam-
ple, on the fact that many States have 
investigated these schools and found 
fraudulent misconduct, she has estab-
lished a new standard that each of the 
students has to prove that there was, 
in fact, an intentional defrauding of 
that student. 
What does that mean? Each of these 
students has to lawyer up and each of 
these students has to have some inves-
tigative capacity to meet the new 
standard that has been established by 
Betsy DeVos at the Department of 
Education. 
It turns out that these students are 
up in arms over it, and I am joining 
them. This measure on the floor would 
put an end to this new rule by Sec-
retary DeVos and say that you have to 
treat students fairly when it comes to 
those who have been defrauded. 
Yesterday, the Senate voted 55 to 41 
on a bipartisan rollcall—fairly unusual, 
but a bipartisan rollcall—where 10 Re-
publicans joined the Democrats to 
move the measure disapproving of this 
new rule by Secretary DeVos. I want to 
thank my Republican colleagues who 
stood up for these students and vet-
erans. 
We have veteran organizations com-
ing to us saying: You can’t do this. 
What happens is that we have military 
men and women who, when they are 
discharged from service, qualify for the 
GI bill. The GI bill pays for their col-
lege education, as it should, and I am 
proud that we do that. These very same 
schools not only take the GI benefits 
but then tell the students they have to 
turn around and borrow more money to 
finish what turns out to be an abso-
lutely worthless education and train-
ing. The American Legion and many 
other veterans organizations are lead-
ing the charge with us to change this 
new Secretary Betsy DeVos standard. I 
thank them for that. 
In 1992—that is how far back it goes— 
we put into law in the Higher Edu-
cation Act this borrower defense so 
that students who were defrauded had 
somewhere to turn when it came to 
student 
debt 
they 
incurred. 
The 
schools misrepresented how many job 
placements would take place if they 
finished the courses. They misrepre-
sented the earning potential of these 
jobs after graduation. They lied about 
the cost of attending these schools. 
They told the students their credits 
would transfer when, in fact, they did 
not. This kind of misrepresentation 
left these students to sign up for more 
student loans and go more deeply in 
debt because they were lied to. Those 
are just a few of the examples. 
Congress rightly didn’t want to leave 
the students to be left holding the bag 
for the misconduct of the schools. So it 
created in 1992 this statutory borrower 
defense. No one had ever heard of it 
until 2014, when Corinthian Colleges 
collapsed and the lid was blown off of 
other for-profit colleges and univer-
sities’ fraud. We are talking about the 
University of Phoenix and DeVry and 
others. If you look, you will find them, 
and it is a long list. There are two 
numbers you need to know about the 
for-profit colleges and universities, and 
this will be on the final. One number is 
8: 8 percent of all postsecondary stu-
dents go to for-profit colleges and uni-
versities—8 percent. The other is 33: 33 
percent of all federal student loan de-
faults are students from for-profit col-
leges and universities. For the very 
reasons that we come to the floor 
today, these schools are notorious for 
misrepresenting 
to 
students, 
over-
charging them in tuition, and pro-
viding them with little or no education 
for the future. These schools take the 
money and run, and the students are 
left holding the bag with massive 
debts. 
Corinthian is a good example. It col-
lapsed in 2014. Thousands of students 
were the victims of Corinthian’s mis-
representations. 
They 
inflated 
job 
placement rates, took out loans for 
students without their knowledge, and 
lied to the students about employers 
recognizing their degrees. Corinthian 
was not unique. Nearly every other 
major for-profit college has been the 
subject of multiple State and Federal 
investigations and lawsuits for similar 
predatory practices. 
Since the year 2015, nearly 300,000 
student borrowers—mostly from for- 
profit colleges—have applied to the De-
partment of Education for this dis-
charge, and it is not going to stop. 
These 
for-profit 
colleges 
are 
the 
coronavirus of higher education. The 
Department of Education estimates 
that nearly 200,000 borrowers will be 
subject to further illegal practices by 
their schools in 2021 alone. This new 
DeVos rule is going to make it ex-
tremely difficult, if not impossible, for 
students to find relief. The best esti-
mate is that 3 percent of the students 
who are defrauded by their school will 
get relief, and the other 97 percent will 
not under this new rule that we will 
have a chance to vote against this 
afternoon. 
The rule by Secretary DeVos makes 
it almost impossible for future de-
frauded borrowers to receive the bor-
rower defense discharge that Congress 
intended. It eliminates all group relief. 
Each of the students is supposed to 
lawyer up. To prove their claims under 
the rule, the borrowers must provide 
evidence that the school intended to 
deceive them, had knowledge of the de-
ception, or acted with reckless dis-
regard. 
How many students fresh out of 
school are able to make that legal 
proof? In addition, borrowers under the 
DeVos rule are required to show finan-
cial harm above and beyond the fact 
that they took out the loans that now 
burden them later in life. 
This is a situation where we can re-
spond as a Congress and should on a bi-
partisan basis. The House has already 
passed this measure saying that we re-
ject this new Secretary Betsy DeVos 
rule when it comes to this mistreat-
ment of students who were defrauded 
and have a debt as a result of it. 
One of my Senate colleagues whom I 
respect very much yesterday used a car 
analogy to defend Secretary DeVos’ 
rule. He said: 
If your car is a lemon, you don’t sue the 
bank; you sue the dealer. A college can be a 
lemon, just like a car can be. 
That is what the Senator said. His 
point is that the students who were de-
frauded by the school, sold a lemon of 
an education, should go after the 
school and not the Department of Edu-
cation—except that the DeVos rule al-
lows the schools to prevent students 
from suing them. It eliminates a prohi-
bition in current rules on the use of 
mandatory 
arbitration 
clauses 
and 
class actions. 
Under the existing rule, students of 
Corinthian could have come together 
in a class action and ask for relief in a 
court of law directly from the school. 
Secretary DeVos eliminates that: Go 
on your own. Each one of you students 
stand up for yourself. 
Is that fair? I don’t think it is. It cer-
tainly isn’t the kind of thing that we 
want to see in terms of justice for 
these students. The DeVos rule causes

the person who bought the lemon to be 
forced to sue the bank instead of the 
car dealer. You can’t have it both 
ways. 
It is not just me who believes that 
the DeVos rule is bad for student bor-
rowers. A number of student, con-
sumer, veteran, and other organiza-
tions are supporting this resolution to 
overturn the rule: the American Fed-
eration of Teachers, the National Edu-
cation Association, the NAACP, Third 
Way, Bipartisan Policy Center Action, 
the Leadership Conference on Civil and 
Human Rights, and 20 different State 
attorneys general. But the groups I 
want to highlight as I close in these 
final 2 or 3 minutes are the veterans or-
ganizations. 
Many of the students who have been 
defrauded are veterans. These men and 
women have served our country in uni-
form, and after serving they seek an 
education to provide a better life for 
themselves and their families, and they 
deserve it. We have story after story 
after story of veterans who signed up 
at these for-profit colleges. They were 
told the GI education benefits were all 
they needed, only to waste the entire 
benefits on a worthless degree and be 
forced to take tens of thousands of dol-
lars of student debt on top of it. 
That is why our effort in this vote in 
just 2 minutes on the floor of the Sen-
ate—our effort to overturn this rule—is 
supported by the American Legion, the 
Student Veterans of America, the Iraq 
and Afghanistan Veterans of America, 
the National Military Families Asso-
ciation, the Paralyzed Veterans of 
America, Tragedy Assistance Program 
for Survivors, VetsFirst, Veterans for 
Common Sense, and Veterans Edu-
cation Success. 
James ‘‘Bill’’ Oxford is the national 
commander of the American Legion, 
and he wrote to me and said: ‘‘Thou-
sands of student veterans have been de-
frauded over the years—promised their 
credits 
would 
transfer 
when 
they 
wouldn’t, given false or misleading job 
placement rates in marketing, prom-
ised one educational experience . . . 
but given something completely dif-
ferent. 
He, 
the 
American 
Legion 
com-
mander, calls the DeVos rule ‘‘fun-
damentally rigged against defrauded 
borrowers’’ and says that it ‘‘flagrantly 
denies defrauded veterans [fair and 
timely] decisions [on their claims].’’ 
How many speeches do each of us 
give as Senators about how much we 
value our military and veterans? We 
have a chance to prove it in just 1 
minute, because there will be a roll 
call. Are you going to stand up for 
these veterans and these students and 
are you going to say to Secretary 
DeVos you are headed the wrong way? 
These students and these veterans 
have been defrauded. Give them a 
fighting chance to rebuild their lives. 
Don’t make it next to impossible.

Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask

CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, over the 
last several weeks, the world has 
watched closely as the coronavirus has 
spread from China to more than 100 
countries around the world. 
Since this rapid spread began—before 
cases were discovered in at least 35 
States, including the District of Co-
lumbia—folks in my hometown of San 
Antonio were already providing top-
notch care for Americans evacuated 
from Wuhan Province overseas with 
suspected exposure. 
From the first evacuees from China 
to more than 120 passengers from the 
Diamond Princess cruise ship, to those 
who will soon arrive from the Grand 
Princess cruise ship, the dedicated 
healthcare professionals in San Anto-
nio have been operating—have been 
hitting on all cylinders. 
So far, Lackland Air Force Base has 
been used to quarantine 235 evacuees, 
with hundreds more to arrive in the 
coming days. I must say, they have 
done a good job of managing this rap-
idly evolving situation, but that is not 
to say there haven’t been challenges. 
A few weeks ago, I organized a meet-
ing with officials from the city of San 
Antonio, including the mayor and two 
city council persons, as well as the De-
partment of Health and Human Serv-
ices and the Defense Department, to 
discuss the ongoing mission and any 
concerns the city might have. Anytime 
officials at every level of government

March 11, 2020 
are working together—whether it is in 
response to a natural disaster or a pub-
lic health emergency—coordination is 
key. You have to make sure everybody 
is operating on the same page and reg-
ularly sharing information—something 
that was a challenge in the beginning 
and remains a challenge today. 
At one point, we were able to get ev-
erybody in the same room to discuss 
not only the response to the virus but 
the steps to be taken to protect the 
general public in the surrounding area. 
Of course, that work doesn’t start and 
end at Lackland in San Antonio. Hos-
pitals around the State are facing a 
great deal of pressure and uncertainty 
surrounding the virus and working to 
ensure that they are prepared to treat 
potential coronavirus patients without 
impacting their normal operations is 
an urgent concern. 
Last week, I helped organize a con-
ference call with the Texas Hospital 
Association and officials from Health 
and Human Services and the Texas De-
partment of State Health Services to 
discuss some of the issues of concern to 
hospitals serving on the frontline all 
across our State. There have been a lot 
of news stories about the shortage of 
masks and personal protective equip-
ment for healthcare workers and subse-
quent price gouging, and that is a big 
concern for these hospitals—many of 
which serve rural populations. As I told 
folks on that call, communication in 
these situations is critical. It seems so 
obvious, but it is not done unless you 
insist upon it. I was particularly glad 
to hear personally their concerns so we 
can make sure we are doing what is 
needed on our end in Washington, DC, 
to support them. 
I 
appreciate 
Texas’s 
incredible 
healthcare professionals who have been 
working to treat patients in their care 
and 
prevent 
the 
coronavirus 
from 
spreading to the general public. The 
city of San Antonio—I have to single 
out in particular—has been carrying 
the weight of the struggle for a number 
of weeks now, and it has come at quite 
a significant cost to city taxpayers. 
Fortunately, last week, the President 
signed an $8.3 billion funding bill to 
support our Nation’s response to the 
coronavirus. It will send vital funding 
for treating and preventing the spread 
of the virus, including the purchase of 
masks and personal protective equip-
ment, as well as supporting the devel-
opment of a vaccine. 
The funding bill will also include 
money for State and local commu-
nities, including San Antonio, which 
have been at the forefront of the battle 
at home. That makes $950 million 
available for reimbursement for the 
costs Texas and other States have in-
curred while monitoring and treating 
these individuals. It is a start in the 
process to repay San Antonio for the 
work they have done to help our Na-
tion 
mitigate 
the 
impact 
of 
the 
coronavirus. 
I appreciate Chairman SHELBY and 
Ranking Member LEAHY for including 
this reimbursement funding in the leg-
islation and working so closely with all 
of us to get the relief on the way as 
soon as possible. 
Over the last couple of days, we have 
witnessed 
the 
ripple 
effect 
the 
coronavirus threat has had on the mar-
kets, and the next big question on ev-
eryone’s mind is how this virus will im-
pact the economy. Yesterday we had 
the opportunity to discuss potential 
options with President Trump, Vice 
President 
PENCE, 
and 
Secretary 
Mnuchin, and we are continuing to 
work to identify the best path forward. 
Unfortunately, 
there 
doesn’t 
yet 
seem to be a bipartisan effort to try to 
reach a consensus—something we need. 
One of our Democratic colleagues sug-
gested that the best way to prevent 
economic damage is to stop the spread 
of the virus. I can’t argue with that 
logic, but unless that Senator knows 
something the rest of us don’t know, 
that is not exactly a productive use of 
our time. We know we need to stop the 
virus, but we also need to deal with the 
economic fallout as well. 
When we were in a position in 2014 
with the Ebola crisis, we didn’t hear a 
lot of griping about what President 
Obama was doing. We found ways to 
work with him for the betterment of 
our communities in the country. So I 
hope that at a time when we are con-
fronting this threat, we can work to-
gether. That includes the Speaker and 
the minority leader here, all of us to-
gether to try to solve this problem. It 
is not a time to play politics. It is a 
time for us to work together in the Na-
tion’s interest. 
Keeping the American people safe 
and healthy and keeping our economy 
strong should be a shared bipartisan 
goal. I hope our colleagues—all of our 
colleagues—will keep that in mind, 
just as we did when we worked with 
President Obama in 2014. 
While the American people are right-
ly taking precautions to protect them-
selves and their loved ones, it is impor-
tant to remember there is no reason to 
panic. Preparation, yes; panic, no. 
The leaders at the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and the Department of 
Health and Human Services continue 
to remind all of us that the risk for the 
average American remains low, and the 
best defense against the virus is to use 
the same personal hygiene practices 
that our mother taught us when we 
were young. To help communicate 
what those practices are, as well as 
other information, my office has cre-
ated a unique web page on my official 
website, cornyn.senate.gov. This will 
serve as a platform to provide informa-
tion to all Texans who have questions 
about the virus and may be of interest 
to anybody who is concerned about 
what the government is doing to deal 
with the virus. If you are looking for 
information on how to prevent the 
spread of the virus, what Congress is 
doing to help, where you can find the 
latest number of cases in Texas, we 
have compiled all of the relevant links 
in one place. 
I know I speak on behalf of all Tex-
ans 
when 
I 
thank 
the 
dedicated 
healthcare professionals around the 
State and around the Nation for pro-
viding the highest quality care for peo-
ple who come down with the virus. I 
am grateful for everyone who is unified 
in this fight and who are working to 
stop the spread of the virus and, ulti-
mately, develop a vaccine. 
On one final note, let me say a word 
about my friend and colleague Senator 
CRUZ. Over the weekend, he announced 
he would self-quarantine after coming 
into contact with someone who was 
later 
determined 
to 
have 
the 
coronavirus. I want to thank him for 
having the courage to step forward and 
to do what any one of us should do if 
we are exposed to somebody with the 
coronavirus, if we know it: to monitor 
our health and make sure we don’t 
spread it to others and to seek care 
from a healthcare professional should 
we begin to come down with worrisome 
symptoms. 
His is a great reminder for all Ameri-
cans to take this potential risk seri-
ously and that we should all be joined 
together to do everything we can to 
keep 
our 
communities 
safe 
and 
healthy. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk

Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The Senator from Ohio. 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I appre-
ciate the comments of my friend from 
Texas. I only heard part of them, but I 
appreciate his interest and what we 
need 
to 
do 
to 
deal 
with 
this 
coronavirus. I hear so often in this 
body that it is about the economic 
issues, which to be sure it is, as you 
know in Utah and Senator CORNYN 
knows. But when I hear the President’s 
response on what to do—first, I know 
that people are angry in Ohio and I 
think elsewhere that the President has 
waited so long to act. 
I know people are angry when they 
find out that the President made major 
cuts to the Centers for Disease Control, 
which the Presiding Officer knows is 
the best public health agency probably 
in the history of the world, combined 
with our public health departments at 
NIH and the FDA and National Insti-
tute 
for 
Occupational 
Safety 
and 
Health in Cincinnati—all of this in-
credible public health infrastructure 
safety net we have built in this coun-
try bipartisanly through decades and 
decades and decades. 
I know people are unhappy when they 
learn about the President eliminating 
the position at the White House of the 
admiral physician who ran our effort to 
always be trying to anticipate a public 
health outbreak, a pandemic of sorts. I

don’t know whether or not we are in 
one. I don’t think we know that. 
I am not an alarmist or panicky in 
any way, but I know people realize we 
had such a late start on this because of 
the President’s actions over the last 3 
years. 
The issue is not to bail out more cor-
porations. The issue is not to give 
money to the cruise ship companies, 
for gosh sakes, which is one part of the 
President’s rhetoric tweet proposals. 
The cruise ship industry is almost ex-
clusively foreign-owned. Why take tax 
dollars and shovel them into the cruise 
industry? 
Instead of focusing on large corpora-
tions, which is something the Presi-
dent always does—I understand that is 
what he comes from, who he is, and 
who his supporters are—instead of fo-
cusing there, we should be focusing on 
individuals, and that means starting 
with a sick leave policy and sick days. 
Think about how hard it is for all of 
us in this body—think about somebody 
making $12 an hour and living alone or 
living with a child or living with a 
spouse, whoever, making $12 an hour 
with no benefits and they get sick. 
They think, let’s see, do I go to work— 
if I go to work sick, I may get worse, 
and I may infect my colleagues and 
other employees—or do I stay home 
and give up that $100 of a $12-an-hour 
job? I am paying $700 a month in rent. 
Can I give up that $100 or $200 or $300 
over 2 or 3 days? 
There are so many Americans who 
are sick who wrestle with that decision 
every single day. This is an oppor-
tunity. Senator MURRAY worked on a 
bill. I worked on this bill with her for 
a good while. I just spoke with Con-
gresswoman 
DELAURO
from 
Con-
necticut about working on legislation 
to provide emergency relief right now. 
We can do this today. I know the Pre-
siding Officer has been open-minded 
about things like this. We can make 
this bipartisan. We can have imme-
diate 14-day help as part of our package 
that we already voted on and then have 
a long-term, 7-day sick day policy 
where you earn those benefits. As you 
work, you earn that—up to 7-day sick 
day policy. Every other industrialized, 
wealthy country in the world has it. It 
makes safer, healthier workplaces and 
safer, healthier workers. It will mean 
good help and stronger families—all 
the kinds of things a sick day policy 
would mean to our country. 
I am hopeful that rather than shovel 
money to corporations, we will spend 
that money on individuals, on people, 
on workers and their workplace. It 
could make all the difference in the 
world, not just in addressing this 
coronavirus public health crisis today 
but in preventing these kinds of crises 
in the future. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The senior assistant legislative clerk

COLLINS, and Senator CASSIDY to have 
a colloquy. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

f 
PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, as 
most of my colleagues know, I hold a 
meeting in each of Iowa’s 99 counties 
every year for Q&A with my constitu-
ents. Over the last couple of years, 
without fail, Iowans have brought up 
the skyrocketing prices of prescription 
drugs. People all over my State, in-
cluding farmers, factory workers, and 
especially senior citizens, have raised 
the concern that pharmacy bills have 
been ballooning. 
I will say, Iowans are always inter-
ested in hearing about solutions, and 
they are looking for solutions on this 
issue from Congress, but not a single 
one of these people who bring this issue 
up cares about the partisan politics of 
the issue. Iowans just want Congress to 
act. This is my 40th year of taking 
questions in our 99 counties—although, 
as of now, only 14. Rarely have I heard 
so much unanimity when it comes to 
this issue, but on prescription drug 
prices, it is unanimous. Republicans, 
Democrats, and Independents alike all 
want us to take action, and the data, 
both polling and otherwise, bears out 
our constituents’ concerns. 
As I highlighted last week, right here 
in this position on the Senate floor, a 
new study shows that pharmaceutical 
prices have increased 31⁄2 times the rate 
of inflation in recent years. People are 
paying more than double what they 
paid in the year 2007 for drugs treating 
conditions from MS to diabetes and ev-
erything in between. The lack of trans-
parency and the enormous subsidy in-
centives are driving these price hikes— 
perverse incentives that we have in 
law. If they were not intended to be 
perverse, they are incentives people 
have found out how to benefit from. 
This is because the government’s 
spigot is all the way open for the big 
pharmaceutical companies or—how we 
say it around here—Big Pharma. Of 
course, when this happens, taxpayers 
get ripped off. It happens because we 
pay a lot of money—I think about $138 
billion—for Medicare and Medicaid. We 
pay at least that much. So, when you 
have 5- to 10-percent increases on Janu-
ary 1, you can see willy-nilly, on the 
judgment of Big Pharma, that tax-
payers are paying a heck of a lot more. 
I know all of my colleagues want to 
do something about this, and I know 
the administration wants to do some-
thing about it. In fact, let me say to 
the administration that I have been in-
volved in this as the chairman of this 
committee since just a year ago Janu-
ary. The administration has given a 
major speech, and the Secretary of 
HHS has taken major action going way 
back to June of 2018. So we all know 
that our colleagues and our adminis-
tration know that something needs to 
be done. 
We are fortunate that, just yester-
day, the White House published five 
principles that the administration can 
get behind for reducing prescription 
drug costs. Our legislation in the Sen-
ate fits the bill, or the principles, that 
were laid out in that op-ed piece. The 
Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction 
Act is the name of our legislation, and 
it addresses those principles. More im-
portantly, it is the only option that 
can get 60 votes in the U.S. Senate. 
Many Americans are reading about 
the coronavirus issue. It scares our 
constituents. We don’t know what kind 
of drugs might come into the market 
to help treat the disease. Senator CAS-
SIDY, who will soon speak, is an expert 
on that. He can address those issues for 
anybody who wants them addressed. 
Yet, if our bill becomes law, we know 
that folks who are on Medicare will not 
face sticker shock at the drugstore 
counter. Not only is that important in 
its being a comforting thought in the 
short term, as we face the coronavirus, 
but it is important in the long term, 
when we inevitably encounter another 
novel outbreak. 
It took a long time to hammer out 
the Prescription Drug Pricing Reduc-
tion Act. I thank Senator WYDEN for 
sticking it out with me and working in 
good faith for the benefit of all of our 
constituents so we could produce a bi-
partisan bill. His determination as well 
as the leadership of many of my col-
leagues, like Senators CASSIDY, COL-
LINS, and DAINES, have further im-
proved the legislation. We have a bill. 
We have bipartisan support, and we 
have White House support. We also 
have the opportunity. The bottom line 
is, let’s act. 
I thank my colleagues for joining me 
in this effort. 
I yield to my colleague Senator COL-
LINS. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maine. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, first, I 
express my appreciation to the chair-
man of the Committee on Finance, 
Senator GRASSLEY, not only for his 
leadership but also for his persistence 
on an issue that affects so many Amer-
icans, and that is the soaring price of 
prescription drugs. 
Three committees—the Committee 
on Finance, the Committee on Health, 
Education, Labor, and Pensions, and 
the Committee on the Judiciary—have 
all advanced bipartisan legislation to 
reform our broken drug pricing system. 
The Aging Committee, which I chair, 
has held eight drug pricing hearings 
which have highlighted the burden of 
soaring prices and the manipulation of 
the market by individuals like the in-
famous Martin Shkreli. It is now past 
time for us to move forward to the Sen-
ate floor to debate these bills that have

bipartisan support and that have gar-
nered the approval of three major com-
mittees. 
The Finance bill, which Senator 
GRASSLEY
has crafted with Senator 
WYDEN and others and of which I am 
proud to be a cosponsor, makes crucial 
improvements to Medicare Part D, 
such as protecting seniors with an out- 
of-pocket spending cap as well as in-
cluding cost control measures, such as 
an inflationary cap to limit pharma-
ceutical price hikes. 
In one of the hearings that the Aging 
Committee held, it heard testimony 
that was heartbreaking from a former 
teacher with multiple myeloma who 
had to refinance her home in order to 
cover the cost of her $250,000 cancer 
medication. We heard example after ex-
ample. 
I will never forget my standing in the 
pharmacy line in Bangor, ME, where I 
live, and ahead of me was a couple who 
had just been told that the couple’s 
copay was $111. 
The husband turned to his wife and 
said: Honey, we just can’t afford that. 
They walked away—away from the 
medication that one of them needed. 
I asked the pharmacist: How often 
does this happen? 
He told me that it happens every day. 
We have to take action. That experi-
ence led me to author legislation that 
became law that prohibited gag clauses 
that were preventing pharmacists from 
advising their patients, their cus-
tomers, on whether or not there was a 
less expensive way to purchase their 
prescription drugs. I am proud to say 
that this legislation is now law, but 
there is much more that we need to do. 
The Committee on Health, Edu-
cation, Labor, and Pensions, on which I 
serve, has incorporated more than 14 
measures to increase price competition 
in 
its 
legislation 
on 
lowering 
healthcare costs. I know the Presiding 
Officer is a member of that committee 
as well. I am pleased to say that the 
bill includes major portions of the Bio-
logic Patent Transparency Act, which 
is a bill that I authored with Senator 
TIM KAINE. It is intended to prevent 
drug manufacturers from gaming the 
patent system. 
Now, patents are very important. 
They help to spur innovation, and that 
period of exclusivity encourages drug 
manufacturers to invest more into life-
saving drugs. Yet the fact is, when the 
patent has expired, generics should be 
allowed to come to the market and 
drive down the costs. According to 
former FDA Commissioner Scott Gott-
lieb, if all of the biosimilars—those are 
generics for biologic drugs—that had 
been approved by the FDA had been 
successfully marketed in our country 
in a timely fashion, Americans would 
have saved more than $4.5 billion in 
2017. 
A biosimilar version of HUMIRA, the 
world’s best-selling drug, has been on 
the market in Europe for more than a 
year, while American patients must 
wait until 2023. We simply cannot allow 
this kind of abuse of the patent system 
to continue. 
The Judiciary Committee has also 
advanced proposals to empower the 
Federal Trade Commission to take 
more aggressive action against anti-
competitive behaviors. Last month, the 
FTC charged the infamous Martin 
Shkreli 
with 
an 
anticompetitive 
scheme of setting an increase of more 
than 4,000 percent overnight for the 
lifesaving drug DARAPRIM. That was 
the focus of an investigation on the 
Aging Committee that I led with 
former Senator Claire McCaskill. I ap-
plaud the FTC for taking action, and 
we simply must give them more au-
thority and the resources to pursue 
these kinds of anticompetitive cases 
that drive up the cost of prescription 
drugs. 
Finally, I hope that we have the op-
portunity to debate other worthy pro-
posals, including one that Senator SHA-
HEEN and I have introduced to lower 
the skyrocketing price of insulin. 
I want to commend the administra-
tion for today releasing a new plan to 
drive down the cost of insulin for Medi-
care beneficiaries. The fact is, between 
2012 and 2016, the average price of insu-
lin nearly doubled. According to the 
Health Care Cost Institute, the price of 
an average 40-day supply of insulin rose 
from $344 in 2012 to $666 in 2016. There 
is no justification for that. Insulin was 
isolated nearly 100 years ago, and while 
there are different varieties of insulin, 
it is still insulin. 
As cochairs of the Senate Diabetes 
Caucus, Senator SHAHEEN and I have 
introduced legislation which creates a 
new pricing model for insulin, and our 
bill would hold pharmacy benefit man-
agers, pharmaceutical companies, and 
insurers accountable for surging insu-
lin prices by incentivizing reductions 
in list prices. 
For the most popular insulins, this 
would result in as much as a 75-percent 
decrease in prices on average. Whether 
you are insured or you are paying out 
of pocket, you would benefit from that 
significant decline in the price if you 
need insulin to control your diabetes. 
Congress has a tremendous oppor-
tunity to deliver a decisive victory in 
both lowering healthcare costs and in 
improving healthcare for the people in 
my State of Maine and throughout our 
country. 
Let’s not delay any longer. We must 
act on prescription drug legislation 
without further delay. We have three 
committees that have produced bills, 
and I believe this should be a priority 
for this Chamber. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
BLACKBURN). The Senator from Lou-
isiana. 
Mr. CASSIDY. Madam President, I 
am going to speak about the drug af-
fordability act, what people in Wash-
ington call the Grassley-Wyden bill. 
I am renaming that bill. I am going 
to rename that bill to what I call the 
‘‘Making Coronavirus Medicines Af-
fordable Act,’’ and I want to address 
drug affordability from the perspective 
of coronavirus and address it from the 
perspective of a physician. 
First, people ask: How is this dif-
ferent than regular flu? Ten thousand 
people die a year from flu. Why is this 
so different from that? 
Well, again, as a physician, let me 
speak to that. Each of us, however old 
we are, have been exposed to flu, either 
by the flu vaccine or a flu infection, as 
many years as we have been alive. So 
when someone is exposed to the flu, 
they have a whole kind of armamen-
tarium of antibodies. When the flu 
virus comes into your body, those anti-
bodies mobilize, and it is not an exact 
fit to block the effects of the flu virus, 
but it is a pretty good fit. So for an in-
fection which otherwise might cause 
problems, the effect is blunted and the 
symptoms are either absent or mini-
mized. 
As it turns out, the flu virus kills the 
very young, who have never before 
been exposed to the flu virus before, or 
the very old, whose immune systems 
are no longer working as well. Even 
though they have been previously ex-
posed, their body is more vulnerable. 
Now, as for coronavirus, nobody’s 
body has ever seen that before. For ev-
eryone, this is a brand-new infection, 
and there is not a library book of 
immunologic responses that enable us 
to fight back against this virus. For all 
of us, if you will, it is a sucker punch 
to our health. We turn around, and, 
boom, it hits us. 
Now, in terms of who it can kill, 
again, it seems to cause problems in 
newborns—the very young—but it also 
causes problems not just in the very 
old but in the older but not so very old. 
In China we have learned that if 
someone is over 50 and they have an 
underlying medical condition, they are 
at increased risk. If you are over 60, 
you are at even more risk. So unlike 
influenza, where typically the person 
who dies would be 75 or 85 and in a 
nursing home, in terms of coronavirus, 
it might be somebody with high blood 
pressure or diabetes, heart disease, 
cancer, or a lung disease, who is other-
wise living life, walking around the 
streets. They get hit with this virus, 
and, all of a sudden, they have a prob-
lem. 
Now, we are going to find a cure. 
Sooner or later, we will come up with 
medicines that help somebody who is 
infected get well. The question is, Will 
those medicines be available to you? 
That is what we need to be concerned 
about. 
So what does it mean? Well, first 
there have been reports that both be-
cause of the infection raging through 
China and a decision by India, it is pos-
sible that some of these drugs will not 
be available. 
In China, they make the raw ingredi-
ents that are shipped to India, and they 
make the medicines. Well, China is not 
producing as many of the raw ingredi-
ents, and India has put an embargo on 
the export of some of those drugs to 
the United States.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1689 
March 11, 2020 
At least of the drugs they have em-
bargoed that I saw a list of recently, 
none of those medicines are medicines 
that we think might ultimately help 
fight coronavirus. So even though we 
have a problem with supply chain, so 
far there is no evidence it will impact 
the ability of a medication, whenever 
it is discovered, to be available here in 
the United States. 
But there is another issue. Can the 
senior citizen who is most vulnerable 
afford the medicine? 
Let me put this up. 
Under the current structure of Medi-
care Part D, the senior citizen—the 
personal Medicare Part D—pays a cer-
tain amount of money until they go 
into the so-called catastrophic cov-
erage 
phase. 
Now, 
pharmaceutical 
manufacturers and pharmacy benefit 
managers manipulate that list price to 
more quickly move the senior citizen 
into her catastrophic phase, and when 
she is in her catastrophic phase of our 
Medicare Part D benefit, she must pay 
5 percent of whatever is the price of 
that drug. Even—imagine this—if that 
drug costs $1 million a year, she would 
have to pay 5 percent of it under the 
current structure of the Medicare Part 
D benefit. 
I just posted a video on my Facebook 
page, and an oncology nurse, Kathy at 
East Jefferson General Hospital in New 
Orleans, was speaking about how this 
benefit design, where the senior has to 
pay 5 percent, no matter the cost, is so 
harmful in terms of her ability to get 
certain cancer drugs to cancer pa-
tients. 
Now, imagine it is a coronavirus 
drug—a cure for coronavirus that we 
know is going to eventually be here, 
and it can be priced. You name the 
price; we are going to pay it. Or can 
we? Can someone afford 5 percent of 
$100,000 or 5 percent of $50,000? Is it 
imaginable that such a medication 
would be priced as such? 
It is totally imaginable. 
We need to enact what the chairman 
of the committee calls the Grassley- 
Wyden bill but which I call the ‘‘Mak-
ing Coronavirus Drugs Affordable Act.’’ 
What we would do with this bill is 
change the Part D benefit so that when 
a senior pays up to a certain amount, 
period, it is stopped. She or he pays no 
more. And no matter how much that 
coronavirus drug is priced, she or he 
will not pay above a certain amount. 
If they price it at $100,000, under cur-
rent law you are paying 5 percent of 
that. Under this law, you would not. 
The out-of-pocket exposure, if you will, 
is capped. By the way, it also caps it 
for the taxpayer, which saves you and 
me as taxpayers—all of us as tax-
payers—a heck of a lot of money as we 
attempt to balance the Federal budget 
and as we attempt to preserve the life 
of the Medicare Program. 
So I will point out that we are going 
to have a cure for coronavirus sooner 
or later, but if a senior citizen or any-
one cannot afford that cure, it is as if 
the cure had never been invented. We 
need both for the cure to be invented 
and we also need for it to be affordable. 
Otherwise, it would not be available. 
By the way, somebody may tell you 
they are supporting another bill either 
in the House of Representatives or here 
in the Senate. This is the only bill out 
there which is bipartisan. This is the 
only bill out there which has a chance 
to pass. This is the only bill that can 
protect senior citizens, not only by 
being good policy but by being signed 
into law by the President of the United 
States. The President of the United 
States has signaled that he, indeed, 
would sign this law. 
Now, the ‘‘Making Coronavirus Drug 
Affordable Act’’ does other things as 
well. It caps out-of-pocket expenses. It 
lets patients pay over time. If they 
know they are going to have a big 
amount in January, they don’t have to 
pay it all in January. They can pay it 
a little bit in January, February, 
March, and all the way through the end 
of the year. It protects patients from 
price gouging, but it still preserves in-
centives for these cures to be invented. 
As we look for a holistic response to 
the coronavirus infection, we must 
keep in mind that drugs have to be af-
fordable. So I am asking all my fellow 
Senators 
to 
support 
the 
‘‘Making 
Coronavirus Drugs Affordable Act,’’ 
also known as the Grassley-Wyden bill, 
and for Senator MCCONNELL to bring it 
to the floor. 
With that, I introduce my colleague 
from Montana, STEVE DAINES, to con-
tinue this discussion. 
Mr. DAINES. Senator CASSIDY, thank 
you—Dr. CASSIDY. It is a really good 
thing to have a physician serving on 
the floor of the U.S. Senate and your 
additional insight you have as a physi-
cian. Thank you. 
Madam President, I am grateful for 
not only Senator CASSIDY’s leadership 
but also Senator GRASSLEY’s on this 
very important issue impacting mil-
lions of Montanans and Americans 
across our country. 
I also want to thank my colleagues 
who spoke on this issue earlier today. 
When I am back home in Montana, I 
hear the same concerns in virtually 
every corner of our State. Whether I 
am down in southeast Montana, in 
places like Ekalaka or Baker; or up in 
northeast Montana, in places like 
Westby and in places like Sidney and 
Plentywood; and if we go out to the 
northwest part of our State, to places 
like Eureka, Libby; or in southwest 
Montana, where I am from, in Boze-
man, Belgrade, or anywhere you go, I 
am hearing that Montanans are con-
cerned with the high cost of prescrip-
tion drugs. That is why I have made it 
one of my top priorities in Congress 
and on the Senate Finance Committee 
to lower prescription drug costs for 
Montanans and for folks across the 
country. 
Year after year, prescription drug 
out-of-pocket costs are reaching sky- 
high levels. They are impacting our 
seniors, our veterans, our families, and 
our working men and women. It is 
truly heart-wrenching to hear the sto-
ries of folks who are rationing or even 
skipping doses of daily medications be-
cause they can’t afford the out-of-pock-
et costs. The American people are 
struggling under the burden of these 
out-of-control, high costs of prescrip-
tion drugs, and they need relief. 
That is why I am grateful to be work-
ing with Chairman GRASSLEY on the 
Finance Committee and my colleagues 
here today in a bipartisan fashion to 
lower costs, improve competition, and 
get our patients more bang for the 
buck. The complex drug pricing system 
has allowed Big Pharma and these 
pharmacy benefit managers—you may 
have seen the chart that Senator CAS-
SIDY
just laid out showing some of 
these complexities. These pharmacy 
benefit managers are the middle men 
responsible for negotiating drug prices, 
but in doing so, they take advantage of 
the secrecy of the pricing supply chain. 
The bipartisan reforms we are fight-
ing for and advocating for today would 
help fix the secrecy and save taxpayers 
more than $80 billion. These reforms 
will cap out-of-pocket costs in Medi-
care, providing our seniors with en-
hanced financial security. One of the 
great sources of anxiety for our seniors 
is financial security. When you think 
about it, their financial situation could 
be devastated with the out-of-pocket 
costs for a single prescription drug. 
Our efforts would reform the pay-
ment incentives and ensure that Big 
Pharma and the pharmacy benefit 
managers have more skin in this game. 
These reforms are the product of over 1 
year of bipartisan negotiations. Al-
though this may not be what you hear 
on the news, bipartisan compromise is 
not dead. I am pleased to see my col-
leagues putting politics aside and doing 
what is right for this country. Low-
ering costs is more than just figures 
and numbers and spreadsheets. This is 
about keeping our families healthy 
without having to worry about how 
much it is going to cost or if they can 
even afford it. This is about getting re-
lief for the retiree who has worked and 
saved their entire life only to see the 
dollars they earned go down the drain 
because of the high cost of prescription 
drugs. 
President Trump is ready to sign pre-
scription drug reform. He is committed 
to getting this done on behalf of the 
American people. He hears it when he 
travels 
around 
the 
country. 
With 
strong support from this administra-
tion, I am confident we can achieve 
some major reforms for the American 
people. 
Montanans 
and 
Americans 
across the country want to see reform, 
and that is why I am standing here 
today, fighting for it. 
Let’s move past the congressional 
gridlock and get this done. We had a 
good, strong, bipartisan vote out of the 
Senate Finance Committee, which will 
allow us to take a vote here on the 
floor of the U.S. Senate. Truly, Repub-
licans, Democrats, and Independents

can deliver a historic victory for the 
American people, and I will continue 
working to get this bill on President 
Trump’s desk. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
PERDUE). The Senator from Iowa. 
f 
WASTEFUL SPENDING 
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, with 
spring approaching, the days are get-
ting 
longer 
and 
temperatures 
are 
warming up. Many are hitting the gym, 
trying to get that summer bod before 
heading to the beach, including some 
turtles. That is right, your tax dollars 
actually paid for a study that put tur-
tles on treadmills. 
So here we have our turtles on a 
treadmill. To no one’s surprise, it turns 
out that turtles are really, really slow. 
OK. That is what our tax dollars went 
to. In fact, this wasteful study found 
that turtles moved at nearly the same 
pace as dead turtles on a treadmill. 
Aren’t you glad that Washington bu-
reaucrats used your hard-earned dol-
lars to conduct this study? Good grief, 
folks. 
How many of your tax dollars went 
to this study, exactly? Well, folks, your 
guess is actually as good as mine be-
cause there is no legal obligation for 
most Federal agencies to publicly dis-
close the price of government projects, 
even though the American taxpayers 
are paying for them. Folks, this is your 
money—your money. Shouldn’t you 
have a right to know how it is being 
spent? 
It has been said before, and I surely 
believe it: Government functions best 
when it operates in the open. This is 
the basis of Sunshine Week, which be-
gins this Sunday. Sunshine Week is 
celebrated every year in March to re-
mind us of just how important it is to 
have government transparency, espe-
cially when it comes to how our tax 
dollars are being spent. 
Transparency really is fundamental 
to the principles upon which our Na-
tion was founded. The people have 
power to affect the decisions made by 
those of us who are elected leaders, 
and, in turn, Congress has the author-
ity to hold accountable the millions of 
unelected Washington bureaucrats who 
ultimately write the rules and regula-
tions that impact nearly every aspect 
of our lives and decide how our tax-
payer dollars are spent. 
This year, I have a couple of bright 
ideas to shine some light on how Wash-
ington is spending your money. Let’s 
talk about those darn government 
boondoggles—those 
Federal 
projects 
that are billions of dollars over budget 
and years behind schedule. Frankly, we 
know nothing about them because the 
government agencies aren’t required to 
report this information to you. 
Well, I have a bill to help shed some 
light on these costly monstrosities. My 
Billion Dollar Boondoggle Act would 
require an annual report listing every 
single taxpayer-funded project that is 
$1 billion or more over budget or 5 
years or more behind schedule. This 
will make it impossible for Washington 
bureaucrats to continue throwing our 
tax dollars into bottomless money pits 
without being noticed. 
Unfortunately, it is not just the bil-
lions wasted on boondoggles being kept 
secret. It is the cost of the Federal 
projects. So I have proposed a bill that 
requires every project supported with 
Federal funds to include a pricetag 
with the amount that is paid by tax-
payers. That way, when your money is 
being spent to put turtles on a tread-
mill—the ones I mentioned to you ear-
lier—you, the taxpayer, can decide if 
the price is right. 
Of course, the waste doesn’t stop 
there. Did you know that Federal agen-
cies spend over $1.4 billion every year 
on advertising and public relations? 
This includes—you will love this—more 
than a quarter of a million dollars for 
costumed mascots like Sammy Soil 
and Milkshake the cow—a quarter of a 
million 
dollars. 
There 
was 
nearly 
$10,000 to produce a zombie apocalypse 
survival guide. Yes, folks, I am not jok-
ing. And there was $30,000 for a martian 
New Year’s Eve party and hundreds of 
thousands of dollars on tote bags, 
stress balls, fidget spinners, and other 
trinkets. 
Well, folks, thankfully, the Senate 
Homeland Security and Governmental 
Affairs Committee is voting today on 
my bill, which forces agencies to dis-
close exactly how much they are spend-
ing on all of these government gim-
micks. Folks, it is time we bag the 
swag and end this unnecessary tax-
payer-funded propaganda. 
With our national debt now exceed-
ing $23 trillion, there is literally no 
better time than Sunshine Week to 
start shedding more light on how 
Washington is managing or maybe, in 
this case, mismanaging your money. 
The only reason to keep taxpayers in 
the dark is that these spending deci-
sions can’t withstand the scrutiny. 
And, folks, that is exactly why sun-
light is the best disinfectant. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. 
LANKFORD. 
Mr. 
President, 
there are a lot of things going on right 
now in DC and a lot of moving targets. 
A lot of Americans are looking closely 
at what is happening with the COVID– 
19 virus. We are tracking what is hap-
pening overseas in Afghanistan and 
multiple other issues on the stock mar-
ket, as well as what is happening with 
oil and gas right now. 
We are spending a little bit of time, 
in the middle of all those things, to 
also say that we can’t lose track of 
structural issues in government, to see 
if we can work on those issues that are, 
right now, in front of us, but we also 
have to look at long-term issues, to 
look at basic government transparency 
and basic accountability for govern-
ment. 
So I want to highlight—several of my 
colleagues are here, as well, high-
lighting some of the things that are ac-
tually on the floor or have moved re-
cently or we think we can move on 
those. One of those things is the 
GREAT Act. This is a bipartisan bill 
that deals with basic transparency for 
grants. 
If you go back 20 years ago, the Fed-
eral Government gave away very few 
grants. Now, $600 billion a year is just 
for grants. My colleague, JONI ERNST 
from Iowa, just highlighted some of 
those wasteful grants that are out 
there that, as we go through them, we 
say we can try to get those one at a 
time or we can try to get a system in 
place where all grants have to go 
through a centralized data system 
where we can actually all look at the 
data and compare it across the govern-
ment to basically look for areas of in-
efficiency. That is what the GREAT 
Act does. It creates standard data ele-
ments so that we can look at how the 
money 
is 
being 
spent—America’s 
money—so we can actually evaluate it. 
That 
has 
overwhelmingly 
already 
passed. We are grateful to get that 
done this year. 
Another one we were able to get done 
this year that has passed the Senate 
but has not yet passed the House is 
providing 
accountability 
through 
transparency. Now, this may seem 
super simple, but let me just begin 
with the most basic principle. No small 
business owner in America gets up 
every day and reads the Federal Reg-
ister. It just doesn’t happen anywhere. 
If you are running a small business, 
you are running your small business. 
You are not getting up every day and 
reading the Federal Register to see the 
latest regulation. Even if you did, with 
the pages and pages and pages of regu-
lations there, you can’t make sense of 
it. This basic providing of account-
ability through transparency asks a 
simple question: Can we force the agen-
cies, when they actually do a new regu-
lation, to condense it down to 100 words 
or less in plain English so that you can 
actually figure out what this regula-
tion is trying to do, so when you see a 
regulation come out, you can actually 
understand it without having to hire 
an attorney to go interpret it for you? 
That has overwhelmingly already 
passed the Senate, and we are waiting 
for that to pass the House, as well— 
basic simplification of some of the gov-
ernment entities, in trying to be able 
to help out. 
We passed by a majority—and it has 
already been signed into law—the one 
dealing 
with 
representative 
payee 
fraud. Now, again, this was a simple 
piece that was just needed in govern-
ment. We discovered that if someone is 
a trustee for a Federal retiree for their 
retirement account and, as a trustee, 
they stole the money out of that per-
son’s account, we couldn’t actually en-
force the law on them. We could in sev-
eral other areas, if it was Social Secu-
rity or if it was disability, but we 
couldn’t on Federal retirees. 
So we were able to get a bipartisan 
agreement to pass this to take care of

that. It was a very simple bill, but it is 
the way we need to react when we see 
a problem—to actually go to solve that 
problem rather than take forever to do 
it. 
Speaking of ‘‘forever’’ to be able to 
solve it, what I think is the most basic 
government transparency piece we can 
put out there to force real dialogue on 
budget issues is a simple bill we have 
on shutdown prevention. If we can end 
government shutdowns, we can actu-
ally have more debate on budget issues 
here in this room, where it should 
occur, and take the pressure off of Fed-
eral workers and Federal families fac-
ing a shutdown and furloughs. 
MAGGIE HASSAN and I have a very 
simple bill. The bill simply says: If we 
get to the end of the fiscal year and if 
we don’t have all the issues resolved on 
our budget, we continue debating those 
things here. We remain in session 7 
days a week until it is actually re-
solved. But in the meantime, Federal 
workers and their families are unaf-
fected because the budget automati-
cally continues at last year’s budget 
level until we get things resolved here. 
But in the meantime, we can’t go home 
until we actually solve that problem. 
It is a straightforward solution to 
say: We are not going to have govern-
ment shutdowns. We are not going to 
have chaos across the whole country. 
We have had 21 government shutdowns 
in 40 years. We have to stop that chaos. 
So it stops that chaos, and it puts the 
pressure where the pressure needs to 
be—on us. When we finish our work, 
then we can move to the next thing. 
But if the budget work is not done, the 
most basic elements of those appro-
priations bills, if they are not finished, 
we remain in session 7 days a week 
until they are finished. 
We need to find ways to be more effi-
cient as a government. Government 
shutdowns waste money by the bil-
lions. ROB PORTMAN and his team did a 
remarkable study to look and see how 
much money was wasted in the last 
shutdown, and it was in the billions of 
dollars, and not even every agency 
turned in all their information to ROB 
PORTMAN and his team. 
We can’t keep losing money that 
way. We can’t keep that chaos going 
for all the Federal workers and their 
families. We should have arguments 
about the budget. We have big ones 
that need to be resolved, but we should 
keep it here. 
So, this week, as we pause for just a 
moment on all the other big issues that 
are pressing on us right now, I am 
grateful that we are also pausing for a 
moment to say: What are the big issues 
that we should look long term on, and 
how do we solve some of those issues 
for the future, as well, to make govern-
ment more efficient and try to make 
government more transparent? 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I am 
here to join my colleagues in speaking 
on the floor in advance of government 
Sunshine Week, but before I do that, 
let me commend my colleague from 
Oklahoma for his comments about the 
need for more transparency in govern-
ment 
and 
particularly 
our 
grantmaking process. 
We have made some progress on 
that—most recently, the DATA Act. 
His 
predecessor 
in 
Congress, 
Tom 
Coburn, worked on this issue, and we 
came up with legislation when I was on 
the other side of Pennsylvania Avenue 
at the Office of Management and Budg-
et to put all grants and contracts on-
line, which was a start. But the DATA 
Act takes that to the next level to 
make sure there is uniformity in gov-
ernment. 
We still have difficulty with some 
agencies getting information out there, 
but he is absolutely right. It would 
make a difference because if people 
know how the money is being spent, it 
is much more likely to be spent wisely, 
all the way down to the ZIP Code in 
terms of where grants are going and 
what kind of Federal taxpayer dollars 
are being spent in our communities and 
whether it is being spent well. 
Government shutdowns, of course—I 
couldn’t agree more with my col-
league—have not worked to help make 
our government more efficient. In fact, 
we always spend more after the fact. 
Think about it. People were fur-
loughed, and, then, when they went 
back to work, they got backpay. Well, 
it would have been much better had 
they been there to provide the services 
to the taxpayers. 
You also just have a lot of disloca-
tion that is unfair and people who have 
to go to work who are essential em-
ployees. Think of our TSA employees— 
for those of you who travel in air-
ports—not getting paid. A lot of them 
had car payments or house payments 
they couldn’t make during the last 
government shutdown. It is just unfair. 
So we have to get at that. 
We have legislation that actually 
two-thirds of the Members of this side 
of the aisle have supported. Yet we 
have not been able to make that bipar-
tisan. So I appreciate the fact that my 
colleague from Oklahoma has a bipar-
tisan approach to that. We have tried 
for four or five Congresses now to pass 
legislation that simply says that at the 
end of the fiscal year, if you haven’t 
completed all the bills, then the gov-
ernment continues to operate, but 1 
percent of spending is cut every 120 
days, and every 90 days thereafter to 
give the Appropriations Committees 
here the incentive to get to work and 
to get the budget bills done. That, I 
think, would work. 
It used to be a bipartisan approach. 
It is not now. So I am interested in 
looking at other options, including 
what the Senator from Oklahoma was 
talking about in terms of providing 
more pressure on us here to get our 
work done because these shutdowns 
clearly haven’t worked to help make 
the government more efficient. They 
have just had the opposite impact. 
GOVERNMENT TRANSPARENCY 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, today 
there is a discussion about trans-
parency. I am going to talk about one 
that is maybe going to surprise some 
people, but it is about the lack of 
transparency and about $150 billion a 
year that is taxpayer money that is put 
into research and development. It is 
money that we, as taxpayers, pay to 
places like the National Institutes of 
Health. The National Institutes of 
Health does great research. So the Fed-
eral dollars go in there to try to de-
velop cures—as an example, for dis-
eases, but also for other healthcare re-
search. There is the National Science 
Foundation, which does a lot of re-
search on technology and research, and 
the Department of Energy, which does 
a lot of the basic research on science in 
our country. So I am going to focus on 
that funding today and a specific prob-
lem we have right now. It is about en-
suring the government remains ac-
countable to taxpayers. It is about en-
suring that hard-working American 
taxpayers know where their money is 
going, and it is about a specific issue of 
that money going to research that is 
then taken by other countries, particu-
larly by China, and the need for us to 
address that issue, in part, through 
transparency and, in part, through ac-
tually some new criminal statutes to 
be able to ensure that there is account-
ability. 
Last 
fall, 
the 
Permanent 
Sub-
committee on Investigations did a 
study. It was about a yearlong study. 
We looked at this issue of China’s tal-
ent recruitment programs and, more 
broadly, other countries, but, specifi-
cally, what China has been doing to 
find researchers over here in the 
United States whom they think are 
doing interesting work and recruiting 
those people to be able to provide that 
research and sometimes to have the 
person actually go to China to provide 
that research. 
The issue we focused on in our report 
was this theft of intellectual property 
at research institutions and at our col-
leges and universities. It was a shock-
ing report. We issued it late last year. 
It showed, as you probably know now 
from some of the press accounts that 
have arisen since then, that, in fact, 
China was recruiting individuals who 
were giving up their research that was 
taxpayer funded. 
China has made no secret of its goal 
to surpass the United States to be the 
world leader in scientific research, but 
that doesn’t mean they should use our 
research institutions here in America, 
paid for by us, to accomplish that goal. 
These talent recruitment programs— 
most notably, the Thousand Talents 
Program—recruits 
researchers 
at 
American universities and American 
research institutions to do the same re-
search, usually at shadow labs in 
China, in order to just transfer tax-
payer-funded research back to China. 
This is an issue that has been going 
on for two decades, we found out, and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE

March 11, 2020 
really kind of right under the nose of 
the FBI and others. The FBI testified 
at our hearing and said they readily ac-
knowledge that they were asleep at the 
switch, essentially, that they had not 
been on top of it, and they have only 
recently begun to focus on it. 
We have seen the results of that, by 
the way. Little was done to stop it, 
but, recently, there has been a lot of 
publicity. You probably know about 
the recent arrest of Dr. Charles Lieber 
at Harvard University. Dr. Lieber actu-
ally lied to Federal investigators about 
his participation in the plan, and that 
is what they have charged him with. 
Most recently, today, we heard about 
another one, Dr. James Lewis at West 
Virginia 
University, 
who 
pleaded 
guilty to fraudulently requesting time 
off to raise a newborn, when he was ac-
tually in China conducting research as 
part of his agreement with this same 
group, the Thousand Talents Plan. 
Now, this is a definite conflict of inter-
est. 
As an example, Professor Lieber is 
accused of accepting $50,000 a month 
from the Chinese talent recruitment 
program and, also, $150,000 in funding 
just for his expenses—now, remember, 
he is already being paid by Harvard— 
but also accepting $1.5 million to set up 
a shadow lab in China. He did not tell 
his employer, Harvard, about this. 
Again, he was not honest when talking 
to the Federal prosecutors, which is 
how he came to be charged. So the 
fraud that he was committing was not 
the charge because that is not a crimi-
nal offense. It needs to be one. 
With regard to the guy from West 
Virginia who just pleaded guilty yes-
terday, we don’t know all the details 
yet there, but we know that this, 
again, is research that was being done, 
we assume partly funded by taxpayers, 
and this talent recruitment program 
was able to get that research. 
So this can lead, obviously, to a real 
problem because it is helping to fuel 
not just the Chinese economy but also 
the Chinese military. Some of Pro-
fessor Lieber’s research, apparently, 
was done for our military, and, there-
fore, they got military research and, 
we assume, military secrets as well. 
So they provide a reputational risk 
to the universities we are talking 
about, of course, and so many others 
around the country. But it is also just 
unfair to taxpayers, because this is 
government funded for the benefit of 
America, not to one of our stiffest 
global competitors. 
So we are working with the Trump 
administration to ensure that we know 
where that taxpayer money is going 
and making sure it is going to benefit 
the United States of America. 
Along with my counterpart on the 
subcommittee on the Democratic side 
of the aisle, TOM CARPER from Dela-
ware, we plan to introduce bipartisan 
legislation that uses the key findings 
in our subcommittee report to ensure 
that our research enterprise is pro-
tected here in this country and also to 
ensure that it continues to be open and 
transparent and accountable but also 
secure. Our legislation does this in a 
few ways, and a lot of it has to do with 
more transparency. 
First, it creates a new cross-govern-
ment council at the Office of Manage-
ment and Budget to coordinate and 
streamline the grant-making process 
between Federal agencies so we know 
where the money is going and how it is 
being used. 
Right now, these agencies don’t talk 
to each other, and we don’t know much 
about the grant-making process. We 
need to make that transparent. Sun-
shine, I think, will be a very effective 
disinfectant here. 
Second, the bill makes it illegal to 
not tell the truth on a grant applica-
tion. Apparently, that happens all the 
time now. We requested some of these 
grant applications from the Thousand 
Talents Program. We weren’t able to 
get all the information we wanted, but 
we got enough to know that most of 
these contracts, apparently, have the 
individuals saying: OK, I will accept 
this money from the Chinese Govern-
ment through this program, but I will 
not tell my employer about it. On the 
grant application, they have to say 
that they will not reveal it. Obviously, 
that is defrauding the U.S. Govern-
ment. 
The third part of our legislation 
closes the loopholes exploited by China 
and other countries and empowers the 
U.S. State Department to deny visas to 
foreign researchers who seek to exploit 
the openness of our U.S. research en-
terprise to steal intellectual property 
and research from our universities and 
research institutions. 
Now, this is something that the State 
Department has worked with us on and 
has asked for. They are looking for ad-
ditional authority from us. When they 
know somebody is not here on a good- 
faith effort to do research but, rather, 
to take our research, they want to be 
able to act. 
Fourth, it requires research institu-
tions and universities to have basic 
safeguards against unauthorized access 
to sensitive technology. You would 
think that is already in place, but, ap-
parently, it is not. Also, it requires 
them to tell the State Department 
what technologies a foreign researcher 
will have access to on campus, so, 
again, we can start talking to each 
other, including folks at the State De-
partment, law enforcement folks, and 
people in our research institutions. 
Fifth, it directs the U.S. Government 
to work with our critical research part-
ners—think of Japan or Australia or 
the UK—to protect their research en-
terprises from Chinese theft as well. 
We are not interested in having U.S. 
taxpayer dollars go to do research here 
on which we then collaborate with a 
foreign government, an ally, and then 
that research is taken back to China or 
other countries. So we want more in-
formation about working with part-
ners, as well, to protect that important 
research. 
And, finally, it requires colleges and 
universities to report any gifts of 
$50,000 or more and empowers the De-
partment of Education to fine univer-
sities that repeatedly fail to disclose 
these gifts. Current law requires re-
porting at the level of $250,000. So if 
you get $250,000 from a foreign entity, 
you are supposed to report it. In our 
study we found, shockingly, that 70 
percent of U.S. universities consist-
ently failed to do that. So the univer-
sities don’t want to report the fact that 
they are getting money from foreign 
governments, but we need to know 
that. The taxpayers need to know that. 
Lowering the threshold from $250,000 
to $50,000 and increasing this trans-
parency, including adding the penalty, 
ensures that those schools will report. 
In my view, that will lead to account-
ability and what we are looking for, 
which is more information. 
Beyond these provisions, we are all 
going to have to do more to protect the 
U.S. research enterprise. My bill makes 
it clear that research institutions re-
ceiving taxpayer dollars have to do a 
better job giving the government just 
basic information about foreign re-
searchers they partner with. 
By the way, academics tend to agree. 
On Monday, the President of the Amer-
ican Council on Education in an op-ed 
agreed with our report’s recommenda-
tion that research institutions should 
establish a ‘‘know your collaborator’’ 
culture—know whom you are collabo-
rating with, know what their back-
ground is. 
Providing basic information about 
researchers and what they will have ac-
cess to on campus allows the State De-
partment to properly vet foreign re-
searchers before issuing them a visa. 
Frankly, it is hard to believe that uni-
versities aren’t already required to tell 
the U.S. State Department this infor-
mation, but they aren’t. 
A few universities and academic 
groups have raised concerns about the 
administrative burdens. We don’t want 
to unnecessarily burden any research 
institution, university, or college, but 
we do want the transparency. 
It is my hope that our research insti-
tutions will step up and do their part 
as patriots to help us ensure that our 
taxpayer-funded research does not fall 
into the wrong hands. Research univer-
sities need to take a hard look at what 
is happening on their own campuses. 
This threat is very real. If universities 
expect to continue to receive billions 
in taxpayer research dollars, Congress 
has to ensure the academic community 
is taking basic, commonsense steps to 
secure the research. I believe our legis-
lation is a balanced way to ensure that 
will happen. 
We talked earlier about the actions 
by college professors who have now 
been in the media. They have been 
charged by the FBI and others. One 
thing we do in this legislation, as well, 
is that we establish a new criminal law 
with regard to defrauding a university 
or defrauding the U.S. taxpayer.

S1693 
March 11, 2020 
Again, the reason these charges that 
we talked about earlier were able to be 
brought is not because of the fraud 
that was committed but because, in 
one case, someone lied about the rea-
son they were looking for leave, and, in 
the other case, someone lied to the FBI 
about whether they were involved in 
the program or not. So these were per-
jury issues, really, not in terms of the 
fraud. Our legislation also tightens 
that up. 
I think we all agree that the rela-
tionship we have with China is com-
plicated. There is some good, and there 
is some bad. In my view, it is in both of 
our countries’ interests to have a 
healthy relationship and have an ex-
change of new ideas and have the abil-
ity to collaborate where appropriate, 
but we cannot allow this continued 
theft of taxpayer-funded research. 
My hope is that this legislation will 
send a firm but fair signal to China to 
change their behavior, respect our laws 
when it comes to research, and see the 
wisdom of our research values here in 
the United States of openness, trans-
parency, reciprocity, integrity, and, 
most importantly, merit-based com-
petition. 
I encourage my colleagues to take a 
look at that legislation. We hope to in-
troduce it the week after next, when 
we are back from recess. We believe 
that this legislation will be incredibly 
important to ensure that we can pro-
tect this research that taxpayer dollars 
are funding. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. CRAMER. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the order for the quorum call 
be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, I rise 
today to join my colleagues in offering 
support for improving the way our gov-
ernment runs. What we are doing is we 
are fighting for a government that is 
led in an open, transparent way by 
elected leaders—elected leaders—who 
are accountable to the people who elect 
us. 
Reining in a bureaucracy that has 
run rampant has been a top priority of 
mine ever since coming to Congress. In 
fact, last year when I outlined my vi-
sion for serving in the Senate in my 
maiden speech, I vowed to take on the 
bureaucracy. Since coming to Wash-
ington, it has become abundantly clear 
to me that the bureaucracy has evolved 
into an unelected, unaccountable crea-
ture. 
When constituents back home reach 
out to my office for help, there is a 
good chance it has to do with an in-
transigent, unresponsive, or even an 
aggressive—an 
aggressive— 
confrontational bureaucrat who has 
forgotten that a public servant is actu-
ally supposed to serve the public; that 
is, the public made up of people—peo-
ple who elect officials. 
In many cases, the Federal Govern-
ment 
has 
codified 
the 
corruption, 
transforming from a group of civil 
servants carrying out our laws into a 
rogue body consumed with defending 
and in many cases expanding their 
power. This bureaucracy has turned in-
ternal guidance documents into infal-
lible law, placing the creation and im-
plementation of their policies and 
processes above the American people’s 
needs—in fact, in many cases, changing 
the actual laws they are supposed to be 
enforcing. This is something I look to 
address at every given opportunity be-
cause it is a problem I discover in al-
most every issue we seek to solve. 
I am going to start by talking a little 
bit about the Army Corps of Engineers. 
My efforts to take on this bureaucracy 
began almost immediately when I 
came to the Senate. President Trump, 
in fulfilling his promise to secure our 
border and keep America safe, declared 
a national emergency in order to expe-
dite the construction of physical bar-
riers along our southern border. Unfor-
tunately, the agency charged with exe-
cuting the building of this wall—that 
is, the Army Corps of Engineers—is not 
known for expediency or responsive-
ness. 
As a member of the Armed Services 
Committee and the Environment and 
Public 
Works 
Committee, 
both 
of 
which have direct jurisdiction over the 
Corps of Engineers, I exercised my con-
gressional 
oversight 
responsibilities 
and role by conducting a study of the 
Army Corps’ procurement process: how 
it awards contracts, how those compa-
nies have performed since being se-
lected, what they are paid for in their 
bidding or RFP process. My findings, 
simply, were horrifying. 
In a letter to President Trump, I de-
tailed how the Corps’ procurement 
process fails to foster competition— 
particularly when it comes to price and 
schedule—and disfavors new entrants 
and innovators into their process. 
As I was conducting the investiga-
tion that led to these findings, I was 
met with bureaucratic obstruction at 
almost 
every 
step, 
from 
bad-faith 
promises, to empty vows of coopera-
tion, to bureaucrats actually leaking 
my personal—my personal—emails to 
the media. Army Corps bureaucrats 
failed to meet even the most basic 
standards of good faith and cooperation 
in dealing with a Senator who sits on 
the committees that oversee them, as 
though their agency runs us instead of 
our having oversight over them. The 
correspondence they leaked was not 
even salacious or informative, really. 
It said nothing that I wasn’t already 
saying out loud. But I think that was 
what bothered them the most, is that I 
was saying it out loud. This was a co-
ordinated attempt to discourage me 
from continuing to dig into the bu-
reaucracy. As I told them then, if you 
are counting on 99 out of 100 people to 
walk away exasperated because of your 
delays, consider me the other 1. 
Such intimidation and such a break-
down in proper government action 
should be infuriating and horrifying to 
any civically minded person who be-
lieves in checks and balances and the 
ability to hold the bureaucracy ac-
countable. 
It is not my first encounter with bu-
reaucratic overreach, with an execu-
tive agency dipping its foot into the 
water of activism. During my time in 
the House of Representatives under the 
previous administration, the conserva-
tion advocacy group Ducks Unlimited 
was providing staff to the U.S. Depart-
ment of Agriculture’s Natural Re-
sources Conservation Service, embed-
ded right in their offices. This meant 
that taxpayer funds were supporting 
the work of advocacy staffers cam-
paigning for a State ballot measure to 
establish a slush fund that would ben-
efit their organization. The Federal 
Government was funding political ac-
tivists while those activists worked to 
pass a measure that would give them 
further funding. If that is not corrup-
tion, then nothing is, whether or not it 
is intended. If not for our efforts to 
shine light on such obvious corruption, 
their abuse would have gone un-
checked, and their power would have 
only grown. 
Somehow, the issue with the Natural 
Resources Conservation Services is not 
the most obvious example of bureau-
cratic abuse that North Dakotans have 
experienced. Over the years, the Fish 
and Wildlife Service has increasingly 
encroached on the rights of landowners 
who have perpetual wetland easements 
on their property. 
One particularly egregious case is the 
story of Mike Johansen, a farmer from 
Hope, ND. After a heavy rainfall year, 
the land flooded, leaving him unable to 
harvest and seed for the next planting 
season. He asked the Service for help, 
but due to poor guidance and enforce-
ment, the Service offered him nothing. 
In fact, after he dug a drain, the Serv-
ice cited him and dragged him to court. 
The legal fees and fines caused by these 
vague 
regulations 
written 
without 
clarity, oversight, or an appeals proc-
ess forced Mike to quit farming, sell 
his equipment, and borrow money just 
to get the funds he needed to defend 
himself in court against his govern-
ment. Thankfully, he won in court. He 
proved his case against the govern-
ment. But the cost was bankruptcy— 
bankruptcy. 
I had the privilege of hosting Interior 
Secretary Bernhardt so he could meet 
with Mike and North Dakota land-
owners who have experienced similar 
abuse. Since then, the Interior Depart-
ment has begun issuing updated guid-
ance to give our landowners clarity and 
a right to appeal overzealous bureau-
cratic action. 
I appreciate the Secretary’s timely 
action and his emphasis on being a bet-
ter neighbor, but this will only be suc-
cessful if Fish and Wildlife Service em-
ployees follow the spirit of the Sec-
retary’s actions to actually work with

landowners versus ruling over them. 
We are working closely with the De-
partment to make sure these regula-
tions work for our constituents, and I 
am hopeful this example concludes 
with a positive ending. But after every 
election, there is a new set of leaders. 
Frankly, I have been appalled at the 
reaction the bureaucracy has had to 
the Trump administration’s moving of 
the Bureau of Land Management from 
Washington, DC, to Grand Junction, 
CO, or a couple of USDA agencies mov-
ing from Washington, DC, to Kansas 
City, only so they can be closer to the 
resources they manage and the people 
they are supposed to be serving. The 
backlash has been incredible; the out-
cry, unbelievable. It is as though the 
bureaucracy is entitled to whatever 
they think is important as opposed to 
the people they work for being entitled 
to good service. 
Sadly, there is one glaring example 
to me that is far from reaching a con-
clusion or a positive ending anytime 
soon, although I will never give up. I 
will never give up. 
Over 50 years ago, during the Viet-
nam war, the USS Frank E. Evans bat-
tleship collided with an allied aircraft 
carrier and sank, killing 74 deployed 
sailors. The USS Frank E. Evans had 
served multiple tours off the Vietnam 
coast and was scheduled to return after 
completing this exercise about 100 
miles outside of the official combat 
zone. They were exercising with other 
American ships, as well as other allied 
ships, during the Vietnam war. Because 
of a geographic technicality, the names 
of those ‘‘Lost 74’’ sailors are not me-
morialized on the Vietnam Veterans 
Memorial wall, as if they didn’t die in 
the service of our Nation’s effort in 
Vietnam. The honor and gratitude 
owed to them is long overdue, but the 
only objections I have ever heard—re-
member, this was just about 51 years 
ago now—the only objections I have 
ever heard are from the people whose 
job it would be to add their names to 
the wall. In other words, I can’t find 
anybody who opposes adding the 74 
names to the wall except the people 
whose job it would be to carry out this 
task. We are working on sending a man 
to Mars, but somehow it is too much to 
add 74 heroes’ names to the Vietnam 
Memorial wall. 
It is inexplicable to me that bureau-
crats in Washington could determine 
that these sailors’ ultimate sacrifice is 
unworthy of being memorialized sim-
ply because they were on the wrong 
side of an arbitrary line. The exclusion 
of these veterans is a disservice to 
those who gave their lives for our coun-
try. A technicality is not an excuse for 
inaction, a previously issued memo is 
not a reason to express disapproval, 
and an objection from Washington’s 
bureaucracy should not stop us from 
honoring these heroes, these veterans. 
Last year, a bipartisan group of Sen-
ators introduced a bill to force the bu-
reaucracy to make this a reality. Yet 
it remains stuck here in the Senate. 
Let me repeat that. The bureaucracy’s 
excuses have found welcoming ears 
here, and the bill remains stuck, with 
no explanation or reasoning. It has 
equal bipartisan support. Yet it re-
mains stuck in the bureaucracy of this 
body. 
If we do not see movement soon, I am 
going to return to the Senate floor to 
attempt to pass the bill by unanimous 
consent. I have spoken to the chairmen 
of the two committees of jurisdiction. 
They see no objection. Yet, somewhere 
in this big place, objection clearly ex-
ists. 
I hope that between now and then, we 
are able to see real progress on this im-
portant issue. The people fighting to 
have these fallen soldiers memorialized 
are also heroes. They are their ship-
mates. They are the survivors, the 
spouses, and the children of these he-
roes. I am not going to join the bu-
reaucracy by standing in the way, and 
I hope none of my colleagues do either. 
These are just a few of the many ex-
amples of what I call bureaucratic 
abuse, obstruction, and overreach that 
I have witnessed since coming to Con-
gress just 7 years ago, and I think we 
should call them out. The opinion of 
Federal career staff is not sacrosanct; 
it is advice. It is counsel, but it is not 
a decision. 
Without further action, complacency 
will only empower the bureaucracy. 
People elected us to have their power, 
the people’s power. So now is the time 
to remind this city who holds that con-
stitutional responsibility and author-
ity. The people hold it. Our constitu-
ents elected us, the President, and 
every elected official, but they have no 
say in the bureaucracy except through 
us. That is our job as elected officials— 
to give the people we work for their 
voice in the bureaucracy. We must 
dedicate ourselves to doing so, so that 
we can define this era as a time that 
we, the elected representatives, stood 
up to the bureaucracy and reclaimed 
the true power of the Federal Govern-
ment for the people, not the bureauc-
racy. 
With that, I yield my time. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. COT-
TON). Without objection, it is so or-
dered.

Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I 
rise today for ‘‘Time to Wake Up’’ 
speech No. 258 and my increasingly bat-
tered chart here to urge colleagues in 
the Senate to wake up and see the 
looming danger we face from climate 
change. 
Just look at the recent climate ef-
fects in our Southern Hemisphere. The 
most devastating wildfires anyone can 
remember have ripped across Aus-
tralia, burned more than a fifth of Aus-
tralia’s forests, destroying thousands 
of homes, killing an estimated 1 billion 
animals, and making a day of breath-
ing air in Sydney like smoking 37 ciga-
rettes. In the ocean off Australia, there 
are new warnings that the Great Bar-
rier Reef—a Wonder of the World visi-
ble from space—is doomed. 
The warmest temperatures ever were 
recorded in Antarctica—a 70-degree day 
when the average February tempera-
ture would be 33 degrees. 
Here is the Thwaites Glacier. Here on 
Antarctica’s 
Thwaites 
Glacier, 
sci-
entists drilled through 2,000 feet of ice, 
down to the ocean water below, and 
discovered water 2 degrees above freez-
ing. With 70 degrees above and 2 de-
grees above, it is a melting sandwich. 
Losing that glacier would trigger al-
most 3 feet of sea level rise, and that 
glacier is going. 
Sea level rise brings me to the crash 
warnings that are the subject of this 
speech, crash warnings that are flash-
ing throughout the economy. Sea level 
rise connects to these crash warnings 
because some of these crash warnings 
revolve around sea level rise in its 
crashing coastal property values. Other 
warnings are of a crash in what econo-
mists call the carbon bubble. 
I have a binder of these warnings 
that I put together, and I sent this 
binder to every Member of the Senate 
in February of 2019. Every Senator has 
all of the warnings that are compiled 
in that binder. I have a letter, too, that 
follows up on the warnings in that 
binder—just about the warnings that 
have emerged since February of 2019— 
in fact, mostly just from this year. I 
sent this letter to all of the members of 
the Senate Banking Committee be-
cause the economic crashes that are 
warned of are within the Senate Bank-
ing Committee’s jurisdiction, and that 
committee has the responsibility to be 
the distant early warning system for 
the rest of us in the Senate about these 
warnings. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to have printed in the RECORD the 
letter to the Committee on Banking, 
Housing, and Urban Affairs, dated Feb-
ruary 6, 2020. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
U.S. SENATE, 
Washington, DC, February 6, 2020. 
Hon. MIKE CRAPO, 
Chairman, Committee on Banking, Housing and 
Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, 
DC. 
Hon. SHERROD BROWN, 
Ranking Member, Committee on Banking, Hous-
ing and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, Wash-
ington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN CRAPO AND RANKING MEM-
BER BROWN: With the impeachment proce-
dure behind us, we return to regular work, 
and I write to bring your attention to fur-
ther financial warnings related to the cli-
mate crisis.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1695 
March 11, 2020 
You will recall that I wrote to you on De-
cember 2, 2019 about climate-related warn-
ings emanating from the financial and regu-
latory community. The two lead warnings 
were of a coastal property value crash (which 
Freddie Mac has warned could be worse than 
the 2008 mortgage meltdown), and a carbon 
asset bubble crash (described by U.K. finan-
cial regulator the Bank of England as a ‘‘sys-
temic risk’’—meaning the crash could cas-
cade beyond fossil fuel companies out into 
the global economy). A copy of that letter is 
attached for you as a reference. 
The warnings continue. 
The Bank for International Settlements, 
described sometimes as the bank of the cen-
tral banks, has published a report, ‘‘The 
Green Swan: Central banking and financial 
stability in the age of climate change.’’ This 
report recognizes and reinforces the many 
previous warnings that ‘‘[c]limate change 
could . . . be the cause of the next systemic 
financial crisis’’ (p. 1), and that ‘‘[c]entral 
banks, regulators and supervisors have in-
creasingly recognised that climate change is 
a source of major systemic financial risks’’ (p. 
65, emphasis added), indeed that ‘‘climate ca-
tastrophes are even more serious than most 
systemic financial crises.’’ (p. 3) 
The ‘‘Green Swan’’ report goes on to de-
scribe the stunning scale of these risks: that 
‘‘[e]xceeding climate tipping points could 
lead to catastrophic and irreversible impacts 
that would make quantifying financial dam-
ages impossible.’’ (p. 1, emphasis added; in an 
odd 
coincidence, 
that 
language 
mirrors 
President Trump’s 2009 warning in a New 
York Times ad that climate change con-
sequences would be ‘‘catastrophic and irre-
versible.’’) 
The ‘‘Green Swan’’ report warns that this 
risk is so extreme because the risk is dual, 
and so dangerous because it is so unpredict-
able: ‘‘The complex chain reactions and cas-
cade effects associated with both physical 
and transition risks could generate fundamen-
tally 
unpredictable 
environmental, 
geo-
political, social and economic dynamics.’’ (p. 
3, emphasis added). Like the ‘‘black swans’’ 
from which this report derives its title, 
‘‘both physical and transition risks are 
characterised by deep uncertainty and non-
linearity, their chances of occurrence are not 
reflected in past data, and the possibility of 
extreme values cannot be ruled out.’’ (p. 3, em-
phasis added). 
The ‘‘Green Swan’’ report warns that this 
dangerously unpredictable risk can put our 
financial stability in danger, citing ‘‘growing 
awareness’’ that these ‘‘physical and transi-
tion risks . . . would affect the stability of 
the financial sector.’’ (p. 65); and could be ir-
remediable by ordinary methods. The impact 
could be so great as to ‘‘make quantifying fi-
nancial damages impossible,’’ (p. 1), the ef-
fects would be ‘‘catastrophic and irrevers-
ible’’ (p. 1), and these ‘‘climate-related risks 
will remain largely unhedgeable as long as 
system-wide action is not undertaken.’’ (p. 1) 
In this looming, ominous cloud of danger 
and 
uncertainty, 
one 
thing 
is 
certain. 
‘‘[T]here is certainty about the need for am-
bitious actions despite prevailing uncer-
tainty regarding the timing and nature of 
impacts of climate change.’’ (p. 3) The report 
identifies ‘‘an array of actions’’: ‘‘The most 
obvious ones are the need for carbon pricing 
and for systematic disclosure of climate-re-
lated risks by the private sector.’’ (p. 2, em-
phasis added). To achieve this safe and cer-
tain path, the report calls urgently for an 
end to ‘‘[t]he procrastination that has been 
the dominant modus operandi of many gov-
ernments for quite a while.’’ (p. 66) (As you 
know, I take the position that our procrasti-
nation in Congress has been acquired by the 
fossil fuel industry through its armada of 
front groups and dark money channels, 
which will make the procrastination all the 
more blameworthy when the full story 
emerges.) 
The stem warning of the ‘‘Green Swan’’ re-
port, and the certain path to safety from the 
hazard, are echoed in a recent open letter 
from BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. 
In his letter to CEOs, Fink notes that 
‘‘[c]limate change has become a defining fac-
tor in companies’ long-term prospects,’’ and 
that as a result ‘‘we are on the edge of a fun-
damental reshaping of finance’’ (emphasis in 
original), one that is ‘‘compelling investors 
to reassess core assumptions about modem 
finance.’’ 
This extraordinary language is based, as in 
the ‘‘Green Swan’’ report, on the dual nature 
of the hazard, ‘‘of how climate risk will im-
pact both our physical world and the global 
system that finances economic growth.’’ The 
conclusion is harsh: ‘‘In the near future—and 
sooner than most anticipate—there will be a sig-
nificant reallocation of capital.’’ (emphasis in 
original) The phrase ‘‘significant realloca-
tion of capital’’ couches in bland economic 
terms a dramatic and painful human pros-
pect. 
BlackRock also agrees on the safe path: 
that ‘‘government must lead the way in this 
transition,’’ and that ‘‘the scale and scope of 
government action’’ is ‘‘one of the most im-
portant questions.’’ In this regard, ‘‘carbon 
pricing [is] essential to combating climate 
change.’’ (emphasis added) 
In addition to the BIS ‘‘Green Swan’’ re-
port and the BlackRock letter, in the time 
since my last letter the following organiza-
tions have also brought similar warnings for-
ward. 
On December 18, 2019, the Bank of England 
published a discussion paper outlining its 
proposal for climate stress tests for corpora-
tions under its regulatory supervision. 
In 
January 
2020, 
the 
management 
consultancy 
McKinsey 
released 
a 
com-
prehensive report on the physical risks of 
climate change. McKinsey warns that cli-
mate change could ‘‘make long-duration bor-
rowing unavailable, impact insurance cost 
and availability, and reduce terminal val-
ues.’’ It could ‘‘trigger capital reallocation 
and asset repricing.’’ On January 15, 2020, the 
World Economic Forum’s Global Risks Re-
port identified the top five most likely risks 
facing the world over the next 10 years, and 
all were climate-related risks. 
A January 2020 report from the Stanford 
Graduate School of Business notes that ‘‘the 
financial risks from climate change are sys-
temic’’ 
and 
‘‘singular 
in 
nature,’’ 
and 
‘‘[g]lobal 
economic 
losses 
from 
climate 
change could reach $23 trillion—three or four 
times the scale of the 2008 financial crisis.’’ 
Given the scope and scale of these warn-
ings, and given that Senators depend on the 
Banking Committee as our official eyes and 
ears into such hazards, I hope that the Com-
mittee will rapidly hold searching and fair 
hearings about these danger warnings. 
Sincerely, 
SHELDON WHITEHOUSE, 
U.S. Senator. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, 
the warnings are serious. They come 
from some of our foremost financial ex-
perts. So let’s walk through what we 
have in store if we keep sleepwalking 
through the climate crisis. 
As I said, warning No. 1: coastal prop-
erty value crash. 
Freddie Mac, not an environmental 
organization but a giant mortgage 
company, warned that rising sea levels 
will prompt a crash in coastal property 
values that will be worse than the 
housing crash that triggered the 2008 
financial crisis. 
First Street Foundation found that 
rising seas have already caused $16 bil-
lion in lost property values in coastal 
homes from Maine to Texas. 
Moody’s, the bond rating agency, 
warned that climate risk will trigger 
downgrades in coastal communities’ 
bond ratings. 
BlackRock—the biggest asset man-
ager in the world—estimated that, by 
the end of the century, climate change 
will cause coastal communities annual 
losses that will average up to 15 per-
cent of local GDP with the hardest hit 
communities, obviously, hit far worse. 
Hello, Florida. 
Warning No. 2: a carbon asset bubble 
crash. 
The Bank of England, the Bank of 
France, the Bank of Canada, and the 
European Central Bank—all backed by 
top-tier, peer-reviewed economic pa-
pers—all warn that fossil fuel assets 
are dramatically overvalued on fossil 
fuel companies’ books, that these as-
sets are actually uneconomic and will 
become stranded, and that the result-
ing ‘‘carbon asset bubble’’ crash will 
swamp the world economy. 
How bad is it? It is called systemic fi-
nancial risk. Systemic financial risk is 
finance speak for risk to the entire eco-
nomic system. Do you remember the 
2008 financial crisis? Bad home mort-
gages blew up more than mortgage 
companies; they caused a brutal eco-
nomic recession, and millions of people 
lost their jobs, their homes, and their 
retirement savings. We are still recov-
ering from that collapse. That is a sys-
temic financial crisis, and the warnings 
are that this one will be worse. 
In my recent letter, I looked at the 
more recent warnings. Here is the 
Bank for International Settlements’ 
recent Green Swan report. The title is 
a reference to the metaphor of a black 
swan—an unpredictable event with ca-
lamitous consequences for the econ-
omy. 
Below is what my letter to the Bank-
ing Committee quoted from this Green 
Swan report. 
Page No. 1 warns: ‘‘[c]limate change 
could . . . be the cause of the next sys-
temic financial crisis.’’ 
From page No. 65: ‘‘Central banks, 
regulators and supervisors have in-
creasingly 
recognized 
that 
climate 
change is a source of major systemic fi-
nancial risks,’’ and ‘‘climate catas-
trophes are even more serious than 
most systemic financial crises.’’ 
Again, from page No. 1: ‘‘Exceeding 
climate tipping points could lead to 
catastrophic and irreversible impacts 
that would make quantifying financial 
damages impossible.’’ 
Let’s slow down and do that one 
again: 
‘‘Exceeding 
climate 
tipping 
points could lead to catastrophic and 
irreversible impacts that would make 
quantifying financial damages impos-
sible.’’ 
As a little aside here, it is an odd co-
incidence that the report’s language of 
‘‘catastrophic and irreversible’’ mirrors 
President Trump’s warning in a New

York Times ad in 2009 that the con-
sequences of climate change would be 
catastrophic 
and 
irreversible—the 
same words, ‘‘catastrophic and irre-
versible.’’ This was said by Trump in 
2009 and was written in the Bank for 
International Settlements’ Green Swan 
report just 2 months ago. 
Back to the Green Swan report, on 
page No. 3: ‘‘The complex chain reac-
tions and cascad[ing] effects associated 
with both physical and transition risks 
could generate fundamentally unpre-
dictable environmental, geopolitical, 
social and economic dynamics.’’ 
Fundamentally 
unpredictable 
eco-
nomic dynamics? Fundamentally un-
predictable social dynamics? 
Again, on page No. 1: ‘‘climate-re-
lated 
risks 
will 
remain 
largely 
unhedgeable as long as system-wide ac-
tion is not undertaken.’’ 
Back to page No. 3 again: Like the 
black swans from which the report de-
rives its title, the ‘‘physical and transi-
tion risks are characterised by deep un-
certainty 
and 
nonlinearity, 
their 
chances of occurrence are not reflected 
in past data, and the possibility of ex-
treme values cannot be ruled out’’—the 
possibility of extreme values. 
Another big warning that I quoted in 
my letter to the Banking Committee 
came from BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. 
In his open letter to CEOs, Fink echoes 
the Green Swan warning, writing: 
‘‘[c]limate change has become a defin-
ing factor in companies’ long-term 
prospects.’’ As a result, ‘‘we are on the 
edge of a fundamental reshaping of fi-
nance,’’ one that is ‘‘compelling inves-
tors to reassess core assumptions about 
modern finance.’’ 
Folks, BlackRock is the biggest asset 
manager in the world. When its CEO 
speaks of a fundamental reshaping of 
modern finance and a shaking of its 
core assumptions, that is serious stuff. 
In my letter, I cite other recent 
warnings of this systemic financial 
risk, all since I distributed the binder, 
many just this year. Here are a few in-
stances. 
In December, the Bank of England 
proposed climate stress tests for cor-
porations under its regulatory super-
vision. We started bank financial stress 
tests after the 2008 mortgage crisis, and 
central banks are starting to do the 
same for the climate crisis. 
In January, massive management 
consultant 
McKinsey—again, 
not 
a 
green group but, presumably, a pretty 
smart 
group—warned 
that 
climate 
change could ‘‘make long-duration bor-
rowing unavailable, impact insurance 
cost and availability, and reduce ter-
minal values.’’ Climate change could 
‘‘trigger capital reallocation and asset 
repricing,’’ which is finance speak for 
the fundamental upheaval of our econ-
omy. 
January: The World Economic Forum 
puts out its Global Risks Report that 
identifies the five most likely global 
risks facing the world over the next 10 
years. Five for five, every single one of 
them was climate related—all five. 
Finally, from the Stanford business 
school’s Corporations and Society Ini-
tiative is a report that warns ‘‘the fi-
nancial risks from climate change are 
systemic’’—there is that word again, 
‘‘systemic’’—that these risks are ‘‘sin-
gular in nature,’’ like the green swan- 
black swan warning, and that ‘‘[g]lobal 
economic losses from climate change 
could reach $23 trillion—three or four 
times the scale of the 2008 Financial 
Crisis.’’ 
Pause for a moment, and recall the 
agony of the 2008 financial crisis. 
Losses in the stock market wiped out 
nearly 
$8 
trillion. 
Housing 
values 
cratered; retirement savings vanished; 
and Americans lost jobs, lost homes, 
and lost nearly $10 trillion in wealth. 
Global economic growth went negative. 
We all went home to States where we 
witnessed extraordinary human suf-
fering. Three or four times that? The 
Stanford report is telling us that we 
are courting financial peril—systemic 
risk—the likes of which we cannot 
imagine. 
Climate change is a natural force. It 
has blown carbon dioxide levels way 
outside what humankind has ever expe-
rienced. It is depositing the equivalent 
of four Hiroshima-sized atomic bombs 
of excess heat per second into our 
oceans—per second—and it is an eco-
nomic bomb positioned beneath our 
economy, its detonator ticking down 
steadily. 
We have a chance to defuse the bomb. 
With all of these warnings that I have 
described in this binder and that I have 
described in my letter to the Com-
mittee 
on 
Banking, 
Housing, 
and 
Urban Affairs comes a clear description 
of the solution: Government must act. 
Here are the solutions that I quote in 
my letter to the Committee on Bank-
ing, Housing, and Urban Affairs. 
On page No. 66 of Green Swan: End 
‘‘[t]he procrastination that has been 
the dominant modus operandi of many 
governments for quite a while.’’ 
By the way, here, it really hasn’t 
been procrastination; it has been ob-
struction. It has been obstruction by 
the fossil fuel industry, its money, and 
its minions. Clearly, we haven’t done 
anything serious about it, so that has 
to end. 
On page No. 2 of the Green Swan: 
‘‘The most obvious ones are the need 
for carbon pricing and for systematic 
disclosure of climate-related risks by 
the private sector.’’ 
It is, indeed, obvious to people in the 
financial sector. It is only not obvious 
to us because fossil fuel money swirls 
all around this place, trying to con-
vince us that the obvious isn’t true. 
Yet 
BlackRock 
CEO 
Fink’s 
letter 
echoes that call for carbon pricing. 
He says, ‘‘carbon pricing [is] essen-
tial to combating climate change.’’ 
So we have the warnings, and we 
have the solutions. We have everything 
except the will to act. The reason we 
don’t have the will to act is because we 
have dark money, political predators 
controlling our behavior in ways that 
are deeply, deeply inappropriate. 
Assume that these warnings are cor-
rect. When this blows, Senators who 
didn’t help us act will have to come up 
with a better excuse than: Well, we 
weren’t 
warned—because 
we 
were 
warned. We have been warned over and 
over and over again. We have been 
warned by experts. We have been 
warned by major financial institutions. 
We have been warned by the custodians 
of our economy, the central banks. 
Colleagues, you have the warnings in 
your inbox. When this blows up, when 
coastal property values crash, or when 
the carbon bubble bursts, or worse, 
when both happen—nothing says both 
can’t happen—it is not going to look 
good to say: Yes, I was warned, but, 
you see, my political party is funded by 
the fossil fuel industry so naturally I 
did nothing. That is how you lose the 
privilege of representing people. 
It was a bit of a tempest in a teapot. 
It happened in Rhode Island 28 years 
ago, but I have lived through this. We 
had a financial crisis in Rhode Island 
in 1991. I was working for the Governor, 
who came in to have to clean up that 
horrible mess, and I was there for the 
following election after the financial 
crisis hit. 
The legislators who slept through the 
warnings lost their jobs in a tidal wave 
of popular outrage. In the subsequent 
election, the 1992 election, more than 
one-third of Rhode Island’s General As-
sembly was either voted out or didn’t 
even bother running again. 
There was a movie, when I went to 
law school, about the Harvard Law 
School. I think it was called ‘‘One L.’’ 
They brought in the freshman class of 
the One L class, and the crotchety old 
dean looked at them all and said: A 
third of you are going to be gone before 
you graduate because this is so de-
manding. Look to your right. Look to 
your left. One of you will not be here at 
graduation. 
When this thing blows, that is going 
to be a ‘‘Look to your left. Look to 
your right. One of you won’t be here 
afterwards’’ moment here in the U.S. 
Senate. 
You think people are mad now, wait 
until this hits. Wait until these warn-
ings come true, and they know you 
were warned. Wait for that. 
It is time to wake up. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, before I 
begin my formal remarks, I just want 
to state that the Senate page class—I 
don’t know if you have noticed—are 
better than adequate. They are doing a 
good job for the United States of Amer-
ica, and I appreciate them in their 
service to the U.S. Senate.

S1697 
March 11, 2020 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, as of 
today there are over 1,000 confirmed 
COVID–19 cases in 35 States and Wash-
ington, DC. The World Health Organi-
zation has now declared COVID–19 a 
pandemic. Thirty-one people have died 
in the United States already because of 
this virus. This includes one person in 
the State of New Jersey. Communities 
across the country, and most recently 
New Jersey, are confronting the possi-
bility of seeing a spread of this virus. 
We also know that it is possible that, 
due to delays and lack of availability 
of testing, the actual number of those 
infected here in the U.S. is likely high-
er than what has been reported. 
Every day that passes during the 
spread of this virus—every single day, 
every single hour, every single moment 
is critical. We must act urgently to 
slow its spread, to mitigate its impact. 
We all have a role to play in fighting 
the virus, each and every one of us, 
from our personal hygiene habits to 
those of us in positions of authority 
and the roles we can play to protect 
each other and to protect our commu-
nities. One of the most significant 
ways to do this is actually by encour-
aging people to stay home. Members of 
Congress have self-isolated. For people 
who have symptoms or who have severe 
coughs or who may have been exposed, 
there is an importance in social isola-
tion, staying home when you are sick. 
The challenge for us as a country is 
that for millions and millions of Amer-
icans this idea of staying home is not 
an option. Tens of millions of Ameri-
cans know that if they stay home, they 
miss a paycheck. If they miss a pay-
check, that can mean financial devas-
tation or ruin for their family. 
We are now the only industrialized 
nation in the world that doesn’t have 
paid family sick leave for workers. 
This is an unwelcome and, unfortu-
nately, this is a dangerous distinction 
now in the time of a global pandemic. 
This literally punishes people who are 
struggling, low-income workers. 
Right now the choice for millions of 
Americans is really this: Choose be-
tween your next paycheck and caring 
for your sick child. Choose between 
going to work sick or having to skip a 
meal. Choose between your health and 
well-being or your family’s financial 
security. That choice, unfortunately, 
even before this pandemic, was a 
choice that many Americans knew— 
that the people who are handling our 
food, the people who work in our res-
taurants, and the people who work 
with our elderly often go to work sick 
in this country helping the normal flu 
and other illnesses spread. In the case 
of a pandemic which has a mortality 
rate of potentially five or ten times 
that of the flu, this is, unfortunately, a 
tragic choice that families are trying 
to make. 
According to the National Partner-
ship for Women and Families, 70 per-
cent of the lowest income workers do 
not have a single paid sick day. They 
also report that 81 percent of people 
working in the food service industry— 
let me say that again: 81 percent of 
people working in our food service in-
dustry—and 75 percent of childcare 
center workers do not have access to 
paid sick leave. This is disproportion-
ately seen in communities of color. 
Think about the choice you make. 
Your child is sick, you are showing 
signs but you know if you do not go to 
work, you will not be able to make 
rent, you will not be able to put food 
on the table, you will miss a car pay-
ment, which means your car will be re-
possessed. These are choices that don’t 
just put the families in crisis but they 
put us all at risk. 
The disparity in access to preventive 
care is also an issue. There are dispari-
ties in access to healthcare and afford-
able medicine for people all across our 
country—millions and millions of peo-
ple. This is already before the global 
pandemic is a health crisis. The contin-
ued and unmitigated spread of COVID– 
19 could have disastrous impacts on 
people in communities that already 
have this vulnerability. In my commu-
nity, where I live, where I hopefully 
will go home this weekend, in Newark, 
NJ, the median income for the census 
track I live in is about $14,000, accord-
ing to the last census. That is $14,000 
per household. I know that public 
health emergencies can quickly be-
come economic disasters for those who 
are already struggling in the economic 
margins of our country. 
As we work together to combat the 
spread of this virus, we need to remem-
ber that any of us is only as healthy as 
our most vulnerable neighbors. In 
other words, as Martin Luther King 
said years ago, when he said ‘‘injustice 
anywhere is a threat to justice every-
where,’’ well, the virus anywhere is a 
threat to the health and safety of us 
everywhere. 
That is why we need to pass the bill 
introduced by Senator PATTY MURRAY 
to guarantee 7 days of sick leave for all 
workers and critically guarantee 14 
days of paid sick leave during public 
health emergencies. That is an act of 
self-interest. 
Again, I know with over 80 percent of 
those who handle our food in res-
taurants, if those folks do not have 
paid family leave, they are now eco-
nomically incentivized to go to work 
sick. It can cause a greater spread of 
the virus. 
Paid sick and family leave is a public 
health and safety issue, plain and sim-
ple. It is about economic justice and 
economic strength and security, but it 
is a public health issue for us all. As we 
prepare to fight this virus, we need to 
do the things that keep our people, our 
communities, and our country safe, 
healthy, and strong. That means join-
ing with the rest of our industrial na-
tions and having paid family sick 
leave. That means opening up and mod-
ernizing the Unemployment Insurance 
Act, because workers who lose a pay-
check because their factory closes or 
their restaurant closes or they lost 
childcare should be able to access the 
critical benefits they need to help their 
family get by. That means we also ex-
pand SNAP benefits for those kids who 
are forced to stay at home and from 
school and may miss meals. 
To take on this virus, to protect all 
of our communities, to ensure the 
strength of our economy, and to ensure 
our health, we need to take a com-
prehensive 
and 
inclusive 
approach. 
That means leaving no one behind, be-
cause we are all in this crisis together. 
I have seen challenges from 9/11 to 
when I was mayor and we had Hurri-
cane Sandy hit. It was the strength of 
our community in that region around 
9/11. It was the strength of that com-
munity during that terrible storm. I 
remember seeing that the strength was 
that we stood up for each other and 
stood by each other—neighbors opening 
up their homes, people lending a hand, 
people showing sacrifice for each other. 
That is the American way. Those val-
ues and virtues should be reflected in 
our policy. We are weakened and more 
vulnerable right now because we do not 
have commonsense policies that other 
countries take for granted, like paid 
family leave. We in the U.S. Senate 
should act for the love of each other 
and love of country, for the strength 
and security and health of our well- 
being for each other. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Massachusetts. 
Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I just 
want to first say that I agree with ev-
erything the Senator from New Jersey 
just said, and I think it is important to 
heed his message, because as of this 
afternoon, we are officially facing a 
global pandemic. 
The coronavirus pandemic has spread 
to more than 100 countries around the 
world. The World Health Organization 
has declared it a pandemic. The eco-
nomic repercussions have taken on a 
global dimension. This is also a virus 
that is impacting Americans on a very 
personal dimension. 
Massachusetts residents are worried 
about keeping their children, their 
families, and themselves safe. Day to 
day, even hour to hour, there is a lot of 
uncertainty during this public health 
emergency. Will I be able to work? Will 
I be able to get medical care? Will I be 
able to pay the mortgage or the rent? 
There is one thing I want my con-
stituents to know for certain. I share 
your concern for your loved ones, and 
your safety is my top priority. We need 
our response to this emergency to 
match the seriousness of the crisis. 
I commend the Governors and may-
ors across this country who have 
stepped up and provided leadership to 
their constituents, including Massa-
chusetts Governor Charlie Baker, who 
has wisely and swiftly declared a state 
of emergency in Massachusetts, and 
our great mayor of Boston, Martin 
Walsh, who has led early on this issue 
to make sure that we deal with this 
crisis.

S1698 
March 11, 2020 
We need that leadership more than 
ever because we are seeing a dangerous 
complete abdication of leadership from 
Donald Trump. His mismanagement of 
this crisis is unconscionable. It is im-
moral, and the harm it is causing the 
American people is an injustice. The 
Trump administration has let this cri-
sis spin out of control. 
President Trump has repeatedly said 
the risk is low and minimized the im-
plications of the disease, even saying 
that Americans are unlikely to die 
from an infection. But just today, Dr. 
Tony Fauci, Director of the National 
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Dis-
eases and the Nation’s leading expert 
on infectious diseases, explained that 
coronavirus is 10 times more lethal 
than the flu. The administration over-
ruled health officials who wanted to 
recommend that the elderly and phys-
ically fragile Americans be advised not 
to fly. 
Trump has called efforts to draw at-
tention to the real risk of coronavirus, 
the 
new 
Democrat-created 
‘‘hoax.’’ 
Just today, it is being reported that 
the White House has ordered top offi-
cials to treat top-level coronavirus 
meetings as classified, further ham-
pering information sharing in our re-
sponse to this virus. 
We saw what a lack of transparency, 
misinformation, 
and 
denial 
did 
in 
China with the spread of this virus. We 
cannot allow that to happen in the 
United States of America. The bottom 
line: Families need clear, nonbiased, 
accurate, and reassuring information. 
They need it from public health offi-
cials. They need it from their elected 
leaders. There should be no partisan-
ship in pandemics. 
The President and his administration 
have undermined science and our sci-
entists. We have the best scientists in 
the world. We must put their expertise 
to work to solve this challenge. We 
have shown that we can do that. Con-
gress came together and quickly passed 
$8.3 billion in emergency funding to re-
spond to this crisis, but we can do 
much more. 
First, the President should imme-
diately declare the coronavirus pan-
demic an emergency under the Stafford 
Act. That direction would allow FEMA 
to access over $42 billion in disaster re-
lief funds and support States and com-
munities directly as they deal with the 
spread of this virus. I am officially 
calling on President Trump to do that 
today: 
Declare 
this 
an 
emergency 
under the Stafford Act. Free up the 
FEMA money of $42 billion in disaster 
relief so that we can work on this issue 
right now, dealing with it in a way that 
reflects the seriousness of the threat. 
The President should act today. 
Second, we need widespread and free 
coronavirus 
testing 
and 
affordable 
treatment for all. 
Third, we need to increase the Fed-
eral Medicaid assistance percentage. 
This would increase the amount of Fed-
eral dollars that go into Medicaid, im-
mediately 
pumping 
more 
resources 
into States to deal with this health cri-
sis. We did this during the great reces-
sion as a way to assist States in pro-
viding medical care. We should do it 
again, and I will be introducing legisla-
tion to accomplish that. 
Fourth, we need to ensure paid sick 
leave for our workers. We need to pass 
Senator PATTY MURRAY’s legislation to 
provide an additional 14 days’ sick 
leave immediately in the event of any 
public health emergency, including the 
current coronavirus crisis. 
Fifth, we need to enhance unemploy-
ment insurance and expand and sup-
port programs like SNAP and Women, 
Infants, and Children and school lunch 
and other initiatives to support food 
security. Banks should suspend pay-
ments on mortgages for those strug-
gling with the economic impacts of 
this crisis, and we should provide rent-
al assistance for those who need it. 
Sixth, we need to protect consumers, 
and that includes shielding them from 
scams and price gouging, which I called 
on Amazon to do. Amazon took action 
by removing bad actors from the site 
who were charging upwards of $400 for 
hand sanitizer. No one should be al-
lowed to reap a windfall from fear and 
human suffering. 
We need to provide clear guidance on 
protections for frontline health work-
ers and access to needed protective 
equipment. 
In 
a 
pandemic, 
our 
healthcare workers are heroes, but 
these heroes need help. We have to 
make sure they get the protective gear 
they need. 
The coronavirus is not the first and 
it will not be the last biothreat the 
United States faces. That is why I have 
introduced legislation that provides $1 
billion for research into a universal 
coronavirus vaccine that prevents the 
next biothreat that would come in the 
form of a coronavirus. They morph into 
different types of coronaviruses. We 
have to plan for the future. We need to 
find a universal coronavirus vaccine 
now, and we have to fund it, which is 
why I am asking for $1 billion for that 
solution to be found. 
Sadly, the reality is that this pan-
demic is going to get worse before it 
gets better. But this is our call, and 
this is our time to come together. We 
all have a responsibility to act, to show 
leadership, and to support those who 
are most vulnerable and will be most 
impacted by this virus. The elderly in 
nursing homes, our young children, the 
uninsured, 
the 
undocumented—they 
need our help right now. These are the 
lives to be saved, livelihoods to be pro-
tected, and futures to ensure. 
I will continue to work with my col-
leagues and fight for legislation that 
provides Massachusetts residents and 
businesses and those all across our 
country with the resources they need. I 
urge all of my colleagues to join me in 
this commitment to action. 
With that, I yield back. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
BLACKBURN). The clerk will call the 
roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
CRAMER). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I 
will have to tell you and all of my col-
leagues, as they probably know, this 
has been a fairly tough month for my 
fellow Tennesseans. 
As you know, last week, a tornado 
tore through eight counties. This start-
ed 
in 
West 
Tennessee 
and 
exited 
through Middle Tennessee up on the 
plateau of our great State. This left 
multiple communities absolutely dev-
astated. We have mourned the loss of 
life and livelihoods and property. 
I want to, again, thank President 
Trump for coming to Tennessee to offer 
his support and for listening to those 
who were so adversely impacted by this 
storm and for being there to encourage 
the emergency management officials, 
the volunteers, and all of the elected 
community officials. 
We have been encouraged that our 
Tennesseans have been joined from vol-
unteers all across the country who 
have shown up to help. They have do-
nated their time, their supplies, and 
their money to our restoration and re-
building and recovery and cleanup ef-
forts. To all of those who have volun-
teered and offered their support, you 
have made such a difference in the 
lives of so many Tennessee families. 
We know this is going to be a long and 
difficult recovery. 
After all of this occurred, on Wednes-
day of last week, Tennessee health offi-
cials 
confirmed 
our 
first 
case 
of 
coronavirus. It was in a patient just 
south of Nashville in Williamson Coun-
ty. 
With all that said, that is a lot to 
handle in any given week, but Ten-
nesseans and all Americans should be 
encouraged that there is a lot of good 
work that is taking place. As I said, 
the rebuilding efforts span all of those 
counties in our State. 
And then, of course, right there in 
Nashville are efforts to combat the 
spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus. 
The 
Vanderbilt 
University 
Medical 
Center’s Denison Lab is one of the top 
20 labs in the world that is studying 
this disease. For over 25 years, they re-
ceived Federal grants for their research 
into how these viruses make us sick, 
and they are currently helping with 
the development of treatments, anti- 
virals, and vaccines to deal with 
coronaviruses, 
and 
especially 
the 
COVID–19. I am just so pleased with 
the progress they are making. 
Today I want to draw attention to a 
threat that has, again, been high-
lighted because of this coronavirus out-
break. Pharmaceuticals are no dif-
ferent from other products in that they

March 11, 2020 
are usually manufactured in pieces— 
the active ingredients in one place and 
the inactive ingredients in another 
place and so on. Currently, only 28 per-
cent of the facilities producing active 
pharmaceutical ingredients—and you 
will hear these referred to by the acro-
nym APIs—only 28 percent of the fa-
cilities producing these APIs are in the 
United States. What this means is that 
American consumers rely heavily on 
foreign-sourced drugs in order to stay 
healthy. 
Meanwhile, the number of Chinese fa-
cilities producing these APIs has more 
than doubled since 2010. Think about 
that. Only 28 percent of all the facili-
ties globally are in the United States. 
China has doubled the number of facili-
ties in China that are producing these 
APIs. 
Why does this matter? Last year, ex-
perts at the FDA testified before Con-
gress that while the United States is a 
world leader in drug development, we 
are falling behind in drug manufac-
turing. We do all the R&D here. We 
have the great scientific minds here. 
They are creating these products. They 
are manufactured primarily in China. 
Their testimony identified the ces-
sation of American manufacturing of 
APIs as a key health and security con-
cern because it created vulnerabilities 
in the U.S. supply chain. 
The FDA is not alone in their con-
cerns. In its 2019 report to Congress, 
the U.S.-China Economic and Security 
Review Commission revealed ‘‘serious 
deficiencies in health and safety stand-
ards in China’s pharmaceutical sec-
tor.’’ That is not something that some-
body just read on the internet. It is not 
an assumption. That is the 2019 report 
to Congress from the U.S.-China Eco-
nomic and Security Review. 
The coronavirus outbreak is drawing 
much needed attention to the possi-
bility of a global health crisis. Indeed, 
today the WHO classified it as a pan-
demic. I have to tell you, I think 
awareness is not enough. If the Con-
gress does not act, our dependency on 
China for medications will continue to 
put American lives at risk. 
Yesterday, alongside my friend, the 
Senator from New Jersey, Mr. MENEN-
DEZ, I introduced the Securing Amer-
ica’s Medicine Cabinet, or the SAM-C 
Act, to encourage an increase in Amer-
ican manufacturing of APIs. The act 
would expand upon the Emerging Tech-
nology Program within the FDA to 
prioritize issues related to national se-
curity and critical drug shortages and 
bring pharmaceutical manufacturing 
jobs back to the United States. In addi-
tion, the SAM-C Act authorizes $100 
million to develop centers of excellence 
for advanced pharmaceutical manufac-
turing in order to develop these inno-
vations. These centers will be partner-
ships between institutes of learning 
and the private sector. 
The number of API manufacturing 
facilities in China is still growing. It 
grows every single day. Although we 
cannot yet quantify our dependence on 
China’s APIs, we do know the more 
Chinese products flow into the United 
States, the more potential there is for 
trouble. 
In 2007 and 2008, 246 people died as a 
result of adulterated Heparin, a widely 
used blood thinner. An investigation by 
the Centers for Disease Control deter-
mined that batches of Heparin manu-
factured in China had been contami-
nated. The contaminant, which is very 
cheap, was similar in chemical struc-
ture to Heparin and went undetected in 
routine tests. 
Since 2010, regulators have also found 
serious problems with batches of thy-
roid medication, muscle relaxers, and 
antibiotics. In 2018, the FDA recalled a 
number of blood pressure medications 
made in China that were contaminated 
with cancer-causing toxins. 
To be perfectly clear though, adulter-
ation isn’t the only concern. In 2016, an 
explosion at a Chinese factory resulted 
in a global shortage of an important 
antibiotic because that factory was the 
drug’s sole source of production. Think 
about that. The factory exploded, and 
there was a shortage of an important 
antibiotic because they were the only 
people who were making it. Without 
intervention, the FDA expects the 
pharmaceutical industry will continue 
to rely on Chinese companies to make 
these active pharmaceutical ingredi-
ents, the APIs. 
On February 27, 2020, the FDA an-
nounced the shortage of one drug that 
was used to treat patients with the 
coronavirus. They attributed the short-
age to difficulties obtaining—guess 
what—the active pharmaceutical in-
gredients from a site in China that has 
been affected by the disease. 
The status quo has made us vulner-
able, but the fix is sitting right in front 
of us. If we fail to act, we are placing 
our future in the hands of unregulated 
foreign countries we know to be bad ac-
tors. We have a lot of work to do before 
we will be able to call our supply chain 
and our healthcare delivery systems se-
cure. But if we are learning anything, 
we are learning we need to bring this 
production back into the United States 
where there is proper oversight, where 
we know we are not going to have con-
tamination in this supply chain for 
these active pharmaceutical ingredi-
ents. We must embrace telehealth, es-
pecially across State lines, and halt 
the breakdown of care in our rural 
areas. 
I have introduced bills that will help 
support those things, and I welcome 
additional cosponsors. The door is al-
ways open. All of this activity is here 
to secure our supply chain and our 
ability to access the healthcare that 
Americans need. Today I specifically 
ask that our colleagues support S. 3432, 
the SAM-C Act, Securing America’s 
Medicine Cabinet Act. That is a first 
step in securing this pharmaceutical 
supply chain and securing the health 
and wellness of American consumers. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The

The legislative clerk proceeded to

Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I

BROADBAND DEPLOYMENT ACCU-
RACY 
AND 
TECHNOLOGICAL 
AVAILABILITY ACT 
Mr. 
MARKEY. 
Mr. 
President, 
schools, libraries, healthcare providers, 
and other community anchor institu-
tions need high-capacity broadband for 
distance learning, access to informa-
tion, and telemedicine, but too often, 
anchor institutions’ need for broadband 
service are overlooked. That is why I 
want to make sure that anchor institu-
tions are included in the mapping leg-
islation under consideration today. I 
am pleased that S. 1822 will enable the 
Federal Communications Commission 
to develop more accurate and more 
granular broadband maps. However, in 
implementing this legislation, the FCC 
must make sure to include anchor in-
stitutions in its list of serviceable loca-
tions so that our broadband maps accu-
rately cover anchor institutions as well 
as residences. 
f 
CITIZENSHIP 
FOR 
CHILDREN 
OF 
MILITARY MEMBERS AND CIVIL 
SERVANTS ACT 
Ms. DUCKWORTH. Mr. President, I 
rise today to applaud my colleagues for 
passing H.R. 4803, Citizenship for Chil-
dren of Military Members and Civil 
Servants Act, without amendment by 
unanimous consent. 
Last year, Senator JOHNNY ISAKSON 
joined me in introducing the bipartisan 
Senate companion to H.R. 4803 to make 
sure that when children of U.S. citizens 
serving in the U.S. Armed Forces or 
working for the U.S. Government are 
born abroad because their parents are 
serving our Nation overseas, they auto-
matically acquire U.S. citizenship. 
The unanimous passage of the Citi-
zenship for Children of Military Mem-
bers and Civil Servants Act by the U.S. 
House of Representatives and the U.S. 
Senate sends a strong message that 
children born to American parents 
serving our country abroad are just as 
worthy of automatic citizenship as any 
other child in this country. 
This principle should not be con-
troversial. That is why for the past 15 
years, U.S. Citizenship and Immigra-
tion Services considered children of 
members of the U.S. Armed Forces and 
Federal Government employees sta-
tioned outside the United States to be 
deemed as ‘‘residing in the United 
States’’ for the purpose of automati-
cally acquiring citizenship. 
This policy was pragmatic and cut 
burdensome redtape for American par-
ents willing to serve our Nation abroad

as U.S. servicemembers or civil serv-
ants. It provided flexibility and al-
lowed U.S. citizen parents to meet resi-
dency requirements for acquisition of 
citizenship while serving overseas. It 
kept American parents from cutting 
their overseas commitment short to es-
tablish residency so their children 
could earn citizenship. This policy al-
lowed their children to enjoy the same 
privileges of acquiring citizenship, as if 
their parents were working and living 
within our country’s borders. 
However, in August 2019, the Trump 
administration enacted a policy change 
to reverse this practice. Under this new 
policy, certain Americans serving their 
Nation abroad, in uniform or in the 
civil service, must apply for citizenship 
on behalf of their children. These par-
ents now have to navigate a complex 
bureaucratic process and spend hun-
dreds of dollars on an application, with 
no guarantee that their children will 
receive citizenship of the very country 
they are serving abroad in uniform or 
as a Federal employee. 
In fact, this policy change caused Re-
publican and Democratic lawmakers to 
recognize that current citizenship laws 
disadvantage these patriotic families. 
Our citizenship laws and bureaucratic 
requirements inflict undue burden on 
these families and make American par-
ents ‘‘prove’’ that their children are 
worthy of U.S. citizenship. 
As a combat veteran, I understand 
the challenges and family stressors 
that face Active-Duty members de-
ployed to defend our Nation overseas. 
Congress should be helping U.S. serv-
icemembers focus on achieving their 
mission. Providing U.S. servicemem-
bers and civil servants with the peace 
of mind that they will not have to 
navigate a lengthy and expensive proc-
ess to apply for U.S. citizenship for 
their children advances this important 
goal. 
Our commonsense legislation codifies 
the previous policy by clarifying the 
Immigration and Nationality Act to 
clearly require that children of U.S. 
citizen parents born in a foreign nation 
while 
their 
parents 
are 
stationed 
abroad automatically acquire U.S. citi-
zenship. 
I urge the President to honor the 
service and dedication of our U.S. serv-
icemembers, 
military 
families, 
and 
Federal workforce by signing the Citi-
zenship for Children of Military Mem-
bers and Civil Servants Act into law.

AUSTRALIAN WILDFIRES 
Ms. ROSEN. Mr. President, I rise in 
support of S. Res. 527, a resolution I 
was proud to cosponsor, recognizing 
the longstanding partnership between 
the United States and Australia to 
share critical firefighting resources 
during times of crisis. 
I first want to thank my colleagues, 
Senator CARDIN and BARRASSO, for in-
troducing this important legislation 
recognizing the brave men and women 
who have not only risked their lives in 
the United States as first responders, 
but went above and beyond to help 
combat the recent bushfires in Aus-
tralia. 
In November 2019, Australia began to 
experience devastating bushfires that 
burned over 30,000,000 acres of land. 
During this time, more than 300 Amer-
ican firefighters mobilized to assist 
Australian efforts to suppress and con-
tain the bushfire raging throughout 
the continent. This bipartisan resolu-
tion recognizes the efforts and bravery 
of Australian and American men and 
women who worked together to help 
those in danger and also specifically 
honors the three American firefighters 
who lost their lives fighting Australia’s 
bushfires on January 23, 2020. 
In my home State of Nevada, several 
firefighters answered the call to assist 
with bushfire mitigation and suppres-
sion efforts. I want to take a moment 
to recognize them individually: Mat-
thew James Petersen, Justin Cutler, 
Brian C. Holmes, Ian McQueary, Jacob 
Keogh, Juan Islas, Kevin Kelly, Joseph 
L. Miller, Dylan Rader, Timothy P. 
Roide, and Eric T. Tilden. 
Thank you to all of these brave Ne-
vadans for your service and sacrifice.

Semper Fidelis, 
and oh what a brilliant shadow you so cast 
. . . this sheen . . . 
As you marched off to war as a United States 
Marine . . . 
Hoo . . . Raaah Jar Head . . . 
As throughout the centuries, 
all for God and Country you have died and 
bled . . . 
And all in that battle that we call lwo Jima 
in what was said . . . 
As a time when their fine blood ran red . . . 
Now, all etched in their creed as said . . . 
Of what it really all so means, 
but to be a United States Marine . . . 
For from out of all of their grave sacrifice 
and loss, 
but comes such reverence all in this their 
grave cost . . . 
All in what their great valor and courage to 
us has taught . . . 
As why still to this very day, 
such homage we now must pay . . . 
All in this battle and victory, 
all in what it means To Be A United States 
Marine . . . 
All in those magnificent shades of green . . . 
But, there are some things men do not talk 
about . . . 
Of such things surely there is no doubt . . . 
Of which they’d much rather live without 
. . . 
All in those times of war that which bring 
about . . . 
As now buried deep down inside all their fine 
souls throughout . . . 
Of which we all devoutly talk about . . . 
Such things that which make them awake 
. . . 
All in the middle of night as such deep 
breath’s they take . . . 
As they so re-fight this fight that which they 
can not escape . . . 
To be carried with them as they grow old 
. . . 
As with each new step they make in these 
hearts of gold . . . 
Of the evils that men do, 
that which now leads their fine hearts to 
such heartache . . . 
And yet too, 
such great warmth from within them ema-
nates . . . 
All because of the brilliance their most gal-
lant hearts would create . . . 
And whenever they think of their Brothers 
In Arms their fine hearts so ache . . . 
For the ones who so heroically for each other 
fine lives so gave . . . 
That such splendor neither time nor distance 
can away so take . . . 
Such horrific memories only death can this 
pain forsake . . . 
As now all of those visions of horror they 
carry deep, 
as all in the middle of the night they awake 
and weep . . . 
Until, up in Heaven rejoined with their 
Brothers once more they meet . . . 
When, no longer all these nightmares their 
fine souls will keep . . . 
Oh yes, there are such things that men do 
not talk about . . . 
That which come to mind within ones soul 
no doubt . . . 
Who once upon a battlefield of honor so 
stood. 
for what was right and what was good gal-
lantly all throughout . . . 
For their courage and valor to this day we 
still talk about . . . 
As all of this we must now tout . . . 
For War is Hell, and Hell is War . . . 
And all of this young children must be told 
about . . . 
As it was to be the of War of War’s . . . 
The Big One so all for sure . . . 
To Save The World, as was their monu-
mental mission for sure . . . 
As a time when every battle but meant the 
most . . . 
As upon an Island named Iwo Jima, 
where to such new heights their most heroic 
hearts rose . . . 
Where each new step was but life or death, 
all in hand to hand combat as death stood 
close . . . 
As somehow, someway . . . 
all of them to the occasion rose in those days 
. . . 
Rose to such new heights of heroism did they 
. . . 
With 26,000 casualties, 
as 6,800 United States Marines most precious 
lives they gave . . . 
And upon a hill in Arlington this day, 
tears come to your eyes whenever you look 
upon that memorial and that flag they 
raised . . .

Because, to the top of Mount Suribachi a pil-
grimage, 
every Marine dreams in their lifetime to 
take . . . 
As it was 35 nights and days of Hell on earth 
as all so showed their fine worth . . . 
As it was 70,000 United States Marines, 
who dug in deep against an enemy which 
could not be seen . . . 
As so quickly boys had to become men as 
their fine red blood ran green . . . 
All in what it so means, 
to be a United States Marine . . . 
As all around them death lie replete, 
with the smell of death upon their feet . . . 
Such scenes of hell and carnage that would 
make the Angels weep . . . 
At the evils that men do all in one’s soul to 
keep . . . 
And so too, 
all in what new magnificence heights a he-
roic heart can reach . . . 
With some of the fiercest fighting of the war 
as each new horrific day would repeat 
. . . 
With the greatest number of Medal of Honors 
presented in any battle this feat . . . 
As it all began as they reached the beach 
. . . 
After a bombardment looking like it would 
never cease . . . 
As an eerie quiet calmness upon their souls 
beseeched . . . 
As step by step into the island they left from 
that beach, 
until finally all hell broke loose as they were 
all in deep . . . 
Walking into an ambush as out of tunnels 
and caves the enemy would creep . . . 
With years to plan such strategy to succeed 
. . . 
As these Marines climbed and fought for 
every inch of real estate so steep . . . 
Through inhospitable terrain of volcanic ash 
as death for them would meet . . . 
As all of these dark scenes from hell so came 
to pass . . . 
While, in the cover of darkness from out of 
caves such a grave toll the enemy 
amassed . . . 
As a new weapon came into play, 
the Zippo Tank a flame thrower helped win 
the day . . . 
Helping these heroes through such hell to so 
make their way . . . 
Because, that airfield they could not concede 
. . . 
As why 6,821 American Fine Heroes would die 
and bleed . . . 
or War Is Hell and Hell Is War, 
is that but not what heaven is for? 
And in the coming years how many more 
would have died? 
If it were but not for all of their most heroic 
battle cries! 
For only the number our Lord knows up on 
high . . . 
Fighting to the death hand to hand, 
as perhaps each one a Medal of Honor could 
command . . . 
Flamethrowers . . . tunnel by tunnel . . . 
cave by cave . . . 
Tunnel rats crawling into death so very 
brave . . . 
And how did they all get through each new 
dark day? 
As the enemy made them to such hell to pay 
. . . 
But, in the end there is nothing that has ever 
been made, 
which can stop a United States Marine to 
this day . . . 
As such a heavy toll these Marines made the 
enemy pay . . . 
21,844 would die, the ones who now lie in that 
dark ground cold graves . . . 
As it was on the 5th day, 
when 5 Marines and a Navy Corpsman por-
trayed . . . 
Out into the future such an iconic moment 
made . . . 
Now, all etched in stone to be imprinted on 
every Marines heart they say . . . 
As all part of their very DNA . . . 
Whether at the top of Mount Suribachi, 
or when we see that photo or memorial tears 
come to our eyes do they . . . 
Making us all so proud to be American’s the 
rest of our lives each day . . . 
For this battle is and will always be, 
one of our Nation’s most decisive of all vic-
tories . . . 
With only 216 of enemy so left, 
to tell their children’s children all about 
that battle against America’s Best. . . 
Yea, there are some things that men do not 
talk about . . . 
Who for all of their courage and valor Heav-
en so awaits them no doubt . . . 
And all throughout the history of The United 
States Marines, 
Iwo Jima will now be always seen . . . 
As the embodiment of what it all so means, 
but to be a United States Marine . . . 
And to what new heights a heroes heart can 
achieve . . . 
Can so climb too all in those magnificent 
shades of green . . .

CENTENNIAL OF THE BOY SCOUTS 
OF AMERICA GREATER WYOMING 
COUNCIL 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise 
today in celebration of 100 years of 
Scouting in Wyoming. 
On Saturday, March 21, 2020, the Boy 
Scouts of America Greater Wyoming 
Council will host their annual Silver 
Beaver and Eagle Scout Recognition 
Luncheon in Casper. This year holds a 
special significance as they will cele-
brate their 100th anniversary at this 
event. 
The Boy Scouts of America incor-
porated on February 8, 1910. Scouting 
came to Casper with the creation of the 
Casper Council in 1917. The council 
continued to expand, changing its 
name to the Casper Area Council in 
1925, Central Wyoming Council in 1931, 
and finally the Greater Wyoming Coun-
cil in 2016. The Boy Scouts of Amer-
ica’s mission is ‘‘to prepare young peo-
ple to make ethical and moral choices 
over their lifetimes by instilling in 
them the values of the Scout Oath and 
Law.’’ The council remains true to this 
mission and to their purpose to educate 
youth, age 5 to 21, to build character, 
develop personal fitness, and to train 
in the responsibilities of participating 
citizenship. 
In Wyoming, the Greater Wyoming 
Council upholds the mission and pur-
pose of the Boy Scouts through service 
to 11 counties and 3,000 youth across 
our State. The organization enjoys tre-
mendous community support with 1,400 
volunteers and 150 community part-
ners. This consistent and broad in-
volvement demonstrates what a valu-
able benefit the council provides to the 
youth and people of Wyoming. 
The council provides a variety of 
events and opportunities for Scouts, 
families, and communities in Wyo-
ming. These events include their an-
nual Strength of America Banquet, the 
annual Camp Buffalo Bill Summer 
Camp in Cody, fishing tournaments, 
and family camping trips. They work 
hard to provide many opportunities for 
Scouts to participate in fellowships, 
trainings, basecamps, and much more, 
to help members be, as the Scouts say, 
‘‘Prepared for life.’’ 
Brad Bodoh, the Scout executive for 
the council, has a strong background in 
serving the Scouts of America. We are 
fortunate to have his leadership. Before 
Brad made Wyoming home, he worked 
for the Boy Scouts of America in Iowa 
and Ohio. The knowledge and experi-
ence Brad brings to the Greater Wyo-
ming Council allow the Scouts to flour-
ish and expand their skills. Senior dis-
trict executives Frank Solla and An-
drew Allgeier, in addition to the coun-
cil office staff, are instrumental in 
growing and supporting the organiza-
tion’s participation throughout the 
state. 
In Wyoming, we live by the Code of 
the West. One of the principles of the 
Code is ‘‘to take pride in your work.’’ 
The council’s volunteers and families 
embody this principle. They make it 
possible for Scouts to advance through 
the program all the way through the 
rank of Eagle Scout. They see their 
work rewarded every time a Cub Scout 
earns a new badge and an Eagle Scout 
completes their project. The support 
for this organization is truly excep-
tional, and Wyoming is better for it. 
Mr. President, it is my pleasure to 
honor this historic milestone for the 
Greater Wyoming Council. Their cen-
tennial celebration is a recognition of 
all the hard work and preparation the 
council has done in the past 100 years 
and will continue to do for the next 100 
years. Bobbi and I are proud of the 
Greater Wyoming Council and the com-
munity support behind it. We celebrate 
the century of Scouting in Wyoming 
and extend our congratulations.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
RECOGNIZING FALLON FOOD HUB 
∑ Ms. ROSEN. Mr. President, each 
week the U.S. Senate Committee on 
Small Business & Entrepreneurship 
recognizes one small business that ex-
emplifies the hard work and persever-
ance of the American Dream and the 
American 
entrepreneur. 
The 
great 
State of Nevada is home to more than 
250,000 small businesses of all types 
from mom-and-pop shop bakeries to 
world renowned cybersecurity firms. In 
fact, about 99 percent of all business in 
Nevada are small businesses. Nevada’s 
small businesses are the driving force 
behind our State’s rapidly growing 
economy and the engine that powers 
our communities. It is therefore my 
honor to recognize Nevada’s Fallon 
Food Hub, a small business with a 
strong and deeprooted commitment to

improving lives and a desire to give 
back to the community, for recently 
having been named the U.S. Senate 
Small Business of the Week. 
The Fallon Food Hub’s mission is to 
educate the northern Nevada commu-
nity about the benefits of eating sea-
sonally in order to create a thriving 
and expanding local food scene, result-
ing in increased opportunities for pro-
ducers and local businesses. Fallon 
Food Hub believes that through edu-
cational opportunities for the commu-
nity about health and wellness, mem-
bers of the community can gain a 
greater sense of cooperation and appre-
ciation for the area producers, local 
farmers, and specialty food producers 
that serve the Silver State. Through 
increasing awareness of and apprecia-
tion of local farming and proper nutri-
tion, people can learn a healthier life-
style while also supporting local pro-
ducers. 
The Fallon Food Hub conducts fre-
quent surveys to get a sense of what 
the community is interested in learn-
ing, hosts monthly classes on the bene-
fits of eating seasonal produce, and 
keeps 
the 
community 
informed 
through a monthly newspaper. The 
Fallon Food Hub provides an outlet for 
local farmers, ranchers, and value- 
added producers to sell their goods. 
I would also like to recognize the 
work that Fallon Food Hub does to ad-
vocate on behalf of local farmers. 
Through ongoing education for mem-
bers 
and 
surrounding 
communities 
about farmers and the origins of local 
food, Fallon Food Hub is encouraging 
our community to connect with one 
another on a new level. They are an ex-
ample of an outstanding business with 
deep love for our community and one of 
the many reasons why they were a 
clear choice for this recognition. 
Small businesses truly are the driv-
ing force for development and growth 
not just in Nevada, but across our en-
tire Nation. Small businesses like 
Fallon Food Hub not only help our 
economy succeed, they also give back 
by uplifting our communities, inspiring 
others to open businesses of their own, 
improving people’s health and well- 
being, and changing lives for the bet-
ter. 
Again, I would like to recognize 
Fallon Food Hub and all the employees 
there for their contribution to Nevada 
and our Nation and congratulate them 
for being named the Senate Small 
Business and Entrepreneurship Com-
mittee’s Small Business of the Week. 
As a member of the committee, it was 
my honor to nominate this proud Ne-
vada business for recognition and my 
continued privilege to represent them 
and all of Nevada’s small businesses in 
the U.S. Senate.∑

REMEMBERING DICK AMBROSIUS 
∑ Mr. ROUNDS. Mr. President, today I 
would like to remember the life of Dick 
Ambrosius. Mr. Ambrosius passed away 
on January 24, 2020, at the age of 73. 
Dick Ambrosius was born in Huron, 
SD, and graduated from Huron High 
School in 1964. He attended the Univer-
sity 
of 
South 
Dakota, 
USD, 
in 
Vermillion, SD, where he earned a mas-
ter’s degree. He was actively involved 
in the Alpha Tau Omega Fraternity 
and the Reserve Officer Training Corps 
during his time at USD and continued 
to advocate for the value of Greek life 
and the importance of military service 
throughout his career. 
Following his college graduation in 
1968, he was commissioned as an officer 
in the U.S. Army, where he ultimately 
attained the rank of captain prior to 
his separation from service. He served 
in Vietnam and was awarded the 
Bronze Star and Purple Heart medals. 
In life, Mr. Ambrosius was a tireless 
advocate for senior citizens and dis-
abled veterans. He served as executive 
director for Warriors Never Give Up, a 
nonprofit organization that provides 
outdoor adventures for disabled vet-
erans. 
I commend Mr. Ambrosius for his de-
votion to his community, disabled vet-
erans, and seniors. I offer my sincerest 
condolences to his family and friends, 
including his wife Karen, daughter Jen-
nifer, sons Matt and Jacob, sister 
Nancy, and numerous grandchildren.∑

SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS 
SENATE 
RESOLUTION 
539—SUP-
PORTING THE RIGHTS OF THE 
PEOPLE OF IRAN TO DETERMINE 
THEIR 
FUTURE, 
CONDEMNING 
THE IRANIAN REGIME FOR ITS 
CRACKDOWN 
ON 
LEGITIMATE 
PROTESTS, 
AND 
FOR 
OTHER 
PURPOSES 
Mr. CARDIN (for himself, Mrs. SHA-
HEEN, Mr. KAINE, and Ms. ROSEN) sub-
mitted the following resolution; which 
was referred to the Committee on For-
eign Relations: 
S. RES. 539 
Whereas, on January 8, 2020, the Govern-
ment of Iran shot down Ukraine Inter-
national Airlines Flight 752, lied about its 
culpability, and then admitted to downing 
the plane on January 11 after evidence was 
made public by other sources; 
Whereas all 167 passengers and 9 crew-
members aboard Ukraine International Air-
lines Flight 752 died in the resulting crash; 
Whereas passengers were mostly citizens of 
Iran, but also included citizens of Canada, 
Ukraine, Great Britain, Afghanistan, and 
Sweden; 
Whereas, during January 11 through 13, 
2020, protesters gathered across Iran to de-
nounce lying and incompetence by regime 
leadership 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
airline 
shootdown; 
Whereas video clips of protests from Janu-
ary 11 through 13, 2020, showed protestors 
chanting against Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali 
Khamene’i and the IRGC; 
Whereas video clips suggest Iranian au-
thorities deployed tear gas and live ammuni-
tion against protestors in January 2020; 
Whereas earlier antigovernment protests 
in Iran began on November 15, 2019, and rap-
idly spread to dozens of Iranian cities in 29 of 
Iran’s 31 provinces, in the most significant 
antigovernment protests in Iran since the 
Green Movement demonstrations in 2009 and 
2010; 
Whereas the protests began in response to 
an announced increase on the price of fuel, 
and protesters expressed numerous economic 
grievances, while also calling for the struc-
tural reform of the political system and con-
demning current and former Iranian leaders; 
Whereas reports indicate that Iranian se-
curity forces responded to protests with le-
thal force, killing hundreds of demonstrators 
and arresting thousands more; 
Whereas reports indicate that the Govern-
ment of Iran authorities have, in many in-
stances, refused to return victims’ bodies to 
their families and that security forces have 
removed bodies from morgues and trans-
ferred them to unknown locations; 
Whereas, on November 16, 2019, Iranian au-
thorities began implementing a near-total 
shutdown of internet services, stopping near-
ly all means of online communications for 
people inside Iran to prevent the sharing of 
images and videos of deadly violence being 
used by security forces; 
Whereas, on November 16, 2019, Iran’s Inte-
rior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli sug-
gested that the Iranian regime would no 
longer show ‘‘tolerance’’ toward the pro-
testers; 
Whereas, on November 17, 2019, Iranian Su-
preme 
Leader 
Ayatollah 
Ali 
Khamene’i 
called the demonstrators ‘‘villains’’, sug-
gested that protests were incited by foreign 
enemies and domestic insurgents, and or-
dered Iranian security services to ‘‘imple-
ment their duties’’ to end the protests; 
Whereas, on November 18, 2019, the IRGC 
deployed 
to 
the 
southwestern 
city 
of 
Mahshahr, which had been taken over by 
demonstrators, and engaged in mass repres-
sion over a period of 4 days, reportedly kill-
ing as many as 100 people; 
Whereas multiple United States laws pro-
vide authorities to designate and sanction 
elements of the Iranian regime for its repres-
sive conduct, including those involved in sig-
nificant corruption or serious human rights 
abuses, including— 
(1) the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Ac-
countability, and Divestment Act of 2010 (22 
U.S.C. 8501 et seq.); 
(2) the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria 
Human Rights Act of 2012 (22 U.S.C. 8701 et 
seq.); 
(3) the Countering Iran’s Destabilizing Ac-
tivities Act of 2017 (22 U.S.C. 9401 et seq.); 
and 
(4) the Global Magnitsky Human Rights 
Accountability Act (subtitle F of title XII of 
Public Law 114–328; 22 U.S.C. 2656 note); 
Whereas the Iranian regime was implicated 
in a terrorist plot targeting gatherings of 
Iranian dissidents in Paris in June 2018 and 
in Albania in March 2018; 
Whereas, in August 2018, the United States 
Government arrested 2 Iranian nationals 
who later pleaded guilty for acting on behalf 
of the Iranian regime to conduct covert sur-
veillance in the United States against offi-
cials of the Iranian opposition for a target 
package which, according to the Department 
of Justice complaint, may have included 
‘‘apprehension, recruitment, cyber exploi-
tation, or capture/kill operations’’; 
Whereas the Iranian regime has routinely 
violated the human rights of Iranian citi-
zens, including by implementing ongoing, 
systematic, and serious restrictions of free-
dom of peaceful assembly and association 
and freedom of opinion and expression, in-
cluding the continuing closures of media 
outlets, arrests of journalists, and the cen-
sorship of expression in online forums such 
as blogs and websites; 
Whereas, on November 22, 2019, the United 
States imposed sanctions on Iran’s Minister 
of Information and Communications Tech-
nology for his role in shutting down internet 
access in Iran; 
Whereas the Department of State’s most 
current Human Rights Report noted that the 
Government of Iran levied ‘‘severe restric-
tions on free expression, the press, and the 
internet, including censorship, site blocking, 
and criminalization of libel; substantial in-
terference with the rights of peaceful assem-
bly and freedom of association, such as over-
ly restrictive nongovernmental organization 
(NGO) laws; egregious restrictions of reli-
gious freedom; restrictions on political par-
ticipation;’’ and that there is ‘‘widespread 
corruption at all levels of government’’; 
Whereas, on November 18, 2019, the Office 
of the German Chancellor stated, ‘‘It is le-
gitimate and deserving of our respect when 
people courageously air their economic and 
political grievances, as is currently hap-
pening in Iran. . .We urge the government in 
Tehran to respect freedom of assembly and 
expression.’’; 
Whereas, on November 20, 2019, the French 
Foreign Ministry stated, ‘‘France is fol-
lowing the demonstrations taking place in 
Iran with concern. It expresses its deep con-
cern at reports that a large respect its inter-
national human rights obligations.’’; 
Whereas, on December 2, 2019, a statement 
from Amnesty International confirmed that 
‘‘extensive video footage verified and ana-
lyzed by Amnesty International’s Digital 
Verification Corps shows security forces 
shooting at unarmed protesters who did not 
pose any imminent risk’’; 
Whereas, on December 6, 2019, United Na-
tion’s High Commissioner for Human Rights 
Michelle Bachelet said, ‘‘Verified video foot-
age indicates severe violence was used 
against protesters, including armed members 
of security forces shooting from the roof of a 
justice department building in one city, and 
from helicopters in another,’’ and added that 
the Office of the United Nations High Com-
missioner for Human Rights has also re-
ceived 
footage 
showing 
security 
forces 
‘‘shooting to kill’’; 
Whereas, on December 8, 2019, a Declara-
tion by the European Union High Represent-
ative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy 
Josep Borrell Fontelles stated, ‘‘A growing 
body of evidence indicates that despite re-
peated calls for restraint, the Iranian secu-
rity forces’ disproportionate response to re-
cent demonstrations has led to high numbers 
of deaths and injuries. For the European 
Union and its Member States, the widespread 
and disproportionate use of force against 
nonviolent protestors is unacceptable.’’; 
Whereas, on December 16, 2019, Amnesty 
International further reported that ‘‘[eye-
witness testimony] suggests that, almost im-
mediately after the Iranian authorities mas-
sacred hundreds. . .participating in nation-
wide protests, [the authorities] went on to 
orchestrate a wide-scale clampdown designed 
to instill fear and prevent anyone from 
speaking out about what happened’’; 
Whereas, on January 17, 2020, the United 
States designated IRGC General Hassan 
Shahvarpour, Khuzestan Province’s Vali Asr 
Commander, for his involvement in gross 
violations 
of 
human 
rights 
against 
protestors during the November 15 through 
18, 2019, protests in Mahshahr, Iran; 
Whereas Iran is a member of the United 
Nations, voted for the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights, and is a state party to the 
International Covenant on Civil and Polit-
ical Rights, done at New York December 19, 
1966; 
Whereas, during February 2020 parliamen-
tary elections, against the backdrop of re-
gime interference, disqualification of re-
formist and moderate candidates, and anger 
over crackdowns on protesters, the majority 
of the Iranian people chose not to vote, mak-
ing turnout the lowest in Iran’s post-1979 his-
tory; and 
Whereas the Iranian regime has a long his-
tory of violent repression of dissent, includ-
ing— 
(1) in 1988, carrying out the barbaric mass 
executions of thousands of political pris-
oners—including 
teenagers 
and 
pregnant 
women—by hanging and firing squad for re-
fusing to renounce their political affiliations 
and, in some cases, for possessing or distrib-
uting political reading material; 
(2) in 1999, brutally suppressing a student 
revolt that was one of the largest mass 
uprisings up until that point in the country 
since 1979, in a crackdown since referred to 
as ‘‘Iran’s Tiananmen Square’’; 
(3) following voting irregularities that re-
sulted in the 2009 re-election of Mahmoud 
Ahmadinejad, cracking down on peaceful po-
litical dissent from wide segments of civil 
society in a cynical attempt to retain its un-
democratic grip on power; and

(4) beginning in December 2017, and con-
tinuing for several months after protests

BENNET) submitted the following reso-
lution; 
which 
was 
considered 
and 
agreed to: 
S. RES. 540 
Whereas, since its inception in 1994, the 
AmeriCorps national service program has 
proven to be a highly effective way— 
(1) to engage the people of the United 
States in meeting a wide range of local and 
national needs; and 
(2) to promote the ethics of service and vol-
unteerism; 
Whereas, since 1994, more than 1,100,000 in-
dividuals have taken the AmeriCorps pledge 
to ‘‘get things done for America’’ by becom-
ing AmeriCorps members; 
Whereas, each year, AmeriCorps, in coordi-
nation with State service commissions, pro-
vides opportunities for approximately 75,000 
individuals across the United States to give 
back in an intensive way to communities, 
States, Tribal nations, and the United 
States; 
Whereas AmeriCorps members have served 
more than 1,600,000,000 hours nationwide, 
helping— 
(1) to improve the lives of the most vulner-
able people of the United States; 
(2) to protect the environment; 
(3) to contribute to public safety; 
(4) to respond to disasters; 
(5) to strengthen the educational system of 
the United States; and 
(6) to expand economic opportunity; 
Whereas, since 1994, AmeriCorps funds have 
been invested in nonprofit, community, edu-
cational, and faith-based groups, and those 
funds leverage hundreds of millions of dol-
lars in outside funding and in-kind donations 
each year; 
Whereas AmeriCorps members recruit and 
supervise millions of community volunteers, 
demonstrating the value of AmeriCorps as a 
powerful force for encouraging people to be-
come involved in volunteering and commu-
nity service; 
Whereas AmeriCorps members serve at 
more than 21,000 locations across the United 
States, including at nonprofit organizations, 
schools, and faith-based and community or-
ganizations; 
Whereas 
AmeriCorps 
National 
Civilian 
Community Corps campuses in the States of 
Mississippi, Iowa, California, and Colorado 
strengthen communities and develop future 
leaders through team-based service; 
Whereas AmeriCorps members nationwide, 
in return for the service of those members, 
have earned nearly $4,000,000,000 to use to 
further their own educational advancement 
at colleges and universities across the 
United States; 
Whereas AmeriCorps members, after their 
terms of service with AmeriCorps end, have 
been more likely to remain engaged in their 
communities as volunteers, teachers, and 
nonprofit professionals than the average in-
dividual; 
Whereas AmeriCorps is a proven pathway 
to employment, providing members with val-
uable career skills, experience, and contacts 
to prepare them for the 21st century work-
force and to help close the skills gap in the 
United States; 
Whereas, in 2009, Congress passed the bi-
partisan Serve America Act (Public Law 111– 
13; 123 Stat. 1460), which authorized the ex-
pansion of national service, expanded oppor-
tunities to serve, increased efficiency and ac-
countability, and strengthened the capacity 
of organizations and communities to solve 
problems; 
Whereas national service programs have 
engaged millions of people in the United 
States in results-driven service in the most 
vulnerable 
communities 
of 
the 
United 
States, providing hope and help to individ-
uals with economic and social needs; 
Whereas national service and volunteerism 
demonstrate the best of the spirit of the 
United States, with people turning toward 
problems and working together to find com-
munity solutions; and 
Whereas AmeriCorps Week, observed in 
2020 from March 8 through March 14, is an 
appropriate time for the people of the United 
States— 
(1) 
to 
salute 
current 
and 
former 
AmeriCorps members for their positive im-
pact on the lives of people in the United 
States; 
(2) to thank the community partners of 
AmeriCorps for making the program pos-
sible; and 
(3) to encourage more people in the United 
States to become involved in service and vol-
unteering: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) encourages the people of the United 
States to join in a national effort— 
(A) to salute AmeriCorps members and 
alumni; and 
(B) to raise awareness about the impor-
tance of national and community service; 
(2) acknowledges the significant accom-
plishments of the members, alumni, and 
community partners of AmeriCorps; 
(3) recognizes the important contributions 
made by AmeriCorps members and alumni to 
the lives of the people of the United States; 
and 
(4) encourages individuals of all ages to 
consider 
opportunities 
to 
serve 
in 
AmeriCorps.

OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 11, 2020 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud Fayleen 
Denny for receiving the Arvada Wheat Ridge 
Service Ambassadors for Youth award. 
Fayleen Denny is a student at Drake Middle 
School and received this award because her 
determination and hard work have allowed her 
to overcome adversities. 
The dedication demonstrated by Fayleen 
Denny is exemplary of the type of achieve-
ment that can be attained with hard work and 
perseverance. It is essential students at all 
levels strive to make the most of their edu-
cation and develop a work ethic which will 
guide them for the rest of their lives. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to 
Fayleen Denny for winning the Arvada Wheat 
Ridge Service Ambassador for Youth award. I 
have no doubt she will exhibit the same dedi-
cation and character in all of her future ac-

SAVE YOUR TOOTH MONTH 
HON. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 11, 2020 
Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to celebrate the month of May 2020 
as Save Your Tooth Month, and beginning on 
May 3, 2020, the 13th annual observance of 
Root Canal Awareness week, as we recognize 
our nation’s highly skilled endodontists and 
their work to preserve their patients’ natural 
teeth. 
There was a time when state-of-the-art den-
tal care meant having a painful tooth pulled by 
a barber, blacksmith or wig maker. Modern 
dentistry ushered in the use of anesthesia, ra-
diography, sterile technique, and increasingly 
sophisticated methods to address pain caused 
by an infected or broken tooth. But despite in-
credible advances in restorative dentistry, 
peer-reviewed studies continue to demonstrate 
that the best solution to preserve a patient’s 
quality of life still lies in saving the natural 
tooth whenever possible. 
Modern endodontic treatment is devoted to 
preserving our natural teeth when decay, trau-
ma, a failed crown or repeated procedures to 
treat dental caries lead to inflammation or an 
infection of a tooth’s root pulp. Using the latest 
techniques and skills acquired after completing 
years 
of 
advanced 
training, 
skilled 
endodontists can often save a painful tooth 
and spare their patients the discomfort and ex-
pense of additional treatment required to fill 
the gap caused by an extraction. 
Like their colleagues who specialize in gen-
eral dentistry, through organizations including 
the American Association of Endodontists and 
the American Board of Endodontics, our na-
tions’ endodontists devote thousands of hours 
to professional development, funding research 
on advancing the standard of care, fundraising 
to support clinics that provide free dental care 
to the underserved, and educating the general 
population about the importance of practicing 
good oral hygiene and preserving one’s nat-
ural teeth. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of the thousands 
of patients who have had their teeth and their 
smiles preserved by our nation’s skilled 
endodontic practitioners, I salute the skills, 
years of training, and dedication of our na-
tion’s endodontists, and the more than 350 
endodontists practicing in my home state of Il-
linois.

standing women who are making a difference

tional Charity League. She has held numerous 
leadership positions in the Burbank Council

ing secretary, financial secretary, auditor, and

ice Award chairman. A supporter of the arts, 
Ms. Burroughs has been an engaged volun-
teer with the Burbank Arts for All Foundation 
and was the recipient of their prestigious 
Champion of the Arts Community Volunteer 
Award in 2017. Her extensive volunteer serv-
ice list also includes the Burbank Educational

RECOGNIZING RICHARD ‘‘DICKIE’’ 
LAMAR CREW 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 11, 2020 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the life of Richard 
‘‘Dickie’’ Lamar Crew, who passed away on 
Friday, March 6th, at the age of 81. 
Dickie was born on May 5th, 1938, in 
Crews, Alabama. He was a beloved member 
of his community in Pontotoc, Mississippi, and 
was known for his kindness. 
Left to cherish his memory is his wife of 64 
years, Shelia Simmons Crew; his children, 
Tabby Vaughn, Kerry Crew, and Richie Crew; 
his grandchildren, Codi Crew, Bryer Vaughn, 
Max Crew, Kenny Houpt, and Kassidy Houpt, 
as well as many friends and extended family 
members. 
Dickie’s life was one of service, grace, and 
love for his family and community. He will be 
greatly missed by all whom he encountered.

HONORING THE 70TH WEDDING AN-

MARIE MCGINNIS

Wednesday, March 11, 2020 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to congratulate my dear friends, 
Leroy and Ovia Marie McGinnis, on their 70th 
wedding anniversary. Married on March 10, 
1950, the couple has experienced a lifetime of 
ups and downs, successes and failures, and 
many wonderful memories. Together, they 
raised six children, Pat (spouse Bob) Bell, 
Jack (spouse Edna) McGinnis, the late Kim 
(spouse Diana) McGinnis, Don (spouse Tina) 
McGinnis, Renee (spouse Ed) Bowen, and 
Michele McGinnis. They have also been 
blessed with 18 grandchildren and 34 great- 
grandchildren. I can only imagine the excite-
ment and exuberance at their family get- 
togethers. 
The couple both grew up in Gainesville, 
Missouri, and were reunited after Leroy’s dis-
charge from the Navy. He was on his way to

San Diego when he decided to stop and visit 
his sister, who was Ovia Marie’s best friend at 
the time. It only took three short months for 
the couple to realize they had ‘‘together for-
ever’’ in mind, and eloped. They recall the 
memory fondly and laugh at their lack of gran-
deur; Ovia wore jeans down the aisle and 
didn’t tell her parents about the wedding until 
she missed her curfew that night. 
Over the years, Leroy and Ovia became 
well-respected community and business lead-
ers in their town of Cuba, Missouri. Mr. 
McGinnis founded and still serves as CEO of 
McGinnis Wood Products, which he started in 
1968. They make hand-crafted wine and bour-
bon barrels that are sold to some of the coun-
try’s top-selling distilleries, as well as compa-
nies in Japan, Spain, and Scotland. After five 
generations of family involvement, I think it’s 
safe to say this is a remarkable family-owned 
company that will serve as a legacy for the 
McGinnis family for generations to come. 
I am so honored for the opportunity to wish 
the McGinnis’s a happy anniversary and many 
joyous returns of the occasion.

GARRETT FINDLEY 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER

Wednesday, March 11, 2020 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud Garrett Fin-
dley for receiving the Arvada Wheat Ridge 
Service Ambassadors for Youth award. 
Garrett Findley is a student at Oberon Mid-
dle School and received this award because 
his determination and hard work have allowed 
him to overcome adversities. 
The dedication demonstrated by Garrett Fin-
dley is exemplary of the type of achievement 
that can be attained with hard work and perse-

strive to make the most of their education and 
develop a work ethic which will guide them for 
the rest of their lives. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to Gar-
rett Findley for winning the Arvada Wheat 
Ridge Service Ambassador for Youth award. I 
have no doubt he will exhibit the same dedica-

HONORING THE LIFE OF R. ALEX-
ANDRA 
‘SANDY’ 
LARSON 
OF 
NORTH BRUNSWICK 
HON. BONNIE WATSON COLEMAN 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 11, 2020 
Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor the life and contribu-
tions of R. Alexandra Larson, better known as 
Sandy, who spent her life advocating for social 
justice, fighting for those who might otherwise 
be voiceless and placed justice higher than 
any other objective. 
Sandy dedicated her career to the taxing 
but incredible work of fighting for civil rights 
and supporting children and families. Unlike 
many, she walked the walk, living her values 
daily. As an attorney with the Middlesex Coun-
ty Office of the Public Defender, she devel-
oped projects to document and address dis-
proportionate rates of arrest and incarceration 
for people of color—working to correct a dis-
parity that plagues our society even now. As 
Director for the Governor’s Committee on Chil-
dren’s Services Planning, Sandy was respon-
sible for reports that to this day are the basis 
for broad advocacy efforts for children across 
my state, and she is credited with helping to 
develop the New Jersey Youth Services Com-
mission—established to fix the way courts 
handle at-risk youth. 
Sandy’s efforts to affect positive change 
were not limited to her professional endeav-
ors. In her free time, she shared her three de-
grees—a BA in Journalism from Douglass Col-
lege, an M.S.W. from Rutgers School for So-
cial Work and a J.D. from Rutgers School of 
Law—Newark—and her years of expertise 
with community organizations that included the 
Metuchen-Edison NAACP and the Latino 
Leadership Alliance of New Jersey. She 
served on the Board of Trustees of the New 
Jersey Training School for Boys, the Chil-
dren’s Trust Fund of New Jersey, the Coalition 
for Hispanic Rights in Criminal Justice, the 
Middlesex County Local Advisory Council for 
Alcohol and Drug Abuse, and the ASAP pro-
gram. 
What her friends and family, including her 
daughter Francesca Dulce Larson, her mother 
Francesca Nadalini, granddaughter Serafina 
Giovanna, and her siblings Michela, Marthe, 
Robb, Gus, Giovanna, George, Jayne Amelia, 
and Jonathan, will no doubt miss the most is 
her spirit. Sandy was fearless and fierce. She 
was about building a brighter future for every-
one and connecting the dots that would im-
prove the world just a little with every action 
she took. She was a light in every room, the 
link that connected so many friends, and a 
source of love in a world that could use more 
of it. I am so grateful for everything she ac-
complished and devoted herself to with her 
time here, and I send my heartfelt prayers to 
all those who join me in mourning her loss.

TRIBUTE 
TO 
DR. 
ANI 
HALABI— 
28TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT 
WOMAN OF THE YEAR 
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 11, 2020 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in honor of Women’s History Month. Each 
year, we pay special tribute to the contribu-
tions and sacrifices made by our nation’s 
women. It is an honor to pay homage to out-
standing women who are making a difference 
in my Congressional District. I would like to 
recognize a remarkable woman, Dr. Ani Halabi 
of Tujunga, California. 
Ani Halabi is a devoted wife and mother and 
has been a successful optometrist for fifteen 
years. Born in Tehran, Iran, Ani was first intro-
duced to optometry while working in her fam-
ily’s business marketing and designing an eye-
glass frame line. She attended Glendale Com-
munity College and California State University, 
Northridge where she received a bachelor’s 
degree in biology, all while working in a pri-
vate optometry practice. Dr. Halabi continued 
her education at the Southern California Col-
lege of Optometry, where she received her 
Doctorate of Optometry. She specializes in pri-
mary eye care, which includes diagnosis and 
treatment of ocular diseases, prescribing con-
tact lenses and glasses, and working with 
local eye surgeons. 
Dr. Halabi is an active volunteer and mem-
ber of several local non-profit organizations. 
She is a 10-year member of the Armenian 
American Medical Society, where she has 
helped coordinate the vision clinic at the Glen-
dale Health Festival, which serves more than 
1,500 disadvantaged patients annually. She is 
also a 10-year member of the Glendale North-
west Lions Club, where she is a co-chair of 
the sight conservation committee, and under 
her leadership, the club has provided free eye-
glasses to people in need and has offered eye 
screenings that have restored and improved 
vision to more than 3,000 individuals. In addi-
tion, as a Glendale Healthy Kids organization 
volunteer, Ani has provided free eye care 
services for underprivileged families and chil-
dren. She has also volunteered at vision 
screenings at several schools, including St. 
Mary’s Richard Tufenkian Preschool & Kinder-
garten, Glendale High School and Herbert 
Hoover High School, educating parents about 
routine eyecare and providing early detection 
of vision problems. 
Dr. Halabi has made it her mission to help 
aspiring optometrists by mentoring students 
and offering internships at her practice. She 
regularly sits on the panel of Glendale Com-
munity College’s Professional Alumni and has 
volunteered at college events to guide stu-
dents who have an interest in the field of op-
tometry. Ani’s successes have been recog-
nized by ‘‘Women in Optometry’’ magazine, 
who featured her on their cover. 
Dr. Halabi and her husband, Steve Khroyan 
live in Tujunga and have two children, Nara 
and Sareen. 
I ask all Members to join me in honoring this 
exceptional, well-respected woman of Califor-
nia’s 28th Congressional District, Dr. Ani 
Halabi.

INTRODUCTION OF THE CARGO 
FLIGHT DECK SECURITY ACT 
HON. JESU´S G. ‘‘CHUY’’ GARCI´A 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 11, 2020 
Mr. GARCI´A of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to introduce the bipartisan Cargo 
Flight Deck Security Act along with my col-
league, Brian Fitzpatrick. 
The safety and security of our pilots, our 
skies, and the flying public are at stake. 
Today, many cargo planes have no cockpit 
barrier and without the safety of hardened 
flight deck doors, the aircraft’s interior is open, 
and the flight deck is completely exposed. 
This leaves pilots without a means to ade-
quately separate the flight crew from per-
sonnel riding in the bulkhead or potential 
cargo-hold stowaways. 
Ultimately this is about parity and safety. 
Cargo pilots have been fighting for hardened 
cockpit doors for 18 years, and this bill will 
solve that long overdue security concern. 
After 9/11, regulatory changes put in motion 
requirements to require hardened cockpit 
doors for all aircraft to separate the flight deck 
from the cargo/passenger bay. Unfortunately, 
after 2003, the TSA made changes to its re-
quirements and erected a wholesale carve-out 
for cargo airplanes, effectively creating dis-
parate requirements for passenger and cargo 
airline safety. 
The Cargo Flight Deck Security Act ensures 
all pilots are protected by hardened cockpit 
doors and takes steps to keep our skies and 
flying public safe. 
I urge this body to pass advance this legis-
lation.

Ecko Gonzalez is a student at North Arvada

cause his determination and hard work have 
allowed him to overcome adversities. 
The dedication demonstrated by Ecko Gon-
zalez is exemplary of the type of achievement

verance. It is essential students at all levels

HONORING MARTY LYNCH, PH.D. 
HON. BARBARA LEE 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 11, 2020 
Ms. LEE of California. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor Marty Lynch, Ph.D, as he 
retires as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) to 
CEO Emeritus of LifeLong Medical Care. Dr. 
Lynch’s service in the healthcare industry 
spans over 60 years, including service as a 
non-profit administrator for more than 30 
years. Dr. Lynch is involved in national, state, 
and local public policy and research activities 
related to health access for the uninsured, 
long-term care models, chronic care, and fi-
nancing care for disabled populations. In addi-
tion, Dr. Lynch is a lecturer at the University 
of California Berkeley in the School of Social 
Welfare. 
Dr. Lynch received his Ph.D. in Social and 
Behavioral Sciences from the University of 
California, San Francisco, and an MPA from 
the Kennedy School of Government at Har-
vard. Dr. Lynch began his journey with Life-
Long Medical Care in 1982 when the organi-
zation was known as The Over Sixty Clinic. 
After becoming the CEO in 1984, Dr. Lynch 
expanded The Over Sixty Clinic into what is 
now LifeLong Medical Care. 
Dr. Lynch co-founded the Elderly Sub-Com-
mittee of the National Association, recently 
served on California’s State task force to ex-
amine policy changes necessary for the inte-
gration of primary care and mental health 
services and helped to develop a California 
plan for Alzheimer’s disease. One thing Dr. 
Lynch’s work does, is that it underscores the 
humanity in caregiving, as we all are con-
nected to someone directly or indirectly who is 
aging. 
Through Dr. Lynch’s vision and leadership, 
LifeLong Medical has had a profound impact 
on the lives of seniors in our communities and 
now extends that care to people of all age de-
mographics. LifeLong is a 25-site Federally 
Qualified Health Center that also provides

care on the street, in patients’ homes, and in 
nursing homes and supportive housing. 
Dr. Lynch operates on the belief that 
healthcare is a right not a privilege. This is re-
flected in the LifeLong’s commitment to pro-
viding integrated services to the disabled el-
derly and homeless communities. He has en-
sured this by providing access to medical as-
sistance, mental health support, and sub-
stance abuse therapy to our elderly and vul-
nerable populations. 
On a personal note, I am thankful for Dr. 
Lynch’s wise counsel and friendship. I have 
known Dr. Lynch since 1974. 
Today, I join the LifeLong Medical Care 
Health Services in celebrating the retirement 
of Dr. Marty Lynch. On behalf of California’s 
13th Congressional District, I am honored to 
commend Dr. Marty Lynch for his lifelong work 
in healthcare. I thank him for his continued 
service to the community as CEO Emeritus of 
LifeLong Medical Care Services for All.

RECOGNIZING DEVELOPMENTAL 
DISABILITIES AWARENESS MONTH 
HON. VAN TAYLOR 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 11, 2020 
Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, today, I rise 
to recognize the 33rd Anniversary of National 
Developmental Disabilities Awareness Month. 
This important commemoration serves to raise 
awareness and promote respect for those with 
intellectual 
and 
developmental 
disabilities 
while also recognizing the importance of inclu-
sion. 
It is estimated there are over 4.6 million in-
dividuals in the United States and over 
250,000 individuals in North Texas alone with 
intellectual and developmental disabilities. 
Texas’ Third Congressional District is the 
home to incredible organizations including 
Cornerstone Ranch, My Possibilities, and 
LifePath Systems. These dedicated organiza-
tions, staffs, and volunteers serve as steadfast 
advocates, fostering opportunities for these in-
dividuals to realize their full potential. 
My Possibilities has become a national 
model in vocational education and job place-
ment for adults with intellectual and develop-
mental disabilities throughout North Texas, 
dramatically changing the landscape for these 
individuals. 
LifePath Systems is a community-based or-
ganization designed to assist individuals and 
families dealing with intellectual disabilities 
and developmental delays through its collabo-
rative efforts with other community partners to 
ensure the best possible care for all Texans. 
And Cornerstone Ranch provides a family- 
centered environment where residents thrive, 
confidence is nurtured, and special needs 
adults are empowered to lead productive lives 
as members of the community. 
While these are just a few entities in North 
Texas who work tirelessly to expand the con-
versation of inclusion, accessibility, and life-
long independent living skills, I am honored to 
recognize their efforts on behalf of all Collin 
County residents with intellectual and develop-
mental disabilities. I ask my colleagues in the 
House of Representatives to join me in thank-
ing these organizations and recognizing the 
importance 
of 
Developmental 
Disabilities 
Awareness Month. 
INTRODUCTION OF THE SUPPORT 
OUR MILITARY WORKING DOGS 
ACT 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 11, 2020 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, today I 
introduce the ‘‘Support Our Military Working 
Dogs Act’’ in commemoration of National K9 
Veterans Day later this week. The United 
States K9 Corps was established on March 
13, 1942. As chairman of the House Armed 
Services Subcommittee on Readiness, I want 
to thank my vice-chairman Congressman 
ANDY KIM (D–NJ) for his support as the bill’s 
original cosponsor. 
Military working dogs serve on the front 
lines with our troops to defend our nation and 
provide recuperating services for our veterans 
and their former handlers. Caring for these 
dogs in the field and once they return home is 
our responsibility. 
The ‘‘Support Our Military Working Dogs 
Act’’ would ensure that our nation’s military 
working dogs receive the best possible care 
and direct the U.S. Department of Defense to 
work with veterans’ service organizations and 
other nonprofits to support their long-term 
care, once adopted by their former handler’s 
into loving homes. 
In 2019, the U.S. special forces raid that led 
to the death of ISIS terrorist leader Abu Bakr 
al-Baghdadi included an American special op-
erations military working dog Belgian Malinois 
named Conan. During the raid, Conan chased 
al-Baghdadi into a tunnel underneath a com-
pound in northern Syria, where he then deto-
nated his suicide vest. During the chase, 
Conan was injured by live electrical wires in 
the tunnel. Under current federal law, the De-
partment of Defense cannot cover the veteri-
nary expenses of military working dogs like 
Conan, when they retire from duty or recu-
perate from injury while adopted. 
The ‘‘Support Our Military Working Dogs 
Act’’ would remove these restrictions to au-
thorize the Department of Defense to provide 
support for retired or injured military working 
dogs after their adoption. The bill would also 
ensure that the U.S. government covers all 
transportation costs associated with transfer-
ring retired military animals, including horses, 
to their new adopted homes, building upon the 
success of the Military Working Dog Retire-
ment Act of 2015. 
As chairman of the Subcommittee on Readi-
ness, which has jurisdiction over military work-
ing dogs, I urge all our Members of the House 
to join me and Congressman KIM in cospon-
soring this important legislation.

have no doubt she will exhibit the same dedi-
cation and character in all of her future ac-
complishments.

HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 11, 2020 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, fifty- 
five years ago, in Selma, Alabama, hundreds 
of heroic souls risked their lives for freedom 
and to secure the right to vote for all Ameri-
cans by their participation in marches for vot-
ing rights on ‘‘Bloody Sunday,’’ ‘‘Turnaround 
Tuesday,’’ or the final, completed march from 
Selma to Montgomery. 
Those ‘‘foot soldiers’’ of Selma, brave and 
determined men and women, boys and girls, 
persons of all races and creeds, loved their 
country so much that they were willing to risk 
their lives to make it better, to bring it even 
closer to its founding ideals. 
More than a half century has passed since 
that day of horror and carnage on the bridge, 
a day so terrible that it was immediately 
named and will be forever known as ‘‘Bloody 
Sunday.’’ 
But we will always remember. 
Madam Speaker, people come from all over 
the world to stand on the bridge, ground sanc-
tified and consecrated by the blood and cour-
age and sacrifice of nameless, innocent, ordi-
nary persons whose commitment to justice 
changed America for the better. 
People come to Selma and remember 
Bloody Sunday with reverence and awe for 
the same reasons they visit the beaches of 
Normandy and the cornfields of Gettysburg. 
We remember them because we know in 
our hearts that President Lyndon Johnson was 
right when he addressed the Congress and 
the nation the evening of March 15, 1965, 
stating: 
‘‘At times history and fate meet at a single 
time in a single place to shape a turning point 
in man’s unending search for freedom. 
‘‘So it was at Lexington and Concord. 
‘‘So it was a century ago at Appomattox. 
‘‘So it was last week in Selma, Alabama.’’ 
On Bloody Sunday, John Lewis and Rev-
erend Hosea Williams led 600 courageous, 
unarmed men, women, and children in a 
peaceful march across the Edmund Pettus 
Bridge from Selma to Montgomery to drama-
tize to the nation the aspiration of African 
Americans to become full citizens and to par-
ticipate in the political process. 
As they crossed the highest part of the 
bridge, the marchers were viciously attacked

by Alabama state troopers, who ridiculed, tear- 
gassed, clubbed, spat on, whipped and tram-
pled them with their horses. 
In the end, John Lewis’s skull was fractured 
by a state trooper’s nightstick, and 17 other 
marchers were hospitalized. 
In direct response to Bloody Sunday, Con-
gress passed, and President Lyndon Johnson 
signed into law the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 
the greatest victory of the Civil Rights Move-
ment, and the most significant advance in the 
field of civil rights and democratic governance 
since the Civil War Amendments of the 1860s. 
Selma marked a turning point in history be-
cause it was the place where moral courage 
met and overcame entrenched power. 
The Edmund Pettus Bridge is more than a 
bridge; it was the portal through which Amer-
ica left the dark days of its past and marched 
into a better and brighter future. 
And the trail of that journey is marked by 
the blood of the foot soldiers who led the way. 
Despite, or perhaps because of its proven 
effectiveness in breaking down voting barriers, 
on June 25, 2013, the Supreme Court, issued 
the shameful decision in Shelby County, Ala-
bama v. Holder, which struck down Section 
4(b) of the VRA, which immobilized the heart 
of the Act, the preclearance provisions of Sec-
tion 5. 
The Supreme Court did this even though a 
bipartisan Congress in 2006 voted nearly 
unanimously to reauthorize Section 5 of the 
Voting Rights Act. 
After hearing from more than 90 witnesses 
with a diverse range of views, holding 20 
hearings, and evaluating a 15,000–page 
record, 98 Senators and 390 House members 
voted to re-authorize Sections 4(b) and 5 of 
the Voting Rights Act. 
Within hours of the Supreme Court’s Shelby 
County decision, the State of Texas, where in 
2012 alone Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act 
blocked the state’s discriminatory photo ID law 
and intentionally discriminatory redistricting 
plans, announced its intention to implement 
those measures immediately. 
This is only one of many examples of for-
merly covered states taking advantage of the 
gap in Section 5 protection by reverting back 
to laws that the Voting Rights Act previously 
blocked. 
The struggle to ensure that all Americans 
can participate equally in the political process 
continues. 
And that is why I was proud to cosponsor 
and support H.R. 4, the Voting Rights Ad-
vancement Act, which corrects the damage 
done to the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and 
commits the national government to protecting 
the right of all Americans to vote free from dis-
crimination and without injustices that pre-
viously prevented them from exercising this 
most fundamental right of citizenship.

IN RECOGNITION OF PROFESSOR 
RONALD WOODS DISTINGUISHED 
CAREER AT EASTERN MICHIGAN 
UNIVERSITY 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 11, 2020 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate Professor Ronald Woods 
on his retirement and recognize his forty-three 
years of distinguished service at Eastern 
Michigan University (EMU). His contributions 
to our community have been many and de-
serve significant recognition. 
In his decades of service as a teacher and 
mentor, Professor Ronald Woods has become 
a pillar of the EMU community. A former pov-
erty law attorney, Ronald Woods started at 
EMU in 1976 as a lecturer in the Afro-Amer-
ican Studies Program, and later went on to 
become a professor and the first head of the 
African American Studies Program. In these 
capacities, Professor Woods provided valuable 
expertise on the intersection of race, public 
policy, and law. He shed light on the impact of 
social policy on our nation’s schools and com-
munities and published on a variety of dif-
ferent topics like African policy in the horn of 
Africa. In addition to his work as a professor 
and scholar, Professor Woods was highly re-
garded in serving as Director of the Institute 
for the Study of Children, Families, and Com-
munities. 
Today, we celebrate Professor Woods for 
his leadership and unrelenting dedication to 
his students, community, and academia. 
Throughout his tenure, Professor Woods 
mentored hundreds of students and was rec-
ognized for his professionalism, kind de-
meanor, and passion for educating our na-
tion’s future leaders. Beyond academics, Pro-
fessor Woods’s contributions included serving 
as interim president of the Michigan Council of 
Black Studies, a member of the Board of Di-
rectors of the African American Cultural and 
Historical Museum of Washtenaw Court, and 
member 
of 
the 
Board 
of 
Directors 
of 
Wittenberg University, and even a member of 
the Board of the Ann Arbor Housing Commis-
sion, just to name a few of his many out-
standing accomplishments. In addition, Pro-
fessor Wood was paramount to the success of 
key community programs. As an early leader 
and the first coordinator of Washtenaw County 
My Brother’s Keeper, Professor Woods em-
powered multiple generations to build commu-
nity, change narratives, and improve outcomes 
for 
young 
men 
and 
boys 
of 
color 
in 
Washtenaw County. Professor Wood’s years 
of service have impacted the lives of many, 
and his continued dedication provides a last-
ing example of what we should all endeavor to 
accomplish—to effect change, be compas-
sionate leaders, and do all we can to make a 
difference in the world. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Ronald Woods as he retires 
from Eastern Michigan University. We thank 
him for his decades of distinguished of service 
and leadership and wish him the best of luck 
in all future endeavors.

TRIBUTE TO MEYMUNA HUSSEIN- 
CATTAN—28TH 
CONGRESSIONAL 
DISTRICT WOMAN OF THE YEAR 
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 11, 2020 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in honor of Women’s History Month. Each 
year, we pay special tribute to the contribu-
tions and sacrifices made by our nation’s 
women. It is an honor to pay homage to out-
standing women who are making a difference 
in my Congressional District. I would like to 
recognize a remarkable woman, Meymuna 
Hussein-Cattan of the Echo Park neighbor-
hood of Los Angeles, California. 
Meymuna Hussein-Cattan is an executive, 
social entrepreneur and world traveler dedi-
cated to shifting the narrative around refugees 
in the United States. Born in an Ethiopian ref-
ugee camp in Somalia, Ms. Hussein-Cattan’s 
childhood gave her a first-hand view of the 
struggles 
of 
refugee 
children. 
In 
1983, 
Meymuna’s father moved to San Diego when 
he was resettled by the International Rescue 
Committee. Young Meymuna and her mother, 
Owliya Dima followed the next year. 
Growing up with a passion for human rights 
and advocacy, Meymuna went on to receive 
her bachelor’s degree in Social Sciences from 
the University of California, Irvine and a mas-
ter’s degree in Organizational Management 
from Antioch University. Hussein-Cattan wrote 
her Master’s thesis about Tiyya, which pro-
posed creating a nonprofit organization that 
supports refugees starting a new life in South-
ern California. Tiyya means ‘‘my love’’ in 
Oromo, which is one of the languages spoken 
in Ethiopia. Over the years, Tiyya has im-
proved the lives of refugees in the greater Los 
Angeles area through the arts, education and 
recreational activities. 
With generosity and public service as core 
principles and the help of her mother, 
Meymuna made it her mission to assist refu-
gees to find stability and navigate the similar 
complex challenges that her family went 
through. As co-founder and CEO, Ms. Hus-
sein-Cattan has played a vital role in Tiyya’s 
successes over the past decade, which in-
clude impacting the lives of hundreds of peo-
ple each year with a variety of programs. As 
funding sources dwindled, Meymuna ex-
panded the organization’s mission by launch-
ing Flavors from Afar, a program that helps 
refugees develop culinary careers in their new 
country and build connections within the 
neighborhood. 
Apart from her work at Tiyya, Meymuna is 
committed to broadening her scope and 
reaching other advocates with her expertise. A 
speaker at many organizations and univer-
sities, she enjoys sharing her insights and ex-
perience to motivate and inspire the future 
wave of human rights activists. The Los Ange-
les refugee community has greatly benefited 
from 
the 
generosity 
and 
dedication 
of 
Meymuna Hussein-Cattan. 
Meymuna and her husband, Shukry live with 
their daughter, Suraya in Echo Park. 
I ask all Members to join me in honoring this 
exceptional, well-respected woman of Califor-
nia’s 28th Congressional District, Meymuna 
Hussein-Cattan.

Fulton Jackson is a student at Mandalay

The dedication demonstrated by Fulton

HONORING THE LIFE OF JAMES 
‘‘JIM’’ MCGRATH 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 11, 2020 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to ask the House of Representatives to join 
me in remembering the life of James ‘‘Jim’’ 
McGrath, a longtime District of Columbia resi-
dent and our city’s leading activist for tenants’ 
rights, on the occasion of his death on March 
3, 2020. 
Jim McGrath, born in Boston, Massachu-
setts on September 1, 1937, came to the Dis-
trict after serving in the U.S. Army. He studied 
literature at American University and received 
a master’s degree in literature at Georgetown 
University. Jim worked full time as he pursued 
his education. He worked and volunteered for 
the American Cancer Society, he was a re-
search assistant for a D.C. law firm and a 
paralegal for a telecommunications firm in 
D.C. 
These experiences led him to the House of 
Representatives, where he worked for former 
Speaker of the House John W. McCormack of 
Massachusetts. Jim worked as a clerk for the 
House Committee on the Judiciary and later 
became a leading expert on federal pay 
issues as an employee of the Library of Con-
gress. 
As a D.C. resident who lived in Dupont Cir-
cle for 45 years, Jim became well acquainted 
with the challenges and abuse D.C. tenants 
face. He established the D.C. Tenants Advo-
cacy Coalition (TENAC) in 1992 and became 
the lead advocate for tenants for rent control 
in the District. His advocacy for tenants’ rights 
brought him before the D.C. Council, and his 
expertise led to legislation such as the cre-
ation of the Office of the Tenant Advocate 
(OTA), the confirmation of the Chief Tenant 
Advocate and the Tenants’ Right To Organize 
Act. Jim’s leadership will be especially missed 
today, when the high cost of housing is per-
haps the most important issue facing our city. 
With the passing of Jim McGrath this month, 
the District has lost a friend—and so have I. 
Jim McGrath devoted his life to the tenants of 
this city and became the face and soul of ten-
ants’ rights. Jim was the acknowledged leader 
of citizen efforts to protect tenants in this 
highcost city. 
Madam Speaker, I ask the House of Rep-
resentatives to join me in honoring James 
‘‘Jim’’ McGrath, my friend and a leader in our 
city, for his life of service. I extend my deepest 
condolences to Jim’s family.

RECOGNIZING GHANAIAN 
AMERICANS 
HON. DANNY K. DAVIS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 11, 2020 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, I rise to recognize the Ghanaian 
Americans and their contributions. 
The United States of America is home to 
hundreds of thousands of people of Ghanaian 
heritage—including those who were born on 
this soil, those whose family emigrated for 
economic opportunity, and those who recently 
traced their roots to ancestors taken from 
Ghana as part of the Transatlantic slave trade. 
The U.S. and Ghana share a long history 
with Kwame Nkrumah studying in American 
universities and working alongside Civil Rights 
leaders before becoming President of the first 
sub-Saharan African country to gain independ-
ence from colonization on March 6, 1957. 
Today, the relationship between the two 
countries has deepened with the Year of Re-
turn and Ghana being among the top five Afri-
can countries with a fast-growing immigrant 
population in the U.S. Last year Speaker 
PELOSI
led a Congressional delegation to 
Ghana, where she called the trip ‘‘trans-
formative,’’ recognizing the great strides the 
country has made since gaining independ-
ence. 
However, today more than ever, Ghanaians 
living in the United States worry about immi-
gration policies as well as accessing health 
and economic opportunities once promised by 
the American dream. In 2020, when everyone 
should be counted by the U.S. Census, many 
Ghanaians will surely be undercounted and 
underrepresented due to viral misinformation. 
Ghanaian Americans are an essential fabric 
in the tapestry of America from the cab driver 
to the medical doctor. You will find them in all 
parts of the country from Chicago to New York 
to suburban Ohio and Massachusetts. The 
culture is hard to ignore with sumptuous food, 
the iconic Kente cloth, storytelling, inventions, 
architecture, and music. 
This is important to remember as the United 
States continues to encourage democracy and 
bolster partnerships with Ghana in recognizing 
the 63rd anniversary of Ghana’s independ-
ence, its thriving heritage, and the long-
standing positive relationship between our two 
countries.

CELEBRATING WOMEN’S HISTORY 
MONTH 
HON. BARBARA LEE 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 11, 2020 
Ms. LEE of California. Madam Speaker, 
today, we rise to celebrate Women’s History 
Month and reflect on the generations of Amer-
ican women and their many contributions that 
have brought us to this place in our history. 
Every March, we honor the countless con-
tributions that women have made to this na-
tion. Fearless leaders like the late Congress-
woman Shirley Chisholm, Coretta Scott King, 
Dorothy Heights, Dolores Huerta, Patsy Mink 
and Wilma Mankiller paved the way for us. We

would not be where we are today without 
them. 
March is also our time to reflect on the work 
that remains to achieve true equality. Last 
year, we saw women challenging the status 
quo everywhere from sports and politics to 
emerging STEM fields and corporate boards. 
In fact, I am proud to serve in this Congress 
that has 127 women—the most in U.S history. 
But too many women are still fighting to 
break down barriers. 
The injustices that remain are many. Wheth-
er it is unequal pay or attacks on reproductive 
health, the persistent shadow of sexism and 
prejudice still undermines women in our soci-
ety. 
But I know that women are resilient. 
And throughout it all, we are standing 
strong. 
Today, I am reminded of the words of my 
mentor, Shirley Chisholm. She said, ‘‘If they 
don’t give you a seat at the table, bring a fold-
ing chair.’’ 
I hope women and girls everywhere will 
bring their folding chairs and stay at the table. 
Because this month is more than a celebration 
of our past—it’s a call for a better future to-
morrow. 
Happy Women’s History Month.

TRIBUTE TO FLORDELINA ‘‘LENNI’’ 
LARA—28TH 
CONGRESSIONAL 
DISTRICT WOMAN OF THE YEAR 
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 11, 2020 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in honor of Women’s History Month. Each 
year, we pay special tribute to the contribu-
tions and sacrifices made by our nation’s 
women. It is an honor to pay homage to out-
standing women who are making a difference 
in my Congressional District. I would like to 
recognize a remarkable woman, Flordelina 
‘‘Lenni’’ Lara of the Atwater Village neighbor-
hood of Los Angeles, California. 
Flordelina ‘‘Lenni’’ Lara is a devoted wife to 
her husband, Yiu Lunglem, and mother of their 
two wonderful sons, Kyle and Lucas. Empha-
sizing education as a priority, Lenni has been 
a dedicated member of the Glenfeliz Boule-
vard Elementary School community since her 
family arrived in the neighborhood six years 
ago. She has taken on a prominent leadership 
role at the school where she dedicates her 
time to ensure the school runs smoothly and 
is a warm and nurturing environment for stu-
dents and parents alike. Lenni brings a posi-
tive attitude and strong work ethic to all that 
she does and serves as a role model for the 
students at the school. 
A selfless advocate for children and edu-
cation, Ms. Lara is responsible for supporting 
the development of several new programs at 
Glenfeliz Boulevard Elementary School. She 
played a critical role in creating a technology 
program with a 5-year vision, and volunteers 
in classrooms with technology instruction. She 
has been a member of the school’s govern-
ance committee and has served as a Parent 
Teacher Association officer for three years. 
Lenni volunteers with the school’s cooking 
classes by assisting the professional chefs 
who teach parents and students healthy ways 
to cook and eat. She also dedicates her time 
to helping the school organize activities, fund-
raisers, and projects that benefit the entire stu-
dent body. 
In addition to her work with the school, 
Lenni is a highly respected and an admired 
member of her community. She assists other 
parents to find their voices within the school 
community and encourages them to get in-
volved in school-related activities. 
Glenfeliz Boulevard Elementary School de-
pends upon Ms. Lara to support the school in 
every way needed. Her contributions are con-
sistent and impactful—each and every student 
benefits from her generous work. 
I ask all Members to join me in honoring this 
exceptional, well-respected woman of Califor-
nia’s 28th Congressional District, Flordelina 
‘‘Lenni’’ Lara.

HONORING RUBY ANN WHITTLE 
SMITH 
HON. DONALD M. PAYNE, JR. 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 11, 2020 
Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I ask my col-
leagues in the U.S. House of Representatives 
to join me as I rise to pay tribute to Ruby Ann 
Whittle Smith and celebrate her 100th birth-
day. 
Mrs. Smith was born on March 15, 1920, to 
George and Dora Whittle in South Hill, Vir-
ginia. In 1923, the Whittle Family moved from 
Virginia to Baltimore, Maryland. After a short 
stay there, they moved to New Jersey where, 
in 1925, they settled into their home in Or-
ange. Mrs. Smith attended the Orange Public 
Schools until her graduation from Orange High 
School in 1940. 
After high school, Mrs. Smith furthered her 
education at the New York Institute of Dietet-
ics. Once she graduated, she worked as an 
intern at Provident Hospital in Baltimore, MD. 
When she finished her internship, Mrs. Smith 
returned to New Jersey and became a dieti-
cian at the Community Hospital in Newark, NJ. 
Eventually, she left the hospital and began a 
career at the Western Electric Company, a 
subsidiary of AT&T, in Kearney, NJ, where 
she made telephones for distribution. She 
worked in the Western Electric office for 30 
years before she retired in 1985. 
She was supported throughout her life by 
her husband, Willie E. Smith, Sr. They were 
married for 37 years. In addition, she was an 
active member of New Hope Baptist Church in 
East Orange and served as a volunteer to 
Hospice, Inc. Many church members continue 
to visit Mrs. Smith to this day through the New 
Hope Visiting Ministry. She was a very active 
member of the East Orange Senior Citizens 
Exercise and Wellness Program. She enjoyed 
the program’s social events, participated in the 
exercise programs, transported those who 
needed a ride around town, and rode in Me-
morial Day parades. 
Today, she spends her time with friends at 
the Orange Retirement Club in East Orange, 
where she enjoys the exercises, BINGO, 
lunch, outings and plenty of fun. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my fellow members 
of the U.S. House of Representatives to join 
me and recognize Ruby Ann Whittle Smith for 
bringing joy and love to the people of my dis-
trict for 100 years.

INTRODUCTION OF THE ADVANC-
ING THE QUALITY AND UNDER-
STANDING OF AMERICAN AQUA-
CULTURE (AQUAA) ACT 
HON. COLLIN C. PETERSON 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 11, 2020 
Mr. PETERSON. Madam Speaker, I include 
in the RECORD the following letter from Strong-
er America Through Seafood (SATS) reflecting 
their support for my recently introduced Ad-
vancing the Quality and Understanding of 
American Aquaculture (AQUAA) Act, H.R. 
6191, which will enable the growth of sustain-
able U.S. marine aquaculture. 
MARCH 11, 2020. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: We are contacting 
you regarding the Advancing the Quality and 
Understanding 
of 
American 
Aquaculture 
(AQUAA) Act, legislation sponsored by Reps. 
Collin Peterson (D–MN) and Steven Palazzo 
(R–MS) that will enable the growth of sus-
tainable U.S. marine aquaculture. 
Demand for healthful, affordable, and sus-
tainable protein is increasing dramatically. 
Globally, aquaculture is one of the fastest 
growing forms of food production. According 
to the World Bank, by 2030, aquaculture’s 
share in global seafood production will ex-
pand to supply over 60% of fish for human 
consumption, whereas wild-capture seafood 
production will remain steady. Marine aqua-
culture requires no land, minimal fresh 
water and a relatively small amount of space 
to provide abundant, healthful seafood mak-
ing it the most efficient means of animal 
protein production. Further, farmed seafood 
provides a source for local, traceable, afford-
able meal options that benefit public health. 
The United States’ long coastline, expan-
sive Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), skilled 
labor force, superior technology, ample feed 
sources, and growing seafood market put it 
at the top of the list of countries with aqua-
culture potential. In fact, a doubling of U.S.

aquaculture production to about 1 million 
tons could create an additional 50,000 direct 
and indirect jobs, assuming 20 direct jobs per 
1,000 tons of seafood produced, or five jobs 
per 1,000 tons in equipment, feeds, proc-
essing, marketing, and food service. These 
jobs could provide stable, year-round em-
ployment opportunities in coastal and fish-
ing communities where opportunities are 
often limited and seasonally dependent. 
Unfortunately, the U.S. ranks only 16th 
globally in aquaculture production. The 
problem? U.S. marine aquaculture is con-
strained by regulatory hurdles, including 
overlapping jurisdiction of federal, state, and 
local governments, and the absence of a 
clearly-defined permitting process. As a re-
sult, American investment, jobs, and tech-
nology are forced overseas while our depend-
ence on imported seafood continues to rise— 
The U.S. now imports 91% of our seafood. 
Until Congress acts, the economic, environ-
mental and societal benefits of aquaculture 
will remain inaccessible in the U.S. 
To remedy these challenges, the AQUAA 
Act establishes a clear permitting process 
for U.S. marine aquaculture and prioritizes 
environmental and societal health by estab-
lishing National Standards for Sustainable 
Offshore 
Aquaculture. 
AQUAA 
leverages 
modern siting and monitoring technologies 
to mitigate impacts on other ocean-based in-
dustries and ecosystems. It also provides for 
strict federal enforcement and includes a 
process for robust public input which ensures 
that coastal communities and states are con-
sidered prior to permitting new operations. 
In short, AQUAA provides much-needed reg-
ulatory certainty for U.S. marine farmers 
while also preserving the environment, local 
economies and public health. AQUAA will 
lead to increased U.S. seafood production 
that benefits ALL Americans. 
With quick action by the U.S. Congress, 
Americans may soon see marine aquaculture 
become a reality for the betterment of our 
businesses and of our citizens. Please contact 
us for more details on how AQUAA might 
benefit your constituents. 
Sincerely, 
STRONGER AMERICA THROUGH SEAFOOD.

TRIBUTE TO VICTORIA MALONE— 
28TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT 
WOMAN OF THE YEAR 
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 11, 2020 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in honor of Women’s History Month. Each 
year, we pay special tribute to the contribu-
tions and sacrifices made by our nation’s 
women. It is an honor to pay homage to out-
standing women who are making a difference 
in my Congressional District. I would like to 
recognize a remarkable woman, Victoria Ma-
lone of Montrose, California. 
Victoria Malone is a devoted wife and moth-
er with a lifelong passion for giving back to her 
community. She has been a part of the 
Montrose community since her teenage years, 
when she attended Crescenta Valley High 
School (CVHS) before going on to study at 
San Diego State University. 
As the Executive Director of the Montrose- 
Verdugo City Chamber of Commerce (MVCC), 
Ms. Malone has positively impacted many 
small businesses, and having owned and op-
erated her own business in the area, she has 
made it her mission to provide vital support to 
the local businesses. Victoria has helped the 
chamber become financially sustainable, thus 
allowing the MVCC to provide numerous chari-
table donations back to the Montrose commu-
nity, and she leads the chamber in organizing 
the annual Montrose Oktoberfest, a commu-
nity event that has been produced for over 
four decades. 
In addition to her work with the MVCC, Vic-
toria devotes her time to volunteering for sev-
eral local events and organizations. She has 
volunteered for the Montrose Shopping Park 
Association Small Business Saturday and the 
association’s Arts and Crafts Festival as Street 
and Traffic Patrol, and for several years, for 
the Montrose Christmas Parade Association. 
Victoria and her husband, Michael Marshall 
volunteered at the Crescenta Valley Fireworks 
Association event, where they worked from 
set-up to clean-up, and also at the 2018 Prom 
Plus event for CVHS students. Ms. Malone 
and her family helped pay off the lunch meal 
debt for CVHS students and families who 
were struggling to cover that expense. In addi-
tion, for the last two decades, they have 
opened up their home to several rescue dogs 
who were in search of their forever homes. 
One of the greatest examples of Victoria’s 
generosity is the four weeks that she spent 
volunteering in Kathmandu, Nepal, where she 
assisted an orphanage that helped children 
and elder women. Victoria donated school 
supplies, clothing, and backpacks, provided art 
instruction to the children, and helped manage 
the kitchen and supplies. Using her back-
ground as a life coach, she donated her serv-
ices to local Nepalese women at a Woman’s 
Empowerment Workshop. 
I ask all Members to join me in honoring this 
exceptional, well-respected woman of Califor-
nia’s 28th Congressional District, Victoria Ma-
lone.

INTRODUCTION OF THE RESILIENT 
ELECTIONS 
DURING 
QUAR-
ANTINES AND NATURAL DISAS-
TERS ACT OF 2020 
HON. EARL BLUMENAUER 
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 11, 2020 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, the 
Novel Coronavirus (‘‘COVID–19’’) has already 
infected more than 100,000 people worldwide 
and killed more than 4,000 people. Meanwhile, 
millions of Americans are anxious about their 
health, safety, and job security. Earlier today, 
the World Health Organization officially de-
clared COVID–19 a global pandemic and the 
director of the National Institute of Allergy and 
Infectious 
Diseases 
acknowledged 
that 
COVID–19 is ‘‘going to get worse.’’ 
Without 
broad 
congressional 
action, 
COVID–19 has the potential to disrupt every 
aspect of American society, including the 2020 
primary and general elections. The virus will 
likely impact voters who cannot leave their 
homes as well as those who are under man-
datory or self-imposed quarantines at the rec-
ommendation of health experts. To make mat-
ters worse, the Election Assistance Commis-
sion has found that 58 percent of all poll work-
ers in 2018 were over 60—the prime at-risk 
population for COVID–19. 
The Resilient Elections During Quarantines 
and Natural Disasters Act of 2020 requires 
that states and localities create and publish a 
plan to operate their elections if large numbers 
of voters or poll workers have been subjected 
to a mandatory quarantine or a self-quarantine 
at the advice of government officials or health 
experts. In the event that a quarter of states

another infectious disease, or a natural dis-
aster, this legislation also requires states to 
offer all voters the ability to vote by absentee 
ballot. Finally, this legislation requires that 
states offer prepaid self-sealing postage to 
voters who vote absentee in order to reduce 
the risk associated with infection at post of-
fices. 
It is critical that we take a broad view of the 
response to COVID–19 and ensure that our 
elections are safe, secure, and accessible to 
all.

IN RECOGNITION OF ANAN AMERI 
AS 
SHE 
IS 
NAMED 
THE 
2020 
ARAB AMERICAN OF THE YEAR 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 11, 2020 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Dr. Anan Ameri as she is 
named the 2020 Arab American of the Year 
by ACCESS. Dr. Ameri’s lifetime of community 
service and activism is worthy of commenda-
tion, and we are proud to recognize her 
achievements today. 
Anan Ameri is a pillar of Washtenaw Coun-
ty. For over forty years, she has dedicated her 
career to advocating for social justice and eq-
uity, upholding immigrant rights, and pre-
serving Arab American stories. Dr. Ameri, an 
author, educator, and activist, is especially 
known in our community as the founding di-
rector for the Arab American National Mu-
seum. Thanks to her steadfast leadership and 
revolutionary vision, she secured the muse-
um’s Smithsonian affiliation, making it the only 
Arab American organization in the prestigious 
network. In addition, Dr. Ameri is the national 
president of the Palestine Aid Society of 
America and was inducted to Michigan’s Hall 
of Fame for her extraordinary efforts in 2016. 
Today, we celebrate Anan Ameri for her life-
time of service to her community. Born in Da-
mascus, Syria and raised in Amman, Jordan, 
Dr. Ameri understands the daily trials and 
tribulations immigrants experience. As such, 
she has advocated for their voices and con-
tinues to fight to ensure their rights are 
upheld. Beyond her career in activism, she 
also has served as a mentor to young woman. 
She has nurtured women to pursue their 
dreams, strive for excellence, and embrace 
their heritage. Dr. Ameri truly embodies the 
hopes and dreams of immigrants coming to 
America and has made a difference in our 
Michigan community. Her years of service 
have impacted the lives of many, and her con-
tinued dedication provides a lasting example 
for what we should all endeavor to accom-
plish—to effect change, be compassionate 
community members, and do all we can to 
make a difference in the world. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Dr. Anan Ameri. Her decades 
of selfless service make her a deserving re-
cipient of the Arab American of the Year 
Award. I am grateful for her lasting impact and 
wish her continued success in the years 
ahead.

TRIBUTE TO BARBARA WEBER— 
28TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT 
WOMAN OF THE YEAR 
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 11, 2020 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in honor of Women’s History Month. Each 
year, we pay special tribute to the contribu-
tions and sacrifices made by our nation’s 
women. It is an honor to pay homage to out-
standing women who are making a difference 
in my Congressional District. I would like to 
recognize a remarkable woman, Barbara 
Weber of La Can˜ada Flintridge, California. 
Born on a military base in Southern Cali-
fornia, Barbara Gillis grew up in several 
states, including Massachusetts, Ohio, Michi-
gan and Texas. Graduating as the Valedic-
torian from Ladycliff College in Highland Falls, 
New York, Barbara majored in math and 
minored in chemistry, and earned a job at Bell 
Labs in New Jersey where she met her hus-
band, Bill. Barbara and Bill moved to Pasa-
dena, California in 1967 where Bill was em-
ployed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). 
After teaching kindergarten at a local school, 
Ms. Weber soon joined the staff at JPL. 
Barbara was one of the few women working 
at JPL in 1969, and she single-handedly 
changed their maternity policy regarding preg-
nant employees by working until her due date. 
She stayed at JPL until 1974, when she and 
Bill 
bought 
their 
house 
in 
La 
Can˜ada 
Flintridge. Ms. Weber then took classes in 
computing and accounting at Pasadena City 
College and began consulting for local busi-
nesses.

attractions. 
Her life’s work was caring for her children 
and late husband. She was the adoring wife of 
the late James A. Rice and a devoted mother,

greeter, and assisted with the acolytes for 
many years. 
In addition, Annie was an active volunteer 
with the Meals on Wheels Program for more 
than 20 years. The program allowed her to do 
what she enjoys most—travel around her 
adopted hometown to improve the lives of oth-
ers. 
But Annie’s favorite passion is hats. At 
church, she can be found in her pew regally 
adorned in one of her many decorated hats 
with matching gloves and handbag. Her favor-
ite color is purple, but her accessories can be 
a rainbow of colors. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me and recognize Annie Virginia Johnson 
Rice for bringing joy and love to so many peo-
ple and celebrate her 100th birthday.
