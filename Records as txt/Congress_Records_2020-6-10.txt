PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Our Father in heaven, may Your 
name be praised. Lord, use our Sen-
ators today to permit justice to rule in 
our land. Remind them that righteous-
ness exalts a nation, but sin is an equal 
opportunity destroyer. As our law-
makers strive to do Your will, reward 
their 
faithfulness. 
Illuminate 
their 
hearts with Your wisdom and love. 
Help them to remember that the entire 
ethical requirement is fulfilled by lov-
ing your neighbor as you love yourself. 
May this love for those in need hasten 
the day when justice will roll down like 
waters and righteousness like a mighty 
stream. Continue to be our strength 
and fortress, sustaining us with Your 
amazing grace. 
We pray in Your merciful name. 
Amen.

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
LOEFFLER). 
The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 
minute in morning business, please. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
THE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICING 
REDUCTION ACT 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
the virus pandemic underscores the 
very vital contribution pharmaceutical 
sciences make for our Nation’s public 
health, our Nation’s economic pros-
perity, and our way of life. It also con-
firms that we need a policy solution to 
treat soaring healthcare prices. 
The American people want the best 
medical cures at prices they can afford. 
The Prescription Drug Pricing Act is a 
winning solution. Let’s get it to the 
President’s desk without delay. It will 
help secure our American way of life in 
a post-pandemic world for generations 
to come. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
THE FIRST AMENDMENT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
yesterday, I explained that we cannot 
let the First Amendment become an-
other casualty of this troubled mo-
ment. No matter how charged the 
issue, peaceful protests must be pro-
tected, from suppression by govern-
ments or hijackings by violent mobs. 
In the United States of America, people 
get to protest. 
In our country, people also get to 
worship. As I explained yesterday, 
local officials cannot selectively en-
force health restrictions to privilege 
some 
First 
Amendment 
gatherings 
over others. If mayors are posing for 
photographs in massive demonstra-
tions, there is no reason why small, 
careful church services should stay 
banned. 
These are formal constitutional ques-
tions, but our American culture of free 
expression and open debate is not only 
threatened from the top down by the 
government, it can also dry up from be-
neath. 
If we are to maintain the civic dis-
course that has made us great, Amer-
ican citizens and American institutions 
need to want it. In the last several 
years, the New York Times has pub-
lished op-eds from Vladimir Putin, the 
foreign minister of Iran, and a leader of 
the Muslim Brotherhood. They have 
published an essay arguing for greater 
normalization of pedophilia. As far as I 
know, none of those decisions occa-
sioned public revolts from the paper’s 
staff, hand-wringing apologies from the 
editors, or an overhaul of the mast-
head. Presumably, it was understood 
that pushing the envelope and airing 
disagreements are necessary in a free 
market of ideas.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2840 
June 10, 2020 
But 1 week ago, the Gray Lady fi-
nally met her match. Vladimir Putin? 
No problem. Iranian propaganda? Sure. 
But nothing could have prepared them 
for 800 words from the junior Senator 
from Arkansas. 
Senator COTTON wrote an op-ed ex-
plaining a position which one survey 
found 58 percent of Americans agreed 
with. He argued that leadership in sev-
eral cities had proven they either 
couldn’t or wouldn’t stop the riots, so 
President Trump should use Federal 
troops to secure the peace, as several 
Presidents have in our history. His 
view was controversial, no question, 
but there is also no question it was a 
legitimate view for a Senator to ex-
press. 
Looting and arson were crippling cit-
ies nightly. Some local authorities 
seemed to be functionally sacrificing 
their cities’ small businesses to ap-
pease the mob. In Chicago, we have 
since learned, even Democratic alder-
men were literally crying and pleading 
with their Democratic mayor to do 
something, they said. So a U.S. Sen-
ator wrote about it. 
Immediately, his idea was met with 
strong criticism. Now, that ought to be 
par for the course. In a free and open 
society, speech begets speech. Argu-
ments beget counterarguments. We dis-
cuss and debate as fellow citizens. But 
that is not quite what happened. In-
stead of trying to win the argument, 
the far left tried to end the discussion. 
By now, we all know the routine. We 
have seen this movie before. Rather 
than actually rebut speech, the far left 
tried to silence the speaker with a mix-
ture of misrepresentations, sanctimo-
nious moralizing, and bizarre, emo-
tional word salads that nobody else 
could have standing to question. This 
silencing tactic has escaped from the 
ivory tower and is spreading through-
out American life. This sounds like 
Mad Libs mixture between a therapy 
session and a university’s H.R. depart-
ment. 
So, sure enough, instead of attempt-
ing to defeat Senator COTTON’s ideas, 
the left set out to ban him from polite 
society. Some New York Times em-
ployees flooded social media to claim 
their bosses have risked reporters’ 
physical safety with the Senator’s 
scary words. Outside leftists blasted 
the paper for airing the argument. The 
Times itself began lying about what 
Senator COTTON had said. The paper’s 
own Twitter account has claimed he 
had called for a crackdown on peaceful 
protests, when he specifically distin-
guished them from violent rioters. 
One of the Times’ own opinion writ-
ers devoted her own column the next 
day to calling his view ‘‘fascist’’ and 
proclaiming him outside ‘‘the bounds 
of legitimate debate.’’ 
Remember, this is a sitting Senator 
discussing a proposition that had the 
majority of support from the American 
people, discussing a power that Con-
gress gave to Presidents 213 years ago 
and which Presidents in the past have 
exercised. 
Oh, but the facts couldn’t hold a can-
dle to the hurt feelings. The New York 
Times erred grievously by making peo-
ple confront a different viewpoint. 
They had hurt their feelings by making 
them confront a different viewpoint. 
They had to atone. So when the dust 
settled, a top opinion editor was gone. 
His deputy was reassigned. The piece 
was pulled out of the print edition, and 
a wandering multiparagraph apology 
now precedes it online. We are talking 
the New York Times. I understand the 
new editor has made it clear that staff 
should notify her immediately if any 
published opinion makes them uncom-
fortable—if 
any 
published 
opinion 
makes them uncomfortable? 
One of our Nation’s most storied 
newspapers just had its intellectual 
independence challenged by an angry 
mob, and they folded like a house of 
cards. A jury of people on Twitter in-
dicted them as accessories to a thought 
crime, and instead of telling them to 
go take a hike, the paper pleaded 
guilty and begged for mercy. Their 
readers’ comfortable bubble was re-
inflated. Their safe space was safe 
again. 
Now, our colleague from Arkansas 
has a unique job. The far left cannot 
write angry emails to a university 
president or a publisher to get him 
fired. He cannot be silenced by profes-
sions of outrage or the use of magic 
words like ‘‘problematic.’’ His only 
bosses are his constituents. 
This broader, leftwing obsession with 
banning 
heretics 
from 
the 
public 
square will be poison for this country if 
it persists. Our Republic can survive a 
pandemic, it can survive civil unrest, 
but ideas and deliberation are our very 
foundation. America cannot be Amer-
ica if civil disagreement becomes a 
contradiction in terms. 
The liberal tradition in this country 
used to pride itself on being broad- 
minded, but we have spent years 
watching major universities slowly ex-
change debate for uniformity and rigor 
for psychological comfort. Now, we see 
the free press repeating that error. 
Let’s hope we look back on this as a 
silly anomaly and not a sad turning 
point for our democracy. 
f 
THE GREAT AMERICAN OUTDOORS 
ACT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
now on to an entirely different matter. 
Thanks to the bipartisan leadership of 
colleagues like Senators DAINES, GARD-
NER, PORTMAN, ALEXANDER, MANCHIN, 
and WARNER, we are attending to legis-
lation that will shape the future of the 
great American outdoors for the bet-
ter. 
It is fitting that the legislation be-
fore us comes with support of such a 
broad bipartisan coalition because our 
national parks, forests, and other pub-
lic lands are treasured in every State 
of our Union by the hunters and an-
glers who look forward to the morning 
stillness of the Black Hills and the Big 
South Fork of the Cumberland, by the 
hikers who camp and plot weekend es-
capes in Shenandoah and Joshua Tree, 
by the school groups and researchers 
who connect with history at Gettys-
burg and Mesa Verde. 
Every year, hundreds of millions of 
our people—our fellow Americans and 
visitors from around the world—share 
the gift of our Nation’s public lands. 
Even more Americans in surrounding 
communities benefit from the jobs and 
the prosperity that are supported by 
tourism and recreation. 
This country’s public lands comprise 
a tremendously diverse array of land-
scapes, wildlife, historic sites, and nat-
ural resources. They are spread out 
across 419 parks, 568 refuges, and hun-
dreds of millions of acres of managed 
space. 
They didn’t pop up overnight. It has 
taken more than a century of dedicated 
work to designate, acquire, and main-
tain the public lands Americans enjoy 
today. It is the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund, which this legislation 
will give permanent support, that 
makes them accessible for generations 
to come. 
Today, more than 5 million Ameri-
cans rely directly on outdoor recre-
ation for their livelihood. They con-
tribute to $778 billion in economic ac-
tivity. In recent years, their industry’s 
growth has outpaced an economy that 
was red-hot in its own right. A bright 
future for our public lands is a bright 
future for our Nation, and a predict-
able, consistent support provided by 
the LWCF will play a critical role in 
these efforts. 
Take my home State of Kentucky, 
for example. For years, I have been 
proud to advocate for LWCF funding to 
conserve some of the Bluegrass’s pre-
cious wilderness and historic sites. 
Back in 1996, Kentucky was the only 
State without a national wildlife ref-
uge, and it was my legislation that 
helped secure the creation of one at 
Clarks River. 
Last year, additional legislation I au-
thored helped create another sanctuary 
for wildlife and recreation at the con-
fluence of the Green and Ohio Rivers. 
Already, the Fish and Wildlife Service 
has marked the Green River Wildlife 
Refuge as the LWCF’s top funding pri-
ority for the coming year. The dedi-
cated resources in this legislation 
would be instrumental in the growth of 
Kentucky’s newest national treasure, 
along with other areas like Clarks 
River. 
As the LWCF drives the preservation 
of more national wetlands, forests, and 
battlefield space in Kentucky, I suspect 
every one of my colleagues is equally 
proud of similar efforts in their own 
States. This bill advances a noble cause 
that has added benefit of being a sound 
investment. 
According to one recent analysis, 
every dollar spent through the Land 
and Water Conservation Fund turns 
out $4 in economic benefit. Every $1 
million directed toward the LWCF in

TAXPAYER FIRST ACT OF 2019— 
MOTION TO PROCEED—Resumed 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the Senate will re-
sume consideration of the motion to 
proceed to H.R. 1957, which the clerk 
will report. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 75, H.R. 
1957, a bill to amend the Internal Revenue 
Code of 1986 to modernize and improve the 
Internal Revenue Service, and for other pur-
poses. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I suggest the ab-
sence of a quorum.

The senior assistant legislative clerk

Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the order for the quorum call 
be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader is recognized. 
JUSTICE IN POLICING ACT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
yesterday at the Fountain of Praise 
Church in Houston, TX, a funeral serv-
ice was held in honor of the life of 
George Floyd, whose death has moved 
hundreds of thousands of people across 
America and around the world to 
peacefully march against police vio-
lence. Today, his brother Philonise 
Floyd will testify in front of the House 
Judiciary Committee. 
It is hard to imagine the courage it 
takes, so soon after the tragic, awful, 
and brutal loss of a family member, to 
not only grieve in the national spot-
light but to turn that pain into action. 
There have been many reasons for 
Americans to be shocked and outraged, 
angry and frustrated with the injustice 
they have seen in their country, but 
the entire Floyd family has given the 
Nation reason to hope. 
Now, Democrats in the House and 
Senate have proposed legislation that 
would directly respond to the issues of 
racial bias and excessive force in our 
police departments. The Justice in Po-
licing Act would ban the use of choke 
holds, limit the transfer of military 
equipment to local departments, make 
it easier to hold police misconduct ac-
countable, and institute a whole lot of 
reforms to help prevent that mis-
conduct in the first place. It is a com-
prehensive proposal, and many of the 
experts on racism, discrimination, and 
inequality in police departments have 
had large input into the bill. 
We need action on the Justice in Po-
licing Act as soon as possible, and we 
Democrats in the Senate will work like 
hell to make it happen. The moment 
calls for bold and broad-scale change. 
We need wholesale reform, not piece-
meal reform. We cannot approach this 
debate by cherry-picking one or two re-
forms and calling the job complete. It 
is my worry that is what our Repub-
lican colleagues intend to do. We need 
a strong bill. The Justice in Policing 
Act is where we should begin. 
The Senate is a collaborative institu-
tion, at least by design, but there is 
one person alone who decides what leg-
islation reaches the floor, and that is 
Leader MCCONNELL. For 2 weeks I have 
asked him to commit to a debate and a 
vote on a police reform bill by July 4— 
an open debate and certainly an ability 
to vote on the Justice in Policing Act. 
I still have not received an answer. 
Is it too much to ask that, as hun-
dreds of thousands, if not millions, are 
in the streets, when the vast majority 
of Americans think we need reform, 
that the leader spend some floor time 
here so we can debate this issue and 
maybe move forward for the first time 
in a long time? I don’t think so. But 
our leader is silent, missing in action, 
as he is on so many different major 
issues that face America. 
After House and Senate Democrats 
released the draft legislation on Mon-
day, yesterday, Senate Republicans an-
nounced they would put together ‘‘a 
working group’’ to prepare their own 
set of proposals. Working groups are all 
fine and well, but it is critical that we 
pursue comprehensive reform, not seek 
the lowest common denominator, and 
it is critical that we get a real commit-
ment to consider strong legislation on 
the floor. 
Unfortunately, in the aftermath of 
other recent moments of national 
strife, particularly the mass shootings, 
President Trump, Leader MCCONNELL, 
and Senate Republicans make the right 
noises—let’s study it; let’s consider it— 
but never follow through. 
Leader MCCONNELL
once promised 
that a debate on expanding background 
checks would be ‘‘front and center’’ on 
the Senate floor after shootings in 
Dayton and El Paso. ‘‘What we can’t do 
is fail to pass something,’’ he said. Yet 
there was no debate on expanding 
background checks, and the Republican 
majority in the Senate did exactly 
what Leader MCCONNELL said that it 
could not—it failed to pass anything on 
gun safety. 
So while I welcome ideas from our 
Republican colleagues, we need a hard 
and fast commitment from the Repub-
lican leader to put real, broad-scale po-
lice reform on the Senate floor before 
July 4. 
Americans, please, be watching the 
Senate. Watch the leader. Watch the 
Republicans. 
Is this going to be another situation 
just like with gun control, just like 
with background checks, where they 
talked a good game, tried to let the 
issue fade away, and did nothing? The 
Nation—the Nation—will not let this 
issue fade away, I assure my Repub-
lican friends. 
CORONAVIRUS 
There is another major crisis in the 
country 
at 
the 
moment 
as 
well. 
COVID–19 continues to kill and infect 
Americans. Case numbers are rising in 
Western States—Arizona, New Mexico, 
California, and Oregon. The massive 
disruption to economic activity ini-
tially left more than 40 million—40 
million—Americans without work. 
This week it became official: The 
United States has been in recession— 
the first one in many years—since Feb-
ruary. 
In truth, the issues of racial justice 
and COVID–19 are not unrelated. The 
COVID–19 pandemic disproportionately 
kills Black Americans. Communities of 
color have less access to quality 
healthcare, greater food insecurity, 
greater percentages of poverty, and a 
disproportionate number of our front-
line essential workers—41.2 percent— 
are African American and Latino. Yet 
you are starting to hear my friends on 
the other side strum sunny chords be-
cause one jobs report wasn’t quite as 
awful as it might have been, awful as it 
was. 
The President made a revolting com-
ment that the recent jobs report was a 
great day for George Floyd and equal-
ity, even though it showed African- 
American unemployment continuing to 
rise. What a horrible comment. 
Everyone is rooting for our country 
to return to normal as quickly and as 
safely as possible and for our economy 
to rebound with similar speed, but un-
employment sits at 13 percent—higher 
than any point since the great reces-
sion—and the President and my Repub-
lican colleagues are ready to declare 
victory. 
After saying that another COVID re-
lief bill was likely in June, Leader 
MCCONNELL
has told the Republican 
caucus not to expect another relief bill 
until late July at the earliest—late 
July at the earliest, as millions are out 
of work, millions risk being removed 
from their homes, millions can’t feed 
their families. 
Racial justice, civil rights, a global 
pandemic, an economic disaster—this 
is truly a time of historic challenge, 
and Leader MCCONNELL and the Senate 
Republicans are missing in action. No

commitment to consider comprehen-
sive police reform. No urgency to pro-
vide our country the desperately need-
ed relief from COVID–19. Instead, Lead-
er MCCONNELL
is likely to schedule 
votes next week on two circuit court 
nominees—Justin 
Walker 
and 
Cory 
Wilson—both of whom have expressed 
deep-seated 
antipathy 
toward 
our 
healthcare law. And I am not aware of 
either of them embracing civil rights, 
voting rights so desperately needed in 
this country. 
That is right—in the middle of a pub-
lic health crisis, the Republican major-
ity is planning to confirm rightwing 
judges who have spoken out against 
our healthcare law. Watch what they 
do, not what they say. And what they 
are doing is regressiveness—it is not 
even a lack of moving us forward; they 
attempt to move us backward with 
rightwing judges who want to turn the 
clock back. 
FBI MISCONDUCT INVESTIGATION 
Even more shocking—do you think it 
can get worse? It does with this Repub-
lican majority. The Judiciary Com-
mittee tomorrow will hold a hearing. 
The Republican chairman will continue 
his pursuit of President Trump’s wild 
conspiracy theories about the 2016 elec-
tion, asking for scores of subpoenas to 
chase down alleged misconduct by the 
FBI. 
Let me get this straight: The Repub-
lican Party will eagerly focus on law 
enforcement 
that 
affects 
President 
Trump, but they aren’t ready to com-
mit a focus on law enforcement, on ra-
cial equality when Americans demand 
it? I don’t hear anyone other than the 
President and his acolytes demanding a 
reinvestigation as it affects President 
Trump on a largely discredited con-
spiracy theory. But that is what our 
Republican Senate friends are doing, 
showing how removed they are from 
the national needs and the national 
sentiment. 
Senate Republicans are ready to 
issue nearly 100 subpoenas to trash the 
FBI to protect President Trump, but 
they can’t commit to debate on one bill 
to reform police departments to pro-
tect African Americans. Instead of ad-
dressing the real challenges African 
Americans face, the Republican con-
spiracy 
caucus 
is 
obsessed 
with 
visciously attacking the FBI for pro-
tecting our national security while 
Putin interfered in our democracy. 
What a bizarre and outrageous inver-
sion of our Nation’s priorities. 
Now I am glad my friend from Illi-
nois is here because it was his leader-
ship that will cause, in the Senate Ju-
diciary Committee, Senate Democrats 
to request subpoenas for Trump admin-
istration officials like Rick Gates, 
George 
Papadopoulos, 
and 
Michael 
Flynn, among others. These officials at 
one time or another have pled guilty to 
offenses related to Putin’s interference 
in the election. If the Republican con-
spiracy caucus wants to waste the Sen-
ate’s time dredging up old conspiracy 
theories, we are at least going to try to 
show and get the story straight and not 
just call a list of witnesses that they 
want. It is just crazy. Kangaroo court, 
kangaroo hearing. 
Let’s see if the Republicans have 
any—any—strength 
of 
conviction 
about what they are doing. If they did, 
they would allow the witnesses that 
Senator DURBIN and the other members 
of the Judiciary Committee have pro-
posed to come forward and tell their 
side of the story—quite contradictory 
to the witnesses that the Republican 
majority and the Republican chairman 
are calling. 
PROTESTS 
That is one crazy conspiracy theory, 
but yesterday the country was treated 
to another one. We seem, in Trump 
land, in the Trump world, to live in a 
world of conspiracy theories. Some 
crazy, discredited, rightwing blogger— 
sometimes with Russian information— 
tweets or writes something, and then 
President Trump goes right ahead and 
tweets it and talks about it. 
I am not in the habit of responding to 
every Presidential tweet—something I 
am sure my Republican colleagues are 
familiar with—but yesterday morning, 
the President tweeted a vicious attack 
on a 75-year-old constituent of mine 
who was seriously injured in Buffalo, 
NY. The President said he might have 
belonged to a radical group and that 
the event might have been a setup be-
cause the man ‘‘fell harder than was 
pushed.’’ 
It was disgusting, even for a Presi-
dent known for disgusting attacks. 
How small a man do you have to be to 
slander a 75-year-old protester recov-
ering in a hospital? This is the Presi-
dent of the United States, you have to 
remind yourself from time to time. 
This is what the President of the 
United States is doing—acting like a 
little 12-year-old schoolyard bully. 
Apparently, the conspiracy theory 
the President repeated on Twitter was 
originally posted on an anonymous 
blog and then amplified by a reporter 
who used to work for a Russian state 
media organization. 
It feels like it shouldn’t need to be 
said, but it has to be in a democracy 
where we believe in facts and truth: 
The President has an obligation to 
check out information before giving a 
platform to crazy conspiracy theories. 
He is the President, not just some guy. 
He can’t shrug his shoulders and say: 
Hey, I am just asking questions. He has 
access to national intelligence. 
I call on the President to apologize. I 
don’t expect he will. He never does. So 
I will just say to my Republican col-
leagues: You know how wrong his be-
havior is. You know it. Say so. Say so. 
Say something. How much do you let 
this President get away with? How 
long will you grimace inside or whisper 
to each other how crazy he is but not 
say a thing? You, my Republican Sen-
ate colleagues, may be the one check 
left on this President. Where are you? 
Where are you? 
I applaud the few Republicans who 
have spoken out, but just far too many 
have danced the familiar ‘‘hear no evil, 
see no evil’’ routine. Leader MCCON-
NELL was directly asked and couldn’t 
conjure a word of criticism for the 
President. 
If Republicans can’t call out the 
President on this instance, then what 
the heck are they doing here? If we 
can’t do legislation on the floor, even 
during one of the greatest national cri-
ses this country has faced, then what 
the heck are our Republican friends 
doing here? 
On COVID, on police reform, and all 
too often when the time comes to place 
a check on the President, the Repub-
lican majority is simply missing in ac-
tion. 
GEORGIA PRIMARY 
Madam President, one final word on 
the Georgia primary—yesterday, the 
State of Georgia held its primary elec-
tion. Across numerous counties and 
dozens of polling locations, Georgians 
waited 3, 4, and in some cases up to 7 
hours to cast a ballot. I saw the pic-
tures of the long lines. Numerous poll-
ing places failed to open on time; new 
voting machines may have malfunc-
tioned. Most disgracefully, many of the 
problems we saw yesterday occurred in 
precincts with high populations of peo-
ple of color. 
Of course, in past years, the Voting 
Rights Act would have empowered the 
Federal Government to oversee and ap-
prove the changes that the State of 
Georgia made to its election process— 
changes that may well have caused this 
election disaster. But the Roberts 
Court, in one of the most misguided de-
cisions in recent Supreme Court his-
tory, gutted the Voting Rights Act in 
the Shelby County decision and opened 
the door for the confusion we saw yes-
terday. 
The idea that seems to be in the 
Court’s mind—at least the majority of 
the Court—that the need for section 5 
preclearance had passed is clearly re-
futed by what happened in Georgia yes-
terday. We have legislation passed by 
the House that would fix this problem 
and protect voters against racial dis-
crimination and disenfranchisement, 
but it has been gathering dust here in 
the 
Senate, 
condemned 
to 
Leader 
MCCONNELL’s all too full legislative 
graveyard. Once again—once again— 
the Republican majority is missing in 
action, and this time it is on voting 
rights. 
The right to vote in a free and fair 
election is sacrosanct in this country. 
Yesterday, Georgia failed miserably for 
the second election in a row. There 
ought to be an immediate investiga-
tion, and the errors ought to be cor-
rected before the general election. The 
Senate should take up H.R. 4 and at the 
very least deliver the necessary re-
sources to election officials in the next 
COVID relief bill. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority whip is recognized.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2843 
June 10, 2020 
during the COVID–19 pandemic is the 
value of telehealth. As a resident of a 
rural State, I have long been a pro-
ponent of telehealth for the access it 
gives to rural communities. 
If you live in a major city, you usu-
ally don’t have to think too much 
about where you will find a doctor if 
you need one. If you need a cardiolo-
gist, for example, you don’t spend a lot 
of time worrying whether you will be 
able to find one within driving dis-
tance. In fact, there is a good chance 
you will have a choice—a wide range of 
choices for cardiologists. If you have a 
heart attack, you know you are in 
reach of at least one hospital and 
maybe several. 
That is not always the case for Amer-
icans in rural areas. In the smallest 
towns in America, access to specialty 
care can be a challenge. The only pro-
viders may be a primary care provider, 
a nurse, or a pharmacist. These pro-
viders are essential to rural families, 
but sometimes specialty care is needed. 
When there isn’t a specialist close by, 
telehealth can help get these rural pro-
viders and their patients the medical 
care they need from a remote location 
through the use of technology. 
The coronavirus has highlighted the 
fact that telehealth is a valuable re-
source for every American. During the 
pandemic, we have seen healthcare pro-
viders of all types turn to telehealth to 
continue serving their patients without 
running the risk of spreading the virus. 
Telehealth has always allowed patients 
to access a variety of services that 
might have been risky to obtain at an 
office or hospital during the height of 
the pandemic. 
Telehealth’s usefulness will extend 
long beyond the coronavirus crisis. 
While telehealth has particular value 
for rural areas, rural, urban, and subur-
ban areas alike experience provider 
shortages and a lack of access to care. 
The Association of American Medical 
Colleges estimates that there will be a 
shortage of up to 122,000 doctors in the 
United States by the year 2032. Even in 
areas without shortages, telehealth can 
make life easier for patients by reduc-
ing the number of times that they have 
to visit a doctor’s office for care. 
While there will always be a need to 
see a doctor in person, for many pa-
tients, some office visits can be re-
placed with telehealth appointments. 
That can make a big difference for in-
dividuals whose health requires them 
to see a doctor frequently. It is also a 
convenience for patients in the work-
force or caring for children or other 
family members who may need to be 
able to access services quickly and eas-
ily. 
I was very pleased when Congress ex-
panded access to telehealth in the 
coronavirus relief bills that we passed. 
We advanced the principles of value- 
based insurance design by allowing 
high-deductible health plans to cover 
telehealth services prior to a bene-
ficiary’s reaching his or her deductible. 
We also permitted the Secretary of 
the Department of Health and Human 
Services to waive certain Medicare re-
strictions on telehealth during a public 
health emergency, which has been 
hugely helpful to both seniors and the 
providers who care for them. With this 
waiver authority, providers can be paid 
for seeing patients in their homes, re-
gardless of whether the patient lives in 
a rural area. 
We also expanded the types of serv-
ices that are reimbursable via tele-
health under Medicare. In addition to 
video, providers are able to offer tele-
health appointments using audio-only 
technology, which is helpful for pa-
tients who don’t have access to inter-
net or to a smart device. 
Congress’s 
coronavirus 
legislation 
also increased telehealth access for 
community 
health 
centers, 
rural 
health clinics, home health hospice, 
and home dialysis for the duration of 
the pandemic. 
I would like to see us make many of 
these measures permanent. I will be 
pushing for that in the Senate over the 
coming months, along with the CON-
NECT for Health Act, which I have co-
sponsored 
with 
Senators 
SCHATZ, 
WICKER, CARDIN, WARNER, and HYDE- 
SMITH for the last several Congresses. 
This legislation, which influenced 
many of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, 
and Economic Security Act telehealth 
provisions, addresses restrictions that 
limit the use of telehealth in Medicare, 
including by providing waiver author-
ity for the Secretary of Health and 
Human Services. In addition, the legis-
lation would remove restrictions that 
affect Medicare reimbursement for In-
dian Health Service and facilitate the 
use of telehealth for emergency med-
ical services and mental health care. 
I will also continue to urge passage 
of the bill I introduced in March to in-
crease telehealth services in nursing 
facilities. My Reducing Unnecessary 
Senior Hospitalizations Act, or what 
we call the RUSH Act, would allow 
Medicare to establish agreements with 
a medical group to provide care to 
nursing home patients remotely, with 
the goal of reducing instances of avoid-
able trips to the emergency depart-
ment. Access to on-demand support 
from providers equipped to treat sen-
iors would enable a nursing home’s on-
site staff to immediately address a pa-
tient’s needs without waiting for emer-
gency room transport or for a doctor to 
arrive. As a result, patients would be 
more likely to receive early interven-
tion and avoid hospital visits, which 
can pose significant risk to the elderly, 
especially, of course, during the cur-
rent pandemic. 
Reducing the costs that come from 
untreated medical complications or ex-
pensive emergency room visits would 
also be a win for taxpayers and for the 
Medicare Program. One healthcare pro-
vider in my home State of South Da-
kota conducted a telehealth pilot pro-
gram to provide specialized care to 
nursing home patients and ended up 
saving Medicare more than $342 per 
beneficiary per month. That is a sig-
nificant savings. It is a savings that 
came from providing nursing home pa-
tients with better and faster care. 
One of the many reasons I push so 
hard to expand access to high-speed 
internet in rural areas and to ensure 
that rural communities have access to 
5G is because of the opportunities this 
provides for the expanded use of tele-
health, which translates into greater 
access to care for rural Americans. 
I will continue to do everything I can 
to make telehealth more available to 
underserved patients in rural commu-
nities and to the country as a whole. 
The coronavirus pandemic has high-
lighted just how valuable a resource 
telehealth can be for literally every 
American, and we should ensure that 
all Americans can access its benefits. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The mi-
nority whip. 
DACA 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I 
would like to follow up on the speech 
just made on the floor by my colleague 
from South Dakota because his obser-
vations about shortages when it comes 
to healthcare across America affect not 
just his State, South Dakota, but cer-
tainly affect Illinois and many other 
States as well. 
We are in desperate need of addi-
tional doctors and nurses and dentists 
and medical professionals. We are in 
need of more technology—telehealth, 
of course, is one of those technologies— 
to make sure we expand the reach of 
Medicare in the United States. In the 
midst of this coronavirus pandemic, we 
understand that now more than ever. 
That is why I have introduced legisla-
tion called the Health Heroes 2020 Act 
with specific design to dramatically ex-
pand the number of healthcare profes-
sionals. 
There is one way to reach that goal, 
I believe, and that is to incentivize 
medical students and dental students 
in America to make a commitment to 
serve in areas of greatest need in this 
country for at least 2 years and to re-
main in a reserve, if needed, for med-
ical emergency. What would they re-
ceive in return? Forgiveness of the cost 
of their medical education. 
Do you know that most doctors and 
dentists who graduate have a minimum 
of $240,000 in additional student debt 
over and above the undergraduate ex-
perience—$240,000 in debt when they be-
come licensed doctors and dentists? 
Some have even more. Imagine if those 
young men and women with all this 
talent and all this determination want 
to serve in the areas of greatest need 
but throw up their hands and say: I 
have to pay off this loan. I have no 
choice but to go to a different place. 
If we had the National Health Service 
Corps expanded to provide loans for the 
cost of medical education, with the in-
centive that those new medical profes-
sionals would serve in areas of great 
need, it would certainly help to solve a 
major problem in America. We feel it 
in the inner cities, but we feel it as in-
tensely, if not more so, in the rural and

smalltown areas of the Senator from 
South Dakota’s State and my State of 
Illinois. Could we work together to do 
this? Could we work to come up with 
the money to make sure these medical 
professionals are there? 
When we talk about doctors and 
nurses, don’t overlook the need for den-
tists. There are millions of people in 
my great State of Illinois who do not 
have ready access to dental care. The 
Illinois Dental Society once or twice 
each year has a free dental service 
weekend, and they—usually on a Sat-
urday—will allow any patient to come 
in and have dental care given to them 
for nothing. People wait in a queue, in 
a line overnight for this opportunity. 
Can you imagine having a problem 
with your teeth, some pain or discom-
fort or perhaps a disfigurement, and 
being unable to afford the care you 
need? For many of these people, this is 
their last chance, to wait in line all 
night to get in for free dental services 
from the Illinois Dental Society. I have 
seen it. It is remarkable, and my hat is 
off to the dental society and the den-
tists who provide these services. What 
an eye-opener to see all of these people 
who are in desperate need of dental 
care. 
We need more dentists. We need to 
make certain that they are accessible 
and affordable for Americans wherever 
they may live. I support the suggestion 
of the Senator from South Dakota 
when it comes to telehealth, but let’s 
make sure we have the men and women 
on the front end of the process who are 
still an important and critical and es-
sential part of the kind of professional 
medical service and dental service we 
all need. 
There is another way to help make 
sure we have enough dentists and doc-
tors. It is to make sure that those who 
are currently in the United States in 
dental school or medical school, who 
are protected by DACA, have a chance 
to remain in this country. 
By way of background, 20 years ago, 
I introduced a bill called the DREAM 
Act. The DREAM Act was designed for 
those brought to the United States as 
children, infants, and toddlers, who 
were brought into this country perhaps 
on a visitor’s visa and overstayed their 
visa and didn’t file the necessary docu-
ments and soon became undocumented 
in America. They didn’t leave. They 
grew up here. They were little kids who 
grew up in this country going to our 
schools, being part of America, and be-
lieving America was their future. 
Usually, sometime in their adoles-
cence, their parents would sit down and 
tell them the grim reality that they 
have no legal right to be in this coun-
try. Despite the fact that they knew no 
other country, spoke no other lan-
guage, pledged allegiance to the same 
flag we do, they were technically not 
legally in America. 
We introduced the DREAM Act to 
give them a chance. If they completed 
school and had no serious criminal 
issues, they would be given a chance to 
become American citizens. The bill 
went back and forth. It would pass the 
House one year and pass the Senate the 
next year. It would come up the major-
ity of the Senate but not 60 votes. 
It languished until I appealed to the 
President of the United States—then 
Barack Obama—and asked him if he 
would consider creating by Executive 
order some protection for these young 
people, and he did. This was the DACA 
Program, and under DACA, these same 
Dreamers I mentioned earlier would 
pay a substantial filing fee, go through 
a criminal background check, and be 
given, for 2 years, the—be spared of any 
threat of deportation and be given the 
right to legally work in this country. 
How many young people showed up 
for this Obama DACA Program and 
went through it successfully? There 
were 800,000. There were 800,000 from all 
around the country just to get a 
chance to go to school, to complete 
their dream, and to even serve in 
America’s military. They just want to 
be part of this country—800,000. 
What was going to happen to this 
program when a new President named 
Donald Trump came to office? The very 
first time I met President Trump was 
just minutes after he had been sworn in 
as President. There was a lunch for 
him—an inaugural lunch—in Statuary 
Hall, and I went up to him and intro-
duced himself. 
I said: Mr. President, I am begging 
you, do what you can to extend the 
protection of DACA to these 800,000 
young people. They are counting on it. 
He leaned over, and he looked at me, 
and he said: Oh, Senator DURBIN, don’t 
worry. We are going to take care of 
these young people. 
Well, that was the President’s assur-
ance, but unfortunately he didn’t keep 
his word. He decided, unfortunately, to 
abolish the DACA Program, saying 
that President Obama had no authority 
by Executive order to give this kind of 
protection. 
Then a number of people filed a case 
in court saying that the Executive 
order of the President should or should 
not be sustained. It had to be contested 
in court. Luckily, for the DACA recipi-
ents—800,000 of them—while the court 
case has been pending, they have been 
protected by court order from being de-
ported. But the decision is going to be 
made by the Supreme Court, and it 
could be made next week or in the 2 
weeks that follow. So in the month of 
June, the fate of 800,000 of these young 
people will be decided across the street 
in the Supreme Court. 
These are the young people who have 
become an important part of America. 
When the Republican Senator from 
South Dakota talks about shortages in 
medical personnel, I hope he knows 
that 41,000 of those DACA recipients 
are 
currently 
providing 
vital 
healthcare services in this pandemic 
that we are facing as a nation, and if 
they are judged to be deported and ille-
gal to work in this country and leave, 
it will leave a gap in the medical serv-
ices that this country desperately, des-
perately needs. 
Some of these young people are in-
credible. Their stories are nothing 
short of amazing. I would like to tell 
you of one here at this moment—Mar-
iana Galati. This is her photograph. 
Today, I want to tell you that she is 
the 122nd Dreamer whose story I have 
told on the Senate floor. 
Mariana came to the United States 
from Mexico when she was 5 years old. 
She grew up in Camden, NJ. It wasn’t 
an easy life. She grew up in a single- 
parent household, and her mother did 
not speak English. Here is what she 
told me about it: 
I had to fend for myself at a young age. I 
feel like I never got to have a childhood. I 
tried to never let that backdrop define me or 
stop me from my dreams. 
What was her dream? To become a 
nurse. While working at a bakery, she 
went to a technical school to become a 
medical assistant, and then in 2012 
President Obama created DACA. Mar-
iana was able to work as a medical as-
sistant. Here is what she said about 
DACA: 
Before DACA, I had no future, purpose, or 
chance of a better life. The fear with DACA 
is that it can go away—an expiration date 
approaching that means that I would have to 
go back to the way things were. Now I under-
stand why we are called Dreamers—it is be-
cause before DACA all we could do was 
dream of the life we wanted to have—a 
dream about being ‘‘someone.’’ 
While working as a medical assist-
ant, Mariana is studying to become a 
nurse. She is now a junior at Rutgers 
University Nursing School. Here is 
what she said about that experience: 
To be a nurse is a way of living. I do not 
look at it as a job, it is beyond that for me— 
it’s a calling. Advocating for and giving peo-
ple a voice is a reward within itself. Helping 
people in their time of need where they are 
most vulnerable is a privilege. 
Mariana 
is 
currently 
on 
the 
frontlines of fighting the COVID–19 
pandemic. She is a registered medical 
assistant at the Jefferson Cherry Hill 
Hospital COVID–19 testing center. She 
faces exposure to that virus every day 
that she goes to work. She takes every 
shift that she is offered. She said: 
I have to be there. I want to be there. I am 
not scared, but I am scared at the same time. 
I know what the risks are. 
I want to thank Mariana Galati for 
her service. She is an immigrant health 
hero. She is putting herself and her 
family at risk to save American lives. 
She shouldn’t have to worry about 
whether she is going to be deported 
next week. 
We can do better for Mariana and for 
thousands of other DACA recipients 
just like her. They are counting on 
those of us who serve in the Senate to 
solve this crisis that President Trump 
created. 
I cannot imagine, as I tell the 122nd 
story of a Dreamer on the floor of the 
Senate, that anyone listening believes 
we would be a better country if Mar-
iana were deported. That is the option 
that the President has created. He has

failed and refused to consider any solu-
tion or any effort to rescue people like 
Mariana and to give them a chance to 
be part of America’s future. 
When we look at those in essential 
services, medical and social services, it 
turns out that one in six of them are 
immigrants to this country. I know it 
is not a popular thing to say to this ad-
ministration, but I have to remind him 
that we are a nation of immigrants. My 
mother was an immigrant to this coun-
try, and her son has been fortunate 
enough to be elected Senator and rep-
resent the great State of Illinois. That 
is my story. That is my family’s story, 
but it is also America’s story. 
We are in this together. People from 
across the world have come to this 
country to be part of its future. Mar-
iana is an example—a young woman 
who could have thrown up her hands 
and said: I am undocumented. I am not 
going to have any way of legally being 
part of America. My dreams are just 
going to be put on hold. 
But she didn’t. She was determined 
to make the best of her life. Then when 
President Obama created DACA, a door 
opened for her that she couldn’t have 
imagined. She had the opportunity to 
move from medical assistant to become 
a nurse. She is studying at Rutgers for 
that purpose. 
Really, Mr. President, do you think 
New Jersey or America would be better 
if Mariana is deported out of this coun-
try? 
As soon as next week, maybe even 
next Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court 
is about to rule on the future of DACA. 
The President of the United States can 
solve this problem if they decide that 
DACA is to be abolished. He can fix 
this himself. 
There is another person who has a 
critical role, too, and that is Senator 
MCCONNELL, the Republican leader in 
the Senate. He has the power to bring 
this issue to the floor of the Senate for 
a debate and a vote. 
The House of Representatives has al-
ready passed the Dream and Promise 
Act, which would solve the challenge 
that would be created if the Supreme 
Court abolishes the DACA Program. 
Are we overwhelmed with business in 
the U.S. Senate, as I peer at an empty 
Chamber with my wonderful speech 
being the only thing as an item of busi-
ness at this moment? We have time. We 
have more than enough time to deal 
with this issue. For 800,000 protected by 
DACA, it is literally a life-and-death 
issue. 
I would appeal to Senator MCCON-
NELL to use his power as the Repub-
lican leader to solve this problem, to 
address this issue, to say that, if you 
qualify for the DACA Program, you are 
going to be protected until the end of 
the year or, beyond that, given an op-
portunity to become citizens of the 
United States, a goal which I have been 
seeking for the 20 years that I have 
worked on the Dream Act. 
We know that we need the help of 
wonderful young people like Mariana 
Galati to make this a better nation. 
The question is whether the President 
ever will realize that or whether Sen-
ator MCCONNELL would make room in 
our schedule for us to debate this issue. 
Let’s get this right. Let’s make sure 
that we have sensible immigration 
policies in America. The notion of 
abolishing DACA and saying to Mar-
iana, ‘‘you will now be deported back 
to a country you cannot even remem-
ber,’’ is not the answer. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
SASSE). The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
H.R. 1957 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the Sen-
ate has taken up and will be voting 
soon—I hope successfully—on water-
shed environmental legislation that 
will provide for municipal, county, 
State, and national parks and public 
spaces in America for generations to 
come. 
This is legislation I have been work-
ing on for years—legislation that I 
pushed hard to advance as chairman of 
the Senate Energy and Natural Re-
sources Committee and legislation for 
which I am now a cosponsor. 
The bill is going to repair public 
spaces, making them usable by all, 
while creating new public spaces that 
reflect the continuing story that is our 
great country. 
In my view, when the Senate debates 
this kind of legislation, the debate also 
has to include a discussion about a par-
ticularly important topic, and that is 
jobs. 
A major component of this bill is, of 
course, the Land and Water Conserva-
tion Fund, which puts funding into 
natural wonders all over the country, 
in cities and in rural areas. Today, I 
want to speak for a moment specifi-
cally about those rural areas and rural 
economies. 
The economic impact of the COVID– 
19 pandemic has hit so many of our 
rural communities like a wrecking 
ball. These are communities that have 
been struggling going back a long time, 
and building back up after COVID–19 is 
going to be enormously challenging. So 
the Senate ought to be looking at 
every good idea that can help get these 
rural economies moving again. 
The Land and Water Conservation 
Fund isn’t just about opening up the 
country’s treasured areas for everyone 
to enjoy and to help people get out-
doors. It has a proven track record of 
boosting the economy in communities 
near those lands. The Land and Water 
Conservation Fund is the ultimate win- 
win approach because with this pro-
gram you focus on recreation that in-
volves protecting our natural wonders 
and jobs. That is a big step forward. So 
what I wanted to do was just spend a 
few minutes talking about how we 
could do even more. 
For some time now, I have been 
working with my colleagues from the 
Pacific 
Northwest—Senator 
CRAPO, 
Senator MERKLEY, and Senator RISCH— 
trying to help secure two economic 
lifelines for the rural communities of 
the Northwest and for much of our Na-
tion. I am talking about Secure Rural 
Schools and Payments in Lieu of Taxes 
Programs. They are known as SRS and 
PILT. 
In the West, there are a lot of areas 
that have long depended on resource 
extraction and a lot of areas made up 
of Federal lands. So we went through a 
lot of boom-and-bust cycles that de-
fined those economies for generations, 
and nearly always those boom-and-bust 
cycles 
proved 
to 
be 
harmful 
and 
unsustainable. So some time ago—a 
number of years ago—former Senator 
Larry Craig and I wrote the bill that 
created the Secure Rural Schools Pro-
gram. It provided years and years of re-
liable revenue for rural counties so 
they could plan budgets and provide 
services for people who live in their 
borders. 
But after a while, Secure Rural 
Schools got caught up in the knock-
down, 
back-and-forth 
fiscal 
battles 
that happen in Congress too often. So 
once in a while, the program would 
lapse. It then meant that from all over 
the country, county leaders from rural 
communities came to Washington and 
had to plead for extensions of the Se-
cure Rural Schools Program that has 
always been successful and a model. 
It involves local input. Extending 
this program should have been a no- 
brainer all along. It expired just last 
year before Congress stepped up at the 
last minute to reauthorize the pro-
gram, but these start-and-stop author-
izations do nothing for certainty. 
I remember one year that to keep the 
Secure Rural Schools Program up, the 
distinguished Senator from Alaska, Ms. 
MURKOWSKI, and I were involved in sell-
ing off the helium reserves. That gave 
us some money—some key money—for 
the Secure Rural Schools Program in 
the West. I remember when we sold off 
the helium reserves to get money for 
Secure Rural Schools, a number of edi-
torial writers out West had a lot of fun 
with it and basically said: Well, we al-
ways knew RON WYDEN was full of a lot 
of hot air. 
The point is, we have got to end that 
cycle, that boom-and-bust cycle, in-
stead of going through these routines 
at the end of the period, when Secure 
Rural Schools was helping the roads 
and schools. 
I worked with Senator CRAPO to pro-
pose reforms that would upgrade the 
Secure Rural Schools Program into a 
stable, predictable source of funding 
for rural counties. Our bill would es-
tablish a permanent endowment fund, 
like funding for county economic de-
velopment and roads and schools. That 
is where the money goes. It goes into

economic development. It goes into 
roads and schools. 
By the way, when you are helping 
those rural communities with their 
budget, when they have those funds se-
cure, it frees up money for them for 
important things like mental health. 
We have certainly seen a demand for 
mental health increase dramatically in 
the last few months. 
After Congress makes an initial in-
vestment into the fund under our pro-
posal, which would establish a perma-
nent endowment to provide funding for 
county 
economic 
development 
into 
roads and schools—Congress makes 
that initial investment into the fund— 
the principle will be invested, and the 
interest will be used to make SRS pay-
ments to counties. So you have Sen-
ator CRAPO, Senator MERKLEY, Senator 
RISCH, and I proposing a way to move 
away from this roller coaster in the 
West to upgrade Secure Rural Schools 
into a stable, predictable source of 
funding. You have a permanent endow-
ment fund that provides money for the 
roads and the schools and the counties, 
and the principles are invested, and the 
interest will be used to make SRS pay-
ments to counties. 
The proposal is backed by 100 percent 
of Oregon’s U.S. Senators and 100 per-
cent of Idaho’s U.S. Senators—four 
U.S. Senators, two Democrats and two 
Republicans, having worked closely 
with rural groups, the National Asso-
ciations of Counties, and others to ad-
vance this idea. 
Our proposal also directs revenue- 
sharing payments from forest manage-
ment to be deposited into the endow-
ment each year. That way, the pay-
ments to the counties will grow, and 
the safety net they provide for their 
constituents can expand. 
In my view, these are the basics of an 
economic toolkit for rural areas. If you 
focus on roads, if you focus on schools, 
if you make sure that counties have 
the money for services so they can, for 
example, take care of mental health 
needs, that is the key to building up 
rural economies and helping to create 
good-paying jobs for residents. 
Now, payments in lieu of taxes is a 
program that exists for similar rea-
sons. People who live in these rural 
counties dominated by public lands 
also deserve support. They, too, rely on 
local governmental services and de-
serve a safety net like everyone else. 
They ought to be able to budget and 
plan and create jobs like bigger cities 
can. Our amendment to really promote 
Secure Rural Schools and PILT would 
extend PILT for 10 years to give these 
counties 
the 
certainty 
and 
predictablity they need. 
I am going to wrap up here in a mo-
ment, but I just hope that the majority 
leader is going to set up a process for 
real debate on these ideas and these 
amendments. 
This is a bipartisan proposal. When 
we have offered in the past—Senator 
CRAPO, 
Senator 
MERKLEY, 
Senator 
RISCH, and I and others—to extend this 
program, we nearly always get at least 
70 votes here in the U.S. Senate be-
cause there is an awareness of how im-
portant it is that these rural commu-
nities have certainty for schools and 
roads and basic kinds of services that 
our efforts support. 
The COVID–19 pandemic is causing 
enormous pain everywhere, but we 
have seen big corporations—we talked 
about this yesterday in the Finance 
Committee. Some colleagues think: 
Well, we ought to cut the unemploy-
ment benefits in half, but it is fine to 
make available trillions of dollars to 
the biggest corporations in America. 
So the COVID pandemic is causing 
pain everywhere, but it seems to me, 
with so many resources going to big 
corporations and powerful interests in 
intensely populated areas, the U.S. 
Senate has an obligation to make sure 
rural economies and rural workers and 
rural businesses aren’t just left behind. 
Upgrading Secure Rural Schools and 
extending PILT is a targeted way to 
advocate for rural communities. 
We are going to be home for several 
weeks in July, and my hope is to be 
able to have conversations with folks 
in person in those areas. I haven’t been 
able to do as much of that. I have had 
970 townhall meetings in person, just 
there to be able to respond and answer 
questions. So I really hope that we are 
going to be able to do that again soon. 
When we have those discussions, you 
can be very sure that, in those rural 
communities, front and center will be 
Secure Rural Schools, and front and 
center will be Payments in Lieu of 
Taxes. Folks will zero in on those areas 
because they will say, as they have to 
me since Larry Craig, our former col-
league from Idaho, and I wrote this 
program: 
Ron, 
what 
Secure 
Rural 
Schools is doing is giving us a chance 
to make sure we have a real education 
program. 
Before we got that program going, 
people thought they would have school 
3 days a week. So people will say: Ron, 
we need Secure Rural Schools. We need 
it for education. It is a key to our 
roads program. 
The roads program for these smaller 
counties is an absolute key to being 
able to have rural life. Without those 
rural roads and without rural schools, 
the heart of Secure Rural Schools, you 
can’t have rural life. So these two pro-
grams are a solution based on pro-
viding certainty and predictability to 
help build thriving economies and good 
jobs in rural areas. 
I am going to keep pushing for sup-
port here in the Senate. I know my col-
leagues 
Senator 
CRAPO, 
Senator 
MERKLEY, and Senator RISCH are going 
to continue to do so as well. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent to speak for up 
to 20 minutes as in morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, 
this week we consider a measure for 
permanent funding of the Land and 
Water Conservation Fund and for our 
national parks. 
I would support this measure joy-
ously if there were a similar program 
for America’s coasts and bays and 
oceans. As it is, I support this measure 
but with a heavy and frustrated heart 
as, once again, the urgent needs of 
coastal communities go unaddressed. 
Put bluntly, the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund massively favors inland 
and upland States and projects, as indi-
cated by the prevalence of advocates 
for it here on the floor from landlocked 
States. It fails to meet the needs of 
coastal communities. 
Over the past decade, for every dollar 
the fund sent to inland States, per cap-
ita, coastal States just got 40 cents. 
The imbalance against coasts gets 
worse if you factor in that there is 
greater coastal than inland economic 
activity, and the imbalance against 
coasts worsens further when you factor 
in that much of the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund’s spending in coast-
al States is for upland, inland projects. 
Coasts and saltwater are not treated 
fairly. The upland freshwater imbal-
ance is not justified, and we ought to 
make it right. 
Look at Rhode Island. People from 
around the Nation and around the 
globe visit our wonderful beaches and 
beautiful Narragansett Bay, and they 
drive a huge amount of our economic 
activity. In 2018, Rhode Island’s Com-
merce Corporation reckons 25 million 
people visited our State, supporting 
$100 million in State and local tax rev-
enue and over 86,000 jobs. In total, trav-
elers to Rhode Island generated $6.8 bil-
lion in our economy. Our coast attracts 
that economic activity. It is a big deal 
for us. 
Rhode Island isn’t alone. Over half of 
Americans live in a coastal county. 
Nearly 60 percent of the Nation’s gross 
domestic product derives from coastal 
counties. According to the American 
Shore and Beach Preservation Associa-
tion, ‘‘more than twice as many people 
visited America’s coasts as visit State 
and national parks combined; con-
sequently 85 percent of all tourism re-
lated revenue in the U.S. is generated 
in coastal States where beaches are the 
leading attraction. Beach tourism sup-
ports 2.5 million jobs, $285 billion in di-
rect revenue and . . . $45 billion in 
taxes annually.’’ 
For all that, the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund gives 40 cents to 
coastal States for every dollar that it 
sends to inland States. That 40 cents is 
per capita, not adjusted for the great 
coastal economic activity and greater

coastal tax revenue, and it doesn’t ad-
just for upland uses in coastal States. 
Coasts are overlooked. 
I wish it were just the Land and 
Water Conservation Fund. Look at the 
inland-to-coastal disparity in the Army 
Corps’ Flood and Coastal Storm Dam-
age Reduction Fund. Over the past 10 
years, the Corps has spent out of that 
fund, in various years, between 19 and 
120 times more on inland work than it 
has spent on coastal work. Let me re-
peat that: $19 to 1 coastal dollar was 
our coast’s best year and 120 inland 
dollars to 1 coastal dollar was our 
worst. 
Coastal communities are exposed to 
storms, to sea level rise, to shifting 
fisheries, to all manner of other con-
servation 
and 
infrastructure 
chal-
lenges, but across the decade, they re-
ceived less than 3 pennies out of each 
dollar spent from an Army Corps pro-
gram that has ‘‘coastal’’ in its name. 
This persistent and unfair imbalance 
against coasts ignores the massive and 
unique risks that coastal communities, 
coastal features, coastal infrastruc-
ture, and coastal economies now face. 
Look at the dire warnings of coastal 
property value crash. Freddie Mac, 
which is not an environmental group, 
has estimated that somewhere between 
$238 and $507 billion worth of coastal 
real estate will be gone, below sea 
level, by 2100. Freddie Mac warns about 
that: ‘‘The economic losses and social 
disruption [of that] . . . are likely to be 
greater in coastal than those experi-
enced in the housing crisis and Great 
Recession.’’ 
Are we listening? 
Along the east coast, the First Street 
Foundation estimates property values 
already took a $15 billion hit due to sea 
level rise. The Providence Journal, 
using First Street and Columbia Uni-
versity data, reported that Rhode Is-
land lost over $44 million in relative 
coastal property value from 2005 to 
2017. First Street data show that 
Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, 
and Rhode Island lost a combined $403 
million during that stretch. Hundreds 
of millions of dollars are gone already, 
and the worst is yet to come. 
Look elsewhere along the coast. Do 
you want to know why Senator CAS-
SIDY is so motivated? His entire Lou-
isiana coast is in a declared state of 
emergency. A recent headline from the 
Times Picayune said: ‘‘ ‘We’re screwed’: 
The only question is how quickly Lou-
isiana wetlands will vanish, study 
says.’’ 
That Tulane University study says 
sea level rise will flood 5,800 square 
miles of Louisiana coastal wetlands. 
The report concludes: ‘‘This is a major 
threat not only to one of the eco-
logically richest environments of the 
United States but also for the 1.2 mil-
lion inhabitants and associated eco-
nomic assets that are surrounded by 
Mississippi Delta marshland.’’ 
That is obvious, but are we listening 
to Senator CASSIDY? 
In Florida, coastal communities al-
ready see flooded streets on sunny 
days. Researchers project over 21⁄2 feet 
of sea level rise in the next 40 years af-
fecting 120,000 Florida coastal prop-
erties in or near rising seas. Some 
studies say Miami Beach’s iconic South 
Beach has 2 decades left. Communities 
in southern Florida are considering 
abandoning public infrastructure to 
the sea because of the sticker shock of 
protecting it. 
Fish, manatees, dolphins, sea turtles, 
and other sea creatures have washed up 
dead on Florida beaches due to toxic 
algae as the oceans there warm. The 
iconic Everglades are imperiled. 
Who is listening? 
In North Carolina, the Outer Banks 
face erosion and sea level rise such 
that the National Parks Service warns 
that swathes of the area will be inun-
dated. As the Outer Banks wash into 
the sea, there go millions of annual 
visitors, thousands of local jobs, and a 
local economy worth over $250 million. 
Over 5,500 homes in coastal Texas are 
projected to flood in the next decade. 
These homes are worth $1.2 billion. 
Coastal South Carolina, just since 
2017, has been hit by four different bil-
lion-dollar hurricanes. 
The list of what our coasts are facing 
goes on and on, and the projected 
losses are enormous. Here is Moody’s 
Investor Service’s warning for coastal 
communities issuing bonds: 
The growing effects of climate change, in-
cluding climbing global temperatures, and 
rising sea levels, are forecast to have an in-
creasing economic impact on U.S. State and 
local issuers. This will be a growing negative 
credit factor for issuers without sufficient 
adaptation and mitigation strategies. 
I would like to ask my colleagues, if 
you are a small community on the 
coast, where are you going to go to get 
sufficient adaptation and mitigation 
strategies for Moody’s? Where are we 
in helping those communities? 
Here is the Union of Concerned Sci-
entists: ‘‘By the end of the 21st cen-
tury, nearly 2.5 million residential and 
commercial 
properties, 
collectively 
valued today at $1.07 trillion today, 
will be at risk of chronic flooding.’’ 
Chronic flooding makes those prop-
erties 
uninsurable 
and 
unmortgageable, which is one of the 
reasons for Freddie Mac’s warning 
about a coastal property value crash. 
The Land and Water Conservation 
Fund is not listening. 
Our coastal public lands and re-
sources, like coastal private property, 
face enormous peril, and the Land and 
Water Conservation Fund virtually ig-
nores that peril. That is why I am of-
fering 
a 
commonsense, 
bipartisan 
amendment—not a spoiler amendment, 
not a partisan amendment, not a 
‘‘gotcha’’ amendment, not a poison 
pill. It is a commonsense, bipartisan 
amendment. 
My 
amendment 
takes 
nothing away from the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund. It leaves the Land 
and Water Conservation Fund and its 
upland bias intact. It separately pro-
vides coastal revenues dedicated from 
offshore wind and renewable energy de-
velopment to support coastal States, 
coastal resiliency, coastal infrastruc-
ture, and coastal adaptation. 
Unless we do this, millions of dollars 
in offshore wind energy revenues will 
bypass coasts and go straight to the 
Federal Treasury, unlike offshore oil 
and gas energy revenues, which go in 
significant part both to Gulf Coast 
States and, ironically, to the predomi-
nantly upland and inland projects of 
the Land and Water Conservation 
Fund. 
Don’t get me wrong. I don’t begrudge 
our landlocked colleagues their fund-
ing. I do begrudge them refusing me 
the opportunity to add something for 
coasts. There should be a coastal and 
saltwater program to balance the up-
land and freshwater bias of the Land 
and Water Conservation Fund. 
Our landlocked colleagues are wrong 
to stop this amendment. It does them 
no harm. The situation along our 
coasts is dangerous and worsening. Let 
me repeat that. The situation along 
our coasts is dangerous and worsening. 
I am going to vote for this bill, but I 
will do so, as I said, with a heavy and 
frustrated heart. 
I will continue pushing as hard as I 
can for the day when we get parity for 
coastal communities because what we 
are doing here by refusing this amend-
ment is both shortsighted and unfair. 
This is not my first rodeo on this 
subject. I have to tell you that I am 
sick to death of people telling me: You 
are right; we need to do something for 
coasts. And then, as soon as the Land 
and Water Conservation Fund passes, 
they are gone—‘‘zippo,’’ vanished. 
My environmental friends say: You 
are right, SHELDON. Just help us on 
this, and we will help you with coasts. 
And then you don’t. 
My colleagues say: You are right, 
SHELDON. Just help us on this, and we 
will help you with coasts. 
And then you don’t. 
And now, by making the Land and 
Water Conservation Fund permanent, 
we are permanently baking in its in-
land and its upland bias, and there is 
nothing added for coasts, and everyone 
is saying: Yes, you are right, SHELDON, 
but just help us on this, and we will 
help you with coasts. 
Well, my friends, bitter experience 
tells me otherwise. But you will have 
my vote, and you will have my help to 
protect your inland and fresh water re-
sources, as we should, and we from 
coasts and saltwater States will, again, 
have to await our day. Today is not our 
day in coastal States. Today is not our 
day, but maybe one day—and one day 
soon, I pray—all this talk will finally 
turn into action for our coasts. A sense 
of decency and a sense of urgency 
would both seem to demand that. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2848 
June 10, 2020 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, the 
Senate is considering landmark legisla-
tion. I call it that because it is indeed 
landmark legislation, but also it is 
about the great landmarks of our Na-
tion. 
We have a chance to lead this coun-
try this week with a historic package 
of bills. The Great American Outdoors 
Act combines the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund—our crown jewel of 
conservation programs—with the Re-
store Our Parks Act, legislation which 
would help to make a dent—help to 
catch up on our deferred maintenance 
backlog throughout our National Park 
System. It is more than just our na-
tional parks, though; it addresses the 
needs of our National Forest System, 
our Bureau of Land Management lands, 
Fish and Wildlife Service, as well as 
the Bureau of Indian Education. 
This legislation affects all four cor-
ners of Colorado, but it also affects 
every part of this country. In fact, this 
chart shows a map of the States that 
get support from the Great American 
Outdoors Act, shown in green. The 
States that don’t get support from the 
Great American Outdoors Act are high-
lighted in orange. It may be hard to see 
because there are no orange-high-
lighted States. Every State in the 
Union receives support through the 
Great American Outdoors Act, from 
sea to shining sea. 
The Land and Water Conservation 
Fund, the Restore Our Parks Act, and 
the Great American Outdoors Act will 
provide billions of dollars in opportuni-
ties for recreation, hiking, fishing, 
camping, conservation, and access to 
lands that the public already held but 
didn’t have access to until the Land 
and Water Conservation Fund. Ninety- 
nine percent of the land and water con-
servation funds go to lands the Amer-
ican people already hold, inholdings 
within a national park. In fact, one of 
the most recent purchases the Land 
and Water Conservation Fund per-
formed in Colorado was in Rocky 
Mountain National Park, acquiring one 
of the land holdings within the na-
tional park, helping to complete the 
great Rocky Mountain National Park, 
the third most visited national park in 
the country. 
This legislation gives this Congress a 
chance to lead on a bill that affects ev-
eryone, from Maine to California, from 
Texas to Alaska, from Maine to Ha-
waii, Hawaii to Utah, Utah to Alaska, 
and beyond. 
I know there are some who believe 
this is a Federal land grab. That sim-
ply is not true. As I mentioned, 99 per-
cent of the dollars in the Land and 
Water Conservation Fund go to pur-
chasing inholdings. 
There are some who believe this is 
mandatory spending. Remember how 
this bill was passed. In 1965, the Land 
and Water Conservation Fund was au-
thorized at $900 million a year. It was 
authorized to take certain dollars over 
time, and it became $900 million, but it 
only reached that level twice in the 
history of the program. 
Throughout 
the 
past 
55 
years, 
though, dollars had been diverted away 
from the Land and Water Conservation 
Fund. 
What 
this 
legislation 
does 
through its permanent funding is make 
sure the dollars we authorized begin-
ning in 1965 and reaffirmed by this Con-
gress in the permanent authorization 
in the John Dingell Conservation, Man-
agement, and Recreation Act by a vote 
of 92 to 8—to make sure those funds 
would not get diverted and to stop 
funds from being syphoned off and in-
stead go to what they were intended to 
go to in the Land and Water Conversa-
tion Fund beginning in 1965. We have 
an opportunity to stop that diversion. 
This is not new. This is paid for—not 
by the taxpayers but by oil and gas 
revenues. These dollars are generated 
from the revenues that come from off-
shore. Those energy revenues—the boat 
excise tax, the boat fuel excise tax, and 
a couple of other allocations—it is not 
coming from the taxpayers. 
It is an opportunity to protect our 
land, our most precious spaces, to 
catch up on our deferred maintenance 
of national parks, and to make sure we 
are doing that across the country with-
out costing the taxpayers money. 
This land is purchased. There is no 
Federal land grab. There is no eminent 
domain. They don’t use eminent do-
main for this. There is no premium 
that the Federal Government gets to 
buy land to crowd out other people. 
There is a formula that is used that 
doesn’t allow for premiums. So this, in-
deed, is another stick in the bundle of 
property rights for landowners. 
We also know the positive impact 
this bill has right now on our economy. 
You know, when we started working on 
this legislation, we were talking about 
its economic impact and what it would 
mean, but we were talking about it in 
terms of the overall outdoor recreation 
economy, which in Colorado is $28 bil-
lion and growing. There are 5.2 million 
Americans employed in the recreation 
economy. 
When COVID hit, we saw what hap-
pened in western Colorado as ski slopes 
shut down 2 months early and as hotels 
and restaurants emptied. This bill will 
create over 100,000 jobs, restoring our 
national parks, repairing trails and for-
est systems. It does so at a time when 
we have high unemployment rates in 
those communities surrounded by pub-
lic lands because of the shutdown as a 
result of the coronavirus. 
This is an economic and jobs package 
as much as it is a conservation pack-
age. For every $1 million we spend in 
the Land and Water Conservation 
Fund, it supports between 16 and 30 
jobs. It is our chance to not only pro-
tect our environment, to catch up on 
deferred maintenance, but also to grow 
our economy when our economy needs 
the growth. 
After 
spending 
the 
last 
several 
months in the great indoors, it is time 
to get out to the great outdoors, and 
this bill accomplishes both of those 
goals. 
It is historic in another way. We re-
ceived support from over 850 groups 
across the country representing signifi-
cant 
spectrums 
of 
purposes 
and 
ideologies, from sportsmen, to The Na-
ture Conservancy, to all the groups 
who touted this effort. This is a list of 
over 850 groups strongly supporting 
this legislation. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that this letter from these 850-plus 
organizations 
be 
printed 
in 
the 
RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[May 11, 2020] 
SUPPORT FOR THE GREAT AMERICAN OUTDOORS 
ACT 
DEAR
MAJORITY
LEADER
MCCONNELL, 
SPEAKER PELOSI, MINORITY LEADER SCHUMER, 
AND MINORITY LEADER MCCARTHY: Our orga-
nizations, and the members we represent, 
strongly support passage and subsequent en-
actment of the Great American Outdoors Act 
(S. 3422) as quickly as possible. This bill is 
necessary to support the public lands we all 
rely upon by achieving the twin goals of pro-
tecting America’s special places and repair-
ing deteriorating infrastructure. We urge 
you to vote in favor of this crucial legisla-
tion and to oppose any amendments to it. 
The bill will help address priority repairs 
in our national parks and on other public 
lands by directing up to $9.5 billion over five 
years to address maintenance needs within 
the National Park System, other public land 
agencies, and Bureau of Indian Education 
schools. It will also fully and, permanently 
dedicate $900 million per year already being 
deposited into the Land and Water Conserva-
tion Fund, our nation’s most important con-
servation program, to ensure protection of 
and access to irreplaceable lands and local 
recreation opportunities. 
This legislation was introduced on March 9 
and has the strong bipartisan support of a 
majority of the Senate. It is consistent with 
legislation supported by a surpassing bipar-
tisan majority in the House, and the Presi-
dent has specifically requested this bill for 
his signature, creating an unprecedented op-
portunity for a historic win for the American 
public and the places they care about. 
The Great American Outdoors Act will en-
sure a future for nature to thrive, kids to 
play, and hunters and anglers to enjoy. Na-
tional parks and public lands provide access 
to the outdoors for hundreds of millions of 
people every year and habitat for some of 
our country’s most iconic wildlife. These 
treasured places also tell the stories that de-
fine and unite us as a nation. Funds provided 
in this bill will secure these vital resources 
while preserving water quantity and quality, 
sustaining working landscapes and rural 
economies, increasing access for recreation 
for all Americans no matter where they live, 
and fueling the juggernaut of our outdoor 
economy. 
In 2018, over 318 million national park vis-
its led to $20.2 billion in direct spending at 
hotels, restaurants, outfitters, and other 
amenities in gateway communities, sup-
porting over 329,000 jobs and generating over 
$40.1 billion in total economic output. Na-
tionally, outdoor recreation contributes $778 
billion in consumer spending and supports 5.2 
million jobs. 
The Great American Outdoors Act will en-
sure that our parks and other public lands 
continue to preserve our nation’s heritage 
and recreation opportunities, and that local 
communities and economies in these areas 
will continue to flourish.

Mr. GARDNER. There is another his-
toric feature I am particularly grateful 
for, and that is, the previous Secre-
taries of the Interior have signed a let-
ter to Congress urging the passage of 
the Great American Outdoors Act. This 
letter includes two Secretaries of Inte-
rior from Colorado—Senator Ken Sala-
zar, who was Secretary of the Interior 
under Barack Obama from 2009 to 2017, 
and Secretary Gale Norton, who was 
the Interior Secretary under President 
George W. Bush from 2001 to 2006. This 
letter was sent to us on June 3, 2020. It 
is a historic letter with six previous 
Secretaries of the Interior signing on 
to it, including Secretaries Zinke, 
Jewell, Kempthorne, Norton, and Bab-
bitt. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that this letter from the Secre-
taries of the Interior be printed in the 
RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
JUNE 3, 2020. 
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI, MINORITY LEADER 
MCCARTHY, MAJORITY
LEADER
MCCONNELL 
AND MINORITY LEADER SCHUMER: During our 
time as Secretaries of the Interior, we had 
the 
privilege 
and 
responsibility 
of 
stewarding some of America’s most incred-
ible landscapes and natural and cultural 
treasures. Now, more than ever, we are all 
cognizant of the critical role of public lands 
in our lives, as places to recreate, to re-
charge and to seek solace in the midst of 
great uncertainty—and, also, to create jobs. 
Together, we write to strongly urge swift 
passage and enactment of the Great Amer-
ican Outdoors Act (S. 3422) without any 
amendments. This bill (and its expected 
House companion) is critically needed to 
support the public lands upon which all 
Americans rely. The Great American Out-
doors Act will advance the protection of 
America’s special places and invest in the re-
pair and restoration of deteriorating infra-
structure. The bill will help address priority 
repairs in our National Parks and on other 
public lands by directing up to $9.5 billion 
over five years to address maintenance needs 
within the National Park System, other pub-
lic land agencies, and Bureau of Indian Edu-
cation schools. It will also fully and perma-
nently fund the Land and Water Conserva-
tion Fund, our nation’s most important con-
servation program, as authorized at $900 mil-
lion every year to ensure protection of and 
access to our public lands. 
The Great American Outdoors Act will 
help ensure a better, brighter future for na-
ture and for all of us. As Secretaries, we 
have all experienced how public lands man-
aged by the Department provide vital func-
tions like wildlife habit while preserving 
water quantity and quality, sustaining work-
ing landscapes and rural economies, increas-
ing access for recreation opportunities, and 
stimulating the outdoor economy. Nation-
ally, outdoor recreation contributes roughly 
$778 billion in consumer spending and sup-
ports 5.2 million jobs. The Great American 
Outdoors Act will ensure that our parks and 
other public lands are maintained and en-
hanced so that they can continue to provide 
these critical benefits for generations to 
come. 
We are pleased to see strong bipartisan 
support from the House and Senate—and 
from the President—for the Great American 
Outdoors Act. Americans need these public 
lands. And Americans need your continued 
leadership to deliver this historic legislation 
into law. 
Sincerely, 
RYAN ZINKE, 
Secretary of the Inte-
rior 2017–2019. 
KEN SALAZAR, 
Secretary of the Inte-
rior 2009–2013. 
GALE NORTON, 
Secretary of the Inte-
rior 2001–2006. 
SALLY JEWELL, 
Secretary of the Inte-
rior 2013–2017. 
DIRK KEMPTHORNE, 
Secretary of the Inte-
rior 2006–2009. 
BRUCE BABBITT, 
Secretary of the Inte-
rior 1993–2001. 
Mr. GARDNER. We have a chance to 
lead. We have a chance to show the 
American people that Congress can 
work together. We have a chance to 
show the American people that indeed 
Republicans and Democrats can come 
together for the good of their country 
to provide great things for future gen-
erations. Despite the bickering seen on 
nightly talk shows, this Congress can 
come together and pass the Great 
American Outdoors Act, which can re-
store faith in our government to do 
what people hope we will do, and that 
is to come together and to work to-
gether and to inspire each other with 
those dreams of previous generations 
who protected our lands and had the 
idea and forethought to create national 
parks, to create national forests, to say 
that there are places in our great land

that can and should be enjoyed for gen-
erations to come. 
It is also about ballparks and swim-
ming pools because not all of these dol-
lars go to purchase land. In fact, here 
is a photo of a ballpark in Pueblo, CO. 
Runyon Park was funded through the 
Land and Water Conservation Fund. 
We have swimming pools across Utah 
and Alaska that were funded through it 
as well. States determine a great por-
tion of it. 
Listed here is Paradise Sports Park 
in Paradise, UT. It sounds like a great 
place. In 2015, $80,000 was used for that 
park in Paradise. 
In Alaska, the Kenai Peninsula, there 
is the Kenai soccer park in the city of 
Kenai, which received $321,000 from the 
Land and Water Conservation Fund. 
Let’s lead. Let’s inspire. Let’s show 
the American people that, indeed, from 
sea to shining sea, across America, the 
beautiful, the Great American Out-
doors Act can stand as a testament to 
a Congress that realizes generations 
ahead of us need for us to work for 
them as well. 
I will end this with a quote from the 
Father of Rocky Mountain National 
Park, 
who 
said: ‘‘Within National 
Parks is room—glorious room—room in 
which to find ourselves, in which to 
think and hope, to dream and plan, to 
rest and resolve.’’ 
I hope my colleagues will join me in 
supporting the motion to proceed, the 
rollcall vote we are about to take. I 
would encourage my colleagues to vote 
yes.

JUSTICE IN POLICING ACT 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise 
today in strong support of the Justice 
in Policing Act, introduced yesterday 
by my colleagues Senator HARRIS from 
California and Senator BOOKER from 
New Jersey. 
I am proud to be an original cospon-
sor of this legislation. This legislation 
is urgently needed after the death of 
George Floyd in police custody in Min-
nesota, which has sent shock waves 
through the Nation and the world. I am 
pleased that the protests have been 
largely peaceful, and that where the 
Senate sits in Washington, our local 
leaders have moved to deescalate ten-
sions. 
I was pleased on Monday to hold a 
Facebook Live session with Hillary 
Shelton, the director of the NAACP’s 
Washington bureau and senior vice 
president for advocacy and policy, as 
well as Marc Morial, the president and 
chief executive officer of the National 
Urban League and the former mayor of 
New Orleans. We talked about this leg-
islation in some detail. 
I received feedback from several of 
my constituents at my Facebook Live 
event on how to improve relations be-
tween police and the communities they 
serve and how to rebuild trust between 
them. 
Before they first put on a badge, a 
police officer takes an oath to uphold 
the law. Most do so with the best in-
tentions and carry out their duties 
with a willingness to help commu-
nities. But in far too many commu-
nities around the country, the system 
in which they work has been failing. 
People are dying at the hands of police, 
predominantly people of color. Ac-
countability has been tied to public 
videos rather than doing the right 
thing. Incremental reform is no longer 
an option when it comes to police re-
form. We have been patient, but we 
must do better to protect the civil 
rights, human rights, and lives of men, 
women, and children of this country. 
Congress must finally pass a com-
prehensive plan to improve training 
and community relations, hold police

accountable, and rebuild trust between 
law enforcement and the communities 
they serve. To that end, I have been 
proud to work with my colleagues Sen-
ator BOOKER and Senator HARRIS in 
creating a package of reforms and ac-
countability 
measures 
that 
shows 
where we need to be as a nation with a 
fair and just system of laws. 
The package focuses on three major 
pillars: accountability, data collection, 
and training policies. I was proud that 
two major pieces included in the Jus-
tice in Policing Act are from bills that 
I have introduced for many Congresses: 
the End Racial and Religious Profiling 
Act and the Law Enforcement Trust 
and Integrity Act. 
The 
End 
Racial 
and 
Religious 
Profiling Act is designed to enforce the 
constitutional right to equal protec-
tion under the law by eliminating 
racial- and religious-based discrimina-
tory profiling at all levels of law en-
forcement by changing the policies and 
procedures. It allows police to focus 
their work more accurately rather 
than wasting resources on blanket 
stereotypes. It requires enhanced data 
collection for DOJ to track and mon-
itor discriminatory profiling. It holds 
State and local enforcement agencies 
accountable by conditioning Federal 
funds on their adoption of policies and 
best practices to combat profiling by 
officers. 
The Law Enforcement Trust and In-
tegrity Act takes a comprehensive ap-
proach on how local police organiza-
tions 
can 
adopt 
performance-based 
standards to ensure that instances of 
misconduct will be minimized through 
training and oversight. The bill pro-
vides that, if such instances do occur, 
they be properly investigated. It re-
quires the creation of law enforcement 
accreditation 
standards 
and 
rec-
ommendations 
based 
on 
President 
Obama’s Task Force on 21st Century 
Policing. 
This bill also enhances funding for 
so-called pattern and practice discrimi-
nation cases. In Baltimore City, for ex-
ample, the police department volun-
tarily entered into a consent decree in 
2017 with the U.S. Department of Jus-
tice to overhaul the police department 
after the tragic death of Freddie Gray 
in police custody in 2015, which led to 
civil unrest in Baltimore. 
I might add, I am very pleased that 
we have seen progress in Baltimore, as 
evidenced by the types of protests after 
the Floyd tragedy. They have been al-
most all peaceful. 
In Baltimore, the Department of Jus-
tice report had found a widespread pat-
tern and practice of illegal and uncon-
stitutional conduct by the Baltimore 
Police Department through targeting 
African-American residents for dis-
proportionate and disparate treatment. 
The U.S. District Court for the District 
of Maryland is now overseeing a com-
plete overhaul of the Baltimore Police 
Department. 
We have made progress. 
Other important provisions of the 
Justice in Policing Act will save lives. 
The bill bans choke holds at the Fed-
eral level and conditions law enforce-
ment funding on State and local gov-
ernments banning choke holds. It bans 
no-knock warrants in drug cases at the 
Federal level and conditions law en-
forcement funding on State and local 
governments banning no-knock war-
rants. It requires that deadly force be 
used only as a last resort and requires 
officers to employ deescalation tech-
niques first. It requires better data col-
lection on how and under what cir-
cumstances police officers use force. 
We need these standards. We have seen 
too many tragedies on the misuse of 
power and force by law enforcement. 
The bill takes important steps to de-
militarize our police forces—we are a 
civilian society; we are not run as a 
military state—and encourage more 
professionalism, consistent with chang-
ing our police officers’ mentality from 
a 
warrior 
mindset 
to 
a 
guardian 
mindset. 
The legislation limits the transfer of 
military-grade equipment to State and 
local law enforcement. It requires Fed-
eral uniformed police officers to wear 
body cameras and requires State and 
local law enforcement to use existing 
Federal funds to ensure the use of po-
lice body cameras. 
This comprehensive legislation takes 
several important steps to hold police 
accountable in courts. It makes it con-
sistent with standard practice to pros-
ecute offending officers and enables in-
dividuals to recover damages in civil 
courts when law enforcement officers 
violate their constitutional rights by 
changing qualified immunity for law 
enforcement. 
Finally, the legislation gives better 
tools to the Department of Justice and 
State attorneys general to investigate 
and prosecute police misconduct. It re-
invests in our communities by sup-
porting critical community-based pro-
grams to change the culture of law en-
forcement and empower our commu-
nities to reimagine public safety in an 
equitable and just way. 
As I mentioned earlier, in Baltimore, 
after the Freddie Gray tragedy, we rec-
ognized that we needed to do a better 
job in working with communities and 
police, and we reached out. Part of our 
consent decree is to improve that rela-
tionship, that direct relationship be-
tween police and community. 
The legislation that I have men-
tioned on the floor here establishes 
public safety innovation grants for 
community-based organizations to cre-
ate local commissions and task forces 
to help communities to reimagine and 
develop concrete, just, and equitable 
public safety approaches. 
Let me share with you two stories. I 
do this because there are so many peo-
ple who have come forward and shared 
their experiences growing up and living 
in a society of discrimination. 
I remember very vividly, after the 
Freddie Gray episode in Baltimore, I 
met with a group of community leaders 
in Sandtown, where the tragedy oc-
curred, and listened to their accounts 
of how they grew up with the fear of 
police and the stories of how they were 
singled out or discriminated against by 
traffic stops and by other harassment 
just because of the color of their skin. 
So let me share with you two stories 
that were reported recently in the 
paper. One is the story of Michael Tur-
ner, his encounter years ago with the 
Montgomery County police. Turner 
was only 18 years of age when this en-
counter occurred. 
Officers had come to break up a party in 
the suburban county and quickly focused on 
Turner and his fellow African American 
friends. They checked IDs. No one was 
drunk. The cops asked them to move along. 
‘‘One officer looks at us,’’ Turner recounted, 
‘‘and says, ‘Now go back to your projects.’ ’’ 
The broader context of the email, written 
eight days ago, was Turner’s effort to ex-
plain why he wanted a protest in downtown 
Silver Spring. ‘‘We come in peace, com-
mander,’’ wrote Turner, 36. ‘‘March with us. 
It’s time for a change. I’m ready to help, are 
you?’’ 
The email set off six days of written and 
phone dialogue between Turner and Captain 
Darren Francke, who commands the Silver 
Spring police district for the Montgomery 
County department. It culminated Sunday 
afternoon when Turner, Francke and three 
other Montgomery County police officers 
took a knee in front of more than 200 pro-
testers facing them and stretching half a 
block down Georgia Avenue. 
Everyone sat still for 2 minutes 53 seconds, 
the estimated time George Floyd lay uncon-
scious with his neck pinned below the knee 
of a Minneapolis police officer. 
. . . . Turner’s protest in the sprawling 
suburb just miles north of the District had a 
different twist: It was a demonstration put 
together with the active help of the police. 
To Captain Francke, it all made sense. He 
had served in the Pennsylvania Army Na-
tional Guard and joined the Montgomery po-
lice in 1996. A father of three, including a 
daughter who also came to the protest, he 
previously 
commanded 
the 
department’s 
major crimes division—supervising murder 
investigations throughout the county. 
‘‘Thank you for sharing your story,’’ 
Francke wrote. ‘‘I don’t blame you for hav-
ing a chip on your shoulder. I am not proud 
of some things that a few officers did before 
and now. . . . I am saddened and angered by 
what happened to George Floyd, and a num-
ber of other events over many years that 
were clearly violations of the values that the 
vast majority of officers have. My officers 
and I will march with you. With your assist-
ance, we will also help to keep the event safe 
from those that would want to turn your 
message into something else. We want your 
message to be heard.’’ 
By 1 p.m. Sunday, more than 200 people 
had gathered at Veterans Plaza in downtown 
Silver Spring. They marched 3 blocks to the 
corner of Colesville Road and Georgia Ave-
nue, halted, and waited for Turner to lead 
everyone to one knee. He swayed back and 
forth, his head buried in a towel weeping as 
he thought of Floyd’s family. Francke stood 
next to him, clapping. Next a quick prayer. 
Then the kneel. The crowd erupted with ap-
plause at the 2 minute 53 seconds mark as 
the group marched back to Veterans Plaza. 
A series of speakers addressed the crowd. 
. . . About 3:30 p.m., Turner handed the 
microphone back to Francke. The com-
mander told the crowd about Turner’s en-
counter with the police 18 years earlier. And 
then the captain turned toward him. ‘‘I’m 
sorry,’’ he said.

That sorry, I think, underscores the 
importance that what happened in 
Minneapolis affects everybody in our 
country, not just the African-American 
community. 
Let me close with one additional 
story that was also reported and brings 
out a very familiar challenge for Afri-
can-American families. 
As the day drew to a close, DeShawn 
Rasberry, age 6, and his younger broth-
er, Davian, age 4, were already tired. 
They had been at Pennsylvania Avenue 
and 13th Street since noon with their 
mother, Janessa Smith, age 28, handing 
out water, Gatorade, and granola bars 
as people were passing. The brothers 
had never seen so many people before, 
and neither had Ms. Smith. It was the 
family’s first protest. 
‘‘Do you know why all these people 
are here?’’ the mother asked her 
younger son. He stared at the crowd, 
munching on his granola bar that had 
crumbled to pieces in his hands. The 
mother said, ‘‘They’re out here for 
you.’’ 
Davian was dressed in a Superman 
cap and a matching T-shirt and smiled 
and nodded. Ms. Smith had explained 
to her sons that they were here to 
‘‘protest,’’ which means standing up for 
something, she said, and to help others. 
She hadn’t told them that the protest 
was against police brutality, spurred 
by the killing of a man with their same 
skin color in police custody. 
‘‘They’re so young now, still so 
young,’’ Ms. Smith said. ‘‘And right 
now they’re in love with law enforce-
ment. . . . I don’t want to spoil that. 
Not yet.’’ 
She pointed out that neither of her 
children were afraid of police. Ms. 
Smith looked at her sons, both just 
barely coming up to her waist, gripping 
cold water bottles. One day she will 
have to give them ‘‘the talk’’ about po-
lice officers, she thought to herself, but 
not today. 
Let’s rise to the occasion so that 
Janessa Smith never has to give that 
heartbreaking talk to her boys in 
Prince George’s County, MD. I urge my 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle to 
focus on our common humanity and re-
spect for the rule of law. 
There are examples of best practices 
in community policing that should be a 
guide nationwide. Let us work together 
to guarantee equal justice under the 
law and fulfill the promise of our Con-
stitution in order to form a more per-
fect union, establish justice, and en-
sure domestic tranquility. 
Let this Nation finally guarantee 
‘‘Equal Justice Under Law,’’ which is 
carved in the marble of the entrance to 
the Supreme Court, which is just 
across the street from our Senate 
Chamber. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
LOEFFLER). The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM 
Mr. 
CORNYN. 
Madam 
President, 
since the death of George Floyd, the 
American people have once again been 
engaged in a passionate discussion 
about racial injustice, which has sadly 
existed throughout our Nation’s his-
tory. 
In many ways, the killing of George 
Floyd was the match in the powder 
barrel. It ignited long-overdue con-
versations about prejudice and dis-
crimination that still exists in homes, 
workplaces, and in particular, institu-
tions charged with keeping us safe. 
There is no question that what hap-
pened to George Floyd was a failure of 
the Minneapolis Police Department. He 
was killed by police officers as one ap-
plied pressure to his neck and three 
others stood by and did nothing. We 
are going to leave that to the criminal 
justice system to make sure that the 
appropriate people are held account-
able, but we are not off the hook. We 
have a responsibility, and we have ex-
perienced enough of these tragedies to 
know that it is not an isolated event. 
Black men and women and other mi-
norities across the country have died 
in custody for doing things that do not 
warrant the use of deadly force. In the 
case of Breonna Taylor, who was killed 
in March, she was asleep in her home 
when plainclothes officers with a no- 
knock warrant used a battering ram to 
enter her apartment shortly after mid-
night. She was asleep in her apart-
ment, and shortly after midnight—no 
knock—just a battering ram, and her 
door is knocked open. Thinking some-
body had broken into her home, which 
was a reasonable reaction, Breonna’s 
boyfriend, a licensed gun owner, fired 
at them. He thought they were under 
assault. The officers returned at least 
20 shots, killing the 26-year-old emer-
gency room technician. 
Unfortunately, as in too many of 
these cases, the officers who were re-
sponsible were never held responsible, 
and that needs to change. 
We are engaged in a discussion about 
how we can root out the injustices that 
exist in our criminal justice system. 
One terrible idea that has been floated 
is to defund or even disband the police. 
I can’t even believe we have to talk 
about it, but we do because it has been 
proposed by a majority of the Min-
neapolis City Council members. Over 
the weekend, nine of them said they 
will begin the process of ending the 
Minneapolis Police Department. Well, I 
am amazed that we have to say it, but 
apparently we must. This is an extraor-
dinarily reckless and dangerous path to 
go down. I was glad to see a number of 
our Democratic colleagues here in the 
Senate and over in the House reject 
such a crazy idea. I don’t know how 
you can call it anything else. 
While it is clear that bold action is 
required, 
disbanding 
institutions 
charged with keeping us safe would do 
more harm than good. You would think 
that would be self-evident. If you have 
a leak in your roof that suddenly 
causes your ceiling in your kitchen to 
crash down, the solution isn’t to elimi-
nate your roof. Sure, it would guar-
antee you are never going to have a 
leak again, but it is going to open you 
up to a whole new host of problems 
that would do far more damage. Our 
job here is to fix the leak and figure 
out how to move forward. The process 
in this case isn’t going to be quite so 
straightforward. 
Nationwide, we have some 18,000 Fed-
eral, State, county, and local law en-
forcement agencies. Some have 1 offi-
cer, while some have more than 30,000, 
so they are not all the same. The poli-
cies and procedures governing how the 
officers in each of these agencies inter-
act with their community vary widely 
from one department to the next. By 
and large, that makes sense. 
If you are in Mayberry with Andy 
Taylor, it may be a two-police-officer 
town. Obviously, you can handle things 
a little differently than you can in a 
major metropolitan city like New 
York, Dallas, or Houston. That is why 
I believe that a one-size-fits-all ap-
proach does not make sense. We simply 
don’t have the expertise, nor do we 
have the skill to try to write legisla-
tion that will treat 330 million people 
the same way. 
Yet there are policies and practices 
that we can promote as best practices, 
and that is actually where I think the 
Federal Government’s role is irreplace-
able. It is very important. We can do 
that and provide good guidance to the 
States and local authorities. 
One 
example 
is 
the 
chokehold. 
Chokeholds are already banned from a 
number of law enforcement agencies 
across the country but not all. In the 
past few weeks, State legislatures and 
city councils have taken action to ban 
this dangerous and controversial prac-
tice. I have no doubt more will follow 
suit. This is a great example of the 
type of action we can and should take 
in Washington to ensure America’s law 
enforcement officers are helping, not 
hurting, the very people they are sworn 
to protect. 
In the Republican caucus, Senator 
TIM SCOTT is leading the charge to de-
velop a package of bills that will make 
much needed and long-overdue reforms 
to our criminal justice system. We 
have done this before. We did it with 
the FIRST STEP Act, bringing State- 
proven remedies to prison reform and 
rehabilitation and safe reentry into so-
ciety to the national scale. So we have 
done this before. 
I have been in close discussions with 
Senator SCOTT and Leader MCCONNELL 
and a handful of other Senators who 
are interested in trying to come up 
with the most effective ways to create 
tangible change. This is not going to be 
a matter of political grandstanding; 
this is about practical problem-solving. 
It is certainly not going to be an effort 
just to serve as a political marker. I 
think there is actually enough common

ground where we can do something 
constructive on a bipartisan, bicameral 
basis and get a Presidential signature 
on it. 
One provision in the list of provisions 
that Senator SCOTT is putting together 
involves legislation that has already 
received broad bipartisan support. This 
provision, which I recommended, in-
cluded 
a 
bill 
that 
Senator 
GARY 
PETERS, a Democrat from Michigan, 
and Senator GRAHAM of South Caro-
lina, chairman of the Judiciary Com-
mittee, and I introduced and passed 
last year to create a National Criminal 
Justice Commission. 
I know sometimes people will say 
‘‘Well, creating another committee or 
another commission doesn’t solve the 
problem,’’ but this is not mutually ex-
clusive. I think this is to supplement 
the other things we do here in the near 
term to come up with a comprehensive 
view of what we need to do in our 
criminal justice system to make it 
more fair and to make sure our law en-
forcement officers receive the best 
training and understand the best prac-
tices when it comes to community po-
licing. 
This is based largely on the same 
model as the 9/11 Commission. You re-
call that after the 9/11 Commission— 
there were roughly 14 people appointed 
by the White House in both political 
parties here. They studied the vulnera-
bilities we had that led to the 9/11 ter-
rorist attacks and made concrete rec-
ommendations to Congress that we 
took up and passed. I think that is a 
sensible way for us to approach the 
problems with our criminal justice sys-
tem writ large. It could include things 
like policing reform. That is an obvious 
one given the concerns of the day, but 
it doesn’t have to be limited to just 
that. 
We haven’t done this sort of top-to- 
bottom review of our criminal justice 
system in America since 1965. This is 
the legislative version of finding the 
leak in your roof. This is the critical 
first step to figuring out the full range 
of problems that exist so we can begin 
the repair process. 
A similar version of this bill passed 
the Senate unanimously late in 2018. I 
hope it can be a part of the conversa-
tion we have in the coming days and 
weeks about how to respond. 
I know minorities across America are 
hurting right now, and there is a def-
icit of trust between many of their 
communities and the police depart-
ments. That is because too many fami-
lies had to bury their sons or daughters 
who were killed without justification. 
While we can’t turn time back, we can 
take action to prevent history from re-
peating itself. 
A couple of days ago, I had the honor 
of talking to George Floyd’s family as 
they were preparing for his funeral yes-
terday in Houston. I told them that at 
times like these, I know how inad-
equate words can be, but if there was 
some comfort that I could offer, it is 
that his death is not in vain, that 
something good will come out of this. I 
think that is true. 
This repair process isn’t going to be 
quick or easy. It is not something we 
can turn to next week and take off our 
plate and forget about it. This has been 
a long march since America was found-
ed when we committed the original sin 
of treating part of our population—our 
African-American 
population—as 
something less than fully human. We 
fought a civil war over slavery, and in 
the 1960s, we had pretty controversial 
and chaotic times, which led to legisla-
tive work that protected the vote of 
minorities and protected civil rights 
writ large. 
This is going to require a long-term, 
bipartisan commitment, not just from 
us in Washington but folks in the State 
capitals, city halls, and police depart-
ments across the country. 
Because ultimately it is the local of-
ficials who have the responsibility to 
hire and fire the police chief, to make 
sure that bad police officers are re-
moved from the force, and that is 
where 
the 
near-term 
responsibility 
needs to lie because we don’t have that 
capability here. 
But we do believe—I do believe there 
are concrete steps we can take right 
now to address the racial injustices 
that were exposed once again with the 
death of Mr. Floyd. I appreciate Sen-
ator SCOTT and Leader MCCONNELL for 
responding to this crisis with the ur-
gency that it deserves, and I am proud 
to be part of this effort in the Senate. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
PERDUE). The clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
H.R. 1957 
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, this week 
we are considering the bipartisan Great 
American Outdoors Act. I think it is 
fair to say that this is one of the most 
important packages of conservation 
legislation that we have seen in a long 
time. It might be fair to say that it is 
the most important piece of legislation 
since President Theodore Roosevelt 
dramatically made additions to the Na-
tional Park System just a little more 
than 100 years ago. 
The bill essentially combines two im-
portant provisions—the Restore Our 
Parks Act and the Land and Water 
Conservation full funding act. I am a 
cosponsor of both of those. We have 
been trying to do the things that those 
two bills both do for a long time, and 
here we are. 
During World War II—we are just 
within a few days of D-day—President 
Eisenhower—at that time General Ei-
senhower—had a view that sometimes 
if a problem is too big to solve or seems 
to be too hard to solve, you solve it by 
making it bigger. 
Interestingly, what we have done 
here with two things that we have been 
trying to do for a long time—to have 
full access to the reason the Land and 
Water Conservation Act was created 
and to do a better job maintaining our 
parks—that has all been combined into 
the Great American Outdoors Act. 
The first thing this act does is, 
frankly, make a significant investment 
for the deferred maintenance we have 
on all kinds of Federal land. It is one of 
our challenges as a government gen-
erally. It has been specifically one of 
our challenges as it relates to the Na-
tional Park System, to the Forest 
Service, to the Fish and Wildlife Serv-
ice, to the Bureau of Land Manage-
ment—every one of those has deferred 
maintenance issues that have been 
there for a long time. In fact, some of 
them have been there for decades. 
I mentioned earlier that the Park 
System as we now know it is a little 
more than 100 years old. Some of these 
maintenance issues are decades old, 
maybe 50 years old. Maybe half of the 
life of the entire Park Service we have 
had these issues on a list of something 
that needs to be done. 
In Yellowstone, the high bridge that 
thousands of cars go over every sum-
mer—that bridge needs to be repaired. 
The water maintenance systems in our 
parks where particularly they have 
overnight accommodations and other 
things—many of those systems are al-
most as old as the parks themselves. 
There are buildings we have in all 
those locations where the access is no 
longer appropriate and hasn’t been for 
a long time. Sometimes that meant 
you just closed the visitor center. You 
closed that part of the park that people 
previously had a way to get into and 
see a display, look at an exhibit, but 
because of disability issues that should 
have been fixed long ago, they haven’t 
been able to. 
We have been saying—I have been 
saying certainly for several years now 
that the second century of the Park 
System needs to be different from the 
first century of the Park System. 
We need more private-public rela-
tionships. We saw a great example of 
that at the renewal of the arch and the 
museum and the area in St. Louis that 
just had a significant effort made, al-
most all by either local or private 
funds—very few Federal dollars there. 
But if you are going to have a private- 
public partnership, the public needs to 
do its part, and we are talking today 
about how the public would do its part 
in maintaining the parks, expanding 
the parks, building a new facility, re-
pairing a facility, changing access to a 
facility. 
But a lot of this deferred mainte-
nance will not be all that obvious. It is 
just something that has to be done. 
And because it is not all that obvious— 
the bridge hasn’t collapsed yet, and the 
water system still appears to be pro-
ducing water that people can use, so 
let’s worry about that at some future 
time. Well, the future time is here.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2857 
June 10, 2020 
This act will work to help improve 
the visitor experience at the park—cer-
tainty at the units in my State and, 
Mr. President, your State. I have been 
to a number of the facilities in Georgia 
that will be impacted by this. 
In Missouri, there is the westward ex-
pansion that is celebrated at the arch, 
and we just made a significant invest-
ment in that facility. The Truman 
home in Independence will be a Na-
tional Park Service facility. The first 
park in America dedicated to an Afri-
can American, a national park, the 
George Washington Carver park at Dia-
mond, would be a place that would po-
tentially benefit from this. The new 
park that we have established in Ste. 
Genevieve, MO, that has more of the 
original 
French 
architecture 
left— 
vertical log architecture and big porch-
es that would have looked like a farm-
house in Normandy with a Caribbean 
porch put on it—numbers of those are 
going to create one of the best walking 
historic parks in America. That park 
would benefit. 
So the Federal Park System benefits, 
but this legislation also includes per-
manent annual funding for the Land 
and Water Conservation Fund. 
When you think of the title of the 
fund, why would you have to do perma-
nent funding to be sure that the Land 
and Water Conservation Fund got 
spent on land and water? It doesn’t 
seem to be a genius move to do what 
we are doing here. What we are doing 
here with this fund is taking about $900 
million a year that has been going in 
many cases for other purposes and say-
ing: No. We collect the fund for this 
purpose. Let’s use it for this purpose. It 
is not like we ran out of things to do 
with the money, and so we decided to 
put it somewhere else. But this does 
what the fund is supposed to do with 
the fund. 
In our State, again, in Missouri, over 
the past 50 years we spent about $150 
million out of that fund. The fund is 
being used to protect historically sig-
nificant sites like the Mark Twain Na-
tional Forest, the Ozark National Sce-
nic River, and the Big Muddy National 
Fish and Wildlife Refuge. They have all 
been beneficiaries of that fund to some 
extent. The Wilson’s Creek National 
Battlefield has been a beneficiary of 
that fund. The fund was created for the 
purpose that this legislation will en-
sure it largely serves. 
We know that we have to build im-
portant relationships between local 
communities, between the Park Serv-
ice, and between the American public 
to ensure that these sites are managed 
in the right way, that they are pre-
served for the future, and that they are 
safe to use for the millions of Ameri-
cans who are going to use them this 
summer and next summer and the sum-
mer after that, and this winter and 
next winter and the winter after that. 
In addition to the preservation and 
conservation efforts, the bill will help, 
frankly, 
bolster 
Missouri’s 
outdoor 
recreation industry, and it is signifi-
cant. The Outdoor Recreation Industry 
Association says that we generate 
about $14 billion—almost $15 billion—in 
our State in consumer spending, and 
about 133,000 jobs are created in Mis-
souri because of outdoor recreation. 
About 5 million American jobs are cre-
ated and around $800 billion of eco-
nomic activity are created because of 
the ability to use these and other out-
door resources. 
This is obviously not a normal year. 
So anything we can do to encourage 
people to use these facilities in a better 
way is important, as is anything we 
can do, as we look to the future, to 
maintain them and hand them over. 
And we have a chance here on all of 
these areas, whether it is the bureau of 
public lands or the national forests or 
the national parks, we have a chance 
to hand them to the next generation in 
better shape than we got them. We 
have a chance to look at projects that 
have been on the ‘‘we need to do this’’ 
list for 40 and 50 years and do what is 
needed to be done for 40 or 50 years. 
I am proud to be an original cospon-
sor of this bill. I am proud of the lead-
ership, particularly of Senator GARD-
NER and Senator DAINES, on our side on 
this effort, and the best bipartisan sup-
port that this bill will have. I look for-
ward to voting for it. I urge my col-
leagues to vote for it, and, even more 
importantly, I look forward to seeing 
this bill have the impact that it abso-
lutely will have and has to have on the 
important resources that we need to 
make the right kind of investment in. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
ISSUES FACING AMERICA 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, as ev-
erybody knows, our country today 
faces an extraordinary set of crises— 
unprecedented, in fact—in the modern 
history of this country. Over the last 
several weeks, hundreds of thousands 
of Americans from one end of this 
country to the other, from big cities 
and small towns, have rightly taken to 
the streets to demand an end to police 
murder and brutality and, in fact, to 
rethink the nature of policing in Amer-
ica. 
In the midst of that—that rising up 
for police department rethinking and 
police department murder and bru-
tality—our country continues to suffer 
from the COVID–19 pandemic, which, in 
a number of locations in this country, 
is actually getting worse and which 
has, up to this point, killed over 110,000 
people and infected over 2 million 
Americans. 
Then, on top of all of that—the strug-
gle for racial justice and dealing with a 
pandemic in the midst of all of that— 
we have the worse economic downturn 
since the Great Depression of the 1930s. 
In the last number of months, as you 
know, over 32 million Americans have 
lost their jobs. 
In the midst of the struggle for racial 
justice, in the midst of this horrific 
healthcare crisis, and in the midst of 
this economic meltdown, the American 
people are demanding to know what 
their government is doing in response 
to these crises. We were elected as Sen-
ators and Members of the House to re-
spond to the needs of the American 
people. All over this country the Amer-
ican people are looking around them. 
They see the struggle for racial justice. 
They see a pandemic. They see an eco-
nomic meltdown. And many of them 
are asking what the Republican leader-
ship here in the Senate is doing. There 
is crisis after crisis after crisis, and 
what is the leadership here in the Sen-
ate doing? Tragically, the answer is 
nothing—nothing. 
Historians have suggested that in the 
year 64 AD, while Rome was burning, 
the Emperor Nero played his fiddle. At 
least he did something. He provided en-
tertainment to his court. But here, in 
the U.S. Senate, Republican Leader 
MCCONNELL
and his leadership team 
are doing nothing. Sadly, tragically, 
this is the worst do-nothing Senate in 
modern American history, and every 
Member of this body should be deeply 
ashamed at the degree to which we are 
failing our constituents. 
Enough is enough. The U.S. Senate 
must respond to the pain and the suf-
fering of the American people. Let us 
quickly wrap up debate over the Land 
and Water Conservation Fund act, 
which is on the floor right now. Let us 
wrap up debate, and let us vote on this 
bill. It is a good bill. Let’s pass it. 
Then, let us begin to work on the un-
precedented crises that are facing our 
country. 
If there is anything that the torture 
and murder of George Floyd by Min-
neapolis police has taught us is that we 
have to rethink the nature of policing 
in America and reform our broken and 
racist criminal justice system. 
Let us be clear. The murder of 
George Floyd is not just an isolated in-
cident. It is the latest in an endless se-
ries of police killings of African Ameri-
cans—including Eric Garner, Sandra 
Bland, Laquan McDonald, Tamir Rice, 
Alton 
Sterling, 
Breonna 
Taylor, 
Freddie Gray, Rekia Boyd, Walter 
Scott, and many, many, many others. 
If anyone thinks that these police mur-
ders have just begun to take place in 
recent years when people had cell 
phone cameras, you would obviously 
have been mistaken. This has gone on 
forever. 
The American people are rightly de-
manding justice and an end to police 
brutality and murder. The U.S. Senate 
has got to act now. We have to hear the 
cries for justice that are coming from 
the streets of this country, that are 
coming from the African-American 
community, from the White commu-
nity, from the Latino community, and 
from all of our people. We must act and 
we must act now. 
Let me just suggest some of the 
items that must be in the legislation 
that we pass. This is a limited number. 
We can do more.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2858 
June 10, 2020 
In my view, every police officer in-
volved in a killing must be held ac-
countable, and those found guilty must 
be punished with the full force of law. 
That includes officers who stand by 
while these brutal acts take place. 
Every single killing of a person by po-
lice or while in police custody must be 
investigated by the Department of Jus-
tice. We must create a process by 
which police departments look like the 
communities that they serve and not 
look like invading armies. 
We need to abolish qualified immu-
nity so police officers are held civilly 
liable for abuses. We need to prohibit 
the 
transfer 
of 
offensive 
military 
equipment to police departments. We 
need to strip Federal funds from de-
partments that violate civil rights. We 
need to provide funding to States and 
municipalities to create a civilian 
corps of unarmed first responders to 
supplement law enforcement. 
For too long we have asked police de-
partments to do things which they are 
not trained or prepared to do and have 
criminalized societal problems like ad-
diction, homelessness, and mental ill-
ness. These are not problems solved by 
incarceration. 
We need to make records of police 
misconduct publicly available so that 
an officer with a record of misconduct 
cannot simply move two towns over 
and start again. 
We need to require all jurisdictions 
that receive grant funding to establish 
independent 
police 
conduct 
review 
boards that are broadly representative 
of the community and that have the 
authority to refer deaths that occur at 
the hands of police or in police custody 
to Federal authorities for investiga-
tion. 
We need to ban the use of rubber bul-
lets, tear gas, and pepper spray on pro-
testers. We need to make certain that 
when people go to the street to protest, 
they are not treated like criminals and 
their basic constitutional rights are 
not denied. The struggle for racial jus-
tice is just one of the crises that we 
have to address. 
Today, we are looking at a pandemic 
unprecedented in the last 100 years, 
and I would tell you that New Zealand, 
a very small country of about 5 million 
people, did something rather inter-
esting—not surprising but interesting. 
They listened to their scientists. They 
acted boldly at the start of the pan-
demic, and they had political leader-
ship trusted by their citizens. The re-
sult is that just the other day, New 
Zealand was able to announce that the 
COVID–19 virus was virtually elimi-
nated in their country and they could 
reopen their economy safely—safely. 
On the other hand, in the United 
States, under President Trump, we 
have a President who downplayed the 
crisis from the very beginning, who ig-
nored or attacked scientists, and who 
most people recognize is a pathological 
liar, not to be trusted. 
In New Zealand and in many other 
countries, bold and intelligent action 
saved lives, and in our country, incom-
petent leadership cost us lives. 
Well, we cannot bring back those who 
unnecessarily died or who have become 
ill, but what we can do is take action 
now to do everything possible to mini-
mize unnecessary deaths and illness in 
the future. First and foremost, we need 
a national protocol based on science to 
address this pandemic and not have 50 
States and hundreds of communities 
going forward in different directions. 
There is a way to effectively deal with 
this crisis, and that leadership should 
be coming from the Federal Govern-
ment. What we are talking about is the 
need, among other things, for increased 
testing and how to best utilize that 
testing as we talk about opening busi-
nesses and schools. We need, through 
the Defense Production Act and any 
other approach, to make certain that 
all medical personnel have the nec-
essary personal protective equipment 
that they need. 
Even today, months after the pan-
demic erupted, doctors and nurses still 
lack the equipment they need to pro-
tect themselves. I was on the phone 
just a couple of weeks ago with people 
in Vermont who work in clinics. They 
still do not have the protective equip-
ment they need. 
We need to produce hundreds of mil-
lions of the most effective masks that 
we can so as to protect all Americans, 
above and beyond medical personnel. 
Masks are an important part of fight-
ing this pandemic, and every American 
should be able to have the best quality 
masks possible. 
Working with the international com-
munity, we need to make certain that 
a safe vaccine is produced as quickly as 
possible and that it is distributed to 
every American for free. I have asked 
the Trump administration on several 
occasions. God willing, that vaccine 
will be produced soon—as soon as pos-
sible. We all want that. 
As you know, the Federal Govern-
ment is spending billions of dollars to 
help 
develop 
that 
vaccine, 
giving 
money to the drug companies. That is 
fine, but after that vaccine is devel-
oped, it must be distributed to every 
man, woman, and child in this country 
at no cost. I don’t want to see people 
dying because they can’t afford to pay 
for a vaccine. I don’t want to see the 
drug companies profiteering from this 
Federal investment. 
When we are talking about respond-
ing to the pandemic, we are talking 
about 
workers 
who 
are 
on 
the 
frontlines, whether they are medical 
professionals, 
workers 
in 
transpor-
tation, grocery stores, drug stores, 
meatpacking plants, or whatever. They 
must receive hazard pay for the dan-
gerous work that they do. I get a little 
bit tired of seeing these TV ads from 
big corporations thanking the heroes 
who are out on the frontlines. Well, 
that is great. Thank them, but pay 
them. Pay them hazardous pay for the 
dangerous work that they are doing. 
We can no longer allow multi-billion 
dollar 
corporations 
like 
Amazon, 
Walmart, and Tyson Foods to treat es-
sential workers like expendable work-
ers—like sacrificial workers. We can no 
longer allow multi-billion dollar cor-
porations to run advertising calling 
their workers ‘‘heroes’’ while paying 
them starvation wages and treating 
them disrespectfully. 
It is not just the racial justice crisis 
we face, not just the pandemic we face, 
but we are in the midst of an unprece-
dented economic crisis, and we must 
act boldly and aggressively to protect 
the American people in the midst of 
this crisis. As we speak, tens of mil-
lions of people have lost their jobs. 
They are worried about being evicted 
from their apartments. They are wor-
ried about losing their homes. They are 
worried about putting food on the 
table. In Vermont—and, I suspect, in 
every State in this country—there are 
people lining up at emergency food 
banks to get the food they need to feed 
their kids. Anyone who thinks that 
this is not a moment of urgency does 
not understand what the word urgency 
means. When people in America go 
hungry, we have to act. When people 
are being evicted from their apart-
ments or losing their homes, we have 
to act, and we have to act now, not a 
month from now, not 2 months from 
now. 
No, President Trump, this is not a 
time to take a victory lap. The real un-
employment rate remains over 20 per-
cent, the highest it has been since the 
Great Depression. Unless we get our 
act together boldly, over half of small 
business owners in America will be 
forced to close their doors for good 
within the next 6 months. We need to 
respond vigorously to the economic cri-
sis that we face and the pain and suf-
fering of the American people. 
Now, what does that mean? Again, 
these are just a few of the provisions 
that have to be passed. We need to pass 
a paycheck security act which does 
what many European countries do, and 
that is to provide workers with 100 per-
cent of the paychecks and benefits they 
previously received. According to a re-
cent study from the University of Cali-
fornia Berkeley, if we had adopted a 
paycheck guarantee program similar 
to the one in Germany, 24 million 
Americans would have a job today. In-
stead, we are seeing President Trump 
and Senator MCCONNELL taking a vic-
tory lap because we created some 2 mil-
lion jobs last month. That is good, but 
when we have 32 million people who 
have lost their jobs in recent months, 
we have to act, and we have to act 
boldly. 
In my view, during this crisis, we 
must make sure that every American 
gets the healthcare they need by ex-
panding Medicare to cover the under-
insured, the uninsured, and the needs 
of people who have private insurance 
but inadequate private insurance. In 
my view, in the midst of this crisis 
with so much economic suffering, we 
need to provide every working-class

person in this country with a $2,000 
emergency payment each and every 
month until the crisis is over, so that 
they can pay the rent, feed their fami-
lies, and deal with their basic needs. 
Furthermore, as a top priority, we 
have to make sure that nobody in 
America goes hungry, and that means 
substantially expanding the Meals on 
Wheels program, the school meals pro-
grams, and SNAP benefits. 
Here we are. All over this country 
people are demanding an end to police 
killings and brutality and demanding 
racial justice in this country. All over 
this country, people are being infected 
with a virus and continue to die, and 
all over this country, people are won-
dering how they are going to pay their 
bills because they have lost their jobs 
and have, in some cases, no food in the 
cupboard. If there was ever a time in 
the modern history of this country 
that the Senate and the House are 
called upon to stand up for families, for 
the working families of this country, 
who are struggling, who are living in 
emotional anxiety, who are scared to 
death about what is going to happen in 
the future, and if we are to reaffirm 
faith in government in this country to 
know that we are seeing and hearing 
that pain, now is the time. So today, I 
just call upon my colleagues. I know 
we have disagreements, but let us un-
derstand the urgency of the moment. 
Let’s deal with the pandemic. Let’s 
save lives. Let’s deal with the eco-
nomic crisis. Let’s put people back to 
work. Let’s deal with the issue of ra-
cial justice. Let’s fight to end racism 
in this country. There is an enormous 
amount of work to be done. Let’s do it. 
Thank you. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today having just 
heard the Senator from Vermont talk-
ing about the Nation in its effort to re-
cover from the coronavirus crisis and 
the economic crisis as a result, and 
other important issues affecting our 
country. I heard him say that we have 
not done enough and need to do more, 
specifically with an economic recovery, 
with a coronavirus recovery, and it 
sounded like almost a liberal wish list 
of 
government 
providing 
for 
food, 
clothing, shelter, and income for every 
American. 
I come to the floor today to tell you 
what we have done, in a historic way, 
because we passed the largest economic 
rescue package in the history of this 
country—trillions and trillions of dol-
lars. This Senate, the House, and the 
White House went all-in to respond to 
and help us as a nation to recover from 
the coronavirus crisis. 
Last week, the Senate passed and the 
President signed another bipartisan 
bill to help small businesses across our 
country. It is the Paycheck Protection 
Program Flexibility Act. That is what 
the people of Wyoming were asking 
for—this very successful Paycheck Pro-
tection Program, with flexibility, so it 
would be easier for our small busi-
nesses to use the relief funds. And 1,000 
businesses in Wyoming took over $1 
billion in loans, and it is keeping our 
economy alive, breathing life into the 
economy, and allowing paychecks to 
continue to be paid as our businesses 
reopen. 
All across the country, this jobs-sav-
ing effort is working, because last 
month the U.S. economy added 2.5 mil-
lion jobs. It smashed all expectations. 
It was the largest single month of job 
growth in this Nation in the history of 
our great country. Americans literally 
ran out the front door and back to 
work. Unemployment was down in 
May. It defied all of the forecasts and 
defied what we just heard the Senator 
from Vermont talking about and what 
his expectations have been. 
We are headed for a faster economic 
rebound than anyone has imagined. 
Across 
the 
country, 
the 
State 
lockdowns have been ended. States 
have started to safely reopen. Small 
businesses are reopening. People are 
going back to work. I thought I heard 
the Senator from Vermont say that he 
was thinking that half of all the small 
businesses in America wouldn’t be able 
to reopen again ever. 
Young people are going back to 
school. K–12 schools and colleges are 
planning to reopen this fall. Of course, 
I don’t think any of us were surprised 
to see the University of California sys-
tem say that they are going to stay 
closed until 2021—until next year, all 10 
campuses—because in California, one 
size fits all. But for the rest of our Na-
tion, the schools and the colleges are 
reopening and students will be heading 
back to campus. 
There is a return-to-normal routine 
that is going to boost our commu-
nities. As the American recovery be-
gins, we are going all in to keep people 
safe. That is a big part of it. That 
means more virus testing, more treat-
ment, and better treatment and vac-
cines. 
Innovations are rapidly expanding 
testing. The country has now per-
formed 
more 
than 
22 
million 
coronavirus tests. Nearly a half million 
tests are done every day, including 
today. Our researchers, our scientists, 
and our doctors are making record 
progress on a vaccine. We are calling 
this effort Operation Warp Speed. It is 
a public-private partnership with com-
panies producing a vaccine for the 
American people that will then be used 
around the world. The private sector fi-
nalists will soon be announced. The 
government will support their vaccine 
work, will assist with clinical trials, 
and will prioritize review of the most 
promising vaccines. 
One 
of 
the 
companies, 
called 
Moderna, is in phase 2 trials and plans 
to start phase 3 in July. The Food and 
Drug Administration approval is then 
the 
final 
step. 
Another 
company, 
AstraZeneca, plans to end phase 2 and 
phase 3 trials over the next few 
months. 
AstraZeneca just announced a new 
partnership with the Biomedical Re-
search Authority and the Defense Ad-
vanced Research Projects Agency. So 
our military is joining in this public/ 
private partnership. This project may 
deliver emergency vaccines as early as 
October, which would certainly be 
record-breaking. The pharmaceutical 
company Merck will conduct trials in 
July. Johnson & Johnson plans phase 1 
and phase 2 trials for July as well. 
Pfizer hopes to have a vaccine ready by 
October. The goal is to make a safe, ef-
fective vaccine and make it available 
to all Americans by January of 2021. 
Operation Warp Speed partners want 
to beat this, and they want to make 
that their most ambitious goal—beat-
ing timelines that have never been 
beaten before, breaking the records. At 
the same time a number of other com-
panies are pursuing a vaccine independ-
ently. 
America’s 
researchers, 
sci-
entists, and doctors have dropped ev-
erything and are working in overdrive. 
They have gone all in. 
One major drug company CEO said 
yesterday that there will be no big 
price 
for 
the 
coronavirus 
vaccine. 
Every company should make that same 
pledge. Every company should make 
that same pledge. This is a tremendous 
opportunity for companies to do the 
right thing, to make the vaccine as ac-
cessible as any vaccine in the history 
of our Nation. 
As we begin to recover from this cri-
sis, the goal is clear, and it has been 
clear: We want to keep Americans safe 
and get them back to work. Together, 
that is what we must all endeavor to 
do. 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor.

OFFICER

BOOZMAN). The Senator from Lou-

CONCERNS OVER NATIONS FUND-
ING UNIVERSITY CAMPUS INSTI-
TUTES IN THE UNITED STATES 
ACT 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, let me 
apologize in advance. My accent has 
not changed, but my speech has. I had 
a little oral surgery, so I am going to 
try to be as clear as I can be. 
I want to talk for a few minutes 
today about the Communist Party of 
China and Confucius Institutes. 
As you know, Confucius Institutes 
are the Communist Party of China’s so- 
called learning centers that are located 
on 72 university campuses across the 
continental 
United 
States 
and, 
of 
course, Alaska and Hawaii. Each one of 
these symbols is one of these Confucius 
Institutes located at one of our univer-
sities. 
Here is how a Confucius Institute 
works. The Communist Party of China 
gives our universities—these 72 univer-
sities—the money to open these Confu-
cius Institutes, and supposedly the pur-
pose of these Confucius Institutes is to, 
A, teach the Chinese language, and B,

to teach culture about the country of 
China to American students. 
At this juncture, it is important to 
distinguish 
between 
the 
people 
of 
China and the Chinese Communist 
Party. I had the pleasure of visiting 
China a number of times, and I know 
the Presiding Officer has. The Chinese 
people are wonderful people. They are 
smart. They are hard-working. They 
have a wonderful sense of humor. They 
are just extraordinary people. Their 
government, the Communist Party of 
China—not so much. Not nearly so 
much. So when I talk today about 
China, I am talking about their govern-
ment, the Communist Party of China. 
These Confucius Institutes, which 
are, once again, funded by the Com-
munist Party of China, you will not be 
surprised to learn come with a lot of 
strings attached to that Chinese Com-
munist Party money. For example, 
most of the teachers who teach at 
these Confucius Institutes on American 
university campuses are trained in 
China. In fact, the Communist Party of 
China has to approve all the teachers 
even though they are teaching in our 
universities. The Communist Party of 
China also has to approve all of the 
events and the speakers at these Confu-
cius Institutes. 
In addition, in order to get the 
money from the Communist Party of 
China, our universities have to agree 
that the Confucius Institutes will be 
governed by both Chinese law and 
American law. I have never seen any-
thing like that. It is unprecedented. 
In order to get the money from the 
Communist Party of China, our univer-
sities also have to agree through these 
Confucius Institutes that certain top-
ics will be off limits. For example, at 
these institutes, you can’t talk about 
Taiwan; you can’t talk about civil lib-
erties in Hong Kong; you can’t talk 
about Tiananmen Square and the mur-
ders there by the Communist Party of 
China; you can’t talk about Tibet; you 
can’t talk about the Dalai Lama; and 
you can’t talk about the discrimina-
tion and indeed the imprisonment of 
the 
Uighur 
Muslims 
in 
northwest 
China. Once again, these are institutes 
that are on American campuses, but in 
order to get the money from the Com-
munist Party of China, our universities 
have to agree that these topics are off 
limits. 
The Communist Party of China, in 
short, requires that these institutes 
can only teach versions of Chinese his-
tory, culture, and current events that 
are approved by the Communist Party 
of China. That is about the furthest 
thing you can imagine from academic 
freedom. 
How am I doing? Is my speech OK? I 
promise you, I haven’t been drinking. 
The first Confucius Institute was 
formed on an American campus in 2004, 
and 
since 
that 
time, 
they 
have 
evolved—and not in a good way. 
I want to give you a short quotation. 
You are familiar with the Politburo of 
the Communist Party of China. Back 
in 2011, a member of the Politburo, 
which is the senior leadership in China 
in its Communist Party, Comrade Li 
Changchun, described Confucius Insti-
tutes in a speech he gave in Beijing in 
2011. Comrade Li said: 
The Confucius Institutes are an appealing 
brand for extending China’s culture abroad. 
[They have] made an important contribution 
toward improving [our] soft power. ‘‘The 
‘Confucius 
brand’ 
has 
a 
natural 
attractiveness’’— 
A natural attractiveness. 
. . . using the excuse of teaching Chinese 
language, everything looks reasonable and 
logical.’’ 
But of course it is not. 
Many of our professors across Amer-
ica have condemned the behavior of the 
Confucius Institutes. The American As-
sociation of University Professors did a 
comprehensive study of Confucius In-
stitutes in 2014. Here is their report. 
This is what our professors concluded. 
I will quote from their report. 
Confucius Institutes function as an arm of 
the Chinese state and are allowed to ignore 
academic freedom. Their academic activities 
are under the supervision of Hanban, a Chi-
nese state agency which is chaired by a 
member of the Politburo and the vice-pre-
mier of the People’s Republic of China. Most 
agreements establishing Confucius Institutes 
feature nondisclosure clauses and unaccept-
able concessions to the political aims and 
practices of the government of China. Spe-
cifically, North American universities per-
mit Confucius Institutes to advance a state 
agenda in the recruitment and control of 
academic staff, in the choice of curriculum, 
and in the restriction of debate. 
I don’t want to beat this to death, 
but I have a number of studies. There 
is another one right here from the 
GAO. 
I won’t bore you with the details, but 
here is a 2019 report calling for either 
the overhaul or the closure of Confu-
cius Institutes in America, which was 
issued by the U.S. Senate Permanent 
Subcommittee on Investigations. 
Many U.S. colleges have disbanded 
Confucius Institutes. I want to be fair. 
Not that many years ago, there were 
over 100 of these little symbols. Now 
there are 72. About 30 universities have 
said: No, we believe in academic free-
dom—universities like the University 
of Chicago, Miami-Dade College, and 
Pennsylvania State University. 
Senator DOUG JONES, our colleague 
from Alabama, the distinguished junior 
Senator from Alabama, and I have a 
bill. It deals with Confucius Institutes, 
but it wouldn’t abolish them. It would 
not. The name of the bill—it is called 
the Concerns Over Nations Funding 
University Campus Institutes in the 
United States Act, the CONFUCIUS 
Act, by Senator DOUG JONES and my-
self. 
Our bill would reform Confucius In-
stitutes. Our bill would allow them to 
exist, but it would require all Amer-
ican universities that choose to sign a 
contract and receive money from and 
with the Communist Party of China to 
enter into contracts that require the 
Confucius Institutes to do the fol-
lowing: The Confucius Institute, by 
contract, would have to provide that it 
would protect academic freedom at the 
university; that it would prohibit the 
application of any foreign law on any 
campus of the institution; and that 
rather than granting full managerial 
control to the Chinese Party of China, 
it would grant full managerial author-
ity of the Confucius Institute to the 
campus on which the Confucius Insti-
tute is situated. That would include 
full control over what is being taught, 
the activities carried out, the research 
grants that are made, and who was em-
ployed at the Confucius Institute. 
If the Confucius Institutes are going 
to be part of our universities, they 
should be part of our universities. 
Freedom of speech, full academic free-
dom—anything is open for discussion, 
and we don’t have to have it first ap-
proved by the Communist Party of 
China. 
I think Senator JONES’ and my bill 
would restore balance. It would restore 
truth. It would restore transparency. I 
know it would restore academic free-
dom to these Confucius Institutes that 
are operating in the United States of 
America. 
Toward that end, Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Com-
mittee on Health, Education, Labor, 
and Pensions be discharged from fur-
ther consideration of S. 939—that is the 
CONFUCIUS Act—and the Senate pro-
ceed to its immediate consideration. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The clerk will report the bill by title. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
A bill (S. 939) to establish limitations re-
garding Confucius Institutes, and for other 
purposes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection to proceeding to the meas-
ure? 
There being no objection, the com-
mittee was discharged, and the Senate 
proceeded to consider the bill. 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, with 
gratitude to my coauthor, Senator 
DOUG JONES, who has done an extraor-
dinary job on this legislation, I ask 
unanimous consent that the bill be 
considered read a third time and passed 
and that the motion to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
The bill (S. 939) was ordered to be en-
grossed for a third reading, was read 
the third time, and passed, as follows:

f 
TAXPAYER FIRST ACT OF 2019— 
Continued 
JUSTICE IN POLICING ACT 
Ms. 
STABENOW. 
Mr. 
President, 
something is happening in America. 
People across our country and in my 
home State of Michigan are coming to-
gether for the cause of racial justice in 
a way that we have not really experi-
enced in a generation. 
From Holland, to Bad Axe, to Mar-
quette, to Detroit, people of all ages 
and faiths and backgrounds have been 
marching together, singing together, 
praying together, and kneeling to-
gether. In one voice, people are de-
manding change, imploring our Nation 
to finally be that place where all men 
and women are truly created equal. Un-
fortunately, we know that, far too 
often throughout our history and even 
today, our Nation has failed to live up 
to our highest ideals. 
Eight minutes forty-six seconds— 
that is how long a Minneapolis police 
officer, Derek Chauvin, knelt on the 
neck of George Floyd, an unarmed, 
handcuffed Black man lying on the 
pavement. For 8 minutes 46 seconds, 
George Floyd pleaded for his life. He 
said, ‘‘I can’t breathe.’’ He cried out for 
his mother. He suffered. Then he was 
silent. 
Millions of Americans watched the 
video in shock and horror. Why didn’t 
the officer just lift his knee off of Mr. 
Floyd’s neck? Why didn’t he just lift 
his knee up for just a minute—just lift 
it up? Why didn’t one—just one—of the 
other officers push his knee off of Mr. 
Floyd’s neck? 
What is happening in America that 
someone—let alone police officers— 
thought this was OK? Of course, we 
know it was not OK. It was not OK. It 
was a crime. It was murder. 
Watching those images has awakened 
something deep in the souls of Ameri-
cans across the country. We know that 
racial disparities in every part of our 
society—from healthcare, to housing, 
to jobs, to education, to the air we 
breathe and the water we drink—have 
existed in our country since its very 
beginning. We have known for a long 
time that experiences with the police 
are different for Black Americans than 
for White Americans. Yet, despite all of 
the other times, this time—this time— 
there the violence was, right in front of 
us, in a way that people have decided 
cannot and will not be ignored. 
There is much to do. For each of us, 
we have a personal journey—a personal 
journey to take concerning our own be-
havior with one another, and then we 
have a public journey to take together, 
to change laws and policies and work 
together toward the day when what 
happened in Minneapolis and across 
our country never happens again. That 
is the goal of the Justice in Policing 
Act. I am honored to cosponsor it, and 
I want to thank my friends Senator 
BOOKER and Senator HARRIS for leading 
us in this introduction. 
The Justice in Policing Act takes im-
portant steps to improve transparency 
by collecting better and more accurate 
data on police misconduct and the use 
of force. This will help ensure that 
problem officers aren’t simply getting 
a job with a police department in an-
other city or State to avoid being held 
accountable for their previous actions. 
The 
legislation 
improves 
police 
training and practices by ending racial 
and religious profiling, requiring offi-
cers to receive training on racial bi-
ases, banning no-knock warrants in 
drug cases, limiting the transfer of 
military-grade equipment to police de-
partments, and banning chokeholds 
like the one that ended George Floyd’s 
life. It finally makes lynching a Fed-
eral crime—something that I would 
have thought we would have done a 
generation ago. It makes important 
changes within our criminal justice 
system to hold police officers and de-
partments accountable for their ac-
tions. 
This 
legislation 
is 
not 
about 
defunding the police. It is not about 
defunding law enforcement. It is about 
funding the right kind of law enforce-
ment, the kind of law enforcement that 
protects all of our neighborhoods and 
the people who live in them; the kind 
of law enforcement that officers I know 
in Michigan—including in my own fam-
ily, across Michigan—do every day; the 
kind of law enforcement I know the 
majority of police officers believe in. 
In short, this legislation is about 
treating people as professionals, with 
high standards, and expecting them to 
meet those standards. In any profes-
sional setting, including law enforce-
ment, we should expect high standards 
and accountability for meeting those 
standards. We have a right to expect 
the best from our police officers. 
Firing dozens of bullets into a Louis-
ville apartment under a no-knock war-
rant, killing a 26-year-old emergency 
medical technician and aspiring nurse 
who grew up in Michigan, did not meet 
the high standards we have a right to 
expect. Breonna Taylor deserved the 
best from our police. She did not get it. 
Shoving a 75-year-old man at a pro-
test in Buffalo hard enough that his 
head cracked open while hitting the 
ground, creating a pool of blood, and 
then watching officer after officer 
walking past him without offering any 
help does not reflect the high standards 
we have a right to expect. Martin 
Gugino deserved the best from our po-
lice, and he did not get it. 
Kneeling on the neck of a man who is 
lying on the ground for 8 minutes 46 
seconds, as he cries out for his mother 
and the life leaves his body, is not 
meeting the high standards he had the 
right to expect. George Floyd deserved 
the best from our police. He did not re-
ceive it. 
The U.S. Senate needs to pass the 
Justice in Policing Act now. I would 
love it if there was strong bipartisan 
support. Wouldn’t that send a wonder-
ful message across our country if we 
could do that? 
However, holding law enforcement to 
high professional standards is only the 
first step in becoming the Nation we 
all want to be. Racism has been with us 
since slaves were brought on ships to 
this country. It is an immoral thread 
that is woven deep in the fabric of our 
Nation’s history. 
It is simply not enough to end racial 
inequalities in policing because the in-
equalities in our society don’t end 
there. The pandemic has shone a brutal 
light on this truth. 
Our Democratic caucus released a re-
port on April 30 that showed that Black 
Americans are more than twice as like-
ly as White Americans to die from 
COVID–19, and in some communities, 
this disparity is even greater. In Michi-
gan, 14 percent of our citizens are Afri-
can Americans. Yet African Americans 
make up 41 percent—41 percent—of the 
deaths from COVID–19. It is not hard to 
see why, if you look. Because of gen-
erations of structural racism, Black 
Americans are less likely to have 
health insurance, more likely to have 
preexisting health conditions and high-
er risks for Black moms during labor 
and delivery, more likely to be exposed 
to air pollution because of where they 
live, and less likely to live in housing 
where social distancing is even pos-
sible. 
Black families also face challenges in 
accessing healthy food. While around 12 
percent of American families overall 
are food secure, we know that more 
than 22 percent of African-American 
families are food insecure—more than 
one out of every five families. 
At the same time, in this health cri-
sis Black Americans are more likely to

be the ones working on the frontlines— 
these are the frontline jobs that can’t 
be done at home—even though their 
children are home from school or 
childcare because they have had to 
close. They have more costs, but they 
are on the frontlines, and they are the 
ones still working. In fact, 41 percent 
of our essential workers are people of 
color. The majority are women. That is 
exposing them to both COVID–19 and 
now layoffs. 
While more than 12 percent of White 
Americans are out of work, nearly 17 
percent of Black Americans have lost 
their jobs so far. No single piece of leg-
islation, no matter how good, is going 
to solve these systemic issues all at 
once. We know that, but our con-
tinuing actions can do that, if we are 
aware and our eyes are open and we are 
paying attention and we are doing the 
best we can on everything that we do. 
That is why we need to pass the He-
roes Act, passed by the House, as soon 
as possible. It has been weeks now 
since the House took action, and it is 
critically important that we get that 
done. This bill gives premium pay to 
our frontline workers, so we are not 
just applauding them. That does not 
pay for their childcare while they are 
working or for food or for keeping a 
roof over their own heads. We need to 
provide hazard pay, premium pay, for 
the people who are working when we 
have the luxury of working at home. 
The House bill extends unemployment 
benefits that are critical, strengthens 
emergency paid leave, and offers food 
and rent and mortgage assistance to 
families who need it. 
That is why it is so important to pay 
attention every time legislation comes 
to the floor and that we evaluate 
through the lens of how this affects ev-
eryone. How does this affect the poor? 
How does this affect communities of 
color? Are we doing everything we can 
to make sure we are not adding to the 
racial disparities or economic dispari-
ties that have lived with us for way too 
long? 
Senate Democrats, looking at every 
piece of legislation, paid attention on 
the Paycheck Protection Act, and we 
were successful in amending it to en-
sure that minority-owned businesses 
and underserved communities would 
receive the same business help and the 
same access to capital as majority- 
White businesses. 
It was a real fight to get that done. It 
was a struggle. It should not have been. 
When people say racial disparities are 
in the past, I say it is right here, right 
now. When we look at moving forward 
on legislation, we need to see who is 
helped, who is impacted, is it fair, and 
does everybody have a fair shot? 
Today, once again, we see in Georgia 
why 
it 
is 
outrageous that MITCH 
MCCONNELL has been blocking a vote 
on the Voting Rights Advancement Act 
that the House passed 187 days ago. It 
was 187 days ago that they passed a bill 
to restore the Voting Rights Act, with 
no action here in the Senate. This 
needs to be passed immediately. It is 
another piece of what is happening in 
terms of the racial inequality in this 
country. 
Racial disparities are not in the past. 
Racism is not in the past. We are see-
ing it every day right in front of our 
eyes. Now is the time to keep our eyes 
open. Now is the time to lift America 
up to the best we can be. We need to 
pass the Justice in Policing Act, and 
we need to pass the Heroes Act to put 
people ahead of profits in this pan-
demic and close the gaps in invest-
ments in our communities that have 
created the racial disparities we see 
today in every part of our society and 
in every community, and we need to 
pass the Voting Rights Advancement 
Act right now. That would be a great 
thing to get done this week. 
There is not much happening on the 
Senate floor right now. It would be 
great if we could come together and all 
stand behind something as basic as 
making sure that everybody fully has 
the right to vote in this country. 
One of George Floyd’s high school 
friends, Jonathan Veal, remembered 
that on their last day of 11th grade, 
George turned to him and said: ‘‘I want 
to touch the world.’’ 
George Floyd has touched the world. 
He has touched the hearts of people 
around the world. His horrific murder 
has inspired a worldwide movement 
against systemic racism and police 
brutality. I know that is cold comfort 
for his family and his friends who are 
missing him so much. 
It is time for us—all of us—to set 
high standards for law enforcement and 
the quality of life we want for all of 
our families. It is time to hold each 
other accountable to live up to our 
highest and best ideals as Americans. 
George’s last breath cannot be the last 
word. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
H.R. 1957 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, the 
Federal Government currently owns 
about 640 million acres of land in the 
United States, which means 640 million 
acres is owned by the American people, 
and that is about 28 percent of all the 
land mass of the United States. If you 
round the number up, let’s say, a quar-
ter of all the property in the United 
States is owned by the Federal tax-
payers. When you can break that down, 
people immediately think it is all the 
National Park Service. Actually, the 
National Park Service is a small 
amount of that. 
The Bureau of Land Management 
holds about 244 million acres, followed 
by the U.S. Forest Service with 192 
million acres, Fish and Wildlife Service 
with 89 million acres, and then the Na-
tional Park Service right at 80 million 
acres. The Department of Defense and 
some other agencies hold another 34 
million acres. All together, there are 
640 million acres and growing. 
This doesn’t even account for all of 
the land that is controlled by the Fed-
eral Government. That is the amount 
just owned by the Federal Government. 
That 28 percent of all the property in 
the United States that is owned by the 
Federal Government doesn’t take into 
account the 27 million-plus acres that 
are also controlled by the Federal Gov-
ernment. Those are areas where they 
do conservation mitigation. Those are 
areas where they have land in trust for 
other aspects. 
All told, around 30 percent of the 
United States is owned or controlled by 
the Federal taxpayer, by the Federal 
Government. That would all be fine 
and good if we were managing it well, 
but we are not. On those properties 
right now, we have almost $20 billion in 
deferred maintenance backlog. That is 
almost $20 billion just in things that 
haven’t been done and where the Fed-
eral Government has proved to be a bad 
land manager. 
There is a bill that is coming this 
week. It is on the floor now being de-
bated. The conversation is about this: 
How do we get better at maintaining 
the land that we have and how can we 
actually purchase additional property? 
There is something that has been 
around a long time called the Land and 
Water Conservation Fund. The Land 
and Water Conservation Fund has dol-
lars set aside from offshore oil revenue 
to be able to purchase areas of prop-
erty. That has happened for decades 
now. The problem is we haven’t main-
tained that. Even with the property 
that we buy that has maintenance 
issues, we don’t fix the maintenance 
issues when we purchase the property. 
The proposal on the table this week 
is to double the amount of land acqui-
sitions that we have and to be able to 
solve the maintenance issue that we 
have had for a long time. This con-
versation about the backlog and main-
tenance has been an ongoing issue. 
There is finally a resolution to it. 
Here is the resolution. After years 
and years of debating a resolution 
about how to reduce spending in one 
area so we can make sure we can do the 
maintenance we need to do, the final 
decision was made to be able to put a 
bill together that just says: Forget it; 
let’s just all add it to debt. Let’s just 
completely do debt purchasing of all of 
our maintenance stuff. We will figure 
out some decades in the future how to 
be able to pay for that, rather than dis-
cerning how to pay for it now because 
there is not an offset on how to be able 
to pay for the maintenance. 
The maintenance needs to be done. It 
is not a shock to anyone. I brought pro-
posals to this years ago, saying: Why 
don’t we split the dollars we have in 
the land and Water Conservation Fund, 
use half of those dollars to purchase 
new properties and half of it just to be 
able to work on maintenance? 
That was denied. They said: No, that 
is an irrational approach. We want to 
buy more land and figure out later how 
to maintain it. 
We are at that point where we have 
to figure out how to maintain it be-
cause an almost $20 billion backlog in

maintenance is rising up and scream-
ing at us all over the country. Instead 
of actually deciding how we are going 
to do it, this is a punt saying we will 
figure it out later. 
Here is the fiscally responsible por-
tion of it. We are not going to do this 
forever just to work on maintenance 
backlog. This is just for the next 5 
years that we will have additional 
debt. Every single year we will spend 
about $2 billion, all in debt money, to 
be able to do this, and then we will fig-
ure out in the sixth year how to be able 
to take care of the rest. The fiscally re-
sponsible portion of this is to say we 
are not doing infinite amounts of debt. 
It will just be the next 5 years. 
The problem is that in the sixth year 
we will still have a maintenance back-
log. We will still have issues, and there 
is still not a plan to pay for the first 
$20 billion for what is still coming. 
My challenge is figuring out what we 
can do with a bill that we need to fix. 
We need to be better managers of our 
land, but we are managing our land by 
not managing our debt and not making 
the hard decisions that people have to 
make. At your home, you can’t just 
say: Everything needs to be fixed, but I 
can’t afford it; so I will take out more 
debt, and I will fix everything. 
We have to make decisions on what is 
going to have to wait so we can do this 
because it is more important. That is 
the kind of thing I would like to be 
able to see with this. 
Let me run through basic ideas. They 
are all amendments that were already 
brought up that say: Here are logical 
ways to be able to fix this, beginning 
with the most basic of them. Take part 
of the money that already exists for 
the Land and Water Conservation Fund 
to purchase new land, and then split it, 
saying we are going to dedicate dollars 
to maintenance and also have dollars 
to buy new properties. We will not be 
able to buy as many as fast as we want. 
We will not be able to fix as many 
things as we want, but we are not add-
ing additional debt spending to do it. 
These are the same decisions that fam-
ilies make all the time. I would love to 
have the nicer car. I can have the nicer 
car if I just save up for several years to 
get it. 
That is one recommendation. 
There is a second recommendation to 
this. There is a portion of this that 
gets into the budget scheming of every-
thing that goes on. Part of what is hap-
pening to the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund is moving it—brace 
yourself from budget gimmicks here— 
to what is called appropriated dollars 
that we vote on every year to manda-
tory dollars you only vote on once and 
every year it keeps going. Think of it 
like Social Security. Social Security 
was voted on a long time ago and keeps 
going year after year. We don’t vote on 
it each year. It happens because it is 
mandatory. 
The idea in this bill was to move the 
spending from being appropriated each 
year like we do with the Department of 
Defense or Department of Education or 
Health and Human Services, to take it 
out of that area and move it toward 
mandatory. Then they still left the 
funds over in the appropriated side and 
said: We are also going to spend those 
dollars as well. 
The gimmick that this sets up is it 
allows those funds that were spent last 
year to be spent on the mandatory side 
this year and leaves a big hole on the 
normal side that will just plus-up to 
spend for other things. 
My second idea is this: If we will not 
split the dollars we normally use for 
half of the purchase and half to main-
tain, at least dedicate the dollars that 
were left and aren’t spent on some-
thing else and spend those on mainte-
nance, because then we will only have 
half a billion dollars of new deficit 
rather than what this does at $2.5 bil-
lion of new deficit spending. 
The first challenge is to split it. 
The second challenge is take the dol-
lars that were ‘‘left over’’ in appro-
priated dollars and just dedicate that 
to only doing the maintenance funds 
that need to be done. 
The third idea is pretty simple, as 
well. This has a 5-year tail on it on the 
maintenance, at about $2 billion a year 
of additional debt spending. I would 
just say that if we are only going to do 
maintenance for 5 years, we should 
only do the purchasing, which is the 
big chunk of this, for 5 years, as well, 
so that we sunset both of them. We are 
not going to have this big plus-up and 
more and more purchasing at the same 
time we have no plan to maintain it 
long term. As long as we are going to 
maintain it, we will also do purchasing. 
Just sunset it. That seems common 
sense as well. 
Here is a fourth idea. When you pur-
chase new properties, make sure that 
with the dollars that are used to pur-
chase it, there are also dollars set aside 
to fix what is broken on it. 
We often find that when people want 
to sell property to the Federal Govern-
ment, it is because there are major 
problems on the land already, and they 
can’t get another private seller. So 
they want to sell it to the Federal tax-
payer, knowing there are problems in 
infrastructure on that property. 
We buy property with major mainte-
nance needs already on it, and it just 
backs up our backlog of maintenance 
even more. Put a requirement in that 
says when we buy property, part of the 
purchase of it is also setting aside dol-
lars for maintenance, so we have to fix 
it right then, rather than add it to the 
backlog of maintenance issues. That 
makes common sense. 
That also is not getting a hearing 
right now. I think that is a problem. 
There are commonsense things that 
don’t drive us further into debt, that 
aren’t going to cause years and years 
of problems in our budget, that main-
tain the properties that we have— 
maybe not as fast as we want to, but 
its starts getting after our backlog of 
maintenance—that continue to allow 
us to purchase new properties, but to 
make sure that we are actually man-
aging the properties that we purchase. 
It is a frustration for me that we are 
not having amendments in this proc-
ess, that we are not having the oppor-
tunity to be able to fix some of the 
things that are wrong with this bill— 
because we do need to have Federal 
lands, we do need to maintain the lands 
that we have, but we do need to honor 
our budgets for the future, as well. 
Why would we say we really need to 
maintain all of this and purchase this, 
but we don’t have a plan for how to do 
it now and so we will just wait 6 years? 
We will have 5 years of debt spending, 
and then we will somehow figure it out 
6 years from now. 
Five years ago we were talking about 
this very same issue. We haven’t come 
up with an answer in the past 5 years 
because no one has been willing to say 
we have to do less so we can take re-
sponsibility for what we have. We just 
want to do more and not have the ac-
countability. So from 5 years ago to 5 
years later now, to 5 years from now, 
when this bill ‘‘expires,’’ we will still 
have maintenance issues. 
We need to start making hard deci-
sions. Some of those hard decisions 
deal with the budget and making 
choices and saying that there aren’t 
any options to instead saying: There 
are options that I may not like as well 
as the ‘‘just do everything all at once’’ 
option. 
But there are options on how to do 
this, and we should have this debate to 
be able to figure out how to manage 
these dollars better. Maybe we will 5 
years from now. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Arkansas. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, a free 
society depends on the rule of law, 
which is the foundation for public 
order and peace. Police are the indis-
pensable guardians of that law. We 
rightfully honor them for the risks 
they assume every morning when they 
put on the badge and sometimes the 
bulletproof vest, knowing they may 
not come home at night to take them 
off. 
But the police have a sworn duty to 
wield their power with justice. They 
take an oath never to betray their 
character or the public trust. They 
must hold themselves to the highest 
standard and overwhelmingly do so. 
But in the cases when they do not, 
the consequences can be devastating. 
What happened last week to George 
Floyd in Minnesota was horrific. He 
was killed by police officers—dying at 
the hands of men who pledged to pro-
tect and serve their communities. 
I am glad that justice appears to be 
moving swiftly in George Floyd’s case. 
The officers who participated have 
been terminated from the department, 
and the criminal process is well under-
way. 
But this is little consolation to many 
Americans, 
including 
many

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2864 
June 10, 2020 
Americans, who feel they have experi-
enced 
unjust, 
unequal 
interactions 
with law enforcement. Many have pro-
tested peacefully for change in the fin-
est tradition of our country. And in 
sharp contrast to the rioters and 
looters, who have exploited this trag-
edy for their own purposes, we must 
now seek to reveal national unity from 
the wreckage of broken trust and bro-
ken glass on our streets. To do this, we 
will need to be guided by our Nation’s 
noblest principles, while rejecting the 
anti-American suggestions of radicals 
who want a revolution. 
Every American deserves to be treat-
ed equally by their government, as 
guaranteed by our Constitution and 
our country’s most fundamental prin-
ciple that all men are created equal. 
There is no greater bulwark to tyranny 
and injustice than that old, simple 
proposition. But we must reject efforts 
to scapegoat and demonize all police 
for the actions of a few, and we must 
reject radical proposals to dismantle 
and defund police departments, as some 
have suggested. 
These proposals are offered in the 
spirit of revenge that would lead only 
to more crime, more lives lost, and 
more sorrow. The communities that 
would be hit the hardest by the dis-
appearance of police would be the most 
disadvantaged. When police are under-
staffed 
and 
undertrained, 
there 
is 
greater risk of mistakes and mis-
conduct, not to mention higher rates of 
crime. 
By contrast, a well-staffed, well- 
trained, and well-respected force is a 
blessing to its community and a 
scourge to criminals who threaten it. 
Defunding the police would be deadly. 
It isn’t a solution but an insult to good 
officers, and a threat to law-abiding 
citizens. 
Americans are not blind to injustice. 
We all understand the hard work that 
is needed to repair trust in this coun-
try, but defunding the police is not the 
answer. We need the rule of law and 
equal just under law. We need them 
both. 
I urge my colleagues to join with us 
in passing this resolution, which calls 
for justice for George Floyd and other 
victims of excessive use of force, while 
also honoring the law enforcement offi-
cers who keep us safe. 
Therefore, Mr. President, I ask unan-
imous consent that the Senate proceed 
to the immediate consideration of a 
resolution that is at the desk, calling 
for justice for George Floyd and oppos-
ing calls to defund the police. I further 
ask unanimous consent that the reso-
lution be agreed to, the preamble be 
agreed to, and that the motions to re-
consider be considered made and laid 
upon the table with no intervening ac-
tion or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. SCHUMER. Reserving the right 
to object. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader is recognized. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, there 
are millions of people in America 
marching in the streets to reform our 
police practices, to ask for equality, to 
ask for racial justice. 
We have seen in the savage death of 
George Floyd, we have seen with 
Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Eric 
Garner, and in so many other instances 
that our police departments need real 
reform. 
There is a demand of Americans that 
we act—and act soon. The resolution 
my colleague offers is rhetoric, not ac-
tion, and the great worry so many 
Americans have is that so many on the 
other side will feel rhetoric and then 
try to let this go away. 
We demand action, and we demand it 
now—real action, not rhetoric—to re-
form our police departments in a fair 
and comprehensive way. That is what 
the Justice in Policing Act does. We 
need it on the floor now, as soon as the 
House passes it. 
Very few of us believe that Leader 
MCCONNELL will put it on the floor, but 
we want him to. We demand he does. 
Again, the resolution by my friend 
will do nothing—nothing. It is rhetoric. 
We demand action. 
And so in a minute, I will be asking 
unanimous consent that upon receipt 
of H.R. 7120, the Justice in Policing Act 
of 2020, the pending business here in 
the Senate, after it passes the House, 
be that bill, so that we are forced and 
required to debate it. 
And at that point, my friend from 
Arkansas or anyone else can do what-
ever they want, but not in an empty 
field of rhetoric and no action, when 
Americans demand action. 
We need justice. We need racial 
equality. I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Arkansas is recog-
nized. 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, if the 
Senator from New York would like to 
enter into a colloquy, I did not hear an 
objection to a single sentence of that 
resolution, to a clause of that resolu-
tion, to a word in that resolution, 
which calls for justice for George Floyd 
and other victims of excessive force 
and also says that the Senate opposes 
radical ideas to defund the police. 
So if the Senator from New York 
would like to explain to the Senate 
what part of that resolution he opposes 
and why he is objecting, I would wel-
come to hear his answer. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I have 
a resolution at the desk. 
Mr. COTTON. Reclaiming my time, I 
have not yielded the floor. 
So I would just point out this. Let’s 
be clear what just happened here. We 
have a resolution. It is a couple of 
pages long. The Democrats have had it 
for 24 hours. Until just moments ago, 
we had no indication that they planned 
to object or that they had any other 
contrary resolution. 
We have heard objection from the 
Senator from New York not to a single 
word of that resolution itself—a resolu-
tion which, I will say again, calls for 
justice for George Floyd and for all vic-
tims of excessive force, as well as op-
poses radical efforts to defund the po-
lice. 
So I will only conclude that the mi-
nority leader is here to speak on behalf 
of the Democratic Party and defend 
this radical idea to defund the police, 
since he is unwilling to cite what part 
of that resolution he opposes. 
And now, Mr. President, I yield the 
floor. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, as the 
gentleman heard, we need action, not 
rhetoric. That is the objection because 
we believe that too many on that side 
of the aisle will not want to act and, 
therefore, for them to be content with 
rhetoric will not serve any good pur-
pose. 
We can debate all of these issues 
when we have a real bill on the floor 
and we are moving forward to bring 
justice. My resolution does just that. It 
says very simply—very simply—that 
the minute the House passes the Jus-
tice in Policing Act, the pending busi-
ness here in the Senate is that act, so 
we can debate it and we can hopefully 
pass it. Some may choose to modify it 
in whatever way they choose, but rhet-
oric is no substitute for action when 
the American people, overwhelmingly, 
in the streets, peacefully, proudly, 
strongly demand action. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Senate proceed to the im-
mediate consideration of a resolution 
at the desk that would make H.R. 7120, 
the Justice in Policing Act, the pend-
ing business upon receipt from the 
House. I further ask that the resolution 
be agreed to and that the motion to re-
consider be considered made and laid 
upon the table with no intervening ac-
tion or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Arkansas is recog-
nized. 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, reserv-
ing the right to object, I am a bit mys-
tified about what has happened here. 
We had a resolution on the floor, a cou-
ple of pages, calling for justice for 
George Floyd and victims of excessive 
use of force, as well as condemning the 
radical idea of defunding the police. 
Now, the minority leader wants to 
offer a resolution that would imme-
diately make the pending business of 
the Senate—at some distant, specula-
tive time in the future—a piece of leg-
islation which, if I am not mistaken, 
hasn’t even been written and filed yet 
in the House of Representatives. Now, 
maybe it has been written in the last 
day or two and I am not aware that 
they filed that bill, but it certainly 
hasn’t been debated and voted on in the 
House of Representatives. 
There is all the time in the world to 
decide what is going to be the pending 
business in the U.S. Senate when the 
Senate acts, but we have a resolution

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2865 
June 10, 2020 
right in front of us that condemns the 
unjustified killing of George Floyd, 
calls for justice for his death and all 
those victims of excessive use of force, 
and also—since the Senate opposes the 
radical idea—of defunding the police. 
Yet, the Democratic leader, on behalf 
of his party, objected to that without 
citing a single word, a single clause, a 
single sentence that he finds objection-
able. I assume it is because they do, in 
fact, want to defund the police. 
I know he keeps talking about rhet-
oric versus action. I will just remind 
you that the Senate, on almost every 
day we are in business, passes multiple 
resolutions by unanimous consent. If I 
am not mistaken, I think the Demo-
cratic leader was on the floor last week 
trying to pass a resolution condemning 
the President once again. So the idea 
that we don’t pass resolutions express-
ing the sense of the Senate or, for that 
matter, there is a choice between pass-
ing such a resolution and taking action 
is simply foreign to the way the Senate 
acts every single day. 
I will just say again that what we are 
seeing here is the Democratic leader 
apparently objecting on behalf of the 
Democratic Party in defense of the rad-
ical idea that we should defund the po-
lice. I object to the Democratic leader. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
The Democratic leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, the 
gentleman from Arkansas has made my 
point. He talks about business as usual. 
This is not business as usual. The typ-
ical rhetoric, the kind of avoiding ac-
tion which has been so, so endemic in 
this Republican Party is showing itself 
again. If they wanted to act, they could 
have supported our resolution. They 
are trying to avoid it. We will not let 
that happen. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, if the 
Democratic leader, again, would like to 
engage in a colloquy, I will ask him, is 
the bill that he wants to make the im-
mediate pending business of the Senate 
even written in the House of Rep-
resentatives? 
Since he has departed, I guess the an-
swer to my question is, no, that bill is 
not even written and filed in the House 
of Representatives, and certainly it has 
not been voted upon in the House and 
sent to the Senate for us to make it 
the pending business. 
So the objection you just heard, 
again, didn’t object to a single word in 
our resolution, much less a clause or a 
sentence—a resolution that calls for 
justice for George Floyd and the vic-
tims of the excessive use of force, while 
at the same time opposing radical 
Democratic proposals to defund the po-
lice. I can only infer, since I didn’t hear 
a single objection to the language of 
our resolution, that the rub of the mat-
ter is that the Democrats really do 
support defunding the police. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Montana. 
H.R. 1957 
Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, it is an 
honor to stand here today in support of 
one of the most historic pieces of con-
servation legislation in decades—some 
are saying 50 years. 
The Great American Outdoors Act 
will have a lasting impact on genera-
tions to come. That is why, as Mon-
tana’s voice in the Senate, I am stand-
ing here today to make the Great 
American Outdoors Act a reality. 
Over the last few days, we have seen 
very strong bipartisan support both 
here in the Senate and around the Na-
tion. Senators from both sides of the 
aisle, representing States all across our 
great Nation, have been coming down 
to the floor to share stories and photos 
and to show support for the bill. It is a 
very personal piece of legislation be-
cause we all love the outdoors. 
At this point, plenty of us have spo-
ken in support of this bill, but today I 
want to share some quotes from Mon-
tanans who are also in support of the 
Great American Outdoors Act. 
David Brooks from Montana Trout 
Unlimited says: 
As the Senate takes up the legislation this 
week, we are also excited to see progress on 
addressing decades of maintenance backlogs 
on our public lands that benefit our wild and 
native fish and their habitat. 
Speaking of trout, this picture was 
taken at the Yellowstone River. The 
main channel is over here. There is a 
little side channel as well. That is Emi-
grant Peak. That is in a valley called 
Paradise Valley. It is appropriately 
named. It is south of Livingston—be-
tween Livingston and Gardiner. If you 
were to come visit Yellowstone Na-
tional Park, one of the entrances is in 
Gardiner, and that would be on the way 
to Yellowstone Park. 
As I mentioned before, that is, in 
fact, where in 1979 we had our high 
school 
homecoming 
dinner, 
and 
I 
proudly took a date in a Griswold sta-
tion wagon with some couples, and we 
drove down to Chico’s. It is right by 
where this picture was taken. There 
are a lot of memories when I see a pic-
ture like that. There was a lot of fish 
caught as I fished that river many, 
many times. I do it several times a 
summer. 
Ben Horan with Mountain Bike Mis-
soula says: 
There is a good reason the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund has enjoyed bipartisan 
support since the 1960s. It is just good policy. 
For more than 55 years, LWCF has supported 
and funded open spaces and public lands that 
we in Montana rely on for our work, for our 
play, and for our way of life. 
Kyle Weaver from the Rocky Moun-
tain Elk Foundation had this to say: 
This important conservation program al-
lowed the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation 
to complete more than 80 land protection 
and access projects that conserved more 
than 152,000 acres of habitat for elk and other 
wildlife. RMEF strongly urges Members of 
the Senate and House to rally alongside Sen-
ator DAINES, pass this measure, and forward 
it to President Trump’s desk so it can be 
signed into law. 
Land Tawny with the Backcountry 
Hunters and Anglers said this: 
Sportsmen and women have been the lead-
ing voices in this effort to fully fund the 
Land and Water Conservation Fund as well 
as providing maintenance funding for the 
agencies that manage places critical for pub-
lic access and fish and wildlife. Our public 
lands and our waters have traditionally been 
places of refuge, of solace, and of adventure. 
Never has this been truer than right 
now when we need to recenter and get 
our minds right. Now is the most stra-
tegic time for investing in these places 
of 
refuge 
by 
funding 
shovel-ready 
projects that sustain important habi-
tat, increase public access opportuni-
ties, and get people back to work. 
Mayor Bill Cole of Billings said: 
Over the years, Billings has received al-
most $2 million to fund construction repairs 
on our parks. The Great American Outdoors 
Act will be a great help as we plan future 
projects that address the backlog of mainte-
nance needs. Parks and trails are critical to 
our Western quality of life, they attract visi-
tors, and they support our economy. 
The city manager of Great Falls, 
Greg Doyle, said this: 
For many years, the city has utilized the 
LWCF appropriations to complete a wide va-
riety of projects. These projects help support 
and develop park land and recreational fa-
cilities for Great Falls residents and visitors. 
Alex Kitchens with the Mystery 
Ranch. 
The 
Mystery 
Ranch—that 
sounds kind of mysterious, doesn’t it? 
They actually make some of the best 
backpacks in America. In fact, when 
my wife and I and children get out in 
the wilderness area every summer, we 
all 
are 
carrying 
Mystery 
Ranch 
backpacks. They are some of the very 
best. In fact, in the early days of this 
company, back in the seventies when I 
was going to high school in Bozeman, I 
had a Kletterworks pack. Kletterworks 
was the precursor to Mystery Ranch. In 
fact, the book bag that I then took to 
Montana State University and carried 
my books in throughout my college ex-
perience in Bozeman—I took that same 
pack to the top of Granite Peak, our 
highest point in Montana, and the sum-
mit of the Grand Teton, just south of 
Montana there—beautiful country out-
side of Jackson, WY. It was a small 
pack. We went very ultralight with 
bivy bags, kind of a sense of a quick up 
and down because of weather. We want-
ed to get up there quickly on both 
peaks, and we made it. That was the 
precursor to the Mystery Ranch, which 
are the packs we have today. They are 
larger packs. You can carry more 
weight into the backcountry. 
Alex said this: The Great American 
Outdoors Act is landmark conservation 
to protect our public lands. The full 
funding of the LWCF is a benefit to our 
parks and our forests at the local and 
State level. 
We have Glenn Marx with the Mon-
tana Association of Land Trusts. I will 
quote Glenn: 
Passage of the Great American Outdoors 
Act means LWCF funding and tremendous 
rural community, national park, and out-
door recreation economic benefits for Mon-
tana and the nation. More legislative steps 
to go. Let’s finish the journey.

June 10, 2020 
I couldn’t agree more, Glenn. 
Finally, I want to highlight a letter. 
It is a letter signed by every former 
Secretary of the Interior, from Sec-
retary Babbitt, who served in 1993, to 
Montana’s very own Secretary Ryan 
Zinke. 
In fact, Ryan and I were Boy Staters 
together back in 1979. Ryan was a jun-
ior, soon to be a senior, at Whitefish 
High School, and I was a junior, soon 
to be senior, at Boozman High in 1979. 
Little did we know when we were Boy 
Staters then that Ryan, after a distin-
guished military career in the U.S. 
Navy as a Navy SEAL, would go on to 
be our Secretary of the Interior. 
The letter says this: ‘‘The Great 
American Outdoors Act will help en-
sure a better, brighter future for na-
ture and for all of us.’’ 
By the way, if you look at those Sec-
retaries, those are Secretaries who 
served under Democratic Presidents 
and Republican Presidents. 
Needless to say, Montana has its fair 
share of support for the Great Amer-
ican Outdoors Act, and the list of sup-
port goes on. 
Montanans know what it takes to 
conserve their public lands. Ensuring 
full mandatory funding for the Land 
and Water Conservation Fund will 
make sure our public lands are man-
aged correctly and that Montanans and 
Americans around the country will 
have better access to share public 
lands. 
Dealing with the $12 billion mainte-
nance backlog in our national parks 
will be so beneficial for the employees 
who are working so hard in national 
parks. We are seeing record visitation 
levels in many of our parks, but our 
employee housing in many cases is ter-
rible—crumbling infrastructure, waste-
water treatment systems that are in 
desperate need of repair and upgrades. 
That maintenance backlog needs to be 
addressed, and that will improve the 
visitor experience. 
When I think about our national 
parks, I think of these parks as the of-
fice of first impression. For visitors 
who come to our great country from 
around the world, when they visit our 
national parks, they leave with a pro-
found impression. It is what sets Amer-
ica apart from any other country—our 
national parks, our outdoor heritage, 
and preserving and protecting that for 
generations to come. 
The Great American Outdoors Act 
will directly impact everybody who 
visits, who recreates, and who enjoys 
our public lands. This will be truly one 
of those defining moments for con-
servation that so many will remember 
for generations to come. It is one of 
these laws that we will pass, and when 
the President signs it, it will truly be 
a legacy for future generations. It 
makes me smile just knowing that so 
many others will be able to have our 
public lands to enjoy, just as my wife 
and I and my children all have done 
and continue to do, once we pass the 
Great American Outdoors Act. 
Thank you. 
I yield back. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
FREE FILE PROGRAM 
Mr. CARPER. Good afternoon, Mr. 
President and colleagues. I rise today 
to highlight some recent work that we 
have done on the Senate Permanent 
Subcommittee on Investigations that 
could help not hundreds, not thou-
sands, not tens of thousands, not hun-
dreds of thousands, but millions of 
Americans save some money when fil-
ing their Federal income tax returns 
this year and in future years. 
As the ranking member of the sub-
committee called the Permanent Sub-
committee on Investigations in the 
Senate, my staff and I worked closely 
with a fellow named ROB PORTMAN of 
Ohio, who is the chairman of our sub-
committee, and with his team. He put 
us all in a room together—Senator 
PORTMAN’s 
team, 
Republicans; 
our 
team, Democrats—and wonder who is 
who and whose side they are on. You 
wouldn’t know one side from the other. 
It is sort of like the Presiding Officer 
and I working together on recycling 
issues, with his team and mine. 
Senator PORTMAN and I, along with 
our staffs, studied big problems and big 
challenges facing Americans in Amer-
ica. We tried to identify commonsense 
solutions in a truly bipartisan, almost 
nonpartisan approach. That has char-
acterized 
the 
work 
of 
the 
sub-
committee not just for a couple of 
years but for decades. 
For years, I have heard the following 
question over and over again back 
home, and the Presiding Officer prob-
ably has too. People in Delaware and I 
am sure in the Presiding Officer’s State 
asked this question: Why can’t you all 
work together in Washington and get 
something done? That is what we do on 
our Permanent Subcommittee on In-
vestigations. We work together, and I 
think we get a lot done. It is our bread 
and butter. I want to talk for a few 
minutes today about some of the work 
here on the Senate floor. 
Over 
the 
past 
year, 
our 
sub-
committee 
has 
examined 
a 
whole 
bunch of issues, and one of those issues 
is relating to the IRS Free File Pro-
gram. Earlier this week, we released a 
short staff memorandum laying out 
our findings. 
Over the next couple of minutes, I 
want to explain the genesis and the im-
portance of the Free File Program, 
what our subcommittee learned about 
it, and some of the things Congress and 
the IRS could do to improve the pro-
gram and better serve taxpayers. 
I say to the Presiding Officer, I don’t 
know if back in your home State you 
do townhall meetings, but I guess you 
have done a bunch of them. I did a 
bunch of them especially when I was a 
Congressman—hundreds of them—and 
as Governor and even now. 
When I was a Congressman, every 
year we used to—we only have three 
counties in my State. The Presiding 
Officer has a lot more in his. Once 
every year, a month or so before the 
tax-filing deadline, usually March, I 
would host townhall meetings in each 
of our counties, and we would invite 
the IRS to come, along with the State 
Division of Revenue, to participate. We 
would offer to the people of Delaware 
the opportunity to ask questions not 
just of me and my staff but of the IRS 
and the State Division of Revenue 
about tax returns that were being filed. 
It was something I loved. I love helping 
people, and I know the Presiding Offi-
cer does as well. It was a real chance to 
help people in a timely way. 
If you take that idea—and that was 
an idea for, I will say, the 20th century, 
a 20th century idea, and it was a good 
idea. But we have a 21st-century idea, 
and it is called the Free File Program. 
That is what I want to focus on now. 
Some people might be asking: What 
in the heck is the Free File Program 
anyway? Going back to 1998—I was 
Governor then, and I think our Pre-
siding Officer might have been a House 
Member. I am not sure. But Congress 
directed the IRS to work with the tax 
preparation industry to create a way 
for Americans to file their taxes elec-
tronically. 
This is around the time when the 
first version of search engines like 
Yahoo! and Google were being devel-
oped and coming forward. Email ad-
dresses and web portals, like America 
Online, were rapidly expanding the 
availability of internet services not 
just for homes but for schools and 
other places too. Suddenly, it was pos-
sible to do a whole lot of things on the 
internet for the first time, including 
filing our taxes electronically. 
Free File is the program that grew 
out of a mandate Congress issued, and 
taxpayers were first able to take ad-
vantage of the program in 2002. So my 
guess is the mandate from Congress to 
the IRS to make this program avail-
able was about two decades ago, and 
the first time taxpayers were able to 
take advantage of that was a couple of 
years later, in 2002. 
The program is really a partnership 
between the IRS on the one hand and 
tax preparation companies, like H&R 
Block and Intuit, to offer complete and 
free online tax preparation and filing 
services—not to all Americans but to 
most. Sixty percent was the original 
goal, the original target. Today, it is 
available to about 70 percent of all 
Americans. 
This year, most taxpayers earning 
less than $69,000 could use Free File to 
file their taxes for free. That is why we 
call it Free File. I will say that again. 
This year, most taxpayers earning less 
than $69,000 could use Free File to file 
their taxes for free. 
A lot of times, when you hear some-
body offer you something for nothing, 
for free, you say: Well, I am not sure I 
would want to do that. This is one that 
a whole bunch of taxpayers—about 100 
million of them, in fact—can take real 
advantage of because according to the

S2867 
June 10, 2020 
IRS, over 100 million taxpayers are eli-
gible to use this program, Free File. 
Over 100 million taxpayers can file 
their Federal taxes for free. One might 
ask: Well, how do they do that? All 
they have to do is to visit this website 
to get started. The website—I am look-
ing to see where that website is listed. 
I don’t see it here. Maybe it is on the 
back. I don’t think it is back there ei-
ther, but I will just say it. Here it is. 
All they have to do is visit this website 
to get started: IRS.gov/FreeFile. That 
is it. That is a mouthful, isn’t it? That 
is IRS.gov/FreeFile. 
As much as I do it—it is this close. 
There it is: IRS.gov/FreeFile. I am 
blind. There it is. 
To my staff who prepared this for us, 
thank you. 
From there, whoever clicks on this 
address can choose to visit the indi-
vidual Free File website of one of sev-
eral companies offering this service 
and choose the one that works best for 
them. It sounds pretty simple, even to 
me. But only a few million taxpayers 
out of 100 million who are eligible use 
the program every year. Clearly, we 
can do better than this. 
On our subcommittee, we started 
looking into Free File about a year 
ago, after reading news reports alleging 
that some of the companies that par-
ticipated in the program were making 
it harder, not easier, for taxpayers to 
find their Free File websites. This is 
important, colleagues. This is impor-
tant because very few taxpayers go di-
rectly to the IRS.gov address that I 
mentioned 
right 
here—website. 
In-
stead, when most taxpayers are ready 
to file their taxes, they use search en-
gines like Google, and they type in 
phrases like ‘‘free online tax filing’’ or 
‘‘free tax return.’’ For search terms 
like these, Google might return thou-
sands, 
maybe 
millions, 
of 
results. 
Those results could oftentimes be con-
fusing. Imagine that you are trying to 
get some information, and you get 
thousands of ideas from searching on 
Google. That can often be very con-
fusing or just too much for a lot of us 
to try to wade through. 
On top of that, we were able to con-
firm that 5 of the 12 companies that 
participated in the Free File Program 
in tax year 2018, 2 years ago—that in-
cludes H&R Block, Intuit, TaxHawk, 
Drake Software, and TaxSlayer—ap-
parently took steps to actually prevent 
their Free File websites from even ap-
pearing in search results. So when 
someone searched on Google last year 
for free tax help, they were likely to 
land on the website for one of the heav-
ily advertised commercial tax filing 
products. 
Some of those commercial products 
have names that are similar to the 
names companies have given their Free 
File offerings. For example, H&R Block 
has a commercial product called Free 
Online, and Intuit has one called Turbo 
Tax Free Edition. These names sound a 
lot like the names given to the IRS 
Free File products, but they are not 
the same. In fact, there is no guarantee 
that they will actually be free, despite 
their names. 
I want to be clear. There is nothing 
wrong with Free File partner compa-
nies having their own successful com-
mercial products and continuing to in-
novate. There is nothing wrong with 
that. I am told there are legitimate 
reasons someone might want to pre-
vent a website from appearing in a 
Google search result. However, it is im-
portant that we make sure not to con-
fuse taxpayers any more than they 
might already be confused when it 
comes to preparing their tax returns. 
It is also imperative to Senator 
PORTMAN, his staff, and my staff that 
the lowest income taxpayers are able 
to access the free filing services that 
Congress wanted to be sure were avail-
able for them. It is too easy for a tax-
payer to click on a search result that 
looks like a free filing option and wind 
up being charged for extra services 
they didn’t want and, frankly, didn’t 
need. 
In fact, the Treasury Inspector Gen-
eral for Tax Administration estimates 
that more than 14 million taxpayers 
who qualified for the Free File Pro-
gram used commercial software offered 
by a Free File partner company and 
may have paid a fee to file their 2018 
Federal tax return when they did not 
need to do so. Just think about that. 
Fourteen million taxpayers could have 
filed their Federal tax returns com-
pletely free but instead ended up pay-
ing a fee. 
While it is entirely possible that 
some of those 14 million people knew 
they were using a commercial product 
and chose to pay more, many simply 
didn’t know they might have a better 
option. We have an obligation to make 
sure they know about it. Both Congress 
and the IRS need to do more to make 
certain that taxpayers who are eligible 
for a free product and want a free prod-
uct don’t end up paying for something 
they should not have to pay for. It is 
that simple. 
So how did this happen? Well, we 
have learned that part of the blame be-
longs to the IRS, which apparently has 
designated only three full-time em-
ployees—think about that—for how 
many people we have in this country? 
Three hundred-plus million? The IRS 
has designated only three full-time em-
ployees to work on Free File and, I am 
told, has not conducted sufficient over-
sight over the program for years. For 
example, our Subcommittee on Inves-
tigations learned that the IRS has not 
completed a customer satisfaction sur-
vey for the Free File Program since 
2009. That is 11 years. That is right— 
since 2009, even though the Treasury 
Department’s Inspector General for 
Tax 
Administration 
recommended 
greater use of customer satisfaction 
surveys not last year or the year before 
that but as far back as 2007. 
Despite Americans’ growing tendency 
to use search engines like Google to 
navigate the internet, the IRS and its 
Free File partner companies appar-
ently never discussed online search 
practices until very recently. This al-
lowed individual companies to make 
their own choices about how their Free 
File websites could be accessed. 
There is also the fact that the IRS 
has not had a marketing budget for the 
Free File Program in more than 6 
years. When we asked IRS officials to 
explain the lack of marketing, they 
told us a couple of things. Here is one 
of the things we heard. They said: 
‘‘Well, it may have been an IRS budget 
decision as part of the broader reduc-
tion in spending the agency received 
over the last several years.’’ He said 
‘‘as part of the broader reduction in 
spending.’’ Actually, it was the broader 
reduction in appropriations the Agency 
received over the last several years. 
The Treasury Inspector General for 
Tax Administration came to pretty 
much the same conclusion. Here is 
what we got from the Inspector Gen-
eral of the Treasury: The IRS was try-
ing to ‘‘save money and be more effi-
cient.’’ 
Well, we should make sure that we 
save American taxpayers money, no 
doubt, especially at a time when every 
dollar counts for our family and, frank-
ly, for our government. 
With that said, what can Congress 
do? What is our role here in the Senate, 
in the House, in the Congress, and in 
the White House, in the executive 
branch of our government and Treas-
ury? 
As senior members of the Finance 
Committee, Senator PORTMAN
and I 
have listened to former IRS Commis-
sioner John Koskinen, a great leader, 
and to the Government Accountability 
Office led by Gene Dodaro, a wonderful 
Comptroller General. We listened to 
them lament the fact that, for years 
Congress has appropriated the IRS 
with far less money than it needs to 
provide adequate tax enforcement and 
good customer service, as well as to 
better ensure that all Federal tax-
payers are paying their fair share to 
fund our government and meet our 
many obligations. 
Despite a recent bump up in funding 
for the IRS in the past year, since fis-
cal year 2010—so over the last decade— 
funding for the IRS overall has de-
clined by $3.1 billion, after accounting 
for inflation, while the number of indi-
vidual taxpayers has increased by 13 
million. That makes no sense to me. 
My guess is it doesn’t make much 
sense to most people. Let’s listen to 
that again. Funding for the IRS—our 
job is to appropriate money, among 
other things. Funding for the IRS, 
overall, has declined by over $3 billion, 
after accounting for inflation, while 
the number of individual taxpayers 
who need to be served, who have ques-
tions to ask and tax returns to sub-
mit—that number has gone up by 13 
million people. 
These IRS budget cuts have impaired 
both tax enforcement and taxpayer 
service operations. For example, re-
duced funding has led to a reduction in

the number of employees assigned to 
answer telephone calls. The inevitable 
result is fewer taxpayer calls answered, 
longer wait times to get through to the 
IRS representative, and a lot of need-
less frustrations from the people we 
and the IRS are serving, the people 
who have sent us here to work for 
them. 
All of this was before the coronavirus 
pandemic forced the IRS to send thou-
sands of its employees home. 
So as I prepare to wrap up here 
today, let me say to all of our col-
leagues, those who are gathered here 
and those who are not—our colleagues 
both here in the Senate and in the 
House of Representatives at the other 
end of this building—while it is impor-
tant that we ask why the IRS didn’t do 
a better job of overseeing the Free File 
Program and make clear that it must 
do more, it is equally important that 
we in the legislative branch of govern-
ment and in the administration—this 
administration and future administra-
tions—provide the IRS with the tools 
and resources it needs to do the impor-
tant job it does. 
The last time the IRS had a mar-
keting budget for their Free File Pro-
gram, it spent between $750,000 and $1.5 
million marketing the program annu-
ally to, gosh, probably 200—over 100 
million—we will say close to 200 mil-
lion taxpayers. That sounds like a lot 
of money, but when you are talking 
about over 100 million taxpayers, it 
doesn’t go that far. I am not sure that 
is a big enough budget given the large 
number of taxpayers who seem to be 
unaware of Free File. Even a modest 
amount of funding would go a long way 
toward ensuring that millions of eligi-
ble taxpayers do not have to pay a 
dime to file their taxes online. 
Well, colleagues, my staff and my 
other colleagues often hear me say 
these—I think they are called apho-
risms. One of my favorites is, find out 
what works and do more of that. Think 
about it. Find out what works. Do 
more of that. Well, we found out on our 
subcommittee how we can strengthen 
and support this Free File Program. 
Let’s do it. Let’s not just talk about it. 
Let’s not just complain about it. Let’s 
do it. Let’s begin by doing our part to 
provide—this year and in the years 
that follow—the IRS with the re-
sources it needs and, where necessary, 
the additional guidance it needs to 
make Free File work the way we in-
tended it to work almost two decades 
ago. 
Another thing I would like to say is 
that in adversity lies opportunity. 
Think about that. I wish I could claim 
that as my own. That is Einstein. In 
the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, 
the filing deadline for taxpayers has 
been pushed back, as we know, to July 
15—not April 15, a month or a month 
and a half ago, but July 15. Here is 
what that means. It means we have— 
taxpayers have—we have more time to 
get the word out, the IRS has more 
time to get the word out to eligible 
Americans that they can file their 
taxes for free—more time to get the 
word out to eligible Americans that 
they can file their taxes for free. Get 
the word out to whom? To tens of mil-
lions of American taxpayers. 
I want to encourage all eligible tax-
payers to visit IRS.gov/freefile—right 
here—IRS.gov/freefile—to ensure that 
they have access to the free resources 
that are available to them. 
I would also ask everyone to help 
spread the word. Talk to your friends. 
Talk to your family. When you are 
cooped up at home and you can’t go 
anyplace, you are still locked down in 
quarantine, what will you talk about? 
Talk about Free File; say: Here is a 
way we maybe could save some money, 
and our friends could too—instead of 
taking a different course. 
That is it. I will close with this. I 
like movies. I know the Presiding Offi-
cer likes movies. One of my alltime fa-
vorite movies and our colleague who 
has joined us, from Alaska, one of his 
alltime favorite movies—he has talked 
about it many times—is ‘‘Back to the 
Future.’’ This is, in a way, back to the 
future. 
Back when I first got to the House, 
we used to do this—as I said before 
Senator SULLIVAN and Senator CRUZ 
came to the floor—I talked about how 
every year, in every county in Dela-
ware, we would do—there are only 
three counties—we would actually do 
townhall meetings, and we would have 
folks in from the IRS and from the 
State Division of Revenue to actually 
help people prepare and file their taxes. 
We don’t do that anymore. Actually, 
we have something that is even better, 
a whole lot better, and it is this Free 
File Program that the IRS has. It is 
available, if people just knew about it. 
I will close with these words. I wish I 
could claim this as well. I wonder who 
said this. Maybe one of our smart 
pages—if our pages were here, I would 
ask one of the pages to figure it out. 
Have you ever heard the saying: If a 
tree falls in the forest and there is no-
body there to hear it, is there really a 
noise? 
Think about that. If a tree falls in 
the forest and there is nobody there to 
hear it, is there really a noise? Well, if 
we have a great program through the 
IRS to help millions and millions of 
people file their taxes for free and they 
don’t know about it, is there really a 
benefit? I think, arguably, not. We can 
do something about that. Let’s do it. 
I yield the floor to my friend from 
Alaska. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
CRUZ). The Senator from Alaska. 
RACISM 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, there 
is no doubt that there is a lot of anger 
in our country right now. We have seen 
that 
anger 
being 
given 
voice 
all 
throughout our communities and small 
towns and big cities. We have seen it in 
our households, among our families, 
our children, our friends. 
The killing of George Floyd has 
shocked us all. The video of a police of-
ficer 
so 
nonchalantly 
kneeling 
on 
George’s neck as he begged to be re-
leased and three other officers standing 
by as if nothing was happening, as if it 
weren’t a human being’s life being 
taken—this shocked us. 
By now, we all know how George 
Floyd called out, calling out for his 
mother, who had passed years ago, a 
mother who loved him, whom he must 
have seen coming to him in his final 
moments. ‘‘I can’t breathe,’’ he said— 
the last words of a man on a street in 
Minneapolis that have rocked the Na-
tion. They are three simple words that 
mean so much and have so much reso-
nance throughout our history; words 
that, at their very heart, have helped 
to define the moral issue of our coun-
try, and that is slavery and the strug-
gle—the long struggle for civil rights. 
The freedom to breathe and your life 
as your own are what were taken from 
men and women and their children 
when they were ripped from their coun-
tries and brought, in slavery, into this 
Nation. That is what was taken away 
from Native Americans and Alaska Na-
tives when they were forced off their 
lands. 
The freedom to take the full breath 
of life is what is taken away from peo-
ple when they are denied a quality edu-
cation or housing in safe neighbor-
hoods; when they are denied jobs or 
promotions when they get those jobs; 
when they are viewed, because of the 
color of their skin, as less deserving or 
as less able. 
I applaud those who have peacefully 
taken to the streets throughout our 
communities to protest against racism, 
and I also applaud the brave police offi-
cers and National Guardsmen all across 
the country who are protecting those 
who need protecting and reaching out 
to constructively engage peaceful pro-
testers. The vast, vast majority of 
these law enforcement officers are hon-
orable and risk their lives daily for 
their fellow citizens, and we need to re-
member that. 
We are witnessing something that I 
believe is an important moment, one 
that has potential to move our country 
in a direction toward a more perfect 
Union. This moment has promise. 
Senators are discussing with each 
other what kind of legislative action 
should be taken. For example, we had a 
very good discussion on these issues 
just yesterday led by my friend and 
colleague Senator TIM SCOTT of South 
Carolina. State and community leaders 
are also having these discussions. 
Of course, we are a big country, and 
what might seem to be a good idea in 
one place wouldn’t be a good idea in 
some other place. For example, one of 
the enormous challenges in the great 
State of Alaska that I have been fo-
cused on for years is not enough law 
enforcement, particularly in our rural 
and Native communities, dozens of 
which don’t have any law enforcement 
officers at all. So this is a huge prob-
lem in Alaska that can create horrible 
situations, particularly when it comes

to violent crimes like sexual assault 
and domestic violence. 
So I am not a proponent of defunding 
the police, but something else that is 
happening in America right now at this 
moment are discussions—not just in 
the halls of government but around 
dinner tables, among families and par-
ents and their kids and their friend 
groups—on what can or should be done 
at the individual level, the individual 
American level. This is certainly hap-
pening, for example, in my family. 
That was the main point of a power-
ful and wisdom-filled op-ed by my 
former boss, friend, and mentor, Sec-
retary of State Condoleezza Rice last 
week, in the Washington Post. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that this op-ed be printed in the 
RECORD following my remarks. 
It is entitled ‘‘This Moment Cries 
Out for Us to Confront Race in Amer-
ica.’’ Condoleezza Rice was the daugh-
ter of the segregated South, raised in 
Birmingham, AL, during the height of 
the struggle for civil rights, with sit- 
ins, riots, and even bombings hap-
pening in her city. 
When she was 8 years old, the Ku 
Klux Klan bombed a local church in 
Birmingham, killing four school-aged 
girls. 
One 
of 
those 
girls, 
Denise 
McNair, was a friend of Condi’s. They 
used to play dolls together. 
Over five decades later, through hard 
work, grace, dignity, and supreme in-
telligence, she rose to become one of 
the most powerful people in the world 
as Secretary of State of the United 
States, and I had the honor of a life-
time to work for her for 5 years. 
She recounts some of her journey in 
this op-ed, which I encourage all of my 
colleagues and all Americans to read. 
She reminds us: 
Our country has a birth defect: Africans 
and Europeans came to this country to-
gether—but one group was in chains. In 
time, the very Constitution that counted 
slaves as three-fifths of a man became a pow-
erful tool in affording the descendants of 
slaves their basic rights. That work has been 
long and difficult, but it has made a dif-
ference. We are better than we were. 
She notes one harsh indicator of 
progress. In Jim Crow Alabama, in her 
youth, she says: 
[N]o one batted an eye if the police killed 
a black man. There wouldn’t have been even 
a footnote in the local press. 
Yet now we are seeing hundreds of 
thousands across America take to the 
streets peacefully to protest such in-
justice. 
In her piece from last week, she em-
phasizes that finger-pointing at this 
moment will not help the cause: 
And if we are to make progress, let us vow 
to check the language of recrimination at 
the door. 
Very wise words. We all need to focus 
on emphasizing unity and empathy at 
this moment—all of us. Senators, Gov-
ernors, the President, the media—all of 
us have this responsibility, and it is 
what the vast majority of our fellow 
Americans want. It is what they want 
and what they want us to do and to see 
and hear from us. 
Perhaps 
most 
importantly, 
Condoleezza Rice, in her op-ed, empha-
sizes something seemingly so obvious 
but not spoken much: individual action 
and responsibility. She ends her piece 
with this challenge that I put up here 
on the posterboard. It is a really im-
portant challenge for every American: 
So I ask my fellow Americans: What will 
each of you do? My personal passion is edu-
cational opportunity, because it is a partial 
shield against prejudice. It is not a perfect 
shield, I know, but it gives people a fighting 
chance. In my conversations, I want to dis-
cuss why the learning gap for black kids is 
so stubborn and what can be done about it. 
What is your question about the impact of 
race on the lives of Americans? And what 
will you do to find answers? 
Those words in her op-ed—the chal-
lenge—really struck me, and I have 
thought long and hard all week about 
them since reading those words in the 
Washington Post. 
Of course, as a Senator, I, with many 
of you, my colleagues, am taking part 
in discussions which I hope will lead to 
collective action by our Federal Gov-
ernment to address some of the chal-
lenges our Nation certainly continues 
to 
have 
regarding 
race. 
But 
Condoleezza Rice’s question and chal-
lenge is about personal passion and ac-
tion, and it is a question for every 
American to consider. 
I have an amazing Alaska Native wife 
from whom I have learned much about 
the serious issue of racism in my State 
against 
indigenous 
Alaskans 
and 
among the first peoples in our great 
Nation, but I have never experienced 
the kind of racism that many across 
our country have. 
I am a colonel in the Marines, an in-
stitution I am very proud to be a part 
of, an institution that—like the Army, 
Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard—at 
its very heart, it isn’t supposed to mat-
ter what the color of your skin is, what 
religion you practice, or what part of 
the socioeconomic ladder you come 
from. The fundamental ethos of the 
Marine Corps and our military is sup-
posed to be this: It doesn’t matter what 
race you are. You are just a U.S. ma-
rine. 
Now, of course, the Marines and the 
rest of the military don’t always meet 
this ideal, but they strive for it, even 
in ways that might seem puzzling to 
those who haven’t served. 
There is the story of the tough Ma-
rine Corps drill instructor shouting at 
his raw recruits on day one of boot 
camp: 
There is no racial bigotry here. In my eyes, 
every one of you are equally worthless. My 
orders are to weed out all non-hackers who 
cannot serve my beloved Marine Corps. Do 
you maggots understand that? 
That is the drill instructor. Again, it 
is the ideal—equality in the U.S. mili-
tary—but it is not always met. 
I remember how the first rifle pla-
toon I commanded as a young second 
lieutenant was literally about one- 
third White, one-third Black, and one- 
third Hispanic. My platoon sergeant 
was 
an 
African-American 
marine 
named Willis Towns. He was out-
standing 
in 
every 
way, 
Sergeant 
Towns. I learned so much from him 
about leadership. 
His dream in life was to be the first 
African-American sergeant major of 
the entire Marine Corps. He never 
reached that goal. A few weeks after I 
attended a Martin Luther King, Jr., 
ceremony with him in which he re-
ceived an award for his leadership in 
the community, he was killed in a 
training accident. That was the worst 
day of my life. Just a few years later, 
the Marine Corps named another out-
standing African American to be Ser-
geant Major of the entire Marine 
Corps. I remember thinking when the 
announcement came out: Congratula-
tions, Willis. You did it. You did it. 
I believe that the military—deseg-
regated in 1948, nearly 20 years before 
the passage of civil rights legislation 
by this body—is one of the most impor-
tant 
civil 
rights 
organizations 
in 
America. I am passionate about our 
U.S. military, but it can improve in 
terms of race. There are questions that 
need to be asked about the record of 
our military on these important issues. 
Yesterday was an important day in 
the Senate with the unanimous vote to 
confirm Gen. Charles Q. Brown, Jr., to 
be Chief of Staff of the U.S. Air Force. 
For a whole host of reasons, I was prob-
ably more involved in his confirmation 
than any other Senator. I had the op-
portunity to come to the floor yester-
day to speak strongly in support of his 
Senate confirmation. 
I have had many discussions with 
General Brown over the past year, but 
what surprised me was that I learned 
recently that yesterday’s vote was ac-
tually a historic vote for America. His 
confirmation, 98 to 0, was so historic 
because General C. Q. Brown was just 
confirmed yesterday by this body as 
our 
first 
African-American 
service 
chief in the history of the United 
States of America. 
Let me explain a little bit more 
about that. The Joint Chiefs of Staff 
consists of the service chiefs, the top 
four-star generals of the Army, Navy, 
Air Force, Marine, and Coast Guard, as 
well as the Chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs, with the notable exception of 
GEN Colin Powell, who was Chairman 
of the Joint Chiefs in the early 1990s. 
General C. Q. Brown, whom we con-
firmed yesterday, will be the first Afri-
can-American service chief ever for 
any military service. Of course, this is 
good news in terms of racial progress 
for America, but it also begs an impor-
tant question: Why did it take so long 
for this to happen, especially in one of 
America’s institutions with probably 
one of the best, longest records on posi-
tive civil rights in our Nation? 
Some of the answers are surely hint-
ed at in General Brown’s very moving 
video address that he gave last week 
when he talked about what was on his 
mind in the wake of the horrible

George Floyd death. I would rec-
ommend that everybody take a look at 
that. In the Air Force, he says he was 
often the only African American in his 
squadron, and as a senior general offi-
cer, the only African American in the 
entire room. What is he thinking about 
during these challenging times? ‘‘I’m 
thinking about wearing the same flight 
suit with the same wings on my chest 
as my peers and then being questioned 
by another military member, are you a 
pilot?’’ 
What else is he thinking? 
‘‘I’m thinking about my mentors and 
how rarely I had a mentor who looked 
like me.’’ 
‘‘I’m thinking about the pressure I 
felt to perform error-free, especially 
for supervisors I perceived had ex-
pected less of me as an African Amer-
ican.’’ 
He continues saying he was thinking 
about the conversations he was having 
with his sons and the immense respon-
sibility that comes from his historic 
nomination. He was thinking about 
how with this confirmation, he could 
make things better in the Air Force 
and America. 
Here is how I am going to take up 
Condoleezza Rice’s challenge, as she 
put forth for each individual American. 
I am going to ask questions—as she 
prods us to do in this piece—on why, 
until yesterday, no African-American 
four-star had ever been confirmed to be 
a service chief in the U.S. military in 
the history of our country. 
We are introducing an amendment to 
this year’s NDAA to get data on mi-
norities and senior enlisted and officer 
billets in the military—African Ameri-
cans, Alaska Natives, Native Ameri-
cans, Hispanic Americans and others. 
We know these are very patriotic seg-
ments of our population. For example, 
Alaska Natives and American Indians 
serve at higher rates in the military 
than any other ethnic group in the 
country—what I refer to as special pa-
triotism. 
Is this patriotic service reflected at 
the highest leadership ranks of our 
military? If not, then, why not? 
I suspect that a lot of our military 
leaders who have risen to the general 
officers ranks—like General Brown or 
other 
outstanding 
African-American 
generals whom I have gotten to know 
or have the privilege of serving with, 
like 
Army 
GEN 
Vincent 
Brooks, 
former CENTCOM Commander GEN 
Lloyd Austin, and Marine Corps Lt. 
Gen. Ron Bailey—will have insightful 
views on these important matters. 
Our military is something I am very 
passionate about, not only because it 
protects and defends our Nation, but 
because for decades, it has provided 
Americans of all colors and creeds with 
the opportunity to rise up individually 
and as a collective force for good in our 
society and to enable members of the 
military to achieve their full potential 
and have a promising future after their 
service is completed. 
If there is some kind of obstacle for 
minority advancement that stifles op-
portunities at the highest ranks of our 
military, then we need to know why 
and we need to work on addressing it 
together. As a matter of fact, I just 
came from a full day of marking up the 
NDAA with Democratic and Repub-
lican Senators, and we will be trying to 
look at this issue, which we had a great 
discussion on in our markup today. We 
need our military—like we need the 
rest of the country—to be a place 
where everyone who joins can breathe 
freely. This is one of the ways I am 
going to take up Condoleezza Rice’s 
challenge to her fellow Americans— 
this important challenge—and I hope 
my fellow Americans will find their 
own individual ways to do this, as well. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From the Washington Post, June 4, 2020] 
THIS MOMENT CRIES OUT FOR US TO 
CONFRONT RACE IN AMERICA 
Condoleezza Rice was secretary of state 
from 2005 to 2009. She is a professor at Stan-
ford University’s Graduate School of Busi-
ness and a senior fellow on public policy at 
the Hoover Institution, where she will be-
come director on Sept. 1. 
Words cannot dull the pain of George 
Floyd’s family. Like many black families be-
fore them, they find themselves in the spot-
light for reasons that every parent, sibling 
and spouse dreads. While his death has cata-
lyzed a symbolic call to action, he was not a 
symbol to his loved ones—he was a father, 
brother and son. I can only pray that they 
find the ‘‘peace that passes understanding.’’ 
In the wake of Floyd’s death, Americans 
and people around the world are experiencing 
shock, grief, outrage—a set of emotions that 
too often are repeated. If the past is a guide, 
these feelings will fade and we will return to 
our lives. 
But something tells me—not this time. 
Floyd’s horrific death should be enough to fi-
nally move us to positive action. 
Perhaps this is like the moment in 1955 
when Rosa Parks refused to move to the 
back of the bus. Or perhaps this is like that 
fateful Sunday in September 1963, quite per-
sonal to me, when a bomb in a Birmingham 
church killed four girls from my neighbor-
hood and shook our nation to its core. Some 
six decades later, perhaps all of us—regard-
less of skin color—are, to quote Mississippi 
sharecropper and civil rights activist Fannie 
Lou Hamer, ‘‘sick and tired of being sick and 
tired.’’ 
Our country has often moved forward and 
been made better through peaceful protests. 
But our cities must stop burning. Innocent 
people, including many minority and immi-
grant business owners, are watching their 
livelihoods go up in smoke. There is no ex-
cuse for looting and criminality, and offend-
ers must be stopped. But a call for calm is 
not enough, either. This time, we must re-
main vigilant and maintain our determina-
tion to make a difference. 
Beyond justice for Floyd, systemic change 
is necessary to make our institutions more 
just. Yet all the structural reforms in the 
world are insufficient to remove the shadow 
hanging over every incident of this kind. To 
be black is to be forced to overcome implicit 
and explicit reactions to the color of your 
skin. It might be dismissiveness or under-
estimation or presumption of how you think. 
In some circumstances, it might be fear. We 
encounter these responses even among de-
cent people who sincerely do not want to 
react that way. The good news is that these 
emotions can be overcome—and often are— 
with the respect that builds when people 
know one another as human beings—as 
friends, neighbors, co-workers and team-
mates. 
Still, we simply must acknowledge that so-
ciety is not color-blind and probably never 
will be. Progress comes when people treat 
one another with respect, as if we were color- 
blind. Unless and until we are honest that 
race is still an anchor around our country’s 
neck, that shadow will never be lifted. Our 
country has a birth defect: Africans and Eu-
ropeans came to this country together—but 
one group was in chains. In time, the very 
Constitution that counted slaves as three- 
fifths of a man became a powerful tool in af-
fording the descendants of slaves their basic 
rights. That work has been long and dif-
ficult, but it has made a difference. We are 
better than we were. 
I grew up in segregated Jim Crow Ala-
bama, where no one batted an eye if the po-
lice killed a black man. There wouldn’t have 
been even a footnote in the local press. So it 
is a source of pride for me that so many have 
taken to the streets—peacefully—to say that 
they care: that they, too, are sick and tired 
of being sick and tired. Yet protests will 
take our country only so far. The road to 
healing must begin with respectful but hon-
est and deep conversations, not judgments, 
about who we were, who we are and who we 
want to become. Let us talk with, not at, 
each other—in our homes, schools, work-
places and places of worship. And if we are to 
make progress, let us vow to check the lan-
guage of recrimination at the door. As 
united Americans, we can then turn our fears 
into faith, hope, compassion and action. And 
then we can accept and carry out our shared 
responsibility to build ‘‘a more perfect 
union.’’ 
Yet, any call to action will be empty if it 
does not move us to individual responsi-
bility. We all have a role to play in moving 
our country forward, in ensuring that our de-
mocracy delivers not just for those who have 
but also for those who seek and for those in 
need. 
So I ask my fellow Americans: What will 
each of you do? My personal passion is edu-
cational opportunity, because it is a partial 
shield against prejudice. It is not a perfect 
shield, I know, but it gives people a fighting 
chance. In my conversations, I want to dis-
cuss why the learning gap for black kids is 
so stubborn and what can be done about it. 
What is your question about the impact of 
race on the lives of Americans? And what 
will you do to find answers? 
Mr. SULLIVAN. I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I have 
been thinking about the last time I was 
in an airplane. It was mid-March. One 
of the many great things about my 
State is I can drive back and forth in 
the car for 6 hours. The last time I was 
in an airplane was mid-March. That 
day in mid-March, South Korea had 90 
diagnosed cases of coronavirus. On the 
other side of the world, in the United 
States of America, we had 90 cases of 
coronavirus. 
Since then, fewer than 300 South Ko-
reans have died. Their unemployment 
rate is under 4 percent. More than 
110,000 Americans have been killed by 
this virus, and our unemployment rate 
is the worst since the Great Depres-
sion. This isn’t because South Korea 
has 
smarter 
scientists 
or 
because

South Korea has better doctors or be-
cause South Korea has harder workers. 
It is because of leadership. 
Of course, Mr. President, you know 
because you ran against him. You 
know the President is going to deny re-
sponsibility. He is going to point fin-
gers. He is going to blame others. It is 
what he did as a failed businessman. It 
is what he did as a TV celebrity. It is 
what he did as a Presidential candidate 
running against you, and it is what he 
has done as President. It is his whole 
life. He has denied responsibility. He 
pointed fingers. He has blamed others. 
My colleagues all know that the buck 
never stops in this Oval Office. 
But what is disappointing is the 
whisper-in-the-woods silence and feet- 
in-concrete inaction on the part of so 
many of my friends this side of the 
aisle. We know the President’s play-
book is to divide, to distract, to play to 
race, to divide the country and distract 
from his failed leadership. So far, it has 
marginally been ‘‘like President, like 
Senator.’’ 
Yesterday, the President started at-
tacking a private citizen whom he is 
supposed to serve, spreading conspiracy 
theories about a 75-year-old man peace-
fully protesting for change. What was 
my colleagues’ reaction? It was the 
same whisper-in-the-woods silence, the 
same feet-in-concrete inaction, the hid-
ing behind a column, behind a desk, 
hiding behind a post, hiding from the 
media. When the free press tried to ask 
them about it, when one journalist 
even printed out a copy of the Presi-
dent’s statement, some of my col-
leagues physically refused to look at it. 
You might be able to escape to your 
office in this building, but you can’t ig-
nore the people in cities and towns and 
neighborhoods in your State—in all of 
our 
States—who 
are 
demanding 
change. You can’t ignore the people 
whom we serve. I implore my col-
leagues to listen to the calls for 
change. The President may ignore 
them. When he is not dividing, he is ig-
noring what citizens want to do, but we 
can do better in the Senate. We can 
step in to fill that leadership void. We 
can answer those calls for change. We 
can tackle the problems we face as a 
country. 
We can start with the proposed solu-
tions my colleagues and I have intro-
duced to help people get through this 
pandemic. We have a rental assistance 
bill to help people pay their bills and 
stay in their home. Can you imagine 
anything worse than when the unem-
ployment benefit runs out at the end of 
July? 
In the State of Texas, there are twice 
as many. In my State alone, there are 
more than a million people unem-
ployed. They are not all going to get 
called back to work by the end of July. 
If the unemployment benefit stops, as a 
number of people and Senator MCCON-
NELL seem to want it to, there will be 
evictions. There will be a wave of evic-
tions and people losing their apart-
ments. Can you imagine anything more 
ludicrous in the middle of a pandemic 
than that people are put on the streets 
or people are forced to move in with a 
cousin in an already-crowded second 
floor apartment? Do you think that is 
not going to spread this pandemic even 
worse? 
We have to have a rental assistance 
bill. We have a plan to put more money 
in people’s pockets so they can stay 
afloat and keep spending in our com-
munities. We have a plan to actually 
protect workers on the job so they feel 
safe going back to work. 
Yesterday, in committee, the Sec-
retary of Labor told us there have been 
5,000 workplace complaints against em-
ployers by employees saying their 
workplace wasn’t safe. Do you know 
how many citations the Department of 
Labor issued? One. There were 5,000 
complaints and 1 citation. The Depart-
ment of Labor is supposed to rep-
resent—surprise—labor, not corporate 
interests who have corporate leaders 
who have no interest in keeping their 
workplace safe. 
We have a plan to truly scale up test-
ing in this country so we can begin the 
real test-trace-isolate plan we need to 
reopen safely. Leader MCCONNELL, the 
leader of this body, the Republican 
leader—elected, I assume, unanimously 
by his Republican caucus—says he sees 
no urgency. Those are his words. He 
sees no urgency on any of this. 
We also have solutions to begin to fi-
nally tackle systemic racism that puts 
Black and Brown American lives at 
risk. This week my Democratic col-
leagues and I joined Senator BOOKER 
and Senator HARRIS to introduce legis-
lation to make real meaningful re-
forms on how we do policing in this 
country. Americans of both parties 
agree we need to rethink the role of the 
police and how we invest our tax dol-
lars in education, healthcare, and hous-
ing, and so much else. 
I am also introducing a resolution de-
claring racism a public health emer-
gency. Let’s be clear: This pandemic 
and racism in America are not separate 
problems. They are intimately con-
nected. A headline in the Atlantic put 
it well: ‘‘The Coronavirus Was an 
Emergency Until Trump Found Out 
Who Was Dying.’’ 
It is disproportionately Black and 
Brown Americans dying of this virus. 
It is Black and Brown workers who 
have been on the job for months, expos-
ing themselves to the virus so grocery 
stores stay stocked and packages keep 
getting delivered and hospital linens 
keep getting changed. It is Black and 
Brown communities grieving the losses 
of their friends and neighbors. 
Here is what I wish more of my col-
leagues would understand: They are 
our neighbors too. Breonna Taylor was 
our neighbor. George Floyd was our 
neighbor. The 110,000 Americans who 
have died of this virus were our neigh-
bors. 
Some of you expressed words of sym-
pathy. Thank you for that. Some of 
you issued statements saying you want 
to see reform and you will not tolerate 
racism. All of you wish the President 
would stop tweeting. But those words 
aren’t good enough. People are dying. 
Platitudes and press releases don’t get 
us very far. They are not enough. You 
need to put actions behind your words. 
It is time for colleagues to join us to 
pass real solutions. It is time to stand 
up to Leader MCCONNELL and say: Let 
us do our jobs. 
President Trump is not doing his job; 
that is for sure. Leader MCCONNELL is 
not doing his job; that is for sure. It is 
time for all of us in this body to do our 
job. 
It is time to stand up to the Presi-
dent, to use every ounce of leverage we 
all have to stop the racism, to stop the 
division, to stop inciting violence. 
There is a leadership void in this coun-
try. I am waiting for my colleagues to 
join us to fill it. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
CRAMER). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
H.R. 1957 
Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, right 
now we are debating the Great Amer-
ican Outdoors Act, which would be 
great if only it were balanced. My prob-
lem with the Great American Outdoors 
Act is that it spends billions on places 
where we vacation, but the authors of 
the bill would not allow a few million 
to be spent to protect the places where 
we live and we work and we help create 
livelihoods for many. 
There is an amendment that would 
do that that is bipartisan and that 
would not take any money away from 
the billions that the bill is already al-
locating for those places where we va-
cation. 
First, let me kind of make my point. 
Forty-two percent of Americans live in 
a county or parish adjacent to a coast-
line—42 percent. Eighty-five percent of 
Americans live in a coastal State. But 
of the billions that go into the Great 
American Outdoors Act, of those bil-
lions, 50 to close to 60 percent are spent 
in seven States, seven localities, and if 
you exclude Washington, DC, and areas 
around Washington, it is not spent on 
coastal areas. 
We are spending billions on places 
where we go to vacation, but the au-
thors of the bill will not allow millions 
to be spent to protect where we live. 
That is foolish public policy. We should 
be investing in coastal resiliency. 
Now, of course, the irony is, we are 
going to spend billions on the coast. 
Why? We have seen it. Harris County 
flooded—that is Houston; Florida flood-
ed, the panhandle, other parts of Flor-
ida; Puerto Rico; the American Virgin 
Islands; North Carolina; South Caro-
lina; Georgia; Hurricane Sandy in New

those billions on the coast repairing 
damage that could have been prevented 
if we had spent millions now. 
I draw attention to a flood wall, a 
levy, in Terrebonne Parish, LA, which 
was recently completed. So we had a 
high-water event where flooding came 
off the Gulf of Mexico. Ten thousand 
homes were not flooded because that 
flood protection had been erected. Ten 
thousand homes were not flooded. 
All I am asking is for the authors of 
this bill to allow a few million to be 
spent where people live, where people 
work, where people help others earn 
their living, and they can still have 
their billions to spend on the places 
where we vacation. 
I don’t want to minimize the need to 
take care of our national parks. When 
someone speaks of a leaky roof, and if 
you fix it early, then fixing it early 
keeps the damage from getting great-
er—that makes sense. We should find a 
way to pay for it, but it makes sense 
that you would do that. How much 
more so when we are speaking about 
coastal resiliency? 
I was told recently that the Army 
Corps of Engineers wants to build a $3.5 
billion floodgate in Miami to prevent 
Miami from flooding—$3.5 billion. We 
are going to spend billions on the 
coast; it is just a question of whether 
we do it in reaction, or whether we do 
it in kind of ‘‘we have to fear the 
worst,’’ or whether we do it like in 
Terrebonne Parish—building a flood 
wall now so that 10,000 homes don’t 
flood. 
It is my disappointment that the au-
thors of this legislation will not allow 
this bipartisan amendment to be added. 
By the way, we have heard that 
Democrats are OK with the amend-
ment, but for whatever reason, the au-
thors will not allow it. 
Let me show you one other thing, 
just to make the point. The Great 
American Outdoors Act actually has 
two pots of dollars, if you will. One is 
for deferred maintenance—again, 50 to 
60 percent of that goes to seven States. 
But this shows where the Land and 
Water Conversation money goes. 
These are the coastal States. This is 
where people live, and these States, on 
average, per capita, get $7.53 from the 
Land and Water Conservation Fund. 
These blue States in the interior—some 
of them populated, some of them not— 
on average get $17.66 per capita. We are 
sending money to where people don’t 
live to fix vacation spots, which are 
important, but it is not where we live, 
and we are not spending money where 
people do live, where their homes are, 
where their cities are, and where, if we 
don’t enhance resiliency, we are going 
to spend billions when the hurricane 
hits. This is foolish public policy. 
By the way, some of my fiscal con-
servative colleagues—and I consider 
myself 
a 
fiscal 
conservative—have 
weighed in against the Great American 
Outdoors Act, saying that we are not 
paying for it; we are pretending to pay 
for it. We are taking dollars that would 
otherwise go to the Treasury—other-
wise go to the Treasury—and pre-
tending like they are new dollars. That 
is actually true. But what we can also 
say is that if we add the amendment, 
the Coastal Act, which I worked on 
with Senator SHELDON WHITEHOUSE—he 
has been a great partner to work 
with—we actually would be paying for 
it. We would be paying for it by putting 
in the coastal resiliency that will pre-
vent the future billions from having to 
be paid to pick up the pieces after a 
hurricane hits a populated area. 
I will speak again on the floor tomor-
row, but I just want to make the point 
that the Great American Outdoors Act 
spends billions where we vacation, fix-
ing things that we don’t wish to get 
worse. The Coastal Act does not take 
away from these billions—these bil-
lions that are spent on places where we 
vacation; these billions spent where 
people do not live—it just spends mil-
lions, a paltry few million trying to 
add resiliency to where we do live, to 
where we do work, to where we do cre-
ate livelihoods not just for ourselves 
but for others, and that is a fiscally 
sound, fiscally conservative way to 
spend dollars. That would save Treas-
ury money, and it would save lives and 
maybe give people a little extra money 
to spend in these parks we are spending 
billions to fix up. 
Mr. President, I thank you, and I

TRIBUTE TO DR. BRIAN MONAHAN 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, under 
normal circumstances, thousands of 
visitors, 
staff, 
and 
members 
file 
through the United States Capitol and 
Senate and House offices every day. As 
we slowly begin to reopen our econ-
omy, 
businesses, 
and 
other 
public 
places, all eyes on Capitol Hill turn to 
the guidance and counsel of Dr. Brian 
Monahan, the attending physician of 
the U.S. Congress and Supreme Court. 
Since 2009, when he joined us in the 
Capitol, Dr. Monahan has been a trust-
ed voice of reason and an exceptional 
healthcare provider to me and hun-
dreds of other lawmakers. 
Dr. Monahan is an accomplished phy-
sician and rear admiral of the U.S. 
Navy. He began his career as a public 
servant after college, when he joined 
the Navy as a member of the Health 
Professions Scholarship Program. In 
1989, while working as a resident at the 
National Naval Medical Center, Dr. 
Monahan discovered a connection be-
tween cardiac arrhythmias and the 
antihistamine, Seldane, a discovery 
that lead to the removal of the drug 
from the market. Dr. Monahan has 
spent years working in the attending 
physician’s office, as a staff physician 
and later as the assistant attending 
physician. Dr. Monahan has also served 
as the chairman of the Department of 
Medicine at the Uniformed Services 
University of Health Services and has 
taught at the university as a professor 
of pathology and medicine focusing on 
cancer, oncology, and hematology. Dr. 
Monahan’s many achievements, med-
ical expertise, and decades of public 
service make him an asset to the Cap-
itol and an invaluable colleague. 
Dr. Monahan has played a particu-
larly important role lately, as both the 
Senate and the House of Representa-
tives work to strike a balance between 
limiting exposure to a pandemic and 
continuing to work for the American 
people. Dr. Monahan has provided re-
markable guidance to House and Sen-
ate leaders on how to safely conduct 
business and operate in the Capitol. 
Moving forward, as we continue to deal 
with the COVID–19 pandemic’s eco-
nomic and public health consequences, 
I am grateful to have Dr. Monahan to 
guide us along the way. 
Dr. Monahan is an accomplished pho-
tographer, and I have had the privilege 
of seeing many of his photographs and 
being with him in different parts of the 
world when he has taken some. All 
make one seeing them wish they were 
there. The reality but especially the 
artistry of his photographs are wonder-
ful. Visits to his office are healthy and 
healing in so many ways. 
Dr. Monahan was recently profiled in 
The New York Times, and I ask unani-
mous consent that the article, ‘‘Doctor 
to Congress and Supreme Court Toils 
to Sidestep Politics amid Pandemic,’’ 
be printed in the RECORD.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2874 
June 10, 2020 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From the New York Times, May 16, 2020] 
DOCTOR TO CONGRESS AND SUPREME COURT 
TOILS TO SIDESTEP POLITICS AMID PANDEMIC 
DR. BRIAN P. MONAHAN HAS FOUND HIMSELF IN 
THE MIDDLE OF POLITICIZED DEBATES OVER 
HOW QUICKLY TO REOPEN THE COUNTRY AND 
WHO SHOULD BE TESTING FOR COVID–19 
(By Emily Cochrane) 
WASHINGTON.—When Senator John Bar-
rasso, Republican of Wyoming, sought guid-
ance on how to protect his family, including 
his 94-year-old father-in-law, when he re-
turned home from the nation’s capital amid 
the coronavirus pandemic, a doctor offered 
him some blunt advice. 
Don’t go home just yet, Dr. Brian P. 
Monahan, the attending physician of Con-
gress, told Mr. Barrasso, directing him to 
quarantine for 14 days before rejoining his 
family. ‘‘You’re a visitor,’’ Dr. Monahan 
said. 
But when House Democratic leaders want-
ed counsel on whether they could safely re-
convene in the Capitol with Covid–19 still 
spreading—a debate with political dimen-
sions as a partisan divide was emerging 
across the country over how quickly to re-
open—Dr. Monahan was less absolute. Re-
turning to Washington carried health risks 
he would not recommend taking, he told 
Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Rep-
resentative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the 
majority leader. But it was up to them to de-
cide what to do. 
They opted to delay their return, and on 
Friday, partly because of Dr. Monahan’s 
warnings, moved forward with plans to insti-
tute remote voting in the future. 
It was typical of Dr. Monahan, the 59-year- 
old Navy rear admiral who is known in the 
halls of the Capitol as much for his meticu-
lous attention to medical detail as he is for 
his efforts to stay completely out of politics. 
‘‘He is both an executive with lots of 
health 
care 
responsibilities—particularly 
now—and also has the unique relationship 
with members that a small-town doctor 
would have with the patients he knows and 
sees,’’ said Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of 
Missouri and chairman of the Senate Rules 
Committee. ‘‘He’s in a unique role at a 
unique time.’’ 
As government doctors have emerged as 
trusted public voices and political figures in 
the face of a fearsome pandemic—appearing 
in White House news conferences and as wit-
nesses at marquee hearings—Dr. Monahan 
has maintained an uncommonly low profile. 
He never issued a public statement offering 
his opinion on whether Congress should re-
convene, although he shared his warnings 
with House leaders and privately told senior 
Republican officials that his office did not 
have the capacity to screen all 100 senators 
for the coronavirus when they returned to 
work. When Alex M. Azar II, the health sec-
retary, said he would send 1,000 tests to Cap-
itol Hill to accommodate them, Ms. Pelosi 
and Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of 
Kentucky and the majority leader, turned 
down the offer, wary of the optics of receiv-
ing special treatment at a time when testing 
was scarce—and prompting President Trump 
to suggest on Twitter that ‘‘maybe you need 
a new Doctor over there.’’ 
Dr. Monahan, who declined to be inter-
viewed, has been a calm and professional 
voice of reason during the pandemic, accord-
ing to interviews with more than two dozen 
lawmakers, Capitol officials and medical 
professionals who know him. They say he 
has taken a personal interest in his influen-
tial clientele, which also includes the nine 
Supreme Court justices, even as he fields po-
litically charged questions about reopening, 
testing and precautionary measures. 
Operating out of a nondescript clinic 
tucked away in the heart of the Capitol, Dr. 
Monahan and a small staff have been exceed-
ingly busy since the pandemic took hold, 
consulting with lawmakers who have con-
tracted Covid–19 or exposed to someone in-
fected with it, doling out health rec-
ommendations in detailed memos ahead of 
votes, and producing a series of videos re-
leased on an internal website to educate law-
makers and their staff on how to protect 
themselves. 
Dr. Monahan has filmed and produced the 
videos by himself in his office, often seated 
next to an elaborate bouquet of white flow-
ers and a tiny plastic model of a pangolin, 
the scaly mammal that may have been an 
intermediary carrier of the virus. 
In the videos, he typically walks through 
the most recent recommendations offered by 
the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion and demonstrates medical equipment, 
such as a thermometer and a variety of 
masks (including one made by his wife, using 
a black shopping bag and a sewing machine). 
‘‘He has a big job—two houses of Congress, 
two parties to deal with—but he’s not polit-
ical in any way,’’ Ms. Pelosi said. ‘‘He treats 
us all with respect, and we respect his judg-
ment in return.’’ 
Dr. Monahan in 2009 became the seventh 
man to serve as attending physician, taking 
up a position that has always been held by a 
Navy doctor. The House first approved a 
Navy officer to work out of the Democratic 
cloakroom in 1928 after one lawmaker died 
and two collapsed, with several hours pass-
ing before a doctor could arrive in each case. 
Two years later, the Senate extended that 
doctor’s jurisdiction to include its own mem-
bers, leading to the establishment of the Of-
fice of the Attending Physician. 
The office provides care to lawmakers for a 
fee, as well as offering some services and 
emergency care to staff and tourists. The 
first physician, Dr. George W. Calver, who 
began his work just before the start of the 
Great Depression, displayed placards in 
cloakrooms and elevators across the Capitol 
with his nine ‘‘Commandments of Health,’’ 
including ‘‘Accept Inevitables (don’t worry)’’ 
and ‘‘Relax Completely.’’ 
Dr. Monahan was born in Connecticut, the 
son of Irish immigrants who came to the 
United States in the 1950s. His mother grew 
up in Kilkee, while his father grew up in a 
house with a thatched roof without running 
water or electricity in Lissycasey. The first 
in his family to attend college, he worked 
full-time at a supermarket while commuting 
in a yellow Volkswagen Beetle to Fairfield 
University, a Jesuit college—an education, 
he would tell graduates in 2011, that meant, 
‘‘you are called to be ‘men and women for 
others.’ ’’ 
He studied biology and chemistry, and 
after graduating, joined the Navy through 
its Health Professions Scholarship Program, 
enticed in part by the offer of free tuition 
and a living allowance in exchange for a 
commitment to three years of service. 
‘‘Brian was always the smartest kid in the 
class,’’ said Dr. William Dahut, a medical 
oncologist who spent time with him in both 
medical school and the Navy. ‘‘If there was a 
publication or data, Brian knew that data 
and knew that well.’’ 
In 1989, as a resident in the cardiology 
ward in what was then the National Naval 
Medical Center in Bethesda, Md., he treated 
a 39-year-old woman for potentially fatal 
cardiac arrhythmias. The patient had taken 
the popular antihistamine Seldane, and his 
contribution to research on that medicine— 
and its connection to the arrhythmias—later 
helped lead to its removal from the market. 
Dr. Monahan rose through the ranks of the 
Navy, becoming a professor of medicine and 
pathology at the Uniformed Services Univer-
sity of the Health Sciences in Maryland, as 
well as participating in a number of national 
organizations related to cancer, oncology 
and hematology. 
While serving as the Chairman of the De-
partment of Medicine at the university, he 
received a call for a meeting in which offi-
cials with congressional leadership asked 
him to become the attending physician on 
Capitol Hill when his predecessor retired. 
He has since become a fixture on Capitol 
Hill, participating in congressional trips and 
functions and releasing health assessments 
for presidential and vice-presidential con-
tenders, including Senators Bernie Sanders, 
the Vermont independent, and Tim Kaine, 
Democrat of Virginia. (Mr. Kaine also asked 
him for ‘‘a tuneup’’ before hiking the Vir-
ginia section of the Appalachian Trail.) 
In 2016, it was Dr. Monahan’s assessment of 
Justice Antonin Scalia’s health at the time 
of his death—including sleep apnea, coronary 
artery disease, obesity and diabetes—that in-
fluenced the decision to decline an autopsy 
of the justice, The Associated Press reported 
at the time. 
‘‘He was the one who advised me to go to 
the 
hospital,’’ 
said 
Representative 
Ben 
McAdams, Democrat of Utah and one of the 
first lawmakers to contract the virus, said of 
Dr. Monahan. ‘‘He was clear: ‘I strongly rec-
ommend you go to the hospital—this is seri-
ous.’ ’’ 
The congressman has spoken with the doc-
tor at least a dozen times since, he said in an 
interview on Thursday—but had yet to meet 
Dr. Monahan in person. 
An avid photographer, Dr. Monahan’s 
photos are present in offices around the Cap-
itol—and he has been known to offer advice 
on how to best capture a scenic landmark or 
vista on trips overseas. 
He checks in with his powerful patients 
frequently, including long after they have re-
covered. 
‘‘I’ve been around for a long period of time, 
and he just takes more of a personal interest 
than anyone else I’ve ever known in that po-
sition,’’ said Senator James M. Inhofe, Re-
publican of Oklahoma and chairman of the 
Senate Armed Services Committee, who has 
been on Capitol Hill for more than three dec-
ades. ‘‘He just seems to be genuinely inter-
ested in me—and he’s that way with every-
body.’’

VERMONT STATE OF THE UNION 
ESSAY WINNERS 
∑ Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, since 
2010 I have sponsored a State of the 
Union essay contest for Vermont high 
school students. This contest gives stu-
dents in my State the opportunity to 
articulate what issues they would 
prioritize if they were President of the 
United States. 
This is the contest’s 10th year, and I 
would like to congratulate the 536 stu-
dents who participated. It is truly 
heartening to see so many young peo-
ple engaged in finding solutions for the 
problems that face our country. To my 
mind, this is what democracy is all 
about. 
A volunteer panel of Vermont teach-
ers reviewed the essays, and chose Isa-
belle Hiller as this year’s winner. Isa-
belle, a junior at Woodstock Union 
High School, wrote about reforming 
our 
incarceration 
system. 
Lucas 
Whitaker, a sophomore at Hazen Union 
High School, was the second place win-
ner. Lucas wrote about youth suicide 
and the need for comprehensive mental 
health care. Maya Marcy, a junior at 
Long Trail School, was the third place 
winner, with an essay on the cost of 
college. 
I am very proud to enter into the 
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD the essays sub-
mitted by Isabelle, Lucas and Maya: 
WINNER, ISABELLE HILLER, WOODSTOCK UNION 
HIGH SCHOOL, JUNIOR, EDUCATION IN INCAR-
CERATION 
Our country’s federal prison system is 
stuck in an ethical rut. We seem to focus on 
securing institutions and confining offenders 
like savage dogs in a pound to ‘‘protect the 
public,’’ and disregard the fact that 44,000 
prisoners return to society each year. The 
Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) claims that 
public safety is the goal of detention, but 
without any mental shift in convicts, all we 
do is press pause on their potential harm to 
society until their release. Currently, we 
have one of the highest prison populations in 
the world. Unless we plan to incarcerate all 
convicts for life, our approach to detainment 
should shift from ‘prison’ to ‘rehabilitation’, 
focusing on equipping prisoners with the 
skills to be mentally stable and financially 
and lawfully successful. 
To do so, all prisoners should not only have 
access to academic resources, but be re-
quired to attend a set number of courses 
each year. Just a few decades ago, Finland 
had one of the highest imprisonment rates in 
Europe. Because of this, researchers started 
investigating its cause. They concluded that 
punishment does not help reduce crime. As a 
result, Finland began ‘decarceration,’ which 
was better for the prisoners and crime rates 
didn’t increase. Without teaching prisoners 
skills or continuing their education, we 
merely take them out of their lives and 
throw them back with no change, and no 
basis to be stable in any realm. 
In the United States, prisoners have a 
higher likelihood of returning to illegal mar-
kets and returning to prison. As of October 
2017, the BOP found that only 32 percent of 
the entire designated inmate population was 
enrolled in one or more education or recre-
ation programs. Furthermore, participation 
decreases 16 percent in the recidivism popu-
lation. The only academic requirement in 
our federal prison system is that inmates 
without a high school diploma or a General 
Education Development have to enroll in a 
literacy program, and need to be successful 
for good conduct time. However, even for 
this requirement alone, there is a stoppage 
to access the program due to overflow of 
over 16,000 inmates—that’s a lot of potential 
students. Plus, although mock job and re-
sume builder courses are offered, inmates do 
not take advantage of them-even with the 
knowledge that occupational training pro-
gram participants are 33 percent less likely 
to recidivate. 
By increasing funding of education, we en-
sure equal accessibility to all courses for 
those 16,000 or more inmates wanting to take 
courses. Consequently the recidivism rate 
will reduce, decreasing our total prison popu-
lation, and lower the overall government 
spending on imprisonment as a whole. By 
treating inmates like humans in their time 
of rehabilitation, with a lower recidivism 
rate, we more confidently ensure public safe-
ty when 44,000 convicts are released each 
year, strengthening the Department of Jus-
tice’s prison system core ideologies. Al-
though we have the right end goal, we need 
to rethink the process by which we get there 
for the sake of the public’s safety and secu-
rity. 
SECOND PLACE, LUCAS WHITAKER, HAZEN UNION 
HIGH SCHOOL, SOPHOMORE 
One of the biggest issues in America’s soci-
ety today is the mental health crisis in our 
youth, relating back to the lack of mental 
health services in our schools. In many 
cases, this leads to preventable death by sui-
cide. According to a 2017 study by the Amer-
ican Foundation for Suicide Prevention 
(AFSP), suicide is the 10th leading cause of 
death in the U.S. 
Paula Clayton, medical director of AFSP, 
states that 90% of youth that kill themselves 
have a treatable psychiatric disorder. She 
explains that even in suicide clusters, there’s 
almost 
always 
an 
underlying 
disorder, 
whether it’s due to at-home issues or any-
thing else that may be going on, suicide is 
the last straw. From this information we can 
gather that mental health is a big part of 
losing students to suicide. There are several 
steps that can be taken to ensure that our 
youth are getting the help they need. 
First of all, mental health professionals on 
campus is a priority. If funds are an issue, as 
they usually are, fundraisers are always an 
option. Schools tend to raise funds for their 
athletic and music departments, as well as 
others, but typically not for mental health. 
Money can be raised in fundraisers not un-
like the ones that are used to raise money 
for extracurricular activities. This way men-
tal health professionals can be on campus for 
students to speak with at any time, and hav-
ing the money for this wouldn’t be such an 
issue. Fundraising aside, mental health serv-
ices are important enough to be state/gov-
ernment-funded. 
Another step that can be taken is the 
steady normalization of mental health dis-
cussions. In society today as a whole mental 
health is a touchy topic. But with proper ap-
proach, these conversations can be normal-
ized so that people are comfortable asking 
for help without being faced with stereotypes 
or fear of judgment. This can start with gen-
eral annual assemblies about the topic and 
good coverage of the topic in classes. Even a 
unit in health classes or professionals com-
ing in to speak with students on the subject 
for a few days can be beneficial. 
In a lot of cases, a student will end their 
life and it will result in suicide clusters, or 
what is more commonly known as ‘copycat 
suicides’. It’s like a trigger that sets off a 
line of students attempting suicide after an-
other student succeeds. If there is ever a sit-
uation in a community where someone ends 
their 
life, 
schoolwide 
mental 
health 
screenings are crucial. There are many non- 
profit organizations that offer screening kits 
that ultimately lower suicide rates. These 
kits usually include short, non-diagnostic 
screens for signs of depression and suicide 
that could even be beneficial as an annual 
subject. These are usually completely anony-
mous and encourage students to seek help. 
Mental health issues are undoubtedly cru-
cial in our youth today. There are several 
ways we as a country can improve the qual-
ity of mental health services in our schools 
for a brighter future for our generation. 
THIRD PLACE, MAYA MARCY, LONG TRAIL 
SCHOOL, JUNIOR 
For many, college is a liberating oppor-
tunity to further one’s academic career and 
pursue a lifelong passion, as well as create a 
substantial base to obtain an income and 
begin life in adulthood. As well, with the in-
creasingly competitive workforce, a college 
degree is almost mandatory to make a living 
wage. However, accessibility to attend a 
post-high school institution continues to 
prove difficult for not only marginalized 
groups, but also students coming from the 
middle class. This difficulty arises from the 
injustice embedded within the education sys-
tem, a lack of government responsibility, 
and the senseless and excessive cost attrib-
uted to college in the present day. 
According to the National Center for Edu-
cation Statistics, undergraduate enrollment 
in any post-secondary educational institu-
tion has increased from 53% to 94% in just 
the past 40 years. Accompanying the growth 
in attendance is the skyrocketing of tuition, 
a near 260% overall increase compared to a 
120% average inflation consumer product in-
crease, according to Business Insider. With 
this disparity in tuition cost vs. income, the 
difference has resulted in the form of $1.5 
trillion of student debt among more than 40 
million Americans, as reported by TIME. 
With this, why is so little of the federal 
budget set aside for such a vital part of our 
society? There is a simple solution. There is 
no reason, that in a time of peace, The 
United States should be spending upwards of 
$690 billion per year on the military. Accord-
ing to the annual fiscal Department of De-
fense budget report, in the most recent pro-
posal to Congress, President Donald Trump 
has introduced an almost 10% increase in 
military spending, increasing the budget to 
an astonishing $750 billion. To put facts 
along with numbers, with a little over 10% of 
the entirety of the military spending budg-
et—approximately $80 billion—the United 
States could cover the cost of public 4–year 
college education for every aspiring student 
in the country. Putting this plan into action

would provide an opportunity for millions of 
deserving, hardworking students. 
The opportunity to obtain an education is 
one that many in the United States take for 
granted. We are fortunate enough in the 
United States to have many of the most dis-
tinguished Universities, programs, and pro-
fessors in the world. However, the inability 
to acknowledge and tackle the underlying 
factors of how economic disparity affects the 
education system remains apparent. Too 
often marginalized groups are kept from suc-
ceeding in comparison to their privileged 
peers. Wealth and the quality of schooling 
have collided for too long. Every young adult 
has the right to a deserving and fulfilling 
academic career, regardless of their upbring-
ing. We must realize now that the only way 
to fix the education system is to approach it 
as an economic matter. From then on, we 
will achieve equity and prosperity through 
the American college system.∑

PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS 
The following petitions and memo-
rials were laid before the Senate and 
were referred or ordered to lie on the 
table as indicated: 
POM–202. A concurrent resolution adopted 
by the Senate of the State of Louisiana rec-
ognizing Tuesday, April 7, 2020, as the first 
annual ‘‘World Trade Day’’ at the state cap-
itol; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, 
and Urban Affairs. 
SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 18 
Whereas, Louisiana is home to the world’s 
first World Trade Center, which originated 
as the ‘‘International House’’ in New Orleans 
more than seventy-five years ago in 1943, and 
has since inspired a global network of over 
three hundred world trade centers in more 
than one hundred countries; and 
Whereas, the World Trade Center of New 
Orleans, a nonprofit organization, is com-
mitted to fostering economic development 
throughout the state of Louisiana by advo-
cating for international trade objectives that 
bolster efficiencies, opportunities, and inno-
vations for commerce; and 
Whereas, having increased exports by 
sixty-one percent from 2008 to 2018, Lou-
isiana is the fifth largest state exporter of 
goods in the United States, and Louisiana 
exports currently account for more than one 
quarter of the state’s total economic output; 
and 
Whereas, the latest available data from the 
United States Trade Representative shows 
that Louisiana exports support an estimated 
129,000 jobs and that such jobs pay up to 18 
percent above the national average; and 
Whereas, Louisiana produces the majority 
of U.S. LNG exported globally, and according 
to LSU’s Center for Energy Studies, Lou-
isiana LNG projects could total nearly $100 
billion in capital investment and add 20,000 
new construction jobs and 1,500 new full-time 
jobs at Louisiana terminals once completed; 
and 
Whereas, key economic-driving and job- 
creating industries in the state, including 
aerospace, agribusiness, automotive, energy, 
manufacturing, and process industries, rely 
on international commerce; and 
Whereas, Louisiana’s geographical posi-
tioning allows the state to take unique ad-
vantage of the Mississippi River to enhance 
competitiveness in global trade, making cur-
rent and future investment in the infrastruc-
ture of the Mississippi essential to continued 
commercial success; and 
Whereas, Louisiana ports are among the 
highest-performing in the country, with the 
following 
ports 
designated 
as 
national 
‘‘power ports’’: Port of South Louisiana (No. 
1), Port of New Orleans (No. 4), Port of Baton 
Rouge (No. 8), Plaquemines Port (No. 11), and 
Port of Lake Charles (No. 12); and 
Whereas, Louisiana has the tactical advan-
tage of being the only state with a deepwater 
port (Port of New Orleans) served by six of 
the seven Class I railroads, which comprise a 
132,000 plus mile network of track and tie the 
port community and local industries directly 
to every major North American market; and 
Whereas, the world recognizes Louisiana as 
a key trade and investment destination for 
international companies, with the state at-
tracting more foreign direct investment per 
capita than any other since 2008; and 
Whereas, the state of Louisiana formally 
acknowledged the essential role of trade in 
2012 by establishing the Louisiana Board of 
International Commerce to advance the 
state’s competitive position in the global 
marketplace through continued attraction of 
foreign and domestic investment and en-
hancement of the state’s trade-based econ-
omy; Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana 
does hereby recognize Tuesday, April 7, 2020, 
as ‘‘World Trade Day’’ at the state capitol, 
celebrates the longstanding, indispensable 
influence of international commerce on Lou-
isiana’s 
economic 
health, 
vitality, 
and 
growth, and expresses support for the mis-
sion of the World Trade Center of New Orle-
ans and for trade policies that benefit Amer-
ican consumers and businesses and ensure 
the United States remains competitive in 
global commerce; and be it further 
Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be 
transmitted to the secretary of the United 
States Senate, the clerk of the United States 
House of Representatives, each member of

to the Committee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 613 
Whereas a free society depends on the rule 
of law, which is the foundation for the pres-
ervation of public order, peace, and indi-
vidual rights; 
Whereas the United States has a troubled 
history of racism that includes slavery, the 
terror of lynch mobs, segregation, and Jim 
Crow, and that history leaves the United 
States with important work to accomplish; 
Whereas the just and unbiased enforcement 
of the rule of law and the protection of inno-
cent individuals against lawbreakers is the 
essential function of government at the 
local, State, and Federal levels; 
Whereas the law enforcement profession is 
inherently dangerous, and police officers 
risk their lives every day; 
Whereas, in 2019, 89 Federal, State, local, 
and Tribal law enforcement officers were 
killed in the line of duty; 
Whereas law enforcement officers are en-
trusted by the public to uphold the law; 
Whereas law enforcement officers who 
abuse their positions, engage in corruption, 
employ excessive force, or exhibit bias be-
tray the public trust and undermine the rule 
of law; 
Whereas the killing of George Floyd on 
May 25, 2020, at the hands of law enforcement 
was a horrific act that violated the public 
trust and was inconsistent with the values 
and conduct expected of law enforcement of-
ficers; 
Whereas the law enforcement officers in-
volved in the killing of George Floyd have 
been terminated from their positions and 
charged with crimes relating to their con-
duct and their contribution to the death of 
George Floyd; 
Whereas good law enforcement cannot 
exist without accountability and justice; 
Whereas understaffed police departments 
and undertrained police officers increase the 
risk of encounters that result in the use of 
force, including unjustifiable or excessive 
force; and 
Whereas defunding the police would leave 
police departments understaffed and under-
trained, while also increasing the risk of vio-
lent crime to the communities of the United 
States, especially vulnerable communities:
