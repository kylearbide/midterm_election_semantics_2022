PRAYER 
Reverend Stephanie Vader, Capitol 
Hill United Methodist Church, Wash-
ington, D.C., offered the following 
prayer: 
God of all creation, who cannot be 
contained by our boundaries or our 
definitions, You are present in every 
place, in every moment in history. You 
are here and now. 
Restore us anew to the vision of our 
forebearers who committed themselves 
to a vision of one Nation under God, 
with liberty and justice for all. We con-
fess in this sacred Chamber of decision-
making that we have not realized that 
vision. 
This weekend as we remember and 
honor those who father us and cele-
brate Juneteenth, the oldest known 
celebration commemorating the end of 
enslavement in the United States, we 
think of our ancestors. 
Where our ancestors failed to work 
for liberty and justice for all and con-
tributed to oppression and harm, we la-
ment. 
Where our ancestors struggled to 
work for liberty and justice for all, we 
give thanks. 
Restore anew the vision of liberty 
and justice for all in us. Help us to con-
tend fearlessly against evil and to 
make no peace with oppression. To love 
only that which is good. To learn to be 
gentle. By our actions to lessen the 
tides of sorrow. To add to the sum of 
human flourishing. 
Amen.

Prospectus Number: 
PEW -0001-MU23 
FY 2023 Project Summary 
The General Services Administration (GSA) is proposing to invest in projects that directly result 
in reduced energy usage, reduced water usage, utility cost savings, and reduced pollution and 
emissions in Government-owned buildings beginning in Fiscal Year (FY) 2023. 
FY 2023 Committee Approval and Appropriation Requested ........................... .$15,000,000 
Program Summary 
GSA proposes the implementation of energy and water retrofit and conservation measures in 
Government-owned buildings beginning in FY 2023. The Energy and Water Conservation 
Measures Program (Program) is designed to reduce on-site energy and water consumption through 
building alteration projects or retrofits of existing buildings systems. Completing these projects is 
an important part of GSA's approach to complying with requirements in the Energy Act of 2020 
(EA2020) and Executive Order 14057: Catalyzing Clean Energy Industries and Jobs Through 
Federal Sustainability. 
· 
Projects will reflect GSA and Administration priorities including improving reducing costs; 
advancing clean and innovative technologies; and reducing pollutants and emissions from building 
operations. 
Furthermore, this investment may generate rebates and incentives from utility 
companies and grid operators. 
In addition to meeting the stated priorities, proposed projects will be screened for life-cycle cost 
effectiveness to ensure they will generate a positive return-on-investment within the expected 
lifetime of the equipment. 
This Prospectus program supports design and construction of energy and water management 
projects and retrofits in Federal buildings. Typical projects include, but are not limited to, the 
following: 
• 
Upgrade heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems with new, high 
efficiency systems; 
• 
Replace existing lighting and lighting controls including associated wiring; 
• 
Install and upgrade building automation systems (BAS) and energy management control 
systems (EMCS); 
• 
Design and install and connect renewable energy systems including solar photovoltaics, 
solar water heating, and wind power;

Federal facilities in high seismic areas throughout the country through previous seismic 
evaluations, inspections, and 41 American Society of Civil Engineers Tier 1 studies undertaken as 
part of the GSA Seismic Risk Rating program. The approval requested in this prospectus is for a 
set ofretrofit projects with engineering solutions to reduce hazards. Resulting mitigation projects 
will vary in size, location, and delivery method. Typical projects include: 
· 
• 
Installing or upgrading seismic bracing on fire suppression piping, water lines, gas lines, 
and steam lines to reduce fire risk and reduce risk from falling hazards to the building 
occupants; 
• 
Installing seismic bracing on partitions with large height-to-thickness ratios, terracotta, or 
unbraced stairwell conditions, including revisions to stairs to allow for relative floor 
movement during seismic events; 
• 
Installing seismic bracing and snubbers, as· required, to mechanical and electrical 
equipment to reduce instability, fire risk, and post-event downtime; 
• 
Installing seismic bracing on and above suspended ceilings to prevent ceilings, fixtures, 
equipment, and piping from falling; 
• 
Bracing parapet walls and other facade elements to reduce falling hazards at the exterior of 
buildings and at building exits; 
o 
Strengthening diaphragm and connections to lateral load resisting elements; 
• 
Strengthening critical structural members and connections; and 
1 In FY 2018, GSA allocated fonding to this program via the spend plan process.

• 
Anchoring features and installing seismic bracing on furniture, fixtures, and equipment to 
mitigate injury risk. 
Justification 
Based on .seismic studies, GSA initiated a program to identify nonstmctural seismic hazards, and 
initiated correction and risk reduction projects associated with those hazards. According to the 
Department of Homeland Security, Federal Emergency Management Agency, most of the damage 
caused by several recent U.S. earthquakes was the result of nonstructural failures and falling 
nonstmctural building components are responsible for the majority of injuries. Completion of 
projects funded through this program will reduce the risk from seismic events in GSA-controlled 
buildings. 
· 
Summary of Energy, Water, Sustainability, and Climate Risk Compliance 
This project will be designed to conform to requirements of the Facilities Standards for the Public 
Buildings Service. GSA will focus on design and construction opportunities to increase energy and 
water efficiencies to · minimize operating costs and greenhouse gas emissions, to incorporate 
sustainable design principles into projects, and identify and minimize climate risk liabilities above 
the minimum performance criteria in a manner that is life-cycle cost effective.

FY 2023 Project Summary 
The General Services Administration (GSA) proposes a repair and alteration project to upgrade, 
replace, and improve the conveying systems in multiple buildings under the jurisdiction, custody, 
and control of GSA during fiscal year (FY) 2023. 
FY 2023 Committee Approval and Appropriation Requested ................................ $63,198,000 
Major Work Items 
Elevator, escalator, and wheelchair lift upgrades; hazardous materials abatement; and life-safety 
upgrades 
Proposed Project 
The program proposes the full modernization of the elevators, escalators, and wheelchair lifts in 
numerous Government-owned buildings within GSA's inventory. All the buildings evaluated are 
considered long-term holds, and the proposed modernizations are required to extend the useful life 
of these assets. The proposed projects include: 
• 
Replacem~nt of the major system components, including motors and controls, and 
upgrades to elevator pits, machine rooms, and interior cabs; and 
• 
Incorporation of power standby technologies in escalators to reduce energy consumption 
during periods of low or no passenger activity, and hazardous materials abatement. 
Justification 
The repairs and -replacements of these systems will provide reliable, timely, and efficient service 
and meet current building codes, and fire, life-safety, and accessibility requirements. The current 
systems have exceeded their useful lives and are difficult to maintain. Some of the equipment 
dates to the original construction of the buildings and component parts are no longer manufactured. 
Tenant impacts include numerous entrapments in the elevators and multiple elevators or escalators 
being taken out of service due to mechanical failures and lack of replacement parts. The systems 
are not in compliance with current code and safety standards, and the control systems are not 
compatible with current technology.

FY 2023 Project Summary 
The General Services Administration (GSA) proposes a repair and alteration project to upgrade, 
replace, and improve the fire alarm systems in multiple Government-o'Wlled buildings during fiscal 
year (FY) 2023 to address critical fire-safety issues. 
FY 2023 Committee Approval and Appropriation Requested ................................ $81,125,000 
Major Work Items 
Fire protection and electrical upgrades; interior construction; hazardous materials abatement; and 
life~safety upgrades 
Proposed Project 
Install new, modernized fire alann and emergency communication systems in accordance with the 
requirements of the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), National Fire Alarm and 
Signaling Code, NFP A 72 and the International Building Code throughout the buildings for lifeN 
safety and property protection. The new systems will satisfy all occupancy-specific requirements 
outlined in the studies completed on the buildings study, including codes, standards, and GSA 
facilities standards. Once the new systems are installed and commissioned by GSA, the existing 
systems will be decomm,issioned and demolished. All finishes. disturbed by the installation of the 
new fire alarm will ·be restored to 
11like-new" condition. The proposed projects include: 
• 
Replacement of entire fire alarm and emergency communication systems, 
• Replacement of and integration of system platform field devices, including alarm 
initiating devices such as pull stations, smoke detectors, heat detectors, duct detectors, 
waterflow and tamper switch stations, and signaling and notification devices at those 
buildings where the main fire alam1 control units have recently been replaced (Internal 
Revenue Service and Hubert H. Humphrey buildings), 
• Replacement of communication networks, if needed, 
• 
Electrical upgrades, 
• 
Interior construction, 
• 
Demolition, and 
• 
Hazardous materials abatement. 
Justification 
The repairs 'and replacements of these systems will provide safe, reliable, and code-compliant fire 
protection and life-safety systems that detect and alert building occupants, visitors and emergency 
personnel of smoke, fire, carbon monoxide, and other fire-related emergencies .. The current 
systems have exceeded their useful life and are difficult to maintain. Some of the equipment dates

not compatible with current technology. The critical missions and goals of the customer. agencies 
require continuity of operations. In the event of an emergency, building occupants and visitors 
must be able to depart the facility safely and efficiently. Additionally, to reduce the Federal 
Government and taxpayers' potential losses from fire, it is critical to provide for the safety of 
bui\ding tenants, protect Federal real property, an~ control environmental impact. 
A working, reliable, fully functioning and code"compliant fire alann system is a prerequisite for 
building occupancy. Any partial or full-on, catastrophic fire alarm system failure will require a 
fireHwatch and fire mitigation strategy to be in place until the system is restored. The replacement 
systems will provide for energy efficiency and reduce operations and maintenance costs.

FY 2023 Project Summary 
The General Services Administration ( GSA) proposes the reconfiguration and renovation of space 
within Govermnent-owned and leased buildings during fiscal year (FY) 2023 to support GSA's 
ongoing consolidation efforts to improve space utilization, optimize inventory, decrease reliance 
on leased space, and reduce the Govermnent's environmental footprint. 
Since the inception of the Consolidation Activities program in FY 2014, GSA has 
received $322,353,000 in support of the program and, through FY 2021, has funded 87 
projects. When complete, these 87 projects will result in more than a 1.8 million usable square 
foot space reduction, thereby reducing agency rental payments to GSA by $76 million annually 
and generating more than- $163,000,000 in annual Government lease cost avoidance. These 
projects will more than recover the initial capital investment after just two years of project 
completion and will continue to accrue additional savings over the life of these assets. 
FY 2023 Committee Approval and Appropriation Requested ............................... $30,000,000 
Program Summary 
As part ofits ongoing effort to improve space utilization, optimize inventory, decrease reliance on 
leased space, and reduce the Govemment' s environmental footprint, GSA is identifying 
consolidation opportunities within its inventory of real property assets. These opportunities are 
presented through surveys and studies, partnering with customer agencies and agency initiatives. 
Projects will vary in size by location and agency mission and operations; however, no single 
project will exceed $20 million in GSA costs. Funds will support consolidation of customer 
agencies and will not be available for GSA internal consolidations. Preference will be given to 
projects that result in an offic~ utilization rate of 130 usable square feet per person or less and a 
total project payback period of 10 years or less. 
Typical projects include the following: 
• 
Reconfiguration and alteration of existing Federal space to accommodate incoming agency 
relocation/consolidation (which may include reconfigurations of existing occupied Federal 
tenant space); 
• 
Right sizing the federal footprint including restacking and consolidations to· account for 
anticipated remote and hybrid work arrangements; and 
• 
Incidental alterations and system upgrades, such as fire sprinklers or heating, ventilation, 
and air conditioning, needed as part of relocation and consolidation.

Projects will be evaluated using the following criteria: 
• 
Preference will be given to projects that are identified as a reduction opportunity by both 
GSA and the subject agency, and that meet the other criteria. 
• 
Proposed consolidation projects will result in a reduction in annual rent paid by the 
impacted customer agency. 
• 
Preference is given to consolidations within or into federally owned buildings over 
consolidations within or into leased space. 
• 
Consolidation of expiring leases into federally owned buildings will be given preference 
over those business cases for lease cancellations that include a cancellation cost. 
• 
Colocation with other agencies with shared resources and special space will be given 
preference. 
• 
Links to other consolidation projects will be given preference. 
Justification 
GSA continually analyzes opportunities to improve space utilization and realize long-term cost 
savings for the Government. Funding for space consolidations is essential so that GSA can execute 
those opportunities. 
Projects funded tmder this program will enable agencies to consolidate within Government-
controlled leased space or to relocate-from either Government-controlled leased or federally 
owned space-to federally owned space under the jurisdiction, custody, and control of GSA that 
more efficiently meets mission needs. 
These consolidations will result in improved space 
utilization, cost savings for the American taxpayers and a reduced environmental impact. 
Summary of Energy, Water, Sustainability, and Climate Risk Compliance 
This project will be designed to conform to requirements of the Facilities Standards for the Public 
Buildings Service. GSA will focus on design and construction opportunities to increase energy and 
water efficiencies to minimize operating costs and greenhouse gas emissions, to incorporate 
sustainable design principles into projects, and identify and minimize climate risk liabilities above 
the minimum performance criteria in a manner that is life-cycle cost effective.

RECOGNIZING CAPTAIN JEFFERY 
HUGHLEY’S 
INDUCTION 
INTO 
THE BLACK ACHIEVERS SOCIETY 
OF GREATER KANSAS CITY 
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 17, 2022 
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, it is with 
immense pride that I rise today to recognize 
and celebrate the induction of Captain Jeffery 
Hughley into the Black Achievers Society of 
Greater Kansas City. A distinguished police of-
ficer, non-profit board member, and Senior Ad-
visor at the Environmental Protection Agency, 
it seems there is nothing that Captain Hughley 
cannot accomplish. He has served the Kansas 
City community in more ways than one and 
truly embodies the mission of the Black 
Achievers Society. 
Captain Hughley started as a police officer 
for KCPD’s Central Patrol Division in 2005 and 
quickly rose through the ranks. Spending his 
days working tirelessly to ensure a safe envi-
ronment for those around him, even when that 
meant putting his own life at risk, Captain 
Hughley’s exemplary record and dedication to 
the people of Kansas City did not go unno-
ticed. He served as a Detective in the Street 
Crimes Unit, supervised and mentored new of-
ficers as a Sergeant, and eventually achieved 
the rank of Captain, providing leadership and 
oversight to the East Patrol Division & Deten-
tion Services Unit. Throughout his career, 
Captain Hughley also provided protection to 
elected officials and local leaders, ensuring 
their safety during important events and gath-
erings. In addition to his official duties as a 
law enforcement officer, Captain Hughley 
served nearly five years as an Executive 
Board Member of the Kansas City Fraternal 
Order of Police Lodge No. 99, fostering a 
strong sense of unity and comradery between 
officers. His service to our city has proven in-
valuable and we continue to express our end-
less gratitude. 
While protecting and serving your commu-
nity for over 15 years is remarkable in and of 
itself, Captain Hughley continues to go above 
and beyond the call of duty. Appointed by 
Governor Jay Nixon, he served as Commis-
sioner of the Missouri Peace Officers Stand-
ards & Training Commission from 2015 until 
2019. A delegation created to analyze the cur-
rent training practices of law enforcement in 
hopes of creating better outcomes for both of-
ficers and those they serve, the Commission 
eventually increased continuing education pro-
grams and the training required for police offi-
cers throughout the State of Missouri. Under 
Captain Hughley’s leadership, the Commission 
emphasized implicit bias training and de-esca-
lation techniques in order to make policing 
more fair and just. His continued focus on up-
lifting the underprivileged led him to becoming 
a Board Member of Reconciliation Services, a 
non-profit organization that strategically ad-
dresses community needs through increased 
social and mental health services. Guided by 
the Biblical command to ‘‘love thy neighbor,’’ 
Captain Hughley helps address the issues fac-
ing families in the urban core through his work 
with Reconciliation Services. 
Having already obtained a degree in Crimi-
nal Justice from the University of Arkansas 
Grantham, Captain Hughley felt compelled to 
return to school. Applying his exceptional lead-
ership experience to his coursework, Captain 
Hughley received an Executive Master of 
Business Administration from Rockhurst Uni-
versity in Kansas City, Missouri. He has used 
the knowledge gained from this program in his 
work both as a police officer and in his current 
position as Senior Advisor to the Regional Ad-
ministrator at the Environmental Protection 
Agency. Captain Hughley masterfully employs 
his extensive education, professional experi-
ence, and institutional knowledge as he con-
tinues to support and serve the Kansas City 
community. We are extremely lucky to have 
such a kind and generous soul working to 
make our city the best that it can be. 
The Black Achievers Society of Greater 
Kansas City is an acclaimed, respected, and 
exclusive institution. I founded this organiza-
tion in 1974 with the goal of recognizing com-
panies that demonstrated leadership in the 
areas of diversity and inclusion. Today, nearly 
50 years later, the Black Achievers Society’s 
mission is to respond to the multifaceted 
needs of the community by providing role 
models for Black and minority youth. Member-
ship in the Society is reserved for African 
American professionals who have been nomi-
nated for their leadership, achievements, and 
community involvement. Having known him 
personally for many years and having seen 
the impact his work has made in the lives of 
others, it was with great joy that I nominated 
Captain Hughley for admission into the Soci-
ety. Being inducted as a member is a great 
honor and momentous occasion. I believe I 
speak for all Kansas Citians when I say that 
Captain Hughley is deeply deserving of this in-
duction. I look forward to seeing all that he ac-
complishes and wish him the best of luck in all 
his future endeavors. 
Captain Hughley represents the best in all 
of us. His care and compassion for those with 
whom he serves shines through in all that he 
does, and it is my privilege to recognize Cap-
tain Hughley’s devotion to the people of Kan-
sas City. Madam Speaker, please join me and 
Missouri’s Fifth Congressional District in cele-
brating Captain Jeffery Hughley’s induction 
into the Black Achievers Society of Greater 
Kansas City. Our neighborhoods are safer, 
stronger, and better places to raise families 
because of Captain Hughley. Let us look to 
Captain Hughley as an example and live as 
stewards of our communities, just as he has. 
COMMEMORATING BRUCE 
CUNNINGHAM 
HON. KWEISI MFUME 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 17, 2022 
Mr. MFUME. Madam Speaker, from a very 
young age, this person for whom I stand today 
was into all kinds of athletic games. Not just 
one kind of sport but every sport and every 
kind of athlete. So, talking about it came natu-
rally. He asked, why should I not make this a 
career? 
In Baltimore there is a gritty loyalty to its 
sports teams and its heroes. Over the span of 
four decades, one man has talked about and 
reported on two Super Bowl champion teams, 
the most decorated Olympian of all time and 
various stars in the athletic firmament from the 
greater Baltimore region with a gusto un-
matched or unequaled by anyone. He has 
made everyday people feel like they were a 
part of the story, and so I am pleased today 
to enter into the RECORD my recognition for 
distinguished sportscaster and storyteller, Mr. 
Bruce Cunningham, who has recently retired 
from WBFF Fox 45 TV news in Baltimore. 
Many Ravens fans know only one voice as 
the straightforward announcer and analyst of 
the NFL team’s home games. Michael Phelps’ 
exploits were told true and writ large over the 
TV screens of viewers young and old, proud 
of their hometown hero bringing gold medal 
after gold medal home for swimming. Whether 
it was the Orioles after a come-from-behind 
win or a heartbreaking loss, or Navy football 
celebrating a win over Army, Bruce was sure 
to tell the story with imagination, spirit, and 
Baltimore braggadocio. 
I was Sports Unlimited, on Sunday nights, 
that was Bruce’s hallmark. Since 1991, at its 
inception with Fox 45 in Baltimore, Bruce has 
been sharing his takes on everything from 
MLB to the Baltimore Blast soccer team to 
Maryland and Johns Hopkins lacrosse. He 
was there for the NCAA Men’s Basketball 
Championship the University of Maryland 
brought home. He saluted Coach Brenda 
Frese’s Lady Terrapins NCAA Championship 
in basketball. He also talked golf, tennis and 
other sports like boxing and horseracing, and 
he was there at Pimlico for eventual Triple 
Crown winner, American Pharaoh in 2015. 
There is something intangible about sports 
which unites a city, and Bruce Cunningham 
made that part of his many broadcasts. Rang-
ing from the intensity of Baltimore in the 
Ravens’ Ray Lewis and the Orioles’ Cal 
Ripken, Jr. to the lesser-known stories in 
Maryland 
like 
Tamir 
Goldman 
of 
the 
Talmudical Academy in Baltimore, dubbed the 
‘‘Jewish Jordan’’ for his basketball abilities, or 
Helen Maroulis, the two-time bronze medal- 
winner in women’s wrestling at the Olympics 
from Rockville, Bruce has covered it all with 
the spirit and grit of Baltimore and a love for 
our state of Maryland not many could match. 
Now that he has decided to lead a ‘‘normal 
life’’ and ‘‘get home before midnight on Sun-
days’’ as he puts it, our city will not have that

highlights, insights, and the sports stories

HONORING NATIONAL CENTER FOR 
FAMILIES LEARNING PRESIDENT 
SHARON DARLING ON HER RE-
TIREMENT 
HON. JOHN A. YARMUTH 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 17, 2022 
Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, l rise 
today to honor Sharon Darling, President and 
Founder of the National Center for Families 
Learning and former Kentucky Director of 
Adult and Community Education, as she be-
gins her well-earned and much-deserved re-
tirement after years of dedication to the ad-
vancement of education policy and family lit-
eracy. 
For decades, Sharon has served as a na-
tional leader in family learning, making NCFL 
a go-to resource for all who are working to 
make adult literacy not only a priority, but a 
powerful tool for breaking the cycles of poverty 
that limit far too many families. Without her 
pioneering work, the very definition of family 
literacy that our federal government relies on 
to steer the policies that help countless Ameri-
cans would not exist. It is not an exaggeration 
to say that Sharon Darling helped write the 
lesson plan for America’s comprehensive ap-
proach to intergenerational learning, because 
that’s exactly what she did. 
Her day-to-day presence will be sorely 
missed by her colleagues and all whose lives 
she has touched, but I’m thrilled to know that 
Sharon is staying on to serve as an active 
member of NCFL’s Board of Directors and will 
continue to support the organization in a vari-
ety of ways. Even in retirement, she will help 
continue the success of NCFL in the years 
ahead as they continue under the leadership 
of Dr. Felicia C. Smith. 
When asked about her upcoming retirement, 
Sharon said, ‘‘Never did I expect my life to un-
fold how it has, but each day I am grateful to 
all those who believe in the tremendous power 
of multigenerational learning.’’ On behalf of the 
people of Kentucky’s Third Congressional Dis-
trict and all who know Sharon Darling, let me 
say that we are all incredibly grateful that her 
life unfolded as it did, and that millions of 
Americans—including the more than 4.5 mil-
lion parents and children across the 150 com-
munities in 39 states and Washington, D.C. 
served by NCFL—are all better for her life’s 
work. 
I thank Sharon for her selfless dedication to 
improving the lives of others through learning. 
I wish her nothing but the best in her retire-
ment. 
TRIBUTE 
TO 
LAWANDA 
LYONS- 
PRUITT—CALIFORNIA’S 
24TH 
CONGRESSIONAL WOMAN OF THE 
YEAR 
HON. SALUD O. CARBAJAL 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 17, 2022 
Mr. CARBAJAL. Madam Speaker, each 
year, through the Women of the Year Award, 
my office extends special recognition to 
women on the Central Coast who have made 
a difference in our community. I would like to 
recognize one outstanding Women of the Year 
Award recipient, Lawanda Lyons-Pruitt of 
Santa Maria, California. 
A 
longtime 
resident 
of 
Santa 
Maria, 
Lawanda Lyons-Pruitt has been a leader on 
behalf of communities of color in Santa Maria 
and Lompoc for over two decades. 
Lawanda has been the President of the 
Santa Maria-Lompoc NAACP chapter for more 
than 14 years. Inspired by her early childhood 
experiences in segregated Mississippi before 
eventually moving to Santa Maria after high 
school, Lawanda has long served as a record- 
keeper for Black families in the area and orga-
nizer of community events that emphasize the 
importance of honoring Black history. 
In her longstanding commitment to resolving 
racial injustice like she experienced as a child, 
Lawanda worked in the Santa Barbara County 
Public Defender’s Office for over three dec-
ades. After earning her degree in criminology 
from Cal State Long Beach, Lawanda became 
an investigator for the Public Defender’s Office 
in 1984. Eleven years later, she was named 
the department’s Chief Investigator, making 
her the first African American woman in Cali-
fornia to serve in that position. Lawanda made 
a career of treating people with compassion 
and respect, working to ensure that each de-
fendant received their constitutional right to a 
good defense. 
Where Lawanda sees a need, she takes ac-
tion. After the murder of George Floyd, she 
used her position on the Santa Maria Police 
Department’s police advisory board to call for 
the creation of a civilian review board to inves-
tigate officers accused of abuse and help re-
build trust between the police and community. 
With the many daunting challenges brought 
on by the COVID–19 pandemic, her leader-
ship has guided many in the community to 
safely face those challenges. In the destruc-
tive wake of COVID–19, Lawanda became a 
trusted source for information about the virus 
and the vaccine. She is a strong advocate for 
COVID–19 vaccination within the BIPOC com-
munity, taking the time to talk through ques-
tions and fears, helping to ease vaccine hesi-
tancy and encourage individuals to protect 
themselves and those around them. She gives 
so much of her time, energy, and resources to 
serve our community. 
Lawanda’s openness and commitment to 
her community is a testament to her selfless-
ness. She is a worthy candidate for this honor 
and a role model for community leaders of all 
kinds. 
I am honored to recognize Lawanda for her 
continued commitment to uplifting and advo-
cating for Black communities across the Cen-
tral Coast. I ask all Members to join me today 
in honoring an exceptional woman of Califor-
nia’s 24th Congressional District, Lawanda 
Lyons-Pruitt, for her incredible service to her 
community.

HONORING 
DAVID 
MCBRIDE’S 
SERVICE 
TO 
THE 
NASA 
ARM-
STRONG FLIGHT RESEARCH CEN-
TER 
HON. KEVIN McCARTHY 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 17, 2022 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the Director of the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) 
Armstrong Flight Research Center, David 
McBride, on his retirement after many years of 
service to the scientific community. 
Pursuing his passion for aeronautics re-
search, David kicked off his career with NASA 
as a cooperative education student in 1982. 
Specializing in digital flight control systems 
analysis, he explored the way in which aircraft 
perform under an array of flight test condi-
tions. Wanting to continue his interest in the 
field, David received both an undergraduate 
and graduate degree from the University of 
New Mexico, earning his Bachelor of Science 
in Electrical Engineering in 1985 and Execu-
tive Master of Business Administration in 
1998. 
Upon graduation, David climbed the ranks 
at NASA Armstrong, eventually becoming Pro-
gram Manager for the Flight Research Pro-
gram, as well as Deputy Center Director and 
Associate Director for Programs and Projects. 
In these roles, David was integral in the study, 
development, and testing of groundbreaking 
technologies, including the Intelligent Flight 
Control System, X–53 Active Aeroelastic Wing 
flight research project, and solar-powered He-
lios aircraft. 
In 2010, David was appointed Director of 
the Armstrong Flight Research Center, for-
merly the Hugh L. Dryden Flight Research 
Center. Under his leadership, NASA Arm-
strong remained the premier research center 
for aeronautics in the United States. In fact, 
NASA Armstrong conducted critical flight de-
velopment tests over the years, including the 
notable testing of the X–48B/C hybrid wing 
body experimental aircraft and the testing of 
NASA Orion’s launch and abort systems. Ad-
ditionally, during David’s tenure as Director, 
NASA Armstrong’s Boeing 747SP SOFIA 
(Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astron-
omy) project became fully operational—a feat 
that has allowed our nation’s foremost sci-
entists to further our nation’s scientific under-
standing. 
Throughout his career, David has devoted 
himself to exploring new frontiers and building 
upon NASA Armstrong’s proud legacy of sci-
entific discovery. Though he will be greatly 
missed at the Armstrong Flight Research Cen-
ter, I am confident David will continue to be a 
force in the world of scientific development. 
On behalf of the 23rd Congressional District of 
California, I would like to thank David for his 
service to our community, and I wish him and 
his family the very best as they enter this new 
chapter of their lives.

RECOGNIZING REV. PATRICK O. 
LINDSEY 
HON. BRENDA L. LAWRENCE 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 17, 2022 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor and congratulate Greater 
Bibleway Missionary Baptist Church upon the 
30th Anniversary of their pastor, Rev. Patrick 
Oliver Lindsey, and the First Lady of the 
Church, Kathy Lindsey. Pastor Lindsey, the 
fourth of eight children born to John, Sr. (de-
ceased), and Ida Lindsey, lived on the 
eastside of Detroit, MI, and were educated in 
Detroit and Highland Park Public School sys-
tems. Rev. Lindsey furthered his education at 
the University of Michigan and graduated in 
1981 with a BA in Political Science. Through-
out his professional career, Rev. Lindsey 
furthered his studies at various institutions, in-
cluding the Center for Corporate Citizenship at 
Boston College, the John F. Kennedy School 
of Government at Harvard University, and 
DaimlerChrysler 
Corporate 
University 
in 
Lautenbach, Germany, and the Ross School 
of Business at the University of Michigan. 
After marrying the former Kathy Sanders of 
Brownsville, TN, in April 1992, the couple was 
blessed with two wonderful children: a son 
named Kendall, a 2018 graduate of the Uni-
versity of Michigan, and a daughter named 
Kaylyn, a 2021 graduate of Wayne State Uni-
versity. This year, Rev. Lindsey and his wife 
celebrated 30 years of wedded bliss. 
Rev. Lindsey made a firm commitment to 
the church in December 1983, and he began 
a life of faithful service at the Samaritan Mis-
sionary Baptist Church, where his family has 
worshipped since 1952. Under the stellar lead-
ership of the late Pastor Robert E. Starghill, 
Sr., Rev. Lindsey was ordained as a deacon 
in March 1984 and served in a variety of lead-
ership and service roles, including financial 
clerk, board secretary, Bible teacher, van min-
istry, Pastor’s Chorus, and Men’s group presi-
dent. 
In June 1992, Rev. Lindsey served as Pas-
tor of the Greater Bibleway Missionary Baptist 
Church in Detroit, Michigan. During his tenure, 
Rev. Lindsey has diligently cultivated the con-
gregation’s spiritual growth and development 
and prioritizes expository preaching, sound 
biblical teaching, and the practical application 
of scriptural principles. With the assistance of 
faithful deacons and trustees, Pastor Lindsey 
oversees the church’s pastoral and business 
administration. For thirty years, Rev. Lindsey 
has faithfully performed the clerical duties of 
‘‘feeding and tending the flock,’’ including 
teaching and preaching the Word, christening 
newborns, baptizing new believers, providing 
spiritual counsel to individuals and couples, 
comforting the bereaved, visiting sick and 
infirmed members, and aiding congregants in 
times of need. 
Under Pastor Lindsey’s leadership, the 
church re-launched its weekly Bible studies 
and prayer ministries and established new 
ministries for men, women, and youth. He re-
quires that all church ministries have evan-
gelism as a core mission. Rev. Lindsey found-
ed the Rev. CJ Henderson Memorial Scholar-
ship to provide students with financial support 
in pursuing higher education. Pastor Lindsey 
spearheaded Phase 1 of the church’s building 
project—a complete renovation of the existing 
facilities. With plans for Phase 2 to include ex-
panded worship and education facilities. 
Rev. Lindsey’s passions extend beyond his 
pastoral duties, as Rev. Lindsey also serves 
as Vice President, Government and Commu-
nity Affairs at Wayne State University in De-
troit. In this position, he oversees the federal 
and state affairs offices, which support the 
University’s goals and strategic plan by work-
ing with federal, state, and local elected offi-
cials to ensure adequate funding for the insti-
tution. He also is responsible for the commu-
nity affairs office, which actively engages the 
University in the Greater Detroit community by 
building partnerships with the diverse ethnic

extended capacity for a true impact on the 
community, evident in his various leadership 
roles, organizational affiliations, and volunteer 
activities. He currently serves as a member of 
the Board of Trustees of the National Urban

Michigan, Vice Moderator of the Pleasant 
Grove Baptist District Association, board mem-
ber and Secretary of Detroit Community

mittee member of the Eastside Community

also served in other organizations, including 
the City of Detroit Workforce Development

Alive, Wayne State University Human Inves-
tigation Committee, and the Eight Mile Boule-
vard Association, to name a few. He is a 
proud member of the Alpha Phi Alpha Frater-
nity, Inc., and a life member of the Detroit

Alumni Association. 
I congratulate Rev., and First Lady Lindsey, 
on three decades of service to all.

CELEBRATING 
MR. 
JAY 
B. 
DILLINGHAM’S LASTING LEGACY 
IN THE GREATER KANSAS CITY 
AREA 
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 17, 2022 
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, it is my 
distinct honor to rise on behalf of Missouri’s 
Fifth Congressional District, Kansas City, Mis-
souri, and more specifically the Northland, to 
celebrate the lasting legacy of Jay B. 
Dillingham. A true local icon, one cannot tell 
the story of Kansas City without telling the 
story of Mr. Dillingham. Born on March 8, 
1910, Mr. Dillingham served the Greater Kan-
sas City area and the States of Missouri and 
Kansas until his passing on August 13, 2007. 
In 1935, Mr. Dillingham received his mas-
ter’s degree from the Kansas City School of 
Law, which would later become the University 
of Missouri-Kansas City. Nevertheless, soon 
after graduating, he was recruited to work at 
the Kansas City Stockyards and never prac-
ticed law. From 1948 through 1975, Mr. 
Dillingham served as president of the stock-
yards, one of Kansas City’s greatest indus-
tries, where thousands of cattle, pigs, sheep, 
horses, and mules were auctioned in the West 
Bottoms each year. As president of the famed 
Kansas City Stockyards, a role he took on 
while only 38 years old, Mr. Dillingham helped 
turn the American Royal Livestock Show into 
a national institution. He once said about the 
stockyards: ‘‘There’s nothing around here I 
haven’t done . . . from shoveling manure to 
cleaning the sewers.’’ In 1949, Mr. Dillingham 
founded the Golden Ox Steakhouse in the 
Kansas City Livestock Exchange Building, 
making it the city’s oldest steakhouse and the 
birthplace of the Kansas City strip. 
As part of his family’s farming activities, Mr. 
Dillingham worked on 2,500 acres of beautiful 
Missouri River bottomland. He was also deep-
ly engaged in developing lakes in the Kansas 
River basin along with Clay County’s Smith-
ville Lake. Following the Great Flood of 1951, 
he oversaw the cleanup and assisted in get-
ting the town back to work. He was a member 
of the Missouri State Water Resource Board 
and assisted the U.S. Army Corps of Engi-
neers in the construction of massive reservoirs 
throughout Missouri and Kansas. In Genesis 
2:15, one of the first things God asked of us 
was to be good stewards of the land: ‘‘The 
LORD God then took the man and settled him 
in the garden of Eden, to cultivate and care for 
it.’’ It is indisputable that Mr. Dillingham was a 
great steward of the land and gave most of his 
time on this earth looking after it. 
Mr. Dillingham was the only person to ever 
serve as president of the Kansas City, Mis-
souri and Kansas City, Kansas Chambers of 
Commerce. It’s because of Mr. Dillingham’s 
impactful work and public service that Gov-
ernor Joe Teasdale and Governor Kit Bond 
appointed him as Chairman of the Missouri 
Department of Transportation’s Missouri High-
ways and Transportation Commission from 
1978 to 1983. It was in this position that he 
would be given the nickname of ‘‘Father of I– 
435’’. Interstate 670, running through both 
Missouri and Kansas, carries his name today. 
Indeed, Mr. Dillingham was a driving force be-
hind Kansas City’s growth, including the deci-
sion to locate the Kansas City International 
Airport in the Northland. 
Mr. Dillingham, in addition to being a suc-
cessful businessman and public servant, was 
also a generous philanthropist who donated 
land from the stockyards for worthy causes 
like the American Royal and the construction 
of Kemper Arena, now known as the Hy-Vee 
Arena. Many universities and organizations 
across Missouri and Kansas also bear awards 
in his name due to his astounding leadership. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in honoring 
the life and legacy of Mr. Jay B. Dillingham. 
Though he may be gone, his impacts on agri-
culture and infrastructure will not be forgotten.

CELEBRATING 
CHIEF 
TINA 
R. 
WATKINS OF THE PETERSBURG 
DEPARTMENT OF FIRE, RESCUE, 
AND EMERGENCY SERVICES 
HON. A. DONALD McEACHIN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 17, 2022 
Mr. MCEACHIN. Madam Speaker, I would 
like to take the opportunity to celebrate the hir-
ing of Chief Tina R. Watkins, who is the first 
female, and first African-American fire chief of 
Petersburg Department of Fire, Rescue, and 
Emergency Services in its nearly 250-year his-
tory. Chief Watkins brings years of experience 
in fire administration and field operations and 
is primed to succeed in this role. 
Born in Richmond, Virginia, Chief Watkins 
grew up in a middle-class family where she 
was raised by hard working parents. Her 
mother was an educator, and father was a 
postal worker and Korean War veteran. They 
encouraged Chief Watkins and her three 
brothers to go out and experience their 
dreams. Inspired by her parents, Chief Wat-
kins chose a path of service in her own life. 
Chief Watkins holds impressive educational 
credentials. She earned a Master’s degree in 
Leadership with an emphasis in Emergency 
Management and Executive Fire Leadership, 
along with a Bachelor of Science degree in 
Public Safety and Business Administration. 
She holds many professional certifications 
through the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency, the National Fire Academy, and the 
Virginia State Fire Program, including those in 
fire prevention, hazardous materials, national 
fire services staff and command, and emer-
gency planning and effective communications. 
This education has served Chief Watkins 
throughout her career, and will surely continue 
to inform her work in Petersburg. 
Chief Watkins has proven her dedication to 
service and her community. After graduation 
she served our nation as a member of the 
United States Coast Guard. Following her 
Coast Guard service, Chief Watkins began her 
fire service career in 1988 when she was re-
cruited and hired by the Richmond Fire and 
Emergency Services as a fire fighter. She was 
promoted through the ranks to become Rich-
mond Fire and Emergency Services first fe-
male lieutenant, captain, and chief officer. She 
spent 11 years as a Battalion Chief for Rich-
mond Fire and Emergency Services where 
she supervised five stations and six fire com-
panies. Chief Watkins has a demonstrated 
track record serving in leadership roles with 
Richmond Fire and Emergency Services, leav-
ing a legacy of improving processes and poli-
cies, making the department more efficient. 
Now Chief Watkins has the distinction of not 
only becoming Petersburg’s first African Amer-
ican Fire Chief, but also first woman to lead a 
fire department in the Commonwealth. I am 
confident that under her leadership the Peters-
burg Department of Fire, Rescue, and Emer-
gency Services will continue to provide excep-
tional service to our community. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in celebrating Chief Tina R. Watkins for 
her service to her Nation, the Commonwealth 
of Virginia, and her community. 
IN RECOGNITION OF GRAND 
PARKLET 
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 17, 2022 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, today I would 
like to recognize the hard work and vision of 
Detroit’s Grandmont Rosedale community and 
organizations who have made the dedication 
and grand opening of Grand Parklet possible. 
Grand Parklet is the culmination of a trans-
formative public roads project that created a 
community green space from what was once 
a vacant corner. But this park is not a typical 
beautification project. Grand Parklet creates a 
walkable route that connects residents to 
neighborhoods and local businesses, a wel-
come addition to this thriving neighborhood. 
Beyond connecting the community, Grand 
Parklet will serve as a space to gather for 
events and conversation for all to enjoy. 
Please join me in thankful recognition of 
Grandmont Rosedale Community Develop-
ment Corporation and the people of Rosedale 
Park, North Rosedale Park, Minock Park, 
Grandmont, and Grandmont 1 who made 
Grand Parklet possible.

HONORING THE LIFE OF MARK W. 
HEMENWAY 
HON. JERRY McNERNEY 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 17, 2022 
Mr. MCNERNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and work of Mark W. 
Hemenway, who passed away on May 8, 
2022. 
Mark graduated from the United States Mili-
tary Academy at West Point, New York in 
1973. He was intensely focused on his studies 
and training, while also maintaining perspec-
tive and serving as a steady, positive influence 
on his classmates. He worked his way through 
a challenging system with confidence and 
calmness, never losing sight of his priorities. 
His commitment to academic excellence was 
apparent to all, and he graduated 61st in a 
class of over 950 cadets. 
Mark received a commission as a Second 
Lieutenant in the U.S. Army Corps of Engi-
neers upon his graduation and spent seven 
years as an active-duty service member. After 
leaving the Army in 1980, Mark worked for a 
large manufacturing company before joining a 
consulting firm outside Boston, Massachu-
setts, conducting logistics, manpower, and 
training analysis for the U.S. Department of 
Defense. 
Later in life, Mark felt called to enter Semi-
nary and obtain a Master of Divinity degree. 
He and his wife, Kate, met as volunteers while 
doing street ministry in Boston Common, and 
in subsequent decades, Mark worked as a vol-
unteer with those most in need at state pris-
ons, county correctional facilities, homeless 
shelters, and other institutions in the Lowell, 
Massachusetts area. His contributions will long 
be remembered by his brothers and sisters at 
the Salvation Army Lowell Corps Community 
Center, and by the many people he served 
throughout the community. 
Mark’s legacy is best encapsulated by a 
passage from the United States Military Acad-
emy Alma Mater, which reads: ‘‘And when our 
work is done, our course on earth is run, may 
it be said, ’well done.’ Be thou at peace.’’

HONORING MELVIN MILES, JR. 
HON. KWEISI MFUME 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 17, 2022 
Mr. MFUME. Madam Speaker, music is not 
just a passion, but a life’s calling for some. Mr. 
Melvin Miles, Jr. is without question a man 
who has walked this life listening to and an-
swering the call of the art of music. From his 
matriculation at Morgan State University in the 
early 1970s, Melvin Miles, Jr. was fascinated 
by all kinds of music and musicians. Over the 
span of the better part of five decades, Mr. 
Miles has been recognized by many as an ex-
ceptional cornetist, trumpeter, and band lead-
er. 
Since 1973, Melvin has honed his un-
matched musical admiration and talent to 
serve as a faculty member at Morgan State 
University where he has taught and mentored 
students and marching bands alike. In this 
chapter of his life, he has committed himself to 
the mission of leading young people on the 
path to higher learning and mastering an in-
strument with purpose. 
Madame Speaker, I am pleased today to 
enter into the RECORD my recognition for a 
musician, friend, and teacher extraordinaire, 
Melvin Miles, Jr., who is retiring from Morgan 
State University in Baltimore. 
Melvin first attended Frederick Douglass 
High School before entering Morgan State 
University and receiving Bachelor of Science 
and Master of Arts degrees in Music Edu-
cation. He then furthered his art by attending 
The Catholic University of America for doctoral 
studies, again in Music Education. While these 
institutions and college experiences fine-tuned 
his technique and craft, they also taught him 
that nothing compared to music in terms of 
uniting a university. 
Upon starting with Morgan State’s faculty, 
Mr. Miles made sure to make music a part of 
every student’s college experience. The Sym-
phonic Winds, Jazz Ensemble, and the Con-
cert Band brought endless hours of joy to stu-
dents, alumni, and attendees of all walks of 
life. 
As a teacher, Melvin has been known to de-
mand excellence from those he mentored. 
Still, he maintained a sense of humor that 
made it nearly impossible to not smile when 
you were around him. Melvin Miles’ blend of 
serious and lighthearted mentorship was a 
winning formula that carried his marching 
bands to the highest of heights. This included 
him guiding his 2019 marching band through 
the immense pressure of performing in the re-
nowned Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade in 
New York. Even with the many eyes and ears 
that have been fixed on his bands over the 
span of his career, Melvin has never diverged 
from the down-to-earth man he is. Ultimately, 
it is his purely genuine persona paired with his 
accolades that has caused Melvin’s unmistak-
able popularity to endure. 
Melvin’s love for music, Morgan State, and 
Maryland is truly unmatched. I thank Melvin

many years and thank him as well for all the 
memories he has given to the university, the 
Historically Black College or University com-
munity, and the thousands of alumni who will 
miss him dearly. I have been lucky enough to 
personally call Melvin a friend for the past 
forty-two years. On behalf of all who know him 
or have heard his sound, we are all grateful 
that Melvin has given the world his song.
