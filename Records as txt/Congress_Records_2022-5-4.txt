PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. O God, the strength of 
all who put their trust in You, remind 
our lawmakers that we can accomplish 
little without Your mercy and grace. 
Give them the wisdom to trust Your 
power and might in their every endeav-
or, as You inspire them to live worthy 
of Your faithfulness. 
Lord, we all borrow our daily heart-
beats from You, so give us the serenity 
to accept the things we cannot change, 
the courage to change the things we 
can, and the wisdom to know the dif-
ference. 
And 
Lord, 
continue 
to 
strengthen the Ukrainian people. 
We pray in Your powerful Name. 
Amen.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican leader is recog-
nized. 
LAW ENFORCEMENT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, the 
week before last, it was my honor to 
sit down with a number of law enforce-
ment officials in my hometown of Lou-
isville, but I wish we could have met 
under happier circumstances. 
Our city is contending with a tragic 
and record-setting jump in crime. Last 
year, Louisville saw 188 homicides—the 
most in any year on record. In the last 
2 years, carjackings have tripled, and 
deadly drugs are becoming so prevalent 
on our streets that Jefferson County 
saw 500 overdose deaths in 2021. 
Unfortunately, the historic wave of 
crime that has swept my hometown is 
challenging communities all across 
America. The murder rates of at least 
a dozen other major cities set alltime 
records last year. Chicago saw its most 
carjackings in 20 years, and in the first 
quarter of 2022, New York’s crime rate 
was already up—listen to this—44 per-
cent. 
Needless to say, this is a time for 
strong law enforcement. Studies show 
that fewer police and less active polic-
ing make crime worse and leave the 
most vulnerable communities particu-
larly worse off. 
But 
our 
Nation’s 
police 
officers 
aren’t just facing higher volumes of 
crime; they are facing more direct, per-
sonal risks to confront it. Last year, as 
overall homicide counts continued to 
climb past 2020’s record total, killings 
of police officers saw a staggering 59- 
percent spike of their own: 73—73—men 
and women sworn to protect and serve 
their communities were killed in 2021 
while trying to do exactly that, and, 
already, 2022 has seen more than 100 
more officers shot in the line of duty. 
The surge in anti-police violence that 
boiled over in the summer of 2020 has 
taken its toll on the men and women of 
law enforcement. An exhaustive report

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2294 
May 4, 2022 
compiled by the city of Louisville last 
year 
found 
that 
morale—morale— 
among our officers is alarmingly low. A 
full 75 percent would leave for another 
police department. Not surprisingly, 
this has led to a severe staffing short-
age on the force. Our police chief even 
took out billboard ads in Atlanta—in 
Atlanta—to try to recruit officers from 
other cities. 
Now more than ever, we need to fund 
law enforcement, support police offi-
cers, and back the blue, but too many 
Democrats are apparently bent on 
doing just the opposite. The far left’s 
call to defund the police has taken root 
at every level of government. Elected 
officials—sworn to preserve, protect, 
and defend the Constitution—have cho-
sen instead to amplify distrust of the 
men and women who work every day to 
enforce our laws. 
So let’s just consider whom the Biden 
administration has prioritized for con-
firmation to top jobs in the Justice De-
partment. 
There is the new U.S. attorney with a 
reputation for pushing to cancel entire 
categories of the Criminal Code and 
the assistant attorneys general who 
have advocated for efforts to ‘‘decrease 
police budgets’’ and ‘‘invest less in po-
lice.’’ 
There is the newly minted Supreme 
Court Justice who advocated in her 
last job that the COVID pandemic was 
an appropriate reason to let inmates 
out of jail right here in Washington. 
Just last week, our colleagues on the 
Judiciary 
Committee 
considered 
a 
nominee to the circuit court with an 
unapologetic record of hostility toward 
law enforcement. Without any basis in 
fact, Nusrat Choudhury suggested that 
police murdering unarmed Black men 
‘‘happens every day.’’ Happens every 
day? 
When our colleague the junior Sen-
ator from Louisiana called her out on 
it, the nominee tried to claim that she 
had only made the statement as an act 
of ‘‘rhetorical advocacy’’—‘‘rhetorical 
advocacy’’—on behalf of a client. 
Unsurprisingly, that answer hasn’t 
done much to ease the concerns of 
America’s law enforcement commu-
nity. Major organizations representing 
officers—from the Sergeants Benevo-
lent Association to the National Sher-
iffs’ Association, to the Fraternal 
Order of Police—have voiced strong, 
strong opposition and called on Presi-
dent Biden to ‘‘take a stand against 
this 
dangerous 
and 
absurdly’’—ab-
surdly—‘‘divisive rhetoric.’’ 
Well, needless to say, the President 
and his administration need to do a lot 
more than that to prove to the men 
and women of law enforcement that 
they have their backs. 
S.J. RES. 39 
Now, Mr. President, on another mat-
ter, last week, President Biden offered 
a particularly candid look at his view 
of education in America. In speaking at 
an awards ceremony for public school 
teachers, he remarked: 
They’re not somebody else’s children. 
They’re like yours when they’re in the class-
room. 
Unfortunately, this wasn’t a mis-
take. It was actually a rather accurate 
summary of the increasingly radical 
way he and his party think of children 
in America. 
When it comes to the respective roles 
of parents and teachers, Democrats 
have used the past 2 years of the pan-
demic disruptions to show their true 
colors. They have shoveled money into 
woke training, like the North Carolina 
program to help preschool teachers 
‘‘deconstruct 
whiteness’’— 
‘‘deconstruct whiteness.’’ They have 
torn up time-tested procedures as in 
one California district’s move to insti-
tute an equity lottery for admissions. 
Last fall, the former chair of the 
Democratic National Committee ran a 
gubernatorial campaign, saying: 
I don’t think parents should be telling 
schools what they should teach. Suffice it to 
say, parents in Virginia saw things dif-
ferently. 
Across America, parents have re-
jected the radical liberal campaign to 
make education a ‘‘one size fits all gov-
ernment 
knows 
best’’ 
proposition. 
From coast to coast—even in deep-blue 
bastions like San Francisco—they have 
sent rogue local administrators pack-
ing and asserted their rights and re-
sponsibilities as the first and most im-
portant teachers of their children. 
Yesterday, Senate Republicans made 
clear once again that we stand with the 
parents of America. A bipartisan ma-
jority adopted Senator THUNE’s resolu-
tion of disapproval on one of the Biden 
administration’s most egregious viola-
tions of parents’ rights and kids’ well- 
being. 
Masking children as young as 2 in 
Head Start Programs across the coun-
try, including outside on the play-
ground—including outside on the play-
ground—flies in the face of what even 
the World Health Organization con-
siders settled science. And it has seri-
ously damaged parents’ confidence in 
the systems to which they entrust 
their children for hours every day. 
So I was proud to join a majority of 
my colleagues last night to express the 
Senate’s opposition to this unconscion-
able policy. Ah, but make no mistake: 
This is not the last we will hear about 
the far left’s efforts to grab more con-
trol over how America raises its kids. 
As we speak, Senate Democrats are 
trying to resurrect portions of the 
failed 
reckless 
taxing-and-spending 
spree they spent most of last year try-
ing to ram through on party lines. 
That proposal includes the Toddler 
Takeover that would stick American 
families with dramatically higher costs 
and dramatically less choice in the 
market for childcare. 
More redtape for independent pro-
viders, special subsidies for bureauc-
racies’ preferred one-size-fits-all sys-
tems, outright hostility toward the 
faith-based options that are preferred 
by a majority of families who use out-
side-the-home childcare, and nothing— 
nothing at all—for families who choose 
to have a full-time parent or another 
family member look after their kids; 
just the latest example of a massive 
overreach the American people never 
asked for. 
The Biden administration is having a 
hard enough time with basic governing 
responsibilities like national security, 
energy independence, and controlling 
inflation. American families, and espe-
cially children, will be a whole lot bet-
ter off the sooner the Democrats stop 
looking for even more ways to fail 
them. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
U.S. SUPREME COURT 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I have 
taken this time to talk about National 
Small Business Week, but because of 
the events of the last 48 hours, I need 
to comment on the Justice Alito draft 
opinion that, if it were adopted by the 
Supreme Court, would overturn Roe v. 
Wade. 
I find this draft opinion to be out-
rageous. It puts the health, well-being, 
and constitutional rights of women 
across the Nation in great jeopardy, 
particularly those low-income women. 
Thirty-six million women of repro-
ductive age would be at risk if the 
Alito opinion became the ruling of the 
Supreme Court. 
We look to our courts to protect and 
expand our constitutional protections, 
not to contract and weaken the con-
stitutional protections, reversing near-
ly 50 years of legal precedent of Roe v. 
Wade. 
What we need to do is to make sure 
that this body does everything we can 
to protect women’s rights and to pro-
tect their healthcare right to make 
their own decision. 
I am pleased that 16 States, including 
the District of Columbia, have taken 
action to protect women’s rights, in-
cluding my own State of Maryland, but 
we need to do more. We need to pass 
the Women’s Health Protection Act. I 
am a cosponsor of that—proud to be a 
cosponsor of it—which would codify 
Roe v. Wade to protect reproductive 
rights for women. I hope we will have 
the opportunity to do that. I think we 
all recognize that we have a responsi-
bility to act before the Supreme Court 
makes its ruling that could jeopardize 
the constitutional rights. 
NATIONAL SMALL BUSINESS WEEK 
Now, Mr. President, I do want to 
speak about National Small Business 
Week, which is this week, May 1 
through 7. 
I have the honor of chairing the 
Small Business and Entrepreneurship

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2295 
May 4, 2022 
Committee here in the U.S. Senate, 
and I have the opportunity as chair to 
talk about small businesses 52 weeks a 
year and to brag about what small 
businesses are doing. 
This week gives us the opportunity 
to highlight for every American the in-
credible contributions small businesses 
make to our economy. 
National Small Business Week is an 
annual reminder of how important 
small businesses are to the success of 
America. Small businesses are the life-
blood of our national economy and our 
local communities. There are more 
than 32 million small businesses across 
the Nation, and they support more 
than 61 million jobs. 
As Congress works to address the 
myriad of challenges facing our coun-
try from climate change to foreign 
conflicts, the issues facing small busi-
ness owners can be drowned out. That 
is why I asked to be a member of the 
Small Business Committee when I first 
entered the U.S. Senate in 2007. 
The committee is one of the smaller 
committees in terms of resources and 
staff, but I know that it was going to 
be a place where I could support entre-
preneurs, those in my home State of 
Maryland and nationwide, who are fo-
cused on creating the companies, prod-
ucts, services, and technologies of the 
future. 
That is where job growth will take 
place in this country. More jobs are 
created through small business than 
through larger companies. That is 
where innovation takes place in this 
country, where we find ways to deal 
with challenges, as we saw during 
COVID–19. But it is also where small 
businesses do not have the same resil-
iency to deal with downturns in our 
economy. That is why it was so impor-
tant for us to act in regard to the 
COVID–19 pandemic. 
Two years ago, as our Nation faced a 
threat of a once-in-a-century global 
pandemic, supporting our small busi-
ness owners was one of my top prior-
ities. I will always be proud of the 
swift, bipartisan action this body took 
to ensure that our vibrant small busi-
ness sector would not be a casualty of 
the COVID–19 pandemic. 
Since the beginning of the pandemic, 
Congress has created several new pro-
grams to support small businesses, in-
cluding the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram that was there to protect the 
workforce in small business; the EIDL 
Advance Grant Program, which pro-
vided some capital for small businesses 
during the pandemic and provided, 
through its loan program, the longer 
term capital that was needed during 
this period of time; the Shuttered 
Venue Operators Grant Program that 
dealt with businesses that were basi-
cally ordered to close during the pan-
demic because of the public health 
risk; the Restaurant Revitalization 
Fund that was aimed at an industry 
that was so badly devastated as a re-
sult of COVID–19 when people would 
not go out to restaurants; and several 
other initiatives that we passed during 
that period of time. 
We have appropriated more than $1 
trillion to the Small Business Adminis-
tration to fund these initiatives and 
others, and it has been critical to the 
survival of small businesses and now to 
our own economic recovery. 
Several independent studies have 
confirmed that the SBA’s implementa-
tion of these programs was largely suc-
cessful and improved over time, espe-
cially in terms of equity reaching the 
underserved 
communities. 
The 
im-
provement is the result of thoughtful 
policies Congress has implemented, as 
well as the Biden administration’s ef-
forts to invest in underserved entre-
preneurs. 
Americans registered a record-set-
ting 5.4 million new small businesses 
this last year, which was a 1-million in-
crease over the prior record of 4.4 mil-
lion. So we are responding. The small 
business community is vibrant. Even 
better, this increase is occurring in 
some of our most underserved commu-
nities with minorities—specifically mi-
nority women—driving the entrepre-
neurial surge. 
So this year’s theme for National 
Small Business Week, ‘‘Building a Bet-
ter America Through Entrepreneur-
ship,’’ could not be more fitting, and it 
should serve as a clarion call for every 
Member of Congress. 
We simply cannot let this oppor-
tunity pass us by. Instead, we in Con-
gress must tap into and bolster the en-
trepreneurial spirit that is sweeping 
our Nation to build a fairer and more 
just economy for all. 
The good news: We already know how 
we can do this because that is what we 
did during the pandemic. Several inde-
pendent studies have confirmed that 
small business relief programs we cre-
ated over the past 2 years improved 
over time. The improvement was the 
result of policies, many of which were 
bipartisan, that directly addressed the 
structural barriers that make it more 
difficult for women, minorities, and 
other underserved entrepreneurs to 
start and grow successful businesses. 
In the years ahead, Congress must le-
verage the inroads that the SBA has 
made into these previously underserved 
communities so that critical services 
and business loan products can better 
reach entrepreneurs who need them the 
most. 
The most immediate action we can 
take is to replenish the Restaurant Re-
vitalization Fund. This is a matter of 
basic fairness. There are still more 
than 177,000 outstanding applications 
for 
the 
Restaurant 
Revitalization 
Fund. These are restaurants that quali-
fied for the relief but, because there 
were not enough funds in the program 
appropriated by Congress and because 
of the original confusion on application 
priorities, they were not able to get the 
funds even though they were eligible 
and they needed the funds. In some 
States, as many as 6 in 10 requests for 
grants remain unmet. 
So Congress cannot mistake the 
hopeful indicators of recovery for a 
sign that restaurants and bars are back 
to where they were prior to the pan-
demic. They are not. Many bars and 
restaurants are still months behind on 
rent and other bills, and they also 
must deal with increased supply costs 
as a result of supply chain issues and 
labor costs. They still need our sup-
port. The need is still there, and fair-
ness requires us to act. 
I want to thank Senator WICKER for 
working with me to introduce bipar-
tisan legislation that will replenish 
this critical program and provide sup-
port to other hard-hit industries. 
In the longer term, there are three 
policies that Congress should enact to 
better support the surge of interest in 
entrepreneurship and make our econ-
omy more diverse and resilient in the 
future. 
First, Congress should create a direct 
lending program at the SBA that will 
allow for another avenue for access to 
capital, filling the current gaps in our 
financial ecosystem. A reimagined di-
rect lending program would allow en-
trepreneurs to apply directly to the 
SBA or through community lenders for 
small Federal loans. 
We know that many underserved en-
trepreneurs are discouraged even from 
applying for a business loan because of 
the high rates of rejection. Commercial 
banks tend to deal with their existing 
customers. They also tend to want 
larger loans or the larger of the small 
businesses, 
not 
the 
smaller, 
the 
startups of the small businesses. A di-
rect lending program from the SBA 
could help. 
Second, Congress should codify the 
Community Advantage loan program. 
The loan program is particularly suc-
cessful in getting capital to under-
served entrepreneurs. We have a track 
record under the Community Advan-
tage Program. It works. It reaches 
those communities that have been left 
out in the past. 
I am grateful for the Biden adminis-
tration’s recent announcement that it 
will extend the program for 2 years and 
implement changes to make the pro-
gram more helpful to underserved 
small businesses. For example, the ad-
ministration will increase the max-
imum loan size and expand the number 
of lenders in the program to provide 
loans 
to 
more 
underserved 
entre-
preneurs. 
Third, Congress should give SBA the 
tools and resources to nurture the next 
generation of entrepreneurs by cre-
ating a network of incubators and ac-
celerators on the campuses of our Na-
tion’s historically Black colleges and 
universities, minority-serving institu-
tions, and community colleges. 
In Maryland, our State HBCUs and 
community colleges play a key role in 
the entrepreneurial ecosystem. They 
are resource partners for the SBA. 
They host business incubators and ac-
celerators, and they leverage their re-
lationship with the underserved com-
munities to lift up the entrepreneurs in

those communities. We need to do the 
same on a national scale and support 
our resource partners. 
These are commonsense policies that 
will unlock the growth potential of our 
Nation’s entrepreneurs and help us to 
recover from the COVID–19 pandemic 
in a stronger, fairer way. 
As we celebrate National Small Busi-
ness Week, let us also double down on 
the investments we have made in our 
entrepreneurs over the past 2 years. 
Let us once again put partisanship 
aside and pass thoughtful legislation 
that addresses the root causes of the 
issues that our Nation’s entrepreneurs 
face on a daily basis. 
We can do this. During this week, let 
us rededicate ourselves to help Amer-
ica’s small businesses, help fairness 
and opportunity in this country, and 
help our economy grow even stronger. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
U.S. SUPREME COURT 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, Monday’s 
leak of a draft opinion in the Dobbs Su-
preme Court case was an unprece-
dented and deeply disturbing breach of 
confidentiality that almost always sur-
rounds Supreme Court deliberations. It 
is difficult to think this was anything 
but an escalation in the radical left’s 
campaign to bully the Supreme Court 
into delivering decisions in line with 
the priorities of the Democratic Party. 
From Court-packing threats to threats 
from the Democratic leader himself 
that were directed to specific Justices, 
attempting to intimidate the Supreme 
Court has become par for the course for 
liberals, but Monday’s leak represents 
a new low. 
Almost as disturbing as the leak has 
been the reaction from my Democratic 
colleagues. Their hysterical comments 
have been focused almost entirely on 
the prospect of their getting an out-
come they don’t want in the Dobbs 
case. I have seen almost no concern 
about how the leak will affect the in-
tegrity of the Supreme Court as an in-
stitution, and their activist base has 
gone out of its way to praise the 
leaker. 
More than one Democrat has actu-
ally called for undermining the integ-
rity of the Supreme Court by packing 
the Court with additional Justices. 
Yes, that is the result of what hap-
pened yesterday among Democrats. 
More than one Democratic Senator be-
lieves that the proper response to a Su-
preme Court decision you don’t like is 
to add additional Justices to the Court 
until you can be confident that you 
will get the outcomes you want. 
Other Democratic Senators have pro-
posed undermining the integrity of the 
U.S. Senate by abolishing the Senate 
filibuster rule—again, in order to be 
sure that they can get the legislative 
outcome they want in response to this 
possible decision in the Dobbs case. 
Mr. President, regardless of what side 
you are on in this debate, you should 
be willing to stand up for the rule of 
law and the integrity of our institu-
tions. That shouldn’t be a partisan 
issue. Our system of government de-
pends upon the rule of law, which is 
based upon an independent judiciary, 
free of political pressure or partisan in-
fluence. 
Do Democrats really want a future in 
which Supreme Court decisions are 
made based on political pressure or 
bullying rather than on the Justices’ 
impartial application of the law and 
the Constitution to the case before 
them? Maybe they do. But if they con-
tinue to push in that direction, they 
will end up sacrificing our system of 
government in the process. 
Mr. President, I have strong beliefs 
in any number of issues, including 
abortion, but above all, I believe in our 
system of government and in the rule 
of law. While I will fight passionately 
in support of the causes I believe in, I 
will not sacrifice the integrity of our 
institutions for what would ultimately 
be nothing but temporary political 
gain. It is starting to seem like most of 
my Democratic colleagues disagree 
with that position. That may possibly 
be a recipe for political success, but it 
is also a recipe for destroying free gov-
ernment. 
I am glad that Chief Justice Roberts 
has taken steps to investigate this un-
precedented breach of trust at the 
Court, and I hope that he will receive 
the full support of the Department of 
Justice should this turn out to be a 
criminal matter. It is difficult to over-
state how much this breach could erode 
trust among Justices and Supreme 
Court staff, and I hope the damage is 
minimized by a quick identification of 
the party responsible. I hope every one 
of the Justices will continue to feel 
free to do their jobs and follow the 
facts, the law, and the Constitution. 
At least one Democrat has suggested 
Republicans are spending more time 
commenting on the leak than on the 
content of Justice Alito’s draft because 
we are somehow scared to talk about 
our pro-life decision. Let me be per-
fectly clear: We are not. I am proud to 
defend the right to life, and I know my 
colleagues are as well. 
I think most of us have refrained 
from commenting because we don’t yet 
truly know the outcome. But I will say 
this. I hope Justice Alito’s opinion 
ends up being the majority opinion. As 
I have long believed, Roe v. Wade was 
a terrible decision by an activist Court 
that reached far beyond the Constitu-
tion and the Court’s interpretive role 
to impose a new abortion regime on the 
entire country. I hope the Supreme 
Court overturns Roe and returns the 
question of abortion to the American 
people and their elected representa-
tives, where it belongs. 
The fight to defend life is in keeping 
with our highest ideals, our passion for 
justice, 
our 
dedication 
to 
human 
rights, and our compassion for the in-
nocent and the vulnerable. I am grate-
ful for all the Americans who have 
fought to make sure the right to life of 
vulnerable human beings is protected 
and have spent their time and their re-
sources helping moms in need. I look 
forward to a day, which I hope is soon 
approaching, when innocent, unborn 
Americans will enjoy the full protec-
tion of the law. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
ENERGY 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to talk about 
the need that we have here in this 
country for more energy—and specifi-
cally, more American energy. 
On Thursday, Leader SCHUMER and 
NANCY PELOSI held a press conference, 
and they announced they had finally 
come up with an energy plan. After 
nearly a year—a year of Joe Biden’s en-
ergy crisis where he killed the Key-
stone XL Pipeline, struck down leas-
ing—it is good to see they finally have 
a plan. 
It turns out this official Democrat 
energy plan is not going to create one 
more drop of American energy. So 
what will the plan do? Well, if you look 
at it, you will see it sends bureau-
crats—unelected, 
unaccountable, 
heavy-handed bureaucrats—to shake 
down energy companies. Instead of pro-
ducing more American energy, they 
want more Federal investigations into 
American energy. 
It won’t lower the price of energy— 
no, not by a single penny. If anything, 
it might actually increase energy costs 
across our country. People in Wyoming 
this past weekend were paying $4 a gal-
lon for gasoline. It doesn’t take a Fed-
eral investigation to figure out what is 
wrong here with energy in America. We 
know why prices are up: supply and de-
mand. Very simple. Demand for energy 
is up, and supply is not. Supply is actu-
ally down. 
Yet, after a year of high prices, 
Democrats still refuse to admit it, ig-
noring inflation, not facing the facts 
that we have the American energy in 
the ground here and they won’t let us 
get it out. 
But now the Democrats are coming 
up with election-year conspiracy theo-
ries. They say high prices aren’t hap-
pening because of the law of econom-
ics. They are saying it is happening be-
cause of secret backroom deals. Demo-
crats claim it is an international con-
spiracy rigged by a global oil market.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2297 
May 4, 2022 
Instead of producing American energy, 
Democrats want to produce excuses, 
one after another. 
At the Democrat press conference, 
the majority leader said: ‘‘The Amer-
ican people didn’t send us here to point 
fingers and blame each other.’’ They 
ought to point fingers at themselves. 
That is exactly what the Democrat 
leader and the President have done for 
the last 15 months since the day Joe 
Biden took office. They blamed infla-
tion on coronavirus, then they blamed 
it on economic growth, then they 
blamed it on corporations, they blamed 
it on ports and shipping companies, 
they blamed it on Vladimir Putin, ev-
eryone except themselves who are the 
cause of the problem. 
They will blame anyone, as long as 
they don’t have to change their radical 
and reckless policies. But they won’t 
deal with the problem. Right now, 
Democrats basically point to the fact 
that they are determined to give the 
American people more of the same, and 
it is the same things that have brought 
Joe Biden’s approval numbers to an all-
time low—on the inflation, on econ-
omy, on the cost of energy—alltime 
historic lows, for a President who 
should know better but is following the 
lead of the liberal radical left. 
So people are going to be facing more 
inflation, more high energy costs. And 
it now costs so much to fill up a tank 
of gasoline; it is over a hundred dollars 
to fill up, and I saw that repeatedly 
across Wyoming last weekend. 
This is the same level of anxiety for 
hard-working families at the end of 
every month when the paychecks don’t 
keep up. On Sunday, just this past Sun-
day, the cost of diesel hit an alltime 
high. Not just a 40-year high like we 
have for inflation, an alltime high for 
diesel fuel. 
Diesel prices have doubled since Joe 
Biden took office. Higher diesel prices 
means it will cost more to transport 
goods to market. Food prices are up; 
everything that one buys at the mar-
ket is up. No matter how bad it gets, 
Democrats refuse to change course. 
Joe Biden continues to attack Amer-
ican 
energy 
and 
American 
energy 
workers. Right now, Joe Biden’s ad-
ministration are blocking oil and gas 
leases at 80 percent of the available 
Federal lands. There are thousands of 
drilling requests that are in limbo, 
which is where Joe Biden has put them. 
He has done everything possible, you 
would think, to undermine investment 
in American energy. Told the banks, 
don’t lend. Told businesses, don’t in-
vest. An attack on direct—on jobs and 
affordable energy. 
If Democrats were really serious 
about lowering energy prices, they 
would stop their war on American en-
ergy. We need to unleash American en-
ergy, not keep it in the ground. Look, 
Democrats remain the party of higher 
costs, the party of expensive regula-
tions, the party of high taxes, and the 
party of greater reliance on foreign 
countries. 
Working families cannot afford the 
Democratic agenda. People feel stuck 
or stressed. They are squeezed by infla-
tion. They are squeezed by high energy 
prices. They have to make decisions 
about how they drive and how they eat 
and what they eat and how they live. 
The 
Democratic 
policies 
have 
brought us all of this. We need to re-
place the Democratic policies; and 
come November, we are going to re-
place the Democrats in the House and 
in the Senate. 
I yield the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. CASEY. I ask unanimous consent 
to speak as if in morning business. 
The ACTING PRESIDING OFFICER. 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
UKRAINE 
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise this 
morning to express concern for the peo-
ple of Ukraine and the hundreds of mil-
lions who are going to bed hungry 
across the globe. 
Every day since that terrible day, 
February 24, we have watched in horror 
as Vladimir Putin and his army, his 
forces, 
killed 
innocent 
Ukrainians, 
over and over and over again like noth-
ing—nothing—we 
have 
seen 
since 
World War II. 
Russian forces continue to besiege 
and 
shell 
Ukrainian 
cities 
like 
Mariupol, where over the last two 
months, civilians have lived in bunkers 
under perpetual fire. These are civil-
ians in those bunkers. 
Only yesterday, 130 civilians man-
aged to escape the battered Azovstal 
steel plant. Describing the last several 
months, one evacuee said: 
You can’t imagine how scary it is when 
you sit in the shelter, in a wet and damp 
basement which is bouncing, shaking. We 
were praying to God that missiles fly over 
our shelter, because if it hit the shelter, all 
of us would be done. 
Sadly, 200 more Ukrainian civilians 
have been unable to evacuate, even as 
Russian forces began storming the 
steel mill just yesterday. So our pray-
ers are with them and the remaining 
brave Ukrainian fighters continuing to 
hold on to this plant. 
But atrocities continue across all of 
Ukraine. In Donetsk yesterday, three 
civilians were killed on their way to 
collecting water—collecting water—for 
their families. 
The United States, of course, must 
continue to help Ukraine fight against 
Mr. Putin and his forces. Mr. Putin is 
the incarnation of evil. It is as clear as 
any debate could be. 
The good news is, countries all over 
the world are unified against him. But 
we have a long way to go. Now, I and so 
many others across the House and the 
Senate strongly supported the appro-
priation that Congress made back in 
March—$13.6 billion in emergency ap-
propriations to support Ukraine, and I 
stand by President Biden’s recent $33 
billion request to help Ukraine defend 
itself over the long term. 
Unfortunately, in that first number, 
the $13.6 billion, the good news is we 
had support for that in both parties. 
But I have to say for the record: Not 
enough support on the Republican side. 
Here in the Senate, 31 Republicans 
voted against the $13.6 billion. And 
when you add up the Senate Repub-
licans voting against the $13.6 billion 
in the spending bill and add them to 
the House Republicans, which is, obvi-
ously, a much bigger number, it is 
more than 200 Members of the Repub-
lican Party in the U.S. Congress voted 
against every single penny of the $13.6 
billion for Ukraine. 
So I hope—I hope—when it comes to 
the $33 billion that I hope we will be 
able to pass—but I am sure it will be a 
number at least comparable to that. 
But whatever the number is for the 
people of Ukraine, I hope that we will 
get unanimous support in the U.S. Con-
gress. 
I hope we won’t see more than 200 
Members of Republicans in the Con-
gress voting against the people of 
Ukraine. This is not a difficult choice. 
You are either on one side or the other. 
I said Mr. Putin is the incarnation of 
evil—he is. The good news is, we have 
another choice. The other choice is Mr. 
Zelenskyy, the people of Ukraine, and 
those brave fighters in Ukraine. They 
are the personification of all that we 
claim to stand for when we talk about 
democracy. 
This isn’t a moment to theorize or to 
talk about democracy in glowing terms 
without taking actions. They are doing 
the fighting on the battlefield. The 
least that we can do is vote the right 
way. That is the power you have as a 
Member of Congress. House, Senate, 
Democrat, Republican or Independent, 
you have the power to vote. And I hope 
that we will have unanimous support 
for the $33 billion that the President 
has asked for. 
Now, what will that funding entail? I 
won’t go through all of it, but this 
funding will include $20.4 billion in ad-
ditional security and military assist-
ance for Ukraine. It is important to 
put that into context, so it is basically 
20 of the 33 will be for security and 
military assistance. That is on top of 
what has already been appropriated 
just since the battle—the war in 
Ukraine started when Russia invaded. 
With President Biden’s leadership 
and with a lot of support in the Con-
gress, we have been able to provide bil-
lions of dollars just on the military and 
security assistance, not to mention the 
humanitarian support, the sanctions, 
and the unified approach that so many 
countries around the world have taken. 
But we have a lot more to do, and in 
my judgment, the $33 billion won’t be 
enough. We are going to be back at it 
probably in a few months providing 
more. But at a minimum, we have got 
to get this done for the people of 
Ukraine. Part of that appropriation 
will be the replenishing of donated 
NATO weapons and equipment. 
This help, in total—all of this secu-
rity assistance and other humanitarian 
support—will be critical to Ukraine’s

ability 
to 
prevail—to 
prevail—over 
Russian forces through the summer 
and the fall. We must continue to pro-
vide all of the artillery, the anti-tank, 
the anti-air weapons, and air defense 
systems and other capabilities that 
Ukraine can use to block Russian 
authoritarianism 
and 
support 
the 
Ukrainian people. However, regardless 
of how much support the United 
States, NATO, and other allies and 
partners provide, we must remember 
that nothing we do—nothing we do—is 
comparable to the awesome sacrifice 
for 
freedom 
and 
democracy 
that 
Ukrainians are now making every day 
when they give their lives—they give 
their lives in this war—and have their 
own families shattered in the process. 
They are upholding—the people of 
Ukraine, those brave fighters on the 
battlefield every day, every week, 
every month now, those Ukrainians are 
upholding democracy, not just for 
themselves, not just for our country, 
but for the entire free world. 
There are, of course, other con-
sequences to this war. The war has al-
ready driven over 13 million Ukrain-
ians from their homes. These Ukrain-
ians, who are either refugees going to 
another country or internally displaced 
within Ukraine but are outside of their 
homes, that number is equal to the en-
tire population—roughly equivalent, 13 
million, to the entire population of my 
home State of Pennsylvania. Just 
imagine that, 13 million people being 
displaced. 
And, 
unfortunately, 
it 
doesn’t seem like that will be the end. 
So I want to commend the European 
Union and Ukrainian neighbors in the 
region for their warm welcome to such 
an unprecedented refugee flow from 
Ukraine. Now, recently, just two weeks 
ago, traveling through Italy, Georgia, 
and France, I saw everyday Italians, 
Georgians, Frenchmen and French-
women opening their hearts and their 
homes to Ukrainian refugees, not to 
mention the people of Poland, who 
have done so much, and so many oth-
ers. 
Just one example, in Italy, faith- 
based nonprofits like Sant’Egidio that 
we had time to meet with on our trip 
have led the way in providing support 
to those in need. 
I also commend the administration’s 
work to support these refugees across 
Europe 
and 
those 
remaining 
in 
Ukraine, much of that work funded by 
part of the $13.6 billion that Congress 
appropriated in March. 
FOOD SECURITY 
Mr. President, let me move to an-
other topic, but it is directly related to 
what we just talked about: food secu-
rity. Our work on the overall strategy, 
as it relates to the people of Ukraine 
and protecting democracy, is far from 
complete. 
The world has not yet felt the full ef-
fect—the full brunt—of the global ef-
fects of Mr. Putin’s unprovoked, unlaw-
ful, and certainly unjustified war. 
While millions of Ukrainians have al-
ready become refugees, or internally 
displaced people, there are food short-
ages in more than one-third of the 
country. By the end of the year, tens of 
millions across the globe also will face 
immediate danger from hunger. 
So this is a crisis for the people of 
Ukraine on a whole host of fronts, ob-
viously, but it is also a food security 
crisis for the world at the same time. 
The reason for that immediate dan-
ger that people face right now being 
unable to find the food that they need 
to survive is because of this invasion, 
as well as, obviously, the terrible im-
pact the pandemic has had. 
As a breadbasket of the world, before 
the war, Ukraine fed over 400 million 
people across the globe, and the greater 
Black Sea area exported more than 12 
percent of the food calories that are 
traded worldwide. The war has cut off, 
cut off, these supplies while also rais-
ing fuel and transportation costs. 
There is less food to go around, and it 
costs more to get food to those who 
need it the most. 
This comes on top of the COVID–19 
pandemic, as I mentioned, which in-
creased hunger and complicated supply 
chains and climate change effects like 
severe droughts and floods. 
It also costs more to grow food, as 
Russia 
previously 
dominated 
the 
world’s fertilizer markets. Today, both 
food and fertilizer prices have sky-
rocketed to higher than ever before, 
and the World Food Programme esti-
mates that 878 million people across 92 
countries of the world do not have ade-
quate food on their table—878 million 
people. 
Over 276 million people now face 
acute food insecurity, meaning that 
they are in immediate danger of not 
being able to find their next meal. So 
they are the ones in the most trouble 
right now all across the world—276 mil-
lion. It is not all the folks who are hun-
gry and have a food security crisis but 
those who are in immediate danger. 
Due to Putin’s horrific war, by the 
end of 2022, another 47 million people 
will likely face those same dangers—47 
million people. That will mean that 
around the world, almost as many peo-
ple as live in the entire United States 
will face immediate danger from hun-
ger. Most of these people live outside of 
Ukraine in the Middle East, Africa, 
Latin America, where any further price 
shock may put entire communities at 
risk. 
I see the distinguished majority lead-
er. Does he want me to suspend? 
I yield the floor. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader is recog-
nized. 
U.S. SUPREME COURT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I 
thank the always gracious, always 
thoughtful, always perspicacious, al-
ways persistent—and many other good 
adjectives—Senator from Pennsylvania 
for yielding. 
Now, Mr. President, there is only one 
way—only one way—to describe the 
Supreme Court’s reported decision to 
overturn Roe v. Wade: an abomination. 
Such a decision, if it comes to pass, 
would be an utter abomination. Women 
across America would suffer irrep-
arable harm to their rights, their 
health, and their dignity. It would go 
down as one of the worst and most 
damaging opinions that the Court has 
handed down in modern history, and 
the Court would suffer a mortal blow 
to its reputation that I fear will last 
forever. 
Yesterday, I pledged that Senate 
Democrats will act on legislation to 
codify Roe into law. It is vital that we 
act quickly because this is no longer an 
abstract exercise. This is as real as it 
gets, America—as real as it gets. 
Every single American is going to see 
where every single Senator stands on 
protecting a woman’s right to choose. 
And rest assured, Americans will be 
watching. 
Now, we must be clear. This week’s 
draft decision didn’t come out of no-
where. It didn’t materialize in a vacu-
um. Indeed, the blame for the end of 
Roe lies primarily right across the 
aisle here with Senate Republicans. 
The Supreme Court’s decision to 
overturn Roe would never have been 
possible without Leader MCCONNELL 
and Senate Republicans spending years 
packing our courts with hard-right 
judges, judges who came from a list 
under the Trump years that the Fed-
eralist Society approved. And the Fed-
eralist Society’s purpose, when it was 
put into action, from what I have read, 
is to repeal Roe. And the Republicans 
on this side of the aisle, right there, 
were willing—willing—accomplices in 
that deed. 
Let me say it again. The Supreme 
Court’s decision to overturn Roe would 
have never been possible without Lead-
er MCCONNELL and Senate Republicans 
spending years packing our courts with 
hard-right judges. 
Now, Republicans are twisting them-
selves into pretzels, trying to distract 
from this truth. Yesterday, Leader 
MCCONNELL said that the real story 
was somehow the leaks and not the end 
of Roe. 
Can you believe that? The leaks are 
more important than the rights of 100 
million American women? Give me a 
break. 
And when Leader MCCONNELL
evi-
dently was asked at his press con-
ference yesterday: Are you glad Roe 
would be repealed, he wouldn’t even an-
swer that, even though he had worked 
years to do it, because they know 
where history is going. They know 
where the American people are. They 
know they are on the wrong side of 
both so they are trying to ‘‘low key’’ 
it. 
Republicans have spent decades try-
ing to achieve the end of Roe, and now 
that they are about to succeed, they 
are flailing around, talking about a 
leak instead of owning up to their own 
actions. We won’t let them. We know, 
all of us, why Republicans are spending

all their focus on the leak. It is because 
they don’t want to focus on Roe, where, 
again, they are on the wrong side of 
history and the wrong side of the 
American people. 
Their hypocrisy and refusal to own 
this decision is utterly shameful. The 
end of a constitutional right to choose 
is not some small or inconsequential 
subject; it is huge. It touches on one of 
the most personal, most private, most 
important decisions a woman can make 
regarding her body. 
So it is worth saying again: Without 
Senate Republicans working years to 
pack our courts, without them chang-
ing the rules of the Senate to confirm 
three ideological Justices, Roe would 
not—would not—be on the brink of 
being overturned. 
And don’t take my word for it. Lead-
er MCCONNELL
himself expected and 
hoped for this outcome. When asked in 
2019 
what 
confirming 
President 
Trump’s Justices meant for the anti-
abortion movement, he said: 
There are a number of [States] who have 
enacted new legislation [that] would be 
winding its way up through the courts and 
[it] gives us an opportunity to begin to pick 
away at Roe v. Wade. 
‘‘Pick away at Roe v. Wade.’’ 
So what the Court did was not an ab-
erration; it was a plan, a plan by Sen-
ate Republicans, a plan by Leader 
MCCONNELL. 
Senate 
Republicans 
spent 
years 
rubberstamping 
one 
radical 
Trump 
judge after another onto the Federal 
bench in order to ‘‘pick away at Roe.’’ 
Many of these judges were wildly un-
qualified. Many of them were out of 
step—far out of step—from the Amer-
ican mainstream. 
What is more, every single Repub-
lican also changed Senate rules to con-
firm not one, not two, but three Trump 
Justices to the U.S. Supreme Court, as-
suring a 6-to-3 conservative majority. 
Some of these Justices lied to the Sen-
ate by misrepresenting their views on 
respecting precedent when it came to 
decisions like Roe. 
And, of course, after the death of 
Justice 
Scalia, 
Leader 
MCCONNELL 
took the unprecedented and truly de-
structive step of preventing the Senate 
from considering the nomination of 
Merrick Garland. 
So nobody here should be fooled. No-
body in America should be fooled. The 
Republican leader might not say it, but 
the end of Roe is a culmination of ac-
tions taken by the Republican leader 
and the Republican Party writ large to 
skew our courts with hard-right, ideo-
logical, vehemently anti-choice judges. 
And now that they are close to suc-
ceeding, they can’t even bring them-
selves to own up to their own actions 
because they know—they know—just 
how strongly the American people op-
pose restricting the right to choose. 
But this is not the end of the story. 
Republicans cannot hide from the 
American people and cannot hide their 
role in bringing Roe to an end. They 
will have to answer to the people this 
month, this year, and especially this 
November, when American voters go to 
the polls. And we are going to vote 
here in the Senate to make clear where 
every single Member stands on the 
right to choose. 
Few issues—few issues—are as per-
sonal, as private, and as important to 
Americans as whether or not to have 
an abortion. The Nation will be watch-
ing to see who in this Chamber will de-
fend this precious right to choose and 
who will stand with the Roberts Court 
to destroy this right in one fell swoop. 
BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Mr. President, now, on another sub-
ject—on a very different subject—to-
night, the Senate—or, this afternoon, 
the Senate will begin holding votes on 
as many as 28 motions to instruct be-
fore the conference committee begins 
the work of finalizing our jobs and 
competition bill. 
Twenty of those motions to instruct 
come from Republicans, a sign of the 
immense good faith Democrats have 
shown Republicans in getting this bill 
over the finish line. 
For the information of all Members, 
we are going to be voting late into the 
night to get through as many of the 
motions to instruct as we can. I ask 
Members to vote quickly, to stay near 
the floor, so we can keep the process 
moving smoothly and as quickly as we 
can on the floor of the Senate. 
Once again, I thank my dear col-
league from Pennsylvania for yielding. 
I yield the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Pennsylvania. 
FOOD SECURITY 
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I thank 
the majority leader. 
I will resume my comments about 
food security. 
As I mentioned earlier, across the 
world now, we not only have 276 mil-
lion people who now face acute food in-
security—as I said, meaning that they 
are in immediate danger of not being 
able to find their next meal—but what 
is ahead is an exacerbation of that 
problem. Another 47 million people will 
likely face these same dangers by the 
end of this year. 
So a food security problem, which 
was a substantial problem before the 
pandemic, made ever worse by the pan-
demic, has gotten much worse because 
of the war in Ukraine—all caused by an 
attack on a sovereign country by a 
brutal dictator, Mr. Putin. 
So this is one of the many reasons 
why this war in Ukraine—or why all of 
us, I should say, across the free world 
have a stake in what happens in 
Ukraine. 
I wanted to also highlight what the 
United States is doing in the midst of 
this terrible food insecurity crisis. 
We can’t afford to forget and should 
not forget about the tens of millions 
who are struggling to survive as a re-
sult of this invasion. To feed all of 
those in need, the World Food Pro-
gramme, which does such good work all 
across the globe—goes into conflict 
zones to provide food to people—that 
program estimates it will take more 
than $18 billion. 
The United States must not share 
this burden alone, but if we don’t lead 
the way, no one will. That is true in so 
many instances. It is true with regard 
to the President’s leadership against 
Mr. Putin by helping the people of 
Ukraine; it is also true in terms of 
American leadership on food security. 
President Biden’s request for $33 bil-
lion for all aspects of the challenge in 
Ukraine doesn’t include enough, in my 
judgment. It includes $1.6 billion for 
food security and humanitarian assist-
ance. Now, that sounds like a lot of 
money, but it is not enough to meet 
the moment. 
And despite my consistent urging, 
Congress has appropriated flat funding 
for the U.S. food security program, 
Feed the Future, over the last 10 years. 
Adjusting for inflation, the program 
has been cut by almost a third of its 
total programming, from almost $1.5 
billion in today’s dollars to just over $1 
billion. 
So, today, we face the same global 
food crisis which the Feed the Future 
Program was originally created to ad-
dress after the 2008 recession. So after 
a recession, we had a global food secu-
rity challenge, and now after a pan-
demic, and exacerbated by the war in 
Ukraine, we have potentially an even 
greater challenge. 
So we must again rise to the chal-
lenge. When I say ‘‘we,’’ I mean the 
U.S. Government, the Congress, the 
branch of our government that appro-
priates money, has to rise to the chal-
lenge by providing the resources that 
are necessary to feed those who face 
famine—not just missing a meal here 
and there, famine itself. 
We 
have 
got 
to 
support 
these 
smallholder farmers, who are the back-
bone of the world’s food supply, and 
sustainably strengthen food systems to 
protect against the next war, the next 
pandemic, the next drought, or the 
next flood. 
So that is why I am leading a letter 
to appropriators urging robust funding 
of all—all—global food security ac-
counts in the fiscal year 2023 budget, 
specifically calling for an almost $200 
million increase just for the Feed the 
Future Program, not to mention those 
other global food security programs 
and accounts. 
This funding will only put a dent in 
the growing food security crisis, but it 
will inspire our allies and our partners 
to follow us. America leads the world 
in so many ways, and, fortunately, 
most of the time on food security we 
have led the world as well. 
We need to do that again. We need to 
lay the groundwork for a more secure 
food future and save tens and tens of 
thousands of lives—potentially a lot 
more than that—in the immediate fu-
ture. 
NATIONAL CRITICAL CAPABILITIES DEFENSE ACT 
Mr. President, I will move to one 
final topic before I conclude. This is a

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2300 
May 4, 2022 
topic we are hearing more about be-
cause of the pandemic and because of 
legislation we are working on right 
now. 
Today and tomorrow, as the majority 
leader made reference to, we are going 
to be voting here in the Senate on 
measures ahead of a conference—kind 
of a coming together of the House and 
Senate—to work out differences on 
landmark legislation aimed at address-
ing U.S. economic competition with 
the Chinese Communist Party and in-
vesting in American workers. 
As the House and Senate proceed to 
this conference on the Senate-passed 
U.S. Innovation and Competition Act 
and the House version, which is called 
the COMPETES Act, I urge bipartisan 
leadership in both the House and the 
Senate to negotiate in good faith and 
ensure substantive provisions that sup-
port the interests of American work-
ers, supply chains, and security. 
Key among these provisions in the 
trade title is the House COMPETES 
Act and within it, the bipartisan, bi-
cameral National Critical Capabilities 
Defense Act, which both Senator COR-
NYN and I wrote and have led the effort 
on to pass this legislation. In the 
House, Representatives PASCRELL and 
DELAURO have worked on this as well. 
The pandemic exacerbated a problem 
that has been decades in the making. 
Here it is: The United States has ceded 
its manufacturing power to other coun-
tries—especially countries like China— 
that don’t play by the rules. From the 
PPE shortages that we all know so 
much about at the beginning of the 
pandemic—I mean, we couldn’t even 
provide enough masks, gloves, and 
gowns for our own people. That was an 
American failure that was long in the 
making. 
We 
cannot—cannot—allow 
that to happen. But, of course, PPE 
doesn’t end the story; we have ceded 
our manufacturing power to other 
parts of the world in so many other 
ways. 
For 
too 
long, 
corporations 
have 
prioritized their profits over anything 
else. They have prioritized those prof-
its by offshoring their manufacturing 
to countries with low labor standards 
that 
undercut 
American 
workers, 
thereby lowering the cost of design and 
production all across the board. So 
offshoring our manufacturing capabili-
ties—the best in the world, I would 
argue—why would we offshore it like 
we have over a generation? Offshoring 
our supply chain has gotten so bad that 
it is now putting our economic security 
at risk, but it is also putting our na-
tional security at risk. 
The issue is that we don’t even know 
how bad the problem is. At its core, 
this bill, the National Critical Capa-
bilities Defense Act, is a transparency 
effort. We need to know how much we 
are relying on foreign adversaries for 
both the design and manufacturing of 
goods that are critical to our economic 
and national security interests. Once 
we know that, we can start investing in 
domestic manufacturing strategically, 
which will lower costs for families, pro-
vide good-paying jobs to American 
workers, and ensure that we are no 
longer relying on adversaries for the 
basic functions of our economy. 
This is a commonsense policy, and 
that is why this bill has bipartisan sup-
port in the House and the Senate. 
Members of the Senate are coming to-
gether on this who often don’t agree on 
much but agree that we have to protect 
our manufacturing base. We cannot be 
at the mercy of other countries in a 
pandemic or more generally when it 
comes to our economic interests but 
also our security interests. 
That is why Biden administration of-
ficials, from the National Security Ad-
visor to the Secretary of Commerce, 
have acknowledged a need to review 
outbound investment. Even former Na-
tional Security Advisor H.R. McMaster 
proposed some form of a government 
outbound investment review mecha-
nism. 
I recognize that this is not an easy 
problem to solve. It is not an easy 
mechanism to create within the bu-
reaucracy of the Federal Government. 
But this critical moment calls for hav-
ing to do the hard work to ensure that 
we are meeting the economic and na-
tional security challenges of the day. 
This is a moment to do the work to 
set our government and the American 
people up for success in a world where 
the Chinese Communist Party will con-
tinue to incentivize American invest-
ment into that country and away from 
the United States, thereby eroding the 
foundation of American power, which 
is leveraging our economic might to 
uphold liberal Democratic norms—the 
same norms that are being challenged 
every day in places like Ukraine. 
So this is why I urge my colleagues 
in leadership to work with me and to 
work with others in a bipartisan, bi-
cameral effort to negotiate and ham-
mer out the details of this legislation 
and to ensure the inclusion of this crit-
ical legislation in a final competitive-
ness package. 
If a company is outsourcing tech-
nology, outsourcing a product that 
compromises or has the potential to 
compromise our national security, we 
not only should know about that, but 
we should have the opportunity as a 
government whose first duty is to pro-
tect our national security. That same 
Government, the U.S. Government, 
should be able to review those trans-
actions and make a determination 
about whether or not that outsourcing 
will put us at a disadvantage. That is a 
reasonable request for people in both 
parties, both Houses, and the adminis-
tration, and it is about time we did 
this. It is long overdue. 
So this isn’t simply that we couldn’t 
make enough masks and had to rely 
upon other countries in a pandemic. 
That was bad enough. That was embar-
rassing enough. This is a lot more than 
PPE; this is about our economic secu-
rity and our national security. 
There is no reason why those kinds of 
investments 
that 
companies 
make 
every 
day—sometimes 
without 
any 
thought about what it will do to our se-
curity—there is no reason why that 
shouldn’t be the subject of an appro-
priate review to protect our national 
security. 
With that, I would yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
REMEMBERING ORRIN G. HATCH 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, much 
has already been said on this floor as 
we express our love and admiration for 
our friend and former colleague, Sen-
ator Orrin Hatch of Utah. He was not 
like any other Senator. Orrin was the 
best of all of us, and our household is 
very sad to hear of his passing. 
I will never forget the time he took 
to answer calls from an obscure State 
senator from Oklahoma. If you haven’t 
figured it out, that was me. He had a 
way about him with everyone he met, 
an unwavering kindness and gentle na-
ture that Kay and I will miss deeply. 
You don’t see a lot of that in the U.S. 
Senate. We were close long before I was 
even in the House. Orrin was the one 
whom I would go to for wisdom. We had 
the same love for Jesus and everything 
that we hold dear. 
I will always remember his humor, 
but he also gave his best advice. He was 
not just a friend but a confidante. 
Whether he was talking about Scrip-
ture or history, he had a way of saying 
things that brought people together. 
You don’t see that today. You see peo-
ple fighting each other, and that is 
what people always say. When I go 
back home to Oklahoma, people talk 
about, why don’t you guys get along? 
Well, we do. It just doesn’t come across 
that way. But it did with him. 
I think back fondly on everything 
that we did while Orrin was in office. 
Despite strong opposition at the time, 
myself and Senators Hatch, Chambliss, 
and THUNE were able to pass an amend-
ment permitting the Air Force to enter 
into a multiyear procurement for a 
total of 60 F–22s during the 2007 NDAA. 
The NDAA is something we pass every 
year. It is the National Defense Au-
thorization Act. And that happened 
that year. Now, that turned out to be 
one-third of our total force in one ef-
fort, one NDAA effort. 
The argument against the amend-
ment at the time was that we didn’t 
need such an air-dominant fighter, but 
we knew we were making an invest-
ment in the future of our defense. Orrin 
had that foresight. He was always look-
ing to the future. In advancing years,

people would joke around about it be-
cause he was looking at the next gen-
eration. He showed that foresight al-
ways when others didn’t. 
Not only that, but together we 
worked very closely to ensure the fu-
ture of our Air Force depots. I remem-
ber the codel. A codel is a group of 
Members who go someplace to examine 
things. I led a group codel, along with 
Senator Hatch and Senator Chambliss, 
which toured each one of our depots as 
part of the initiative to restore their 
funding. This is something that we had 
to do at that time because our previous 
administration had not done an ade-
quate job. 
Now, Orrin—you know, you think of 
him as always a serious person. He 
wasn’t. Most of the time, he was pok-
ing fun at himself. I remember laugh-
ing often when he was around. To-
gether, we supported funding for these 
Air Force depots that continue to be 
vital to our home States of Oklahoma, 
Utah, and Georgia, but we had fun 
while doing it. That was Orrin’s way of 
doing it. He always had fun. 
For those of you who are not familiar 
with our Nation’s depots, they are 
state-of-the-art maintenance and re-
pair facilities for the Air Force’s air-
craft. We do this ourselves because we 
can’t trust anyone else to get them 
done. Simply put, our Nation would 
not be able to rule the skies without 
the critical maintenance and repair 
work that is performed on our incred-
ibly complex aircraft. 
To ensure our Nation will always 
have our Nation’s depots, there are 
laws commonly called core and 50/50 
laws which preserve the depots’ main-
tenance. I know that a lot of people are 
not familiar with the term ‘‘depot,’’ 
but it is critically important for our 
survival. 
Throughout my tenure on the Senate 
Armed Services Committee, I greatly 
appreciated the legal analysis that 
Senator Hatch provided my staff and 
me when the executive branch would 
send over suggested changes to these 
critical laws. 
Now, there were many times when, 
after reading those proposals, Senator 
Hatch would raise the alarm, and my 
colleagues on the Senate Armed Serv-
ices Committee and I would then turn 
to do battle, and sometimes we had to 
do what was necessary, but we did it 
together. 
After the Obama administration can-
celed the NASA project Constellation, 
which was supposed to replace the 
space shuttle, there was a real question 
whether the civilian solid rocket motor 
industry, which employs thousands of 
people in Utah, was going to survive. 
Obviously it did survive, and that was 
due to Orrin Hatch. Using his consider-
able legislative skills, Senator Hatch 
was able to insert language in the fis-
cal year 2010 National Defense Author-
ization Act that directed the new 
heavy-lift Space Launch System be 
built to lift, from inception, 130 tons— 
an objective which at the time could 
only be accomplished by using solid 
rocket motors. 
And he did it. He did it. He looked 
out into the future. This is back when 
he was actually in advanced years him-
self. As a result, a few weeks ago, 
NASA rolled the SLS out to the launch 
pad for testing before it carries the as-
tronauts to the Moon in what is pro-
jected to be 2025. 
I was also very impressed by how 
Senator Hatch used his prominence to 
promote the use of Hill Air Force Base. 
Whenever there was an Air Force offi-
cial within hearing distance, Senator 
Hatch would espouse the strength and 
capabilities of the Hill, Ogden Air Lo-
gistics Complex, and he did so very per-
suasively. The results were there, and 
he was the guy who did it. In fact, I 
honestly believe that one of the rea-
sons Hill was chosen to receive the 
first three squadrons of F–35s is that 
Orrin Hatch was always advocating for 
Hill with the Air Force senior leader-
ship. 
Now, one of the things that I loved 
about Orrin Hatch was his placement 
of obscure words into many of his 
speeches. He would say things that 
were so obscure that no one would 
know what he was talking about. No 
one in the Senate wanted to believe 
that they didn’t understand what he 
was talking about, but they didn’t. He 
would use words that no one really had 
any idea what they meant. I actually 
wrote these down some time ago. 
‘‘Bovarism.’’ That was defined, by 
him, as having an exaggerated, espe-
cially glamorized, estimate of oneself. I 
think we know what we are talking 
about there. 
‘‘Cockalorum’’ is a small man with a 
big opinion of himself. We know that. 
‘‘Furphy’’ is a false report or a 
rumor. 
When asked why he insisted on using 
that kind of vocabulary, Senator Hatch 
would beam his boyish grin and chuck-
le and respond: 
I like confusing the Democrats. 
He had a very peculiar way of trying 
to get to know volunteers. He would 
get people who had no status in life. He 
would have people who were driving 
cars. Many of them were young people 
who were escorting him to different 
places just to make speeches or some-
thing. He had a peculiar way of trying 
to get to know volunteers—people who 
no one else paid any attention to. If 
they were driving him to events, with-
out fail, he would always compliment 
the volunteer about his car. It could be 
an old junker car, but, nonetheless, he 
would talk about it because he knew 
young people were proud of their cars. 
I am talking about the young volun-
teer could have been driving a 50-year- 
old 
Yugo, 
with 
the 
floor 
rusted 
through, but I can assure you that Sen-
ator Hatch would find something nice 
to say about the volunteer’s car. 
My personal opinion is that one of 
the best ways to know someone is to 
listen to him pray. When we address 
our Creator, we reveal who we really 
are. Many of us waited around and lis-
tened and waited for Orrin to give one 
of his prayers. He had that kind of a 
love that everyone enjoyed. For those 
who have listened to this or who have 
read this record, I want to present the 
genuine Orrin Hatch to you—a person 
whom we all came to know and love. 
In 2010, Senator Hatch was chosen to 
say the main prayer at the 57th Na-
tional Prayer Breakfast here in Wash-
ington. It has been going on for 60 
years, and we have had our 60th now. 
This is something that will last for-
ever. 
I ask unanimous consent to have 
printed in the RECORD, at the conclu-
sion of my remarks, the full text of 
Senator Hatch’s prayer for peace and 
tranquility in front of that crowd of 
4,000 people on that February morning 
12 years ago. 
Today, I believe Orrin Hatch fully en-
joys the peace and tranquility that he 
prayed for. All of that is to say, Orrin 
Hatch will be missed dearly by me and 
by the many friends of Orrin Hatch’s. 
We have lost a true hero and one of my 
closest personal friends. Kay and I are 
praying for Elaine and their family and 
loved ones as they go through this dif-
ficult time. 
So today is goodbye to my friend. 
God bless you, Orrin Hatch. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
‘‘Let us pray. As we bow our heads this 
morning before Thee, we are so grateful for 
this great nation, and for the nations of the 
world and especially for the opportunities we 
have as a nation to bring peace and content-
ment and tranquility throughout this world. 
We are grateful for our great leaders and 
pray Thou will bless them. We pray that 
Thou will bless our President and our Vice 
President and their cabinet. And all the lead-
ers throughout the federal government, that 
they might be inspired to lead us to do the 
things that are righteous in Thy sight. That 
we might be able to be good followers and 
that we might be able to bind together to do 
what is right. As Moses’ father-in-law told 
him, let’s share the responsibility and let’s 
work together in the best interests of our 
country. Let’s have bipartisanship reborn 
again in this great nation. We are so grateful 
for those who serve in the military, who are 
represented here today and throughout this 
country. We are grateful for all the sacrifices 
that they undertake on our behalf. We are 
grateful for those who are in harm’s way and 
we pray Thou will pour out Thy special 
blessing upon them, that they may be 
blessed and protected. And we pray that we 
might be a nation that will help bring peace 
and tranquility throughout the world. We 
are grateful for all the food, clothing and 
shelter that Thou hast provided for us. We 
are grateful for those who serve in govern-
ments throughout the states and the respec-
tive state legislatures. And last but not 
least, we are grateful for the Congress of the 
United States and pray that the Congress 
might be able to work together, as Demo-
crats and Republicans and Independents, to 
serve Thee and serve our country and to 
serve our fellow men and women. And bring 
peace and content to this great nation and 
throughout the world. We pray at this time 
for those who are suffering in Haiti and else-
where throughout the world and ask you to 
bless them and help them and help us to do

Mr. INHOFE. I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
HICKENLOOPER). The Senator from Ne-
braska. 
RUSSIA AND CHINA 
Mr. SASSE. Mr. President, Ukraine’s 
struggle against Russia’s invasion has 
reminded Americans that, sometimes, 
the world divides into good and evil 
and into heroes and villains. Not al-
ways. There are many fights that are 
not like that, and we just stupidly talk 
like it. Debates about marginal tax 
policy are not good versus evil or he-
roes versus villains; but, sometimes, 
fights are heroes versus villains. 
Heroes are men and women who love 
their country and who love their free-
dom and who want to pass along free-
dom to the next generation, but they 
are also people who believe in freedom 
more broadly. Heroes are people who 
believe that we were created in the 
image of God and that everyone has 
unalienable rights: the rights to life, 
liberty, speech, religion, assembly, pro-
test. 
These 
are 
pre-governmental 
rights. Governments don’t give us 
these rights; we are endowed with 
these rights by nature and nature’s 
Creator. Heroes recognize this not only 
about themselves and their own coun-
trymen and -women but about every-
body. Zelenskyy is such a hero. 
The villains are tyrants. They are 
people who want to oppress others, who 
want to hold them down. They want to 
take freedom from their countrymen 
but also from their neighbors. They are 
people who seek power at the expense 
of the weak. Putin is such a villain. 
But there is another villain in this 
drama, a villain who isn’t getting near-
ly enough attention, and he is Chair-
man Xi, the dictator in China. His Chi-
nese Communist Party has enabled him 
to do all sorts of oppressive things 
against men and women in his country. 
We 
know 
what 
is 
happening 
in 
Xinjiang—there is actually a genocide 
happening against the Uighurs in our 
time—but Xi is doing more than just 
oppressing people at home. 
A hundred years from now, when the 
history of the Russian invasion of 
Ukraine is written, assuming that it 
isn’t written as Chinese propaganda, I 
am confident that the public will have 
a much clearer understanding of the 
way that Xi and Putin have worked to-
gether and have worked together close-
ly. We can’t talk here about everything 
we know in the Intelligence Com-
mittee, but I am confident that, when 
the history is written, the American 
people and the people of the world will 
see Xi and Putin as having worked 
hand in hand, side by side. 
Americans should understand this 
today: Chairman Xi is not indifferent 
about Ukraine. He is on Putin’s side, 
and 
he 
has 
supported 
Putin’s 
unprovoked war. 
The situation in Ukraine reminds us 
of a pretty good rule for 21st century 
foreign policy, and it is this: The Chi-
nese Communist Party is almost al-
ways on the wrong side of freedom and 
human dignity. 
The CCP and the United States are in 
the middle of a global conflict of vi-
sions. It is important for us in this 
Chamber not to say ‘‘the United States 
and China’’ as if we mean 330 million 
Americans and 1.4 billion Chinese are 
locked in a battle; but the U.S. vision, 
the American idea, is in conflict with 
the vision of the Chinese Communist 
Party and the ways that they want to 
oppress not just their neighbors but 
their own citizens. The CCP and the 
U.S. are locked in a global conflict of 
visions, and that is true whether DC 
politicians want to admit it every day 
or not, and sometimes it seems conven-
ient for folks not to admit it. 
It is the free peoples of the world— 
NATO allies, Ukrainians, and other 
freedom 
lovers—who 
are 
fighting 
against a handful of totalitarian re-
gimes—chiefly, Putin’s Russia and Xi’s 
Chinese Communist Party. These are 
the folks who are terrorizing not just 
their own people but their neighbors. 
This contest is a contest between lib-
erty and tyranny. Not every fight is, 
but this one is; and you had damned 
well better believe that the tyrants are 
working together strategically and in-
tentionally to undermine freedom. 
So let’s back up to February 4. 
The Winter Olympics had just begun, 
and Vladimir Putin was in China to 
visit Chairman Xi. Together, they re-
leased what they called a ‘‘joint state-
ment’’ announcing a new partnership 
with ‘‘no limits.’’ The Xi-Putin state-
ment said there would be no limits in 
their partnership against the United 
States. They promised that they would 
work together to promote each other’s 
economic and national security inter-
ests even as Putin was amassing forces 
on the border of Ukraine and preparing 
for his invasion. Xi was not unaware of 
what Putin was planning when he re-
leased and signed the ‘‘no limits’’ 
statement. 
Here is why this is strange: Histori-
cally, Russia and China have not been 
friends. For centuries, these two coun-
tries have clashed with one another. 
During the Cold War, not even shared 
communist ideology could unite China 
and Russia for very long. The CCP 
studied the collapse of the Soviet 
Union to learn how to keep a com-
munist regime afloat, and they have 
been very adept at using new tech-
nologies not to advance human free-
dom but to squash human freedom. 
Now, though, the historic rivals have 
found something they have in common. 
Both Putin and Xi hate the United 
States and hate, most fundamentally, 
our ideas of the dignity of every indi-
vidual having been created in the 
image of God. 
Let’s do a little geography. 
Russia and China share nearly 3,000 
miles of common border. Russia is a 
giant. It has 11 time zones. Think 
about that. If you look at your globe of 
the world and spin it all the way 
around, you will get 24 time zones. 
Russia spans 11 of them. Russia is 
about 11 percent of the area of land on 
Earth. There are 5 countries that have 
about 6 percent: China is one; the U.S. 
is one; Canada is one—and India. So 
Russia has 11 percent, and 5 countries 
have about 6 percent. No other country 
has more than about 2 percent of the 
land mass of Earth. 
The Russian-Chinese border has his-
torically 
been 
complicated 
because 
they haven’t gotten along, but as he 
planned to launch his wicked invasion 
of Ukraine, Putin needed to move 
troops and materiel all the way from 
the border with China in the East back 
into Europe in the West. And he 
couldn’t do that—he couldn’t leave this 
giant border unguarded—unless Chair-
man Xi said: We don’t have any prob-
lems right now. And that is exactly 
what happened. Xi agreed that he 
would be on the same page with Putin 
as Putin took all of his troops and all 
of his materiel back from this histori-
cally contested border to use against 
the free people of Ukraine. 
From the beginning of this crisis, 
Chairman Xi has been in lockstep with 
Putin. The New York Times writes in 
some impressive reporting that Xi even 
asked Putin to delay the invasion until 
after the Olympics ended, which Putin 
ultimately did. 
One of the biggest ways China has 
supported Russia through all of this is 
by amplifying Russian lies and propa-
ganda about the war. Chinese Com-
munist Party propagandists, such as 
Wang Yi, have done everything from 
blaming the United States and NATO 
for the war to playing up Russia’s unre-
alistic security demands, to echoing 
lies about Ukrainian biolabs. 
Xi’s henchmen and CCP-controlled 
state media have always been there to 
amplify Putin’s falsehoods. Some of 
the stuff Putin is saying at home is 
laughably absurd even to the hosts of 
state TV, who are paid to read these 
scripts. Yet Xi has been willing to take 
all of it, translate it into Mandarin, 
and pump it into China to make sure 
the people in China don’t have an accu-
rate understanding of what is hap-
pening between Russia and Ukraine. 
The CCP’s state media have been try-
ing to tell the world repeated untrue 
stories about Russia, and they now 
cover up the atrocities and horrors 
that have been committed by Russian 
troops against Ukrainian civilians. 
The propagandizing is obviously des-
picable, but the diplomatic support the 
CCP is providing Russia is even more 
dangerous. Through the COVID pan-
demic, we saw how China tried to ma-
nipulate 
international 
organizations 
like the WHO to promote their own 
narrative and to bully other countries. 
During the invasion of Ukraine, they 
have done the same thing on behalf of 
Putin.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2303 
May 4, 2022 
The Chinese foreign ministry has 
participated in the consistent spread-
ing of lies about the war through and 
to other international organizations. 
At the U.N., Chinese diplomats have 
worked tirelessly to provide cover for 
Russian crimes and to enable Putin’s 
invasion. They have spurned the pleas 
of Ukraine and other European coun-
tries to try to help restore the peace. 
And just a couple of weeks ago, Chi-
na’s vice minister met with the Rus-
sian Ambassador to announce the re-
gimes will ‘‘continue to strengthen 
strategic coordination with Russia.’’ 
Statements like these have become 
characteristic of the twisted friendship 
that has developed between these two 
aggressor nations and what they call 
their ‘‘no-limits friendship.’’ 
China has also attempted to bail out 
Russia and to save their economy from 
the crippling sanctions that we and our 
allies have imposed since the beginning 
of this invasion. As soon as the sanc-
tions were imposed, Chinese banks 
were looking for work-arounds so they 
could keep doing business with Russia, 
partly for their own interests but 
largely to help stabilize and subsidize 
Russia. 
Russian 
banks 
issued 
Chinese 
UnionPay 
cards, 
after 
Visa 
and 
Mastercard pulled out of the country, 
and ordered Chinese currency savings 
accounts. China was already in the cur-
rency manipulation business, but since 
February, they have been using their 
talents not just to prop up their own 
currency but also to keep the ruble 
from flaming out. And while other free 
countries have begun shunning Rus-
sia’s 
energy 
sector, China’s state- 
owned energy companies have contin-
ued to conduct what they call ‘‘normal 
trading 
cooperation’’ 
with 
Russia, 
looking for ways to expand and eat up 
more of the Russian supply. 
But China hasn’t only been sup-
porting Putin indirectly. Chairman Xi 
has also aided Putin’s invasion of 
Ukraine directly. The Times of London 
reported at the beginning of April that 
China launched a massive cyber attack 
on Kyiv mere days before Putin in-
vaded. Think about that. The Chinese 
Government was involved in a cyber 
attack against free Ukraine to help 
Russia. 
As the Russian army has struggled, 
Putin has asked Xi for direct military 
assistance, and Xi is reportedly delib-
erating about how he can do more, hop-
ing the international community won’t 
notice. We should notice. We should 
amplify what Xi is doing. He is aiding 
and 
abetting 
Russia’s 
war 
crimes 
against civilians. 
Here is the fact: Putin and Xi are 
tied at the hip. China regularly claims 
that it stands for the principles of 
state sovereignty, territorial integrity, 
and noninterference in domestic af-
fairs. Yet China has supported and pro-
vided diplomatic cover for Russia’s il-
legal, immoral, and unprovoked war 
against Ukraine every step of the way. 
Now there is the chance that Team 
Zelenskyy could win, and so what has 
Xi done in response? He has decided to 
convene meetings to figure out how he 
can amp up support for Putin. 
We should be asking ourselves: Why 
is Chairman Xi so supportive of this in-
vasion? Part of the reason is because 
Vladimir Putin is running a scout team 
offense for Chairman Xi’s eventual 
planned invasion of Taiwan. Xi wants 
to learn everything he can about how 
democracies and free peoples will re-
spond and how democracies defend 
themselves so that he can try to de-
velop strategies to beat us and to beat 
our allies. 
Xi also wants Putin to win because 
he thinks this will demoralize Taiwan 
and the rest of the free world. He wants 
to be able to tell a story where the age 
of America, where the age of freedom is 
over. Xi wants to plunge the globe into 
a new dark age—an age of surveillance 
state totalitarianism. And step one at 
this moment is destroying the friends 
of Ukraine. 
We shouldn’t deceive ourselves. What 
we are seeing in Ukraine is a contest 
between freedom and tyranny. It is not 
in our national interest to see the ty-
rants triumph. We need to show the 
world that the forces arrayed by Putin 
and Xi cannot defeat the bravery of 
men and women who want to live free 
and who believe in freedom. 
Zelenskyy and Ukraine’s heroes have 
a chance to smash the new Russia- 
China axis, but they need our support. 
Standing up to Putin and helping 
Ukraine is important for its own sake, 
but it is also important because this is 
the opening skirmish in a larger con-
frontation between tyranny and lib-
erty, between Chinese communists and 
the American idea. 
Will the United States continue to 
lead the world toward peace and free-
dom, or will tyrant Xi and his CCP 
have the chance to impose their totali-
tarianism on weaker countries around 
the Pacific? 
Today in Ukraine, it is easy to see 
the line between good and evil, and 
that is why it is time for us to step up, 
to help Ukraine, but also to tell the 
world who Chairman Xi is, what he be-
lieves, what he has done on Putin’s be-
half, and why he is on Putin’s side. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
U.S. SUPREME COURT 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, Justice 
Alito’s draft opinion in Dobbs v. Jack-
son Women’s Health is a masterpiece of 
jurisprudence, and it is a long overdue 
victory for the preborn. It is also a vin-
dication of nearly 50 years of tireless 
efforts by the pro-life movement, the 
conservative 
legal 
movement, 
by 
textualists and originalists, and by 
President Trump’s recent judicial ap-
pointments. 
I am proud to say that this decision 
vindicates the efforts of people like my 
late father, who wrote an amicus brief 
in City of Akron v. Akron Center for 
Reproductive Health. 
Incidentally, it was in that context 
when I first had an encounter with in-
dividuals on the opposite side of this 
issue. I was 11 years old when my fa-
ther submitted that amicus brief while 
serving as President Reagan’s Solicitor 
General. 
One morning, a busload of pro-abor-
tion rights protesters showed up out-
side of our home. My parents and my 
siblings were out running errands, 
going about various activities. I found 
myself alone that morning. I went out-
side to talk to the people who had 
shown up in our quiet suburban neigh-
borhood in a Greyhound-size bus car-
rying signs and shouting slogans of one 
sort or another. 
I introduced myself to the woman 
who appeared to be in charge. Her first 
words startled me. She said: Well, 
hello, little boy. We are not here to 
hurt you. 
I thought that was strange. It ought 
to go without saying. It is a little 
alarming when that is the first thing 
someone says to you. I asked her what 
she was doing. She told me that they 
were there because they disagreed with 
some things that my father had sub-
mitted to the Supreme Court of the 
United States in that amicus brief to 
which I referred. 
I then asked the question: Why do 
you have to do it on my lawn? She re-
sponded in a way that I found curious. 
She said: Well, we are trying very hard 
not to step on your lawn. We are actu-
ally staying on the sidewalk. 
I didn’t yet understand the difference 
between an easement and a walkway 
and whether they had entered onto the 
curtilage of our home. All I knew was 
that it seemed like a strange place to 
be doing this, in front of a private resi-
dence, a home where a public official 
lived and slept and raised his children. 
I think about the tireless efforts of 
people like my late father to stand up 
for the rights of unborn human beings 
and for the injustice brought about by 
Roe v. Wade—a 1973 decision by the Su-
preme Court that stripped power away 
from the American people, stripped 
their opportunity to make decisions re-
garding abortion at the appropriate 
level of government, to have those de-
cisions made by their own elected law-
makers rather than by unelected, unac-
countable Judges who had arrogated to 
themselves the almost exclusive pre-
rogative to decide how, when, whether, 
to what extent abortions may be regu-
lated. 
What lies before the Supreme Court 
is the test of weathering the storm of 
political opinion. The line has been 
drawn, and Roe v. Wade appears to be 
on the verge of being overturned. 
Should this draft opinion become the 
official holding of the Court, Ameri-
cans will, once again, have the oppor-
tunity to debate and discuss these 
issues with the American people each 
deciding, within their respective State, 
what terms and conditions ought to 
apply, what restrictions ought to be 
imposed to protect human life. 
This should give us all hope that 
America is not doomed to decline. All

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2304 
May 4, 2022 
it takes is persistence, even in the face 
of daunting odds and decades of set-
backs by those who love God and love 
our country. For once, good men and 
women did not do nothing, and this 
evil will triumph no more. 
I was thinking recently about a 
monument that was placed on the Mall 
upon the hill where the Washington 
Monument stands. A few months ago, 
people placed white flags, each memo-
rializing those who had died with 
COVID–19. I believe at the time there 
were 6 or 700,000 people in America who 
had died with this illness, and so there 
were 6 or 700,000 little white flags, each 
standing only a few inches tall on that 
hill where the Washington Monument 
stands. From a distance, it looked like 
a snowstorm had hit Washington, DC. 
It hadn’t. It was actually quite beau-
tiful. 
I started thinking, I started won-
dering: What if a similar memorial 
were placed—if only temporarily, like 
that one was—honoring, memorializing 
those 63 million babies who had been 
aborted since Roe v. Wade was decided 
in 1973, taking away from the Amer-
ican people the ability to make their 
own laws in their own States pursuant 
to authority that belongs to the Amer-
ican people and our constitutional sys-
tem of government—63 million babies. 
A portion of this came out of my gen-
eration. There are an estimated one- 
fourth of generation X who were never 
born because they were aborted—63 
million. What if we had small red flags, 
each representing one of those babies? 
It has occurred to me that there 
wouldn’t be room enough on that hill 
to accommodate all of those. I seri-
ously wonder whether there would be 
room enough in the entire Mall, be-
tween the Capitol Building to the east 
and the Lincoln Memorial to the west, 
to accommodate all of those red flags. 
And what would that look like? The 
COVID memorial looked like a snow-
storm. This sea of red flags would look 
like something else. 
Now, this moment is not without 
some sense of loss. When I saw a draft 
Supreme Court opinion that had been 
leaked to the news media, I experi-
enced a wave of emotions. As pleased 
as I was and as encouraged as I am by 
what appears to be something that will 
soon become the opinion of the Court, 
I was also deeply upset that an em-
ployee of the Supreme Court of the 
United States could betray the trust of 
the Justices. 
I recalled from my own time that I 
spent at the Supreme Court, the time I 
spent as a law clerk working for Jus-
tice Alito, the great lengths to which 
the Court went to protect the internal 
deliberations of the Justices. We draft-
ed opinions on separate computers— 
‘‘separate computers’’ meaning we had 
a computer system that allowed us to 
handle 
internal 
correspondence 
be-
tween the chambers, to transfer draft 
opinions between the various cham-
bers. 
That computer system was com-
pletely walled off from the outside 
world. It was connected only by a local 
area network, one that was impen-
etrable from the outside world. If we 
wanted to do any research, any outside 
correspondence, anything that would 
require internet access, we had to go to 
a separate computer; we couldn’t use 
that one. It was walled off completely, 
with good reason. 
You see, the Court operates in such a 
way that its ultimate work product in 
any case will consist of a ruling; and, 
in fairness to the Justices, you have 
got to make sure that everything is in 
order; that the Justices each have de-
cided exactly how they are going to 
vote, which opinion they are going to 
join, and what that opinion is going to 
say before they release their opinions. 
If those go out too early, then they are 
not ready. That does a grave injustice 
to the litigants and to the American 
people, generally. 
That is why the Court goes to great 
lengths. It is not that they are being 
secretive about it. The Court is actu-
ally quite open and transparent. It is a 
matter of public record what docu-
ments they review in each case. The 
oral arguments presented to the Court 
are, likewise, matters of public record. 
And the documents that they produce 
that have legal operation are also pub-
lic documents. It is actually a very 
open and transparent process. 
But during the time period between 
when argument is heard and an opinion 
is rendered, the Court needs to be able 
to deliberate and consider its options 
confidentially. So that is what this se-
curity system does. It is there to make 
sure that opinions, as they are being 
drafted and sent back and forth, don’t 
leak out. 
In many circumstances, the editing 
of opinions took place on that same 
computer system, with drafts going 
back and forth; redlined, proposed edits 
between them. In those moments when 
you did need to print them out, you 
needed a hard copy, you could do so; 
but there were conditions attached to 
them. There was an understanding that 
they shouldn’t leave the building, you 
can’t take them home with you, they 
shouldn’t go outside the Court, they 
probably shouldn’t even go outside of 
your particular office. And when you 
are finished with them, you don’t just 
throw it in the wastebasket; you put 
them in a burn bag. 
Each law clerk has next to his or her 
desk a tall brown paper bag with 
stripes on it, and at the end of the day 
someone comes around and collects the 
contents of those burn bags. And they 
shred them. My understanding is that 
they shred them a couple times so that 
the documents are reduced not just to 
long, thin ribbons of paper that have 
been cut apart but they have been cut 
multiple times so that it is a fine mist 
of confetti. 
It is also my understanding and was 
at the time that before any of that 
even left the building, they would take 
it to an incinerator—that confetti—and 
they would burn it and they would 
grind it up into an ashy pulp, perhaps 
put some water in there, creating a 
slurry, so that no one could look at 
what was previously a draft opinion 
and discern what is going to happen. 
You see, lives are at stake. Power is 
at stake. Sometimes an enormous 
amount of money is at stake. All these 
things matter, and the Court wants to 
make sure that the opinions go out 
only when they are ready. 
Every day was filled with a sense of 
seriousness and of duty, a seriousness 
felt by everyone, even and especially 
when there was disagreement. The abil-
ity to deliberate and discuss these com-
plicated legal principles through the 
process of writing, editing, and sharing 
opinions with their colleagues is how 
the Justices are able to distill legal 
principles and arrive at proper legal 
conclusions and to do so, moreover, in 
a way that is respectful of the litigants 
and of each member of the Court. That 
is why their work is guarded from pub-
lic scrutiny at this stage and why a 
breach of confidentiality such as what 
we have witnessed this week is so dam-
aging. 
And, to be clear, this is unprece-
dented. I can’t think of another in-
stance of this happening over the 
Court’s entire history—certainly in 
modern history. I can’t think of an-
other instance in all of history in 
which something like this has hap-
pened, as the Court and its personnel 
have had a long history and a proud 
tradition of taking great care in these 
matters. 
Yet while I am convinced that this 
leak may have been an attempt to in-
timidate the Justices and the majority, 
perhaps an effort to get them to change 
their position, I am also confident that 
this attempt will not succeed. And it 
must not succeed. Chief Justice Rob-
erts said this very thing in his official 
statement, and he announced that an 
investigation into the leak will take 
place. I trust him and the other Jus-
tices and the Office of the Marshal at 
the Supreme Court to steer the Court 
through this storm and to oversee this 
investigation. 
The overwhelming feelings that I 
have today really are of joy—joy in the 
probable outcome of this case—and 
pride in being a former law clerk to 
Justice Alito, for whom I clerked 
twice: once when he was serving on the 
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Cir-
cuit and again while he was on the Su-
preme Court. 
The draft opinion overturns Roe v. 
Wade 
and 
Planned 
Parenthood 
v. 
Casey, stating that they ‘‘must be 
overruled and the authority to regulate 
abortion must be returned to the peo-
ple and their elected representatives,’’ 
noting correctly that the Constitution 
neither explicitly nor implicitly pro-
tects a right to abortion. 
Every human life, born and unborn, 
has immeasurable dignity and worth, 
each unrepeatable and infinitely valu-
able. The lives of an unborn baby and 
her mother and her father matter, and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2305 
May 4, 2022 
the Court overturning prior precedents 
such as Roe and Casey is not unprece-
dented—not at all. In fact, some of the 
Court’s most consequential and lauded 
decisions overturned prior rulings. 
Justice Alito compared the damage 
wrought by Roe to that of the ‘‘sepa-
rate but equal’’ doctrine created in 
Plessy v. Ferguson. Now, thankfully, 
the Supreme Court of the United 
States in Brown v. Board of Education 
overturned Plessy, putting an end to 
racially segregated schools, just as it 
appears now poised to overturn the er-
roneous decisions in Roe and in Casey. 
The opinion is exceptionally well rea-
soned, thorough, and grounded in the 
Constitution. It also means that in 
States across our country, including in 
my home State of Utah, hundreds of 
thousands of unborn children—children 
who could not be protected by State 
law due to restrictions placed on them 
by an invented, nonexistent constitu-
tional doctrine created out of whole 
cloth in Roe and in Casey—now have 
some chance at being protected, de-
pending, of course, on which decision 
makers in which States make which 
decisions regarding the protection of 
human life. 
As Americans, we must not—we can 
never forget what is at stake. If this 
majority decision stands, those who 
recognize the sanctity of human life— 
like myself and like a majority of 
Utahns—will have much to celebrate, 
but we must also recognize that this is 
not the end of this chapter in American 
history. The efforts of the last half cen-
tury have not been done just simply to 
overturn Roe. 
You see, getting to this point, the 
point that the Court has apparently 
reached, means that this discussion 
can finally begin. It is a discussion 
that has been closed out. Debatable 
matters have been rendered beyond de-
bate. This, of course, is the vision of a 
post-Roe America. This is why over-
turning Roe matters. What happens 
next with regard to abortion will be de-
termined by the people of the 50 States 
through their elected leaders, as our 
constitutional command of federalism 
demands. 
Now, some States, like Utah, already 
have laws in place to protect the most 
vulnerable among us the moment that 
Roe and Casey are overturned. I hope 
and pray that many innocent lives will 
be saved, not just in my State but all 
throughout our country. And I pray for 
all nine Justices’ safety and for our 
country. 
We all know and we have to remem-
ber that the laws adopted in one State 
will be different than the laws adopted 
in another. Part of living in a plural-
istic society, part of living in our con-
stitutional Republic requires us to ac-
cept the idea that people have different 
opinions; they have different views. Re-
gional differences appear from one 
State to another. I predict that the 
laws of Utah with regard to the protec-
tion of preborn human life may differ 
considerably from those of Vermont; 
that the laws of Massachusetts may 
differ in meaningful ways from those in 
Mississippi. 
Overturning Roe v. Wade and Casey 
v. Planned Parenthood does not do al-
most any of the things that are recited 
in the parade of horribles that those 
who are condemning this decision al-
ready have recited. Among the more 
frequent and perplexing arguments is 
that the overturning of Roe v. Wade 
and 
Casey 
v. 
Planned 
Parenthood 
somehow signals or will result in the 
demise of democracy. 
Nothing could be further from the 
truth. In fact, it is difficult to under-
stand how anyone could even make 
this argument with a straight face. I 
don’t mean here—not referring to their 
underlying position; I am referring to 
the specific argument that this some-
how represents a threat to democracy. 
Quite the opposite is true. 
By overturning Roe v. Wade and 
Casey v. Planned Parenthood, what the 
Supreme Court will be doing, the very 
thing it will be allowing is for the 
democratic process to unfold, for peo-
ple to make laws as they deem fit in 
their respective States. 
You see, all powers not granted by 
the Constitution to the Federal Gov-
ernment and not prohibited by the 
Constitution to the States remain to 
be made with the States or with the 
people themselves. That is what this 
does. So if we want to talk about demo-
cratic principles, this will further 
democratic principles. It will advance 
republican democracy, not undermine 
it. 
Another argument that has been 
made that I find equally perplexing is 
the suggestion that this somehow 
amounts to zealots on the Supreme 
Court of the United States dictating to 
women across America decisions re-
garding abortion. That is also not true. 
There is nothing about overturning 
Roe v. Wade and Casey v. Planned Par-
enthood that requires that anyone do 
anything beyond the fact that it is lift-
ing previously recognized but non-
existent impediments to State govern-
ments to protect unborn human life. 
To those who have raised these con-
cerns, to those who disagree with my 
views on the sanctity of unborn human 
life—and I recognize that there are 
those who do; many of them, in fact— 
I would direct them to their respective 
State-elected 
officials, 
specifically 
their State legislatures. That is where 
this decision is to be made. It is not to 
be made by the Supreme Court of the 
United States. They can’t criminalize 
anything. It is not within their power. 
They are just deciding who gets to de-
cide what. Different States are going to 
decide this differently, but that is part 
of the entire constitutional design. 
What Justice Alito wrote in this 
draft opinion is something that I hope 
will stand. It is absolutely right. It is 
unassailable 
from 
a 
constitutional 
standpoint, and it is absolutely essen-
tial to restore the American people to 
that which is rightfully theirs. 
I remain deeply troubled by those 
who appear, whether by leaking this 
opinion, characterizing it in ways that 
are unfair, threatening to pack the Su-
preme Court of the United States, talk-
ing about passing legislation that 
would increase the number of seats on 
the Supreme Court—these are all ef-
forts designed to degrade, to denigrate 
and delegitimize the Supreme Court of 
the United States. 
To those who have any inclination to 
do such a thing, I would say this: Roe 
v. Wade has stood in place nearly my 
entire life. Since I was old enough to 
understand it throughout my entire 
life, I have regarded it as a really bad 
decision, a very wrong decision. 
Notwithstanding that, I have always 
regarded and still regard the Supreme 
Court of the United States, despite its 
flaws—flaws stemming from the fact 
that it is run by fallible, mortal human 
beings 
who 
sometimes 
make 
mis-
takes—despite its flaws, it is the great-
est tribunal of its kind anywhere in the 
world. We would not want to substitute 
it because there is no better court of 
last resort anywhere in the world, even 
with its flaws. We must not risk what 
would 
come 
if 
we 
continue 
to 
delegitimize the Court. 
In the meantime, I am grateful that 
the Court appears finally to be on the 
verge of correcting this grave injustice, 
and I look forward to the debates and 
the discussions that will occur once 
and for all by the people’s elected rep-
resentatives. These decisions will now 
be able to be made by the people’s 
elected 
lawmakers 
and 
not 
by 
unelected, unaccountable jurists who 
lack authority to make that decision 
on behalf of all Americans. 
I continue to pray for the Court and 
for our country. Heaven knows our Re-
public needs it. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
UKRAINE 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, last 
week, my staff found a photo from a 
congressional trip I made to Eastern 
Europe in 1991. In one of the photos, I 
was standing in front of a wall. There 
is a message on the wall painted in big 
letters. It reads: ‘‘Freedom for Baltic 
Countries.’’ 
I remember that trip. The trip had 
special resonance for me and my fam-
ily. Eight decades earlier, my mother— 
only 2 years old—she and her family 
fled one of those Baltic nations—Lith-
uania—to escape the tyranny of czarist 
Russia, and they found freedom in 
America. 
Here I was—her son—returning to the 
Baltics in a remarkable moment in his-
tory. You see, 2 years earlier, in Au-
gust 1989, 2 million people—I will show 
you the photo of this because it is his-
toric—2 million people in the Baltic 
States of Lithuania, Latvia, and Esto-
nia joined hands to form a 373-mile- 
long Baltic chain of freedom. This 
human chain spanned the three nations 
and sent a clear message that the Bal-
tic nations wanted to reclaim their

freedom and their independence from 
the brutal occupation first by czarist 
Russia, then by Nazi Germany, and fi-
nally by the Soviet Union. 
Months before the fall of the Berlin 
Wall, the Baltic chain of freedom fore-
cast the end of the Soviet Union. But 
who were these countries to defy the 
Soviet Union? Countries with barely 3 
million population in Lithuania, 2 mil-
lion in Latvia, and 11⁄2 million in Esto-
nia were setting out to defy the super-
power of the Soviet Union. 
In February 1990, the people of Lith-
uania had chosen a new Parliament in 
their first free election. The new Par-
liament voted to restore their inde-
pendence and made Lithuania the first 
Soviet Republic to declare independ-
ence. They were followed quickly by 
their neighbors, Latvia and Estonia. 
You could feel at that moment when 
I visited the Seimas, which is the Par-
liament of Lithuania, the hope and his-
tory in the air, but there was also a 
feeling of trepidation and uncertainty. 
Would these small new democracies be 
able to preserve their freedom? 
In January 1991, the blowback that 
many 
had 
feared 
occurred. 
Soviet 
tanks rolled into Lithuania’s capital 
city of Vilnius. They attacked a crowd 
of protesters who were armed mainly 
with prayers and a few old hunting ri-
fles, killing 13 innocent protesters and 
injuring hundreds more. Soviet troops 
and tanks attacked protesters in Lat-
via. I remember visiting Riga and see-
ing flowers and the candles on one of 
the walkways near downtown where a 
Latvian lost his life standing up for 
freedom in their country. 
The Soviet troops could not break 
the determination of the Baltic people. 
In February and March of 1991, the 
people of these three countries voted 
overwhelmingly in support of restoring 
independence. The United States recog-
nized the sovereign new democracies 
later that same year. 
Today, these three countries are 
prosperous, vibrant democracies, proud 
members of the European Union and 
NATO, and supporters of their Ukrain-
ian neighbors who are facing Putin’s 
monstrous military wrath. 
When I visited Vilnius in January of 
1991—a month before Gorbachev at-
tacked with his tanks—I stood with the 
brave soldiers and ordinary citizens 
who filled the square outside the Par-
liament. They showed me their little 
arsenal of weapons. They took me back 
very quietly and secretly. It consisted 
of about 20 old hunting rifles. They 
were going to take on the Soviets. The 
situation seemed desperate and even 
doomed. Yet Baltic freedom prevailed. 
I think of those days often now. 
When 
Russia 
launched 
its 
unprovoked, unconscionable war, we 
were told Kyiv and the Ukrainian Gov-
ernment would fall within weeks or 
even days. Our military experts gave us 
their opinion, and that is what they 
said. Two months later, thank God, 
Kyiv is still free. Volodymyr Zelenskyy 
is still Ukraine’s President. May God 
protect him. 
Russia 
has 
suffered 
devastating 
losses on the battlefield and has been 
forced to retreat. Its forces are demor-
alized and in disarray. Russia’s econ-
omy is faltering under the weight of 
the most punishing sanctions imposed 
against any nation in modern history. 
Just as in the Baltics three decades 
ago, Russian strongmen have failed to 
understand the desire of people—even 
when they are outnumbered, if they are 
determined to be free and choose their 
own leaders, they will not be stopped. 
The Russians have failed to understand 
the determination of a community of 
democracy to stand together behind 
them and defeat the brutality and ag-
gression of Vladimir Putin. 
Putin may be able to deceive the peo-
ple living in Russia for now, but he 
cannot lie to the world. We know that 
the Russian military has caused hor-
rible devastation. We see it on the 
news. And they have committed hor-
rific 
war 
crimes 
against 
innocent 
Ukrainian people. One need only look 
to the barbaric executions and bru-
tality Russia has inflicted on the Kyiv 
suburb of Bucha. After the Russians 
fled, Bucha’s mayor, Anatolii Fedoruk, 
described the immediate scenes: 
Corpses of executed people still line the 
Yabluska street in Bucha. Their hands are 
tied behind their backs with white ‘‘civilian’’ 
rags, they were shot in the back of their 
heads. 
Putin had the sickening audacity to 
honor the military unit responsible for 
these crimes, saying this unit had dis-
tinguished itself in the protection of 
the fatherland. 
Russian war crimes have not been 
limited to this situation. Throughout 
Ukraine, investigators are reporting 
that Russian soldiers are using rape as 
a weapon of war and deliberately shell-
ing schools, hospitals, apartment build-
ings, emergency food centers, and 
other civilian targets. There are re-
ports of summary executions of indi-
viduals and murders of children. 
I agree with President Zelenskyy. In 
his words, he said it is ‘‘time to do ev-
erything possible to make the war 
crimes of the Russian military the last 
manifestation of such evil on earth.’’ 
The world can’t tolerate this bar-
barity, and the United States must 
never ever provide a safe haven for 
anyone who commits war crimes of 
this nature or crimes against humanity 
in Ukraine or anywhere in the world. 
For that reason, I am introducing leg-
islation that gives our government the 
authority to prosecute non-U.S. citi-
zens who commit such atrocities in 
other nations and then seek haven, ref-
uge, or seclusion in our country. 
My bill is called the War Crimes Ac-
countability Act. It closes a loophole 
in our current law that prevents our 
government 
from 
prosecuting 
war 
crimes unless they are actually com-
mitted in the United States or by or 
against U.S. citizens or members of our 
Armed Forces. 
My bill would also make crimes 
against humanity a crime under U.S. 
law so that such perpetrators cannot 
find—ever—safe haven in this country. 
What would this mean in practice? If a 
Russian soldier committed war crimes 
such as those we see here or crimes 
against humanity in Ukraine or a per-
son commits such atrocities anywhere 
in the world—say in Myanmar or in 
China—they can be tried under U.S. 
law and face criminal, civil, and immi-
gration consequences. It builds on pre-
vious laws I sponsored to make people 
who commit acts of genocide or who 
use child soldiers in war accountable 
under U.S. law. Those bills passed the 
Senate unanimously and were both 
signed into law by President George W. 
Bush. 
Despite the heroic efforts of the 
Ukrainian people, Russian forces con-
tinue to lay siege to the eastern part of 
that country, bombing civilians and 
forcing an even greater humanitarian 
nightmare. 
Last week, U.N. Secretary General 
Antonio Guterres traveled to Kyiv. He 
witnessed the destruction wrought by 
Russia, and he said: 
When I see those destroyed buildings, I 
must say what I feel. I imagined my family 
in one of those houses that is now destroyed. 
. . . I see my granddaughters running away 
in panic, part of the family eventually 
killed. 
He went on to say: 
The war is an absurdity of the 21st cen-
tury. The war is evil. 
So when President Biden announced 
a substantial new aid package for 
Ukraine, I said immediately: Count me 
in. The other day at the Senate Appro-
priations Committee on Defense, I 
asked Defense Secretary Austin and 
General Milley, the Chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs, about Ukraine’s defense 
capabilities and the President’s new re-
quest for aid. Both of these military 
leaders emphasized that continued, 
substantial support from the United 
States and its allies will be critical not 
only for Ukraine’s future but also to 
reassure our allies in the region, in the 
Baltics, Moldova, Poland. 
The $33 billion that Biden has asked 
for aid in Ukraine will help them with-
stand the next brutal phase of war and 
prevent Putin from spreading this ma-
levolent war into other nations. 
Let me conclude with a story about 
another brave soldier in the ranks of 
civilians, standing up to Putin’s men-
ace. 
Her 
name 
is 
Sviatlana 
Tsikhanouskaya. She is a leader of the 
democratic opposition in Belarus, an-
other former Soviet Republic bordering 
the Baltics and Poland. 
Last week, Ms. Tsikhanouskaya was 
in Washington to meet with the leaders 
of our government. Senator SHAHEEN 
hosted a meeting with her. Had Putin’s 
puppets in Belarus not rigged the last 
election, she might have been elected 
President—almost 
certainly 
would 
have 
been. 
This 
photo 
shows 
Belarusians 
protesting 
that 
rigged 
election, risking their lives to do it, I 
might add. For months, thousands of 
Belarusians protested. Many were ar-
rested and sentenced to long prison

sentences. I had been there before. The 
last dictator in continental Europe is a 
man named Lukashenka. He has phony 
elections from time to time. Anyone 
with the audacity to run against him is 
sure to lose by Lukashenka’s count and 
almost certainly to be imprisoned im-
mediately. 
He did that to this lady’s—Ms. 
Tsikhanouskaya’s—husband 
who 
is 
now in jail in Minsk. This photo shows 
Belarusians with the courage to pro-
test that rigged election. For months, 
thousands have protested; many have 
been arrested and sentenced. Today, 
Vladimir Putin is using Belarus as a 
staging ground for Russia’s assault on 
Ukraine, but the Belarusian people 
have not given up their determination 
for 
freedom 
either. 
Hundreds 
of 
Belarusians, maybe more, are fighting 
in Ukraine today, and we thank them 
for that courage. Others have helped to 
blunt Putin’s assault by sabotaging 
Belarusian train lines and crippling 
Russian supply lines. The supplemental 
aid package that President Biden has 
requested for Ukraine, for the weapons 
to repel Russia’s war of conquest and 
to give the people of Belarus, the Bal-
tics, Moldova, Poland, the security 
they need to realize their dreams of 
freedom, dignity, and independence is a 
statement of the values of America. 
I urge my colleagues to come to-
gether, waste no time, pass it quickly, 
send the Ukrainians what they need to 
win this war. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT—H.R. 4521 
Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous con-
sent that at 2:30 today, the Senate re-
sume legislative session and resume 
the House message to accompany H.R. 
4521; further, that the previous order be 
modified to allow Senator MURKOWSKI 
to offer the motion to instruct that is 
at the desk in lieu of the motion in the 
previous order; that Senator BENNET or 
his designee be permitted to make the 
Bennet motion; and that the Senate 
vote on the motions in the order listed 
without further intervening action or 
debate, with all other provisions in the 
previous order remaining in effect, and 
that all votes after the first be 10-

Without objection, it is so ordered.

U.S. SUPREME COURT 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, just a 
couple of days ago, we witnessed an un-
precedented attack on the independ-
ence and integrity of the U.S. Supreme 
Court, a third coequal branch of gov-
ernment, when some reporters got 
their hands on a nearly 3-month-old 
draft of an opinion, setting off a polit-
ical firestorm, creating a lot of confu-
sion, more than a little hysteria. And 
all of which is, frankly, beside the 
point because the Court actually hasn’t 
decided anything. 
But this was a stunning breach of 
confidentiality for an institution that 
relies on a private, confidential delib-
erative process. 
The Supreme Court was designed to 
operate, as is our judiciary, free of po-
litical and other outside influence and 
interference. That is why Justices are 
not elected; they are nominated and 
confirmed to serve life terms. That is 
why they don’t have term limits. That 
is why you can’t reduce their salary 
while they are in office, to make sure 
that politics and outside opinions have 
nothing to do with the way they do 
their job because, of course, their job is 
a limited but important job of saying 
what the law is, not making it up, not 
being a policy maker, but saying what 
the law is. 
It is absolutely critical to our form 
of government and to our separated 
powers and our three branches of gov-
ernment that the Supreme Court be 
protected 
from 
pressure 
campaigns 
from anyone—politicians, political ac-
tivists. Anyone. But that is exactly 
what is happening right now, and many 
of our colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle are fanning the flames. And 
they know that this is not a final opin-
ion, but they see a political oppor-
tunity to fan the flames of hysteria 
and mislead the American people about 
exactly what this all means and what 
the consequences are. 
For example, in the wake of this 
news, the Democratic leader of the 
Senate and the Speaker of the House 
released a statement—an unconscion-
able statement, in my view. They 
called it an abomination, one of the 
worst and most damaging decisions in 
modern history and one that defiled 
the Supreme Court’s reputation. 
That is what they say about a non-
decision, 
a 
nonjudgment, 
about 
a 
leaked, 3-month-old draft. 
We have no idea how the Court will 
ultimately decide the case, but this 
was a political opportunity that the 
Speaker and the majority leader could 
not resist. 
Frankly, I think it is because they 
would like to change the subject. 
The American people’s concerns, if 
you ask them—as public opinion poll-
sters have—what they are concerned 
about, they said they are concerned 
about inflation, they are concerned 
about crime, they are concerned about 
the border, they are concerned about 
the war, the Russian invasion of 
Ukraine. But this is a grand oppor-
tunity to change the subject and to 
mislead the American people. 
For some reason, the Senate major-
ity 
leader, 
Senator 
SCHUMER, 
and 
Speaker PELOSI did not criticize the 
person who actually leaked the opin-
ion, the person who committed a fron-
tal assault on the independence of our 
judiciary, the Supreme Court. 
One of the most powerful institutions 
in our country experiences an unprece-
dented breach of confidentiality, and 
what do our Democratic colleagues, the 
Speaker and the majority leader, do? 
They attack the Justices. They attack 
the Court. They don’t attack the 
leaker, the person who committed this 
egregious breach of confidentiality. 
Nowhere in their joint statement did 
they even mention the leak or leaker, 
or reaffirm the importance of an inde-
pendent judiciary. 
No, they took the opportunity to 
slam the Justices, who have not yet de-
cided the case. 
Unfortunately, this is nothing new. 
In 2019, the Democratic leader went to 
the Supreme Court steps and threat-
ened two Supreme Court Justices by 
name if they did not rule in a certain 
way. 
He said: 
You have released the whirlwind, and you 
will pay the price. You won’t know what hit 
you if you go forward with these awful deci-
sions. 
That is our colleague, the senior Sen-
ator from New York, the majority lead-
er of the Senate. He threatened two sit-
ting Justices with retribution should 
they rule in a way he disagreed with. 
The top Senate Democrat lobbing 
threats at Supreme Court Justices is a 
dangerous, dangerous model for the 
American people. This is the branch of 
government that is supposed to be kept 
free from those pressures and those 
sorts of threats, that kind of intimida-
tion, or at least attempts at intimida-
tion. 
But, here again, the Senator from 
New York and the Speaker of the 
House, they know that, but they did it 
anyway. 
It doesn’t matter what case is before 
the Supreme Court or what ruling is 
ultimately handed down, leaders of 
Congress, some of the highest elected 
officials 
in 
the 
U.S. 
Government, 
should be a better example and defend 
the important principle of judicial 
independence. 
Justice Scalia, in one of his speeches 
that I read a few years back, talked 
about what is unique about our system 
of government, and he said it is the 
independence of the judiciary, which 
are the crown jewels. He said, you read 
the Constitution of the old Soviet 
Union or any one of a number of other 
countries, they may have a fine writ-
ten document that pledges allegiance 
to certain high-minded values, many of 
which are contained in our Constitu-
tion, but they are just words on a 
paper. 
He said what is different in the 
United States of America is the inde-
pendence of the judiciary, who will call 
balls and strikes and who will ulti-
mately decide some of the most con-
tentious and disputed issues in our 
country based on the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, not because

S2308 
May 4, 2022 
they took a public opinion poll to see 
what was more popular or they were 
threatened with retribution by some 
politician. 
Unfortunately, our Democratic col-
leagues and, in particular, their leaders 
have taken a dangerous approach, and 
they are not just taking aim at indi-
vidual Justices; they want to under-
mine the entire institution of the inde-
pendent judiciary, particularly the Su-
preme Court. 
A few years ago, five of our col-
leagues on the Democratic side, includ-
ing the current chairman of the Senate 
Judiciary Committee, filed an amicus 
brief—a friend of the court brief—in a 
case involving gun rights. These Sen-
ators made a not-so-subtle threat that 
unless the Court ruled in a particular 
way, the entire institution would be, in 
their words, ‘‘restructured.’’ That is 
nothing more, nothing less than a sim-
ple effort to coerce the Justices into 
deciding a case in a particular way; to 
threaten them that unless you go our 
way, the Court will be restructured. 
Well, we know that those weren’t 
just idle words, given some of the 
threats to pack the Court by adding ad-
ditional Justices to the Court. We 
heard that threat of Court packing 
many times. That was one of the agen-
da items should our Democratic col-
leagues eliminate the filibuster, the re-
quirement of 60 votes before you close 
off debate in the Senate. They said 
they were going to pack the Court. 
Many of the presidential hopefuls em-
braced that idea in 2020, and the latest 
news has it that a number of Demo-
crats are bringing this idea back to 
center stage. Disagree with what you 
think the Court might ultimately de-
cide, and we are going to restructure 
it. We are going to pack it until we get 
the result that we want. Kiss an inde-
pendent judiciary goodbye—the crown 
jewels of our system of government. 
Earlier this week, the junior Senator 
from Massachusetts called the Su-
preme Court’s current majority ‘‘sto-
len, illegitimate, and far-right.’’ These 
are Justices who were confirmed by the 
U.S. Senate. It is dangerous and dis-
honest to suggest that any of their po-
sitions are anything less than con-
sistent with the law and the Constitu-
tion. 
Our colleague went on to say that the 
Supreme Court should be ‘‘expanded.’’ 
That is another way of saying they 
should pack the Court with like-mind-
ed policymakers. Well, whether you 
talk about expanding the Court or 
packing the Court, the result is the 
same. It is just another effort to try to 
politicize this independent branch of 
government—this independent judici-
ary—which, as I said and will say 
again, are the crown jewels of our sys-
tem of government, an independent ju-
diciary. 
Well, even Joe Biden knows that is a 
boneheaded idea. The reason I know 
that and we know that is because that 
is what he said in 1983. He called Court 
packing a ‘‘boneheaded idea.’’ 
Justice Ginsburg was asked about it. 
She said ‘‘nine seems to be a good num-
ber.’’ That was her gentle way of say-
ing that if you start adding Justices to 
the Court or restructuring or packing 
the Court, basically, you are in pursuit 
of a political outcome and you under-
mine the independence of the judiciary 
and they are transformed into some-
thing far different than what our 
Founding Fathers believed it would be, 
which is an institution that would de-
cide legal disputes, whether they be 
constitutional or otherwise, and would 
be depended on by the American people 
to present fair opportunities for all 
sides to be heard and then an outcome 
that was not tainted by bias or politics 
or policymaking. 
As Justice Breyer has said, the very 
authority that the Court has depends 
on ‘‘a trust that the court is guided by 
legal principle, not politics’’ and that 
these types of changes—packing, re-
structuring, whatever you want to call 
it—he said would erode that trust, un-
dermine the public’s confidence and 
trust in the Supreme Court. 
But as we have seen the last few days 
since this draft opinion was leaked in 
an egregious breach of confidentiality, 
our friends across the aisle don’t want 
impartial judges. They don’t want an 
independent 
judiciary. 
They 
want 
judges who will deliver a particular 
outcome in a case. They want the 
Court to be an extension of their poli-
tics here in the Senate. 
Well, politics has its place, but its 
place is right here and in the White 
House, where the voters get to vote for 
us or vote against us every 2 years or 6 
years, as the case may be—or 4 years, 
in the case of the President. 
I understand that our colleagues 
want a specific ruling on abortion 
rights. Tomorrow, it could be Second 
Amendment rights. The next day, it 
might involve the means by which we 
run our elections. This entire episode 
highlights just how far the radicals in 
the other party are willing to go to try 
to get their way. They don’t care about 
the long-term best interests of the 
country. They don’t care about an 
independent judiciary. They are look-
ing for an opportunity to score polit-
ical points and distract the American 
people from what they are really con-
cerned about, which is their ability to 
put food on the table and support their 
families. 
The reason why our Founders de-
signed a Federal Government with 
three separate but equal branches is 
because they thought the checks and 
balances that the three branches would 
impose would be protective of their lib-
erty. And when one branch goes too 
far, another branch can be a check and 
a balance on that and, ultimately, the 
Supreme Court could be the final arbi-
ter on the constitutionality or the le-
gality of what the other branches are 
trying to do. 
But our colleagues across the aisle— 
by their irresponsible rhetoric under-
mining public confidence in the Court, 
jeopardizing the independence of the 
judiciary—are blurring the lines be-
tween the political process and the ju-
dicial 
branch’s 
responsibility. 
And 
why? For partisan political gain. 
An independent judiciary is essential 
to our democracy. The parties whose 
cases are being decided by the Court 
should never have to worry about out-
side influencers or whether politics 
plays into the decision-making process. 
How would you feel if you had a case 
before the U.S. Supreme Court and you 
knew that your opposing party tried to 
pressure or coerce or persuade the 
judge to arrive at a certain outcome re-
gardless of the law or facts? Well, that 
would be the opposite of an impartial 
tribunal and independent judiciary; but 
that is exactly what our Democratic 
colleagues are trying to do with the 
U.S. Supreme Court in this instance. 
Americans 
have 
a 
constitutional 
right to due process of law and that 
precludes any attempt to influence or 
obstruct an independent judiciary for 
making a decision in an individual 
case. I would like to see more of our 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
fight to protect the integrity and inde-
pendence of the judiciary. But if they 
won’t, then we will. 
One thing is for certain. As Chief 
Justice Roberts said, the Court needs 
to get to the bottom of how this draft 
opinion got into the hands of the press 
in an unprecedented and egregious 
breach of confidence. The Supreme 
Court Chief Justice Roberts has di-
rected the Marshal of the Court to in-
vestigate the source of this leak and 
once that happens, the person respon-
sible will be held accountable. It is a 
very tight-knit group of people who 
have access to these draft opinions. 
I have every confidence the Marshal 
of the Court will find the person who 
leaked this opinion to the press, and 
they will be held accountable in what 
will undoubtedly be a life-changing 
consequence, particularly if it is a law 
clerk or someone who is working for 
the Court. It will be a career-ending 
mistake. 
But this is, first and foremost, a mat-
ter of protecting the integrity and 
independence of the judiciary from any 
force, external or internal, that seeks 
to chip away at the Court’s independ-
ence. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, I am real-
ly beginning to believe everyone in the 
White House is clueless. After prom-
ising to lead us away from crisis and 
chaos, President Biden has instead

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2309 
May 4, 2022 
more challenging and, folks, a heck of 
a lot more expensive while at the same 
time making the world a much more 
dangerous place. Then, to cover up the 
connection between his actions and 
their disastrous outcomes, the Presi-
dent plays the blame game. 
Since Joe Biden was sworn in as 
President just a little over a year ago, 
we have experienced record-setting in-
flation, making everyday essentials 
unaffordable; an unprecedented number 
of migrants rushing our southern bor-
der; our national debt topping $30 tril-
lion for the first time; the Taliban’s re-
taking control of Afghanistan; and the 
world being brought to the brink of nu-
clear war. 
Are these events purely the result of 
chance or are they direct consequences 
of the choices being made in the White 
House? You don’t need to be a detec-
tive to solve this whodunit. Let’s go 
ahead and examine the case. 
All right. Over the past year, the cost 
of nearly everything has increased at 
the fastest pace in over four decades. A 
gallon of milk is up nearly 50 cents, 
and 2 pounds of ground beef costs over 
$1.50 more than it did a year ago. Add 
in rising rents and home prices, and 
these numbers really add up quickly. 
While Iowans and the rest of Ameri-
cans are struggling to adjust their fam-
ily budgets to the ever increasing cost 
of living, the Biden administration has 
repeatedly dismissed concerns about 
the price problem. 
Last summer, the President said: 
It’s highly unlikely that it’s going to be 
long-term inflation that’s going to get out of 
hand. 
Now that the problem can no longer 
be ignored, he is actually blaming cor-
porate greed. 
Get a clue. 
The Federal Reserve says the reason 
prices in the United States have been 
outpacing inflation in other countries 
since 2021—when Biden became Presi-
dent—is as a direct result of Washing-
ton’s unprecedented spending spree. It 
turns out you can’t just print trillions 
of dollars and hand it out for free. 
Republicans in Congress and even 
some Democrats warned that this 
would 
happen 
when 
the 
President 
began 
pushing 
one 
trillion-dollar 
spending bill after another. Now hard- 
working Americans are stuck paying 
for the Biden binge-spending twice— 
first with higher taxes and then again 
with higher bills. When you add it all 
up, Bidenomics is costing every family 
almost $500 more a month today than a 
year ago to buy the same exact items. 
So, despite the President’s finger- 
pointing, 
this 
problem 
isn’t 
being 
caused by corporate greed for profits, 
and it isn’t caused on Wall Street. 
The White House is using a similar 
setup to hide the true cause of higher 
prices at the pump. President Biden 
wants us to believe that the sky-
rocketing costs to fill up your tank are 
all Vladimir Putin’s fault, but gas was 
on the rise for more than a year before 
the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In 
fact, gas prices have steadily increased 
since the President’s first day in office 
when he signed an Executive order to 
shut down the Keystone XL Pipeline. 
On that day, January 20, 2021, a gallon 
of gas cost less than $2.50. The Presi-
dent then signed an Executive order 
turning off all new oil and gas leases on 
public lands. 
While the President was shutting 
down U.S. energy, he was helping to 
make the world more dependent on 
Putin for power. In May of last year, 
the Biden administration waived the 
sanctions on Russia’s Nord Stream 2 
gas pipeline. By then, gas here in the 
United States had reached $3 a gallon. 
When Putin invaded Ukraine in Feb-
ruary, the price was already more than 
$3.50 per gallon. 
So don’t be fooled, folks. It is really 
Biden’s war on American energy that 
has been fueling the soaring costs. 
While the Russian dictator is guilty of 
many horrible things, the higher gas 
prices we have been paying for over the 
past year and a half did not begin as a 
result of Putin in Ukraine because of 
the war. 
It is impossible to miss the irony of 
President Biden’s pointing the finger 
at Putin since the Russian dictator’s 
aggression against Ukraine may have 
been emboldened by Biden’s abrupt 
abandonment 
in 
Afghanistan. 
The 
poorly planned evacuation also turned 
over billions of dollars of weapons and 
equipment to the Taliban and other 
terrorists and left countless Americans 
and our allies behind while costing the 
lives of 13 of our brave servicemembers. 
The President blamed our own mili-
tary—he blamed our own military—for 
not warning him of the catastrophe 
that would occur if he withdrew all 
U.S. forces, but those claims were con-
tradicted under oath before the Senate 
Armed Services Committee by his own 
advisers, who said the President was 
told Afghanistan would collapse. Try 
as he might to lay the blame else-
where, the President singlehandedly 
made the call to completely withdraw 
from Afghanistan, which will go down 
as one of the worst foreign policy deci-
sions in U.S. history. 
Now Biden’s blunders are threatening 
to turn the crisis at our southern bor-
der into total chaos. The number of il-
legal crossings last year exceeded 1.7 
million—the most ever recorded. To 
make matters worse, the administra-
tion has announced that those at-
tempting to enter our country illegally 
will soon no longer be turned away 
under the authority provided by title 
42. As a consequence, Homeland Secu-
rity officials are expecting a record 
surge of border crossings, which could 
reach as many as 18,000 people a day. 
Just like his other abrupt, poorly 
thought-out decisions, the President 
has no plan to deal with the inevitable 
repercussions. When the predictable 
disaster occurs, the President will be 
surprised and confused and look for 
someone else to blame. 
I could go on, but I am all ready to 
rest my case since the same set of fin-
gerprints is on all of the evidence of 
these problems. 
But, President Biden, if you still 
haven’t figured it out, I will give you a 
clue. Spoiler alert: The culprit is you. 
Whether signing Executive orders to 
turn off American-made energy or sign-
ing budget-busting bills that are fan-
ning the flames of inflation, the source 
of these problems can all be traced 
back to President Biden, with the pen, 
in the Oval Office. 
It is right there, folks. Case closed. 
That is how all of these crises were 
created over the past year. 
Now, imagine how some of the other 
policies being proposed by Democrats, 
like defunding the police, abolishing 
ICE, or enacting the Green New Deal, 
could turn out if President Biden is 
given the chance to sign them into law. 
Taxpayers can rest assured that Re-
publicans in Congress will keep doing 
our part to make sure those bills never 
make it to the President’s desk. And if 
the President tries to bypass Congress 
and enact its radical agenda by signing 
Executive orders behind the closed 
doors of the White House, Americans 
can count on Republicans to clue you 
in. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
ROSEN). The Senator from Tennessee. 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, it has been over a year since Joe 
Biden and KAMALA
HARRIS
and the 
Democrats took control of all the gov-
ernment here in DC. They like the fact 
that they have got their hands on the 
drivers, and they are enacting their 
policies. But what is so interesting, as 
my colleague from Iowa was pointing 
out, is they continue to try to blame 
Donald Trump and Republicans for the 
issues that are in front of us. 
Just a few years ago, if you would 
have asked me how I would evaluate a 
government that spent their way into 
inflation—recordbreaking 
inflation— 
surrendered our border to the drug car-
tels, and abandoned two Embassies, I 
would tell you that that sounds like an 
administration that is in disarray. I 
think most people would believe that 
to be a fact. 
But here is the problem: We have 
moved beyond disarray. Tennesseans 
feel like it is more like a catastrophe. 
This is not mere incompetence at 
work. Joe Biden is earning his dis-
approval rating that he was joking 
about at the Correspondents’ Dinner 
last week. He knows that it is, indeed, 
low—some of the lowest ever. 
The fact is that President Biden and 
Vice President HARRIS have had a ter-
rible, horrible, no good, very bad year, 
and they did this to themselves. And 
now their allies in Congress are ready 
to make things even worse. They are 
doubling down. 
This is what happens when you try to 
force an agenda filled with pet projects 
that the American people are telling 
you they do not want and, as taxpayers 
are saying, ‘‘You can’t afford this.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2310 
May 4, 2022 
This is what happens when you really 
have no vision for the future of the 
country. It is all about power, all about 
control. 
Last month, the Harvard Kennedy 
School Institute of Politics released a 
poll showing that this distinction be-
tween agenda and vision actually mat-
ters to people. They found that 56 per-
cent of young Americans, ages 18 to 29, 
disapprove of Joe Biden’s job perform-
ance. That is correct; 56 percent dis-
approve. And just last spring, 59—that 
is right, 59—percent of young persons 
were still in his corner. 
Look at what is happening. Look at 
that flip that is taking place. 
The measure of success or failure for 
this administration shouldn’t come 
down to how many boxes they can 
check off their wish list but how many 
young Americans look at what they 
are doing, and they say: I can’t support 
this. This does not give me hope. This 
does not look good for my future. 
Indeed, 56 percent of young Ameri-
cans, ages 18 to 29, disapprove of the 
Biden agenda. 
Right now, this age group, they are 
losing hope. That same Harvard poll 
shows that their top concern isn’t the 
environment; it isn’t abortion or Roe v. 
Wade; it is the economy. And why 
wouldn’t it be? The current inflation 
rate is 8.5 percent. Last year, it was 2.6 
percent. 
How can anyone be expected to plan 
for their future if they are struggling 
to plan for next week’s grocery run? 
They are paying a premium just to 
live. 
Meanwhile, the President is asking 
them to sacrifice even more so he can 
check some more boxes on his to-do 
list that is all about this leftist agen-
da. It is not about the people; it is 
about power; it is about control. 
Young Americans—and I would say 
all Americans, Tennesseans—deserve 
better than this. They deserve leaders 
who have a vision for the future of this 
country, who have the God-given com-
mon sense to see it through. 
Joe Biden and the Democrats have 
been in power for more than a year. 
The window for blame-shifting and ex-
cuses is closed. It is shut. It is time for 
the President to abandon this self-de-
structive agenda and give the Amer-
ican people a fighting chance at re-
claiming their own vision for the fu-
ture. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Mr. KAINE. Madam President, in a 
moment, I am going to make a motion 
by unanimous consent to call up, and 
hopefully confirm, significant appoint-
ments in the Department of Defense. 
We are in the midst of a war in Eu-
rope right now. It is hard to imagine 
that, and yet it is the case. Every day 
we see atrocities committed by Vladi-
mir Putin’s illegal invasion of Ukraine, 
but every day we also see the concerted 
effort of the United States and NATO 
allies and other nations to provide dra-
matic support for the Ukrainian de-
fense force and the Ukrainian people. 
We honor the Ukrainians’ resolve and 
heroism, and we feel proud of the role 
that the United States and other na-
tions are playing in providing defense. 
And I hope we will take additional de-
fense support up on the floor in the 
days to come. However, this is not easy 
work to do. 
One of the positions that I am going 
to be seeking a UC on is the DOD As-
sistant 
Secretary 
for 
Sustainment, 
Christopher Lowman, who is a Vir-
ginian. He and his family live in Fred-
ericksburg. 
Mr. Lowman is, according to the 
committee, completely noncontrover-
sial and very much desired in this posi-
tion. 
He was born in Germany, in a mili-
tary family, grew up in Virginia, went 
to college in New Jersey. He was a U.S. 
marine beginning in 1984, and then 
after his Active Marine service, en-
tered the Army civil service as an 
Army maintenance management intern 
in 1989. And he has been with the Army 
ever since. 
His specialty is logistics. So this As-
sistant Secretary of Sustainment is 
kind of the peak logistics officer in the 
Pentagon. 
He previously was the Acting Prin-
cipal Deputy Assistant Secretary of 
the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, 
and Technology. OK. That is a title 
that is—you know, what does that ac-
tually mean? I will tell you what it 
means. When the United States is try-
ing to get historic amounts of military 
aid across a contested border from al-
lied countries into a war zone, we need 
people who know logistics. It may not 
be the sexiest part of the military mis-
sion, but it is part of the mission that 
is absolutely critical, and it is part of 
the mission where the U.S. military is 
second to none in the world. 
If you wonder why the Russian mili-
tary’s grand plans to topple Ukraine in 
just a couple of days came to naught, 
you first say it is Ukrainian heroism, 
and you second say it is the support of 
our allies, but, third, you have to point 
out the Russian military has dem-
onstrated that they haven’t mastered 
logistics. The inability to maintain 
supply chains, the inability to do prop-
er maintenance of tanks and other ve-
hicles is one of the reasons that the 
Russians have not been able to accom-
plish their aims. So what this war in 
Europe is demonstrating is militaries 
that have the capacity to do logistics 
and provide supplies to people on the 
front end of the fight are critical to 
success. 
Given the fact that the United States 
is the key to pulling together the 
international effort to provide support 
to the Ukrainian defense force, and 
given the fact that that mission de-
pends upon having the best logistics in 
the world, why would we leave the 
chief logistics official at the Pentagon 
position vacant in the middle of a war 
when the United States is playing this 
heroic role? 
For that reason, Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the Sen-
ate proceed to executive session to con-
sider the following nominations en 
bloc: Calendar Nos. 477, 599, 777, 779, 780, 
781, 861, and 886; that the Senate vote 
on the nominations en bloc without in-
tervening action or debate; that the 
motions to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table; that any 
statements related to the nominations 
be printed in the RECORD; that the 
President be immediately notified of 
the Senate’s action and the Senate re-
sume legislative session. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. HAWLEY. Madam President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri. 
Mr. HAWLEY. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object, I find my-
self here on the floor again as my 
friend 
the 
Senator 
from 
Virginia, 
whose sincerity and urgency on this 
issue I don’t doubt for a second, tries 
to move a whole slate of nominees to 
which multiple Republican Senators 
have objections. And let me give you a 
sense of why. 
One of the nominees that my friend 
is attempting to move here, let’s be 
clear, to do this without a vote—we 
could be voting on these nominees. The 
majority leader could schedule votes 
on them any time, but he hasn’t done 
that. He hasn’t done it in some of the 
cases for months. 
This is an act—this is a request to 
suspend the regular order of the Senate 
and to confirm these nominees without 
a vote. Well, I, for one, am not going to 
consent to confirming without a vote 
people like Ravi Chaudhary. He is 
being nominated for Assistant Sec-
retary of the Air Force. 
Mr. Chaudhary, who appeared before 
the Armed Services Committee, on 
which I sit, as does my friend from Vir-
ginia—Mr. Chaudhary has proposed 
using AI technology—artificial intel-
ligence—to track members of the mili-
tary, identify them as extremists, and 
then have them expelled. 
He said: 
The key to disrupting them— 
Meaning ‘‘extremists,’’ his word, peo-
ple whose views he doesn’t agree with. 
The key to disrupting them is uncovering 
and understanding their initial behaviors, 
elements that are contained in their elec-
tronic footprints. 
What Mr. Chaudhary has proposed to 
do is to use surveillance on members of 
the U.S. military to determine whether 
they might, in the future, commit acts 
that he might disapprove of and then 
to take action against these members 
of the military. 
In 2015, he wrote this: that the mili-
tary exhibits a ‘‘culture of xenophobic 
cronyism.’’ And he went on to say that 
there was a ‘‘xenophobic command cli-
mate’’ in the U.S. military today. 
I said to Mr. Chaudhary, at the time 
when we had our hearing, that I cannot

believe that he would propose to use 
surveillance on members of the U.S. 
military to track their speech, to track 
their activity online, to track their 
movements online, all in an effort to 
decide if they might, in the future, 
commit acts that he disagrees with. 
I submit to you, Madam President, 
not only is that wrong; it is blatantly 
unconstitutional—blatantly unconsti-
tutional—and it is frightening. What is 
further frightening is that he would be 
nominated for a leadership position in 
the Department of Defense. 
I call on the President of the United 
States to withdraw this nomination 
today, just as he should withdraw his 
unconstitutional disinformation board 
that he is attempting to force on the 
American people as we speak. This is 
the most radically anti-free-speech ad-
ministration 
in 
American 
history. 
Their actions are an affront to the 
basic constitutional values of this Na-
tion, including and especially the First 
Amendment. 
I am appalled—appalled—at what 
this administration is doing—censoring 
American citizens, surveilling them— 
and now advocating it in the U.S. mili-
tary, to the men and women who put 
their lives on the line? 
So, no, I will not consent to have this 
individual, who never should have been 
nominated 
for 
this 
position, 
fast- 
tracked to be confirmed without a 
vote, without a single, solitary vote on 
the floor of the U.S. Senate. 
Mr. KAINE. Madam President, will 
the Senator yield for a question? 
Mr. HAWLEY. I think you have the 
floor, Senator; so, yes, I think—— 
Mr. KAINE. Will the Senator yield 
for a question? 
It strikes me that the Senator’s ob-
jection is you do not want to have this 
candidate—the bloc of them advanced 
without a vote. If I can guarantee that 
you get a vote on these nominations, 
will you drop your objection? 
Mr. HAWLEY. Can I respond to that? 
Mr. KAINE. Yeah. I mean, I know 
you will vote no. You have made it 
plain. But if I can guarantee you would 
get a vote, will you drop your objec-
tion? 
Mr. HAWLEY. On all eight of them, 
Senator? 
Mr. KAINE. Yeah. 
Mr. HAWLEY. To have a vote on the 
floor? 
Mr. KAINE. Yes. 
Mr. HAWLEY. I would be happy to 
take a vote on the floor on all eight 
nominations. 
Mr. KAINE. And that is what my 
point is. We are not fast-tracking these 
without a vote. This is a motion to 
allow a vote en bloc on the floor. So 
you will have an opportunity to vote 
against Mr. Chaudhary or all of these. 
This is not a motion to immediately 
approve them without a vote. It is just 
a motion to bring them up so that you 
and others can vote on these nominees. 
That is all I am seeking. 
And so my request, basically, would 
guarantee you a vote on all of these 
nominations if you drop your objec-
tion. 
Mr. HAWLEY. Is this a recorded vote 
on the floor, Senator? 
Mr. KAINE. It would be a—yes. It 
would be en bloc, but it is a recorded 
vote, is my understanding. 
And, again, Madam President, just to 
clarify, my motion is only that the 
Senate be allowed to vote on these 
nominees: Alex Wagner for Assistant 
Secretary of the Air Force; Ashish 
Vazirani for Deputy Under Secretary of 
Defense; Christopher Lowman, Assist-
ant Secretary of Defense; Lester Mar-
tinez-Lopez, Assistant Secretary of De-
fense; Agnes Schaefer, Assistant Sec-
retary of the Army; Franklin Parker, 
Assistant 
Secretary 
of 
the 
Navy; 
Musetta Tia Johnson, Judge of the U.S. 
Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces; 
and Ravi Chaudhary, Assistant Sec-
retary of the Air Force. 
I understand my colleague will vote 
no, but all I am moving is for the Sen-
ate to be able to have a vote on these 
nominees. 
Mr. HAWLEY. Senator, you want to 
vote on all eight at one time; you don’t 
want to vote on each one? 
Mr. KAINE. My motion is to consider 
them, yes, en bloc; but it would be a re-
corded vote, is my understanding. 
Mr. HAWLEY. What I propose to do 
here is—there are multiple Senators on 
this side of the aisle besides myself 
who have objections to different mul-
tiple of these. What I propose to do is 
object to this now, but I think we can 
work something out on this going for-
ward. 
So I think—do I have the floor now? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia has the floor, and 
there is a pending unanimous consent 
request. 
Mr. HAWLEY. OK. So I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mr. KAINE. I appreciate the objec-
tion being heard, and I would just say 
to my colleague, I hope we could work 
out a deal that would enable us to have 
a floor vote where my colleague could 
vote as he chooses on these nominees. 
This was not an attempt to bypass a 
vote; it was just an effort to have a 
vote where everybody can be recorded 
on the nominees. I hope we can work 
that out. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri. 
ISSUES FACING THE NATION 
Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I 
want to continue to talk about some of 
the challenges the administration is 
facing and the country is facing. Let 
me talk for just a little bit about the 
border, about the economy, and about 
our ongoing concerns on COVID. 
First of all, the border—we have had 
a number of people come to the floor 
and talk about the border, the prob-
lems at the border. Many of these prob-
lems were really self-inflicted on day 1. 
The President, on the first day of his 
Presidency—and I chaired the inau-
guration on January 20. Hours after 
that, the President decided to stop 
building the wall. 
I was never an advocate of needing a 
wall everywhere along the southern 
border, but we had a wall in lots of 
places already. It was doing some good, 
but it wasn’t doing as much good as it 
needed to do. And just the idea that 
we—with the material on the ground 
and the old wall torn down—would de-
cide to stop building the wall, I think, 
started these problems. 
And if that wasn’t enough, then- 
President Trump had made arrange-
ments, the State Department had made 
arrangements—everybody 
involved— 
with Mexico to have people who were 
applying for asylum wait for their 
court date in Mexico. It was my view 
at the time that we should do anything 
we could to help the Mexican Govern-
ment make that work because the al-
ternative was people would come into 
the United States and not show up for 
an asylum date later. 
In Mexico, they have learned that 
they weren’t going to qualify for asy-
lum because fewer than—9 out of 10 
people, roughly, will not qualify. You 
found that out before you got into the 
United States and successfully had en-
tered our country, even though you 
weren’t eligible to. If you were waiting 
in Mexico and you found a lawyer to 
talk to and maybe even a way to hear 
your case in some way there, you 
would find out that you weren’t going 
to qualify for asylum 81⁄2 times or 9 
times out of 10, and that is where you 
should have found that out. 
To come in the country and wait for 
months to have a court date that you 
may or may not show up for just sim-
ply has not worked, and everybody that 
understands this system understands it 
doesn’t work. And everybody that un-
derstands the obligation of a govern-
ment understands that a government 
has some obligation to control its own 
borders, and you don’t control your 
own borders by having people come 
into the country that aren’t legally eli-
gible to come into the country and 
then just stay here. So that policy pro-
duced real chaos. 
And then title 42, under the public 
health law, was another thing that we 
put in place, as we put all kinds of 
other COVID-related protections in 
place. And now we want to eliminate 
title 42. The only place, apparently—if 
you follow the CDC closely right now— 
that we don’t need to up our game on 
COVID protection is the border of the 
United States. 
None of these things makes sense. We 
have too many people who have been 
encouraged wrongly and told: You 
come to the United States, you ask for 
asylum, they let you into the United 
States, and then you don’t show up for 
your asylum hearing. 
I am for legal immigration. I am for 
solving the Dreamer problem. I am for 
doing a lot of things that we need to do 
to make our immigration laws work 
properly.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2312 
May 4, 2022 
We need to understand the workforce 
needs of the country. We need to under-
stand what to do about people who 
came or stayed illegally. But we also 
need to understand how to secure the 
border. And that is where, for any of 
these other things to work, you have to 
do that. 
The COVID problem, as I said, ap-
pears to only be a problem at the 
CDC—well, actually, it appears to be a 
problem everywhere but the border. 
The CDC, just yesterday, had a new 
rule that even for domestic travel, peo-
ple should now—their advice is have a 
test for domestic travel—before you 
get on an airplane to go domestically, 
to have that test. 
The efforts that we were working on 
and working hard on to replenish the 
categories that have been spent for re-
search, particularly for the thera-
peutics that we need to have a stock of 
that haven’t been fully certified yet— 
so they have to be the Government is 
the purchaser of those—we were work-
ing on a $10 billion bill. And even this 
morning again, the Secretary of Com-
merce, at our appropriations hearing, 
said: Well, that would just be a start. 
We need 10 or 20 or 30 billion more be-
fore the end of this fiscal year than we 
currently have, and it is an emer-
gency—10, 20, 30 billion more than we 
have now. 
But at the border, no problem at all. 
At the border, this is no problem. We 
need billions of dollars to deal with it 
internally. We need to not only have 
fewer tests, which everybody agrees, 
fewer standards for domestic travel; we 
now need a new standard, they say, for 
domestic travel. Surely they will think 
about that. And while we are negoti-
ating, again, spending, this issue comes 
out simultaneously that the border is a 
problem. 
And 
then, 
of 
course, 
everybody 
knows the economy is a problem. All 
you have got to do to find out the econ-
omy is a problem is go to the gas sta-
tion or go to the grocery store, and 
most Americans do that and do it a lot. 
And when gas prices go up, when food 
prices go up, every family knows it. 
What we are seeing now is inflation 
that I think it is 8.5 percent. It may be 
settling in at 8.5 percent. But wherever 
it settles in, it is a whole lot higher 
than it was at any time during the 
Obama administration. The highest 
month in the entire Obama administra-
tion of inflation—that is not a year av-
erage—the highest single month was 
3.4 percent. Under President Trump, 
the highest single month was 2.9 per-
cent. We are now at 8.5 percent, and 
the Producer Price Index has been in 
double digits since December. That is 
usually a sign that the other index is 
going to follow that double-digit, scary 
number that is out there. 
So energy policies that produced ex-
actly the result you would think they 
would: higher energy prices; spending 
policies: the American Rescue Plan. I 
thought, at the time, it was a final 
COVID bill, but when you looked at the 
bill before we had a chance to vote on 
it and saw it, it really didn’t have very 
much to do with COVID. Maybe 6 per-
cent of the $1.9 trillion went to COVID. 
The rest of it went to things that put 
money in people’s pockets to help them 
recover in an economy that was al-
ready recovering. 
You can’t spend $1.9 trillion in a 
short period of time, even in the big-
gest and most vibrant economy in the 
world, and not drive up prices. So 
whether it is inflation, whether it is 
the economic stress—I talked to a 
group of Missouri realtors today, and, 
of course, they are beginning to see 
people wonder if they can afford a 
house at the interest rates that are out 
in front of us. It makes a big difference 
if the interest payment is based on 3.5 
percent interest or 5.5 or 6.5 or 7.5 or, 
as it was in the mid 1980s, 11 to 15 per-
cent interest. 
These are issues we need to get under 
control. Most of these issues have an 
explanation that is rooted in confused 
policy decisions in the administration. 
I look forward to those confused pol-
icy decisions heading in a different di-
rection. Let’s look at the information. 
Let’s be realistic. Let’s not continue to 
see all of these things headed in a di-
rection that makes no common sense 
in America today. 
I yield the floor.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the Senate will re-
sume legislative session and resume 
consideration of the House message to 
accompany H.R. 4521, which the clerk 
will report. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk

search initiative to ensure continued United 
States leadership in engineering biology.

ator from Kentucky. 
MOTION TO INSTRUCT 
Mr. PAUL. Madam President, I call 
up my motion to instruct conferees, 
which is at the desk. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the motion. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. PAUL] 
moves that the managers on the part of the 
Senate at the conference on the disagreeing 
votes of the two Houses on the Senate 
amendment to the bill H.R. 4521 be in-
structed to insist that the final conference 
report include the provisions contained in 
section 6107 of the Senate amendment (relat-
ing to prohibiting funds made available to 
any Federal agency from being used for gain- 
of-function research conducted in China). 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, there will now be 2 
minutes of debate equally divided prior 
to a vote on the Paul motion to in-
struct. 
Mr. PAUL. Last year, the Senate 
unanimously adopted my amendment 
to prevent taxpayer dollars from being 
used to finance gain-of-function re-
search conducted in China. My motion 
to instruct asks that this language be 
incorporated into the final bill. 
Gain-of-function research enhances 
the severity or transmissibility of ex-
isting viruses that may infect humans. 
The dangers are so acute that from 2014 
to 2017, the NIH suspended funding for 
all gain-of-function research projects. 
While we may never know whether 
the pandemic arose from a lab in 
Wuhan 
or 
occurred 
naturally, 
the 
emergence of COVID serves as a re-
minder that dangerous research con-
ducted in a secret and totalitarian 
country is simply too risky to fund. 
Congress must ensure that taxpayer 
dollars will not be used to fund gain-of- 
function research in China. 
I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. 
Mr. KAINE. I yield back all time on 
the Democrats’ side. 
VOTE ON MOTION 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time 
is yielded back. 
The question is on agreeing to the 
motion. 
The motion was agreed to. 
Mr. PAUL. I suggest the absence of a

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2313 
May 4, 2022 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
rise in support of the motion to in-
struct conferees to require the Depart-
ment of Interior to finalize a 5-year off-
shore oil and gas leasing plan no later 
than June 30, 2022. It would require at 
least 10 sales in the Gulf of Mexico and 
Alaska. In consultation with both Sen-
ators RUBIO and SCOTT, it does not im-
pact any moratoriums, including Flor-
ida’s. 
The Biden administration has failed 
to develop a 5-year plan. Gina McCar-
thy has told us why. Last week, she 
said President Biden is absolutely com-
mitted, she said, to blocking additional 
drilling. Jen Psaki confirmed it at the 
White House. 
Instead of begging for oil from our 
enemies, like Iran and Venezuela, we 
should produce more American energy. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
supporting this amendment. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Massachusetts. 
Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, I 
rise to urge my colleagues to vote no 
on this motion to instruct from Sen-
ator BARRASSO. 
If we want to talk solutions to the 
energy price crisis, if we want to talk 
solutions to the climate crisis, we have 
bills to do that. 
Our Federal oil and gas leasing pro-
grams include critical State and public 
involvement that this amendment is 
attempting to undercut and sabotage 
and to try to weaponize this bill in 
order to have the hope of prompting 
yet another giveaway for oil and gas 
companies, which is not going to do a 
thing to help the American people or 
the American economy. 
Oil and gas companies already have 
more than 1,500 offshore leases that 
they are not currently using, encom-
passing a swath of ocean larger than 
the entire State of Maryland. The top 
25 oil and gas companies posted $237 
billion in record profits last year, 
which they should be using, if they 
want, to drill there, but they are not 
doing it. 
So we need to focus on delivering 
clean energy, efficient solutions to 
communities, not undercutting Federal 
processes and giving more handouts to 
Big Oil. 
I urge my colleagues to reject this 
amendment.

MOTION TO INSTRUCT 
Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, I call 
up my motion to instruct conferees, 
which is at the desk. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the motion. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
The Senator from Texas [Mr. CRUZ] moves 
that the managers on the part of the Senate 
at the conference on the disagreeing votes of 
the two Houses on the Senate amendment to 
the bill H.R. 4521 be instructed to insist that 
the final conference report include section 
3258 of the Senate amendment, which re-
quires a report identifying ‘‘major areas of 
diplomatic, energy, infrastructure, banking, 
financial, economic, military, and space co-
operation . . . between the People’s Republic 
of China and the Islamic Republic of Iran’’, 
regarding the policy of the United States to 
limit such cooperation through terrorism-re-
lated sanctions imposed on the Central Bank 
of Iran and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard 
Corps, as such sanctions are necessary to 
limit such cooperation. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, there will now be 2 
minutes of debate, equally divided, 
prior to a vote on the Cruz motion to 
instruct. 
Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, China 
and Iran are two of the most dangerous 
enemies of the United States. China is 
our most significant geopolitical foe 
for the next 100 years. Iran is the 
world’s leading state sponsor of ter-
rorism. 
The Biden administration, unfortu-
nately, has been dealing with both 
from a position of weakness. Specifi-
cally, the Biden administration has re-
fused to enforce oil sanctions against 
Iran, allowing Iran to sell more than a 
million barrels a day of oil primarily 
to China. 
At the same time, the Biden adminis-
tration is negotiating to lift terrorism 
sanctions on the Islamic Revolutionary 
Guard Corps and the Central Bank of 
Iran. The IRGC is responsible for mur-
dering over 600 service men and women. 
The IRGC, right now, is actively trying 
to murder the former Secretary of 
State of the United States and the 
former National Security Advisor. 
If you support terrorism sanctions on 
the IRGC, you should vote yes, and if 
you want to lift those sanctions, you 
should vote no. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The jun-
ior Senator from Connecticut. 
Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, the 
provision in the underlying bill that 
Senator CRUZ’s motion argues for is a 
good one in that we should care about 
cooperation between China and Iran, 
but I would encourage my colleagues to 
oppose this MTI because of another ex-
traneous provision in the motion. 
The motion argues that the United 
States should tie our Iran terrorism 
sanctions to our China policy, and 
that, frankly, is a bad idea. Terrorism- 
related sanctions are about punishing 
and deterring support for terrorism. If 
we want to use sanctions to deter co-
operation between Iran and China, then 
we should craft those tailored sanc-
tions; but to tie our Iran terrorism 
sanctions to our China policy would 
have the effect, really, of muddying the 
waters about the purpose of terrorism 
sanctions. Terrorism sanctions should 
be about stopping terrorism—period, 
stop. If we start applying terrorism 
sanctions for other purposes, it weak-
ens our entire anti-terror strategy. 
For that reason, I would urge opposi-
tion to the motion.

MOTION TO INSTRUCT 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I 
call up my motion to instruct, which is 
at the desk. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the motion. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. MENEN-
DEZ] moves that the managers on the part of 
the Senate at the conference on the dis-
agreeing votes of the two Houses on the Sen-
ate amendment to the bill H.R. 4521 be in-
structed to insist upon the provisions con-
tained in section 73003 of the Senate amend-
ment (relating to establishment of an Inspec-
tor General of the Office of the United States 
Trade Representative). 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, there will be 2 min-
utes of debate equally divided prior to 
the vote on the Menendez motion to in-
struct. 
The Senator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, this 
motion would establish an inspector 
general at the Office of the U.S. Trade 
Representative. 
As we have seen over the past several 
years, inspectors general are a key way 
that Congress conducts oversight over 
our 
Federal 
Government. 
Through 
these independent watchdogs, we pre-
vent waste, fraud, and abuse, increas-
ing transparency while ensuring Fed-
eral Agencies remain accountable to 
the American people. It is a model that 
most of the Federal bureaucracy has 
adopted because it works. 
When it comes to the Office of the 
U.S. Trade Representative, it remains 
an outlier—one of the only Cabinet- 
level Agencies without this key over-
sight tool. An Agency led by a Senate- 
confirmed appointee, tasked with car-
rying out decisions affecting every 
worker, business, and consumer in this 
country, is currently operating with-
out one of the most effective guardrails 
we have against overreach. Just a few 
years ago, Congress saw how two nego-
tiators for USMCA were using their po-
sitions to solicit consulting work on 
the regulations they had written. We 
saw how the Agency’s opaque tariff ex-
clusion process was beset by incon-
sistent decision making and political 
favoritism. 
This is an amendment that has been 
sponsored by over 53 Senators, Repub-
licans and Democrats alike. It passed 
in USICA originally with a 91-to-4 vote. 
I urge my colleagues to support it. I 
am happy to take a voice vote.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there 
is no further debate, the question is on 
agreeing to the motion. 
The motion was agreed to.

MOTION TO INSTRUCT 
Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I call up 
my motion to instruct conferees, which 
is at the desk. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the motion. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
The Senator from Idaho [Mr. RISCH] moves 
that the managers on the part of the Senate 
at the conference on the disagreeing votes of 
the two Houses on the Senate amendment to 
the bill H.R. 4521 be instructed to insist that 
the final conference report include provi-
sions that take actionable steps to address 
the risks of and counter malign or undue in-
fluence and activities in the United States 
and abroad by the Chinese Communist 
Party, the Government of the People’s Re-
public of China, or individuals or entities 
acting on their behalf. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, there will now be 2 
minutes of debate equally divided prior 
to a vote on the Risch motion to in-
struct. 
The Senator from Idaho. 
Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I didn’t 
stop the reading because it is pretty 
self-explanatory what this is. 
There was language in S. 1260 when it 
left here and went over to the House, 
under division C, that would have 
strengthened the ability of the United 
States to counter Chinese influence 
abroad. Specifically, the influence we 
are talking about here in one par-
ticular case especially is what is going 
on in colleges and universities around 
the country. 
What this does is put some very clear 
windows into what the Chinese Com-
munist Party is doing on college cam-
puses, particularly as it relates to 
grants and money that they are put-
ting into the colleges and universities. 
We are asking and directing the nego-
tiators to see that there is such lan-
guage in the final bill that comes out.

The legislative clerk read as follows: 
The Senator from Arizona [Mr. KELLY] 
moves that the managers on the part of the 
Senate at the conference on the disagreeing 
votes of the two Houses on the Senate 
amendment to the bill H.R. 4521 be in-
structed to insist that the final conference 
report include incentives to support invest-
ments in semiconductor manufacturing and 
innovation in the United States, including 
investments in the fabrication, assembly, 
testing, advanced packaging, and research 
and development of semiconductors. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, there will now be 2 
minutes of debate equally divided prior 
to the vote on the Kelly motion to in-
struct. 
Mr. 
KELLY. 
Mr. 
President, 
microchips are in everything from 
household vacuums to the most ad-
vanced fighter jets. A resilient domes-
tic microchip supply chain is impor-
tant to our national security and to 
our economy, but we have two prob-
lems. We are facing a shortage of 
microchips, and we do not have the ca-
pacity to produce enough of them here 
in the United States. That is why we 
have worked together, Republicans and 
Democrats, to pass a plan in the Sen-
ate competitiveness bill that will boost 
American microchip manufacturing ca-
pacity, create thousands of jobs, and 
help lower costs for families. 
I ask my colleagues to support this 
motion to show the continued bipar-
tisan momentum behind our plan so we 
can get this across the finish line. 
I am OK with a voice vote.

the bill H.R. 4521 be instructed to insist that 
the final conference report not include the 
provisions contained in the following sec-
tions of the bill (as passed by the House of 
Representatives): 
(1) Section 30609 (relating to building 
United States economic growth and techno-
logical innovation through the Green Cli-
mate Fund). 
(2) Section 30607 (relating to addressing 
international climate change mitigation, ad-
aptation, and security). 
(3) Section 30601(b)(7)(E) (relating to the 
sense of Congress on implementing the Paris 
Agreement). 
(4) Section 30610 (relating to ensuring a 
whole-of-government response to climate ac-
tion). 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, there will now be 2 
minutes of debate equally divided prior 
to a vote on the Lee motion to in-
struct. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, Americans 
are facing an affordability crisis. In my 
home State of Utah, the average house-
hold is having to pay an additional $702 
every month just for basic living ex-
penses relative to what they paid every 
month at the beginning of last year. 
Inflation is unsustainable. Energy is 
one primary driver of inflation, and 
this administration’s senseless energy 
policies are largely to blame. The 
House’s version of this bill contains 
more of these damaging policies that 
will hurt Americans, and hurt Utahns 
in particular, while they can least af-
ford it. 
My motion instructs conferees not to 
include the House provisions, including 
one sending $2 billion per year indefi-
nitely to developing countries to sup-
port their supply of zero emissions ve-
hicles; another provision that would 
send $8 billion to the U.N.’s green cli-
mate fund, which has historically given 
money to China; as well as another 
provision expressing the sense of Con-
gress that the United States should im-
plement the Paris Agreement, which is 
estimated to lead to a 20 percent in-
crease in the costs for the average 
American family’s electric bill and 
shrink our national GDP by $2.5 tril-
lion. 
Americans can’t afford these energy 
policies. My motion will make sure 
that they don’t have to pay for them. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, if 
we want friends overseas and if we 
want a robust world economy, it is im-
portant that America plays fair with 
the rest of the world on climate. Par-
ticipating in the international climate 
fund, participating in the Paris accord 
and the COP agreements, and having a 
robust national strategy on climate 
change are all distinctly in our na-
tional security and economic interests. 
I urge voting no on the Lee motion to 
instruct, and I further urge that if we 
want to protect the American con-
sumer, get the heck off of fossil fuel be-
fore it drives us into ruin with high 
prices set by international cartels and 
massive pollution.

Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-

conferees which is at the desk. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the motion. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
The Senator from Tennessee [Mrs. BLACK-
BURN] moves that the managers on the part 
of the Senate at the conference on the dis-
agreeing votes of the two Houses on the Sen-
ate amendment to the bill H.R. 4521 be in-

report include a provision that requires the 
Director of the Office of Management and 
Budget, in consultation with the Adminis-
trator of General Services, the Director of 
the National Institute of Standards and 
Technology, the Director of the Cybersecu-
rity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the 
Director of National Intelligence, the Sec-
retary of Defense, the Secretary of State, the 
Secretary of the Treasury, and the Chairman 
of the Board of Governors of the Federal Re-
serve System, and consistent with informa-
tion security requirements designed to ad-
dress any national security risks, to develop 
guidance for executive agencies requiring 
adequate security measures for any transfer, 
storage, or use of digital yuan on informa-
tion technology. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, there will now be 2 
minutes of debate, equally divided, 
prior to the vote on the Blackburn mo-
tion to instruct. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, if we continue to ignore the 
threat posed by the digital yuan, Bei-
jing will use this technology to in-
crease its surveillance capacity, avoid 
U.S. sanctions, and threaten the domi-
nance of the U.S. dollar in the global 
trade. 
This is the reason for this motion. 
This motion would require the man-
agers to include a simple provision 
that will require OMB to work with our 
executive Agencies to put some much 
needed security measures in place. 
We cannot afford to look the other 
way while the CCP increases its own 
global power at the expense of the free 
world and is looking for opportunities 
to use the digital yuan to increase sur-
veillance. 
I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on the motion.

Mr. COTTON. Madam President, the

keep up with the Democrats’ own rate 
of inflation. The President even denies 
that China is waging a cold war against 
us. 
And while we are shortchanging our 
own military against a dangerous com-
munist 
adversary, 
the 
Government 
wants to send $8 billion of your money 
to a U.N. boondoggle called the Green 
Climate Fund. 
If anyone should be paying for a 
Green Climate Fund, it should be the 
Chinese communists, the world’s worst 
polluters—not American taxpayers. 
My proposal is simple. Instead of giv-
ing that $8 billion to the United Na-
tions to waste on climate schemes and 
corruption, we should send it to our 
troops and help rebuild our military. 
The U.N. or the U.S. military? It is 
an easy choice. I urge my colleagues to 
support the motion. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam Presi-
dent, this is the second shot that has 
been taken this afternoon at the inter-
national climate fund by our friends on 
the other side. 
America is a great and powerful na-
tion, and it is usually good for great 
and powerful nations not to be a jerk, 
and therefore sticking up for the coun-
tries that are suffering because of cli-
mate pollution is something that a 
great and powerful nation ought to do. 
Don’t be a jerk and clean up your 
own messes are two things that I 
learned as a child. And I think that our 
national security and our economic ad-
vantage are both served by actually 
supporting the international climate 
fund and helping the world work its 
way through the predicament that the 
fossil fuel industry has foisted on us. I 
urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on this.

gress, as reported to the Senate on December 
17, 2021. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, there will be now 2 
minutes of debate equally divided prior 
to a vote on the Murkowski motion to 
instruct. 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, 
the Senator from Rhode Island and I 
have offered a motion related to our bi-
partisan BLUE GLOBE Act. This is leg-
islation that focuses on our oceans. 
They are a key source of food for us. 
They produce most of the oxygen we 
need to breathe. They help us maintain 
our global climate. But we largely ig-
nore them, unfortunately. 
We haven’t done nearly enough to ad-
dress overfishing, pollution, and acidi-
fication. According to NOAA, we have 
actually mapped more of the moon 
than we have our oceans. So BLUE 
GLOBE will help change that by im-
proving data collection, accelerating 
ocean-focused innovation, and taking 
other important steps. It will help 
strengthen 
our 
economy, 
protect 
against China’s illegal fishing, and bol-
ster our national security along the 
coasts. 
It received unanimous consent sup-
port from the Commerce Committee. It 
is a perfect fit for a bill on competi-
tiveness, so I would urge the Senate to 
support this motion to instruct con-
ferees to include BLUE GLOBE in the 
final bill.

newable energy project receiving Federal fi-
nancial assistance, a subsidy, or any other fi-
nancing mechanism authorized under the 
final conference report, such as a grant or 
tax credit, from purchasing materials, tech-
nology, or critical minerals mined, produced,

of China or the Russian Federation. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, there will now be 2 
minutes of debate equally divided prior 
to a vote on the Sullivan motion to in-
struct. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, as 
recently as the early 1980s, our Nation 
produced the vast majority of the crit-
ical minerals and renewable energy 
technology we use in America but not 
anymore. Unfortunately, Russia and 
particularly China have a stranglehold 
on most of these critical minerals and 
clean energy technology that our Na-
tion needs. 
To make matters worse, Madam 
President, some of these critical min-
erals and materials we are importing, 
like solar panels and EV batteries, are 
processed and manufactured in China 
using forced labor in some of the worst 
environmental standards in the world. 
Madam President, may I have 30 sec-
onds to complete my statement?

objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. We can change this,

I urge my colleagues to vote yes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, this 
Congress and the Clean Energy for 
America legislation, which passed the 
Senate Finance Committee, is the best 
opportunity in the past decade for bold 
action that deals not just with the 
threat of climate change but gives us a 
chance to get those big investments 
here in the United States with domes-
tic manufacturing and good jobs—an 
economic win-win. 
Our country should be doing every-
thing possible to invest in a tech-
nology-neutral, 
private-sector-driven 
approach to promote a clean energy fu-
ture, including investing in renewable 
energy projects, including the manu-
facturing of solar, wind, and other 
technologies here at home. 
Further, I would note that our coun-
try has a clear prohibition on products 
made with forced labor that is restrict-
ing and will continue to restrict renew-
able energy products produced with 
forced labor in China from entering the 
United States. 
My friend, whom I always like work-
ing with, introduces a new, vague re-
striction that would unfortunately tie 
our hands, limit our businesses’ ability 
to source necessary materials for their 
products with vague and overly broad 
restrictions. 
I urge my colleagues to oppose the 
motion.

Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, I call

which is at the desk. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the motion. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
The Senator from Florida [Mr. RUBIO] 
moves that the managers on the part of the 
Senate at the conference on the disagreeing 
votes of the two Houses on the Senate 
amendment to the bill H.R. 4521 be in-
structed to insist that the final conference 
report include a Federal Government-based 
counterintelligence review to certify recipi-
ents of grants, funding, awards, or other re-
sources provided, and intellectual property 
developed, as a result of the conference re-
port, have national security protections in 
place to prohibit misappropriation and theft 
of Federal resources. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, there will now be 2 
minutes of debate equally divided prior 
to a vote on the Rubio motion to in-
struct. 
The Senator from Florida. 
Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, this 
will not take long. 
I don’t think anybody at this point is 
unaware that China steals the things 
that we in America innovate: our re-
search, our ingenuity, our products, 
our secrets. They steal it. So we are 
about to spend tens of billions of dol-
lars on research, and if we are going to 
do that, I think we should take steps to 
make sure that the tens of billions 
aren’t also stolen. 
It doesn’t make a lot of sense—and 
most people would agree—to spend all 
of this public money on research with-
out enough protections to keep the 
Chinese from stealing it. So what this 
motion to instruct would do is it would 
ensure that the government under-
takes a counterintelligence review to 
certify that the entities that are get-
ting this public money—either through 
direct funding or through intellectual 
property developed as a result—have 
national security protections against 
the theft of American research and re-
sources. 
What this would ensure is that there 
are protections in place to strengthen 
the bill’s research funding accounting 
requirements in section 2307 and to en-
sure review of the funding for univer-
sity technology centers. 
If this bill is to truly be the America 
COMPETES Act, we need to make sure 
that America’s funding and grants and 
other taxpayer resources are not going 
to be stolen by our adversaries to beat 
us using our own money. 
I ask my colleagues to vote yes on 
the motion to instruct.

The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. JOHNSON] 
moves that the managers on the part of the 
Senate at the conference on the disagreeing 
votes of the two Houses on the Senate 
amendment to the bill H.R. 4521 be in-
structed to reject any proposals to prohibit 
the possession, acquirement, receipt, trans-
portation, sale, or purchase of mink raised in 
captivity in the United States for fur produc-
tion. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, there will now be 2 
minutes of debate equally divided prior 
to a vote on the Johnson motion to in-
struct. 
The Senator from Wisconsin. 
Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, 
this is truly one of the more inappro-
priate additions that the House made 
to this bill: to ban the production of 
farming of mink for the production of 
fur. I have no idea why they have in-
cluded it here. It makes no sense to be 
included. Actually, in Wisconsin, it 
supports hundreds of jobs and produces 
exports to China. 
So my motion simply instructs the 
conferees to reject any proposal that 
would ban mink farming. 
I want to thank Senators ROMNEY, 
DAINES, and BOOZMAN for their support 
of this amendment, and I urge my col-
leagues to support American farmers 
by voting in favor of this motion to in-
struct. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
Mr. BOOKER. Madam President, the 
instruction by my colleague from Wis-
consin directs conferees to reject bipar-
tisan House language that addresses a 
serious public health concern related 
to mink farming. 
Mink farms in Europe and the United 
States have spawned five COVID–19 
variants that have collectively infected 
thousands of people. The next mink 
variant could infect millions of people. 
Vaccinations do not prevent infection 
or transmission in mink, and the risk 
of virus mutation on mink farms re-
mains significant. 
Today, there are only 60 mink farms 
left in the United States, and they sell 
their furs to buyers in China, not here. 
Americans have stopped buying fur be-
cause keeping these semiaquatic wild 
animals in cages and breaking their 
necks to kill them for fur is inhumane. 
More than a dozen European coun-
tries have already phased out mink 
farming because of the serious pan-
demic risks they present. The United 
States should immediately follow suit. 
I urge my colleagues, for the health 
of our country, to join me in voting no 
on this motion to instruct. 
VOTE ON MOTION 
I ask for the yeas and nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond. 
The question is on agreeing to the 
motion. 
The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
called the roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the 
Senator from Colorado (Mr. BENNET), 
the Senator from Nevada (Ms. CORTEZ 
MASTO), the Senator from New Mexico

The motion was agreed to. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
OSSOFF). The Senator from Vermont. 
MOTION TO INSTRUCT 
Mr. SANDERS. I call up my motion 
to instruct, which is at the desk. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the motion. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
The Senator from Vermont [Mr. SANDERS] 
moves that the managers on the part of the 
Senate at the conference on the disagreeing 
votes of the two Houses on the Senate 
amendment to the bill H.R. 4521 be in-
structed to insist that the final conference 
report include provisions that require each 
beneficiary of Federal financial assistance 
for 
semiconductor 
manufacturing 
to 
be 
banned from purchasing the stock of the ben-
eficiary, from outsourcing employment op-
portunities of the beneficiary to any country 
outside of the United States, and from re-
pealing any collective bargaining require-
ments of the beneficiary, and that require 
each such beneficiary to issue warrants and 
equity stakes in the enterprise of the bene-
ficiary to the Federal Government and to re-
main neutral in any union organizing effort 
of the employees of the beneficiary. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, there will now be 2 
minutes of debate, equally divided, 
prior to a vote on the Sanders motion 
to instruct. 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, no one 
disagrees that we need to manufacture 
more microchips here in the United 
States, but we should not be providing 
a $53 billion blank check to the highly 
profitable microchip industry with no 
protections for the American taxpayer. 
The five companies that will likely 
receive the lion’s share of this funding: 
Intel, Texas Instruments, Samsung, 
Micron Technology, and Global Found-
ries made over $75 billion in profits last 
year and spent over $18 billion on stock 
buybacks. 
We have strange priorities here in 
the Senate. We can’t extend the child 
tax credit to combat child poverty. We 
can’t deal with the crisis in childcare. 
We can’t provide dental care to seniors 
on Medicare. We can’t deal with cli-
mate change. But somehow we can pro-
vide a massive amount of corporate 
welfare to a handful of corporations. 
The motion I am offering today 
would instruct the conferees to impose 
the following conditions on companies 
receiving this assistance: They must 
agree to issue warrants or equity 
stakes to the Federal Government. 
If private corporations are going to 
benefit from $53 billion in taxpayer 
welfare, the financial gains must be 
shared with the American people—not 
just wealthy stockholders. Further, 
these companies must agree to not buy 
back their own stock, not outsource 
American jobs, not repeal existing col-
lective bargaining agreements, and re-
main neutral in union organizing ef-
forts. 
What we are talking about here is 
not a radical idea. These exact condi-
tions, word for word, were included in 
the 
bipartisan 
CARES 
Act, 
which 
passed the Senate 96 to 0. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator’s time is expired. 
The Senator from Ohio. 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise in 
opposition to Senator SANDERS’ motion 
to instruct. 
When America invented the semicon-
ductor 40 years ago, we produced near-
ly half of the world’s semiconductors. 
Today, we produce less than 10 percent. 
Look what happened: Plants shut 
down across Ohio. Whirlpool, Ford, 
GM—forced to idle plants because of 
the ‘‘spread out all over the world’’ 
supply chain. 
We passed the CHIPS Act 2 years ago. 
I thank Senator CANTWELL who—what 
she has done to stop this, encourage 
more production of these chips at 
home. 
This bill will fund—this legislation 
will fund the bill Congress already 
passed. It is not a bailout. It is critical 
to my State—10,000 good jobs, 5,000 
building trades—union building trades 
jobs paying prevailing wage for the 
next 10 years. It is an incentive pro-
gram. 
The EU, China, Taiwan, South Korea 
all provide incentives to make these 
chips domestically. None of them re-
quire stock warrants. 
Everybody in this body knows my po-
sition in opposition to the financial 
services industry to stock buybacks. 
You can count on that. 
I yield my final 30 seconds to Senator 
WICKER. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Mississippi. 
Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, there 
are already significant taxpayer man-
dates in the bill, as it is limiting award 
size, prohibiting funds from going to 
so-called 
foreign 
entities, 
such 
as 
China, and clawback provisions. 
Why do we need chips? 
We need chips for Javelin missiles. 
We need them for—major weapons sys-
tems contain thousands of chips. The 
Arleigh Burke-class destroyer includes 
250,000 chips. 
It would make it much harder for 
Americans to produce these chips if the 
Sanders amendment were to pass. 
I urge a no vote, and I join my friend 
from Ohio in urging a no vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time 
is expired on the motion. 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, may I 
have 30 seconds in response? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
Mr. SANDERS. No one debates the 
need for chips. But to my friend from 
Ohio, I would say: You are right. We 
lost tens of thousands of jobs over the 
last 20 years. You know why? Because 
the same microchip companies shut 
down plants in America to go for cheap 
labor in Asia, and now we are reward-
ing them with $53 billion in corporate 
welfare. 
For all of my friends who talk about 
the deficit and how we can’t fund the 
needs of our children or the elderly, $53 
billion going to some of the most prof-
itable corporations in America without 
any taxpayer protection is an absolute 
outrage. 
Let’s vote for this proposal. 
VOTE ON MOTION 
Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I ask for 
the yeas and nays. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
question is on agreeing to the motion. 
Is there a sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond.

The legislative clerk called the roll.

MOTION TO INSTRUCT 
Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous 
consent 
that, 
notwith-
standing the previous order, it be in 
order to offer my motion to instruct at 
this time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I call up 
my motion to instruct conferees, which 
is at the desk. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the motion. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
The Senator from Montana [Mr. DAINES] 
moves that the managers on the part of the 
Senate at the conference on the disagreeing 
votes of the two Houses on the Senate 
amendment to the bill H.R. 4521 be in-
structed to reject provisions that weaken the 
energy security of the United States, pro-
hibit the development of an all-of-the-above 
energy portfolio, or direct funds to foreign 
entities for international climate objectives. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, there will now be 2 
minutes of debate, equally divided, 
prior to a vote on the Daines motion to 
instruct. 
Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, if we 
have learned anything over the past 
few months, it is the importance of 
supporting ‘‘Made in America’’ energy. 
Since Europe has divested in tradi-
tional energy, Vladimir Putin has 
weaponized it and has Europe over a 
barrel. This is the path America is 
headed down if the administration con-
tinues to stonewall traditional Amer-
ican energy development. 
For the sake of our national security, 
we must unleash American energy pro-
duction, which includes an ‘‘all of the 
above’’ energy portfolio with renew-
ables, hydropower, oil, gas, nuclear, 
and coal. Energy security is national 
security, and a global, energy-domi-
nant America is a safer world. 
We should also not be sending money 
to China like the House bill does in a 
package that is meant to help us win 
the race against China. It just doesn’t 
make sense. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
motion to instruct and reject the pro-
visions from the House that weaken 
the energy security of the United 
States. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise 
in opposition to this motion to instruct 
for one simple reason: It is up to Amer-
ica to lead the world in reducing the 
use of fossil fuels and in pivoting to re-
newable energy. Yet this motion to in-
struct says we cannot do anything to 
help foreign entities address any aspect 
of the climate objective: not to fight 
forest fires that come from climate 
change, not to address the salinization 
or the acidification of the sea, not to 
address reforestation or deforestation. 
It is up to America to help make sure 
that we provide nonfossil fuel energy 
for the future that will help us all ad-
dress this huge list of issues. It is im-
portant that we lead the world, not ne-
glect the world.

shire. 
MOTION TO INSTRUCT 
Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous 
consent 
that, 
notwith-
standing the previous order, it be in 
order to offer my motion to instruct at 
this time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, I call up 
my motion to instruct, which is at the 
desk. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the motion. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
The Senator from New Hampshire [Ms. 
HASSAN] moves that the managers on the 
part of the Senate at the conference on the 
disagreeing votes of the two Houses on the 
Senate amendment to the bill H.R. 4521 be 
instructed to insist that the final conference 
report include provisions that expand the re-
search and development tax credit for small 
businesses and preserve full and immediate 
expensing for research and development in-
vestments. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, there will now be 2 
minutes of debate, equally divided, 
prior to a vote on the Hassan motion to 
instruct. 
Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to offer a bipartisan motion with 
Senator YOUNG
that will help fuel 
American innovation. 
The research and development tax 
credit gives critical support to small 
businesses and startups that power our 
economy. By strengthening the R&D 
tax credit for startups and preserving 
other tax incentives for research here 
in America, we can outcompete coun-
tries like China. 
I would also like to thank the addi-
tional 16 Senators supporting the mo-
tion: Senators BALDWIN, MARSHALL, 
FEINSTEIN, SASSE, WARNOCK, BLUNT, 
KELLY, PORTMAN, PADILLA, FISCHER, 
COONS, BOOZMAN, CORTEZ MASTO, CAP-
ITO, ROSEN, and WICKER. 
I yield to the Senator from Indiana. 
Mr. YOUNG. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak for 1 
minute. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. YOUNG. Mr. President, I thank 
my colleague from New Hampshire. 
This bill is about maintaining our 
competitiveness with China. 
We cannot compete with China with-
out robust domestic R&D. A company 
investing $100 in R&D in China this 
year will get a $200 deduction. In Amer-
ica, that company investing $100 would 
only get to deduct $10 this year. 
We must not lose out on innovation 
and production to China. I ask my col-
leagues to support this motion and sup-
port domestic R&D. Every day we wait 
is another day we fall behind. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, recent 
polls suggest that Congress has a 19- 
percent favorability rating, and I find 
that shocking. Clearly, if that 19 per-
cent had any inkling as to what goes 
on here in the Senate, that number 
would be much lower. 
Over and over again, I hear Members 
of the Senate express their deep con-
cerns about the deficit. ‘‘Oh, my God, 
our deficit.’’ We can’t maintain a child 
tax credit to cut child poverty, and we 
can’t make sure that senior citizens on 
Medicare have teeth in their mouths— 
we just can’t afford it—but, appar-
ently, we can afford to provide $125 bil-
lion in tax breaks over the next 4 years 
to some of the most profitable corpora-
tions in America, including Amazon, 
Intel, AT&T, Boeing, you name it. 
This amendment would repeal—now, 
this is amazing, and I say this to my 
Democratic colleagues. This amend-
ment would repeal a modest tax in-
crease on profitable corporations that 
President Donald Trump pushed to par-
tially offset the cost of his massive tax 
giveaway to the rich a few years ago. 
This was Trump’s initiative to kind of 
cover the tax breaks he gave to billion-
aires and large corporations. If this 
amendment were enacted, Lockheed 
Martin and Raytheon would receive a 
$2 billion tax break each year, and Nor-
throp Grumman would receive a $1 bil-
lion tax break. 
Is that what we are in the business of 
doing, telling working families we 
can’t help them but that we are giving 
huge tax breaks to some of the wealthi-
est and most profitable corporations in 
America? 
I urge my colleagues to vote against 
this motion. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Hampshire. 
Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak for 10 
more seconds. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Ms. HASSAN. Our R&D proposal is 
critical to helping small businesses and 
to investing in R&D here at home to 
help us outcompete countries like 
China. 
There is strong bipartisan support for 
this measure.

MOTION TO INSTRUCT 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. I call up my 
motion, which is at the desk. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the motion. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
The Senator from Florida [Mr. SCOTT] 
moves that the managers on the part of the 
Senate at the conference on the disagreeing 
votes of the two Houses on the Senate 
amendment to the bill H.R. 4521 be in-
structed to insist that the final conference 
report include provisions that ensure that 
any taxpayer funds spent in the bill, includ-
ing those provided to universities and pri-
vate sector corporations, are subject to com-
prehensive return on investment analyses 
and claw back provisions, and corresponding 
timely reports on the use of such funds to 
Congress and the American public. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, there will now be 2 
minutes of debate equally divided prior 
to the vote on the Scott motion to in-
struct. 
The Senator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
this government is $30 trillion in debt, 
and Congress is working every day to 
spend money like it is burning a hole 
in our pocket. This bill has billions of 
spending, billions of taxpayer dollars, 
and zero mandates for return on invest-
ment. That is crazy. It is crazy and il-
logical. No American would make a 
deal like this for their business or their 
family. Congress shouldn’t do it with 
your tax dollars either. 
The conferees must ensure this bill 
makes all taxpayer funds subject to a 
comprehensive 
return-on-investment 
analysis with clawback provisions and 
mandate a report on how every dollar 
is spent. 
We 
used 
taxpayer 
dollars 
to 
incentivize private sector growth when 
I was Governor of Florida. It helped 
bring businesses to my State and cre-
ate jobs. But we always had return-on- 
investment metrics and clawbacks for

payer. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
Ms. 
CANTWELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
speaking against my colleague, I am 
sure he is well-meaning, but the lan-
guage in this underlying amendment 
would condition the funds of this bill. 
Say the taxpayer money provided to 
universities on research—think about 
what we do today with universities on 
a lot of subjects. Just ask yourself, 
would you ever have an ROI on the 
COVID vaccine? basic research around 
lifesaving medicine? It took 60 years to 
prove the return on that investment. 
There are underlying DARPA funds in 
this bill. Do you think that all of those 
DARPA funds showed return on invest-
ment? Say goodbye to those moneys. 
This also says that it can be condi-
tioned for a clawback. Who? So nuclear 
research done by one institution and 
one administration but not liked by 
the next administration is clawed 
back? I think we have trusted our uni-
versities to do this research for us, and 
that is what a research economy is 
about. 
We need to dust off our R&D skills 
and make these investments and make 
the commitments. The underlying bill 
has safeguards on spending in the bill. 
I ask my colleagues to vote no on 
this motion to instruct.

MOTION TO INSTRUCT 
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, I call up 
my motion to instruct conferees, which

OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the motion. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
The Senator from Iowa [Ms. ERNST] moves 
that the managers on the part of the Senate 
at the conference on the disagreeing votes of 
the two Houses on the Senate amendment to 
the bill H.R. 4521 be instructed to reject the 
provision as agreed to by the House of Rep-
resentatives that would reauthorize the 
Small Business Innovation Research and 
Small Business Technology Transfer pro-
grams under section 9 of the Small Business 
Act (15 U.S.C. 638) without authorization to 
prevent the Russian Federation and the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China from acquiring tech-
nology critical to national security devel-
oped through programs of the Small Busi-
ness Administration and participating Fed-
eral agencies. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, there will now be 2 
minutes of debate equally divided prior 
to the vote on the Ernst motion to in-
struct. 
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, the Small 
Business 
Innovation 
Research 
and 
Small Business Technology Transfer 
Programs provide critical innovation 
support to America’s small businesses. 
While this program is celebrating 40 
years in business, SBIR continues to be 
exploited by foreign adversaries due to 
lack of controls within the programs to 
prevent the transfer of new American 
technology to our adversaries. 
China has become one of the largest 
beneficiaries of the SBIR Programs be-
cause of the lack of adequate oversight. 
China and other foreign adversaries, 
like Putin’s Russia, know this and 
have been establishing shell compa-
nies, acquiring beneficial ownership in 
American enterprises, selecting key 
awardee personnel for talent recruit-
ment, and other state-directed tech-
nology acquisition. China has also in-
filtrated businesses known as SBIR 
mills that have won numerous grants. 
This is a clear national security 
threat and is wholly unacceptable. Se-
rious and comprehensive due diligence 
reforms are needed to combat adver-
sarial foreign influence in these pro-
grams and to protect our national se-
curity. 
I ask my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle to support this effort. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I agree 
with my colleague that the SBIR Pro-
gram and the STTR Program are crit-
ical to our American small businesses. 
It offers them incredible opportunities 
to develop technology important for 
our Nation. I also agree with my col-
league that it is important we prevent 
critical national security technology 
developed by the programs from being 
acquired by China and Russia. 
I do point out that if you look at the 
COMPETES Act, there are safeguards 
to prevent our foreign adversaries from 
acquiring 
sensitive 
technology—and 
not just China and Russia but all for-
eign countries of concern, including 
Iran and North Korea. This effort

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Hearing

The motion was agreed to. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-

MOTION TO INSTRUCT 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I 
call up my motion to instruct, which is 
at the desk. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the motion. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
The 
Senator 
from 
Oklahoma 
[Mr. 
LANKFORD] moves that the managers on the 
part of the Senate at the conference on the 
disagreeing votes of the two Houses on the 
Senate amendment to the bill H.R. 4521 be 
instructed to insist that the final conference 
report include provisions requiring that any 
agreement negotiated by the United States 
with the Islamic Republic of Iran addressing 
Iran’s development of nuclear weapons— 
(1) also includes provisions addressing the 
full range of Iran’s destabilizing activities, 
including development of the means of deliv-
ery for such weapons (such as ballistic mis-
siles), support for terrorism, and evasion of 
sanctions by individuals, entities, and ves-
sels in the trade of petroleum products with 
the People’s Republic of China; 
(2) does not lift sanctions on the Islamic 
Revolutionary Guard Corps; and 
(3) does not revoke the designation of the 
Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a for-
eign terrorist organization under section 219 
of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 
U.S.C. 1189). 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, there will now be 2 
minutes of debate equally divided prior 
to the vote on the Lankford motion to 
instruct. 
The Senator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, we 
are about to go into conference on 
what we are basically calling the China 
bill, but this bill does not address Chi-
na’s practice of purchasing and stock-
piling sanctioned Iranian oil on the 
black market. 
This procurement spike by China is 
directly correlated with the spike in 
terrorist activities by Iran and its 
proxies in the Middle East. Iran is 
laundering these petroleum products 
and illicitly transferring the oil at sea 
to Iranian tankers and foreign-flagged 
vessels. Three-quarters of this oil is ul-
timately exported to China, which pur-
chased 310 million barrels of oil from 
Iran last year. All of this is happening 
while China is actually negotiating di-
rectly with Iran on our behalf in Vi-
enna. 
This particular motion to instruct 
goes straight at this illicit activity 
from Iran that is facilitating the terror 
activities and also addresses the des-
ignation that Iran is asking if they are 
going to negotiate with the Biden ad-
ministration on the Iran nuclear deal. 
Iran is specifically asking that they 
get a lift of the ‘‘foreign terrorist orga-
nization’’ on the Islamic Revolutionary 
Guard Corps. That is the group that 
was attacking our troops in Iraq and 
facilitating their death. 
We need to address this and take it 
off the table so that Iran does not get 
by with this and the Islamic Revolu-
tionary Guard Corps does not. 
I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on my motion to 
instruct. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I would 
urge opposition to this motion. 
This motion asks the Senate to en-
dorse President Trump’s Iran policy—a 
policy that, if you didn’t notice, was a 
complete, total failure. 
The motion calls for a provision in 
the underlying bill to prohibit a return 
to the JCPOA and to keep Trump’s 
‘‘maximum pressure’’ campaign intact 
until a mythical comprehensive agree-
ment is achieved with Iran, inclusive of 
all their malevolent behavior. This pol-
icy just hasn’t worked. To apply it pro-
spectively would be ruinous. 
Friends, Iran is weeks away from 
having enough nuclear material for a 
weapon. To deny this administration 
the ability to enter into a nuclear 
agreement isn’t just folly; it is down-
right dangerous. 
I wish a comprehensive agreement 
with Iran was possible, but 4 years of 
failure by President Trump was proof 
that, for the time being, it is not. We 
should not endorse 4 more years of this 
failed Iran policy. 
I urge opposition.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2322 
May 4, 2022 
We have already voted to give $53 bil-
lion 
in 
corporate 
welfare 
to 
the 
microchip industry. We voted to give 
$125 billion in tax breaks to some of the 
wealthiest corporations in the country. 
But now we have the opportunity to 
do even better. We can give $10 billion 
to Jeff Bezos, the second wealthiest 
person in this country, who is the 
owner of the space company Blue Ori-
gin. 
Clearly, Mr. Bezos desperately needs 
this Federal assistance. He is only 
worth $150 billion, and with all of his 
lawyers and accountants, in a given 
year, he pays nothing in Federal in-
come taxes. 
He is the owner of Amazon, which in 
a given year also pays nothing in Fed-
eral income taxes. 
Mr. Bezos has enough money to buy a 
$500 million yacht, $175 million estate 
in Beverly Hills, and a $23 million man-
sion here in Washington. 
I am sure that your constituents will 
be very excited to hear that you are 
going to give him this $10 billion, 
which he clearly desperately needs. 
Further, for those people here who 
believe in trade unions, Mr. Bezos has 
spent millions of dollars at Amazon 
preventing workers at Amazon from 
exercising their constitutional right to 
form a union. 
He is part of Amazon, a company 
that has been fined over and over again 
for violating the law. 
Mr. President, at a time when 70 mil-
lion are uninsured, when 600,000 people 
are homeless in this country, when we 
are seeing a growing gap between the 
very rich and everybody else, it does 
not make a lot of sense to give $10 bil-
lion to the second wealthiest person in 
this country. 
I urge my colleagues to vote yes on 
this motion. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alabama. 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Mr. President, 
NASA 
recognizes 
that 
competition 
makes us better. That is why they 
asked Congress to fund a second pro-
vider for the lunar lander. 
Developing additional designs was 
NASA’s original intent—a type of 
built-in 
insurance. 
It 
helps 
foster 
greater astronaut safety, which you 
can appreciate, and minimize the im-
pact of delays; in the end, protecting 
the American taxpayers’ investment in 
the Artemis program. 
To continue advancements in Amer-
ican ingenuity and innovation, Con-
gress must embrace competition, safe-
ty, and public-private partnerships. 
My colleague from Vermont’s motion 
would take a sledgehammer to Amer-
ican ingenuity and the Artemis pro-
gram. 
I urge my colleagues to vote against 
this motion. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent for an additional 30 
seconds. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Ms. CANTWELL. I, too, oppose this 
amendment. 
Striking 
the 
authorization 
does 
strike competition. NASA has asked 
for continued competition, and there 
are many defense contractors who have 
expressed interest—Lockheed Martin, 
Northrop Grumman, Dynetics. 
So I understand my colleague’s frus-
tration and what he wants to complain 
about, but this is about safety, and it is 
about redundancy, and it is about us 
authorizing the Artemis program; not 
just having appropriators make a deci-
sion, but having the authorization of 
safety and redundancy that we expect 
if we as a Nation are going to take the 
next woman astronaut all the way to 
the surface of the Moon. 
When I think about what happened 
with the space shuttle Columbia and 
the disaster, NASA suffered great con-
sequences. They have said redundancy 
matters, and that is what we are au-
thorizing, and the competition my col-
league just mentioned. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont, 30 seconds. 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, you 
know, I hear this word ‘‘competition,’’ 
but I want everybody to know what the 
competition is in the space program. 
The competition is between Mr. 
Musk and SpaceX. Musk is the wealthi-
est guy in the country, and Jeff Bezos 
and Blue Origin, the second wealthiest 
guy in this country. 
Is that really the kind of space pro-
gram that the American people want? I 
think not. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, 
I rise today to explain my position on 
Senator SANDERS’ motion to instruct 
conferees to remove language from any 
final conference report of the U.S. In-
novation and Competition Act and the 
America COMPETES Act that would 
provide $10 billion for NASA to develop 
a second Human Landing System. 
California has long been the epi-
center of the global aerospace and com-
mercial space industries, and I am 
proud of the many technical and sci-
entific advancements made by Cali-
fornia scientists and engineers. The 
bills that the conference committee 
will consider are intended to ensure 
that the innovation in aerospace in 
California and beyond has the support 
needed to maintain the United States’ 
global competitive edge and lead sci-
entific advancement. 
When the Senate passed the U.S. In-
novation and Competition Act last 
summer, I was concerned that section 
2614 of the bill would circumvent the 
competitive process at the heart of 
Federal procurement and undermined 
NASA’s 
existing 
contract 
for 
the 
Artemis Human Landing System. 
By that time, NASA had already 
completed a contract review and award 
for the Artemis program for the devel-
opment of a landing system, selecting 
the proposal by SpaceX. The SpaceX 
bid not only received the highest rat-
ing for its technical aspects and man-
agement approach, it also had the low-
est price. 
Nevertheless, the unsuccessful con-
tractors who did not receive the final 
contract, Blue Origin and Dynetics, 
filed a complaint with the Government 
Accountability Office, alleging viola-
tions 
and 
unreasonable 
evaluation 
practices. 
The GAO investigated for 3 months 
and ultimately denied the claims by 
the contractors, saying: ‘‘The evalua-
tion of all three proposals was reason-
able and consistent with applicable 
procurement law, regulation, and the 
announcement’s terms.’’ 
Like Senator SANDERS, I had initial 
concerns that section 2614 of the U.S. 
Innovation and Competition Act would 
create an additional Human Landing 
System contract, thereby providing 
substantial public funding to contrac-
tors who lost a fair competitive con-
tract award. Moreover, the terms of 
section 2614 threatened to force NASA 
into a rushed acquisition and could 
have diverted funds from other impor-
tant projects to cover the expenses of 
this second Artemis award. 
However, my staff and I have worked 
with Senator CANTWELL and her staff 
at the Senate Commerce Committee to 
address those concerns. I understand 
that the Commerce Committee will 
work through the conference process to 
extend the timeline for the new con-
tract in the bill—previously just 90 
days—to ensure that NASA can under-
take another fair procurement process. 
They have further committed to 
working with NASA to ensure that the 
language does not represent an un-
funded mandate, forcing NASA to pull 
funds from other programs. 
Lastly, NASA’s budget request this 
year for the landing system was $1.5 
billion, a significantly more reasonable 
amount than the enormous figure in-
cluded in the original Senate bill. As a 
member of the Appropriations Sub-
committee for Commerce, Justice, and 
Science, I will continue to observe this 
program closely to ensure that these 
Federal funds are spent responsibly and 
without favoritism. 
I want to reiterate that I have long 
supported NASA’s scientific endeavors, 
including the upcoming Artemis moon 
mission, and I look forward to seeing 
the improved language in the final 
version of the bill. I thank Senator 
CANTWELL and her staff for working 
with me to address my concerns, and I 
respectfully note that I will vote no on 
the motion by Senator SANDERS.

MOTION TO INSTRUCT 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-

Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I call 
up my motion to instruct conferees, 
which is at the desk. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the motion. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A Senator from Louisiana [Mr. CASSIDY] 
moves that the managers on the part of the 
Senate at the conference on the disagreeing 
votes of the two Houses on the Senate 
amendment to the bill H.R. 4521 be in-
structed to insist that the final conference 
report include provisions that require the 
President to directly address troubling de-
velopments in Mexico’s energy sector that 
intentionally cause harm to United States 
jobs and economic interests, business and in-
vestor interests, and climate goals through 
the use of consultations under the USMCA 
(as defined in section 3 of the United States- 
Mexico-Canada Agreement Implementation 
Act (19 U.S.C. 4502)). 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, there will now be 2 
minutes of debate, equally divided, 
prior to the vote on the Cassidy motion 
to instruct. 
Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, the im-
portance of trade agreements is that 
everyone follows the rules they agreed 
to. Mexico is not following the USMCA. 
They have forced the closures or par-
tial closures of dozens of fuel facilities 
and have canceled permits for the im-
port and export of fuels. They are fa-
voring 
their 
national 
industry, 
PEMEX, and disadvantaging American 
companies, including companies build-
ing renewable projects. These actions 
chill foreign direct investment with 
Mexico, hurt American businesses, and 
undermine climate goals; but Mexico 
continues to benefit from the rest of 
the USMCA. 
We wish to be a strong and depend-
able trade partner with Mexico, but the 
USMCA should be honored. The role of 
the USTR is to represent the interests 
of the United States and hold trade 
partners to their word. Mexico should 
respect property rights for U.S. busi-
nesses. This should be a priority for the 
USTR. 
I yield back all time.

Mr. WARNOCK. Mr. President, I call 
up my motion to instruct, which is at 
the desk. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the motion. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
A Senator from Georgia [Mr. WARNOCK] 
moves that the managers on the part of the 
Senate at the conference on the disagreeing 
votes of the two Houses on the Senate 
amendment to the bill H.R. 4521 be in-
structed to insist that the final conference 
report include provisions that fully fund pro-
grams to build institutional research capac-
ity at historically Black colleges or univer-
sities that are developing research institu-
tions. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, there will now be 2 
minutes of debate, equally divided, 
prior to a vote on the Warnock motion 
to instruct. 
Mr. WARNOCK. Mr. President, this 
legislation will help to lower costs for 
hard-working families, create jobs, and 
equip the Nation to compete in a 
changing economy. 
Historically Black colleges and uni-
versities have been putting in the 
work. For years, they have always had 
to punch above their weight, but they 
play a critical role in creating those 
jobs and in ensuring that we have a di-
verse, trained workforce for new tech-
nology, for research, and advanced 
manufacturing opportunities in Geor-
gia and, indeed, across the country. 
That is why we have to invest in 
their ability to meet tomorrow’s chal-
lenges. When we invest in all of our 
young people, we position our economy 
to be strong for 10 years, 20 years, 30 
years into the future. 
The purpose of this motion is very 
simple. It will ensure that our entire 
higher education sector can contribute 
to our growing tech and innovation 
economy. We make good use of all of 
our talent in creating businesses and 
good-paying jobs in Georgia and all 
across the Nation. I hope that we can 
adopt this motion by voice vote. 
VOTE ON MOTION 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
further debate on the motion? 
If not, the question is on agreeing to 
the motion. 
The motion was agreed to. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia. 
MOTION TO INSTRUCT 
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I call up 
my motion to instruct conferees, which 
is at the desk. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the motion. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
The Senator from West Virginia [Mrs. CAP-
ITO] moves that the managers on the part of 
the Senate at the conference on the dis-
agreeing votes of the two Houses on the Sen-
ate amendment to the bill H.R. 4521 be in-
structed to insist that the final conference 
report include provisions that— 
(1) emphasize that, under current law, the 
President may not— 
(A) declare, on the basis of climate 
change— 
(i) a national emergency under the Na-
tional Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et 
seq.); 
(ii) an emergency or major disaster under 
the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and 
Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 et 
seq.); or 
(iii) a public health emergency under sec-
tion 319 of the Public Health Service Act (42 
U.S.C. 247d); or 
(B) invoke, on the basis of climate change, 
the authorities of the Defense Production 
Act of 1950 (50 U.S.C. 4501 et seq.); and 
(2) provide that nothing in H.R. 4521 grants 
the President the authority to make a dec-
laration or invocation described in para-
graph (1). 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, there will now be 2 
minutes of debate, equally divided, 
prior to a vote on the Capito motion to 
instruct. 
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, this 
motion to instruct emphasizes that cli-
mate change cannot be used as a basis 
for the President to declare an emer-
gency or a major disaster or any other 
means to expand executive powers. 
In the last 2 weeks, Progressives in 
Congress have renewed their push for 
the President to claim powers he 
doesn’t have and make it harder to 
produce energy domestically and ex-
port it abroad. This is bad policy, and 
it sets a bad precedent to encourage ex-
pansive executive authority. 
Now, of course, I think we should ad-
dress climate change, but ceding broad 
authority over to the Executive is not 
the way to go. I have worked together 
with my colleagues on numerous pieces 
of meaningful climate legislation and 
continue to do so as the ranking mem-
ber of the Environment and Public 
Works Committee. 
When Congress wants to address cli-
mate, as we have in the past, it rolls up 
its sleeves and does so in a thoughtful, 
bipartisan manner, with clear, detailed 
direction to the Executive, not by giv-
ing the Executive broad authority to 
do whatever it sees fit.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2324 
May 4, 2022 
I encourage a positive vote on my 
motion to instruct. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, when 
vigorous storms attack the heartland 
and destroy crops, I hope that the 
President has emergency powers to as-
sist those farmers. When fires—fiercer 
fires in a longer fire season—proceed to 
burn not just one town but six towns to 
the ground in the State of Oregon in an 
almost unbelievable, horrendous reduc-
tion to ashes, I hope the President has 
emergency powers to declare a major 
disaster and assist the good people of 
my State or your State when these dis-
asters happen. If changing tempera-
tures and changing rain patterns bring 
the sandfly to Texas and leishmaniasis 
or some other deadly disease, then, in-
deed, the President needs to have the 
power to declare a public health serv-
ice emergency. 
Taking away the ability for the 
President to declare major disasters or 
health emergencies or national emer-
gencies when there are disasters strik-
ing our people is a terrible idea, and I 
encourage you to vote no on this mo-
tion to instruct.

MOTION TO INSTRUCT 
Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, I 
call up my motion to instruct, which is 
at the desk. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the motion. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
The 
Senator 
from 
Pennsylvania 
[Mr. 
TOOMEY] moves that the managers on the 
part of the Senate at the conference on the 
disagreeing votes of the two Houses on the 
Senate amendment to the bill H.R. 4521 be 
instructed to insist upon the provisions con-
tained in section 73001 of the Senate amend-
ment (relating to establishing a process for 
exclusion of articles from duties under sec-
tion 301 of the Trade Act of 1974). 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, there will now be 2 
minutes of debate, equally divided, 
prior to a vote on the Toomey motion 
to instruct. 
Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, my 
motion would simply instruct the Sen-
ate conferees to USICA to keep a provi-
sion of the Wyden-Crapo trade amend-
ment that passed the Senate 91 to 4. 
Specifically, it is the provision that re-
quires the administration reestablish 
an exclusion process for current and fu-
ture section 301 actions. 
This does not repeal 301 tariffs. It 
doesn’t preclude new 301 tariffs. But, 
remember, when the Trump adminis-
tration imposed 301 tariffs, they cre-
ated an exclusion process for the sim-
ple reason that it was important to ex-
clude from tariffs those circumstances 
in which it would do more harm to an 
American manufacturer and worker 
than those targeted by the tariffs. But 
the exclusion process has expired. It 
has not been fully restarted. So many 
U.S. manufacturers are not able to get 
the relief they need. 
The USICA language that passed the 
Senate would reestablish this exclusion 
process. The language grants consider-
able flexibility to the U.S. Trade Rep, 
even to the point where the exclusion 
process could be waived altogether if 
the Trade Rep concludes that, other-
wise, it would diminish American le-
verage. 
The bipartisan language simply helps 
ensure that American manufacturers 
remain competitive. Nearly every one 
of us submitted letters of request from 
constituent companies asking for ex-
clusions. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator’s time has expired. 
Mr. TOOMEY. There is no exclusion 
if there is no exclusion process. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I rise 
to oppose Senator TOOMEY’s motion to 
instruct against motions that under-
mine investments in American manu-
facturing and production. 
I urge my colleagues to oppose this 
motion to instruct. It supports a broad 
exclusion process for 301 tariffs for 
goods from China. These tariffs are in 
place because of Chinese unfair trade 
practices that target our industrial 
base and jobs in Pennsylvania and Ohio 
and New Jersey. 
The AFL–CIO opposes this motion. 
The USTR opposes it. The bipartisan, 
pro-industry Alliance for American 
Manufacturing opposes it. They know 
any exclusions need to be part of a 
broader strategic approach that we all 
support to trade policy with China. 
Creating an overly broad exclusion 
process that ties our hands would take 
away leverage we need to pressure 
China to change its behavior—behavior 
the steel industry in my State and 
other industries all over the country 
know too well. 
China cheats. We know this. It sub-
sidizes its steel industry. It props up 
state-owned enterprises. It steals intel-
lectual property. It pollutes the Earth 
and exploits our workers. It is costing 
my State and all over the country jobs 
year after year. We can’t let China’s 
cheating undermine the investments 
we are making in this bill. 
I ask for opposition to the Toomey 
motion.

The motion was agreed to. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The jun-
ior Senator from New Mexico. 
Mr. LUJA´ N. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous 
consent 
that 
notwith-
standing the previous order, it be in 
order to offer my motion to instruct at 
this time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
MOTION TO INSTRUCT 
Mr. LUJA´ N. Madam President, I have 
a motion at the desk to instruct con-
ferees. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the motion. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. LUJA´ N] 
moves that the managers on the part of the 
Senate at the conference on the disagreeing 
votes of the two Houses on the Senate 
amendment to the bill H.R. 4521 be in-
structed to insist on provisions supporting 
the work of the Department of Energy, user 
facilities of the Department of Energy, and 
National Laboratories, including work in 
microelectronics and across the key tech-
nology focus areas (as defined in section 2002 
of the amendment). 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, there will now be 2 
minutes of debate, equally divided, 
prior to a vote on the Luja´n motion to 
instruct. 
The junior Senator from New Mexico. 
Mr. LUJA´ N. Thanks to a bipartisan 
effort in the Commerce Committee, the 
Senate-passed 
U.S. 
Innovation 
and 
Competition Act includes nearly $17 
billion to support research, develop-
ment, and supply chain support at the 
Department of Energy National Lab-
oratories, including key technology 
areas, such as high-performance com-
puting, advanced energy technologies, 
artificial intelligence, quantum infor-
mation science, and advanced manufac-
turing. The House bill also includes ro-
bust support for our National Labs. 
This strong investment is critical to 
maintaining and strengthening U.S. 
competitiveness and security, espe-
cially as global R&D expenditures rise 
in these transformative industries. 
Our National Labs are a research 
crown jewel, and other countries are 
taking notice of our progress. In fact, 
China is working to build out their own 
national lab network modeled after our 
own DOE Labs. Inaction would leave 
the United States at risk of being rap-
idly outpaced. 
New Mexico’s own Sandia and Los Al-
amos National Laboratories are lead-
ing the way in developing cutting-edge 
technologies in key focus areas and 
driving innovation in critical national 
priorities, 
such 
as 
next-generation 
microelectronics. 
The Department of Energy’s experi-
ence working with universities, col-
laborating with the private sector, and 
protecting American intellectual prop-
erty from theft makes it a pillar of the 
U.S. innovation ecosystem. 
VOTE ON MOTION 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator’s time has expired. 
Hearing no further debate, the ques-
tion is on agreeing to the motion. 
The motion was agreed to. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
this is our last vote, and I want to 
thank Members on both sides of the 
aisle for their cooperation. If you 
would have told me at noon today we 
would finish this by 10:20, I would have 
said we never could do it. 
Thank you. Last vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from South Carolina. 
MOTION TO INSTRUCT 
Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. I call 
up my motion to instruct conferees, 
which is at the desk. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the motion. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. 
SCOTT] moves that the managers on the part 
of the Senate at the conference on the dis-
agreeing votes of the two Houses on the Sen-
ate amendment to the bill H.R. 4521 be in-
structed to insist that the final conference 
report include a requirement that any new 
legislation providing for new mandates on 
greenhouse gas emissions should not be en-
acted unless similar mandates are enacted in 
the People’s Republic of China. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, there will now be 2 
minutes of debate, equally divided, 
prior to a vote on the Scott motion to 
instruct. 
The Senator from South Carolina. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
South 
Carolina. 
Madam President, this should be sim-
ple. The last 20 years, China’s emis-
sions have gone from 13 percent glob-
ally to 28 percent. At the same time, 
our emissions have gone from 25 per-
cent down to 14 percent. 
I will start over. 
The last 20 years, China’s emissions 
have doubled—13 percent to 28 percent. 
At the exact same time, ours has gone 
from 25 percent to 14 percent. 
Why would we cripple our economy 
to make it easier for China to prosper? 
This should be a simple one. Gas in DC 
is $5 a gallon. We are destroying Amer-
ica’s economy, and we are crippling our 
Nation’s energy security. This should 
be simple. 
I yield back the rest of my time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
Mr. CARPER. I rise reluctantly in 
opposition to the motion to instruct of-
fered by our friend from South Caro-
lina. I genuinely enjoy his friendship. 
And working with him, I agree with 
him on many issues. This is one where 
we just disagree. 
I have serious concerns with the mo-
tion he is offering tonight to prevent 
U.S. greenhouse gas emission mandates 
from being enacted unless China enacts 
similar mandates. Greenhouse gases 
that drive climate change threaten our 
planet, threaten our lives. They threat-
en our livelihood. 
They also present an opportunity for 
the United States to lead on the global 
stage. We have an opportunity—a now- 
or-never opportunity—for our country 
to lead in deploying clean, American- 
made technologies, to lower green-
house emissions, create American jobs, 
and position our economy to compete 
with and beat competitors, including 
China, like a drum. 
Our ability to provide clean energy 
leadership or to collect climate change 
data should not be contingent on the 
action of our foes, as this motion to in-
struct recommends. The leadership is 
keeping out of step when everyone else 
is marching to the wrong tune, includ-
ing China. 
In conclusion, our country should be 
leading by example—not from behind— 
in tackling the climate crisis so that 
our businesses, our workers, and our 
planet reap the benefits of a clean 
economy. 
And that is why I will be voting re-
luctantly on this motion to instruct 
our colleagues, and I hope you will join 
with me. 
I ask for the yeas and nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from South Carolina. 
Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. I have 
great respect for Senator CARPER. I 
think he is a man of integrity. I will 
simply say that China can’t hear the 
music he is talking about. Our emis-
sions have been going down while 
theirs is going up. 
Clean energy in this footprint is pro-
duced cleaner in America than it is in 
China. So if you care about the envi-
ronment, produce it here at home. If 
you 
care 
about 
national 
security, 
produce it here at home. 
(Applause.) 
That is all I am suggesting. 
I will reclaim the last 10 seconds of 
my time.

EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
Mr. COONS. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to executive session to con-
sider the following nomination: Execu-
tive Calendar No. 589, James D. Rodri-
guez, to be Assistant Secretary of 
Labor for Veterans’ Employment and

nomination without intervening action 
or debate; that the motion to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon 
the table; that any statements related 
to the nomination be printed in the 
RECORD; that the President be imme-

MORNING BUSINESS 
REMEMBERING THOMAS OAKLEY 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, Tom 
Oakley was a man with a mission. His 
mission was to put Quincy and Western 
Illinois on the map. The only sure way 
to do that was to personally redraw the 
maps. So he did. 
In the late 1950s, there was not a 
four-lane highway anywhere within 100 
miles of Quincy, IL. Critics called the 
region: ‘‘Forgottonia.’’ Thomas Oakley 
had more than a good memory. He had 
a vision, and Western Illinois was not 
about to be forgotten. 
Any political candidate who paid a 
visit to Tom’s Herald-Whig editorial 
board knew what to expect. No com-
plimentary coffee or cool glass of water 
until Tom asked the question. With a 
dead serious look and his deep bass 
voice, he skipped the pleasantries. 
‘‘What’s your position on completing 
the four-lane Central Illinois Express-
way all the way to Quincy?’’ 
‘‘I am for it,’’ I quickly answered as 
a congressional candidate in 1982. 
Tom smiled and asked how I liked 
my coffee. It was the beginning of a 
beautiful friendship. 
For decades, Quincy and the Tri- 
States had no greater advocate than 
Tom. His indefatigable voice for the re-
gion rightfully earned him the honor of 
having a 60-mile stretch of the Chicago 
to Kansas Expressway highway named 
after him. From Quincy to Macomb, it 
is the Thomas A. Oakley Highway now. 
He also helped grow his family’s media 
company Quincy Media, Inc., into the 
13th largest media company in the 
country. Last month, Tom passed 
away, and today, we honor the memory 
and legacy of my friend. 
Tom was a member of the fourth gen-
eration of his family to work for Quin-
cy Media, which operates the Quincy 
Herald-Whig, the Hannibal Courier- 
Post, and WGEM television and radio. 
Quincy Media has properties in several 
other markets as well. He was born to 
Thomas C. and Mary Oakley on June 
24, 1932. As a young person, he began 
his career as a carrier boy for the Quin-
cy 
Herald-Whig. 
In 
summers, 
he 
worked for Quincy Broadcasting and 
the Quincy Herald-Whig. 
After graduating from Quincy High 
School in 1950, Tom earned a bachelor’s 
degree in economics from Duke Univer-
sity and joined the U.S. Air Force in 
1954. He served for 3 years, 2 of them 
flying a B–47 bomber with the Stra-
tegic Air Command. Tom was honor-
ably discharged with the rank of first 
lieutenant in 1957 and was a captain in 
the Inactive Reserves. In 1958, he re-
turned to Quincy and the family busi-
ness. 
Tom became the president and CEO 
of Quincy Media in 1969, following the 
death of his father. Under his leader-
ship, he led the company through dec-
ades of growth, adding television sta-
tions in several markets and one addi-
tional newspaper. Tom also cham-
pioned efforts to improve the Quincy 
infrastructure. He used his personal 
leadership and expanding media outlets 
to promote improving the quality of 
life in the region. 
For more than 60 years, Tom worked 
toward developing a highway for the 
Tri-States, which had been bypassed by 
the 
Eisenhower 
era 
infrastructure 
boom. He was on an untold amount of 
committees throughout his life. Tom 
helped found the Joint Industrial De-
velopment Commission, the first uni-
fied effort to build the economy of the 
Tri-State region. This was a prede-
cessor of the Great River Economic De-
velopment Foundation, which remains 
a driving force to improve Quincy and 
Adams County. 
Tom made things happen. Every Gov-
ernor since Otto Kerner, who was elect-
ed in 1960, heard about the Western Illi-
nois highway needs from Tom. He was 
instrumental in securing funds to com-
plete the Central Illinois Expressway 
from Springfield to the Mississippi 
River at Hannibal, the Chicago to Kan-
sas Expressway, and the Avenue of the 
Saints from St. Louis to Minneapolis. 
There is now a four-lane bridge over 
the Mississippi River at Hannibal, too. 
He threw his weight behind projects to

improve Amtrak, Baldwin Field, locks 
and dams, and a port district. Tom 
worked with elected officials at every 
level of government, regardless of 
party, so Illinois and the surrounding 
States’ residents could have a better 
life. 
For his work in media and improving 
the region, Tom received numerous 
awards. From the Quincy Chamber of 
Commerce Hall of Fame to being the 
first recipient of the annual Boy Scout 
community service award, he was a 
deeply honored person. In 2020, he was 
inducted into the Gold Circle by the 
Mid-America Chapter of the National 
Academy 
of 
Television 
Arts 
and 
Sciences, one of television’s highest 
honors. 
Tom also was generous financially. 
The Oakley family made the single 
largest philanthropic investment in the 
history of Quincy University, focusing 
on scholarships, academic facility im-
provements, and support programs. 
Earlier this year, Tom announced a $1 
million gift to Culver-Stockton College 
to establish the Tri-State Development 
Summit at the school. 
Tom inspired a legacy that will con-
tinue and channel regional coopera-
tion. He was fiercely loyal to both his 
family and his community, and I am 
fortunate to call him a friend. We will 
miss his leadership. His life was a life 
well-lived. Tom is survived by his son 
Ralph, his daughter Mary, his many 
grandchildren, 
and 
great-grand-
children. Tom, like his beloved West-
ern Illinois, will not be forgotten.

REMEMBERING GERRY FRANK 
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I 
speak today to honor the memory of an 
esteemed and beloved Oregonian who 
spent his life bettering our State. On 
March 13, Oregon lost its most devoted 
citizen and advocate: Gerry Frank. 
Gerry’s life and service to Oregon has 
inspired so many to learn, laugh about, 
and love what makes Oregon so special: 
our State’s jaw-dropping beauty, our 
unique independence, and our incred-
ible capacity to land on our feet. And 
Gerry has always done it in his own 
special way. No one I know has man-
aged to do as much good as Gerry 
Frank with a simple piece of chocolate 
cake. 
Gerry was a true renaissance man. A 
graduate of both Lincoln High in Port-
land and Cambridge in the U.K., he 
made his mark as a successful haber-
dasher, restauranteur, politician, and 
World War II veteran. But we all knew 
his true loves: Oregon and a great piece 
of cake. Gerry used the best chocolate 
cake in the world to bring us together 
at the State fair, a contest he selflessly 
judged annually for 60 years. He kept a 
terrific restaurant and retailer called 
Gerry Frank’s Konditorei which paired 
delicious Oregon food with that cake. 
And he went to bat for Oregon commu-
nity organizations of every size and 
shape, saying, ‘‘How much cake do you 
need to give a good cause a boost?’’ 
After the family business of Meier & 
Frank was sold in 1965, Gerry turned to 
politics, joining Senator Mark Hat-
field’s office. Gerry’s politics were al-
ways pretty simple. He would ask, ‘‘Is 
that idea fair? Does it make sense? And 
is it a part of Oregon’s long tradition of 
welcoming fresh approaches to tack-
ling big challenges?’’ For almost 20 
years Gerry worked as Mark Hatfield’s 
chief of staff, gaining the nickname 
‘‘Oregon’s Third Senator,’’ for his dog-
ged work ethic and devotion to Orego-
nians. Gerry is an incredible testament 
to what we call back home the Oregon 
Way: where we put aside partisan 
leanings to get things done for our 
State. 
After leaving politics, Gerry followed 
his passion for meeting new people and 
seeing new places. A talented writer, 
he was the travel columnist at the Ore-
gonian newspaper for many years and 
published multiple books, including 
one of my personal favorites: ‘‘Gerry 
Frank’s Oregon.’’ 
Gerry, a man of many talents and 
passions, never forgot about his home 
in Salem. Despite travelling to over 150 
countries, he always returned home in 
time for some of Oregon’s beloved tra-
ditions, including the State fair and 
the Rose Festival. In 2019 the Gerry 
Frank Salem Rotary Amphitheater 
was built in his name, just another tes-
tament to the impact Gerry had on his 
community as a lifelong Rotarian and 
lover of live music. And soon, Provi-
dence Health in Portland will complete 
the Gerry Frank Center for Children’s 
Care in his memory. 
The State of Oregon will not forget 
Gerry Frank, and neither will I. While 
his passing brings us sadness, it also 
bring us gratitude for his tireless work 
to make Oregon a better place to call 
home. I honor the illustrious life of 
Gerry Frank and unforgettable legacy 
he left in our State for generations to 
come.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
COUNTRY 
MUSIC HALL OF FAME 2021 IN-
DUCTEES 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, it is my honor to officially con-
gratulate the Country Music Hall of 
Fame 2021 inductees. This past week-
end I was fortunate enough to attend 
their Medallion Ceremony and help 
welcome The Judds, Ray Charles, Eddie 
Bayers, and Pete Drake into country 
music’s closest circle of friends. 
Naomi and Wynonna Judd, 2021’s 
Modern Era Artist inductees, were one 
of country music’s most cherished 
duos. The story of how they became 
The Judds reads like something out of 
a movie script: a mama and her daugh-
ter change their names, move to Nash-
ville, and land a record deal after a 
chance encounter with a hit producer. 
I, like thousands of their fans, was ab-
solutely heartbroken when Naomi’s life 
came to an end just 1 day before she 
was to receive her medallion, but her 
story lives on in the generations of fe-
male artists she inspired and through 
Wynonna’s ongoing, stunning contribu-
tions to country music. 
Few artists in living memory have 
taken more risks and earned more re-
spect than Ray Charles, 2021’s Veterans 
Era Artist inductee. Ray’s timeless

contributions to the past, present, and 
future of country music have inspired 
generations of rising stars to stake 
their own unique claims in the rich and 
diverse traditions of the genre. Ray’s 
career should serve as a gentle re-
minder to us all that while conformity 
may make for an easier journey, the 
creative heart rarely finds solace or joy 
in following in another’s footsteps. 
This year, the Country Music Hall of 
Fame honored not one but two musi-
cians who fundamentally transformed 
the sound and feel of modern music and 
set country musicmaking above the 
rest. Eddie Bayers, one of 2021’s Re-
cording and Touring Musician induct-
ees, is an undisputed master of his 
craft. He is a first call drummer, a re-
vered instructor, and one of the indus-
try’s most coveted human metronomes. 
For more than 50 years, he has laid the 
groove for the world’s most beloved 
artists, and I am so pleased to see him 
finally take his place in the spotlight. 
Pete Drake, Bayers’ fellow 2021 Record-
ing and Touring Musician inductee, 
used his unparalleled skill on the pedal 
steel guitar to turn already great musi-
cians into chart-topping legends. He 
forever changed the way artists in all 
genres thought about pedal steel, and 
his version of Alvino Rey’s ‘‘talking’’ 
steel guitar, dubbed the ‘‘talk box,’’ 
made its way into some of rock ‘n roll’s 
most iconic and instantly recognizable 
records. 
On behalf of the entire Tennessee del-
egation, I would like to express my 
gratitude to Naomi, Wynonna, Ray, 
Eddie, and Pete for their passion and 
artistry. The world is a far more vi-
brant and beautiful place for having ex-
perienced the gift of their music.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO DR. JOSE ROMERO 
∑ Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President, I 
rise today to recognize Dr. Jose Ro-
mero for his service as Secretary of the 
Arkansas Department of Health. He 
has led the ADH with a strong resolve 
and 
determination 
throughout 
the 
COVID–19 pandemic and his medical 
expertise has helped Arkansans navi-
gate and establish commonsense health 
solutions during this unprecedented 
time. 
Dr. Romero launched his career at 
the Arkansas Department of Health 
when he served as chief medical officer, 
and he was later appointed interim 
Secretary of Health in May of 2020 by 
Governor Asa Hutchinson. Dr. Romero 
proved he was more than up to the 
task; he excelled in this position and 
was quickly elevated to Secretary in 
August of the same year. The governor 
has said of his time working with Dr. 
Romero, ‘‘He’s supported me. He’s sup-
ported our state. He’s understood the 
political dynamics as well as the epide-
miology of dealing with this pandemic, 
and while it’s a great loss to Arkansas, 
he’s developed a very, very strong team 
at the Department of Health that I 
know will be able to continue with 
great vigor and continued leadership.’’ 
Dr. Romero has years of experience 
and an impressive educational back-
ground that prepared him to serve the 
people of Arkansas in the critical role 
he has filled over the last several 
years. He served as the chairman of the 
Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention’s Advisory Committee on Im-
munization Practices, which provided 
national guidance on the prioritization 
and distribution of the COVID–19 vac-
cine. He has also recently been ap-
pointed to the American Academy of 
Pediatrics’ Committee on Infectious 
Diseases and has consistently showed 
his ability to expertly inform and pro-
tect public health for the entire coun-
try. 
Dr. Romero has a passion for not 
only serving others but teaching as 
well. He is a professor of pediatrics at 
the University of Arkansas for Medical 
Sciences and has board certification in 
pediatrics and pediatric infectious dis-
eases. He was also the section chief of 
pediatric infectious diseases at the Ar-
kansas Children’s Hospital from 2008 
through 2020, where he was involved 
with numerous studies across his field 
that have contributed immensely to 
medical sciences. I am so grateful Ar-
kansans have had such a dedicated 
civil servant looking out for us for so 
long. 
Dr. Romero has continuously shown 
his incredible commitment to the bet-
terment of our Nation through his 
work improving the health of Ameri-
cans and educating the next generation 
of healthcare professionals. Through-
out his time as Secretary of Health, 
Dr. Romero has bravely navigated the 
COVID–19 pandemic and helped the 
Natural State stay safe and healthy 
while continuing to thrive. 
He has become a familiar face across 
Arkansas standing beside Governor 
Hutchinson during daily press con-
ferences regarding the virus, making 
him a trusted source for many Arkan-
sans with questions and concerns about 
the pandemic and medicine generally. 
As a member of the Governor’s cabinet, 
Dr. Romero worked diligently along-
side the Governor’s team to provide 
senior scientific and executive leader-
ship for the agency, and his commit-
ment to the health and well-being of 
Arkansans has been clear throughout 
his career. Dr. Romero has shown his 
dedication for providing quality infor-
mation to all Arkansans during his 
tenure, and we have benefited from his 
expertise. 
It is evident Dr. Romero’s passion for 
service and selfless dedication to public 
health has made an incredibly positive 
impact in every project he has been a 
part of and helped our State and all its 
citizens throughout the pandemic. Dr. 
Romero has devoted his life to pro-
tecting the public and educating oth-
ers. I appreciate the opportunity to 
work with Dr. Romero and thank him 
for his commitment to improving the 
health and wellness of Arkansans. As 
he transitions to the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention, Arkansas 
is full of gratitude for Dr. Romero and 
his dedication to our State.∑

TRIBUTE TO WALLACE ‘‘BUTCH’’ 
THUNDER HAWK 
∑ Mr. CRAMER. Madam President, I 
want to honor today the distinguished 
career of a remarkable North Dakota 
educator and artist who is retiring 
from teaching this month. 
Wallace ‘‘Butch’’ Thunder Hawk is an 
internationally renowned artist who 
has been a Tribal art teacher at United 
Tribes Technical College in Bismarck 
for 49 years. He has helped hundreds of 
students grow their artistic talent and 
appreciate traditional Native Amer-
ican art and traditions. 
Beyond his classroom in Bismarck, 
the impact of Butch’s passion for cre-
ating and teaching Native American 
art has been felt around the world. A 
Hunkpapa Lakota Teton Sioux, he was 
raised in the community of Cannonball 
on the Standing Rock Reservation. 
Butch was influenced by the work of 
his grandparents and mother, who cre-
ated traditional art including bead-
work, warbonnets, and tools. Ledger 
art has become one of Butch’s great in-
terests, and he has created hand-carved 
horse effigies, horse memorial sticks, 
war shields, and traditional weaponry. 
His artwork can be seen in homes and 
museums around the region and world. 
He was instrumental in establishing 
the Indian Hall exhibit at Thomas Jef-
ferson’s Monticello, helping to recreate 
art similar to what Lewis and Clark 
would have collected during their fa-
mous expedition in the early 1800s. 
Working with Harvard University’s 
Peabody Museum of Archaelogy and 
Ethnology, he and his students created 
several pieces for Monticello’s Indian 
Hall, including clubs, lances, arrows, 
shields, 
pipes, 
and 
a 
quiver 
and 
bowcase. Later, following several years 
as a visiting scholar at Harvard, he was 
a curator of an exhibit at the Peabody 
Museum on Lakota images of the West. 
One of his horse memorial effigy rep-
licas is in the permanent collection at 
the Nelson Atkins Museum in Kansas 
City, and two major art pieces are on 
display at the James Monroe House in 
Charlottesville, VA. One of his orna-
ments featuring a bison was displayed 
on the White House Christmas Tree in 
2008. 
He has said creating art and teaching 
honors his ancestors, his family, his 
students, and other artist friends. He 
considers it a privilege to share Lakota 
traditions with students and help them 
grow their appreciation of this art. 
When I heard the news that Butch 
Thunder 
Hawk 
was 
retiring 
from 
teaching, I smiled. In previous posi-
tions I held that included promoting 
all that is good about North Dakota, 
Butch was at the very top of the list of 
our State’s most treasured cultural 
ambassadors. A humble, personable,

and honorable man, he was generous in 
sharing his talents and work. Butch 
embodies all that is good about North 
Dakota and the rich traditions of the 
Tribal nations located in our State. His 
work and influence will resonate in his 
students for generations to come. On 
behalf of the people of North Dakota, I 
thank him for his years of teaching. 
And I wish him the best in his retire-
ment, which I am certain will include 
creating more art and influencing 
many more people.∑

200TH ANNIVERSARY OF CLAY 
TOWNSHIP, MICHIGAN 
∑ Mr. PETERS. Madam President, I 
rise today to recognize the 200th Anni-
versary of Clay Township, MI. Forming 
the southernmost portion of St. Clair 
County, Clay Township is endowed 
with natural beauty, fertile farmland, 
and a rich tradition of entrepreneur-
ship dating back to the fur trade be-
tween French explorers and the indige-
nous 
people, 
also 
known 
as 
the 
Anishinaabe. 
Long before Michigan was incor-
porated as a U.S. Territory and western 
expansion encouraged migration to the 
area we know now as St. Clair County, 
the 
region 
was 
home 
to 
the 
Anishinaabe peoples. Members of the 
Odawa, Pattawami, and Ojibwe Tribes 
and more made their homes alongside 
the Otisi-Keta, and Otisi-Keta-Sippi 
waters, now known respectively as 
Lake St. Clair, and the St. Clair River. 
The nutrient-dense farmland, abundant 
natural resources, and easy access to 
trade routes provided by the many wa-
terways endowed the Anishinaabe with 
a rich culture and community that 
would eventually attract the notice of 
French explorers arriving in the area. 
In fact, it was these early French ex-
plorers who would christen the Otisi- 
Keta as ‘‘Lac-Sainte-Claire’’ after dis-
covering the crystal-clear waters on 
the day of the Festival of Sainte 
Claire. In time, the lake, tributary, and 
surrounding land became known as St. 
Clair, the modern appellation we see 
today. 
Although 
French 
explorers 
began to depart from the territory fol-
lowing the Seven Years War, the legacy 
of trade and industry established with 
the Anishinaabe laid the foundation for 
the development of Clay Township as a 
hub of local commerce. 
Among the first settlers of Clay 
Township were Angus MacDonald and 
John Martin, who founded the city of 
Pointe 
du 
Chene—now 
known 
as 
Algonac—in 1805. MacDonald and Mar-
tin chose to settle the city at the head 
of the St. Clair flats, which had been 
the previous site of trade between the 
Anishinaabe and the French. Algonac 
quickly developed into the principal 
settlement in the area and is now rec-
ognized as one of the oldest cities in 
Michigan. Clay Township would be offi-
cially organized 17 years later in 1822. 
With this recognition, Clay Township 
became one of the four original town-
ships that comprised the entirety of St. 
Clair County. 
Today, Clay Township is comprised 
of 82.3 square miles of land and water. 
Bounded on three sides by water and 
divided 
into 
several 
islands 
by 
branches of the St. Clair River, it is 
known as a center for local water 
recreation and is home to over 9,000 
residents. The freshwater delta formed 
by the St. Clair River and waters of 
Harsens Island is the only major river 
delta in the Great Lakes Basin and the 
largest 
freshwater 
delta 
in 
North 
America. Michigan’s Department of 
Natural Resources manages two sites 
on Harsens Island, supporting pedes-
trians, cyclists, and other outdoor en-
thusiasts wanting to admire the wild-
life and waters of the region. The 
Algonac State Park is comprised of 
1,550 acres and provides sanctuary to 
rare habitats and 22 threatened, endan-
gered, or special-concern species of 
plants, birds, and butterflies. With its 
rich history and lush natural re-
sources, Clay Township is recognized as 
one of the best places to live in the 
State of Michigan. 
Clay Township has been an integral 
part of the State of Michigan and our 
great Nation for over 200 years. As a 
Michigander and passionate advocate 
for all of Michigan’s waters, I am hon-
ored to ask my colleagues to join me in 
celebrating this significant milestone 
for the township, as well as its resi-
dents, elected officials, and businesses. 
I wish Clay Township continued growth 
and prosperity in the years ahead.∑

mittee on Commerce, Science, and Transpor-
tation. 
f 
PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS 
The following petitions and memo-
rials were laid before the Senate and 
were referred or ordered to lie on the 
table as indicated: 
POM–133. A joint resolution adopted by the 
General Assembly of the Commonwealth of 
Virginia expressing its support for the Jones 
Act; 
to 
the 
Committee 
on 
Commerce, 
Science, and Transportation. 
SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION NO. 47 
Whereas, Virginia’s rich history of ship-
building and maritime trade makes the Com-
monwealth a critical hub in the nation’s 
transportation system and essential in the 
growth of offshore renewable energy develop-
ment; and 
Whereas, the COVID–19 pandemic has dem-
onstrated the critical importance of main-
taining resilient domestic industries and 
transportation services for Virginia’s citi-
zens and workforce; and 
Whereas, the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, 
known as the Jones Act and codified in Title 
46 of the United States Code, requires that 
vessels carrying cargo between locations in 
the United States be owned by American 
companies, crewed by American mariners, 
and built in American shipyards; and 
Whereas, America’s ability to project and 
deploy forces globally and to supply and 
maintain military installations domestically 
depends on the civilian fleet of Jones Act 
vessels and mariners; and 
Whereas, mariners aboard Jones Act ves-
sels strengthen America’s homeland security 
as additional eyes and ears to monitor the 
nation’s 95,000 miles of shoreline and 25,000 
miles of navigable inland waterways; and 
Whereas, Virginia is home to over 19,280 
maritime jobs supported by the Jones Act 
that generate $1.3 billion in labor income; 
and 
Whereas, maritime industry jobs create 
ladders of opportunity through high-paying, 
family-wage careers that offer significant ca-
reer advancement without generally necessi-
tating advanced formal education and exten-
sive student loans; and 
Whereas, the Jones Act fleet, more than 
40,000 vessels strong, supports nearly 650,000 
family-wage jobs and over $154 billion in eco-
nomic output nationally, including more 
than $4 billion in the Virginia economy; 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the Senate, the House of Dele-
gates concurring, That the General Assembly 
hereby express its support for the Jones Act. 
In affirming its resolute support for the 
Jones Act, the General Assembly also cele-
brates the centennial of the Jones Act as it 
continues to foster a strong domestic mari-
time industry that is critical to Virginia’s 
and the nation’s economic prosperity and na-
tional security; and, be it 
Resolved, further, That the Clerk of the 
Senate transmit copies of this resolution to 
the Speaker of the United States House of 
Representatives, the President of the United 
States Senate, and the members of the Vir-
ginia Congressional Delegation so that they 
may be apprised of the sense of the General 
Assembly of Virginia in this matter. 
POM–134. A resolution adopted by the 
House of Representatives of the State of Mis-
souri recommending to the President of the 
United States and the United States Con-
gress to reaffirm our country’s unwavering 
support for Ukraine’s freedom, sovereignty, 
and territorial integrity within its inter-
nationally recognized borders, extending to 
its territorial waters; to the Committee on 
Foreign Relations. 
HOUSE RESOLUTION NO. 3658 
Whereas, Ukraine is a sovereign and inde-
pendent nation located in Eastern Europe 
and an ally, under a bilateral investment 
treaty, of the United States; and 
Whereas, Russia, a transcontinental coun-
try spanning Eastern Europe and Northern 
Asia, has launched an all-out invasion of 
Ukraine by land, air, and sea; and 
Whereas, Russian forces have dramatically 
escalated their offenses by deploying a forty- 
mile long convoy of tanks and other military 
equipment advancing south to attack the 
people of Ukraine, including the City of 
Kyiv; and 
Whereas, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is 
the largest invasion of a sovereign nation in 
Europe since World War II; and 
Whereas, the combat is directly respon-
sible for massive civilian casualties, includ-
ing a Russian mortar attack on a children’s 
hospital that inflicted devastating loss of 
life; and 
Whereas, Russia’s attack on Ukraine was 
unprovoked and unjustified; and 
Whereas, as the attack intensifies, the hu-
manitarian crises could reach unprecedented 
levels, with the United Nations estimating

that between one million and five million 
people will be in need of urgent health care, 
safety, and security; and 
Whereas, Ukraine’s President, Volodymyr 
Zelenskyy, declared that Russia had ‘‘em-
barked on a path of evil, but [Ukraine] is de-
fending itself and won’t give up its freedom 
. . .’’: 
Resolved that we, the members of the 
House of Representatives of the One Hundred 
First General Assembly, Second Regular Ses-
sion hereby: 
(1) Proudly stand alongside Ukraine, its 
people, and its leaders during this horrific 
and unnecessary war and vow to support 
Ukraine and hold Russia fully accountable 
for its catastrophic decision to invade; 
(2) Condemn, in the strongest possible 
terms, Vladimir Putin’s violent attack on 
the people of Ukraine and strongly endorse 
the swift and severe economic sanctions and 
stringent export controls that President 
Biden’s administration has imposed on Rus-
sia; 
(3) Urge Russia to immediately cease its 
violent, illegal, and immoral assault upon 
Ukraine, end the needless bloodshed, and re-
turn to diplomacy and the rules-based inter-
national order that has ensured peace and 
prosperity for so many; and 
(4) Recommend to the President of the 
United States and the United States Con-
gress to reaffirm our country’s unwavering 
support for Ukraine’s freedom, sovereignty, 
and territorial integrity within its inter-
nationally recognized borders, extending to 
its territorial waters; and 
Resolved that the United States should 
take prudent and responsible measures to en-
sure that the required force posture is 
present in Europe to deter and, if necessary, 
defeat Russian aggression against any NATO 
member; and 
Resolved that the United States should im-
mediately strengthen additional sanctions 
on Russia by restricting the Russian banking 
and financial sectors, cybersecurity, and 
other key industrial sectors; and 
Resolved that the United States should im-
mediately bolster energy connectivity in 
Eastern Europe; and 
Resolved that the United States should ex-
pand the target list of Russian officials 
under the Magnitsky Act, which would im-
plement a greater range of targeted sanc-
tions aimed directly at Russian officials re-
sponsible for violating Ukrainian freedom 
and sovereignty, including the freezing of fi-
nancial assets and the imposition of visa 
bans; and 
Resolved that the Chief Clerk of the Mis-
souri House of Representatives be instructed 
to prepare a properly inscribed copy of this 
resolution for the President and Secretary of 
the United States Senate, the Speaker and 
Clerk of the United States House of Rep-
resentatives, and each member of the Mis-
souri Congressional delegation. 
POM–135. A resolution adopted by the Sen-
ate of the State of Ohio urging the United 
States government to secure its borders; to 
the Committee on Homeland Security and 
Governmental Affairs. 
SENATE RESOLUTION NO. 243 
Whereas, A strong, secure border benefits 
the United States: and 
Whereas, The well-being and safety of the 
citizens of the United States is being jeop-
ardized by threats from transnational crimi-
nal organizations; and 
Whereas, It is integral to the security, 
well-being, and harmony of the people of the 
United States to sustain secure borders; and 
Whereas, The dedicated individuals of the 
United States Customs and Border Protec-
tion work diligently and honorably to secure 
borders in the most efficient and humane 
manner; and 
Whereas, The Governor of Ohio has allo-
cated our state’s resources to secure our bor-
ders through the assignment of over one 
hundred members of the Ohio National 
Guard to support United States Customs and 
Border Protection and the assignment of 
troopers from the Ohio State Highway Pa-
trol to travel to Texas to support local law 
enforcement with border surveillance; and 
Whereas, Ill-motivated individuals con-
tinuously seek to cause harm, danger, in-
jury, hazard, and peril to those who protect 
the United States’ borders; and 
Whereas, Those individuals who cross the 
United States’ borders without regard for 
the legal immigration process circumvent 
the individuals who show respect for the rule 
of law; and 
Whereas, Those same individuals defy the 
right of the United States to control its own 
sovereign territory and regulate the hap-
penings within its rightful borders; and 
Whereas, The smuggling of contraband, 
such as drugs and weapons, have plagued the 
United States’ borders; and 
Whereas, In fiscal year 2021, United States 
Customs and Border Protection seized more 
than 319,000 pounds of marijuana, 109,000 
pounds of methamphetamine, 97,000 pounds 
of cocaine, 11,000 pounds of fentanyl, and 
5,400 pounds of heroin; and 
Whereas, These illegal drugs are sold, 
spread, and used throughout the American 
citizenry as drug overdoses and abuse rates 
reach the highest levels on record in the 
United States, including Ohio hitting a 
record death rate from opioid overdose dur-
ing the second quarter of 2020; and 
Whereas, In 2020, 81% of overdose deaths in 
Ohio involved illicit fentanyl or fentanyl 
analogs, 
while 
drug 
deaths 
related 
to 
fentanyl increased 32% from 2019; and 
Whereas, Most fentanyl and fentanyl-re-
lated substances abused in the United States 
are trafficked into the country via inter-
national 
mail, 
express 
consignment, 
or 
across the southwestern border; and 
Whereas, The act of human smuggling, 
which deliberately evades immigration laws, 
is a daily occurrence at the southwestern 
border according to U.S. Immigration and 
Customs Enforcement; and 
Whereas, Individuals who are smuggled 
into the United States may be involved in 
transnational criminal organization oper-
ations or may be forced into human traf-
ficking situations; and 
Whereas, Human trafficking is a serious 
issue in Ohio, as state sources identified over 
1,300 cases between 2014 and 2020, ranking the 
state among the ten worst in the nation for 
human trafficking; and 
Whereas, The United States Department of 
State has urged state and local governments, 
as well as nonprofit organizations, to address 
cross-border trafficking issues and support 
strong collaboration at the borders to iden-
tify and prevent human trafficking; Now 
therefore be it further 
Resolved, That we, the members of the Sen-
ate of the 134th General Assembly of the 
State of Ohio, support the investment of nec-
essary resources by the United States gov-
ernment to ensure secure, strong, and sus-
tainable borders; and be it further 
Resolved, That the Clerk of the Senate 
transmit duly authenticated copies of this 
resolution to the President Pro Tempore and 
Secretary of the United States Senate, the 
Speaker and Clerk of the United States 
House of Representatives, the President and 
Vice President of the United States, the 
members of the Ohio Congressional delega-
tion, and the news media of Ohio. 
POM–136. A concurrent resolution adopted 
by the Legislature of the State of West Vir-
ginia applying to the United States Con-
gress, under the provisions of Article V of 
the Constitution of the United States, for 
the calling of a convention of the states lim-
ited to proposing amendments to the Con-
stitution of the United States that impose 
fiscal restraints on the federal government, 
limit the power and jurisdiction of the fed-
eral government, and limit the terms of of-
fice for its officials and for members of Con-
gress; to the Committee on the Judiciary. 
HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 31 
Whereas, Executive orders by the Presi-
dent of the United States have become a ve-
hicle through which the President may 
overstep the limits of his or her constitu-
tional authority; and 
Whereas, The concentration of power at 
the federal level has had the effect of making 
federal officials less responsive to the will of 
the people and more readily influenced by 
lobbyists, wealthy corporations and special 
interests in Washington, D.C.; and 
Whereas, Much of federal law is now en-
acted by federal bureaucrats who were never 
chosen by the people and have no account-
ability to the people whatsoever; and 
Whereas, Policy decisions made at the 
state level tend to be more responsive to the 
needs and desires of the people; and 
Whereas, The federal government has cre-
ated a crushing national debt through im-
proper and imprudent spending; and 
Whereas, The federal government has in-
vaded the legitimate roles of the states 
through the manipulative process of federal 
mandates, many of which are unfunded to a 
great extent; and 
Whereas, The states have the ability to re-
store the responsiveness of government to 
the people and to restrain abuses of federal 
power by proposing amendments to the Con-
stitution of the United States through a lim-
ited convention of the states under Article 
V; therefore, be it 
Resolved by Legislature of West Virginia: 
That the Legislature hereby applies to 
Congress, under the provisions of Article V 
of the Constitution of the United States, for 
the calling of a convention of the states lim-
ited to proposing amendments to the Con-
stitution of the United States that impose 
fiscal restraints on the federal government, 
limit the power and jurisdiction of the fed-
eral government, and limit the terms of of-
fice for its officials and for members of Con-
gress; and, be it 
Further Resolved, That the Clerk of the 
House of Delegates forward a copy of this 
resolution, legislative call and application to 
the President and Secretary of the United 
States Senate and to the Speaker and Clerk 
of the United States House of Representa-
tives, and copies to the members of the said 
Senate and House of Delegates from this 
state; also to transmit copies hereof to the 
presiding officers of each of the legislative 
houses in the several states, requesting their 
cooperation; and, be it 
Further Resolved, That this application con-
stitutes a continuing application in accord-
ance with Article V of the Constitution of 
the United States until the legislatures of at 
least two thirds of the several states have 
made applications on the same subject; and, 
be it 
Further Resolved, The West Virginia Legis-
lature adopts this application expressly sub-
ject to the following reservations, under-
standings, and declarations: 
(1) An application to the Congress of the 
United States to call an amendment conven-
tion of the states pursuant to Article V of 
the United States Constitution confers no 
power to Congress other than the power to 
call such a convention. The power of Con-
gress to exercise this ministerial duty con-
sists solely of the authority to name a rea-
sonable time and place for the initial meet-
ing of a convention;

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2337 
May 4, 2022 
(2) Congress shall perform its ministerial 
duty of calling an amendment convention of 
the states only upon the receipt of applica-
tions for an amendment convention for the 
substantially same purpose as this applica-
tion from two thirds of the legislatures of 
the several states; 
(3) Congress does not have the power or au-
thority to determine any rules for the gov-
erning of an amendment convention of the 
states called pursuant to Article V of the 
United States Constitution. Congress does 
not have the power to set the number of del-
egates to be sent by any state to such a con-
vention, nor does it have the power to name 
delegates to such a convention. The power to 
name delegates remains exclusively within 
the authority of the legislatures of the sev-
eral states; 
(4) By definition, an amendment conven-
tion of the states means that states shall 
vote on the basis of one state, one vote; 
(5) A convention of the states convened 
pursuant to this application shall be limited 
to consideration of the topics specified here-
in and no other. This application is made 
with the express understanding that an 
amendment that in any way seeks to amend, 
modify, or repeal any provision of the Bill of 
Rights shall not be authorized for consider-
ation at any stage. This application shall be 
void ab initio if ever used at any stage to 
consider any change to any provision of the 
Bill of Rights; 
(6) Pursuant to Article V of the United 
States Constitution, Congress may deter-
mine whether proposed amendments shall be 
ratified by the legislatures of the several 
states or by special state ratification con-
ventions. The West Virginia legislature rec-
ommends that Congress select ratification 
by the legislatures of the several states; and 
(7) The West Virginia Legislature may pro-
vide further instructions to its delegates and 
may recall its delegates at any time for a 
breach of a duty or a violation of the in-
structions provided; and, be it 
Further Resolved, That the Clerk of the 
House forward a copy of this resolution to 
the representatives and senators elected by 
the citizens of West Virginia serving the citi-
zens of West Virginia in the Congress of the 
United States in Washington, D.C.

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mr. CORNYN (for himself, 
Mrs. 
GILLIBRAND, 
Mr. 
BLUMENTHAL, Mr. KING, Mrs. 
FEINSTEIN, 
Mr. 
KAINE, 
Mr. 
PETERS, Mr. TILLIS, Mr. SCOTT 
of Florida, Mrs. BLACKBURN, 
Ms. COLLINS, Mr. BOOZMAN, and 
Mrs. SHAHEEN): 
S. 4134. A bill to direct the President 
to submit to Congress a report on 
United States Government efforts to 
collect, analyze, and preserve evidence 
and information related to war crimes 
and other atrocities committed during 
the 
full-scale 
Russian 
invasion 
of 
Ukraine since February 24, 2022, and for 
other purposes; to the Committee on 
Foreign Relations. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to print my bill for 
introduction 
in 
the 
CONGRESSIONAL 
RECORD. The bill directs the President 
to submit to Congress a report on U.S. 
Government efforts to collect, analyze, 
and preserve evidence and information 
related to war crimes and other atroc-
ities committed during the Russian in-
vasion of Ukraine since February 24, 
2022. 
There being no objection, the text of 
the bill was ordered to be printed in 
the RECORD, as follows: 
S. 4134 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Ukraine In-
vasion War Crimes Deterrence and Account-
ability Act’’. 
SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
It is the sense of Congress that— 
(1) in its premeditated, unprovoked, un-
justified, and unlawful full-scale invasion of 
Ukraine that commenced on February 24, 
2022, the military of the Government of the 
Russian Federation under the direction of 
President Vladimir Putin has committed war 
crimes that include— 
(A) the deliberate targeting of civilians 
and injuring or killing of noncombatants; 
(B) the deliberate targeting and attacking 
of hospitals, schools, and other non-military 
buildings dedicated to religion, art, science, 
or charitable purposes, such as the bombing 
of a theater in Mariupol that served as a 
shelter for noncombatants and had the word 
‘‘children’’ written clearly in the Russian 
language outside; 
(C) the indiscriminate bombardment of 
undefended dwellings and buildings; 
(D) the wanton destruction of property not 
justified by military necessity; 
(E) unlawful civilian deportations; 
(F) the taking of hostages; and 
(G) rape, or sexual assault or abuse; 
(2) the use of chemical weapons by the 
Government of the Russian Federation in 
Ukraine would constitute a war crime, and 
engaging in any military preparations to use 
chemical weapons or to develop, produce, 
stockpile, or retain chemical weapons is pro-
hibited by the Chemical Weapons Conven-
tion, to which the Russian Federation is a 
signatory; 
(3) Vladimir Putin has a long record of 
committing acts of aggression, systematic 
abuses of human rights, and acts that con-
stitute war crimes or other atrocities both 
at home and abroad, and the brutality and 
scale of these actions, including in the Rus-
sian Federation republic of Chechnya, Geor-
gia, Syria, and Ukraine, demonstrate the ex-
tent to which his regime is willing to flout 
international norms and values in the pur-
suit of its objectives; 
(4) Vladimir Putin has previously sanc-
tioned the use of chemical weapons at home 
and abroad, including in the poisonings of 
Russian spy turned double agent Sergei 
Skripal and his daughter Yulia and leading 
Russian opposition figure Aleksey Navalny, 
and aided and abetted the use of chemical 
weapons by President Bashar al-Assad in 
Syria; and 
(5) in 2014, the Government of the Russian 
Federation initiated its unprovoked war of 
aggression against Ukraine which resulted in 
its illegal occupation of Crimea, the unrec-
ognized declaration of independence by the 
so-called ‘‘Donetsk People’s Republic’’ and 
‘‘Luhansk People’s Republic’’ by Russia- 
backed proxies, and numerous human rights 
violations and deaths of civilians in Ukraine. 
SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
It is the policy of the United States— 
(1) to collect, analyze, and preserve evi-
dence and information related to war crimes 
and other atrocities committed during the 
full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine that 
began on February 24, 2022, for use in appro-
priate domestic, foreign, and international 
courts and tribunals prosecuting those re-
sponsible for such crimes; 
(2) to help deter the commission of war 
crimes and other atrocities in Ukraine by 
publicizing to the maximum possible extent, 
including among Russian and other foreign 
military commanders and troops in Ukraine, 
efforts to identify and prosecute those re-
sponsible for the commission of war crimes 
during the full-scale Russian invasion of 
Ukraine that began on February 24, 2022; and 
(3) to continue efforts to identify, deter, 
and pursue accountability for war crimes 
and other atrocities committed around the 
world and by other perpetrators, and to le-
verage international cooperation and best 
practices in this regard with respect to the 
current situation in Ukraine. 
SEC. 4. REPORT ON UNITED STATES EFFORTS. 
Not later than 90 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, and consistent with
