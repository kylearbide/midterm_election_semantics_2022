prayer: 
Bless us, O Lord: our lawmakers, our 
country, and each one of us, as we lift 
our prayers to You. Bless us and keep 
us that our walk this day would be 
blameless in Your sight. 
Guard us and guide us wherever we 
are called to serve today: in our offices, 
in our communities, or in our homes, 
that we would be eager to respond to 
You with our whole being. Would that 
we seek to live upright lives and keep 
Your laws. And when our steps go way-
ward and our thoughts are overcome by 
selfish intent, do not forsake us, but 
call us back that we would once again 
desire to live according to the right-
eousness You set before us. 
May Your judgment upon us today 
find us without fault or flaw, and may 
our praise to You this day and always 
be steadfast and shameless. 
In the strength of Your name we 
pray. 
Amen.

HONORING 
DR. 
DARON 
‘‘CHIP’’ 
BUCKWELL, JR., FOR HIS SERV-
ICE 
AS 
SUPERINTENDENT 
OF 
KANNAPOLIS CITY SCHOOLS 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 1, 2021 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Dr. Daron ‘‘Chip’’ Buckwell, Jr., for 36 
years of service to Kannapolis City Schools, 
including 5 years as superintendent. I have 
seen Dr. Buckwell’s leadership firsthand and 
know how much he means to students, fac-
ulty, and staff. I am honored to call Chip my 
friend. 
Dr. Buckwell began his career in 1985 as a 
teacher, baseball coach, and athletic trainer at 
A.L. Brown High School, and retires today 
after over three decades of service. After 
being appointed superintendent in 2016, he 
immediately began the important work that 
would transform public education throughout 
our community. 
A giant among his peers in public education, 
Dr. Buckwell has led Kannapolis City Schools 
through a time of unprecedented growth. He is 
credited as a major catalyst for Kannapolis 
City Schools’ innovative magnet programs, ca-
reer and technical education opportunities, 
and increased student achievement. Exem-
plary of Dr. Buckwell’s commitment to aca-
demic excellence, he was named Super-
intendent of the Year for the southwest region 
of North Carolina in 2019. 
Dr. Buckwell’s impact extends far beyond 
the classroom and he has also been a fierce 
advocate for our students and community at 
the local, state, and federal levels. As a nod 
to the A.L. Brown mascot, one of Chip’s favor-
ite phrases is ‘‘Wonders never cease,’’ and as 
a result of his steadfast leadership, I believe 
that to be true. With experience at every level 
within Kannapolis City Schools, Dr. Buckwell 
is an extraordinary educator whose work will 
allow our children to thrive for generations to 
come. 
Renee and I would like to extend our most 
heartfelt appreciation to Dr. Buckwell for his 
years of exemplary service to Kannapolis City 
Schools. I know I speak for our entire commu-
nity in wishing he and his wife, Camilla, con-
tinued success and happiness as they move 
on to their next great adventure. 
Madam Speaker, please join me today in 
honoring Dr. Daron ‘‘Chip’’ Buckwell, Jr., upon 
his 
retirement 
as 
Superintendent 
of 
Kannapolis City Schools.

HONORING LT. COLONEL WILLIAM 
MOORE 
HON. VICKY HARTZLER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 1, 2021 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the service and life of one of 
Missouri’s World War II Veterans, Lt. Colonel 
William Moore. 
Before joining the United States Marine 
Corps, LTC Moore served as a teacher at 
White Cloud Elementary School in Wheatland, 
Missouri, after earning his education degree 
and teaching certification from Central Mis-
souri State Teachers College in Warrensburg 
and the University of Missouri—Columbia. 
While in the Marine Corps, he was assigned 
to Henderson Field in Guadalcanal and was 
as member of the Fighting Falcon Squadron. 
LTC Moore led his squadron in prayer under 
the wing of his assigned Grumman F4F Wild-
cat before each mission, earning him the re-
spected nickname the ‘‘Flying Deacon.’’ The 
Fighting Falcon Squadron was credited with 
the destruction of 95 enemy planes. Two of 
those planes were confirmed to have been de-
stroyed by CPT Moore, and likely yet 
unconfirmed the destruction of an additional 
two more enemy planes. He went through 75 
combat missions without receiving a single 
scratch. 
This small Hickory County community in 
Missouri’s Fourth Congressional District has 
lost an exceptional man at the age of 103. 
Due to his valor, LTC Moore was awarded the 
Distinguished Flying Cross, among other 
awards, for his extraordinary achievement 
while participating in aerial flight, in actions 
against enemy Japanese forces in the Pacific 
Theater of Operations during World War II. 
It is with great honor that LTC Moore’s dedi-
cated service to this country will be honored 
and respected on June 23, 2021, with full mili-
tary funeral honors and a flyover. Please join 
me in remembering this true American hero 
for his valor and service to our nation.

REMEMBERING 1921 TULSA- 
GREENWOOD RACE MASSACRE 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 1, 2021 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in sadness and heartbreak in remembrance of 
the Tulsa-Greenwood Race Massacre, that oc-
curred in the African American Greenwood 
community of Tulsa, Oklahoma on May 31– 
June 1, 1921 and is perhaps the preeminent 
example in this nation’s history of man’s inhu-
manity to man. 
I was honored to be in Tulsa this past week 
and take part in the Black Wall Street Legacy 
Fest,’’ held to remember the souls lost in 
Tulsa-Greenwood Race Massacre and to mark 
the centennial of those days of horror and evil. 
I was doubly honored to be asked, as the 
author and sponsor of H. Res. 398, to give the 
keynote address at the Black Wall Street Leg-
acy Fest Luncheon honoring the victims and 
remaining 
survivors 
of 
this 
American 
Kristallnacht. 
I include in the RECORD the text of my 
speech on that occasion. 
Madam Speaker, not a single member of 
the invading, riotous, and murderous white 
mob that destroyed Greenwood in 1921 was 
ever sent to prison for any of the murders or 
arson committed against the Black residents. 
Adding insult to this injustice, the 1921 
Tulsa grand jury indicted 85 people, the major-
ity of whom were African Americans, with 
massacre-related offenses. 
Why? Because in the eyes of the grand 
jury, a group of armed Black residents stand-
ing up for equal rights understandably pro-
voked the White crowd, and therefore, the en-
tire Black community in Greenwood essentially 
deserved what happened. 
But we know that no lie can live forever 
and, as the poet William Cullen Bryant proph-
esied, ‘‘truth crushed to earth will rise again.’’ 
That is why we came to Tulsa. 
We came to tell the world that we know 
what really happened, and that we will always 
remember, and never stop pursuing justice for 
the victims and survivors of the Tulsa-Green-
wood Race Massacre and their descendants. 
Whatever it takes and for how long it takes. 
Some might ask’’ ‘‘Why dwell on the past? 
Let us forget unpleasant things and move on 
into the future.’’ 
My answer is to quote the great southern 
writer William Faulkner: ‘‘The past is never 
dead. It is not even the past.’’ 
The hatreds, prejudices, resentments, and 
white supremacy that Black Americans wit-
nessed and suffered in Greenwood a century 
ago are not dead; they are not even past. 
We wanted to remind the nation that in 
1921, Tulsa’s Greenwood I District, known as 
‘‘Black Wall Street,’’ was one of the most doc-
umented prosperous African American com-
munities in the United States. 
The Greenwood community with a popu-
lation of over 100,000 Black people had stores 
that sold luxury items, 21 restaurants, 30 gro-
cery stores, a hospital, a savings and loan 
bank, a post office, three hotels, jewelry and 
clothing stores, two movie theaters, a library, 
pool halls, a bus and cab service, a nationally 
recognized school system, six private air-
planes, and two black newspapers. 
But on May 31st of that year, the 35 city 
blocks of Greenwood went up in flames, at 
least 300 Black persons were murdered and 
more than 800 were injured; it is estimated 
that not less than 9,000 were left homeless 
and destitute. 
The message of the Tulsa Race Massacre 
was clear to Black America: ‘‘Stay in your 
place. Do not attempt to accumulate and be-
queath wealth or own property. Remember 
your history in America is as chattel property.’’ 
Were they still alive, the domestic terrorists 
of the mob in I Greenwood would see their 
evil reenacted—and then followed by a similar 
attempt to cover-up it and foster collective am-
nesia—a century later in the siege and dese-
cration of the hallowed halls of the U.S. Cap-
itol, the ‘Citadel of Democracy’. 
It should not be overlooked that the source 
of the January 6 white mob’s irrational anger, 
hatred, and violent reaction was that Black

Americans voted in overwhelming numbers in 
Atlanta, Detroit, Milwaukee, Philadelphia, and 
other enclaves to oust the most pro-White su-
premacy President since the Civil War. 
So my message to the descendants of the 
survivors and victims of the Greenwood Race 
Massacre is to keep fighting for justice, to 
never be silent, to affirm the truth, and seek 
accountability. 
To accentuate this point, I shared the story 
of how we were able to pass H.R. 398, the 
House resolution recognizing the centennial of 
the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre when no one 
thought it possible because it appeared to vio-
late a long-standing rule of the House prohib-
iting consideration of legislation ‘‘commemo-
rating’’ dates, events, persons, and places. 
How did we get it done? By not taking no 
for an answer. By marshalling our allies and 
demonstrating our commitment and resolve. 
And by developing an alternative that was, 
if anything, more effective but not subject to a 
challenge 
that 
it 
violated 
the 
anticommemorative prohibition. 
And in the end, we won as opponents 
capitulated and acquiesced to the adoption of 
the resolution, which now stands for all time 
as a rebuke and condemnation of the utter 
moral depravity inflicted on the Black residents 
of Greenwood community of Tulsa, Oklahoma. 
This would not have happened without the 
steely determination of two special members 
of my personal staff: Lillie Coney, my Director 
of Policy, and Gregory Berry, my Chief Coun-
sel. 
They were guided by the advice of the great 
Harriet Tubman, a black woman who risked 
her life to shepherd slaves along the Under-
ground Railroad: 
If you hear the dogs, keep going. 
If you see the torches in the woods, keep 
going. 
If they’re shouting after you, keep going. 
Don’t ever stop. Keep going. 
If you want a taste of freedom, keep going. 
I thank all of the Members, 99 in total, who 
joined me as sponsors of H. Res. 398 and the 
House leadership for their cooperation and as-
sistance in ensuring that the condemnation of 
the 1921 Tulsa Greenwood Race Massacre is 
forever recorded in the annals of this body, 
and for their help in the work that lies ahead 
to bring justice to the survivors and to over-
come and dismantle all remaining badges and 
vestiges of slavery, America’s Original Sin. 
Madam Speaker, I also ask the House to 
observe a moment of silence in memory of the 
victims and survivors of the Tulsa Race Mas-
sacre, and their descendants who carry the 
terrible memories of that horrific day and still 
grieve over the loss of so many loved ones 
and of faith in the American system of justice. 
HONORING DESCENDANTS AND SURVIVORS OF 
1921 TULSA RACE MASSACRE 
Thank you for that generous introduction 
and to your team for putting together this 
important and impressive event. 
As was just said, I am Congresswoman 
SHEILA JACKSON LEE representing the 18th 
Congressional District of Texas, hailing from 
the great city of Houston. 
I am also a senior member of the Congres-
sional Black Caucus and the House Judiciary 
Committee and its Subcommittee on the 
Constitution, Civil Rights and Liberties, and 
the Chair of the Judiciary Subcommittee on 
Crime, Homeland Security, and Terrorism. 
So from these perches, I can tell you that 
there was no way, no how, that I was going 
to let centennial of the one of the greatest 
injustices in human history, the 1921 Tulsa 
Race Massacre, be ignored or go unrecog-
nized. 
And neither was the Congressional Black 
Caucus. 
And we were not going to let the Congress 
turn a deaf ear to the cries of justice—and 
just compensation—to the victims and sur-
vivors of perhaps the worst example in 
American history of man’s inhumanity to 
man. 
Not a single member of the invading, riot-
ous, and murderous white I mob was ever 
sent to prison for any of the murders or 
arson committed against the Black residents 
of Greenwood on May 31 and June 1, 1921. 
Adding insult to this injustice, the 1921 
Tulsa grand jury indicted 85 people, the ma-
jority of whom were African Americans, with 
massacre-related offenses. 
Why? Because in the eyes of the grand 
jury, a group of armed Black residents stand-
ing up for equal rights understandably pro-
voked the White crowd, and therefore, the 
entire Black community in Greenwood es-
sentially deserved what happened. 
But we know that no lie can live forever 
and, as the poet William Cullen Bryant 
prophesied, ‘‘truth crushed to earth will rise 
again.’’ 
That is why we are here. 
We are here to tell the world that we know 
what really happened, and that we will al-
ways remember, and never stop pursuing jus-
tice for the victims and survivors of the 
Tulsa-Greenwood Race Massacre and their 
descendants. 
Whatever it takes and for how long it 
takes. 
Some might ask ‘‘Why dwell on the past? 
Let us forget unpleasant things and move on 
into the future.’’ 
My answer is to quote the great southern 
writer William Faulkner: ‘‘The past is never 
dead. It is not even the past.’’ 
The hatreds, prejudices, resentments, and 
white supremacy that Black Americans wit-
nessed and suffered in Greenwood a century 
ago are not dead; they are not even past. 
A century ago, White rioters, local law en-
forcement, 
and 
self-appointed 
vigilantes 
claimed to be acting reasonably and in self- 
defense against what they feared was an up-
coming Black uprising. 
They resented the economic prosperity and 
self-sufficiency of the Greenwood commu-
nity, which was known nationally as ‘‘Black 
Wall Street.’’ 
They viewed Black males as fearsome 
physical threats to their personal safety and 
as rivals to white women. 
These baseless, irrational concerns are not 
a relic of the past, they are with us today 
and are what resulted in the deaths of 
George Floyd, Terence Crutcher, Tamir Rice, 
Deonte Wright, Stephon Clark, Amidou 
Diallo, and hundreds of others too numerous 
to list. 
Were they still alive, the domestic terror-
ists of the mob in Greenwood would see their 
evil reenacted a century later in the siege 
and desecration of the hallowed halls of the 
U.S. Capitol, the ‘Citadel of Democracy’. 
It should not be overlooked that the source 
of the January 6 white mob’s irrational 
anger, hatred, and violent reaction was that 
Black Americans voted in overwhelming 
numbers in the Atlanta, Philadelphia, Mil-
waukee, and Detroit to oust the most nega-
tive, divisive, racially hostile, and incom-
petent President in history, the 45th Presi-
dent, who presided over the deaths of more 
than 500,000 Americans, disproportionately 
Black and Brown. 
So we will not be silent, we will not be 
still, we will not ever forget what happened 
to the peaceful, law-abiding, and America- 
loving Black residents of Greenwood a cen-
tury ago. 
That is why earlier this year I introduced 
a resolution—some of you may have heard of 
it (H. Res. 215 later modified as H. Res. 398)— 
joined by 86 cosponsors, recognizing the cen-
tennial of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre. 
We wanted to remind the nation that in 
1921, Tulsa’s Greenwood District, known as 
‘‘Black Wall Street,’’ was one of the most 
documented prosperous African American 
communities in the United States. 
The Greenwood community with a popu-
lation of over 100,000 Black people had stores 
that sold luxury items, 21 restaurants, 30 
grocery stores, a hospital, a savings and loan 
bank, a post office, three hotels, jewelry and 
clothing stores, two movie theaters, a li-
brary, pool halls, a bus and cab service, a na-
tionally recognized school system, six pri-
vate airplanes, and two black newspapers. 
But on May 31st of that year, the 35 city 
blocks of Greenwood went up in flames, at 
least 300 Black persons were murdered and 
more than 800 were injured; it is estimated 
that not less than 9,000 were left homeless 
and destitute. 
The legacy of white mob violence inflicted 
upon the Black community of Greenwood 
has scarred the descendants of the victims of 
this American pogrom. 
H.R. 398 is a reminder to the nation of the 
ultimate cruelty inflicted upon a people for 
dare believing that the promise of America 
was attainable by them and their achieve-
ments would be respected and protected by 
law. 
But it does more than that, it puts the 
House of Representatives on record that the 
only way the United States can achieve a 
more perfect union is: 
1. by condemning the violence and destruc-
tion perpetrated against the African-Amer-
ican community of Greenwood, in Tulsa, 
Oklahoma, the scene of the then-largest sin-
gle instance of domestic terror against 
American citizens; 
2. through the rejection and active opposi-
tion to the false ideology of White suprem-
acy and condemnation of all groups and or-
ganizations that ascribe to this false system 
of belief and seek to perpetuate their views 
through violence and unlawful conduct; 
3. by promoting tolerance and unity and 
taking actions to ensure that governmental 
policies and actions do not foster division, 
disharmony, or intolerance; 
4. by calling upon all Americans to cele-
brate the ethnic, racial, and religious diver-
sity that has made the United States the 
leader of the community of nations and the 
beacon of hope and inspiration to oppressed 
persons everywhere; 
5. encouraging all persons in the United 
States to reflect upon the history of the 
United States as an imperfect but committed 
journey to establish a more perfect union 
and to cherish and exercise the rights, privi-
leges, and responsibilities guaranteed by the 
Constitution; and 
6. recognizing the commitment of Congress 
to acknowledge and learn from the history of 
racism and racial violence in the United 
States, including the Tulsa Race Massacre, 
to reverse the legacy of White supremacy 
and fight for racial justice. 
But we must also ensure that the survivors 
and their descendants finally receive the di-
rect financial compensation to redress the 
horrific injuries and losses sustained in the 
Tulsa Race Massacre. 
Earlier this month, the House Judiciary 
Committee held a hearing on the Tulsa Race 
Massacre and heard powerful and heart-rend-
ing testimony from the remaining three sur-
vivors of the Tulsa-Greenwood Race Mas-
sacre of the atrocities they lived through 
and the malignant neglect of governmental 
officials who failed in their duty to provide 
equal protection under law. 
For any persons questioning why we will 
not move on or why we continue the quest

for justice or who suggest that talking about 
the Tulsa Race Massacre is racially divisive, 
they need to put themselves in the shoes of 
7-year old ‘Mother Fletcher’ or 6-year old 
‘Mother Randle’ or an infant ‘Uncle Red,’ the 
three remaining survivors of an ’American 
Kristallnacht,’ that occurred on United 
States soil 17 years before it was repeated in 
Nazi Germany in 1938. 
Listen to Viola (‘‘Mother’’) Fletcher: 
‘‘On May 31st, 1921, I went to bed in my 
family’s home in the Greenwood neighbor-
hood of Tulsa. The neighborhood I feel asleep 
in that night was rich—not just in terms of 
wealth, but in culture, community, and her-
itage. My family had a beautiful home. We 
had great neighbors and I had friends to play 
with. I felt safe. I had everything a child 
could need. I had a bright future ahead of 
me. Greenwood could have given me the 
chance to truly make it in this country. 
‘‘Within a few hours, all of that was gone. 
The night of the Massacre I was woken up by 
my family. My parents and five siblings were 
there. I was told we had to leave. And that 
was it. 
‘‘I will never forget the violence of the 
white mob when we left our house. I still see 
Black men being shot, and Black bodies 
lying in the street. I still smell smoke and 
see fire. I still see Black businesses being 
burned. I still hear airplanes flying overhead. 
I hear the screams. I live through the Mas-
sacre every day. 
‘‘When my family was forced to leave 
Tulsa, I lost my chance at an education. I 
never finished school past the fourth grade. I 
have never made much money.’’ 
And listen to Lessie Evelyn Benningfield 
(‘‘Mother’’) Randle: 
‘‘100 years ago, in 1921, I was a 6-year-old 
child. I was blessed to live with my grand-
mother in a beautiful Black community in 
Tulsa Oklahoma, called Greenwood. I was 
lucky. I had a home. I had toys. I didn’t have 
any fears as a young child, and I felt very 
safe. My community was beautiful and was 
filled with happy and successful Black peo-
ple. Then everything changed. 
‘‘It was like a war. White men with guns 
came and destroyed my community. We 
couldn’t understand why. What did we do to 
them? We didn’t understand. We were just 
living. But they came, and they destroyed 
everything. 
‘‘They burned houses and businesses. They 
just took what they wanted out of the build-
ings then they burned them. They murdered 
people. 
‘‘We were told they just dumped the dead 
bodies into the river. I remember running 
outside of our house. I ran past dead bodies. 
It wasn’t a pretty sight. I still see it today in 
my mind—100 years later. 
‘‘I was so scared—I didn’t think we would 
make it out alive. I remember people were 
running everywhere. We waited for the sol-
diers to come, and when they finally came, 
they took us to the fairgrounds where we 
would be safe. It felt like so long before they 
came. 
‘‘I survived the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre. 
And I have survived 100 years of painful 
memories and losses.’’ 
Or listen to World War II veteran Hughes 
(‘‘Uncle Red’’) Van Ellis: 
‘‘I am 100 years old. And I am a survivor of 
the Tulsa Race Massacre. Because of the 
Massacre, my family was driven from our 
home. We were left with nothing. We were 
made refugees in our own country. 
‘‘My childhood was hard, and we didn’t 
have much. We worried what little we had 
would be stolen from us. Just like it was sto-
len in Tulsa. You may have been taught that 
when something is stolen from you, you can 
go to the courts to be made whole. You can 
go to the courts to get justice. This wasn’t 
the case for us. The courts in Oklahoma 
wouldn’t hear us. The federal courts said we 
were too late. 
‘‘We were made to feel that our struggles 
were unworthy of justice. That we were less 
valued than whites, that we weren’t fully 
American. We were shown that in the United 
States, not all men were equal under law. We 
were shown that when Black voices called 
out for justice, no one cared.’’ 
Rarely have we seen a fellow citizen who 
exemplifies the spirit of America—indomi-
table will, moral courage, faith, determina-
tion, and optimism—as we saw ‘Mother 
Randle’, ‘Mother Fletcher’, and ‘Uncle Red’. 
In addition to surviving the Tulsa-Green-
wood Race Massacre, Mother Fletcher and 
Mother Randle also lived through the 1918 
and 2020 global pandemics, the era of racial 
terror against Black Americans, and Jim 
Crow; and Uncle Red survived combat in the 
Far East during World War II in the 234th 
AAA Gun Battalion, an all-black battalion 
in the segregated U.S. Army. 
So we should heed the wisdom of these re-
markable Americans who have retained their 
love for America but have yet to receive just 
compensation for the horrendous crimes 
committed against them and their commu-
nity and honor their urgent plea to enact 
H.R. 40, legislation I introduced establishing 
a national commission to examine: (1) slav-
ery and discrimination in the colonies and 
the United States from 1619 to the present. 
As important, H.R. 40 also mandates that 
the 
Commission 
recommend 
appropriate 
remedies to address and ameliorate the lin-
gering negative effects of slavery on living 
African-Americans and society. 
In closing, let me share with you the story 
of how we were able to pass the House reso-
lution recognizing the forthcoming centen-
nial of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre when no 
one thought it possible because it appeared 
to violate a long-standing rule of the House 
prohibiting 
consideration 
of 
legislation 
‘‘commemorating’’ dates, events, persons, 
and places. 
How did we get it done? By not taking no 
for an answer. By marshalling our allies and 
demonstrating our commitment and resolve. 
And by developing an alternative that was, if 
anything, more effective but not subject to a 
challenge that it violated the anti-com-
memorative prohibition. 
And in the end, our opponents capitulated 
and gave in and acquiesced to the adoption 
of the resolution, which now stands for all 
time as a rebuke and condemnation of the 
utter moral depravity inflicted on the Black 
residents of Greenwood community of Tulsa, 
Oklahoma. 
So I close by leaving you with the advice 
we followed and that you should always re-
member. 
It comes from the great Harriet Tubman, a 
black woman who risked her life to shepherd 
slaves along the Underground Railroad: 
If you hear the dogs, keep going. 
If you see the torches in the woods, keep 
going. 
If they’re shouting after you, keep going. 
Don’t ever stop. Keep going. 
If you want a taste of freedom, keep going. 
Thank you very much for inviting me to 
join you for this important remembrance of 
the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre and your fel-
lowship to get justice for the victims and 
survivors and their descendants. 
It is an honor to be with you today. 
TRIBUTE TO HONOR THE LIFE OF 
JARIN FLYNN FELDSTEIN 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 1, 2021 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life and work of Jarin Feldstein, 
who was born on June 4, 1943, and died at 
the age of 78, on May 4, 2021, from pan-
creatic cancer. He was the son of Harold Feld-
stein and Edna Cooles Feldstein, and a grad-
uate of John Marshall High School in Los An-
geles. 
He earned a bachelor’s degree in mechan-
ical engineering from U.C. Berkeley, and a 
master’s degree in business administration 
from the University of Southern California. 
Jarin Feldstein had a prolific and highly suc-
cessful career in engineering with the widely 
known companies General Dynamics, TRW 
Systems and Hughes Aircraft. He retired from 
his position as founder, managing director and 
a member of the board of directors from COM-
SAT (U.K.) Ltd., COMSAT’s subsidiary in Lon-
don, in 1984. 
Jarin’s life, particularly after retirement, was 
devoted to the Boy Scouts of America, which 
honored him with the Silver Beaver Award for 
his exceptional character and distinguished 
service. Jarin was often honored for his lead-
ership in food drives to help feed the hungry, 
was a devoted member of Congregation Beth 
Am, and a serious jazz aficionado. 
Madam Speaker, Jarin Feldstein was a 
good man and a person of great integrity. I 
highly valued his friendship, as did everyone 
privileged to be his friend. He was a true gen-
tleman; a patriot; a distinguished business ex-
ecutive; a generous donor of his time and 
many talents to others; and, above all, a man 
devoted to his family. I ask my colleagues to 
extend their most sincere condolences to 
Jarin’s beloved wife, Carole; his children Patti 
Reed and Daniel Feldstein, and their spouses; 
and to his grandchildren Megan and Hannah 
Reed and Ethan and Zachary Feldstein. His 
memory will always be a blessing.

HON. RON KIND 
OF WISCONSIN

Mr. KIND. Madam Speaker, in recognition of 
the end of World Trade Month in May, I rise 
today to thank the professionals of the Inter-
national Trade Administration (ITA) for their 
work to strengthen the international competi-
tiveness of U.S. industry, promote trade and 
investment, and ensure fair trade and compli-
ance with trade laws and agreements. 
ITA has a tangible and direct impact on the 
lives of American workers and the success of 
American businesses. It also provides great 
return on investment in terms of U.S. taxpayer 
dollars spent. Each dollar that Congress ap-
propriated to ITA in FY20 returned $313 to the 
U.S. economy. ITA’s global workforce is de-
ployed across 106 domestic offices and nearly

80 foreign markets worldwide. Teams com-
prised of trade specialists, business and in-
dustry specialists, and economists provide 
unique sectoral and analytical expertise that 
supports U.S. Government efforts to protect 
the interests of U.S. businesses of all sizes 
and help them grow their exports. Their spe-
cialized knowledge across a broad range of 
sectors, policy programs, and economic activ-
ity is specifically tailored to inform decisions 
across the government, from trade negotia-
tions, to trade enforcement, to supply chain re-
silience, to inward investment and national se-
curity. 
ITA works on behalf of U.S. companies to 
promote a fair and rules-based international 
trading system that enhances American com-
petitiveness. Core to this mission is strong en-
forcement of U.S. trade laws and taking action 
when our trading partners engage in unfair 
trade practices or do not play by the rules. ITA 
leverages its expertise in antidumping and 
countervailing duties to level the playing field 
for domestic manufacturing, and similarly its 
expertise in trade agreements compliance and 
Foreign Trade Zones to support job creation 
and encourage investment in the United 
States. 
ITA’s work also helps to safeguard and cre-
ate jobs in the United States. It is a well- 
known fact that businesses that export, on av-
erage, pay higher wages and create more jobs 
than their non-exporting counterparts. As of 
late April 2021, since October 2020, ITA had 
assisted over 1,500 rural businesses, more 
than 1,500 woman-owned businesses, and 
over 1,300 minority-owned businesses. Thus 
far in FY21, the organization has assisted 
more than 20,000 U.S. companies with their 
export needs despite the setbacks created by 
the 
Covid–19 
pandemic. 
Furthermore, 
SelectUSA, the foreign direct investment arm 
of the organization, has facilitated more than 
$84 billion in client-verified investment and 
supported more than 106,000 jobs since its in-
ception in 2011. 
In closing, as we continue to celebrate the 
benefits of global trade, I appreciate this op-
portunity to recognize the hard and often un-
sung work and accomplishments of the profes-
sionals at ITA.

IN HONOR OF SUSAN HUARD 
HON. CHRIS PAPPAS 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 1, 2021 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I rise to rec-
ognize Susan Huard, who is being honored 
today for her retirement from the Community 
College System of New Hampshire. She has 
served as the interim chancellor of the Com-
munity College System of New Hampshire 
since 2020. Throughout her time as chancellor 
for CCSNH, Susan guided her team through a 
global pandemic, helping students and staff to 
adapt to new challenges posed by the public 
health crisis. 
Prior to serving as chancellor, Susan served 
as president of Manchester Community Col-

HONORING THE LIFE OF TOM 
GUARINO 
HON. MARK DeSAULNIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 1, 2021 
Mr. DeSAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today with Congresswoman BARBARA LEE and 
Congressman ERIC SWALWELL to recognize 
the life of Tom Guarino. 
A lifelong Californian, Tom was born in Hol-
lywood in 1953, and grew up in Covina. Tom 
graduated from California State Polytechnic 
University, Pomona in 1977, and later earned 
a certificate in Organizational Management 
from the University of California Los Angeles. 
In 1978, Tom moved to northern California, 
where he began a career in journalism. He 
worked as a radio news director, cor-
respondent for the Sacramento Bee, and free-
lance writer for the Associated Press, United 
Press International, Mutual Radio, and NBC 
Radio. Tom later joined Assemblymember 
Chris Chandler’s office in Yuba City, where he 
continued building community relations. Tom’s 
experience was further broadened by his work 
as the CEO of the Chico and San Leandro 
Chambers of Commerce. In San Leandro, 
Tom worked with the City Council on a project 
called ‘‘Business Walk,’’ where the chamber 
and the council visited every business in the 
city to assess their needs. Tom’s ability to 
make connections between the public and pri-
vate sectors not only increased chamber 
membership in San Leandro, but also helped 
develop successful partnerships and new op-
portunities. 
Tom combined his many years of experi-
ence and began working for Pacific Gas & 
Electric Company (PG&E). We were fortunate 
to have Tom as PG&E’s Senior Government 
Relations Representative with the East Bay 
Public Affairs Team. His breadth of experience 
and vast knowledge allowed Tom to navigate 
relationships with elected officials, community 
leaders, and organizations. He was known for 
always answering the call for help and suc-
cessfully engaging individuals with their public 
utility provider. 
Tom’s involvement in the community, how-
ever, went beyond his work with PG&E. His 
personal philanthropy extended to, among 
other things, the arts, parks, youth; especially 
those in foster care; and aging adults. He sup-
ported numerous local organizations in any 
way he could, including volunteering his time. 
It was through Tom’s natural ability to build 
authentic connections that he became a friend 
to so many. 
Sadly, Tom passed away in December 
2020, at the age of 67. He was a cherished 
member of Contra Costa and Alameda Coun-
ties, and he will be remembered for his gen-
erosity, integrity, and humor. Please join me, 
Congresswoman BARBARA LEE, and Congress-
man ERIC SWALWELL in honoring Tom for his 
many contributions to our community.

SUPPORT 
OF 
LGBTQ 
PRIDE 
MONTH 
AND 
HOUSTON 
PRIDE 
WEEK 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 1, 2021 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to commemorate LGBTQ Pride Month and the 
remarkable progress that has been made in 
making our country more diverse and tolerant 
and embracing of differences in the 21 years 
since the cruel murder of Matthew Shepherd, 
a college student from Laramie, Wyoming. 
As a country, America has made and con-
tinues to make great progress in the area of 
social equality, as evidenced most dramati-
cally by the seismic shift in public support for 
marriage equality over the past decade. 
Today, supporters of marriage equality dra-
matically outnumber opponents by 61 percent 
to 35 percent; a near total reversal from 2004, 
when opponents outnumbered supporters 58 
to 39 percent. 
Our country made progress in bringing our 
LGBTQ brothers and sisters, mother and fa-
thers out of the shadows with the repeal of 
‘‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,’’ which I was proud to 
support. 
Our Nation is now stronger, and our people 
are safer thanks to the sacrifices made by 
these brave Americans, who no longer need 
to choose between service and silence. 
There have been other changes for the bet-
ter. 
In April 2015, President Obama issued a 
landmark Executive Order prohibiting discrimi-
nation against LGBTQ persons in the work-
place. 
This civil rights victory ensures the tax dol-
lars used to pay government contractors sup-
port contractors that are committed to equal 
employment opportunity for all persons regard-
less of sexual orientation. 
This legislation marks a major shift from a 
time when the U.S. Civil Service Commission 
prohibited the hiring of LGBTQ persons to a 
time when President Biden has appointed, and 
the Senate confirmed overwhelmingly, a Sec-
retary of Transportation who is a veteran, a 
former mayor, and an openly gay man. 
And we are making progress in realizing the 
goal of making H.R. 5, the ‘‘Equality Act,’’ the 
law of the land so LGBTQ people will finally 
be guaranteed explicit, permanent protection 
under the nation’s existing civil rights laws 
against discrimination in vital areas of life, like 
employment, access to public spaces, hous-
ing, credit, education, jury service, and feder-
ally-funded programs. 
Madam Speaker, it is unacceptable that in 
31 states LGBTQ people can get married on 
Sunday and remain at risk of being fired or 
evicted. on Monday simply because of who 
they are. 
This year marks the 52nd anniversary of the 
LGBTQ Civil Rights Movement, where activists 
such as Frank Kameny led the struggle for the 
voices of the LGBTQ community to be heard. 
Frank Kameny’s courageous demonstrations 
inspired others to resist mistreatment, and we 
witnessed in 1969 what happens when a com-
munity says enough is enough.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E599 
June 1, 2021 
Our country has made much progress since 
the Stonewall uprising of 1969 but more re-
mains to be done to realize the full promise of 
America that all are equally treated and pro-
tected by the law. 
So there is much reason for joy and opti-
mism when my home city of Houston hosts 
the Ruby Anniversary celebration of Pride 
Week later this month, from June 25 to 28, 
2021. 
According to the 2010 U.S. Census, the 
16th largest LGBTQ community in the Nation 
is located in the Houston metropolitan area, 
which I am privileged to represent. 
The Houston LGBTQ community is culturally 
diverse, economically dynamic, and artistically 
vibrant. 
Houston Pride Week has been an annual 
event for the last 42 years, since 1979, and 
promotes the individuality of Houston’s ever- 
growing LGBTQ community. 
The Pride Festival and Parade are at the 
center of a celebration annually attended by 
more than 700,000 people from Houston and 
around the world. 
Madam Speaker, as the Rev. Dr. Martin Lu-
ther King, Jr. reminded us, ‘‘Darkness cannot 
drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate 
cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.’’ 
All Americans should be deeply concerned 
over the increase in violence and acts of hate 
perpetrated against members of the LGBTQ 
community we have witnessed in recent 
months. 
Madam Speaker, I invite all Americans to 
visit Houston during Houston Pride Week to 
observe how we live out our conviction that 
‘‘Love Will Conquer Hate.’’ 
Progress is made through the efforts of cou-
rageous men and women who actively engage 
their communities and face adversity to ensure 
that the rights of all are clearly recognized and 
protected. 
People like the legendary Bayard Rustin, 
who organized the 1947 Journey of Reconcili-
ation which inspired the Freedom Rides of the 
1960s and helped Dr. King organize the 
Southern Christian Leadership Conference 
and who was the driving force behind the his-
toric 1963 March on Washington. 
Texas natives such as Sheryl Swoopes, a 
3-time WNBA Most Valuable Player and 
champion for the Houston Comets, and former 
Houston Mayor Annise Parker. 
These leaders have set an example of what 
can happen when we lift the limits of inequality 
and support our fellow Americans in their pur-
suits of their inalienable rights. 
Other members of the LGBTQ community 
whose contributions have enriched American 
culture and made our country better include 
the great poet Langston Hughes; Mandy Car-
ter, 2008 national co-chair of Obama Pride 
and lifelong activist; Billy Strayhorn the musi-
cian and gifted composer whose 30-year col-
laboration with Duke Ellington gave the world 
some of the greatest jazz music ever; Tom 
Waddell, army medical doctor and Olympic 
athlete; and James Baldwin, one of the tow-
ering figures in the history of American lit-
erature. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to acknowl-
edge the achievements of just a few of the 
countless number of Americans who over-
came prejudice and discrimination to make 
America a more welcoming place for suc-
ceeding generations of LGBTQ community 
members.
