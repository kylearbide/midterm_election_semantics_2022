The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret

prayer: 
Seek out Your servants, O Lord. 
Wherever we find ourselves, in what-
ever situation we are facing, as we en-
counter the hopes and challenges of 
this day, seek us out, that like sheep of 
Your fold we would know the care You 
offer and follow the guidance You pro-
vide. 
In serving You, may our lips praise 
You, our tongues speak Your truth, 
and our lives reveal the goodness of 
Your promises. 
Hear the prayers we offer to You, 
prayers for the health and healing of 
our land; for the comfort and care for 
those who are without food or shelter; 
for the discussions and deliberations of 
those who lead this country. 
May we listen for the answers You 
provide and ignore the expedience of 
our own opinion. May we yield to Your 
direction and surrender ourselves to 
Your leading. May we heed Your wise 
counsel and silence all voices but Your 
own. 
In You may we find the source of our 
joy, the reason for our lives, and the 
certainty of our salvation. 
In the strength of Your name we 
pray. 
Amen.

IN RECOGNITION OF KATY AND 
TRAVIS MCCABE 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 28, 2022 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Katy and Travis 
McCabe as the recipient of the Blair County 
Chamber’s prestigious Small Businessperson 
of the Year Award. 
Despite the unprecedented challenges small 
business owners have endured, and in the 
face of adversity, Katy and Travis McCabe 
have responded in stride with positivity, and 
unwavering determination as they operate 
Greenbean Coffee house. On their first day of 
business in 2017, they served over 1,500 
drinks, and that number only grows as they 
have expanded into new and exciting locations 
and a full-fledged catering service. I wish them 
well as they plan a new location that will open 
this year. 
On behalf of the people of the 13th Con-
gressional District, I am grateful to the Blair 
County Chamber for their environment that 
fosters community growth and success, and 
for constituents like Travis and Katy for their 
tireless efforts.

IN RECOGNITION OF ANTONE 
‘‘TONY’’ OLIVEIRA 
HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 28, 2022 
Mr. KEATING. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize and celebrate the 100th birthday 
of Antone ‘‘Tony’’ Oliveira, a longtime resident 
of New Bedford, Massachusetts, who served 
our country in World War II and worked for the 
railroad industry for more than 40 years. 
Born on November 14, 1921, Mr. Oliveira 
grew up in New Bedford and briefly worked for 
the Soule Mill before being drafted by the 
Army. Six months into his service, Mr. Oliveira 
was unfortunately injured during weapons 
training and returned home, where he began 
his career in railroading. Mr. Oliveira worked 
for New York, New Haven, and Hartford Rail-
road, which was later consolidated with other 
railroads and became Con-Rail. Stationed all 
over the region, Mr. Oliveira sold tickets, sent 
and 
delivered 
telegraph 
messages, 
and 
manned the control towers that operated the 
switches and signals on the rail. Mr. Oliveira 
loves to reminisce about his early railroading 
days in the postwar years when the railroads 
were extremely busy. He proudly brags that 
he once sold $50,000 worth of tickets in June 
of 1945. 
Mr. Oliveira was the last railroad ticket 
agent in the New Bedford railroad depot and 
sold the last ticket to the New Bedford-Boston 
commuter train, which ended service in 1958. 
In addition to working on the rails, Mr. Oliveira 
found time to volunteer for the Disabled Amer-
ican Veterans organization. In 1987, after 44 
years of working for the railroad, Mr. Oliveira 
retired. When he began working, he was No. 
237 on the seniority list of the telegraphers 
roster. By the time he retired, he was No. 5. 
In his retirement, Mr. Oliveira continues to 
be a railroad enthusiast. He frequently takes 
advantage of his permanent Amtrak pass to 
visit his family. Mr. Oliveira is hopeful that the 
New Bedford commuter rail will reopen, and 
there will be a revival of the once-busy rail line 
carrying people to and from Boston. Mr. 
Oliveira told former state Transportation Sec-
retary Richard Davey that he wanted to sell 
tickets again if the train were to reopen. 
As Mr. Oliveira celebrates his birthday with 
his family, I ask that my colleagues join me in 
wishing him a happy birthday and a profound 
thank you for his lifetime of service.

IN RECOGNITION OF MICHELLE 
AND BRIAN CREE 
HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 28, 2022 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the tremendous contributions of 
Michelle and Brian Cree of Highland Village, 
Texas. It is my privilege to recognize the phil-
anthropic generosity of Mr. and Mrs. Cree to 
the people of Denton County over the past 
twenty-five years. 
Originally from Amarillo, Michelle graduated 
from Texas State University with a degree in 
Social Work. She began her career with Dal-
las County MHMR, where she worked with 
adults with disabilities for thirteen years. After-
wards, she served and held leadership posi-
tions with various non-profit organizations, in-
cluding Metrocrest Community Services, 100 
Women of Influence, the United Way of Den-
ton County, The Salvation Army of North 
Texas, and the Lewisville Education Founda-
tion. In addition, Michelle has been active in 
the PTA in Lewisville ISD schools, earning her 
the PTA Lifetime Achievement Award for her 
service. 
A native of Dallas, Brian learned the value 
of giving at an early age through the example 
of his grandparents and parents. His mother, 
Mary Anne Cree, is a well-known philan-
thropist for whom the headquarters of the 
United Way of Metropolitan Dallas is named. 
Under his capable direction, Brian has chaired 
the Jim Collin/Steve Allen Memorial Golf 
Event, which since 2017 has successfully 
raised over $250,000 in scholarship funds to 
benefit Denton County students. Brian is a re-
spected business professional, currently hold-
ing the title of CEO or Chairman of several 
companies: SWX Global Design & Production, 
Cree Visual Marketing Company, Cree Stra-
tegic Investments, and SWX Global Container 
Conversions. 
Through their generous contribution of time, 
talents, and funding, Mr. and Mrs. Cree’s ef-
forts have significantly benefited multiple orga-
nizations including the United Way of Denton 
County, the Lewisville Education Foundation, 
the Denton Public School Foundation, The 
Salvation Army of North Texas, and the United 
Way of Metropolitan Dallas. The Crees bro-
kered a crucial partnership between the United 
Way of Denton County and the United Way of 
Metropolitan Dallas which allowed the United 
Way of Denton County to expand fundraising 
into southern Denton County to better engage 
local governments, non-profits, and busi-
nesses to collectively combat county-wide 
challenges, such as homelessness and mental 
health. As well, the couple have contributed 
over $1.5 million dollars in college scholar-
ships and have pledged $50,000 toward the 
‘‘Michelle & Brian Cree SWX Global Design & 
Production Leadership Giving Circle’’, which is 
designed to increase individual leadership gifts 
of $1,000 or more for the United Way of Den-
ton County. 
I am pleased to join the United Way of Den-
ton County in saluting philanthropists Brian 
and Michelle Cree as they were recently hon-
ored by the organization with the 2021 Dr. 
Betty Myers Humanitarian Award.

COMMEMORATING 
THE 
OPENING 
OF MOJO DONUTS’ NEWEST LO-
CATION 
HON. CARLOS A. GIMENEZ 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 28, 2022 
Mr. GIMENEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to commemorate the opening of Mojo Donuts’ 
newest location in Florida’s 26th Congres-
sional District. Since its inception in 2013, 
what started as one small business, today has 
expanded to several locations throughout the 
Miami area that specialize in gourmet donuts. 
Jimmy Piedrahita had a vision to bring his de-
licious donuts from his first location in Miami 
to South Florida including Kendall, Home-
stead, and the Florida Keys. He teamed up 
with Shawn Neifeld and Willie Mun˜oz to make 
his vision a reality. 
The owners have taken a distinct approach 
that has allowed for them to create and craft 
unique donuts that incorporate South Florida 
flavors. Their achieved success has been a di-
rect result of revolutionizing and fostering in-
novative ideas. These ideas have led to nu-
merous customer favorites that include Guava 
and Cheese Donut, Cre`me Bruˆle´e Donut, and 
Abuelita Donut. Over the last few years, Mojo 
Donuts has notably achieved significant mile-
stones. They were the first donut shop to be 
featured on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives, a 
well-known program featured on the Food Net-
work that spotlights America’s best food estab-
lishments. 
When not working on crafting the next cus-
tomer favorite, Mojo Donuts takes every op-
portunity to give back to the community.

HONORING THE STERLING CAREER 
AND SERVICE OF CATHY IINO 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 28, 2022 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the tenure of a distinguished 
public servant in my district, Cathy Iino, of 
Killingworth, 
Connecticut. 
As 
First 
Selectwoman for the Town of Killingworth, 
Cathy chose to not seek re-election in 2021, 
marking a capstone to almost 20 years in 
service to her local community. Leading a 
tight-knit community of more than 6,300 resi-
dents, Cathy has consistently gone above and 
beyond in working with her constituency to 
promote the advancement of Killingworth while 
preserving its small-town charm. Her approach 
to leadership—a prime representation of east-
ern Connecticut values—stressed the impor-
tance of cooperation, respect, and humility. 
Cathy studied Humanities at the University 
of Chicago, graduating in 1973. After having 
already moved to the nearby city of New 
Haven, Cathy and her husband, Paul, were in 
search of a place to call home, moving to 
Killingworth in 1996. While working as both a 
writer and editor, Cathy continually came 
across new opportunities for her community to 
grow, prompting her to depart from her line of 
work and enter the world of politics. First serv-
ing on the Board of Finance, then she found 
success in 2007 winning her bid to serve on 
the Board of Selectman—the first woman 
since 1993 to sit on the Board. In 2009, she 
elevated her leadership in the town when she 
was elected First Selectwoman. 
During her tenure as First Selectwoman, 
Cathy prioritized being present and available 
for her residents. In 2015, for example, Cathy 
implemented 
‘‘Coffee 
with 
the 
First 
Selectwoman,’’ to increase transparency and 
citizen participation in their town government. 
She would make herself routinely available for 
residents to talk to, whether it was outside 
town hall or at a local business. Though there 
are countless examples that demonstrate 
Cathy’s guiding philosophy of bottom-up gov-
erning, perhaps the most successful was her 
ability to seek out and nurture volunteers to 
push forward the issues that mattered to them. 
Cathy truly appreciated the difference that 
volunteers make in small-town communities, 
embodying the spirit of volunteerism through 
her unwavering support of resident leaders. 
Being a smaller town, Killingworth has always 
had to put its resources to good use and has 
been best suited to rely on the voices of many 
rather than one. Frequently, Cathy encour-
aged residents to advocate for projects that 
they were passionate about, at which point 
she would lend her support and experience. 
This style of leadership is one of many traits 
that defined her time as First Selectwoman, 
and it reaped great rewards. One notable re-
sult of her support of volunteers is the restora-
tion of Parmelee Farm, a historical site in 
Killingworth which had long been in a state of 
disrepair. Purely through volunteer efforts 
aided by Cathy’s guiding hand, the farm has 
since become a vibrant area that connects the 
community together by way of recreation, edu-
cation, preservation, and the arts. 
During her time in office, Cathy was para-
mount 
to 
addressing 
the 
quality 
of 
Killingworth’s capital assets—most notably of 
which would be the town’s surface infrastruc-
ture. Under her leadership, a two-year study 
was conducted on Killingworth’s roads, and 
the most deficient in town have since been re-
habilitated. 
Madam Speaker, as the congressman who 
represents Killingworth, I had a chance to ob-
serve up close Cathy’s fine work, whether it 
was dealing with natural disasters, such as 
Hurricane Sandy or the Covid pandemic and 
she always performed superbly. She was ex-
tremely knowledgeable about the interaction of 
local, state, and federal programs which was 
invaluable to her town. 
Madam Speaker, it is an incredible honor to 
represent and work with constituents as indus-
trious and progress-oriented as Cathy Iino. 
Throughout her 12 years in service, Cathy has 
capably understood that leadership is about 
visualizing the connections that may exist 
within one’s own community and then uplifting 
those connections in order to amplify the 
heartbeat of the town. Cathy is dedicating her 
well-deserved retirement to her family—her 
husband, two daughters, and one grand-
daughter. Even upon entering retirement, 
Cathy has remained civically minded, thinking 
about those issues which both our nation and 
the State of Connecticut face. Her diligent pro-
fessionalism, caring nature, and honest, down- 
to-earth style of leadership will be impossible 
to replace, so we must find gratitude in that 
her impact on Killingworth will certainly last for 
generations to come. To these ends, I ask that 
my colleagues in the House join me in hon-
oring Cathy Iino, a steward to her community 
and model citizen.

IN RECOGNITION OF MONICA 
LYDEN MULLIN 
HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 28, 2022 
Mr. KEATING. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in recognition of Monica Lyden Mullin, a self-
less, committed public servant who has dedi-
cated over forty years to service to the people 
of Massachusetts. 
Born in East Weymouth, Massachusetts, 
Monica and her seven siblings are the children 
of a labor leader and longtime member of 
MassPort’s Board of Directors. Early on, she 
realized that she had an affinity for public 
service and a commitment to helping others. 
Her start in government came in 1979 when 
she worked for then-Governor Edward J. King 
in the Appointments Office. Working directly 
with members of the House and Senate, she 
quickly developed the skills and relationships 
that would support her work throughout her 
career. What set Monica apart was the fact 
that she cared more about people than poli-
tics. For Monica, it didn’t matter what the per-
son’s party affiliation was. It only mattered that 
they needed help and Monica could do some-
thing to make their situation a little better. 
After four years at the State House and 
three years at Mass Housing, Monica decided 
to put her career on hold to raise Sean, Wil-
liam, and Brendan, the three boys she had 
with her husband, Sean. However, the call to 
public service was inexorable, and she joined 
State Senator Therese Murray’s district staff 
working 
directly 
on 
constituent 
matters. 
Monica engrossed herself in district issues 
and never lost sight of the true aim of govern-
ment—to help the constituents we serve. 
Whether it was base realignment efforts in 
2005 that impacted Joint Base Cape Cod or 
planning for the Plymouth 400 commemora-
tion. Monica honorably represented the Sen-
ator and the residents of the Plymouth and 
Barnstable District. 
Her 
invaluable 
work 
was 
recognized 
throughout state government. When Senate 
President Murray, a Democrat, stepped down 
from her seat, the Republican who succeeded 
her asked Monica to continue as his District 
Director. Monica once again saw people, not 
politics, as the foundation of her work. She 
gladly stayed on and has continued to serve 
the people of the Plymouth and Barnstable 
District under Senator Viriato deMacedo and 
his successor, Senator Susan Moran. More re-
cently, families, neighbors, and businesses 
faced upheaval as COVID–19 swept the 
globe. Monica’s decades-long experience and 
deep understanding of government made an 
immeasurable difference for scores of con-
stituents. She has always taken great satisfac-
tion in helping and advocating for people, es-
pecially during the COVID crisis. 
Monica’s illustrious career in public service 
is deserving of recognition and her dedication, 
selflessness, and commitment to the people of 
Massachusetts is worthy of distinction. Madam 
Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in 
congratulating Monica Mullin on her retirement 
and recognizing her for her outstanding serv-
ice to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

sional development, and in turn, can excel in 
their career but also in our Blair County com-
munity. Becky embodies the power and wis-
dom of the Greek’s mythological Athena

not an understatement to say that Becky is a 
champion for our women. 
On behalf of the people of the 13th Con-
gressional District, I am grateful to the Blair 
County Chamber for their work to create an 
environment that fosters community growth 
and success, and for constituents like Becky 
for their tireless work.

HON. DAVID G. VALADAO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 28, 2022 
Mr. VALADAO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of Mr. Dave Borcky, 
who passed away on Tuesday, January 18, 
2022. 
A native of McFarland, California, Mr.

for the McFarland Christmas Parade. 
Mr. Borcky was a key player in McFarland’s 
community for several years. It is with great 
pride that I recognize him for his service and 
leadership to his country and his community. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the 
United States House of Representatives to 
join me in honoring the life of Mr. Dave

IN MEMORY OF ZENOBIA VIOLA 
HARRIS BIVENS 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 28, 2022 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, today 
I rise with a heavy heart, to remember the life 
of a special young woman, and to celebrate a 
life interrupted too soon. 
Zenobia Viola Harris Bivens, 40, of Houston, 
Texas, passed away on January 8, 2022 after 
a sudden and unexpected case of meningitis. 
Zenobia was a mother, wife, sister, daugh-
ter, aunt, cousin, and friend. She was born on 
September 15, 1981, in Goldsboro, North 
Carolina at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base 
to Johnny Harris Jr. and Major Regina V. Har-
ris. She is preceded in death by her father, 
Johnny Harris Jr. and is survived by her hus-
band, Darvell Bivens; son, Dean Roque Harris 
Bivens; mother, Regina V. Harris; sister, 
LaGina R. Harris; and brother, Johnny B. Har-
ris III and his wife, Jessica M. Saulter Harris. 
Zenobia’s greatest impact was sharing her 
heart and time with those that knew and loved 
her, especially Darvell, her college sweetheart 
and best friend for over 20 years. Together 
they gathered a ‘Village’ of educators, friends 
and family to create a loving, fun, and nur-
turing environment for their son Dean. Zenobia 
based her actions on her family values of 
‘God, Family, and Education’. 
Zenobia graduated from San Angelo Central 
High School in 1999 and went on to attend 
college at West Texas A&M where she won a 
National Title in Speech and Debate was 
named University Woman of the Year, was 
featured in Glamour Magazine, and met the 
love of her life—Darvell Bivens. She grad-
uated magna cum laude with a Bachelor of 
Science 
in 
Mass 
Communication—Broad-
casting. 
She received the Future Faculty Fellowship 
(full scholarship to receive master’s degree 
and doctorate) to attend the University of Ala-
bama. While at the University, Zenobia was 
the co-founder of the Coalition for Change (or-
ganization dedicated to identifying and pre-
serving historic Civil Rights sites including dis-
covering unmarked graves of the enslaved on 
the campus grounds). 
She graduated summa cum laude with a 
Master of Arts in Communication Studies from 
the University of Alabama. Zenobia then at-
tended Northwestern University—Pritzker Law 
School where she was a legal extern to former 
Senator Barack Obama and graduated cum 
laude with a Doctor of Jurisprudence. 
In her profession, Zenobia’s achievements 
are numerous and impressive. Zenobia served 
as clerk for the Honorable Carl E. Stewart of 
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit 
and the Honorable Justice Dale Wainwright 
(ret.) of the Texas Supreme Court. She was a 
renowned trial and appellate lawyer. 
She served as counsel in cases involving 
NASA, the Department of Defense, and the 
Department of Housing and Urban Develop-
ment among many. Her cases were featured 
in Forbes, The New York Times, and The 
Houston Chronicle. 
Zenobia successfully argued a case before 
the United States Supreme Court. At the time 
of her death, Zenobia was a Managing Partner 
for the Frost, Brown & Todd Law Firm. 
She was relentless in her pursuit for justice, 
and this was evident in her pro bono advocacy 
work as she was particularly passionate about 
helping those who had been denied justice by 
the legal system that she so cherished. 
Zenobia was truly a force of nature. She 
commanded attention and respect in any 
space she entered, be it a family room, court-
room, a garden, or even a podium for one of 
her epic speeches. 
Anyone meeting Zenobia for the first time 
might have been intimidated by the sheer 
power of her presence. Those who knew 
Zenobia realized that one of her most signifi-
cant impacts was in the one-on-one discus-
sions, when her questions or advice could pro-
vide new confidence or reveal a new strength 
in those she loved. 
Zenobia did not get the quantity of time on 
Earth she deserved or that we wanted; what 
she lacked in quantity, she more than made 
up for with quality. Zenobia once mentioned 
that the greatest people in history made their 
biggest impacts early in their lives. 
She was taken physically from this world 
much too soon, but Zenobia leaves it, and us, 
better. 
As Zenobia walked ahead of us, she set the 
bar high and built upon the foundation her 
predecessors laid. She walked beside us, as 
a companion on our own journeys of growth. 
She supported and sustained us when we fell. 
As a result of having known her, we are invig-
orated and stronger. 
Zenobia did her work to change the world 
now, we must honor her by continuing ours.

HON. FRANK J. MRVAN

Friday, January 28, 2022 
Mr. MRVAN. Madam Speaker, it is with 
great admiration that I take this time to recog-
nize the Munster Chamber of Commerce as 
the organization celebrates its 66th Annual 
Gala. This year, the Chamber will honor 
Damian Rico with the Volunteer of the Year 
award, and the Citizen of the Year award will

this special occasion, the Munster Chamber

uary 29, 2022, at the Center for Visual and

his time and efforts to numerous charitable or-
ganizations throughout the region including the 
Salvation Army, the Crystal Taliefero Journey 
with the Arts Foundation, Schererville Shock 
Travel Baseball, and the Munster Chamber of 
Commerce, to name a few. As Community 
Relations Director at Hospice of the Calumet 
Area, Mr. Rico has touched the lives of count-
less individuals. He believes that his career at 
Hospice is a calling, and I admire Damian’s 
ability to provide support to patients and their 
families during such difficult times. Mr. Rico’s 
compassion and generosity of spirit make him 
a perfect fit for this role. For his many con-
tributions to the Northwest Indiana community, 
Damian is worthy of our highest praise. 
The Citizen of the Year award will be pre-
sented to Wendy Mis, Clerk-Treasurer for the 
Town of Munster. Throughout her career, Mrs. 
Mis has served the community of Munster and 
Northwest Indiana in numerous capacities. In 
2010, she became the Executive Director for 
the Munster Chamber of Commerce, a posi-
tion she held for many years. Mrs. Mis was 
also active in the Munster School Corporation 
and served as a past PTO President. In addi-
tion, she has given of her time and expertise 
to many organizations and boards including 
the Munster Education Foundation, the Mun-
ster Booster Club, Friends of Hospice, the Ro-
tary Club of Munster, and the Northern Indiana 
Regional Planning Commission, to name a 
few. For her outstanding and constant dedica-
tion to the community of Munster and beyond, 
Wendy is worthy of the highest commenda-
tion. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that you and my 
other distinguished colleagues join me in rec-
ognizing the Munster Chamber of Commerce 
as the organization celebrates its 66th Annual 
Gala and in honoring Damian Rico as Volun-
teer of the Year and Wendy Mis as Citizen of

MAYOR 
ROBERT 
‘‘BOB’’ CORREIA 
HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 28, 2022 
Mr. KEATING. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the life of Robert Correia, former 
Majority Whip of the Massachusetts House of 
Representatives and mayor of Fall River, Mas-
sachusetts. 
Born and raised in Fall River, Bob grad-

After an honorable discharge in 1962, he be-
came a math and science teacher at the 
Henry Lord School in Fall River. 
Later in 1977, desiring to further serve his 
community, Bob ran for local office and was 
elected to the Massachusetts House of Rep-
resentatives. Representing the Bristol 12th 
and 7th District respectively. Bob was proud of 
his city and his Portuguese heritage. In 1985, 
he founded Heritage Day of Portugal com-
memoration at the state house on Beacon Hill, 
an annual event that continues to this day. 
Holding several important positions over his 
decades of service. Bob became Majority 
Whip of the House of Representatives in 
2002. A successful legislator, he secured state 
funding to develop the boardwalk that runs

cluded his 3 children, Robert Jr., Susan, and 
Mark.

IN RECOGNITION OF RICHARD L. 
LOCKARD, SR. 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 28, 2022 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor the life and memory 
of Richard L. Lockard, Sr. of Altoona, Pennsyl-
vania, who passed away on January 14, 2022, 
after eighty-six years of exceptional life. 
Dick was a 1953 graduate of Altoona Area 
High School, which he later revisited to spend 
over forty years serving as the longest tenured 
board member in Altoona Area School Dis-
trict’s board. This is unsurprising, as his col-
leagues describe him as a man with incom-
parable drive and focus on creating opportuni-
ties for the community’s youth- even after their 
graduations. 
Athletics were clearly a passion of Dick’s. 
As chairman for the school district’s athletic 
council, he encouraged the life lessons and 
character development that could be fostered 
from youth participation in sports. Equally as 
important, he encouraged friendship, and fun. 
Individuals of this caliber are few and far be-
tween. On behalf of Pennsylvania’s 13th Con-
gressional District, it is my privilege to cele-
brate the life of Richard L. Lockard, Sr. and 
honor his legacy. As we remember Richard for 
his many contributions to Blair County and its 
community, I extend my deepest condolences 
to his family and friends.

HIS 
100TH

HON. MIKE BOST 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 28, 2022 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
celebrate Carbondale, Illinois, resident Dwight 
Barr’s 100th birthday. Dwight was born to par-
ents Wes and Blanche Barr on January 21,

the 63rd battalion of the 11th Armored Infantry 
Division. On June 6, 1956, Dwight married 
Maxine Chapman and the couple planted their 
roots in Carbondale. They had four children; 
David, Mary, Danny, and James. They were 
later blessed with six grandchildren and four 
great-grandchildren. Dwight currently spends 
his days reading, spending time with his 
friends at the Voyage living center, and keep 
up with his family. Madam Speaker, please

stone 100th birthday. On behalf of Southern Il-
linois, I thank him for his service to our nation

IN 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
JOE 
GRAUPENSPERGER 
AND 
HIS 
SERVICE TO THE HOUSE JUDICI-
ARY COMMITTEE 
HON. JERROLD NADLER 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 28, 2022 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
thank Joe Graupensperger for his many years 
of service to the Committee on the Judiciary. 
Joe came to the Committee after working at 
the Office of Legislative Affairs at the U.S. De-
partment of Justice, where he handled a range 
of issues related to federal criminal law. He 
had previously practiced law in Washington, 
DC, and got his J.D. from the University of Vir-
ginia School of Law. 
Joe was already a veteran of the Office of 
Legislative Affairs at the U.S. Department of 
Justice when he came to the Hill in 2009. Our 
Chairman at the time, John Conyers, Jr., 
brought him onto the team to handle crime 
policy for the Committee. Chairman Conyers’s 
faith in Joe was well placed. Joe is, today, the 
Chief Counsel of our Subcommittee on Crime, 
Terrorism, and Homeland Security—and in his 
span of service, Joe has drafted dozens of 
laws, run hundreds of hearings, and, without 
question, helped to improve the lives of mil-
lions of Americans. 
Joe’s track record speaks for itself. He has 
played a role in every major criminal justice 
reform effort that has been signed into law in 
the past dozen years, including the Fair Sen-
tencing Act and the First Step Act, as well as 
laws to improve the National Instant Back-
ground Check System, address the rape kit 
backlog, reform surveillance practices, and es-
tablish rights for survivors of sexual assault. 
In fact, last Congress alone, under Joe’s 
leadership, the Crime Subcommittee advanced 
more than a dozen bills that were ultimately 
signed into law—despite a divided Congress 
and a Republican President. He has ensured 
that several other measures were signed into 
law this Congress as well. 
This is Joe’s last month as Chief Counsel 
for our Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, 
and Homeland Security. Although we con-
gratulate him on his engagement and wish 
him well on his move to Texas, we will miss 
his leadership, his friendship, and his stead-
fast dedication to justice for all. Simply put, 
our country is better off because of Joe’s work 
as a public servant. 
I thank Joe for his service to the Committee, 
and wish him the best of luck with this exciting 
next chapter.

IN RECOGNITION OF SCOTT 
BRENNEMAN 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 28, 2022 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Scott Brenneman 
as the recipient of the Blair County Chamber’s 
prestigious Donna D. Gority Servant Leader-
ship Award. 
This honor is awarded to those who embody 
servant leadership by making the conscious 
choice to serve first, and then lead, as a way 
of furthering their service. These qualities are 
admirable, and for such a reason, I am hon-
ored to recognize Mr. Brenneman as a pillar of 
our Blair County community. After twenty-one 
years of military service, Scott continued a 
path of selflessness and excellence, dedi-
cating himself to involvement in Sweat for 
Vets, 
Operation 
Evergreen, 
and 
the 
Hollidaysburg Area School District Board. 
On behalf of the people of the 13th Con-
gressional District, I am grateful to the Blair 
County Chamber for their work to create an 
environment that fosters community growth 
and success, and for constituents like Scott for 
their tireless work.

IN RECOGNITION OF BRENDA 
SWAIN 
HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 28, 2022 
Mr. KEATING. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in recognition of Brenda Swain, a dedicated 
volunteer who has performed remarkable serv-
ice to the greater Cape Cod community. 
As a young child. Brenda’s parents instilled 
in her a spirit of volunteerism that has re-
mained with her to this day. Since graduating 
college, she has put serving others at the core 
of all she does. For twenty years, she worked 
as a substitute teacher, an early childhood ed-
ucator, and director of a preschool daycare 
center. In Falmouth, however, Brenda is best- 
known for her steadfast and transformational 
leadership of the Falmouth Service Center. 
On her first day, the Center was housed in 
a small room at the end of a shopping plaza 
with just thirty-five volunteers operating a food 
pantry 
and 
offering 
financial 
assistance. 
Today, after seventeen years of Brenda’s 
guidance, the Falmouth Service Center has 
been transformed into an expansive resource 
for residents, providing access to health care, 
financial support, and food. 
Under Brenda’s leadership, the Falmouth 
Service Center now operates fourteen different 
programs and boasts six hundred volunteers. 
Over the years, Brenda worked to add numer-
ous programs such as Falmouth Eats To-
gether, a community-wide free meal, to the 
center’s offerings. She created fresh markets 
in the Falmouth Public Schools and worked to 
bring a mobile dental clinic that comes once a 
month to the center. Brenda also developed a 
partnership with WE CAN—Women’s Em-
powerment through Cape Area Networking— 
which uses the service center offices once a 
month, and constantly worked to expand the 
center’s resources for Falmouth residents. 
Madam Speaker, Brenda Swain has served 
as an unshakeable pillar supporting Falmouth 
and Cape Cod for her entire life. I ask that my 
colleagues join me in recognizing Ms. Brenda 
Swain’s remarkable career and commending 
her for her steadfast dedication to community 
service and volunteerism.

HONORING THE LIFE OF BETTY 
WHITE 
HON. TED LIEU 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 28, 2022 
Mr. LIEU. Madam Speaker, I rise to cele-
brate the life of Betty White, who passed away 
on December 31, 2021, at the age of 99, three 
weeks before what would have been her 
100th birthday. A longtime resident of Califor-
nia’s 33rd Congressional District, Betty was a 
Hollywood icon and a devoted animal welfare 
advocate whose career in theater, film, tele-
vision, and radio spanned eight decades. In 
that time, she earned numerous awards and 
accolades and endeared herself to audiences 
across America and around the world. 
Betty was born on January 17, 1922, in Oak 
Park, Illinois, to Horace and Tess White. The 
family moved to Beverly Hills when Betty was 
a child, and she graduated from Beverly Hills 
High School in 1939. Betty’s entertainment ca-
reer began as a recent graduate, when she 
took part in one of the first ever experimental 
television broadcasts. She put her career on 
pause because of World War II, when she 
served in the American Women’s Voluntary 
Services, delivering supplies to soldiers sta-
tioned along the Santa Monica Mountains. 
After the war, she dabbled in both radio and 
television, appearing in radio shows like 
Blondie and This is Your FBI and hosting the 
talk shows Hollywood on Television and The 
Betty White Show. She established herself as 
a force for justice on one of her eponymous 
shows, willing to stand up for what was right. 
After featuring Arthur Duncan, a Black tap 
dancer, on her nationally syndicated show, 
Betty received calls from television stations in 
the Jim Crow South to fire Duncan or risk 
being taken off the air. Rather than accede to 
racist demands, Betty invited him back three 
more times. 
Though Betty had married twice before, it 
wasn’t until her stints in the early 1960s on 
various game shows as a celebrity guest on 
To Tell the Truth, I’ve Got a Secret, and 
What’s My Line? that she met her true love. 
After appearing on Password, she and host 
Allan Ludden got to know each other, and he 
eventually proposed. They married in 1963 
and remained together until his death by stom-
ach cancer in 1981. The couple had had no 
children of their own, but she helped raise 
Ludden’s three sons and daughters from a 
previous marriage. Of Ludden, she said ‘‘I’ll 
never get over him’’ and never remarried. 
Betty played her best-known roles in the lat-
ter part of her career. She played Sue Ann 
Nivens on The Mary Tyler Moore Show from 
1973 to 1977 and Rose Nyland on The Gold-
en Girls from 1985 to 1992. As Sue Ann, Betty 
was wily, crafty, and cunning behind her wide, 
beaming smile, which contrasted with Rose’s 
naivete and innocence. Both roles helped her 
win Emmy Awards, of which she won eight in 
total: five Primetime, two Daytime, and a Los 
Angeles regional. She also won three Amer-
ican Comedy Awards, three Screen Actors 
Guild Awards, and a Grammy. 
Appearances in a Super Bowl commercial 
for Snickers, 2009’s romantic comedy The 
Proposal, and a guest host spot on Saturday 
Night Live reintroduced Betty to a new genera-
tion of film and television viewers, sparking a 
resurgence in her career that lasted well into 
her nineties. However, she repeatedly said 
over the years that show business was only a 
means to fund her other passion: animal wel-
fare. 
Betty grew up surrounded by animals, re-
counting how her family at one point owned 
20 dogs. Such an upbringing cemented her 
love for all species at an early age. She pro-
duced and starred in The Pet Set, a syn-
dicated talk show in which celebrity guests 
talked about their pets in the early 1970s. 
Betty also contributed and sat on the board of 
trustees of a host of animal welfare organiza-
tions, including the Morris Animal Foundation, 
Greater Los Angeles Zoo Association, the 
American Humane Association, and the Fund 
for Animals. 
Betty’s support for the Los Angeles Zoo and 
its foundation dated back to the zoo’s opening 
in 1966. In 1974, she joined The Greater Los 
Angeles Zoo Association’s Board of Trustees 
and hosted a television special alongside sev-
eral celebrity friends, including Mary Tyler 
Moore, Jimmy Stewart, and Los Angeles 
Mayor Tom Bradley. In 2006, Los Angeles 
Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa honored Betty with 
the title of ‘‘Ambassador to the Animals,’’ and 
the Los Angeles Chapter of the American As-
sociation of Zoo Keepers made her an hon-
orary zookeeper in 2013. Throughout the 
years, Betty was seen at the zoo’s charitable 
functions smiling alongside an assortment of 
animals, including pythons, owls, sloths, and 
giraffes. 
Betty White’s pioneering career brought 
laughter into the homes of millions and will 
continue to do so for generations to come. Her 
support for animal welfare over the years, 
which inspired thousands to carry on the torch 
of the cause after her death, also cannot be 
overstated. May her memory be a blessing.

IN RECOGNITION OF SUE GRIEP 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 28, 2022 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Sue Griep as the 
recipient of the Blair County Chamber’s pres-
tigious Leadership Blair County Fellow Award. 
This award was created in 1997 when the 
Leadership Blair County Steering Committee 
understood the need to recognize those who 
uphold their mission of leadership and stew-
ardship towards the Blair County Community. 
While no small feat, Sue’s efforts to benefit 
those around her have rippled through her 
neighbors, and her modesty only underlines 
the true selflessness of her dedication. 
On behalf of the people of the 13th Con-
gressional District, I am grateful to the Blair 
County Chamber for their environment that 
fosters community growth and success, and 
for constituents like Sue for their tireless ef-
forts.

RECOGNIZING DR. NASIR AHMED 
HON. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 28, 2022 
Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Madam Speaker, 
today I wish to recognize the seminal contribu-
tions of Dr. Nasir Ahmed in the field of com-
puter science, whose work on image proc-
essing underlies much of the video confer-
encing and photo sharing technology that we 
now take for granted—technology that has 
been essential to getting us through this pan-
demic. 
Born in Bangalore, India, Dr. Ahmed immi-
grated to the United States in 1961 to pursue 
a masters and then a Ph.D. at the University 
of New Mexico. It was there that Dr. Ahmed 
met his wife, Esther Parente-Ahmed, whose 
love and support proved instrumental to Dr. 
Ahmed’s 
career. 
Describing 
Esther, 
Dr. 
Ahmed said, ‘‘she helped me all through my 
career; she was always next to me.’’ 
After receiving his doctorate from the Uni-
versity of New Mexico, Dr. Ahmed became a 
Professor of Electrical and Computer Engi-

While at Kansas State, Professor Ahmed de-
veloped the discrete cosine transform, known 
as DCT, as a way to compress digital images. 
Working with his Ph.D. student, T. Raj 
Natarajan, and colleague, Dr. K. R. Rao, Pro-
fessor Ahmed developed a working DCT algo-
rithm, and the results, first published in 1974, 
‘‘appeared too good to be true,’’ in Dr. 
Ahmed’s words. Indeed, the new algorithm 
performed better than any other method of 
digital image compression. 
In layman’s terms, digital files that contain 
images, photos, videos, and audio are simply 
too large to practically send over the internet; 
to share this data, it must be compressed. The 
discrete cosine transform is the most widely 
used method for compressing digital images, 
and DCT would become the basis for innu-
merable other technologies for sharing and 
streaming photos, video, and audio that we 
now take for granted. 
Our zoom calls, that JPEG your friend sent 
you last weekend, the MP3s you listened to 
jogging this morning—it’s all thanks to Nasir 
Ahmed. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of all of us who 
use these essential technologies every day, I 
want to thank Dr. Ahmed for his contributions 
to computer science, which have brought us 
together and reshaped our world in ways we 
could have scarcely imagined when the dis-
crete cosine transform was first published.

HONORING THE CAREER OF DR. 
BILL KATIP 
HON. JIM BANKS 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 28, 2022 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Dr. Bill Katip as he prepares to retire 
from his position as president of Grace Col-
lege. 
Having served as Grace College president 
for the last 22 years, Katip led the institution 
in several groundbreaking initiatives including 
an accelerated three-year bachelor’s degree 
program, a four-year bachelor’s and master’s 
program and Deploy—Grace’s competency- 
based seminary program. 
As a result of these initiatives, and many 
more, Katip has led the school through historic 
milestones, including Aspire, its $40 million 
comprehensive campaign, and recruiting the 
school’s largest-ever incoming class of stu-
dents for the 2021–22 school year. 
As successful as Katip was in strengthening 
Grace College’s standing academically and fi-
nancially, he also maintains a beloved reputa-
tion among students. Over the years, Katip 
made it a point to attend campus events, trav-
el with students on trips and, most importantly, 
to be someone in a position of authority by 
whose example Christ’s light shines upon the 
world. 
I have known Dr. Katip for many years and 
had the opportunity to call upon his assistance 
several times in preparing for hearings in Con-
gress. I know him to be not only an out-
standing college president and counselor, but 
also a consummate friend and Christian. 
I wish him and his wife, Debbie, Godspeed 
in a most deserved retirement. Even with his 
departure from Grace College, his legacy will 
endure, and his presence will be felt on the 
campus and beyond for years to come. 
IN RECOGNITION OF POLICE CHIEF 
WALTER SWEENEY 
HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 28, 2022 
Mr. KEATING. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate the career of Police Chief Walter 
Sweeney, who is retiring from the Hanover 
Police Department after 43 years of service to 
our community. 
Walter Sweeney grew up in Massachusetts, 
graduating from Hanover High School. He 
earned a Bachelor’s Degree in Criminal Jus-
tice from Stonehill College and a Master’s De-
gree in Criminal Justice Administration from 
Western New England College. 
Chief Sweeney began his career with the 
Town of Hanover in 1977 as a volunteer fire-
fighter and later joined the Hanover Police De-
partment in 1978 as an emergency commu-
nications center dispatcher. From there, he 
rose through the ranks—serving as an officer, 
sergeant, and lieutenant before ultimately 
being appointed police chief in 2008. 
Chief Sweeny pursued additional opportuni-
ties to serve his community and is an active 
member of several committees. He is a past 
president of the Plymouth County Chiefs of 
Police Association and a current member of 
the Plymouth County Outreach Board of Direc-
tors. Chief Sweeney also holds membership 
status in the Massachusetts Chief of Police 
Association, the International Association of 
Chiefs of Police, and the Southeastern Massa-
chusetts Chiefs of Police. Additionally, Chief 
Sweeney was appointed as the Acting Town 
Manager for the Town of Hanover in 2012 and 
is also a long-lime instructor at the Massachu-
setts State Police Academy. 
Chief Sweeney’s leadership and commit-
ment to reforming law enforcement’s role to-
wards drug addiction and recovery is among 
his outstanding achievements. Sweeney has 
been on the Plymouth County Outreach team, 
a collaboration of police departments focused 
on helping those with substance abuse dis-
order. since its founding in 2017. The pro-
gram, which Chief Sweeney was instrumental 
in creating, has been nationally recognized for 
its innovation and results after fatal overdoses 
in Plymouth County decreased by 26 percent. 
Chief Sweeney has been a strong advocate 
for the PCO model and presented on this pro-
gram at the 2020 COAP National Forum and 
the 2019 PAARI National Conference. 
I want to congratulate Chief Sweeney on his 
exemplary career and service to our commu-
nity. Chief Sweeney will gather with family and 
friends on December 16 to celebrate his retire-
ment from the Hanover Police Department. I 
thank Chief Sweeney for his lifetime of exem-
plary service. I wish him and his family all the 
best in your future endeavors.

IN RECOGNITION OF DEE MARTIN- 
SPALLONE 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 28, 2022 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Dee Martin- 
Spallone as the recipient of the Blair County 
Chamber’s prestigious George Award. 
Allegheny Lutheran Social Ministries, along-
side the Blair County Chamber, present this 
award to a community member whose tireless 
volunteer effort do not go unnoticed, despite 
their ceaseless humility and modesty. Dee 
Martin-Spallone has been selected for her em-
bodiment of hard work and dedication without 
desire for acknowledgement. Dee founded the 
National Organization First Book in Blair 
County, as well as Angel Feet Ministry, to en-
sure that children in need have access to new 
socks, shoes, and books. Further, she person-
ally creates and sells products to raise money 
for the Roaring Spring Community Library, and 
directly works with the Altoona Area School 
District to provide mentorship and guidance to 
our community’s youth. 
On behalf of the people of the 13th Con-
gressional District, I am grateful to the Blair 
County Chamber for their environment that 
fosters community growth and success, and 
for constituents like Miss Martin-Spallone for 
their tireless efforts.

HONORING BROOKE BARNARD FOR 
EXEMPLARY SERVICE 
HON. KAY GRANGER 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 28, 2022 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
pay tribute to Brooke Boyer Barnard for her 
exemplary dedication and service to our na-
tion. Since 2007, Brooke has worked for the 
House Appropriations Defense Subcommittee, 
most recently as the Professional Staff Mem-
ber overseeing significant funding for the 
United States Navy and Marine Corps. 
Brooke is a proud native of Fairfax Station, 
Virginia, and is the daughter of Gary and 
Cathy Boyer. She earned a bachelor’s degree 
in Economics at the University of Virginia and 
a master’s degree in Public Policy from 
George Mason University. 
Brooke started her career in 2003 as a 
Budget Analyst for the United States Army. In 
2007, Brooke transitioned to begin her storied 
career with the House Appropriations Com-
mittee. Over the course of her time on the 
committee, Brooke has overseen a wide range 
of accounts for the Department of Defense. As 
one of the most seasoned and trusted staff 
members, Brooke has played a key role in 
some of the most important decisions relating 
to the Department of Defense over the past 15 
years. Over the past six years, Brooke directly 
oversaw all procurement and research, devel-
opment, testing, and evaluation accounts for 
the Departments of Navy and Marine Corps. 
With her insights and deep understanding of 
these programs, we, as a committee, were 
able to make informed decisions to keep our 
nation safe. Simply put, we are better off be-
cause of Brooke’s tremendous service. 
In January, Brooke accepted an exciting op-
portunity with a leading defense company. 
While I am disappointed that she will no 
longer be on our staff, I am looking forward to 
seeing the great impact she has in shaping 
how industry can successfully partner with the 
Department of Defense. 
Over the years, I have come to know 
Brooke as an honest broker and a friend. My

IN RECOGNITION OF COMMANDER 
FRANCIS T. WILLIAMS 
HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 28, 2022 
Mr. KEATING. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the life of Commander Francis T. 
Williams, as the bridge over Scorton Creek in 
East Sandwich, Massachusetts, is renamed 
the Commander Francis T. Williams and 
Sandwich Veterans Memorial Bridge. 
Commander Williams was a highly deco-
rated Naval Officer with a decades-long career 
of service. He served honorably as an U.S. 
Marine from 1969 through 1975 and was de-
ployed to Vietnam. Commander Williams was 
commissioned as a Naval Lieutenant in 1994 
and was stationed throughout his career in 
Connecticut, Fort Dietrich Maryland, the Na-
tional Naval Medical Center, New Hampshire, 
Italy, and coordinated medical logistics on the 
USNS Comfort. Commander Williams was de-
ployed to Iraq and served two tours in Afghan-
istan. His degrees in Pharmacy, Epidemiology, 
and National Security and Strategy Studies 
helped him train the Afghan National Army 
and lead the evacuation of critically wounded 
personnel. 
Commander Williams passed away on Feb-
ruary 25, 2013, after a battle with brain cancer 
and a stroke while on active duty in Afghani-
stan. It is an honor to again recognize Com-
mander Williams’ service to his country as the 
bridge over Scorton Creek in East Sandwich is 
renamed the Commander Francis T. Williams 
and Sandwich Veterans Memorial Bridge. 
This bridge is of particular significance to 
Commander Williams’ family as he caught the 
biggest bass of his life in its shadow. Com-
mander Williams spent much time in the area 
fishing, canoeing, and being outdoors. The 
bridge also honors all Veterans from the town 
for service to their country. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to honor the 
life and distinguished career of U.S. Navy 
Commander Francis T. Williams and all Vet-
erans from Sandwich, Massachusetts, who are 
memorialized by the Commander Francis T. 
Williams and Sandwich Veterans Memorial 
Bridge. I ask that my colleagues join me in 
honoring these brave men and women.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
HONORABLE 
DANIEL A. MANION ON HIS 80TH 
BIRTHDAY 
HON. JACKIE WALORSKI 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 28, 2022 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the Honorable Daniel A. 
Manion as he celebrates his 80th birthday. A 
lifelong Hoosier, Judge Manion has devoted 
his life to serving our community and our great 
nation. 
Judge Manion has deep roots in northern 
Indiana and has played an important part in 
our region’s history. He was born on February 
1, 1942, in South Bend to his parents, Clar-
ence and Virginia Manion. Judge Manion 
graduated from Culver Military Academy in 
1960. At Culver, he participated with the Black 
Horse Troop in the Inaugural Parade for Presi-
dent Dwight Eisenhower in 1957. 
Judge Manion matriculated to the University 
of Notre Dame in 1960, where he was a mem-
ber of the University’s ROTC. During his sen-
ior year, he served as Brigade Commander 
and received the Father John J. Cavanaugh 
Award. At Notre Dame, Judge Manion was a 
member of the wrestling and lacrosse teams. 
He was also a three-time champion of the an-
nual Bengal Bouts boxing tournament. Judge 
Manion graduated from the University of Notre 
Dame in 1964 with a degree in Political 
Science. 
Following college graduation, he was a 
Lieutenant in the United States Army from 
1965 to 1966, serving a tour of duty in Viet-
nam. Later, Judge Manion served as the Di-
rector of Industrial Development for the Indi-
ana Department of Commerce from 1969– 
1973 and earned a Doctor of Jurisprudence 
degree from Indiana University in 1973. He 
then served as Indiana’s Deputy Attorney 
General from 1973 to 1974. 
In 1978, Judge Manion was elected to the 
Indiana Senate, where he served until 1982. 
An avid runner, he earned a reputation for jog-
ging door to door across his district to meet 
Hoosiers. 
Judge Manion practiced law at Doran, 
Manion, Boynton, Kamm & Esmont from 1974 
to 1986, when he was nominated by President 
Ronald Reagan to serve as a circuit judge on 
the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. He was 
confirmed in November 1986 and served as 
an active judge until December 2007 when he 
took senior status. He still serves in this ca-
pacity, regularly hearing appeals. 
During his tenure on the Seventh Circuit 
Court of Appeals, Judge Manion has authored 
numerous 
opinions. 
Additionally, 
he 
has 
mentored 65 law clerks, several of whom have 
gone on to become judges. Most notably, 
Judge Manion is the only currently sitting 
Judge on the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals 
to have one of his former law clerks as a col-
league—the Honorable Judge Michael B. 
Brennan. After taking senior status, Judge 
Manion also was succeeded as an active 
judge on the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals 
by the Honorable Supreme Court Justice Amy 
Coney Barrett. 
Judge Manion is married to his wife, Ann, 
who serves as President of the Women’s Care 
Center. He has four children; Mary (husband, 
Tom), Katherine (husband, Joey), Patrick, and 
Michael; two grandchildren and two more on 
the way. Madam Speaker, I would like to con-
gratulate the Honorable Daniel A. Manion and 
his entire family on this momentous occasion 
of his 80th birthday.

HON. JOHN JOYCE

Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Jamie Stumph as 
the recipient of the Blair County Chamber’s 
prestigious Joseph P. Rosenhamer Chamber 
Spirit Award. 
This award was created to honor Joseph 
Rosenhamer, a longtime Chamber Member 
who served with the most ideal traits of a 
businessperson—with altruism, integrity, and 
selflessness. Mr. Rosenhamer’s wisdom re-
garding the effectiveness of teamwork is rec-
ognized through the award’s recipients, par-
ticularly through Jamie. Her dedication to the 
Young Entrepreneurs Academy has spanned 
over six years, and she has remained an ac-
tive member of various other forums and 
councils. 
On behalf of the people of the 13th Con-
gressional District, I am grateful to the Blair

fosters community growth and success, and

forts.

IN RECOGNITION OF SANDRA 
‘‘SANDY’’ DENTY 
HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 28, 2022 
Mr. KEATING. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in recognition of the career of Sandra ‘‘Sandy’’ 
Denty, a beloved sixth grade Science teacher 
at Furnace Brook Middle School in Marshfield, 
Massachusetts. After thirty-seven years dedi-
cated to her students and her community, 
Sandy is celebrating a well-deserved retire-
ment. 
Sandy has lived in Marshfield for her entire 
life, where she and her family have been an 
integral part of the community. Her grand-
parents founded Marshfield’s first grocery 
store, now the Brant Rock Market. Her father, 
Fred Parziale, owned barber shops around 
town and her mom, Dotti Parziale, managed 
the popular local restaurant Casabrini. Sandy 
and her husband, Bill, have raised two chil-
dren. Kali and Billy, with the same values with 
which they were brought up. 
Sandy graduated from Marshfield High 
School in 1978 and began substitute teaching 
with Marshfield Public Schools shortly after re-
ceiving her bachelor’s degree. She made an 
immediate impact on the school community, 
and when a middle school science teacher po-
sition became available, she jumped at the op-
portunity. 
As a sixth-grade science teacher, Sandy 
has a unique way of connecting with each 
child on an individual, personal level; through 
everything she says and everything she does. 
Sandy’s greatest talent is making others feel 
special. 
Sandy’s 
impact 
on 
Marshfield 
Public 
Schools reaches beyond the students in her 
classroom. She is endlessly supportive of her 
colleagues, running various staff-wide com-
petitions, sporting events and festive programs

every year. She donates her free time to mak-
ing banners for Furnace Brook’s ‘‘One Book 
One School’’ program. Sandy has run count-
less fundraisers, talent shows, and other com-
munity-building activities. In 1999, she found-
ed the ‘‘Denty Connection’’, a private business 
that has helped many teachers get re-certified 
and receive graduate credits. 
Sandy Denty’s selfless career as a teacher 
in Marshfield Public Schools has come to an 
end after thirty-seven years, but her impact 
has spanned multiple generations of students 
and will never be forgotten. Madam Speaker, 
I ask that my colleagues join me in congratu-
lating Sandy Denty on her retirement and rec-
ognizing her for her outstanding service to the 
Town of Marshfield and the Commonwealth of 
Massachusetts.

IN RECOGNITION OF CAPTAIN 
MARK BERGSTROM 
HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 28, 2022 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the exemplary work of 
Captain Mark Bergstrom as he retires after a 
life of service in the United States Marine 
Corps and as a Police Officer at the University 
of North Texas in Denton, Texas. During his 
over 30 years of service to our nation and the 
University of North Texas Police Department, 
he has been a committed leader in his com-
munity. 
Mark started his life of service in the Marine 
Corps in 1987. He served as Battalion Com-
munications Chief Billet in the 2nd Battalion 
14th Marine Regiment. He received numerous 
awards while serving including the Combat 
Action Ribbon, National Defense Service 
Medal, Marine Corps Expeditionary Medal, 
and Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal. He 
received an honorable discharge in 1993. 
While completing college classes, Captain 
Bergstrom joined the UNT Police Department 
in 1994 as a part-time Community Service Of-
ficer. In 1996, he graduated from UNT with a 
Bachelor of Business Administration in Stra-
tegic Management and was hired full-time as 
a police officer. During his career, Captain 
Bergstrom has worked and served as a super-
visor in every UNT Police Department division. 
He earned his Master Peace Officer License 
in 2006. 
Throughout his career at the UNT Police 
Department, he bas been recognized numer-
ous times for outstanding service. His awards 
include Police Commendation, Supervisor of 
the Year, UNT Staff Contribution Award, and 
most notably, a Lifesaving Award. 
On the morning of September 28, 2015, 
Captain Bergstrom saved a young lady in 
mental distress from being struck on I-35. He 
observed her wandering back and forth across 
the multi-lane highway narrowly missing being 
hit several times. Several vehicles had to take 
evasive action at high rates of speed to avoid 
striking her. Thanks to Mark’s quick effective 
response, he was able to detain her safely 
and remove her from the roadway with no in-
juries or accidents. 
Captain Bergstrom has devoted over 35 
years to serving and protecting his country 
and community. For more than three decades, 
he has put strangers’ safety above his own, 
and we are indebted to him. I am deeply 
grateful for his service to our nation and com-
munity, and I wish Captain Bergstrom and his 
family the best in his retirement.

0F 
THE 
YEAR ELIZABETH KANAGAWA 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 28, 2022 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Mrs. Elizabeth ‘‘Betsy’’ 
Kanagawa of Brownstown Charter Township, 
Michigan, on being named the 2021 Michigan 
School Counselor of the Year by the Michigan 
School Counselor Association. Her significant 
contributions to our community are worthy of 
commendation. 
Mrs. Kanagawa is a two-time graduate of 
Spring Arbor University, where she studied 
counseling, English, psychology, and sec-
ondary education. She has been a school 
counselor for over nine years and works at 
Patrick 
Henry 
Middle 
School 
in 
the 
Woodhaven-Brownstown School District. 
Known for her caring personality and inno-
vative programs, Mrs. Kanagawa has changed 
her school for the better. When she noticed 
that students of color were getting lower PSAT 
scores and were at risk of being referred to 
the office at a high rate, she got to the root of 
the problem by taking the time to have impor-
tant, sometimes difficult conversations with 
teachers and administrators and provided the 
interventions needed to support these stu-
dents 
rather 
than 
discipline 
them. 
Mrs. 
Kanagawa has pioneered a program called 
‘‘Minute Meetings’’ where she meets with 
every single student to talk about their mental 
health and determine how to better serve 
them. 
With her extensive work in community inter-
vention and mental health, Mrs. Kanagawa led 
the creation of the Mental Health Advisory 
Board which has brought together school offi-
cials and community health leaders to elimi-
nate barriers that exist in connecting students 
to mental health services. She serves as a 
member of American School Counselor Asso-
ciation and the Michigan School Counselor 
Association, where she is on the governing 
board serving as the middle school level rep-
resentative. She resides in Brownstown with 
her husband, Niko. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me 
in 
honoring 
Mrs. 
Elizabeth 
‘‘Betsy’’ 
Kanagawa. I join with Mrs. Kanagawa’s stu-
dents and colleagues in thanking her for her 
stellar service to Patrick Henry Middle School 
and to our entire community. She has consist-
ently gone above and beyond on behalf of her 
students and has tirelessly dedicated herself 
to making our schools a better place for all. 
We are very lucky to have her in our district 
and wish her the very best in the years to 
come. 
IN RECOGNITION OF LILLIAN 
VACCARELLO 
HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 28, 2022 
Mr. KEATING. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Cape Cod resident, Lillian Vaccarello, 
as she celebrates her 100th birthday on July 
13, 2021. 
Lillian was born on July 13, 1921 in Con-
cord, Massachusetts. She was a talented ath-
lete, playing on her high school’s field hockey 
team, she was even voted by her classmates 
as ‘‘most athletic.’’ Not long after, Lillian mar-
ried her husband, Vincent Vaccarello, in 1939. 
They moved to Waltham, first to a triple deck-
er surrounded by Vinny’s family, until eventu-
ally purchasing a home of their own in the 
Warrendale neighborhood of Waltham. There, 
the couple would raise their four children, 
Janet, Diane, Skip, and Rick. Lillian worked 
various jobs to help support her family includ-
ing working evenings at the Waltham Watch 
Company and as a station wagon driver for 
the Green Acres Nursery School. She would 
later become a teacher at the school while at-
tending night classes. Lillian later joined the 
school’s administration before retiring after 21 
years. 
Throughout her life, Lillian was a well-known 
community volunteer. Lillian was a Girl Scout 
Leader and a member of her community’s 
Women’s 
Club. 
She 
helped 
found 
the 
Warrendale Little League and was head of the 
Women’s Auxiliary. Lillian has also dedicated 
her time to volunteering with nursing homes, 
Meals on Wheels, the garden club, and a local 
church organization that delivers meals to 
those in need. Lillian also loved to organize 
neighborhood activities to bring families and 
children together. 
Lillian has lived a full and adventurous life. 
She performed on the Jay Leno Show with her 
tambourine group, the Concord Shakers. She 
took a hot balloon ride for her 80th birthday 
and a bi-plane tour over Cape Cod for her 
93rd. In her now 100 years of life, Lillian’s joy 
and dedication to helping others continues to 
be a constant presence in her new community 
of Cape Cod Senior Residency. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues 
join me in wishing Lillian Vaccarello a very 
happy 100th birthday. I wish her continued 
health and happiness in this next year of her 
life.

HONORING THE LIFE OF MICHAEL 
R. SALA 
HON. AUMUA AMATA COLEMAN 
RADEWAGEN 
OF AMERICAN SAMOA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 28, 2022 
Mrs. RADEWAGEN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in remembrance of the late Michael 
Ryner Sala. Michael was a native son of the 
Territory of American Samoa, born on Sep-
tember 29, 1944, in the small village of Avaio 
in the far eastern district of the main island of 
Tutuila, American Samoa. His mother, Malia 
Elisapeta Silivelio Pa‘utalo Sala Fata Eneliko 
Siligawas a woman of proud Samoan heritage, 
and his father, Raymond Ryner Howard, a 
Marine Platoon Sergeant in the United States 
Marine Corps, whose barracks were situated 
in the next village during WW2. 
He attended Faga‘itua Elementary School 
and then Poyer High School, now known as 
Samoana High School. He graduated in June 
1964 and received a scholarship to pursue 
medical training in Fiji. His life took a turn 
when, during the process of preparing to leave 
the island, he visited the police department in 
Fagatogo. He ran into a family member, Lt. 
Vilima‘a Leiato, who offered him a position as 
a police officer—right there on the spot. 
After consulting with his mother, he decided 
to accept the position and thus began his long 
and distinguished career in law enforcement. 
He went on to attend the Honolulu Police 
Academy and later the California Highway Pa-
trol Academy. At 22, he was the youngest offi-
cer ever promoted to Sergeant; at 24 the 
youngest ever promoted to Lieutenant. 
At the age of 28, the High Chief Title 
‘‘Tualamasala’’ was bestowed upon Mike. 
Matai titles are only given to select family 
members with the approval of the senior matai 
or high chief and members of the extended 
family. 
In 1973, at the age of 29, he began working 
as a Special Investigator for the Multnomah 
County District Attorney’s Office in Portland, 
Oregon, and in 1975 became a Multnomah 
County Sheriff. He graduated from Portland 
State University in March 1977 with a bach-
elor’s degree in Administration of Justice. In 
1978, he graduated from the University of 
Portland with a master’s degree in Criminal 
Justice Administration. He was a candidate for 
a second master’s degree in Public Adminis-
tration and a candidate for a doctoral degree 
in Criminology. 
He returned home to American Samoa in 
1978 where he served as Deputy Commis-
sioner of Public Safety for 20 years. He 
served for 15 years as the Director of Intel-
ligence for the South Pacific Islands Criminal 
Intelligence Network (SPICIN), the intelligence 
arm of the South Pacific Chiefs of Police Con-
ference (SPCPC) organization which is com-
prised of 21 countries in the Pacific, including 
Australia and New Zealand, until 2003 when 
SPICIN was reorganized as part of the re-
gions’ information sharing and intelligence in-
frastructure solely administered by the Amer-
ican Samoa Government. 
In September 1996, the Office of Territorial 
and International and Criminal Intelligence and 
Drug Enforcement (OTICIDE) separated from 
the Department of Public Safety and created 
as an independent law enforcement agency 
(Task Force). As director of OTICIDE, Mike 
was also a director of the INTERPOL Pacific 
Sub-Bureau comprised of Guam, Saipan, and 
American Samoa as Communications Control 
Center (CCC), under the United States De-
partment of Justice, National Central Bureau 
in Washington, D.C. 
In February 2007, he was appointed the first 
Director of the American Samoa Department 
of Homeland Security, ASDHS. He retired on 
January 3, 2013, after 50 years of law en-
forcement and public safety experience in 
American Samoa and the US mainland. 
He was a lifetime member of the Inter-
national Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) 
and served as Chairman of the SPCPC from 
1994–1995. He was Chairman of the Amer-
ican Samoa Government (ASG) Interagency 
Special Task Force on Narcotics and White- 
Collar Crime Enforcement for nine years. He 
directed a Bureau of Special Investigations 
within the Department of Public Safety. He 
was Chairman of the Preparedness Task 
Force on Terrorism in American Samoa, later 
renamed the Homeland Security Advisory 
Council (HSAC). He served as Vice Chairman 
of the eleven-member Governor’s Council on 
Alcohol and Drug Abuse, as well as Chairman 
of the ASG Personnel Advisory Board. He pre-
sented at numerous law enforcement con-
ferences regionally and internationally, includ-
ing the IACP, Asia-Pacific Center for Security 
Studies (APCSS), South Pacific Chiefs of Po-
lice, SPICIN and INTERPOL. 
In addition to his long record of government 
service, Mike served his community. He was 
an active lifetime member and Charter Presi-
dent of the Lions Club in American Samoa. He 
joined the Boy Scouts of American Samoa in 
1964 and was an active member of the Boy 
Scouts of America, American Samoa District 
Committee under the Aloha Counsel of Hono-
lulu where he served as chairman for 17 
years. 
Mike was a tireless promoter of the highest 
ideals; he believed in friendship above all and 
was a true friend to countless people. His gen-
erosity of spirit and heart was legendary; he 
often helped people quietly when they needed 
it most and did not count the cost or want rec-
ognition for his many good deeds. He was 
fiercely loyal to his Lions Club brothers and 
sisters, where he encouraged and promoted 
many of them, especially his Lion sisters, to 
lead the organization after him. He was also 
tireless in promoting women in the workplace 
and mentored many worthy candidates in his 
years at Public Safety and Homeland Security. 
Although he was extremely proud of his 
government service and accomplishments, he 
was most proud of his work with the Lions 
Club. Mike led the club as Charter President 
and then as club president four more times. 
He guided them in numerous community 
projects, including collaboration with the LBJ 
Medical Center, Department of Health, Feleti 
Barstow Library, and other government agen-
cies to conduct vision screening clinics for 
residents, including outreach visits to the is-
lands of Manu‘a. Teams of doctors, nurses 
and technicians have been hosted by the 
Lions to work with the local club, where they 
offered vision screening, eye surgery and 
medicine to the Samoan community, free of 
charge. 
Mike truly believed that in order to be a 
good citizen, one must give to their commu-
nity. 
He lived his life serving his island commu-
nity, his village, and his people. 
He took his final breath on the morning of 
January 17, 2022. He is survived by his chil-
dren, Jennifer Rebecca Sala Jones and Mat-
thew Michael Sala, and his grandchildren: 
Olivia, Malia, and Betty Merlea.

HONORING WORLD WAR II VET-
ERAN 
AND 
LEGENDARY 
RE-
PORTER MORTON A. MINTZ 
HON. JAMIE RASKIN 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 28, 2022 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Mr. Morton Abner Mintz, a World 
War II veteran and legendary investigative re-
porter who turned 100 years old this week. 
And what a century it has been for this great 
and modest man of exceptional gifts. 
Born January 26, 1922, in Ann Arbor, Michi-
gan, Mr. Mintz enlisted in the Navy after grad-
uating from the University of Michigan. He 
served as Communications Officer and then 
Commanding Officer in World War II on USS 
LST 505, which supported troops in the D-Day 
Invasion of Normandy from June 6 to June 25, 
1944; the Invasion of Southern France from 
August 15 to September 25, 1944; and in the 
Pacific Theater during the assault and occupa-
tion of Okinawa from May 29 to June 10, 
1945, and subsequently in China. 
Married for 68 years to the lovely Anita Inez 
Franz until she passed away in 2015, he has 
two daughters, Margaret and Roberta, and a 
son Daniel, 10 grandchildren and a great- 
grandson. Following his service in the Navy, 
Mr. Mintz became a newspaper reporter and 
editor in St. Louis, then moved to Washington, 
D.C. to work at the Washington Post in 1958. 
He was to become one of America’s most 
independent, highly respected, and public-in-
terested reporters. For decades he was a first- 
class investigative journalist and peerless 
muckraker. 
Widely recognized by his peers for his re-
lentless focus on protecting the public against 
both corporate and governmental abuses of 
power, the prodigious Mr. Mintz covered a 
wide range of topics, including anticompetitive 
business practices, automobile safety, air pol-
lution, the tobacco, pharmaceutical and med-
ical device industries, waste and fraud in mili-
tary contracting, the corrupting power of the 
campaign finance regime and the corrosive in-
fluence of lobbying and large corporate dona-
tions on elected officials. He knew much could 
be learned from covering seemingly obscure 
congressional hearings and reading the fine 
print in legislation and administrative rule-
making processes. 
Mr. Mintz’ dogged investigative work repeat-
edly exposed corporate actions undertaken to

increase profit at the expense of consumer 
safety, leading to significant government regu-
lations that curbed corporate misconduct and 
saved lives. 
In 1962, he broke the story of how FDA sci-
entist Frances Kelsey had discovered the dan-
gers of the drug Thalidomide, which led to the 
last-minute banning of the drug from entering 
the US market and likely avoiding thousands 
of horrifying birth defects as were experienced 
in Europe. In the late 1960s, Mr. Mintz chron-
icled the inadequate testing of the original 
birth control pills and, years later, tracked the 
story of how a pharmaceutical corporation will-
fully ignored the safety hazards of the contra-
ceptive Dalkon Shield, causing serious injury 
to thousands of women. He broke the extraor-
dinary story of General Motors’ corporate sur-
veillance of Ralph Nader, the automaker’s big-
gest public critic. He wrote about how profit 
driven decisions in the infant formula business 
led to great harm in impoverished populations 
with limited access to safe drinking water. And 
he reckoned with difficult and indigestible 
truths, such as in a 1983 exclusive interview 
with Assistant Secretary of War John J. 
McCloy, who had served in the Roosevelt ad-
ministration, where he revealed some of the 
story behind the refusal of the United States 
during World War II to bomb the rail lines 
transporting Holocaust victims to the Birkenau 
or the Auschwitz concentration camps. 
Following his retirement from the Wash-
ington Post in 1988, Mr. Mintz continued his 
work as a journalist and media critic. In 1993, 
he exposed the failure of the American Civil 
Liberties Union to inform its members that it 
accepted money from the tobacco industry 
and, under the guise of defending free 
speech, also actively opposed legislation that 
would ban or limit tobacco advertising and 
promotion. In 1999, he wrote media criticism 
for Tompaine.com. ‘‘Mort Wants to Know,’’ 
and posed questions that the press should be 
asking of presidential and congressional can-
didates in the 2000 national elections. A Sen-
ior Advisor to the Nieman Watchdog Project 
for many years, he also contributed com-
mentary to niemanwatchdog.org on vital topics 
including military spending, congressional eth-
ics and oversight, single payer health insur-
ance, pharmaceutical pricing, executive pay, 
corporate welfare and the corporate shield that 
protects executives from punishment for their 
decisions to market products known to be 
harmful, as well as tough questions that re-
porters should be asking legislators and cor-
porate executives. He served as chair of The 
Fund for Investigative Journalism for three 
years and on the board of Project on Govern-
ment Oversight (POGO). 
Mr. Mintz was an active member of the 
Washington-Baltimore News Guild. His best-
selling book ‘‘America, Inc.: Who Owns and 
Operates the United States,’’ written with the 
late Jerry S. Cohen, demonstrated the perva-
sive and often hidden influence of corporate 
power. Mintz and Cohen later co-wrote 
‘‘Power, Inc.: Public and Private Rulers and 
How to Make Them Accountable,’’ continuing 
their investigation of the pernicious impact of 
unaccountable power in the interlocking cor-
porate and government realms. Mr. Mintz’s 
other books include ‘‘The Therapeutic Night-
mare,’’ ‘‘By Prescription Only,’’ ‘‘The Pill: An 
Alarming Report’’ and ‘‘At Any Cost: Corporate 
Greed, Women, and the Dalkon Shield.’’ He 
received many prestigious journalism awards 
including Nieman Fellowship 1964, the Worth 
Bingham, Heywood Broun, Raymond Clapper 
and George Polk Memorial Awards, the Co-
lumbia Journalism Award, The Playboy Foun-
dation’s Hugh M. Hefner First Amendment 
Award for Lifetime Achievement, (More) Maga-
zine’s A.J. Liebling Award, the Washington- 
Baltimore Newspaper Guild award for Public 
Service and for Distinguished Writing and the 
Association of Trial Lawyers of America Spe-
cial Literary-Public Service Award. 
I have known Morton Mintz since the sev-
enth grade when his son Daniel became one 
of my closest friends. As kids, we all marveled 
at Mr. Mintz, an old-fashioned gentleman with 
a golden pen, rock-ribbed integrity and spar-
kling intelligence. 
I commend Mr. Mintz for his splendid com-
mitment and service to the public interest al-
ways—whether the subject be consumer safe-
ty, corporate and government accountability, 
or the truth about humanity’s wars—through 
his many decades of extraordinary investiga-
tive reporting, I am proud to share a small 
piece of his story with my colleagues and the 
nation. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in recognizing Mr. Morton Mintz on the 
occasion of his 100th birthday for his excep-
tional service to our nation, both as a patriot 
in uniform and as a crusading investigative re-
porter in love with the truth.

HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF 
PASTOR LEON JONES 
HON. JEFF DUNCAN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 28, 2022 
Mr. DUNCAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor a great friend, Pastor Leon Jones of 
First Baptist Church of Ware Shoals in Ware 
Shoals, SC, on his retirement. During his 
nearly twenty-five years of service, Pastor 
Jones has been a spiritual leader of the com-
munity and continues to put others before him-
self. 
Ware Shoals First Baptist Church was 
founded in 1908 and has seen sixteen pastors 
in its time. Pastor Jones will retire as the long-
est serving pastor of the church, with nearly 
twenty-five years of service to the church and 
the community. His ministry came to Ware 
Shoals First Baptist Church in 1997, and I, 
along with many others in the Third District of 
South Carolina, have been personally im-
pacted by his message of faith. 
When I think of Pastor Jones, I am re-
minded of Jeremiah 3:15: ‘‘Then I will give you 
shepherds after my own heart, who will lead 
you with knowledge and understanding.’’ Pas-
tor Jones is a shepherd and teacher in his 
community, and his compassion and love for 
others has been exemplified through his serv-
ice to Ware Shoals First Baptist Church. 
After his retirement, Pastor Jones will settle 
in Elgin, SC, with his wife. There is no doubt 
in my mind that he will continue to be a leader 
in ministry and change the lives of everyone 
he meets. His unconditional love for others re-
flects the Lord in every way. I am grateful to 
call Pastor Jones my friend and to have at-
tended First Baptist Church of Ware Shoals 
while he served. 
Madam Speaker, it is an honor to serve the 
Third District of South Carolina and to honor 
those, like Pastor Jones, who have made an 
immeasurable impact on communities, like 
Ware Shoals, SC, in faith.

HONORING THE LIFE OF ANTHONY 
DIPACE 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 28, 2022 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today and ask the House to observe the pass-
ing of a true gentleman and public-spirited cit-
izen of the State of Connecticut, Mr. Anthony 
‘‘Tony’’ DiPace. After a courageous battle with 
cancer, Tony unfortunately passed on from 
this earth on January 22, 2022, at the age of 
62. 
Born in Hartford in 1960 to Concetta and 
Angela DiPace, Tony was ingrained with the 
Connecticut spirit since birth. It was not long 
after his entry into this world, however, that 
tragedy was forced upon him with the loss of 
his mother, resulting in an early transition into 
the loving Wee and Rose Crowley household 
based in Enfield, Connecticut. Both out of this 
loss and his fostering under the Crowley’s, 
Tony gained an early understanding to the im-
portance of discovering one’s own roots and 
connecting with those who surround us in our 
daily lives. It was therefore without question 
that upon graduating Fermi High School in 
1978, Tony saw the value in keeping close to 
the town that raised him and went on to grad-
uate at the top of his class from United Tech-
nical School in Springfield, Massachusetts just 
a stone’s throw away from Enfield. 
Armed with his certification as a master me-
chanic, Tony quickly became an integral part 
of his hometown, opening his own automotive 
business, ‘‘Hazard Motors.’’ Though he kept 
up with the success of his one-stop-shop for 
more than 34 years in order to build a founda-
tion for his family, he also always put the cus-
tomer-in-need before himself. Beyond the suc-
cess of his business, Tony lived a life in con-
stant search for new connections with his 
neighbors so that, together, they could work to 
create a more prosperous town for the next 
generation, including his son, Anthony. 
It is with no surprise that a caring man like 
Tony found time to wear just about every hat 
in town. Included within his tenured service 
was 40 years with the Enfield Democratic 
Town Committee, where he constantly dis-
cussed and put forward municipal priorities. 
His dedication earned him a several stints in 
both elected and membership positions, in-
cluding his advocacy as the former Chairman 
of the Enfield Planning & Zoning Commission 
as well as his service as the Chair of the 
Democratic Town Committee. Throughout all 
of these efforts, his clear and present passion 
and candid character made him a capable uni-
fying voice in Enfield, which he was most re-
cently recognized for with the William ‘‘Red’’ 
Edger, Jr. ‘‘Democrat of the Year’’ Award in 
2021. 
Tony was also sought to establish a positive 
impact with the town’s youth. Whether it was 
through the local concession stand, as coach 
for youth teams, or his sponsorship of the 
youth basketball and baseball programs, it 
was always Tony’s goal to set up the next 
generation for success, affording them the

same appreciation for the Town which he 
found while growing up. 
Madam Speaker, Tony was purely altruistic, 
always thinking of those around him and how 
he could help them. I had the distinct pleasure 
and honor to know Tony for over 20 years and 
often had a front-row seat to his fine work in 
the auto repair business. He always had his 
sleeves folded up, ready to get into the grease 
and get the job done in order to excel beyond 
the needs of the customer. I also know that he 
was diligent and passionate with his involve-
ment in town affairs and that he poured his 
heart and soul into any activity laid before him. 
Through everything he accomplished, whether 
it was his contributions to the town’s economy, 
through municipal government, or investing in 
youth activities, it is worth emphasizing that it 
was always about leaving behind a stronger 
community for whom Tony considered family. 
Though this perspective was Tony’s guiding 
North Star throughout his entire life, everything 
he did, was in some small way tied to leaving 
Enfield and our State a better place for An-
thony. 
Madam Speaker, though the Enfield com-
munity lost a force for good with the passing 
of Tony DiPace, we will always find the space 
to honor his legacy which now thrives through 
just about every member of the Enfield com-
munity. It is also through the roots of the 
Crowley family that we can entrust Tony’s 
many surviving brothers and sisters—wher-
ever they may reside—to carry his memory 
forward. To that end, it is with great respect 
and admiration that I ask my colleagues in the 
House join me, in addition to all those that will 
remember Tony DiPace, in honoring his life 
and impact on his community. 
IN RECOGNITION OF NICOLE

Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Nicole Zernick as

prestigious Judith A. Rossie Educator of the

reer paths through education and encourage-
ment.

IN RECOGNITION OF ESTHER 
HOPKINS 
HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 28, 2022 
Mr. KEATING. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in recognition of the life of Esther Hopkins, the 
first 
African-American 
Framingham 
Selectwoman, a chemist, an environmental at-
torney, and a mother. 
Esther Hopkins passed away on May 19, 
2021, at the age of 94. Hopkins was born on 
September 
18, 
1926, 
in 
Stamford, 
CT. 
Throughout her life, she broke down barriers, 
surpassed milestones, and led a life full of no-
table accomplishments. Hopkins was highly 
educated, achieving multiple degrees over her 
lifetime. She received her B.A. from Boston 
University, her M.A. and M.S from Howard 
University, her J.D from Suffolk University Law 
School, and her Ph.D. from Yale University. 
Esther was a chemist, environmental attorney, 
and elected public official in Framingham. She 
is remembered for not only those accomplish-
ments but also her consistent respect and 
kindness towards others. 
Following her Ph.D., she was offered a job 
with the Polaroid Corporation where she led 
the Emulsion Coating and Analysis Labora-
tory. Following her time at Polaroid, she joined 
the Massachusetts Department of Environ-
mental Protection as the Deputy General 
Counsel, which eventually led to her time as 
an elected official of Framingham. In 1999, 
she became the first African-American woman 
to serve on the Board of Selectmen in Fra-
mingham, eventually becoming the chair of the 
board. Following her time as a Selectwoman, 
she joined the Keefe Tech Regional Voca-
tional School Committee. Additionally, Esther 
was involved with the Framingham Finance 
Commission and Framingham’s Tercentennial 
Celebration. After quite an impressive life and 
career. Hopkins retired to Martha’s Vineyard 
with son, Ewell Hopkins, Jr. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to honor Es-
ther Hopkins. I ask that my colleagues join me 
in recognizing her accomplishments and her 
life. She will be dearly missed by so many.
