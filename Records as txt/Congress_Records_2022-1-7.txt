FREEDOM TO VOTE ACT 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to speak in 
support of legislation that is critical to 
our democracy, the Freedom to Vote 
Act, which I introduced this year with 
many Senators who worked together 
through the summer to come up with a 
bill that would make a difference for 
our country, with input from secre-
taries of state across our country, elec-
tion experts, in order to give the people 
of this country the right to vote, to 
protect the right to vote, and to make 
sure that they understood that they 
can vote anywhere from any ZIP Code 
in a safe way because right now, sadly, 
that is simply not the case in many 
States in our country. 
If you are in North Carolina right 
now and you want to cast a mail-in 
ballot and you have COVID or you are 
in the hospital, you have to get a no-
tary public to sign off on your ballot. 
If you are in Georgia, and you don’t 
register, you are a new resident there, 
you have moved there from another 
State, and you are in a big election, 
and you think, well, I am going to vote 
in the final place, you are no longer al-
lowed to register in the last month as 
you were in the past during the runoff 
election. 
As we saw in the last election in 2020 
in Houston, in that county—5 million 
people—there was only one drop-off box 
in the entire county; Harris County, 5 
million people, only one drop-off box. 
There are places in States where you 
wait in line, 8, 10 hours in the hot Sun 
just to exercise your right to vote.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S84 
January 7, 2022 
That is why, through the year, we 
worked together with, of course, Lead-
er SCHUMER, who brought us together, 
and 
Senators 
MANCHIN, 
MERKLEY, 
PADILLA, KING, KAINE, TESTER, and 
WARNOCK—different Senators coming 
from different parts of the country 
with different political views on cer-
tain issues, but we came together and 
cosponsored this bill, which is sup-
ported by every Member of the Demo-
cratic caucus. 
I want to thank all of them for their 
ongoing hard work to get the bill 
passed and also to thank Senators 
SCHUMER, DURBIN, KAINE, and MERKLEY 
for joining me on the floor today in 
support of this bill. 
The freedom to vote is fundamental 
to all of our freedoms, which is why we 
called it the Freedom to Vote Act. It 
ensures that people are part of a fran-
chise and that government is account-
able to the people, but, today, this fun-
damental right that is the very founda-
tion of our system of government is 
under attack. 
Since the 2020 election, we have seen 
a persistent and coordinated assault on 
the freedom to vote in States across 
the country. I just used a few examples 
of the laws that have changed, the at-
tempts that have been made in nearly 
every State, with over 400 bills, to 
change those laws. 
But then there have been direct 
threats. Local election officials, many 
secretaries of state have told me that 
they are having trouble now recruiting 
people to run their election-day and 
election-month facilities. Why? Be-
cause there are threats. There have 
been polls and studies that have shown 
that election officials in inordinate 
numbers are the victims of these 
threats. 
One 
Republican 
commissioner 
in 
Philadelphia, 
election 
commissioner 
who recently left his job, they actually 
put his family’s names, young kids’ 
names, a picture of his house, and his 
address on the internet so that people 
can target his very family. 
The emails, the voice messages left, 
the one left for Katie Hobbs, the sec-
retary of state for Arizona: We will 
hunt you down, Katie. We will hunt 
you down. 
These attacks on our local election 
officials and also Members of Congress 
of both parties—a record number 9,600 
in the last year, which is double or tri-
ple what it has ever been. You cannot 
look at the incident of January 6, of 
that insurrection, on its own. These 
threats of violence have continued into 
the year. 
And why is that? Well, we know there 
is this enormous lack of trust right 
now in our election system. We know 
that people have wrongly been told, 
have been given misinformation, have 
been motivated, as we saw, as those 
people marched down the Mall on Jan-
uary 6, to believe that somehow our de-
mocracy and our voting system is a 
fraud. 
Now, we know that is not right be-
cause we hear it from Republican and 
Democratic local officials all the time. 
President Trump’s own Homeland Se-
curity election head, after the last 
election, said it was the most secure in 
the history of America. That was 
President Trump’s appointee. Former 
Attorney General Barr made it very 
clear that there was not widespread 
fraud in the last election of any kind. 
But yet this lie continues, and people, 
sadly, continue to believe it. 
And what is the most sad is that 
elected leaders in States—a number of 
States, not just one or two, multiple 
States—are passing laws with the false 
tenet of fraud and literally taking 
away people’s right to vote, kicking 
them off of voting rolls. 
People who for years have gone to 
one polling location now can’t figure 
out where they are supposed to vote; 
people in Georgia who suddenly have 
been told—after the last election did it 
differently—that they have to write 
their birthday on the outside of an en-
velope. Anyone who is asked to write a 
date on an envelope for a ballot, one 
would assume it is the date that you 
are putting your ballot in the mail. 
But, no, it is your birthday. That is the 
kind of thing we are seeing across the 
country. 
As one court in North Carolina once 
said about previous efforts to suppress 
the law, it is discrimination with sur-
gical precision, State by State by 
State. 
These attacks on our democracy de-
mand a federalist response. Just as we 
saw in the 1960s with civil rights legis-
lation, at some point, the Federal Gov-
ernment had to step in. And, in fact, 
our own Founding Fathers actually an-
ticipated that this might be necessary 
because right in the Constitution, it 
says that Congress can ‘‘make or 
alter’’ the laws regarding Federal elec-
tions—as clear as can be, ‘‘make or 
alter’’ the laws regarding Federal elec-
tions. 
So what we are talking about here 
are some minimum standards in place 
for how you do early voting, for the 
fact that you can register, for the fact 
that you can have drop-off boxes, 
‘‘make or alter’’ the rules for Federal 
elections. 
When you have States, certain States 
messing around to the extent that they 
are, with the clear intent that they 
have, this is the moment that we look 
to the Constitution for guidance, and it 
is right there. 
This is why the need for action could 
not be more serious. This is why, as 
Leader SCHUMER
has announced, we 
will be moving to advance the Freedom 
to Vote Act next week. 
With State legislatures beginning to 
convene for their 2022 legislative ses-
sions this week, with plans to pass 
more bills that will restrict voting and 
with primaries for the 2022 election 
just around the corner, we cannot wait 
another moment. 
Yesterday, we gathered in this Cham-
ber to mark 1 year since the violent 
mob of insurrectionists stormed into 
this Capitol. I can see everything like 
it was in technicolor—when we came 
back into this Chamber, to our desks, 
everyone looking in their desks to see 
if anything had been taken; the videos 
we saw, which only a few hours before 
people had invaded this Chamber; and 
the walk that Senator BLUNT and the 
Vice President and I took through the 
broken glass, spray-painted statues, 
with the young staff members with the 
mahogany boxes containing the last of 
the electoral ballots. 
As I said 2 weeks later at the inau-
guration, this is the moment when our 
democracy brushes itself off, stands 
straight, moves forward, ‘‘one nation 
under God, indivisible, with liberty and 
justice for all.’’ 
You just said that pledge, I say to the 
Presiding Officer, in this very Cham-
ber. The pages said that pledge in this 
very Chamber. To me, those are not 
just empty words; they are a pledge 
that we must keep. 
Election officials, as I noted, across 
the country have been targeted by an 
overwhelming increase in the number 
of threats. We cannot keep that pledge, 
‘‘for liberty and justice for all,’’ and a 
democracy if we can’t have fair elec-
tions and literally people who are just 
doing their jobs, whether in this build-
ing or out in Mississippi or out in 
Pennsylvania or in Arizona, getting 
threatened just for counting votes. We 
actually even heard from the Repub-
lican Kentucky secretary of state re-
cently in a hearing that Senator BLUNT 
and I had about how difficult it is to 
fill those jobs. 
So in light of all of this, let’s talk 
some basics about what the Freedom to 
Vote Act does. 
It strengthens protections for elec-
tion workers by making it a Federal 
crime to ‘‘intimidate, threaten, or co-
erce’’ election workers. It protects 
election officials from improper re-
moval by partisan actors. It puts a 
standard in place. So you can’t just 
throw them out because you don’t like 
what the results were, what their votes 
were that they counted; it establishes a 
statutory right to vote, to have their 
votes counted; and it protects against 
sham audits, like the one we saw in Ar-
izona and the ones being advanced in 
Wisconsin, Michigan, Texas, and Penn-
sylvania. 
It is worth noting that even though 
these so-called audits aren’t using reli-
able methods in Arizona, that sham 
audit actually found President Biden 
had a larger margin of victory, and the 
first round of findings in Texas found 
nothing that could have changed the 
outcome in the election. 
A few weeks ago, we gathered for the 
funeral of a great man who served 
many years in this Chamber, Senator 
Dole. President Biden reminded us of 
something he had once said when the 
debates in this Chamber—when there 
were actual debates—were raging about 
civil rights legislation. Bob Dole said 
this: 
No first-class democracy can treat people 
like second-class citizens.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S85 
January 7, 2022 
‘‘No first-class democracy can treat 
people like second-class citizens.’’ 
We are a first-class democracy. Yet, 
as I know, 19 States have passed 34 bills 
that include provisions to restrict vot-
ing, and State legislatures are looking 
at even more. The need for Federal ac-
tion is urgent. 
But as we have seen in States like 
Georgia, Florida, Iowa, Montana, and 
Texas, we are up against a coordinated 
attack aimed at limiting the freedom 
to vote. Examples—I have used a few 
already, and I am going to keep using 
them throughout the weeks ahead. 
The new law in Georgia shortens run-
offs by 5 weeks and prevents new voters 
from registering to vote during runoff 
elections. 
In Iowa, a new law cut the days of 
early voting by 9 days and closes the 
polls an hour early. That was after the 
State, in the words of its own Repub-
lican secretary of state, shattered its 
voter turnout record last year. If that 
shattered the voter turnout record, 
Senator KAINE, to have an hour extra, 
why would you then take the hour 
away? 
A new law in Montana says you can 
no longer register to vote on election 
day. Yet that same-day registration—I 
know because my State is proud of our 
same-day registration, and we have the 
highest voter turnout in the country in 
nearly every single election—for 15 
years that was in place in Montana—15 
years. Don’t tell me it was some new 
thing that they weren’t used to—15 
years. And as part of this coordinated 
national attack on voting, they took it 
away. 
In 2020, the Texas Governor, as I 
noted, also limited counties, including 
Harris County, which has as many peo-
ple as nearly my entire State, to that 
one ballot dropoff box. 
We cannot hold free and fair elec-
tions with laws and procedures like 
these. And, yes, there is the issue—the 
horrendous issue—of messing around 
with how the votes are counted and 
getting rid of the nonpartisan boards 
and allowing partisan legislatures to 
count and sham audits. 
All of that is covered by our bill, and 
it is a big problem. But if you rig the 
elections before the votes are even 
counted by making it impossible for 
certain people to vote—in the words of 
our 
great 
colleague 
Reverend 
WARNOCK, ‘‘Some people don’t want 
some people to vote’’—does it even 
matter if you count them if they are 
not allowed to vote in the first place? 
That is why Americans need the 
Freedom to Vote Act, which builds on 
the framework put forward by my col-
league and former West Virginia sec-
retary of state Senator MANCHIN last 
summer. As I note, it reflected the 
work—hard work—of many, many Sen-
ators, including ones in this room 
today: the Senator from Oregon, Sen-
ator MERKLEY; the Senator from Vir-
ginia, Senator KAINE. 
We can’t just sit back and allow for 5 
weeks to be cut from the Georgia run-
off period—during which over 1.3 mil-
lion people voted in 2021—or allow for 
people to be prevented from registering 
to vote for runoff elections when near-
ly 70,000 Georgians registered to vote 
during that time. 
Protecting elections against subver-
sion also won’t bring back same-day 
registration on election day in Mon-
tana unless we do the work from the 
beginning, which nearly 8,200 Mon-
tanans used in 2020 to register or up-
date their registration. That is a lot of 
people in Montana. 
It won’t ensure that over 16 million 
registered voters in Texas have access 
to drop boxes. It simply is not enough 
to just focus on counting the votes if 
you want to protect things that matter 
to people. 
The best of the best is what the 
American people want. They want to 
be able to vote in the safest way pos-
sible that works for them. One poll 
found that 78 percent of Americans, in-
cluding 63 percent of Republicans—this 
is from April 2021, Pew—support mak-
ing early in-person voting available for 
at least 2 weeks before election day. 
That is exactly what this bill does. 
Sixty-eight percent of Americans, in-
cluding 59 percent of Republicans, sup-
port making election day a national 
holiday—Pew poll, April 2021. That is 
what this bill does. 
Sixty-one percent of Americans sup-
port automatic voter registration— 
Pew, April 2021. That is what this bill 
does. If you go in and get your driver’s 
license—huh?—why would you have to 
then, when the State has all of your in-
formation, have to go in and register 
again? 
So while Senate Republicans claim 
that this bill isn’t popular, there are 
people in their own party, time and 
time again, who have supported these 
provisions. 
How about, for instance, Utah, where 
nearly the entire State has mail-in bal-
loting, but yet in other States—like I 
just mentioned in North Carolina—you 
can’t cast your mail-in ballot without 
getting a notary public? 
That is why the Constitution says 
that, for Federal elections, Congress 
can make or alter the rules regarding 
Federal elections. 
For decades, we know voting rights 
has been a bipartisan issue. In 2006, the 
Voting Rights Act—I know Senator 
DURBIN, the author of this bill, has 
worked so hard on this—was reauthor-
ized. The Voting Rights Act was reau-
thorized by a vote of 98 to 0. But right 
now, when we look at changes to the 
Voting Rights Act in response to a 
court case out of the Supreme Court, it 
is so necessary to update that bill right 
now. Only one Republican, Senator 
MURKOWSKI of Alaska, voted to even 
advance that bill to allow for debate. 
Only one was willing to debate it. 
Let’s be clear. When article I, section 
4 of the Constitution empowers Con-
gress to make or alter rules for Federal 
elections at any time—at any time—I 
believe it is in there for a reason. I 
don’t think they just put that in there 
for, ‘‘Oh, let’s just throw this in,’’ in 
the very few words of a Constitution 
for the greatest democracy the world 
has ever known. No, it was in there for 
a reason. This is the reason. 
We get to one more thing—and then 
I will turn it over to my colleagues— 
and that is the need to look at the Sen-
ate rules for voting. So I would argue 
that maybe for the people of this coun-
try—the hundreds of millions of people 
of this country—their voting rules 
might be just a little, tiny bit more im-
portant than our voting rules in this 
Chamber. 
But, 
nevertheless, 
acknowledging 
that, our voting rules have changed 
many, many times. Since the begin-
ning of the Senate, the rules governing 
debate have changed, as I said, mul-
tiple times. Throughout history, there 
have been over 160 exceptions to the 60- 
vote cloture threshold, including nomi-
nees, reconciliation, and disapproval of 
arms sales. Even the number of votes 
needed to end debate has changed. 
I am very interested in making this 
place work. I don’t think people would 
spend all this time getting elected just 
to come here and stop bills from hap-
pening and then go home, but that is 
pretty much what is going on right 
now in this Chamber. 
I look at those pages. I think about 
that they came here to watch these 
grand debates in what is supposed to be 
the greatest deliberative body of all 
time, and instead we basically have an 
empty room. 
This is the moment to protect voting 
rights. And yes, we acknowledge that 
to do it—because, sadly, we don’t have 
the bipartisan support that we have 
had in the past for voting rights and 
for protecting people’s rights—we have 
to do it this way. And there is nothing 
magical about the rules as they are 
now. If there were, there wouldn’t be 
160 exceptions and they wouldn’t have 
been changed multiple times. 
I will end with this. Protecting the 
freedom to vote has never been easy. 
Throughout our country’s 245-year his-
tory, we have had to course-correct to 
ensure that our democracy—for the 
people, by the people—always lived up 
to our ideals. 
Last year, when speaking in Phila-
delphia, President Biden called the 
fight to protect voting rights the test 
of our time. We owe it to ourselves and 
future generations of Americans to en-
sure that our democracy is protected. 
With that, I thank you, Mr. Presi-
dent, and I turn it over to my col-
leagues. 
I yield the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I want 
to thank the Senator from Minnesota. 
She is an extraordinarily talented leg-
islator and works well in a challenging 
political environment, and she has 
tackled this issue with a ferocity and 
intensity which is seldom seen in the 
U.S. Senate. It is fitting that she did

and that she continues even to this day 
because of the gravity of the issue, but 
we are fortunate to have her leader-
ship—extraordinary 
leadership—to 
bring us to this moment where we are 
facing the issue of voting in America. 
Mr. President, I started on Capitol 
Hill at the lowest possible level, as an 
intern, in the office of U.S. Senator 
Paul Douglas of Illinois. I was a college 
student at Georgetown University. 
Senator Douglas had served in World 
War II. He volunteered at the age of 50 
to enlist in the Marine Corps and 
worked his way into a fighting position 
in the South Pacific. And on the island 
of Okinawa, he was shot up, and his 
left arm dangled by his side the rest of 
his life, much like Bob Dole. He used to 
refer to that left arm as his paper-
weight. 
He had a way of running a Senate of-
fice which would be impossible in these 
days, but he insisted on signing every 
letter that went out of his office. And 
he would read them and make notes, 
which I thought were illegible, but 
they were his efforts to send personal 
greetings along with the letters. 
Well, you can imagine that they 
stacked up the letters each day—his 
staff did—as they typed them and used 
carbon paper back in the day. And he 
would come in at 5 o’clock at his con-
ference table with a large stack of let-
ters and start to fold them. Of course, 
with one arm, he needed help. That is 
where I showed up—and the other in-
terns. We sat next to him and pulled 
the letters as he signed them. 
And we were told by the senior staff 
in the office that, as interns in that ca-
pacity, we weren’t supposed to talk to 
this great man because he had impor-
tant thoughts going through his mind 
and we shouldn’t interrupt him. But, lo 
and behold, he would open the con-
versation with me and others, and we 
felt really fortunate to have a chance 
to just speak to him for a few minutes. 
So I would prepare, every time I was 
going to play that role, to read even 
more about his background so I knew 
what he had been through. I can recall 
the day when I worked up the courage 
and said—they called him Mr. D.—Mr. 
D., I read somewhere that before 
Franklin Roosevelt was elected Presi-
dent of the United States, that you 
were a socialist and a follower of Nor-
man Thomas, another American social-
ist. Why were you not a Democrat? 
He said: DICK, in those days, the 
Democratic Party was the party of 
southern Democrats who were not good 
on civil rights and big-city bosses, 
whom I always fought in the city of 
Chicago. So socialism was a good alter-
native for a progressive like me. 
I think he used the word ‘‘liberal’’— 
‘‘a liberal like me.’’ 
But then came Roosevelt and opened 
the door for a lot of us on the liberal 
side to become part of the Democratic 
Party—the new Democratic Party— 
under his leadership. 
I always remember that and thought 
that in the course of American history, 
so many times, tables have turned, and 
they are turning on this very issue of 
voting rights, because if you look at 
the history of voting rights in this 
country and the suppression of voting 
rights, 
particularly 
toward 
African 
Americans, I am sorry to report that it 
is my Democratic Party—one I am 
very proud of today—which was guilty 
of so many sins in the past when it 
came to discrimination against voters 
when it came to voting. 
And that, to me, was a reality that is 
now interesting today because the ta-
bles 
have 
turned. 
The 
Republican 
Party, the party of Abraham Lincoln, 
was the party, by and large, that 
fought for voting rights for the re-
cently liberated African-American pop-
ulations after the Civil War and the 
Democrats in the South that resisted 
it. 
I want to commend a book to those 
who are following this debate. It is en-
titled ‘‘One Person, No Vote.’’ And the 
book is written by Carol Anderson, who 
has become a friend of mine. Carol is a 
professor in African-American studies 
at Emory University in Georgia, and 
she writes the history of reconstruc-
tion and Jim Crow. 
I want to read just a small section of 
this book to put in perspective what 
was happening. Here it was, a Civil War 
in this country, with over half a mil-
lion Americans dead, with inflamed 
feelings on both sides of the war. And, 
afterward, for the first time, African 
Americans, because of the war and be-
cause of constitutional amendments, 
were going to be enfranchised—actu-
ally be allowed to vote. And, of course, 
when they did turn up in great num-
bers, they ended up electing their own 
and electing people who were sympa-
thetic to their cause. 
Well, there was a backlash, primarily 
among Democrats in the South, and 
that backlash led to Jim Crow during 
Reconstruction and the suppression of 
the right to vote. 
It was horrible. 
I want to read one part of this book, 
Carol Anderson’s book, ‘‘One Person, 
No Vote.’’ She writes: 
That became most apparent in 1890 when 
the Magnolia State passed the Mississippi 
Plan, a dizzying array of poll taxes, literacy 
tests, 
understanding 
clauses, 
newfangled 
voter registration rules, and ‘‘good char-
acter’’ clauses—all intentionally racially 
discriminatory but dressed up in the genteel 
garb of bringing ‘‘integrity’’ to the voting 
booth. This feigned legal innocence was leg-
islative evil genius. 
Virginia representative Carter Glass, like 
so many others, swooned at the thought of 
bringing the Mississippi Plan to his own 
state [of Virginia], especially after he saw 
how well it had worked. He rushed to cham-
pion a bill in the legislature that would 
‘‘eliminate the darkey as a political factor 
. . . in less than five years.’’ Glass, whom 
President Franklin Roosevelt would one day 
describe as an ‘‘unreconstructed rebel,’’ 
planned ‘‘not to deprive a single white man 
of the ballot, but [to] inevitably cut from the 
existing electorate four-fifths of the Negro 
voters’’ in Virginia. 
One delegate questioned him: ‘‘Will it not 
be done by fraud and discrimination?’’ 
Glass [answered]: 
‘‘By fraud, no. By discrimination, yes.’’ 
‘‘Discrimination! Why, that is precisely what 
we propose . . . to discriminate to the very 
extremity . . . permissible . . . under the 
Federal Constitution, with a view to the 
elimination of every negro voter who can be 
gotten rid of, legally, without materially im-
pairing the numerical strength of the white 
electorate. 
Well, the Mississippi Plan was picked 
up by other States. In Louisiana, for 
example, 
where 
more 
than 
130,000 
Blacks had been registered to vote in 
1896, after the application of these 
laws, the number dropped from 130,000 
to 1,342. African-American registered 
voters in Alabama plunged from 180,000 
to fewer than 3,000 in just 3 years. 
I am sorry to say that these were 
Democrats in the South who were lead-
ing that charge. I am sorry to say that 
that was part of the history of my 
party. But it is history. It does reflect 
what is going on today. 
Now there is a conscious effort by the 
other party—then-party of Abraham 
Lincoln—to find ways to reduce the op-
portunity to vote. And why? Why 
would they do this? In the last Presi-
dential election, in 2020, we had the 
largest turnout in the history of the 
United States, exactly what a democ-
racy should celebrate. And, instead, we 
find State after State dominated by 
Republican legislatures and Governors 
trying to find ways to reduce opportu-
nities to vote. Why? Why wouldn’t we 
make it as easy as possible for every el-
igible American to vote? 
Justice Roberts, in his confirmation 
hearing before the Senate Judiciary 
Committee, I remember, talked about 
voting being the right that is the pre-
servative of all other rights. It is so 
fundamental. You would think that we 
could accept the premise that if this 
democracy is to work, the electorate 
should speak and as many as possible 
should participate. But today we have 
the opposite: an effort by nearly 20 
States or more to reduce opportunities 
to vote, and in reducing those opportu-
nities, many people will be denied their 
chance to speak when it comes to the 
election. 
Congress and our Nation marked the 
first anniversary of one of the darkest 
days in America history yesterday: the 
January 6 insurrection, the day Amer-
ican democracy was nearly lost. That 
day, an embittered, defeated President 
Trump sent a murderous mob to attack 
this Capitol and overturn the election 
he had lost. 
I was honored to join my colleagues 
yesterday to speak to the bravery of 
the Capitol Police, the Washington, 
DC, Metropolitan Police, and the Na-
tional Guard, who battled not only to 
defend this building but to defend our 
way of life and our government. Those 
defenders of democracy faced down vio-
lent extremists for hours. They en-
dured vicious attacks with fists, chem-
ical sprays, baseball bats, flagpoles, 
steel bars, and other weapons. 
It is because of their courageous sac-
rifice that our democracy survived.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S87 
January 7, 2022 
Five police officers who battled the 
mob on January 6 died over the fol-
lowing days, weeks, and months. Most 
of them continue to protect us, even as 
they heal from the wounds of that day. 
As these officers will tell you, Janu-
ary 6 was not a normal day for tourists 
in the Capitol, despite what Congress-
man ANDREW
CLYDE, Republican of 
Georgia, claimed. And the threat of 
January 6 is not over. 
For a few short hours after the insur-
rection, many of our Republican col-
leagues denounced the violence and the 
former President who provoked it. But 
sadly, Republican lawmakers through-
out America quickly changed their 
tune. In a matter of days, more and 
more were intimidated to embrace the 
former President’s Big Lie that the 
2020 election somehow was not legiti-
mate. Since January 6, we have seen a 
torrent of bills introduced in Repub-
lican-controlled legislatures to restrict 
voting rights and undermine the integ-
rity of our democracy. Republican law-
makers in nearly 20 States—including 
Georgia, Arizona, and Florida—have 
passed laws making it harder for mil-
lions of Americans to vote, and in some 
cases, making it easier—and this is so 
critical—for politicians to overturn 
election results they don’t like. 
Let’s be honest. These laws aren’t 
about preventing voter fraud. They are 
about giving politicians the power to 
pick and choose the votes they want to 
count. 
Does that sound like an echo of the 
history that we lived through right 
after the Civil War in the 19th and 20th 
centuries? 
Instead of denouncing these efforts, 
our Republican colleagues have resur-
rected the age-old battle cry that they 
were using in those days: States’ 
rights. They insist—falsely—that Con-
gress has no authority to protect citi-
zens whose voting rights are under at-
tack. They are wrong. They have not 
taken the time to read history or the 
Constitution. 
Inside the desk in this Chamber of 
every single Senator is a little book: 
the U.S. Constitution. I commend it to 
my colleagues, particularly in light of 
this debate. 
It is article 1, section 4 of that Con-
stitution which says: ‘‘The Times, 
Places and Manner of holding elections 
for Senators and Representatives, shall 
be prescribed in each State by the Leg-
islature thereof; but the Congress may 
at any time by law make or alter such 
Regulations, except as to the Places of 
chusing Senators.’’ 
When you think about what we are 
trying to do here, as the Senator from 
Minnesota has described it, we are set-
ting out to establish the standards by 
law for the choosing of Federal elec-
tion. 
Fast forward about 80 years after 
that sentence was written. The Civil 
War had come to a close, and the 15th 
Amendment was ratified to protect the 
rights of newly freed slaves, including 
the right to vote. What does that sec-
tion of the Constitution say? Section 2 
of the 15th Amendment: 
Congress shall have the power to enforce 
this article by appropriate legislation. 
It couldn’t be stated any more clear-
ly. Preventing States from denying 
citizens their right to vote is not con-
stitutional overreach. It is urgent, con-
stitutional obligation, and we must 
honor it. 
The International Institute for De-
mocracy and Electoral Assistance is a 
think tank in Sweden. Every year, for 
more than 50 years, it has ranked the 
world’s nations according to their com-
mitment to democracy. In 2021, for the 
first time ever, the United States’ 
ranking fell to what the group calls ‘‘a 
backsliding democracy.’’ The report 
said: ‘‘A historic turning point came in 
2020–21, when former President Donald 
Trump questioned the legitimacy of 
the 
2020 
elections 
in 
the 
United 
States.’’ 
We call it the Big Lie. If we in this 
Senate fail to denounce that Big Lie, 
do you know what America’s future is 
going to look like? It won’t be a gov-
ernment of and by the people. It will be 
a 
government 
ruled 
by 
political 
strongmen with weak principles. 
These new voter-suppression laws are 
a coup in slow motion. They are the 
continuation of the January 6 assault 
on this building and our Constitution. 
They are designed to bring your right 
to decide your future—and deny it. 
Ask yourself this: If the American 
people don’t decide the outcome of 
elections, who will? I will tell you: po-
litical partisans, special interests, the 
rich and the powerful. 
This Senate has the responsibility to 
protect the power and the rights of 
American voters in our democracy. 
And right now, there are two common-
sense proposals before the Senate to do 
just that. I am honored to cosponsor 
both. The first is the bipartisan—thank 
you, Senator MURKOWSKI, of Alaska— 
John Lewis Voting Rights Advance-
ment Act. It would strengthen the Vot-
ing Rights Act of 1965, the crown jewel 
of the Civil Rights Movement. 
For decades, Republicans and Demo-
crats have worked together—on a near-
ly unanimous basis—to reauthorize and 
update the Voting Rights Act. As Sen-
ator KLOBUCHAR
mentioned earlier, 
there were times when more than 90 
Senators would vote in favor of the re-
authorization of that act. It reached a 
point in the House of Representatives 
where I believe the only Republican 
Congressman who would stand up and 
continue to vote for the reauthoriza-
tion of that act was Jim Sensenbrenner 
of Wisconsin. He has since retired. 
This new version, named in honor of 
the great John Lewis, our friend and 
colleague, 
would 
restore 
the 
full 
strength and authority of that legisla-
tion, 
which 
has 
been 
dangerously 
weakened by a series of misguided deci-
sions from the conservative majority 
on the Supreme Court. I worked with 
Senators 
LEAHY, 
MURKOWSKI, 
and 
MANCHIN to craft this compromise bill. 
The second bill, which Senator KLO-
BUCHAR spoke to—the Freedom to Vote 
Act—would preserve the integrity of 
our elections by establishing minimum 
standards for voting access in all 
States, including same-day voter reg-
istration and establishing election day 
as a Federal holiday. 
What is behind all that? Just a very 
basic premise: Eligible voters should 
not face obstacles in voting. We ought 
to make it easier for them. Isn’t it an 
embarrassment to you—it is to me—to 
watch the newscast show people stand-
ing in line—literally, hours to vote? 
Bless them for their determination to 
exercise their rights as citizens in this 
country. But shame on us—this great 
Nation—that we would make it so in-
convenient and so difficult. And now 
State legislatures across the Nation 
are doing even worse. 
I am grateful to Senator MERKLEY, 
who is here, and Senator KLOBUCHAR, 
for leading the efforts on this critical 
legislation. Both of these measures are 
simple, 
sensible, 
and 
popular. 
To-
gether, they will protect every eligible 
voter’s access to the ballot box. 
There is no guarantee that more peo-
ple turning up to vote are all going to 
vote for Democrats—or even for Repub-
licans. But isn’t it the nature of de-
mocracy to leave it to the American 
people to make that choice, not to 
those of us in legislatures, either State 
or Federal? 
So why is it that our colleagues on 
the other side are once again using the 
filibuster to prevent the Senate from 
even beginning debate on these bills? It 
goes back to that old States’ rights ar-
gument. I mentioned it earlier. Some 
Republicans have claimed that our pro-
posals would amount to ‘‘a Federal 
takeover of our election system.’’ 
To those Republicans, I would say: 
Open your desk, and open this book, 
and read. 
It is a baseless claim. These measures 
are about preventing partisans from 
poisoning the well of democracy. We 
cannot stand idly by as Republicans 
State legislatures enact a wave of un-
precedented voter suppression, return-
ing to that grim, dark period in Amer-
ican history of suppression of voting. 
We cannot accept that the Senate is 
powerless. 
Later this month, we are going to 
honor Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., a 
champion of democracy in our lifetime. 
Throughout the civil rights movement, 
Dr. King would quote a phrase from 
Thomas Carlyle, the historian, who 
wrote in his account of the French 
Revolution: ‘‘No lie can live forever.’’ 
So how much longer will we allow 
Mr. Trump’s Big Lie to tear our Nation 
apart? How much longer will we accord 
a simple Senate rule more protection 
and respect than the Constitution—a 
Senate rule that began as a clerical 
error and has been changed 160 times? 
Right now, the only obstacle stand-
ing in the way of stopping this voter 
suppression is the filibuster. But let’s 
be clear. There is no Senate rule more

important 
than 
our 
constitutional 
right to vote. Americans have given 
their lives to defend our constitutional 
rights. No one has ever been asked to 
risk their life to defend the Senate fili-
buster rule. 
For our Republican colleagues to 
feign outrage about preserving the 
rules and norms of this Senate, I would 
ask them to think back a year ago this 
week. Where were these precious rules 
and norms when the leader of the Re-
publican 
Party—then-President 
Trump—plotted an overthrow of the 
government by disrupting the Senate 
business? Where were these rules and 
norms when some of our colleagues 
echoed the Big Lie that led to that 
bloody insurrection? And where were 
these rules and norms when some mem-
bers of the Republican Party openly 
endorsed installing Donald Trump to 
the Presidency against the will of the 
American people? 
Right now, this is not just another 
political debate; the future of the 
American democracy is at stake. 
I yield the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Virginia. 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I am so 
proud to be on the floor with my col-
leagues 
Senator 
DURBIN, 
Senator 
MERKLEY, and Senator KLOBUCHAR to 
work on this issue of such great impor-
tance. 
I would like to now discuss the John 
Lewis Act and the Freedom to Vote 
Act, critical voting rights proposals 
that the Senate will soon take up and 
that the Senate needs to pass. We have 
tried to bring these bills to the floor in 
recent months. The minority party has 
blocked the effort to even consider the 
bills, with the sole exception of one Re-
publican, the senior Senator from Alas-
ka, who has been willing to vote to pro-
ceed to consideration of the John 
Lewis Act. 
Some of the most epic moments in 
the history of this Chamber have come 
as we grappled with voting rights. 
After the Civil War, the debate sur-
rounding the 13th, 14th, and 15th 
Amendments were epic struggles about 
the Nation’s new recommitment to the 
equality principle after the Civil War, 
and those struggles included dramatic 
discussions about voting connected to 
both the 14th and 15th Amendments. 
The struggle for women’s suffrage, cul-
minating in the 1919 passage of the 19th 
Amendment in the Senate, was also a 
pivotal moment for this body. 
I believe the most dramatic voting 
rights struggle in the Chamber was the 
passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. 
Civil rights activist John Lewis and 
others marching for voting rights were 
savagely beaten on the Edmund Pettus 
Bridge in Selma, AL, in March of 1965. 
The building frustration of those de-
nied votes in many States, together 
with that shocking instance of vio-
lence, coalesced into a final push to get 
a comprehensive voting rights bill ap-
proved. President Johnson addressed a 
joint session of Congress on March 15, 
just 8 days after the attack on John 
Lewis, and he threw his support behind 
the Voting Rights Act. 
The Senate began floor consideration 
of the bill on April 22. After more than 
a month of vigorous debating, filibus-
tering, fighting, and amending, the bill 
passed, and it passed in a dramatically 
bipartisan fashion. Democratic support 
was 47 to 16. Republican support was 
overwhelming—30 to 2. The House 
passed its own version in July. A con-
ference report was passed and then ac-
cepted by both Houses in early August. 
President Johnson then signed the bill 
in a ceremony attended by Rosa Parks, 
John Lewis, Reverend Dr. Martin Lu-
ther King, and many other legislative 
and civil rights leaders. 
The Voting Rights Act that was 
fought for so hard in this Chamber and 
passed in 1965 is viewed as the most im-
portant piece of civil rights legislation 
in the history of this country. It ush-
ered in dramatic increases in voter 
turnout, more opportunity for racial 
minorities not only to vote but also to 
run for office. 
Studies have drawn a direct connec-
tion between the act and concrete ac-
tions to provide more government serv-
ices to communities that had long suf-
fered from public disinvestment. It is 
obvious: When all citizens are pro-
tected in their right to vote, then gov-
ernment becomes more responsive to 
all citizens. 
The 1965 act was strongly bipartisan, 
both in its passage and in the frequent 
reauthorization over the years, most 
recently in 2006. But since 2006—really 
beginning 
with 
the 
Obama 
Presi-
dency—the Republican Party has es-
sentially done a 180 in its long support 
of expanding the franchise. Hostile Su-
preme Court rulings in Shelby v. Mis-
sissippi and Brnovich v. Democratic 
National Committee have put the bur-
den back on Congress to fix the Voting 
Rights Act. But, in contrast to pre-
vious history where Republicans would 
join with us in those efforts, efforts to 
fix or improve the act have foundered 
because now the Republican Party is 
unwilling to support voting rights. 
I talk about the 1965 act because it is 
notable to me for two reasons. First, it 
came at a time when many States, pri-
marily in the South, including my own 
Commonwealth of Virginia, were un-
dertaking massive efforts to disenfran-
chise African-American voters. And 
there was a culminating event—shock-
ing violence against John Lewis and 
others as they tried to press for voting 
rights, and that violence galvanized 
the Nation and this body into action so 
we could protect voting and protect 
our democracy. 
History repeats itself. Today, we are 
seeing a full-out attack on voting and 
our entire electoral system. Now it is 
not just limited to Southern States. 
Now it is not just directed solely at Af-
rican-American voters. Now it is not 
just an attack led by bigoted State or 
local officials in one region. The attack 
emanated from the previous President, 
with years of attacks on the integrity 
of American elections—attacks that 
ratcheted up in the closing phase of the 
2020 election. 
President Trump, after losing that 
race, then went on a wild search for a 
way to hold on to power, making up 
lies about the election, spearheading 
meritless lawsuits in many States to 
challenge the result, directly asking 
election officials to ‘‘find’’ him enough 
votes to win key jurisdictions, and 
even trying to strong-arm his own Vice 
President into violating his constitu-
tional oath so that he would deliver a 
victory to the losing candidate. 
Just as in 1965, there came an unfor-
gettable episode of violence directly re-
lated to the attacks on our system of 
elections. The Capitol itself was at-
tacked on a particular day and hour for 
a particular purpose: to stop the cer-
tification of the electoral outcome. 
More than 100 police officers were in-
jured that day as a result of this at-
tack on our democracy. Five Virginia 
law enforcement officers lost their 
lives as a result of that day. 
The violence wasn’t just a riot; it 
was violence designed to disenfranchise 
the 80 million people who had voted for 
Joe Biden and KAMALA HARRIS. That 
singular event ranks among the largest 
disenfranchisement efforts in the his-
tory of this country. 
History repeats itself, and the at-
tacks on our democracy continue. In 
Republican 
State 
legislatures 
all 
across this country, as has been dem-
onstrated by my colleague from Min-
nesota, efforts are underway to restrict 
voting, to make it harder for people to 
vote if they are more likely to vote for 
Democrats, to make it easier to chal-
lenge and intimidate voters with the 
hope that it will discourage their par-
ticipation, to interfere with the count-
ing of votes, and to interfere with the 
certification of elections by duly-sworn 
election officials. These are partisan 
efforts only occurring in States with 
Republican leadership, and they pose a 
grave threat to our democracy. 
The violence of January 6 also con-
tinues in a tremendous spike in threats 
to those public servants who serve as 
election 
officials—threats 
to 
their 
lives, threats to their families—all de-
signed to intimidate those who won’t 
bend to the will of the former Presi-
dent and those who have been dragged 
into his full-scale assault on our de-
mocracy. 
So the Senate stands at the same 
moral crossroads where we stood in the 
spring of 1965. There is an assault on 
voting and elections, on the very sys-
tem of democracy that distinguishes 
our Nation. The assault has led to 
shocking and cataclysmic violence spe-
cifically designed to disenfranchise 
millions of people, and the question for 
the Senate is, What should we do about 
it? 
In the John Lewis Act and the Free-
dom to Vote Act, we find a solution for 
the moment, just as the Senate found 
in the Voting Rights Act a solution for 
its time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S89 
January 7, 2022 
The 
Lewis 
Act 
restores 
the 
preclearance process contained in sec-
tion 5 of the Voting Rights Act by com-
ing up with a fair process for deter-
mining which jurisdictions must seek 
preclearance of voting changes. No 
longer is preclearance limited to cer-
tain geographies or States with long 
histories of discriminatory electoral 
practice; instead, every region and 
community is treated the same, sub-
ject to preclearance for a fixed period 
of years following any voting rights 
violation 
and 
able 
to 
avoid 
preclearance if there have been no such 
violations. 
The Freedom to Vote Act sets mini-
mal standards for access to the ballot 
in Federal elections, mandates trans-
parency in campaign contributions, re-
quires nonpartisan redistricting for 
congressional seats, and provides rem-
edies to block partisan efforts to take 
power away from duly-sworn election 
officials. It is designed for the dangers 
of the moment and will both protect 
people’s right to vote and give them 
confidence that their vote will be 
counted and an election result will be 
accurate and fair. 
It is high time we take up these bills 
and pass them, and the floor debate 
should be vigorous, with an oppor-
tunity for colleagues to make their 
case and offer amendments. The Nation 
is watching us and needs to understand 
where every Member of the body stands 
on this critical issue. 
I acknowledge one sad reality of this 
likely debate. Protecting voting rights 
is unlikely to attract Republican sup-
port as it did in 1965. I hope I am 
wrong. I would be very happy to apolo-
gize for being wrong, but I have had 
enough conversations with my Repub-
lican colleagues, and I watched their 
votes on the floor as we brought these 
matters up before. I think I understand 
what they will likely do. But even if we 
get no Republican support, we cannot 
shrink from the task. The stakes are 
too high and the moment is too mean-
ingful to allow for any evasion. If we 
pass this bill, it will be good for Repub-
licans and Democrats and Independents 
because it is good for democracy. 
As I close, I will just bring up a re-
cent example to show why expanding 
voting is not just good for one party. 
We just had a Governor’s election in 
Virginia, November 2021. My preferred 
Democratic candidate lost, but the 
election, in a bigger way, was good for 
democracy because the turnout in the 
election went up by 25 percent over the 
turnout in the Governor’s race 4 years 
before. More people participated, and 
that is a good thing. 
Why did the turnout go up? The turn-
out went up because Democrats earned 
control of both houses of our State leg-
islative chamber and made a set of 
changes—much like the changes in the 
Freedom to Vote Act—to make it easi-
er for people to participate and give 
them confidence in the integrity of the 
ballot and certification of results. 
Guess what. When Democrats did that, 
turnout went up by 25 percent. And the 
winner wasn’t a Democrat; the winner 
was a Republican. 
Doing things like the Freedom to 
Vote Act isn’t partisan, even though 
the vote in here will be partisan. It is 
good for all. 
That increase in turnout by almost 25 
percent almost set a record in Virginia. 
There was only one Governor’s race 
where the turnout jump was even big-
ger, and it was when my father-in-law 
was elected Governor of Virginia in 
1969. My father-in-law, Linwood Hol-
ton, had run as a Republican for Gov-
ernor in 1965 and lost. He ran again in 
1969 and won, and the turnout went up 
by 65 percent between his two races. 
That is the one that sets the record in 
Virginia. Why did turnout go up? Be-
cause the Voting Rights Act was 
passed and because the U.S. Supreme 
Court in Harper v. Virginia in 1966 
struck down poll taxes as a pre-
condition of voting in State elections. 
So fancy that. You make it easier for 
people to vote, you remove discrimina-
tory obstacles in their way, and more 
people 
participate—not 
necessarily 
good for Democrats, not always good 
for Republicans, but always good for 
the health of a democracy. That is why 
we need to pass these bills. 
I yield the floor. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader is recog-
nized. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I usu-
ally don’t give such lengthy speeches, 
but today I will be on the floor for a 
little while, and I have 12 sections to 
my speech. The first section is on vot-
ing rights, of course. 
The first section is history, equality, 
democracy, and the Founders’ vision. 
And I begin with a quote. 
To understand political power right, and 
derive it from its original, we must consider, 
what state all men [and women] are natu-
rally in and that is a state of perfect freedom 
to order their actions and dispose of their 
possessions and persons, as they think fit, 
within the bounds of the law of nature, with-
out asking leave, or depending upon the will 
of any other [person]. 
John Locke published those words in 
England anonymously—anonymously— 
exactly 100 years before the Constitu-
tion of the United States came into ef-
fect a very, very long time ago, at least 
to the human mind. 
They were published not in the era of 
Republics but of kingdoms; not of 
Presidents but of Monarchs; not of citi-
zens but rather subjects. It was an era 
when many argued and took up arms 
for the idea that the King derived 
power from the decrees of Heaven, and 
here John Locke said, no, political 
power, in fact, comes from free individ-
uals. 
These words were circulated for years 
in secret—in secret—because to hold 
these views back then was treason. 
Locke went further: 
The natural state is also one of equality in 
which all power and jurisdiction is recip-
rocal, and no one has more than another. It 
is evident that all human beings . . . are 
equal amongst themselves. 
These words, these ideas, a third of a 
millennia old, but it is right there star-
ing us in the face. All men and women 
are naturally free, and all men and 
women are naturally equal. 
I will admit this may be lofty stuff, 
but history lessons matter—because 
these ideas were the initial blueprints 
for a different sort of political order 
that would take shape here in this con-
tinent, articulated a century later in 
the words of the American Declaration 
of Independence. 
These were the original ideas for 
what would inspire the Framers to cre-
ate—not a kingdom but a Republic, a 
democratic society, a place where peo-
ple equal in rank decide their own lead-
ers and create free elections. 
It reminds me of the words of James 
Madison as well: 
Who are to be the electors of the federal 
representatives? Not the rich, more than the 
poor; not the learned, more than the igno-
rant; not the haughty heirs of distinguished 
names. . . . The electors are to be the great 
body of the people of the United States. 
Section 2: American History is a 
Long March Toward Universal Suf-
frage. That is the noble side of our 
early history, worthy of remembering 
and pursuing to this day. There is, of 
course, a more complicated, more frus-
trating reality, one we should not be 
afraid to admit and to recognize. And 
one we hide from or, worse, try to erase 
at our own peril. 
We all know that when our country 
was founded, mass participation in rep-
resentative government might have 
been the object of the Founders, but it 
certainly was not a practice. Imme-
diately excluded were 700,000 enslaved 
men and women, counted as three- 
fifths of a person for the purpose of 
congressional 
allotment, 
but 
zero- 
fifths of a person for all other matters 
of human dignity. Women, too, were 
left out. 
Also cast aside and brutalized were 
those who lived on this continent for 
thousands of years before the colonial 
era, for whom full participation in po-
litical life, in practicality, has never, 
never been made real, even till today. 
And through it all—through it all—vot-
ing requirements were left to the 
States to choose for themselves so that 
depending on which side of a State 
boundary you lived on, a different side 
or set of rules might apply to you in 
determining your worthiness to choose 
your own leaders. 
So despite Madison’s sentiments, at 
the time of our Constitution’s ratifica-
tion, you had to be a White male, of-
tentimes 
Protestant, 
landowner 
to 
vote. 
By the election of 1800, barely more 
than 1 in 10 Americans were even eligi-
ble to vote. Of the 16 States then in the 
Union all but 3 limited suffrage to 
property holders or taxpayers. 
And here is another truth too: De-
spite all that, the story of democracy

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S90 
January 7, 2022 
in America has been a long march, a 
very long, torturous march toward uni-
versal suffrage. 
In America, our holy struggle has 
been to take these words of our Fram-
ers, to take the idea that everyone 
should live freely and equally and to 
make it real in whatever way the peo-
ple can make it real. 
It is an exercise in making better 
what was once woefully imperfect, of 
having hope that we can make even 
more progress in the future. Indeed, 
this is written into the very, very first 
statement of our Constitution, making 
a more perfect Union. 
So, from the get-go, generations of 
Americans have sought to truly estab-
lish the United States as a full democ-
racy. We fought a bloody Civil War to 
end slavery. Women organized and 
reached for the ballot. 
The civil rights movement brought 
an end to the vicious segregation of the 
mid-20th century. And here in Con-
gress, yes, in this Congress, we passed 
the Voting Rights Act, the National 
Voter Registration Act, and the 14th, 
15th, 19th, 23rd, 24th, and 26th Amend-
ments to expand the franchise until 
there were no more boundaries. 
Now, we all know, unfortunately, the 
march has not always been linear. 
Throughout our Nation’s history, mo-
ments of significant progress have been 
followed by reactionary backlash. That 
backlash takes many forms: White su-
premacy, tyranny, demagoguery, fear, 
and political violence, and much, much 
more. 
Today, it lives on in the internet, in 
the dark corners of online places that 
deal not in truth but in conspiracies 
that I would call wacky or bizarre, if 
they weren’t so darn dangerous. It also 
lives, sadly, in the cascade of deranged 
propaganda we see emanating from cer-
tain cable news networks. 
Unfortunately, it seems, led by one 
party, compelled by the most dishonest 
President in history, we are entering 
another one of those dark periods. 
That is what we are talking about 
here today on the Senate floor. 
Section 3: The Origins of the Big Lie. 
If there is anything else, besides free 
and fair elections, that has been cen-
tral to our national political character, 
it has been our largely unbroken fidel-
ity to the peaceful transfer of power— 
peaceful transfer of power. 
You can’t talk about voting rights 
and free and fair elections and democ-
racy without also presupposing that 
the leaders are willing to step down 
when their turns are over, when they 
have lost elections. Thankfully, our 
leaders have, by and large, honored 
this tradition, whether that has been in 
victory or in defeat. Nobody likes los-
ing, but sometimes you have to move 
on. That is life. 
But then came Donald Trump. Like 
many before him, Trump ran for reelec-
tion in 2020 and lost his race. In fact, he 
lost to Joe Biden by 7 million votes and 
74 electoral college votes. I shouldn’t 
have to say that, but it is the truth, 
and sometimes the truth gets distorted 
around here. 
But rather than accept defeat, rather 
than follow in the noble tradition of 
those who came before him, Donald 
Trump rejected the results of the 2020 
election and claimed, without a shred 
of evidence, without any evidence, that 
the election was rigged, that it was 
stolen, that it was a con job unlike 
anything we have ever seen before. 
He planted the seeds of that lie long 
before the election even happened. Yes, 
the Big Lie was born then. 
Section 4: The Big Lie is Just That, a 
Lie. It is a lie. It is not a misinter-
pretation. It is not one person looks at 
it one way; one person looks at it the 
other, as my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle want us to believe. It 
is just a lie. 
To this day, there is not a shred of 
evidence supporting the fantasy that 
Donald Trump won the election only to 
have it stolen from him. 
As a general principle, extraordinary 
claims should come with extraordinary 
proof. We haven’t seen anything close 
to proof in the 14 or so months since 
the 2020 election. On the other side of 
the aisle, the biggest—biggest—loudest 
talkers about the election being stolen 
have not presented any facts. It is ap-
palling. 
So let’s examine the record. First, 
Donald Trump has had plenty of 
chances to prove his allegations in the 
court of law. In virtually every in-
stance, he has failed. Let me read an 
excerpt from USA TODAY, published 
last year on the day of the insurrec-
tion: 
The President and his allies have filed 62 
lawsuits in state and federal courts seeking 
to overturn election results in states that 
the President lost. 
A little further it reads: 
Out of the 62 lawsuits filed challenging the 
presidential election, 61 have failed. 
Sixty-one. 
Sixty-two lawsuits in a little under 2 
months, and if that is not good enough 
for some people, let me read further 
from the article. 
Some cases were dismissed— 
Says the article— 
for lack of standing and others based on the 
merits of the voter fraud allegations. The de-
cisions have come from both Democratic- 
. . . and Republican-appointed judges—in-
cluding federal judges appointed by [Presi-
dent] Trump. 
So Trump and his allies went to 
court to try and make the case for 
voter fraud and virtually lost at every 
turn. 
Now let us move from the courts to 
what actually happened in the States 
during the 2020 election. 
Across the board, state officials in 
States, both red and blue—and, in fact, 
States that ultimately made the dif-
ference in the election—all said the 
same thing: There was no—no—voter 
fraud. 
Here is what the Republican Sec-
retary of State in Nevada said in April 
of last year, the State GOP concerns 
did ‘‘not amount to evidentiary sup-
port for the contention that the 2020 
general election was plagued by wide-
spread voter fraud.’’ 
No voter fraud in Nevada. 
In Arizona, Secretary of State Hobbs 
said last year: 
There is absolutely no merit to any claims 
of widespread voter fraud. 
Just this week—just this week—the 
election department at Maricopa Coun-
ty, the largest county in Arizona, head-
ed by a Republican, released a 90-page 
document delivering a point-by-point 
refusal of claims of voter fraud. Their 
conclusion? The November 2020 elec-
tion in Arizona was administered with 
integrity, and the results were accu-
rate and reliable. This has been proven 
throughout statutorily required accu-
racy tests, court tests, hand counts 
performed by political parties, and 
post-election audits. No fraud in Ari-
zona. 
Let’s turn to Georgia. The secretary 
of state in Georgia published an op-ed 
in the Washington Post last year to de-
fend his State’s results. 
He wrote: 
Georgia’s voting system has never been 
more secure or trustworthy. 
They had multiple recounts in Geor-
gia, importuned by Trump supporters. 
They had a hand recount. The result 
was the same every time: No voter 
fraud in Georgia. 
In Pennsylvania, one Pennsylvania 
Republican legislator said the fol-
lowing about his own party’s efforts to 
conduct a so-called forensic audit: 
The current attempt to discredit the 2020 
election runs headlong into an unmistakable 
truth: Donald Trump lost Pennsylvania be-
cause Donald Trump received fewer votes. 
No fraud in Pennsylvania either. 
In Wisconsin, the same story. News-
week: ‘‘GOP-Aligned Group Finds No 
Evidence of Wisconsin Voter Fraud 
After 10–Month Investigation.’’ 
It reads: 
A close review, including a hand count of 
roughly 20,000 ballots from 20 wards, uncov-
ered no evidence of fraudulent ballots or 
widespread voter fraud. 
The report reads: 
Our hand review found that the counts 
closely matched those reported by the Wis-
consin Elections Commission. 
The review found no evidence of 
fraudulent ballots. 
Then we have Michigan. By now, I 
expect you know how this is going to 
end. Last summer, the GOP—the Re-
publican-controlled State senate re-
leased a much anticipated report exam-
ining allegations of fraud within their 
own State. According to the Detroit 
News, the report’s main author, Sen-
ator Ed McBroom, a Republican, said 
‘‘he found ‘no evidence of widespread or 
systematic 
fraud,’ 
contradicting 
months of assertions from some mem-
bers of his own party, including former 
President Donald Trump.’’ 
So let’s just take a moment to re-
view. No voter fraud in Nevada. None 
in Arizona, nor in Georgia or Pennsyl-
vania or Wisconsin. No voter fraud in 
Michigan.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S91 
January 7, 2022 
So it is clear that the reason Donald 
Trump is not in office today is because 
he didn’t receive enough votes to win 
the election. It is that simple. It is in-
disputable. The court said so, the 
States say so, and the facts say so. In-
deed, even Donald Trump’s own admin-
istration said so. 
A month after the election, it was 
none other than former Attorney Gen-
eral Bill Barr himself who made clear 
that the President was lying to the 
American people. 
In an interview with the AP, the As-
sociated Press, about a month after the 
election—here is a quote. Barr told the 
AP that ‘‘U.S. attorneys and FBI 
agents have been working to follow up 
specific complaints and misinforma-
tion they have received, but, to date, 
we have not seen fraud on a scale that 
could have effected a different outcome 
in the election.’’ Bill Barr, Donald 
Trump’s acolyte, said that. 
Months later, Barr said: 
My suspicion all the way was that there 
was nothing there. It was all [BS]. 
I will note that Mr. BARR used a dif-
ferent word at the end of that quote, 
which I am not repeating here. 
But this is the Attorney General, the 
President’s acolyte, who sided with 
him through impeachment and issue 
after issue. Even he says there is no 
fraud. 
How can so many people still cling to 
this? 
Elected 
officials, 
responsible 
elected officials—they are doing dam-
age, true damage, to our Republic— 
true damage. 
I rarely agree with the Attorney Gen-
eral. On this, he is on the mark. The 
Big Lie is BS—BS. 
So let me state once again, although 
it should hardly need repeating, that 
the 2020 election was not in dispute. 
Donald Trump did not have an election 
stolen from him. Nothing about 2020 
was rigged, as he says. But today— 
today—a frightful amount of Ameri-
cans still believe what Mr. Trump is 
saying is true, tens of millions of 
Americans—a minority, yes, but a size-
able one that cannot be ignored. That 
is the Big Lie in a nutshell. To them, it 
doesn’t matter that there is no sub-
stance to these arguments. To them, it 
doesn’t matter that the President’s 
own allies have debunked it. They want 
to believe it anyway, and believe it, 
they do. 
Donald Trump, about the most per-
nicious President we have ever had— 
not about; the most pernicious Presi-
dent—no President has done this. Well, 
he understands that. He understood 
from the moment the polls closed on 
election night that all he had to do was 
repeat the lie again and again and 
again, and it would take a life of its 
own. 
Now, sadly and greatly troubling the 
whole country, the Big Lie is poisoning 
our 
democracy—poisoning 
it. 
Con-
spiracy theories are spreading online. 
Cable news anchors are spewing false-
hoods and generating a sense of rage 
among their viewers. 
When the courts refused to back the 
former President, when the States re-
fused to back him, and when some of 
his own administration refused to back 
him, he was left with one last-ditch ef-
fort to hold on to power: to get the 
Vice President to reject the results of 
January 6. 
By now, we all know about the dread-
ed tweet he posted in December of 2020: 
‘‘Big protest in D.C. on January 6th. Be 
there, will be wild!’’ 
What a sad documentation this all is 
in 21st-century America. 
Section 5: The Attack on the Capitol. 
A Short Review. 
It was Donald Trump’s Big Lie that 
soaked our political landscape in ker-
osene. It was Donald Trump’s rally on 
the Mall on January 6 that struck the 
match. And then came the fire, and all 
of us were here 1 year ago yesterday to 
watch the fire burn. 
Yesterday, many of us spent much of 
the day recounting what it was like to 
be here in the Capitol on January 6. I 
want to commend my colleagues for 
doing so. But it is shameful my Repub-
lican colleagues had to come to the 
floor to speak as well. January 6 was 
every bit an attack on them as it was 
on anyone else. It is shameful that my 
Republican colleagues did not come to 
the floor to speak as well. They did not 
come to the floor. This room was 
empty on this side of the aisle. Janu-
ary 6 was every bit an attack on them 
as it was on anyone else. All of us suf-
fer when democracy is assaulted. This 
is not a party matter. 
So I want to thank my colleagues 
who did come to the floor yesterday 
and everyone across the Capitol who 
shared their stories yesterday. Many of 
these stories are painful to visit, but 
they radiate with the light of truth, 
and I applaud them all. 
Of course, we also pay tribute to all 
those who put themselves in harm’s 
way to protect us and protect this 
building: our Capitol Police, our DC 
Metro Police, our National Guard. 
They were outnumbered, unprepared, 
largely left on their own, but they held 
the line. 
When rioters cleared out of the build-
ing, another wave of heroes came in: 
the men and women who work as the 
maintenance 
staff, 
as 
technicians. 
They came in into the night, without 
complaint, and brought the Capitol 
back to life so that we were able to 
continue to count the votes and not let 
this insurrectionist mob stop American 
democracy from proceeding forward. 
Those who came in represent the best 
of us—the best of us. 
Section 6: The Disease of the Big Lie 
Lives On. 
The attack on the U.S. Capitol may 
have been limited to a single day; the 
attack on our democracy, unfortu-
nately, has not ceased. 
Since last year, there have been no 
outright attempts to storm this build-
ing to undo the will of the people, 
thank God, but the disease of the Big 
Lie continues to spread. Donald Trump 
has not changed his tune. He keeps in-
sisting that our democracy is rigged 
and that our elections have been rid-
dled with voter fraud. He did it as re-
cently as yesterday. In fact, he was 
going to have an entire press con-
ference on it before calling it off. It 
was reported that his own Republican 
colleagues didn’t want to hear him 
spew his lies on this day that has be-
come so sacred to so many. What Don-
ald Trump does is poison. The con-
sequences of the former President’s 
words continue to erode our democracy 
day by day. 
If the enemies of democracy fail to 
get their way with baseball bats and 
pipe bombs, they have now turned their 
focus to a much quieter, much more or-
ganized effort to subvert our demo-
cratic process from the bottom up—in 
other words, a slow-motion insurrec-
tion but equally as insidious and ulti-
mately more damaging. 
Slow-motion insurrection. ‘‘Democ-
racy experts alarmed over GOP take-
over of election machinery.’’ That is 
the AP. 
I want to read the following from the 
AP: 
In the weeks leading up to the deadly in-
surrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, a 
handful of Americans—well-known politi-
cians, obscure local bureaucrats—stood up to 
block then-President . . . Trump’s unprece-
dented attempt to overturn a free and fair 
vote of the American people. 
[But] in this year since, Trump-aligned Re-
publicans have worked to clear the path for 
the next time. 
The article continues: 
In battleground states— 
That is the headline here— 
In battleground states and beyond, Repub-
licans are taking hold of the once-overlooked 
machinery of elections. While the effort is 
incomplete and uneven, outside experts on 
democracy and Democrats are sounding 
alarms, warning that the United States is 
witnessing a ‘‘slow-motion insurrection’’— 
Slow-motion insurrection— 
with a better chance of success than Trump’s 
failed power grab last year. 
They point to a mounting list of evidence: 
Several candidates who deny Trump’s loss 
are running for offices that could have a key 
role in the election of the next president in 
2024. 
The 
efforts 
are 
poised 
to 
fuel 
disinformation and anger about the 
2020 results for years to come. 
This is the heart of the matter of 
why we are here today. The insurrec-
tion that occurred a year ago yester-
day is still going on. It may be slow- 
motion but, in all likelihood, if we do 
nothing about it, far more damaging to 
this Republic than even the insurrec-
tionists were on the sixth. 
Section 7: Voter Suppression in the 
States. 
It merits repeating again. Twenty- 
twenty was the safest election we have 
had in a long time. A record number of 
Americans cast a ballot that year— 
over 159 million people. As I have said 
already, there have been no indications 
that the result was anything less than 
free, fair, and accurate.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S92 
January 7, 2022 
But despite the fact that the 2020 
election was free, fair, and accurate, in 
the year following the 2020 election, at 
least 19 Republican-led legislatures 
suddenly decided to rewrite the rules 
that govern the way people vote in 
their respective States. At least 33 new 
laws have been passed across the coun-
try that will, as I will explain in a mo-
ment, have the effect of making it 
harder to vote, harder to register to 
vote, and, worst of all, potentially em-
power partisans to arbitrate outcomes 
of future elections instead of non-
partisan election workers. Hundreds— 
hundreds—more such laws were pro-
posed, and they may very well get en-
acted in the near future, particularly if 
we don’t act. 
Now, 
the 
Republican 
leader 
has 
pointed repeatedly to the 2020 election 
as proof that there was no effort to 
suppress the vote. This is nothing but a 
sleight of hand from the Republican 
leader. He ignores that the problem 
today is not about what happened dur-
ing the 2020 election, it is what hap-
pened after. 
So, I say to Leader MCCONNELL, when 
you say there was no problem in 2020, 
then why do we need to change it? And 
why do you ignore all the changes that 
are occurring after 2020? It is sophistry. 
Let me say it one more time. It is 
amazing. The Republican leader has ar-
gued that the 2020 election is proof 
there is no effort to suppress the vote 
in America, but it is not what hap-
pened during 2020 that we are arguing, 
although Donald Trump called 2020 
‘‘the Big Lie.’’ Mr. MCCONNELL is con-
tradicting him, although he never does 
it directly, for many different non-
admirable reasons. 
So any objective observer will admit 
that different rules have made it hard-
er for people to vote, but the danger is 
not then, it is what the States have 
done after the 2020 election, even 
though some States tried to do it be-
fore. 
We need to be clear. The timing, the 
sheer volume, and the nature of these 
new election laws is not an innocent 
coincidence. It didn’t just happen, 
springing up in each State on its own. 
No. Over the course of the year, we 
have kept hearing the same justifica-
tion for many of these laws. State Re-
publicans said we need to preserve 
‘‘election integrity’’ over and over 
again. They said we need to safeguard 
against voter fraud. 
But take a look at the actual policies 
that are now law, and tell me if you 
think they have anything to do with 
election integrity: Reducing polling 
hours and polling places within a 
State? That is now the law in Iowa, 
Montana, and Texas. What does that 
have to do with election integrity? 
Limiting the number, location, or 
availability of absentee ballot drop 
boxes—now the law in Georgia, Indi-
ana, and Florida—what does that have 
to do with election integrity? 
Making it harder to register to vote, 
that is now the law in Texas, Florida, 
Kansas, Iowa, New Hampshire, and 
Montana; shortening the window to 
apply for a mail-in ballots, now the law 
in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Iowa, 
and Kentucky; and the use of risky or 
potentially faulty voter purges, now 
the law in Arizona, Iowa, Kentucky, 
Louisiana, 
Texas, 
Utah, 
and 
New 
Hampshire; increasing barriers for vot-
ers with disabilities, that is now the 
law in Alabama, Iowa, and Texas— 
which passed not one but two laws 
which will have that effect. 
Telling disabled people it is going to 
be harder for you to vote, what does 
that have to do with election integ-
rity? 
Here is an especially egregious one: 
limiting early voting days or hours— 
Georgia, Iowa, Texas. And, of course, 
as many have condemned for months, 
criminalizing giving food and water to 
voters waiting in line to vote. That is 
now the law in Georgia and Florida. 
When Republicans say it is a crime to 
give voters some food or water in line, 
do they think they are preventing 
fraud by denying people a snack? 
Kafkaesque—Kafka 
was 
writing 
about the demise of democracy. 
Now, in addition to these new laws 
that are actually on the books, we also 
need to remember all the proposals 
they have tried to pass but have not 
been able to do to date. They tell us all 
we need to know about the true inten-
tions of these reforms, these so-called 
proposed laws. 
The most reprehensible were, of 
course, the attempts in States like 
Georgia and Texas to eliminate early 
voting on Sunday—a day, of course, 
when many churchgoing African Amer-
icans participate in ‘‘souls to the 
polls.’’ Did they show that Sunday vot-
ing is more fraudulent than other vot-
ing? No. We know what they are up to. 
What an astonishing coincidence, 
outlawing voting on a day when Afri-
can-American churches sponsor a get- 
out-the-vote effort. Have they shown 
that using drop-off ballot boxes creates 
more fraud than other? No. These are 
aimed at suppressing certain types of 
people from voting, not everybody. 
Policies like these have nothing to do 
with election integrity. When you say 
you can’t vote on Sunday, it is the 
same intention of those old restrictions 
that used to require African Americans 
to guess the number of jellybeans in a 
jar before they were allowed to cast a 
ballot. What regression. 
Now, 
of 
course, 
our 
Republican 
friends—many of them—reject these 
ideas. It is not a surprise. But every so 
often, they speak with astonishing and 
stunning honesty. As one State rep in 
Arizona 
said 
when 
defending 
his 
State’s efforts to defend Republican 
voting: Everyone shouldn’t be voting. 
That is what he said. I wonder who 
‘‘everyone’’ was? Indeed, he actually 
said, ‘‘We don’t mind putting security 
measures in that won’t let everybody 
vote—but everybody shouldn’t be vot-
ing.’’ 
And every now and then, the very 
plain and simple truth makes its way 
to the surface. 
When you lose an election, you are 
not supposed to stop people from vot-
ing, even if they didn’t vote for you. 
That is democracy, my Republican 
friends. That is democracy. If you lose 
an election, you are supposed to try 
harder to win over the voters you lost. 
Instead, Republicans across the coun-
try are trying to stop the other side 
from voting. That tears apart—rips 
apart—the very fabric of our democ-
racy. 
So let’s be abundantly clear. These 
anti-voter laws are on the books today 
only—only—because 
their 
authors 
cited the Big Lie and are trying to suc-
ceed where the insurrection failed. A 
slow-motion insurrection, that is all it 
is, equally, if not more damaging to 
our Republic. 
Section 
9: 
Election 
subversion. 
Disenfranchising millions of Americans 
is bad enough, but there is actually an-
other more sinister component to these 
laws, because Republicans aren’t just 
trying to suppress the vote, they are 
trying to subvert the vote. They are 
trying to subvert the very machinery 
of the Democratic process itself. 
It is not enough that they make it 
harder for people to vote; they are 
making it more likely that those who 
do vote could see—God forbid—their 
ballots called into question, subject to 
unwarranted and dangerous scrutiny, 
and maybe get thrown out entirely. 
In States like Arizona, Kansas, Ar-
kansas, Georgia, Republican legisla-
tures are trying to give more power to 
themselves and other partisan bodies 
to undermine, override, or neuter bi-
partisan election boards and county 
election officials. In a number of 
States, they have already succeeded. 
Last August, a report from ABC News 
noted that at least 10 new State laws 
have shifted power over elections from 
nonpartisan election officials to par-
tisan entities—from nonpartisan people 
to partisan entities. Why? It is obvious 
to figure that out. 
Here is what ABC News said: 
Among the dozens of election reform laws 
changing rules regarding how voters cast 
ballots, several have also diminished secre-
taries of states’ authority over elections or 
shifted aspects of election administration to 
highly partisan bodies, such as state legisla-
tors themselves or unevenly bipartisan elec-
tion boards. 
A separate report from Protect De-
mocracy, 
a 
nonprofit 
founded 
by 
former White House and DOJ officials, 
warned last summer that: 
Many state legislatures are pursuing a 
strategy to politicize, criminalize, and inter-
fere in election administration. Their course 
of action threatens the foundations of fair, 
professional, and non-partisan elections. 
Let’s go through some of the exam-
ples. In Arizona, ABC News reported 
last August that under a new law 
passed by the Republican legislature: 
The Arizona Democratic secretary of state, 
Katie Hobbs, can no longer represent the 
state in lawsuits defending its election code. 
The power now lies exclusively with the Re-
publican attorney general—but only through 
January 2, 2023, when [coincidentally] Hobbs’ 
term ends.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S93 
January 7, 2022 
That is now the law in Arizona. 
In Georgia, Secretary of State Brad 
Raffensperger has now been effectively 
fired from the State election board, 
months after refusing to go along with 
President Trump’s request to ‘‘find 
enough votes’’ to secure him a win. 
Appalling, my friends. Donald Trump 
calls up and asks the secretary of state 
of his own party to find enough votes. 
He gets fired, and they are all defend-
ing it or shrugging their shoulders or 
putting their heads in the sand. I have 
never seen anything quite like this. 
By the way, for those who don’t 
know, the State election board in Geor-
gia is responsible for, among other 
things—investigating voter irregular-
ities. Amazing, just amazing. 
There are other examples across the 
country. Let’s turn to Texas. 
According to the Voting Rights Lab, 
a particularly sinister new policy is 
now the law in that State: 
The recently-enacted election omnibus 
bill, S.B. 1, prohibits local officials from 
modifying election procedures to better 
serve voters. It also increases the likelihood 
of partisan poll watchers disrupting polling 
places and ballot verification and counting 
locations. The bill increased the ability of 
poll watchers to move freely throughout an 
election location, including areas containing 
voters waiting in line, checking in, or cast-
ing their ballots. 
Again, it is helpful to look at those 
pernicious proposals that were intro-
duced at the State level but to date 
have not been enacted into law. 
One bill in Arizona would have given 
flat out to the State legislature the au-
thority to cancel the certification of 
electors by a simple majority vote. 
So looking through the record, the 
conclusion is not in doubt. Republicans 
across the board justify these new laws 
by saying they want to make it easier 
to vote but harder to cheat, but when 
you are looking at what they are actu-
ally doing, it is perfectly clear that 
they are doing the opposite—the exact 
opposite—making it harder to vote and 
easier to steal an election. 
And this, my friends, is just the tip 
of the iceberg. These State legislatures 
will soon return to session this year 
and keep going, all importuned by Don-
ald Trump’s Big Lie. 
And what is missing is the profile in 
courage—enough profiles in courage— 
enough people, whether it is in this 
Senate Chamber, in the House Cham-
ber, in the legislatures on the Repub-
lican side, saying: I want to be a Re-
publican. I want Republicans to win, 
but I am not going to stoop to this 
level of beginning to dismember our de-
mocracy. 
Let’s make a final crucial point 
about what we are seeing playing out 
in the States. Everything I just de-
scribed at the State level is being done 
on a partisan basis. This is a Repub-
lican con job, with zero efforts being 
made to get any input from Democrats. 
Should State Republican legislatures 
keep going? Should we in this Chamber 
fail to do something about it or re-
spond with insufficient force, our de-
mocracy could very well cross a fatal 
point of no return. 
And then the unthinkable becomes 
real. Democracy erodes and could—hor-
ror of horrors—vanish, as it has in 
other nations in the course of world 
history. What history shows us is, 
when these pernicious activities start, 
when a mob starts, when a leader just 
lies to gain power, if people don’t rise 
up, it happens. 
America, don’t be complacent. It is 
happening, and it is a great danger. In 
many other countries that devolved to 
dictatorship, it started in ways similar 
to this, and the majority of good people 
said, ‘‘Uh, we don’t have to worry 
about it.’’ 
Well, we do. That is why we are here. 
That is why Senator MERKLEY and I 
and KLOBUCHAR and DURBIN and others 
have taken to the floor today. 
Section 10: The Senate will vote 
again on voting rights. 
So what is the way forward? Do we 
accept these developments as inevi-
table? Do we say it is not so bad? Do we 
look the other way? Do we tell our-
selves this dark cloud will pass and the 
disease of the Big Lie is just going to 
cure itself? 
We can’t. The risk is too great. 
What we must do is remember the 
words of our great friend, John Lewis, 
who shortly before his death said: 
When you see something that is not right, 
you must say something. You must do some-
thing. Democracy is not a state. It is an act, 
and each generation must do its part to help 
build what we called the Beloved Commu-
nity. . . . 
Well, right now, the Senate is being 
called to take action. So as soon as 
next week, we intend to bring up legis-
lation back to the floor of this Cham-
ber, to protect our democracy and 
shore up the right to vote. Everyone in 
this Chamber will once again have the 
opportunity to go on record. 
Will Republicans join Democrats in a 
bipartisan manner moving forward on 
defending democracy? As soon as next 
week, they will be called on to give us 
an answer, and they know the eyes of 
history are watching. Maybe the few 
ideologues don’t, but most of them do— 
most of them do. 
And 
next 
week, 
our 
Republican 
friends will be called to give us an an-
swer. If there is any fight that this 
body should know how to win, it is pro-
tecting our democracy and strength-
ening our right to vote. 
Throughout this Chamber’s history, 
in the aftermath of the Civil War, dur-
ing the 1960s, throughout the second 
half of the 20th century, passing voting 
rights legislation has been one of the 
Senate’s crowning achievements. And 
now, in this moment of peril for democ-
racy, the Senate now needs to work to 
pass the Freedom to Vote Act. We need 
to work to pass the John Lewis Voting 
Rights Advancement Act. 
We must get both done so we can 
send these bills to President Biden’s 
desk and they be signed into law—pre-
venting, undoing, the pernicious activi-
ties that I have documented in the past 
hour. 
For months—for months—we have 
tried to get our Republican colleagues 
to join us. After all, voting rights 
should not be partisan. It hasn’t been 
in the past. It has been supported by 
Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, 
George W. Bush—hardly big liberals, 
hardly Democratic sympathizers—oh, 
no. 
We have tried to continue in that bi-
partisan spirit. We have tried no less 
than four times to begin a simple de-
bate here on the floor about this mat-
ter. We have lobbied our Republican 
friends 
privately. 
We 
have 
gone 
through regular order. We have at-
tempted to debate them on the floor. 
We have presented reasonable, com-
monsense proposals in June, August, 
October, and November. Each time— 
each time—I personally promised my 
Republican colleagues and my Demo-
cratic colleagues, particularly the two 
who have some doubts, that they would 
have ample opportunities to voice their 
concerns, offer germane amendments, 
and make changes to our proposals. At 
no point did we ever ask our Repub-
lican friends to vote for our legislation. 
We have simply been asking them to 
begin debating, just as the Senate was 
intended to do. 
Off the floor, we have held public 
hearings, group discussions with Sen-
ators, and one-on-one meetings with 
the other side to try to win some sup-
port. Senators MANCHIN and KAINE and 
TESTER and KING and DURBIN and KLO-
BUCHAR
and LEAHY
and many more 
have all met with Republicans to ini-
tiate a dialogue. At every turn, we 
have been met with resistance. Next 
week, we will try again. They will go 
on record again. But, of course, ob-
struction is all we have been able to 
see so far. 
As an aside, one of the arguments we 
hear from the other side is that this is 
an attempt at a Federal takeover of 
our elections. The sophistry, the dis-
honesty is legion. 
The Founders, whom my Republican 
colleagues invoke when it is time to 
confirm a rightwing judge, wrote in the 
Constitution that the Congress pre-
cisely has the power to pass laws to de-
termine the time, place, and manner of 
Federal elections. This is nothing new. 
We have done it over and over again 
with amendments and with legisla-
tion—bipartisan. 
The problem isn’t simply that they 
oppose our proposals for voting rights 
legislation. They now even refuse to 
support legislation they embraced in 
the past, including the policies in the 
John Lewis Voting Rights Advance-
ment Act. 
Remember, the Voting Rights Act 
was reauthorized five times through its 
history, including by Presidents Nixon, 
Reagan, and Bush. 
Many of my Republican colleagues 
have worked in the past to improve 
preclearance provisions similar to the 
ones contained in our latest proposal.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S94 
January 7, 2022 
If it was good enough for Republicans 
back then—Republicans who were true 
conservatives—it 
should 
be 
good 
enough for our Republican friends 
today. But they won’t even support 
that. In fact, they won’t even support a 
vote to open debate. 
The sole exception in 10 months has 
been our colleague, the Senator from 
Alaska—once on four votes. But where 
is the rest of the party of Abraham 
Lincoln? Down to the last Member, the 
rest of the Republican conference has 
refused to engage, refused to debate, 
even refused to acknowledge that our 
country faces a serious threat to de-
mocracy. 
Leader 
MCCONNELL, 
this 
week, 
seemed to refer to laws I talked about 
earlier as mainstream here on the 
floor. What is he talking about? Maybe 
they are mainstream in failed democ-
racies, but his proposals are unaccept-
able in the United States. 
So it is clear that the modern Repub-
lican Party has turned its back on pro-
tecting voting rights. The party of Lin-
coln is increasingly becoming the party 
of the Big Lie, not just Donald Trump 
but just everybody here, with the rare 
exception. 
Section 11: Restore the Senate. The 
Senate is better than this. A simple 
look at our history shows we are better 
than this. The same institution that 
passed civil rights legislation, the New 
Deal, the Great Society, and the bills 
of Reconstruction, should be more than 
capable of defending democracy in the 
modern era. But, today, the partisan-
ship, the Big Lie, the looming specter 
of Donald Trump and his vindictive-
ness, his dishonesty, is a shadow that is 
cast over this entire Chamber and leads 
to the gridlock we have. 
This Chamber is not capable of func-
tioning when one side’s strategy for 
legislation is inflexible, total, unthink-
ing, unwilling to admit fact and actu-
ally making up lies to buttress the Big 
Lie, such as that the Federal Govern-
ment shouldn’t be involved in how Fed-
eral offices are voted for. 
The Senate is no longer a cooling 
saucer. It is a deep freezer. Anyone who 
has been here for more than a few 
years knows the gears of the Senate 
have ossified. The filibuster is used far 
more today than ever before—by some 
measures, the filibuster is used as 
much as 10 times today compared to 
the past decade. My colleague from Or-
egon is an expert on this, and my guess 
is he will speak on it. 
Some might wonder if any of the 
great accomplishments of the past 
would have had a chance of passage 
today. Would the Social Security Act 
pass the modern Senate? Medicare and 
Medicaid? Civil rights? We sure hope 
they would, but it is difficult to see 
with the way the Chamber works this 
day. 
As I have said since the fall, if this 
sort of obstruction will continue, I be-
lieve the Senate needs to be restored to 
its rightful status as the world’s great-
est deliberative body. It was that in 
the past. It is certainly, certainly, not 
that now. It earned that title precisely 
because, yes, debate is a central fea-
ture of this body and always will be. 
But at the end of the day, so is gov-
erning, so is taking action when needed 
once the debate has run its due course. 
This is an old, old fight in this Cham-
ber. Over 100 years ago, the great Sen-
ator of Massachusetts, Henry Cabot 
Lodge, said that ‘‘to vote without de-
bating is perilous, but to debate and 
never vote is imbecile.’’ 
‘‘To vote without debating is per-
ilous, but to debate and never vote is 
imbecile.’’ We should heed those words 
today, and Democrats are currently ex-
ploring the paths we have available to 
restore the Senate so it does what the 
Framers intended: debate, deliberate, 
compromise, and end in the vote. 
As I said in my ‘‘Dear colleague’’ ear-
lier this week, if Republicans continue 
to hijack the rules of the Chamber to 
prevent us from protecting our democ-
racy, then the Senate will debate and 
consider changes to the rules on or be-
fore January 17, Martin Luther King, 
Jr., Day. 
As we hold this debate, I ask my col-
leagues to consider this question: If the 
right to vote is the cornerstone of our 
democracy, then how can Democrats 
permit a situation in which Repub-
licans can pass voter suppression laws 
at the State-level with only a simple 
majority vote but not allow the U.S. 
Senate to do the same? 
This asymmetry cannot hold. If Sen-
ate Republicans continue to abuse the 
filibuster to prevent this body from 
acting, then I would plead with the 
Senate, particularly my colleagues on 
this side of the aisle, to adapt. And we 
must adapt for the sake of our democ-
racy so we can pass the legislation I 
talked about earlier. 
In conclusion—the last section—now, 
as I near the end of my remarks, let me 
appeal to an important moment from 
history. In the aftermath of the Civil 
War and as the Nation began the colos-
sal work of Reconstruction, America 
was more divided than at any point in 
history. I am reading Grant’s biog-
raphy now. That is clear. It was hard to 
imagine that a single nation could en-
dure after the bloody conflict of the 
previous 4 years. 
At the time, the Congress set to work 
on granting newly freed slaves the 
basic freedoms that had long been de-
nied to them. Back then, it was the 
party of Lincoln, which a century and 
a half later bears little resemblance to 
what we see among their ranks today. 
These freedoms were eventually en-
shrined federally in the 14th and 15th 
Amendments, granting due process and 
the right to vote to all citizens, regard-
less of color or race. 
Today, these amendments rank as 
some of the greatest and most revered 
accomplishments in congressional his-
tory. They are proof that our country 
is capable of living up to its founding 
promise, if—if—we are willing to put in 
the work. 
But at the time, the minority party 
in both Chambers refused to offer a sin-
gle vote—a single vote—for any one of 
the civil rights legislations put forth 
during Reconstruction—not one vote, 
not one vote. And it was, of course, the 
Democratic Party that was not offer-
ing the vote. They argued these bills 
represented nothing more than the par-
tisan interest of a majority—a power 
grab, they said, if you will, from venge-
ful northerners. 
But that didn’t stop the majority. If 
basic freedoms meant going it alone, 
they knew they had to do it. 
To the patriots after the Civil War, 
this wasn’t partisan. It was patriotic, 
and the American democracy is better 
off today because the patriots in this 
Chamber at the time were undeterred 
by minority obstruction. 
On this day—on this day—the day 
after we mark the 1-year anniversary 
of an armed insurrection at the U.S. 
Capitol, rooted in the Big Lie that is 
eroding our democracy, the question 
before the Senate is, How will we find 
a path forward on protecting our free-
doms in the 21st century? 
Members of this body now face a 
choice. They can follow in the foot-
steps of our patriotic predecessors in 
this Chamber or they can sit by, just as 
the segregationist-oriented Democrats 
in the post-Civil War era did it, and try 
to have democracy unravel. 
I do not believe that we want our de-
mocracy to unravel. I do not believe it 
is the ultimate destiny of this country. 
It is a grand country—as the Founding 
Fathers called it, ‘‘God’s noble experi-
ment.’’ 
I believe—I truly believe—our democ-
racy will long endure after these latest 
attacks. I believe that because of what 
I said at the very beginning of my re-
marks: The long history of this coun-
try is a long march toward expanding 
our democracy, toward making more 
perfect what our Founders sought to 
establish. 
It took millions of Americans hun-
dreds of years to make this country 
what it is today—Americans of every 
age and color and creed who marched 
and protested, who stood up and sat in; 
Americans who died defending democ-
racy in its darkest and lowest hours. 
On Memorial Day in 1884, Oliver Wen-
dell Holmes told his war-weary audi-
ence that ‘‘whether [one] accepts from 
Fortune her spade, and will look down-
ward and dig, or from Aspiration her 
axe and cord, and will scale the ice, the 
one and only one success which it is 
[yours] to command is to bring to 
[your] work a mighty heart.’’ 
I have confidence that Americans of 
a different generation—our generation, 
those of us in this Chamber—will bring 
to our work a mighty heart: to fight 
for what is right, to fight for the truth, 
to never lose faith, and to protect the 
precious gift handed down to us by 
those brilliant Framers. And by the 
grace of God, I know that our democ-
racy shall not perish in this hour but 
rather endure today, tomorrow, and for 
generations to come.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S95 
January 7, 2022 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. WAR-
NER). The Senator from Oregon. 
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I am 
pleased to be here with my colleagues 
today to emphasize the incredible im-
portance of voting rights as the foun-
dation for our democratic Republic: 
Senator KLOBUCHAR of Minnesota, who 
spoke with the perspective of the chair 
of our Rules Committee and her experi-
ence in her State of Minnesota; Sen-
ator DURBIN, who so understands the 
challenges from his decades of public 
service and service in this Chamber; 
Senator 
KAINE
of 
Virginia, 
who 
brought forth some of the challenges 
over time that have existed targeting 
Black Americans; and Senator SCHU-
MER, who just took us on a tour 
through history, bringing us to that 
point of saying: Let’s make sure that 
our democratic Republic does not per-
ish, that it endures; that that responsi-
bility sits on our shoulders. 
Mr. President, there are more than 
4,500 words in the Constitution, but the 
three that matter most are the first 
three: ‘‘We the People.’’ Our Founders 
printed those words in supersize font, 
saying this is what it is all about, that 
we do not take our government’s power 
and authority in America as descended 
from Kings or the elite or the powerful; 
that our government takes its author-
ity and power from the people up. And 
that is accomplished through the bal-
lot box. 
We are a nation with a government, 
as President Lincoln so eloquently 
said, ‘‘of the people, by the people, and 
for the people.’’ That is why the ballot 
box is the beating heart of our democ-
racy. It is the ballot box that is the 
physical manifestation of every Ameri-
can’s sacred right to have a voice in 
their government through their vote 
because, as Lyndon Johnson told us, 
‘‘The vote is the most powerful instru-
ment ever devised . . . for breaking 
down injustice.’’ 
For 245 years, since our Declaration 
of Independence, through war and de-
pression, through civil strife and ter-
rorist attack, our democracy has per-
severed. 
It 
has 
weathered 
storms. 
Through those storms, it has continued 
to shine as a beacon of light to the 
world, as Ronald Reagan so fondly 
spoke of it, to serve as a beautiful, 
shining city on the hill. 
All the while, through generation 
after generation, we have worked to ex-
pand access to the ballot box, recog-
nizing that the vision of the Constitu-
tion wasn’t fulfilled until every Amer-
ican had the ability to exercise their 
right to vote. And for most of our lives 
in this generation, we haven’t really 
worried about the strength of our 
democratic institutions. 
We 
have 
read 
about 
Presidents 
around the world writing a new con-
stitution and throwing the old out 
without process, of wiping out the 
clause that limited them to two terms 
or to one term and continuing on, of 
shows that were put on in terms of leg-
islative function that was just a cover 
story for authoritarian power. 
But, here, we have thought we have 
practiced for more than 200 years con-
verting the power of the people into 
representative democracy and deci-
sions made through the House and the 
Senate and the President of the United 
States. We took for granted that they 
worked because they had worked for 
generation after generation, election 
after election, year after year. 
But now, in recent years, we have 
come to realize that we shouldn’t have 
taken the strength of our institutions 
for granted. We have come to see all 
too clearly that these institutions are 
fragile. We have seen the relentless ef-
forts to undermine faith in our institu-
tions. We have seen the attacks on our 
free press. We have seen the siloing of 
channels of information into different 
24-hour cable news networks, and we 
have seen the echo chamber of social 
media. 
We have experienced the impact that 
has occurred attacking the basic right 
to vote being torn away by the highest 
Court in the land, to political leaders 
deliberately lying to and deceiving the 
American people, and fanning the 
flames of hate and bigotry, of division 
and discrimination, for their political 
gain. 
Then, just over a year ago, we saw it 
culminate in a violent mob of extrem-
ists stirred up and unleashed by a man 
who couldn’t face the reality of his 
electoral loss, and that mob stormed 
this very building to stop the wheels of 
democracy from turning. 
I was sitting here in this Chamber, 
and I well remember the agents rush-
ing down the center aisle up to the po-
dium to sweep away the Vice President 
to safety, wondering why they were 
running down the aisle because that 
doesn’t happen here in the Senate. We 
heard the sounds of people outside 
these doors and wondered what was 
going on. We saw our Sergeant at Arms 
team start to lock the doors of this 
Chamber—all of it in just an extraor-
dinary moment. Then, because we have 
smartphones, we started to understand 
what was going on outside of the Cap-
itol and inside of the Capitol. 
Later, we learned of the incredibly 
valiant acts of an officer named Eu-
gene Goodman, who, as the first wave 
of the mob ascended the staircase that 
is just outside the Chamber in this di-
rection, proceeded to essentially chal-
lenge the leader of that group, shoving 
him slightly and backing up away— 
down that hallway to move the mob 
away from entering the double doors 
that were closer by, buying more time 
for the security of this Chamber. 
It is hard to believe that men and 
women in this building were chanting 
for the death of NANCY PELOSI and the 
death of the Vice President of the 
United States of America, calling for 
him to be hanged. 
Because we started to understand the 
threat, I heard whispered phone calls 
to loved ones saying: I am OK. I think 
I am fine. 
We saw fear and pain in the eyes of 
some of our staff, who were simply 
doing their job to help our democracy 
function that day. 
We know how that day lingers in the 
hearts of our Capitol Police officers, 
and I continue to grieve with them for 
the trauma and loss they endured and 
to appreciate so much the service they 
rendered. 
The insurrectionists on January 6, 
2021, came all too close to stopping de-
mocracy in its tracks that day. Here in 
the Chamber, we were ushered into a 
safer location, and along with us went 
the three ballot boxes pictured here. 
This is a picture that I took when I 
was so pleased to see these ballot boxes 
had traveled with us to safety, because 
the mob did enter this Chamber, and 
had these boxes still been here in the 
well of the Senate, they would have 
opened them and they would have de-
stroyed those ballots because that was 
what they were intent on doing, was to 
destroy the ballots from various States 
to alter the outcome of the election. 
They couldn’t get to them because 
they were safe with us. 
These boxes were crafted by real art-
ists who work here in the Senate, and 
there was a new box, a larger box, be-
cause some of the States were sending 
larger certifications of the ballots, the 
electoral college ballots, from their 
State. 
Well, we were determined to return 
to the Chamber that evening, to come 
back here and reclaim this Chamber 
from the mob, replace these boxes in 
the well of the Senate, transport them 
to the House through the rhythm of 
counting the electoral college votes, 
and make sure the certification of the 
election went ahead. And it did. We 
completed our work, and the House and 
Senate certified the election results. 
The physical attack on our national 
temple, our revered Capitol Building, 
was intended to prevent the counting 
of ballots—the most important act 
marking the transfer of power from one 
President to the next. 
You know, our leaders in the early 
phase of our country weren’t sure that 
this system would survive. Would the 
first President of the United States de-
clare that he would continue beyond 
the bounds of the Constitution regard-
less of an election or prevent the elec-
tion from happening? It was one of the 
motivations behind supporting George 
Washington as the first President, be-
cause people had faith that he would 
honor the vision in that Constitution 
and set the rhythm for the generations 
that followed. And he did. 
So on January 6, 2021, 1 year and 1 
day ago, democracy held—barely, but 
it held. Although it held on that day, 
the attack on our Federal elections has 
continued nonstop through the year 
that has followed. 
This is the question we now face. In 
State after State, Republican legisla-
tures are erecting barriers to the ballot 
box to make it more difficult for spe-
cific groups of Americans to vote—

making it more difficult for Native 
Americans to vote, for Black Ameri-
cans to vote, and for college students 
to vote. It is our responsibility, in the 
face of these attacks on the right to 
vote, to say: Hell, no. We will not let 
any group in America be blocked from 
voting. 
We will guarantee the right of every 
citizen to exercise the most funda-
mental act of a citizen in democracy: 
the act of putting a ballot into a ballot 
box. That is why we must pass, without 
delay, the Freedom to Vote Act and 
the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. 
The 2020 election was free. It was 
fair. It was secure. In every analysis, in 
every court hearing, in every recount, 
in every audit, we have found that the 
election of 2020 was free and fair and 
secure. We have seen that proven time 
and time and time again. 
It was the most scrutinized election 
ever held in this country. It was also 
the election with the largest turnout 
ever in this country. More than 159 
million Americans cast a ballot. But 
instead of celebrating the integrity of 
that election—that beautiful display of 
democracy, the embodiment of the ‘‘we 
the people’’ Republic—some in our 
country have spent this past year try-
ing to undermine our Republic, to lie 
about it, to tear it down, to tear down 
what so many have worked and fought 
for, marched and sacrificed for over 245 
years. These forces cannot win by the 
power of their ideas so they want to 
change the rules. They want to rig the 
vote. 
So how do you do that? Well, the 
States make laws to make it harder to 
register to vote. The States make laws 
to allow those on the voting rolls to be 
thrown off without them even knowing 
they have been thrown off, to purge the 
voting rolls in a discriminatory fash-
ion. You make it harder for early vot-
ing. You make it harder to vote by 
mail, and the consequence of making 
early voting and vote-by-mail hard is 
you direct the voting to election day, 
and on election day, you have a set of 
time-tested tactics to block the ballot 
box. What are these tactics? 
Well, one, you understaff the precinct 
voting location so the line is very long 
in places where you don’t want people 
to vote. In Georgia, in the last elec-
tion, in those precincts, where the elec-
torate was 80 percent White, the wait 
time was an average of about 5 min-
utes. In those precincts where the elec-
torate was 80 percent Black, the wait 
time was about 50 minutes, or 10 times 
longer. This did not happen by acci-
dent. 
What else can be done? You move the 
location of the precinct voting location 
so people go to the wrong place in the 
places where you don’t want them to 
vote. You put them in places where 
there isn’t much parking so they have 
to walk a long way to get to the poll-
ing place. You let the machines mal-
function and have no one around to fix 
them to increase the length of the line. 
You ban volunteers from giving food 
and water to the people who are stand-
ing in line, hour after hour after hour. 
You put out text messages saying, ‘‘We 
are so sorry you missed the vote last 
week,’’ when, in truth, the vote is the 
next Tuesday coming, but you make 
people think they missed the vote so 
they won’t show up or you put out mes-
sages saying, ‘‘We hope you will vote 
on this day,’’ which is a week after the 
real vote so people don’t show up on 
election day. 
All of these things happen. And when 
I read about them happening, I think 
about how important early voting and 
vote-by-mail are. If you want to look 
at ballots being stolen—the right to 
vote being stolen, the corruption of 
voting—look to these corrupt activities 
on election day. Those are stealing the 
votes. That is where the crime is being 
committed, and that is the crime we 
need to stop. 
Now, in Oregon, we were the first 
State to have vote-by-mail. And it 
started with the Republican Party say-
ing: Let’s get everybody signed up for 
absentee ballots because we know we 
can increase turnout. And then the 
Democrats said: That is a really good 
idea. Let’s get all our folks to sign up 
for absentee ballots. 
So when I first ran for the State leg-
islature, half the State was voting by 
absentee ballot, and half was voting at 
the polls. And then in the next elec-
tion, the State said: We liked voting by 
absentee ballot so much, let’s give 
vote-by-mail to everyone. And it was 
embraced by both parties. 
And I remember going door-to-door 
and people telling me: We really love 
not having to worry about the chal-
lenges of election day—of parking; of 
weather; I have a bad hip, and I can’t 
stand in line; I have to pick up my chil-
dren after I get off work, and I won’t 
have time to stand in line. 
Why did President Trump attack 
vote-by-mail? He hated vote-by-mail 
because it takes away the cheating on 
election day that he feels can be imple-
mented to benefit Republicans across 
this country. President Trump is the 
primary proponent of cheating Ameri-
cans out of their right to vote. 
This Chamber has to act. We are see-
ing the strategies unfold in State after 
State. Last year, 440 bills were intro-
duced in multitudinous States aimed 
at restricting the freedom to vote. 
Thirty-four of those bills have been 
passed into law in 19 States, restricting 
access to the ballot box, threatening 
the integrity of our elections. 
The first week of this new year, 13 
bills were filed in Arizona and New 
Hampshire. Eighty-eight bills were in-
troduced last year that are carrying 
over into the 2022 legislative session in 
nine States, including swing States 
like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. 
We can see how prevalent the activ-
ity is. Now, when we were wrestling 
with the right to vote in the 1960s, it 
was primarily a challenge of the South-
ern United States using strategies tar-
geted at Black Americans. But now, we 
have a challenge of strategies being en-
acted across the country targeting 
Black Americans and Native Ameri-
cans and young Americans. 
So let’s take a look at this, at some 
of the key swing States. Arizona—for 
over a decade, voters have been mailed 
a ballot. 
Now, currently, if you are an infre-
quent voter, and you don’t vote early 
in two election cycles, you can be re-
moved from the permanent early vot-
ing list—meaning you no longer auto-
matically receive that ballot, meaning 
that you are expecting it, but you don’t 
get it. When you realize that you have 
to get to the polls, it may be too late, 
making it harder for targeted voters to 
vote by having discriminatory purging 
of the voting rolls. 
Seventy percent of Arizonans are on 
that 
permanent 
early 
voting 
list. 
Eighty percent of Arizona voters cast a 
ballot by mail in 2020. 
It is estimated that under this law, 
200,000 voters in the State of Arizona 
might be removed from the list, and 
many of them will not realize they 
have been removed until it is too late. 
Think about how significant that is 
in a State that President Biden won by 
less than 11,000 votes. 
What else in Arizona? You have the 
power being taken away of the sec-
retary of state to control election liti-
gation, to defend the ballot box, and it 
is being moved to the attorney general. 
Now, why would Arizona move it 
from the secretary of state, where it 
has always been, to the attorney gen-
eral? Well, they are moving it because 
the secretary of state is a Democrat 
and the attorney general is a Repub-
lican and they want a partisan angle 
on enforcement of voting laws. 
I will tell you one bill that hasn’t 
been enacted that really is something 
very scary to think about. It says, es-
sentially, that the legislature can re-
voke the certification of the State’s 
Presidential 
election 
by 
majority 
vote—meaning the State might vote 
for one person, but the legislature, 
which is Republican, could then vote to 
assign the electors to the person that 
the legislature wants instead of whom 
the people of that State want. 
That is an incredible—incredible— 
perversion and shows you how far this 
conversation is going to create par-
tisan control of the outcome. The elec-
tion was won fair and square by one 
person, and the State legislature says: 
Too bad, we are assigning our electoral 
votes to the other person. 
Florida—Florida has enacted an om-
nibus election bill. It attacks mail-in 
voting. It requires voters to contin-
ually renew their request for a mail-in 
ballot. It used to be that that was once 
every 4 years, but now it is continuous. 
One-third of Floridians voted by mail 
in 2018. One-half mailed in their ballots 
in 2020. An overwhelming majority of 
those were Democrats. So if you take 
away vote-by-mail, the thought is you 
can warp the outcome of the election. 
Their omnibus bill puts up restric-
tions on drop boxes, requiring them to

be supervised in person. They make it 
hard to drop off your ballots. And the 
goal, of course, is if you make it harder 
to drop off ballots, maybe that ballot 
will sit on your kitchen counter and 
never get filed and never, therefore, 
have an impact. And Florida, like 
Georgia, has stopped volunteers from 
handing out food and water to voters 
waiting in long lines. 
Every time I hear that, I think: Are 
we not familiar with the story of the 
good Samaritan who goes down the 
road, and he sees someone beaten up by 
the side of the road and goes over to 
help that individual and gets them to 
safety and covers the expenses for their 
lodging and their food? Well, here, good 
Samaritans are being outlawed from 
providing food and water to people 
trapped in line for a long period of 
time. 
That is not just in Florida but in 
Georgia too. So let’s turn to Georgia. 
They enacted legislation that attacks 
early voting. It eliminates 5 weeks of 
early voting in runoff elections—5 
weeks. Over 1.3 million people voted in 
2021’s runoffs in Georgia that brought 
Senators Warnock and Ossoff here to 
the Senate. It attacks voting registra-
tion. 
You can’t register to vote when a 
runoff election is occurring. You have 
to already have registered for the gen-
eral election. And why did they do 
that? Because 70,000 people registered 
to vote during the 2021 runoffs, and 
more Democrats than Republicans reg-
istered in that period. So, preju-
dicially, they want to cut that off. 
They want to virtually eliminate the 
drop boxes. They are relied on far more 
in the urban Atlanta metro area than 
in rural counties. And the law says you 
can have no more than one drop box for 
every 100,000 registered voters, mean-
ing that four counties that make up 
the greater Atlanta metro area will 
now only have about 20 drop boxes, a 
reduction to one-fifth of the drop boxes 
that were there before. 
About half of the absentee voters in 
the Atlanta metro area used those drop 
boxes. And then it says those drop 
boxes have to be inside early voting 
sites, meaning that they are only 
available during the hours those early 
voting sites are open. So if you are 
going to work at 6 a.m., you can’t drop 
off your ballot. And if you are getting 
home and picking up your kids and get-
ting home past 5 p.m., or whatever the 
early voting sites close, then you can’t 
vote then either by dropping off your 
ballot at a ballot box. 
Cobb 
County 
Elections 
Director 
Janine Eveler said, and refers to the 
boxes: 
They are no longer useful. The limited 
numbers mean you cannot deploy them in 
significant numbers to reach the voting pop-
ulation. 
In Georgia, also, the law gives power 
to interfere directly with people’s 
votes. The legislature has been given 
power—the partisan legislature has 
been given power—over the State elec-
tion board, and the State election 
board can replace the local election 
boards and, thereby, influence how 
they behave to the benefit of the Re-
publican Party. It also gives ability of 
an individual to challenge countless 
numbers of voters’ rights to cast a bal-
lot. 
To sum up, in Georgia, they are mak-
ing it harder to get a ballot in the 
mail. They are making it easier to in-
timidate voters at the polls, and they 
are making it easier to rig the results 
after the votes have been cast. 
How about Iowa? Iowa enacted omni-
bus election legislation that attacks 
early voting and takes away 9 days of 
early voting. It reduces it by a third, 29 
to 20 days. It attacks in-person voting. 
As Senator KLOBUCHAR pointed out, 
it says you have to close the polls an 
hour earlier, making it harder for peo-
ple who work late in the evening to be 
able to vote. It attacks vote-by-mail. 
Let’s turn to Montana. Montana has 
enacted HB 176, which eliminates same- 
day registration. It has been in place 
for 15 years. Nearly 8,200 Montanans 
used that option on election day in 
2020—but, prejudicially, wiped out. 
SB 169 also, as a matter of fact, re-
quires voters who do not have certain 
specified IDs to get two forms of ID in 
order to vote at the polls, making it 
harder to vote at the polls. 
HB 50, also enacted, prohibits the 
mailing of ballots to new voters who 
are eligible to vote on election day but 
are not yet 18, an attack on younger 
voters. Why? Because younger voters 
tend to vote more often for the Demo-
cratic candidate. 
And SB 319 bans voter registration 
activities on public college campus 
buildings such as dorms, study halls, 
and athletic facilities, an absolute at-
tack on the ability of college students 
to vote. Why? Because they tend to 
vote more Democratic. 
This strategy of deliberately attack-
ing the ability to vote of young Ameri-
cans, college students, Native Ameri-
cans, and Black Americans to vote is 
so wrong. It is unethical. It violates 
the very premise of our Constitution, 
which gives every American the right— 
the equal right—to participate. 
New Hampshire—in one new law, the 
secretary of state is enabled to make 
up their own system of confirming 
voter residency so that it is easier to 
take voters off the rolls. Why is that 
important? Well, the Republican legis-
lature is going to choose the secretary 
of state in New Hampshire, and ideas 
have been floated in regard to ‘‘Let’s 
require residency to be written so that 
your car has to be registered here if 
you are a student who is here.’’ And 
students can’t afford to reregister the 
car; so students won’t be able to vote— 
another attack on college students, as 
an example. 
Texas—Texas attacks the drop boxes. 
The new law eliminates ballot drop 
boxes for 16 million voters—16 million. 
The Governor limited counties to just 
one drop box in 2020. The 4.7 million 
residents in Harris County, where 
Houston is located, have to share one 
drop box for a population equal to the 
entire population of Louisiana. It stops 
127,000 voters in Harris County who 
availed themselves of curbside voting 
to avail themselves of curbside voting 
in the future. The legislature elimi-
nated it. 
I think the point should be ade-
quately clear at this moment that in 
State after State after State, Repub-
lican legislators and Republican-con-
trolled legislatures are creating preju-
dicial laws to block Democratic con-
stituencies—constituencies that tend 
to favor the Democratic Party—from 
voting. This is completely unaccept-
able, and it is up to us to defend the 
rights of every American to vote. 
Now, there are three States where 
the Republicans control the House and 
the Senate but not the Governorship: 
Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, North Caro-
lina. And we know that changes may 
well happen there in 2 years. Those 
Governors may be gone. Last year, the 
Democratic Governor of Wisconsin ve-
toed six bills that would have severely 
restricted citizens’ ability to vote. So 
who knows what is going to come next? 
Now, some have said: You know, all 
these measures won’t make that big a 
difference. Don’t worry about it. 
Well, I can tell you, those who say 
that are wrong. Let’s think about how 
it would affect this Senate. Let’s say 
those measures could make a 3-percent 
difference in the outcome of the bal-
loting. If that were the case, then we 
would have seven Democratic Senators 
who are here today who would not have 
been here. It wouldn’t be a 50–50 Sen-
ate; it would be a 57–43. Senator OSSOFF 
won by 1.2 percent; Senator PETERS of 
Michigan, 1.7 percent; Senator KELLY 
of 
Arizona, 
2.4 
percent; 
Senator 
KYRSTEN SINEMA of Arizona, 2.4 per-
cent; Senator HASSAN of New Hamp-
shire, 0.1 percent; Senator CORTEZ 
MASTO, 2.4 percent, Nevada. Seven Sen-
ators would not be here today if you 
changed the outcome by 3 percent. 
There is a huge difference between a 
50–50 Senate and a 57–43. 
That is what this is about. It is about 
the targeting of swing States by Re-
publican legislatures to seize control of 
this body against the voting will of the 
citizens of the United States of Amer-
ica. 
This is why we have to set minimum 
standards that guarantee access to bal-
lot, minimum standards for vote-by- 
mail, minimum standards for early 
voting, minimum standards for reg-
istration, minimum standards so folks 
are not purged off the voting rolls 
without their knowledge. 
I think about democracy, which we 
sometimes assume is the path more 
traveled by countries around the world, 
and there was a period of a decade or 
two where we saw the birth of a lot of 
new democracies. Now, this last dec-
ade, we have seen many of them slide 
into 
authoritarianism 
around 
the 
world. The truth is, most of the world

is not governed by democracies. It is 
governed 
by 
authoritarian 
govern-
ments. Democracy is the road less 
traveled. It takes incredible vigilance 
to defend the ability of the citizen to 
participate. 
And here we are at that moment 
where we have to defend the ability of 
the citizen to participate. That vigi-
lance, that responsibility, that weight 
of preserving our ‘‘We the People’’ Re-
public is on our shoulders. So the Free-
dom to Vote Act needs to be passed to 
ensure 15 days of early voting; to en-
sure access to vote-by-mail; to provide 
relief for voters waiting in long lines; 
to ensure that poll workers exist in 
sufficient numbers for the polling 
places and have adequate training to 
operate them effectively; to take on 
gerrymandering 
through 
national 
standards so that the House of Rep-
resentatives, down this hallway outside 
this door, reflects the will of the people 
instead of being rigged for the power-
ful. 
And the bill is needed to take on 
dark money, money no one knows 
where it comes from. If you or I do-
nated $100 to a campaign, it is re-
corded. Everyone knows that we do-
nated that money. But if the billion-
aire spends tens of millions or hun-
dreds of millions of dollars, it is done 
in secret, dark money. Americans of 
every political entity—Democratic, Re-
publican, Independent—know this is 
corrupt, know that it shouldn’t happen, 
know that the same things should 
apply to the billionaire as to the ordi-
nary citizen. 
We need to pass the Freedom to Vote 
Act, and we need to pass the John 
Lewis Voting Rights bill. That bill re-
stores preclearance. The 1965 bill, the 
Voting Rights Act, was a preclearance 
bill. It said that those States that have 
conducted violations of the rights of 
citizens to vote can’t change election 
laws without getting them precleared 
to make sure they are not prejudicial 
on the basis of race. 
The Supreme Court has gutted that. 
The Supreme Court has operated as a 
supreme legislature of the land and de-
cided it wanted to legislate out what 
this body and the House of Representa-
tives passed overwhelmingly in a bipar-
tisan fashion. 
The 2013 Shelby County decision 
opened the floodgates to voter suppres-
sion and voter repression with laws 
like the ones I have been talking 
about. Preclearance protects us against 
those corrupt strategies that are yet to 
come, while the Freedom to Vote Act 
protects us against the activities that 
have already occurred. We need to do 
both. 
All of us, Democrats and Repub-
licans, should be working together as 
the two parties did in 1965, as they did 
each and every time to renew author-
ization of the Voting Rights Act, until 
now. 
But, now, under the sway of Presi-
dent Trump, who has become the chief 
champion of cheating Americans out of 
their right to vote, they have decided 
to abandon their responsibility to de-
fend the Constitution. 
You know, in July of 1963, about a 
month after President Kennedy un-
veiled his Civil Rights Act, Martin Lu-
ther King was here in Washington, DC, 
giving interviews, and his words today 
still ring true. He said: ‘‘The tragedy is 
that we have a Congress with a Senate 
that has a minority of misguided sen-
ators . . . that want [to keep] . . . peo-
ple from even voting.’’ 
We thought that was cured in 1965. 
We have gone decades where we were 
completely united around defending 
the right to vote. And, suddenly, we 
have seen this past year the continu-
ation. The assault on the Capitol to 
disrupt the counting of electoral votes 
has been continued as an assault in 
State after State after State after 
State to stop Democratic constitu-
encies from exercising their right to 
vote. 
RAPHAEL
WARNOCK, Senator from 
Georgia, elected by less than 3 percent, 
said it boils down to this: ‘‘Some peo-
ple don’t want some people to vote.’’ 
Well, if you have sworn an oath to 
the Constitution, you have sworn an 
oath to ensure every citizen has a full 
opportunity to vote. 
So much depends on the makeup of 
this body. Whether you care about vot-
ing rights or attacking climate chaos 
or healthcare or housing, whether you 
care about living wages and safe condi-
tions for workers, those decisions are 
affected by the makeup of this body. 
And the theory of a democratic repub-
lic is that if the majority viewpoint is 
honored, we will work to address those 
issues that the majority cares about. 
And the majority does care about 
healthcare and housing and good work-
ing conditions and clean air and clean 
water and taking on the warming of 
this planet. The majority cares about 
that. If you take and assault the abil-
ity of the minority to express their 
viewpoints, you have destroyed that 
very premise of our democracy. 
And voting rights is different than 
every other issue. On every other issue, 
if we go off track, then the citizens can 
say: What have you done? You lose my 
support. I am voting for the other 
party or the other candidate. You 
promised to take on that challenge, 
and then you didn’t. You have lost my 
support, and I am exercising my ballot 
to put in people who will actually ad-
dress issues we care about. 
But voting rights is different because 
that issue is about whether or not the 
voters actually can exercise their out-
rage with us if we veer off track. If you 
compromise voting, then the voters no 
longer have the ability to throw you 
out—throw the bums out—and bring 
fresh voices to bear on the issues they 
care about. That is why this is so im-
portant. 
I am going to pivot to a little bit of 
history because for us to be able to 
vote on voting rights in this Chamber, 
we have a problem, and the problem is, 
the current rule of the Senate requires 
60 votes to allow us to get to a final 
vote, a final majority vote. 
In essence, we have become a Cham-
ber where policies cannot be passed ex-
cept by 60 votes of support. Many 
think, Isn’t this the way the Senate 
was designed? Isn’t this the way that 
our Founders envisioned the Senate? 
Didn’t they talk about the Senate 
being a cooling saucer—an expression 
attributed to President Washington 
that historians say he never said, but 
still it captures the understanding of 
this Chamber—that is, that this Cham-
ber would be a little more steady than 
the House would because we would 
have longer terms, 6-year terms in-
stead of 2-year terms? 
Now, it was debated that maybe 12- 
year terms, maybe lifetime appoint-
ments to the Senate, but in the end, 
the Founders settled on 6-year terms to 
make this Chamber a little less rash to 
some current trend that might be ill- 
considered than the Chamber down the 
hall. That is the cooling saucer. 
The Founders said that because Sen-
ators will have a larger territory than 
House members, they will have more 
diverse constituents. They won’t just 
have a city or just a rural area; they 
will probably have both and have to be 
thinking about how laws affect the 
farm, the ranch, the suburb, the city, 
the manufacturing, all the different as-
pects of our economy. So Senators will 
have a broader view. That is the cool-
ing saucer. 
Then the Founders threw in some-
thing else and said: Furthermore, we 
are going to say Senators will be elect-
ed indirectly by State legislatures, not 
by the people. Again, give them a little 
more insulation from citizens being 
very upset about something that hasn’t 
been well thought through. 
But never, ever, ever did our Found-
ers want this Chamber to have a super-
majority barrier, and we know this so 
clearly because they said so. When 
they were writing the Constitution, 
they were operating under the Confed-
eration Congress, and the Confed-
eration Congress required a super-
majority, and it was paralyzed. It 
couldn’t even raise the money to take 
on Shays’ Rebellion. So those who were 
working to design our 1787 Constitu-
tion said: Whatever you do, don’t 
embed a supermajority. 
Let’s see what they said. Hamilton, 
in Federalist Paper No. 22, said that 
with the minority in control of the ma-
jority, the result will be ‘‘tedious 
delays . . . and . . . contemptible com-
promises of the public good.’’ He said 
the real impact of a supermajority will 
be ‘‘to embarrass the administration, 
to destroy the energy of government.’’ 
On another occasion, he summed it 
up this way. He said: 
If two thirds of the whole number of mem-
bers had been required, it would . . . amount 
in practice to a necessity of unanimity. And 
the history of every political establishment 
in which this principle has prevailed, is a 
history of impotence, perplexity, and dis-
order.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S99 
January 7, 2022 
Why would he say that? Because the 
Confederation Congress was a setting 
of impotence, perplexity, and disorder. 
I don’t know what other places 
around the world he was thinking of, 
but he was certainly thinking of the 
Government of the United States at 
that very moment. 
Madison, in Federalist Paper 58, said: 
It would be no longer the majority that 
would rule: the power would be transferred 
to the minority. 
He was noting that the principle of 
free government would be reversed. 
The principle of free government is 
that you go the direction the majority 
weighs in on, not the minority. But 
when you require 60 votes to go down 
path A, and without them, you go down 
path B, then you go the direction the 
minority wants. You have done exactly 
what Madison said we must not let 
happen. We are reversing the principle 
of free government. 
So we have seen two things. We have 
seen that—as the filibuster is used 
more and more and eating up the time 
of the Senate, we have seen amend-
ments decline dramatically. We saw, 
for example, in the 109th Congress 
some 314 amendments. That has de-
clined to just 26 amendments in the 
last Congress, the 116th Congress. We 
are currently in the 117th. Why is it? 
Well, Senators can’t come to the floor 
and offer an amendment. 
When I was first here as an intern 
covering the floor for Senator Hatfield 
during the Tax Reform Act of 1976, I 
watched how one amendment was de-
bated for an hour or so, voted on, and 
then half a dozen to a dozen Senators 
would say to the Chair ‘‘Mr. President, 
Mr. President,’’ and the Chair was sup-
posed to call on whomever he heard 
first—at that point, it was always a 
man in the Chair—and that person 
would offer an amendment, and an 
hour later, they would vote on it. And 
then again, there would be a group 
seeking to get the next amendment, 
and they would go on until they were 
exhausted. 
That debate on a bill might go on for 
days and days or be spread over the 
course of numerous weeks, with other 
intervening activity, as in the Tax Re-
form Act of 1976, but every Senator 
knew they could offer an amendment. 
If they cared about a tax issue, they 
could offer it, and this body would have 
to debate it, would have to take a vote 
on it, but not today—not today. We 
twiddle our thumbs while the majority 
and minority leaders negotiate over 
amendments. 
The 
minority 
leader 
wants to protect Republicans from hav-
ing to vote on issues that they might 
be embarrassed by. The majority leader 
wants to protect majority Members 
from voting on issues they might be 
embarrassed by or that constituencies 
might not support. So we twiddle our 
thumbs while the leaders of the two 
parties debate. That is not how the 
Founders envisioned this Senate. 
This process of requiring 60 votes—it 
isn’t just the 60 votes; it is also the 
time it eats up because, in order to get 
that vote to close debate, you have to 
file a cloture motion and you have to 
wait an intervening day. So if you file 
it on a Monday, you have to wait until 
Wednesday. Then, if it should pass and 
you close debate, you have to have 30 
hours of debate. Then, if a Senator 
wasn’t allowed to vote during those 30 
hours, they get another hour, so tack 
on a few more hours. So every cloture 
motion eats up a week of the Senate’s 
time, even if it is successful. 
Well, we are about to see in the 
charts I am going to put up how this is 
destroying the Senate. 
After 1965, after the Voting Rights 
Act, the filibuster, the cloture motion 
lost its racist taint because we had 
passed the 1965 Voting Rights Act. So 
Senators started to think, Well, we can 
use this on other issues. But, still, it 
was pretty much under control until 
the early seventies. 
In the early seventies, you saw an in-
crease to about a dozen motions per 
year, in 1971, 1972, 1973. In 1974, it ex-
ploded to almost three dozen, and if 
you think about that eating up 36 
weeks of the Senate’s time, people 
yelled: This is terrible. This is terrible. 
So they reformed it in March of 1975, 
but that reform actually backfired 
after a few years, and Senators started 
to use this cloture motion—this clo-
ture requirement in ways it hadn’t 
been used but rarely in times past. It 
hadn’t been used on motions to proceed 
with bills to the floor. It hadn’t been 
used on amendments. It hadn’t been 
used on nominations. 
But let’s take a look at how that has 
changed. Let’s look first at the amend-
ments—actually, cloture on nomina-
tions. 
That one didn’t make it through the 
printer in time, but here is the story: 
On nominations, there were only three 
cloture motions in the history of the 
United States before 1975—three. After 
1975 to now, 852 times cloture has been 
filed on nominations; 852 weeks of the 
Senate’s time potentially obstructed. 
Let’s look at motions to proceed. Be-
fore the reform in 1975, only 16 times in 
our history had cloture motions been 
filed to keep a bill from being debated 
on the floor of the Senate. Think about 
it. If the filibuster was about enhanc-
ing debate, extending debate, here it is 
being used to prevent debate, prevent a 
bill from ever being debated. That is 
very relevant to the election bill we 
have been talking about because, as 
Majority 
Leader 
Senator 
SCHUMER 
pointed out, four times now, Repub-
licans have voted to prevent an elec-
tion bill from being debated, ever get-
ting started, a debate occurring on the 
floor of the Senate. 
It is the most anti-democratic thing 
to do, and both parties have done it, 
but it is a practice that needs to end, 
and it is a practice that exploded in the 
eighties, in the nineties, in the 2000s, in 
the 2010s—blocking bills from ever get-
ting to the floor 175 times in the decade 
2010 through 2020. 
Looking 
at 
cloture 
motions 
on 
amendments, it was considered unac-
ceptable to prevent votes on amend-
ments until the 1970s, and then the 
practice expanded. So you couldn’t ac-
tually get your amendment up because 
of the filling of the tree and the negoti-
ating between the two bodies, but if 
you did get it up, you could end up 
with it being blocked because it was 
blocked by a 60-vote requirement to 
close the debate on the amendment. 
The practice has continued and gone up 
and up and up. 
How about on final passage? Final 
passage before 1975, that is virtually 
the only place where cloture was used, 
and that expanded as well. 
So we are seeing that the cloture mo-
tion that takes up a week expanded in 
every single realm, and now, we are at 
an average of more than 100 per year— 
more than 100 per year. We don’t have 
a 100 weeks in a year. 
So the filibuster in its best form—its 
best form—is the ability of the minor-
ity to stand here on the floor and speak 
to delay action while they use that le-
verage to negotiate amendments or to 
negotiate compromise, and both sides 
have an incentive to reach a deal. 
They have an incentive to reach a 
deal because those who are filibus-
tering—it takes time and effort. That 
is difficult, so they have an incentive 
to reach a deal. And the majority, 
which is responsible for getting things 
done, has the goal of not having lots of 
time eaten up by filibuster. So both 
sides have an incentive to negotiate. 
But under the current 60-vote re-
quirement, that is not a filibuster; it is 
a 60-vote requirement. It is a minority 
veto, and because it is a minority veto, 
it doesn’t incentivize negotiation. It 
does the exact opposite, especially with 
the polarized tribal politics of today. 
The base of both parties wants us to 
stop the other party, and so we para-
lyze each other. 
It is Mahatma Gandhi to whom it is 
attributed the phrase ‘‘An eye for an 
eye makes the whole world blind.’’ It is 
the same challenge here. If Democrats 
do everything they can to prevent Re-
publican ideas from getting into law to 
be tested and Republicans do every-
thing they can to prevent the Demo-
cratic ideas from being tested, then no 
ideas are tested, and no issues are ad-
dressed, and the legislature fails in its 
responsibility to the people of the 
United States of America, and that is 
what is happening right now. 
We are failing in our responsibility to 
the people of the United States of 
America. 
Now, there are two ways that we can 
get that election bill—so vital to our 
responsibility under the Constitution, 
so vital to defending the rights of 
Americans to vote—to the floor of the 
Senate and off the floor. 
One is to create a carve-out that says 
we will not apply the 60-vote standard 
to the election bill because the election 
bill is too vital. 
The second is to rehabilitate, reener-
gize the filibuster, return to the vision

S100 
January 7, 2022 
that if you want to slow things down, 
you have to be on the floor speaking. 
The way that it worked was that you 
kept that power in place by making 
sure there were continuous speeches, 
one after the other, because if there 
was a break, the Chair could call the 
question. That means it comes before 
the public. That is a good thing. The 
public of the United States will see us 
arguing the pros and cons of whether 
to defend or not defend the voting 
rights of Americans. They would see us 
debating whether to stop billionaires 
from buying elections or not with dark 
money. They would see us debating the 
finer 
points 
of 
stopping 
gerry-
mandering so the principle of equal 
representation would either be honored 
or not honored. That debate would be 
healthy for the United States of Amer-
ica. 
Those are the only two possibilities 
right now to have an election bill en-
acted to protect the rights of Ameri-
cans: a carve-out or restore the fili-
buster. 
I powerfully believe the best path is 
to restore the filibuster. The Senate is 
better off by having the rights of the 
minority honored, the ability of minor-
ity Members to be heard; to slow 
things down to seek amendments; to 
slow things down to seek compromise; 
to slow things down to make sure a 
complicated bill has been weighed in 
by experts; to slow things down to 
make sure the press has been able to 
examine what is in the bill. That is all 
positive. That doesn’t happen with a 
carve-out. 
So I hope we will reinvigorate the fil-
ibuster; that all 50 of us will say: Let’s 
restore the balance in the Senate 
where the minority can slow things 
down for those valuable reasons but ul-
timately cannot block a final vote 
being taken. 
This idea was here from the start. 
The initial Senate—26 Members—they 
had a motion to move the prior ques-
tion in the rule book, but they never 
used it. So in 1805, when Aaron Burr di-
rected the rewriting of the rules, he 
said: We never use this rule, so let’s 
take it out because we all listen to 
each other before we vote. 
That is a big positive. Every Member 
should be heard in this Chamber. Every 
Member should be able to participate 
and have the ability to put amend-
ments forward, have their voice heard. 
We should not become the House. The 
House of Representatives—the major-
ity runs over the top of the minority. 
It is a better Chamber for having the 
voices of minority and majority weigh-
ing in on legislation, having amend-
ments from both parties being consid-
ered. That is the reinvigoration of the 
filibuster in its best light. 
You know, a year ago and 1 day, a 
mob attacked the Presidential elec-
tion, but in the ensuing year, we have 
had 19 States attack Federal elections 
for House and Senate Members by 
changing the rules in their State preju-
dicially to try to block the young, the 
college students, the Tribal members, 
the Black Americans from voting. It is 
wrong, but it is happening, and it is on 
our shoulders, our responsibility, to 
stop that. 
Earlier, I referred to the fact that the 
path of democracy is not the road most 
taken. Most of the people in the world 
operate under authoritarian govern-
ments. We have been the shining light 
to the world to say the right thing in 
human rights is for governance to flow 
up from the people, not down from the 
powerful. We have been that light. But 
if we cannot make this Chamber func-
tion, then the world does not look at us 
and say, That is the model we want to 
follow. If we cannot protect the rights 
of Americans to vote because their 
names are stripped out of the voting 
rolls or they are blocked from reg-
istering to begin with or blockades are 
put around the ballot box to make it 
hard for them to participate, then we 
are not in a position where the world 
looks to us and says, That system 
works. So it is incumbent on us to fix 
it. 
As I was thinking about these roads, 
the authoritarian road and the demo-
cratic road, the role of the Republic 
and the Republican road being the road 
less taken, it brings to my mind the 
poem by Robert Frost, ‘‘The Road Not 
Taken.’’ 
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, 
And sorry I could not travel both. 
He goes on to say at the end of the 
poem: 
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I— 
I took the one less traveled by, 
And that has made all the difference. 
That is how his poem ends. 
We have taken the road less traveled, 
the road of power flowing up from the 
people. It is the right road to take, and 
it makes the difference. 
Look at the vast difference between 
human rights being crushed by China, 
enslaving a million people in Xinjiang 
Province, 
stripping 
the 
democratic 
voice of the people, the right to free 
speech in Hong Kong, versus the free-
dom we have in our Nation. Our road is 
the right road. We have to make it 
work. To make it work, we need to 
pass the Freedom to Vote Act and the 
John Lewis Voting Rights Act, and we 
need to do it now.
