PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
HON. PATRICK T. McHENRY 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, April 24, 2020 
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, due to a 
family situation, I was unable to attend yester-
day’s vote. Had I been present, I would have 
voted NAY on Roll Call No. 103, and YEA on 
Roll Call No. 104.

HONORING THE LIFE OF THOMAS 
EDGAR MORGAN 
HON. BRIAN BABIN 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, April 24, 2020 
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life and legacy of a long-time Lone 
Star lawman and Marine Corps veteran, Lieu-
tenant Thomas Edgar ‘‘Tom’’ Morgan of the 
Harris County Sheriffs Office Reserves who 
passed away Monday, April 20, 2020 at the 
age of ninety-nine. At age ninety-eight, Lt. 
Morgan was Texas’ oldest licensed peace offi-
cer at the time of his retirement in 2018. 
Tom Morgan was born on September 20, 
1920 to Claude Jefferson Morgan and Connie 
Kenington Morgan in Bossier City, Louisiana. 
Growing up poor during the Great Depression 
and having to work hard in order to survive 
developed a tremendous work ethic and sense 
of patriotism in young Tom Morgan. 
In 1942, Tom enlisted in the United States 
Marine Corps at the age of twenty-one. During 
World War II, Tom saw action in the South 
Pacific during the invasions of Saipan, Gua-
dalcanal, and Okinawa. In addition to surviving 
these invasions, Tom also survived the sinking 
of his transport ship and malaria during war-
time. Tom remained on active duty in the Ma-
rine Corps until 1946 and later served for 
three months during the Korean War as a Re-
servist. 
Following his military service, while in col-
lege in Louisiana, Tom met his wife Pat during 
a visit to Houston. He transferred to the Uni-
versity of Houston to complete a degree in 
Mechanical Engineering and to be near Pat. 
They married in 1947 and raised their family 
of three children in Pasadena, Texas. Tom 
had a distinguished career as a pipeline engi-
neer for Gulf State Engineering for many 
years and retired in 1982 at the age of 62. 
In 1992, five decades after joining the Ma-
rines and a decade after retirement, Tom de-
cided to continue his service as a reserve 
deputy with the Harris County Sheriff’s Office 
(HCSO). At age 72, Tom was the oldest rook-
ie in the Academy. Deputy Morgan served in 
the HSCO Marine Division where he patrolled 
the waters of Lake Houston, the San Jacinto 
River, and the Houston Ship Channel. In 
2013, our mutual friend, Representative Ted 
Poe, honored Lt. Morgan when he reached 
20,000 hours of service with the Sheriff’s Of-
fice. After serving as a Reserve Deputy for 
twenty-six years, Tom Morgan retired as a 
Lieutenant at the age of ninety-eight, earning 
the title of the Lone Star State’s oldest law-
man. 
Tom reflected God’s love daily in his service 
to others and leaves quite a legacy. A com-
mitted Christian, he spent much of his life as 
an active member of First Baptist Church or 
United City Church in Humble. He also en-
joyed playing dominoes, dancing, and spend-
ing time with friends at the Humble Senior Ac-
tivity Center. 
Tom is preceded in death by his loving wife 
of sixty-one years, Nana Lou ‘‘Pat’’ Morgan 
who passed away December 26, 2008. He is 
survived by his three children: Carol Green 
and husband Larry of Deer Park, Kathy Den-
ton of Kingwood, and Tommy Morgan Jr. and 
wife Betty of Baytown, Texas. Tom had seven 
grandchildren, fifteen great-grandchildren, and 
two great-great-grandchildren. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the 
family of Lieutenant Morgan for Tom’s faithful 
service and devotion to his country and com-
munity. My thoughts and prayers remain with 
his family and friends.

COMMEMORATING THE 105TH ANNI-
VERSARY 
OF 
THE 
ARMENIAN 
GENOCIDE 
HON. TJ COX 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, April 24, 2020 
Mr. COX of California. Madam Speaker, 
today marks the 105th anniversary of the Ar-
menian Genocide—an atrocity perpetrated by 
the Ottoman Empire that killed over 1.5 million 
Armenians, as well as Assyrians, Greeks, and 
other Christian peoples. Over a century later, 
we memorialize this tragedy alongside the vi-
brant Armenian-American community in the 
Central Valley and across our great nation. 
We must never forget the families torn apart, 
the lives lost, and the immense impact the Ar-
menian Genocide had from 1915 until now. 
While we remember the past, we must also 
recognize the progress we’ve made. This Con-
gress, both the House and the Senate offi-
cially recognized the Armenian Genocide for 
the first time in history. I am so proud to have 
been a part of that important milestone for the 
Armenian community, while reiterating our na-
tion’s commitment to acknowledging human 
rights violations. 
It is difficult to find an Armenian today with-
out a family story of genocide. These stories 
show us just how long-lasting and detrimental 
the effects of brutality can be. They also high-
light the importance of promoting peaceful and 
constructive relationships between nations, 
while condemning perpetrators who deny their 
history of violence. 
Whether it be in the past, present, or future, 
we must take a stand against genocide and 
genocide denial across the world. The Arme-
nian people do not stand for it, and neither 
should America. We must reassess our rela-
tionships with nations that continue to deny 
the Armenian Genocide and continue forward 
with policies of justice and morality.

SPEECH OF 
HON. GEORGE HOLDING 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 23, 2020 
Mr. HOLDING. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
highlight the invaluable work that YMCAs 
across the country are doing during this crisis 
and urge Congress to ensure that they are 
made eligible for essential federal assistance 
programs in the next coronavirus package. 
From the beginning, YMCAs across the 
state of North Carolina have been on the front 
lines of efforts to combat the spread of corona 
virus and care for the communities affected by 
it. For weeks, YMCAs have take the initiative 
on providing family care and assistance. In 
Garner, NC, for example, the Poole Family 
YMCA has set up day camps for the children 
of essential personnel and runs blood drives. 
Their work has played an invaluable role in 
ensuring health care workers can continue 
fighting and that hard-hit communities have 
access to basic necessities. 
Despite providing these essential services, 
YMCAs have been left out of the federal as-
sistance programs they desperately need. 
YMCAs in Raleigh and in Charlotte have fur-
loughed aver 95 percent of their staffs and left 
many on extended unpaid leave as they con-
tinue to operate on a deficit throughout this 
crisis. 
Unfortunately, the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram (PPP), which Congress passed specifi-
cally to help groups like this, does not allow 
affiliated YMCAs that collectively employ over 
500 people to receive funds. 
Madam Speaker, without federal assistance, 
YMCAs across the country will no longer be 
able to provide relief to health care workers 
and underserved communities during this 
emergency. I ask that Congress work to en-
sure YMCAs that provide essential community 
services are able to receive funds through the 
PPP regardless of affiliation size in the next 
corona virus package.
