PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Gracious and loving God, on this 
Gold Star Mother’s and Family Day we 
come before You with our prayers for 
all the loved ones of our fallen heroes. 
It is on days like today we realize 
that added to the ultimate sacrifice 
paid by those men and women, is the 
toll taken on their mothers, fathers, 
sisters, brothers, daughters, and sons. 
We lift up to You those who hoped in 
vain for their loved one to come home, 
only 
to 
absorb 
the 
gut-wrenching 
shock of a knock at the door alerting 
their loss. Lord we place into Your 
compassionate care all those who have 
felt the cost of war most poignantly 
and ask that You surround them in 
Your embrace. 
Holy God, enter into that vacant 
place in their hearts—not to replace 
this love lost but to hold them tenderly 
in the depths of their pain. And God, 
help 
us 
to 
find 
appropriate 
and 
thoughtful ways to express our love 
and reverence for those who sorrow. 
As we honor those grieving on this 
day, remind us that for them on every 
day there is an empty chair at the 
table. But may their resilience and re-
solve serve as a testimony of faith in 
You and in Your abiding love in our 
lives. 
In Your steadfast presence we find 
peace. And in Your name we pray. 
Amen.

COST ESTIMATE FOR H.R. 4089, 
THE DARREN DRAKE ACT 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Sunday, September 26, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I include in the RECORD the cost esti-
mate prepared by the Congressional Budget 
Office for H.R. 4089, the Darren Drake Act. 
The cost estimate was not available at the 
time of the Committee report filing. 
U.S. CONGRESS, 
CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE, 
Washington, DC, September 24, 2021. 
Hon. BENNIE G. THOMPSON, 
Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR
MR. CHAIRMAN: The Congressional 
Budget Office has prepared the enclosed cost 
estimate for H.R. 4089, the Darren Drake Act. 
If you wish further details on this esti-
mate, we will be pleased to provide them. 
The CBO staff contact is Lindsay Wylie. 
Sincerely, 
PHILLIP L. SWAGEL, 
Director.

MANDATE EFFECTS 
Contains intergovernmental mandate? No. 
Contains private-sector mandate? No. 
* = between zero and $500,000. 
H.R. 4089 would require the Department of 
Homeland Security (DHS) to develop and dis-
seminate best practices for vehicle rental 
companies and dealers to report suspicious 
behavior when a rental vehicle is sold. DHS 
would be required to consult with state, 
local, and tribal governments and industry 
stakeholders and report to the Congress on 
implementation of the best practices after 
one year. Based on the cost of similar activi-
ties, CBO estimates that implementing the 
bill would cost less than $500,000 over the 
2021–2026 period; such spending would be sub-
ject to the availability of appropriated 
funds. 
The CBO staff contact for this estimate is 
Lindsay Wylie. The estimate was reviewed 
by Leo Lex, Deputy Director of Budget Anal-
ysis.
