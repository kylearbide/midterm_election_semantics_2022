Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 18, 2020 
No. 196 
House of Representatives 
The House met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the Speaker pro tem-
pore (Mr. CUELLAR). 
f 
DESIGNATION OF SPEAKER PRO 
TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker: 
WASHINGTON, DC, 
November 18, 2020. 
I hereby appoint the Honorable HENRY 
CUELLAR to act as Speaker pro tempore on 
this day. 
NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House of Representatives. 
f 
MORNING-HOUR DEBATE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the order of the House of Janu-
ary 7, 2020, the Chair will now recog-
nize Members from lists submitted by 
the majority and minority leaders for 
morning-hour debate. 
The Chair will alternate recognition 
between the parties, with time equally 
allocated between the parties and each 
Member other than the majority and 
minority leaders and the minority 
whip limited to 5 minutes, but in no 
event shall debate continue beyond 
11:50 a.m. 
f 
URGENT NEED FOR CORONAVIRUS 
RELIEF 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Ms. TLAIB) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to join my colleagues in calling for im-
mediate action on COVID relief. 
It is an outrage that Senate Repub-
licans and the impeached President’s 
administration are more focused on un-
dermining our election integrity and 
faith in our democracy rather than de-
livering relief to millions of Americans 
who are struggling right now. 
With over 20 million unemployed and 
more than 8 million having fallen into 
poverty, recurring monthly payments 
are desperately needed to protect the 
American people from further harm 
and loss. 
Due to the lack of Federal commit-
ment 
and 
funding, 
the 
maximum 
amount a worker in my district gets on 
unemployment is $362 a week, Mr. 
Speaker; $962 under the first stimulus 
payment. So now you are asking work-
ers, our families, our neighbors, to live 
with $362 a week. Not anyone here 
could survive on that. 
Due to the uncontrolled spread of the 
coronavirus, new stay-at-home orders 
and business restrictions are necessary 
to protect our public health. 
But we must couple this with orders 
with strong, recurring Federal support, 
putting money directly into the pock-
ets of Americans, so they can actually 
afford to stay home, and support our 
local governments and businesses on 
the brink of collapse without more 
stimulus. 
This pandemic has also made clear 
the need of guaranteeing access to 
clean water to our neighbors. 
Washing one’s hands is crucial to pre-
venting illness and spread. We need to 
treat water as a human right, and ban 
water shutoffs nationwide, and ensure 
that every American has what they 
need to protect themselves during this 
pandemic. 
So, Mr. Speaker, sending stimulus 
checks, supporting State and local gov-
ernments, small businesses, and pre-
venting water shutoffs are some of the 
first steps we must take to not only 
control the spread of this coronavirus 
but to recover from its devastation. 
I urge my Republican colleagues to 
please join me in taking urgent action. 
f 
RECOGNIZING PERSONNEL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. SHIMKUS) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, many of 
us know that the House could not func-
tion without the professional non-
partisan personnel who ensure that we 
can do our job. We do at times as an in-
stitution pause and thank them, but 
now it is time for me to do it person-
ally. I thank them for their commit-
ment, dedication, and their hard work. 
It would be difficult to start without 
mentioning the Capitol Police. They 
are here 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 
and 365 days a year. Since my time 
here, some have fallen in the line of 
duty, others injured protecting those 
placed in their care. These are only the 
events that I know. I can only imagine 
the stories that they could tell. Thank 
you. 
I owe thanks to the Office of the At-
tending Physician. This concierge serv-
ice helps us stay healthy and keeps us 
informed on how this job affects our 
health. There have been many times 
when I have watched them scramble to 
attend to the health needs of a Member 
or one of our visitors. 
In the Army we are fond of saying 
the Army moves on its stomach. So 
does the House of Representatives. We 
and our guests can find food in numer-
ous locations. This morning, I picked 
up my breakfast right here in the base-
ment of the Capitol. Lunch, who 
knows, but I do not fret that I will not 
be able to find something. 
When we depart for the day, the 
cleaning crew comes in. They are long 
gone by the time most of us arrive the 
next day. 
Mail and newspapers are dropped off 
by couriers. Lightbulbs are replaced. 
Pictures are hung up and, in my case, 
taken down. Photos are taken of us and 
our guests in major events. 
Audiovisual connectivity for Cham-
ber and Committee activities, so the 
public can observe our deliberations, is 
ensured. And, again, as I observe this 
morning, the electronic voting system 
was turned on and checked.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5870 
November 18, 2020 
The recorder takes down every word, 
sometimes in the heat of a rhetorical 
exchange, which eventually helps the 
Chamber sort out the claims, reconcile 
them, and return to business. 
I also want to point out the friendly 
faces and voices from the Office of the 
Clerk of the House. Many of them are 
right in front of me, Mr. Speaker. 
These nonpartisan employees record, 
file, keep in order, track time, and help 
the Speaker or Speaker pro tempore 
identify Members and call on them. 
The wizard of the House is the Par-
liamentarian and his staff. I have 
known four over my career. They are 
the keeper of the Jeffersonian rules 
and precedents. Any Member who is 
smart and up to some trickery best run 
their idea by the Parliamentarian. 
They will not only provide great coun-
sel, but will keep the discussion con-
fidential. 
My thanks go to the Office of Mem-
ber Services. They processed me in and 
are now processing me out. They are 
our office of human resources and, as 
with everything, as time passes, so do 
your needs. I have checked with them 
often over the years, and that has 
helped prepare for my departure. 
Also assisting me is the Office of 
House Ethics. The last thing I want to 
do is screw something up as I walk out 
the door. They, too, are 24/7 and only a 
phone call away. 
Any time you create a list, you risk 
forgetting someone or some office. If I 
have done so, please forgive me. It has 
been a great ride, and the nonpartisan 
professional staff who cover the every-
day activities deserve my thanks and, 
with that, I thank you.

THE NATION CONTINUES TO FACE 
AN INCREASINGLY DEADLY PAN-
DEMIC 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Georgia (Mrs. MCBATH) for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. MCBATH. Mr. Speaker, as we 
move into the last weeks of 2020, as we 
move into a dark and uncertain winter, 
our Nation continues to face an in-
creasingly deadly pandemic. Grief, eco-
nomic hardship, and anxiety can be felt 
in every corner of our country. 
Despite the challenges that face our 
Nation, the past few weeks have seen 
millions of Americans stand up and 
make their voices heard. 
And millions of Americans have cho-
sen unity over division, stability over 
chaos, and looked forward to a future 
filled with faith and hope for a brighter 
world. 
That world requires something from 
each and every one of us—we all must 
do our part. We all have a role to play 
in transforming our aspirations into 
real, effective progress. 
Over the last 2 years, I have heard 
from thousands of families who have 
called on my office in a moment of 
need; a grandparent whose Social Secu-
rity checks just simply stopped com-
ing; a veteran who desperately needed 
an appointment at the VA hospital; a 
small business that required assistance 
to keep their employees paid during 
this pandemic. 
For many of these people, their call 
to my office may have been the first 
time that they have ever interacted 
with a government official. It may be 
the first time that they have ever 
asked their government for help. 
Each and every day, we are called 
upon to serve our communities in Con-
gress. They are trusting us to do every-
thing that we can to advocate on their 
behalf. 
We must never lose sight of that 
faith and that trust that they placed in 
us. 
Hardworking families across Georgia, 
and from around the Nation, under-
stand that the days and the months 
ahead may be the most important of 
our lifetime. 
And Americans have been very clear. 
They have asked their leaders to put 
aside their partisan bickering and 
focus on American fellowship. 
And the mandate that they have 
given us is one of compassion and co-
operation. 
It is a mandate to heal fractures and 
mend their wounds. 
It is a mandate to solve problems and 
protect them. 
And it is a mandate to compromise 
with common sense. 
It is a mandate to enact policies that 
provide every person in this Nation an 
opportunity to fight for their very own 
American Dream. 
For many years, before I had the 
honor of serving my community in 
Congress, I worked as a flight attend-
ant for Delta Airlines, and I shared 
journeys with people from every corner 
of our globe and of every color and 
every creed and of every race and every 
religion. 
Yes, we all come from different back-
grounds, and we share different beliefs, 
and we all belong to different political 
parties. But what we must understand 
is that we share a common purpose 
that transcends partisanship. 
We are all uniquely American. We 
are all far more alike than we are dif-
ferent. We all need to spend time with 
those that we love, to share our stories 
with those who make us smile, make 
us laugh. We all want what is best for 
our families. 
On these journeys across America, I 
watched 
first-generation 
Americans 
chart a course toward a lifetime of new 
and exciting experiences. 
And I watched men and women in 
uniform fly home to surprise their 
young children, their mothers who 
have been worried sick, their brothers 
who haven’t seen their best friend in 
years. 
I have watched parents beam with 
pride as they reunited with their new 
college graduate. After decades of hard 
work, they knew, with faith and with 
certainty, that the days of their chil-
dren would be better than their own. 
This is the America that our con-
stituents sent us here to fight for and 
sent us here to lead; to preserve the 
ideas that this Nation was founded 
upon; to protect the values that must 
endure long after every single one of us 
in this Chamber is gone. 
Our strength as a Nation has always 
been on our ability to come together to 
address America’s greatest challenges, 
which we are in right now. And that is 
the opportunity that we have in this 
very moment. 
And when we look back at this time 
in years to come, I pray that we can all 
take pride in our response; that we 
fought against all those who seek to 
sow the seeds of hatred and division— 
and for all those rooted in peace and 
prosperity; that we fought to strength-
en our fellow Americans with love and 
with unity; that we fought for progress 
alongside our brothers and sisters of 
this great Nation with unshakeable re-
solve; that we fought for a future that 
we can all believe in.

RECOGNIZING DANE HAYGOOD 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Alabama (Mr. BYRNE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of Mayor Dane 
Haygood of Daphne, who recently re-
tired after 8 successful years in office. 
The Jubilee City is truly a jewel of 
southwest Alabama, and as Baldwin 
County has experienced the fastest 
growth in Alabama in recent years, 
Daphne has led the way. No city could 
experience such rapid growth while re-
taining its sense of community without 
good stewardship, and Mayor Haygood 
deserves a tremendous amount of cred-
it for his 8 years of steady leadership. 
With Mayor Haygood at the helm, 
Daphne was one of the chief bene-
ficiaries of the past decade of economic 
expansion in our region. 
Mayor Haygood can leave office 
knowing that Daphne is well positioned 
to continue on the path to prosperity. 
I congratulate Mayor Haygood and his 
family, and I look forward to seeing 
what the future has in store for them 
in the years ahead. 
RECOGNIZING DAVID BAKER 
Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to thank Mayor David Baker of 
Semmes on his many years of service. 
Mayor Baker recently left the mayoral 
office after a distinguished and diverse 
history of service to his community. 
Since Mayor Baker began serving as 
city councilman for Semmes in 2011, he 
has always been a highly visible and 
accessible public servant. While in of-
fice, Mayor Baker has overseen a pe-
riod of growth and annexation, and 
Semmes is well prepared to continue 
its growth and meet new challenges. 
A proud graduate of the University of 
South 
Alabama 
in 
Mobile, 
Mayor 
Baker retired as an officer in the 
United States Army after 20 years of 
honorable service. Since becoming an 
educator in 2003, countless high school 
students in the community have bene-
fited from his wise instruction.

November 18, 2020 
I have every confidence Mayor Baker 
will remain involved in the commu-
nity, and I wish him and Alice the best 
in the days ahead. 
CONGRATULATING TERRY DOWNEY 
Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate Terry Downey 
upon his recent retirement. Since his 
election in 2016, Mayor Downey has 
guided Bayou la Batre through a series 
of significant challenges, including sev-
eral severe hurricanes and the recent 
pandemic. 
Bayou la Batre has a unique heritage 
as a diverse home with the fishing and 
seafood 
processing 
industries, 
and 
Mayor 
Downey’s 
leadership 
helped 
Bayou la Batre weather the storms and 
protect the livelihoods and culture of 
its residents. The city is well-prepared 
to continue handling whatever else 
may come its way. 
I thank Mayor Downey for his serv-
ice, and I join the people of Bayou la 
Batre in wishing him all the best in the 
next stage of his life.

CONGRATULATING JIMMY LYONS ON HIS 
RETIREMENT 
Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
congratulate Jimmy Lyons upon his 
retirement as director and CEO of the 
Alabama State Port Authority. 
Over more than two decades, Jim-
my’s creative, forward-thinking leader-
ship led to transformative growth at 
one of Alabama’s premier assets. 
Jimmy’s steady stewardship guided 
the port authority during economic 
highs and lows. Despite a range of chal-
lenges, the port has thrived under his 
leadership. 
With him at the helm, the port is 
now one of the fastest growing con-
tainer terminals in the country. It has 
added a steel terminal and has vastly 
expanded its ability to load and unload 
automobiles, and those are just a few 
examples. 
Jimmy also played a critical part in 
securing upgrades at the port and in 
the channel that allow a higher num-
ber of increasingly large ships from 
around the globe to use the port with 
growing ease. 
While he will be missed, the Alabama 
State Port Authority, and Alabama’s 
economy, are better positioned for fu-
ture success than they have ever been 
because of Jimmy Lyons. I wish him 
the best in his well-deserved retire-
ment. 
HONORING THE LIVES OF WILLIAM AND EUBER 
COLLINS 
Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to commemorate the lives of two 
dear friends who recently passed away, 
William and Euber Collins. 
William, known by most as Monty, 
passed away at 90 years old on Novem-
ber 2, only 1 day before his wife, Euber, 
who was 88. They were married a re-
markable 68 years. 
After meeting and falling in love at 
the University of Alabama, Monty and 
Euber married and found their way to 
Mobile. Their close partnership enabled 
them to raise four wonderful children 
and Monty to have a long, successful 
career, culminating in his retirement 
from the First National Bank of Mo-
bile. 
After his retirement, Monty served 
as a field representative for my prede-
cessor, Sonny Callahan, and served two 
terms as a member of the Alabama 
House of Representatives. 
Throughout their marriage, Monty 
and Euber maintained a remarkable 
level of engagement and service to Mo-
bile. 
Monty and Euber leave behind a leg-
acy of love for each other, their family, 
and their community that will be dif-
ficult to match in its intensity and lon-
gevity. They will be deeply missed and 
fondly remembered. 
My heartfelt condolences go out to 
their family. 
f 
PROTECTING RELIGIOUS FREEDOM 
DURING PANDEMIC 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Arkansas (Mr. HILL) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, 
today, I rise to address a pressing prob-
lem that concerns Americans’ constitu-
tional rights. The liberties enshrined in 
the Constitution still apply to every 
American, even in the midst of a na-
tional emergency. 
It is becoming clear to many Ameri-
cans that our national life has slid to-
ward a double standard. For weeks, of-
ficials have asked the public to put life 
on hold and help fight this virus. The 
American people did their part and are 
doing their part, have made sacrifices 
to help our Nation, and continue to do 
their part. 
But throughout this pandemic, we 
have seen a troubling trend of State 
leaders leaning on religious institu-
tions harder than any other group or 
organization. 
In 2018, Pope Francis, while address-
ing ‘‘red martyrdom,’’ those who face 
death and persecution on account of 
their religious beliefs, also warned our 
nations about ‘‘white martyrdom,’’ 
which occurs in democratic countries 
when freedom of religion is restricted. 
So far, lawsuits claiming that State 
restrictions on religious gatherings in-
fringe on freedom of religion have been 
filed in Kentucky, California, Lou-
isiana, Virginia, and elsewhere. 
In Virginia, at Lighthouse Fellow-
ship Church’s Palm Sunday service, 
there were only 16 people present, all 
properly socially distanced. Yet, the 
pastor was subjected, Mr. Speaker, to a 
criminal citation. 
In Kansas, two churches settled with 
Democratic Governor Laura Kelly after 
they sued over her 10-person limit for 
religious services. A Federal judge 
ruled that the State appeared to have 
singled out religious activities for 
stricter 
treatment. 
Now, 
Kansas 
churches can hold those services as 
long as they abide by the protocols for 
businesses and other establishments, 
such as providing hand sanitizer, face 
masks, and social distancing. 
In Kentucky, despite claiming that 
his order allowed congregants to at-
tend drive-through services, Governor 
Andy Beshear had State police leave 
notices to self-isolate on churchgoers’ 
windshields on Easter Sunday service 
at the Maryville Baptist Church out-
side of Louisville. 
In defiance of the Governor’s man-
date, Pastor Jack Roberts, along with 
congregants, ripped up those notices 
and filed a lawsuit. 
Mr. Speaker, a Federal appeals court 
sided with the pastor and blocked part 
of 
Beshear’s 
order, 
allowing 
congregants to attend drive-in services. 
In the ruling, the three-judge panel of 
the Sixth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals 
expressed support for the church’s ar-
gument that it wasn’t being treated 
fairly, 
noting 
‘‘hundreds’’ 
of 
cars 
parked in the lot of the nearby grocery 
store on the same day the police in-
formed churchgoers that they were vio-
lating the law. 
‘‘The breadth of the ban on religious 
services, together with a haven for nu-
merous secular exceptions, should give 
pause to anyone who prizes religious 
freedom.’’ That is what the judges 
wrote. 
They continued, ‘‘But it is not al-
ways easy to decide what is Caesar’s 
and what is God’s, and that is as-
suredly true in the context of a pan-
demic.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, I commend the judges 
for standing up for the fundamental 
right of religious freedom, including 
the freedom of worship. 
Americans have shown that they can 
convene for religious services in a re-
sponsible way. The compassion and 
care for communities of faith through-
out the pandemic are needed now more 
than ever. 
Our first Chief Executive, President 
Washington, prized our First Amend-
ment to the Constitution, saying, ‘‘No 
one would be more zealous than myself 
to establish effectual barriers against 
the horrors of spiritual tyranny and 
every species of religious persecution.’’ 
Let’s urge our colleagues in Con-
gress, our State legislatures, our Gov-
ernors, and down at 1600 Pennsylvania 
Avenue to honor Washington’s passion 
for our enshrined right to religious lib-
erty. 
CALLING FOR TARGETED COVID RELIEF 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, 
during this lame duck session, this 
House needs bipartisan leadership to 
achieve critical, needed COVID relief 
for central Arkansans. 
The majority of these issues are easy 
and have significant bipartisan sup-
port. 
We need to extend and expand the 
Paycheck Protection Program and ease 
paycheck protection forgiveness. 
Pandemic unemployment payments 
need to be addressed in a way to help 
families but also encourage work. 
Finally, States need flexibility on 
spending money from the CARES Act,

REMEMBERING MARINE CORPORAL 
RONALD R. PAYNE, JR. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. SPANO) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. SPANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to highlight the legacy of Marine 
Corporal Ronald R. Payne, Jr., a local 
hero who proudly served our country in 
the U.S. Marine Corps and was killed in 
combat on May 7, 2004. 
Payne graduated from Mulberry High 
School as a star football and basketball 
player. 
As a marine, Payne had been part of 
the initial force that invaded Iraq and 
entered Baghdad. He then volunteered 
to return for a second overseas tour. He 
was initially sent to Afghanistan to 
help with elections but was then sent 
into combat. 
Corporal Payne will be remembered 
as the first marine killed serving in Af-
ghanistan. 
He will also be remembered as a man 
of faith. A late journal entry reads, 
‘‘The fear is starting to turn into ex-
citement. Besides, what do I have to be 
afraid of really? I have God on my side, 
and He said He will never leave us nor 
forsake us. Having Him is better than 
any type of support or weapon that 
man can give.’’ 
To his family, our district still 
mourns Ron’s loss. I salute you for 
raising such a hero who was also such 
a servant. 
REMEMBERING STAFF SERGEANT JOHN ALLEN 
REINERS 
Mr. SPANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in memory of Staff Sergeant 
John Allen Reiners, a local hero from 
Florida’s 15th District who served our 
country in the Armed Forces and who 
was sadly killed in combat in the Af-
ghan theater. 
After participating in Junior ROTC 
for 4 years and graduating from Haines 
City High School, he enlisted in the 
U.S. Army and then began with the 
Army Rangers. 
He served at Fort Drum, New York, 
and Fort Carson, Colorado, and, during 
this time, also did two tours in Iraq, 
where he received his first Purple 
Heart. 
In 2001, Staff Sergeant Reiners died 
of wounds sustained when enemy forces 
attacked his unit with an improvised 
explosive device in Afghanistan’s Zhari 
Province. 
He was awarded his second Purple 
Heart and the Bronze Star Medal post-
humously for his valiant service and 
dedication to his team. 
At home, Reiners was also a devoted 
husband to Casey and father to Lex. 
To the entire Reiners family, our dis-
trict 
and 
community 
still 
mourn 
John’s loss. He was truly the epitome 
of a great American soldier, and his 
sacrifices will not be forgotten. 
REMEMBERING SPECIALIST RYAN MICHAEL 
LUMLEY 
Mr. SPANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the service and legacy 
of Specialist Ryan Lumley, a devoted 
husband and son who served this coun-
try in the Armed Forces and was killed 
in combat in Wardak Province, Afghan-
istan, on December 3, 2011. 
Ryan graduated from Cedar Key High 
School in 2008, joined the U.S. Army in 
2009, and soon thereafter reported to 
Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas, where he 
excelled with the 2nd Battalion, 5th In-
fantry Regiment, 3rd Brigade Combat 
Team. 
Unfortunately, at the young age of 
21, Ryan lost his life to an improvised 
explosive device. 
Due to his outstanding service and 
dedication to our country, Ryan was 
awarded the National Defense Service 
Medal, the Global War on Terrorism 
Service 
Medal, 
and 
several 
other 
badges and ribbons. 
Ryan is survived by his wife, Kimber, 
a loving family, and many hometown 
friends who remember him fondly for 
his strong character and patriotism. 
While some time has passed since his 
departure, may his legacy continue to 
uplift his loved ones and encourage a 
grateful Nation. 
REMEMBERING SERGEANT DANIEL MCKINNON 
ANGUS 
Mr. SPANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in memory of Sergeant Daniel 
McKinnon Angus, a local hero of Flor-
ida’s 15th District who was killed in ac-
tion in Afghanistan on January 24, 
2010. 
Daniel 
graduated 
from 
Armwood 
High School in 2000 and, in 2003, joined 
the U.S. Marine Corps, where he knew 
he belonged and hoped to make a ca-
reer of serving his community and his 
country. 
Daniel stood out among his peers and 
received a Combat Action Ribbon, two 
Good Conduct Medals, the Afghanistan 
and Iraq Campaign Medals, the Global 
War on Terrorism Service Medal, and a 
number of service decorations. 
He loved spending time with his wife, 
Bonnie, and his 1-year-old daughter, 
now 11 years old. May she always know 
and treasure the knowledge of her fa-
ther’s heroism. 
You see, men and women like Daniel, 
who are willing to lay down their lives 
in defense of our country and in sup-
port of others many miles away, are 
what makes our Nation the greatest on 
Earth. 
Let us never take their sacrifice or 
that of their surviving families in vain.

DEFENDING MOTION TO 
RECOMMIT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. BUDD) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. BUDD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to sound the alarm that House Demo-
crats are considering a rule change 
that would severely limit the rights of 
the minority party in the House for 
years to come. 
I am referring to the partisan push to 
water down or to eliminate the motion 
to recommit. 
Mr. Speaker, the MTR, as it is called, 
is a critical procedural tool that gives 
the minority party one last oppor-
tunity to improve legislation before a 
final vote on this House floor. An MTR 
not only increases transparency be-
tween Members of Congress and their 
constituents, but it holds Members ac-
countable and forces them to go on 
record for viewpoints that they hold. 
Weakening the MTR would only 
serve to shield Members from criti-
cism, suffocate debate on key policy 
issues, 
and 
overturn 
longstanding 
House precedent. It would be a blatant 
power grab by the majority Democrat 
Party. 
That is why my colleagues and I will 
be appealing to the Rules Committee 
this week in writing, demanding that 
the MTR be preserved. 
CONFRONTING VOTER FRAUD 
Mr. BUDD. Mr. Speaker, for the past 
2 weeks, I have heard from an over-
whelming number of my constituents, 
and they do not have confidence in the 
integrity of November’s election. 
They are outraged that media pun-
dits and establishment Democrat poli-
ticians are sneering at the very con-
cept of taking the time to ensure that 
every legal vote is counted and that 
every illegal vote is thrown out. 
Every citizen has a right to seek jus-
tice in a court of law, and that includes 
the President of the United States. His 
legal team needs to be given the time 
to collect and present evidence of vot-
ing and tabulation irregularities. 
Until the courts have played their 
constitutional role, we should be wary 
of declaring winners and losers. 
Look, if we could spend 2 years inves-
tigating 
conspiracy 
theories 
about 
Russian collusion, we should be able to 
take a few weeks to confirm the integ-
rity of this election. 
I am glad that Attorney General Bill 
Barr authorized the Department of 
Justice to investigate any and all alle-
gations of illegal activity. He took this 
necessary step after 38 of my House 
colleagues and I requested that the De-
partment leave no stone unturned in 
this effort. 
We will also be introducing legisla-
tion this very week that will require 
the DOJ to create a national strategy 
to identify and combat voter intimida-
tion, fraud, ballot system glitches, sab-
otage, and hacking. 
Mr. Speaker, voting is the most sa-
cred civic duty in our Nation. In an 
election for our Nation’s highest office, 
involving unprecedented levels of mail- 
in voting, we must take the time to en-
sure that every legal vote is counted 
and every illegal vote is not counted. 
Nothing is more important than the 
integrity of our ballots.

ANOTHER ABDICATION OF DUTIES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, it has become quite apparent 
over the past few months that House 
Democrats just don’t want to show up 
for work. They rallied behind proxy 
voting the moment the idea was con-
jured up, and ever since, they have be-
come complacent in their duties. 
The American people are showing up 
to work because their livelihoods de-
pend on it. But when it comes to Demo-
crat Members of Congress, it is the 
exact opposite. What a stark contrast. 
For months, my Republican col-
leagues and I have made the trip from 
our districts to Washington to conduct 
the business of the people’s House in 
the open. We have been present at com-
mittee hearings, votes, and other im-
portant functions, but it certainly 
seems that our Democrat colleagues 
don’t share that same level of commit-
ment. 
What does that tell you about them? 
Mr. Speaker, we can’t ignore the fact 
that we are in the middle of a global 
pandemic, but that does not mean that 
we get to abdicate our duties as Mem-
bers of Congress. Members of the 
United States Senate have shown up to 
conduct their business. 
So why isn’t the House doing the 
same? 
What is concerning most of all is 
that the initial endeavor to implement 
proxy voting has now evolved into 
something more asinine: vote by text. 
This attempt to consolidate power by 
Speaker PELOSI is just another feeble 
move, and one that runs counter to the 
operation of this deliberative body that 
has stood for hundreds of years, yet 
House Democrats seem perfectly con-
tent with this idea. 
The American notion of showing up 
to work and fulfilling your duties 
seems to be a foreign concept to them. 
If they spent their time working, and 
less time looking for ways to get out of 
work, we would be making progress. 
This is not an effective way to legis-
late and, in the end, the American peo-
ple are the ones who will bear the 
brunt of this imprudent course of ac-
tion. 
The people’s House must return to 
regular order, and if we keep kicking 
the can down the road on conducting 
business in the open, this institution 
will become rife with complacency. It 
is time we get back to work. Stop the 
delays. Stop the political ploys. The 
American people are counting on us. 
f 
CONGRESS ELECTS PRESIDENT IF 
NO ELECTORAL COLLEGE WINNER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Alabama (Mr. BROOKS) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BROOKS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, this is the second in the series of 
House floor speeches by me on the re-
cent Presidential elections. 
Previously, I covered constitutional 
and Federal statutory law mandating 
that 
Congress—not 
the 
Supreme 
Court—decides whether to accept or re-
ject States’ electoral college vote sub-
missions. 
Today’s remarks focus on who de-
cides a Presidential election if no can-
didate receives an electoral college ma-
jority vote because of a tie, because 
multiple candidates split the electoral 
college vote, or because Congress re-
jected State electoral college votes. 
Per the United States Constitution’s 
12th Amendment, Congress—not the 
Supreme Court—elects the next Presi-
dent and Vice President of the United 
States if no candidate wins an electoral 
college vote majority. Congress’ deci-
sion is final, determinative, and non-
reviewable. 
The 12th Amendment states that if 
no candidate has a majority of the 
electoral college vote, then, from the 
three highest vote-getters for Presi-
dent, ‘‘the House of Representatives 
shall choose immediately by ballot the 
President. But in choosing the Presi-
dent, the votes shall be taken by 
States, the representation from each 
State having one vote . . . and a major-
ity of all of the States shall be nec-
essary to a choice.’’ 
As an aside, the 12th Amendment re-
quires the Senate to elect the Vice 
President. There is a twist in the 
House vote for President. A majority of 
Congressmen does not elect the Presi-
dent. Rather, the House votes by State 
delegations to elect the next President 
of the United States. 
America has 50 States. After the 2020 
elections, 26 State delegations have a 
Republican majority. Twenty States 
have a Democrat majority. The re-
maining State delegations are tied 50/ 
50, with Iowa undecided pending an 
uncalled election. 
Hence, if Congress rejects electoral 
college votes from States with election 
processes that are so badly flawed as to 
be unreliable and unworthy of accept-
ance, House Republicans control the 
election of the next President of the 
United States. 
Let me repeat that for emphasis. 
House Republicans control the election 
of the next President of the United 
States. 
For emphasis, the 12th Amendment 
has, on occasion, resulted in Congress 
electing the next President of the 
United States. 
For example, in 1824, Andrew Jack-
son led the electoral college with 99 
votes, to 85 votes for John Quincy 
Adams, 
to 
41 
votes 
for 
William 
Crawford, to 37 votes for House Speak-
er Henry Clay. The House elected sec-
ond place finisher John Quincy Adams 
President of the United States over 
first place finisher Andrew Jackson, 
prompting 
Andrew 
Jackson 
to 
fa-
mously declare, ‘‘The Judas of the 
West has closed the contract and will 
receive the 30 pieces of silver . . . Was 
there ever witnessed such a bare faced 
corruption in any country before?’’ 
Another example is the 1876 election, 
wherein Democrat Samuel Tilden won 
the popular vote and amassed 184 elec-
toral college votes, one shy of Ohio Re-
publican Rutherford B. Hayes’ 185 elec-
toral college votes. 
Louisiana’s, 
Florida’s, 
and 
South 
Carolina’s electoral college votes were 
disputed because it strained credibility 
to believe these States voted Repub-
lican while still suffering from the de-
structive effects of a Republican-led in-
vasion during the Civil War. Congress 
appointed a 15-member commission to 
study the matter, which split on party 
lines: eight Republicans for Hayes, 
seven Democrats for Tilden. 
Congress then elected Hayes Presi-
dent of the United States in a deal that 
gave Louisiana’s, Florida’s, and South 
Carolina’s disputed electoral college 
votes to Hayes in exchange for remov-
ing occupying Union troops from the 
South and ending reconstruction. 
In sum, the history and law are clear: 
Congress, not the Supreme Court, de-
termines who wins or loses Presi-
dential elections.

PENNSYLVANIA 
VOTERS 
CON-
CERNED ABOUT VOTING IRREG-
ULARITIES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. MEUSER) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, many of 
the voters in Pennsylvania and in my 
district are rightfully upset and con-
cerned about the irregular actions 
which occurred in the past election. 
There are valid reasons for the collec-
tive feeling of disenfranchisement and 
of distrust stemming from various 
election 
processes 
and 
procedural 
changes which were outside of statute. 
Thousands—no—millions in Pennsyl-
vania have a feeling of intense frustra-
tion and believe that their constitu-
tional rights have been violated. To 
start, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court 
granted a 3-day extension for late-ar-
riving ballots, usurping the authority 
of the State legislature and contra-
dicting the U.S. Constitution, which 
clearly states: ‘‘The times, places, and 
manner of holding elections shall be 
prescribed in each State by the legisla-
ture thereof.’’ 
These constitutional authorities are 
not fair-weather laws, despite the chal-
lenges posed by the pandemic. The 
highly irregular actions of the Penn-
sylvania Supreme Court resulted in the 
unlawful counting of over 10,000 ballots 
that arrived after the statutory re-
quired time of 8 p.m. on election day— 
nobody disputes this—mitigating an 
accurate ballot count and, at the same 
time, fueling great distrust in the proc-
ess. 
Second, there are serious disputes 
over how individual mail-in ballots 
with technical errors were handled 
across the Commonwealth. Pennsyl-
vania State law dictates that mail-in

ballots must be signed, dated, and in-
cluded in a secrecy envelope, and that 
ballots that are missing required infor-
mation and/or signatures should be dis-
qualified or, at a minimum, authenti-
cated. 
Just hours before polls opened, the 
secretary of state of Pennsylvania 
issued inconsistent and contradictory 
guidance, giving Pennsylvania counties 
the authority to decide whether to re-
ject ballots that contained discrep-
ancies or take additional measures to 
correct them. This happened. This is a 
highly irregular thing to do. 
As a result, Philadelphia, Mont-
gomery, Allegheny, and Bucks County, 
four of the largest counties in Pennsyl-
vania, allowed literally thousands and 
thousands of ballots to be fixed or 
cured, a measure not pursued by most 
other counties and which violated 
State election law. 
Third, Republican poll watchers in 
Philadelphia were kept at an unreason-
able distance to observe the pre-can-
vassing and canvassing of ballots. Even 
after a court ruling allowed poll watch-
ers closer access, Philadelphia officials 
actually appealed the order to the 
Pennsylvania Supreme Court. 
Why would local election officials 
make the process blatantly more re-
strictive to poll watchers, some of 
whom resorted to using binoculars to 
do their jobs? 
This, too, actually happened. An esti-
mated 687,000 ballots were counted dur-
ing this time of no lawfully required 
poll 
watchers. 
Such 
actions, 
Mr. 
Speaker, raise very legitimate doubts 
surrounding transparency and account-
ability of Presidential election. 
Further adding to the frustration and 
distrust felt by millions in Pennsyl-
vania, the media projected the out-
come while such valid disputes were 
outstanding before due process took 
place and well before judicial rulings 
were made. 
In Pennsylvania, the cases before the 
courts could involve tens of thousands 
of ballots, of votes, an amount, if 
deemed unlawful, would mandate an 
automatic recount. In a close election, 
counting all legal votes takes time, yet 
it is absolutely essential to assure to a 
candidate, but more so to the voters, 
that the vote count be honest, lawful, 
and fair. 
The implications for our country are 
significant now and beyond 2020. Along 
with a fair election of the United 
States of America President, what is at 
stake here is the integrity of our elec-
tion process and the faith the Amer-
ican people have in it.

CONGRATULATING 
JIMMY 
RAY 
FOR BEING VETERAN OF THE 
YEAR 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. CARTER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to congratulate Jimmy 
Ray of Chatham County for being rec-
ognized as Veteran of the Year by the 
Veterans Council of Chatham County. 
Georgia’s First Congressional Dis-
trict is home to many of our Nation’s 
veterans, so being recognized as Vet-
eran of the Year is an incredible honor. 
With this title, Jimmy will represent 
the Veterans Council at various events 
throughout the year. 
Jimmy is a past commander of the 
American Legion, Chatham Post 36, 
which is an organization dedicated to 
advocating for patriotism across the 
United States. Among his many life-
time achievements, he helped spear-
head the fundraising and construction 
of the World War II Memorial on River 
Street in Savannah. 
He has also been an active member of 
the Savannah St. Patrick’s Day Parade 
Committee for 35 years, and was even 
the 2013 parade grand marshal. 
I can’t thank Jimmy enough for his 
outstanding service to our Nation 
throughout his life, and I want to con-
gratulate him again on this wonderful 
accomplishment. 
CONGRATULATING SCDATACOM, LLC FOR RECEIV-
ING PLATINUM AWARD FROM HIRE VETS ME-
DALLION PROGRAM 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, 
I 
rise 
today 
to 
congratulate 
scDataCom, LLC, for being selected as 
an awardee of the HIRE Vets Medallion 
Program. 
The program was established by the 
Honoring Investments in Recruiting 
and Employing American Military Vet-
erans Act of 2017, or the HIRE Vets 
Act. 
The HIRE Vets Medallion Program is 
the only Federal program that recog-
nizes and honors job creators for their 
investments in recruiting, employing, 
and retaining our Nation’s veterans. I 
am proud to say scDataCom, LLC, 
which is based out of Savannah, Geor-
gia, 
achieved 
this 
small 
platinum 
award. 
In order to qualify for this particular 
award, at least 10 percent of the em-
ployees must be veterans. ScDataCom 
is a nationally recognized small busi-
ness specializing in the design, instal-
lation, and service of physical and elec-
tronic security systems for both pri-
vate and public sector clients. 
It was founded by Alaina and Kath-
leen, a successful mother-daughter duo. 
I want to congratulate Alaina and 
Kathleen again for this wonderful ac-
complishment. I am thankful for the 
work they do to serve their community 
and veterans, and I wish them the best. 
CONGRATULATING CAMDEN COUNTY FOR RECEIV-
ING CERTIFICATE OF ACHIEVEMENT FOR EX-
CELLENCE IN FINANCIAL REPORTING 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to congratulate Camden 
County in Georgia’s First Congres-
sional District for being awarded the 
Certificate of Achievement for Excel-
lence in Financial Reporting from the 
Government Finance Officers Associa-
tion of the United States and Canada. 
Camden County was recognized for 
its Comprehensive Annual Financial 
Report, or CAFR, for the fiscal year 
which ended June 30, 2019. 
The CAFR is judged by an impartial 
panel, and the high standards of the 
program include demonstrating a con-
structive spirit of full disclosure. In 
doing this, Camden County clearly 
communicated its financial story. 
This is a great honor because the cer-
tificate of achievement is the highest 
form of recognition in the area of gov-
ernment accounting and financial re-
porting. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate 
Camden County and its management 
for this significant accomplishment, 
and I express my gratitude for the 
work that they do for our community. 
b 1045 
CONGRATULATING BRIAN A. MIXON 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to congratulate Brian 
Mixon on his retirement after 4 years 
of Active Duty and 32 years of civilian 
service with the Department of the 
Army. 
Brian served honorably as an air traf-
fic and airspace officer and was recog-
nized for his work when he was award-
ed the Air Traffic Control Manager of 
the Year Award by the Air Traffic Con-
trol Association in 2019. The national 
award is formally known as the Gen-
eral E.R. Quesada Memorial Award, 
and it is a medallion award presented 
to 
an 
individual 
for 
outstanding 
achievement and contribution during 
the previous year as an air traffic con-
trol manager. 
This is not the first time Brian has 
been recognized for his exceptional 
work. He also earned two other na-
tional awards, among many others. 
Hunter Army Airfield in Georgia’s 
First Congressional District is one of 
the premier power projection platforms 
in the Army, which is utilized to de-
ploy thousands of soldiers and essential 
equipment. Brian’s contributions have 
been essential to the readiness capa-
bilities of the units that utilized Hun-
ter Army Airfield. 
Mr. Speaker, I can’t thank Brian 
enough for his many years of steadfast 
dedication in serving our great Nation, 
and I wish him the best as he begins his 
retirement.

H5875 
November 18, 2020 
God of mercy, we give You thanks for 
giving us another day. 
Bless the Members of the people’s 
House with focus and purpose as they 
gather these few days before Thanks-
giving. May their efforts give true 
cause for Americans to gather to give 
thanks. 
In our world, there are many places 
where peace is lacking and cause for 
thanksgiving rare. Send Your spirit of 
peace upon our world. Help us all see in 
those we view as enemies our brothers 
and sisters. 
As infections continue to spread, and 
hospitals nationwide are pressed to 
their limits, inspire all leaders to step 
forward in a unified response, protect 
and empower those who care for the 
sick, and bring healing to all who suf-
fer during this plague. 
May all that is done this day be for 
Your greater honor and glory. 
Amen.

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman 
from California (Mr. HARDER) come for-
ward and lead the House in the Pledge 
of Allegiance. 
Mr. HARDER of California led the 
Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
The SPEAKER. The Chair will now 
take this opportunity to make an an-
nouncement concerning floor practice 
during the coronavirus pandemic. 
First, the Chair wishes to underscore 
the importance of safe practices during 
votes. As the Chair stated on July 29, 
2020, under clause 2 of rule I, the Chair 
is required to preserve order and deco-
rum in the Chamber. This includes the 
responsibility to ensure the protection 
of Member and staff health and safety 
during proceedings. 
To that end, based upon health and 
safety guidance from the attending 
physician and the Sergeant at Arms, 
the Chair would advise that all Mem-
bers should leave the Chamber prompt-
ly after casting their votes. Further-
more, Members should avoid congre-
gating in the rooms leading to the 
Chamber, 
including 
the 
Speaker’s 
lobby. 
As a reminder, the Chair will con-
tinue the recent practice of providing 
small groups of Members with a min-
imum of 5 minutes within which to 
cast their votes. Members are encour-
aged to vote with their previously as-
signed group. After voting, Members 
must clear the Chamber to allow the 
next group a safe and sufficient oppor-
tunity to vote. 
It is essential for the health and safe-
ty of Members, staff, and the U.S. Cap-
itol Police to consistently practice so-
cial distancing and to ensure that a 
safe capacity be maintained in the 
Chamber at all times. The Sergeant at 
Arms is directed to enforce this policy. 
Second, the Chair wishes to remind 
Members that the announcement of 
July 29, 2020, regarding the wearing of 
masks in the Hall of the House remains 
in effect. Members and staff will not be 
permitted to enter the Hall of the 
House without wearing a mask. Masks 
will be available at the entry points for 
any Member who forgets to bring one. 
To reiterate, the Chair views the fail-
ure to wear masks as a serious breach 
of decorum. 
I repeat, Members and staff will not 
be permitted to enter the Hall of the 
House without wearing a mask. 
The Chair appreciates the attention 
of all Members and staff to these prin-
ciples. 
f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
The SPEAKER. The Chair will enter-
tain up to 15 requests for 1-minute 
speeches on each side of the aisle. 
f 
WHAT IS HAPPENING IN 
WASHINGTON? 
(Mr. HARDER of California asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. HARDER of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to ask: What the 
hell is happening in Washington? 
I am not one to spend my time 
throwing bombs on this floor, but dur-
ing this single minute, another Amer-
ican will die from COVID, and even 
more people are slipping into poverty 
because this town can’t get its act to-
gether. 
I have had enough. 
Millions of people can’t get to work. 
They can’t put food on the table. They 
are missing rent or mortgage pay-
ments. 
Since we passed the CARES Act, 
which was a strong step forward, the 
best this town can do is finger-point-
ing. 
It is disgusting. 
Everyone believes we are incapable of 
doing our jobs, and right now, we are 
proving them right. 
The reality is, there is plenty of 
blame to go around, but Americans 
need another stimulus check. They 
needed it months ago. 
We need expanded unemployment 
back, especially now that cases are ex-
ploding at a higher rate than at any 
other point during this pandemic. 
It is time to grow up. It is time to do 
what we are paid for. It is time to do 
our jobs. 
PASS 
SOS 
ACT 
TO 
HELP 
LIVE 
MUSIC VENUES SURVIVE PAN-
DEMIC SHUTDOWNS 
(Mr. WILLIAMS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to urge passage of the Save Our 
Cities and Stages Act, better known as 
the Save Our Stages Act, as a stand-
alone bill so that independent live 
music venues can survive and recover 
from COVID–19. 
During this pandemic, these venues 
have been hardest hit, as they were the 
first to close and will be among the 
last to reopen due to safety restric-
tions and government mandates. 
They generate billions of dollars in 
our national economy and create thou-
sands of jobs every year. They are a 
cultural staple in central Texas and 
the 25th District, unlike any other 
place in our Nation. 
Over the last several months, I have 
had the privilege of working with own-
ers and managers of dozens of venues 
like Hudson’s On Mercer Street in 
Dripping Springs, Songbird Live in 
Cleburne, and The Broken Spoke in 
Austin to highlight the urgency of 
passing this legislation. 
It is crucial we deliver, not only for 
their livelihoods, but for the artists 
who start out on their stages and the 
future generations inspired by their 
work. Every day we waste is detri-
mental to this industry. 
Mr. Speaker, I call on Speaker 
PELOSI to bring the Save Our Stages 
Act to the House floor for a vote. 
In God we trust.

AMERICAN DEMOCRACY AT WORK 
(Mr. BERA asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. BERA. Mr. Speaker, today I am 
proud of American democracy, and I 
want to talk about American democ-
racy. 
In this election, record numbers of 
voters turned out to cast their ballots, 
with very few voting irregularities. 
A record number of young people 
turned out to cast their ballots and ex-
press their voice by voting. 
We saw civil servants and folks tab-
ulating those ballots. We saw American 
democracy at work, and we ought to be 
proud of that. 
On January 20, we will welcome 
President Biden and Vice President 
KAMALA HARRIS in a peaceful transfer 
of power. 
God bless the United States, and God 
bless our democracy.

upon her retirement after a long and 
accomplished career at Baldwin EMC. 
Donna’s community involvement and 
professional accolades have led me and 
many others to call her the Queen of 
Baldwin County. 
I do not bestow that designation 
lightly. I have known and worked with 
Donna for many years, dating back to 
my time in the Alabama State Senate 
two decades ago. She was a force even 
then, and her level of service and influ-
ence in southwest Alabama have only 
grown. 
She is recognized across the region 
for being an asset to Baldwin EMC and 
their thousands of customers as well as 
the community at large. 
I wish Donna my sincerest best wish-
es in her retirement. I have no doubt 
she will remain a fixture in the com-
munity she so humbly and ably serves.

FEDERAL EXECUTIONS DURING A 
PANDEMIC IS MORALLY BANK-
RUPT 
(Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, tomorrow, the Federal Government 
will execute a Black man named Or-
lando Hall in the middle of a deadly 
pandemic that is spiking toward un-
precedented levels. The death penalty 
is cruel, unusual, barbaric, and im-
moral. 
Mr. Hall will be the eighth prisoner 
executed under Bill Barr’s leadership 
since June—eight expedited executions 
since June in this country—and the 
first by a lame duck President in a cen-
tury, the eighth one being done tomor-
row. 
Carrying out Federal executions dur-
ing a deadly pandemic puts hundreds of 
people at risk, from local community 
members, to Bureau of Prison employ-
ees, to lawyers and advocates. 
The Trump administration’s choice 
to risk life in an expedited rush to take 
life is morally bankrupt. 
To quote my dear friend and late col-
league Elijah Cummings, we, as United 
States citizens, are better than this.

CONGRATULATING 
MOLDOVA’S 
NEWLY 
ELECTED 
PRESIDENT 
MAIA SANDU 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, congratulations to former 
Prime Minister Maia Sandu on being 
elected the new President of Moldova 
on Sunday. 
Correspondent Corneliu Rusnac has 
reported, ‘‘Pro-Western candidate wins 
Moldovan Presidential election,’’ and 
that ‘‘Maia Sandu, a former World 
Bank economist who favors closer ties 
with the European Union, has won 
Moldova’s Presidential runoff vote, de-
cisively defeating the staunchly pro- 
Russian incumbent, according to pre-
liminary results released Monday.’’ 
It should always be remembered that 
Moldova was the first victim of Putin- 
maintained aggression by the occupa-
tion of Transnistria in 1991, which was 
a tragic prelude to the illegal Putin oc-
cupation of territories in the Republic 
of Georgia in 2008 and eastern Ukraine 
in 2014, where over 13,000 citizens have 
died. All three illegal Putin occupa-
tions persist today. 
Americans are so grateful for this re-
newed 
opportunity 
to 
work 
with 
Moldova 
and 
congratulate 
the 
Moldovan people on their new Presi-
dent. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops, 
and we will never forget September 
11th in the global war on terrorism. 
God bless the people of Moldova.

DESPERATE CALL FOR HELP 
MUST BE ANSWERED 
(Mr. DEUTCH asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. 
DEUTCH. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
the 
COVID–19 pandemic is raging; 1 million 
cases in a single week; more than 
100,000 cases each day since November 
4. 
Yet, as we head into the Thanks-
giving holiday, I am so grateful for the 
nonprofit 
community 
organizations 
that are helping to get us through this: 
neighbors helping neighbors, serving 
meals, caring for seniors, and those 
with disabilities, housing, and job as-
sistance, and more. 
They are essential cords of our safety 
net, but that safety net is fraying. 
Calls to Broward County’s 211 helpline 
quadrupled when the pandemic hit, and 
have seen a surge ever since. 
With Federal assistance expiring, the 
calls get more desperate, and now the 
helpers are calling for help. Congress 
must answer that call. There is noth-
ing more important in this body right 
now than getting help out to our com-
munities. 
The House, the Senate, the White 
House must get that help through the 
COVID–19 wave that is crashing across 
our country as we begin this holiday 
season. 
The American people are desperate— 
desperate, Mr. Speaker. We can wait no 
longer.

HONORING 
THE 
CAREER 
OF 
RODERIC 
WOODRUFF 
GROAT, 
A/K/A ROD WOOD 
(Mr. KATKO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the distinguished career 
of central New York broadcasting leg-
end Roderic Woodruff Groat, and to 
celebrate his retirement after more 
than 50 years on television in our com-
munity. 
Better known as ‘‘Rod Wood,’’ he is a 
household name in central New York 
and a trusted source of news through-
out our region. For five decades, he has 
been there to deliver the news to fami-
lies throughout our community. 
Before beginning his career in broad-
casting, Rod proudly served in the U.S. 
Army with the 504th Military Police 
Battalion. 
In 
1976, 
he 
worked 
on 
NewsChannel 9, and has been a fixture 
at the station ever since. 
Outside of work, Rod is extremely de-
voted to his family. He stood in sup-
port of his wife, Nanette, through her 
9-year battle with cancer, and proudly 
celebrated 52 years of marriage before 
her passing earlier this year. Together, 
Rod and Nanette raised 5 children and 
were blessed with 10 grandchildren. 
The dean of central New York broad-
casting, our community will truly miss 
welcoming Rod Wood into our commu-
nities and our homes every evening. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in 
the House to join me in honoring Rod 
Wood for a remarkable 50-year career 
in journalism. I wish him all the best 
in his retirement.

FEDERAL INVESTMENT IN 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
(Ms. PLASKETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, as a 
Member of Congress representing the 
Virgin Islands, I came to Congress de-
termined to increase long-term Federal 
investment in infrastructure, among 
other things. 
I congratulate the Transportation 
and Infrastructure Committee chair-
man, Mr. DEFAZIO; Highways and Tran-
sit Subcommittee chair, Ms. NORTON; 
and other committees for H.R. 2, the 
Moving Forward Act. 
In the midst of so much uncertainty 
in the economy during the current pub-
lic health crisis, the American people 
need the certainty of H.R. 2 to count on 
stable and strong investment in infra-
structure to sustain and create jobs, 
and enhance the mobility and safety of 
American motorists, passengers, and 
throughput systems. 
The Moving Forward Act makes a 
real investment in America, especially 
in underserved districts like my own. 
While all of the States have received 
small and steady increases in funding 
over the recent decade, severe cuts 
have disproportionately and negatively 
affected Americans in U.S. territories. 
In the meantime, substandard high-
ways, roads, and stormwater infra-
structure have further affected harsh 
weather patterns. In my district, we 
still feel the aftermath of major cat-
egory 5 hurricanes every day. It has 
been our new normal for some time be-
fore the current COVID normal. 
We know firsthand that there are

CONGRATULATING MARILYN 
BLACK ON HER RETIREMENT 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
Marilyn Black of Oil City, Pennsyl-
vania, and congratulate her on her re-
tirement. 
I cannot possibly overstate Marilyn’s 
impact on Oil City and the surrounding 
area. Marilyn served as the vice presi-
dent for Heritage Development of the 
Oil Region Alliance of Business, Indus-
try & Tourism for 15 years. 
In those 15 years, Marilyn worked 
tirelessly to preserve the region’s her-
itage in some of the region’s most pre-
cious historical sites, including: the 
Tarbell House, Neilltown Church, and 
Coal Oil Johnny House, just to name a 
few. 
Marilyn’s hard work and dedication 
has not gone unnoticed. Earlier this 
year, Bill Moon, the mayor of Oil City, 
Pennsylvania, declared June 13 to be 
Marilyn Black Day. 
I think Betsy Kellner, secretary of 
the Oil Region Alliance’s board of di-
rectors, summed it up best: ‘‘When you 
look around the community at the 
many accomplishments that have hap-
pened, you can see Marilyn’s touch.’’ 
When Marilyn is not hard at work for 
the oil region, she enjoys the outdoors, 
spending 
time 
fishing, 
boating, 
kayaking, hiking, and more. 
I would like to send my very best 
wishes to Marilyn as she begins her 
much-deserved retirement.

CONDEMNING ACTS BY PEOPLE’S 
REPUBLIC OF CHINA AND GOV-
ERNMENT OF HONG KONG SPE-
CIAL 
ADMINISTRATIVE 
REGION 
THAT 
VIOLATE 
FUNDAMENTAL 
RIGHTS 
AND 
FREEDOMS 
OF 
HONG KONG RESIDENTS 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and agree to the reso-
lution (H. Res. 1033) condemning acts 
by the People’s Republic of China and 
the Government of the Hong Kong Spe-
cial Administrative Region that vio-
late fundamental rights and freedoms 
of Hong Kong residents as well as acts 
that undermine Hong Kong’s high de-
gree of autonomy, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the resolu-
tion. 
The text of the resolution is as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 1033 
Whereas the Government of the People’s 
Republic of China (‘‘PRC’’) is legally bound 
to guarantee the civil liberties of the people 
of Hong Kong through 2047 and the ‘‘Joint 
Declaration of the Government of the United 
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ire-
land and the Government of the People’s Re-
public of China on the Question of Hong 
Kong’’ (hereafter the ‘‘Joint Declaration’’), 
in which the People’s Republic of China com-
mitted that for 50 years, the basic policies 
would remain unchanged, including keeping 
the ‘‘social and economic systems in Hong 
Kong’’ unchanged; 
Whereas Article 39 of the Basic Law of 
Hong Kong mandates that: ‘‘The provisions 
of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, the International Covenant 
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 
and international labour conventions as ap-
plied to Hong Kong shall remain in force and 
shall be implemented through the laws of the 
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.’’; 
Whereas the Joint Declaration states that 
‘‘Rights and freedoms, including those of the 
person, of speech, of the press, of assembly, 
of association, of travel, of movement, of 
correspondence, of strike, of choice of occu-
pation, of academic research and of religious 
belief will be ensured by law in the Hong 
Kong Special Administrative Region’’ and 
that those rights are reiterated in Chapter 
III of the Basic Law; 
Whereas Chapter III of the Basic Law of 
Hong Kong guarantees Hong Kong residents 
other specific rights and freedoms, includ-
ing— 
(1) freedom of speech, of the press, and of 
publication; 
(2) freedom of association, of assembly, of 
procession, and of demonstration; 
(3) the right and freedom to form and join 
trade unions and to strike; 
(4) freedom from arbitrary or unlawful ar-
rest, detention, or imprisonment; 
(5) freedom from arbitrary or unlawful 
search of, or intrusion into, a Hong Kong 
resident’s home or other premises; 
(6) freedom and privacy of communication; 
(7) freedom of movement within the Hong 
Kong 
Special 
Administrative 
Region 
(‘‘HKSAR’’); 
(8) freedom of emigration to other coun-
tries and regions; 
(9) freedom of conscience; and 
(10) the right to institute legal proceedings 
in the courts against the acts of the execu-
tive authorities and their personnel; 
Whereas the PRC National People’s Con-
gress Standing Committee (NPCSC) has in-
serted a national security law directly into 
Annex III of the Basic Law of Hong Kong, 
and said national security law is purportedly 
intended to prevent and punish acts of ‘‘sepa-
rating the country, subverting state power, 
and organizing terroristic activities’’; 
Whereas said action is a flagrant violation 
of Hong Kong’s autonomy and rule of law in 
that Article 18 of the Basic Law provides 
that laws included in Annex III are ‘‘confined 
to those relating to defense and foreign af-
fairs as well as other matters outside the 
limits of the autonomy of the Region as 
specified by this Law’’; 
Whereas Article 11 of the Joint Declaration 
states that ‘‘The maintenance of public order 
in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Re-
gion will be the responsibility of the Govern-
ment of the Hong Kong Special Administra-
tive Region’’; 
Whereas the national security law promul-
gated by the NPCSC violates Article 11 of 
the Joint Declaration by establishing PRC 
entities in Hong Kong with powers over pub-
lic order; 
Whereas Article 23 further specifies that 
‘‘[Hong Kong] shall enact laws on its own to 
prohibit any act of treason, secession, sedi-
tion, subversion against the Central People’s 
Government’’; 
Whereas through a similar abuse of Annex 
III of the Basic Law of Hong Kong, the PRC 
Government caused the adoption of the Na-
tional Anthem Law in Hong Kong, which 
curtails the freedom of speech and carries a 
maximum sentence of 3 years, mirroring the 
extent of sentence under the People’s Repub-
lic of China Criminal Law; 
Whereas the PRC Government’s repeated 
and heavy-handed actions to undermine the 
rule of law in Hong Kong and Hong Kong’s 
high degree of autonomy will only further 
escalate the ongoing protests and increase 
public disapproval of the PRC and the 
HKSAR 
Government, 
jeopardizing 
Hong 
Kong’s future as an open and prosperous 
international city; 
Whereas the full Chinese-language text of 
the national security legislation was not re-
vealed until the Hong Kong Chief Executive 
promulgated the law in Hong Kong at 11 p.m. 
on June 30, 2020, making it only the second 
law since 2008 that the NPCSC has passed 
without releasing a draft for public com-
ment; and 
Whereas the imposition of this national se-
curity legislation, which undermines the es-
tablished rights and freedoms of Hong Kong 
residents provided in the Joint Declaration 
and the Basic Law, constitutes a violation of 
commitments made by the PRC under inter-
national law: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives— 
(1) underscores that democratic societies 
around the world stand in solidarity with the 
people of Hong Kong, who face grave threats 
to their inviolable rights and freedoms; 
(2) condemns the action by the People’s 
Republic of China’s National People’s Con-
gress to advance national security legisla-
tion for Hong Kong through irregular proce-
dures, which constitutes a violation of the 
letter and spirit of the Joint Declaration, 
and the Basic Law which is the imple-
menting document of the Joint Declaration; 
(3) asserts that such actions by the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China undermine its credi-
bility within the international community, 
including the People’s Republic of China’s 
credibility in honoring its commitments to 
international 
agreements 
and 
respecting 
internationally recognized human rights; 
(4) calls on the People’s Republic of China 
to immediately rectify provisions of the na-
tional security law inconsistent with the 
Joint Declaration and other provisions of the 
Basic Law including— 
(A) the judicial processes for national secu-
rity cases; and 
(B) the law’s asserted extraterritorial ju-
risdiction; and 
(5) advises the President, the Secretary of 
State, and the Secretary of Treasury to co-
ordinate with allies and partners to respond 
to developments in Hong Kong, including 
by— 
(A) appointing a United Nations Special 
Envoy for Hong Kong; 
(B) encouraging all relevant United Na-
tions special rapporteurs to closely monitor 
and report on People’s Republic of China’s 
policies in Hong Kong, including the Special

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unan-
imous consent that all Members have 5 
legislative days in which to revise and 
extend their remarks and include in 
the RECORD extraneous material on H. 
Res. 1033, as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York. 
There was no objection. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to have au-
thored this bipartisan resolution with 
my friend, Ranking Member MCCAUL. 
This summer, Beijing imposed a na-
tional security law in Hong Kong, the 
latest step in Xi Jinping’s campaign to 
undermine Hong Kong’s autonomy and 
criminalize any opposition. 
In the last few weeks, we have seen 
China escalate efforts to squash all dis-
sent and attack Hong Kongers’ rights. 
They have rounded up and arrested 
prodemocracy activists in Hong Kong 
and even issued an arrest warrant for a 
U.S. citizen. They have purged pro-
democracy duly elected leaders from 
the Legislative Council of Hong Kong, 
one of the most important democratic 
institutions in the city and the single 
greatest example of the one country, 
two systems framework under attack 
from Beijing. 
The Chinese Government’s actions 
violate the will of the Hong Kong peo-
ple and Beijing’s commitment to the 
international community made under 
the Sino-British Joint Declaration. H. 
Res. 1033 condemns Beijing’s effort to 
further erode Hong Kong’s autonomy, 
undermine its independent judiciary, 
and oppress its people. 
This measure urges the administra-
tion to work with our allies and part-
ners to hold China accountable for its 
flagrant violations of international law 
and assaults on Hong Kongers and their 
fundamental rights. 
It also pushes for emigration options 
for Hong Kongers facing well-founded 
fears of persecution. This resolution is 
an important demonstration of our bi-
partisan commitment to democratic 
freedoms in Hong Kong. 
Mr. Speaker, I hope all of my col-
leagues will join me in supporting its 
passage, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong 
support of H. Res. 1033, Chairman 
ENGEL’s resolution condemning the 
violation of Hong Kong’s freedom. On 
June 30, the Chinese Communist Party, 
or the CCP, used its sham legislature 
to enforce a dystopian national secu-
rity law on Hong Kong. 
This law criminalizes basic civil lib-
erties, destroyed the one country, two 
systems model of autonomy for Hong 
Kong, and inserts the CCP’s police 
state in Hong Kong to crush dissent. 
After more than a year of a prodemoc-
racy movement that inspired people 
around the world to fight for liberty 
over tyranny, this law was the CCP’s 
response. 
Rather than tolerate criticism and 
consider reform, they doubled down on 
totalitarianism. 
The 
CCP 
violated 
their international obligations, obliter-
ated Hong Kong’s freedom, and shred-
ded the Sino-British Treaty that guar-
anteed human rights in Hong Kong. 
Since the law was enacted, we have 
seen countless young people arrested 
for 
free 
speech. 
Others 
have 
dis-
appeared into mainland Chinese black 
prisons. The CCP has canceled elec-
tions to prevent opposition victories. 
Just last week, the CCP used its sham 
legislature to assert full control over 
the Legislative Council of Hong Kong, 
destroying Hong Kong’s last remaining 
shreds of self-government. 
They know that the Communist 
Party cannot survive with free-think-
ing people. The CCP’s human rights 
abuses in Hong Kong are far from over, 
but neither is Hong Kong’s fight for 
freedom. 
Chairman ENGEL’s resolution con-
tinues our bipartisan work to call out 
the CCP’s abuse and stand with Hong 
Kong. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this measure, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
b 1230 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
again thank the ranking member. I 
thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. 
YOHO) for joining with me to introduce 
this measure condemning Beijing’s vio-
lations of international law and at-
tacks on Hong Kong’s democratic free-
doms. It is really important that we 
speak with one voice—both Democrats 
and Republicans—to let Beijing know 
that we are not just going to close our 
eyes to what they are doing to the peo-
ple of Hong Kong. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues 
to support this very important resolu-
tion, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, sadly, we no longer see 
American flags flying over the thou-
sands of protesters in the streets of 
Hong Kong. Displaying our symbol of 
liberty has become a criminal act pun-
ishable by life in prison. But even 
though the freedom-loving people of 
Hong Kong can no longer ask for our 
support, we still hear their call. It is 
more important than ever to continue 
to stand with Hong Kong. 
So, Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman 
ENGEL for offering this resolution, I 
urge my colleagues to support this 
measure, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
ENGEL) that the House suspend the 
rules and agree to the resolution, H. 
Res. 1033, as amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the resolu-
tion, as amended, was agreed to. 
The title of the resolution was 
amended so as to read: ‘‘A resolution 
Condemning acts by the People’s Re-
public of China and the Government of 
the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region that violate fundamental rights 
and freedoms of Hong Kong residents 
as well as acts that undermine Hong 
Kong’s high degree of autonomy’’. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I move to

lution (H. Res. 697) recognizing the sig-
nificance of the genuine autonomy of 
Tibet and the Tibetan people and the 
work His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama 
has done to promote global peace, har-
mony, and understanding, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the resolu-
tion. 
The text of the resolution is as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 697 
Whereas the Dalai Lama’s principal com-
mitments 
include 
cultivation 
of 
warm- 
heartedness and such human values as com-
passion and forgiveness; promotion of reli-
gious harmony; and preservation of Tibetan 
language and culture and protection of Ti-
bet’s natural environment; 
Whereas the Dalai Lama has stated, ‘‘I re-
main convinced that most human conflicts 
can be solved through genuine dialogue con-
ducted with the spirit of openness and rec-
onciliation’’; 
Whereas, in 1989, the Dalai Lama was 
awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his non-
violent struggle for the liberation of Tibet, 
his advocacy for peaceful solutions to pre-
serve Tibetans’ historical and cultural herit-
age, and his constructive, forward-looking

proposals for resolving international con-
flicts, human rights issues, and global envi-
ronmental problems; 
Whereas Congress has consistently shown 
overwhelming, bipartisan, bicameral support 
for the Tibetan people’s aspirations for inter-
nationally recognized human rights and free-
doms and the protection of their distinct re-
ligious, cultural, linguistic, and historical 
identity, including by passing the Tibetan 
Policy Act of 2002 (Public Law 107–228; 22 
U.S.C. 6901 note); 
Whereas, in 2006, Congress passed the Four-
teenth 
Dalai 
Lama 
Congressional 
Gold 
Medal Act (Public Law 109–287; 31 U.S.C. 
5111), and in October 2007, President George 
W. Bush, Speaker of the House of Represent-
atives Nancy Pelosi, and other Congressional 
leaders awarded the Dalai Lama the United 
States Congressional Gold Medal, the high-
est civilian honor awarded by Congress, for 
his contributions to peace, nonviolence, 
human rights, and religious understanding; 
Whereas Members of Congress have on 
multiple occasions met with the Dalai Lama 
during congressional delegations overseas, 
including a bipartisan delegation led by 
then-House Speaker Pelosi to meet with the 
Dalai Lama and the Tibetan exiled commu-
nity in 2008, a bipartisan delegation led by 
then-House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi in 
2017, and a bipartisan delegation from the 
House Democracy Partnership in 2019, to 
spotlight the unjust oppression against the 
Tibetan people; 
Whereas the Dalai Lama has on multiple 
occasions visited the United States Capitol, 
including most recently in June 2016, during 
which he met with congressional leadership 
to promote respectful inter-religious har-
mony and protection of the Tibetan people’s 
identity, culture, language, and environ-
ment; 
Whereas the Department of State finds in 
its 2020 Report to Congress on Access to Ti-
betan Areas of the People’s Republic of 
China (PRC), as required by the Reciprocal 
Access to Tibet Act of 2018 (Public Law 115– 
330), that the Chinese Government system-
atically impeded travel to the Tibet Autono-
mous Region (TAR) and Tibetan areas out-
side the TAR for United States diplomats 
and officials, journalists, and tourists in 
2019; 
Whereas, in 2018, the Secretary of State 
convened the first-ever Ministerial to Ad-
vance Religious Freedom, during which the 
Dalai Lama addressed hundreds of members 
of religious organizations and civil society 
by video; 
Whereas under the Tibetan Policy Act of 
2002, it is the policy of the United States to 
support 
economic 
development, 
cultural 
preservation, health care, and education and 
environmental sustainability for Tibetans 
inside Tibet; 
Whereas the human rights situation in 
Tibet has significantly deteriorated since 
the Tibetan Policy Act of 2002 was signed 
into law; 
Whereas the Government of the People’s 
Republic of China’s repeated insistence that 
it must control the selection of the next 
leader of Tibetan Buddhism, a religion with 
adherents across the globe including in Mon-
golia, where a 2010 census reports 53 percent 
of individuals ages 15 and older self-identify 
as Buddhists, is a gross violation of inter-
national religious freedom; 
Whereas the House of Representatives 
overwhelmingly passed H.R. 4331, the Ti-
betan Policy and Support Act of 2019, which 
reiterates support for the Tibetan commu-
nity and the need to hold Chinese officials 
responsible for religious freedom abuses tar-
geting Tibetan Buddhists; 
Whereas after 35 years, the United States 
Consulate in Chengdu, which was responsible 
for operations in and providing diplomatic 
reporting on developments concerning Ti-
betan populations in southwestern China and 
the Tibet Autonomous Region, closed on 
July 27, 2020; and 
Whereas on September 12, 2020, the Dalai 
Lama addressed a virtual session of the 
Group of Seven annual meeting of Speakers 
and Heads of Parliament hosted by Speaker 
of the House of Representatives Nancy 
Pelosi: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives— 
(1) affirms the cultural and religious sig-
nificance of the goal of genuine autonomy 
for the people of Tibet and the deep bond be-
tween the American and Tibetan people; 
(2) supports the efforts of the Dalai Lama 
and the Tibetan leadership to achieve gen-
uine autonomy for Tibetans through nego-
tiations without preconditions with the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China; 
(3) supports the 14th Dalai Lama’s commit-
ment to global peace, nonviolence, human 
rights, and environmental protection and 
sustainability; 
(4) urges the swift enactment of the Ti-
betan Policy and Support Act of 2019 to up-
date United States policy toward Tibet, par-
ticularly on issues related to the succession 
or reincarnation of the Dalai Lama, water 
security and environmental concerns in the 
Tibetan plateau, and support for the Tibetan 
community, language, culture, and religion; 
(5) stresses the urgency of addressing the 
ongoing climate crisis, including in the Ti-
betan Plateau, and working toward environ-
mental and economic justice and equality; 
(6) encourages United States diplomats and 
other officials, journalists, and other citizens 
to seek access to Tibetan areas and demand 
that China provide access and treatment re-
ciprocal to access and treatment the United 
States provides to Chinese diplomats and 
other officials, scholars, and others in the 
United States; 
(7) calls on the Secretary of State to miti-
gate any potential impact the closure of the 
United States Consulate in Chengdu may 
have on the Department of State’s ability to 
provide timely reporting on and support for 
Tibetan communities, such as by allocating 
additional resources to other United States 
missions in China to improve coverage; and 
(8) determines that it would be beneficial 
to continue years of bipartisan and bi-
cameral engagement with the leaders of the 
Tibetan people, including between Members 
of Congress and His Holiness the 14th Dalai 
Lama. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. ENGEL) and the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. YOHO) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unan-
imous consent that all Members have 5 
legislative days in which to revise and 
extend their remarks and include ex-
traneous material on H. Res. 697. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, Congress has consist-
ently demonstrated bipartisan and bi-
cameral support for the Tibetan com-
munity, and I hope it does so again by 
supporting Mr. YOHO’s, the gentleman 
from Florida, legislation. 
The Chinese Government has repeat-
edly insisted that it must control the 
selection of the next leader of Tibetan 
Buddhism—a 
flagrant 
violation 
of 
international religious freedom. 
We are seeing additional signs of Bei-
jing’s efforts to exert more control, as 
it has already done in Inner Mongolia 
and Xinjiang. Radio Free Asia’s Ti-
betan Service has reported that the 
rail line being constructed to connect 
Chengdu to Nyingtri in the Tibetan 
Autonomous Region will tighten Bei-
jing’s grip on Tibet. 
In addition, the State Department 
has found that the Chinese Govern-
ment has systematically impeded trav-
el to the Tibetan Autonomous Region 
and Tibetan areas for U.S. diplomats 
and officials, journalists, and tourists. 
After 
the 
Trump 
administration 
closed the Chinese Consulate in Hous-
ton, the Chinese Government retali-
ated by demanding the closure of the 
U.S. Consulate in Chengdu. This con-
sulate, among other things, was re-
sponsible for providing reports on de-
velopments concerning Tibet, and its 
closure risks further undermining our 
ability to understand developments in 
the region. 
H. Res. 697 affirms and supports Dalai 
Lama’s teachings and commitment to 
global 
peace, 
nonviolence, 
human 
rights, and environmental protection. 
It also encourages further implementa-
tion of the Reciprocal Access to Tibet 
Act of 2018. Finally, it calls on the Sec-
retary of State to mitigate impacts of 
the closure of the U.S. Consulate in 
Chengdu. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support 
this measure, I encourage my col-
leagues to do the same, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H. Res. 697, recognizing the genuine 
autonomy of Tibet and the vital work 
the Dalai Lama has done to promote 
peace around the world. 
Over 60 years ago, His Holiness the 
14th Dalai Lama was forced into exile 
by the Chinese Communist Party’s full- 
scale military takeover of Tibet. To 
this very day, the CCP uses propa-
ganda, violence, and oppression to as-
sert totalitarian control over Tibet and 
the Tibetan people. The CCP sees Ti-
bet’s cultural and religious heritage as 
a threat to its control. Just as they 
have done with Islam and Christianity, 
the CCP is trying to stamp out Tibetan 
Buddhism and Tibetans’ way of life— 
even though Tibet is guaranteed auton-
omy under China’s constitution. 
Despite these challenges, the Dalai 
Lama has stood as a leader in the pro-
motion of human rights and religious 
harmony and the preservation of Ti-
betan culture and religion. The Dalai 
Lama’s contribution to peace and non-
violence has been revered by the inter-
national community, and for decades 
the U.S. Congress has remained com-
mitted to strengthening the relation-
ship between the U.S. and the Tibetan 
people.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5880 
November 18, 2020 
I would like to thank His Holiness 
the 14th Dalai Lama for his dedication 
to the Tibetan people. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this measure, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 697 
is a strong measure that encourages 
the continuation of close engagement 
between the United States and Tibet. I 
therefore urge Members to support it, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. PERRY). 
Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I am proud 
to join my friend, the gentleman from 
Florida, in support of this important 
resolution. 
We know as a fact, confirmed by Reu-
ters, the New York Post, and many 
other news outlets, that the Chinese 
Communist Party has recently forced 
500,000 Tibetans into labor camps— 
500,000. 
Through these camps the CCP wishes 
to sinicize the Tibetan people and de-
stroy their religious and cultural herit-
age and national identity. 
If you asked the General Secretary 
Xi Jinping why his country continues 
to undermine the national identity of 
the Tibetan people, he would tell you 
that his party’s initiative is simply 
part of a poverty alleviation program 
wherein the CCP hopes to move surplus 
rural labor to other parts of the coun-
try. It is absurd, and it is outrageous. 
The fact that a foreign leader could be-
lieve that this kind of public policy is 
morally acceptable is beyond me, and 
it is beyond the civilized world. We 
have heard similar explanations before. 
We know what these so-called pov-
erty alleviation programs are really 
about: Xi Jinping desperately wants to 
crush the spirits of those who are liv-
ing under his dictatorial regime. He 
wants to indoctrinate people in those 
camps and ruthlessly marginalize their 
identities. 
Mr. Speaker, you don’t need camps 
for people who are seeking to do better 
in their life; you just give them the op-
portunity, and they will do it. They 
don’t need to go to camp to do that. 
He will fail in his effort. Make no 
mistake about it. He will fail spectacu-
larly in his effort to quash the hopes of 
millions of Tibetans who dare to dream 
and fight for a free nation. One of the 
reasons he will fail is because the 
United States is with the people of 
Tibet. 
Our Tibetan friends have long since 
recognized the significance of the gen-
uine autonomy of Tibet, and today I 
am proud to join them. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 697 
is a strong measure that encourages 
the continuation of close engagement 
between the United States and Tibet. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, since 1959, the U.S. Con-
gress, on a bicameral, bipartisan basis, 
has remained committed to strength-
ening the friendship between the U.S. 
and the Tibetan people. 
There are over 31,000 individuals of 
Tibetan descent living in North Amer-
ica, and our people share similar values 
of freedom and understanding. 
His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama has 
dedicated himself to three principles: 
the promotion of human values, the 
promotion of religious harmony, and 
the preservation of Tibetan culture and 
religion. 
I would like to thank the Dalai Lama 
for his vital contributions to the Ti-
betan people and the world. 
As Mr. PERRY said, the Communist 
Party knows they cannot survive with 
free thought, and that is what religion 
does for people around the world. They 
put a deity or a higher power above 
them, whereas, in China, the highest 
power that can be achieved is the Com-
munist Party, and therefore it will not 
survive. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this measure, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I urge a 
‘‘yes’’ vote, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
ENGEL) that the House suspend the 
rules and agree to the resolution, H. 
Res. 697, as amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the resolu-
tion, as amended, was agreed to. 
The title of the resolution was 
amended so as to read: ‘‘A resolution 
affirming the significance of the advo-
cacy for genuine autonomy for Tibet-
ans in the People’s Republic of China 
and the work His Holiness the 14th 
Dalai Lama has done to promote global 
peace, harmony, and understanding.’’. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
SECURING AMERICA FROM 
EPIDEMICS ACT 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 6334) to authorize United States 
participation in the Coalition for Epi-
demic Preparedness Innovations, and 
for other purposes, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 6334 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Securing 
America From Epidemics Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Due to increasing population and popu-
lation density, human mobility, and ecologi-
cal change, emerging infectious diseases pose 
a real and growing threat to global health 
security. 
(2) While vaccines can be the most effec-
tive tools to protect against infectious dis-
ease, the absence of vaccines for a new or 
emerging infectious disease with epidemic 
potential is a major health security threat 
globally, 
posing 
catastrophic 
potential 
human and economic costs. 
(3) The 1918 influenza pandemic infected 
500,000,000 people, or about one-third of the 
world’s population at the time, and killed 
50,000,000 people—more than died in the First 
World War. 
(4) The economic cost of an outbreak can 
be devastating. The estimated global cost 
today, should an outbreak of the scale of the 
1918 influenza pandemic strike, is 5 percent 
of global gross domestic product. 
(5) Even regional outbreaks can have enor-
mous human costs and substantially disrupt 
the global economy and cripple regional 
economies. The 2014 Ebola outbreak in West 
Africa killed more than 11,000 and cost 
$2,800,000,000 in losses in the affected coun-
tries alone. 
(6) The ongoing novel coronavirus out-
break reflects the pressing need for quick 
and effective vaccine and countermeasure 
development. 
(7) While the need for vaccines to address 
emerging epidemic threats is acute, markets 
to drive the necessary development of vac-
cines to address them—a complex and expen-
sive undertaking—are very often critically 
absent. Also absent are mechanisms to en-
sure access to those vaccines by those who 
need them when they need them. 
(8) To address this global vulnerability and 
the deficit of political commitment, institu-
tional capacity, and funding, in 2017, several 
countries and private partners launched the 
Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innova-
tions (CEPI). CEPI’s mission is to stimulate, 
finance, and coordinate development of vac-
cines for high-priority, epidemic-potential 
threats in cases where traditional markets 
do not exist or cannot create sufficient de-
mand. 
(9) Through funding of partnerships, CEPI 
seeks to bring priority vaccines candidates 
through the end of phase II clinical trials, as 
well as support vaccine platforms that can 
be rapidly deployed against emerging patho-
gens. 
(10) CEPI has funded multiple partners to 
develop vaccine candidates against the novel 
coronavirus, responding to this urgent, glob-
al requirement. 
(11) Support for and participation in CEPI 
is an important part of the United States 
own health security and biodefense and is in 
the national interest, complementing the 
work of many Federal agencies and pro-
viding significant value through global part-
nership and burden-sharing. 
SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION FOR UNITED STATES 
PARTICIPATION. 
(a) IN
GENERAL.—The United States is 
hereby authorized to participate in the Coa-
lition for Epidemic Preparedness Innova-
tions. 
(b) BOARD
OF
DIRECTORS.—The Adminis-
trator for the United States Agency for 
International Development is authorized to 
designate an employee to serve on the Inves-
tors Council of the Coalition for Epidemic 
Preparedness Innovations as a representative

(c) REPORTS TO CONGRESS.—Not later than 
180 days after the date of the enactment of 
this Act, the President shall submit to the 
appropriate congressional committees a re-
port that includes the following: 
(1) The United States planned contribu-
tions to the Coalition for Epidemic Pre-
paredness Innovations and the mechanisms 
for United States participation in such Coa-
lition. 
(2) The manner and extent to which the

The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unan-
imous consent that all Members have 5 
legislative days in which to revise and 
extend their remarks and include in 
the RECORD
extraneous material on 
H.R. 6334. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, we are in a time of cri-
sis. The coronavirus pandemic has dev-
astated our Nation: over 200,000 Ameri-
cans have died, our economy is in 
shambles, our lives have been turned 
upside down. 
The virus continues to spread and 
worsen. Part of this is because there 
had not been the steps taken that we 
know are needed to protect the Amer-
ican people and address this virus head- 
on. 
There is a clear road map ahead on 
how to beat this. We need to establish 
a robust contact tracing and testing 
system and flatten the curve by in-
creasing 
mask 
wearing 
and 
social 
distancing, all while we develop a safe 
and effective vaccine. 
We have heard some good news over 
the past few days about some safe and 
effective vaccines. Over the past weeks 
we have seen this encouraging news, 
and two, in particular, are showing real 
promise. To further develop, produce 
and distribute vaccines, we need to 
work with our partners around the 
world and harness the resources of the 
government’s 
multilateral 
organiza-
tions, public health experts, and the 
private sector. 
We are not satisfied—I am not satis-
fied—with what has been done so far. I 
am glad that we are going back to the 
World Health Organization and will 
reboot our coordination with countries 
around the world. We cannot go this 
alone. This is a worldwide pandemic, 
and we need to work with all the other 
countries to defeat it head-on. 
This bill puts us on the right track to 
do just that. Mr. BERA’s Securing 
America from Epidemics Act would 
allow the United States to participate 
in the Coalition for Epidemic Prepared-
ness Innovations, a public-private part-
nership to speed up vaccine develop-
ment 
for 
infectious 
diseases 
like 
COVID–19 and Ebola. 
Mr. Speaker, this is a good measure 
that would put our country in a strong-
er 
position 
to 
respond 
to 
the 
coronavirus and future pandemics. I 
am proud to support it and I urge my 
colleagues to do the same. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of 
the 
Securing 
America 
from 
Epidemics Act. 
I want to thank my colleague, Con-
gressman Dr. BERA, for introducing 
this bill—and I co-introduced it—for 
his work to address this important 
issue. 
COVID–19 has shown that pandemics 
know no borders and that the United 
States must be prepared to respond to 
disease outbreaks around the world. 
This bill authorizes the United States 
to participate in the Coalition for Epi-
demic Preparedness Innovations, an al-
liance of countries and private partners 
that are financing and coordinating the 
development of new vaccines for infec-
tious diseases. These are the emerging 
diseases that they are studying so that 
we are prepared for them. 
b 1245 
In addition to COVID–19, CEPI has 
developed a list of priority diseases 
with epidemic potential, including vi-
ruses that cause Middle East Res-
piratory 
Syndrome, 
MERS. 
By 
leveraging contributions from member 
states with expertise and funding by 
private partners, CEPI seeks to develop 
vaccines before the disease outbreak 
occurs. 
CEPI estimates that COVID–19 could 
cost the global economy $4.1 trillion, or 
close to 5 percent of global GDP. 
Of course, the impact of viruses like 
COVID–19 is not just measured in the 
disruption of economic stability in na-
tions around the world, but also, unfor-
tunately, in the lives lost. 
Developing vaccines and treatments 
for emerging infectious diseases is not 
just an issue of individual health but of 
national security. Our committee has 
worked together on many pieces of leg-
islation in response to COVID–19. The 
SAFE Act is another example of this 
bipartisan effort. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues 
who believe we must do all we can to 
prevent another pandemic like COVID– 
19 from emerging in the future to sup-
port this legislation, as it is a critical 
component to that effort. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. BERA), author of this im-
portant bill, the chair of the Sub-
committee on Asia, the Pacific, and 
Nonproliferation. 
Mr. BERA. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chairman ENGEL for his leadership and 
support. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of my bipartisan measure, H.R. 6334, 
the Securing America From Epidemics, 
or SAFE Act. This legislation, which I 
introduced alongside my friend, Con-
gressman TED YOHO, would authorize 
U.S. participation in the Coalition for 
Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, or 
CEPI. 
CEPI was created in the aftermath of 
the 2015 West Africa Ebola epidemic. 
Its founders understood that due to 
factors like climate change, over-
crowding, malnutrition, and the prox-
imity of people living next to animals, 
the world would see deadly epidemics 
more and more frequently. The most 
effective 
countermeasures 
to 
these 
epidemics are vaccines. 
CEPI sought to fund vaccines for sev-
eral pathogens like MERS that could 
potentially explode into pandemics. 
And it sought to help develop universal 
vaccine 
platform 
technologies 
that 
could be adapted to quickly address 
emerging outbreaks. The individuals in 
CEPI could not have predicted the cur-
rent COVID–19 pandemic, but they 
knew it was just a matter of time until 
we would see something like this. 
Since the start of the pandemic, 
CEPI has devoted major funding to 
nine 
vaccine 
candidates 
to 
defeat 
COVID–19. In January of this year, 
CEPI was one of the first investors in 
Moderna, providing catalytic funding 
to spur additional research and devel-
opment. That early funding has paid 
off. It looks like Moderna’s Phase 3 
trials have been successful. 
CEPI’s early investment in Moderna 
is a reminder of the critical role CEPI 
plays and will continue to play: invest-
ing in smaller companies to boost their 
capacity, so that larger players and ac-
tors can help scale and bring those vac-
cines to market. This is what happened 
with Moderna and may happen with 
other vaccine candidates. 
USAID recently announced the col-
laboration with CEPI, funding $20 mil-
lion 
over 
5 
years 
to 
combat 
noncoronavirus priority diseases, like 
Lassa fever and Ebola, but we need to 
do more. By authorizing U.S. participa-
tion in CEPI, this bill will enable the 
United States to firmly claim a seat at 
CEPI’s table, shape its priorities and 
governance, and allow Congress to pro-
vide contributions to the organization.

November 18, 2020 
U.S. participation in CEPI was one of 
the recommendations of the final re-
port issued nearly a year ago at the 
Center for Strategic and International 
Studies Commission on Strengthening 
America’s Health Security. It was pre-
scient in its recommendations, and I 
am proud to have served as a commis-
sioner. We knew then that the next epi-
demic or pandemic was around the cor-
ner. It is here with us now, but it will 
not be the last one. 
We need to be a full and active par-
ticipant in CEPI’s work. By working 
through organizations like CEPI to de-
velop new vaccine technologies, we will 
ensure the world is far more ready for 
the next pandemic. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. YOHO and 
all the cosponsors of this important 
legislation, as well as the work that 
the Committee on Foreign Affairs 
staff, like Katy Crosby, and my own 
staff, like Ryan Uyehara, did to bring 
this legislation to the House floor. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this measure and call on the 
Senate to pass it as well. 
Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, in closing, I once again 
thank Representative BERA
for his 
work on this important legislation. 
The U.S. international community and 
the private sector must continue to 
work together to develop the tools we 
need in response to emerging infectious 
diseases. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to 
support this legislation, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to once again thank Mr. BERA for 
his leadership and hard work on this 
legislation that everyone should sup-
port, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
ENGEL) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6334, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

REAFFIRMING VITAL ROLE OF 
UNITED STATES-JAPAN ALLIANCE 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and agree to the reso-
lution (H. Res. 349) reaffirming the 
vital role of the United States-Japan 
alliance in promoting peace, stability, 
and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific re-
gion and beyond, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the resolu-
tion. 
The text of the resolution is as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 349 
Whereas the United States and Japan es-
tablished diplomatic relations on March 31, 
1854, with the signing of the Treaty of Peace 
and Amity; 
Whereas for more than the past 70 years, 
the partnership between the United States 
and Japan has played a vital role in ensuring 
peace, stability, and economic development 
in Asia and beyond; 
Whereas the United States and Japan are 
deeply committed to the common values of 
freedom, democracy, rule of law, and free 
market economies; 
Whereas the current United States-Japan 
alliance, forged over six decades ago with the 
signing of the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation 
and Security, is the cornerstone for stability 
and prosperity of Japan and for the Indo-Pa-
cific region, and plays a key role in global 
peace and stability; 
Whereas the United States and Japan are 
indispensable partners in combating the pro-
liferation of weapons of mass destruction, 
improving global health, countering human 
trafficking and promoting human rights, as-
sisting the victims of conflict and disaster 
worldwide, and contributing to global eco-
nomic development; 
Whereas the United States and Japan have 
worked closely during the COVID–19 pan-
demic to safely repatriate our respective 
citizens home and to strengthen our collabo-
ration on global health research and develop-
ment through partnerships such as the 
United States-Japan Cooperative Medical 
Science Program; 
Whereas the United States and Japan are 
partnering to promote infrastructure invest-
ments around the Indo-Pacific that ensure 
openness, transparency, economic efficiency, 
and debt sustainability, including through 
the United States-Japan Mekong Power 
partnership and the United States-Japan 
Strategic Energy Partnership; 
Whereas the United States, Japan, and 
Australia announced in November 2019 the 
establishment of a Blue Dot Network that 
will promote transparent and quality infra-
structure projects that align with the G20 
Principles for Quality Infrastructure Invest-
ment; 
Whereas the alliance is a testament to the 
ability of great nations to overcome the past 
and jointly work to create a more secure and 
prosperous future; 
Whereas

cial Measures Agreement and other contribu-
tions that directly support operational readi-
ness of United States forces in Japan; 
Whereas the current United States-Japan 
Special Measures Agreement is set to expire 
in March 2021, and the two countries 
launched working-level negotiations on a 
new cost-sharing agreement in October 2020; 
Whereas, in October 2020, the United 
States, Australia, India, and Japan contin-
ued their ongoing cooperation through the 
quad framework and discussed collective ef-
forts to collaborate on COVID–19 pandemic 
response, maritime security, cybersecurity, 
quality 
infrastructure, 
counterterrorism, 
and other areas; 
Whereas our two countries, coming from 
different cultural backgrounds, have created 
an active and dynamic relationship bene-
ficial to both peoples; and 
Whereas cultural and people-to-people ties 
between the United States and Japan are 
long-standing and deep, as exemplified by 
the gift of the beautiful cherry trees that dot 
our nation’s capital from the People of 
Japan to the People of the United States in 
1912, signifying the affection and respect be-
tween the two nations: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives—

States-Japan alliance in promoting peace, 
stability, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific

people-to-people and cultural ties between 
our two nations;

ening of diplomatic, economic, and security 
ties between the United States and Japan; 
(7) reaffirms the vital role of the Quad-
rilateral Security Dialogue as a platform to 
facilitate further collaboration between the 
United States, Australia, India, and Japan 
on matters related to protecting freedom of 
navigation and promoting democratic values 
in the Indo-Pacific; and 
(8) calls for the continued cooperation be-
tween the Governments of the United States 
and Japan in addressing global challenges 
that threaten the security of people every-
where in the ‘‘Reiwa’’ era of Japan, which 
the Japanese Government translates as 
‘‘beautiful harmony’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. ENGEL) and the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. YOHO) each 
will control 20 minutes.

from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unan-
imous consent that all Members have 5 
legislative days in which to revise and 
extend their remarks and include in 
the RECORD extraneous material on H. 
Res. 349, as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. CASTRO for 
authoring this measure reaffirming our 
partnership with Japan, a longstanding 
U.S. ally and an indispensable partner 
for advancing peace, stability, and 
prosperity in Asia and beyond. 
The United States and Japan share a 
commitment 
to 
upholding 
human 
rights, the rule of law, and democratic 
values and freedoms. In challenging 
times like these, it is all the more im-
portant that we work with like-minded 
friends to defend and promote our 
shared interests. 
One of those shared priorities is 
strengthening our alliances. This is 
more important than ever as China’s 
behavior becomes increasingly aggres-
sive and Kim Jong-un in North Korea 
remains unchecked in his challenge to 
regional security and stability. 
H. Res. 349 expresses the bipartisan 
support in Congress for an equitable 
agreement with Japan regarding Host 
Nation Support for our troops before

the current one expires. This is a crit-
ical way to shore up a key ally’s de-
fenses and protect U.S. national inter-
ests. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support 
this resolution reaffirming our com-
mitment to the United States’ partner-
ship with Japan, and I urge all my col-
leagues to do the same. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong 
support of H. Res. 349, a resolution to 
reaffirm the vital role of the U.S.- 
Japan alliance in promoting peace, sta-
bility, and prosperity in the Indo-Pa-
cific region. 
For over six decades, the U.S.-Japan 
alliance has served as a cornerstone for 
security in the Indo-Pacific region and 
will continue to be fundamental to the 
protection of our shared interests. 
Our two democratic nations maintain 
close cooperation on a multitude of 
issues, 
including 
nonproliferation, 
global health, and maritime security. 
In recent years, our alliance has stood 
as a crucial check to China’s increasing 
regional aggression and North Korea’s 
continued nuclear ambitions. 
As the security environment in the 
Indo-Pacific continues to become more 
complex, our alliance will prove to be 
more significant than ever. This reso-
lution reaffirms the importance of this 
longstanding strategic relationship in 
the face of the new threats and chal-
lenges that impact both U.S. and 
Japan. 
Mr. Speaker, as we face what some 
would consider the greatest threat in 
our 
generation, 
the 
Chinese 
Com-
munist Party, the CCP, the United 
States must reaffirm support for our 
alliance with like-minded nations like 
Japan. It is only through mutual co-
operation that we can continue to pro-
tect democratic values and freedoms 
around the world. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this measure, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, as certain actors con-
tinue their aggressive behavior and de-
stabilize the Indo-Pacific region, it is 
critical that we continue to strengthen 
our allies and friends. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support 
this resolution, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
ENGEL) that the House suspend the 
rules and agree to the resolution, H. 
Res. 349, as amended. 
The question was taken; and (two-

Whereas, on August 15, 1948, the Provi-

in the Republic of Korea; 
Whereas, on January 13, 1903, 102 pioneer 
Korean immigrants arrived in the United

Whereas the over 2,000,000 Korean Ameri-

to the economic vitality of the United

other democratic values, has been cru-
cial for promoting international peace 
and security, prosperity, rule of law, 
and freedom in the region and beyond. 
Here at home, we owe much of our 
success to the contributions of the mil-
lions of Koreans and Korean Americans 
living in the United States. Diversity 
has always been a source of America’s 
strength, and the Korean-American 
community is an excellent example of 
that. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support 
this important resolution. I urge my 
colleagues to do the same, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H. Res. 809, expressing the impor-
tance of the alliance between the U.S. 
and the Republic of Korea. 
South Korea continues to be one of 
our most important strategic and eco-
nomic partners in the Indo-Pacific re-
gion. While our alliance focuses heav-
ily 
on 
our 
shared 
concern 
of 
a 
nuclearized North Korea, our two na-
tions also cooperate in areas such as 
democracy, global health, and counter-
terrorism. 
Together, we have made it a priority 
to support and uphold rules-based order 
in the Indo-Pacific region and protect 
the democratic values and freedoms 
that both of our people hold so dearly. 
As bad actors in the region continue 
their aggressive campaign against de-
mocracy and stability, it is critical 
that we reiterate the importance of our 
relationship with nations like South 
Korea. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this measure, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from my 
home State of New York (Mr. SUOZZI), 
the author of this important resolu-
tion. 
Mr. SUOZZI. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my dear friend, Chairman ENGEL. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H. Res. 809, which, as the chairman 
mentioned, I authored. This resolution 
expresses the importance of our coun-
try’s alliance with the Republic of 
Korea. 
Affirmation of this alliance during 
this time of transition to a new admin-
istration and a new Congress is being 
closely watched throughout the Indo- 
Pacific region, and it is encouraging to 
note that support for this resolution is 
bipartisan and was passed unanimously 
by the House Committee on Foreign 
Affairs. 
A little over 100 years ago, the Re-
public of Korea declared itself sov-
ereign and formed a provisional gov-
ernment. Today, it is one of the most 
vibrant, prosperous, and free societies 
in the world. 
b 1300 
The United States and South Korea 
have a special diplomatic, economic, 
and security relationship, strengthened 
by shared strategic interests and a 
commitment cemented by democratic 
values. 
Our alliance is central to advancing 
democracy, 
free 
markets, 
human 
rights, the rule of law, peace and secu-
rity, and crushing COVID–19, not only 
in the Indo-Pacific region, but through-
out the world. 
But this alliance is not limited to 
international 
cooperation. 
Korean 
Americans contribute so much to the 
fabric of our American communities, 
including the communities in my dis-
trict in New York. Nearly 2 million Ko-
rean Americans live across our coun-
try, and I know from my personal expe-
rience that Korean Americans enrich 
all aspects of our society. 
I am proud to lead this resolution 
through the House of Representatives 
today and call on my colleagues to con-
tinue to strengthen diplomatic, eco-
nomic, and security ties between the 
U.S. and our vital ally, South Korea. 
Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, for decades, our alli-
ance with the Republic of Korea has 
served as a testament to the power of 
freedom and democracy. Our relation-
ship is built upon strong ties and 
shared values, and more than 1.7 mil-
lion Korean Americans call the United 
States home. 
I look forward to many more years of 
close cooperation between our two na-
tions as our alliance evolves and 
strengthens. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this measure, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
again thank Mr. SUOZZI for authoring 
this measure. I know he has had a deep 
interest in this for many, many years. 
I urge all of my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle to support it, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
ENGEL) that the House suspend the 
rules and agree to the resolution, H. 
Res. 809, as amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the resolu-
tion, as amended, was agreed to. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

70th anniversary of the outbreak of the 
Korean War and the transformation of 
the United States-Korea alliance into a 
mutually beneficial, global partner-
ship, as amended.

Jr., representing the United Nations Com-
mand with the Korean People’s Army and 
the Chinese People’s Volunteer Army to ‘‘en-
sure a complete cessation of hostilities and 
of all acts of armed force in Korea until a

November 18, 2020 
Whereas the 70-year transformation of the 
United States-Korea alliance into a mutu-
ally beneficial partnership has recently led 
to important coordination and cooperation 
in confronting global pandemics including 
H1N1 in 2009, and COVID–19 in 2020; 
Whereas the Republic of Korea has made 
significant contributions to the global com-
munity in combating and containing COVID– 
19, including the manufacture and export of 
Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Re-
action (RT–PCR) test kits to the United 
States Government and various States; 
Whereas, on May 8, 2020, the Republic of 
Korea donated 500,000 masks to be distrib-
uted to Korean war veterans throughout the 
United States, including the Navajo Nation, 
in a gesture of gratitude and in commemora-
tion of the 70th anniversary of the outbreak 
of the Korean war; and 
Whereas, on May 10, 2020, the Republic of 
Korea donated 2,000,000 masks to the United 
States to help fill shortages in hospitals 
most impacted by COVID–19: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives— 
(1) underscores the continuing and crucial 
role of the alliance between the United 
States and the Republic of Korea in ensuring 
peace and stability in Asia and the world, in-
cluding by providing security from the 
threat posed by the Democratic People’s Re-
public of Korea and its repeated provo-
cations; 
(2) reaffirms the importance of close co-
operation between the United States and the 
Republic of Korea in the Indo-Pacific, in-
cluding on issues ranging from infrastruc-
ture and development financing to pro-
moting good governance; 
(3) encourages the continued close and con-
tinuing ties between the people and govern-
ments of the two nations, as well as the con-
tributions the near two million Korean- 
Americans have made to both societies; 
(4) commits to continuing and expanding 
United States-Republic of Korea medical and 
scientific and research collaboration, par-
ticularly since cooperation between the two 
countries has saved countless lives during 
the COVID–19 pandemic; 
(5) urges both countries to prioritize ongo-
ing Special Measures Agreement negotia-
tions and to reach mutually agreeable terms; 
and 
(6) recommits the United States to ensur-
ing the relationship between the United 
States and Republic of Korea continues to 
grow and thrive into the foreseeable future. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. ENGEL) and the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. YOHO) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unan-
imous consent that all Members have 5 
legislative days in which to revise and 
extend their remarks and include in 
the RECORD extraneous material on H. 
Res. 1012, as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. 
BERA for authoring this resolution rec-
ognizing the historic alliance between 
the United States and the Republic of 
Korea. 
In the 70 years since the outbreak of 
the Korean War, the U.S.-Korea alli-
ance has grown to become an indispen-
sable partnership for defending and 
promoting peace, prosperity, and sta-
bility in the Indo-Pacific and beyond. 
With a shared commitment to human 
rights and democratic values, our two 
countries have worked hand in hand as 
partners on so much of the challenges 
facing us today: Security, trade, global 
health, and more. 
When the United States faced crip-
pling shortages in essential protective 
gear 
during 
this 
pandemic, 
South 
Korea stepped up to help us in our time 
of need. 
In times of crisis, it is all the more 
important that we work closely with 
our allies and friends. Our security pos-
ture in the Korean Peninsula isn’t just 
beneficial to the Republic of Korea, it 
is a benefit for American security as 
well. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support 
this good measure recognizing our alli-
ance with the Republic of Korea, and I 
urge my colleagues to do the same. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H. Res. 1012, recognizing the 70th an-
niversary of the outbreak of the Ko-
rean War and the transformation of the 
U.S.-Korea alliance into a mutual ben-
eficial, global partnership. 
Since that momentous day, our two 
nations have worked together to pro-
mote and protect democracy and free-
dom in the Indo-Pacific region and 
around the world. 
American and South Koreans alike 
understand the importance of defend-
ing democracy against malign actors 
who seek to undermine it at every 
turn. 
I would like to thank the 5.8 million 
U.S. servicemembers who served during 
the Korean War, including 36,574 who 
paid the ultimate sacrifice in the de-
fense of the Republic of Korea. 
The fight to protect freedom and de-
mocracy will continue for years to 
come, but we are fortunate to have 
partners like the Republic of Korea by 
our side. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this measure, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. BERA), the author of this 
important resolution, the chair of the 
Subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific, 
and Nonproliferation. 
Mr. BERA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to urge support of my resolution, H. 
Res. 1012, which recognizes the trans-
formation of the U.S.-South Korea re-
lationship into a strong and enduring 
partnership that benefits the entire 
world. 
As the proud co-chair of the Korea 
Caucus and the co-chair of the Congres-
sional Study Group on Korea, I know 
how important this relationship is to 
our two countries. 
This spring, I introduced this resolu-
tion because I wanted to acknowledge 
and highlight the shared history and 
ties between our nations. 
It was over 70 years ago that the 
United States rushed to the aid of the 
Republic of Korea after they were at-
tacked by its neighbor to the north. 
The United States, leading the multi-
national coalition of the United Na-
tions Command, successfully defended 
the Republic of Korea. 
But the war devastated South Korea. 
Forty years ago, South Korea was one 
of the poorest countries in the world. 
Today, they are one of the most ad-
vanced. It is a miracle, and it is hard 
work. 
The Republic of Korea became a de-
mocracy in the late 1980s. Today, it is 
one of the most widely respected coun-
tries in Asia and the world. It has been 
incredibly 
successful 
against 
the 
COVID–19 pandemic and has helped the 
United 
States 
in 
our 
own 
battle 
against it. 
President-elect Biden has recognized 
the value of our relationship with 
Korea, and his call to President Moon 
Jae-in was one of the first calls to a 
foreign leader. 
Our ties with the Republic of Korea 
are enduring. They are based on our 
shared people-to-people values, our vi-
brant 
Korean-American 
community, 
American expatriates in South Korea, 
and our economic ties. 
We have shared values and respect 
for democracy and human rights. We 
will work together to confront the 
challenges of this pandemic, as well as 
other challenges, like climate change. 
I thank my colleagues on both sides 
of the aisle who support and sustain 
this alliance, as well as Chairman 
ENGEL and Ranking Member MCCAUL 
and their staff, like Theresa Lou, who 
helped bring this resolution to the 
floor. 
Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to express 
my sincere gratitude for those who 
fought to defend freedom during the 
Korean War. Because of their sacrifice, 
South Koreans can live freely and 
without fear of oppression. 
Through new and unforeseen chal-
lenges, the U.S.-ROK alliance con-
tinues to strengthen and evolve, and 
we look forward to close cooperation 
and friendship in years to come. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this measure, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume for 
the purpose of closing. 
Mr. Speaker, let me say that, as one 
of the few Members of Congress who 
has been to North Korea twice, I think 
that when you do that, you see the pro-
found difference between North Korea 
and South Korea. That is why it is so 
important that the United States con-
tinue strongly its alliance with the Re-
public of Korea, a vital partnership 
that has grown stronger and stronger

over the past 70 years, and I am sure 
will continue for many more to come. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) The stability and territorial unity of 
Libya is critical to the security of the 
United States, Europe, North Africa, and the 
Sahel, as well as maritime routes in the 
southern Mediterranean Sea. 
(2) 
United 
States 
Africa 
Command 
(AFRICOM) identifies containing instability 
in Libya as one of its six main lines of effort 
in Africa and works to support diplomatic ef-
forts to reconstitute the Libyan State and to 
disrupt terrorist organizations that impede 
that process or threaten United States inter-
ests. 
(3) According to the Defense Intelligence 
Agency, the Islamic State in Libya (ISIS- 
Libya) is ‘‘degraded’’. However, Secretary of 
Defense Mark Esper said in November 2019 
that there is a continued need for lethal op-
erations to keep ISIS-Libya in a degraded 
state. 
(4) On April 4, 2019, Khalifa Haftar, the 
commander of the Libyan National Army 
(LNA) ordered forces loyal to him to begin a 
unilateral military operation to take control 
of Tripoli, the capital of Libya and seat of 
the Government of National Accord (GNA), 
an interim body that emerged from previous 
United Nations-backed negotiations which 
the United States Government and the 
United Nations Security Council have recog-
nized since 2015. 
(5) Both the LNA, the GNA, and their asso-
ciated forces have failed to observe their ob-
ligations under international humanitarian 
law, increased the geographic scope of the 
conflict, ignored calls for de-escalation and a 
ceasefire, recruited foreign mercenaries, and 
intensified ground and air campaigns using 
heavy weapons, aircraft, and reportedly 
using armed drones provided by foreign pow-
ers. 
(6) According to then-United Nations Spe-
cial Representative and Head of the United 
Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL), 
Ghassan Salame´, weapons provided by for-
eign powers to the warring parties in viola-
tion of the United Nations arms embargo are 
being sold to or captured by terrorist groups 
active in Libya. 
(7) According to the United Nations, since 
the LNA offensive began in April 2019, the 
conflict in Libya has led to the deaths of 
more than 2,200 people and the displacement 
of more than 150,000 people. 
(8) All sides of the conflict have requi-
sitioned the houses of civilians, targeted 
medical facilities, and inhibited humani-
tarian access to food, health, and other life- 
saving services, worsening humanitarian 
conditions. 
(9) More than 2,200 refugees and migrants 
are detained in detention facilities in Libya 
with serious risks of torture, starvation, sex-
ual abuse, and death. On July 2, 2019, an air-
strike against the Tajura Detention Center 
killed 53 and wounded 130 people trapped in 
the center. The United Nations has called for 
the immediate release, evacuation, and pro-
tection of refugees and migrants detained in 
conflict zones. 
(10) The Department of State’s 2020 Traf-
ficking in Persons Report states with regard 
to Libya, ‘‘Trafficking victims—including 
men, women, and children—are highly vul-
nerable to extreme violence and other 
human rights violations in Libya by govern-
mental and non-state armed groups, includ-
ing: physical, sexual, and verbal assault; ab-
duction for ransom; extortion; arbitrary 
killings; inhumane detention; and child sol-
diering. . .Migrants in Libya are extremely 
vulnerable to sex and labor trafficking [and 
. . .] are vulnerable to exploitation by state 
and non-state actors, including employers 
who refuse to pay laborers’ wages.’’. 
(11) In November 2019, the GNA and the 
Government of Turkey signed a Memo-
randum 
of 
Understanding 
on 
maritime 
boundaries in the Mediterranean Sea. 
(12) According to a July 2020 Department of 
Defense Inspector General report, the Wag-
ner Group, a Russian private military com-
pany, has deployed as many as 2,500 merce-
nary forces, including some Syrian fighters, 
advanced equipment, and advanced capabili-
ties to support the LNA and Russian objec-
tives in North Africa. 
(13) According to a July 2020 Department of 
Defense Inspector General report, ‘‘Turkey’s 
president acknowledged that his country 
sent many Syrian militants to Libya to sup-
port the Government of National Accord 
(GNA). . ..USAFRICOM estimated that 3,500 
Syrian mercenaries were in Libya supporting 
the GNA as of the end of March. Citing press 
reports, USAFRICOM stated that an addi-
tional 300 Turkish-supported ‘Syrian opposi-
tion’ fighters arrived in Libya in early 
April.’’. 
(14) In January 2020, LNA-aligned forces 
shut down oil production in eastern Libya, 
which according to the United Nations 
threatens devastating consequences for the 
Libyan people and for the country’s eco-
nomic and financial situation. 
(15) On January 19, 2020, at a peace con-
ference in Berlin, representatives of the Gov-
ernments of Algeria, China, Egypt, France, 
Germany, Italy, Russia, Turkey, the Repub-
lic of Congo, the United Arab Emirates, the 
United Kingdom, and the United States, as 
well as regional and multilateral organiza-
tions, agreed to refrain from interference in 
Libya’s internal affairs, abide by the United 
Nations arms embargo, and advance a 55- 
point communique to resolve the conflict in 
Libya. 
(16) On January 30, 2020, then-United Na-
tions Special Representative Salame´
as-
serted, ‘‘the warring parties have continued 
to receive advanced equipment, fighters, and 
advisors from foreign states, in violation of 
the UN arms embargo and pledges made by 
representatives of these countries in Berlin’’. 
(17) On February 12, 2020, the United States 
Assistant Secretary of State for Near East-
ern Affairs testified before the Senate For-
eign Relations Committee, ‘‘The task of 
bringing the Libyans back to the negotiating 
table has been complicated by the involve-
ment of external actors. Libya is not the 
place for Russian mercenaries, or fighters 
from Syria, Chad, and Sudan. It is not the 
place for the Emiratis, Russians, or Turks to 
be fighting battles on the ground through 
intermediaries they sponsor or support with 
sophisticated and deadly equipment in pur-
suit of their own agendas.’’. 
(18) On February 13, 2020, the United Na-
tions Security Council adopted Resolution 
2510, which endorses the Conclusions of the 
International Conference on Libya held in 
Berlin, affirms the need for a lasting 
ceasefire, demands full compliance by all

FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS AND AC-

TITLE IV—DETERMINATION OF 
BUDGETARY EFFECTS 
SEC. 401. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EF-
FECTS. 
The budgetary effects of this Act, for the 
purpose of complying with the Statutory 
Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be deter-
mined by reference to the latest statement 
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in 
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. ENGEL) and the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. YOHO) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unan-
imous consent that all Members have 5 
legislative days in which to revise and 
extend their remarks and include ex-
traneous material on H.R. 4644. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of the Libya Stabilization Act, an im-
portant piece of legislation introduced 
by the chairman and the ranking mem-
ber of the Middle East and North Afri-
ca Subcommittee, Mr. DEUTCH, along 
with Ranking Member WILSON. 
This bill responds to years of insta-
bility and violence in Libya, which has 
given Russia a new foothold in North 
Africa and contributed to the growth of 
violent extremist groups. 
Though there is welcome news of an 
emerging ceasefire in Libya, facilitated 
by the United Nations, sporadic vio-
lence continues and dangerous militia 
groups remain active throughout the 
country. 
The Libya Stabilization Act address-
es these threats by sanctioning outside 
actors who fuel the conflict or per-
petrate human rights abuses. The bill 
also directs additional U.S. support to 
humanitarian relief and assistance ef-
forts to help strengthen democratic 
governance; build a better, peaceful fu-
ture for Libya; and ensure the security 
of the U.S. and our allies. 
It is in our interest to help prevent 
Libya from spiraling even further into 
lawlessness. A vacuum of leadership in 
Tripoli gives way to extremism, which 
poses threats to the United States, our 
allies, and partners. 
I thank Mr. DEUTCH and Mr. WILSON 
for their work on this measure, and I 
urge my colleagues to support it. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time.

H5891 
November 18, 2020 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON FINANCIAL SERVICES, 
Washington, DC, November 13, 2020. 
Hon. ELIOT ENGEL, 
Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: I am writing con-
cerning H.R. 4644, the Libya Stabilization 
Act. In order to permit H.R. 4644 to proceed 
expeditiously to the House Floor, I agree to 
forgo formal consideration of the bill. 
The Committee on Financial Services 
takes this action to forego formal consider-
ation of H.R. 4644 in light of the mutually 
agreed changes to provisions within the ju-
risdiction of the Committee on Financial 
Services. We are also doing so based on our 
mutual understanding that, by foregoing for-
mal consideration of H.R. 4644 at this time, 
we do not waive any jurisdiction over the 
subject matter contained in this or similar 
legislation, and that our Committee will be 
appropriately consulted and involved as this 
or similar legislation moves forward with re-
gard to any matters in the Committee’s ju-
risdiction. The Committee also reserves the 
right to seek appointment of an appropriate 
number of conferees to any House-Senate 
conference involving this or similar legisla-
tion that involves the Committee’s jurisdic-
tion and request your support for any such 
request. 
Finally, I would appreciate your response 
to this letter confirming this understanding, 
and I would ask that a copy of our exchange 
of letters on this matter be included in the 
Congressional Record during Floor consider-
ation of H.R. 4644. 
Sincerely, 
MAXINE WATERS, 
Chairwoman. 
Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
4644, the Libya Stabilization Act. De-
spite a U.N. arms embargo, foreign ac-
tors are continuing to support both 
sides of the conflict. 
For example, Russia is supporting 
General 
Haftar’s 
Libyan 
National 
Army. AFRICOM publishes pictures of 
advanced Russian aircraft in Libya. 
AFRICOM also estimates that Russia 
is supporting thousands of mercenaries 
from the Wagner Group and from Syria 
to fight for Haftar. Turkey has brought 
in more than 5,000 Syrian mercenaries 
to support the Government of National 
Accord. 
Flooding Libya with foreign merce-
naries and heavy weaponry could de-
stabilize the country and region for 
generations. 
We need to incentivize all parties to 
embrace a political track to establish 
stable governance in Libya and end the 
violence. That is the purpose of this 
legislation before us today. 
I am pleased that since our com-
mittee first considered this bill over 
the summer, the U.N. has managed to 
broker a ceasefire. The parties are 
using this opportunity to continue ne-
gotiations regarding the future of 
Libya. 
Unfortunately, as we have seen many 
times in this conflict, there is still the 
possibility that spoilers could upend 
this peace process. 
That is why, under this legislation, if 
individuals are threatening the peace, 
security, and stability of Libya, they 
will be subject to sanctions. But the 
bill clearly states that if there is a 
ceasefire in place, as there is at this 
time, at this very moment, then the 
sanctions do not apply. 
We are using our leverage to support 
the emerging political process and a 
peaceful future for the people of Libya. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
b 1315 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, it is now 
my pleasure to yield 21⁄2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Florida (Mr. DEUTCH), 
the author of this important bill and 
the chair of the Subcommittee on the 
Middle East, North Africa, and Inter-
national Terrorism. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I will 
speak to this bill in just a couple of 
seconds, but I want to pause, if I may, 
just to reflect on the Committee on 
Foreign Affairs bills that are on the 
floor today and what they say about 
the chairman of our committee, Mr. 
ENGEL. 
Mr. ENGEL, for more than three dec-
ades in the United States House of Rep-
resentatives, has led with American 
values 
representing 
human 
rights, 
standing with our allies, and standing 
up against autocrats all around the 
world. And since I don’t know, because 
of the pandemic, how much floor time 
we will have in the coming days and 
weeks, I wanted to take this moment 
to express on behalf of not only myself 
but I know so so many of his colleagues 
and friends around the country our 
deep appreciation for his leadership for 
all these years. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased today that 
we are considering the Libya Stabiliza-
tion Act, a bipartisan bill that I intro-
duced with my colleague, Middle East 
Subcommittee Ranking Member JOE 
WILSON. 
As Mr. YOHO said, since we advanced 
this legislation out of committee in 
July, Libya experienced a cease-fire 
and a burst of diplomacy that I hope 
will bring increased security and, even-
tually, peace to all Libyans. 
The most recent round of U.N.-led 
talks yielded an agreement to hold 
‘‘free and fair, inclusive and credible’’ 
Presidential and parliamentary elec-
tions next year. 
These 
are 
important 
accomplish-
ments, and credit should be given to 
the Libyan representatives to the nego-
tiations, as well as the U.N., the U.S. 
Embassy in Libya, and both the Tuni-
sian and Egyptian Governments for 
hosting recent political and military 
discussions. 
However, hard work and difficult 
compromises lie ahead. Recent talks 
failed to yield a transitional govern-
mental administration. Public services 
like electricity continue to be limited 
or nonexistent. 
Moreover, progress on securing with-
drawal of weapons, foreign forces, and 
mercenaries from Libya remains elu-
sive. And we should not forget that 
previous diplomatic efforts in Libya re-
peatedly failed. 
That is why it is so important that 
we pass this bill today. It calls for a 
more active U.S. role in diplomacy, 
provides humanitarian assistance, and 
supports future elections, measures 
that will reinforce negotiations. 
It also sanctions those who deploy 
mercenaries, support militias, violate 
the U.N. arms embargo, and commit 
human rights violations in Libya. The 
bill’s punitive measures take effect if 
the cease-fire collapses, which will 
incentivize the warring parties to re-
main at the negotiating table rather 
than return to the battlefield. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield an 
additional 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Florida (Mr. DEUTCH). 
Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, the bill 
that we will pass today demonstrates 
this Congress’ interest in deescalating 
the conflict and that we support work-
ing with the U.N., our European allies, 
regional states, and Libyans to end the 
war and to help rebuild Libya. 
Again, Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. WIL-
SON for his leadership on this issue. I 
also thank both the majority and mi-
nority staffs of the committee, and spe-
cial thanks to Ryan Doherty of my 
staff for his tireless efforts in bringing 
this bill to this floor today. 
Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I 
want to thank the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. DEUTCH) and the gen-
tleman from South Carolina (Mr. WIL-
SON) for their leadership in introducing 
this bill, which I support. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to 
support this legislation, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
once again thank Mr. DEUTCH and Mr. 
WILSON for their hard work in author-
izing this measure. 
I want to thank Mr. DEUTCH for his 
kind words. We have worked very 
closely together through the years on 
the Foreign Affairs Committee. He has 
been one of the best members—always 
there, always fighting, always prin-
cipled—and I thank him for the nice, 
kind words he said about me. 
We all say kind things about him be-
cause he is such an important member 
of the House Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee, and I have enjoyed serving with 
him all these years. So I thank the 
gentleman from Florida (Mr. DEUTCH). 
Mr. Speaker, let me say, I urge all 
Members to join me in supporting this 
legislation, again, Mr. DEUTCH’s and 
Mr. WILSON’s hard work in authoring 
this measure. I urge all colleagues to 
support this, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
ENGEL) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4644, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed.

H5892 
November 18, 2020 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
AFFIRMING NATURE AND IMPOR-
TANCE OF UNITED STATES-IRAQ 
BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and agree to the reso-
lution (H. Res. 1062) affirming the na-
ture and importance of the United 
States-Iraq bilateral relationship, in-
cluding security and economic compo-
nents of the relationship, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the resolu-
tion. 
The text of the resolution is as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 1062 
Whereas the United States remains com-
mitted to supporting a sovereign and demo-
cratic Iraq at peace with its neighbors and 
safe for its citizens, regardless of their reli-
gion, sect, or ethnicity; 
Whereas in 2014, forces of the Islamic State 
(commonly known as ‘‘IS’’ and also known 
as ‘‘ISIS’’ or ‘‘ISIL’’) seized significant terri-
tory in Iraq, leading Iraq’s Prime Minister to 
request international military intervention; 
Whereas the United States began military 
intervention against the Islamic State in 
Iraq in 2014, working with international coa-
lition partners and Iraqi security forces to 
combat the Islamic State and to retake Iraqi 
territory from Islamic State fighters; 
Whereas the Islamic State ruled areas it 
controlled with terror and brutal violence, 
including through heinous acts such as mass 
executions, public beheadings, desecration of 
holy sites, sexual enslavement and rape, and 
abuse and torture of minors; 
Whereas the Government of Iraq declared 
military victory against the Islamic State in 
December 2017, but insurgent attacks by re-
maining terrorist fighters have continued 
and threaten peace and stability in some 
areas of Iraq; 
Whereas an estimated 6 million Iraqis have 
been rendered internally displaced since 2014, 
of whom 1.4 million remain internally dis-
placed; 
Whereas members of religious and ethnic 
minority groups, including Iraqi Christian 
communities and Yezidis, faced particular 
brutality under the Islamic State and often 
lacked the resources and capacity for protec-
tion; 
Whereas the Islamic State’s destructive 
rule and ensuing military campaign left 
large areas of key population centers un-
inhabitable, including Anbar, Salah al-Din, 
and Ninewa governorates, where efforts at 
resettlement, reconstruction, service deliv-
ery, governance, and security remain chal-
lenging; 
Whereas the United Nations Office for the 
Coordination 
of 
Humanitarian 
Affairs 
(UNOCHA) 2020 humanitarian needs assess-
ment previously anticipated that as many as 
4.1 million Iraqis will need some form of hu-
manitarian assistance in 2020, and humani-
tarian needs are likely to be further exacer-
bated by socio-economic disruptions attrib-
utable to the COVID-19 pandemic; 
Whereas the United States was the top 
donor to the 2018 and 2019 United Nations 
Iraq Humanitarian Response Plans and has 
contributed nearly $2.75 billion to humani-
tarian relief efforts in Iraq since 2014, includ-
ing more than $750 million in humanitarian 
support since fiscal year 2018; 
Whereas in July 2017, the United Nations 
Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian 
Affairs (UNOCHA) reported that ‘‘after dec-
ades of war, the sheer volume of explosive 
devices renders Iraq one of the most heavily 
contaminated countries in the world’’; 
Whereas multiple nongovernmental human 
rights organizations and media investiga-
tions have reported that areas still suffering 
from the lack of reconstruction, service de-
livery, governance, and security are acutely 
susceptible to re-radicalization by Islamic 
State underground cells or follow-on ele-
ments; 
Whereas human rights organizations have 
reported that thousands of displaced Iraqis, 
including children, are unable to obtain or 
replace civil documentation due to displace-
ment caused by Islamic State; 
Whereas some paramilitary forces, includ-
ing some elements of the ‘‘Popular Mobiliza-
tion Units’’ or ‘‘PMUs’’ that mobilized to 
fight Islamic State terrorists have yet to be 
fully integrated into national security insti-
tutions and threaten civilian populations in 
some areas, including vulnerable minority 
groups; 
Whereas in late 2019, some Iraqi security 
force units, including non-state militias, re-
sponded violently to peaceful protests result-
ing in the deaths of more than 550 Iraqi civil-
ians and many more injured; 
Whereas in 2019 and 2020, Iranian aligned 
militias, some of whom operate Iraqi PMUs 
conducted 
numerous 
attacks 
on 
United 
States and coalition forces in Iraq as well as 
Iraqi military facilities and Iraqi nationals, 
including a December 2019 attack that killed 
a United States citizen contractor and 
wounded others, and a March 2020, attack 
that killed a United States servicemember, a 
United States contractor, a British soldier, 
and injured at least a dozen other troops; 
Whereas Iranian aligned militias and some 
PMUs were reportedly involved in the De-
cember 31, 2019, to January 1, 2020, siege on 
the United States Embassy in Baghdad, in 
which attackers set fire to structures and 
damaged property; 
Whereas in July 2019 the Combined Joint 
Task 
Force-Operation 
Inherent 
Resolve 
(CJTF–OIR) informed the Department of De-
fense and Department of State Inspector 
General that the Islamic State in Iraq con-
tinues to recruit from isolated rural areas 
‘‘exploiting perceived weaknesses and fail-
ures of the Iraqi government, particularly in 
Sunni areas where the population feels ne-
glected’’; 
Whereas a July 2019 Department of Defense 
and Department of State Lead Inspector 
General (LIG) Report to Congress on Oper-
ation Inherent Resolve stated the ‘‘Depart-
ment of State and USAID reported that the 
greatest obstacles preventing IDPs from re-
turning . . . are lack of security and eco-
nomic opportunity, and damage to housing’’ 
as well as a lack of ‘‘legal assistance to re-
cover or renew identification documents’’; 
Whereas in March 2020 Iraq confirmed its 
first case of COVID-19, which soon spread 
throughout the country, straining Iraq’s al-
ready struggling healthcare system, and in-
fecting 64,000 Iraqis and killing 2,685 Iraqis, 
including 592 Iraqi doctors, as of June 2020; 
and 
Whereas the LIG reported in May 2020 that 
‘‘the emergence of COVID-19 in Iraq has fur-
ther restricted humanitarian access and pre-
sented a significant risk to internally dis-
placed person (IDP) and refugee camps 
across the country’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives— 
(1) supports a sovereign and democratic 
Iraq at peace with its neighbors and safe for 
its citizens, regardless of religion, sect, or 
ethnicity; 
(2) calls on the Administration to provide 
continued support for Iraqi efforts to ensure 
stability and security for a democratic Iraq; 
(3) calls on the Government of Iraq to take 
all appropriate action to protect United 
States 
diplomats 
and 
United 
States 
servicemembers, including by holding ac-
countable those involved in the December 31, 
2019, through January 1, 2020, attack on the 
United States Embassy; 
(4) supports robust exercise by Iraqis of the 
rights to free speech and assembly as guar-
anteed to them by the Constitution of Iraq; 
(5) calls on the Government of Iraq to hold 
accountable all those responsible for vio-
lence against peaceful protestors, including 
members of Iraqi security forces as applica-
ble; 
(6) calls on all countries to continue up-
holding the principle of non-refoulement for 
refugees subject to violence, persecution, or 
death if forcibly returned to Iraq, including 
for reasons of religious persecution, and to 
assist internally displaced Iraqis to safely 
and voluntarily return to their homes; 
(7) encourages the United States to con-
tinue to work with bilateral and multilateral 
partners and international nongovernmental 
organizations on the stabilization of Iraq; 
(8) calls on the Administration to continue 
assisting religious and ethnic minority com-
munities targeted by the Islamic State for 
genocide; 
(9) calls on the Administration to continue 
to work with the Government of Iraq to 
eliminate child labor and forced labor in 
Iraq; 
(10) supports expanded bilateral trade and 
investment between the United States and 
Iraq; 
(11) supports development of an Iraqi pri-

Iraq grapples with such challenges, the 
United States must show up to dem-
onstrate leadership and friendship. 
This bipartisan resolution expresses 
support for sovereign, democratic Iraq 
and strong relations between our two 
nations, while also highlighting the 
need to address humanitarian chal-
lenges facing Iraq, such as internal dis-
placement, violence against minority 
religious and ethnic groups, and recov-
ery of communities impacted by the 
counter-ISIS fight. 
H. Res. 1062 also calls on Iraq to take 
all necessary steps to protect United 
States diplomats and servicemembers. 
When diplomats are able to do their job 
safely, investment in a growing econ-
omy can follow, benefiting the Iraqi 
people and their livelihoods. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman 
for putting forth this resolution, and I 
reserve the balance of my time.

DEAR CHAIRMAN NEAL: I am writing to you 
concerning H.Res. 1062, Affirming the nature 
and importance of the United States-Iraq bi-
lateral relationship, including security and 
economic components of the relationship. I 
appreciate your willingness to work coopera-

further acknowledge that the inaction of 
your Committee with respect to the bill does 
not waive any future jurisdictional claim 
over the matters contained in the bill that 
fall within your jurisdiction. I will also sup-
port the appointment of Committee on Ways

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON WAYS AND MEANS, 
Washington, DC, November 17, 2020. 
Hon. ELIOT L. ENGEL, 
Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN ENGEL: In recognition of 
the desire to expedite consideration of H. 
Res. 1062, Affirming the nature and impor-
tance of the United States-Iraq bilateral re-
lationship, including security and economic 
components of the relationship, the Com-
mittee on Ways and Means agrees to waive 
formal consideration of the bill as to provi-
sions that fall within the rule X jurisdiction 
of the Committee on Ways and Means. 
The Committee on Ways and Means takes 
this action with the mutual understanding 
that we do not waive any jurisdiction over 
the subject matter contained in this or simi-
lar legislation, and the Committee will be 
appropriately consulted and involved as the 
bill or similar legislation moves forward so 
that we may address any remaining issues 
within our jurisdiction. The Committee also 
reserves the right to seek appointment of an 
appropriate number of conferees to any 
House-Senate conference involving this or 
similar legislation. 
Finally, I would appreciate your response 
to this letter confirming this understanding 
and would ask that a copy of our exchange of 
letter on this matter be included in the Con-
gressional Record during floor consideration 
of H. Res. 1062. 
Sincerely, 
RICHARD E. NEAL, 
Chairman. 
Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. 
Res. 1062, reaffirming the U.S.-Iraq bi-
lateral relationship. 
In recent years, the United States 
and Iraq worked together to defeat the 
caliphate and free the Iraqi people 
from ISIS’ tyrannical rule. 
The American people are committed 
to supporting a sovereign and demo-
cratic Iraq. We have provided billions 
of dollars in foreign assistance to help 
Iraqis recover from the devastating im-
pact that ISIS has had on their lives. 
This year, the United States and Iraq 
held a strategic dialogue to further our 
bilateral relationship and discuss how 
we can continue to work together for 
our shared benefit. 
With this resolution, the House is re-
affirming our commitment to helping 
the Iraqi people and calling on the 
Iraqi Government to fulfill its commit-
ments too. 
The Iraqi Government needs to pro-
tect the United States’ diplomats and 
servicemembers and hold accountable 
those involved in attacks against our 
Embassy, such as earlier this year. 
The Government of Iraq also needs to 
hold accountable those responsible for 
violence against peaceful protesters. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank 
Chairman 
ENGEL for his work on this bipartisan 
resolution, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to 
thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
ALLRED) and the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania 
(Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER) 
for 
their leadership in introducing this bi-
partisan resolution, which I support. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to 
support this legislation, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I urge all 
Members to join me today in sup-
porting this important resolution, H. 
Res. 1062, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
ENGEL) that the House suspend the 
rules and agree to the resolution, H. 
Res. 1062, as amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the resolu-
tion, as amended, was agreed to. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. ENGEL) and the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. YOHO) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unan-
imous consent that all Members may 
have 5 legislative days within which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 7990, 
as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, far too many Americans 
have 
witnessed 
firsthand 
the 
dev-
astating effects of drug abuse. Accord-
ing to the Centers for Disease Control, 
our country saw the largest increase in 
overdose deaths from 2018 to 2019. That 
is why this bill comes before us at a 
critical time, and I thank the author, 
Mr. TRONE, for his leadership and hard 
work on this bill and on the entire sub-
ject. 
Fentanyl is one of the most dan-
gerous synthetic opioids contributing 
to the opioid crisis, and since it is 
largely manufactured outside of the 
United States, it is critical that we en-
gage closely with our international 
partners to combat this scourge. 
The FENTANYL Results Act requires 
the State Department to update its ap-
proach to illegal synthetic drugs. This 
bill opens strong channels of commu-
nications with foreign drug enforce-
ment agencies, trains countries on how 
to combat synthetic drug production, 
and promotes exchange programs for 
renowned experts who can share their 
findings around the world. 
With such an imposing task ahead of 
us, international cooperation is crit-
ical. It is not enough to tackle this 
issue domestically; we also must work 
together with our partners around the 
world to stop the transit of these illicit 
substances. 
I was pleased that the House Foreign 
Affairs Committee passed this bill 
unanimously, and I urge my colleagues 
to join me in supporting its passage in 
the House today. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of the FENTANYL Results Act. 
The opioid crisis continues to have a 
devastating effect on Americans across 
this great Nation. It is imperative we 
use all the tools at our disposal to fully 
address this problem. 
The FENTANYL Results Act ensures 
that we leverage the role of the State 
Department in this whole-of-govern-
ment effort. Specifically, this bill re-
quires 
the 
Secretary 
of 
State

prioritize efforts to combat inter-
national trafficking in synthetic drugs 
and new psychoactive substances. 
A key provision of this bill author-
izes the Secretary to provide assistance 
to foreign law enforcement agencies, 
including those in drug-transit coun-
tries, to stem the illicit flow of 
fentanyl and other synthetic drugs 
across our borders. 
This bill requires the Secretary to 
foster greater partnerships with inter-
national drug agencies and increase 
data collection to keep pace with 
emerging synthetic drug use that could 
be exploited by the international traf-
ficking networks. 
It also addresses the demand side of 
this problem by authorizing an action 
change program to provide educational 
and professional development on de-
mand reduction matters. 
This bill is an important measure to 
continue our aggressive fight against 
this deadly fentanyl epidemic, and I 
urge my colleagues to support this leg-
islation. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
b 1330 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 41⁄2 
minutes to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. TRONE), the author of this 
important bill, and a valued member of 
the Foreign Affairs Committee. 
Mr. TRONE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to urge my colleagues to support 
my bill, the FENTANYL Results Act, 
that will help increase global coopera-
tion in the fight against synthetic drug 
trafficking. 
My nephew, Ian Trone, died 4 years 
ago of a fentanyl overdose at the age of 
24, and since his passing, we have seen 
a dramatic and alarming increase in 
fentanyl and other synthetic opioid 
deaths across our country. 
In 2019, there were nearly 71,000 over-
dose deaths in the United States, the 
highest number ever recorded. Most 
disturbingly, this number reversed the 
promising decrease in deaths we saw in 
2018. 
Why did we see a spike last year? Be-
cause fentanyl is showing up in more 
and more parts of the United States. 
Mixed in with heroin, meth, and co-
caine, fentanyl is causing more acci-
dental overdoses and more deaths. 
We know that fentanyl is 50 to 100 
times stronger than morphine. 
Some synthetics, like carfentanil, 
are even deadlier, some 10,000 times 
stronger than morphine. 
In 2018, two-thirds of all opioid-re-
lated 
deaths 
involved 
synthetic 
opioids. 
This rise in opioid deaths is espe-
cially alarming because of the signifi-
cant impact we know the COVID pan-
demic has had on the opioid epidemic. 
In Maryland, fentanyl was involved 
in 93 percent of all opioid-related 
deaths for the first 6 months of 2020, 
and fentanyl-involved deaths were up 
12 percent in the second quarter com-
pared to the same time last year. 
We need to act now if we are going to 
put an end to these senseless deaths. 
We cannot do it alone. 
The FENTANYL Results Act in-
structs the Secretary of State to: 
Support increased data collection by 
the U.S. and other countries on drug 
use and make sure we share that data, 
Increase 
consultation 
with 
inter-
national drug agencies and foreign reg-
ulatory agencies, 
Implement technical assistance pro-
grams to build partner capacity in fo-
rensic detection capabilities, 
And run international exchange pro-
grams among demand reduction ex-
perts and scientists. 
The U.S. can’t fight its way out of 
this alone. We need to work together 
on demand reduction at home, and we 
are doing that with stronger preven-
tion, treatment, and recovery pro-
grams. 
But we need to cooperate with inter-
national partners to stem the flow of 
synthetic 
opioids 
into 
the 
United 
States. 
This means working with them to de-
tect fentanyl and its precursors before 
these drugs leave the borders. 
This means establishing best prac-
tices to reduce demand globally, so we 
have less of a market for these illicit 
substances. 
This means recognizing that greater 
cooperation serves us all. It is in no 
country’s interest to fuel the opioid 
epidemic. 
I thank Ranking Member MCCAUL for 
coleading this bipartisan bill with me. 
Ranking Member MCCAUL has been a 
champion on this bipartisan issue long 
before I came to Congress, and I look 
forward to continuing our relationship. 
I also thank Chairman ENGEL
for 
helping move the bill through the For-
eign Affairs Committee and making 
sure we take every possible step to end 
the flow of fentanyl and other syn-
thetic drugs in the United States. We 
will miss your leadership here in Con-
gress next year, and we know your 
service has a long way to go in the fu-
ture. 
We need to tackle the opioid epi-
demic from every angle, and that in-
cludes working with our international 
partners to curb drug trafficking and 
save lives. This bill helps us do this. I 
urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. 
Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
In closing, I want to thank Rep-
resentative TRONE for his work on this 
issue. 
We all know someone, unfortunately, 
who has suffered from addiction. We 
must remain committed to defeating 
substance abuse and saving American 
lives. I urge my colleagues to support 
this bill. 
I, too, would like to thank Chairman 
ENGEL for his years of dedication and 
service to the State of New York and 
to this Nation and his friendship. It has 
been an honor to work with you, sir. It 
has been an honor to know you, and I 
wish the best of life to you and Pat in 
the future. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the balance of my time. 
I thank the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. YOHO) for his kind words. I really 
appreciate it. 
I, again, thank Mr. TRONE for being a 
great champion on this issue and for 
his kind words. 
This is the kind of cooperation we 
have on the Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee, and I really have been honored 
to preside over it and to have been on 
the committee for so many years. 
These are important issues that affect 
real people. The Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee has always been at the forefront 
of these issues because of the gentle-
men and women that you just heard. 
We call ourselves the most bipartisan 
committee, and I think it is true. 
I, again, thank Mr. TRONE for being a 
great champion on this issue, and, Mr. 
YOHO, thank you. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all our colleagues 
to support this bill, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
ENGEL) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 7990, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
DESERT LOCUST CONTROL ACT 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 7276) to establish an interagency 
working group to develop a comprehen-
sive, strategic plan to eradicate locust 
outbreaks in the East Africa region 
and address future outbreaks in order 
to avert mass scale food insecurity and 
potential political destabilization, and 
for other purposes, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 7276 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Desert Lo-
cust Control Act’’. 
SEC. 2. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
It is the policy of the United States to 
prioritize efforts to control the ongoing 
desert locust outbreak in East Africa and 
other affected regions, mitigate the impacts 
on food security, economic productivity, and 
political stability, improve interagency co-
ordination to prevent future outbreaks, and 
promote resilience in affected countries. 
SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) The United States Agency for Inter-
national Development reports that countries 
in East Africa are currently suffering the 
worst desert locust outbreak in decades, 
which will devour crops and pasture and de-
stroy local livelihoods across the region.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5896 
November 18, 2020 
(2) As of June 2020, there were more than 26 
million people experiencing acute food inse-
curity in Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South 
Sudan, 
Tanzania, 
Uganda, 
Sudan, 
and 
Djibouti, and these numbers are projected to 
increase if the desert locust outbreak is not 
controlled. 
(3) As the desert locust outbreak con-
tinues, there may be insufficient resources 
to continue to conduct aerial spraying and 
without such resources the current outbreak 
could develop into a plague by the end of 
2020. 
(4) The desert locust outbreak in East Afri-
ca, particularly in Kenya, Ethiopia, and So-
malia, is negatively impacting food security, 
local livelihoods and economic productivity, 
and may threaten political stability in the 
region. 
(5) Proactive investments now to control 
the desert locust outbreak could reduce the 
need for a much larger United States human-
itarian response effort later, as well as sup-
port economic and political stability and 
build resilience in affected countries. 
(6) In order to optimize the United States 
response to the desert locust outbreak, an 
interagency working group should be estab-
lished to develop and implement a com-
prehensive, strategic plan to control the 
desert locust outbreak in East Africa and 
other affected regions, mitigate impacts on 
food security, economic productivity, and 
political stability and prevent future out-
breaks. 
SEC. 4. INTERAGENCY WORKING GROUP. 
(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—The President shall 
establish an interagency working group to 
coordinate the United States response to the 
ongoing desert locust outbreak in East Afri-
ca and other affected regions, including the 
development of a comprehensive, strategic

impacts on food security, economic produc-
tivity, and political stability, and prevent 
future outbreaks. 
(b) MEMBERSHIP.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—The interagency working 
group shall be composed of the following: 
(A) Two representatives from the United 
States Agency for International Develop-
ment.

outbreak in East Africa and other affected 
regions, including its impact on food secu-
rity, economic productivity, and political 
stability in affected countries; 
(2) assess the impacts of restrictions relat-
ing to the coronavirus disease 2019 (com-
monly referred to as ‘‘COVID-19’’) pandemic; 
(3) monitor the effectiveness of ongoing as-
sistance efforts to control the desert locust 
outbreak and mitigate its impacts and iden-
tify gaps and opportunities for additional 
support to such programs; 
(4) review the effectiveness of regional and 
multilateral efforts to control the desert lo-
cust outbreak and the coordination among 
relevant United States Government agen-
cies, 
regional 
governments, 
and 
inter-
national organizations, including the World 
Food Programme and the United Nations 
Food and Agriculture Organization; and 
(5) not later than 90 days after the estab-
lishment of the interagency working group 
under subsection (a), develop and submit to 
the President and the appropriate congres-
sional committees a comprehensive, stra-
tegic plan to control the desert locust out-
break, including a description of efforts to— 
(A) improve coordination among relevant 
United States Government agencies, re-
gional governments, and international orga-
nizations, including the World Food Pro-
gramme and the United Nations Food and 
Agriculture Organization; 
(B) ensure delivery of necessary assets con-
trol the desert locust outbreak and humani-
tarian and development assistance to address 
and mitigate impacts to food security, eco-
nomic productivity, and political stability; 
and 
(C) to the extent practicable, prevent and 
mitigate future desert locust and other, 
similar destructive insect outbreaks (such as 
Fall Armyworm) in Africa and other parts of 
the world, which require a humanitarian re-
sponse. 
(d) INTERAGENCY
WORKING
GROUP
SUP-
PORT.—The interagency working group shall 
continue to meet not less than semi-annu-
ally to facilitate implementation of the com-
prehensive, strategic plan required by sub-
section (c)(5). 
(e) SUNSET.—This section shall terminate 
on the date that is 2 years after the date of

locust outbreak in East Africa, whichever 
occurs earlier. 
(f) APPROPRIATE
CONGRESSIONAL
COMMIT-
TEES

(1) the Committee on Foreign Affairs and 
the Committee on Appropriations of the 
House of Representatives; and 
(2) the Committee on Foreign Relations 
and the Committee on Appropriations of the 
Senate. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. ENGEL) and the gen-
tleman from New Jersey (Mr. SMITH) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unan-
imous consent that all Members have 5 
legislative days in which to revise and 
extend their remarks and include ex-
traneous material on H.R. 7276. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the 
Desert Locust Control Act, and I thank 
Mr. SMITH for bringing forward this 
very important legislation. 
In late 2019, swarms of locusts en-
tered the Horn of Africa from the Gulf 
of Aden, multiplying and spreading 
throughout the region. 
Locusts are highly mobile and can 
consume vast amounts of vegetation in 
a short period of time. Even a small 
swarm can consume crops that would 
feed up to 35,000 people in day. They 
have devastated large swaths of farm-
land through east Africa, including 
Kenya, Somalia, and Ethiopia and 
across the Red Sea in Yemen. 
Food security is already hanging by a 
thread in these regions, and efforts to 
control the locusts have been hindered 
by the COVID–19 pandemic, lack of re-
liable data, and the geographical reach 
of the swarm across multiple countries. 
The Desert Locust Control Act would 
step up coordination of efforts to 
evaluate and respond to the locust out-
break across the United States Govern-
ment, bringing in the support of the 
U.S. mission to the Food and Agricul-
tural Organization, USAID, and others 
to effectively respond to the outbreak. 
We have already seen the ripple ef-
fects of the coronavirus pandemic on 
poverty, food insecurity, health, and 
education. We must ensure that we do 
not let this locust plague compound 
those challenges. 
I, again, thank Mr. SMITH for his 
leadership in authoring this measure. 
I urge Members on both sides of the 
aisle to support this bill, and, Mr. 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
I will begin by thanking our distin-
guished chairman, ELIOT ENGEL, for his 
extraordinary leadership as chairman 
of the House Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee for all these years. He is a good 
friend. We have worked on so many 
issues together. I thank him again for 
his leadership. It has been extraor-
dinary. Your bipartisanship has been 
an example to us all, so I thank you for 
that, Eliot, and I really mean that 
deeply. 
I also thank my good friend and col-
league from Texas, the ranking mem-
ber, MICHAEL MCCAUL, for his support 
of this legislation and other important 
initiatives. 
Also, Eliot, thank you again. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 7276, the Desert Locust Control 
Act, which I introduced along with my 
good friend and colleague, KAREN BASS. 
She is chairwoman, as you know, of the 
Africa, Global Health, Global Human 
Rights and International Organizations 
Subcommittee. I am the ranking mem-
ber. In previous times I was the chair-
man, and she was my ranking member, 
and we have worked very closely to-
gether on all issues dealing with the 
health and well-being of people around 
the world through the global health 
portion of our portfolio, but also, with 
a very particular emphasis on Africa. 
This bipartisan bill would create an 
interagency task force that would ad-
dress the crisis of increasingly biblical 
proportions caused by swarms of desert 
locusts, which have been compounded 
by the COVID crisis, which our country 
and so many other nations are dealing 
with. 
Indeed, as serious as COVID has been, 
and it has been serious, as we all know, 
the unfortunate fact is that there are 
many other threats to the welfare and

November 18, 2020 
well-being of so many people in the de-
veloping world, including Sub-Saharan 
Africa, where the likelihood of food in-
security looms larger thanks to the 
pandemic. 
Just how bad is it? 
Swarms of hundreds of millions of lo-
custs darken the sky, descend upon an 
area, stripping it entirely of its vegeta-
tion. Crops are just decimated in a 
matter of minutes and hours. 
Unfortunately, due in part to this 
bad timing with a pandemic, we are 
witnessing the real possibility of fam-
ine in many countries of east Africa, 
where over 27 million people are now 
estimated to be suffering from acute 
food insecurity, which is defined as the 
sudden lack of food or the ability to 
produce or access minimum require-
ments of food. 
I should note that in the case of one 
of the nations most impacted, Ethi-
opia, the political situation has simul-
taneously deteriorated, so that the 
country is now on the brink of civil 
war with the added crisis of refugees 
fleeing conflicted areas added to the 
mix 
of 
cascading 
calamities 
and 
compounding crises. 
Indeed, the Food and Agriculture Or-
ganization, the FAO, estimates that 
this infestation of locusts will persist 
until at least March 2021 in both Ethi-
opia and Somalia. 
Our bill would create an interagency 
working group comprised of represent-
atives of the USAID, State, the NSC, 
the Department of Defense, and the De-
partment of Agriculture to formulate a 
strategic plan to address this and fu-
ture locust outbreaks, as well as other 
similarly destructive pests, such as fall 
armyworm, which wreaks tremendous 
havoc on crops annually. 
The working group would also in-
clude a representative from our mis-
sion to the United Nations food agen-
cies based in Rome, where our current 
ambassador, Kip Tom, is doing a stellar 
job interacting with both the World 
Food Programme and the Food and Ag-
riculture Organization, as well as lo-
cust-impacted countries. 
Ambassador Kip Tom has briefed me 
and others repeatedly. We have talked 
about best practices on the phone in 
Skype phone calls, and again, I want to 
single him out for the tremendous job 
that he has done in trying to mitigate 
this crisis. 
The World Food Programme has also 
been a tremendous help, as it has been 
in so many other places around the 
world, under the extraordinary leader-
ship of David Beasley. 
b 1345 
Indeed, the international community 
has recognized the yeoman’s work by 
awarding the World Food Program the 
Nobel Peace Prize. 
Ambassador Tom has been pushing 
the FAO in particular to proactively 
address the problem and adopt the bet-
ter use of technology. For example, use 
of apps on smartphones in Kenya advo-
cated by the Ambassador has led to 
roughly 80 percent of the data collected 
on the location of desert locusts, there-
by allowing for the targeted mobiliza-
tion of aerial assets for locust eradi-
cation and control. 
It is innovation such as this, and the 
adoption of best practices, which our 
interagency group will focus on identi-
fying and implementing. Indeed, we 
also think that the working group will 
help ensure that our taxpayer dollars 
are spent in the most effective way 
possible. The United States Govern-
ment has committed over $24 million 
to the USAID, and that has made a dif-
ference as well. 
While the focus of our bill is on East 
Africa, other countries like Yemen, 
India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan are 
threatened by these spreading swarms 
as well. Indeed, Yemen has become a 
breeding ground for locusts crossing 
over 
into 
the 
Horn 
of 
Africa, 
compounding the problem caused by in-
digenous swarms in the countries of 
the Horn. 
Again, Mr. Speaker, I urge strong 
support for the bill. And again, I thank 
our distinguished chairman for his 
leadership on this bill and so many 
others. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, once again, I thank Mr. 
SMITH for his work on this legislation. 
Mr. SMITH, through the years, has done 
great work on so many issues. I think 
he is the only one on the Foreign Af-
fairs Committee that has actually been 
there longer than I have. We have col-
laborated on a good many projects, bi-
partisan projects, through the years. I 
thank Mr. SMITH for being such a good 
member of the committee. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support 
this legislation. It is very important. It 
is very important for our country. It is 
very important for the world. I urge all 
my colleagues to support it, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
ENGEL) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 7276, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
The title of the bill was amended so 
as to read: ‘‘A bill to establish an inter-

trol locust outbreaks in the East Afri-
ca region and address future outbreaks 
in order to avert mass scale food inse-

Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 5586) to measure the progress of 
recovery and development efforts in 
Haiti and the strength of democracy 
and rule of law in the country, as 
amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 5586 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Haiti Devel-
opment, Accountability, and Institutional 
Transparency Initiative Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) On January 12, 2010, a massive earth-
quake struck near the Haitian capital city of 
Port-au-Prince, leaving an estimated 220,000 
people dead, including 103 United States citi-
zens, 101 United Nations personnel, and near-
ly 18 percent of the nation’s civil service, as 
well as 300,000 injured, 115,000 homes de-
stroyed, and 1,500,000 people displaced. 
(2) The Post Disaster Needs Assessment 
conducted by the Government of Haiti, the 
United Nations, the World Bank, the Inter- 
American Development Bank, and others es-
timated that damage and economic losses 
from the January 12, 2010, earthquake to-
taled $7,804,000,000. 
(3) The international community, led by 
the United States and the United Nations, 
mounted an unprecedented humanitarian re-
sponse to the earthquake in Haiti. Through 
2018, more than $8 billion has been disbursed 
by donors. Since the 2010 earthquake, the 
United States Government has disbursed 
more than $4,000,000,000 in recovery and de-
velopment funding. 
(4) On October 4, 2016, Hurricane Matthew 
struck southwestern Haiti on the Tiburon 
Peninsula, causing widespread damage and 
flooding and leaving 1.4 million people in 
need of immediate assistance. Recovery ef-
forts continue more than three years later. 
(5) Prior to both the earthquake and hurri-
cane, Haiti registered among the lowest so-
cioeconomic indicators and had the second 
highest rate of income disparity in the world 
- conditions that have further complicated 
disaster recovery and resilience efforts. 
(6) In June 2019 the World Food Program 
reported that Haiti has one of the highest 
levels of chronic food insecurity in the 
world, with more than half of its total popu-
lation chronically food insecure and 22 per-
cent of children chronically malnourished. 
(7) In October 2010, an unprecedented out-
break of cholera in Haiti resulted in over 
800,000 reported cases and over 9,000 deaths to 
date. The Pan American Health Organization 
reported in 2018 that the cholera incidence 
rate in Haiti is 25.5 cases per 100,000. 
(8) With United States assistance, almost 
14,000 jobs have been created since the 2010 
earthquake, largely in the apparel industry 
at the Caracol Industrial Park (in partner-
ship with the Inter-American Development 
Bank, the Haitian Government, and the pri-
vate sector) in northern Haiti. 
(9) According to the Haitian National 
Human Rights Defense Network, on Novem-
ber 13, 2018, at least 59 people were shot and 
killed in the Port-au-Prince neighborhood of 
La Saline. After months of investigations, no 
one has been held responsible for the La Sa-
line massacre. 
(10) Since 2018, tens of thousands of Hai-
tians have participated in popular dem-
onstrations demanding accountability over 
government management of Petrocaribe re-
sources. In early 2019, the Haitian superior 
court of auditors released a series of reports 
implicating high-level government officials 
in the misappropriation of funds.

November 18, 2020 
(11) From August 2018 through February 
2019, local human rights organizations re-
ported that 64 Haitian citizens were killed in 
protests. 
(12) According to the Committee to Protect 
Journalists, five Haitian journalists were 
shot while covering protests in 2019 and one 
was killed. On September 23, 2019, Associated 
Press photojournalist Chery Dieu-Nalio was 
shot by Haitian Senator Jean Marie Ralph 
Fe´thie`re when the Senator fired multiple 
shots near a crowd outside of parliament. 
(13) Economic growth in Haiti is projected 
to drop below 1.5 percent this year. Inflation 
is estimated to be 15 percent and the local 
currency has depreciated by 30 percent in the 
past year. The Haitian government and par-
liament have failed to pass a budget for two 
years, preventing the International Mone-
tary Fund and other multilaterals from dis-
bursing millions in international assistance. 
(14) Midterm elections set for October 2019 
did not take place, and since January 2020 
President Moise has ruled by decree. 
SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
It is the policy of the United States to sup-
port the sustainable rebuilding and develop-
ment of Haiti in a manner that— 
(1) recognizes Haitian independence, self- 
reliance, sovereignty, democratic govern-
ance, and efficiency; 
(2) promotes Haitian-led efforts for recon-
struction and development of Haiti; 
(3) strengthens the capacity of civil society

the following: 
(A) An examination of any links between 
the massacre in La Saline and mass protests 
that occurred concurrently in the country. 
(B) An analysis of the reports on the La 
Saline massacre authored by the United Na-
tions, the European Union, and the Haitian 
Government. 
(C) A detailed description of all known ac-
tors implicated in the shooting. 
(D) An overview of efforts taken by the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5899 
November 18, 2020 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. ENGEL) and the gen-
tleman from New Jersey (Mr. SMITH) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unan-
imous consent that all Members have 5 
legislative days in which to revise and 
extend their remarks and include in 
the RECORD
extraneous material on 
H.R. 5586. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, let me start by thank-
ing Mr. JEFFRIES for authoring this bi-
partisan bill. He has been a strong ad-
vocate for the Haitian people, and I 
thank him for his leadership on this 
issue. 
There are many, many colleagues in 
this Congress who feel very strongly 
about the U.S. relationship with Haiti. 
I am certainly one of them, and I know 
Mr. SMITH
is and, of course, Mr. 
JEFFRIES and many other people on our 
committee. 
We have Haiti, which is not that far 
from the United States, and is really, I 
think, an obligation of the United 
States, helping the people of Haiti. 
There has been such misery and such 
problems there that they really need 
our help, our continued and sustained 
help. 
Again, Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. 
JEFFRIES
for his leadership on this 
issue. 
On January 12, 2010, a magnitude 7.0 
earthquake struck Haiti, displacing 1.5 
million people and killing more than 
200,000. 
Less than 2 months after the earth-
quake, I had the opportunity to visit 
Haiti and survey the damage. I stand 
here today with the same message my 
colleagues and I delivered to the Hai-
tian people 10 years ago: The United 
States remains steadfast in its com-
mitment to assist Haiti in its time of 
need. 
Over the last decade, Congress has 
worked closely with the Haitian-Amer-
ican diaspora, the Haitian people, and 
the Haitian Government to support re-
building and development efforts on 
the island, but Haiti still has a long 
way to go. 
As we support efforts to reconstruct 
Haiti, we must learn from our mistakes 
over the past 10 years and devise inno-
vative solutions to overcome the many 
remaining challenges. 
At the same time, it is imperative 
that the Haitian Government address 
the growing and legitimate concerns 
about 
the 
country’s 
deteriorating 
human 
rights 
situations, 
attacks 
against the press and peaceful pro-
testers as well, and the lack of ac-
countability for corrupt officials. 
The Haiti Development, Account-
ability, and Institutional Transparency 
Initiative Act will help move us toward 
these goals. It evaluates the effective-
ness of U.S. recovery and develop-
mental efforts in Haiti over the past 10 
years. It also promotes new strategies 
to enhance the rule of law, encourage 
freedom of the press, combat govern-
ment corruption, address the root 
causes of poverty, and improve devel-
opmental efforts. 
It is the duty of all of us here in Con-
gress to stand with the Haitian people. 
Geographically, they are so close to 
the United States, and there are many 
Haitian Americans as well. 
We need to stand with the Haitian 
people as they fight for a more pros-
perous and democratic Haiti, and I 
urge the Haitian Government to do all 
it can to engage with their citizens and 
truly listen to their concerns. 
Mr. Speaker, I was pleased that the 
House Foreign Affairs Committee ad-
vanced 
this 
bipartisan 
bill 
unani-
mously, and I urge my colleagues to 
join me in supporting its passage in the 
House today. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 5586, the Haiti Development, 
Accountability, 
and 
Institutional 
Transparency Initiative Act, authored 
by Mr. JEFFRIES and ANN WAGNER. 
Haiti remains the poorest country in 
the Western Hemisphere and continues 
to struggle under fragile public institu-
tions. As we speak, Haiti is facing a 
constitutional crisis without a sitting 
parliament after failing to organize 
legislative elections in 2019. We con-
tinue to encourage the Government of 
Haiti to hold these elections as soon as 
possible. 
Haiti continues to struggle with dis-
aster recovery from the earthquake in 
2010 and Hurricane Matthew in 2016, as 
well as civil unrest, increasing gang vi-
olence, and accusations of government 
corruption and human rights abuses. 
Haiti remains the second largest re-
cipient of U.S. assistance in the region, 
including over $128 million in foreign 
assistance appropriated by Congress in 
2019 for economic development, democ-
racy and rule of law, and critical sup-
port for the Haitian National Police. 
This 
legislation 
prioritizes 
anticorruption efforts, press freedoms, 
and human rights, and it requires the 
Department of State to develop a strat-
egy with benchmarks and indicators to 
measure the progress toward stated ob-
jectives for U.S. assistance. 
This bill also requires an assessment 
of U.S. support for disaster resilience 
to ensure that our assistance is effec-
tuating Haiti’s recovery efforts and 
strengthening infrastructure against 
future disasters. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support it, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. JEFFRIES), the author of this 
important bill, the chair of our Demo-
cratic Caucus, the gentleman from New 
York, even though it is Brooklyn. 
Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my distinguished colleague, the chair-
man of the Foreign Affairs Committee, 
ELIOT ENGEL from the Boogie Down 
Bronx, for yielding me the time. 
Mr. Speaker, I certainly want to take 
a moment of personal privilege just to 
thank Chairman ENGEL for his friend-
ship, his support, and his extraordinary 
leadership year after year on behalf of 
the people of New York City and the 
Nation as a critically important mem-
ber of the House Democratic Caucus 
and a tremendous, legendary public 
servant. 
Today, we vote on H.R. 5586, the 
Haiti 
Development, 
Accountability, 
and Institutional Transparency Initia-
tive Act, a bill to upgrade the U.S. for-
eign assistance strategy to Haiti. 
Haiti was the first nation in the Car-
ibbean to gain independence. It is the 
world’s first Black-led republic, home 
to resilient and entrepreneurial people. 
Haiti has tremendous potential to 
thrive as a free, fair, and prosperous 
democracy. 
I am proud to represent a vibrant 
community of Haitian Americans in 
Brooklyn and Queens, including Little 
Haiti in Brooklyn, which is a neigh-
boring 
congressional 
district 
rep-
resented by Congresswoman YVETTE 
CLARKE. 
As much of the diaspora has commu-
nicated to me, unfortunately, Haiti 
still faces severe challenges in its quest 
to achieve full prosperity for its people 
and the opportunity to live in a free, 
democratic society. 
This January marked the 10-year an-
niversary of the catastrophic Haiti 
earthquake that killed and displaced 
hundreds of thousands of people. 
Since 2010, Haiti has gone through 
additional hardships like Hurricane 
Matthew, fuel shortages, food insecu-
rity, and now the coronavirus pan-
demic. 
Many Haitians are frustrated by the 
corruption, poverty, and undemocratic 
practices on the island. Since 2018, 
mass demonstrations in Haiti protested 
the country’s economic situation and 
the Haitian Government’s apparent 
misappropriation of the Petrocaribe oil 
dollars. 
Tens of thousands of protesters also 
demanded the resignation of the cur-
rent President, who has been ruling by 
decree since January 2020. 
H.R. 5586 directs the State Depart-
ment and USAID to evaluate the effec-
tiveness and shortcomings of U.S. for-
eign aid to Haiti over the past 10 years. 
The bill also directs these two agencies 
to devise new approaches to reduce 
poverty and promote good governance. 
Mr. Speaker, once again, I thank 
Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman 
ELIOT
ENGEL
and Ranking Member 
MCCAUL, 
Western 
Hemisphere 
Sub-
committee Chairman SIRES and Rank-
ing Member ROONEY, Congresswoman

November 18, 2020 
ANN WAGNER, and Democrats and Re-
publicans on both sides of the aisle, as 
well as the organizations supporting 
this bipartisan bill. 
The United States should always 
stand with our neighbor in the Western 
Hemisphere and the Haitian people as 
they fight for a self-governing, demo-
cratic, and prosperous nation. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote in favor of this bill. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I once 
again thank Mr. JEFFRIES for author-
ing this important legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle to support this 
legislation, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
ENGEL) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5586, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
The title of the bill was amended so 
as to read: ‘‘A bill To measure the 
progress of recovery and efforts to ad-
dress corruption, rule of law, and 
media freedoms in Haiti.’’. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. 
In this Act: 
(1) APPROPRIATE
CONGRESSIONAL
COMMIT-
TEES.—The term ‘‘appropriate congressional 
committees’’ means— 
(A) the Committee on Foreign Affairs and 
the Committee on Appropriations of the 
House of Representatives; and 
(B) the Committee on Foreign Relations 
and the Committee on Appropriations of the 
Senate.

BENEFICIARY
COUNTRIES.—The

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. ESPAILLAT) and the gen-
tleman from New Jersey (Mr. SMITH) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude any extraneous material on H.R. 
7703. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I first want to thank 
Chairman ENGEL for his leadership of 
the Foreign Affairs Committee and his 
role in passing this important bill. 
I also want to thank my colleague, 
Mr. ROONEY, a staunch supporter of the 
Caribbean, for leading this bill with 
me, and Ranking Member MCCAUL for 
his collaboration. 
The Caribbean Basin Security Initia-
tive is a vital tool to combat the illicit 
drug trade, promote good government, 
and improve civil society. The inter-
national narcotics trade has a dev-
astating impact across our hemisphere, 
and much of the demand for illegal 
drugs, unfortunately, comes from right 
here in the U.S. 
We have worked hard to stop drug 
trafficking and combat corruption in 
Central America and Mexico, but all 
too often, our allies in the Caribbean 
are overlooked. 
The Caribbean is our third border 
and, for decades, has been growing as a 
hub for the illegal and illicit drug 
trade. Proper investment in the Carib-
bean will help to improve our allies’ 
capacity 
to 
combat 
transnational 
crime, violence, and regional insta-
bility, while also enhancing our secu-
rity. 
Crime from the drug trade has rat-
tled many of our allies in the region, 
and this funding will go to programs 
that interdict traffickers, provide pro-
gramming for at-risk youth, and im-
prove the independence of the judicial 
system in those Caribbean countries. 
This bill also adds a focus on disaster 
resilience, given the increasingly fre-
quent and worsening hurricanes in the 
region, which I believe is of primary 
importance as we continue to see the 
impact of climate change on national 
and regional security. 
We have seen the success of the Car-
ibbean Basin Security Initiative over 
the last decade, and this bill will build 
on the success by authorizing $74.8 mil-
lion per year for the next 5 years to 
further deepen our commitment to 
that region. 
By partnering to increase the secu-
rity and stability of our Caribbean al-
lies as we combat the narcotics trade, 
we will also be reducing the flow of il-
licit drugs into the United States. 
I believe CBSI is a crucial program, 
and I ask my colleagues to join in bol-
stering it. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
7703, the Caribbean Basin Security Ini-
tiative Authorization Act, authored by 
Mr. ESPAILLAT and Mr. ROONEY, and I 
want to thank them for their leader-
ship on this. 
The countries of the Caribbean con-
tinue to face serious security chal-
lenges from criminal organizations, 
drug 
trafficking, 
corruption, 
and 
threats to the rule of law that seri-
ously jeopardize the people of these na-
tions as well as U.S. security interests 
in the region. 
Since 2010, the U.S. Congress has pro-
vided nearly $677 million to support the 
region’s efforts to address these threats 
under the Caribbean Basin Security 
Initiative, or CBSI. Funding under 
CBSI has supported training for law en-
forcement, 
counternarcotics 
efforts, 
border and port security, and strength-
ening of the rule of law. The assistance 
has strengthened U.S. security co-
operation with our Caribbean partners 
and remains critical as transnational 
criminal and terrorist organizations 
continue to threaten their security. 
The legislation before us today au-
thorizes $74.8 million for the CBSI for 
each year until 2025 and continues to 
prioritize capacity building for local 
law enforcement, disruption of crimi-
nal organizations, drug and firearm 
interdiction, 
rule 
of 
law, 
and 
anticorruption efforts. 
The bill also supports disaster resil-
ience and requires the State Depart-
ment to establish benchmarks and in-
dicators to track progress towards 
CBSI’s stated objectives. 
I would also point out this legislation 
also includes important requirements 
for monitoring and countering the ma-
lign influence of the Chinese Com-
munist Party in the region. 
I congratulate the gentleman on his 
very fine bill, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from 
the 
Virgin 
Islands 
(Ms. 
PLASKETT). 
Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I want 
to thank my colleague representing the 
great people of New York, but also who 
hails from the Caribbean and under-
stands the importance of legislation 
like this. 
As the representative of a Caribbean 
island, an English-speaking Caribbean 
island, I am grateful to be yielded the 
opportunity to talk about this impor-
tant Caribbean Basin Security Initia-
tive. 
Traffickers frequently transport co-
caine and other contraband from South 
America through the Caribbean Sea. 
Building the law enforcement and 
interdiction capabilities of our Carib-
bean partners helps them stop illicit 
flows, making our Caribbean nations 
safer. 
By 
developing 
these 
capabilities, 
partner countries also can hold per-
petrators accountable and deter fur-
ther criminal activity that might harm 
their citizens, threaten their econo-
mies, and endanger U.S. citizens at 
home and as tourists in the Caribbean. 
The United States has committed 
over $556 million for CBSI for fiscal 
years 2010 to 2018. Congress has appro-
priated $58 million for fiscal year 2020. 
Bravo. 
To enhance maritime domain aware-
ness and interdiction, we have im-
proved radar coverage and sharing ca-
pacity, enhanced port security, and 
provided boats, equipment, and train-
ing to partner nations.

CBSI programs have yielded a 250 per-
cent increase in cocaine interdictions. 
USAID programming targets the driv-
ers of youth crime and violence to re-
duce the risk of youth involvement in 
transnational organized crime. 
USAID uses risk assessment tools to 
identify at-risk youth in countries like 
St. Lucia, St. Kitts and Nevis, and 
Guyana. USAID then partners with 
those host countries, delivering sup-
port to families and youth. Across 
those three countries, 75 percent of the 
youth targeted have reduced risk lev-
els. 
To augment law enforcement, CBSI 
supports efforts to professionalize and 
reform law enforcement institutions 
and enables partner governments to 
better prevent, investigate, and pros-
ecute crime. These are tremendous 
tools. 
Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Is-
lands are transshipment points for il-
licit drugs that have been smuggled 
from source countries into the U.S. 
mainland, as well as destination points 
for drugs distributed within the two 
territories. This bill is very essential 
to us. 
Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Is-
lands are situated between the U.S. 
mainland and drug-source countries 
such as Colombia and Peru, making 
them ideal gateways for movement of 
illicit drugs onward to the U.S. main-
land. 
The 
Caribbean 
sits 
as 
a 
trans-
shipment area for so many goods: first, 
people, sugar, and, in many instances, 
drug trafficking now. 
Drug trafficking organizations and 
criminal groups use commercial and 
private maritime vessels, commercial 
private aircraft, and package delivery 
services to smuggle illicit drugs into 
and through Puerto Rico and the U.S. 
Virgin Islands. 
Large 
drug 
shipments 
are 
often 
offloaded in Puerto Rico and the U.S. 
Virgin Islands, repackaged, and stored 
in secluded areas until they are distrib-
uted locally or transported to the U.S. 
mainland. 
What is the outcome of this? Wreak-
ing havoc in our communities. 
There were 52 murders this year on 
the Virgin Islands, 49.2 per 100,000 peo-
ple; in 2018, a whopping 52 individuals 
in a community of 100,000 people. Many 
of those deaths—most of those deaths— 
related to drug trafficking, drugs that 
we do not even use on the islands. 
This bill is vital to combating drug 
trafficking, promoting good govern-
ance, independent justice sectors, and 
empowering civil society in the Carib-
bean. 
Too often, the Caribbean is ignored. 
We must correct this by deepening our 
partnerships 
and 
cooperation 
with 
some of our closest allies. Working to-
gether, we can help increase citizen se-
curity, build resilience to natural dis-
asters caused by climate change, and 
improve strategies to reduce illegal 
narcotics trafficking.

HORSFORD). The time of the gentle-

Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I

Islands an additional 1 minute. 
Ms. 
PLASKETT. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
won’t need all of that minute, but I 
want to thank the gentleman for the 
time. 
This bill is so vital, not only to stop-
ping drug trafficking, but supporting 
our communities, helping youth within 
the Caribbean to reach their potential. 
I want to thank the authors of this 
bill. I am grateful this is a bipartisan 
effort to not forget the Caribbean. I 
thank my colleague, Mr. ESPAILLAT, 
and the members of the committee. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, this 
is an important bill, and I urge my col-

SEAS 
INITIATIVE 
IN 
ITS 
EF-
FORTS 
TO 
INCREASE 
ENERGY 
INDEPENDENCE 
AND 
INFRA-
STRUCTURE CONNECTIVITY 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and agree to 
the resolution (H. Res. 672) expressing 
support of the Three Seas Initiative in 
its efforts to increase energy independ-
ence and infrastructure connectivity 
thereby 
strengthening 
the 
United 
States and European national security, 
as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the resolu-
tion. 
The text of the resolution is as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 672 
Whereas, in 2015, 12 Central and European 
nations of the European Union established 
the Three Seas Initiative to increase energy, 
infrastructure, and digital communications 
autonomy and resilience through support of 
collective financing for new infrastructure 
projects to connect the region between the 
Adriatic, Baltic, and Black Seas; 
Whereas the United States pledged support 
and willingness to serve as a steadfast part-
ner of the Three Seas Initiative’s effort at 
the July 2017 Warsaw summit; 
Whereas, in February 2020, the Secretary of 
State announced a United States commit-
ment of up to $1,000,000,000 in financing for 
Three Seas Initiative countries to promote 
energy security and economic growth; 
Whereas the Three Seas Initiative will ad-
vance economic growth, resilience, transport 
and digital connectivity, and energy security 
in this strategic region, thereby increasing 
the national security of the United States; 
Whereas the President of the European 
Commission recognized the Three Seas Ini-
tiative as a ‘‘catalyst for the cohesion and 
convergence of the EU and for the strength-
ening of the transatlantic link’’; 
Whereas Soviet-imposed communist rule in 
Central and Eastern Europe left the region 
with a significant infrastructure deficit, es-
pecially in the realm of north-south trans-
portation and energy lines; 
Whereas the current state of infrastructure 
in Central and Eastern Europe nations re-
stricts energy, water, and telecommuni-
cations interconnectivity across the region; 
Whereas the infrastructure deficit leaves 
these nations overly dependent on Russia for 
their energy and additional economic needs; 
Whereas Russia seeks to undermine demo-
cratic institutions and liberty in Europe 
through hybrid means, including using en-
ergy as a tool for coercion; 
Whereas Russian gas pipeline projects, 
such as Nord Stream II and Turk Stream, 
are political and seek to undermine Europe’s 
energy security; 
Whereas the Three Seas Initiative provides 
a positive alternative for financing for trans-
port, 
energy 
and 
digital 
connectivity 
projects in the Three Seas region to China’s 
17+1 and Belt and Road Initiatives, which 
have exported corruption, debt traps, and 
poor labor and environmental standards; 
Whereas diversification of energy sources 
and supply routes, including development of 
renewable energy sources and technology, is 
critical to bolstering energy security; 
Whereas members of the Three Seas Initia-
tive have prioritized key energy projects 
such as the Krk, Croatia LNG terminal, Gas 
Interconnector Republic of Poland-Republic 
of Lithuania, the Bulgaria-Romania-Hun-
gary-Austria (BRUA) gas interconnector, 
and other cross-border interconnections; 
Whereas members of the Three Seas Initia-
tive have also prioritized key digital infra-
structure and transportation projects to sup-
port modern and vibrant economies includ-
ing the Three Seas Initiative Digital High-
way, the Viking Train, the Adriatic TEN-T 
Core Network Corridor, and the FAIRway 
Danube, among others; and 
Whereas the Three Seas Initiative includes 
vital allies of the United States: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives— 
(1) supports the Three Seas Initiative in its 
efforts to increase energy resilience and in-
frastructure connectivity across Central and 
Eastern Europe and to further the process of 
building a Europe that is undivided, secure, 
prosperous, and free; 
(2) encourages Three Seas Initiative na-
tions to take action on joint financing of 
projects to strengthen energy, infrastruc-
ture, and digital communications projects in 
Central 
and 
Eastern 
Europe, 
including 
through national contributions to the Three 
Seas Initiative Infrastructure Fund; 
(3) reaffirms the authority of the President 
under the Build Act of 2018 (division F of 
Public Law 115–254) to provide United States 
financing to the Three Seas Initiative and its 
projects in cases that advance national eco-
nomic or foreign policy interests of the 
United States and would produce significant 
developmental outcomes or provide develop-
mental benefits to the poorest population; 
(4) reaffirms the authority of the United 
States International Development Finance 
Corporation under the European Energy Se-
curity and Diversification Act of 2019 (title 
XX of division P of Public Law 116–94) to pro-
vide support for the Three Seas Initiative 
and its energy infrastructure projects in 
countries with upper-middle-income or high- 
income economies in cases described in para-
graph (3) or if such support is necessary to 
preempt or counter efforts by a strategic 
competitor of the United States to secure 
significant political or economic leverage or

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. ESPAILLAT) and the gen-
tleman from New Jersey (Mr. SMITH) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude in the RECORD any extraneous 
material on H. Res. 672. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of this legislation, and I would like to 
thank Congresswoman KAPTUR for her 
leadership and hard work. This is a 
strong, 
bipartisan 
resolution 
that 
seeks to promote and encourage Eu-
rope’s independence from Russia’s coer-
cive energy influence and ensure great-
er interconnectivity of infrastructure 
in the region. 
Our Eastern European allies and 
partners know all too well the need to 
get out from under Russia’s strangle-
hold on the region’s energy resources, 
and this resolution sends an important 
message that Congress stands with our 
close friends as they look to build up 
their own capacity. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
legislation, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. 
Res. 672. I want to thank MARCY KAP-
TUR for offering it. It is a very impor-
tant bill to express support for the 
Three Seas Initiative. 
Launched by 12 of our close friends in 
central and Eastern Europe, the Three 
Seas Initiative seeks to expand cross- 
border energy, transportation, and dig-
ital infrastructure, as well as to boost 
economic development in the region. 
Though it is a regional initiative, it 
has global implications that serve not 
only European but also U.S. security 
and economic interests. 
For far too long, Mr. Speaker, Vladi-
mir Putin has had an energy chokehold 
on much of Europe. In response, I have 
worked with my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle to strongly oppose 
Putin’s efforts to weaponize Russia’s 
energy resources, including by working 
to ensure that the Nord Stream 2 pipe-
line is never completed. 
Moreover, we in Congress have ex-
pressed growing concern that the CCP 
is exporting corruption, debt traps, 
poor labor and environmental stand-
ards to Europe and across the world 
through its 17+1 and Belt and Road Ini-
tiatives. 
We have also raised the alarm for our 
EU and NATO allies about the threats 
that Huawei and the Chinese Com-
munist Party pose as partners. 
The Three Seas Initiative seeks to 
address these concerns. It aims to de-
crease European dependence on Rus-
sian energy by financing new routes for 
non-Russian energy suppliers and to 
provide positive alternatives to PRC 
investments in the region. 
We must support our allies in Central 
and Eastern Europe as they seek, 
through the Three Seas Initiative, to 
reduce their dependence on Moscow’s 
and Beijing’s economic overtures. 
Only together can we face the threats 
posed by the authoritarian regimes in 
China and Russia. Therefore, I ask my 
colleagues to support this important 
legislation, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
b 1415 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR), who is the au-
thor of this important resolution. 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I wish to 
thank Chairman ESPAILLAT
for the 
time in support of H. Res. 672, which is 
a bipartisan resolution, and I appre-
ciate his help in moving it through the 
subcommittee and committee. This 
resolution was introduced with our col-
league, Congressman ADAM KINZINGER. 
I want to thank Ranking Member 
SMITH for his years of dedication on the 
committee as well. 
This resolution expresses robust sup-
port for the Three Seas Initiative to 
accelerate the development of cross- 
border infrastructure in Central and 
Eastern Europe. 
I am also very grateful to the chair-
man of the full committee, ELIOT 
ENGEL, who has given the best years of 
his life to this country and our inter-
ests around the world, and to Ranking 
Member 
MCCAUL
and 
Congressman 
KEATING
for their commitment to 
strengthen the Transatlantic Alliance. 
I thank again my colleague, Con-
gressman KINZINGER, for his partner-
ship to shepherd this resolution to the 
floor. 
I also extend special thanks to Ma-
jority Leader HOYER and his staff asso-
ciate Daniel Silverberg for their sup-
port. 
Throughout the Cold War, the United 
States led efforts to expand liberty in 
Europe. After the collapse of the Berlin 
Wall in 1989, the United States wel-
comed the people of the region into the 
community of democratic nations. Yet 
Soviet tyranny left this strategic re-
gion without a significant infrastruc-
ture—actually a huge infrastructure 
deficit—increasing dependence on ma-
lign influence from Russia and, yes, 
China, too. 
Tragically, Russia seeks to divide 
Europe by exploiting Europe’s energy 
dependence, 
including 
through 
the 
Nord Stream 2 and TurkStream pipe-
lines. Meanwhile, Chinese state-linked 
companies like Huawei offer predatory 
financing to capture Europe’s tele-
communications 
networks 
creating 
surveillance vulnerabilities. 
In response, 12 U.S. allies in Central 
and Eastern Europe launched the Three 
Seas Initiative and Investment Fund. 
The initiative provides a critical plat-
form to pool financing to construct in-
frastructure projects free from malign 
influence. Currently, the Three Seas 
fund totals $1.4 billion. The first in-
vestment has been made in the trans-
portation infrastructure sector. 
This resolution encourages Three 
Seas member nations to increase in-
vestments into the fund. Further, it 
strongly urges that the vision of a 
cross-border cooperation be extended 
to non-E.U. nations such as Ukraine 
and Moldova. Importantly, this legisla-
tion encourages support for financing 
of clean energy to counter the scourge 
of climate change. Following this reso-
lution’s 
introduction, 
the 
United 
States pledged up to $1 billion to fi-
nance energy security projects through 
the Three Seas Investment Fund. 
In conclusion, the transatlantic rela-
tionship is the bedrock of U.S. foreign 
policy. Out of the ashes of two world 
wars, visionary leaders created institu-
tions like NATO to protect and expand 
liberty. 
The Three Seas Initiative—this time 
launched and led by our Allies—is the 
next step to complete the transatlantic 
project. It will ensure a Europe in this 
21st century that is whole, free, and at 
peace. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I have no further speakers, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, again, 
I want to thank Congresswoman KAP-
TUR for her work on this measure and 
for being an advocate for energy secu-
rity and the United States-European 
cooperation on this particular issue. 
Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to 
support this measure, I urge all Mem-
bers to do the same, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in 
support of H. Res. 672, a resolution that rein-
forces our Eastern European allies in the 
Three Seas Initiative. 
Since the Iron Curtain was lifted in 1991, 
citizens of Eastern European countries have 
suffered the economic consequences of poorly 
kept, soviet-era infrastructure that ensures 
their reliance on Russia for generations to 
come.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5904 
November 18, 2020 
As we all know, the goal of the Three Seas 
Initiative is to diversify resources in the region 
by collectively investing in cross border 
projects into the EU. 
Reclaiming valuable economic leverage will 
open doors to enhanced energy development 
and expand access to global markets. 
By capitalizing on this partnership, countries 
of the Three Seas Initiative are better 
equipped to meet the needs of a 21st century 
economy. 
A more economically prosperous and se-
cure Eastern Europe is in the interest of Amer-
ican foreign policy. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in sup-
porting the Three Seas Initiative and pass H. 
Res. 672. 
I want to thank the sponsor, Congress-
woman KAPTUR, Chairman KEATING, and 
Ranking Member KINZINGER for their leader-
ship.

position leader Alexei Navalny and 
calling for a robust United States and 
international response, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the resolu-
tion. 
The text of the resolution is as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 1145 
Whereas Alexei Navalny is a well-known 
anticorruption activist and leader of the po-
litical opposition in Russia; 
Whereas Mr. Navalny garnered 27 percent 
of the vote in the 2013 Moscow mayoral elec-
tion;

Whereas, in November 2019, after Russian 
agents used a Novichok-class nerve agent in 
an attempted assassination of former Rus-
sian spy Sergei Skripal in the United King-
dom in March 2018, CWC parties agreed to 
add the Novichok group of nerve agents to

chemical warfare agents that are subject to 
declaration requirements and other restric-

Whereas, on September 4, 2020, NATO 
strongly condemned the attack on Mr. 
Navalny and called on the Russian Federa-

Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives— 
(1) condemns the apparently purposeful 
poisoning on August 20, 2020, of Russian 
anticorruption activist and opposition leader 
Alexei Navalny; 
(2) expresses its appreciation for the 
prompt and generous efforts of the Cinema 
for Peace Foundation and the Government of 
the Federal Republic of Germany to ensure 
high-quality health care for Mr. Navalny 
after he was poisoned by facilitating his 
transfer by airlift from Russia to Germany; 
(3) welcomes reports that Mr. Navalny has 
emerged from a medically induced coma and 
is gradually recovering from the poisoning; 
(4) hopes for Mr. Navalny’s full and com-
plete recovery so that he may promptly re-
sume his life and work; 
(5) urges the Organization for Security and 
Cooperation in Europe and multilateral 
human rights monitoring bodies to monitor 
the case of the August 2020 poisoning of 
Alexei Navalny as a probable violation of his 
fundamental human rights and to respond 
accordingly; 
(6) calls on the Government of the Russian 
Federation to cooperate with independent, 
impartial, and thorough investigations by 
competent authorities and the Organization 
for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons of 
the reported poisoning of Alexei Navalny; 
(7) calls on the United States Government 
to support international or multilateral ef-
forts to ensure an independent, impartial, 
and thorough investigations by competent 
authorities and the Organization for the Pro-
hibition of Chemical Weapons of the reported 
poisoning of Alexei Navalny; 
(8) urges the United States Government, in 
all its interactions with the Government of 
the Russian Federation, to raise the case of 
the poisoning of Alexei Navalny and under-
score the necessity of bringing the orga-
nizers and perpetrators to justice; 
(9) calls on the Secretary of State and the 
Secretary of the Treasury to use their au-
thority under the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of 
Law Accountability Act of 2012 (title IV of 
Public 
Law 
112–208) 
and 
the 
Global 
Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability 
Act (subtitle F of title XII of Public Law 114– 
328) to designate individuals whom they de-
termine upon investigation to have been in-
volved in the poisoning of Alexei Navalny as 
perpetrators, organizers, or masterminds, on 
the list of specially designated nationals and 
blocked persons maintained by the Office of 
Foreign Assets Control of the Department of 
the Treasury, freezing their assets and mak-
ing them ineligible to receive United States 
visas; and 
(10) supports the 60-day review period trig-
gered by the submission of a letter to the 
President by the Chair and Ranking Member 
of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the 
House of Representatives to investigate 
whether the poisoning of Alexei Navalny 
constitutes use of a chemical weapon by the 
Government of the Russian Federation in 
contravention of international law, and if so, 
to impose sanctions pursuant to the Chem-
ical and Biological Weapons Control and 
Warfare Elimination Act of 1991 (Public Law 
102–182; 22 U.S.C. 5601 et seq.). 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. ESPAILLAT) and the gen-
tleman from New Jersey (Mr. SMITH)

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5905 
November 18, 2020 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude in the RECORD extraneous mate-
rial on H. Res. 1145. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of this resolution, and I want to thank 
Mr. MCGOVERN for his leadership and 
hard work. 
In recent years, a number of Russian 
journalists, human rights activists, 
politicians, whistleblowers, and others 
have been killed or died under very 
mysterious circumstances in Russia 
and overseas. The poisoning of Alexei 
Navalny, Russia’s most prominent op-
position leader, is yet another horrific 
example of the ruthlessness under 
President Putin’s government. 
I am proud to support this bipartisan 
resolution which condemns the brutal 
poisoning of Mr. Navalny on August 20, 
2020, calls for U.S. support for a cred-
ible and impartial international inves-
tigation into the attack, and urges 
sanctions against those responsible. It 
is important that the House go on 
record in a bipartisan way to send a 
clear and unequivocal message to the 
Kremlin that we reject their criminal 
tactics and we will demand account-
ability. There must be consequences 
for this egregious act. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this resolution, and I reserve 
the balance of my time.

DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: I am writing con-
cerning H. Res. 1145, the ‘‘Condemning the

Russian 
opposition 
leader 
Alexei Navalny and calling for a robust 
United States and international response.’’ 
In order to permit H. Res. 1145 to proceed ex-
peditiously to the House Floor, I agree to 
forgo formal consideration of the bill. 
The Committee on Financial Services 
takes this action to forego formal consider-
ation of H. Res. 1145 in light of the mutually 
agreed changes to provisions within the ju-
risdiction of the Committee on Financial 
Services. We are also doing so based on our 
mutual understanding that, by foregoing for-
mal consideration of H. Res. 1145 at this 
time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over 
the subject matter contained in this or simi-
lar legislation, and that our Committee will 
be appropriately consulted and involved as 
this or similar legislation moves forward 
with regard to any matters in the Commit-
tee’s jurisdiction. The Committee also re-
serves the right to seek appointment of an 
appropriate number of conferees to any 
House-Senate conference involving this or 
similar legislation that involves the Com-
mittee’s jurisdiction and request your sup-
port for any such request. 
Finally, I would appreciate your response 
to this letter confirming this understanding, 
and I would ask that a copy of our exchange 
of letters on this matter be included in the 
Congressional Record during Floor consider-
ation of H. Res. 1145.

Sincerely, 
ELIOT L. ENGEL, 
Chairman. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to 
begin by thanking my good friend, 
Chairman MCGOVERN, for sponsoring 
this important resolution. I am very 
proud to be one of its cosponsors. 
Both Mr. MCGOVERN and I co-chair 
the Lantos Human Rights Commission, 
and I can tell you, Mr. Speaker, we 
have been trying for years to hold Rus-
sia to account for these kinds of des-
picable displays where, as was pointed 
out by my good friend from New York, 
very visible opposition leaders and oth-
ers have been targeted by the Russian 
regime for poisoning and other kinds of 
deadly deeds. So I want to thank him 
for, again, bringing our attention and 
the House’s attention to this addi-
tional terrible misdeed by Vladimir 
Putin. 
Each of us in this House, I believe, 
were 
appalled 
to 
learn 
that 
Mr. 
Navalny had been poisoned with a So-
viet-era 
chemical 
nerve 
agent. 
Of 
course, we are relieved that he seems 
to be doing well, but that doesn’t in 
any way mitigate the terrible act that 
was committed to try to kill him. We 
are not surprised though. Just 2 years 
ago, the same chemical nerve agent 
was used in an attack on United King-
dom soil against former Russian intel-
ligence officer Sergei Skripal. The at-
tack severely injured him, his daugh-
ter, and a police officer, and also cost 
the life of an innocent British citizen. 
Moreover, since Putin came to power, 
as was pointed out a moment ago, nu-
merous Russian journalists, human 
rights activists, opposition leaders, 
whistleblowers, and others who op-
posed his regime have been murdered 
or died in mysterious circumstances. 
As noted in the resolution, Ranking 
Member MCCAUL and Chairman ENGEL 
wrote a letter to the President after 
the attack to request an investigation 
into whether Russia had, once again, 
used a lethal chemical weapon in viola-
tion of international law. 
Pursuant to the Chemical and Bio-
logical Weapons Control and Warfare 
Elimination Act, this request started 
the clock on a 60-day evaluation period 
to make such a determination. Unfor-
tunately, the deadline has passed, so 
we respectfully—all of us—ask the ad-
ministration to release the findings of 
its investigation and to do so without 
any delay. 
If it is determined, as we suspect, 
that the Putin regime is behind the at-
tack, then additional U.S. sanctions 
must be imposed. His regime must be 
held accountable for resorting to such 
cruel and barbaric methods to silence 
his critics. 
I was glad to see the E.U. support a 
Franco-German plan to impose sanc-
tions on Russians suspected to be be-
hind Mr. Navalny’s poisoning. I also 
continue to hope that our German 
friends will heed the growing calls 
around Europe and within Germany 
since the attack to reconsider their 
support for the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to 
support this resolution. Again, I want 
to thank Chairman MCGOVERN for au-
thoring it, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN), who is 
the author of this important resolution 
and the co-chair of the Tom Lantos 
Human Rights Commission. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I want 
to thank the gentleman from New 
York for his leadership and for yielding 
to me. I also want to thank my col-
league from New Jersey (Mr. SMITH) for 
all of his commitment, not only on 
issues of human rights regarding Rus-
sia, but human rights in general. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. 
Res. 1145, condemning the poisoning of 
Russian anti-corruption and opposition 
leader Alexei Navalny. 
Since Vladimir Putin took power in 
1999, human rights defenders, journal-
ists, and opposition politicians have 
suffered relentless persecution. Some 
have 
been 
killed, 
like 
Anna 
Politkovskaya, 
in 
2006, 
and 
Boris 
Nemtsov in 2015. Others, like Alexei 
Navalny, have been targeted but sur-
vived. Navalny was attacked twice 
with a chemical substance in 2017, like-
ly poisoned in 2019 while in prison, and 
seriously poisoned in August 2020. 
I am thankful that Navalny is recov-
ering from the latest attack, but I re-
gret that the Trump administration’s 
response has been so feeble. Secretary 
Pompeo issued one statement, days 
late, and after German experts con-
firmed the poisoning, in which he 
merely called for an investigation. 
Today, with this resolution, Congress 
is stepping forward to make clear that 
the United States is appalled by the at-
tack on Alexei Navalny and supports a 
robust response. 
This resolution: 
Condemns the poisoning; 
Thanks 
Germany 
for 
facilitating 
Navalny’s transfer to ensure high qual-
ity medical care; 
Welcomes his recovery; 
Calls on the OSCE and human rights 
bodies to treat his case as a human 
rights violation; 
Calls on the U.S. Government to 
raise Navalny’s poisoning with Russian 
authorities 
and 
to 
support 
inde-
pendent, impartial, and thorough in-
vestigations by competent authorities;

Calls for the imposition of Magnitsky 
sanctions on those responsible for the 
attack; 
And supports a review of whether the 
poisoning constitutes use of a chemical 
weapon, with sanctions to follow as ap-
propriate. 
This resolution does not punish Ger-
many by calling for the suspension of 
the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Germany is 
an ally. It is the Russian Government 
that is at fault here. 
So I want to thank all the cosponsors 
in the Foreign Affairs Committee for 
supporting this initiative. 
I hope and I pray that the incoming 
Biden administration will make human 
rights the centerpiece of U.S. foreign 
policy going forward. Brave individuals 
like Alexei Navalny deserve far more 
than a passing reference from our gov-
ernment’s leaders. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues 
to support this resolution.

Speaker, I have no further requests for

sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I, again, thank Con-
gressman MCGOVERN for his hard work 
on this resolution. I strongly support 
this measure and urge all the Members 
to do the same. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
ESPAILLAT) that the House suspend the 
rules and agree to the resolution, H. 
Res. 1145, as amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the resolu-
tion, as amended, was agreed to. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

PROHIBITING RUSSIAN 
PARTICIPATION IN G7 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 8259) to prohibit Russian par-
ticipation in the G7, and for other pur-

resentatives; and 
(2) the Committee on Foreign Relations, 
the Select Committee on Intelligence, the

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. ESPAILLAT) and the gen-
tleman from New Jersey (Mr. SMITH) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude in the RECORD extraneous mate-
rials on H.R. 8259. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of this measure, and I thank the au-
thor, my friend, Mr. MEEKS from New 
York, a senior member of the Com-
mittee on Foreign Affairs, for his lead-
ership and hard work. 
Throughout this Congress, the com-
mittee has focused on measures to 
counter Russian aggression and hold 
President Putin accountable for the 
unlawful invasion and attempted an-
nexation of Crimea. But President 
Trump has flagrantly ignored the pleas 
of our allies and attempted to invite 
Russia back into the G7 despite its con-
tinued aggression in Ukraine, Georgia, 
and other sovereign countries near its 
border. 
Putin and his cronies must be held 
accountable for their actions. And for 
Trump to put out the welcome mat for 
Russia would be a slap in the face to 
our allies and the Ukrainian citizens 
living in Crimea. 
This important bipartisan bill would 
prevent the U.S. Government from fa-
cilitating Russian participation in the 
G7, or a reconstituted G8, and requires 
a report about Russia’s nefarious rela-
tionships with the Taliban in Afghani-
stan and any bounty program it insti-
tuted for the killing of American 
troops. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this measure, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
8259, which prohibits Russian participa-
tion in the G7. I thank my friend and 
colleague, Mr. MEEKS, for authoring 
this bill. 
As I have said time and time again, 
Vladimir Putin is not a friend of the 
United States nor of our allies. 
In the past few years, we have wit-
nessed his regime invade and occupy

parts of Ukraine and certainly Georgia 
in South Ossetia and Abkhazia; un-
leash devastating cyberattacks against 
our allies; prop up corrupt regimes in 
Syria and Venezuela; use a banned 
nerve agent to try to kill a former Rus-
sian spy, as we just saw with the reso-
lution that preceded this, opposition 
activist Alexey Navalny; meddle in our 
elections; and much more. 
The 
Russian 
President’s 
actions 
speak for themselves. At almost every 
opportunity, Putin pursues policies 
that undermine American and allied 
interests around the world. 
The Group of Seven is a forum that 
brings together like-minded democ-
racies 
to 
tackle 
important 
global 
issues. A dangerous and corrupt dic-
tator that assassinates his own people 
cannot be trusted to be a reasonable 
partner on the world stage. We must 
not turn a blind eye to this reality. 
This bill would prohibit Russia from 
being readmitted to the Group of Seven 
until Putin fully restores the terri-
torial integrity of Ukraine, parts of 
Georgia, and Moldova, and stops inter-
fering in the democratic processes of 
the United States and our allies. 
The bill also demonstrates that Con-
gress takes very seriously the safety of 
American troops serving overseas—it is 
our utmost priority—and that we re-
main concerned about the challenges 
Russia poses to U.S. and NATO efforts 
to bring peace and stability to Afghani-
stan. 
Maintaining the integrity of the 
Group of Seven is vital to its success. 
Russia cannot be invited back in while 
Vladimir Putin continues to undermine 
the efforts of democratic states to 
build a freer and more prosperous 
world. 
Mr. Speaker, I have no more requests 
for time, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. MEEKS), the author of 
this important bill and an esteemed 
member of the Committee on Foreign 
Affairs. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Mr. ESPAILLAT, and I thank the gen-
tleman from New Jersey (Mr. SMITH). I 
also thank Representative KINZINGER 
for his support and his collaboration in 
working collectively to bring this bill 
to the floor for a vote. 
The reason for this bill is actually 
very simple. Congress must be clear 
that Russia cannot be part of the G7 
while it does all it can to undermine 
democracies, including our own. 
What they are doing is inflaming 
some of the biggest challenges that 
face the global community today. Con-
gress has an oversight responsibility 
here, and this bill simply makes that 
clear. 
Through its actions, today’s Russia 
continues to prove that it does not in-
tend to be a part of the global solution. 
Moscow interferes in democratic proc-
esses across the globe, suppresses and 
poisons opposition, and wreaks havoc 
in 
emerging 
nations 
in 
Europe— 
Ukraine and Georgia being the most re-
cent targets where they still remain, 
holding sovereign land. 
The list is long. Yet, I am concerned 
that the President of the United States 
has repeatedly expressed his inclina-
tion to bring Russia back to the G7. He 
has called it commonsense to include 
Russia. It is not as long as they con-
tinue to behave the way they are. 
It is crucial that the American tax-
payer should not pay for this bizarre 
and harmful courtship of Putin’s Rus-
sia, the same Russia that puts bounties 
on American soldiers in Afghanistan. 
Of course, we should have lines of 
strategic communications open with 
Moscow. I am one also open for dia-
logue. But with Russia’s malfeasance, 
we cannot welcome them to the table 
as our partners and allies at a time 
when they do not share our democratic 
values or interests. 
There 
is 
nothing 
short 
of 
the 
strength of America’s stance as a glob-
al leader at stake. We have to be lead-
ers in bringing folks together and 
standing for democracy and for what is 
good for democracy. That is who we are 
as Americans. That is what this United 
States Congress stands for. 
We must do our oversight in this re-
gard. We must give a message to Rus-
sia that should it want to enter into 
the G7, it has to play by the rules and 
not do undemocratic things or threaten 
democracy, whether it is in the United 
States or any of our European allies. 
Mr. Speaker, I, again, thank my col-
leagues for joining this bill in a bipar-
tisan effort, and I urge my colleagues 
to support this bill. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has the only remaining time. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank 
the distinguished gentleman 
from New York (Mr. ESPAILLAT) for 
yielding, and the distinguished gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. MEEKS) for 
proposing this legislation, along with 
his colleagues, Mr. KINZINGER and all 
the Members who are supporting H.R. 
8259 that deals with the admission of 
Russia into the G7. 
The reason I think this is crucial leg-
islation that I would hope that we 
would move swiftly to the United 
States Senate, the other body, and 
move swiftly for a signature, ulti-
mately, of the President of the United 
States, is because this is a move that 
seems afoot with little consultation of 
the other members of the G7. 
Anyone listening to this, the Amer-
ican people, might be reminded that 
Russia fought against the Nazis. One 
might say they were on the good side 
in World War II. There have been mo-
ments where we have been able to col-
laborate with Russia on important 
issues relevant to all of us, Europe and 
beyond. 
But 
it 
certainly 
is 
dis-
appointing under the leadership of 
their present head of government that 
they have seemingly sought not only 
to quash dissent but to kill dissent. 
Just a few minutes ago, we heard of 
the poisoning of one of the largest dis-
senters in Russia. It has happened be-
fore. It will happen again. 
Is 
the 
G7 
an 
organization 
that 
coddles and comforts those who would 
poison dissent or undermine dissent? 
Or are we a group that may not agree 
all the time but truly believes in 
human rights and the dignity of all 
people and, yes, the understanding that 
dissent is part of the democratic prin-
ciples? I am appalled at the attempt to 
kill dissent. 
Then, of course, you have to be con-
cerned about the absolute, unfettered 
intrusion and caring less about the 
people of Ukraine, Crimea, and cer-
tainly places in surrounding Eastern 
Europe. They are in fear of their lives— 
the shooting down of an innocent com-
mercial airline and the complete denial 
of such. 
Belarus, 
the 
whole 
question 
of 
Moldova, all of these places are subject 
to the whims of Russia. 
Now, if there was a completely dif-
ferent policy, foreign aid, a foreign re-
lations policy of cooperation and col-
laboration, there is certainly the op-
portunity for G7 members to talk with 
Russia in any other forum. But I think 
when we are supporting NATO, we rec-
ognize the importance of that alliance. 
We also understand the strength of 
that alliance, recognizing the impor-
tance of that alliance in Afghanistan 
and, yes, in Iraq. 
To admit, because of a personal rela-
tionship between a head of state and 
Russia’s head of state, I think it is un-
acceptable. 
Let me also say something that is 
strikingly disturbing at this point. 
Yes, the President has the right to hire 
and fire his or her Cabinet. In the last 
4 days or so, the then-existing Sec-
retary of Defense was precipitously 
fired. We don’t have the inner workings 
and decisions of that. Maybe his work 
performance wasn’t up to par. It 
doesn’t seem like that is the case. 
Then, all of a sudden, a new person is 
ultimately an interim Acting Sec-
retary of Defense, one of the most stra-
tegic and important parts of our Na-
tion. 
Having been here through 9/11, there 
was a transition of government. Look 
who struck. Not Russia, of course, but 
Osama bin Laden on 9/11. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentlewoman from Texas. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, 
now we have a circumstance where the 
newly appointed Acting Secretary of 
Defense is saying that our troops will 
be cut in half. 
I understand, the Joint Chiefs, if I 
am correct, have not been consulted or 
they have not made that decision. And

that means, is that opening the door 
more for Russia into Afghanistan and 
Iraq? Is that jeopardizing our troops? 
These are questions that tie into re-
lationships between Russia and now, 
presently, the United States. 
I think we have to make a firm state-
ment against the G7, and I ask that we 
question the decision to withdraw 
troops, not because I have not been 
against the wars, but because I believe 
our troops should be assessed as their 
security and also our mission. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask for the support of 
this legislation. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, again, I thank Con-
gressman MEEKS for his hard work on 
this measure. I am very pleased to sup-
port this important measure, and I 
urge all Members to do the same. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
ESPAILLAT) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 8259, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

CELEBRATING THE 50TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF ENTRY INTO FORCE OF 
TREATY 
ON 
THE 
NON-PRO-
LIFERATION OF NUCLEAR WEAP-
ONS 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and agree to 
the resolution (H. Res. 825) celebrating 
the 50th anniversary of the entry into 
force of the Treaty on the Non-Pro-
liferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), 
recognizing the importance of the 
NPT’s 
continued 
contributions 
to 
United States and international secu-
rity, 
and 
commemorating 
United 
States leadership in strengthening the 
nuclear nonproliferation regime since 
the dawn of the nuclear era, as amend-
ed. 
The Clerk read the title of the resolu-
tion. 
The text of the resolution is as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 825 
Whereas on December 4, 1961, the United 
Nations General Assembly unanimously ap-
proved a resolution supporting an inter-
national agreement to prevent the prolifera-
tion of nuclear weapons; 
Whereas the nonproliferation of nuclear 
weapons has been a bedrock principle of 
United States foreign policy since 1945; 
Whereas the October 1962 Cuban Missile 
Crisis nearly led the United States and the 
former Soviet Union to a catastrophic nu-
clear exchange; 
Whereas the aftermath of the Cuban Mis-
sile Crisis led to a series of bilateral and 
multilateral 
agreements 
to 
reduce 
the 
chances of nuclear war and prevent the 
spread of nuclear weapons; 
Whereas on August 17, 1965, the United 
States submitted its first draft of such a 
treaty to the Eighteen Nation Disarmament 
Committee; 
Whereas in May 1966, the Senate adopted S. 
Res. 179 supporting the President’s efforts to 
negotiate such a treaty; 
Whereas the United States, the United 
Kingdom, and the Union of Soviet Socialist 
Republics signed the Treaty on the Non-Pro-
liferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) on its 
first day of opening for signature on July 1, 
1968; 
Whereas the Senate gave its advice and 
consent to ratification of the NPT on March 
13, 1969, by a vote of 83 to 15; 
Whereas the NPT entered into force on 
March 5, 1970, the date it was ratified by the 
United States and the Soviet Union; 
Whereas the NPT provides stability that is 
critical for United States and international 
security, and its success has and will con-
tinue to depend upon the full implementa-
tion by all State Parties of the NPT’s three 
mutually-reinforcing pillars: nonprolifera-
tion, access to peaceful uses of nuclear en-
ergy, and disarmament; 
Whereas United States leadership has been 
and will continue to be indispensable to the 
development and success of the global nu-
clear nonproliferation regime; 
Whereas on May 11, 1995, the NPT was ex-
tended indefinitely; 
Whereas North Korea is the only non-nu-
clear weapon state that was a party to the 
NPT before acquiring nuclear weapons; 
Whereas the United States has supported 
the NPT’s disarmament goals by negotiating 
bilateral 
arms 
control 
agreements 
and 
achieving dramatic reductions in its own and 
other states’ nuclear weapons stockpiles 
through these treaties, including the 1972 
SALT I Treaty, the 1987 INF Treaty, the 1991 
START I Treaty, the 2002 Moscow Treaty, 
and the 2010 New START treaty; 
Whereas the United States has promoted 
the NPT’s nonproliferation pillar by sup-
porting states that relinquished their nu-
clear weapons and acceded to the NPT, such 
as Belarus, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and South 
Africa; 
Whereas the United States has worked to 
ensure the peaceful uses of nuclear energy by 
supporting the International Atomic Energy 
Agency and its safeguards programs, includ-
ing the Additional Protocol; 
Whereas the 2018 Department of Defense 
Nuclear Posture Review affirms, ‘‘The Nu-
clear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) is a 
cornerstone of the nuclear nonproliferation 
regime. It plays a positive role in building 
consensus for non-proliferation and enhances 
international efforts to impose costs on 
those that would pursue nuclear weapons 
outside the Treaty.’’; 
Whereas on June 28, 2018, the United 
States, United Kingdom, and Russian gov-
ernments released a joint statement, re-
affirming their commitment to work toward 
‘‘the ultimate goal of the elimination of nu-
clear weapons, as set forth in the NPT’’; and 
Whereas Congress has long been a leading 
voice for nonproliferation, including through 
the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945, the 
McMahon Act of 1946, the Atomic Energy 
Act of 1954, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation 
Act of 1978, the Export Administration Act of 
1979, the Nunn-Lugar Soviet Nuclear Threat 
Reduction Act of 1991, the Nuclear Non-
proliferation Prevention Act of 1994, and 
other legislative efforts: Now, therefore, be 
it 
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives— 
(1) calls for continued support for the Trea-
ty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weap-
ons (NPT) to prevent the spread of nuclear 
weapons, to further reduce the number of nu-
clear weapons, and to promote the peaceful 
use of nuclear energy as it has over the past 
50 years; 
(2) reaffirms that a strong nonproliferation 
regime is in the United States interest; 
(3) recognizes that the United States, 
through its network of alliances, has led the 
world upholding the pillars of the NPT and 
continues to work together to strengthen 
the NPT; and 
(4) urges the United States to continue to 
be a leader in supporting the NPT and the 
global nonproliferation regime, by— 
(A) continuing to encourage all States 
Party to the NPT to comply fully with the 
NPT; 
(B) maintaining support for the Inter-
national Atomic Energy Agency through its 
assessed and voluntary contributions and 
promote the universal adoption of the IAEA 
Additional Protocol; 
(C) continuing to encourage opportunities 
for cooperation with other nuclear weapons 
states to reduce the number and role of nu-
clear weapons; 
(D) encouraging universality of the NPT 
and the Additional Protocol; 
(E) discouraging the unlawful spread of 
uranium enrichment technologies and ensur-
ing such technologies covered under the NPT 
are properly verified; 
(F) developing policies to prevent with-
drawal of additional states parties from the 
Treaty; 
(G) maintaining global moratoria on nu-
clear explosive testing, which is in the na-
tional security interest of the United States; 
and 
(H) working towards a successful 2021 NPT 
Review Conference.

ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. ESPAILLAT) and the gen-
tleman from New Jersey (Mr. SMITH)

Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-

objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of this resolution, and I would like to 
thank the author, Congressman SHER-
MAN, for his hard work and leadership. 
Arms control and nonproliferation 
have been bipartisan pillars of United 
States security since the earliest days 
of the Cold War. After a half a century 
of successfully contributing to the non-
proliferation and reduction of nuclear 
weapons, the Treaty on the Non-Pro-
liferation of Nuclear Weapons con-
tinues to bolster the United States na-
tional security and global stability. 
This important resolution recognizes 
the importance of the NPT and calls 
for continued U.S. leadership in global

nonproliferation efforts and the further 
reduction in the number of nuclear 
weapons. The current administration 
has undercut and disregarded our im-
portant arms control regimes, and I 
hope that President-elect Biden will 
immediately change our course after 
he is sworn in. 
With this measure, the House is 
going on record to support a return to 
the leadership and policies that helped 
make the world safer for decades. I 
urge my colleagues to support this res-
olution, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of this resolution marking the 50th an-
niversary of entry into force of the 
Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nu-
clear Weapons. 
I want to thank our distinguished 
colleagues, 
Mr. 
SHERMAN
and 
Mr. 
BANKS, and some of the other cospon-
sors. Mr. SHERMAN took the lead on it, 
and I thank him for that, in marking 
this important anniversary. 
For the last 50 years, the NPT Trea-
ty, Non-Proliferation Treaty, has been 
the bedrock upon which nonprolifera-
tion policy has been built. More than 
185 countries around the world have 
ratified the treaty, adding their sup-
port to the responsible use of nuclear 
technology, while reducing the likeli-
hood of nuclear conflict. 
Every country has the right to use 
nuclear energy for peaceful purposes; 
however, we must ensure that the num-
ber of states armed with nuclear weap-
ons does not grow. The proliferation of 
these weapons in unstable, dangerous 
regimes like North Korea and Iran only 
makes the world more dangerous and 
the use of those weapons of mass de-
struction more likely. 
Under the treaty, nuclear weapons 
states agree not to transfer nuclear 
weapons or technology to nonnuclear 
weapons states. States without nuclear 
weapons are bound to accept IAEA 
safeguards in order to verify any and 
all nuclear activities are peaceful. 
The treaty also requires all countries 
to pursue good faith negotiations re-
lated to nuclear disarmament. There 
may 
be 
disagreement 
on 
how 
to 
achieve such disarmament, but in the 
meantime, the U.S. remains committed 
to continuing to reduce risk and en-
hance global stability through main-
taining a modern, safe, and secure nu-
clear deterrent and reaffirming our de-
fense commitment to our allies. We 
seek to engage countries like China, 
which is growing its nuclear arsenal, 
and Russia, which is developing new 
nuclear armed weapons systems, on en-
hanced arms control regimes. 
Finally, the United States continues 
to seek to prevent the spread of nu-
clear weapons to rogue states. 
Again, I want to thank my friend, the 
gentleman from California (Mr. SHER-
MAN), for sponsoring this bill, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. SHERMAN), the author 
of this important resolution and an es-
teemed member of the Foreign Affairs 
Committee. 
Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
favor of H. Res. 825, which I authored, 
to focus our attention on the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty. 
If you look back to 1945 when nuclear 
weapons literally exploded upon the 
world, most political scientists be-
lieved that within the next century 
after 1945 we would have had dozens of 
nuclear states and many nuclear wars. 
Well, so far, we have gone the vast bulk 
of a century since 1945 and we have not 
seen nuclear weapons used in anger. An 
important part of that is the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty. 
There is no more important work for 
our committee than preventing the 
spread of nuclear weapons. That is 
why, for well over a decade, I have 
chaired or been ranking member on the 
subcommittee that focuses on non-
proliferation. It is simple math. The 
more nuclear states, the more likeli-
hood of a nuclear war. 
This resolution reaffirms the strong 
nonproliferation regime that is in the 
interest of the United States and sup-
ports the Nuclear Non-Proliferation 
Treaty. It urges the United States to 
continue to support the NPT regime 
and global nonproliferation and looks 
forward to a successful 2021 NPT Re-
view Conference. 
I look forward to working with the 
new administration on nonprolifera-
tion issues. 
Every nation in the last 50 years that 
has developed a nuclear weapon has 
done so under the pretense that they 
were developing a nuclear energy pro-
gram. That is why we have to be very 
careful when we enter into nuclear co-
operation agreements with countries 
that may seek to develop a nuclear 
weapon. 
The best way to make sure that a nu-
clear energy program is not a nuclear 
weapons program is to make sure that 
the country that engages in that signs 
the additional protocol to allow the ad-
ditional inspections of the IAEA. That 
is why what is important today—not 
only this resolution—is the conference 
committee that I sit on for the NDAA, 
which contains the provision that I 
wrote and introduced to this House as 
the Saudi Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Act, to say that we will not enter into 
agreements for nuclear cooperation 
with countries that refuse to sign the 
additional protocol. 
As we look forward to a new adminis-
tration, we need to reenter the JCPOA 
with Iran and make sure Iran never de-
velops a nuclear weapon. We have to 
prevent Saudi Arabia from developing 
a nuclear weapon, and we have to roll 
back the North Korean program. There 
is much for us to do in nonprolifera-
tion, and there is no work that is more 
important for our committee. 
Since I have some additional time, I 
would like to use it to express my 
views on the other important legisla-
tion that the Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee is bringing to this House today. 
The first is the Tropical Forest and 
Coral Reef Conservation Reauthoriza-
tion Act of 2020, introduced by Mr. 
CHABOT, for which I serve as the lead 
Democrat. This is an important debt- 
for-nature program critical to preserve 
tropical forests and coral reefs. 
Chairman BERA has introduced the 
Securing 
America 
From 
Epidemics 
Act. This bill recognizes the impor-
tance of working cooperatively—and I 
look forward to us rejoining the WHO— 
working cooperatively to deal with 
epidemics. And, of course, these provi-
sions were part of the Heroes Act, 
which this Congress passed back in 
May. It authorizes the Coalition for 
Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, an 
alliance of countries that are partners 
to finance and coordinate the develop-
ment of vaccines for high-priority epi-
demic threats. 
I want to commend the gentleman 
from New York for his Caribbean Basin 
Security Initiative Authorization Act 
to promote safety, security, and the 
rule of law in the Caribbean. It is so 
important that we achieve improve-
ment for the lives of those who are our 
immediate neighbors. This important 
bill would fund support for the justice 
sector and education for at-risk youth. 
I want to commend Representative 
TOM SUOZZI for his resolution on the 
importance of the United States’ alli-
ance with the Republic of Korea and 
the contribution of Korean Americans. 
Just yesterday, I had a chance to meet 
with the chair and several of the mem-
bers of the Korean National Assembly’s 
Foreign Affairs and Unification Com-
mittee, and I look forward to a new ad-
ministration reaching a different kind 
of relationship with North Korea and a 
stronger 
relationship 
with 
South 
Korea. 
I commend Chairman MCGOVERN for 
his resolution condemning the poi-
soning of Russian opposition leader 
Alexei Navalny and calling for the 
United States to coordinate a robust 
international response. 
I think our committee is bringing to 
the floor of this House a package of im-
portant legislation. I look forward to it 
passing overwhelmingly. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, again, 
I want to thank Congressman SHERMAN 
for his hard work on this measure. I am 
very pleased to support this measure, I 
urge all Members to do the same, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
ESPAILLAT) that the House suspend the 
rules and agree to the resolution, H. 
Res. 825, as amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the resolu-
tion, as amended, was agreed to. 
The title of the resolution was

f 
PARTNERING 
AND 
LEVERAGING 
ASSISTANCE 
TO 
STOP 
TRASH 
FOR INTERNATIONAL CLEANER 
SEAS ACT 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 4636) to authorize the Sec-
retary of State and the Administrator 
of the United States Agency for Inter-
national Development to prioritize and 
advance efforts to improve waste man-
agement systems and prevent and re-
duce plastic waste and marine debris, 
and for other purposes, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4636 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Partnering 
and Leveraging Assistance to Stop Trash for 
International Cleaner Seas Act’’ or the 
‘‘PLASTICS Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Eight million metric tons of plastic 
enter the ocean every year. Marine debris 
damages the health of marine life, impedes 
local economic development, and threatens 
health systems. Ten river systems carry an 
estimated 90 percent of the river-based plas-
tic waste that ends up in the ocean. 
(2) Mismanaged plastic waste has the high-
est risk of contaminating rivers and oceans. 
China contributes the largest share of this 
mismanaged waste, followed by Indonesia, 
the Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand, Egypt, 
Nigeria, and South Africa. The United States 
is the world’s second-largest producer and 
consumer of plastics products, and the top 
exporter of plastic scrap. 
(3) Most marine debris, particularly plas-
tics, enters the oceans from land-based 
sources, mainly in developing countries, that 
lack the capacity to adequately manage 
waste and prevent dumping. 
(4) During the Our Ocean Conference in Oc-
tober 2018, the United States announced as-
sistance to prevent marine debris from en-
tering the ocean through development of 
waste management systems and reduce plas-
tics in marine protected areas in the Indo- 
Pacific. 
(5) During the June 2019 G20 Summit in 
Osaka, Japan, the United States joined other 
G20 members in endorsing the ‘‘Osaka Blue 
Ocean Vision’’ to reduce additional pollution 
by marine plastic litter to zero by 2050 and 
the G20 Implementation Framework for Ac-
tions on Marine Plastic Litter, which out-
lines a commitment to prevent and reduce 
plastic debris in the oceans through waste 
management and clean-up efforts to remove 
marine plastic debris and prioritizes efforts 
to advance innovative solutions and inter-
national cooperation to support such initia-
tives. 
SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
It is the policy of the United States to con-
sult, partner, and coordinate with the gov-
ernments of foreign countries, international 
organizations, private and civil society enti-
ties, and other stakeholders in a concerted 
effort to— 
(1) prevent and reduce marine debris and 
plastic waste, including through reduced 
consumption, greater transparency in global 
trade of plastic waste, and support for inte-
grated waste management systems in devel-
oping countries; 
(2) advance innovative market-based solu-
tions and catalyze private capital to prevent 
and reduce marine debris and plastic waste, 
support integrated waste management sys-
tems, and improve market demand for recy-
cled material; 
(3) build the capacity of national and sub-
national governments in other countries to 
develop and implement integrated waste 
management systems, measure and report 
progress in reducing plastic waste, and pre-
vent plastic waste from entering rivers and 
oceans; 
(4) support local economic development 
through programs that assist community 
members, particularly women, youth, and 
marginalized populations, to derive eco-
nomic benefit from waste products and par-
ticipation in waste management systems; 
and 
(5) engage in international and regional co-
operation to prevent and reduce marine de-
bris and plastic waste, share best practices, 
and empower national and subnational gov-
ernments, local communities, civil society, 
and the private sector to engage in such ef-
forts. 
SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
It is the sense of Congress that, in pursuing 
the policy described in section 3, the Presi-
dent should direct United States representa-
tives to appropriate international bodies to 
use the voice, vote, and influence of the 
United States to advocate support for the 
following: 
(1) Efforts to improve transparency in 
global trade of plastic waste, improve plastic 
waste regulation to ensure the safety of hu-
mans and the environment, strengthen inte-
grated waste management systems, and pre-
vent, reduce, reuse, and recycle plastic 
waste, to the extent practical. 
(2) Collaborative approaches to establish 
measurable targets and objectives, with re-
lated action plans, for reducing marine de-
bris and plastic waste from all sources and 
sharing best practices in waste prevention 
and management systems to prevent plastic 
waste.

SEC. 6. PLASTIC WASTE REDUCTION INITIATIVE. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—The Chief Executive Offi-
cer of the United States International Devel-
opment Finance Corporation is authorized to 
establish, in coordination with relevant Fed-
eral departments and agencies and incor-
porating any existing programs of the Cor-

pursue investment opportunities to address 
plastic waste pollution and support im-
proved, integrated waste management sys-
tems in developing countries, including by 
catalyzing global public and private-sector 
investments to prevent and reduce marine 
debris and plastic waste in such countries. 
(b) REFERENCE.—The initiative established 
under subsection (a) may be referred to as 
the ‘‘Plastic Waste Reduction Initiative’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. ESPAILLAT) and the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 4636. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my 
friend, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
MCCAUL), the ranking member of the 
Foreign Affairs Committee, for his 
hard work on this measure, which I am 
pleased to support. 
This bill aims to address a growing 
problem we all see around the world: 
plastic waste and other debris in our 
oceans. 
Products made from plastic are a 
part of everyday life. In the morning, 
we brush our teeth with a plastic 
toothbrush and wash our hair with 
shampoo from a plastic bottle. We 
drink water from a plastic cup, eat 
snacks out of plastic containers, and 
consume meals with plastic utensils. 
We drive cars with plastic components 
and do our work on plastic keyboards. 
At the end of the day, when we throw 
plastic away, we don’t often think 
about where it ends up. 
Well, every day, more than 8 million 
metric tons of it end up in the ocean, 
leading to a host of problems. It dam-
ages the health of marine life, chokes 
off economic development, and harms 
the environment. 
Most marine debris enters the ocean 
from land-based sources, mainly in de-
veloping countries that aren’t able to 
manage waste and prevent dumping. 
This legislation will advance efforts 
to work with national governments 
and local communities to develop inte-
grated waste management systems to 
effectively prevent and reduce plastic 
waste. 
It encourages Federal departments 
and agencies to work with the private 
sector and nongovernmental organiza-
tions, aiming to leverage public and 
private capital in concert with Amer-
ican assistance programs. 
It supports local economic develop-
ment initiatives to assist community 
members—particularly women, young 
people, and marginalized populations— 
to realize the economic benefits to be 
gained in scaling up waste manage-
ment systems. 
It also urges U.S. leadership in inter-
national and regional efforts to prevent 
and reduce marine debris and plastic 
waste. This legislation supports the 
commitment that the United States 
made at both the 2018 Our Ocean Con-
ference and the 2019 G20 Summit to 
achieve measurable benchmarks in pre-
venting marine debris from entering 
the ocean and reduce plastic pollution. 
The United States is one of the 
world’s largest producer and consumer 
of plastic products, and the top ex-
porter of plastic scrap. So we have a 
critical role to play in addressing this 
particular issue. This legislation puts 
us on the right track to remedy this 
rapidly growing problem. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support 
this legislation, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
b 1500 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman 
from New York and Chairman ENGEL 
for their support. 
Mr. Speaker, over 8 million metric 
tons of plastic enters the oceans each 
year. That is the equivalent of a gar-
bage truck full of plastic being dumped 
out every single minute. 
According to the United Nations En-
vironment Program, if no change is en-
acted, our oceans could contain more 
plastic bags than fish by 2050. 
Mismanaged plastic waste in our 
oceans and communities can take cen-
turies to decompose. That threatens 
economic development, hurts marine 
life, and threatens health systems 
around the world. Reversing the trend 
of increased plastic waste in our oceans 
will require a coordinated global re-
sponse. 
It is important to note that just 10 
river systems carry an estimated 90 
percent of river-based plastic waste to 
the ocean. China contributes the larg-
est share of this mismanaged waste, 
followed by developing countries, such 
as Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, 
and Vietnam. 
That is why Chairman ENGEL and I 
introduced the PLASTICS Act. This 
legislation elevates the United States 
to a leadership role in international ef-
forts to reduce and safely manage plas-
tic waste. 
The PLASTICS Act will allow Amer-
ica to do more to help build the capac-
ity of developing countries to manage 
their waste. And it will help prevent 
more waste from spilling into the 
ocean on the scale that it is today. 
The PLASTICS Act elevates ongoing 
efforts by USAID, and it prioritizes 
new partnerships between the private 
sector and the U.S. Development Fi-
nance Corporation. This will allow us 
to leverage additional financing for 
companies putting these waste man-
agement practices into place in the 
Indo-Pacific and elsewhere. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that yes-
terday the United States Development 
Finance Corporation announced its 
Ocean Plastics Initiative, based on this 
bill, and it is exactly what this bill 
calls for. This initiative aims to cata-
lyze $2.5 billion in the private sector 
infrastructure investments aimed at 
reducing plastic waste and marine de-
bris. 
By elevating the role of women and 
marginalized populations in these ini-
tiatives, we can spur economic develop-
ment and opportunity across the globe. 
Our work to combat plastic waste is an 
investment in the health of our oceans 
and our communities, not just for our-
selves, but also for future generations. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from New York 
for his leadership, and I also rise in en-
thusiastic support for the PLASTICS 
Act of Mr. MCCAUL and Mr. ENGEL. 
Texas is a Gulf State. Before we even 
get to the ocean, we can see the impact 
of plastic even in our area. To hear the 
stark report that more plastic than 
fish in 2050, I ask the question: What do 
we leave for our children? 
I think this legislation has a very im-
portant and strategic point to combine 
public and private partnership, to ac-
knowledge the devastation of plastic, 
and to be able, in essence, to save the 
Earth. 
Mr. Speaker, for a moment, I want to 
allude also to the nonproliferation leg-
islation that we just discussed and to 
join in support of the dire conditions 
and dire straits that the Nation and 
the world will be in if we allow the pro-
liferation of nuclear abilities. 
It is very important that we contain 
those nuclear abilities. We have been 
on the floor today discussing Russia 
and its poisoning of dissidents, its in-
trusion into its neighbors. And we un-
derstand that the reckless use of nu-
clear materials really pose a danger to 
our children and our children’s chil-
dren. It is for that reason that I believe 
that we must continue fighting for nu-
clear nonproliferation. 
As a member of the European Par-
liamentary Exchange and many other 
groups discussing this, I believe this is 
an important and ongoing responsi-
bility, along with the PLASTICS Act, 
it is intended to make our world safer 
and better for all. That is a commit-
ment that we, as the Members of the 
United States Congress, should take 
extremely seriously, and I think it will 
be we who will stand in the gap to show

the world what America’s true values 
really are. We care about the environ-
ment and we care to keep the world 
safe from nuclear proliferation. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman 
for yielding. I thank the sponsor and 
the cosponsor of the legislation. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I am pre-
pared to close if the gentleman from 
New York has no further speakers. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time 
as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, in closing, as my col-
leagues and I have been speaking on 
this bill for the last 10 minutes, over 
300,000 pounds of plastic has entered 
our oceans. It is amazing to think 
about that, just in the 10 minutes we 
have been speaking here today. 
Reversing this trend and preventing 
plastic from choking our oceans will 
require this coordinated global re-
sponse that is both practical, innova-
tive, measurable, and, quite frankly, it 
is the right thing to do for our future 
generations. 
With the PLASTICS Act, we will be 
taking a huge large step in that direc-
tion. We have a duty to protect future 
generations from the repercussions of 
today’s waste. I also strongly support 
ongoing efforts to ensure final passage 
of Save Our Seas 2.0 Act, which in-
cludes components of this legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues 
on both sides of the aisle for their 
great bipartisan work. I also thank my 
dear chairman, ELIOT ENGEL, and the 
gentleman from New York. Chairman 
ENGEL has been a dear friend of mine in 
this Congress. We are going to be sad 
to see him go, but I know he has bright 
aspirations for his future, and we look 
forward to celebrating with him. And 
one way we can celebrate this is by 
passing the PLASTICS Act. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, 
first of all, I thank the manager and 
the sponsor of this legislation for their 
kind courtesies. 
Mr. Speaker, it is never too late to 
say ‘‘thank you,’’ and I wanted to just 
not forget to thank Chairman ENGEL 
for the years of commitment to these 
issues and to his service on the Foreign 
Affairs and the Energy and Commerce 
Committees. 
I know this list of legislative initia-
tives has had the impact of our man-
ager, the distinguished gentleman from 
New York, and certainly all of the 
friends and the ranking member of the 
Foreign Affairs Committee. But I think 
it is appropriate, having known Mr. 
ENGEL for a very long time, that he is 
a true believer in democracy, he is a 
believer in the international respon-
sibilities of the United States, and he 
is also one who recognizes transition of 
government in the right way. He is 
transitioning, and he is doing it with 
dignity and respect. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to express to 
him my deepest respect for his service 
to not only the United States Congress 
and his family’s sacrifice, but to the 
United States of America. We thank 
him for that service. It is my desire to 
have that in the RECORD at this time. I 
thank him on behalf of this Nation. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, this legislation is a 
great example of how America can lead 
in finding solutions to environmental 
challenges such as this one, a grave 
challenge to the world, and helps to 
create jobs and builds prosperity. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support 
it, and I am grateful that Mr. MCCAUL 
and all the bill’s cosponsors have put 
this forward. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
ESPAILLAT) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4636, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
AMERICAN 
VALUES 
AND 
SECU-
RITY IN INTERNATIONAL ATH-
LETICS ACT 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 8405) to direct the Depart-
ment of State to ensure persons rep-
resenting the United States in inter-
national athletic competitions in cer-
tain countries are appropriately in-
formed, and for other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 8405 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘American 
Values and Security in International Ath-
letics Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) In 2017, the International Olympic Com-
mittee (IOC) revised its Host City Contract 
to require host countries to ‘‘protect and re-
spect human rights and ensure any violation 
of human rights is remedied in a manner 
consistent with international agreements, 
laws, and regulations applicable in the Host 
Country and in a manner consistent with all 
internationally 
recognised 
human 
rights 
standards 
and 
principles, 
including 
the 
United Nations Guiding Principles on Busi-
ness and Human Rights, applicable in the 
Host Country’’. 
(2) The Olympic Charter states the goal of 
Olympism is ‘‘to place sport at the service of 
the harmonious development of humankind, 
with a view to promoting a peaceful society 
concerned with the preservation of human 
dignity’’. 
(3) The IOC set up an advisory committee 
on human rights in December 2018, and IOC 
President Thomas Bach said, ‘‘Promoting 
humanistic values in sport has been a core 
feature of the IOC since its beginning. Our 
mission, to put sport at the service of hu-
manity, goes hand-in-hand with human 
rights, which is part of our DNA.’’. 
(4) In the report, ‘‘The Cybersecurity of 
Olympic Sports: New Opportunities, New 
Risks’’, the UC Berkley Center for Long- 
Term Cybersecurity listed the ‘‘hacking and 
release of sensitive athletic data’’ as one of 
the 
four 
significant 
categories 
of 
cyberattacks on major sporting events. 
(5) According to the State Department’s 
2019 Country Reports on Human Rights Prac-
tices, the People’s Republic of China’s Min-
istry of Public Security employs ‘‘tens of 
millions of surveillance cameras’’ to monitor 
the general public, as well as ‘‘political dis-
sidents, religious leaders and adherents, Ti-
betans, and Uyghurs’’. 
(6) The People’s Republic of China (PRC) 
Government’s extensive use of artificial in-
telligence surveillance technology, including 
facial and voice pattern recognition tech-
nology, poses grave humanitarian, privacy, 
and security concerns. PRC authorities have 
used surveillance technology to monitor, 
control, and repress an estimated 1.8 million 
Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in the 
Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. PRC 
State media has confirmed that ‘‘voice, 
image, position and behavior recognition 
technologies’’ will be used in the Beijing 2022 
Winter Olympics.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. ESPAILLAT) and the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on H.R. 8405. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, let me commend Mr. 
MCCAUL, our ranking member of the 
Foreign Affairs Committee, for author-
ing this bill. We know that people-to- 
people connections are a great way to 
build bridges of friendship and under-
standing between countries, and that 
international sports have long provided 
the best example for those connections. 
Yet, even as we put serious dif-
ferences aside to see major sporting 
events go forward, we cannot ignore 
the fact that some governments simply 
don’t respect basic human rights, and 
may seek to violate the privacy of our 
athletes 
by 
collecting 
information 
about them without their knowledge or 
consent. 
We think about China hosting the up-
coming Winter Olympics. We will be 
sending our athletes to a country 
where the government conducts mass 
surveillance and abuses the human 
rights of its own citizens. Our athletes 
have the right to know about their se-
curity concerns, and about how best to 
keep themselves and their privacy se-
cure. 
This legislation will require the 
State Department to develop a strat-
egy to better support our athletes. We 
want to make sure that they under-
stand the security and human rights 
situations in the countries where they 
compete and can take the best steps to 
protect themselves. It is a common-
sense bill, and I am glad to support it. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman 
from New York for his support, and 
Chairman ENGEL, once again. The 2008 
Beijing Summer Olympics were a tri-
umph for the China Communist Party 
and a significant blow for human 
rights. 
While the CCP aired lavish television 
spectacles for the world to see, they 
were evicting people from their homes, 
arresting activists, and harassing for-
eign journalists. Now, 12 years later, 
human rights abuses have only esca-
lated in China. 
The CCP is currently oppressing any-
where from 1 to 3 million ethic minori-
ties in Xinjiang. These prison camps 
are described as oppressive with harsh 
labor conditions, brainwashing, and 
even forced sterilizations and abor-
tions. The Department of Defense has 
compared 
them 
to 
concentration 
camps. 
At the same time, the CCP continues 
to crack down on the people of Hong 
Kong for simply asking for the free-
doms they were promised. And we 
should never forget the role the CCP 
played in the COVID–19 pandemic. In 
an attempt to hide the truth from the 
world and cover up their own culpa-
bility in allowing what could have been 
a regional epidemic, they allowed it to 
turn into a global pandemic. The CCP 
destroyed lab samples and threatened 
and arrested doctors and journalists 
who were simply just trying to report 
the truth. 
However, even with all this hap-
pening, Beijing is still set to host the 
2022 Winter Olympics. Unfortunately, 
the International Olympic Committee 
has shown their lack of concern for the 
CCP’s escalating human rights viola-
tions, whether it be the Uighur Mus-
lims, the Tibetan monks or the Chris-
tian population. 
b 1515 
They are even refusing to discuss 
moving the games and have refused to 
use the upcoming games to simply put 
pressure on the CCP to stop their at-
tacks on human rights. 
Just like they did in 2008, the CCP 
will try to use games, including Amer-
ican athletes, to whitewash their his-
tory and improve their image. 
Today, there is no structure to pre-
pare our athletic delegations for this 
threat. 
That is why Chairman ENGEL and I 
introduced the American Values and 
Security in International Athletics 
Act. 
This bipartisan bill would direct the 
State Department to establish a brief-
ing program on human rights viola-
tions and personal privacy concerns 
American athletes will face in coun-
tries that denigrate human rights, like 
China. 
So when we send our American ath-
letes to represent us in authoritarian 
countries that flagrantly abuse human 
rights, those athletes deserve to know 
exactly what is happening. Then they 
can make an informed decision about 
their own participation, particularly as 
we prepare for the 2022 games. 
Mr. Speaker, this is the 40th anniver-
sary of the United States boycott on 
the Moscow Olympics. 
At that time, in support of President 
Carter’s boycott against the Soviet 
Union, famous sports journalist How-
ard Cosell said: 
It seemed absolutely wrong to me to let 
the Soviet Union use our athletes and our 
technology capabilities to broadcast their 
perverse propaganda to every corner of the 
globe. 
I agree with Howard Cosell. 
Mr. Speaker, we need to come to-
gether again to raise awareness for the 
next winter Olympics in China. 
Silence is not an option. And this bi-
partisan bill is an important step to 
ensure the United States Olympians, 
many of whom are icons and adored by 
our children as role models, to make 
sure that they are educated about 
where they are competing when they 
go abroad to China. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I, 
again, thank Mr. MCCAUL for his bipar-
tisan leadership on this matter. I urge 
a ‘‘yes’’ vote, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, hosting the Olympics is 
an honor that indicates the host coun-
try’s legitimacy on the world stage, 
but unfortunately, this honor has been 
handed to governments who misuse it 
time and again. 
We cannot let the Olympic games be-
come a tool for corrupt and malign 
governments to conceal their behavior 
and portray themselves in a positive 
light. We know that the CCP will use 
international 
participation 
in 
the 
Olympics to normalize its atrocities. 
They have done it once before. 
At the very least, we should ensure 
that American athletes have the oppor-
tunity to at least be informed and to 
protect themselves and their personal 
privacy. 
We have all traveled, as Members of 
Congress, across the globe to oppres-
sive governments. Many of us have 
been under surveillance in hostile gov-
ernments like Russia and China and 
other countries. This bill simply allows

OF 2020 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 8438) to reauthorize the 
Belarus Democracy Act of 2004, as 
amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 8438 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Belarus De-
mocracy, Human Rights, and Sovereignty 
Act of 2020’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Section 2 of the Belarus Democracy Act of 
2004 (Public Law 109–480; 22 U.S.C. 5811 note) 
is amended to read as follows: 
‘‘SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
‘‘Congress finds the following: 
‘‘(1) The Government of Belarus, led by 
Alyaksandr Lukashenka, continues to en-
gage in a pattern of clear and persistent vio-
lations of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms. 
‘‘(2) The Government of Belarus, led by 
Alyaksandr Lukashenka, continues to en-
gage in a pattern of clear and uncorrected 
violations of basic principles of democratic 
governance, including through a series of 
fundamentally flawed presidential and par-
liamentary elections undermining the legit-
imacy of executive and legislative authority 
in that country. 
‘‘(3) The Government of Belarus, led by 
Alyaksandr Lukashenka, continues to sub-
ject thousands of pro-democracy political ac-
tivists and peaceful protesters to harass-
ment, beatings, and imprisonment, particu-
larly as a result of their attempts to peace-
fully exercise their right to freedom of as-
sembly and association. 
‘‘(4) The Government of Belarus, led by 
Alyaksandr Lukashenka, continues to sup-
press independent media and journalists and 
to restrict access to the internet, including 
social media and other digital communica-
tion platforms, in violation of the right to 
freedom of speech and expression of those 
dissenting 
from 
the 
dictatorship 
of 
Alyaksandr Lukashenka. 
‘‘(5) The Government of Belarus, led by 
Alyaksandr Lukashenka, continues a sys-
tematic campaign of harassment, repression, 
and closure of nongovernmental organiza-
tions, including independent trade unions 
and entrepreneurs, creating a climate of fear 
that inhibits the development of civil soci-
ety and social solidarity. 
‘‘(6) The Government of Belarus, led by 
Alyaksandr Lukashenka, has pursued a pol-
icy undermining the country’s sovereignty 
and independence by making Belarus polit-
ical, economic, cultural, and societal inter-
ests subservient to those of Russia. 
‘‘(7) The Government of Belarus, led by 
Alyaksandr Lukashenka, continues to re-
duce the independence of Belarus through in-
tegration into a so-called ‘Union State’ that 
is under the control of Russia. 
‘‘(8) On August 9, 2020, the Government of 
Belarus conducted a presidential election 
that was fraudulent and did not meet inter-
national standards. There were serious irreg-
ularities with ballot counting and the re-
porting of election results. The Government 
of Belarus also put in place restrictive meas-
ures that impeded the work of local inde-
pendent observers and did not provide suffi-
cient notice to the OSCE to allow for the 
OSCE to monitor the elections, as is cus-
tomary. 
‘‘(9) After the August 9, 2020, presidential 
election, the Government of Belarus re-
sponded to the peaceful opposition protests, 
which are the largest in Belarus history, 
with a violent crackdown, including, accord-
ing 
to 
the 
United 
Nations 
Special 
Rapporteur, the detention of more than 
10,000 peaceful protestors as of September 18, 
2020. 
‘‘(10) 
Thousands 
of 
employees 
at 
Belarusian 
state-owned 
enterprises, 
who 
have been seen as Alyaksandr Lukashenka’s 
traditional base during his 26-year rule, went 
on strike across the country to protest 
Lukashenka’s illegitimate election and the 
subsequent crackdowns, including at some of 
Belarus’s largest factories such as the BelAZ 
truck plant, the Minsk Tractor Works, and 
the Minsk Automobile Plant. 
‘‘(11) Women have served as the leading 
force in demonstrations across the country, 
protesting the police brutality and mass de-
tentions by wearing white, carrying flowers, 
forming ‘solidarity chains’, and unmasking 
undercover police trying to arrest dem-
onstrators. 
‘‘(12) After the August 9, 2020, presidential 
election, the Government of Belarus has 
sought to stop the work of the Coordination 
Council, which was formed by the leading op-
position presidential candidate, Sviatlana 
Tsikhanouskaya, to facilitate a peaceful 
transition of power by subjecting the Coun-
cil’s senior members to violence, detention, 
and forced exile. 
‘‘(13) After the August 9, 2020, presidential 
election, the Government of Belarus re-
stricted the free flow of information to si-
lence the opposition and to conceal the re-
gime’s 
violent 
crackdown 
on 
peaceful 
protestors, including by stripping the accred-
itation of journalists from major foreign 
news outlets, disrupting internet access, lim-
iting access to social media and other digital 
communication platforms, and detaining and 
harassing countless journalists. 
‘‘(14) Before the European Parliament on 
August 25, 2020, Tsikhanouskaya stressed 
that a ‘peaceful revolution’ was underway in 
Belarus, and that ‘It is neither a pro-Russian 
nor anti-Russian revolution. It is neither an 
anti-European Union nor a pro-European 
Union revolution. It is a democratic revolu-
tion.’. 
‘‘(15) Against the will of the majority of 
the Belarusian people, Russian President 
Vladimir 
Putin 
has 
propped 
up 
the 
Alyaksandr Lukashenka regime, including 
by offering security assistance, providing 
significant financial support, and sending 
Russian propagandists to help disseminate 
pro-regime propaganda on Belarus state tele-
vision. 
‘‘(16) After the August 9, 2020, presidential 
election, the United States, the European 
Union, the United Kingdom, and Canada con-
demned the violent crackdown on peaceful 
protestors, refused to accept the results of 
the fraudulent election and called for new 
free and fair elections under independent ob-
servation. 
‘‘(17) On September 8, 2020, Secretary of 
State Michael R. Pompeo said, ‘The United 
States, in coordination with our partners 
and Allies, is considering additional targeted 
sanctions to promote accountability for 
those involved in human rights abuses and 
repression in Belarus.’. 
‘‘(18) Following Alyaksandr Lukashenka’s 
September 23, 2020, secret inauguration, the 
United States, the European Union, numer-
ous European Union member states, the 
United Kingdom, and Canada announced 
they did not recognize him as the legiti-
mately elected leader of Belarus.’’. 
SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
Section 3 of the Belarus Democracy Act of 
2004 (Public Law 109–480; 22 U.S.C. 5811 note) 
is amended to read as follows: 
‘‘SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
‘‘It is the policy of the United States to— 
‘‘(1) condemn the conduct of the August 9, 
2020, presidential election and crackdown on 
opposition candidates, senior members of the 
Coordination Council, peaceful protestors, 
employees from state-owned enterprises par-
ticipating in strikes, independent election 
observers, and independent journalists and 
bloggers; 
‘‘(2) continue to call for the immediate re-
lease without preconditions of all political 
prisoners in Belarus, including all those indi-
viduals detained in connection with the Au-
gust 9, 2020, presidential election, a leading 
opposition figure Maryia Kalesnikava, and 
United States citizen Vitali Shkliarov; 
‘‘(3) continue to support the aspirations of 
the people of Belarus for democracy, human 
rights, and the rule of law; 
‘‘(4) continue to support the aspirations of 
the people of Belarus to exercise their reli-
gion freely, including the head of the Catho-
lic Church in Belarus Archbishop Tadeusz 
Kondrusiewicz who was barred from entering 
the country after criticizing Belarusian au-
thorities; 
‘‘(5) continue to support actively the aspi-
rations of the people of the Republic of 
Belarus to preserve the independence and 
sovereignty of their country; 
‘‘(6) not to recognize any incorporation of 
Belarus into a ‘Union State’ with Russia, as 
this so-called ‘Union State’ would be both an 
attempt to absorb Belarus and a step to re-
constituting the totalitarian Soviet Union; 
‘‘(7) continue to reject the results of the 
fraudulent August 9, 2020, presidential elec-
tion in Belarus, and to support calls for new 
presidential and parliamentary elections, 
conducted in a manner that is free and fair 
according to OSCE standards and under the 
supervision of OSCE observers and inde-
pendent domestic observers;

er of Belarus;

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I ask

clude extraneous material on H.R. 8438. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-

illegit-
imate regime continues his brutal 
crackdown on the peaceful protesters 
of that country that have taken to the 
streets in historic numbers to protest 
the elections he stole back on August 
9, 2020. It was the right thing to do 
when the United States, Canada, the 
United Kingdom, and the EU worked 
together to impose sanctions of those 
responsible. But the people of Belarus 
still need our help. 
This bipartisan bill makes clear that 
Congress 
will 
stand 
with 
the 
Belarusian people and against their op-
pressors, and that they will support

their long-term goals of building a 
freer, more democratic, and more west-
ern-facing Belarus. To support the citi-
zens of that country, this bill author-
izes assistance to promote democracy, 
human rights, and civil society. It also 
calls on the administration to ramp up 
our assistance efforts. 
And for those trying to stifle the 
democratic 
aspiration 
of 
the 
Belarusian people, this bill imposes 
stiff new consequences. It expands the 
list 
of 
Belarusian 
authorities 
and 
complicit Russian officials who may be 
targeted by U.S. sanctions. 
This bill is more than just words of 
support. It would make a real dif-
ference for the people of Belarus as 
they strive to build a better future for 
themselves and their country. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
supporting this legislation, and I re-
serve the balance of my time.

has no objection to your including them in 
the bill for consideration on the House floor, 
and to expedite that consideration is willing 
to forgo action on H.R. 8438, with the under-
standing that we do not thereby waive any 
future jurisdictional claim over those provi-
sions or their subject matters. 
In the event a House-Senate conference on 
this or similar legislation is convened, the 
Judiciary Committee reserves the right to 
request an appropriate number of conferees 
to address any concerns with these or simi-
lar provisions that may arise in conference. 
Please place this letter into the Congres-
sional Record during consideration of the 
measure on the House floor. Thank you for 
the cooperative spirit in which you have 
worked regarding this matter and others be-
tween our committees. 
Sincerely, 
JERROLD NADLER, 
Chairman. 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 8438, the Belarus Democracy, 
Human Rights, and Sovereignty Act. 
I greatly appreciate Representative 
CHRIS SMITH of New Jersey for cham-
pioning this bill. He is so well known 
as a visionary for freedom around the 
world. I am also proud to join him 
along with my dear friend, Chairman 
ELIOT ENGEL, who has been such a val-
ued champion of democracy and with 
whom I had the rare opportunity to 
visit Pyongyang in North Korea. Join-
ing us are Representatives KAPTUR, 
KINZINGER, and KEATING as original co-
sponsors of this important bipartisan 
piece of legislation. 
There is no question that Alexander 
Lukashenko rigged the presidential 
election in Belarus this past August. 
Since then, despite the terror in-
flicted upon them by the Lukashenko 
regime, the Belarusian people have 
continued to peacefully protest in his-
toric numbers. And their calls for new 
free and fair elections are only getting 
louder. Their courage is truly inspir-
ing. 
The Belarusian people know that a 
legitimate leader does not need to use 
violence, arbitrary detention, or tor-
ture to cling to power. 
They know that a legitimate leader 
does not need to curtail freedom of ex-
pression and the right to peaceful as-
sembly to silent dissenting views 
And they know that a legitimate 
leader does not need to block inde-
pendent media, disrupt internet access, 
and expel and detain countless journal-
ists to conceal the true scale of opposi-
tion to his rule. 
It is far past time Lukashenko comes 
to understand this as well. 
This bill reaffirms that it is the U.S. 
policy 
to 
refuse 
to 
recognize 
Lukashenko as the legitimate leader of 
Belarus. It also aims to assist the 
Belarusian people in regaining their 
freedom and restoring the country’s in-
stitutions of democratic governments. 
Moreover, we know that Vladimir 
Putin fears democratic movements ris-
ing up against fellow dictators in his 
backyard. Any Russian move to under-
mine the will of the Belarusian people 
or the country’s independence must be 
met with severe consequences. 
That is why this legislation provides 
the President with the necessary tools 
to hold accountable not only the 
Belarusian authorities responsible for 
the violent crackdown but also their 
Russian backers. 
This bill will create the necessary 
conditions to allow the Belarusian peo-
ple to chart their own future. As such, 
I urge all Members to join me in sup-
porting its passage. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5919 
November 18, 2020 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield as much time as he 
may consume to the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. SMITH), the very cou-
rageous sponsor of this bill. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my good friend for 
yielding. I thank Mr. WILSON for his 
great work, and I want to thank my 
distinguished colleagues on both sides 
of the aisle, ELIOT ENGEL and MICHAEL 
MCCAUL. Thank you for your support 
in helping to get this legislation to the 
floor. I thank Chairman KEATING, as 
well. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge swift enactment 
into law of this bipartisan bill called 
the Belarus Democracy Human Rights 
and Sovereignty Act of 2020, which I 
have introduced. 
And here is why this legislation is 
absolutely needed right now; not next 
year, not when we come back, hope-
fully the Senate will take it up if it 
passes today, and I think it will, but we 
need this right now. 
Many of my colleagues know, and 
perhaps 
they 
know 
it 
well, 
that 
Belarus was perhaps the nation most 
mired in the Soviet past, with an inef-
ficient economy and a strongman auto-
crat, really a dictator, in charge for 
over two and a half decades, Alexander 
Lukashenko. Yet the indomitable spir-
it of freedom stirred among the people 
of Belarus, and when a patently false 
election—another one—was announced 
on August 9 declaring Lukashenko the 
winner, the people took to the streets. 
And they are still on the streets today. 
The OSCE Moscow Mechanism re-
ported November 5 that there is ‘‘’over-
whelming’ evidence that Belarus’ Au-
gust 9 presidential election results 
were 
falsified 
and 
as 
‘systematic’ 
human rights violations have been 
committed by the country’s security 
forces in response to the peaceful dem-
onstrations that the vote sparked.’’ 
Now, reports out of Belarus indicate 
that police are using increasingly vio-
lent tactics against these peaceful pro-
testers. 
The BBC summed it up yesterday in 
an article titled, ‘‘Belarus protesters 
battered, bruised, but defiant after 100 
days,’’ which said in part, ‘‘opposition 
protesters remain defiant in Belarus 
despite police brutality, 100 days after 
they first took to the streets to de-
nounce the reelection of President 
Alexander Lukashenko. Police in hel-
mets and body armour throw women 
holding flowers and balloons into po-
lice vans.’’ 
And, of course, then it only gets 
worse. ‘‘Officers tear-gas elderly people 
on a pensioners’ march. . . . 
‘‘Yet every Sunday thousands still 
pour into the streets of the capital 
Minsk, condemning what they see as 
Mr. Lukashenko’s fraudulent 9 August 
victory. . . . ‘’ 
There is a report that points out, 
again a BBC report, ‘‘Alesya, a 31-year- 
old worker in the IT industry, regu-
larly attends the Sunday rallies. On 15 
November, 
however, 
things 
turned 
nasty very quickly. 
‘‘When she arrived at the square,’’ 
she said, ‘‘where the march was sup-
posed to start, it was already packed 
with security forces. As more people 
gathered, officers fired stun grenades 
and started hitting people with batons 
to disperse the crowd. 
‘‘They attacked us again and again. 
It was awful. They ferociously beat 
people, twisted their arms and took 
them away. 
‘‘She ran away into one of the court-
yards following other protesters, but 
police 
in 
their 
minivans 
quickly 
caught up with them even there. She 
was saved,’’ she goes on, ‘‘by a stranger 
who hid her and several others in his 
house.’’ 
b 1530 
She goes on to say, ‘‘It was like 
World War II, when people tried to hide 
Jews from the Nazis. It was terrifying, 
we were shocked.’’ 
That particular march was called in 
memory of Roman Bondarenko, an ac-
tivist who was so severely beaten while 
in detention, that he died in the hos-
pital just last week. 
Mr. Speaker, the Congress can and 
we must do our part in this crisis. The 
people of Belarus, especially the pro- 
democracy leaders, desperately need 
our help, and they need it right now. 
As my colleagues know, the leading 
opposition 
presidential 
candidate, 
Svetlana Tsikhanouskaya, almost cer-
tainly won the election in August. She 
went on to form the Coordination 
Council. 
The democratic opposition is united, 
it is smart, it is principled, tenacious, 
and it is extraordinarily brave. 
Ms. Tsikhanouskaya ran a coura-
geous campaign, but today is in exile 
in Lithuania, in Vilnius, where she 
continues to rally the Belarusian peo-
ple and the world and demand that de-
mocracy and human rights for all peo-
ple be given to her nation. 
A couple weeks ago I read portions of 
a transcript of a hearing I chaired in 
2011 
after 
another 
fraudulent 
Belarusian election put Lukashenko 
back in power. Then as now, and on so 
many other occasions, Lukashenko’s 
bullies beat, jailed, assaulted, tortured, 
raped, and killed peaceful protesters, 
but now it is going on right as we meet 
here today as never before. 
The big mistake of the past, fatigue 
or lack of commitment and persever-
ance by the international community, 
can’t be repeated this time. We can’t be 
outraged at first and then turn the 
page and say, ‘‘Now what?’’ 
We need to have a determined effort 
to help these people who are struggling 
for democracy and human rights in 
their nation. 
On two separate occasions, I would 
note 
parenthetically, 
I 
met 
with 
Lukashenko in Minsk and came away 
resolved to accelerate the struggle for 
democracy and freedom. 
I was with a group of 11 Members, in-
cluding some of our members on the 
committee, and he pointed to me, be-
cause I am the author of the Belarus 
Democracy Act of 2004, and said, 
‘‘There is public enemy number one.’’ 
That is how he thinks. Anybody who 
aspires for freedom and democracy, 
particularly against his brutal regime, 
is construed to be a public enemy. And 
for the people of Belarus, they go to 
jail, where they are beaten senselessly. 
Our bipartisan bill, H.R. 8438, again, 
cosponsored 
by 
Mr. 
ENGEL, 
Mr. 
MCCAUL, Mr. KEATING, Mr. KINZINGER, 
and so many other Members of this 
House, updates, strengthens, and ex-
pands the Belarus Democracy Acts of 
2004, 2006, and 2011, laws that I also au-
thored, and renews the personal, eco-
nomic, and visa sanctions on an ex-
panded list of actors in the Belarusian 
Government, and now for the first time 
on Russian individuals complicit in 
this crackdown. 
I would note parenthetically, the 
Magnitsky Act, the idea of personally 
sanctioning with visa denial as well as 
economic sanctions on individuals that 
led to the Global Magnitsky Act came 
out of the Belarus Democracy Act of 
2004. 
So it is an idea, it is a method of 
holding those who commit these abuses 
personally accountable. 
When you sanction an entire nation, 
that has an impact, but innocent peo-
ple do get hurt. This sanctions the in-
dividuals who are perpetrators of these 
heinous crimes. 
Yesterday, Svetlana again called for 
the sanctions, just yesterday for the 
sanctions that are embedded in our 
bill. So the time to act is now. 
The bill also has other provisions. It 
does call for new elections. 
It recognizes the Coordination Coun-
cil as a legitimate institution to par-
ticipate in a dialogue on a peaceful 
transition of power. They are the ones 
we need to be talking to. 
It calls for the release of all political 
prisoners, and that number rises by the 
day. 
It supports the aspirations of the 
people to exercise their religious free-
dom. There has been a crackdown there 
as well. 
It authorizes assistance to promote 
democracy in civil society in Belarus. 
On occasions in Minsk, I have met with 
those individuals. They are brave be-
yond words, because they always know 
somebody is lurking—the secret po-
lice—just waiting to haul them off to 
prison. 
It unequivocally states that it is the 
policy of the U.S. ‘‘not to recognize 
any incorporation of Belarus into a 
‘Union State’ with Russia.’’ Russia is 
using this crisis as a pretext to further 
manifest their monopoly of power. 
They would love—like they did in parts 
of Ukraine, South Ossetia, Abkhazia— 
to just take the whole of Belarus into 
their national boundary. 
The bill requires the U.S. strategy to 
promote broadcasting, internet free-
dom, and access to information.

In addition, it gives much needed 
support to the Belarusian media and to 
the IT sector. 
By passing this bill today followed 
by, hopefully, swift approval in the 
Senate and signature into law by the 
President, we not only reiterate, but 
significantly expand our support and 
solidarity with the great people of 
Belarus. We need to pass this bill and I 
respectfully call on our Senate col-
leagues to pass it as well. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, again, there being no further 
speakers, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, for over 3 months, we 
have watched, being inspired, as the 
Belarusian people have peacefully de-
manded that their voices be heard and 
that new, free, and fair elections be 
held. 
As we have seen, women dressed in 
white and carrying flowers have formed 
miles-long solidarity chains to protest 
police violence. Employees at state-run 
companies have gone on strike, despite 
the threat of losing their jobs. Univer-
sity students have risked expulsion to 
join the protests. State TV anchors 
have walked off the set, no longer able 
to support the regime’s propaganda 
campaign. Thousands of courageous 
pensioners have marched in opposition 
to the Belarusian dictator. 
Today, led by the very talented and 
visionary Congressman CHRIS
SMITH, 
we must stand and send a strong mes-
sage to these brave men and women 
that they are not alone and that the 
American people stand with them. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, again, 
let me thank Mr. SMITH and other col-
leagues who have worked so hard on 
this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
ESPAILLAT) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 8438, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
UKRAINE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM 
SUPPORT ACT 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 5408) to oppose violations of 
religious freedom in Ukraine by Russia 
and armed groups commanded by Rus-
sia, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 5408 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Ukraine Re-
ligious Freedom Support Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress makes the following findings: 
(1) Russia invaded the Crimea region of 
Ukraine in February 2014, continues to oc-
cupy and control that region, and has exer-
cised control over part of the Donbas region 
of eastern Ukraine since April 2014 through 
non-state armed groups and illegal entities 
it has established, instigated, commanded, 
and supported, including with military and 
intelligence personnel on the ground from 
Russia. 
(2) International humanitarian law, includ-
ing the Geneva Conventions, to which Russia 
is a signatory, requires Russia to respect and 
protect the religious freedom of the inhab-
itants of the territory it occupies or con-
trols, including through organized non-state 
armed groups and illegal entities it com-
mands and supports, and holds Russia re-
sponsible for violations of religious freedom 
in this territory. 
(3) According to the Department of State’s 
International Religious Freedom Reports, 
and other reporting, violations of religious 
freedom in the Crimea region of Ukraine 
since Russia invaded and occupied the terri-
tory have included abduction, detention and 
imprisonment, torture, forced psychiatric 
hospitalizations, fines, restrictions on mis-
sionary activities, confiscations of property, 
including churches and meeting halls, expul-
sions and obstructions to reentry, denying 
registration of religious groups, vandalism, 
fines, and banning peaceful religious groups, 
and targeted groups have included Muslim 
Crimean Tatars, the Orthodox Church of 
Ukraine, formerly the Ukrainian Orthodox 
Church of the Kyivan Patriarchate, the 
Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, Protes-
tant Christians, and Jehovah’s Witnesses. 
(4) According to the Department of State’s 
International Religious Freedom Reports,

vah’s Witnesses. 
(5) The International Religious Freedom 
Act of 1998, as amended by the Frank R. Wolf 
International Religious Freedom Act, re-
quires the President to— 
(A) designate a foreign country as a coun-
try of particular concern for religious free-
dom when its government has engaged in or 
tolerated particularly severe violations of 
religious freedom in that country over the 
previous 12 months; 
(B) take one or more of the actions de-
scribed in paragraphs (9) through (15) of sec-
tion 405(a) of the International Religious 
Freedom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6445(a)), or 
commensurate actions in substitution, not 
later than 90 days, or 180 days in case of a 
delay under paragraph (3), after the date of 
the designation of a country as a country of 
particular concern for religious freedom; and 
(C) designate a foreign country on a ‘‘Spe-
cial Watch List’’ when its government has 
engaged in or tolerated severe violations of 
religious freedom in that country over the 
previous 12 months. 
(6) On December 18, 2019, the Secretary of 
State re-designated Russia for the ‘‘Special 
Watch List’’. 
(7) The National Security Strategy of the 
United States issued in 2017, 2015, 2006, 2002, 
2000, 1999, 1998, and 1997, committed the 
United States to promoting international re-
ligious freedom to advance the security, eco-
nomic, and other national interests of the 
United States. 
SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
It is the policy of the United States to con-
sider any alien who, while serving as an offi-
cial of the Government of Russia, was re-
sponsible for or directly carried out particu-
larly severe violations of religious freedom 
in the sovereign territory of Ukraine that 
Russia illegally occupies or controls, includ-
ing through non-state armed groups and ille-
gal entities it commands and supports, to 
have committed particularly severe viola-
tions of religious freedom for purposes of ap-
plying section 212(a)(2)(G) of the Immigra-
tion 
and 
Nationality 
Act 
(8 
U.S.C. 
1182(a)(2)(G)) with respect to any such alien. 
SEC. 4. DESIGNATION OF RUSSIA AS A COUNTRY 
OF PARTICULAR CONCERN FOR RE-
LIGIOUS FREEDOM. 
For purposes of making a determination of 
whether to designate Russia as a country of 
particular concern for religious freedom 
under section 402 of the International Reli-
gious Freedom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6442), 
the President shall consider any particularly 
severe violation of religious freedom in the 
territory of Ukraine that Russia occupies or 
controls, including controls through non- 
state armed groups and illegal entities it 
commands and supports, during the period of 
time that is the basis for the determination 
and designation, to be a particularly severe 
violation of religious freedom that the Gov-
ernment of Russia has engaged in or toler-
ated. 
SEC. 5. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EF-
FECTS. 
The budgetary effects of this Act, for the 
purpose of complying with the Statutory 
Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be deter-
mined by reference to the latest statement 
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in 
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. ESPAILLAT) and the gen-
tleman from South Carolina (Mr. WIL-
SON) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous materials on H.R. 
5408. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to my 
friend from South Carolina (Mr. WIL-
SON) for bringing forward this bill that 
shines a light on the egregious viola-
tions of human rights and religious 
freedom at the hands of Russian-led 
forces in Ukraine’s sovereign territory.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5921 
November 18, 2020 
We have been saying it for years, but 
it always bears repeating: Crimea is 
Ukraine; the Donbas is Ukraine. Russia 
must be held accountable for the brutal 
violations of human rights and reli-
gious freedoms taking place under 
their attempted annexation of these 
areas. 
The International Religious Freedom 
Act of 1998 provides a range of con-
sequences for governments that per-
secute people on religious grounds. 
From public condemnation to trade 
sanctions, the administration has tools 
to push back on this sort of abuse. 
This bill calls for Russia to be held 
accountable under the law for the vio-
lations of religious freedoms we are 
seeing in Ukraine. 
The bill represents a smart approach 
to address a specific problem ema-
nating from Russia. We should move it 
forward along with other efforts to 
push back on Putin’s aggression. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS, 
Washington, DC, November 11, 2020. 
Hon. JERROLD NADLER, 
Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN NADLER: I am writing to 
you concerning H.R. 5408, Ukraine Religious 
Freedom Support Act. I appreciate your will-
ingness to work cooperatively on this legis-
lation. 
I acknowledge that provisions of the bill 
fall within the jurisdiction of the House 
Committee on the Judiciary under House 
Rule X, and that your Committee will forgo 
action on H.R. 5408 to expedite floor consid-
eration. I further acknowledge that the inac-
tion of your Committee with respect to the 
bill does not waive any future jurisdictional 
claim over the matters contained in the bill 
that fall within your jurisdiction. I will also 
support the appointment of Committee on 
the Judiciary conferees during any House- 
Senate conference convened on this legisla-
tion. 
Lastly, I will ensure that our exchange of 
letters is included in the Congressional 
Record during floor consideration of the bill. 
Thank you again for your cooperation re-
garding the legislation. I look forward to 
continuing to work with you as the measure 
moves through the legislative process. 
Sincerely, 
ELIOT L. ENGEL, 
Chairman. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY, 
Washington, DC. November 17, 2020. 
Hon. ELIOT ENGEL, 
Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN ENGEL: This is to advise 
you that the Committee on the Judiciary 
has now had an opportunity to review the 
provisions in R.R. 5408, the ‘‘Ukraine Reli-
gious Freedom Support Act,’’ that fall with-
in our Rule X jurisdiction. I appreciate your 
consulting with us on those provisions. The 
Judiciary Committee has no objection to 
your including them in the bill for consider-
ation on the House floor, and to expedite 
that consideration is willing to forgo action 
on R.R. 5408, with the understanding that we 
do not thereby waive any future jurisdic-
tional claim over those provisions or their 
subject matters. 
I the event a House-Senate conference on 
this or similar legislation is convened, the 
Judiciary Committee reserves the right to 
request an appropriate number of conferees 
to address any concerns with these or simi-
lar provisions that may arise in conference. 
Please place this letter into the Congres-
sional Record during consideration of the 
measure on the House floor. Thank you for 
the cooperative spirit in which you have 
worked regarding this matter and others be-
tween our committees. 
Sincerely, 
JERROLD NADLER, 
Chairman. 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
might consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of a bill which I am grateful to have in-
troduced with my colleague, EMANUEL 
CLEAVER of Missouri, the Ukraine Reli-
gious Freedom Support Act. 
Russia’s war in Ukraine and illegal 
occupation of Crimea have dragged on 
for nearly 7 years. The human toll is 
staggering. The fighting has killed as 
many as 10,000 soldiers as well as 3,000 
innocent civilians. 
Another casualty of Russian aggres-
sion in Ukraine has been the attack on 
religious freedom. 
Russian occupation authorities in 
Crimea continue to persecute and in-
timidate the minority Christian, Mus-
lim, and other religious groups, like 
the Jehovah’s Witnesses. 
Putin’s puppets in Crimea have sub-
jected them to kidnappings, torture, 
forced psychiatric examinations, and 
imprisonment. Recently, eight Muslim 
Crimean Tatars were sentenced to be-
tween 13 and 19 years in a Russian pris-
on on the entirely baseless charge of 
terrorism. 
Minority religious groups in the area 
of eastern Ukraine, controlled by pro- 
Putin proxies, have also been forced to 
flee in order to escape the oppressive 
conditions. 
The religious persecution in Ukraine 
being committed at the hands of Putin 
authorities is self-destructive and must 
be stopped. 
Throughout our history, the United 
States has worked tirelessly to ad-
vance religious freedom and protect re-
ligious minorities around the globe. 
This bill follows that strong tradition 
by accomplishing two things. 
First, it brings international atten-
tion to the grave violations of religious 
freedom in the territory of Ukraine— 
where, again, people need to know, 
13,000 people have been killed—that 
Putin illegally occupies or controls 
through illegal armed groups. 
Second, it helps ensure that Vladimir 
Putin and his cronies are held account-
able. 
We cannot allow these grave viola-
tions to continue. 
In closing, it is vital that the United 
States continues to be a leader in ad-
vancing international religious free-
dom around the world. 
This bill not only brings inter-
national attention to the religious per-
secution being committed in the terri-
tory of Ukraine that Putin illegally oc-
cupies 
or 
controls 
through 
illegal 
armed groups it commands, but also 
ensures Vladimir Putin and his thugs 
are held accountable. 
Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Hel-
sinki Commission, along with Con-
gressman and Chairman ALCEE HAS-
TINGS, I would also like to recognize 
the 
Helsinki 
Commission 
for 
long 
championing this issue. In particular, I 
would like to recognize Nathaniel Hurd 
of the Helsinki Commission staff for all 
of his work to ensure that we hold 
Putin to account for these egregious 
violations 
of 
religious 
liberty 
in 
Ukraine. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this 
legislation, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, Rus-
sia and Putin are responsible for illegal 
and destabilizing actions all around the 
world. We need a comprehensive strat-
egy to put a stop to their aggression 
and impose tough consequences. It is 
going to take a lot of different tools, 
and this bill will give us one of them. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes,’’ and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
ESPAILLAT) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5408, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

AMENDING DEPARTMENT OF 
STATE’S REWARDS PROGRAM 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 4802) to amend the State De-
partment Basic Authorities Act of 1956 
to authorize rewards under the Depart-
ment of State’s rewards program relat-
ing to information regarding individ-
uals or entities engaged in activities in 
contravention of United States or 
United Nations sanctions, and for other 
purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows:

resentatives of the United States of America in

‘‘(B) knowingly, directly or indirectly, pro-
vides training, advice, or other services or 
assistance, or engages in significant finan-
cial transactions, relating to any such goods,

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. ESPAILLAT) and the gen-
tleman from South Carolina (Mr. WIL-
SON) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and to 
include any extraneous material on 
H.R. 4802. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this 
measure and want to thank the au-
thors, Mr. WILSON and Mr. DEUTCH, for 
their hard work and leadership. 
Since its establishment in 1984, the 
State Department’s Rewards for Jus-
tice Program has awarded more than 
$150 million to those who help the 
United States Government bring ter-
rorists and criminals to justice. 
Over the years, we have expanded the 
scope of this effort, offering rewards re-
lated to a wider range of crimes and en-
snaring more people who mean Ameri-
cans harm. This legislation would add 
more and more tools to the toolbox. 
This bill was inspired by a former 
Syrian diplomat and defector named 
Bassam Barabandi. As an employee of 
the Syrian Embassy here in Wash-
ington, 
D.C., 
he 
worked 
with 
antiregime activists to provide pass-
ports to critics of Bashar al-Assad, and 
for years after his defection, Barabandi 
supplied the United States Government 
with information on Syrian oligarchs 
close to the Assad regime. This in-
cludes information on Samer Foz, who 
was ultimately the target of American 
sanctions. 
We want to incentivize more people 
like Mr. Barabandi to come forward 
with information that will ultimately 
enhance compliance with the U.S. and 
international sanctions, increase con-
fidence in the rule of law, and bring to 
justice criminals and rogue regimes 
seeking to circumvent U.S. law. 
This bill expands the Rewards for 
Justice Program by authorizing re-
wards for individuals who provide in-
formation on those who evade the 
United States’ and the United Nations’ 
sanctions. 
This is a smart bill that builds on a 
successful program. I am pleased to 
support it, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of another bill I introduced with my 
friend 
and 
subcommittee 
colleague 
Chairman TED DEUTCH from Florida, 
H.R. 4802. 
This bill will expand the Rewards for 
Justice Program at the State Depart-
ment to authorize rewards for individ-
uals coming forward with information 
on sanctions evasion practices. 
The bill was inspired by Bassam 
Barabandi, a courageous Syrian patriot 
and former diplomat at the Syrian Em-
bassy here in Washington who worked 
with the antiregime activists to pro-
vide passports to critics of the criminal 
Assad regime, promoting the best in-
terests of the people of Syria. 
For 
years 
after 
his 
defection, 
Barabandi lobbied the U.S. Govern-
ment and provided detailed informa-
tion on Syrian oligarchs close to Assad 
and their sanctions evasion practices, 
including information on Samer Foz, 
who was ultimately sanctioned by the 
Treasury last year. He has coura-
geously 
authored 
‘‘The 
Blacklist,’’ 
which fully documents those who re-
press the talented people of Syria. 
Barabandi’s 
case 
highlighted 
the 
need to create a clearer mechanism to 
incentivize individuals to come forward 
with this kind of vital information. 
H.R. 4802 will do just that. It will ulti-
mately enhance compliance with U.S. 
and international sanctions, increase 
confidence in the rule of law, and bring 
criminals and rogue regimes seeking to 
circumvent U.S. law to justice. 
For sanctions to be successful, we 
must have the best information on 
their ability to hit their intended tar-
gets. We must pass many sanctions 
bills in this body, but it is far easier to 
pass a sanctions bill than it is to en-
force it. 
Expanding the Rewards for Justice 
Program will allow us to acquire infor-
mation on illegal activity that sup-
ports the regimes of Iran, North Korea, 
and other rogue states from the grass-
roots. Better information equals better 
enforcement on behalf of the per-
secuted persons of those countries. Bet-
ter enforcement equals better results. 
We should pass this bill and help 
make sure that the sanctions policies 
are as effective as possible. 
Mr. Speaker, there being no further 
speakers, 
again, 
I 
thank 
Bassam 
Barabandi for his courage as a patriot 
for the people of Syria in the face of 
the evil Assad regime. He is currently 
awaiting a decision from USCIS re-
garding his request for asylum in the 
United States, and I hope and pray that 
the Department of Homeland Security 
rewards this hero of democracy for the 
people of Syria for his bravery. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, let 
me again thank Mr. WILSON and Mr. 
DEUTCH for bringing this bill forward. I 
urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
ESPAILLAT) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4802. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

TROPICAL

REAU-
THORIZATION ACT OF 2020 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 7954) to reauthorize the Trop-
ical Forest and Coral Reef Conserva-
tion Act of 1998. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 7954 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Tropical 
Forest and Coral Reef Conservation Reau-
thorization Act of 2020’’. 
SEC. 2. REAUTHORIZATION. 
Section 806(d) of the Tropical Forest and 
Coral Reef Conservation Act of 1998 (22 
U.S.C. 2431d(d)) is amended by adding at the 
end the following new paragraphs: 
‘‘(9) $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2021. 
‘‘(10) $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2022. 
‘‘(11) $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2023. 
‘‘(12) $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2024. 
‘‘(13) $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2025.’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. ESPAILLAT) and the gen-
tleman from South Carolina (Mr. WIL-
SON) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and to 
include any extraneous material on 
H.R. 7954. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support 
this measure brought forward by my 
friend from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT), to pro-
vide continued funding for the Tropical 
Forest and Coral Reef Conservation 
Act, what we call the TFCA, for fiscal 
years 2021 through 2025. 
The purpose of the TFCA is to offer 
developing countries the option to di-
rect a portion of their debt payments 
to local forest and coral reef conserva-
tion activities instead of making those 
payments to the U.S. Government. 
Since the TFCA was enacted in 1998, 
it made real differences in efforts to

preserve and protect these fragile eco-
systems. The State Department has 
reached 20 separate bilateral agree-
ments with 14 countries, resulting in 
over $339 million in long-term commit-
ment to conserve tropical forests. 
This bipartisan legislation takes sig-
nificant strides to build stronger rela-
tionships with countries around the 
world, while ensuring that irreplace-
able tropical forests and coral reefs are 
protected and preserved for future gen-
erations. 
I am pleased to support this legisla-
tion, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
7954, the Tropical Forest and Coral 
Reef Reauthorization Act of 2020, led 
by Representative STEVE CHABOT from 
Ohio and BRAD SHERMAN from Cali-
fornia. 
Congress first enacted this important 
legislation in 1998. The legislation al-
lows eligible developing countries to 
restructure certain debt owed to the 
U.S. Government and, in turn, gen-
erates additional revenue to support 
tropical forest or coral reef conserva-
tion projects. These agreements also 
reinvest in locally led civil society and 
conservation organizations that take 
ownership of this critical restoration 
work. 
According to The Nature Conser-
vancy, agreements under this program 
have saved more than 67 million acres 
of tropical forest in countries such as 
Botswana, Brazil, the Philippines, and 
Indonesia. 
Since first enacted, the Tropical For-
est Conservation Act has generated al-
most $340 million in local currency for 
tropical forest conservation projects. 
These are substantial investments in 
the health of our world’s most critical 
forests and an investment in future 
generations. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
important measure. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to yield 4 min-
utes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. 
CHABOT), the sponsor of the bill. 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding, and I thank 
the gentleman from South Carolina 
(Mr. WILSON) and the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. ESPAILLAT) for their 
leadership on this legislation here 
today and previous to this. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
7954, the Tropical Forest and Coral 
Reef Conservation Reauthorization Act 
of 2020. It is bipartisan legislation that 
I introduced with my Democratic col-
league and friend from California, 
BRAD SHERMAN, as a companion to leg-
islation that Senator PORTMAN intro-
duced previously in the Senate. 
I want to thank Senator PORTMAN. 
He has been a longtime leader on this 
topic, and it makes a lot of sense. It is 
really common sense. It helps so many 
people all across the globe. 
Tropical forests and coral reefs are 
some of the most biologically diverse 
and environmentally important eco-
systems anywhere. Today, however, 
whether it is deforestation or pollution 
or overfishing or some other cause, 
these 
vital 
natural 
resources 
are 
threatened across the globe. 
Now, many tropical forests and coral 
reefs are located in the developing 
world where economic realities can 
often get in the way of the conserva-
tion. It is in the best interest of the 
whole world to protect and responsibly 
manage these resources. That is why I 
introduced H.R. 7954. 
This legislation builds on our work 
on the Tropical Forest Conservation 
Reauthorization Act of 2018 and the 
Tropical Forest Conservation Act back 
in 1998, so this is 22 years ago. 
Back in 1998, we set up a debt forgive-
ness program under which the U.S. for-
gives a debt owed to us by a developing 
nation in exchange for that country 
making investments in conservation 
work to sustain its critical ecosystems. 
Agreements under this program also 
strengthen local economies by sup-
porting sustainable development of 
these resources as well as civil society 
groups in partner nations that conduct 
conservation works. 
And this program has proven results. 
Since 1998, as was mentioned, the U.S. 
has used it to conserve 67 million 
acres—think of that, 67 million acres— 
of tropical forests. Further, by assist-
ing developing countries to properly 
manage and sustainably develop these 
resources, the program follows the old 
adage of teaching a man to fish. 
With these benefits in mind, I am 
proud to say that our legislation has 
received the support of Conservation 
International, the World Wildlife Fund, 
the Wildlife Conservation Society, and 
The Nature Conservancy, among oth-
ers. 
b 1600 
Finally, our legislation sets a sharp 
contrast with what the Chinese devel-
opment model is. Through the Belt and 
Road Initiative, for example, China has 
offered elites in developing countries 
flashy or get-rich-quick schemes and 
projects, often with little or no regard 
for the local environment. Citizens in 
these countries are taken advantage of. 
H.R. 7954 keeps one more tool in the 
State Department’s toolbox to help 
convince 
developing 
countries 
to 
choose a sustainable, Western model of 
development that stacks up very favor-
ably with China’s model by respecting 
the country’s ecosystem and respecting 
its people. 
Passing this bill, H.R. 7954, extends a 
highly successful conservation program 
and helps counter China’s pig in a poke 
development model; therefore, I would 
urge my colleagues to support this leg-
islation. Again, I thank Mr. WILSON 
and Mr. ESPAILLAT. 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I have no further speakers, 
and I yield myself the balance of my 
time for the purpose of closing. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative 
STEVE CHABOT, who is a proven cham-
pion for conservation and for eco-
systems beneficial to countries around 
the world for offering this measure. 
With the expanded authority to use 
debt-for-nature agreements to target 
tropical coral reef restoration, there is 
much more work to be done. 
This bill will ensure that the policy 
objectives and programs outlined in 
the Republican-led, bipartisan legisla-
tion enacted in December 2018 will be 
fully operationalized. This is a com-
monsense approach that reduces eligi-
ble countries’ debt burdens while rein-
vesting those resources in local trop-
ical forests and coral reef conservation. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this measure, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, once 
again, I thank Mr. CHABOT for his lead-
ership. 
Mr. Speaker, I also would like to 
take this opportunity to thank Mr. 
ELIOT ENGEL, the chair of this com-
mittee, for his many years of distin-
guished service in Congress ably rep-
resenting his district, the State of New 
York, and our country here in the Halls 
of Congress while presiding and leading 
the Foreign Affairs Committee. Today 
is a testament of all the great work 
that he has done across the aisle with 
many Members who have, of course, 
contributed tremendously to the dia-
logue. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
ESPAILLAT) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 7954. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

HONORING TOLEDO METROPARKS

permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise to-
night in recognition of a beloved sys-
tem of parks and trails in my northern 
Ohio district: Toledo Metroparks. 
On October 27 of this year, Toledo 
Metroparks was awarded the most

prestigious honor in the parks and 
recreation industry: the 2020 National 
Gold Medal Award for excellence in 
parks and recreation management and, 
with it, the recognition as the number 
one park system in the United States 
of America by the American Academy 
for Park and Recreation Administra-
tion, in partnership with the National 
Recreation and Park Association. 
Like many Toledoans, I am im-
mensely thankful for those who have 
fought tirelessly to create a genuine, 
world-class system of parks and trails 
right in the heart of our community. In 
fact, Toledo Metroparks was among 20 
park and recreation agencies and four 
military installations across our coun-
try and in Germany considered just as 
finalists for the award. 
Whether you enjoy bird watching, 
hiking, mountain biking, archery, or 
even just relaxing in a hammock, To-
ledo Metroparks has countless ways to 
get you outside and enjoying nature. 
Congratulations 
to 
Toledo 
Metroparks for receiving this pres-
tigious and well-deserved national rec-
ognition. With the recent $23 million 
grant from the Department of Trans-
portation to construct the Glass City 
Riverwalk, a transformative project in 
the heart of Toledo, our Metroparks 
will only continue to get better in this 
21st century. 
Madam Speaker, our office will glad-
ly fly a flag over this U.S. Capitol in 
the honor of this gold medal award to 
Toledo Metroparks. Congratulations to 
all.

CONGRATULATING CINCINNATI ST. 
XAVIER HIGH SCHOOL’S FOOT-
BALL TEAM 
(Mr. WENSTRUP asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. WENSTRUP. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to congratulate Cincinnati 
St. Xavier High School’s football team 
on becoming the Division I Ohio State 
champions. 
Led by inspirational Head Coach 
Steve Specht, the St. X Bombers 
clinched the title by winning the State 
championship by a score of 44–3, set-
ting a record for the largest margin of 
victory ever in a Division I final. 
This impressive showing followed 
dramatic 
come-from-behind 
fourth- 
quarter victories in both the quarter-
finals and the semifinals. 
I am always proud to be a St. Xavier 
alumnus, and I feel especially proud of 
the 2020 Bomber team as the school 
earned their fourth State champion-
ship. 
I am especially proud because it is an 
understatement to say that the last 
several months have been difficult for 
our communities in Ohio and across 
the country. Yet, last Friday night, 
families, friends, students, and spec-
tators, alike, were able to return to a 
little bit of normalcy—exactly why 
sports and teamwork are so important 
to the Nation. 
Congratulations, again, to the St. 
Xavier players, to Coach Steve Specht 
and his staff, and to the St. Xavier 
faithful. 
Go Bombers.

WHY I WEAR A MASK 
(Ms. DEAN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. DEAN. Madam Speaker, I wear a 
mask so my granddaughter, Aubrey, 
can return to third grade in-person 
schooling as soon as possible. 
I wear a mask so that one day I can 
go to church and be surrounded again 
by a community in prayer. 
I wear a mask to look forward to the 
day when my entire family can get to-
gether. 
I wear a mask so more people do not 
have to experience the feeling of loss 
my family felt when my mother-in-law, 
Joan Cunnane, passed away from the 
COVID virus. 
Wearing a mask is not a political 
statement; it is a simple way of saying: 
‘‘I value the lives around me.’’ 
Nearly 250,000 Americans are dead be-
cause of this brutal virus, and it is up 
to each of us to do our part. 
Today, I put on my mask as an act of 
public health, of compassion, of care, 
and of respect, as a way of asking not 
what others can do for me, but what I 
am always saying behind my mask: 
‘‘What can I do for you?’’

RECOGNIZING OAKCREST HIGH 
SCHOOL STUDENT GOVERNMENT 
(Mr. VAN DREW asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, I 
want to thank Oakcrest High School in 
south Jersey for engaging all of us to 
be involved in what this Nation is built 
upon: representative government. 
Voting is a right that we must all en-
gage in to see the country that we 
want to live in. I am proud of them. I 
am proud of all of you and your belief 
in America. America is an exceptional 
Nation, and we can never forget that. 
Our predecessors built this Nation 
with mechanisms in place to ensure 
that, even though there are problems 
at times, that we can self-correct and 
we can heal the wrongs. 
I ran for reelection because I believe 
in a strong America, which makes a 
strong south Jersey. I believe that 
what made America great keeps Amer-
ica great. I believe in a strong econ-
omy, strong borders, and a strong mili-
tary, anchored by strong energy, Amer-
ican-made 
and 
American-supplied 
goods and services, all while protecting 
our environment, our families, and 
core American values. 
To me, this isn’t about politics. A 
strong nation is built upon a strong 
economy, 
built 
on 
American-made 
goods. We must bring American manu-
facturing jobs back home where they 
belong. A strong nation does not let 
foreign governments take advantage of 
us, and I will do everything in my 
power to ensure that doesn’t happen. 
I want to thank all of the profes-
sionals at Oakcrest High School, and I 
thank them for their work through this 
pandemic, and all of the students for 
the work that they have done. May God 
bless them all.

REMEMBERING CECIL CORBIN- 
MARK 
(Mr. ESPAILLAT asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, it 
is with a heavy heart that I rise today 
in remembrance and honor of Cecil 
Corbin-Mark, whose passing on the 
evening of October 15 sent shock waves 
of grief throughout New York’s polit-
ical and activist communities. 
A Harlem native, a trailblazer in the 
fight for environmental justice, and an 
inspiration to more individuals than he 
would ever know, Cecil was a giant in 
his community and across the Nation, 
and his loss is immeasurable. 
Cecil led a life dedicated to building 
sustainable communities and healthy 
communities. He worked tirelessly to 
ensure that people of color and low-in-
come residents always had a seat at 
the table. 
Cecil’s impact on the sustainable fu-
ture of Harlem, our surrounding com-
munities, and our Nation cannot be 
overstated. 
Our prayers remain with Cecil’s fam-
ily and the WE ACT community. 
May he rest in power.

REMEMBERING FORMER REDDING, 
CALIFORNIA, CHIEF OF POLICE 
BOB BLANKENSHIP 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize the life and leg-
acy of former Redding Police Depart-
ment Chief of Police Bob Blankenship 
after his passing late last month at the 
age of 73. 
Chief Blankenship started his career 
at the Redding Police Department in 
1972. After being promoted through the 
Redding PD ranks, he became chief of 
police in 1988. He retired after 30 years 
of service in 2002. 
Chief Blankenship served on the 
State 
of 
California 
Peace 
Officer 
Standards and Training Commission 
and was president of the California Po-
lice Chiefs Association. 
He was instrumental in developing 
statewide policies for police response 
to domestic violence incidents, and he 
brought the first Neighborhood Polic-
ing Unit to the area.

COMMEMORATING THE 50TH ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE NATIONAL IN-
STITUTE 
ON 
ALCOHOL 
ABUSE 
AND ALCOHOLISM 
(Mr. TONKO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. TONKO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in commemoration of the 50th 
anniversary of the National Institute 
on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. 
For 50 years, NIAAA has been the 
leader in generating and disseminating 
fundamental information about the ef-
fects of alcohol on our health and well- 
being and applying that knowledge to 
improve the lives of those struggling 
with alcohol-related problems. 
In the United States alone, nearly 15 
million people have an alcohol-use dis-
order. An estimated 88,000 people die 
from alcohol-related causes annually, 
and alcohol misuse has immeasurable 
impacts on families and communities 
across our Nation. 
While NIAAA has made significant 
achievements toward improving public 
health over the past 50 years, such as 
illuminating the negative effects of 
prenatal alcohol exposure and sup-
porting the development of effective 
behavioral therapies and medications 
to treat alcohol use disorder, more 
work is needed. 
With technological advances and an 
expanding knowledge base, NIAAA is 
poised to advance alcohol research to 
the next frontier toward the goal of 
helping more Americans live healthier, 
more productive lives.

STOP THE IMPORTATION OF SYN-
THETIC FENTANYL FROM CHINA 
(Mr. BURCHETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, 
our country is still battling the opioid 
epidemic, and every day we hear heart-
breaking 
stories 
of 
those 
lost 
to 
overdoses during this crisis. Congress 
must remain vigilant in the fight 
against opioids, especially synthetic 
fentanyl from China. 
China is the heart of the global 
fentanyl 
supply 
chain, 
and 
most 
fentanyl trafficked into the United 
States is produced in China. Some-
times Chinese fentanyl is shipped di-
rectly into our country, and other 
times it is brought across our northern 
and southern borders by smugglers 
working with Chinese drug dealers. 
It only takes a small amount of 
fentanyl to overdose, and unsuspecting 
drug users often purchase drugs cut 
with fentanyl. More and more Ameri-
cans are dying from synthetic opioid 
overdoses. There were an estimated 
31,000 deaths in 2018. 
The Chinese Government needs to go 
after the massive fentanyl operation in 
their country and should execute the 
dirtbag fentanyl drug dealers, smug-
glers, and producers. 
I was a cosponsor of the Fentanyl 
Sanctions Act, which was included in 
the 2020 National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act, which gives the President the 
authority to impose sanctions against 
countries failing to do their part to 
stop illegal opioid traffic. If the Chi-
nese Government wants to avoid sanc-
tions, they must bring the lowlifes run-
ning this massive fentanyl operation to 
justice.

RISING NUMBER OF COVID–19 
CASES 
(Mr. SOTO asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. 
SOTO. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
coronavirus cases are rising again in 
Florida. Today, Florida reported 7,925 
new cases. 
Coronavirus cases are rising nation-
ally. Yesterday, there were over 155,000 
Americans 
who 
contracted 
the 
coronavirus and another 1,707 Ameri-
cans dead. That is the highest daily 
death toll since May 14. 
American families need our help: 
testing, tracing, treatment, and a vac-
cine; keeping our first responders on 
the job; small business relief; jobless 
benefits; and food and housing assist-
ance. 
And what is Congress doing about it? 
The House majority has voted twice 
for the Heroes Act, including a com-
promise. President-elect Joe Biden has 
said right now Congress should come 
together and pass COVID relief pack-
ages like the Heroes Act. 
Where is President Trump? Where is 
the Senate Republican majority? Mil-
lions of Americans would like to know. 
America is in crisis. We must come 
together as a Congress, and the time 
for action is now.

COVID–19 
DIS-
PARITIES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. 
LEE of Nevada). Under the Speaker’s 
announced policy of January 3, 2019, 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
ESPAILLAT) is recognized for 60 minutes 
as the designee of the majority leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, 
today we reconvene our monthly Spe-
cial Order hour of the Congressional 
Hispanic Caucus for the first time, 
really, since the COVID–19 pandemic 
reached America’s shores. 
As we speak here today, America’s 
staring down the barrel of a third wave 
of the COVID–19 pandemic, the worst 
one, perhaps, that we have so far faced. 
We are adding a million cases a 
week—yes, a million cases every week. 
We are approaching a total of 11.5 mil-
lion cases, more than any other nation 
in the world by far, despite many more 
populous countries with outbreaks. 
Even more grim, we lead the world in 
the number of confirmed COVID-re-
lated deaths and quickly are approach-
ing 1,000 deaths per day, more than any 
other nation facing this new wave of 
the COVID–19 pandemic. 
States and cities are careening to-
wards lockdowns. 
Just today, Madam Speaker, New 
York City ordered a shutdown of its 
schools. It had attempted to open, par-
tially, the schools, but today the 
mayor of the city of New York ordered 
another shutdown of the school sys-
tem. Over 1 million children will stay 
at home with their family members. 
And so States and cities are locking 
down as we speak, right now, as we 
near the Thanksgiving holiday. 
Many States across the country, 
Governors and mayors have spoken to 
their constituencies and asked them 
not to congregate in their homes with 
more than 10 people, family members, 
during Thanksgiving. It is a wise rec-
ommendation by mayors and Gov-
ernors. 
b 1830 
Show your loved ones that you love 
them by keeping them alive. Don’t ex-
pose them to the COVID–19 virus. As 
we speak right here, as I said, New 
York City has announced that it has 
indefinitely closed schools. 
Madam Speaker, we all know why 
America is facing such a terrible out-
break of this virus: The abject failure 
by this administration to act and nu-
merous Republican leaders to take this 
pandemic seriously. It was minimized, 
underestimated, yet it was deadly to 
over 250,000 Americans. The failure of 
leadership—the failure of leadership to 
encourage something as simple as 
wearing a mask. 
The phenomenon of the COVID–19’s 
unbridled 
spread 
throughout 
the 
United States is a serious one. But 
there is even more serious phenomenon 
taking place, and that is the alarming 
disparate impact on communities of 
color. 
So this pandemic zeroes in on com-
munities of color with high rates of di-
abetes, high blood pressure, asthma, 
and other respiratory diseases, and car-
diovascular problems. Deadly condi-
tions for those that are infected by the 
COVID–19 virus. 
When my home State and the city of 
New York became the Nation’s first 
epicenter of the pandemic, the racial 
disparities were very clear. The hardest

November 18, 2020 
hit ZIP Codes were those with the 
highest number of minority popu-
lation. 
My district that has Harlem, East 
Harlem, Hamilton Heights, Washington 
Heights, Inwood, and the Northwest 
Bronx was devastated by the pandemic. 
Some of the ZIP Codes had the highest 
numbers of deaths in the country. As 
the pandemic began to subside in New 
York, but took hold in other parts of 
the country, the disparities continue to 
go unabated. 
Studies conducted in June bore out 
statistically what I had seen with my 
very own eyes and on the ground. Now, 
as the U.S. surpasses 250,000 COVID–19 
deaths and quickly approaches 12 mil-
lion confirmed cases, racial data is 
more complete, and the trend of this 
pandemic is crystal clear, it discrimi-
nates. It discriminate poor people, peo-
ple with preexisting conditions, with 
diabetes and high blood pressure. It 
discriminates communities of color, 
disproportionately hurting and killing 
individuals every single day. 
The system is broken in so many 
ways that the pandemic has both laid 
bare and exacerbated many of these 
communities. Both African Americans 
and Latinos are consistently at higher 
risks for health conditions both envi-
ronmental and inherited that have det-
rimental effects on quality of life. 
NPR recently did an analysis using 
information from the COVID Tracking 
Project, and it shows how the dispari-
ties are consistent State by State. One 
key finding is that Hispanics are con-
sistently dying from COVID–19 at high-
er rates than their share of State popu-
lations, no matter where they are. In 
May, this was true in only seven 
States, but it has spread now much 
more. 
Latinos also have a disproportionate 
rate of infection in 45 States and the 
District of Columbia. It is, unfortu-
nately, easy to see why this trend is 
happening. 
These 
communities 
are 
often more likely to face economic 
hurdles that have kept them from re-
ceiving the quality healthcare that 
they deserve. 
The kinds of preventative treatment 
that many of us take for granted are a 
luxury to those folks who cannot afford 
health insurance. We made some major 
improvements with the Affordable Care 
Act, lowering costs and getting mil-
lions more Americans insured. 
But the Trump administration has 
done everything in its power to hamper 
that law. As the pandemic raged across 
this country, they went into court to 
take away, steal the healthcare for 
those that need it. And we have begun 
to see a decline in the rate of those 
with insurance rather than the other 
way around. 
Preventative care is important be-
cause 
it 
ensures 
that 
other 
comorbidities are detected early and 
well-managed. In the absence of that 
care, something like an infectious dis-
ease can make the difference between 
life or death. 
Furthermore, things like food deserts 
leave many low-income families of 
color without healthy food options, 
driving up the rate of problems like di-
abetes, heart disease and more. 
Heavy air pollution in densely popu-
lated urban centers, which many com-
munities of color call home, means 
higher rates of asthma and other 
chronic respiratory illnesses. So when 
a highly infectious virus that attacks 
the respiratory system comes along, it 
is more likely to take its toll on those 
that already have respiratory illnesses. 
And need I mention that Latinos and 
African Americans make up a dis-
proportionate share of our frontline 
workers, putting them at much higher 
risk. As all of it piles up, it plays out 
in an obvious way. More Black and 
Brown bodies in the morgue than there 
should be. 
Madam Speaker, it doesn’t have to be 
this way. Not only can we turn this 
pandemic around, we can also turn the 
disparities around. With a national 
strategy to contain and combat the 
virus, we can reduce its spread. With a 
targeted campaign to communities of 
color, we can keep our fellow Ameri-
cans safe. And with aid to communities 
who need it the most, we can keep fam-
ilies economically stable until finally 
we are out of the woods. 
Since 
enacting 
the 
CARES 
Act, 
Democrats have twice passed the HE-
ROES Act to get critical aid to our 
communities. Billions of dollars for 
testing, tracing, and treatment. The 
three Ts. Testing, tracing, and treat-
ment. Billions of dollars for hospitals 
and needed personal protective equip-
ment. 
Billions of dollars for small busi-
nesses, and the entertainment and food 
service industries, which are taking a 
devastating hit. Billions of dollars for 
public transportation and their front-
line workers, who have heroically kept 
service going despite months of plum-
meting ridership because they need to 
get doctors and nurses and first re-
sponders and supermarket workers to 
and from work, back home. 
Billions of dollars for State and city 
governments who are facing dire rev-
enue shortfalls through no fault of 
their own. 
The President has blamed States, di-
vided our country, pointed fingers. 
This is a time of leadership in crisis. 
There are no blue or red States. There 
are the United States of America. And 
many of those State governments are 
hurting. They are at the precipice of a 
fiscal crisis of unprecedented propor-
tions. 
Madam Speaker, billions of dollars 
directly into the pockets of fellow 
Americans through a second stimulus 
payment, and the $600 unemployment 
benefits. I have seen with my very own 
eyes the food lines getting longer and 
longer around the block. People need 
the $600 unemployment benefits. Peo-
ple need another stimulus check for 
$1,200. They need the help. America 
needs the help. But the White House is 
silent and MITCH MCCONNELL is Doctor 
No. 
But Republicans in the Senate have 
refused to even consider the HEROES 
Act. The Trump administration has 
dragged us along as we have tried to 
negotiate to get robust help for the 
American people, as they should have 
it in this moment of crisis. It is long 
past time for them to come to the table 
and work with us to get the HEROES 
Act signed into law right now. The peo-
ple need the help. 
Finally, Madam Speaker, while we 
have seen terrible news about the rise 
in cases and deaths these past couple of 
weeks, we have also been given a light 
at the end of the tunnel. 
But before I speak about that, I also 
want to highlight that many families 
across the country are backed up in 
their 
rent 
payments—2 
months, 
3 
months, 4 months, 5 months, and 
maybe 6 months—and they just don’t 
know where they are going to get the 
money to pay their rent at the end of 
the road. So we must provide also the 
rental assistance, the $100 billion in the 
HEROES Act for renters across Amer-
ica that can’t sleep at night because 
they do not know where they are going 
to get the money to pay the rent. They 
are backed up 3, 4, 5, 6 months’ worth 
of rent. This is a crisis. 
However, in just the past few days, 
we have received the good news that 
the COVID–19 vaccine may be more 
than 90 percent effective at an incred-
ible rate. It is within our reach. And 
while it may take time to produce the 
doses that we need to treat everybody 
and stand up the infrastructure to get 
the vaccine to those who really need it, 
we must make sure from the outset 
that the vaccine distribution is fair 
and equitable. The ethics of the vac-
cine distribution must be fair and equi-
table. 
We cannot make the same mistake 
with the vaccine that we made with 
testing. We can’t leave States and com-
munities on their own to fight in the 
free market to wing it on their own for 
such a vital public health resource that 
is of life and death. 
We cannot allow important things 
like a vaccine that will be in such lim-
ited supply to flow to those who are 
able to pay the highest prices. We can-
not allow rich folks to muscle in and 
get the vaccine while poor people that 
suffer from preexisting conditions are 
exposed to the virus. 
We need a comprehensive plan to en-
sure that the vaccine gets to the most 
vulnerable, the quicker the better. And 
we must make sure that communities 
that were hardest hit by the pandemic 
are attended first. 
Communities of color, the African- 
American community, the Hispanic 
community, Native Americans and oth-
ers were left out of testing and they 
were short-changed. We must not do 
that again. They were left out of the 
ICU beds. We must not do that again. 
But they must not be left out of the 
vaccine distribution. They must be fair

and equitable. The distribution must 
be fair and equitable. Given the dis-
parate way which this virus has hit our 
communities, they should be amongst 
the first to receive the vaccine and get 
treated. 
I thank the Madam Speaker for al-
lowing me to address the House on this 
issue of crisis, of imperative action 
that must be taken immediately to ad-
dress the millions and millions of fami-
lies that are scared in their homes with 
this pandemic raging across the coun-
try. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. GARCI´A). 
b 1845 
Mr. 
GARCI´A 
of 
Illinois. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank 
Congressman 
ESPAILLAT for organizing this Special 
Order hour. 
Madam Speaker, we are more than 8 
months into the COVID pandemic, and 
I know that each and every one of us 
has been impacted. 
For months, we sounded the alarm on 
the pandemic’s disproportionate im-
pact on Latinos, minority commu-
nities, and especially frontline work-
ers. 
It is no coincidence that the top five 
most impacted zip codes in Illinois are 
in my district. And as many as one in 
15 Chicagoans has COVID–19, with a 
vast majority being either Latino or 
Black. 
But this is a different moment. We 
are heading into a dark winter and 
working families cannot wait for Con-
gress to act. 
Unless we take immediate action, 
more will die. The sick are splitting 
pills to pay rent. Diabetics are ration-
ing insulin to save money. People are 
going hungry or doubling up in homes 
to keep off the street. 
This falls on us. Congress. The White 
House. 
How can I continue to go back home 
and explain to my constituents again 
why Congress can’t pass relief for fami-
lies? 
We expect everyone to do their part. 
Stay home or continue working the 
frontlines. It is way past time that we 
do ours. 
$1,200 is all people were given to get 
through the lockdown, and many of my 
immigrant constituents didn’t even get 
that. Three, five, four. U.S. citizen- 
born children could not get their $500 
checks. U.S. citizen spouses could not 
get their $1,200 checks because they 
may be married to someone who 
doesn’t have a Social Security number 
yet. 
We call them essential workers, but 
really, they are expendable as far as 
Donald Trump and the Republican Sen-
ate are concerned. We call them essen-
tial, but they are expendable in the 
eyes of those who hold the keys to re-
lief. 
What do I tell the exhausted doctors 
and nurses working days at a time at 
hospitals quickly reaching capacity? 
How do I explain our inaction to the 
mother who had to wait 4 hours just to 
get tested? Or patients trying to figure 
out how they are paying next month’s 
rent? Or children who won’t have par-
ents sitting at the table this Thanks-
giving? 
Most of my constituents don’t have 
the luxury of working from home. They 
are essential workers. They are on the 
front lines making sure we keep this 
country running. 
Workers are having to make tough 
choices these days. Go to work with 
fears 
of 
contracting 
or 
spreading 
COVID–19, or stay home and risk losing 
a job, health insurance, or their home. 
All they are asking for is help to get 
by. People are afraid, frustrated, and 
worried. I am pissed off, and you should 
be, too. 
What are we doing here? What the 
heck is the Senate doing sitting around 
confirming judges while 246,000 families 
grieve? 
Yes, we are all exhausted. 
But months of willful neglect and 
recklessness from the White House, 
most Republican Governors and the 
Senate is devastating the Latino com-
munity and our entire country and 
economy. 
We have got to get a handle on this 
virus and our inaction—rather than the 
failure for the Senate or the White 
House to act—will only lead to more 
death and suffering. 
We must pass the Heroes Act now. 
Working people cannot wait until Jan-
uary. Lives are literally depending on 
it. 
I plead with all decision makers to 
come to their senses to save people’s 
lives and to help restore our economy 
by doing the right thing. Passing 
COVID relief legislation that families, 
small businesses, and communities are 
dying, literally dying, to receive. 
Now is the time for that action, be-
fore it gets colder and darker in Amer-
ica. We have the solution and the 
power to act and bring relief to all of 
those grieving and hungry and sick 
families if we act today. 
It is time for action and no more 
words. It is time to rise to the occasion 
and restore our people and our econ-
omy. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, I 
thank 
my 
colleague 
JESU´ S
CHUY 
GARCI´A from the State of Illinois. As he 
clearly said, this pandemic is not just 
about health issues and the catas-
trophe that has set on America with 
the number of folks that are COVID–19 
positive or dead, but also has an eco-
nomic 
dimension; 
small 
businesses 
must also get another round of grants 
and PPP forgivable loans to ensure 
that they continue to function, to en-
sure that they continue to provide jobs 
and opportunities for our communities. 
Madam Speaker, I thank you for this 
opportunity to allow the Congressional 
Hispanic Caucus to talk about the im-
portance of combating the disparities 
laid bare by the COVID–19 pandemic 
and how we can make up for the harm 
that has been wrought. 
I want to thank all of my CHC col-
leagues, including Congressman GARCI´A 
and those that were not here today, 
that I know are on the streets every 
day attending to their districts and 
their communities to ensure that we 
get through this together, for all the 
hard work that they have been doing 
on a day-to-day basis since March to 
help their constituents and keep all 
our communities safe. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

FAREWELL REMARKS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. CONAWAY) is recognized for 60 min-
utes as the designee of the minority 
leader. 
Mr. CONAWAY. Madam Speaker, be-
fore I get to the heart of what I came 
here to talk about, I would encourage 
the two gentleman who just spoke to 
sign the discharge petition on the bill 
that would do much of what he just 
talked about, and that is reopen the 
PPP program to those small businesses 
that would be eligible to participate in 
that. So if they would take that small 
step, then that may be able to alleviate 
some of the issues we are dealing with. 
Madam Speaker, the first remarks 
that I gave in this Chamber were dur-
ing the debate on a concurrent resolu-
tion to count the electoral college 
votes for President Bush and Vice 
President Cheney after the 2004 elec-
tion. While I had been in the House 
Chamber before that January day in 
2005, stepping up to the podium was an 
entirely different and nerve-racking 
experience. 
The Capitol is quite a bit more famil-
iar to me now because it has been 16 
years that I have been able to serve. 
The tunnels are no longer a mysterious 
labyrinth. I have grown accustomed to 
long days packed full of hearings and 
briefings and meetings. My walking 
speed is certainly quicker than it used 
to be. 
But it is with the same awe and won-
derment that I felt on January 6, 2005, 
that I stand in this Chamber today to 
deliver my final floor speech as a Mem-
ber of the U.S. House of Representa-
tives. 
When Suzanne and I began this jour-
ney back in 2002, we had no idea that 
this is where it would wind up or how 
long it would last. All I knew was that 
I had a window of opportunity to serve 
my community, and I thought I could 
do a decent job. 
There is a verse in the Bible, Luke 
12:48 which says, ‘‘to whom much is 
given, much shall be required.’’ That 
verse has guided much of my decision-
making. God has blessed me with a lit-
tle bit of talent and an awful lot of life 
experiences that I thought qualified me 
to do this job. 
There is often an easy path in life, 
but rarely is it the right path to walk. 
I have done my very best to use my

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5930 
November 18, 2020 
Judeo-Christian principles to guide my 
life and my time in Congress. The work 
that I have been able to do has been ex-
tremely gratifying. 
This institution is important, Madam 
Speaker. It is enshrined in our Con-
stitution. The job that you and I do is 
important. You and I, however, are not 
particularly important outside that 
job. 
We use the words ‘‘thank you’’ across 
a wide spectrum of emotions. We say 
thank you for opening the door, thank 
you 
for 
picking 
up 
something 
I 
dropped. The comments I am about to 
make are at the other end of that spec-
trum. 
I could not have done what I have 
been able to do, and I certainly could 
not have succeeded as well as I have, 
without the steadfast, loving support 
from my wife, Suzanne Conaway. Su-
zanne has stood by my side at more 
events than I can imagine. She has lis-
tened to more town hall meetings and 
stump speeches than anyone should 
ever have to listen to. She has hand-
written some 8,500 thank you notes 
over the last 18 years. And she has, of 
course, put up with the hectic schedule 
you and I get to live under. Her faithful 
support means more than I can put 
into words. Thank you, Suzanne. 
The people of the 11th District of 
Texas are good and decent and kind, 
hardworking, honest Texans who have 
trusted me to do right by them for the 
past 16 years. 
Madam Speaker, when you and I ask 
for someone to vote for us or when any-
body asks someone to represent some-
one, we are basically asking them to 
trust us. Trust us to go do something 
on their behalf day in and day out. You 
and I will make hundreds and thou-
sands of decisions that will never get 
any input from the folks back home. 
They simply trust you and I to do it 
right. 
That trust is earned over a long pe-
riod of time, and it will evaporate in a 
nanosecond if you or I screw up some-
thing in that regard. 
Trust is held in high regard in west 
Texas, and I have been honored to have 
that trust from the folks in District 11 
for 16 years. 
No Member of Congress gets to do 
what I have been able to do by them-
selves. It simply doesn’t happen. There 
are hundreds and hundreds of people 
across District 11 that have played a 
direct role in the successes I have had 
in Congress. I thank the folks in Dis-
trict 11. 
I have also been blessed with the best 
staff any Member could ever ask for. 
My staff in the district is responsible 
for 
helping 
countless 
constituents 
navigate 
the 
Federal 
Government 
through their superb casework. 
Madam Speaker, I can’t tell you the 
number of times I have been confronted 
by a happy constituent, whose life is 
just a little less difficult based on 
something one of my constituents’ 
service folks has done on their behalf. 
The great news is they think I did it. I 
didn’t do it. My great team on the 
ground did it. They do all the hard 
work, and I get the credit. It is great 
being a Member of Congress. 
My professional staff in D.C. contrib-
utes mightily across the entire spec-
trum, providing counsel on every topic 
imaginable. All of my committee staff 
over the years, including the House 
Ethics Committee—which is a thank-
less job—the terrific job that the House 
Intelligence Committee staffers do to 
help me navigate the Russia investiga-
tion, and most notably, the out-
standing folks at the House Agri-
culture Committee, who have done in-
credible work for me and production 
agriculture and rural America over the 
last 6 years, including, Madam Speak-
er, passing a farm bill the same cal-
endar year that it was introduced. 
Thank you to the best staff and the 
most loyal staff any Member ever had. 
To my fellow Members of Congress 
and the new representatives-elect who 
all will take that new oath of office 
next January, remember that your 
word is your bond. It is irreplaceable. 
Wisdom is not only knowing when 
you are not the smartest person in the 
room but bringing that person on to 
your team. That technique has worked 
extremely well for me. Be an honest 
broker, no matter who you are talking 
to. 
And, Members, protect this institu-
tion. It is worth fighting for. It is en-
shrined in our Constitution. And never, 
ever do anything to bring discredit to 
this House. 
b 1900 
Madam Speaker, our Nation faces 
some incredible challenges. We have 
heard a description of the pandemic 
and the wreck that it is causing across 
this country. 
We face a debt crisis, a looming, 
pending debt crisis that will soon 
swamp this Nation if we don’t begin to 
address those hard comments. 
We face a great power competition 
with China and, to some extent, with 
Russia. 
But I personally don’t believe those 
are the most threatening and imme-
diate threats that our Nation faces. 
Our Nation faces a moral decline and 
the inability to self-govern. 
John Adams wrote that only a moral 
and religious people can, in fact, self- 
govern. This form of governance is un-
suitable for anyone else. 
There are things going on in this 
country that God cannot bless. We use 
the words ‘‘God bless you’’ and ‘‘God 
bless this country’’ often. We sing it in 
songs. We use it particularly casually, 
almost like the thank-yous I talked 
about earlier. But each time you hear 
those three words, ‘‘God bless you,’’ 
think about what we are asking God to 
bless, whether what is going on in this 
Nation is, in fact, blessable. 
Since 1973, we have killed over 62 mil-
lion young babies in this country. God 
can’t bless a nation that long con-
tinues on that path. 
There are lots of other things that 
are going on in this Nation that God 
simply cannot bless. At some point in 
time, He is going to say enough is 
enough, and He will put this USA 
through the same crucible that he put 
the nation of Israel through through-
out the Old Testament when they 
walked the path that we are walking. I 
fear that is coming upon us. 
There is a solution, though, to that 
issue. The solution lies in the promise 
that God has made us in 2 Chronicles 
7:14, which says: 
If my people, who are called by my 
name, will humble themselves, turn 
from their wicked ways, seek my face, 
and pray, I will hear them from Heav-
en. I will forgive their sins, and I will 
heal their land. 
I will argue tonight that our Nation 
has never needed healing more than we 
do tonight except during the Civil War. 
That is the promise that God has 
made. That is also the solution that 
God provides us if we claim it, if we 
claim it as an individual, if we claim it 
as communities, if we claim it as a Na-
tion. 
Let’s be those people that will hum-
ble ourselves, turn from our wicked 
ways, seek God’s face, and pray. He 
will hear us from Heaven. He will for-
give our sins. And, Madam Speaker, He 
will heal our land. 
My time in Congress has been the ab-
solute highlight of my professional ca-
reer. I will miss wandering these halls 
late at night. I will miss looking up 
from my desk and seeing the Dome. 
But most of all, I will miss the col-
leagues who have turned into friends 
and my staff, who has become family. 
Madam Speaker, God bless each one 
of you, God bless Texas, and may God 
continue to bless the United States of 
America. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader is recog-
nized. 
SENATOR CHUCK GRASSLEY 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
yesterday something extremely rare 
happened here in this Chamber, some-
thing so unusual that only a few of us 
current Senators had ever seen it be-
fore—a rollcall vote that did not in-
clude the name of our President pro 
tempore and distinguished colleague 
from Iowa, Senator CHUCK GRASSLEY. 
Before yesterday, the senior Senator 
from Iowa had not missed a single vote 
in this body since 1993, when he was in 
Iowa helping with historic flooding. 
Since then, across 27 years and 8,927 
votes, Senator GRASSLEY had shown up 
for every single one. It is by far the 
longest such streak in Senate history. 
Senator GRASSLEY broke the previous 
record back in January of 2016 and ob-
viously continued to extend it for al-
most 5 years. 
This show of diligence and dedication 
is remarkable by any measure. But be-
cause of who Senator GRASSLEY is, it 
hasn’t seemed remarkable at all. That 
incredible 
commitment 
to 
serving 
Iowans and working around the clock 
is just who our colleague is. That devo-
tion is just his daily routine. 
This is the Senator who manages to 
visit all 99 counties in Iowa every sin-
gle year. We call it the ‘‘full GRASS-
LEY.’’ Nearly 9,000 consecutive Senate 
votes must have seemed like a cake-
walk by comparison. 
But yesterday, our colleague’s streak 
had to be temporarily placed on hold. 
On the advice of doctors, after close 
contact with someone who had later 
tested positive for the coronavirus, 
Senator GRASSLEY began self-quaran-
tining yesterday morning. 
Later in the day, our colleague let us 
know he had tested positive himself, 
underscoring why his good judgment to 
follow doctor’s orders while awaiting 
his test result was the right decision. 
So our colleague’s historic run has 
been put on pause for the same reason 
that it was compiled in the first 
place—leadership, service to others, 
and a determination to set the right 
example. 
On Monday, in his floor remarks, our 
colleague reminded all Americans of 
our duties in this moment: 
Although 
promising 
vaccines 
for 
the 
coronavirus are on the horizon, it is more 
important than ever to stop the surge. . . . 
Wash your hands; limit your activity outside 
your household; social distance; wear a 
mask. We are going to get through this to-
gether, but we need everyone to do their 
part.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7048 
November 18, 2020 
All of the Senate’s thoughts and 
prayers are with our distinguished col-
league, who reported yesterday evening 
that he still feels fine. We hope that 
will remain the case. Certainly, if any 
Member of this body has the good 
health and stamina to kick the virus to 
the curb, it is Senator GRASSLEY. 
So we will look forward to seeing him 
soon. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Madam President, now on an entirely 
different matter, Senate Republicans 
have spent months—months—trying to 
get another bipartisan rescue package 
passed and signed into law for the 
American people. 
For months, our position has been 
entirely consistent. We want to reach 
agreement on all the areas where com-
promise is well within reach, send hun-
dreds of billions of dollars to urgent 
and uncontroversial programs, and let 
Washington argue over the rest later. 
There is no reason why doing right 
by struggling families should wait 
until we resolve every difference on 
every issue. But, unfortunately, both 
Speaker PELOSI
and the Democratic 
leader have been equally consistent, 
and they don’t think Congress should 
do anything at all—anything, unless 
they get to cash out a far-left ideolog-
ical wish list, including things with 
zero relationship to the present crisis. 
They have continued to insist that 
Congress must pass their so-called He-
roes Act or do nothing at all. 
The problem is that their proposal is 
a 
multitrillion-dollar 
laughingstock 
that never had a chance of becoming 
law. 
Let’s recall what Speaker PELOSI’s 
own Members said when she first re-
leased this proposal: 
I think the Heroes Act went too far. It got 
loaded up with a bunch of political wish list 
things. 
This is Washington politics at its worst 
. . . a partisan wish list. 
It’s a middle finger to the American peo-
ple. 
These are all reactions of House 
Democrats. And no wonder, because 
here are just some of the demands the 
Speaker will not drop: a massive tax 
cut specifically for wealthy people in 
blue States; a colossal slush fund for 
consistently mismanaged State and 
city governments, with no linkage to 
actual pandemic needs. 
These things are included, but they 
managed to completely leave out—lis-
ten to this—leave out entirely any new 
funding for a second round of the job- 
saving Paycheck Protection Program— 
something we made sure to include in 
every Republican offering. They want 
to spend $3 trillion but couldn’t find 
one cent—one cent—of new money for 
the job-saving program that has kept 
small businesses afloat from coast to 
coast. 
Oh, and by the way, because the far- 
left decided in the summertime they 
didn’t much like the men and women of 
law enforcement anymore, between the 
first and second version of this pro-
posal, the Speaker literally took out— 
listen to this—took out hundreds of 
millions of dollars for hiring, equip-
ping, and training local law enforce-
ment. I guess by their account, the po-
lice don’t count as ‘‘Heroes’’ any 
longer. 
By playing all-or-nothing hardball 
with a proposal this radical, our col-
leagues have thus far guaranteed that 
American workers and families get 
nothing at all. 
The pace of our economic recovery 
and the promise of vaccines on the ho-
rizon give us reasons for major hope, 
but we are nowhere near—nowhere 
near—out of the woods yet. Vaccines 
will need to be distributed nationwide 
and quickly. Republicans’ targeted pro-
posal provided billions of dollars to 
make that happen, but Democrats 
blocked it. 
The PPP has helped millions of 
American workers and small businesses 
hang on thus far, but now, in the home 
stretch, they need more help. Repub-
licans’ targeted proposal would have 
renewed that lifeline for the hardest 
hit small businesses, but again, Demo-
crats blocked it. 
So think about it. We moved Heaven 
and Earth and spent mountains of 
money to help workers keep their jobs 
and help small businesses keep the 
lights on from the springtime all the 
way up to now, but now, after all that, 
with the end seemingly in sight, we 
might lose the hardest hit small busi-
nesses in the home stretch because 
Democrats have refused—refused—to 
let us continue helping. We kept family 
businesses 
alive 
for 
months 
and 
months, only to see some of them fail 
now, with vaccines on the horizon, be-
cause Democrats have blocked another 
round of PPP. 
Well, it is not too late to make a dif-
ference. Republicans stand ready to de-
liver this urgent aid. Let’s fund all the 
programs where there is not even real 
disagreement—just 
the 
ones 
where 
there is no disagreement—and let’s do 
it now. We just need Democrats to fi-
nally get serious about this. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Democratic leader is recog-
nized. 
2020 ELECTIONS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
first, let me join all of my colleagues 
in wishing the Senate pro tempore, the 
senior Senator from Iowa, Senator 
GRASSLEY, a speedy and quick recov-
ery. We know he is a strong man, and 
we have every confidence he will beat 
this back, as he has beaten many other 
adversities back in the past. 
Now, it has been nearly 2 weeks since 
every major news network called the 
Presidential election for Joe Biden. 
Preparations for the incoming Biden 
administration are well under way, and 
still—still—President Trump refuses to 
accept reality. 
This morning brought a fresh series 
of Presidential delusions on Twitter. 
President Trump declared—sometimes 
in capital letters—that the election 
was a fraud, a joke, and even unconsti-
tutional. Imagine that, an unconstitu-
tional 
election. 
That 
is 
because 
Trump’s ego is such, when he doesn’t 
win, everything is wrong, false, et 
cetera. 
President Trump, get out of your 
bubble. You lost. Joe Biden will be 
sworn in as the next President of the 
United States on January 20. There is 
nothing you can do to stop it. Get out 
of the bubble and work on a transition. 
Last 
night, 
continuing 
President 
Trump’s outrageous and dishonest be-
havior, President Trump fired our 
country’s chief election security offi-
cer, Chris Krebs, an honorable public 
servant, because he confirmed that our 
elections were secure. This reinforced 
the No. 1 rule of working for Donald 
Trump: You can never tell the truth. 
But no matter whom he fires or how 
many 
times 
he 
tweets, 
President 
Trump cannot change reality. He lost 
the Presidential election. Joe Biden 
will be the next President of the United 
States, and it is time for President 
Trump to quit the nonsense, admit the 
truth, and move on. Anytime my Re-
publican colleagues want to tell him 
that would be fine by me. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Madam President, now, on another 
matter entirely, the country is facing 
the worst phase of the pandemic. As 
the number of new infections and hos-
pitalizations threaten, once again, to 
overwhelm 
the 
capacity 
of 
our 
healthcare system, we have to make 
sure that our nurses and doctors and 
all of our healthcare professionals have 
the PPE they need to protect them-
selves and their patients safely. 
We all remember the early days of 
the crisis, when healthcare profes-
sionals in some parts of the country 
were forced to jury-rig masks and 
gloves from spare clothing and bits of 
string. In my home State of New York, 
nursing homes alone were burning 
through 12 million pieces of PPE a 
week during the height of the pan-
demic in April. The recent surge in 
cases might bring us all back to or be-
yond the peak levels we saw earlier 
this year. We must do everything—ev-
erything—in our power to avoid a re-
peat of the widespread PPE shortages. 
So I am joining Senators MURRAY, 
PETERS, BALDWIN, and MURPHY to in-
troduce new legislation that authorizes 
$10 billion for the Strategic National 
Stockpile to purchase large quantities 
of PPE, including N95 respirators, 
gloves, gowns, face masks, face shields, 
and surgical masks. 
The N95 masks don’t need to be worn 
by every American on a daily basis, but

November 18, 2020 
they provide a much higher degree of 
protection to our healthcare profes-
sionals and frontline workers who are 
exposed to the virus more regularly. 
That is why we need the Defense Pro-
duction Act and get those N95 masks in 
the hands of any healthcare profes-
sional who needs it. 
We are calling, once again, for the 
Defense Production Act, grossly under-
utilized by the current administration, 
to be invoked in order to expand indus-
trial capacity to meet surging demand. 
Our bill will create a $1 billion grant 
program for small business to retool 
their facilities to assist in the produc-
tion of PPE. 
For months, our communities have 
been held together by the quiet her-
oism of nurses, doctors, caregivers, and 
essential workers. We call them front-
line workers because they are like our 
soldiers, putting their own lives at risk 
to protect the lives of others. And just 
as we would never send our troops into 
battle without helmets or bulletproof 
vests, we must never leave our front-
line workers to battle diseases without 
the N95 masks they need, as well as 
other PPE like gloves and gowns that 
serve as their armor. 
So, our bill, the Protect our Heroes 
Act of 2020, should be part of the bipar-
tisan discussion on the next COVID re-
lief bill. Our bill will allow frontline 
workers to get the N95 masks they 
need and deserve. We urge bipartisan 
support for this proposal. The truth is, 
there should be a great urgency to get 
something done here in Congress to de-
feat the virus, save American lives, and 
forestall even greater pain for our 
workers and businesses. 
Speaker PELOSI and I had negotiated 
for months, in good faith, with the 
Trump administration to find an agree-
ment on a COVID relief bill. Democrats 
lowered our proposal by $1.2 trillion to 
move closer to our Republican counter-
parts. Meanwhile, Leader MCCONNELL 
and Senate Republicans refuse to take 
part in those negotiations. Instead, the 
Republican leader has asked the Senate 
to accept several inadequate partisan 
proposals. In every version of the 
COVID relief legislation that the Re-
publican majority has put on the floor, 
there have been poison pills included to 
ensure the bill will fail. 
Many Members of the Republican 
Senate caucus want to spend no dol-
lars, so Leader MCCONNELL has to twist 
himself in pretzels to put any bill on 
the floor, and the only way he can get 
support of his caucus is to put poison 
pills in so he can wink at them and 
say: Hey, this won’t pass. 
So Senate Republicans are seeing 
this pandemic as an opportunity to try 
and make it harder to hold corpora-
tions accountable when they put their 
workers at risk. I heard the Republican 
leader this morning give the same long, 
tired speech that pretends as if Demo-
crats haven’t been trying to negotiate 
with 
our 
colleagues 
and 
that 
we 
haven’t been trying over and over 
again to get our Republican colleagues 
to talk with us. 
The leader’s position hasn’t changed 
over the past few months. He said it 
again this morning. It is the Repub-
lican proposal or nothing at all. I 
would remind the Republican leader 
that the House has passed a bill. The 
Senate has not, and the only Senate 
bill that the leader brings to the floor 
gets zero Democratic support. And yet 
the Republican leader’s position is, if 
you don’t take my bill, get nothing, 
when he knows his bill can’t pass the 
Senate and can’t pass the House. It is a 
feeble position, as the pandemic rages, 
and it just doesn’t fly. 
We Democrats lowered our proposal 
by over $1 trillion to move closer in ne-
gotiations, and what did Senate Repub-
licans do? They didn’t move in our di-
rection. They moved further away by 
cutting their already inadequate pro-
posal in half, making compromise even 
more difficult. 
So, look, we need to reset the con-
versation here. The country is in des-
perate straits, maybe more desperate 
than it has ever been in this crisis. The 
consensus view of economists and ex-
perts is that the country requires a 
substantial injection of aid: meaning-
ful relief to our schools, small busi-
nesses, the unemployed, State and 
local governments, our healthcare sys-
tem, among other things. These are not 
frivolous. These are not someone’s 
whim. These are the desperate needs of 
people crying out for help. Almost none 
of them were covered adequately in the 
Republican leader’s bill. 
This morning, New York’s MTA an-
nounced a cut to subways and buses—a 
flashing warning sign about how des-
perately we need transit relief. We are 
going to fight hard for transit relief. 
None of it is in Leader MCCONNELL’s 
bill. 
The two vaccines in development 
must be produced and distributed on a 
massive scale, and they must reach un-
derserved and minority communities. 
The House Heroes bill goes much fur-
ther in getting that done than the 
McConnell bill. It is time for our two 
parties to sit down together and hash 
out a compromise on a bill that meets 
the needs of the American people. We 
have been going around in circles—the 
Republican leader, in particular—for 
far too long with nothing new added to 
the conversation. 
So Speaker PELOSI and I have for-
mally invited the Republican leader 
and our Senate Republican colleagues 
to join us in bipartisan talks. Our col-
leagues face a simple choice: They can 
put the election behind them and work 
across the aisle to get something done 
or they can remain in their partisan 
corner defending the poisonous lies of a 
flailing President refusing to do the 
people’s desperately needed business. 
I yield the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority whip is recognized. 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I 
think it is important to point out that 
as we discuss the issue of coronavirus 
relief, that Senate Republicans have 
now not once but twice brought a bill 
to the floor of the U.S. Senate that en-
joyed the support of a majority of U.S. 
Senators. There were 52 Senators who 
voted for coronavirus relief not once 
but twice—once in September and once 
in October. Not a single Democrat 
voted for it. 
The Democratic leader was just talk-
ing about the House of Representa-
tives, where they passed a bill. Yes, 
they passed a bill. It didn’t have a sin-
gle Republican on it. It was a massive 
multitrillion-dollar bill, liberal wish 
list, that included all kinds of things 
like bailouts for blue States the tax-
payers would have to finance, including 
tax cuts for millionaires in places like 
New York and California, and left a lot 
of the American people who are really 
suffering from the coronavirus holding 
the bag. 
We believe that there are things that 
need to be done, and just because we 
can’t do everything that the Demo-
crats want to do on their liberal wish 
list, that we should do something, and 
Republicans came together behind a 
bill. They increased the support above 
and beyond what unemployed workers 
would normally get through unemploy-
ment insurance—increased that benefit 
by $300 a week. It also provided a sig-
nificant amount of funding for schools 
as they continue to deal with the cost 
of trying to stay open safely. It put sig-
nificant investments into vaccines, 
testings, therapeutics, support for pro-
viders, and all the things that will help 
on the healthcare front to defeat this 
virus. And, of course, it provided infu-
sion of additional dollars for the Pay-
check Protection Program, which has 
been so successful in assisting our 
small businesses as they weather and 
survive this crisis to try and keep their 
workers employed and keep their busi-
nesses up and operating and keep our 
economy operating in this country. 
Those are all things—all things—for 
which there is bipartisan support and 
on which there should be votes, not 
just among Republicans in the Senate 
but among Democrats as well, but un-
fortunately the Democrats have opted 
not to sit down in a reasonable way and 
come up with a reasonable proposal. 
The bill that came over from the 
House of Representatives that they 
continue to tout is something that 
would never pass in the Senate, and it 
would never get signed into law. 
The bill that Senate Republicans 
passed—I shouldn’t say passed but got 
majority support for here in the Senate 
not once but twice—would, in fact, get 
signed into law and is something that 
could pass here in the Senate and I be-
lieve in the House of Representatives, 
too, because they are all things that 
enjoy broad bipartisan support. 
The difference is that our bill was 
targeted to those areas which need the 
support the most. It was fiscally re-
sponsible, recognizing that we have a 
$26 trillion debt growing by the day 
and that every dollar we spend is a bor-
rowed dollar from our children and 
grandchildren.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7050 
November 18, 2020 
It is so important that when we do 
this, we do this in a way that is 
thoughtful, 
deliberative, 
reasonable, 
and with an eye toward making sure 
we are getting a good return for the 
American taxpayer and delivering as-
sistance in a targeted way to those 
folks who need it the most—unem-
ployed workers; those who are em-
ployed; the small businesses that em-
ploy them; the healthcare frontline 
workers who are out there every day 
fighting this fight against this virus, 
making sure they have the PPE to pro-
tect them—and then, of course, the im-
portant investments we are making in 
vaccines and therapeutics and testing 
and all the things that will help defeat 
this; money for schools, colleges, uni-
versities, elementary and high school 
students and faculty and administra-
tion—those who are trying to keep our 
kids in school, keep them educated by 
dealing with a lot of additional costs 
related to providing that education in 
a safe way. 
Those are all things on which there is 
broad bipartisan agreement. We could 
pass it today. We could pass it today in 
the Senate, but the Democrats insist 
on a liberal wish list, which includes a 
multitrillion-dollar 
proposal—multi-
trillion-dollar proposal—with a liberal 
wish list, an agenda that in many cases 
has nothing to do with combating or 
fighting the coronavirus but simply is 
an attempt to deliver on a liberal agen-
da for their political base. So let’s just 
make that point very clearly here 
when we talk about what we should be 
doing. 
I believe what we should be doing is 
sitting down and working on a reason-
able bill, a targeted bill, a fiscally re-
sponsible bill. Republicans have been 
more than willing to do that and more 
than willing to compromise, but the 
Democrats both in the House and the 
Senate continue to insist upon a multi-
trillion-dollar bill that consists, again, 
of a bunch of liberal wish list items— 
taxpayer bailouts for blue States, tax 
cuts for millionaires across this coun-
try, putting money into diversity stud-
ies on cannabis—instead of the tar-
geted things, the things that are really 
going to be necessary to help the 
American people and our economy re-
cover from the coronavirus. 
SENATOR CHUCK GRASSLEY 
Madam President, as I begin today, I 
just want to say that our thoughts are 
with Senator CHUCK GRASSLEY after his 
coronavirus diagnosis. It was a strange 
day in the Senate yesterday with 
CHUCK GRASSLEY not voting, because 
he broke a 27-year-long streak of show-
ing up for every single vote. We are 
praying for his swift recovery and his 
speedy return to the Senate. 
JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS 
Madam President, a couple of weeks 
ago, we confirmed one of the most 
qualified Supreme Court Justices in 
living memory. This week, we are con-
firming more district court judges, 
bringing the total number of judges we 
have confirmed over the last 4 years to 
nearly 230. 
Confirming good judges is one of the 
most important responsibilities that 
we have as Senators, and it is a respon-
sibility that I take very seriously. In 
fact, one of the main reasons I was first 
elected to the Senate was to make sure 
that outstanding judicial nominees 
were confirmed to the Federal bench. 
It is hard to imagine now, but con-
firming judges used to be a pretty bi-
partisan affair. Presidents of both par-
ties generally got the majority of their 
judicial nominees confirmed to the 
bench. But all of that changed back in 
the early 2000s. 
After President George W. Bush’s 
election, Democrats decided that the 
President’s judicial nominees might 
not deliver the results that Democrats 
wanted, and so they decided to adopt a 
new strategy: blocking judicial nomi-
nees on a regular basis. That became 
the routine here in the Senate. 
I was one of the many Americans 
who were upset by the blockade of im-
pressive, well-qualified nominees, and 
it was one of the main reasons that I 
ran for the Senate in 2004. I promised 
South Dakotans that if they elected 
me, I would help put outstanding, im-
partial judges on the bench. I am proud 
to have delivered on that promise. 
The list of outstanding judicial nomi-
nees we have confirmed over the past 4 
years is long. We have confirmed bril-
liant, accomplished men and women 
with superb qualifications, but most 
importantly, we have confirmed men 
and women who understand the proper 
role of a judge, who know that the job 
of a judge is to interpret the law, not 
make the law, to call balls and strikes, 
not to rewrite rules of the game. 
It is here that Republican judicial 
philosophy diverges from the judicial 
philosophy of a lot of Democrats. Re-
publicans believe that the job of a 
judge is to look at the law and the Con-
stitution and then rule based on how 
those things apply to the facts in a par-
ticular case. Judges, we believe, should 
leave their politics and their personal 
opinions at the courtroom door and 
base their opinions solely on what the 
law and the Constitution say. 
For Democrats, on the other hand, 
what matters most is not how judges 
reach their conclusion, not whether 
they apply the law, but what outcomes 
they deliver. If a judge can deliver the 
right outcome by following the plain 
meaning of the law, then great, but if 
she can’t, then Democrats want a judge 
to reach beyond the plain meaning of 
the statute to deliver what Democrats 
see as an appropriate result. 
Then-Presidential candidate Barack 
Obama back in 2007 said: 
[W]hat you’ve got to look at is, what is in 
the justice’s heart? What’s their broader vi-
sion of what America should be? 
Well, that is a very dangerous stand-
ard. It is not the job of a judge to im-
pose his or her ‘‘broader vision of what 
America should be’’; it is the job of a 
judge to determine what the law says 
and then apply the law to the par-
ticular case before him. 
President Obama famously said that 
he wanted judges with empathy. Well, 
that is all very well until you are a 
party in a case, and you have the law 
on your side, but the judge empathizes 
with the opposing party. What happens 
then? 
The only way to preserve the rule of 
law in this country is to confirm judges 
who understand that their allegiance 
must be to the law and to the Constitu-
tion, not to their personal feelings, 
their personal beliefs, their political 
beliefs, or their ‘‘broader vision of what 
America should be.’’ Otherwise, you re-
place the rule of law with the rule of a 
bunch of individual judges. 
So I am very thankful that we have 
confirmed so many judges who under-
stand that the job of a judge is to apply 
the law, not make it, and who won’t 
try to usurp the role of Congress by 
legislating from the Federal bench. I 
thank the majority leader for making 
judicial confirmations such a priority. 
I look forward to confirming more out-
standing judicial nominees this week. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The Senator from Wyoming. 
2020 ELECTIONS 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor to talk about what 
the voters of America told the elected 
representatives in Washington about 
the election earlier this month. There 
has been a lot of analysis about what 
happened this year in the elections— 
who got what right, who got what 
wrong. The pollsters, the prognos-
ticators, and the pundits—well, they 
are already taking a beating for their 
many wrong predictions. 
The American people in States all 
across this country and, certainly, in 
Wyoming, rejected this far-left agenda. 
They saw what the Democrats were of-
fering, and they said: No, thank you. 
Voters looked at the violent leftwing 
protests that have wrecked large cities 
and small cities across the country. 
People saw the death, injuries, and de-
struction of property, and Americans 
went to the polls and said: No, thank 
you. They rejected the Democrats’ 
calls to defund the police; rebuffed the 
Democrats’ threats to pack the Su-
preme Court; and said no to one-size- 
fits-all, 
government-run 
healthcare. 
They snubbed the Democrats’ embrace 
of the Green New Deal and rejected 
this far-left plan to end American en-
ergy production. Basically, Americans 
said no. 
Many Democrats ran on this far-left 
agenda. They lost despite spending 
hundreds of millions of dollars trying 
to convince Americans otherwise. The 
Democrats must be asking themselves: 
What did we get wrong? 
No matter how much the Democrat 
Party pushes and their candidates 
push, America is not a far-left country. 
Americans don’t want to blow up the 
Senate or the Supreme Court. They 
don’t want to add more States to the 
Union or more Justices to the Court. 
They don’t want to kill our energy 
economy and the good jobs it provides. 
People do not want to pay $10 a gallon 
for gasoline when they fill up under the 
Green New Deal. They don’t want more 
government meddling in their personal 
healthcare decisions. 
I know what the people of Wyoming 
want, and Members ought to know this. 
Americans want jobs and security. 
They want to get back to work in a 
free enterprise economy, not a socialist 
one. They want their kids back in 
school safely to make sure they don’t 
fall further behind. People are smart 
enough to know that the free stuff for 
everyone means the American taxpayer 
will be left footing the bill. 
Between now and the end of the year, 
we have very important things to do 
for the Nation in this body, the U.S. 
Senate. We need to fund the govern-
ment. We need to pass the National De-
fense Authorization Act. We need to 
confirm well-qualified nominees to the 
Federal judiciary. Senate Republicans 
are ready to get that work done. There 
is also work to be done in our fight 
against the coronavirus. 
The Democrat House has played poli-
tics with American lives and liveli-
hoods for months now. With the elec-
tion behind us, I hope it will take a 
more sensible approach to this Nation’s 
most pressing problem right now. For 
months, Senate Republicans put for-
ward targeted proposals—first in Sep-
tember, again in October—that pro-
vided comprehensive coronavirus re-
lief, that focused on the coronavirus. 
There were 52 Republicans who came to 
the floor of this Senate and voted in 
favor of the proposal. Not a single 
Democrat voted for it. It is our plan to 
get people back to work, to get kids 
back to school safely, and to put the 
disease behind us. 
Just last week, Pfizer announced a 
vaccine that could be 90 percent effec-
tive 
in 
the 
fight 
against 
the 
coronavirus. This morning, it found 
out, with more testing and more time, 
that it will be, actually, 941⁄2 percent 
effective. Now Moderna and the Na-
tional Institutes of Health have devel-
oped a vaccine that is almost 95 per-
cent effective. There are four other 
vaccines in the trials, and one of the 
Members of this body, the Senator 
from Ohio, is part of the trial of one of 
those. I believe additional vaccines will 
be coming down the pipeline as well. 
It was a front-page story yesterday 
in every major paper in America—the 
good news about vaccines and that the 
light at the end of the tunnel of the 
coronavirus is upon us. 
Today there was an announcement of 
an at-home test for coronavirus—very, 
very promising. 
But when we think about the vaccine 
and why this all happened, Congress 
wisely invested $18 billion for vaccine 
treatment and for research, and it is 
paying off. 
The Governor of New York, astonish-
ingly, called this bad news. He said this 
is bad news. It had to do with the fact 
that this is coming out now, and he 
wanted it to wait for a couple of 
months, after a Presidential inaugura-
tion. 
Why is it bad news that, through in-
novation and the work of the Cures 
Act, which came out of this body under 
the Republican majority and was then 
accepted by unanimous consent in the 
House—why is it bad news that we may 
be able to save millions, if not tens of 
millions, of lives all around the world? 
Why is it bad news, as the Governor of 
New York calls it? Why is it bad news 
that American invention and innova-
tion and an investment by this body 
has brought about such a tremendous— 
what I would call as a doctor—modern 
medical miracle? 
Now, we still need to provide addi-
tional funding for vaccine distribution, 
and there is going to be a briefing to-
morrow for all the Senators on both 
sides of the aisle with Operation Warp 
Speed to talk with the heads of re-
search and distribution about how to 
make sure we can continue on this 
path to success—a path that the New 
York Times yesterday described as one 
that could lead to 20 million people 
being vaccinated before the end of this 
year. Bad news, says the Governor of 
New York, because it came this year 
rather than after January 20. 
It is distressing that an elected offi-
cial would behave that way, in such a 
callous manner toward the lives, as 
well as the livelihood, of so many 
Americans. 
We still have work to do. At every 
turn, Democrats have blocked our

path. They are keeping us stuck and 
America stuck in this coronavirus cri-
sis by demanding funding for things 
unrelated 
to 
coronavirus, 
per 
the 
Speaker of the House. You say: Oh, no, 
she wanted this $3 trillion for all sorts 
of things unrelated to coronavirus. She 
has more money in that bill to send di-
rect paychecks to illegal immigrants— 
people in this country illegally—than 
she does for coronavirus vaccines. 
That is the kind of opposition and 
leftist thinking that we have been run-
ning into here in this body and that the 
American people rejected on election 
day and said: No, we want a path for-
ward. We want to continue the great 
American comeback. We want our jobs. 
We want our kids. We want that path 
forward. 
There is still more work to be done, 
and we are ready to do it. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
LANKFORD). The Senator from Oregon. 
REMEMBERING PRIVATE FIRST CLASS DELBERT 
LITTRELL 
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to recognize 
the distinguished service of one of Med-
ford, Oregon’s own and to ask my Sen-
ate colleagues to join me in support of 
the U.S. Marine Corps PFC Delbert 
Littrell’s honorary promotion to cor-
poral. 
It is an honorary promotion because 
it was 75 years ago, in World War II, 
that Mr. Littrell served in the 14th Ma-
rine Regiment, 4th Marine Division. 
His service was marked by a combat 
history of notable intensity and dura-
tion. He fought in five pivotal battles 
that together changed the tide of the 
war in the Pacific Theater: the Gilbert 
and Marshall Islands campaign, be-
tween November 1943 and February 
1944; the Battle of Saipan, between 
June 15, 1944, and July 9, 1944; the Bat-
tle of Tinian, between July 24, 1944, and 
August 1, 1944; the Battle of Iwo Jima, 
between February 19, 1945, and March 
26, 1945; and, fifth, the Battle of Oki-
nawa, between April 1, 1945, and June 
22, 1945. What an outstanding contribu-
tion to make to the fight for freedom, 
and what a remarkable bit of history 
to be part of. 
As 
administrative 
officers 
noted 
while evaluating him, Private First 
Class Littrell performed excellently 
time and again. He should have re-
ceived this promotion a long time ago. 
The units he served in, however, were 
under constant enemy bombardment, 
and the kinds of performance reports 
and administrative submissions that 
would have given him that promotion 
were often misplaced or incomplete in 
the midst of the rigorous amphibious 
assaults pivotal to the Allied victory. 
It wasn’t until earlier this year, 
three-quarters of a century later, that 
the Marine Corps Advisory Panel re-
viewed the comprehensive record of 
Mr. Littrell’s service to the Marine 
Corps and to the national security of 
the United States of America, and after 
reviewing the record, the Commandant 
of the Marine Corps recommended Del-
bert Littrell’s honorary promotion to 
the rank of corporal, which was en-
dorsed soon after by the Secretary of 
the Navy. 
Both of these leaders recognized Mr. 
Littrell’s unique contributions, with 
the Secretary of the Navy noting the 
indelible mark that Mr. Littrell has 
left on the proud history of the U.S. 
Marine Corps and the U.S. Navy. 
The State of Oregon and our entire 
Nation are proud of Delbert Littrell’s 
meritorious service throughout World 
War II. Mr. Littrell’s remarkable com-
bat history and his actions in support 
of freedom mean that this recognition 
is long overdue. 
I am proud that this son of Oregon, 
who I hope is watching right now, is fi-
nally receiving this special honor. 
Colleagues, I know that you join me 
in honoring, respecting, and appre-
ciating Delbert Littrell and his com-
mitment to the fight for freedom and 
his legacy of service to our Nation with 
the distinction of corporal in the U.S. 
Marine Corps. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. 
BROWN. 
Mr. 
President, 
the 
American people sent a clear message 
in this election. They want us to get to 
work to empower people with a plan to 
fight this virus and to get people back 
to work, back to school, and back to 
their lives. They gave President-Elect 
Biden a commanding 5-million vote 
victory to do that. It is time for us to 
get to work. 
We have had more than 1 million new 
cases just in the past week. Yet what 
does Leader MITCH MCCONNELL—what 
does he keep the Senate in session to 
do? He keeps the Senate in session and 
he puts essential workers at risk all to 
try to ram through an unqualified 
nominee who pretty much everybody in 
this body knows has no business serv-
ing on the Federal Reserve. 
Let’s be clear on what this is about. 
It is about our outgoing President— 
again, who lost the popular vote by 5 
million people and lost an electoral 
college by a landslide—trying to sabo-
tage our economic recovery on his way 
out the door. Yesterday, luckily, Sen-
ators of both parties rejected that ef-
fort. There were 80 million Ameri-
cans—most ever by a lot—who voted 
for stability in this election. Judy 
Shelton, the Trump nominee, promises 
more Trump chaos. 
You can’t say you support working 
people while putting someone in charge 
who has no problem whatsoever threat-
ening their jobs and their savings to 
push a bizarre intellectual agenda. She 
has no idea how to handle an economic 
crisis like the one we are in. Her posi-
tions aren’t conservative. They are not 
traditionally conservative, which we 
could debate. I would be willing to vote 
for conservatives, as I have before, if I 
thought they were qualified and their 
thinking was not so far, far right out of 
the mainstream. But her positions 
aren’t conservative; they are disquali-
fying. 
For three decades, she has advocated 
returning to the gold standard. No seri-
ous 
person—progressive, 
moderate, 
conservative—no serious person, left or 
right, still believes in the gold stand-
ard. She opposes FDIC, Federal deposit 
insurance—the insurance that protects 
your money when you put it in the 
bank. She has flip-flopped on these 
issues several times during her nomi-
nation. The only thing consistent she 
stands for is that she—no surprise— 
wants to do what Trump wants to do. 
But Americans have moved on from 
Donald Trump, 80 million strong. It is 
time for the Senate to move on from 
this failed nomination and this failed 
Presidency. 
This nomination was a waste of time. 
Look what we should have been doing 
instead. You all know that. Every mo-
ment we spend on unnecessary, un-
qualified nominees like this is time the 
Senate isn’t spending saving lives. It is 
time to get to work delivering results 
for the people whom we serve. 
We are watching hospitals fill up 
again from Oklahoma to Ohio. Our 
healthcare system is getting over-
whelmed. Gig workers and self-em-
ployed workers will lose their unem-
ployment insurance at the end of the 
year. Small businesses and local gov-
ernments are running out of money. It 
doesn’t have to be this bad. 
I have had enough and I think my 
colleagues in both parties have had 
enough of this false choice between 
saving the economy and combating the 
virus. We have to do both, and we can 
do both. It is not an unsolvable prob-
lem. We need the resources, and we 
have the resources. We are the great-
est, wealthiest country on Earth. We 
have some of the hardest workers, the 
best scientists, and the smartest doc-
tors. We have manufacturing expertise. 
We have natural resources. We have 
the world’s reserve currency. We have 
all those things. 
But President Trump and Senator 
MCCONNELL
want you to believe we 
can’t solve big problems; we can’t use 
our resources to help ordinary families; 
we can’t use our talents to produce 
tests and PPE; we can’t use our inge-
nuity to figure out how to open busi-
nesses and schools safely. They have 
essentially thrown up their hands and 
said: Sorry, America, you are on your 
own. They want you to believe this is 
the best America can do. In this elec-
tion, Americans made it clear they 
don’t buy that. They have had enough 
of aiming low and being told: We can’t 
do that. We can’t solve this problem; it 
is too big. We can’t govern. We can’t 
afford it.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7053 
November 18, 2020 
We can do big things. We did big 
things in World War II. We did big 
things combating communism. We did 
big things combating the Great Depres-
sion. We can do big things, and we can 
solve the problems for the people we 
serve. 
We did it this past spring. When we 
passed the CARES Act unanimously, 
one study said that 12 million people 
were kept out of poverty because of the 
$600 unemployment insurance, because 
of the help to small businesses, because 
we helped local governments, and be-
cause we helped people stay in their 
homes. There were 12 million people 
kept out of poverty. 
And the individual checks that were 
sent out, essentially, that expired in 
July and August. Since then, we have 
seen literally thousands of Americans a 
week falling into poverty. We kept mil-
lions of Americans from falling into 
poverty. We can do it again. We can 
keep 
Americans 
from 
losing 
their 
homes. We put in place an eviction 
moratorium. We gave people stimulus 
checks. We helped support the small 
businesses. Why are we not doing that 
again? Why does Senator MCCONNELL 
not want to do that again? 
We can rise to meet this moment. We 
can restore people’s faith in their gov-
ernment. We can’t allow President 
Trump—with 
his 
out-the-door 
ap-
pointees of people out of the main-
stream—we can’t allow him to sabo-
tage this economy and sabotage this 
government 
from 
within, 
creating 
chaos wherever he can, after voters de-
cisively, decisively, decisively rejected 
him with an electoral college landslide 
and rejected him by more than 5 mil-
lion votes. The voters have sent a clear 
message to all of us to get to work. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
THANKSGIVING 
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I am 
here today to join some of my fellow 
Senators here to talk about giving 
thanks to our military servicemembers 
and our veterans. Certainly, this is the 
thankful and grateful season that we 
are heading into. I think November has 
a lot of celebratory times both for our 
families and also for our veterans and 
military families. 
There is no question that this year 
has been most different and has looked 
very different than most. We have 
faced so many challenges and adjusted 
to a new norm of teleworking, tele-
health, telecommuting, all kinds of dif-
ferent ways to communicate on our de-
vices, 
FaceTiming—I 
do 
a 
lot 
of 
FaceTiming with my family—and other 
socially distanced activities, and I 
don’t see that coming to an end in the 
near future. But in the midst of all of 
this, we certainly do have so much to 
be grateful for and thankful for. 
A little fun fact is, I was actually 
born on Thanksgiving Day, and my 
parents always joked that they were 
going to name me ‘‘Thankful Ever 
Moore’’ because my last name was 
Moore at the time. And while my par-
ents, thankfully, decided to go a dif-
ferent route with my name, the mean-
ing still holds true today. 
It is true because I am thankful ever-
more for many things, especially, as I 
said, as we approach this Thanksgiving 
holiday, which is just around the cor-
ner. And it is going to look a little bit 
different for a lot of people, but that 
doesn’t mean it can’t be just as special. 
I am thankful evermore for my own 
personal good health and that of my 
family’s. I am very, very grateful and 
thankful for the first responders and 
the essential workers and now those 
workers in the hospitals who are really 
seeing a lot more patients coming in 
with COVID. I think about the grocery 
store workers, the truckers, and others 
who have really kept life moving dur-
ing those first months when we weren’t 
sure how to cope. 
I am very grateful for my wonderful 
community of Charleston, WV, where I 
have lived for over 40 years. And I am 
very grateful for the opportunity and 
the honor of a lifetime to represent the 
people of West Virginia in the U.S. 
Senate. I am grateful for our country 
and all of the great American thoughts 
and prayers that have carried many of 
us through these last few months. 
But I am especially thankful and 
grateful for the brave servicemembers 
who have put their lives on the line for 
our country year after year. I am 
grateful for the many veterans who 
have come before them and for the 
military families from all over the 
country who support the men and 
women who serve. 
Just last week, we celebrated Vet-
erans Day. It is always a very special, 
kind of solemn day in our State, and it 
is very well attended. This year we 
couldn’t have the parades. We did a lot 
of virtual celebrations, but it was no 
less special. This is a day to honor the 
men and women of the U.S. Armed 
Forces, both past and present, who 
have stood up to protect the freedoms 
that we hold dear. 
Our military is undoubtedly the very 
greatest in the world. From the ‘‘great-
est generation’’ to our younger soldiers 
who have fought in Iraq and Afghani-
stan, all of our soldiers have served ad-
mirably, and I am pleased to be serving 
with some who have not just served 
several years ago but in recent times. 
My home State of West Virginia has 
a long and proud history of answering 
the call of duty. I think we have the 
highest percentage per capita of mili-
tary veterans. 
I am the proud daughter of a World 
War II veteran and Purple Heart recipi-
ent. I grew up hearing stories about 
heroism displayed on and off the bat-
tlefield and have always been in awe of 
those who have served this country. 
Interestingly, too, in hearing my fa-
ther’s generation talk about their serv-
ice to the country, it was always 
framed in terms of duty and love of 
country and never in terms of ‘‘I had to 
do this’’ or ‘‘my parents thought it was 
a good idea.’’ These were things deeply 
held inside of those veterans who want-
ed to be a part of something that they 
held dear—their love of country, their 
love of freedom, their love of liberty. 
Woody Williams is one of those indi-
viduals who lives in my State. Many of 
you have seen them. He did the coin 
flip at the Super Bowl last year, I 
think. I continue to be inspired by him 
every day. I have mentioned him more 
than a few times on the Senate floor, 
as have all of our proud West Vir-
ginians. He is a proud West Virginian 
himself and is one of the last remain-
ing Medal of Honor recipients from 
World War II. He turned 97 last month. 
He valiantly fought in the Battle of 
Iwo Jima and rightfully earned the 
military’s most prestigious medal for 
his actions during the war. We are so 
proud of him and all he does with our 
Gold Star families. We have memorials 
all throughout our State and across the 
country, where Woody inspires not just 
those who have served but those who 
support and the families who support 
those who serve. So we are very proud 
to call him our West Virginia own. We 
did rename the VA center, hospital, in 
Huntington after Woody. We had a 
grand opening. It was really fun. 
Whether it be the Korean war, the 
Vietnam war, the first Gulf war, the 
ongoing fight against terrorism in the 
Middle East, and all the conflicts that 
America has fought, our country’s 
servicemembers have made the ulti-
mate sacrifices to keep our liberties in-
tact. 
Sometimes I think people get kind of 
down about where are we going, and it 
seems like we don’t have the optimism 
as a country. Do you know what? I am 
very optimistic because of what I am 
talking about today. 
Without the sacrifices of men and 
women, we would not be able to have 
these many freedoms, and it is impor-
tant to remember those men and 
women who have supportive family 
members. 
It is fitting also that this month is 
Military Family Appreciation Month. I 
think about the different moves or the 
nights of sleeplessness where you are 
unsure where your loved one is or how 
they are serving. This is a month to 
honor and recognize the sacrifices and 
challenges that military families face 
while supporting these brave men and 
women. 
Our military families do face unique 
challenges, and I think here in this 
body we take that into consideration 
quite a bit when we are looking at ap-
propriations and ways to help our fami-
lies. We are forever indebted to the sac-
rifices they make as their loved ones 
are fighting for our freedoms. They are 
often the ones behind the scenes, faced 
with difficult decisions every single 
day, and it is not easy.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7054 
November 18, 2020 
I have had the chance to meet many 
military families and hear about their 
experiences firsthand, and I have also 
heard from many of our own here, par-
ticularly Senator JONI
ERNST, who 
served as well and is a veteran. Senator 
MARTHA MCSALLY is also one of those 
whom I have been fascinated to hear 
her path and her service. 
Whether it is our current service-
members, veterans, or military fami-
lies, we are so grateful for their serv-
ice. It is because of their sacrifice and 
courage that we are able to enjoy these 
freedoms and liberties that we all cher-
ish. 
This Thanksgiving, take a moment 
to thank a veteran, a servicemember, 
and in this environment, a frontline 
worker, an essential worker—someone 
who is giving of themselves, sacrificing 
time with their family and, in some 
way, putting themselves in precarious 
situations with meeting the health 
challenges of COVID. 
At the same time, this should not be 
limited to just Thanksgiving or to Vet-
erans Day or Military Family Appre-
ciation Month. We should be doing this 
every day, and we should be making 
sure that those who serve know our ap-
preciation, 
that 
those 
who 
serve 
know—like the Senator from North Da-
kota, who is going to be after me—that 
their long history of service in our 
States—and, certainly, the Presiding 
Officer’s State as well—all across this 
country are not going without recogni-
tion. 
Without this great sacrifice and dedi-
cation to defending the flag, this coun-
try would not be what it is today. I 
mentioned how optimistic and grateful 
and thankful I am to be an American. 
While this year has thrown a lot our 
way, and it may be difficult to see 
some of the positives, we must always 
remember that we have much to be 
thankful for. 
Thank you. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Dakota. 
Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I want 
to acknowledge and express my appre-
ciation for the comments of the Sen-
ator from West Virginia, her father’s 
service, and the service of so many vet-
erans, as well as our colleagues here in 
the Senate who are here today saying 
thank you as we enter this time of 
Thanksgiving for our veterans and all 
those who serve today. We appreciate 
them so much. 
Of course, that is what this colloquy 
is all about, for us to come down today 
and to say thank you to our veterans, 
thank you to those who serve. I know 
the Presiding Officer’s State has a 
number of military bases and a large 
contingent 
of 
servicemembers, 
and 
they are truly fantastic. They are just 
amazing. We have two large Air Force 
bases in my State, and, of course, our 
Guard and others who serve in our 
military. I am impressed every day 
when I see what they do and how they 
serve. We are so deeply appreciative. 
That is what today is all about. It is 
thanking our veterans and making the 
point, I think, that we need to be there 
for our veterans and our servicemem-
bers every day, not just on Veterans 
Day, but that we need to be out there 
every day saying thank you for all that 
they do for us—and to their families— 
and to always keep in our hearts and 
our prayers all of those who are de-
ployed around the world today keeping 
us safe. 
In my State of North Dakota, we 
have a rich tradition of service. I am so 
proud of all of our North Dakotans who 
have served in the military and serve 
today. 
Since I was Governor of North Da-
kota, from 2000 through 2010, and even 
since I have been here in the Senate, I 
don’t think I have ever missed partici-
pating at home on Veterans Day in 
ceremonies for our servicemembers. 
Really, because we were in session last 
week, this was the first time in, I 
think, more than 20 years that I wasn’t 
able to attend services at home for our 
veterans on Veterans Day. So what I 
did is I went over to Arlington Ceme-
tery and spent some time there. 
I also went to the U.S. Marine Corps 
Memorial, and I particularly wanted to 
go over to the Marine Corps Memorial 
because my father was a marine. Of 
course, for his life—he died when he 
was 87 years old, but throughout his 
life, you could never say he was a ma-
rine because once a marine, always a 
marine. So even when he was in his 
eighties, he would say he still is a ma-
rine. If you said ‘‘was a marine,’’ then 
he would get mad at you, but now that 
he has passed, I can say he was a ma-
rine. But he was awfully proud of his 
service. 
As I looked at that Marine Corps Me-
morial, it made me think of him. It 
just is, again, a recognition for all of us 
of how much we owe our veterans. 
So it is about thanking them and ac-
knowledging them, but it is also very 
important that we show our gratitude 
in other ways, by making sure that our 
Armed Service forces, members, as well 
as all of our veterans receive the care, 
the 
benefits, 
the 
recognition, 
the 
things that our Nation has promised 
them for their service. 
We need to follow through on those 
things. In this Congress we have 
worked to do that, and we need to con-
tinue to work to do that. 
Some of the things we have been able 
to do are work to strengthen the VA’s 
ability to provide veterans with a con-
tinuum of care so that not only do they 
have access to the medical care they 
need, but they also have that con-
tinuum of care as they get older. 
We talk about our World War II gen-
eration, America’s ‘‘greatest genera-
tion,’’ as laid out in Tom Brokaw’s 
book and that famous acknowledge-
ment of all that they did in World War 
II. So many of them, of course, we are 
losing now, and it highlights the need 
to make sure that we have the con-
tinuum of care there for them, both 
care in terms of nursing home care and 
also home-based care as well. We need 
to make sure that those options are 
available to them. 
We also need to recognize that mem-
bers of our military suffer injuries both 
seen and unseen. There are the wounds 
that you can see, but then there are 
also the wounds, the battle scars of 
war, that you can’t see. 
In terms of what the VA does for our 
veterans, we need to make sure that 
the mental healthcare and the suicide 
prevention programs are in place there 
as well. Last month the Commander 
John Scott Hannon Veterans Mental 
Health Care Improvement Act was 
signed into law, and I was pleased to be 
able to cosponsor that legislation, and 
that legislation will help advance a 
more comprehensive approach to ad-
dress the tragedy of veteran suicide. 
It also expands access to alternative 
treatment options like hyperbaric oxy-
gen therapy, or HBOT, for veterans 
who have not been able to benefit or re-
cover using traditional therapies for 
post-traumatic stress. 
Last year, working with others, I was 
able to secure for the Fargo VA des-
ignation as the fifth location in the Na-
tion for an HBOT pilot program, and 
we recently extended that program for 
a longer period of time and added addi-
tional service area in Jamestown, ND, 
as well. 
I have to say, our VA veterans 
healthcare facility in Fargo is second 
to none. They do a tremendous job. I 
talk to veterans who go there not only 
from North Dakota but from much of 
Minnesota, and they really appreciate 
it. The care there is high level. 
Sometimes we hear these stories and 
have great concern about veterans’ 
care facilities where they are not doing 
a good job, and we need to address 
that, but I can say that our Fargo, ND, 
VA healthcare facility is tops. And the 
veterans I talk to on a regular basis 
tell me that, so we are very appre-
ciative of all the healthcare providers 
who work there and do that very good 
job for our wonderful veterans. So we 
need to continue to provide that type 
of care as well. 
Also, I joined with Senator SINEMA 
and Senator SULLIVAN in introducing 
the Reduce Unemployment for Vet-
erans of All Ages Act, which enables 
veterans, 
regardless 
of 
when 
they 
served, to access VA’s vocational reha-
bilitation and employment benefits. 
That just makes sense, particularly 
during this pandemic. We are seeing 
the challenges with unemployment for 
everybody, and making sure that our 
great veterans have access to work and 
employment when they come back or 
leave the service is always a priority. 
It is obviously very much a priority as 
we work our way through this pan-
demic. 
So passing this legislation would help 
provide veterans with greater self-suf-
ficiency, better financial security, and, 
of course, a higher quality of life. 
Also, as chairman of the Senate Com-
mittee on Indian Affairs, I have worked 
with our committee to ensure that our

Nation fulfills its promise to our Na-
tive American veterans. Native Ameri-
cans serve in our military in a higher 
percentage 
than 
any 
other 
ethnic 
group, which is truly remarkable and a 
tremendous thing. 
So, as I say, for all of our veterans, 
we have to be there, but we certainly 
have to make sure, then, that we are 
providing help and support for our Na-
tive 
American 
veterans 
who 
have 
served as well. 
Clearly, Native American veterans 
face some unique challenges related to 
homelessness and housing, and that is 
a function of being on the reservation. 
They have some unique challenges, and 
we have to work to address those chal-
lenges. 
So I have worked with Senator 
UDALL, the vice chairman of the Indian 
Affairs Committee, along with Senator 
TESTER, whom I think is ranking mem-
ber on the Veterans’ Affairs Com-
mittee, and we introduced the Tribal 
HUD-VASH Act, which would provide 
rental housing assistance as well as 
housing for eligible Native American 
veterans who are homeless or at risk of 
homelessness. 
Our legislation has passed the Sen-
ate, and we are certainly hoping that it 
receives action in the House very soon. 
As we continue to support our serv-
icemembers, I also am a member of the 
Senate Defense Appropriations Com-
mittee, and we need to continue to 
work to invest in our military and en-
sure that our servicemembers have the 
tools they need to complete their mis-
sions. 
In North Dakota we have many Ac-
tive-Duty servicemembers at our Air 
Force bases, as well as others in the 
State. They perform incredibly impor-
tant missions, and we need to make 
sure that we are supporting them and 
our servicemembers across the country 
and deployed around the globe and that 
they have what they need to do their 
missions. 
That applies equally for our members 
of the National Guard and the reserves. 
As a former Governor—and I know the 
Presiding Officer was a former Gov-
ernor himself—the amount that we 
rely on the National Guard is unbeliev-
able. Their level of service is unbeliev-
able. Whether it is fire or flood or hur-
ricane or tornadoes or any kind of nat-
ural disaster here at home or whether 
it is deploying to the global war on ter-
ror in Afghanistan, Iraq, or anywhere 
else around the world, our National 
Guard is there. They do an incredible, 
incredible job, so we need to make sure 
we are supporting our Guard and re-
serves just as we support our Active- 
Duty forces. As a matter of fact, one of 
our Guard units is actually deployed 
for a 9-month assignment defending the 
Nation’s Capital. They are here defend-
ing Washington, DC. 
Again, talk to anybody who is a Gov-
ernor or a former Governor, and they 
will tell you just how incredible the 
National Guard is. And those deploy-
ments are not easy. Whether they are 
deployed overseas, whether they are 
deployed somewhere in the United 
States, whether down on the border or 
wherever it may be, they serve. And we 
can’t forget that their families serve 
too. When they are gone, the families 
have to pick up the slack at home, and 
they do. 
That is one reason that each year 
since coming to the Senate, I have in-
troduced in the past the Senate resolu-
tion proclaiming a national Day of the 
Deployed to recognize and thank our 
deployed servicemembers and their 
family members: Active Duty, Guard, 
and Reserves. 
With Thanksgiving approaching, we 
are reminded of the many freedoms and 
blessings that we enjoy as a nation, all 
of which have been secured by the men 
and the women who have served and do 
serve in our Armed Forces. 
Today and every day—not just on 
Veterans Day but today and every 
day—we say thank you and God bless 
you. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. ROM-
NEY). The Senator from Nebraska. 
THANKSGIVING 
Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, next 
Thursday is Thanksgiving, and we are 
here today because, even during a 
tough year like this one, we have so 
many things to be thankful for. 
In that spirit, I would like to tell a 
short story about a Nebraskan whose 
contribution to the history of our 
country is pretty extraordinary. 
In 1886, Andrew Jackson Higgins was 
born in the small town of Columbus, 
NE. He spent most of his childhood in 
Omaha, and he served in the Nebraska 
Army National Guard after the turn of 
the 20th century before moving to Ala-
bama at the age of 20 to work in the 
lumber industry. 
He worked a wide variety of jobs, 
hoping to learn enough to eventually 
start his own business. He succeeded in 
his dream in 1922 when he founded Hig-
gins Lumber and Export Company, 
which quickly grew to become one of 
the largest lumber companies in North 
America. 
Four years later, his company de-
signed the Eureka boat, a 36-foot-long 
boat that was able to sail in just a few 
feet of water. At the time, lumber 
could only be loaded onto ships at port, 
but a craft that could operate in such 
shallow water could run on and off of 
riverbanks, enabling Higgins Lumber 
and Export Company to load and un-
load its lumber just about anywhere. 
In short, Andrew Higgins built the 
Eureka boat simply to make his em-
ployees’ lives easier, and that was an 
honorable goal. But throughout the 
next decade, as it became clear that 
Hitler decided to plunge the world back 
into war, the U.S. military began to 
search for a way to land soldiers di-
rectly onto beaches. They turned to 
the Eureka boat, which beat the Navy’s 
design in a head-to-head test in 1939. 
There was just one problem: The only 
way to get on or off the boat was by 
jumping over the sides, and this would 
leave soldiers exposed to enemy fire in 
combat. To get around this, the Navy 
asked Higgins to add a ramp door to 
the boat’s bow. He returned with the 
final design just a month later, and the 
Higgins boat was born. 
Andrew Higgins’ company went on to 
produce over 23,000 of these boats, and 
his design worked so well that the Al-
lies trusted them to carry our soldiers 
across the English Channel on D-Day. 
Without the Higgins boat, we may not 
have turned the tide of World War II at 
Normandy. We may never have liber-
ated Europe from Hitler’s grasp. 
In fact, President Dwight Eisen-
hower, who was the Supreme Allied 
Commander in Europe on D-Day, went 
as far as to say that Andrew Higgins 
was ‘‘the man who won the war for us.’’ 
It was an honor to attend the 75th 
anniversary of D-Day last year at 
Omaha Beach, to see firsthand the 
beach where the ‘‘greatest generation’’ 
jumped out of those boats that Andrew 
Higgins built to save the world from 
Naziism. 
I am thankful for them, and I am 
thankful for the sacrifices that all of 
our veterans and Active-Duty service-
members make each and every day. 
We all know that Thanksgiving is 
going to be a little different this year. 
As important as it is to spend time 
with our extended family, many of 
whom we only see once a year, it is 
just as important to do what we can to 
protect those we love from this virus. 
I won’t pretend that it is easy to 
spend Thanksgiving apart from these 
large gatherings of loved ones, but I 
hope the far greater sacrifices our sol-
diers and veterans have made will help 
us to keep this hardship in perspective. 
This Thanksgiving, let’s give thanks 
for our military; let’s give thanks for 
Andrew Higgins and the Higgins boat, 
which saved the lives of so many of our 
soldiers on D-Day; and let’s give 
thanks for our veterans and those cur-
rently serving this country in the 
Armed Forces. Without the sacrifices 
that they have made and continue to 
make every day, our country wouldn’t 
be as great as it is today. Their service 
makes Thanksgiving possible, this year 
and every year. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The

The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I am 
rising today, along with others, giving 
thanks to our military and service-
members and our veterans. In our fam-
ily, this comes naturally. I am the son 
of Wes Roberts, a World War II Marine 
veteran who fought at Okinawa and 
Iwo Jima, and as a Marine veteran my-
self, I say with certainty and pride that 
there is no greater duty than to stand

with those who have put country be-
fore self. 
I might add that my dad was age 41; 
he lied about his age and said he was 
39. There was a niche in the Marine 
Corps at that time to be an air ground 
officer. That quickly turned into a 
combat situation, both in Okinawa and 
Iwo Jima. I am very thankful that he 
was spared. I would also like to add 
that I thank former President Truman 
for making a decision that allowed him 
and 800,000 other Americans to come 
home. 
It is of the utmost importance, espe-
cially today, to pause and to recognize 
and thank veterans everywhere for 
their service in defending our Nation 
from threats, both overseas and here at 
home. 
Another point of privilege I would 
like to point out is that before the pan-
demic, we were set to dedicate the 
Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial on 
May 8. That was the 75th anniversary 
of Victory in Europe Day—an anniver-
sary with worldwide significance. 
Due to the ongoing pandemic, we 
dedicated the memorial in September, 
and now, after decades of work, the me-
morial dedicated to our President and 
the Supreme Allied Commander and 
Kansas’s favorite son, Dwight D. Eisen-
hower, is attracting generations of 
visitors to the National Mall. I drive by 
it on Independence Avenue when I am 
going home. I am always amazed that 
there are 25 or 30 people taking pic-
tures of Ike, both as President and also 
the Supreme Allied Commander. 
I am delighted that we are relearning 
the contributions of this great Presi-
dent and a man who basically saved 
Western democracy and gave us 8 years 
of peace and prosperity as President. 
The memorial encourages all visitors 
to learn more about the critical role 
Ike played in not only shaping our Na-
tion and defining the United States of 
America on the world stage but leading 
our country through 8 years of peace 
and 
prosperity. 
He 
recognized 
the 
promise of America and the reciprocal 
responsibility of his people to serve the 
Nation that serves them. As he said in 
his first inaugural address, ‘‘It is the 
firm duty of each of our free citizens 
. . . to place the cause of this country 
before the comfort, the convenience of 
himself.’’ It was Eisenhower’s decision 
to launch the D-day invasion that 
helped turn the tide of war in Europe 
and save Western democracy. 
While the memorial pays tribute to 
his valiant leadership, it also pays trib-
ute to the ‘‘greatest generation.’’ With-
out their bravery and sacrifice during 
World War II, the world, no doubt, 
would be a very different place. 
Now, we have another favorite son in 
Kansas. My dear friend and mentor, 
Senator Bob Dole, is another one of 
these heroes of the ‘‘greatest genera-
tion,’’ and he made a tremendous effort 
in making the World War II Memorial 
a reality. In talking with Bob about his 
effort and then his key role in making 
the Eisenhower Memorial an actuality 
and being successful, now anybody who 
is a World War II veteran—and those 
numbers are decreasing dramatically 
every year—however, they can get 
some transportation up here on Inde-
pendence Avenue and pay homage to 
their Commander in Chief and salute 
him as they would have liked to have 
done years back. 
I would point out that through my 40 
years of service in both the House and 
Senate, I have said many times that 
the No. 1 priority of our Federal Gov-
ernment is to provide for the safety 
and security of our great Nation and to 
encourage those who protect us and to 
give them due. It has also been an 
honor to serve as a marine and to serve 
the great State of Kansas in Wash-
ington. 
Our Nation is forever indebted to the 
acts of bravery and sacrifice of the 
service men and women who repeatedly 
answer the call of duty and step for-
ward to defend the freedoms we all hold 
dear. Each and every one of us—more 
especially 
in 
this 
body—give 
the 
thanks of a grateful Nation to our Na-
tion’s veterans. 
I would be remiss if I did not close by 
stating ‘‘Semper Fi.’’ 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the con-
firmation vote on the Vaden nomina-
tion occur at 2:15 p.m. today. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I am 
joined on the floor by the Senator from 
North Carolina, and I think a few addi-
tional Members will be coming to talk 
about Thanksgiving Day and about one 
of the things that we are most thank-
ful for in this Nation, which is the 
service of our veterans who have 
stepped forward in uniform to give us 
the free country that we enjoy today 
and the freedoms that we enjoy today— 
veterans like my 96-year-old father, 
who was in World War II, who was rec-
ognized at the Ole Miss-South Carolina 
game just Saturday night as one of the 
surviving World War II veterans. 
So I want to take a personal moment 
to recognize my dad and people like 
him who served so many, many decades 
ago. They kept us safe and defended 
our most important freedoms, includ-
ing the freedom that Americans exer-
cised just this month—the freedom to 
cast a ballot. 
I am a veteran myself, and I am a 
proud veteran. Of course, my accom-
plishments do not compare with those 
of my World War II veteran dad’s. I am 
also the proud father of an Air Force 
major today, Maj. McDaniel Wicker. So 
being a veteran is a proud tradition in 
our family. Also, it is a proud recogni-
tion that we make as Members of Con-
gress and to take care that the prom-
ises we have made are kept to the 
armed services members who have 
stepped forward and donned a uniform. 
That means making sure, during this 
COVID–19 pandemic, that federally run 
retirement homes, like the Armed 
Services Retirement Home in Gulfport, 
MS, have the resources they need. It 
means acting boldly to reform the VA, 
which we have done, actually, on a bi-
partisan basis, in recent years, with 
legislation like the VA MISSION Act 
and the VA Accountability and Whis-
tleblower Protection Act. These laws 
have reduced wait times, expanded ac-
cess to telemedicine and private care, 
and allowed the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs to fire employees who 
have engaged in poor performance. As I 
say that, I might add, when I talk to 
veterans who have used the services of 
the VA, so many times, they are com-
plimentary and profusely generous in 
their praise of the employees of the De-
partment of Veterans Affairs. For 
those who don’t get the job done and 
perform poorly, we now have the abil-
ity, under this important legislation, 
to get rid of them and replace them 
with those who will join the majority 
of the VA employees in getting the job 
done. 
I have also introduced legislation 
with Senator KAINE to designate Sep-
tember 30 as National Veterans Suicide 
Prevention Day. It is something on 
which, again, we have worked in a bi-
partisan manner down through the 
Congresses. 
This month is not only Thanksgiving 
month and election month, but it is 
Military Family Appreciation Month. 
Showing our thankfulness to veterans 
also includes showing our thankfulness 
to the families of our military mem-
bers. So I am pleased to join my col-
leagues and yield the floor, in just a 
few moments, to my colleague from 
North Carolina. 
Just today, Members of the House 
and Senate are working on the final 
paragraphs and the final provisions 
that remain undecided within the Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act. This 
year, it will be named after a retiring 
colleague of ours, Representative MAC 
THORNBERRY, of Texas, who did not 
seek reelection this year. I can tell you 
that Members of the Senate and Mem-
bers of this Republican conference are 
working hard today to make our Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act a re-
ality again for the 60th straight year 
and to serve those veterans and future 
veterans who have done so much to 
make our country free. 
At this point, I yield the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from North Carolina. 
Mr. TILLIS. Madam President, before 
the senior Senator from Mississippi 
leaves, I would like to thank him for

his comments and for his service to the 
Nation. He actually spent some quality 
time in my great State of North Caro-
lina when he was in the Air Force. 
Senator WICKER, thank you for your 
service and for your father’s as well. 
I rise for the same purpose—to thank 
our men and women in uniform, our 
veterans, and those actively serving. 
In North Carolina, we have a proud 
tradition of military service. We have 
one of the fastest growing populations 
of veterans in the Nation. We will have 
surpassed a million over the next cou-
ple of years. We also have over 100,000 
Active-Duty servicemembers who serve 
bravely 
from 
Fort 
Bragg, 
Camp 
Lejeune, Cherry Point, New River, and 
Seymour Johnson, which is where my 
colleague from Mississippi served. We 
also have a fantastic, well-decorated 
National Guard and the largest air sta-
tion for the Coast Guard right up in the 
northeast part of our State. We have a 
proud tradition of military service, and 
I am proud to serve them as their U.S. 
Senator. 
I also have the privilege of serving as 
the chairman of the Personnel Sub-
committee on the Senate Armed Serv-
ices Committee and on the Committee 
on Veterans’ Affairs, where we work 
every day to try to make life better for 
our men and women who serve today 
and for our veterans who have served 
in the past. 
I have to say, with regard to the 
Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, it is 
one of my favorite committees be-
cause—and the American people need 
to recognize this—we almost always 
come together, Republicans and Demo-
crats, to continue to make install-
ments on a debt we can never fully 
repay. Senator WICKER talked about 
some of the progress we have made 
with the VA MISSION Act, which 
makes sure that we provide to the vet-
erans who need care the best possible 
care they can get. 
I also thank for his leadership the 
Secretary of the VA, Robert Wilkie, 
who is also a native North Carolinian. 
Out of 17 Federal agencies, he has 
taken the Department of Veterans Af-
fairs organization, which was ranked 
17th as the preferred place to work, to 
the top 5, and its satisfaction rating 
among veterans today is over 90 per-
cent. I would put what they are doing 
up against any of the best healthcare 
systems in the private sector. 
We have a lot of work to do, and I 
want all of the veterans to know that 
we are going to honor their service by 
doing our work here in the Senate of 
continuing to do better by them. 
I also want to talk about the fact 
that it is Military Family Appreciation 
Month. I think the real silent heroes 
out there are the spouses and the fam-
ily members who are left behind when 
you are deployed or are in training. We 
have to continue to make progress for 
military families. Many people may 
not appreciate what it is like if you are 
in a career as a spouse and are being 
moved from station to station every 
couple of years or how difficult it is to 
get a job. For many certified positions, 
it can take a year or more for you to 
get a job in another State, and by that 
time, you are already planning for an-
other deployment. We have made a lot 
of progress in this area, but we have 
much more to do. 
On a special note, I want to talk to 
the military families who are in mili-
tary 
housing 
on 
our 
installations 
across the world, particularly to the 
folks down at Fort Bragg and Camp 
Lejeune. 
We are not done with making sure 
that you have the best, safest, cleanest 
housing that you can possibly have. We 
have made a lot of progress in this Con-
gress, but we have a lot of work to do. 
So I make a commitment to every 
servicemember and every veteran: As 
long as I am in the U.S. Senate, we are 
going to work to continue to repay 
that debt. We are looking for your feed-
back, and we are looking for your input 
so that we can do right by you. 
To all of the veterans and all of the 
military families, I thank you from the 
bottom of my heart for all that you 
have done and for all that you continue 
to do. 
On a final note, to those of the vet-
erans service organizations, with whom 
I work closely on the Committee on 
Veterans’ Affairs, thank you for your 
continued service. You have served our 
Nation in the armed services, and you 
continue to serve by helping veterans 
and helping to be a voice up here in 
Congress. 
To the veterans and military fami-
lies, God bless you, and thank you for 
your service. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
HYDE-SMITH). The Senator from Iowa. 
Ms. ERNST. Madam President, I 
thank my colleague from North Caro-
lina for joining us to talk about our 
veterans and about how important 
they are. 
North Carolina, of course, is home to 
many of our Active-Duty installations, 
which house many of our brave, young 
men and women from across the United 
States. Many Iowans will travel to the 
great Fort Bragg or other installations 
and call North Carolina home at least 
for a short while. So thanks to my col-
league for joining us today. 
Thanksgiving dinner has become the 
single most celebrated meal of the 
year, with tens of millions of Ameri-
cans gathering with family and friends 
to give thanks for their blessings and, 
of course, for one another. And, folks, I 
know that this year, it is a lot dif-
ferent. 
While we still have so much to be 
thankful for, the COVID–19 pandemic 
means folks will be traveling less and 
might not be celebrating in larger 
groups. As a result, many will be sepa-
rated from their loved ones on this 
very special day. 
But, folks, this is a very familiar 
feeling for anyone who has ever served 
in our Nation’s Armed Forces. There is 
no vacation from protecting our Na-
tion. At any given moment, thousands 
of men and women, moms and dads, 
brothers and sisters, are stationed 
around the world, standing vigilant in 
the defense of freedom. 
Those wearing the uniform aren’t the 
only ones making a sacrifice, either. 
Back home, there is an empty seat at 
the family table. There are kids miss-
ing their mom or dad, as my daughter 
missed me while I was deployed. Par-
ents are missing a child, and husbands 
and wives are missing a spouse. 
Due to COVID, many who are sta-
tioned in the United States can’t even 
travel home to be with their families. 
My own daughter will not be able to 
travel over Thanksgiving. Restrictions 
have been put in place prohibiting non-
essential travel to or from many mili-
tary 
installations, 
including 
Camp 
Dodge in my home State of Iowa. But 
every day, not just Thanksgiving, can 
be a sacrifice when serving in the 
Armed Forces. Those who enlist are 
well aware of this. Yet it is no deter-
rent. 
As a combat veteran with over 23 
years of service between the Army Re-
serves and the Iowa Army National 
Guard, I understand what many fami-
lies are going through, and I have a 
deep sense of gratitude for the sacrifice 
our men and women in uniform make 
for the good of their neighbors. 
Just last year, I visited our Iowa 
troops for Thanksgiving in Afghani-
stan. It was good to see them, and I 
know how much they were missing 
their families. They also want to make 
sure that the people back home remem-
ber them—remember that they are far 
from home, remember that they are 
working hard to protect our freedoms. 
Our 
courageous 
servicemembers 
know the real cost of freedom. They 
have seen and felt it firsthand. Many of 
them live with that price the rest of 
their lives. Far too many who survive 
combat continue fighting an internal 
battle when they return home. 
That is why I have made it a top pri-
ority to work across the aisle to com-
bat suicide and mental health struggles 
among our veterans. My most recent 
effort would designate a Buddy Check 
Week to educate veterans on how to 
conduct peer wellness checks. It is a 
really simple measure that could go a 
long way to support the health and 
safety of those who have bravely served 
our Nation. 
During this Thanksgiving season, we 
also must continue to show our grati-
tude for those who are putting their 
own health and lives at risk by serving 
on the frontlines in our fight against 
COVID–19. 
Throughout 
this 
pandemic, 
there 
have been over 850 Iowa National 
Guardsmen working to deliver personal 
protective equipment, food, and med-
ical supplies all across the State of 
Iowa. Having served in the Iowa Army 
National Guard for many, many years, 
I could not be more proud of their tire-
less and selfless efforts. That is why I

have introduced legislation to provide 
tax-free hazardous duty pay for our Na-
tional Guard men and women to recog-
nize the work they are doing during 
this pandemic and provide them the 
pay they deserve. 
I know I speak on behalf of all 
Iowans when I say I am truly thankful 
for all of those who have ever served 
our Nation in uniform, and also to 
their families. This month we honor 
and appreciate all the sacrifices our 
military families make to support 
loved ones who are serving our Nation 
in uniform. 
While this Thanksgiving might look 
a little different, let’s not forget to be 
grateful for the freedoms and the bless-
ings we have in this truly great coun-
try. 
May God bless all Iowans, including 
those serving overseas and those caring 
for strangers during this pandemic. I 
am thankful for the opportunity to 
serve you. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri. 
Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, first, 
let me thank Senator ERNST for orga-
nizing this opportunity to talk about 
our veterans, to talk about those who 
serve and the obligations we have to 
them, to talk about their challenges. 
Last week, certainly Veterans Day was 
very much on our minds, but also we 
ought to be sure that our veterans are 
on our minds all the time. 
We have appropriations bills we need 
to pass that will make a big difference 
in how veterans’ issues are dealt with. 
Obviously we need to pass the appro-
priations bill for the Department of 
Veterans Affairs, and every veteran 
would want us to pass the appropria-
tions bill for the Department of De-
fense. But there are also provisions in 
other bills that help veterans get back 
into society more effectively when 
they leave the military. 
The Labor, Health and Human Serv-
ices, and Education bill that I talked 
about on the floor last week increases 
assistance for veterans’ employment 
programs and veterans’ training pro-
grams. It supports veterans when they 
move from the military workforce to 
the civilian workforce. It works to give 
homeless veterans a chance to have a 
home, have a job, have an oppor-
tunity—break through whatever bar-
rier is a barrier for them. Opioid de-
pendence—we all know those numbers 
are back up. Those opioid death num-
bers are back up. Veteran suicide—not 
one is acceptable. Funding the veterans 
hotline, funding behavioral health pro-
grams, being sure that telehealth can 
be available to veterans who may not 
be able to drive all the way to a pro-
vider but would be able to quickly con-
tact the person who helps them. 
We need to understand the challenges 
for homeless veterans particularly and 
post-traumatic stress in other veterans 
who sometimes don’t develop post- 
traumatic stress until decades after 
they serve. Often our veterans, not just 
in leaving the military but in retire-
ment from whatever they did next, 
don’t realize until that moment how 
much their service has impacted the 
way they see things and do things and 
think about things and are concerned 
about things. 
We need to be sure that veterans who 
have experiences and skills that they 
take out of the military are able to 
quickly connect with employers as 
they transition to civilian life. 
Every employer—in fact, at least I 
have never talked to an employer who 
doesn’t say: We really hire vets. It is a 
priority where we are to hire vets. 
But we passed some legislation a few 
years ago, the HIRE Vets Act, which 
gave the Department of Labor the au-
thority to recognize employers that ac-
tually do that—that hire vets, that 
promote vets, that retain vets. Sec-
retary Alex Acosta was Secretary of 
Labor at the time, and they took a pro-
gram that—everybody who advised him 
on this said it would take about 3 years 
to set this up. They set it up in about 
6 months, and we began to recognize 
employers around the country who 
truly do meet the standard that all em-
ployers say they meet, and some do. 
Everybody wants to, but it is easier to 
say you do it than it is to do it. 
Seven Missouri businesses just re-
ceived earlier this month the 2020 HIRE 
Vets Medallion Program Award. They 
are C2C in Chesterfield; Connectria in 
St. Louis; Arnold Defense & Elec-
tronics in Arnold, MO; AME Construc-
tion in Cottleville; Veterans of Foreign 
Wars in Kansas City, an employer that 
at one time was the World War I Me-
morial—the only memorial; On Target 
Solutions in Belton; and Pod-Grown in 
Wentzville. They all received the rec-
ognition that they really do hire vets 
and they really do promote vets and 
they really do meet extraordinary 
standards that are part of that pro-
gram. The program aims to highlight 
companies that do just that. 
Third, we have worked to make it 
easier for military spouses to transfer 
their licenses and skills from one State 
to another. We included that in the De-
fense Authorization Act passed in July. 
That Defense Authorization Act hasn’t 
passed the Congress yet. It has passed 
the Senate; it hasn’t passed the House 
yet. I know we have every intention of 
getting that done this year. But when 
we do, we put provisions in there that 
really do allow much easier transfer 
from one State to another, whether 
you are a teacher or a nurse or a beau-
tician or a barber or an engineer, archi-
tect—whatever you might be transfer-
ring and want to transfer as your 
spouse moves from one assignment to 
another, it shouldn’t take most of the 
time you are there to finally get quali-
fied to do what you were qualified to do 
before you got there. 
Lowering these license barriers for 
spouses—I think we ought to also do 
all we can to lower those barriers for 
veterans themselves. If you have been a 
medical technician in the Air Force, it 
shouldn’t be very hard to become a 
medical technician wherever you de-
cide to move to after the military. If 
you have been a truckdriver in the 
Army, it shouldn’t be very hard to get 
a truckdriver’s license pretty quickly 
once you decide this is where you want 
to go. If you have been an electrician 
in the Navy, you ought to be able to 
get your license to be an electrician 
pretty quickly when you go to where 
you go after you leave the military. 
So these are the kinds of things we 
can do. Certainly, our deep apprecia-
tion for veterans, our deep appreciation 
for their families, our honoring the flag 
that they have done so much for—all of 
that is important. It is an integral part 
of what we are as a country. But there 
are things we also do that show vet-
erans that what they did, what they 
learned counts, it matters, and we are 
going to recognize that as employers, 
as coworkers, as Members of Congress. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Indiana. 
Mr. YOUNG. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent to complete my re-
marks before the vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. YOUNG. Madam President, in 
the Marine Corps, we have a motto: 
Semper Fidelis. It means ‘‘always 
faithful’’—always faithful to our Na-
tion and to the brave patriots who have 
honorably served it. 
Just last week, we recognized a day 
that is very special to me and I think 
to all Americans—Veterans Day. On 
this important occasion, we say thank 
you to our veterans, to those who have 
worn the uniform for their courage and 
for their commitment to protecting 
our freedoms and preserving our very 
way of life. 
Their service, of course, should be an 
example to all of us. I try to instill this 
in my children. It is something I dis-
cuss at school groups oftentimes, en-
couraging people to think about maybe 
spending some time in military service 
or finding other ways to serve their fel-
low Americans. 
Our veterans help keep us safe during 
times 
of 
great 
uncertainty 
and 
unease—something all of us, I think, 
appreciate a little bit more during this 
trying year. 
The month of November also marks 
Military Family Appreciation Month. 
Our military families don’t always get 
the credit they deserve, but they bear a 
very special and unique burden on be-
half of our country that, frankly, most 
of us cannot fully understand. They 
sacrifice their peace of mind and their 
well-being on behalf of their neighbors, 
their communities, and their fellow 
Americans, people they have never 
met—What could be more beautiful 
than that?—because they believe in 
this Nation and they believe in this 
country and the values that undergird 
it. 
Even though we can’t begin to repay 
the sacrifices they make on our behalf,

we can honor them, and we can express 
our gratitude. So this Thanksgiving 
season, this time for counting our 
blessings and celebrating how many of 
them we enjoy even amidst this global 
pandemic, may we remember all that 
we are thankful for—every bit of it— 
and who we are thankful for, as well— 
yes, our family members, our neigh-
bors, and our close friends, but I per-
sonally am thankful for our Active- 
Duty servicemembers. I am thankful 
for Indiana’s more than 400,000 vet-
erans. I am thankful for their selfless 
families. 
I hope all Americans will join me 
today, this month, this Thanksgiving, 
and every day thereafter and reflect on 
these men and women, the fellow 
Americans who sacrifice so much on 
behalf of all of us. Our country simply 
would not be the same without them; it 
arguably wouldn’t exist without the 
families who are prepared to sacrifice 
so much. 
So God bless our Active-Duty serv-
icemembers, God bless our veterans, 
and God bless our military families, 
and may God continue to bless this 
great country, the United States of 
America.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7060 
November 18, 2020 
FAREWELL TO THE SENATE 
Ms. MCSALLY. Mr. President, I rise 
to give my final speech on the Senate 
floor, with a heart of gratitude. Serv-
ing and fighting for Arizona as a U.S. 
Senator has been the opportunity of a 
lifetime. 
Many times in the last 2 years, I had 
to pinch myself that this middle-class 
veteran became one of only 1,984 Amer-
icans to serve in the U.S. Senate and 
only 677 to serve in both Chambers of 
Congress since our Nation was formed. 
Like most Americans, on my life’s 
journey, I have overcome adversity 
which could have crushed me but, by 
the grace of God, gave me a purpose to 
fight for others. When I was just 12 
years old, my dad died unexpectedly of 
a heart attack. I learned at that early 
age to treat each day of this life as a 
gift. I was reminded of that lesson 
again this year when my 58-year-old 
brother Martin passed away. Though it 
wasn’t from COVID, this type of deep 
grief—unexpectedly losing a family 
member—is one too many of us have 
faced in 2020. We have been reminded 
once again that every moment, every 
day, every chapter of our lives is truly 
a gift. 
As it has been for most chapters of 
my life, I didn’t come here in a tradi-
tional or easy way. 
I want to first thank Governor Doug 
Ducey for the blessing to serve the 
great State of Arizona, especially dur-
ing these times of unprecedented chal-
lenges. 
Accepting the Governor’s appoint-
ment to be a Member of the world’s 
most prestigious and powerful gov-
erning body was, like most missions in 
my life, a high-risk, high-purpose en-
deavor. Becoming a U.S. Senator was 
the ultimate expression of one of my 
life’s principles: Do things afraid. I 
took on the mission with my eyes wide 
open. I gave it my all, and I left it all 
on the field in my fight for the Grand 
Canyon State. 
When I gave my maiden speech on 
this floor, I shared my approach to 
service, which was forged through 26 
years in uniform: Honor your oath. 
Live up to your calling. Don’t walk by 
a problem. To paraphrase renowned 
fighter pilot John Boyd, choose to ‘‘do 
something’’ instead of trying to ‘‘be 
somebody.’’ 
As I make the trip back home from 
DC to Arizona for the last time and 
close out this 9-year chapter of my life, 
I do so with gratitude, with joy, with 
no regrets, and with the pride of having 
represented the most optimistic, resil-
ient, and gritty people on the face of 
the Earth. 
While my name is on the door of our 
office here, this has always been a 
team effort. None of what we have 
achieved would have been possible 
without an exceptionally talented, self-
less, and committed staff, many of 
whom are here today. I am so thankful 
for my team of professionals in DC and 
Arizona, who truly embody our core 
values of integrity, service, excellence, 
teamwork, and a ‘‘make it happen’’ 
mindset. 
I especially want to thank those who 
have been with me for all 6 years of my 
time in the House and Senate: my chief 
of staff, Justin Roth, whom I trust 
completely as my closest wingman to 
lead our amazing team through thick 
and thin; my legislative director, Pace 
McMullan, who drives our legislative 
success and embodies the young, bril-
liant talent making a difference on the 
Hill; my deputy State director, C.J. 
Karamargin, who took a risk to join 
our team first in the House and built 
strong relationships across southern 
Arizona; and Rosa Ruiz, who has been a 
tireless case worker to help so many 
Arizonans left behind by Federal agen-
cies. They welcomed our larger team in 
the Senate to serve the whole State. 
Of that incredible group, I want to 
recognize my deputy chief of staff and 
State director, Tanya Wheeless, who 
brought a wealth of experience, matu-
rity, and relationships to lead and 
mentor our Arizona team, and Alana 
Wilson, my director of scheduling— 
really, my director of everything—who 
has extraordinary capacity and matu-
rity beyond her years, and I absolutely 
could not function without her on so 
many levels. 
This institution could not operate 
and the people of all 50 States would 
not be served without the intelligent, 
hard-charging, often young men and 
women who choose to work on the Hill 
in staff positions. They don’t do it for 
the pay, and they could make much 
more and work fewer hours in other 
fields, but they choose these behind- 
the-scenes, unglamorous jobs to be a 
part of keeping our constitutional Re-
public strong. I am so proud and thank-
ful for Team McSally and the profound 
and lasting impact they have made for 
others. 
Together as a team, we intervened on 
behalf of over 7,800 Arizonans who were 
getting the runaround from Federal bu-
reaucracies in the last 2 years alone. 
We secured nearly $7 million of bene-
fits they deserved. 
To my fellow Arizonans, it was an 
honor to be your voice and fighter on 
your behalf. 
We crafted a legislative agenda that 
fought for freedom, opportunity, and 
security for Americans and Arizo-
nans—the very principles for which I 
and my fellow veterans put our lives on 
the line. We played a key role in cre-
ating a strong economy so everyone 
has the opportunity to realize the 
American dream; rebuilding our mili-
tary; standing up to China; securing 
our border; and transforming the judi-
ciary back to its constitutional role for 
generations to come. This includes the 
historic opportunity to confirm a pio-
neering Justice, Amy Coney Barrett, to 
the Supreme Court. 
We worked together in this Chamber 
to quickly deliver relief during this 
first-in-a-century 
pandemic, 
saving 
lives, jobs, and small businesses. My 
thanks to President Trump, Vice Presi-
dent PENCE, Majority Leader MITCH 
MCCONNELL, and all of my colleagues 
who demonstrated leadership and com-
mitment to these important missions. 
We saved the mighty A–10 Warthog 
from being mothballed—again. I stood 
in the gap to ensure due process for a 
brilliant senior military leader to con-
tinue to serve our Nation, and I told 
the whole world in a Senate Armed 
Services Committee hearing that, as a 
fighter pilot, retired colonel, and U.S. 
Senator, I, too, am a survivor of sexual 
assault. My path of healing, of finding 
my voice and strength to not be held 
down or held back, was not easy, but I 
can truly say, like Joseph in the Old 
Testament: What others intended for 
evil, God used for good. I am grateful 
to God for giving me the courage to 
tell my story, and I am blessed to be a 
Senator, not only to lead on reforms 
that were signed into law but also to 
use my platform to be an example of 
hope and healing for others. 
During my time serving in the Air 
Force, I developed a commonsense ap-
proach to solving problems that I took 
with me when I deployed here to DC. 
This approach, despite the division, ob-
struction, and dysfunction here in Con-
gress, drove me to tirelessly seek com-
mon ground, to find pragmatic solu-
tions that have made a real, tangible 
difference in people’s lives. We know 
where we disagree—the lines are very 
bright—but I am proud to say my team 
always looked for where the Venn dia-
gram overlapped to solve problems and 
get something accomplished, and it 
worked. We tied for the most bills 
signed into law in my first year in the 
Senate, and I am proud to say I will 
leave this body ranked as the sixth 
most bipartisan Senator—because I 
joined with many in this Chamber, on 
both sides of the aisle, to find common 
ground for the common good. 
As one of the few combat veterans in 
the Senate, I was uniquely honored to 
fight for our military heroes, their 
families, and veterans. Too often, our 
men and women in uniform come home 
with the invisible wounds of war. The 
legislation that my team and I crafted 
and successfully got across the finish 
line gives them the lifesaving treat-
ment they earned and deserve, allowing 
them to heal and reach their full, God- 
given potential. Those who sacrifice 
life and limb for this country—who 
bear the scars of battle, both seen and 
unseen, who ran toward the sound of 
the guns in godforsaken lands—are the 
heroes we can never forget and to 
whom we owe a profound debt. My 
deepest hope is that the work we did to 
fight for our veterans is a cornerstone 
of the legacy we leave here in the Sen-
ate. 
Over these last few years, I have met 
so many inspiring Arizonans as I have 
traveled through all 15 counties and en-
gaged with people from myriad back-
grounds and experiences. It was an 
honor of a lifetime to meet four Navajo 
Code Talkers when attending National 
Navajo Code Talkers Day on the Nav-
ajo Nation; to visit with World War II

vets like George Cross while partici-
pating in the 75th anniversary of D- 
Day in Normandy; to connect with and 
encourage Arizona sailors patrolling 
the Straits of Hormuz during height-
ened tensions with Iran; to secure, then 
pin an overdue Purple Heart on Iraq 
war veteran Michael Letcher; and to 
tour the border with the Ladd family 
and other ranchers—hard-working, pa-
triotic people whom I never would have 
met had I not served in Congress. 
Over the last several, challenging 
months, I have been so inspired and 
proud to witness Arizonans stepping up 
to help each other get through this 
pandemic. Our small business owners 
and universities found innovative ways 
to 
make 
PPE 
for 
our 
frontline 
healthcare heroes. We delivered meals 
to doctors and nurses with church con-
gregations and packed up food boxes 
with the National Guard at local food 
banks. 
Even in the midst of such unprece-
dented challenges, I, like many other 
Arizonans, took in the beauty of our 
great landscapes by hiking sections of 
the Arizona trail. On a day-long trek to 
the bottom of the Grand Canyon and 
back with a dear friend, we were joined 
for part of the hike by the park’s new 
superintendent. We saw firsthand the 
benefits the Great American Outdoors 
Act would bring to this national treas-
ure and crowning jewel of our State— 
legislation we championed in this very 
room. 
I also went on ride-alongs with Bor-
der Patrol and local law enforcement 
to experience the challenges they face 
in keeping our communities safe and 
learn how to best support these heroes. 
I will miss these life-changing oppor-
tunities, but I will always carry with 
me the time I had and lessons I learned 
from Arizona’s amazing unsung heroes. 
As we approach the end of a year that 
has tested our country, I look forward 
to spending time, as I do every year, in 
prayer, thought, and writing for the 
year ahead. Sometimes I feel the Lord 
presses a few words on my heart— 
words that are important to keep 
strong and guide my spirit for the next 
year. At the end of last year, three 
words stuck out during my time of re-
flection for 2020. I put these words on 
sticky notes on my bathroom mirror to 
serve as daily reminders: peace, joy, 
and gratitude. 
In the most difficult year in modern 
history, I have known a peace that sur-
passes all understanding, a joy that 
can only come from a loving Creator, 
and a gratitude that even on the most 
difficult days, an almighty God put me 
on this Earth and in this Chamber to 
stand in the breach during this mo-
ment in our Nation’s history. 
Standing up for what is right during 
challenging times is the founding ethos 
of our great country. 
Early in my time in the military, a 
mentor pointed me to the Book of Es-
ther for guidance as I navigated wheth-
er to risk my career to stand up for 
what was right. I have carried the les-
son of Esther 4:14 as my life’s scripture 
ever since: Can it be that you were put 
in this position for such a time as this? 
I was honored to serve with each of 
you in this Chamber for such a time as 
this. We experience this gift of life in 
seasons, and while this season is one 
filled with tumult and challenges, I 
know we will get through it as Ameri-
cans always do—together. 
When I was appointed to the Senate, 
I thought of this season in my life and 
decided, if this is the last 2 years of my 
life, I want to make it count for others. 
Today represents a change in seasons 
for me. I don’t yet have clarity on what 
my next mission will be, but I do know 
who is the author and finisher of my 
faith and that He created each of us 
with a purpose. We live up to that pur-
pose when we live, as John McCain ex-
horted to us, for causes greater than 
oneself. 
This mentality was encapsulated by 
Teddy Roosevelt in a famous speech 
more than 100 years ago, one I trust we 
all know well. I came across his ‘‘man 
in the arena’’ passage when I was just 
a teenage cadet in the Air Force Acad-
emy, and it spoke to my purpose-driven 
spirit, so I cut it out and put it on my 
bulletin board. The same yellowed, 
torn paper is on my refrigerator today, 
more than 30 years later. 
We can truly say in this short season 
that we were daring in all we did to ad-
vance worthy causes, and our place 
shall never be with those timid souls 
who knew neither victory nor defeat. 
It has been a true honor, Arizona. We 
are an extraordinary State with ex-
traordinary people. I know our future 
is blessed and bright just like our State 
motto: ‘‘God enriches.’’ I have been en-
riched by the privilege to fight for you 
and serve you these past 6 years—2 
here in the Senate. 
I wish my successor, Mark Kelly, all 
the best as he represents our incredible 
State in this hallowed Chamber. 
Let me close with the words of Apos-
tle Paul, which I hope and pray will be 
said about my life in my final days 
whenever they come. He wrote: ‘‘I have 
fought the good fight. I have finished 
the race. I have kept the faith.’’ 
May God continue to bless America 
and Arizona. May we all finish the race 
and keep the faith. 
I yield the floor for the final time. 
(Applause, Senators rising.) 
ORDER OF PROCEDURE 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
BLACKBURN). The majority leader. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the clo-
ture motion with respect to the McNeel 
nomination ripen at 5:30 p.m. Monday, 
November 30. I further ask that at 4:30 
p.m. today the postcloture time with 
respect to the Mizelle nomination ex-
pire and the Senate vote on confirma-
tion of the nomination. Finally, if con-
firmed, the motion to reconsider be 
made and laid upon the table and the 
President be immediately notified of 
the Senate’s action. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The Senator from New Hampshire. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I 
come to the floor today to raise the 
concern about the need to pass another 
package of assistance to address the 
coronavirus. 
I had a chance over the weeks that 
we were in our home States in October 
and after the election to travel around 
New Hampshire and to talk with a 
number of our small businesses, rep-
resentatives from nursing homes, from 
our hospitals, from so many of the peo-
ple who are affected by what is hap-
pening with COVID–19. 
And what I heard was that too many 
people are struggling; too many people 
are hurting, and they need help. 
New Hampshire has a small business 
economy. It is an economy where over 
50 percent of our workers are employed 
by small businesses, where about 98 
percent of the businesses in New Hamp-
shire are considered to be small busi-
nesses. 
And I was very proud of being able to 
work with Senators CARDIN and RUBIO 
and COLLINS to design the Paycheck 
Protection Program as part of the 
CARES Act that has helped over 24,000 
small businesses during the time after 
it was passed—small businesses and 
nonprofits. 
That also was instrumental in bring-
ing $2.5 billion into New Hampshire and 
keeping 200,000 people employed. 
Many of those small businesses have 
bounced back to where they were be-
fore COVID–19, but too many of them 
still need help, and they are worried 
about whether they are going to be 
able to get through the winter. 
Of special concern are businesses in 
the hospitality industry—our hotels 
and restaurants. Tourism is our second 
largest industry in New Hampshire. 
Recently, I had a conference call 
with a number of folks from the Hotel 
and Lodging Association. One of the 
things that they told me is that they 
are not sure how they are going to get 
through the winter. 
For many of our restaurants, about a 
third of their business has come over 
the summer from outdoor eating, and 
that, of course, is ending in New Hamp-
shire as the weather gets cold. How 
they are going to make that up is a 
real question. 
Restaurants were the first businesses 
to be shut down in New Hampshire; 
they were the last businesses to open 
up; and now we have a huge industry 
that is not sure how it is going to get 
through the year. 
The second highest number of work-
ers in this country are in the res-
taurant industry. We have got to pro-
vide some help for them, and it needs 
to be significant. We also have to look 
at the hotels. Again, a big piece of 
what we have got to address. 
There was a recent report from the 
American Hotel and Lodging Associa-
tion that showed that business travel 
over the holidays is going to be down 
significantly. That is a big source of

revenue for many of those businesses, 
and we have got to provide some help 
and some additional help for those 
businesses as we look at trying to get 
a package of assistance. 
Another round of the PPP program is 
probably important. We know we had 
about $125 billion left in that program, 
but we need to think about how we can 
target it best to those industries that 
are most affected, also to minority 
businesses that may not have a rela-
tionship with a financial institution. 
So as we think about what we have 
got to do, that is one of the big pieces. 
I had a chance to visit a restaurant 
over in the western part of our State. 
It was a business that I visited 6 years 
ago, right after it had opened—a res-
taurant and pub. 
When I went there, they had five em-
ployees. It is a young man and his 
mother who run the business. I asked 
him if he was able to get a PPP loan. 
He said, yes, but he said: My mother 
and I haven’t taken a salary since 
March because it didn’t seem right to 
lay off one of my five employees who 
have families just so that I could take 
a salary. He said: So we are doing ev-
erything we can to get by. We hope we 
will be able to make it, but it is not at 
all clear that we will be able to do 
that. 
I looked around the restaurant, and 
in the middle of the restaurant was a 
big barrel, and it was filled with 
canned goods and dried goods—food. On 
it was a sign that said, ‘‘Take what you 
need,’’ because we have so many people 
who are desperate—desperate for food, 
desperate for housing. 
As I talked to the mayors in New 
Hampshire, particularly in our two 
largest cities, Manchester and Nashua, 
housing and homelessness is a huge 
issue. Homelessness has increased ex-
ponentially. In Manchester, our biggest 
city, we have 35 encampments of the 
homeless. The biggest one is on the 
grounds of the State superior court. 
What does it say when, in the richest 
country in the world, we have so many 
people who are homeless? And the 
problem is getting worse. I talked to 
the community action agencies in New 
Hampshire, which are providing help 
for people with housing. They told me 
they are seeing people they have never 
seen before—people who need help be-
cause of COVID. 
Then there are the childcare centers 
and camps. In New Hampshire, our 
camps have been a special part of our 
summer experience. We have people 
from all over the country who come to 
camps in New Hampshire. Only six of 
our overnight camps were able to oper-
ate through the summer, and they op-
erate on a margin that says if they 
don’t make it in the summer, they are 
not going to get any revenue for an-
other year until next summer. They 
are worried about whether they are 
going to go under between now and 
next summer. 
Our childcare centers—I heard from 
Jackie Cowell, who runs an organiza-
tion called Early Learning New Hamp-
shire, which is an umbrella organiza-
tion for childcare in New Hampshire. 
What she told me is that if they get no 
help, by next year 50 percent of the 
childcare centers in New Hampshire 
will be out of business. 
As I talked to employers at some of 
those small businesses, they tell me 
one of the challenges they have is 
being able to bring workers back when 
they are able to operate because they 
don’t have any childcare for their kids. 
And, of course, with schools going so 
remote, there is a real concern about 
parents and how they are dealing with 
their kids. Most parents and most 
schools want to bring the kids back, 
but in order to do that, they have to 
make sure that it is safe, and they need 
help in order to make sure it is safe. 
They need help with HVAC systems 
and with the cleaning supplies and the 
PPE that are necessary in order to 
make sure the schools are safe for the 
students. We have to provide help for 
those schools. We have to provide help 
for the childcare centers and help for 
our small businesses. 
Then, of course, I met with nursing 
homes in New Hampshire. Long-term 
care facilities have had about 40 per-
cent of the deaths as a result of 
COVID–19 in this country, and yet they 
have only gotten about 4 percent of the 
funding. In New Hampshire, where we 
have the highest percentage of deaths 
in our long-term care facilities of any 
State in the country, 82 percent of our 
deaths have been in nursing homes. 
Right now they have a workforce 
shortage that averages about 25 per-
cent. It is so bad that our Governor 
this week reinstituted a stipend for 
long-term care workers. It is some-
thing that he started back in April. It 
ran through July. As things got better, 
they needed less help. But now they are 
back in a situation where they can’t 
get the help they need. 
I visited a nursing home in the north-
ern part of New Hampshire, Coos Coun-
ty, our northern most county that bor-
ders the Canadian border. What they 
told me is that while they have some 
personal protective equipment, they 
don’t have enough to guarantee what 
they need long term. So here we are, 9 
months into this pandemic, and we 
still have nursing homes that can’t get 
the help they need, can’t get the per-
sonal protective equipment that they 
need. They are struggling to get by, 
struggling to get the workers they 
need. 
Then there are the hospitals. In New 
Hampshire we have a lot of rural hos-
pitals. One of them has gone bankrupt 
in the last couple of weeks because of 
COVID. The hospitals in our two big-
gest cities have had the majority of the 
hospitalizations that we have seen in 
New Hampshire. We have four hos-
pitals, two in Manchester and two in 
New Hampshire, that have dealt with 
the most COVID patients in the State. 
Just when they were beginning to see 
their patients come back in September 
and early October, we are now seeing 
the cases rise again, and hospitaliza-
tions are up. So they are looking at fi-
nancial shortfalls at the end of this 
year. If we can’t provide help for those 
hospitals, if we can’t provide help for 
some of our rural hospitals, we are 
going to see more bankruptcies. That 
means not just an impact on the 
healthcare that they provide, but for 
many of those institutions, they are 
the biggest employer in their commu-
nity, so more people are going to be 
out of work. 
So we are looking at this downward 
spiral that is going to get ever worse if 
we do nothing to address the needs of 
our businesses, of the people who are 
unemployed, of hospitals, childcare 
centers, and our schools. It is critical 
that we come to some agreement. We 
ought to be able to reach a bipartisan 
agreement. It is one of the things I 
heard as I was campaigning around 
New Hampshire. People need help. 
They need help now. Why can’t we 
work together to get that done? 
I think we need to all double down 
and try to come to some sort of com-
promise that allows us to provide help 
to people who need it immediately be-
cause if we don’t, it is only going to get 
worse. The number of coronavirus 
cases are only going to continue to in-
crease, and we need to work to address 
that. 
We need to have a transition that al-
lows the next administration to work 
with the current administration to 
make sure that the efforts to get this 
new vaccine out—the two vaccines that 
look like they are promising—are 
going to be effective and we are actu-
ally going to be able to get people im-
munized and have the funding to do 
that. In order for that to happen, we 
have to see a change in the transition, 
and we have to work together to make 
that happen to provide the help that 
the States need. 
So I am going to be continuing to do 
everything I can here in this body to 
see if we can’t come to some agreement 
around a package that would provide 
help to those who need it, and I hope 
that all of my colleagues will do the 
same, that we will all double down on 
the efforts. I am not saying we should 
help people who don’t need it. That is 
obvious. But we should help the people 
who need help because they are strug-
gling, and it is not going to get any 
better unless we provide some assist-
ance. 
I hope we are going to see some ac-
tion in the next couple of weeks be-
tween now and the end of the year. 
I yield the floor.

ator from Arkansas.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7063 
November 18, 2020 
400 years ago this Saturday, a battered 
old ship called the Mayflower arrived 
in the waters off Cape Cod. The pas-
sengers aboard the Mayflower are, in 
many ways, our first founders. Daniel 
Webster called them ‘‘Our Pilgrim Fa-
thers’’ on the 200th anniversary of this 
occasion. 
Regrettably, 
we 
haven’t 
heard much about this anniversary of 
the Mayflower. I suppose the Pilgrims 
have fallen out of favor in fashionable 
circles these days. I therefore would 
like to take a few minutes to reflect on 
the Pilgrim story and its living legacy 
for our Nation. 
By 1620, the Pilgrims were already 
practiced at living in a strange land. 
They had fled England for Holland 12 
years earlier, seeking freedom to prac-
tice their faith. But life was hard in 
Holland, and the Stuart monarchy, in-
tolerant of dissent from the Church of 
England, gradually extended its oppres-
sive reach across the Channel. So the 
Pilgrims fled the Old World for the 
New. 
In seeking safe harbor for their reli-
gion, the Pilgrims differed from those 
settlers who preceded them in the pre-
vious century, up to and including the 
Jamestown settlement just 13 years 
earlier. As John Quincy Adams put it 
in a speech celebrating the Pilgrims’ 
anniversary, 
those 
earlier 
settlers 
‘‘were all instigated by personal inter-
ests’’ motivated by ‘‘avarice and ambi-
tion’’ and ‘‘selfish passions.’’ The Pil-
grims, by contrast, braved the seas 
‘‘under the single inspiration of con-
science’’ and out of a ‘‘sense of reli-
gious obligation.’’ 
Not to say all aboard the Mayflower 
felt the same. About half of the 102 pas-
sengers were known as ‘‘Strangers’’ to 
the 
Pilgrims. 
The 
Strangers 
were 
craftsmen, traders, indentured serv-
ants, and others added to the manifest 
by the ship’s financial backers for busi-
ness reasons. The Strangers did not 
share the Pilgrims’ faith, suffice it to 
say. Winston Churchill, in his ‘‘History 
of 
the 
English-Speaking 
Peoples,’’ 
wryly observed that the Strangers were 
‘‘no picked band of saints.’’ 
So these were the settlers who 
boarded the Mayflower, which Dwight 
Eisenhower once characterized as ‘‘a 
ship that today no one in his senses 
would think of attempting to use.’’ One 
can only imagine the hardships, the 
dangers, the doubts that they faced 
while crossing the north Atlantic. The 
ship leaked chronically. A main beam 
bowed and cracked. The passage took 
longer than expected—more than 2 
months. Food and water—or beer, often 
the 
beverage 
of 
choice—ran 
dan-
gerously low. 
But somehow, through the grace of 
God and the skill of the crew, the 
Mayflower finally sighted land. Yet the 
dangers only multiplied. William Brad-
ford, a Pilgrim leader whose ‘‘Of Plym-
outh Plantation’’ is our chief source 
for the Pilgrim story, recorded those 
dangers: 
They had now no friends to welcome them, 
nor inns to entertain or refresh their weath-
erbeaten bodies; no houses or much less town 
to repair to, to seek for succor. . . . And for 
the season it was winter, and they that know 
the winters of that country know them to be 
sharp and violent, and subject to cruel and 
fierce storms, dangerous to travel to known 
places, much more to search an unknown 
coast. Besides, what could they see but a hid-
eous and desolate wilderness. 
And to those physical dangers, you 
can add legal and political danger. 
While the Mayflower had found land, it 
was the wrong land. For, you see, the 
Pilgrims’ patent extended to Virginia, 
but Cape Cod was hundreds of miles to 
the 
north. 
According 
to 
Bradford, 
‘‘some of the Strangers,’’ perhaps hop-
ing to strike out on their own in search 
of riches, began to make ‘‘discontented 
and mutinous speeches.’’ These Strang-
ers asserted that ‘‘when they came 
ashore, they would use their own lib-
erty; for none had the power to com-
mand them’’ in New England. 
Maybe they had a point. But Strang-
er and Pilgrim alike also had a prob-
lem: They couldn’t survive the ‘‘deso-
late wilderness’’ alone. Before landfall, 
then, they mutually worked out their 
differences and formed what Bradford 
modestly called ‘‘a combination.’’ 
This ‘‘combination’’ is known to us 
and 
history, 
of 
course, 
as 
the 
Mayflower Compact. But this little 
Compact—fewer than 200 words—was 
no mere ‘‘combination.’’ It was Amer-
ica’s very first constitution; indeed, in 
Calvin Coolidge’s words, ‘‘the first con-
stitution of modern times.’’ 
Likewise, 
Churchill 
called 
the 
Mayflower Compact ‘‘one of the more 
remarkable documents in history, a 
spontaneous covenant for political or-
ganization.’’ High praise coming from 
him, so it is worth reflecting a little 
more on a few points about the Com-
pact. 
First, while the Pilgrims affirmed 
their allegiance to England and the 
monarchy, they left little doubt about 
their priorities. The Compact begins 
with their traditional religious invoca-
tion: ‘‘In the name of God, Amen.’’ 
They expressed as the ends of their ar-
duous voyage, in order, ‘‘the Glory of 
God,’’ the ‘‘advancement of the Chris-
tian faith,’’ and only then the ‘‘honor 
of our King and Country.’’ And much 
like the Founding Fathers’ famous 
pledge to each other before ‘‘divine 
Providence’’ 156 years later, the Pil-
grims covenanted with each other ‘‘sol-
emnly and mutually in the presence of 
God.’’ 
Second, they respected each other as 
free and equal citizens. Whether Pil-
grim 
or 
Stranger, 
the 
signatories 
covenanted together to form a govern-
ment, irrespective of faith or station. 
Third and related, that government 
would be self-government based on the 
consent of the governed. The Pilgrims 
did not appoint a patriarch; they 
formed a ‘‘civil body politic’’ based on 
‘‘just and equal laws, ordinances, acts, 
constitutions, and offices.’’ And imme-
diately after signing the Compact, they 
conducted a democratic election to 
choose their first Governor. 
Fourth, again prefiguring the Dec-
laration, the Pilgrims did not sur-
render all rights to that government. 
They promised ‘‘all due submission and 
obedience’’ to the new government— 
not ‘‘total’’ or ‘‘unquestioning’’ or 
‘‘permanent’’ submission and obedi-
ence. That obedience would presum-
ably be ‘‘due’’ as long as the laws re-
mained ‘‘just and equal,’’ and the offi-
cers appointed performed their duties 
in a ‘‘just and equal’’ manner. 
Finally, even in that moment of 
great privation and peril, the Pilgrims 
turned their eyes upward to the higher, 
nobler ends of political society. They 
listed their ‘‘preservation’’ as an objec-
tive of the new government, but even 
before that came ‘‘our better order-
ing.’’ The Pilgrims understood that lib-
erty, prosperity, faith, and flourishing 
are only possible with order, and that 
while safety may be the first responsi-
bility of government, it is not the high-
est or ultimate purpose of government. 
This new government would do more 
than merely protect the settlers or re-
solve their disputes; it would aim for 
‘‘the general good of the Colony.’’ 
There, aboard that rickety old ship, 
tossed about in the cold New England 
waters, the Pilgrims foreshadowed in 
fewer than 200 words so many cherished 
concepts of our Nation: faith in God 
and his providential protection; the 
natural equality of mankind; from 
many, one; government by consent; the 
rule of law; equality before the law; 
and the impartial administration of 
the law. 
Little wonder, therefore, that Adams 
referred to the Mayflower Compact and 
the Pilgrims’ arrival as the ‘‘birth-day 
of your nation’’ or that Webster, de-
spite all the settlements preceding 
Plymouth, said that ‘‘the first scene of 
our history was laid’’ there. 
But that history was only just begin-
ning. The Pilgrims still had to conquer 
the ‘‘desolate wilderness’’ and establish 
their settlement. Considering the chal-
lenges, it is a wonder that they did. As 
Coolidge observed, though, the Com-
pact ‘‘was not the most wonderful 
thing about the Mayflower. The most 
wonderful of all was that those who 
drew it up had the power, the deter-
mination, and the strength of char-
acter to live up to it from that day.’’ 
They would need all that and more to 
survive what has been called ‘‘the 
starving time.’’ Upon landfall, the Pil-
grims ‘‘fell upon their knees and 
blessed the God of Heaven who had 
brought them over the vast and furious 
ocean.’’ But it would be a ‘‘sad and 
lamentable’’ winter of disease, starva-
tion, and death, as half the settlers 
died and seldom more than half a dozen 
had the strength to care for the ill, 
provide food and shelter, and protect 
the camp. 
As anyone who has endured a New 
England winter knows, at that rate, 
there might not have been any camp 
left to protect by spring. But what can 
only be seen as a providential moment 
came in March, when a lone Indian

walked boldly into their camp and 
greeted them in English. His name was 
Samoset. He had learned some broken 
English by working with English fish-
ermen in the waters off what is now 
Maine. Samoset and the Pilgrims ex-
changed gifts, and he promised to re-
turn with another Indian, Squanto, 
who spoke fluent English. 
Squanto’s Tribe had been wiped out a 
few years earlier by an epidemic 
plague. 
He 
now 
lived 
among 
the 
Wampanoag Tribe in what is today 
Southeastern Massachusetts and Rhode 
Island. The plague had also weakened 
the Wampanoags, though not neigh-
boring rival Tribes. The Wampanoag 
chief, Massasoit, thus had good reason 
to form an alliance with the Pilgrims. 
Squanto introduced him to the settlers 
and facilitated their peace and mutual 
aid treaty, which lasted more than 50 
years. 
Squanto remained with the Pilgrims, 
acting, in Bradford’s words, as ‘‘their 
interpreter’’ and ‘‘a special instrument 
sent of God for their good beyond their 
expectations.’’ He instructed them on 
the cultivation of native crops like 
corn, squash, and beans. He showed 
them where to fish and to hunt. He 
guided them on land and sea to new 
destinations. 
And you probably remember what 
happened next. As the Pilgrims recov-
ered and prospered throughout 1621, 
they received the blessings of a bounti-
ful fall harvest. The Pilgrims enter-
tained Massasoit and the Wampanoags 
and feasted with them to express their 
gratitude to their allies and to give 
thanks to God for His abundant gifts. 
This meal, of course, was the First 
Thanksgiving. 
Now, the Thanksgiving season is 
upon us, and, once again, we have 
much to give thanks for. But this year 
we ought to be especially thankful for 
our ancestors, the Pilgrims, on their 
400th anniversary. Their faith, their 
bravery, their wisdom places them in 
the American pantheon. Alongside the 
Patriots of 1776, the Pilgrims of 1620 de-
serve the honor of American Founders. 
Sadly, however, there appear to be 
few commemorations, parades, or fes-
tivals to celebrate the Pilgrims this 
year, perhaps in part because revi-
sionist charlatans of the radical left 
have lately claimed the previous year 
as America’s true founding. Nothing 
could be further from the truth. The 
Pilgrims and their Compact, like the 
Founders and their Declaration, form 
the true foundation of America. 
So count me in Coolidge’s camp. On 
this anniversary a century ago, he pro-
claimed that ‘‘it is our duty and the 
duty of every true American to reas-
semble in spirit in the cabin of the 
Mayflower, rededicate ourselves to the 
Pilgrims’ great work by re-signing and 
reaffirming the document that has 
made mankind of all the earth more 
glorious.’’ 
Some—too many—may have lost the 
civilizational self-confidence needed to 
celebrate the Pilgrims. Just today, for 
instance, the New York Times called 
this story a ‘‘myth’’ and a ‘‘caricature’’ 
in the food section, no less. Maybe the 
politically correct editors of the de-
bunked 1619 Project are now respon-
sible for pumpkin pie recipes at the 
Times as well. 
But I, for one, still have the pride 
and confidence of our forebears. So 
here, today, I speak in the spirit of 
that cabin, and I reaffirm that old 
Compact. As we head into the week of 
Thanksgiving, I will be giving thanks 
this year in particular to ‘‘our Pilgrim 
Fathers’’ and the timeless lessons they 
bequeathed to our great Nation. For as 
Coolidge observed, ‘‘Plymouth Rock 
does not mark a beginning or an end. It 
marks a revelation of that which is 
without beginning and without end.’’ 
May God continue to bless this land 
and may He bless the memory of the 
Pilgrims of 1620. I extend my best wish-
es to you and to your family for a 
Thanksgiving as happy and peaceful as 
the First Thanksgiving. 
I yield the floor.

MAGNITSKY ACT 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, earlier 
today, Senator WICKER and I partici-
pated in a call with our colleagues 
from Europe in regard to their efforts 
to pass a Global Magnitsky statute. I 
mention that because this month rep-
resents the 11th year anniversary of 
the tragic death of Sergei Magnitsky. 
Sergei Magnitsky was a lawyer in 
Russia, representing a client when he 
discovered the largest tax fraud in 
modern Russian history—$230 million. 
Many of the individuals who were in-
volved in this corruption had ties with 
Russia’s President, Vladimir Putin. 
Mr. Magnitsky did what any lawyer 
is required to do, he reported the fraud 
that he discovered to the local authori-
ties and asked for them to investigate 
the issue. Instead, Sergei Magnitsky 
was arrested. He was imprisoned with-
out parole; he was beaten; he was tor-
tured; and he died in jail without med-
ical help in November of 2009. 
There was no accountability for the 
perpetrators of this atrocity. In fact,

November 18, 2020 
many of the perpetrators actually were 
promoted. We did something about it. 
As members of the U.S. Helsinki Com-
mission, we recognized, in 1975, the 
countries that comprise the Organiza-
tion for Security and Cooperation in 
Europe, including Russia, committed 
to basic human rights for their people, 
that their government would be hon-
est, and that they would protect the 
rights of their citizens. The Helsinki 
Final Act gave every member state the 
right to question what other States 
were doing in compliance with the Hel-
sinki Final Act ideals. 
It is legitimate for us to question 
what Russia is doing in carrying out its 
commitment, so we did something 
about 
it. 
I 
introduced 
legislation 
known as the Magnitsky Act. I want 
you to know this was a bipartisan ef-
fort. My partner in the passage of the 
Magnitsky Act was the late Senator 
John McCain. My partner in passing 
the Global Magnitsky Act and the 
Magnitsky Act is my good friend 
ROGER WICKER, who is the chair of the 
Senate U.S. Helsinki Commission. We 
worked together to make sure that we 
passed these Magnitsky Acts. 
What does it do? What it does is the 
country does not hold accountable 
those who violate basic global human 
rights of its citizens; we impose sanc-
tions. Those sanctions prevent that in-
dividual who perpetrated these acts 
from 
visiting 
the 
United 
States 
through the issuance of a visa or par-
ticipating in our banking system. 
Why do we do this? Today, we heard 
from Mr. Kara-Murza, who is one of the 
activists on human rights in Russia 
who has been poisoned twice by the 
Russian Government. What he said 
about the mantra of the Kremlin is: 
They steal at home and spend abroad. 
They don’t want their money in rubles; 
they want their money in dollars. So if 
we can prevent them from using our 
banking system, we can really make it 
hurt. 
Let me tell you how important this 
is. It is not limited to Russia. We 
passed the Global Magnitsky law so it 
applies to all of the countries where 
they have violations of human rights. 
If you want to know how important 
this statute is, it has been reported 
that when Mr. Putin and Mr. Trump 
met in their first summit, the first 
order of business that Mr. Putin raised 
with President Trump was: Can’t we 
get rid of these Magnitsky sanctions? 
Believe me, they work. They deter bad 
actors around the world. It is a legisla-
tive initiative. 
We talked today about the fact that 
there is one common ingredient in 
every country that has considered the 
Global Magnitsky laws; that is, the ini-
tiative that comes from the legislators. 
There is a natural reluctancy among 
the bureaucrats not to burden them-
selves with additional problems in 
their bilateral relations with other 
countries, but we recognize that it is 
important for America, the leader of 
the democratic world, to speak up for 
democratic principles. We passed the 
legislation. We didn’t have the enthusi-
astic support of the administration, 
but we did it. We did it. And we wanted 
it to be a global standard that was 
clear to human rights violators, but we 
needed other countries to act. 
I am pleased that other countries 
have followed the U.S. leadership. The 
UK, Canada, Estonia, Latvia, and Lith-
uania all have enacted similar Global 
Magnitsky bills. Currently, Japan and 
Australia are considering similar bills 
and legislation. 
Today, we had a very positive con-
versation with the European Union, 
and they are considering the passage of 
a Global Magnitsky bill. This would 
add 27 countries to be covered under 
the Sergei Magnitsky law. 
This is one of the, I think, leading 
moments for the U.S. Senate and Con-
gress, where we showed leadership on 
behalf of speaking out for those other-
wise who would not be heard. As a re-
sult of our action, I am convinced we 
saved many lives, and we made it clear 
that in our foreign policy, we will 
embed that in the principles that have 
made this Nation the great democratic 
Nation it is, the respect for universal 
human rights. 
With that, I suggest the absence of a 
quorum.

OFFICER.

The legislative clerk proceeded to

f 
TRIBUTE TO ASYA BRANCH 
Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, it gives 
me great pleasure to rise this after-
noon, as I do, to commend an out-
standing young American. In this case, 
a young Mississippian; namely, Miss 
Asya Branch, from Booneville, MS, 
who was recently crowned as Miss USA 
2020. 
For those of you from Michigan, take 
some pride. She was born in Michigan 
but moved to Mississippi at an early 
age 
and 
spent 
her 
childhood 
in 
Booneville, as I said. She graduated 
this year from my alma mater, the 
University of Mississippi, having stud-
ied broadcast journalism. 
Miss Asya Branch has experienced 
dizzying success during the past 2 
years. In 2018, Asya Branch won the 
title of Miss Mississippi under the Miss 
America Organization. The following 
year, she became the first African- 
American woman to win the other 
State title, Miss Mississippi USA. She 
is only the seventh person in history to 
hold both State titles: Miss Mississippi 
and Miss Mississippi USA. And now she 
is the first-ever Miss Mississippi USA 
to win the Miss USA crown. 
Asya Branch has been competing in 
pageants since 2016, when she won her 
first preliminary title in the Miss Mis-
sissippi competition. She went on to 
win Ole Miss’s Parade of Beauties com-
petition and numerous local titles. She 
has gained wide recognition because 
she is beautiful, well-spoken, and she is 
a gifted vocalist. But, also, there is a 
serious part of her platform and serious 
personal story of Asya’s in overcoming 
adversity, and I admire that so much 
in Asya Branch. She speaks openly 
about her father’s 10 years in the State 
prison, resulting in his absence for 
much of her upbringing. That difficult 
period shaped who Asya Branch is and 
gave her strength and a unique per-
spective on incarceration. 
During 
the 
Mississippi 
pageant, 
Asya’s platform was empowering chil-
dren of incarcerated parents. Can you 
imagine the courage of a young woman 
taking that on as her platform? It en-
abled her to reach out to other chil-
dren, encourage them that their lives 
do not have to be defined by their cir-
cumstances. 
During her year as Miss Mississippi, 
she was part of a White House round-
table, where she discussed criminal jus-
tice and prison reform, much as we did 
here on the floor of the U.S. Senate. 
And the First Step Act—she discussed 
this act with President Trump and 
Vice President PENCE, Mississippi Gov-
ernor Phil Bryant, and lawmakers, in-
cluding Senator HYDE-SMITH and me. 
She also started the Love Letters 
Program in which she donated sta-
tionery and stamps to inmates, allow-
ing them to write to their loved ones. 
In her new role as Miss USA, she plans 
to expand Love Letters to a national 
level 
and 
continue 
advocating 
for 
criminal justice and prison reform. 
You can see why I am so proud of 
Asya Branch and so impressed with her 
accomplishments. She has the honor of 
holding two State titles and now a na-
tional title. This speaks to her unique 
gifts, accomplishments, courage, and 
passion for bringing about constructive 
change to the world. 
I commend Asya for her example of 
perseverance. She has made Mississippi 
proud, and I think she is going to make 
the United States proud as she moves 
forward next year to the Miss Universe 
pageant, where I am sure she will do 
well. I encourage all Americans to root 
for her next year, as we will certainly 
be doing at my house. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

by, but there is still a lot of work to be 
done here in the 116th Congress. 
I hope that our friends across the 
aisle will reconsider their objections to 
working with us on another COVID–19 
relief bill. I know back home in Texas, 
many small businesses that received 
PPE loans are uncertain, for example, 
what the tax consequences are going to 
be associated with that. Many of them, 
for whom that was a lifeline, are run-
ning out of that lifeline due to the pas-
sage of time. 
We also know we need to pass an ap-
propriations bill before the December 
11 deadline to both avoid a government 
shutdown and give our government 
agencies the ability to plan and oper-
ate with certainty. 
Of 
course, 
perhaps 
most 
signifi-
cantly, we need to pass a final version 
of the National Defense Authorization 
Act. The foremost obligation of the 
Federal Government is the peace and 
security for the American people. We 
do that by passing the defense author-
ization act and funding our military 
each year on an annual basis. This bill 
determines how we maintain our mili-
tary bases, modernize our aircraft, and 
invest in the next generation of air-
craft and weaponry. 
Of course, we know that our adver-
saries—most notably, countries like 
China and Russia—are moving very 
quickly to modernize their military 
and their weaponry in a way that could 
jeopardize the balance or the deter-
rence of our current systems. It is 
very, very important. 
This is also how we supply our serv-
icemembers and their families with the 
money they need to provide for their 
families. It is how we take stock of the 
evolving threat landscape—things like 
hypersonic glide vehicles—and ensure 
our country is taking active steps to 
counter threats on the horizon. 
The most important thing, I think, 
Ronald Reagan taught us or reminded 
us of is ‘‘peace through strength,’’ that 
weakness is actually a provocation to 
the bullies, tyrants, and dictators who 
will take advantage of any oppor-
tunity. It causes instability and per-
haps even miscalculation and people 
taking risks that, ultimately, will lead 
to armed conflict. The best thing we 
can do to maintain the peace is make 
sure the United States of America re-
mains the preeminent military force 
on the planet. 
Of course, it is no secret that, in re-
cent years, China has emerged as one 
of the greatest threats to world order. 
It is increasingly belligerent and well 
resourced 
and 
continues 
to 
dem-
onstrate a lack of respect for basic 
human rights and dignities. 
The challenge of China is they don’t 
play by the rules. I know back when 
China became part of the World Trade 
Organization, there was a hope ex-
pressed that maybe by becoming part 
of the World Trade Organization, they 
could join the other rules-based econo-
mies and countries, but they have not. 
They continue to steal intellectual 
property, and they continue to want to 
dominate the United States, both eco-
nomically and militarily, in the long 
run. 
The Chinese Communist Party has 
made no secret of its desire to flex its 
economic and political power through-
out the world as evidenced by their 
Made in China 2025 Initiative. It seeks 
to advance Chinese dominance in high- 
tech 
manufacturing 
for 
everything 
from electric cars to advanced robotics 
to artificial intelligence to seemingly 
innocuous devices like jetways at air-
ports. 
One major component of this plan is 
semiconductor 
manufacturing, 
and 
China is making serious headway. 
Since 2000, China has gone from manu-
facturing zero chips to 16 percent of the 
global supply, and it plans to invest an-
other $1.4 trillion in the semiconductor 
technology. 
Why is this important? Well, because 
these microcircuits that have gotten 
smaller and smaller and smaller and 
make up the working components in 
everything from iPhones to our weap-
ons systems—these have become harder 
and harder to manufacture. 
In fact, one of the things this COVID 
virus has taught is the vulnerability of 
our supply chains. Right now, one of 
the sole sources of the most sophisti-
cated semiconductor that goes into ev-
erything from our iPhones to our na-
tional defense systems is manufactured 
overseas, primarily in Taiwan. 
While China has upped its production 
of semiconductors dramatically and its 
investment, the U.S. has dropped to 
producing roughly a quarter of the 
world’s semiconductors to only 12 per-
cent. That is a big problem. 
First is the obvious economic impli-
cations. Giving up a significant global 
share of manufacturing means missing 
out on thousands—indeed tens of thou-
sands—of high-paying jobs that could 
be stationed right here at home. 
It also ignores the benefits of a 
strong 
U.S. 
manufacturing 
supply 
chain to support products made by the 
United States and our trading part-
ners. Our growing dependence on oth-
ers, including China, for semiconduc-
tors also poses a serious national secu-
rity risk. 
As I said, these chips are everywhere. 
They are also critical components to 
our infrastructure, things like cell tow-
ers, hospital equipment, missile de-
fense systems. Our most critical tech-
nologies rely on a product we are look-
ing for a country overseas to supply, 
whether it is Taiwan or China or some 
other country. 
Earlier this year, we, of course, expe-
rienced how dangerous that is. It is as 
simple as things like personal protec-
tive equipment. China has long been a 
major supplier of masks, gloves, and 
gowns, and other PPE used by our 
healthcare workers. That didn’t seem 
to be a problem because they could al-
ways make it cheaper, but when the 
virus hit, we found out it was a serious 
problem. 
By the time the virus began spread-
ing to the U.S., China had been bat-
tling it for a number of weeks, maybe 
even months. So when it came time for 
American 
hospitals, 
clinics, 
and 
healthcare providers to beef up their 
supply of personal protective equip-
ment, the supplies were already de-
pleted or we were dependent on China 
to produce them. 
Healthcare workers did what they 
could by reusing masks throughout an 
entire shift in order to conserve sup-
plies. Hospitals were pleading with the 
general public to donate any unused 
personal protective equipment so their 
workforce could remain safe. We didn’t 
reach that point because of lack of 
preparation, but because of our reli-
ance on other countries, namely China, 
to produce that medical gear. 
This has been a wake-up call, I think, 
for me and, I think, certainly many 
others about our supply chain vulnera-
bilities. It is a clear signal that we 
need to take action to secure other 
critical supply chains. 
When it comes to semiconductor 
manufacturing, that is easier said than 
done. Building a new semiconductor 
foundry is a very, very expensive un-
dertaking. It simply will not happen 
without a robust private-public part-
nership. We know our adversaries are 
making a big down payment on their 
own semiconductor manufacturing. 
The Organization for Economic Co- 
operation and Development estimates 
that 21 major semiconductor firms 
across a number of countries received 
more than $50 billion in government 
support between 2014 and 2018. This is 
not exactly a market that is going to 
depend purely on the private sector. It 
is going to require the Federal Govern-
ment to step up if we are going to bring 
that manufacturing onshore and if we 
are going to reduce our vulnerabilities, 
both from an economic and national se-
curity perspective. 
Some of the countries investing, 
though, in manufacturing these tech-
nologies are South Korea, Singapore, 
Taiwan, Ireland, Germany, and—yes, 
you guessed it—China. We have lost 
ground to our global competitors, and 
unless we take action, it is estimated 
that, by 2030, 83 percent of global semi-
conductor manufacturing will be in 
Asia—83 percent. We simply can’t allow 
that to happen. The U.S. needs to make 
a strategic investment in semicon-
ductor manufacturing to regain lost 
ground, and this year’s National De-
fense Authorization Act includes the 
critical first step. 
I introduced a bill, along with our 
colleague, our friend from Virginia, 
Senator WARNER, called the CHIPS for 
America Act, and a version of this bill 
was adopted as an amendment to the 
National Defense Authorization Act. It 
had bipartisan support—a vote of 96 to 
4. It will help restore American leader-
ship in semiconductor manufacturing 
by creating a Federal incentive pro-
gram through the Department of Com-
merce in order to encourage chip man-
ufacturing here in the United States.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7067 
November 18, 2020 
In short, this will help stimulate do-
mestic advanced semiconductor manu-
facturing and boost both our national 
security and global competitiveness. It 
will enable us to bring the manufac-
turing of these critical devices back 
home and strengthen the supply chains 
for our military systems, our critical 
infrastructure, 
telecommunications, 
healthcare, 
agriculture, 
manufac-
turing, and virtually every other indus-
try you could name. 
Senator WARNER and I have worked 
closely with Senator COTTON, of Arkan-
sas, and with Senator SCHUMER, of New 
York, 
in 
drafting 
this 
bipartisan 
amendment. I am glad our colleagues 
in the House have approved a similar 
amendment to their legislation, and I 
am eager to see the final version in the 
conference report. When the NDAA 
makes its way to the President’s desk, 
it will mark the 60th consecutive year 
in which Congress has passed such bi-
partisan legislation to fund, supply, 
and equip our Nation’s military. 
I appreciate the strong bipartisan 
support of Chairman INHOFE, of the 
Committee on Armed Services, and 
Ranking Member REED, and I am eager 
for this legislation to come to the floor 
for a final vote, but the next step is to 
secure funding for the programs to 
incentivize 
domestic 
semiconductor 
manufacturing. We have been working 
with the administration, particularly 
with Secretary Mnuchin, Secretary 
Ross, and Secretary Pompeo, who have 
identified this as a major vulnerability 
and have worked with us to try to close 
that gap. I have enjoyed working with 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle to 
ensure that we provide full funding for 
this legislation, but we are not there 
yet. 
This is the key to our long-term na-
tional security and economic competi-
tiveness, and it is my top priority in 
the coming weeks as the Senate pre-
pares to consider appropriations bills. 
A secure semiconductor supply chain 
will strengthen our national security, 
and our economy will reap countless 
benefits by bringing these manufac-
turing jobs back to the United States. 
As we work to counter increasingly 
sophisticated adversaries around the 
world, passing the National Defense 
Authorization Act and funding these 
new programs could not be more im-
portant.

TRIBUTE TO MIRA BALL 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, for 
six decades, my dear friend Mira Ball 
has been helping Kentucky families re-
alize one of the cornerstones of the 
American dream: owning their own 
home. Earlier this year, Mira was hon-
ored for a lifetime of achievement in 
our Commonwealth with Leadership 
Kentucky’s 
Flame 
of 
Excellence 
Award. Today, I would like to con-
gratulate Mira for this latest recogni-
tion of her contributions to our home 
State. 
With her late husband, Don, Mira 
built Ball Homes into a respected busi-
ness helping improve the lives of Ken-
tuckians for generations. Don led the 
sales, and Mira kept the books. To-
gether, they made a premier team help-
ing make home ownership a reality for 
families across the region. The organi-
zation was made better still as their 
children, Ray, Mike, and Lisa, took 
their own leadership roles. Today, the 
company builds over 1,000 high-quality 
homes each year. 
Mira’s contributions to Kentucky ex-
tend far beyond her entrepreneurial 
achievement. She is a trailblazing lead-
er and philanthropist with special em-
phases on the health and education of 
our next generation. Saying she would 
only get involved in organizations 
where she could really make a dif-
ference, this former schoolteacher has 
helped steer the future of some of Ken-
tucky’s prominent institutions. In fact, 
Mira was the first woman to chair the 
boards of trustees for the University of 
Kentucky, Midway College, and the 
Lexington Chamber of Commerce. 
In 2018, Mira made the single largest 
scholarship gift in UK’s history of $10 
million to help Kentucky students ac-
cess higher education and the oppor-
tunity for a better future. The scholar-
ships focus on students from Nelson 
and Henderson Counties, Mira and 
Don’s native homes, respectively. The 
gift is only one snapshot of years of 
philanthropy that will benefit the 
school and all who rely on it. 
Across our Commonwealth, families 
and communities can see the results of 
Mira’s work. Families living in homes 
built by the Ball have adapted this 
year, turning kitchen tables into of-
fices and classrooms. Students sup-
ported by Mira’s philanthropy were 
given an extra leg up. Anyone who 
turns on Kentucky Educational Tele-
vision, KET, or receives help from the 
United Way has benefited from her vi-
sion and immense generosity. 
So, it is my privilege to join the cho-
rus praising Mira’s leadership in Ken-
tucky. She has not only paved a re-
markable path, but she is also helping 
new leaders find their own. On behalf of 
my Senate colleagues, I would like to 
congratulate Mira Ball for this award 
and wish her years of continued success 
in Kentucky. 
The Kentucky Builders Journal re-
cently published a profile on Mira 
Ball’s career. I ask unanimous consent 
the article be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From the Kentucky Builders Journal, 
Summer 2020] 
MIRA BALL HONORED FOR HER LIFE’S WORK 
Earlier this year, the statewide leadership 
development program Leadership Kentucky 
awarded its annual Flame of Excellence 
Award to Lexington businesswoman Mira 
Ball. The award is given to an outstanding 
Kentuckians who ‘‘bravely goes before and 
lights the way for others.’’ Ball has certainly 
led a life that fits that description. As a 
member of the home building community, 
she is a role model to future generations in 
areas of leadership, business management 
and community involvement and service. 
While the Ball name is well known in the 
Lexington area, Ball and her late husband, 
Don, have both had impact across the state. 
The couple incorporated Ball Homes in 1959 
and immediately focused on the first-time 
home buyer market with their first model 
home in the Cardinal Valley neighborhood 
off Versailles Road. Their goal was to build 
homes in a price range that Lexington city 
police and firefighters could afford. At the 
time, police and firefighters were required to 
live within city limits. 
More than 60 years later, the company re-
mains family owned and still prides itself on 
making home ownership a reality for those 
who never thought it possible. 
‘‘If you’ve got a heart for people, you want 
them to be able to have an affordable home 
that they can live in and enjoy,’’ said Mira 
Ball. ‘‘You see what’s happening with zoning 
and the availability of land, and you get very 
concerned about the fact that the people who 
are the ordinary workers can’t afford to live 
there.’’ 
Ball Homes has built more homes all over 
Lexington as well as in the Louisville and 
Knoxville markets. Don was passionate 
about affordable housing throughout his ca-
reer, and the Balls’ daughter Lisa Ball Sharp 
shares her father’s interest and has served on 
Lexington’s Affordable Housing Task Force. 
Ball is still involved in the business al-
though the Balls’ three children, Ray, Mike 
and Lisa, have been leading the company 
since the 1980s. Ray took over acquisition 
and development, Mike oversees construc-
tion management, and Lisa is in charge of 
property management and sale. Ball said 
that even as her husband let go of the day- 
to-day decision-making long ago, she stayed 
active in the business long after because 
‘‘nobody wanted to do what I did.’’ What Ball 
did was make sure the bottom line always 
added up. 
ACCOUNTING FOR SUCCESS 
Ball first took an interest in accounting 
and business while attending the University 
of Kentucky, where she met her future hus-
band and worked in the Placement Service 
office. Although she graduated with a teach-
ing certificate and taught junior high school 
students for one year, Ball left teaching to 
stay home when her children were born. As 
the family and the building business grew, 
she became the bookkeeper and behind-the- 
scenes partner while her husband became the 
business’s public face. 
‘‘Don was a good salesperson,’’ said Ball. 
‘‘He had the ideas. And I was the one who 
kept things straight.’’ 
She said that while it’s important to be 
ready for new opportunities and challenges, 
good timing had a lot to do with their suc-
cess. Ball Homes has also benefited from new 
ideas as her children began to lead. They ex-
panded into new markets, developed new 
neighborhoods and formed a property man-
agement business within the company. 
‘‘There’s a lot of interaction between Ray, 
Mike and Lisa. But they work well to-
gether,’’ said Ball. ‘‘The building business is 
something that you can be very proud of; 
you’re furnishing homes for people.’’ 
When asked how she had managed to raise 
children who wanted to follow into the fam-
ily business and shared their parents’ com-
mitment to the community, Ball mentioned 
the example set by her and Don’s parents. 
‘‘Our parents were really good examples for 
my children. Hard work was expected and 
something you should enjoy and helping 
other people was important. Some of that 
empathy came naturally to Don,’’ said Ball. 
‘‘I think you have to be sincere and live your 
life like you should and be a good example, 
but I also thank the Lord every day for my 
parents and what they gave me. It wasn’t 
wealth but they had good values and that’s 
what was more important.’’ 
‘‘I’m sure too that having us both work in 
the business and talking about things in 
front of [our children] made them familiar 
with what went on in the building business, 
both the ups and downs. There have been 
times when we thought we’d never sell an-
other house with interest rates at 18% and 
19%. They were aware of that growing up and 
understood it. Don always understood the 
impact of high interest rates on afford-
ability, and Ray really gets that too.’’ 
FOCUSED ON EDUCATION 
Her husband is remembered for his efforts 
to aid the homeless and addicted across the 
state through his roles as state representa-
tive and service on the Kentucky Housing 
Corporation. Ball’s own civic contributions 
have focused on health and education. She 
has served with a wide variety of organiza-
tions including the PTA, the American Can-
cer Society, the United Way, Kentucky Bap-
tist Homes for Children, the St. Joseph Hos-
pital Foundation, the Kentucky Historical 
Society, the Governor’s Mansion Preserva-
tion Foundation, and the Kentucky Horse 
Park. In 1991, she became the first woman to 
serve as chairman of the Lexington Chamber 
of Commerce. She was also the first woman 
elected to the Kentucky Utilities board of di-
rectors, the first woman chairman of the 
Midway College board of trustees, and the 
first woman to serve as chair of the Univer-
sity of Kentucky board of trustees. She was 
appointed to the State Economic Develop-
ment Task Force and the Governor’s Com-
mission on Tax Policy. She continues to 
serve on the Endowment Board of Kentucky 
Educational Television. 
‘‘I think I came along at a time when a lot 
of organizations thought it’s time for a 
woman. I wasn’t going to get involved with 
any organization if I wasn’t going to actu-
ally work on it,’’ said Ball. ‘‘There are so 
many things in this world that you feel like 
you can’t make a difference. But education

is the No. 1 thing that will change Kentuck-
ians for the better. It’s where you can really 
do more to help.’’ 
One of the problems Ball has tried to ad-
dress has been lowering the attrition rate of 
returning students who can’t keep up with 
tuition costs. In 2018, she gave the University 
of Kentucky $10 million to establish a schol-
arship fund that will focus on students from 
Nelson County, where she grew up and Hen-
derson County, where Don was raised. It will 
fund dozens of undergraduate and graduate 
scholarships in the two counties and sur-
rounding areas, focused specifically on ad-
dressing unmet financial need. 
IMPACT ON HBA MEMBERSHIP 
While her efforts have been highly pub-
licized in the world of higher learning, Ball 
recognizes the benefits of work experience 
and involvement in organizations to promote 
lifelong learning. 
‘‘My work experience at UK was as valu-
able as any classroom experiences I had,’’ 
said Ball. ‘‘I think experience is a big educa-
tor, and sometimes you have to make your 
own. I enjoy learning about new things all 
the time. That’s the reason I like KET so 
much.’’ 
The Balls were active members of the 
home builders association and were jointly 
named Builders of the Year by the Lexington 
HBA in 1992. Attending meetings like the 
International Builders Show was a source of 
ongoing learning for her. 
‘‘I used to go to those meetings, and there 
wasn’t a time that I didn’t come back with 
something valuable. I went to all the finan-
cial seminars, and I can still remember some 
of the speakers and what they said,’’ she 
laughed. 
Ball points to her upbringing and her 
Christian faith for prompting her to serve 
her community through the years. She 
talked about a young minister who influ-
enced her to see all people as deserving of 
love and respect. As she describes how she 
felt when she visited the Hope Center and 
other drug and alcohol addiction recovery 
programs. Ball’s compassion for those who 
struggle in her community is evident. 
‘‘You never visit those places without 
thinking how blessed you are,’’ she said. ‘‘If 
you just go in and really talk to people, you 
get the idea that you’ve just got to help.’’

GEORGETOWN LAW’S ‘‘LAWYERS 
AS LEADERS’’ COURSE 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, there is 
no question that 2020 has been a year of 
challenges, difficulty, and concern. It 
is in these more challenging times that 
it is especially important to shine a 
light on those individuals and institu-
tions that are doing good work, work 
that inspires the next generation of 
leaders to think bigger and create a 
brighter future. It is no surprise that 
Georgetown Law, where I earned my 
law degree, is doing precisely that, liv-
ing up to its timeless motto: ‘‘Law is 
but the means, justice is the end.’’ 
This fall, Georgetown Law has of-
fered a unique course entitled ‘‘Law-
yers as Leaders’’ for the first time. Far 
from a staid black letter law class, this 
course is styled as a series of candid, 
introspective 
conversations 
between 
Georgetown Law Dean William M. 
Treanor and faculty members who have 
been prominent leaders in the law and 
public service. These conversations 
seek to confront law students with the 
pressing issues of the day—the COVID– 
19 pandemic, racial injustices, the fra-
gility of our democracy’s norms, to 
name a few—and give them a sense for 
what, as future attorneys, they can do 
to address them. 
In a time of unprecedented uncer-
tainty, the course is a reminder, as one 
enrolled student put it, ‘‘that there is 
hope.’’ Lawyers as Leaders centers stu-
dents in the values that inspired them 
to study the law and reminds them of 
their own agency to make measurable 
change. It is no wonder that over 300 
students have enrolled in this course, 
the largest class enrollment in George-
town Law’s 150-year history. I hope 
this course is offered for many semes-
ters to come. 
I have often highlighted the achieve-
ments of Georgetown Law both on and 
off the Senate floor. The education I 
received there was central to my deci-
sion to dedicate my career to public 
service. It is exactly courses like Law-
yers as Leaders that will help encour-
age this and future classes of George-
town Law students to pursue their pas-
sions as attorneys. Georgetown Law 
should be commended for offering this 
course and reminding students that the 
law 
is 
most 
exciting 
and 
trans-
formative when it is viewed not just as 
a career, but as a calling. 
I ask unanimous consent that an ar-
ticle from the Washington Post, pub-
lished on November 6, 2020, titled 
‘‘Most popular course ever at George-
town Law? How to fight for justice,’’ be 
printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From the Washington Post, Nov. 6, 2020] 
MOST POPULAR COURSE EVER AT GEORGETOWN 
LAW? HOW TO FIGHT FOR JUSTICE 
(By Susan Svrluga) 
In her third year of law school, Maxine 
Walters expected to have everything in 
place: Her job locked in, her career path 
mapped out. 
Then the pandemic hit, and economic un-
certainty, and protests erupted over racial 
justice and tensions flared over the presi-
dential election and transition. Her summer 
job with a firm evaporated, and with it the 
hoped-for offer of a permanent position by 
the time classes resumed for the fall. 
But her school year began with an unusual 
class—one created to mark Georgetown Uni-
versity Law Center’s 150th anniversary and 
shaped by the realities of 2020—that has, for 
many students, upended their ideas about 
rigid timelines for success, their expecta-
tions and even their aspirations. 
Instead of a traditional course focused on 
an area of law such as contracts or torts, the 
school’s leaders crafted a more personal, 
broad-ranging look at leadership. It was a 
recognition that the tumultuous times are 
forcing a reckoning, and leaving many stu-
dents yearning to have an impact. 
Clearly, they touched a nerve: More than 
300 upper-level students signed up for ‘‘Law-
yers as Leaders,’’ the largest enrollment for 
a course in the history of Georgetown Law. 
‘‘This is definitely a time where the ground 
is moving,’’ said Max Lesser, a 28-year-old 
student from New Jersey. ‘‘Everyone realizes 
that the old paradigms of politics and justice 
are kind of breaking. . . . Lawyers have a 
real role to play in what path we take.’’ 
For the online course, students submit 
questions about assigned readings and then 
listen to a conversation between Georgetown 
Law Dean William M. Treanor and a faculty 
member. He asks them to talk about how to 
move forward to confront ‘‘the great issues 
of this terrible time.’’ 
‘‘This is a time when we’re all grappling 
with so many crises’’ and profound chal-
lenges and losses, he said. 
The conversations held each Sunday—now 
available to all on the school’s anniversary 
website—have been topical, even urgent. 
Students have heard from Lawrence Gostin 
about health-care policy during the pan-
demic, such as vaccine distribution and 
whether the government should mandate 
mask-wearing and social distancing. 
Neal Katyal, who has argued more than 40 
cases before the Supreme Court, spoke about 
the contested 2000 election, in which he was 
co-counsel to Democratic candidate Al Gore, 
and about electoral integrity this year. 
Randy Barnett, a libertarian and self-de-
scribed contrarian, talked about the con-
stitutionality of health policy, recent Su-
preme Court nominees and the importance of 
seeking out opposing viewpoints. And Rosa 
Brooks talked about her work examining 
whether norms will hold fast in the after-
math of this contentious election, or wheth-
er the country could face a constitutional 
crisis. 
The conversations have been challenging, 
insightful, sometimes funny and surprisingly 
vulnerable. Gostin spoke of his difficult 
childhood, and how that had helped shape 
the optimistic outlook he’s known for. He 
shared his tips for the best way to make pop-
corn. 
Katyal told students to do something that 
was uncomfortable for them, especially early 
in their careers. He said he had recently 
taken rap improv classes to improve his abil-
ity to think on his feet, and found it terri-
fying. 
Katyal also shared how his father faced 
discrimination and was unfairly fired, but 
had his dignity restored by a civil case, in-
spiring Katyal to go to law school. He told 
how he always asked his children’s advice 
the night before a Supreme Court case, and 
shared some of their tips on how to stay 
calm when facing the justices. (Once: ‘‘Think 
of a cute pig.’’) 
This is a time when shared challenges 
make people more comfortable talking about 
vulnerabilities, Treanor said. ‘‘I don’t think 
we would have these same conversations if 
we had this class two years ago.’’ 
Hillary Sale, an associate dean and pro-
fessor who helped design the class, agreed. 
The stress of the times is making people in-
trospective and reflective, she said, ‘‘in ways 
that are probably really good, and probably 
wouldn’t happen without that outside pres-
sure.’’ 
Paul Butler, a former federal prosecutor, 
challenged students to rethink the justice 
system, which he argues is not weakened by 
a few racist bad-apple police officers, but is 
‘‘broke on purpose’’ and working the way it 
was designed to work. 
Butler told of his searing experience dec-
ades ago when he was arrested while he was 
a prosecutor on a case accusing a U.S. sen-
ator of corruption. As he wrote in his book 
‘‘Let’s Get Free,’’ Butler was charged with 
simple assault after a neighbor falsely ac-
cused him of pushing her after a dispute over 
a parking space. Police officers cursed at 
him. At the courthouse, he was led, hand-
cuffed, through the inmates’ entrance— 
when, as a prosecutor, he normally could 
breeze through the main entrance without 
needing to go through a metal detector. 
At his trial, he said, he listened to a police 
officer lie on the stand. After he was acquit-
ted, he felt the weight of how easily the false

accusation could have destroyed him, if not 
for the skill of his attorney. 
A Yale- and Harvard-educated prosecutor, 
Butler had once felt different from the Black 
men he prosecuted, he told The Washington 
Post. But, he said, ‘‘I certainly wasn’t dif-
ferent in the way police responded to me.’’ 
He wanted students to think about the in-
evitable setbacks and traumatic experiences 
they would face, and how they would con-
front those with integrity. ‘‘The main thing 
I wanted students to think about,’’ Butler 
said, ‘‘is justice.’’ 
For Walters, a 23-year-old Black student 
from Mobile, Ala., the leadership class ini-
tially sounded like a welcome break from 
typical law classes—in which professors grill 
students with tough questions—during a 
busy fall when she is also applying for jobs. 
But Walters, who is president of the George-
town Law Black Law Students Association, 
has been struck by a number of the conversa-
tions, including Butler’s. 
‘‘It has been inspiring to have this class,’’ 
Walters said. 
As faculty reflect in the class on their own 
life choices, the odd zigs and zags of their ca-
reers, the abject failures that turned out to 
be gifts and the pinnacles that unexpectedly 
fell flat, the stories resonated with other 
students confronting their own imminent de-
cisions. 
People are definitely more stressed about 
careers this fall, said Luke Bunting, a stu-
dent from Indiana who has worked for Re-
publican members of Congress and is now in 
his second year at Georgetown Law. He 
hopes to work for a firm and make an im-
pact, and hearing from people with such dif-
ferent backgrounds and approaches made 
him more confident that was possible, he 
said. 
Kristin Ewing, a student from Nebraska by 
way of a musical-theater career in New 
York, gained an interest in health-care pol-
icy when she saw how performers were af-
fected by their lack of insurance. She said it 
was reassuring to hear professors talk about 
career pivots. 
Rujuta Nandgaonkar, also interested in 
health policy—an inclination cemented by 
the pandemic, she said—was struck by 
Barnett’s advice to surround yourself with 
people who disagree with you, and an idea 
several people shared about getting past the 
inevitable bumps in the road. ‘‘Those are im-
portant lessons for these times,’’ she said. 
‘‘This is not the greatest time—but there is 
hope,’’ Nandgaonkar said. ‘‘That’s the string 
that runs through it.’’ 
Lesser, a high school teacher for four years 
before law school, isn’t sure what he wants 
to do after he graduates. But he is consid-
ering options that tie into his interests in 
democracy and criminal justice reform, such 
as working in a prosecutor’s office, judiciary 
committees in Congress or for the military. 
After hearing Brooks talk, Lesser said, 
‘‘her lecture reinforced that having a func-
tional modern democracy is a precious thing, 
and it can get lost easily if people aren’t 
willing to perfect it.’’ 
The class has been grounding, Lesser said. 
‘‘It reminds you of why you’re doing this. 
That’s important, especially when our coun-
try is being tested, our field is being tested. 
You have to reconnect to the values’’ that 
brought people to study the law, he said. 
Walters had gravitated during law school 
to apply to firms because she was worried 
about paying off student loans. But after a 
summer of protests following George Floyd’s 
killing in police custody, she witnessed peo-
ple paint messages about defunding the po-
lice near the White House, and was struck by 
the role public defenders were playing in the 
community. 
The new economic uncertainty and the 
idealism reinforced by the class reaffirmed 
her original commitment to go back to the 
South—where she grew up not seeing Black 
lawyers, she said—and work as a public de-
fender. 
‘‘I’m kind of grateful to be able to do what 
I’m passionate about,’’ Walters said. ‘‘I think 
it would be great to go back there and try to 
make it the best place it could be.’’

ETHIOPIA 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I 
rise today to call upon the administra-
tion to take urgent diplomatic action 
to address the escalating conflict in 
Ethiopia, a country in the midst of 
what many in the international com-
munity, including myself, had hoped 
would be a historic political transition 
to democracy. Instead the country is 
sliding into civil war. Unless the inter-
national community acts quickly to 
forestall further violence, I fear that 
bloody and protracted conflict is un-
avoidable. 
Ethiopians have long aspired to par-
ticipate in a democratic system of gov-
ernment. For years, their leaders let 
them down, but in 2018, things ap-
peared to change when in response to 
peaceful popular protests centered in 
Ethiopia’s Oromo and Amhara regions, 
Ethiopia’s ruling party elevated Abiy 
Ahmed to Prime Minister. Prime Min-
ister Abiy undertook dramatic polit-
ical reform in the first year of his ad-
ministration, releasing thousands of 
political prisoners, inviting exiled op-
position groups back home, and allow-
ing the press to freely operate. Repres-
sive laws like the Charities and Soci-
eties and Anti-Terrorism proclama-
tions, which had long been used to sti-
fle political dissent, were revised and 
replaced. The new government com-
mitted itself to free and fair elections 
and, for the first time in Ethiopia’s his-
tory, 
introduced 
a 
gender-balanced 
Cabinet. Many Ethiopians and much of 
the international community rightly 
celebrated 
these 
achievements 
and 
looked to further democratic progress. 
Abiy himself was awarded the Nobel 
Peace Prize in 2019. 
Yet transitions from autocratic rule 
to democracy are rarely seamless, and 
Ethiopia’s transition is no exception. 
The journey to democracy has been 
beset by the proliferation of ethnically 
motivated violence across the country. 
In 2018, IOM reported that Ethiopia re-
corded the third highest number of new 
ID P’s anywhere in the world, fueled by 
ethnic violence and displacement in 
Gedeo and West Guji zones, and vio-
lence has continued. In June 2019, 
rogue regional security forces assas-
sinated the president of Amhara region 
and the head of the Ethiopian National 
Defense Forces, and in June 2020, the 
murder 
of 
popular 
Oromo 
singer 
Hachalu Hundessa triggered violence 
that killed at least 239 people. Sadly, 
Ethiopians of all ethnic and religious 
backgrounds have been victims of this 
endless cycle of senseless violence. 
To be clear, there are some who have 
taken advantage of new-found freedoms 
to threaten or use violence to achieve 
political ends, engage in hate speech, 
and incite broader conflict. Such be-
havior is inconsistent with democratic 
practice and has further exacerbated 
the country’s ethnic and political divi-
sions in a profoundly damaging way. 
Ethiopian authorities have a responsi-
bility to protect their citizens by hold-
ing the perpetrators and purveyors of 
such actions accountable through a 
transparent, credible legal process. 
Yet the government’s response to 
these challenges has only complicated 
matters. In May 2020, a report from 
Amnesty International chronicled a 
long list of abuses committed by Ethio-
pia’s security forces since the transi-
tion 
began, 
including 
extrajudicial 
killings, torture, and arbitrary arrest. 
The government has engaged in a trou-
bling crackdown on political opposi-
tion, media organizations, and civil so-
ciety, particularly in the wake of 
Hachalu Hundessa’s death. There are 
growing fears that state institutions 
are being leveraged by the ruling party 
to unfairly consolidate the current 
government’s power, including through 
weaponizing law enforcement and the 
judicial process to attack government 
critics. Under these conditions, it is 
unlikely that Ethiopia’s next general 
elections can be anything approaching 
credible, exacerbating an already vola-
tile political situation. 
Against the backdrop of a transition 
in jeopardy, violence between the fed-
eral government and political leaders 
of the Tigray region is escalating. Re-
ports suggest that hundreds have al-
ready died in clashes between govern-
ment and regional forces. I am particu-
larly horrified by evidence of a civilian 
massacre in Mai-Kadra. I condemn this 
act and all attacks on civilians in the 
strongest term, and call for a thorough 
and transparent investigation by a 
credible, neutral, independent body. 
Those who attack civilians must be 
held accountable in accordance with 
the rule of law. I am also concerned by 
reports of civilian deaths as a result of 
federal government airstrikes, mass 
displacement, and discrimination and 
arrests based on ethnic profiling. Au-
thorities in Tigray have confirmed that 
their forces fired rockets into the cap-
ital of a neighboring country, Eritrea.

These rocket attacks constitute a sig-
nificant 
escalation, 
are 
counter-
productive, and should cease. They fur-
ther underscore fears that the conflict 
will expand beyond Ethiopia’s borders. 
If left to continue, the conflict in 
Tigray will not only lead to a cata-
strophic loss of life and worsening hu-
manitarian conditions, but will breed 
further enmity that will derail Ethio-
pia’s democratic progress and desta-
bilize the entire subregion. 
We cannot afford to let that happen. 
Ethiopia is the second most populous 
African country, home to the African 
Union, and one of the world’s top con-
tributors to UN peacekeeping missions 
a tradition that dates back to the Ko-
rean war. It has been a pillar of U.S. 
engagement in the Horn of Africa for 
decades, partnering with the U.S. on 
counterterrorism and with the U.S. and 
international community to stabilize 
protracted conflicts in neighboring So-
malia and South Sudan. 
The Ethiopian people need peace, not 
war; and the world needs a stable, 
democratic and prosperous Ethiopia. 
I urge the federal government and 
the leaders of Tigray region to choose 
the path of peace. While it is tempting 
to assign blame for the outbreak of 
hostilities, our collective focus must be 
on how to restore order. Make no mis-
take, a full accounting must take 
place. Right now, however, both sides 
must agree to an immediate ceasefire 
and begin a sustained dialogue to settle 
political differences. 
I also call on Prime Minister Abiy to 
take a series of actions to facilitate a 
successful democratic transition. First, 
barring immediate and incontrovert-
ible evidence of serious crimes, he 
should release all members of the polit-
ical opposition. Their continued deten-
tion is unacceptable, and I am troubled 
by reports that their judicial pro-
ceedings are being politicized. Second, 
media and digital rights must be re-
spected. Arresting journalists and im-
posing 
internet 
blackouts 
harkens 
back to the dark days of the previous 
regime. Mr. Prime Minister, such prac-
tices must end. You and your col-
leagues have taken bold action to chart 
a new course for the country, and I 
urge you to continue along the difficult 
path of reform. 
Third, the Prime Minister should em-
power an independent and impartial 
body to investigate and ascertain re-
sponsibility for past acts of violence 
beyond those related to current hos-
tilities in Tigray. Finally, I call on the 
Prime Minister to engage in an inclu-
sive dialogue with relevant stake-
holders in advance of elections to en-
sure there is a level playing field and 
buy-in to the electoral process from all 
stakeholders. 
Although resolving the current crisis 
requires Ethiopian commitment and 
action, the United States, along with 
others in the international community, 
have a critical role to play. I therefore 
urge the administration to do the fol-
lowing: 
Lead international diplomatic ef-
forts–the administration must reach 
out to multilateral institutions, allies 
and partners in the region, the Gulf, 
and elsewhere to ensure unity around a 
single message to the federal govern-
ment and officials in Tigray, there is 
no military solution to the conflict be-
tween the federal government and the 
Tigray People’s Liberation Front. Dia-
logue is the only path forward. A joint 
delegation should demarche the Prime 
Minister with this message and reach 
out to leaders in Tigray with the same. 
Increase support for Ethiopia’s demo-
cratic transition—the administration 
should redouble its efforts to support 
the transition by providing the Em-
bassy and USAID mission with more 
staff to provide increased monitoring 
in the areas of democracy and human 
rights and increased technical assist-
ance in the area of election administra-
tion. Funding for grassroots conflict 
mitigation and reconciliation is crit-
ical given ongoing tensions. The United 
States must also engage all Ethiopian 
stakeholders, including traditionally 
marginalized 
populations, 
without 
favor or bias, with the goal of encour-
aging dialogue between the country’s 
rival political forces. Political dis-
agreements must be settled through 
peaceful means. 
Take an informed, organized, and ho-
listic approach. Civil war in Ethiopia 
will destabilize the Horn of Africa and 
has implications for U.S. geostrategic 
interests in the Horn of Africa and Red 
Sea corridor writ large. It is critical 
that the U.S. approach diplomatic en-
gagement in a holistic manner, recog-
nizing the potential ripple effects of 
prolonged conflict. Negotiations be-
tween Ethiopia, Sudan and Egypt rel-
ative to the Grand Ethiopian Renais-
sance Dam—GERD—are only one ex-
ample of how the conflict could impact 
stability in the subregion. Progress on 
the GERD talks is highly unlikely in 
the face of civil war, since Ethiopia is 
likely to remain focused on its domes-
tic problems. 
Unfortunately, the U.S. approach is 
currently fractured. The administra-
tion has engaged in GERD negotiations 
as though they are unfolding in a vacu-
um, divorced from our interests in a 
strong bilateral partnership with Ethi-
opia and absent a broader strategy for 
the Horn of Africa and Red Sea cor-
ridor. Even in the parochial context in 
which we have engaged in GERD nego-
tiations, the administration’s actions 
have, quite frankly, been unhelpful. 
Having Treasury Department lead the 
talks was never wise. Treasury lacks 
the deep regional knowledge and exper-
tise to lead such sensitive negotiations, 
and there is no evidence that its ac-
tions were developed as part of an 
interagency strategy or policy ap-
proach informed by such expertise. It is 
imperative that a sound strategy be de-
veloped and that the State Department 
take the lead on an integrated diplo-
matic approach to both the country 
and the subregion. 
Ethiopia faces historic challenges. 
These challenges can only be met 
through diplomacy, dialogue, and com-
promise. The country has a once in a 
generation opportunity that we must 
not let slip away. I urge the adminis-
tration to act while there is still time.

TRIBUTE TO MAJOR CATHERINE 
‘‘CATIE’’ SHUTTERS SUNDIN 
Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, today, I 
rise to pay tribute to MAJ Catherine 
‘‘Catie’’ Shutters Sundin and her serv-
ice as an officer in the U.S. Army. I am 
especially grateful for her support to 
my office as an Army congressional fel-
low from January to December 2017 
and, later, as the Army congressional 
budget liaison, where she supported my 
responsibilities as the ranking member 
of the Senate Appropriations Sub-
committee on Military Construction 
and Veterans Affairs. Major Shutters 
Sundin will complete her military 
service in November after more than 12 
years of honorable service. 
A native of Muskegon, MI, Major 
Shutters Sundin entered the military 
as a paralegal in the Indiana Army Na-
tional Guard. After completing her ini-
tial military training, she attended 
Wentworth Military Academy and Jun-
ior College in Lexington, MO, where 
she commissioned as a second lieuten-
ant. She completed her undergraduate 
degree in sociology at the University of 
Central Missouri and accessed nto Ac-
tive-Duty status as an aviation officer. 
She attended flight school at Fort 
Rucker, AL, in 2008, graduating as a 
UH–60 Blackhawk pilot. She also has a 
master’s degree in legislative affairs 
from the George Washington Univer-
sity. 
Major Shutters Sundin has served in 
a number of assignments during her 
Army career. Her first assignment as 
an aviation officer was with the 5th 
Battalion, 101st Combat Aviation Bri-
gade, 101st Airborne Division at Fort 
Campbell, KY. As a small unit leader in 
Alpha Company, she deployed her pla-
toon to multiple joint training exer-
cises and ultimately to Khost Province 
in eastern Afghanistan in support of 
Operation Enduring Freedom 12–13. 
While in combat, she served as task 
force intelligence officer, where she 
was charged with leading an intel-
ligence unit that provided threat anal-
ysis, briefings to aircrews and leader-
ship, and assisted military decision 
making. 
Upon redeployment, Major Shutters 
Sundin attended the Maneuver Cap-
tains Career Course at Fort Benning, 
GA, in preparation for her company 
command at Hunter Army Airfield, 
GA. There, she commanded Bravo Com-
pany, 4th Battalion, 3rd Combat Avia-
tion Brigade from January 2014 to Feb-
ruary 2016. Major Shutters Sundin’s 
team of 42 personnel and 10 UH–60M as-
sault helicopters supported a number

persistent presence in Eastern Europe, 
where they flew across the Baltic 
States and Poland to strengthen NATO 
relationships while deterring against 
the threat of Russian aggression. 
In 2017, as an Army congressional fel-
low, I had the privilege of working with 
Major Shutters Sundin in my office for 
a year and during her subsequent as-
signment as the Army congressional 
budget liaison. She worked tirelessly 
with Members of Congress and their 
staff 
to 
accurately 
represent 
the 
Army’s budget positions to the Senate 
and House Appropriations Committees. 
Her 
professionalism, 
diligence, 
and 
commitment to the mission are un-
matched, and her work as a fellow and 
as a liaison well represented the U.S. 
Army and the Department of Defense 
to the U.S. Congress. 
The foundation of Major Shutter 
Sundin’s military success is her family. 
Raised in the Midwest as one of five 
children, her family established par-
ticular values early on: service, sac-
rifice, and compassion. She is a devoted 
wife to her husband Carl, who also 
serves as an officer in the U.S. Army. 
Their commitment to service and care 
for others infuses every organization to 
which they belong. Together, they are 
examples of servant leaders in the U.S. 
Army and to their communities. 
Throughout her career, Major Shut-
ters Sundin has positively impacted 
soldiers, peers, and superiors. Our 
country has benefited tremendously 
from 
her 
extraordinary 
leadership, 
judgment, and passion. I join my col-
leagues today in honoring her dedica-
tion to our Nation and invaluable serv-
ice to the U.S. Congress as an Army 
congressional liaison. 
Mr. President, it has been a pleasure 
to have worked with a talented officer. 
On behalf of a grateful nation, I join 
my colleagues today in recognizing and 
commending MAJ Catherine ‘‘Catie’’ 
Shutters Sundin for her service to our 
country and wish her all the best as she 
explores new ways to continue her 
service.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
RECOGNIZING BOYD INDUSTRIES, 
INC. 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, as chair-
man of the Senate Committee on Small 
Business and Entrepreneurship, each 
week I recognize a small business that 
exemplifies the American entrepre-
neurial spirit at the heart of our coun-
try. It is my privilege to recognize a 
veteran-owned small business known 
for excellence and outstanding crafts-
manship. This week, it is my pleasure 
to recognize Boyd Industries, Inc., of 
Clearwater, FL, as the Senate Small 
Business of the Week. 
In 2012, Adrian LaTrace purchased 
Boyd Industries, a dental and medical 
equipment 
manufacturing 
company 
that was established in 1957 as a cus-
tom residential furniture manufac-
turer. Founder William Boyd pioneered 
the lounge-style dentistry chair, now a 
standard feature in dental offices na-
tionwide. As ‘‘sit-down’’ dentistry be-
came more common, Boyd Industries 
reinvented itself as a cabinet, medical 
chair, and exam equipment manufac-
turer. 
More than 60 years later, owner and 
CEO Adrian LaTrace has continued 
Boyd Industries’ tradition of innova-
tion and growth. A native of the Fort 
Walton 
Beach-Destin 
area, 
Adrian 
graduated from The Citadel before 
serving 8 years in the U.S. Air Force. 
Under his leadership, Boyd has re-
mained committed to its core values of 
integrity, respect, innovation, loyalty, 
and dependability. Veterans are the 
heart of Boyd Industries’ workforce, 
with 
servicemembers 
from 
four 
branches of the military currently rep-
resented at the company. 
Attention to detail and high-quality 
craftsmanship have earned Boyd Indus-
tries a reputation for excellence. They 
are widely regarded as the top oral and 
implant surgery equipment provider in 
the nation. Notably, Boyd Industries 
manufactures the majority of its prod-
uct components at its Clearwater facil-
ity. Additional components are sourced 
from U.S.-based companies, and Boyd 
assembles all products in-house. 
Under Adrian’s leadership, Boyd In-
dustries has earned industry awards 
and invested in its community. High- 
quality products have earned Boyd In-
dustries the Townie Choice Award for 8 
consecutive years. Laird Plastics rec-
ognized Boyd Industries with the Envi-
ronmental Excellence Award from 2015– 
2018, citing its increased recycling and 
sustainability. Collaborating with the 
American Association of Oral and Max-
illofacial Surgeons and the American 
Association of Orthodontists, Boyd In-
dustries has contributed to developing 
orthodontist training and best prac-
tices, and furnished dental residency 
training facilities. Additionally, Boyd 
Industries regularly donates surplus 
cabinetry to Habitat for Humanity and 
has supported the Clearwater Free 
Clinic for decades. 
As an essential business, Boyd Indus-
tries managed to stay open, keep their 
employees safe, and adapt to the chal-
lenges caused by the coronavirus pan-
demic. In April 2020, the SBA launched 
the Paycheck Protection Program, a 
small business relief program I was 
proud to author. The PPP provides for-
givable loans to impacted small busi-
nesses and nonprofits who maintain 
their payroll during the coronavirus 
pandemic. Despite experiencing a drop 
in revenue, a PPP loan enabled Boyd 
Industries to retain 77 jobs. 
Boyd Industries exemplifies the crit-
ical importance of small businesses in 
the medical manufacturing industrial 
base. Their outstanding craftsmanship 
and continual innovation are com-
mendable. Congratulations to Adrian 
and the entire team at Boyd Industries, 
Inc. I look forward to watching your 
continued growth and success.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mr. CARPER (for himself, 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN, Mr. TESTER, 
Mr. HEINRICH, and Ms. WAR-
REN): 
S. 4914. A bill to amend title 23, 
United States Code, to establish a 
grant 
program 
for 
transportation 
projects to improve Tribal health, well- 
being, and youth safety, and for other 
purposes; to the Committee on Indian 
Affairs. 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I today 
I am introducing legislation that aims 
to reduce traffic-related pedestrian fa-
talities in Native American commu-
nities while also improving public 
health and quality of life. 
First, let’s be clear. Everyone in this 
country deserves reliable options to 
travel safely from one place to another. 
Everyone deserves roads that connect 
us to each other and expand our hori-
zons. But the sad truth is that not ev-
eryone in this country has safe, reli-
able roads that foster connections and 
expand horizons. That is especially 
true in Native American communities. 
The adverse statistics surrounding 
the safety and health of Indigenous 
peoples are staggering. Vehicle-related 
unintentional injury is the No. 1 cause 
of death among American Indians and 
Alaska Natives aged 1 through 44. It is 
also the third overall cause of death for 
all American Indians and Alaska Na-
tives, of any age or gender. 
While unsafe roadways put lives at 
risk, inadequate or unreliable transpor-
tation options create obstacles for ev-
eryday life, making it more difficult to 
simply 
access 
healthy 
groceries, 
schools, quality health care, emer-
gency services and economic opportu-
nities. Immobility for individuals with-
in Indian Country reinforces barriers 
to education, quality healthcare, and 
economic opportunity. 
Meanwhile, Native American commu-
nities face disproportionately higher 
prevalence of diabetes and other heart 
disease. In fact, American Indian and 
Alaska Natives are more than twice 
more likely than non-Hispanic White 
Americans to die from diabetes. Car-
diovascular disease is the primary 
cause of mortalities for Native Ameri-
cans under the age of 65. While exercise 
can help to lower the risks associated 
with chronic heart disease, throughout 
Indian Country, there are few safe op-
tions for walking, running and bicy-
cling. 
The sad truth is that decades of Fed-
eral underinvestment in transportation 
infrastructure has contributed to dis-
proportionately higher rates of road 
traffic fatalities and poor public health 
outcomes in Indian Country. Unsafe, 
unreliable and inadequate transpor-
tation infrastructure is exacerbating a 
public safety crisis, worsening public 
health, and degrading quality of life. 
Investments in infrastructure that 
improve safety and expand opportunity 
for nonmotorized forms of transpor-
tation—such as sidewalks, bicycle in-
frastructure, and pedestrian and bicy-
cle signals—can help to prevent more 
road traffic fatalities and also combat 
the prevalence of chronic health dis-
parities that exist throughout Native 
American communities. To that end, 
the Promoting Access to Tribal Health, 
Wellbeing and Youth Safety Act would 
create a new grant program at the U.S. 
Department of Transportation to dedi-
cate new resources for pedestrian-re-
lated infrastructure and improve pedes-
trian infrastructure throughout Indian 
Country. The legislation will also au-
thorize $25 million annually for these 
critical projects. 
By improving pedestrian infrastruc-
ture across Tribal communities, we can 
save lives while improving health out-
comes and quality of life in Tribal 
communities. 
I would like to thank my colleagues, 
Senator FEINSTEIN, Senator TESTER, 
Senator HEINRICH, and Senator WAR-
REN, for joining me to introduce this 
legislation. As we celebrate National 
Native American Heritage Month, I 
look forward to working with my col-
leagues on this issue. Together we can 
improve the safety and health of Indig-
enous peoples across the Nation. 
By Ms. HIRONO: 
S. 4915. A bill to establish the 
Servicemembers and Veterans Initia-
tive within the Civil Rights Division of 
the Department of Justice, and for 
other purposes; to the Committee on 
the Judiciary. 
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I rise 
today to introduce the Servicemembers 
and Veterans Initiative Act. This legis-
lation would formally establish the 
Servicemembers and Veterans Initia-
tive—or SVI—within the Civil Rights 
Division of the Department of Justice, 
DOJ. While the SVI was created in 2015 
as an initiative within the DOJ, this 
legislation is needed to give the initia-
tive authorization to protect the legal 
interests of servicemembers, veterans, 
and their families. I thank Representa-
tive ESCOBAR and Representative TAY-
LOR for introducing this important leg-
islation in the U.S. House of Represent-
atives. 
Our Nation owes a tremendous debt 
to our servicemembers, veterans, and 
military families for the sacrifices 
they make to protect our freedoms. De-
ployment can seriously compromise a 
servicemember’s ability to meet obli-
gations back home and protect their 
legal interests. Servicemembers and

their families have been charged un-
lawful lease termination fees when 
they receive permanent change of sta-
tion or deployment orders. While de-
ployed overseas, some have been denied 
voting rights, while others have had 
their property unlawfully sold. Mem-
bers of the Reserve forces and the Na-
tional Guard have been unjustly dis-
criminated against and denied employ-
ment because of their military service. 
Servicemembers, veterans, and their 
families continue to be targeted by fi-
nancial scams and fraud schemes. They 
deserve better than this, and we must 
ensure that our government protects 
their civil rights during deployment, 
transition back home, and as they set-
tle into their civilian lives. 
The DOJ recognized that, while there 
are laws on the books to protect 
servicemembers, veterans, and their 
families, more is needed to be done by 
the Federal Government to improve 
education about what those laws are 
and what rights they protect and to in-
crease Federal enforcement actions to 
ensure those rights are protected. To 
that end, the DOJ announced the cre-
ation of the SVI to further its efforts 
to enforce statutes that protect the 
civil rights of servicemembers, vet-
erans, and their families. The SVI 
works closely with the Department of 
Defense, Department of Veterans Af-
fairs, and the Judge Advocate General 
offices at military installations to edu-
cate servicemembers, veterans, and 
military families about their rights 
and how to report abuse. It also serves 
as a resource for anyone looking to ob-
tain legal assistance and legal practi-
tioners seeking information. 
Through the work of the SVI, the De-
partment of Justice has brought a 
number of successful claims, including 
one against the city and county of 
Honolulu in February 2018 for illegally 
auctioning 
cars 
belonging 
to 
servicemembers. DOJ launched an in-
vestigation into the city’s actions after 
receiving information from a military 
legal assistance officer and two Navy 
legal assistance attorneys that Hono-
lulu had on at least three occasions 
failed to obtain court orders before 
auctioning 
cars 
belonging 
to 
servicemembers 
while 
those 
servicemembers were deployed aboard 
U.S. Navy ships. The city had violated 
the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, 
SCRA, 
by 
denying 
these 
servicemembers their right to obtain a 
court’s review of whether the auction 
of their vehicles should be delayed or 
adjusted to account for their military 
service. 
The 
settlement 
that 
DOJ 
reached with Honolulu mandated that 
the city ensure servicemembers receive 
notice that their car has been taken 
into custody and that the city obtain a 
court order or SCRA waiver prior to 
auctioning a car owned by an Active 
Duty servicemember. 
The Servicemembers and Veterans 
Initiative Act recognizes the work this 
initiative has carried out on behalf of 
servicemembers, veterans, and mili-
tary families in Hawaii and across the 
Nation by making it permanent within 
the DOJ. This bill also tasks the initia-
tive with serving as legal and policy 
advisor to the Attorney General, and 
liaison between the DOJ and military 
departments. The SVI is further tasked 
with coordinating prosecution of fraud 
that targets servicemembers and their 
families and enforcing Federal laws to 
protect servicemembers and veterans. 
I call on my colleagues in the Senate 
to support the DOJ’s efforts to defend 
the rights of those who protect our 
country 
by 
swiftly 
passing 
the 
Servicemembers and Veterans Initia-
tive Act during the 116th Congress.

SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS 
SENATE 
RESOLUTION 
777—EX-
PRESSING THE SENSE OF THE 
SENATE ON THE NEED FOR COM-
MON SENSE SOLUTIONS TO IM-
PROVE HEALTH CARE DELIVERY 
AND AFFORDABILITY FOR ALL 
PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES 
Mr. PERDUE (for himself and Mrs. 
LOEFFLER) submitted the following res-
olution; which was referred to the 
Committee 
on 
Health, 
Education, 
Labor, and Pensions: 
S. RES. 777 
Whereas the public health emergency that 
the United States is currently facing has 
highlighted the need for common sense solu-
tions to improve health care delivery and af-
fordability; 
Whereas Congress has acted quickly to pro-
tect health care for the people of the United 
States in the wake of the COVID–19 pan-
demic, including expanding access to tele-
health, providing coverage for COVID–19 
tests and vaccines, and supporting health 
care providers; 
Whereas health insurance premiums in-
creased by nearly 105 percent between 2013 
and 2017, thereby making health care cov-
erage both unaffordable and inaccessible for 
many people of the United States; and 
Whereas nearly 134 rural hospitals have 
closed their doors since 2010 and the public 
health emergency has exacerbated the rural 
health crisis: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate 
that all people of the United States should 
have access to health care coverage with— 
(1) protections if they have pre-existing 
medical conditions, including— 
(A) guarantees that no citizen of the 
United States can be denied health insurance 
coverage as a result of a previous illness or 
health status; 
(B) guarantees that no citizen of the 
United States can be charged a higher pre-
mium or cost sharing as a result of a pre-
vious illness or health status; and 
(C) access to health care to ensure that the 
people of the United States with pre-existing 
medical conditions can afford to receive 
their care; 
(2) lower costs of prescription drugs and de-
vices, which can be accomplished by— 
(A) cutting red tape in the regulatory proc-
ess to bring new drugs and devices to market 
more rapidly; 
(B) lowering prices through enhanced com-
petition by reforming outdated and archaic 
patent and trademark laws; 
(C) ensuring transparency in the drug sup-
ply chain; 
(D) incentivizing domestic manufacturing 
and ending drug shortages; and 
(E) promoting policies that ensure the peo-
ple of the United States are not solely re-
sponsible 
for 
financing 
the 
biopharma-
ceutical innovation that the world depends 
on; 
(3) lower insurance premiums through in-
creased choice and competition, including 
through— 
(A) the availability of transparent infor-
mation related to the price of health insur-
ance premiums and health care procedures so 
patients can make informed decisions about 
their care; 
(B) access to association health plans, 
which have led to average premium de-
creases of up to 29 percent for small business 
owners; 
(C) State flexibility to do what is best for 
communities in that State, which in some 
cases has lowered health insurance pre-
miums up to 43 percent; 
(D) the establishment of tax-free personal 
health management accounts to empower pa-
tients to afford and personalize their own 
health care arrangements; and 
(E) expanded access to more doctors and 
specialists for veterans, those struggling 
with mental illness, and those who live in 
rural areas; 
(4) protections from surprise medical bills, 
including holding a patient harmless from 
surprise medical bills and making sure pa-
tients receive bills in a timely way; and 
(5) safeguards from costly defensive medi-
cine in the health care system, that reflect 
medical malpractice reform that addresses 
the additional costs in the medical system 
that do not improve quality of care.

Transportation: 
S. RES. 778 
Whereas school athletic programs develop 
young people physically, mentally, socially, 
and emotionally through the life lessons 
learned through participation and competi-
tion; 
Whereas interscholastic athletic participa-
tion is an integral part of a student’s edu-
cational experience and enhances the learn-
ing process; 
Whereas athletic administrators are com-
mitted to developing and maintaining com-
prehensive 
education-based 
athletic 
pro-
grams which seek the highest development 
of all student athletes; 
Whereas 
athletic 
administrators 
fulfill 
professional responsibilities with honesty, 
integrity, commitment to equity, and fair-
ness; 
Whereas athletic administrators preserve, 
enhance, and promote the educational values 
of athletics in our schools through profes-
sional growth in the areas of education, lead-
ership, and service; 
Whereas athletic administrators embody 
high standards of ethics, sportsmanship, and 
personal conduct and encourage coaching 
staffs, 
student-athletes, 
and 
community 
members to commit to these high standards 
as well; 
Whereas during the COVID–19 pandemic, 
now more than ever, we need school leaders, 
including athletic administrators, who pre-
pare, plan, and endeavor to secure student 
safety and well-being;

S. RES. 779 
Whereas, from November 1, 2020, through

brates National Native American Heritage 
Month; 
Whereas National Native American Herit-

Whereas Native Americans are descendants 
of the original, indigenous inhabitants of 
what is now the United States;

Whereas Native Americans maintain vi-
brant cultures and traditions and hold a 
deeply rooted sense of community; 
Whereas Native Americans have moving 
stories of tragedy, triumph, and persever-
ance that need to be shared with future gen-
erations; 
Whereas Native Americans speak and pre-
serve indigenous languages, which have con-
tributed to the English language by being 
used as names of individuals and locations 
throughout the United States; 
Whereas Congress has consistently re-
affirmed the support of the United States of 
Tribal self-governance and self-determina-
tion and the commitment of the United 
States to improving the lives of all Native 
Americans by— 
(1) enhancing health care and law enforce-
ment resources; and 
(2) improving the housing and socio-
economic status of Native Americans; 
Whereas the United States is committed to 
strengthening 
the 
government-to-govern-
ment relationship that the United States has 
maintained with the various Indian Tribes; 
Whereas Congress has recognized the con-
tributions of the Iroquois Confederacy and 
the influence of the Iroquois Confederacy on 
the Founding Fathers in the drafting of the 
Constitution of the United States with the 
concepts of— 
(1) freedom of speech; 
(2) the separation of governmental powers; 
and 
(3) the system of checks and balances be-
tween the branches of government; 
Whereas, with the enactment of the Native 
American Heritage Day Act of 2009 (Public 
Law 111–33; 123 Stat. 1922), Congress— 
(1) reaffirmed the government-to-govern-
ment relationship between the United States 
and Native American governments; and 
(2) recognized the important contributions 
of Native Americans to the culture of the 
United States; 
Whereas Native Americans have made dis-
tinct and important contributions to the 
United States and the rest of the world in 
many fields, including the fields of agri-
culture, medicine, music, language, and art; 
Whereas Native Americans have distin-
guished themselves as inventors, entre-
preneurs, spiritual leaders, and scholars; 
Whereas Native Americans have served 
with honor and distinction in the Armed 
Forces and continue to serve in the Armed 
Forces in greater numbers per capita than 
any other group in the United States; 
Whereas the United States has recognized 
the contribution of the Native American 
code talkers in World War I and World War 
II, who used indigenous languages as an un-
breakable military code, saving countless 
lives in the United States; and 
Whereas the people of the United States 
have reason to honor the great achievements 
and contributions of Native Americans and 
their ancestors: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes the month of November 2020 
as ‘‘National Native American Heritage

IDENTIFYING OUTPUTS OF GEN-
ERATIVE 
ADVERSARIAL 
NET-
WORKS ACT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the Sen-
ate proceed to immediate consider-
ation of Calendar No. 580, S. 2904. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the bill by title. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
A bill (S. 2904) to direct the Director of the 
National Science Foundation to support re-
search on the outputs that may be generated 
by generative adversarial networks, other-
wise known as deepfakes, and other com-
parable techniques that may be developed in 
the future, and for other purposes. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the bill, which 
had been reported from the Committee 
on Commerce, Science, and Transpor-
tation, with an amendment to strike 
all after the enacting clause and insert 
in lieu thereof the following: 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Identifying 
Outputs of Generative Adversarial Networks 
Act’’ or the ‘‘IOGAN Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Gaps currently exist on the underlying re-
search needed to develop tools that detect vid-
eos, audio files, or photos that have manipu-
lated or synthesized content, including those 
generated by generative adversarial networks. 
Research on digital forensics is also needed to 
identify, preserve, recover, and analyze the 
provenance of digital artifacts. 
(2) The National Science Foundation’s focus 
to support research in artificial intelligence 
through computer and information science and 
engineering, cognitive science and psychology, 
economics and game theory, control theory, lin-
guistics, mathematics, and philosophy, is build-
ing a better understanding of how new tech-
nologies are shaping the society and economy of 
the United States. 
(3) The National Science Foundation has 
identified the ‘‘10 Big Ideas for NSF Future In-
vestment’’ including ‘‘Harnessing the Data Rev-
olution’’ and the ‘‘Future of Work at the 
Human-Technology Frontier’’, with artificial 
intelligence is a critical component. 
(4) The outputs generated by generative ad-
versarial networks should be included under the 
umbrella of research described in paragraph (3) 
given the grave national security and societal 
impact potential of such networks. 
(5) Generative adversarial networks are not 
likely to be utilized as the sole technique of arti-
ficial intelligence or machine learning capable 
of creating credible deepfakes. Other techniques 
may be developed in the future to produce simi-
lar outputs. 
SEC. 3. NSF SUPPORT OF RESEARCH ON MANIPU-
LATED OR SYNTHESIZED CONTENT 
AND INFORMATION SECURITY. 
The Director of the National Science Founda-
tion, in consultation with other relevant Federal 
agencies, shall support merit-reviewed and com-
petitively awarded research on manipulated or 
synthesized content and information authen-
ticity, which may include— 
(1) fundamental research on digital forensic 
tools or other technologies for verifying the au-
thenticity of information and detection of ma-
nipulated or synthesized content, including con-
tent generated by generative adversarial net-
works; 
(2) fundamental research on technical tools 
for identifying manipulated or synthesized con-
tent, such as watermarking systems for gen-
erated media; 
(3) social and behavioral research related to 
manipulated or synthesized content, including 
human engagement with the content;

(4) research on public understanding and 
awareness of manipulated and synthesized con-
tent, including research on best practices for 
educating the public to discern authenticity of 
digital content; and 
(5) research awards coordinated with other 
federal agencies and programs, including the 
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency 
and 
the 
Intelligence 
Advanced 
Research 
Projects Agency, with coordination enabled by 
the Networking and Information Technology 
Research and Development Program. 
SEC. 4. NIST SUPPORT FOR RESEARCH AND 
STANDARDS ON GENERATIVE AD-
VERSARIAL NETWORKS. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—The Director of the National 
Institute of Standards and Technology shall 
support research for the development of meas-
urements and standards necessary to accelerate 
the development of the technological tools to ex-
amine the function and outputs of generative 
adversarial networks or other technologies that 
synthesize or manipulate content. 
(b) OUTREACH.—The Director of the National 
Institute of Standards and Technology shall 
conduct outreach— 
(1) to receive input from private, public, and 
academic stakeholders on fundamental measure-
ments and standards research necessary to ex-
amine the function and outputs of generative 
adversarial networks; and 
(2) to consider the feasibility of an ongoing 
public and private sector engagement to develop 
voluntary standards for the function and out-
puts of generative adversarial networks or other 
technologies that synthesize or manipulate con-
tent. 
SEC. 5. REPORT ON FEASIBILITY OF PUBLIC-PRI-
VATE PARTNERSHIP TO DETECT MA-
NIPULATED OR SYNTHESIZED CON-
TENT. 
Not later than 1 year after the date of enact-
ment of this Act, the Director of the National 
Science Foundation and the Director of the Na-
tional Institute of Standards and Technology 
shall jointly submit to the Committee on Science, 
Space, and Technology of the House of Rep-
resentatives, the Subcommittee on Commerce, 
Justice, Science, and Related Agencies of the 
Committee on Appropriations of the House of 
Representatives, the Committee on Commerce, 
Science, and Transportation of the Senate, and 
the Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, 
and Related Agencies of the Committee on Ap-
propriations of the Senate a report containing— 
(1) the Directors’ findings with respect to the 
feasibility for research opportunities with the 
private sector, including digital media compa-
nies to detect the function and outputs of gen-
erative adversarial networks or other tech-
nologies that synthesize or manipulate content; 
and 
(2) any policy recommendations of the Direc-
tors that could facilitate and improve commu-
nication and coordination between the private 
sector, the National Science Foundation, and 
relevant Federal agencies through the imple-
mentation of innovative approaches to detect 
digital content produced by generative adver-
sarial networks or other technologies that syn-
thesize or manipulate content. 
SEC. 6. GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORK DE-
FINED. 
In this Act, the term ‘‘generative adversarial 
network’’ means, with respect to artificial intel-
ligence, the machine learning process of at-
tempting to cause a generator artificial neural 
network (referred to in this paragraph as the 
‘‘generator’’ and a discriminator artificial neu-
ral network (referred to in this paragraph as a 
‘‘discriminator’’) to compete against each other 
to become more accurate in their function and 
outputs, through which the generator and dis-
criminator create a feedback loop, causing the 
generator to produce increasingly higher-quality 
artificial outputs and the discriminator to in-
creasingly improve in detecting such artificial 
outputs. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I ask unanimous 
consent that the committee-reported 
substitute be agreed to; that the bill, 
as amended, be considered read a third 
time and passed; and that the motion 
to reconsider be considered made and 
laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The committee-reported amendment 
in the nature of a substitute was 
agreed to. 
The bill (S. 2904), as amended, was or-
dered to be engrossed for a third read-
ing, was read the third time, and 
passed.

HONORING MATTHEW NICHOLAS 
SUTHERLAND 
HON. SAM GRAVES 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, November 18, 2020 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam Speaker, 
I proudly pause to recognize Matthew Nich-
olas Sutherland. Matthew is a very special 
young man who has exemplified the finest 
qualities of citizenship and leadership by tak-
ing an active part in the Boy Scouts of Amer-
ica, Troop 1376, and earning the most pres-
tigious award of Eagle Scout. 
Matthew has been very active with his 
troop, participating in many scout activities. 
Over the many years Matthew has been in-
volved with scouting, he has not only earned 
numerous merit badges, but also the respect 
of his family, peers, and community. Most no-
tably, Matthew has served his troop as patrol 
leader and earned the rank of Brave in the 
Tribe of Mic-O-Say. Matthew has also contrib-
uted to his community through his Eagle Scout 
project. Matthew made closets at the Clay 
County Museum for his Eagle Scout project. 
Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join 
me in commending Matthew Nicholas Suther-
land for his accomplishments with the Boy 
Scouts of America and for his efforts put forth 
in achieving the highest distinction of Eagle 
Scout.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF MR. GEORGE V. RAINEY 
HON. CEDRIC L. RICHMOND 
OF LOUISIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, November 18, 2020 
Mr. RICHMOND. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor the life and legacy of Mr. George V. 
Rainey who passed away on Wednesday, Oc-
tober 7, 2020 at the age of 89. He was the 
oldest Zulu king of the Zulu Social Aid and 
Pleasure Club. 
A New Orleans native, Mr. Rainey attended 
New Orleans Public School System and grad-
uated with the first senior class at Booker T. 
Washington School in 1949. He would later 
join the U.S. Army where he served in the Ko-
rean War. In 1967, Mr. Rainey started 
Rainey’s Restaurant and Catering, which 
quickly became a staple in the city. For sev-
eral decades it was one of the most prominent 
Black-owned restaurants in the area that 
served both the New Orleans Jazz and Herit-
age Festival and Essence Festival. 
In 1972, Mr. Rainey joined the Zulu Social 
Aide and Pleasure Club where he served in a 
variety of capacities for more than 45 years. In 
1978, he was elected Big Shot and starting in 
1991 he served as the organization’s vice 
president for five years. In his service as a 
Board member for more than two decades, he 
was integral to the production of Zulu’s poster 
series and its successful pursuit of corporate 
sponsorships. 
In 2005, when Hurricane Katrina struck New 
Orleans, Mr. Rainey returned home to assist 
families in need. Along with Bishop James 
Nelson Brown of Fisher Community Church 
and the 82nd Airborne Division cooks, he 
worked courageously for two months to feed 
the victims of Hurricane Katrina. 
Mr. Rainey was a treasure to the city of 
New Orleans. That is why he was honored by 
President George W. Bush and the Jefferson 
Award Foundation. He lived a fulfilled life 
doing what he loved to do for so many years. 
I am grateful for his service. I send my sincere 
prayers, condolences, and strength to the 
Rainey family during this difficult time. May his 
soul rest in peace. 
Mr. George V. Rainey’s wife, Jeanne died in 
2005. He is survived by three daughters, a 
son, and six grandchildren. 
Madam Speaker, I celebrate the life and 
legacy of Mr. George V. Rainey.

in the family. Had I been present for Roll Call

HONORING PENNSYLVANIA STATE 
REPRESENTATIVE 
JOANNA 
MCCLINTON 
HON. DWIGHT EVANS 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, November 18, 2020 
Mr. EVANS. Madam Speaker, I rise today, 
along with my colleagues, Rep. BRENDAN 
BOYLE and Rep. MARY GAY SCANLON to honor 
State Representative Joanna McClinton, who 
has been elected as the Democratic Leader of 
the 
Pennsylvania 
State 
House. 
Rep. 
McClinton will serve as the first woman and 
first woman of color elected in this role. 
Rep. McClinton is a lifelong Philadelphian. 
She is a graduate of La Salle University and 
Villanova School of Law, both located in Phila-
delphia, PA. Rep. McClinton was an Assistant 
Public Defender for seven years. In 2013, she 
entered the political field as Chief Counsel for 
State Senator Anthony H. Williams. In August 
2015, Rep. McClinton was sworn in to serve 
the people of the 191st Legislative District of 
Pennsylvania after winning a special election. 
Breaking barriers is not new to Rep. 
McClinton. In 2018, she became the first Afri-
can American and woman to be elected as the 
House Democratic Caucus chairman for the 
2019–20 legislative session. Rep. McClinton’s 
historic election makes her the highest-ranking 
woman to serve in the Pennsylvania General 
Assembly’s 244-year history and the highest 
ranking Black Woman. 
On behalf of my colleagues, we wish to ex-
tend our sincere congratulations to Rep. Jo-
anna McClinton for all her achievements and 
her continued commitment to public service 
and enhancing the quality of life for residents 
within her district and the state of Pennsyl-

REMEMBERING TOMMY PACELLO 
HON. STEVE COHEN

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, November 18, 2020 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the memory of Tommy Pacella, 
President of the Memphis Medical District Co-
operative, who passed away gracefully on 
Monday at the age of 43. Mr. Pacella did 
much to improve his hometown, particularly 
the Medical Center area, where he helped 36 
businesses open and thrive over the past six 
years. Before that, as an Assistant City Attor-
ney and at the Mayor’s Institute of Excellence 
in Government, Mr. Pacella brought best prac-
tices and a passion for improvement to his 
city, and they will be his lasting legacy. Mr. 
Pacello, a graduate of the Evangelical Chris-
tian School, the University of Georgia, and the 
University of Memphis, where he earned a law 
degree and Master’s degree in city planning, 
was uniquely qualified to tackle the urban 
issues that were his chosen field, and he ex-
celled. I was pleased to work with him on the

appreciated 
his 
thoughtful ideas for improvements that he laid 
out at a roundtable forum I hosted just last 
year. Mr. Pacello was also chairman of the 
Memphis Chapter of the Urban Land Institute, 
which named him as one of the top 40 real 
estate professionals under the age of 40 in 
2015, and he served on the Memphis Area 
Transit Authority board of commissioners. The 
way he approached his illness with a positive 
mindset and a focus on the essential was an 
inspiration to all who knew him. I express my 
profound condolences to his wife, Olivia; his 
young daughters, Colette and Cecile; his 
many friends and colleagues; and all those his 
life inspired. I have no doubt that, had he 
been given more time, he would have been 
one of our greatest civic leaders. He led a fine 
life and will be missed.’’

RECOGNIZING LUCERO STOCKETT 
FOR HER PROMOTION TO CHIEF 
MASTER SERGEANT 
HON. MARIO DIAZ-BALART 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, November 18, 2020 
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate my United States Air 
Force fellow, Lucero ‘‘Lucy’’ Stockett on her 
promotion to Chief Master Sergeant. 
Born in Mexico, Lucy was raised in El Paso, 
Texas, and, at the age of seventeen, enlisted 
in the United States Air Force (USAF). She 
began her impressive career in the USAF as 
an inflight refueling operator, with her primary 
specialty being a KC–10 Boom Operator. 
Lucy’s experience includes qualifications as a 
Boom Operator Instructor, Formal Training 
Unit Instructor, and Evaluator. She has had 
multiple deployments supporting Operations 
ENDURING FREEDOM and IRAQI FREE-
DOM. While enlisted, Lucy has continued to 
learn and better herself, receiving a B.S. in 
Sports Medicine from American Military Uni-
versity in 2014, and an M.A. in Executive 
Leadership from Liberty University in 2017. 
It has been a privilege having Lucy in my of-
fice this year. She is bright, passionate, eager 
to learn, and a true patriot. As an enlisted offi-
cer, she brings invaluable experience and ex-
pertise regarding our nation’s defense. My 
staff and I have valued having her as a mem-
ber of our team and we are proud to be a part 
of this important milestone for her. 
It would be remiss to recognize Lucy without 
touching on why her promotion is such an im-
pressive accomplishment. With Chief Master 
Sergeant being the highest enlisted rank in the 
Air Force, Lucy’s promotion is an inspiration 
for all young women who are interested in a 
career in our Armed Forces. She has shown 
that with dedication, hard work, and persever-
ance, any dream can be achieved. 
Madam Speaker, it has been an honor to 
work with Chief Master Sergeant Lucero 
Stockett this year, and to pay tribute to her 
well-deserved promotion. l ask my fellow col-
leagues to join me in recognizing this remark-
able individual. 
HONORING 
STAMEY’S 
BARBECUE 
IN GREENSBORO, NORTH CARO-
LINA 
HON. TED BUDD 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, November 18, 2020 
Mr. BUDD. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Stamey’s Barbecue in Greensboro, 
North Carolina, which this year is celebrating 
90 years of exceptional business. 
Founded in 1930, Stamey’s is renowned 
across my district for its Lexington-style bar-
becue, which involves cooking pork exclu-
sively over hardwood coals and with their own 
original dip. Stamey’s pitmasters arrive well 
before sunrise to begin a laborious cooking 
process that can take up to ten hours. 
There is a saying at Stamey’s that, ‘‘good 
barbecue takes patience and an acute taste 
for perfection,’ and their reputation across the 
state backs up that commitment to excellence. 
Stamey’s founder C. Warner Stamey was 
born in 1911 as the youngest of 11 children. 
After moving to Lexington, Mr. Stamey sold 
pork in tents across the street from the court-
house with talented barbecue men Jess 
Swicegood and Sid Weaver. In 1938, Mr. 
Stamey bought Swicegood’s Barbecue and re-
named it Stamey’s. 
In 1953, Mr. Stamey opened the 2206 W. 
Gate City Blvd, Greensboro location, which 
was later joined by the 2812 Battleground 
Ave, Greensboro location in 1970. Warner 
eventually handed the business off to his son 
Charles who was later joined by his brother 
Keith Stamey in 1970. In 1993, current owner 
Chip Stamey joined the family business. 
Sadly, Keith passed away in 2000, but 
Charles Stamey still resides in Greensboro 
where 
he 
proudly 
serves 
as 
barbecue 
pitmaster emeritus. 
Madam Speaker, treasured family establish-
ments like Stamey’s Barbecue give character 
and richness to the districts we represent. I 
am proud to have Stamey’s in North Caro-
lina’s 13th Congressional District, which is a 
source of great pride in our community. I ask 
that you please join me in both congratulating 
them on 90 years in business and wishing 
them well as they embark on the next 90 
years.

CELEBRATING PUERTO RICO’S 
CHEMIST DAY 
HON. JENNIFFER GONZA´LEZ-COLO´ N 
OF PUERTO RICO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, November 18, 2020 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N of Puerto Rico. 
Madam Speaker, as we celebrate Puerto Rico 
Chemist’s Day, I would like to thank these pro-
fessionals for their extraordinary and invalu-
able contributions to the advancement of 
science, public health and safety and both 
basic and applied research and development. 
Their core scientific disciplines are essential 
for every technology we enjoy today, and their 
work helps create, deliver and ensure the 
safety of foods, fuels, drinking water, clean air, 
drugs and medical supplies, industrial proc-
esses, raw and processed materials and fin-
ished products that are indispensable to our 
society. 
In particular, chemical scientists play a key 
role in many of Puerto Rico’s prime industries, 
including most notably the biopharmaceutical 
and medical devices industry, as well as the 
aerospace and agriculture sectors, which are 
central to the economic development of the Is-
land. 
I especially want to recognize today the 
Puerto Rico Chemists’ Association, which is 
celebrating its 79th annual conference with 
this year’s theme: The Chemist, Always Cre-
ating Solutions for our Society. 
Since 1941, this organization has acquired 
significant scientific and technical expertise to 
move Puerto Rico forward, while also main-
taining standards of excellence in such a dis-
tinguished profession, promoting unity among 
its members, and increasing understanding 
and education of the chemical sciences. 
With the great need for the expansion of 
scientific knowledge and its application to ad-
dress the needs of a changing world, it is just 
that we recognize the work of this branch of 
the sciences, encourage new generations of 
students to pursue this discipline, and support 
them in their continued tasks.

IN RECOGNITION OF JOHN KUHNLE 
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, November 18, 2020 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of John Kuhnle, and his 
dedicated service to Virginia’s First District. 
John joined my Stafford District Office two 
years ago as a part of the Wounded Warrior 
Fellowship Program and has been an integral 
part of our team ever since. 
John has been a significant member of the 
District 
Team 
in 
Virginia’s 
First 
District 
throughout these past two years. He was dedi-
cated to handling military and veteran case-
work, and he provided years of knowledge 
and experience to the office. John never shied 
away from a challenge, and he would spend 
hours researching the latest information on 
veteran affairs and military topics in order to 
assist constituents. 
John is a model caseworker. Staff routinely 
went to John for advice and guidance on mili-
tary and veteran affairs procedure. John set 
the bar high, and often went above and be-
yond to make sure veterans and their families 
received the information and help they need-
ed. I am confident that constituents in Vir-
ginia’s First District have been in good hands 
for the past two years, through the selfless 
service of John Kuhnle. 
John’s last day with my office is on Decem-
ber 3, 2020 and he will be dearly missed by 
our entire staff. Therefore, Madam Speaker, I 
ask that you rise with me in recognition of 
John Kuhnle, and I would like to thank John 
for his service to Virginia’s First District.

HONORING BRENON D. CARR 
HON. SAM GRAVES 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, November 18, 2020 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam Speaker, 
I proudly pause to recognize Brenon D. Carr. 
Brenon is a very special young man who has 
exemplified the finest qualities of citizenship 
and leadership by taking an active part in the 
Boy Scouts of America, Troop 1376, and earn-
ing the most prestigious award of Eagle Scout. 
Brenon has been very active with his troop, 
participating in many scout activities. Over the 
many years Brenon has been involved with 
scouting, he has not only earned numerous 
merit badges, but also the respect of his fam-
ily, peers, and community. Most notably, 
Brenon has served his troop as Den Chief and 
earned the rank of Warrior in the Tribe of Mic- 
O-Say. Brenon has also contributed to his 
community through his Eagle Scout project. 
Brenon planted four raised vegetable garden 
beds for Life Unlimited, a group home for 
adults with special needs in Liberty, Missouri. 
Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join 
me in commending Brenon D. Carr for his ac-
complishments with the Boy Scouts of Amer-
ica and for his efforts put forth in achieving the 
highest distinction of Eagle Scout.

RETIREMENT OF CHP 
COMMISSIONER WARREN STANLEY 
HON. KAREN BASS 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, November 18, 2020 
Ms. BASS. Madam Speaker, I have the 
honor of recognizing a public servant who has 
given 40 years of outstanding service to my 
state: California Highway Patrol Commissioner 
Warren Stanley, who retired on November 16, 
2020. He is one of only a few people in the 
history of the CHP to hold every position, from 
Officer to its top executive. Governor Edmund 
G. Brown, Jr. appointed him as the 56th Com-
missioner of the California Highway Patrol 
(CHP) in 2017, the first African American to 
attain the rank of Commissioner in the history 
of the agency. 
I first worked with him when he became 
Chief of CHP’s Southern Division while I was 
the California Assembly Speaker. I greatly val-
ued his ability to serve as a bridge between 
the CHP and local residents, a role he would 
play for his entire career. 
Warren’s career focus led to his assignment 
as a member of the Protective Services Detail 
and as a Field Training Officer. He excelled 
and rose through the ranks, supervising the 
CHP’s Border Division Investigative Services 
Unit as a Lieutenant, and then serving as 
Commander of the CHP Academy. He has 
completed many elite training programs, in-
cluding the FBI National Executive Institute. 
He reached the rank of Chief in 2008 and 
assumed command of Coastal, then Southern 
division. Before his appointment as Commis-
sioner, he served as Deputy Commissioner, 
responsible for the day to day operation of the 
largest state law enforcement agency in the’ 
nation, with more than 11,000 employees in 
his charge. 
As a law enforcement leader, Commissioner 
Stanley has spearheaded a number of innova-
tive highway and traffic safety initiatives, in-
cluding the Impaired Driving Section, respon-
sible for implementing new laws facilitating 
new research into how cannabis affects driv-
ing behaviors. Commissioner Stanley worked 
to bolster the Highway Safety Corridor Pro-
gram, which has promoted education, enforce-
ment and coordination on California’s road-
ways with high crash rates. Under his leader-
ship, the CHP achieved a national profile in 
addressing the special needs and concerns of 
elderly drivers, as well as collaborating on ini-
tiatives to promote responsible driving among 
teens. 
Warren’s first commitment has always been 
to the people, both those under his command 
and the communities that they serve. He will 
be remembered for his humility and for his 
compassionate leadership style. I wish him 
and his family all the best wherever the next 
chapter of life may take him.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF 
ROGER 
LEE 
WILSON 
OF 
SALISBURY, NORTH CAROLINA 
HON. TED BUDD 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, November 18, 2020 
Mr. BUDD. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life and legacy of Roger Lee Wilson 
of Salisbury, North Carolina, who passed 
away on October 18, 2020. 
Roger was a husband to Kate and a father 
to Matt and Wesley. As a member of Unity 
Presbyterian Church, he faithfully served as 
an Elder. 
Throughout his life, Roger was a devoted 
and dedicated educator, mentoring and inspir-
ing countless students at Davie County High 
School and West Rowan High School. Roger 
passed on his passion for woodworking and 
craftsmanship to his students. I just missed 
having Roger as my workshop instructor at 
Davie High, but was lucky enough to have his 
successor, his son Matt, as my teacher . 
Madam Speaker, I have had the privilege of 
representing Rowan County as well as my 
home county of Davie since 2017. I know first-
hand how much appreciation there is for the 
knowledge and skills that Mr. Wilson passed 
on to his students. Though he had been re-
tired from teaching for quite some time, I 
imagine he was encouraged to know that 
schools have begun to again prioritize teach-
ing the technical, trade, and hands-on skills 
that seem to have been forgotten over the 
past few decades. 
Madam Speaker, our country needs more 
dedicated men serving and educating their 
communities like Roger Wilson. The benefits 
he brought to students and to his community 
will be felt for generations to come.

2 
MARWAN 
SAMEH 
GHABOUR 
HON. LORI TRAHAN 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, November 18, 2020 
Mrs. TRAHAN. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor the memory of a son of Massachusetts, 
Chief Warrant Officer 2 Marwan Sameh 
Ghabour. He and four other brave American 
soldiers tragically lost their lives on Thursday, 
November 12 while on a peacekeeping mis-
sion in Egypt. 
Mr. Ghabour will be remembered as a hero 
for his valiant service and commitment to pro-
tecting the freedoms and values that all Ameri-
cans hold dear. This tragic loss serves as a 
reminder that when our troops bravely volun-
teer to serve, both they and their loved ones 
sacrifice more than we can ever imagine. My 
heart goes out to Mr. Ghabour’s family and 
friends during this difficult time. 
Nevertheless, his legacy is secured by the 
many people who carry his memory forward. 
In particular, the residents of Marlborough and 
Arlington, Massachusetts, where he grew up 
and volunteered, will remember his passion for 
public service. 
I am grateful for patriots like Mr. Ghabour 
who risk everything to make the United States 
and the world a better place and are prepared 
to give the ‘‘last full measure of their devo-
tion,’’ as President Lincoln said. We are fortu-
nate that such brave men and women are 
among us. 
Marwan Sameh Ghabour and his fellow 
servicemembers will never be forgotten. 
IN RECOGNITION OF RENEE 
REYNOLDS 
HON. BRENDAN F. BOYLE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, November 18, 2020 
Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, it is my honor to recognize 
Renee Reynolds, a Philadelphia difference- 
maker, before the United States House of 
Representatives. Ms. Reynolds is a fiercely 
vocal advocate for women who are battling to 
beat cancer and who are overcoming domes-
tic violence committed against them. 
As she so powerfully puts it, Ms. Reynolds 
is a domestic violence victor who, for four dec-
ades, has used her first-hand experience to 
fuel her efforts to empower women seeking to 
change their own difficult and trying situations. 
In addition to hosting the annual Pink Dia-
mond Ball to honor the two sisters she lost to 
cancer and to honor cancer patients, survivors 
and those that fought the good fight, Ms. Rey-
nolds has sought to expand her ability to 
spread her message and reach those who 
need help during the coronavirus pandemic. 
Among her efforts to do this, she became the 
Pennsylvania contestant in this year’s national 
Ms. Woman competition, where her platform 
focused on her advocacy. 
Through social media, public speaking, 
events, partnerships and seemingly more out-
reach than should be humanly possible, Ms. 
Reynolds has committed herself to helping 
people and providing a first-person tale of re-
demption that highlights her rise from domes-
tic-violence victim to entertainer, business pro-
fessional and an advocate for women who 
need a helping hand and inspiration. 
Renee Reynolds embodies a commitment to 
public good. Her efforts are a model for the 
upwelling of selflessness and giving that has 
kept America going through these difficult 
times. She embodies the spirit of Philadelphia. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in extending our sincerest appreciation to 
Renee Reynolds for her extraordinary work on 
behalf of our community.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF THE ‘‘FATHER OF THE FINAL 
FOUR’’ TOM JERNSTEDT 
HON. SUSAN W. BROOKS 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, November 18, 2020 
Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor the life and legacy of 
Thomas Walter Jernstedt, a National Colle-
giate Athletic Association (NCAA) legend and 
tireless advocate for men and women student 
athletes across the country. Tom was known 
for many things in his career and life, including 
being referred to as the ‘‘Father of the Final 
Four.’’ I join Tom’s family, friends, colleagues 
and athletes across the country in mourning 
the loss of this great man who passed away 
on September 5, 2020. 
Tom was born on November 24, 1944, in 
Carlton, 
Oregon. 
Tom 
attended 
Yamhill- 
Carlton High School, where he was an all- 
state athlete in three sports: football, basket-
ball and baseball. On top of his incredible ath-
letic ability, he was also elected student body

president. Upon his graduation, Tom attended 
the University of Oregon on a football scholar-
ship, where he was again elected student 
body president. He graduated in 1967 with a 
degree in political science and went on to re-
ceive a master’s in education in 1973. He 
worked as an events manager at his alma 
mater until he accepted a full-time position as 
director of events for the NCAA. 
Tom spent the next 38 years working for the 
NCAA, as a leader and passionate adminis-
trator. According to his colleagues and those 
who worked closely with Tom, he was known 
to make time for everyone. He was thoughtful, 
respectable, likeable, honest and a silent 
power. He is credited with turning the college 
basketball championship into what it is today, 
a massive event with fans all around the world 
and a multi-billion dollar television contract. 
The City of lndianapolis benefited greatly 
from having a leader like Tom in the sports 
world. He was influential in moving the NCAA 
headquarters from Kansas City, Missouri to 
the City of Indianapolis in 1999. Tom not only 
assisted in making March Madness what it is, 
he was key in helping the City of Indianapolis 
host the Final Four. Indianapolis has hosted 
seven NCAA Men’s Basketball Final Fours 
and three NCAA Women’s Final Fours in its 
history and is scheduled to host the 2021 and 
2026 men’s finals as well. Tom was very 
friendly to the City of Indianapolis in many 
ways, generating events, promoting the city 
and, according to his friends, there was never 
a young person who was interested in a ca-
reer in sports that Tom would not take under 
his wing. 
Tom received numerous awards throughout 
his lifetime including being inducted into the 
Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in 2017. He 
received the John W. Bunn Lifetime Achieve-
ment Award in 2001 for his outstanding life-
time dedication to basketball, and the Univer-
sity of Oregon honored him with the Distin-
guished Alumnus Award. The National Colle-
giate Basketball Hall of Fame enshrined Tom 
as a contributor to the game, and in 2017, he 
was awarded Indiana’s highest civilian honor, 
the Sagamore of the Wabash. Posthumously, 
Tom was inducted into the Oregon Sports Hall 
of Fame this year. 
Though it is obvious Tom had a huge im-
pact on the world of sports, it is said that his 
greatest joys were in his personal life. He was 
a loving husband, father, grandfather, brother, 
uncle, cousin and true friend. In speaking with 
Tom’s friends, there is one consistent theme 
that they all mention. Tom was a wonderful 
friend who would stop at nothing to help those 
he cared about. He loved playing golf and 
watching all sporting events with his family 
and friends. Though he loved all sports, he re-
mained a loyal fan of his Oregon Ducks, rarely 
missing an event involving his university. 
Based on this long-term commitment, the Uni-
versity of Oregon has established the Tom 
Jernstedt Student Athlete Scholarship. 
I am honored to stand today and memori-
alize Tom. He was a man of character and 
class, constantly putting the wants and needs 
of others before his own. I join his family and 
many friends as well as countless student-ath-
letes in mourning the loss of Tom Jernstedt. 
CELEBRATING THE RETIREMENT 
OF VICTOR BIRD 
HON. TOM COLE 
OF OKLAHOMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, November 18, 2020 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
congratulate Mr. Victor Bird on his retirement 
after a remarkable 36-year career in public 
service to the state of Oklahoma. 
Graduating with a bachelor’s degree and 
juris doctorate from the University of Tulsa, 
Victor is a lifelong Oklahoman. After grad-
uating, he started his career in law with the 
public sector. Victor’s career in public service 
started in 1983 in the Oklahoma Attorney 
General’s office. From there he served at 
Oklahoma State University, the Office of the 
Lieutenant Governor, and again the Attorney 
General’s office under two different attorney 
generals. It was through this impressive path 
that led him to the Oklahoma Aeronautics 
Commission as the Director in 2002. With no 
previous aviation experience, Victor recog-
nized the importance of the aviation industry 
for Oklahoma and immediately put his knowl-
edge of the state to work. 
After 18 years at the Oklahoma Aeronautics 
Commission, few have left such a legacy. As 
the longest serving director in the state’s his-
tory, his advocacy and implementations have 
left a distinctive mark on Oklahoma’s role in 
aviation and aerospace. Under his leadership, 
the Commission has invested $71 million in 
state funds and directed $189 million in fed-
eral funds into airport infrastructure statewide. 
Victor’s pro aviation mindset has led to the 
growth of the annual economic impact to $44 
billion, which has directly resulted in tens of 
thousands of jobs. Victor Bird played a key 
role in shaping aviation to become one of the 
state’s largest industries and top employers. 
Victor’s career has largely gone unnoticed. 
He is the first and only Oklahoman to serve as 
chairman of the National Association of State 
Aviation Officials in its 90-year history. He is 
also the first and only non-elected public offi-
cial to receive the Joseph B. ‘‘Doc’’ Hartranft 
Jr. Award from the Aircraft Owners & Pilots 
Association. In 2006, he received the Distin-
guished Service Award from the Oklahoma 
Association for Career and Technical Edu-
cation for his contributions to career and tech-
nology education in Oklahoma. In 2009, Bird 
was the recipient of the prestigious General 
Thomas P. Stafford Award, which recognizes 
those who have made substantial contribu-
tions to the Oklahoma aerospace industry and 
who reflect the revolutionary spirit of Gen. 
Stafford. Additionally, in 2017, Bird received 
the Kenneth A. Rowe Ambassador of Aviation 
Award from NASAO in honor of his national 
accomplishments. Most recently, in 2020, Vic-
tor received the President’s Award from the 
Oklahoma Airport Operators Association for 
his significant work in Oklahoma aviation. 
For four decades, Victor Bird’s dedication to 
Oklahoma has continued to help our state 
make enormous strides in terms of economic 
growth and innovation. As we reflect on the 
36-year career of Victor Bird, let us look at his 
tireless work to inspire us. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in congratulating Mr. Victor Bird on an 
extraordinary career and wish him all the best 
in his much-deserved retirement. 
HONORING THE LEGACY OF MS. 
JEAN D. THOMPSON 
HON. CEDRIC L. RICHMOND 
OF LOUISIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, November 18, 2020 
Mr. RICHMOND. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor the legacy and work of Louisiana Free-
dom Rider, Ms. Jean D. Thompson. Ms. 
Thompson made history by participating in the 
Freedom Rides that helped illuminate persist-
ence segregation in the South despite Morgan 
v. Virginia and Boynton v. Virginia. 
Born in Lake Providence, Louisiana on Jan-
uary 13, 1942, Ms. Thompson was an active 
member of the NAACP and Congress of Ra-
cial Equality (CORE). Throughout her life, Ms. 
Thompson participated in a number of sit-ins, 
was active in Louisiana and Mississippi Free-
dom Summers, and contributed to anti-war 
and feminist efforts in San Francisco and 
Berkeley, California. Starting at the age of 19, 
her passion and determination made her one 
of the youngest trailblazers for racial equity. 
In response to the federal government’s un-
willingness to enforce the U.S. Supreme 
Court’s decisions outlawing segregated inter-
state travel, the Freedom Riders rode inte-
grated buses across state lines in the South to 
bring awareness to local laws that still re-
quired blacks and whites to use separate seat-
ing. These intentional actions played a key 
role in the Civil Rights Movement. 
Ms. Thompson is a daughter of New Orle-
ans, and without her desegregation efforts, 
persistence against injustice, and fearless-
ness, many of us would not be where we are 
today. It is critically important that we give Ms. 
Thompson her flowers while she is still here 
with us so we can celebrate the strides she 
took to improve racial equality. May we always 
lift up her name and honor her legacy by con-
tinuing to advance equal rights and justice for 
African Americans and those of African de-
scent all around the world. 
Madam Speaker, I celebrate the life and 
work of Ms. Jean D. Thompson.

scouting, he has not only earned numerous 
merit badges, but also the respect of his fam-
ily, peers, and community. Most notably, 
Thomas has served his troop as Patrol Leader 
and earned the rank of Runner in the Tribe of 
Mic–0–Say. Thomas has also contributed to 
his community through his Eagle Scout 
project. Thomas built bat houses for the Mis-
souri Department of Conservation. 
Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join 
me in commending Thomas J. Mann, IV for 
his accomplishments with the Boy Scouts of 
America and for his efforts put forth in achiev-
ing the highest distinction of Eagle Scout.

HONORING THE LIFE OF SAMUEL 
FIGUEROA 
HON. JIM BANKS 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, November 18, 2020 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life and service of Mr. Samuel 
Figueroa of Indianapolis, Indiana. 
Samuel Figueroa was an outstanding em-
ployee who worked at the Creekside Health 
and Rehabilitation Center in Indianapolis. Hav-
ing worked at the center since its opening in 
September 2017, Mr. Figueroa was a dish-
washer. We are only aware of his role as dish-
washer and are unaware of work in road and 
building construction. Those who had the op-
portunity to witness Mr. Figueroa work wit-
nessed a man who took great pride in his job. 
While on the clock, Mr. Figueroa routinely 
made others smile and laugh. He was also 
careful to ensure that the facility was as clean 
as possible. On many occasions, fellow em-
ployees witnessed Samuel scanning the park-
ing lot for trash to dispose of. 
By all accounts, Mr. Figueroa was the 
model employee. Always on time with a smile 
on his face and willing to go the extra mile, he 
desired to serve those in need. Mr. Figueroa 
will be remembered for the wonderful impres-
sion he made on his peers, residents and all 
those who interreacted with him on the cam-
pus. 
The story of Mr. Figueroa is one that is 
uniquely American. This record is a testament 
to those ideals he embodied of service and 
sacrifice, which are inherent to the American 
spirit. Though Samuel is no longer with us, his 
spirit of good will and generosity in the halls 
of Creekside and in the hearts of those whose 
lives he touched endures. 
THANKS BLAKE 
HON. BILLY LONG 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, November 18, 2020 
Mr. LONG. Madam Speaker, today I rise to 
pay tribute to a great man and citizen of the 
Show Me state, Mr. Blake Hurst, as he cele-
brates his upcoming retirement. Since being 
elected the President of the Missouri Farm Bu-
reau on December 7, 2010, Blake has helped 
strengthen the Bureau financially and grow its 
influence in Washington, D.C. 
The Missouri Farm Bureau was founded as 
the first state Farm Bureau in the United 
States in 1915, and over the years, it has 
grown to include over 130,000 members. Dur-
ing his tenure, Blake was a strong advocate 
for Missouri’s farmers. He will be leaving the 
Missouri Farm Bureau in a stronger position 
than when he came into office and has en-
sured the long-term success and influence of 
the organization. 
Blake has been an active member of the 
Missouri Farm Bureau for much of his life, 
serving on the Young Farmers & Ranchers 
Committee before becoming the statewide 
chairman and eventually serving on the state 
board of directors. For eight years, Hurst 
served is a district board member for the state 
of Missouri and seven years as the Vice Presi-
dent of the Bureau. Blake has earned a na-
tional reputation as a leader in agriculture pol-
icy. Over the years, Blake has written numer-
ous pieces which have appeared in the Wall 
Street Journal, The American, Weekly Stand-
ard, Wilson’s Quarterly, Reader’s Digest, To-
day’s Farmer, and the Show Me magazine of 
Missouri Farm Bureau. Hurst continues to be 
an active member of his community, running a 
wholesale greenhouse business with his wife, 
Julie, daughter, Lee; and sons-in-law, Ryan 
Harms and Matt Schlueter. 
I wish Blake the very best as he embarks 
on this new chapter of life, and I am grateful 
for his service to his community.

TRIBUTE TO BRIAN POTTS 
HON. KAY GRANGER 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, November 18, 2020 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Brian Potts, a member of the 
professional staff of the House Appropriations 
Committee, who has retired after 25 years of 
service in the Federal Government. 
Brian earned his bachelor’s degree from In-
diana University of Pennsylvania in 1994, 
where he played football and studied account-
ing. Upon graduation, Brian began his career 
as part of the Department of the Navy Finan-
cial Management Trainee Program. During this 
time, he worked as an auditor for the Naval 
Audit Service and as a budget analyst for the 
Office of the Under Secretary of Defense 
(Comptroller). Brian excelled in the program, 
and he was awarded the Office of the Sec-
retary of Defense Award for Excellence. 
After completion of this program, in 1997, 
Brian joined the House Appropriations Sub-
committee on Military Construction as a pro-
fessional staff member. After leaving the Hill 
briefly to work as an auditor for the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission, Brian re-
turned to the House Appropriations Committee 
Subcommittee on Military Construction. In 
2004, Brian moved to the Senate Sub-
committee on Defense where he would stay 
until 2014, at which time he became Minority 
Staff Director for the Senate Appropriations 
Subcommittee on Military Construction, Vet-
erans Affairs, and Related Agencies. 
When the Senate switched control in 2015, 
Brian was hired to be the Majority Staff Direc-
tor 
for 
the 
Senate 
Appropriations 
Sub-
committee on Defense, a position responsible 
for a portfolio exceeding $500 billion in annual 
spending. In 2019, I asked Brian to become 
my National Security Advisor on my House 
Appropriations Committee staff, and he proved 
to be a trusted advisor. Brian could always be 
counted on to give great insight into the issues 
that face our men and women in uniform. 
Brian is known for his love of sports, and I 
know he is enjoying retirement with his son, 
Owen, and attending his baseball and basket-
ball games. We wish Brian the best in his new 
adventure and thank him for everything he has 
done for our nation’s security.

INTRODUCTION OF A BILL TO RE-
QUIRE AN ACCREDITATION PROC-
ESS FOR EDX TESTING 
HON. GREG WALDEN 
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, November 18, 2020 
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to introduce a bill that will combat bad actors 
taking advantage of Medicare by requiring an 
accreditation process for electrodiagnostic 
studies or EDX testing. 
EDX testing is used to diagnose and guide 
treatment for neuromuscular conditions that 
range from the uncomfortable, such as carpal 
tunnel syndrome, to the life threatening, such 
as ALS and muscular dystrophy. Current Pro-
cedural Terminology requires that a clinician 
trained in EDX testing personally perform 
invasive needle electromyography and either 
perform or directly supervise nerve conduction 
studies. These requirements ensure proper 
testing is guided in real time based on bio-
feedback from active study and a knowledge 
of health history and potential diagnoses. 
An ongoing challenge for EDX testing has 
been an increase of fraud and abuse when 
mobile labs send ‘‘technicians’’ to provide an 
excessive number of tests that are often not 
medically necessary and tend to be performed 
poorly, providing inaccurate results that are 
not clinically relevant. A 2014 report by the 
HHS OIG entitled ‘‘Questionable Billing for 
Medicare Electrodiagnostic Tests’’ found $139 
million in annual suspicious spending in this 
area. 
This bill will require that professionals per-
forming EDX testing first demonstrate that 
they have the proper equipment to conduct 
the test. Second, professionals must dem-
onstrate that they have the proper training to 
interpret the results by going through an ac-
creditation process managed by government 
entities and professional societies. Accredita-
tion has been successful in combating fraud in 
other patient areas such as mammography 
and sleep labs. 
This bill will protect patients seeking treat-
ment by ensuring they receive the most accu-
rate results possible and I strongly urge my 
colleagues support for its passage.

CELEBRATING THE ALLIANCE BE-
TWEEN 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES 
AND THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA 
HON. ED CASE 
OF HAWAII 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, November 18, 2020 
Mr. CASE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
celebrate and honor the longstanding friend-
ship and continued alliance between two great 
nations: the United States and the Republic of 
Korea. 
Seventy years ago, American and Allied 
servicemembers and civilians bravely came to 
the defense of South Korea, fighting alongside 
so many brave Korean citizens against North 
Korean aggression. While three long years of 
bitter conflict yielded only a stalemate, from 
the shared sacrifice and courage of millions 
emerged an enduring alliance and friendship 
between the United States and South Korea 
based on a common vision for the world and 
shared values for our peoples. The Mutual De-
fense Treaty between the United States and 
the Republic of Korea endures to this day as 
a pillar of stability for the entire lndoPacific re-
gion. And in just the three generations since 
the Korean War, South Korea has emerged as 
one of Asia’s great success stories, building a 
dynamic and diverse economy with a vibrant 
civil society and popular culture celebrated the 
world over. 
However, the relationship between the 
American and Korean peoples goes even 
deeper than the Korean War. In 1882, rep-
resentatives of the United States and the 
Joseon Dynasty established diplomatic rela-
tions between their countries through the 
Treaty of Peace, Amity, Commerce and Navi-
gation. This was the first treaty Korea signed 
with a Western power, a treaty that first ac-
knowledged Korea’s status as an independent 
country. 
My Hawaii has also played and continues to 
play a major role in the strong relationship be-
tween our two countries. In 1903, the first Ko-
rean immigrants arrived in the United States 
through Hawaii, and I am proud of Hawaii’s 
history and present as the gateway for new 
generations of Korean American immigrants 
and as a major bridge between our countries 
and peoples. Today, there are over two million 
Korean Americans across the United States, 
with almost 35,000 residing in my home state 
of Hawaii. It is a true honor to represent such 
a diverse and accomplished community that 
has contributed so much to the richness of 
Hawaii. 
Today, this House passed two resolutions 
recognizing the importance of the U.S.-South 
Korea alliance. H. Res. 809 expresses the im-
portance of the United States alliance with the 
Republic of Korea and the contributions of Ko-
rean Americans in the United States, and H. 
Res. 1012 recognizes the 70th anniversary of 
the outbreak of the Korean War and the trans-
formation of the United States-Korea alliance 
into a mutually beneficial, global partnership. 
I am proud to support both resolutions and 
will continue to pursue opportunities to 
strengthen this crucial relationship, as well as 
to support Korean American communities in 
Hawaii and across the country. 
Thank you: (Gam-sa-ham-ni-da and mahalo)

RECOGNIZING WAUKEGAN TO 
COLLEGE 
HON. BRADLEY SCOTT SCHNEIDER 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, November 18, 2020 
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Madam Speaker, I am so 
pleased to rise today to celebrate an amazing 
program in my community, Waukegan to Col-
lege, and to honor this year’s class: Alexis 
Valdovinos, Moises Arreola-Malagon, Daisy 
Camacho, Maurice Davison Jr., Diana Diaz, 
Justin Garcia, Jesus Murillo, Jose Ochoa, 
Giselle Palomar, Emilio Salgado, and Gabriela 
Serna-Gutierrez. 
A year-round college readiness service, the 
Waukegan to College program, or W2C for 
short, launched in 2009. Over the course of 
students studies, W2C seeks to advance indi-
vidual’s intellectual and emotional develop-
ment, cultivating a strong commitment to com-
munity and a profound belief that they can 
build a brighter future for themselves, their 
families and their communities. By establishing 
high academic expectations and counseling 
students and their families on the college ap-
plication process, W2C helps students realize 
their full potential by making the dream of col-
lege a reality. 
All of these students will be the first in their 
families to attend college, and were selected 
for the W2C program due to their impressive 
academic achievements and their contribu-
tions to their local communities. As leaders in-
side and outside the classroom, these stu-
dents show tremendous dedication and poten-
tial. 
Strengthening our communities requires 
building new ladders of opportunity so that all 
Americans can succeed and thrive. This be-
gins with providing every child, regardless of 
zip code, access to a high quality, affordable 
education, and continues by ensuring all fami-
lies can afford to send their sons and daugh-
ters to college. 
When our nation’s talented young people 
pursue their passions and follow their dreams, 
they accomplish far more than personal 
growth. They serve as role models in their 
communities and their achievements inspire 
and motivate other young people to equally 
strive and achieve. 
These students truly are Champions of 
Change. I wish them the very best of luck in 
their academic studies and in all their future 
endeavors.

RECOOGNIZING JERRY THORNE 
HON. ERIC SWALWELL 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, November 18, 2020 
Mr. 
SWALWELL 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise to recognize my friend, Jerry 
Thorne, on the occasion of his retirement from 
service to the City of Pleasanton, California, 
one of the largest cities in my congressional 
district. 
Jerry has made public service a way of life. 
After completing commitments to the United 
States Army and the Anny National Guard Of-
ficer Corps, he left the military holding the 
rank of captain. He then transitioned into the 
tech world with a decades-long career in glob-
al operations management, facilities design, 
and environmental engineering for some of the 
most recognizable names in Silicon Valley. 
During that time, Jerry settled in Pleasanton, 
where he has made his home for over 40 
years. 
His service to the city began in 1995 when 
Jerry became Parks and Recreation Commis-
sioner. He chaired that commission for ten 
years before making his first successful run for 
the Pleasanton City Council. After three terms 
on the council from 2005 to 2012, he decided 
to take the reins and run for mayor. He won 
that race and Jerry dutifully served as mayor 
of the City of Pleasanton for four two-year 
terms. 
During Jerry’s tenure, Pleasanton went 
through a remarkable period of growth. It is 
now home to numerous start-up and estab-
lished technology and biotechnology compa-
nies, enabling employees to work near where 
they want to live. He also helped oversee the

development of several new parks and an 
aquatic center. And, Jerry has worked to en-
sure that the city commits to and invests in a 
high-quality education for Pleasanton’s chil-
dren. This has helped establish Pleasanton 
Unified School District as one of the premier 
districts in California. 
All the organizations to which Jerry has de-
voted his time and energy are too numerous 
to mention. However, I would like to highlight 
his role as a founding member of the 
Pleasanton Sentinels of Freedom. This group 
focuses its efforts on providing opportunities 
for veterans who have suffered severe injuries 
as a result of their service. I also appreciate 
Jerry’s guidance as he serves as one of my 
Service Academy Nomination Board members; 
that board helps me recommend some of the 
best and brightest student constituents for ad-
mission into some of our country’s finest edu-
cational institutions and begin careers of serv-
ice themselves. 
I thank Jerry. While I look forward to con-
tinuing to work with him on mutual areas of in-
terest in our community, his retirement is well 
earned, and I hope he is able to enjoy more 
time at home with his wife, daughter, and 
grandchildren.

SUPPORTING MOTION TO GO TO 
CONFERENCE ON H.R. 6395 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, November 18, 2020 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to speak in strong support of all the Jackson 
Lee Amendments made in order for consider-
ation of the William M. (Mac) Thornberry Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal 
Year 2021. 
I thank Chairman SMITH and Ranking Mem-
ber THORNBERRY and their staffs for working 
with me and my staff in consideration of sev-
eral Jackson Lee Amendments. 
I offered several amendments to H.R. 6395 
to improve the bill. 
Jackson Lee Amendment 180 directs the 
Secretary of Defense to report to Congress 
the extent, if any, of the threat to national se-
curity posed by domestic terrorist groups and 
organizations motivated by a belief system of 
white supremacy, such as the Boogaloo and 
Proud Boys extremists. 
The threat posed by accelerationists and mi-
litia extremists—a range of violent anti-govern-
ment actors, movements, and organizations, 
some of which branch out of decades-old 
ideologies and others which are relatively new 
has led to violent engagement of law enforce-
ment. 
My concern is that aftermath of a historic 
national election, the activity of violence 
influencers like Boogaloo Boys or Proud Boys 
will increase and lead to attacks becoming 
more frequent. 
In 2018, we saw too many instances of vio-
lent extremists searching for opportunities to 
sow violence and disrupt democratic proc-
esses. 
Boogaloo and Proud Boys are targeting 
constitutionally protected activity for cooption 
or to provide cover for attacks. 
Under the guidance that produced this re-
port, there should not be any activity directed 
at groups that are not known for violent activ-
ity or have a history of engaging in violence 
directed at the United States government. 
Jackson Lee Amendment 182, directs the 
Secretary of Defense to report on the number 
of military bases, installations, and facilities 
that are named after African Americans; and 
directs each Secretary responsible for a 
branch of the military to establish a review 
process to consider the naming of military in-
stallations and covered defense property 
under the jurisdiction of that Secretary after 
African Americans who served in the Armed 
Forces with honor, heroism, and distinction 
and are deserving of recognition. 
I thank my colleagues Representatives 
BENNIE THOMPSON, WILLIAM LACY CLAY, GREG-
ORY
MEEKS, A. DONALD
MCEACHIN, MARC 
VEASEY, STANFORD BISHOP, ANDRE´ CARSON, 
and JAHANA HAYES for joining as cosponsors 
of this Amendment. 
In every war waged from the Battle of Lex-
ington to the Battle for Fallujah, African Ameri-
cans have honorably answered the call to 
duty, and served with valor and distinction in 
America’s armed forces. 
The fact that military bases have been 
named after Confederate military leaders or 
soldiers is hard to imagine given that they 
were fighting to end the United States. 
The Confederacy was not something that 
should be held up for honor by the United 
States or our nation’s military. 
There is no shortage of honorable replace-
ment candidates to receive the honor of hav-
ing a military base, installation or facility 
named in their honor: 
UNITED STATES ARMY 
1. Gen. Roscoe Robinson, Jr. 
General Robinson was a 1951 graduate of 
West Point who attended the service academy 
before the Army was desegregated. Robinson 
served in Korea and Vietnam, with valor deco-
rations in both conflicts, and as a training offi-
cer as part of the U.S. military support mission 
in Liberia. He went on to become the first 
black commander of the 82nd Airborne Divi-
sion, deputy chief of staff for operations in 
U.S. Army Europe, commander of U.S. Forces 
Japan, the U.S. representative on the NATO 
Military Committee, and the first black four-star 
general in the Army. 
2. William Harvey Carney 
William Carney was the first African Amer-
ican recipient of the Congressional Medal of 
Honor, which he received for his actions on 
July 18, 1863 at Fort Wagner, SC while a 
member of the 54th Massachusetts Regiment 
in the Civil War—the state’s first all-black regi-
ment. 
The 54th Massachusetts was the subject of 
the film, ‘‘Glory,’’ starring Denzel Washington 
and Morgan Freeman. 
3. Lieutenant Colonel Charity Edna Adams 
Lieutenant Colonel Charity Edna Adams 
was appointed to lead the African American 
Women’s Army Corps unit designated as the 
6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion, 
which became known as the ‘‘Six Triple 
Eight.’’ 
This unit was instrumental in establishing 
and maintaining morale because it assured 
that mail from the battlefront and the home- 
front flowed efficiently and timely. 
4. Lt. Col. Margaret E. Bailey 
In 1964, Margaret E. Bailey, Army Nurse 
Corps, was the first nurse to be promoted to 
lieutenant colonel. 
UNITED STATES NAVY 
1. Dorie Miller Messman First Class and Ad-
miral Michelle Howard. 
Dorie Miller, Messman First Class was serv-
ing in a noncombat role in the Navy, Dorie Mil-
ler responded heroically when the battleship 
West Virginia was attacked at Pearl Harbor. 
He was the first African American to be 
awarded the Navy Cross, the third highest 
honor awarded by the U.S. Navy at the time. 
2. Admiral Michelle Howard 
Admiral Michelle Howard is a four-star Ad-
miral and one of the highest-ranking African 
American women ever to serve in any branch 
of the military. Admiral Howard is also the first 
African American woman to command a U.S. 
Navy ship, the USS Rushmore. 
She is the Navy’s second highest ranking 
officer and is currently serving as the com-
mander of U.S. Naval Forces Africa, com-
mander of U.S. Naval Forces Europe and 
commander of Allied Joint Force Command 
Naples. 
THE AIR FORCE 
1. Lt. Col. Shawna Rochelle-Kimbrell 
In 2012, Lieutenant Colonel Kimbrell be-
came the first female African American fighter 
pilot in the Air Force history. Her flights in 
Northern Watch marked her as the first female 
pilot to fly combat missions for Misawa’s 35th 
Fighter Wing, and the first African American 
woman to employ ordinance in combat. She 
has more than 1,110 hours in the F–16, in-
cluding 176 hours of combat time. 
2. Colonel Ruth A. Lucas 
Colonel Lucas was the first African Amer-
ican woman in the Air Force to be promoted 
to the rank of colonel. At the time of her retire-
ment in 1970, she was the highest-ranking Af-
rican American woman in the Air Force. 
3. Gen. Benjamin O. Davis, Jr. 
In 1959 General Benjamin O. Davis became 
the first African American Major General in the 
United States Air Force. In 1943, he organized 
and commanded the 332nd Fighter Group 
known as the Tuskegee Airmen. General 
Davis received many decorations during his 
career, including two Distinguished Service 
Medals and a Silver Star. On December 9, 
1998, General Davis was awarded his fourth 
general’s star by President Bill Clinton. 
THE COAST GUARD 
1. Alex Haley 
Chief Petty Officer Haley is best known for 
writing letters for his shipmates and his short 
stories and articles, which got him promoted to 
Chief Journalist of the Coast Guard in 1959. 
Haley ultimately received a number of military 
honors, including the American Defense Serv-
ice Medal, World War II Victory Medal and an 
honorary degree from the Coast Guard Acad-
emy. And most of you know him also as the 
author of ‘‘Roots.’’ 
2. Bobby C. Wilks 
In 1957, Captain Bobby Wilks became the 
first African American Coast Guard aviator. He 
later became the first African American to 
reach the rank of Captain and the first to com-
mand a Coast Guard air station. He accumu-
lated over 6,000 flight hours in 18 different 
types of aircrafts. 
Twenty-five percent of the today’s military is 
comprised of persons of color, of which 17.8 
percent are African American. 
In 2017, blacks made up 17 percent of the 
DOD active-duty military—somewhat higher 
than their share of the U.S. population ages 
18 to 44 (13 percent). Blacks have consist-
ently been represented in greater shares

As a Member of Congress, a mother, a sis-
ter and a spouse, and a breast cancer sur-
vivor, I feel a special responsibility to do all I 
can to ensure every American can win in the 
fight against all types of breast cancer, espe-
cially triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). 
About 10 to 20 percent of breast cancers 
test negative for both hormone receptors and 
HER2 in the lab, which means they are triple- 
negative. 
Studies have shown that triple-negative 
breast cancer is more likely to spread beyond 
the breast and more likely to recur (come 
back) after treatment. 
These risks appear to be greatest in the first 
few years after treatment. 
Jackson Lee Amendment 181 provides au-
thorization for $2.5 million increase in funding 
to combat post-traumatic stress disorder 
(PTSD). 
According to the NIH, an estimated 3.6 per-
cent of U.S. adults had PTSD in the past year. 
PTSD was first brought to public attention in 
relation to war veterans, but it can result from 
a variety of traumatic incidents, such as tor-
ture, being kidnapped or held captive, bomb-
ings, or natural disasters such as floods or 
earthquakes. 
This amendment will help ensure that ‘‘no 
soldier is left behind’’ by addressing the urgent 
need for more outreach toward hard to reach 
veterans suffering from PTSD, especially 
those who are homeless or reside in under-
served urban and rural areas of our country. 
I urge my colleagues to support all of these 
Jackson Lee Amendments.

CONGRATULATING COLE COUNTY 
MISSOURI ON THE COMMEMORA-
TION OF ITS BICENTENNIAL 
HON. BLAINE LUETKEMEYER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, November 18, 2020 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to congratulate Cole County, Mis-
souri, on the commemoration of its Bicenten-
nial. 
Located in the heart of Missouri, Cole Coun-
ty was founded in 1820 and named after the 
fearless pioneer Captain Stephan Cole. Start-
ing with a small community of nearly 1,028 
people, Cole County now has a population of 
around 80,000. This growth is combined with 
a rich history that outlines the story of the 
heartland of Missouri. 
Shortly after President Monroe signed the 
Missouri Compromise on March 6, 1820 in-
ducting Missouri into the Union the first Mis-
souri Constitution was written. Alexander 
McNair was elected Governor, Thomas Hart 
Benton and David Barton were elected as 
U.S. Senators and the first Missouri General 
Assembly comprised of 14 state senators and 
43 state representatives was formed. On No-
vember 16, 1820 Cole County was established 
and five years later Jefferson City was found-
ed. In 1826 Jefferson City officially became 
the capital of Missouri and has been home to 
the state legislature and governor ever since. 
Moving forward in history, throughout the 
1840s and into the 1890s Cole County saw 
massive population growth lead by an influx of 
German immigration to America. Many came 
seeking religious freedom, independence and 
fertile land. From their many tightly bound 
communities began to grow and develop, 
many 
centering 
around 
their 
respective 
churches. 
This year, Cole County will celebrate by 
placing a special commemorative monument 
at the trailhead of Katy trail as well as several 
other smaller events to commemorate this his-
toric event. In these unprecedented times, it is 
important now more than ever to come to-
gether and celebrate our shared history and 
roots in this great nation. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in con-
gratulating Cole County on their 200th Anni-
versary. May their rich history continue to be 
the foundation for an undoubtedly bright fu-
ture.

CONGRATULATING BOONE MEAD-
OW ELEMENTARY A BLUE RIB-
BON SCHOOL 
HON. SUSAN W. BROOKS 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, November 18, 2020 
Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to congratulate an outstanding 
school in my district that is being honored as 
a National Blue Ribbon School. It is a pleas-
ure to congratulate Boone Meadow Elemen-
tary in Zionsville, Indiana, in celebration of this 
special occasion. 
The National Blue Ribbon designation, given 
by the United States Department of Education, 
is awarded to both public and private schools 
across our great nation. Started by President 
Reagan and given annually since 1982, the 
award celebrates great American schools that 
achieve very high learning standards or are 
making significant improvements in the aca-
demic achievements of their students. In my 
district and across the country, the award rec-
ognizes the great educators, students, and 
parents who have worked very hard to ensure 
our children reach their full potential and 
achieve academic success. 
For all these reasons and many more, I am 
very proud that Boone Meadow Elementary is 
receiving this prestigious designation. It is a 
wonderful acknowledgement of the school’s 
commitment to providing young Hoosiers with 
an exceptional education. While hundreds of 
schools nationwide were nominated, only 367 
schools were designated as 2020 National 
Blue Ribbon Schools. Of the 367 schools, 
Boone Meadow was one of only eight Indiana 
schools to receive recognition, making this 
recognition all the more impressive. 
Boone Meadow is a school that is not only 
committed to its students, but is committed to 
the teachers, staff and parents of their com-
munity. They are committed to creating an en-
vironment that allows students to grow into the 
leaders of tomorrow. I want to personally con-
gratulate principal Tom Hundley for leading 
this school to this well-deserved honor. 
As an advocate for education and youth, I 
recognize how important it is for our nation’s 
future to encourage and raise a new genera-
tion of Americans who have the skills and 
knowledge to succeed both in and out of the 
classroom. Students like those at Boone 
Meadow give me hope that we will accomplish 
this vital mission. Their outstanding work is an 
inspiration to students, educators, and parents 
across the nation. Once again, congratulations 
to Boone Meadow Elementary School. I am 
very proud of them.
