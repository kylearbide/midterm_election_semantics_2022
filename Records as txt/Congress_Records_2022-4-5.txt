Vol. 168 
WASHINGTON, TUESDAY, APRIL 5, 2022 
No. 60 
House of Representatives 
The House met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the Speaker pro tem-
pore (Mr. PAYNE).

DESIGNATION OF SPEAKER PRO 
TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker: 
WASHINGTON, DC, 
April 5, 2022. 
I hereby appoint the Honorable DONALD M. 
PAYNE, Jr. to act as Speaker pro tempore on 
this day. 
NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House of Representatives. 
f 
MORNING-HOUR DEBATE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the order of the House of Janu-
ary 10, 2022, the Chair will now recog-
nize Members from lists submitted by 
the majority and minority leaders for 
morning-hour debate. 
The Chair will alternate recognition 
between the parties, with time equally 
allocated between the parties and each 
Member other than the majority and 
minority leaders and the minority 
whip limited to 5 minutes, but in no 
event shall debate continue beyond 
11:50 a.m.

RUSSIA DESERVES MORE SEVERE 
SANCTIONS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. JOYCE) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to condemn Vladimir 
Putin and the Russian Army. These 
brutal and violent thugs have at-
tempted to rehang the Iron Curtain for 
the sole purpose of committing abject 
violence against the free and sovereign 
people of Ukraine. The killing of 
women and children outside of Kyiv is 
a vile act. These acts amount to war 
crimes. 
It is time to deliver the lethal aid 
that the Ukrainian people need to 
deter the violent acts that the Russian 
people commit upon Ukrainians. 
It is time to cut off Russian exports 
to the free world. No country that val-
ues the sanctity of life should want to 
buy their goods from Russia. No place, 
where free people live, should use the 
energy that Russian refineries produce 
be accepted. 
The Biden administration must hold 
the line and impose severe sanctions 
against Russia for their multiple mur-
derous acts, and the people of Ukraine 
must know that Americans stand with 
them in their fight for freedom.

MY LIFE HAS BEEN BLESSED 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Michigan (Mr. UPTON) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, it seems 
like just yesterday when a number of 
community leaders encouraged me to 
run for Congress. Against all odds, we 
ended up winning a very hotly con-
tested Republican primary, and the 
journey began. 
Throughout my career, I have leaned 
on lessons from my Reagan White 
House days where my boss and mentor 
was Ken Duberstein, who later was his 
chief of staff. 
Reagan worked both sides of the aisle 
to get things done, caring less about 
who got the credit, and I made a prom-
ise that such a principle would be my 
guiding light. Especially in these days 
of divided government, that is the only 
way one can actually get legislation 
enacted. 
There has been something special in 
my household with highlights and 
lowlights that we often discuss at the 
dinner table. As I reflect back, there 
have certainly been more highlights 
representing the wonderful and diverse 
corner of southwest Michigan. These 
folks are truly the salt of the earth, 
and I love them all. I really do, even 
the few that don’t always love me. 
As chair of the Energy and Com-
merce Committee, a huge highlight 
was 21st Century Cures. Hailed as the 
most important piece of legislation 
passed in that Congress, it laid the 
foundation for Operation Warp Speed 
and faster drug approvals, including 
the first vaccine that Pfizer produced 
in Kalamazoo. 
Now, once again, with my partner 
DIANA DEGETTE, we are pursuing Cures 
2.0 with all the disease and patient 
groups who joined us on Cures. 
My driving mission has been jobs and 
the economy. Whether it was working 
on a North American energy inde-
pendent plan, pursuing renewable re-
sources, and, yes, dealing with climate 
change. Changing the tax laws so that 
no longer do we have the highest cor-
porate tax rates in the world, which 
drove so many of our job creators 
someplace other than America. Being 
the Republican lead with John Dingell 
on the auto rescue plan. The industry 
and all the jobs that came with it was 
simply too big to fail. 
Pipeline safety, protecting the Great 
Lakes, and our drinking water has also 
been my focus. Every family in Amer-
ica deserves clean water. 
I have been more than willing to 
stand up for the less fortunate and vul-
nerable, including my vote last week to 
cap the price of insulin. 
I have had the opportunity to visit 
our brave troops in harm’s way over-
seas in Iraq and Afghanistan, and wit-
nessed the tragedy of war like we see 
today 
with 
Putin’s 
invasion 
in 
Ukraine. It was critical to pass the re-
cent humanitarian and military aid. 
Yes, it was. 
And, of course, I witnessed 9/11 here 
and pushed hard on the recommenda-
tion by the 9/11 Commission to protect 
against such an attack again.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4156 
April 5, 2022 
As a former Boy Scout, I believe in 
leaving the campground better than 
when you found it. I have worked with 
seven administrations, seven House 
Speakers. None of them would call me 
a rubber stamp. If it is good policy for 
Michigan, it is good enough for all of 
us. 
As a vice chair of the bipartisan 
Problem 
Solvers 
Caucus, 
we 
have 
pushed the envelope to get things done, 
taking on some complex and often con-
troversial issues that others may want 
to just sweep under the rug. Immigra-
tion reform, including border security, 
for our Dreamers and farmers, a real 
honest-to-goodness infrastructure bill 
that passed 69–30 in the Senate but 
then hit the rocks here in the House, 
barely surviving Trump’s opposition, 
despite his call for a proposal twice as 
expensive with no pay-fors. 
I have worked alongside real giants 
who put principle over politics: Greg 
Walden, Paul Henry, MIKE ROGERS, Pat 
Tiberi, Susan Brooks, Charlie Dent, 
John Lewis, Mike Castle, Henry Hyde, 
Amo Houghton, Dave Camp, Nancy 
Johnson, and Don Young were among 
the best. 
I work daily on all things Michigan, 
particularly with DEBBIE DINGELL, and 
we have been hitting the road to push 
for civility. Hopefully, civility and bi-
partisanship versus discord can rule, 
not rue, the day. 
Current colleagues like CMR, CATHY 
MCMORRIS
RODGERS, STEVE
WOMACK, 
MARIO DIAZ-BALART, JOSH GOTTHEIMER, 
BRIAN FITZPATRICK, TOM COLE, DAVE 
MCKINLEY, DAN KILDEE, JOHN KATKO, 
KURT SCHRADER, DEAN PHILLIPS, PETER 
MEIJER, and my friend Steny cut the 
mustard, too. 
I have been blessed having wonderful, 
hardworking staff all these years. Yes, 
two of them—including my chief of 
staff, Joan Hillebrands—have been on 
my team 36 years, with another hand-
ful between 15 and 20 years. Our dis-
trict team has worked on so many dif-
ferent casework issues, in the tens of 
thousands. 
Throughout 
the 
COVID 
nightmare, we worked with our local 
bankers to save dozens of small busi-
nesses with PPP, and we worked to get 
vital supplies to our wonderful health 
facilities and frontline workers, who 
are still so stressed today. 
Even the best of stories has a last 
chapter. This is it for me. I have done 
the zillions of airline miles back and 
forth. I have signed ‘‘Fred’’ to over a 
million letters; cast more votes than 
anyone in this Chamber while here; and 
by most accounts, have succeeded in 
making a difference, accomplishing 
what I have set out to do, with more 
unfinished work still yet to come. 
Arthur Brooks recently wrote about 
three traits most important in life— 
honesty, compassion, and faith. I would 
like to think those same yardsticks 
were passed along to me by my par-
ents, watching on C–SPAN now. 
Someone asked my wife, Amey, what 
would be the next chapter? She said, 
‘‘and they lived happily ever after.’’ In-
deed, we will. I thank Amey, our two 
kids, and three grandkids for giving me 
so much to look forward to. 
Thanks again to the people of my dis-
trict who placed their faith and con-
fidence in me all these years. 
God bless the USA. 
f 
FRED UPTON HAS BEEN A 
DEVOTED PUBLIC SERVANT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Mrs. DINGELL) for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, for 35 
years, FRED UPTON has been a devoted 
public servant for southwest Michigan, 
all of Michigan, and our Nation. 
Throughout his career, he has always 
put the people he served first. To him, 
bipartisan and compromise are not for-
bidden words. Fred knew well that if 
we are going to deliver real solutions 
for the American people, we need to 
come together and listen to all per-
spectives, no matter how complicated 
the issue might be. It is because of that 
thinking, he was able to get so much 
done in Congress. 
I am especially proud of all that we 
have been able to accomplish together. 
Thanks to his partnership, we were 
able to pass legislation to protect the 
Great Lakes for future generations and 
lower the cost of healthcare for all 
Americans. Together, we have cham-
pioned removing the harmful PFAS 
chemicals from our Nation’s drinking 
water, and I am confident we are going 
to get this to the President’s desk. 
While we may not have found har-
mony on every issue, Fred and I always 
managed to disagree without vitriolic 
rhetoric and mean-spirited language. 
Even through our toughest discussions, 
Fred always found a way to make me 
laugh, except today. It is his civility 
that I—and Congress—will miss the 
most. 
Fred really believed that he was an 
American first, that reaching across 
the aisle was important, that working 
together is how we get things done for 
the American people. His retiring is a 
loss for this country, and especially the 
people of Michigan. 
Fred is a dear friend to me, was 
John’s best friend, and was there when 
John died. The Dingell family loves 
him. 
He 
is 
one 
of 
the 
greatest 
Michiganders to serve our country. I 
wish him, Amey, and their family the 
best as they prepare for the next ad-
venture. And there will be one. Thank 
you, Fred. 
f 
CONGRATULATING VMI’S CLUB 
BOXING TEAM 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. CLINE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, I, too, want 
to express my thanks to the gentleman 
from Michigan for his years of service 
to this country, to this body, and to 
the great State of Michigan. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor 
the Virginia Military Institute Club 
Boxing Team, which recently won the 
United States Intercollegiate Boxing 
Association National Championships in 
Atlanta, Georgia. This victory marks 
the program’s second national title in 
seven years, the last of which came in 
2015. 
Throughout this year’s tournament, 
the team amassed an impressive 20–8 
record, scoring six knockouts, one 
technical knockout, nine unanimous 
decisions, and four split decisions. Of 
the 14 cadets competing, 5 won indi-
vidual national championship belts, 
while another 7 took home silver med-
als. Each of these national champions 
and runners-up also earned All-Amer-
ican individual honors for their stellar 
performances 
in 
their 
respective 
weight classes. 
The team’s coach, Joe Shafer, cred-
ited their win to preparation, dedica-
tion, and hard work. Coach Shafer said, 
‘‘We represented the Institute with a 
fighting spirit: honoring VMI’s history, 
upholding the passions of our fore-
fathers, and personifying the principles 
of excellence for VMI.’’ 
The cadets certainly showcased the 
very best of the Virginia Military In-
stitute, and the team should be incred-
ibly proud of their efforts. Congratula-
tions again to these national cham-
pions. They made the Commonwealth 
proud. 
AMERICA’S ECONOMIC CRISIS 
Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, our Nation 
is in the midst of an economic crisis, 
yet the Biden administration fails to 
take action to ease the burden on 
American families. 
When inflation began to soar and hit 
a 40-year high recently, the President’s 
own chief of staff shrugged it off as a 
‘‘high-class problem,’’ insinuating that 
it was only affecting the wealthy, 
which we know not to be true. 
Instead of offering solutions, this ad-
ministration offers excuses. Perhaps 
worst of all is the fact that when given 
the chance to combat soaring prices by 
reining in wasteful spending, President 
Biden went entirely in the opposite di-
rection by proposing a $5.8 trillion 
budget that is more of the same liberal, 
tax-and-spend policies that have led us 
to this economic crisis in the first 
place. 
If Biden’s budget were adopted, the 
national debt would reach a new record 
by the end of the decade, growing by 
over $15 trillion, reaching $45 trillion 
by 2032 or about $350,000 per household. 
Further, not only does his budget 
proposal include nearly $2.5 trillion in 
new or increased taxes, it also in-
creases the corporate tax rate to 28 
percent, higher than even Communist 
China. As an American, I am offended 
by that. Every American should be of-
fended by that. 
The Tax Foundation estimated that 
this increase would kill 159,000 jobs, 
shrink the economy by $720 billion, and 
cut wages for low-income workers. 
President Biden’s budget will leave 
the overwhelming majority of Ameri-
cans behind, explode the national debt,

ALLEVIATING HEALTH 
DISPARITIES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Mrs. CHERFILUS-MCCORMICK) 
for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. CHERFILUS-McCORMICK. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to applaud the Demo-
crats working with the Biden adminis-
tration to achieve the best job creation 
record in United States history. 
Together, we have created 7.9 million 
jobs and seen the largest decrease in 
unemployment in history. In March, 
the national unemployment rate fell to 
3.6 faster than expected and reached 
the lowest level since February 2020. 
The United States has now regained 
93 percent of the jobs lost during the 
pandemic. There have been particu-
larly strong gains in the industries in-
tegral to addressing supply chain chal-
lenges, including manufacturing, con-
struction, 
transportation, 
and 
warehousing. 
Despite strong economic growth and 
wage gains, global price increases 
make it harder for U.S. workers and 
families to recover everyday expenses. 
The higher prices deprive households of 
the full benefits of the strongest wage 
growth seen in years. 
Investing in children and families, 
workers, and small businesses, as the 
building a better America agenda does, 
would address the root causes of infla-
tion and reduce some of the biggest ex-
penses in our households. 
While we are making great strides in 
ensuring a thriving economy, we must 
also remain committed to ensuring ac-
cess to healthcare for all Americans. 
There is no wealth without good 
health. 
While the Affordable Care Act has 
been 
critical 
in 
addressing 
the 
healthcare gap, we know Black and 
Brown and low-income families across 
this Nation are still disproportionately 
impacted by health disparities. 
Allow me to share some daunting 
data to paint the seriousness of my 
concerns. 
In 2018, approximately 21.5 percent of 
Hispanic adults over age 20 were diag-
nosed with diabetes, compared to 13 
percent of White adults over the age of 
20. 
Hispanic women are 40 percent more 
likely to have cervical cancer and 20 
percent more likely to die from cer-
vical cancer than non-Hispanic White 
women. 
There are 11 infant deaths per 1,000 
live births among Black women. This is 
almost twice the national average. 
Alleviating health disparities will re-
quire a deliberate and sustained effort 
to address socioeconomic determinants 
of health, such as poverty, segregation, 
and environmental degradation. 
Furthermore, 
regarding 
mortality 
health, I plan to vote in favor of H.R. 
1218, the Data Mapping to Save Moms’ 
Lives Act. This legislation will use 
data mapping to show where high rates 
of poor maternal health outcomes over-
lap 
with 
the 
lack 
of 
access 
to 
broadband services to help identify 
where improved access to telehealth 
services can be most effective. 
According to the CDC, severe com-
plications related to pregnancy, known 
as severe maternal morbidity, impact 
over 50,000 women in the United States 
each 
year. 
Unfortunately, 
Black 
women are three times more likely to 
die from pregnancy-related causes than 
White women. 
In my own State, Florida ranks 32nd 
out of the 50 States in the U.S. in 
terms of the highest maternal mor-
tality rates. 
As we continue to create a more ro-
bust economy, we must also address 
health disparities in our Nation, which, 
in many cases, have led to countless 
premature deaths. 
f 
CALIFORNIA WATER SHORTAGES 
HURT NATIONAL FOOD SUPPLIES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. LAMALFA) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, just a 
short time ago, the gentleman from 
Michigan (Mr. UPTON) gave a heartfelt 
speech about his time in Congress. I 
want to pass along my appreciation for 
him, especially his hard work in shep-
herding through the 21st Century Cures 
Act just a couple of terms ago. 
I appreciate that and his strong work 
in the Congress. God bless Mr. FRED 
UPTON. 
Mr. Speaker, I get up here and speak 
a lot about the situation with food 
availability in this country, farming, 
the availability of food that comes 
from farming. 
Just recently, President Biden basi-
cally promised food shortages around 
the world and even have effects here in 
the United States, the land of abun-
dance with the capability of growing 
much more than our own food supply. 
There is no reason the United States 
should be running short of food in any 
fashion for our own people or in our 
ability to help other people around the 
world with exports or the food pro-
grams that aid those that are in poor, 
dire situations in some other countries. 
Yet, indeed, my wife just told me a 
couple of days ago that she was in the 
market, and there was an entire freezer 
shelf that was empty in one of the 
large chains of grocery stores in north-
ern California. How can this be? Why is 
it? 
I know we are coming out of COVID. 
That caused some problems, but the es-
sential workers were in there pretty 
much the whole time making it hap-
pen, making beef available to our store 
shelves, everything else. 
The farmers probably never really 
left the fields. There is no reason we 
should be having shortages. 
I still hearken back to the story 
about 30-something years ago when 
Boris Yeltsin, the President of Russia, 
came to this country. Along with 
President Bush at the time, he visited 
the Johnson Space Center in Houston. 
On the way out, they stopped at a gro-
cery store there in Texas. Mr. Yeltsin 
just wanted to see that, I guess, and he 
was amazed by what was on the shelves 
of American stores, the bounty we 
have. 
I think it moved him to become emo-
tional about it, and it also moved him 
to give up his role in the Communist 
Party in Russia and try to start re-
forming his country. 
Indeed, he was quoted as saying, If 
the Russian people could see what was 
on the shelves here, there would be a 
revolution. That is pretty amazing. 
So, what are we doing here in this 
country? The regulatory agencies and 
policies that come out of this adminis-
tration and, of course, the State of 
California are basically running agri-
culture off the map. Taking the water 
away from farmers in California is a 
big example. 
Now, people around the country may 
be watching and wonder: ‘‘Why does 
that affect me, man, a bunch of Cali-
fornia problems? They are all messed 
up out there anyway.’’ What is impor-
tant, though, is that so many of these 
products we grow in California benefit 
the whole country. There are at least a 
dozen crops that 90 to 98 percent of 
them that Americans consume are 
grown in my home State. 
I went to this irrigation district 
meeting just recently in my district. A 
whole bunch of farmers were gathered 
with the district managers there, their 
board. Indeed, the district is doing ev-
erything it can to make a bad situation 
work just a little bit better. They are 
using innovative ideas. 
But the bottom line is, the water has 
been taken from them when you are 
talking Lake Shasta, Lake Oroville, 
the other projects we have in Cali-
fornia, the State project, the Federal 
project. 
How has it been taken? Well, of 
course, we are going through somewhat 
of a drought situation, but a lot of it is 
a man-enhanced drought because so 
much water has been let out of our 
storage systems into the delta, osten-
sibly to help fish, ostensibly to help 
with water quality. 
One of the delta fish we are talking 
about is known as the delta smelt. It is 
gone. They go out and take what they 
call trawls, looking for this species. It 
isn’t there anymore, so they have shift-
ed much of the narrative away from 
the smelt now to water quality, salin-
ity, such as that. 
We get that because some of the bay 
area intakes for city use are in the 
delta, and they need to not have salt-
water coming into those. So, the fresh-
water coming down, basically, from the 
mountains washes that water away. 
They need some of that flow.

H4158 
April 5, 2022 
According to statistics I have seen, 
because I can hardly get a straight an-
swer, six times the flow has been 
pushed through there as what it would 
take to maintain that salinity—six 
times the flow. 
So much water is not being captured. 
California still has a lot of rain and 
snowpack that falls upon it that is not 
being captured. 
What are we down to? That water dis-
trict I met with, those farmers are 
going to receive 7 percent of their 
flows, 0.4 acre-feet. If you had 100 acres, 
you would get to plant 7 acres. Can you 
imagine in any kind of business atmos-
phere where you get to operate 7 per-
cent of it? 
We have to get this right. The Fed-
eral Government needs to come in and 
do its job, not just worship the Endan-
gered Species Act. 
f 
BE CONCERNED ABOUT AMERICA, 
NOT OTHER COUNTRIES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Georgia (Mrs. GREENE) for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, right now, the American people are 
over $30 trillion in debt because Con-
gress is incapable of being responsible 
with 
the 
American 
people’s 
hard- 
earned tax dollars. 
Over $30 trillion in debt and counting 
is a sum total that we will never be 
able to pay back in our lifetimes, our 
children’s 
lifetimes, 
our 
grand-
children’s lifetimes, our great-grand-
children’s lifetimes, and so forth. 
Our dollar is on the verge of crash-
ing. We are also on the verge of being 
the competitive currency with another 
foreign country’s currency, possibly 
China. We are not in good shape finan-
cially. 
We also are looking at 7.9 percent in-
flation and rising, with nothing to stop 
it. We are looking at gas prices that 
are getting so expensive that people 
can hardly afford to fill up their gas 
tanks. 
Crime is out of control, and there is 
no reason for that. But coming up, on 
May 23, the Biden administration is 
going to suspend title 42, which is 
going to allow approximately an esti-
mated 18,000 illegal aliens to come 
across our border. 
If you total this up, in over 5 months, 
we are looking at potentially over 2.7 
million people coming in throughout 
the summer and into the fall. This is 
unsustainable. This is also against our 
Constitution and is completely irre-
sponsible. 
Now, we have something coming up 
that Congress is going to be voting on, 
a 41-page COVID–19 supplemental bill 
because, for some reason, we are sup-
posed to be spending more money that 
we don’t have on future COVID and fu-
ture COVID variants and future COVID 
vaccines because, really, that makes a 
lot of sense. 
Why is that an emergency? It is in 
the future. 
This bill, at $10 billion, of which up 
to $9 billion is for the Biomedical Ad-
vanced Research and Development Au-
thority—what is the purpose of that? It 
is in the future. Is this gain of function 
research? We have a lot of questions, 
but we don’t have answers. 
This is also—for future COVID, by 
the way—supposed to provide $750 mil-
lion in efforts to fight future variants 
to build future vaccine manufacturing 
capacity. 
Haven’t our vaccine manufacturers 
made enough money when COVID vac-
cines were mandated across the coun-
try? They are still making a lot of 
money. 
We have already spent $4.6 trillion in 
resources on COVID, $4.16 trillion in 
obligations, $3.63 trillion in outlays 
across 44 government agencies. 
The U.S. has made $825 billion in di-
rect payments. The U.S. has issued $845 
billion in loans. The U.S. has given $540 
billion in grants, $50 billion in con-
tracts, mostly through HHS and De-
fense, and so forth and on and more 
spending and more spending. Again, we 
are over $30 trillion in debt. 
Currently, the death rate for COVID 
is 1.22 percent. By the way, this death 
rate has continued to go down, thank-
fully. We are all thankful for that. Yet, 
Congress wants to spend more money 
for future COVID, for future vaccines, 
and for future variants when there is 
no need to do so. 
What we should be doing is we should 
be helping Americans get back to 
work. We should be helping small busi-
nesses. 
Most of all, we should be securing our 
southern border to protect our country 
and our national security interests, 
and to protect our people, instead of 
being 
completely 
concerned 
and 
wrapped up in another country’s border 
and their people. 
While we are failing Americans here 
at home, we are too concerned about 
countries abroad. 
b 1030 
Now, we have other serious problems. 
We have things that more Americans 
have been ignored on. There have been 
approximately 11,943 deaths reported 
on VAERS, but no investigation. There 
have also been 1,676 miscarriages re-
ported on VAERS; 5,592 heart attacks 
reported on VAERS; 5,164 cases of myo-
carditis reported on VAERS; 13,230 per-
manently disabled cases reported on 
VAERS, yet no investigation. But we 
are supposed to spend $10 billion on fu-
ture COVID, future variants, future 
vaccines? 
If we are going to spend some money, 
why don’t we spend some money look-
ing 
into 
these 
cases 
reported 
on 
VAERS? 
This is why I introduced the Justice 
for Vaccine Victims Act of 2022 because 
there needs to be an investigation. 
FARM BILL IMPACT SERIES: THE 
STATE OF AGRICULTURE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Kansas (Mr. MANN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. MANN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to deliver the next installment of my 
farm bill impact series—the state of 
agriculture. 
We are at the end of the first quarter. 
National 
Agriculture 
Month 
just 
ended, and as Congress prepares to au-
thorize the farm bill, we should exam-
ine the state of agriculture. 
Agriculture is not just a business; it 
is a rich heritage and a lifestyle. Sadly, 
the distance from farm to fork has 
never been greater, and there are fewer 
legislators who have experience on the 
farm. Since Congress will reauthorize 
the farm bill in 2023, I am standing 
here today to remind Congress that for 
this legislation to be effective in ensur-
ing the food security, and, therefore, 
the national security, of our Nation, 
we need to get in the field and consider 
the perspectives of farmers, ranchers, 
and agriculture producers. 
Last month, House Agriculture Com-
mittee Republican leader G.T. THOMP-
SON and I did just that on a tour of my 
district. We went to farms; we toured 
facilities; we ate at dinner tables; and 
we listened. We did it because hearing 
from producers is crucial to legislating 
well on matters that concern their 
livelihoods. Today, I will report to Con-
gress on what they have been telling 
me about the economic, human, and 
natural resources surrounding their 
work, and what Kansas producers be-
lieve to be the state of agriculture. 
A 
farmer 
or 
rancher’s 
economic 
health depends on things like cash and 
assets on hand, protections against the 
government taxing the farm at transfer 
or death, and well-crafted farm bill 
programs like crop insurance. 
You don’t have to look far to know 
that producers are facing the highest 
input prices in 40 years. Fertilizer is 
four to five times higher than it was at 
this time last year, if you can even get 
it. Equipment is back-ordered for 6 to 8 
months. Parts are at least double the 
cost. On our trip, Republican leader 
THOMPSON and I hosted a roundtable 
with Kansas commodity groups, and all 
of them told me that if we cannot get 
input prices and inflation under con-
trol, today’s farm and tomorrow’s crop 
will be in a much worse condition at 
this time next year. 
The day-to-day trials of operating a 
successful farm, ranch, or agribusiness 
are challenging enough without wor-
rying about these skyrocketing prices. 
Now, President Biden’s budget proposal 
threatens the stepped-up basis and im-
poses capital gains taxes on farms or 
ranches that have been held in the fam-
ily for 90 years or more. This new farm- 
killer tax would inflict hundreds of 
thousands of dollars in new capital 
gains taxes on hardworking Americans 
and 
jeopardize 
family-owned 
busi-
nesses. 
The one saving grace for most farm-
ers is that the 2018 farm bill protected

April 5, 2022 
and strengthened their opportunity to 
utilize crop insurance programs, even 
when conditions are dire. Largely, 
farmers want to keep crop insurance in 
place in the 2023 farm bill. One Kansas 
farmer even told us that Congress 
needs to ‘‘use a scalpel, not a sledge-
hammer, as we refine crop insurance.’’ 
Agriculture’s human resources in-
clude labor on the farm and employees 
at the local Farm Service Agency of-
fice. On the farm, folks are hurting for 
workers. We visited one of the first 
feed yards in the State, and the family 
owners haven’t seen a labor shortage 
with looming retirements this bad 
since before the feed yard’s inception 
in 1951. Another co-op owner told us 
their workforce is down 10 percent with 
more than 70 open positions. 
At the local USDA offices, where 
Kansans go if they need help from the 
government, staff is also short. Tradi-
tionally, there has been a fully staffed 
USDA office in every county in Amer-
ica, but President Biden’s policies have 
kept employees at home and turned 
those offices mostly all virtual. I met 
with farmers who are at a complete 
loss trying to navigate convoluted gov-
ernment websites instead of talking 
face-to-face with USDA employees. 
There is a workforce shortage in 
every industry, and agriculture is no 
exception. From the farm to govern-
ment services for the farm, agriculture 
has been experiencing record employee 
turnover due to unnecessary vaccine 
mandates, 
enhanced 
unemployment 
benefits, and more. 
And in terms of natural resources, we 
all know America’s farmers and ranch-
ers are the original conservationists. 
America has vast amounts of natural 
resources available to its stewards. The 
biggest threat to agriculture’s natural 
resources 
isn’t 
availability 
or 
the 
weather, but Federal Government over-
reach. 
Late last year, President Biden with-
drew the Navigable Waters Protection 
Rule, which sought to undo the harm 
caused by the Waters of the United 
States rule from 2015, through which 
the Federal Government aimed to con-
trol nearly all bodies of water, regard-
less of their size or connection to larg-
er waterways. Because of this mess, 
farmers and ranchers have had to con-
duct their business under three dif-
ferent definitions of what amounts to 
‘‘water’’ in just 6 years. 
President Biden has also halted drill-
ing on Federal lands and halted con-
struction on the Keystone XL pipeline, 
exacerbating the price and shortage of 
American-made fuel. On our trip, Re-
publican leader THOMPSON and I saw a 
live oil well operated by a company 
that produced 60,000 barrels of oil last 
October from 363 active wells, and right 
next door, we saw an ethanol plant 
ready to supply America with depend-
able liquid fuel if President Biden 
would just ditch his unrealistic and ill- 
timed electric vehicle push. You can’t 
plow with a Prius. 
While I recognize things like protec-
tions against the harmful Waters of the 
U.S. rulings and oil and gas drilling do 
not live within the confines of the next 
farm bill, I also recognize that the pro-
tections and proper use of America’s 
resources are vital to the strength of 
American food and agriculture. 
The state of agriculture is strong be-
cause of the strength of American 
farmers, ranchers, and agriculture pro-
ducers. Congress has the responsibility 
to get them the resources they need to 
protect the resources they have to feed, 
fuel, and clothe the world. We must do 
our job.

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Holy God, set Your covenant before 
us this day. Show us how You have 
bound Yourself to us time and again 
throughout history and in our own 
lives. We need yet another reminder of 
the promises which You have so gra-
ciously given to Your people. 
Remind us, too, that You expect of us 
not just righteous, exemplary behavior 
but accountability and forgiveness. 
You desire not just our knowledge of 
scripture and adherence to Your law, 
but You desire that we check and re-
check our attitudes, that they remain 
examples, reflections of Your steadfast 
love for all people. 
You desire not just that we relish the 
forgiveness we have found in You, but 
that we share that mercy with each 
and all we meet, and that we do so with 
the same unbounded, uninhibited grace 
that You have shown us. 
Speak to us louder today, O Lord, 
that we can’t help but hear that You 
have called us into a marvelous rela-
tionship with You that we would then 
be compelled to share with one an-
other. 
Show us Your will, that we can’t help 
but respond with faithfulness to You 
and to the needs of the human family 
with whom we are inextricably bound. 
We listen. We wait. We pray to You 
this day by the fulfilled promise found 
in Your name. 
Amen.

lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

SUPPORTING RESTAURANT 
REVITALIZATION 
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. 
Speaker, restaurants have been hit par-
ticularly hard during the pandemic, 
taking on increasing costs while facing 
huge revenue losses. 
Thanks to the American Rescue 
Plan, the Restaurant Revitalization 
Fund provided $28.6 billion for res-
taurants nationwide and delivered over 
$85 million to restaurants in my com-
munity. 
Still, the demand was greater than 
the resources made available by Con-
gress, with over 175,000 eligible res-
taurants 
that 
applied 
for 
grants 
through the program going entirely un-
funded. 
This week, we have the opportunity 
to fill that gap, support small busi-
nesses, and save jobs by passing the 
Restaurant Revitalization Fund Re-
plenishment Act. I am proud to support 
this bill and encourage my colleagues 
to do the same. 
After a long, difficult period of isola-
tion, people are coming together and 
going back to restaurants, but we need 
to make whole these restaurants that 
have lost money based on nothing that 
they have done.

PUT AMERICANS FIRST 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, last 
week, President Biden announced a de-
cision to repeal one of the best tools 
our Nation has to deter illegal immi-
gration, title 42. 
Title 42 is a public health law that 
authorized 
U.S. 
border 
agents 
to 
promptly send back illegal immigrants 
if they pose a health risk to Americans

and are from a country with a commu-
nicable disease outbreak. 
This reckless decision comes as U.S. 
Customs and Border Patrol warned the 
historic surge at our border is already 
worsening, now even more so in antici-
pation of the rollback of this title. 
The U.S. will soon hit 1 million ille-
gal crossings of our borders in just the 
first half of this fiscal year, which 
began in October. 
Last week, Customs and Border Pa-
trol confirmed that over 300,000 illegal 
immigrants have illegally entered in 
just the last 6 months—300,000. This is 
known as the known got-aways, and 
the true number is most likely much 
higher. 
Title 42 expulsions account for over 
half of all expulsions; the ones with the 
health issues are half of expulsions. 
They will now be let in. 
Where are the concerns about Ameri-
cans’ health? We are just coming off 
this COVID situation. Where are Amer-
icans’ health concerns in this? 
This is a crazy policy that is not put-
ting Americans first. 
f 
SUPPORTING MARIJUANA 
DECRIMINALIZATION 
(Mr. PAYNE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to talk about how proud I was to 
support the Marijuana Opportunity Re-
investment and Expungement Act last 
week. It decriminalizes marijuana and 
expunges marijuana arrests from the 
books. 
Marijuana 
laws 
have 
been 
dev-
astating to minority communities. Af-
rican and Latino Americans are four 
times more likely to be arrested for 
marijuana offenses than are White 
Americans, and they receive longer 
prison sentences for the same crimes. 
Today, minorities are in prison for 
offenses that are no longer crimes in 
most States. This bill would give these 
Americans a fresh start. 
In addition, the bill has an oppor-
tunity trust fund to create opportuni-
ties for minority marijuana businesses. 
It is time we passed this bill and 
ended the gross injustice of marijuana 
law enforcement in this country. 
f 
PUTIN’S MASS MURDER 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, the civilized world is shocked 
at the discovery of mass murder by 
Putin in Bucha, Ukraine. 
It is inspiring the leadership of Presi-
dent Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the im-
mediate responses by Germany to Italy 
for expelling Putin’s murder-complicit 
diplomats. 
With innocent civilians discovered 
having their hands tied behind their 
backs, shot in the head, it is clear, war 
criminal Putin must be stopped with 
immediate military aid. 
Biden is correct to recognize this as 
part of the worldwide conflict of de-
mocracy with rule of law versus autoc-
racy with rule of gun. 
An undisputed atrocity is the Putin 
murder of the mayor of Motyzhyn and 
her family. 
I have faith in the Russian people 
with a great culture betrayed by the 
war criminal, Putin. There is legisla-
tion for defecting Russian troops, dip-
lomats, and Duma members to be pro-
vided 
expedited 
refugee 
status 
to 
America and up to $100,000 for any Rus-
sian military equipment turned over to 
Ukraine. 
Ukraine will achieve victory. God 
bless Ukraine. God save Ukraine. Long 
live Volodymyr Zelenskyy. 
Congratulations 
to 
Mayor 
Dan 
Rickenmann and the city of Columbia 
for sending aid to Ukraine. 
f 
JUSTICE THOMAS SHOULD RESIGN 
(Ms. MCCOLLUM asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, the 
actions of Justice Thomas and his wife, 
Virginia, have undermined the Con-
stitution. 
Ms. Thomas was in direct commu-
nication with the Trump White House 
in a conspiracy to undermine the 
peaceful transfer of power between 
Presidents. 
Justice Thomas should recuse him-
self from cases related to his wife’s in-
volvement. Yet, he took part in Court 
rulings and voted to prevent the disclo-
sure of White House communications. 
Justice Thomas failed to disclose his 
wife’s nearly $700,000 in income from 
The Heritage Foundation, an organiza-
tion working to stop the January 6 in-
vestigation. 
Justice Thomas has repeatedly failed 
to meet his ethical obligations of 
recusal and disclosure that are ex-
pected of a Federal judge. 
The American people entrust Mem-
bers of Congress and the Supreme 
Court to defend our Constitution, our 
laws, and our democracy. His wife’s in-
volvement in the attempt to overthrow 
the 2020 election, and Justice Thomas’ 
failure to recuse himself, have made 
him ethically compromised. He is unfit 
to be a natural arbiter of justice. 
Justice Thomas should resign from 
the Supreme Court.

RECOGNIZING GOLD STAR SPOUSE 
DAY 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
Gold Star Spouse Day. 
Today, we honor the surviving loved 
ones of military servicemembers who 
died while serving our country. This 
day offers remembrance for the spouses 
and their families as well as a time of 
recognition of their sacrifices. 
As an Army dad, I am blessed my son 
returned home. I am aware that this is 
not the case for all families, and we 
must take the time to remember, the 
time to respect, and the time to honor 
the spouses and their families of our 
fallen servicemembers. 
Gold Star Spouse Day brings aware-
ness of the sacrifices and grief these 
spouses and families have faced in the 
name of our country. 
Mr. Speaker, let us all take a mo-
ment to remember that our freedom is 
not free. Gold Star families have lost a 
loved one and paid a heavy price, all in 
the name of protecting our freedom. 
They deserve our gratitude today and 
every day. 
f 
ENDANGERING AMERICANS’ 
SAFETY 
(Mr. MOORE of Alabama asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. MOORE of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, President Biden is planning to lift 
President Trump’s successful title 42, a 
tragic decision that will endanger 
every American’s safety. 
Recent reporting further exposes the 
devastating consequences of President 
Biden’s doubling down on his far-left, 
open-border agenda. Not only will 
Biden’s reversal welcome in countless 
new illegal immigrants, but Biden 
wants Americans to pay to vaccinate 
them. 
But it gets worse. According to this 
report, the Biden administration is 
even considering pulling medical per-
sonnel from the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs to assist at the border, 
taking much-needed medical care away 
from our veterans, our very own vet-
erans. 
I ran for office because of our vet-
erans, because they are not receiving 
the care they have earned. That is why 
I have asked to serve on the Veterans’ 
Affairs Committee. 
These reports should outrage every 
patriotic 
American, 
regardless 
of 
party, Republican or Democrat. We 
must never prioritize foreign citizens 
illegally entering our country over our 
very own veterans. 
I was watching this morning, and we 
see these unaccompanied males coming 
into our country by the busloads. We 
have an invasion on our southern bor-
der, and our administration, this Presi-
dent’s administration, wants to take 
our veteran care and our healthcare 
workers to help treat the invading 
army.

SECURE THE BORDER NOW 
(Mrs. LESKO asked and was given

Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, we are at 
a crisis in America. We are at a crisis 
in Arizona. The Biden administration 
and the Democrats have done every-
thing in their power to open the south-
ern border. 
On day one, President Biden stopped 
funding for the border wall. Then, he 
took away all the good policies that 
the Trump administration had put in 
place, and now he is taking away the 
very last tool that we have to have 
some kind of semblance of border secu-
rity at our southern border. He is tak-
ing away title 42. 
I have spoken to both Border Patrol 
counsel, and I have spoken this morn-
ing to Secretary Mayorkas. We are 
going to see an even bigger flood of il-
legal immigrants crossing our border. 
The border is totally out of control, 
flooding our districts with drugs, flood-
ing our districts with people who have 
been charged with criminal activity in 
the past, sex slavery. 
Please, President Biden, secure the 
border now.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PAYNE) and the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. PFLUGER) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days to revise 
and extend their remarks and to in-
clude extraneous material on this 
measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of my bill, H.R. 6387, the School and 
Daycare Protection Act. 
Over the years, we have seen horrific 
school shootings from Columbine to 
Sandy Hook to Parkland. 
As a father of triplets, I cannot imag-
ine the pain of those who have lost 
loved ones to school violence. 
As I look back at my time leading 
the Committee on Homeland Security’s 
Subcommittee 
on 
Emergency 
Pre-
paredness, Response, and Recovery, I 
take pride in the work that we did in 
the school security space. 
Under my leadership, school security 
was, for the first time in Congress, 
viewed as a homeland security issue. 
The Department of Homeland Secu-
rity certainly takes that view, too. My 
bill, the School and Daycare Protec-
tion Act, recognizes that there are a di-
verse range of DHS entities with school 
and campus security responsibilities 
and seeks to ensure that activities are 
coordinated. 
H.R. 6387 establishes a standing coun-
cil within DHS to coordinate school se-
curity activities, plans, and policies, 
and requires DHS to report to Congress 
about the council’s activities. 
Additionally, it authorizes DHS to 
participate in the government-wide 
SchoolSafety.gov clearinghouse. 
Within DHS, there are some incred-
ibly useful school security strategies, 
tools, and research being produced. 
CISA published a K–12 School Secu-
rity Guide. Secret Service put out an 
operational guide for preventing tar-
geted 
school 
violence. 
And 
FEMA 
maintains a multi-hazard toolkit to 
help school officials manage every-
thing from tornadoes to active shoot-
ers. 
H.R. 6387 would help ensure that such 
DHS school security efforts are coordi-
nated to get education officials action-
able tools and support. 
A version of this bill passed the 
House last Congress, and in this Con-
gress, the committee approved it with 
strong bipartisan support. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my House col-
leagues to support this legislation, and 
I reserve the balance of my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4162 
April 5, 2022 
Mr. PFLUGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 6387, the School and Daycare 
Protection Act. 
This bill establishes a school security 
coordinating council within the De-
partment of Homeland Security to en-
sure the coordination of security plans 
and 
policies 
regarding 
terrorist 
threats. 
Importantly, the bill requires con-
sistent 
reporting 
to 
Congress 
on 
metrics regarding the efficacy of such 
activities and any engagement with 
the stakeholder community outside of 
the Federal Government. 
Additionally, it ensures that DHS is 
involved in Federal efforts to maintain 
and publicize a clearinghouse of re-
sources for schools to assist them in se-
curity preparation and planning. 
The Federal Government must do all 
it can to be a resource and to offer sup-
port to schools in the face of terrorism. 
I commend the gentleman from New 
Jersey for his leadership on this impor-
tant issue and ensuring security for all 
schools. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to join 
me in supporting H.R. 6387, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the balance of my time. 
I thank the gentleman for supporting 
this bill. We know that this is an issue 
that is of a bipartisan nature. We all 
want to make sure that our children 
are safe in school and between home 
and school. 
We all have an interest in getting the 
best information and resources to 
school administrators, teachers, and 
parents to protect our children. 
H.R. 6387 focuses on ensuring that 
DHS is effectively coordinating inter-
nally to help combat violence and 
other terrorist threats facing schools. 
Consideration of H.R. 6387 is particu-
larly timely, given how often schools 
continue to be targeted. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support H.R. 6387, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PAYNE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6387, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days to revise 
and extend their remarks and to in-
clude extraneous material on this 
measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of H.R. 5633, and yield such 
time as he may consume to the gen-
tleman from Mississippi (Mr. THOMP-
SON), the author of this bill and the 
chairman of the Committee on Home-
land Security. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman 
from New Jersey yielding me time. 
Mr. Speaker, my bill, H.R. 5633, the 
Department of Homeland Security In-
spector 
General 
Transparency 
Act, 
seeks to provide Congress and the pub-
lic greater insight into the findings of 
the independent body charged with 
overseeing the third-largest Federal 
department. 
The DHS Office of Inspector General 
has the dual mission of detecting 
waste, fraud, and abuse within the De-
partment and promoting economy, effi-
ciency, and effectiveness of Depart-
mental resources. 
Since the establishment of the De-
partment in 2003, Congress has looked 
to the DHS OIG to provide inde-
pendent, fact-based analysis into de-
partmental programs, activities, and 
personnel. 
Historically, the DHS OIG has pro-
vided critical oversight of the Depart-
ment, including audits of FEMA fol-
lowing 
Hurricane 
Katrina, 
whistle-
blower retaliation at the Coast Guard, 
and conditions at Immigration and 
Customs Enforcement detention facili-
ties. 
Troublingly, for the past 2 years, re-
ports regarding substantiated whistle-
blower retaliation or misconduct by 
senior DHS officials have been with-
held from Congress and the public. 
Last year, the Government Account-
ability Office released a report that 
brought to light significant and long-
standing operational weaknesses at the 
DHS OIG that GAO concluded have im-
pacted the quality and timeliness of 
the OIG’s work. 
Separately, an independent govern-
ment watchdog, the Project on Govern-
ment Oversight, in July 2021, found 
that the DHS OIG has repeatedly im-
peded and delayed ongoing investiga-
tions into alleged improper handling of 
intelligence and whistleblower retalia-
tion. 
My bill seeks to ensure that the DHS 
OIG operates in a more transparent 
manner with Congress and the public. 
Specifically, the legislation requires 
that the DHS OIG, when it substan-
tiates allegations of whistleblower re-
taliation or misconduct by senior De-
partment officials, provide those re-
ports to Congress and publish them on 
its website. 
This legislation also requires addi-
tional reporting by the DHS OIG in its 
semiannual report to Congress. 
When enacted, the semiannual report 
would be required to include a descrip-
tion of every ongoing audit, inspection, 
and evaluation, as well as data on the 
number and types of complaints and 
tips that OIG receives. 
Finally, H.R. 5633 requires the inspec-
tor general to notify Congress if the 
head of any DHS component or office 
fails to respond to a DHS OIG request 
in a timely manner. 
The Department of Homeland Inspec-
tor General Transparency Act has bi-
partisan support and was reported out 
of committee by voice vote. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my House col-
leagues to support this legislation. 
Mr. PFLUGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 5633, the Department of Home-
land Security Inspector General Trans-
parency Act. 
An important element of all Federal 
departments and agencies, especially 
DHS, is the Office of the Inspector Gen-
eral. Although we all wish there was no 
waste, fraud, or abuse within govern-
ment, the reality is it does exist, and it 
is the inspector general’s mission to 
help the Department identify and ad-
dress those issues as much as possible. 
I am fully supportive of the critical 
role that IGs play throughout the Fed-
eral Government, including my own 
time serving in the military. They are 
vital to ensuring accountability and 
transparency into each department and 
agency’s activities. 
This is especially important in a de-
partment like DHS with a mission so 
vital to the security of our country. 
DHS is tasked with safeguarding the 
American people, our homeland, and 
our values against all enemies foreign 
and domestic. 
To do this on a daily basis, we must 
ensure that the men and women of the 
Department are able to focus on their 
mission, and the IG’s office ensures 
this is done with integrity and honor. 
This bill, introduced by Chairman 
THOMPSON, requires the DHS inspector 
general to submit to Congress various 
reports that until now have not nec-
essarily been provided or available to 
the public. The American public de-
serves to know. 
The requirements in this bill would 
help to make the IG’s office and its im-
portant work more transparent not 
only to Congress but also to the Amer-
ican people. 
I urge Members to join me in sup-
porting H.R. 5633, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers, and I am prepared to 
close after the gentleman closes. 
b 1230 
Mr. PFLUGER. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no more speakers, and I am prepared to 
close. I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Speaker, just as a side note here, 
we have been talking about trans-
parency in this bill, and I think it is 
important that we do keep in mind 
that this is something that helps us in 
a nonpartisan way, regardless of the 
administration, and regardless of ‘‘who 
is in power at that time.’’ It is my sin-
cere hope that this particular bill will 
actually advocate for the mission of 
DHS and not for political gain, not for 
political outcome. 
It has been my experience in Federal 
Government that a well-operating and 
well-oiled machine within the inspec-
tor general’s office can help to be that 
check and that balance. And I think at 
this point in our history in the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security, we face 
threats that we have probably never 
faced in six or seven decades. And we 
haven’t seen the level and the intensity 
and the magnitude of those threats 
since before World War II, in my hum-
ble opinion. 
I believe, with this piece of legisla-
tion, that we can get to a point where 
the Department of Homeland Security 
does have that check and that balance, 
and provides the American public the 
information that is needed and the 
transparency that is needed. 
Whether it is on issues that are 
cyber; whether it is on issues that are 
directly targeting our homeland, or 
even on border issues, we do deserve 
transparency, and I think that is what 
the American public is asking for. I be-
lieve that is what this bill would do, 
and I urge my colleagues to support it. 
Mr. Speaker, I have no further speak-
ers on this, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
A transparent Office of Inspector 
General is a critical piece of a func-
tional and effective Department of 
Homeland Security. 
H.R. 5633 seeks to make the DHS OIG 
more transparent by requiring addi-
tional public reporting by the DHS OIG 
so that the public and Congress know 
how their tax dollars are spent and can 
hold the DHS Secretary and other lead-
ers within the department accountable

tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 1540, the REPORT Act. 
In December of 2015, a terrorist at-
tack in San Bernardino, California, left 
14 people dead and 22 wounded. Local 
law enforcement and first responders 
were heroes that day, saving lives just 
as they do every day across this Na-
tion. 
When terrorists strike our commu-
nities, Americans understandably have 
questions, and they look to us, their 
elected Representatives, for answers. 
Our 
constituents 
want 
to 
know 
whether there were warnings or indica-
tions of a potential attack; whether 
anything could have been done to pre-
vent it; and what can be done to thwart 
future attacks. 
H.R. 1540, the REPORT Act, authored 
by Congressman PETE AGUILAR, seeks 
to ensure that Members of Congress 
can be more responsive to their con-
stituents by requiring better commu-
nication by Federal agencies with Con-
gress following an attack. 
Specifically, the bill would require 
the Secretary of Homeland Security, in 
coordination with the Attorney Gen-
eral and the FBI Director, to submit to 
Congress an unclassified report within 
1 year of completing a terrorism inves-
tigation. 
The report, which may include a clas-
sified annex, must include a statement 
of facts regarding the attack; informa-
tion on any homeland or national secu-
rity gaps that could be addressed to 
prevent future attacks; and any rec-
ommendations for measures, including 
changes in the law, that would improve 
homeland or national security. 
This vital information needs to be 
shared by the executive branch with 
the legislative branch to strengthen 
our Nation’s terrorism response and 
prevention efforts. 
H.R. 1540 is a commonsense measure, 
and I urge my colleagues to support it. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. PFLUGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise today in support of H.R. 1540, 
the Reporting Efficiently to Proper Of-
ficials in Response to Terrorism, or the 
REPORT Act. 
Too many times, when a terrorism 
incident occurs within the United 
States, consistent and accurate infor-
mation is not communicated to Con-
gress. Many of us, especially from 
Texas, experienced this firsthand re-
cently, when a British national, Malik 
Faisal Akram, took hostages at the 
Beth 
Israel 
Congregation 
in 
Colleyville, Texas. 
And not only were the initial facts 
and circumstances of the incident un-
clear, but many questions remain un-
answered regarding Akram’s travel and 
admission into the United States. 
This is completely unacceptable. Not 
only should Congress have all of the 
necessary information regarding ter-
rorist attacks and other terrorism inci-
dents, but the American people deserve 
to know what happened and how our 
government is responding. 
The REPORT Act requires the DHS 
Secretary, the Attorney General, the 
FBI Director, and the Director of the 
National Counterterrorism Center, to 
submit an unclassified report to Con-
gress regarding any incident of ter-
rorism that occurs in the United 
States. The report must include the 
following: 
A statement of facts; any gaps in our 
homeland or national security that 
could be addressed to prevent future 
acts of terrorism; and recommenda-
tions for additional measures, or legis-
lative issues, to improve homeland or 
national security and prevent future 
acts of terrorism. 
I commend my colleagues, and spe-
cifically my colleague from California, 
for bringing this legislation before the 
Homeland Security Committee and to 
the floor today. 
I urge Members to join me in sup-
porting H.R. 1540, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to yield 5 minutes to the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. AGUILAR), 
the author of this commonsense legis-
lation. 
Mr. AGUILAR. Mr. Speaker, I want 
to thank my colleague from New Jer-
sey for yielding some time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4165 
April 5, 2022 
I rise in support of my bill, H.R. 1540, 
the REPORT Act. I first introduced the 
bill, as my colleague mentioned, after 
the 2015 attack in San Bernardino, a 
community that I have been proud to 
represent. This attack tragically took 
the lives of 14 people and wounded 22. If 
not for the work of our first respond-
ers, more innocent lives would have 
been lost that day. 
The REPORT Act would ensure that 
lawmakers and law enforcement agen-
cies are better prepared to detect, pre-
vent, and respond to future incidents of 
terrorism. 
If enacted, the Secretary of Home-
land Security, in coordination with the 
Attorney General and the FBI, would 
submit this unclassified report to Con-
gress whenever an act of domestic ter-
rorism occurs in the United States. 
By requiring the executive branch to 
share their findings with Congress, we, 
as representatives of our local commu-
nities, can act on the recommendations 
for changes and practices or law to pre-
vent attacks and to protect all commu-
nities. 
I appreciate my colleague from Texas 
talking about other incidents, and we 
know that incidents of mass violence 
continue to happen across our country, 
including the moment of silence that 
we had on the floor last evening. 
If we can work together to prevent 
one such incident from taking place, 
Mr. Speaker, if both parties can unite 
to save one innocent life, this legisla-
tion will have been a success. 
I appreciate the Homeland Security 
Committee staff for working to get this 
done, and my colleague from Texas and 
my colleague from New Jersey for lead-
ing this effort. 
I ask my colleagues for an ‘‘aye’’ 
vote. 
Mr. PFLUGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
I think this bill really strikes at the 
heart of what the Constitution says. 
We are a coequal branch of govern-
ment, and the check and the balance 
on the executive branch, the executive 
agencies, is very important. We are 
elected, and we have a responsibility to 
go to our districts to report back about 
incidents that are affecting our coun-
try negatively. 
And it is heartbreaking to hear any 
sort of terrorist attack, any sort of in-
cident that is aimed at undermining 
our national security. That is why this 
committee was formed in the wake of 9/ 
11. The purpose of our committee is to 
make sure that we have the ability to 
give the tools to those that are car-
rying out these missions; whether they 
are Customs and Border Protection, 
whether they are TSA agents, or any 
other agency that is entrusted with 
protecting the American public. 
We deserve to have that trans-
parency, as we have mentioned in a 
previous bill, and now to be able to re-
port back. So I commend my colleague 
for bringing this up. And it is my sin-
cere hope, similar to the other bills 
that we have discussed, that we can, as 
a coequal branch of government, offer 
that check and that balance on the ex-
ecutive branch, regardless of who is in 
power, regardless of the administra-
tion, to provide the necessary tools to 
continue to protect our country and all 
Americans. 
Mr. Speaker, I have no further speak-
ers. I urge Members to support this 
bill, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the balance of the time. 
Mr. Speaker, our Nation faces a com-
plex and evolving terrorism threat 
landscape. We all celebrate the heroic 
first responders who save lives when an 
attack occurs, but the American people 
also expect Congress to respond to at-
tacks and prevent future ones. 
The REPORT Act is a commonsense 
bill that would ensure Congress has the 
information necessary to do just that. 
The REPORT Act received bipartisan 
support during the committee consid-
eration, and an earlier version of the 
bill passed the House in the 115th Con-
gress by voice vote. 
I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 
1540, the REPORT Act, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PAYNE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1540, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
DHS ILLICIT CROSS-BORDER 
TUNNEL DEFENSE ACT 
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 4209) to support remediation of il-
licit cross-border tunnels, and for other 
purposes, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows:

and 
(2) remediation operations of illicit cross- 
border tunnels in accordance with the stra-
tegic plan to the maximum extent prac-
ticable. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PAYNE) and the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. PFLUGER) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days to revise 
and extend their remarks and to in-
clude any extraneous materials on this 
measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
4209, the DHS Illicit Cross-Border Tun-
nel Defense Act. 
Since 1990, more than 200 cross-bor-
der tunnels built by smugglers and 
transnational criminal organizations 
have done smuggling of illicit drugs, 
humans, weapons, and money, and have 
been discovered along the U.S. border 
with Mexico.

financing, or use of a tunnel or sub-
terranean passageway between the U.S. 
and another country. 
Yet, since that time, transnational 
criminal organizations, or TCOs, con-
tinue to construct illicit cross-border 
tunnels in the hopes of circumventing 
detection by border authorities. 
The tunnels are mainly used to traf-
fic narcotics, such as heroin, fentanyl, 
and methamphetamine, and facilitate 
the illicit movement of weapons, con-
traband, and currency. 
Introduced by Congressman PFLUGER, 
H.R. 4209 seeks to build upon existing 
law to enhance Customs and Border 
Protection’s capacity to detect and re-
mediate illicit cross-border tunnels. In 
2013, CBP established a Tunnel Pro-
gram Management Office to develop 
and acquire technology to detect tun-
nels. 
With funding and technological ad-
vances, CBP has significantly increased 
its ability to detect the existence of 
tunnels. These developments have al-
lowed the agency to progress from 
manual methods of detection, such as 
human observation of traffic patterns 
and routine patrol operations, to the 
use of sensors to detect, classify, and 
localize subterranean activity. 
To help the Tunnel Program Manage-
ment Office become more effective, 
H.R. 4209 provides dedicated funding 
and requires the development and im-
plementation of a comprehensive and 
strategic approach to tunnel threats. 
In addition to authorizing $1 million 
annually to purchase specialized mate-
rial to seal the tunnels, the bill directs 
DHS to issue a strategic plan that ad-
dresses resource needs, including tech-
nology and staffing needs, to identify, 
assess, and remediate illicit tunnels. 
The bill also requires the submission 
of a report to Congress on activities 
carried out to implement the strategy. 
This legislation is very timely. Just 
as technology that allows our govern-
ment to detect the existence of these 
illicit tunnels has improved, so has the 
technology 
used 
by 
transnational 
criminal organizations to construct 
them. 
In January 2020, CBP discovered the 
longest smuggling tunnel ever found on 
the U.S.-Mexico border. The tunnel 
stretched for more than 4,000 feet and 
was equipped with a makeshift eleva-
tor, drainage and air ventilation, and 
high-voltage electrical cables. 
The consequences of not detecting 
and shutting down these illicit cross- 
border tunnels stretch far beyond our 
border communities. The impact of 
narcotics and weapons making their 
way into American communities can be 
devastating. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support H.R. 4209, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PFLUGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong 
support of H.R. 4209, my bill, the DHS 
Illicit Cross-Border Tunnel Defense 
Act. I thank my colleague from New 
Jersey for his support. 
It is important to say that this is one 
step. It is not the solution for all the 
problems that we face at our southern 
border, but it is one important piece. 
Since President Biden took office in 
January 2021, U.S. Customs and Border 
Protection has had over 2.2 million mi-
grant encounters along the southwest 
border. 
Due to the sheer numbers of mi-
grants that are flooding across the bor-
der, CBP personnel, including Border 
Patrol agents, are often diverted from 
their essential jobs, their daily tasks 
to process migrants, most of whom 
crossed the United States-Mexico bor-
der illegally between ports of entry. 
With Border Patrol agents occupied 
with other tasks and not patrolling the 
border, the security of our southwest 
border, and, therefore, the security of 
our Nation, has been crippled while 
cartels take full advantage. 
In addition to the record number of 
migrant encounters, CBP has been 
interdicting growing quantities of ille-
gal 
narcotics, 
especially 
methamphetamines, 
fentanyl, 
and 
other fentanyl-laced drugs, along the 
border. 
For the first time, the United States 
has reached a tragic record, an unfor-
tunate number of over 100,000 drug 
overdose deaths in a 1-year period. I 
want to repeat this: over 100,000 over-
dose deaths directly related to fentanyl 
in this past year, the most ever re-
corded in the United States. Addition-
ally, according to the CDC, fentanyl is 
now the leading cause of death for 
Americans aged 18 to 45. 
In one of the communities that I rep-
resent, Odessa, Texas, law enforcement 
officials have reported 22 fentanyl 
overdoses in just 90 days. Parents na-
tionwide are scared for their kids, and 
there is good reason for that fear. 
Fentanyl-related deaths nearly doubled 
the death rates from COVID–19, car ac-
cidents, cancer, and even suicide. 
We need a plan, a strategy. A corner-
stone of this strategy must be to stop 
the supply of drugs that are flowing 
into our country. 
Mexico is now the primary source of 
fentanyl and synthetic opioids entering 
the United States. Of course, smug-
gling those drugs across the border 
comes with the risk of packages being 
seized by our border and law enforce-
ment agencies. To minimize this risk, 
in 1989, the Sinaloa Cartel built their 
first-ever narco tunnel, as has been 
heard this morning on this House floor. 
Back then, narco tunnels were short 
and unsophisticated. Over time, the 
cartels have learned and perfected 
these tunnels. They are longer, more 
sophisticated. They come with lights, 
with ventilation systems, with rail 
carts. They facilitate the movement of 
drugs and other illicit commodities, in-
cluding the trafficking of people, bulk 
cash, and weapons. 
Since 1990, law enforcement officials 
have discovered more than 230 of these 
cross-border tunnels, and there are 
likely more tunnels that exist between 
Mexico and the United States that are 
yet undiscovered. That is the heart of 
this bill. 
CBP’s tunnel technology program 
has matured over the years. Under the 
direction of U.S. Border Patrol, this 
program has been testing and acquiring 
technologies that do three essential 
things: predict tunnel locations, detect 
and project the paths of the tunnels, 
and confirm a tunnel’s existence and 
location through mapping and meas-
urements. 
As CBP develops enhanced capabili-
ties that will do the detection of the 
tunnels, drug cartels have become 
more emboldened, and they are cre-
ating more elaborate and harder-to-de-
tect tunnel systems. Without this crit-
ical legislation, CBP truly lacks the 
ability to scale their tunnel interdic-
tion and remediation operations. 
The DHS Illicit Cross-Border Tunnel 
Defense Act addresses this issue by re-
quiring CBP to develop a counter tun-
nel operations plan that would address 
risk-based criteria for interdicting and 
remediating illicit tunnels. 
They will also look at the processes 
for sharing information on these tun-
nels, key indicators of tunnel construc-
tion to educate field personnel, and re-
quire an assessment of technology and 
personnel needs. 
Additionally, this legislation would 
authorize funding for CBP to counter 
tunnel interdiction and remediation 
operations. 
With the surge of illicit border activ-
ity both above and below ground, CBP 
needs resources to combat illicit cross- 
border tunnels to secure our homeland 
and protect our national security. 
Passage of this legislation will dis-
rupt and dismantle cartel smuggling 
operations, 
safeguarding 
American 
communities from the illegal narcotics 
problem that we see is completely dev-
astating our country, including my 
home State of Texas. 
Border security is national security. 
I thank Chairman THOMPSON and Rank-
ing Member KATKO for bringing this 
important 
legislation 
to 
the 
floor 
today. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote in favor of my bill, H.R. 4209, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the distinguished gentle-
woman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from New Jersey 
for his consistent leadership as he 
serves as chair and ranking member of 
a number of subcommittees of the 
Homeland Security Committee. He has 
been not only an effective manager 
here on the floor, but he has been a 
very effective Member and effective 
leader on so many issues. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H.R. 
4209 from my colleague and friend from 
Texas (Mr. PFLUGER). 
After years of service on the Home-
land Security Committee and any num-
ber of times going to the border, I 
would like to first describe and ac-
knowledge that the southern border is 
many things.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4167 
April 5, 2022 
It is a lifeline to desperate people 
who are fleeing horrible, violent situa-
tions that include the decapitating of 
their sons and daughters or their hus-
bands and even wives. With the vio-
lence of some of the oppressive states 
in Central and South America, where 
young boys are recruited right out of 
their homes for gangs, gang warfare, 
those families are intimidated and 
frightened if they do not give their 
boys to these major gangs and cartels. 
We have had any number of a series 
of the flow of massive influx of mi-
grants from the region. Many may 
come out of desperation for economic 
reasons, but many come with credible 
fear. We expect that that may even 
occur as early as the next couple of 
months. I implore my colleagues to re-
spond to that desperation in a unified, 
committed, 
and 
dedicated 
way 
of 
Democrats and Republicans reminding 
themselves that the Statue of Liberty 
may be along the New York shore, but 
people view this place as a refuge. 
As a resident of Houston, I can attest 
to the fact that Ukrainians, Afghans, 
Africans, Haitians, and, yes, those from 
South and Central America, and as far 
away as Southeast Asia, are now con-
gregating at the southern border. I, 
too, was in Del Rio when the massive 
movement of human beings flowed for 
desperate reasons. 
This DHS Illicit Cross-Border Tunnel 
Defense Act is what we need as it re-
lates to the known cartels and persons 
who are desperate to do evil and to 
bring the goods that will destroy our 
young and others who are addicted into 
the United States. 
This is the way. They have proudly 
said that we build tunnels with lights, 
air-conditioning, in whatever manner 
to make them palatable to be able to 
block, if you will, our law enforcement 
from achieving their goals. 
As the first Member of Congress to 
bring a human trafficking hearing to 
Houston, which is known as the epi-
center of human trafficking, this is 
vital legislation to stop the scourge of 
human trafficking, of bringing young 
children and young women. 
We already know that at the Ukrain-
ian borders in different countries, there 
is trafficking of young kids who are 
not killed by Putin; that they are traf-
ficking children and women in that cri-
sis situation. They have no moral com-
pass. 
This bill, which strengthens DHS’ ef-
forts to identify and remediate illicit 
cross-border tunnels built and utilized 
by transnational criminal organiza-
tions and smugglers on the southwest 
border, is crucial. 
Mr. Speaker, I particularly support 
the Secretary’s direction to issue a 
strategic plan that addresses resource 
needs, including technology and staff-
ing needs. What is needed is a million 
dollars in funding for fiscal years 2023 
and 2024 to acquire material to reme-
diate illicit cross-border tunnels. 
I have said that they have regular, 
good living conditions in these tunnels 
because they are so extensive. This ma-
terial 
includes 
specialized 
concrete 
with enough viscosity to efficiently fill 
tunnels with fewer insertion points. 
We need to combine our efforts as we 
deal with the scourge of the violent 
cartels: bloody, guns, intimidating peo-
ple, and, of course, bringing in illegal 
entities, some that are human life, into 
the United States. 
b 1300 
The southern border is quite different 
from the northern border, and we must 
provide the technology for those who 
are there. 
But as I make that point, Mr. Speak-
er, I do believe as well that we are 
never going to get anywhere as Ameri-
cans, we are never going to win the 
fight on immigration, on migration, or 
refugees if we continue to stand in our 
individual corners. We have to face it. 
People view this as a beacon of light. 
You can try to snuff that out, you can 
try to turn the light off, and you can 
try to tell them to go back, but they 
are entrenched with legacy history 
passed down that this is the place to 
seek opportunity and refuge. 
So I support the legislation. I thank 
the gentleman from Texas for his hard 
work. I believe this is an important 
element to bipartisan commitment to 
securing our borders in the right way, 
and I thank him for his leadership. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman 
from New Jersey, the chairman, and 
the ranking member of the full com-
mittee. 
Mr. PFLUGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Washington (Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER). 
Ms. 
HERRERA 
BEUTLER. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank 
Congressman 
PFLUGER for his leadership on not just 
this legislation but the issue as a whole 
because securing our border is so im-
portant for Americans and really for 
security in the rest of the world. It is 
not an extreme view to make sure that 
we have control for the safety and se-
curity of our people over our borders. 
So I thank the gentleman for his lead-
ership here, and I am very proud to 
lend my support to this legislation. 
I recently met with a Joint Narcotics 
Enforcement Team in Lewis County, 
southwest Washington which I rep-
resent, and it is a community bisected 
by the West Coast’s largest freeway, I– 
5, that runs from Mexico to Canada. 
These officers reported confiscating 
hundreds of thousands of pills laced 
with fentanyl, not to mention record 
amounts of other illicit drugs. 
They told me, about 95 percent of the 
drugs that they have confiscated come 
via Mexico and the amount that they 
confiscate is just a tiny fraction of the 
flood of drugs that are never seized by 
law enforcement. 
That means what is happening on our 
borders has a direct and devastating 
impact on the lives of those in south-
west Washington and across our Na-
tion. 
A big factor in the success of these 
drug cartels is underground, illegal 
tunnels along the southern border. 
Last year, U.S. officials found a 183- 
foot-long subterranean tunnel near the 
border used by drug traffickers to con-
duct illegal activities completely unde-
tected by border patrol. 
The bill I helped advance for House 
consideration today would help the 
Border Patrol shut down these illegal 
underground tunnels used by cartels to 
smuggle drugs and conduct human 
trafficking underneath our southern 
border. 
This is a commonsense and very nec-
essary step to slow the trafficking of 
drugs and human beings which is being 
felt not just along the border States 
but in southwest Washington State and 
across this country. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of the 
bill. 
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
more speakers, and I am prepared to 
close after the gentleman. 
Mr. PFLUGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. KATKO), who is the ranking 
member of the Homeland Security 
Committee and my good friend. 
Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of the home-
land security legislation being consid-
ered on the floor today. 
Specifically, I would like to acknowl-
edge the two Republican-led bills. 
First, H.R. 4209, the DHS Illicit 
Cross-Border Tunnel Defense Act spon-
sored by my good friend and colleague, 
the 
ranking 
member 
of 
the 
Sub-
committee on Intelligence and Coun-
terterrorism, Representative PFLUGER. 
This important piece of legislation is 
critical to addressing the rampant 
challenge of illicit cross-border tunnels 
used by cartels to traffic people, drugs, 
and other illicit commodities into the 
United States. Make no mistake: we 
must take action to address the crisis 
levels of fentanyl flowing into our com-
munities. 
So far this year, Customs and Border 
Patrol has seized enough fentanyl to 
kill 2.4 billion people. Let me say that 
again. 
They 
have 
seized 
enough 
fentanyl to kill 2.4 billion people, or 
the entire U.S. population, seven times 
over. Enabling frontline law enforce-
ment to detect and mitigate the use of 
these tunnels by passing this legisla-
tion is an important step we can take 
to secure the border. 
I would also like to thank my other 
good friend, the gentleman from Michi-
gan (Mr. MEIJER) who leads the Sub-
committee on Oversight, Management, 
and Accountability for 
introducing 
H.R. 4476, the DHS Trade and Economic 
Security Council Act. 
The COVID 19 pandemic uncovered 
many weaknesses in our supply chains. 
This first became apparent in the early 
days of the pandemic when the United 
States struggled to get such basic 
things as personal protective equip-
ment. More recently, larger issues have 
surfaced among multiple industries as 
they struggle to meet demand due to 
supply chain issues. These issues are so 
large and profound that they very 
much impact our national security.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4168 
April 5, 2022 
This 
measure 
codifies 
two 
rec-
ommendations made by the Homeland 
Security Advisory Council on how we 
can strengthen our Nation’s economic 
security while at the same time com-
bating the growing influence of China 
on the United States economy. 
I commend my colleague, Represent-
ative MEIJER, for introducing this bill, 
and I am very proud to be a cosponsor 
of this legislation. As COVID–19 has 
galvanized bipartisan concerns about 
the Nation’s economic security, now is 
the time to act. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support both of these important pieces 
of legislation. 
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. PFLUGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker I think it is important 
to note here that we are not going to 
declare victory. Celebrations will be 
minimal should this bill pass, and I 
urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘aye.’’ I ap-
preciate the support of the gentleman 
from New Jersey, of the chairman, and 
of the ranking member. 
This is step one out of 100 different 
steps. As somebody with a military 
background who was charged with pro-
tecting airspace, defensive counter-air, 
the border is very similar. It is layered. 
It is not just one piece that really is 
the magic solution. There are many 
different approaches that need to be 
considered. 
This is one, as I said, out of hundreds 
of steps that need to be accomplished 
to prevent the fentanyl that we just 
heard about that could kill every 
American multiple times, to prevent 
the rest of the drugs that are flowing 
into our country, to prevent the traf-
ficking and the crime, and really the 
overwhelming of our local commu-
nities. 
As I mentioned, in Odessa, Texas, re-
cently, we uncovered the fact that in 90 
days we had almost 20 overdoses from 
fentanyl. It is a layered defense that is 
required, so many more steps need to 
be taken. I am proud to sponsor this 
legislation to continue to push for that 
defense and that architecture to be in 
place. 
We need strength, we need deter-
rence, we need resolve, and, most im-
portantly, we need the political will in 
a nonpartisan way to bring America 
back together and the Committee on 
Homeland Security to secure the safety 
of every single American. 
Mr. Speaker, I have no further speak-
ers on this bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, let me just commend 
the gentleman from Texas for this 
well-thought-out legislation. The chal-
lenge of ending the scourge of drugs in 
our communities is complex as there 
are many ways these poisons come into 
our communities. 
H.R. 4209 targets illicit cross-border 
tunnels. By joining me in supporting 
this legislation today, Members can 
help CBP continue to carry out its de-
tection and remediation program in a 
strategic and commonsense way. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4209 seeks to make 
smart and bipartisan investments in 
our Nation’s border security. For that 
reason, I urge my colleagues to support 
H.R. 4209, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PAYNE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4209, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

SECURITY COUNCIL ACT OF 2021

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include any ex-
traneous materials on this measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, today I rise to urge my 
colleagues to support H.R. 4476, the 
DHS Trade and Economic Security 
Council Act of 2021. 
One of the Department of Homeland 
Security’s core missions is to preserve 
and uphold the Nation’s prosperity and 
economic security. However, in 2020, 
DHS completed an economic security 
assessment that found that COVID–19 
‘‘laid bare some growing gaps in the 
U.S. 
economy, 
particularly 
around 
manufacturing and supply chains for 
tangible goods.’’ 
To ensure the U.S. has a secure, resil-
ient, and prosperous economy, the as-
sessment concluded supply chain gaps 
that could be exploited by adversaries 
should be mitigated. 
H.R. 4476 seeks to help minimize such 
vulnerabilities and enhance economic 
security efforts at DHS by codifying 
two existing entities within the De-
partment: one, the DHS Trade and Eco-
nomic Security Council and, two, the 
position of Assistant Secretary for 
Trade and Economic Security. 
H.R. 4476 specifies that the mission of 
the council, composed of members 
across the Department, is to assist the 
DHS Secretary with identifying risks 
to trade and economic security, setting 
priorities for the Nation’s trade and 
economic 
security, 
and 
proposing 
changes to enhance economic security. 
Additionally, H.R. 4476 outlines what 
the Assistant Secretary for Trade and 
Economic Security’s responsibilities 
would be to perform, including supply 
chain activities and enhancements. 
H.R. 4476 will help enhance the reli-
ability of our domestic supply of essen-
tial goods to secure our economy. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this legislation, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,

DEAR CHAIRMAN THOMPSON: I write con-
cerning H.R. 4476, the ‘‘DHS Trade and Eco-
nomic Security Council Act of 2021,’’ which 
was additionally referred to the Committee 
on Energy and Commerce. 
In recognition of the desire to expedite 
consideration of H.R. 4476, the Committee 
agrees to waive formal consideration of the 
bill as to provisions that fall within the Rule 
X jurisdiction of the Committee. The Com-
mittee takes this action with the mutual un-
derstanding that we do not waive any juris-
diction over the subject matter contained in 
this or similar legislation, and that the Com-
mittee will be appropriately consulted and 
involved as this bill or similar legislation 
moves forward so that we may address any 
remaining issues within our jurisdiction. I 
also request that you support my request to 
name members of the Committee to any con-
ference committee to consider such provi-
sions. 
Finally, I would appreciate the inclusion of 
this letter into the report on H.R. 4476. 
Sincerely,

DEAR CHAIRMAN PALLONE: Thank you for 
your letter regarding H.R. 4476, the ‘‘DHS 
Trade and Economic Security Council Act of 
2021.’’ I recognize that the Committee on En-
ergy and Commerce has a jurisdictional in-
terest in H.R. 4476, and I appreciate your ef-
fort to allow this bill to be considered on the 
House floor. 
I concur with you that forgoing action on 
the bill does not in any way prejudice the 
Committee on Energy and Commerce with 
respect to its jurisdictional prerogatives on 
this bill or similar legislation in the future, 
and I would support your effort to seek ap-
pointment of an appropriate number of con-
ferees to any House—Senate conference in-
volving this legislation. 
I will include our letters on H.R. 4476 in the 
Committee report on this measure and in the 
Congressional Record during floor consider-
ation of this bill. I look forward to working 
with you on this legislation and other mat-
ters of great importance to this Nation. 
Sincerely, 
BENNIE G. THOMPSON, 
Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security. 
Mr. PFLUGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong 
support of H.R. 4476, the DHS Trade 
and Economic Security Council Act. 
The past few years have been incred-
ibly difficult for Americans across the 
country, with the COVID–19 pandemic, 
the supply chain crisis, and record in-
flation, among many others. These 
challenges have shown all of us the im-
portance of our economic security and 
the impact that our economy can have 
on both our homeland and/or national 
security, and that of our partners and 
allies. 
Our reliance on foreign products and 
manufacturing, from personal protec-
tive equipment like masks and gloves 
to key technology components like 
computer chips, have had drastic im-
pacts on this country over the past few 
years. 
While there is ongoing work within 
the Federal Government with regard to 
trade, supply chain, and economic se-
curity, it is clear that we still must do 
more. 
The Department of Homeland Secu-
rity has a unique position within our 
government to safeguard the homeland 
and the American people. This is no 
longer only limited to overt acts of ter-
rorism as we have talked about today, 
but the security and stability of our 
economy is critical to our national se-
curity. H.R. 4476 addresses this by codi-
fying the DHS Trade and Economic Se-
curity Council as well as the DHS As-
sistant Secretary of Trade and Eco-
nomic Security. This will ensure better 
preparedness of U.S. supply chains in 
the face of future pandemics, disasters, 
and emergencies. 
I commend my friend from Michigan 
for his leadership on this issue, and I 
encourage DHS to lean into its unique 
role to strengthen our economic secu-
rity. 
Mr. Speaker, I also urge my col-
leagues to support H.R. 4476, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
b 1315 
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. PFLUGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentleman from Michi-
gan (Mr. MEIJER), the leader of this 
bill. 
Mr. MEIJER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of H.R. 4476, 
the DHS Trade and Economic Security 
Council Act. 
The importance of our Nation’s eco-
nomic security cannot be overstated. 
For our country, economic security 
means peace and stability. It means 
the ability to be entrepreneurs and to 
freely produce and consume goods and 
services. For each of us as individuals, 
it means a secure livelihood, safe com-
munities for our children to grow up 
in, and opportunities to build new in-
stitutions and contribute to society. 
The level of economic security that 
we enjoy depends largely on the flow of 
goods, services, and information across 
our borders. 
Over the past few years, we have seen 
this flow interrupted significantly. Our 
supply chains were challenged and, at 
times, 
overwhelmed. 
Unfortunately, 
these challenges are likely to continue 
and increase because of the depend-
encies we have built on hostile nations, 
including our overwhelming trade with 
China. 
Vladimir Putin’s unprovoked inva-
sion of Ukraine is just another re-
minder of the global dependency on

Russian energy production and the dev-
astating 
national 
security 
con-
sequences of being economically de-
pendent on our adversaries. 
The threats to our economic security 
are numerous and growing and cannot 
be overstated. The peace and pros-
perity of our country is at risk. 
We saw the first inklings of this 
threat at the start of the COVID–19 
pandemic when the U.S. could not find 
enough personal protective equipment 
for its hospitals and medical providers, 
and China threatened our security by 
imposing export restrictions on masks 
and ventilator components, preventing 
U.S. companies from getting the deliv-
eries they needed from their own sub-
sidiaries. 
This was just the tip of the iceberg. 
We know that China is working hard to 
expand its global economic reach in a 
variety of ways. 
A report by the DHS Homeland Secu-
rity Advisory Council correctly stated 
that: ‘‘DHS has no choice but to play a 
larger role in economic security issues. 
It is charged with preparing for all 
manner of crises . . . from major hurri-
canes to terrorist attacks.’’ 
The 
report 
also 
highlighted 
the 
threat that China poses, and it stated 
that these new, long-term threats are 
economic, and the new weapons are 
trade deals, technological innovation, 
and critical supply chain dependencies. 
The U.S.-China strategic competition 
is increasingly driven by who controls 
these underlying systems and the rules 
by which we advance our economic in-
terests. We cannot allow ourselves to 
be behind the curve in the next na-
tional or global disaster. We need to 
get ahead of it. 
To that end, the report made two rec-
ommendations on how the Department 
can combat China’s influence while 
also contributing to our economic se-
curity. 
First, the report concluded that to 
keep the civilian side of our economy 
functioning in a time of crisis, Con-
gress should institutionalize a politi-
cally appointed official to conduct day- 
to-day policy coordination and who re-
sides within the Office of Strategy, 
Policy, and Plans. This bill codifies 
such an assistant secretary position in 
that office. 
Second, the report recommended that 
DHS institutionalize a council that 
would identify concentrated economic 
risks, set priorities, and coordinate en-
terprise-wide action on economic secu-
rity matters. This bill follows that rec-
ommendation by establishing the DHS 
Trade and Economic Security Council 
while also defining its roles and respon-
sibilities. 
Codifying these important facets of 
the Department is a critical step to en-
suring our economic security. The 
work that this council and the assist-
ant secretary will do is critically im-
portant to the Nation’s response and 
resilience to the next unforeseen global 
crisis. 
It is crucial that DHS lean into its 
unique position as the only executive 
agency that deals with both the na-
tional security and economic pros-
perity of the Nation and lead the 
United States Government as the pre-
eminent economic security agency in 
the decades to come. 
I am proud to have led this impor-
tant and timely effort. I thank my 
friend and colleague, Ranking Member 
KATKO, for being an original cosponsor, 
and 
I 
also 
thank 
Representatives 
LURIA, DELGADO, and SLOTKIN, in par-
ticular, for reaching across the aisle. 
Economic security is truly homeland 
security. I urge my colleagues to sup-
port this important bill. 
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. PFLUGER. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
Members to vote for this bill, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, the COVID–19 pandemic 
disrupted America’s economic security 
and exposed supply chain vulnerabili-
ties. 
As a proud New Jerseyan, I would 
like to acknowledge the yeoman’s work 
the Port of New York and New Jersey, 
the largest container port on the East 
Coast, has done during the pandemic to 
meet the demands of the growth in e- 
commerce and move cargo into our 
communities in a timely way. 
As our economy continues to recover, 
H.R. 4476 will help ensure that DHS is 
well-positioned to proactively address 
potential threats and vulnerabilities 
that could be exploited by adversaries 
or exacerbated. 
I thank my colleagues on the Home-
land Security Committee for unani-
mously supporting H.R. 4476, and I urge 
all of my colleagues to do the same. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PAYNE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4476, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, on that 
I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

Analysis in order to qualify for financial as-
sistance. 
(d) ADJUSTMENT.—The amount in sub-
section (a) shall be adjusted annually to re-
flect changes in the Consumer Price Index

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from Or-
egon (Mr. DEFAZIO) and the gentleman 
from Missouri (Mr. GRAVES) each will 
control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Oregon. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 5689, 
as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Oregon? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
5689, the Resilient AMERICA Act. This 
bill reflects a bipartisan agreement 
that will significantly enhance U.S. 
mitigation and resilience efforts. 
Federal policy that focuses on invest-
ment in mitigation and bolstering re-
silience is basic good governance and 
will lessen the impacts of future disas-
ters. For years, studies have dem-
onstrated that taxpayers save up to $11 
for every single dollar invested in miti-
gation before a disaster strikes. There 
is no better investment. 
This legislation builds on existing 
mitigation efforts and will make our 
Nation more resilient. 
First, this legislation increases the 
amount of mitigation funding FEMA 
may make available to States through 
the Pre-Disaster Mitigation program, 
also known as BRIC, and makes non-
profits eligible recipients of these 
funds. 
Second, 
it 
expands 
the 
kind 
of 
projects eligible for mitigation assist-
ance through the Hazard Mitigation 
Grant Program. This includes enhanc-
ing the resilience of utilities to risks 
from wildfire, which will be of great 
benefit in the Western States. 
Third, this legislation sets aside 
funds for the implementation and en-
forcement of the latest building codes 
and standards. Building codes make 
our buildings safer and more resilient. 
Proper building codes that account for 
climate change can mean the dif-
ference between saving a family’s home 
and a total loss during a disaster. I 
strongly support efforts to prepare 
buildings for actual hazard risks and 
climate change with updated codes. 
Lastly, this legislation creates a 
pilot 
program 
to 
fund 
resilience 
projects at private homes. Often, home-
owners 
cannot 
implement 
rec-
ommended mitigation efforts, such as 
creating defensible space to protect 
against wildfires or removing over-
hanging branches to remove the risk of 
damage from severe storms, because 
they are too expensive. 
This pilot program will create the 
first Federal grant program that allows 
homeowners to proactively take miti-
gation into their own hands. I am con-
fident that empowering individuals 
through this program will make fami-
lies and their homes more resilient 
and, again, in the end, save taxpayers 
money. 
Representing a district that was im-
pacted by catastrophic wildfires, par-
ticularly in 2020, has made me pain-
fully aware of the importance of the 
provisions within this legislation. I 
wish that this bill and the mitigation 
investments it authorizes could have 
been enacted prior to the 2020 fires. It 
may have saved some of my constitu-
ents from the trauma of losing their 
homes. 
I thank Ranking Member GRAVES, as 
well as Subcommittee on Economic De-
velopment, 
Public 
Buildings, 
and 
Emergency Management Chair TITUS 
and Ranking Member WEBSTER
for 
their support and for working with us 
on this legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on 
both sides to join us and support the 
Resilient AMERICA Act, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to cospon-
sor H.R. 5689, the Resilient AMERICA 
Act, along with Chairman DEFAZIO and 
Subcommittee on Economic Develop-
ment, Public Buildings, and Emergency 
Management Chair TITUS and Ranking 
Member WEBSTER. This bill is going to 
strengthen our support for commu-
nities and individuals in mitigating 
disasters. 
We know that for every dollar in-
vested upfront in mitigation, $4 to $11 
are saved in damages from a disaster. 
Given that, one way we lower costs of 
future disasters is by investing upfront 
in mitigation. 
This bill builds on the bipartisan 
work that we did on mitigation in the

Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2018. 
It ensures mitigation funds are spent 
and targeted in ways to support efforts 
by communities and homeowners to 
save lives and reduce damage. 
In my district, my constituents regu-
larly experience flooding that not only 
causes damage to homes and businesses 
but disrupts lives and displaces people. 
Sadly, the time it takes to recover and 
receive assistance is far too long. 
I am glad to see more being done to 
make commonsense investments on the 
front end through mitigation projects, 
which will save taxpayers money. More 
importantly, it can help save lives. 
This bill also has the support of sev-
eral groups, including the National As-
sociation of Home Builders. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
a letter of support from the National 
Association of Home Builders.

DEAR
CHAIRMAN
DEFAZIO
AND
RANKING 
MEMBER GRAVES: On behalf of the more than 
140,000 members of the National Association 
of Home Builders (NAHB), I write in support 
of H.R. 5689, the Resilient AMERICA Act. 
The resilience and pre-disaster mitigation 
initiatives contained in this bipartisan bill 
would provide a comprehensive and preemp-
tive approach to reducing the risks of nat-
ural disasters while preserving important 
flexibilities at the state and local levels. 
NAHB supports a comprehensive approach 
to addressing natural disasters through ini-
tiatives focused on implementing cost-effec-
tive solutions that encourage greater resil-
iency in the nation’s housing stock—while 
preserving housing affordability. The Resil-
ient AMERICA Act would invest in common- 
sense mitigation activities, with an empha-
sis on residential retrofits for improving re-
siliency in older homes. Expanding mitiga-
tion opportunities and creating incentives to 
facilitate upgrades and improvements to 
older homes and structures would help to re-
duce risks and minimize losses from future 
catastrophes. 
NAHB also supports the incorporation of 
language that respects state and local juris-
dictions’ control over building code adoption 
by providing flexibility to adopt one of the 
two latest published codes. In addition, the 
bill includes a provision that would provide 
consistency in how FEMA evaluates which 
code a jurisdiction has adopted. This lan-
guage will provide the flexibility needed for 
communities to take positive steps to with-
stand and recover from extreme events. 
We urge the passage of H.R. 5689 to make 
American communities more resilient while 
also protecting important building code 
flexibilities at the state and local levels. 
Thank you for considering our views. 
Sincerely, 
JAMES W. TOBIN III, 
Executive Vice President & Chief Lobbyist. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank Chairman DEFAZIO
for 
working with us on this bill as we have 
all seen the effects of disaster in our 
districts and across America. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this 
bipartisan legislation, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I include 
in the RECORD two letters of support 
for H.R. 5689, one from the Build 
Strong Coalition and one from the U.S. 
Chamber of Commerce. 
BUILDSTONG COALITION, 
Washington, DC, March 1, 2022. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. KEVIN MCCARTHY, 
Minority Leader, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. DINA TITUS, 
Subcommittee Chair, House T&I Committee, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. DANIEL WEBSTER, 
Subcommittee Ranking Member, 
House T&I Committee, Washington, DC. 
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI AND LEADER MCCAR-
THY: The BuildStrong Coalition writes to ex-
press our strong support for H.R. 5689, the 
Resilient Assistance for Mitigation for Envi-
ronmentally Resilient Infrastructure and 
Construction by Americans (AMERICA) Act, 
which was passed out of the Committee on 
Transportation and Infrastructure on Octo-
ber 27, 2021, with almost unanimous backing. 
The undersigned organizations, as part of the 
BuildStrong Coalition, urge you to schedule 
consideration of the bipartisan legislation on 
the House floor as soon as possible. 
This legislation builds on the resilience 
initiatives contained in the bipartisan infra-
structure package and provides additional 
tools for families, businesses, and commu-
nities to reduce climate risks ahead of the 
next crisis. As our nation’s disaster profile 
becomes increasingly volatile and the in-
stances of severe climate events grow, it is 
critical that Congress act on this issue. 
Important mitigation measures like those 
included in the Resilient AMERICA Act save 
lives, property, and taxpayer money, and are 
crucial for reducing environmental disaster 
impacts. Multiple studies have demonstrated 
that for every $1 spent on preventative pre- 
disaster mitigation and resilient construc-
tion, there is a return of as much as $11 in 
savings. Such policies are good for the envi-
ronment and the economy. 
This comprehensive bill contains a host of 
provisions designed to create a significant 
number of new resources for communities to 
better protect themselves ahead of natural 
catastrophes. This includes policies that 
would increase funding for the National Pub-
lic Infrastructure Pre-Disaster Mitigation 
fund (commonly known as Building Resilient 
Infrastructure and Communities, or BRIC, 
Program) created by the Disaster Recovery 
Reform Act to provide grants to local gov-
ernments 
for 
risk-reducing 
mitigation 
projects that make homes and infrastructure 
more resilient in advance of severe climate 
events, as well as those that would harden 
communities by creating new resources and 
incentives for states and localities to adopt 
and enforce modern constructions standards 
and building codes. Importantly, the bill will 
also establish a new pilot program under the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency to 
provide resources to communities and home-
owners for the purpose of retrofitting exist-
ing homes and buildings. 
The BuildStrong Coalition, formed in 2011 
to respond to an increasing number of severe 
disasters, is made up of a diverse group of 
members representing firefighters, emer-
gency responders, emergency managers, in-
surers, engineers, architects, contractors, 
and manufacturers, as well as consumer or-
ganizations, code specialists, and many oth-
ers committed to building a more disaster 
resilient nation. The BuildStrong Coalition 
has been a partner to Congress’s work to in-
vestigate causes of, and devise the solutions 
to, the rising costs and impacts of disasters 
in the United States. 
Our organization represents the broad, bi-
partisan, public-private, and nonprofit stake-
holder support for H.R. 5689. Therefore, the 
BuildStrong Coalition and its allied partners 
again ask that it be brought to House floor 
for consideration under suspension of the 
rules. We look forward to working with you 
and are prepared to offer our institutional 
expertise throughout the process. 
Sincerely, 
NATALIE F. ENCLADE, PH.D., 
Executive Director, BuildStrong Coalition.

Hon. KEVIN MCCARTHY, 
Republican Leader, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI AND LEADER MCCAR-
THY: The undersigned organizations support 
H.R. 5689, the ‘‘Resilient Assistance for Miti-
gation for Environmentally Resilient Infra-
structure and Construction by Americans 
Act’’ or ‘‘Resilient AMERICA Act,’’ and urge 
you to schedule consideration of this legisla-
tion, perhaps under suspension of the rules. 
This legislation, which was reported from 
the Committee on Transportation and Infra-
structure with strong bipartisan support, 
would build on the resilience initiatives con-
tained in the recent bipartisan infrastruc-
ture law and provide additional tools to re-
duce risks posed by a changing climate. 
For every dollar invested in resilience and 
predisaster mitigation, the taxpayer receives 
anywhere from $3.00 to $11.00 in return. Such 
policies are good for the environment and 
the economy. This bill would: 
Increase the annual spending for the new 
National Public Infrastructure Predisaster 
Mitigation fund from up to 6% to up to 15% 
of postdisaster funding. 
Require unspent funds to be recaptured for 
mitigation and resilience projects. 
Extend eligibility for Building Resilient 
Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) pro-
gram grant funding to private non-profit or-
ganizations. 
Provide a 10% set-aside within BRIC to en-
force the adoption of newer building codes. 
Add wildfires and tsunamis, including 
strengthening utilities against wind, ice, and 
wildfire risks as eligible hazards to receive 
funding. 
Establish a 10% set-aside within BRIC to 
fund residential resilience retrofit grants— 
upgrades to strengthen homes resilience and 
comply with consensus-based codes and 
standards, including wind and roof retrofits, 
floodproofing, and constructing saferooms. 
We strongly support H.R. 5689 and urge 
that it be brought to the House floor for ex-
peditious consideration. We stand ready to 
assist you in this process.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4174 
April 5, 2022 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield as 
much time as she may consume to the 
gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. TITUS). 
Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I stand to 
add my voice to the bipartisan chorus 
of support for this bill, including the 
chairman of the Committee on Trans-
portation 
and 
Infrastructure, 
Mr. 
DEFAZIO; Ranking Member GRAVES; 
and the ranking member of my sub-
committee, Mr. WEBSTER, for leading 
on this bill and working so hard to 
bring relief to not only our commu-
nities but individuals who are hit by 
natural disasters and other calamities 
like we saw during COVID. 
Creating a Federal policy that sup-
ports projects focused on mitigating 
risks and bolstering resilience is good 
government. There is no two ways 
about it. 
b 1330 
This legislation features a number of 
key provisions that will make our Na-
tion more resilient: 
One, it increases State funding for 
predisaster mitigation. An ounce of 
prevention is worth a pound of cure. 
It expands assistance for Western 
States, like Nevada, that are at the 
risk of wildfires, which we see coming 
more often, lasting longer, and being 
more intense. 
It also reserves funds to implement 
and enforce the latest building codes 
and standards so when we do build 
back, we build back better, not to the 
status quo ante. 
It empowers families to proactively 
take mitigation measures into their 
own hands, because they may know 
best what they need there at home. 
I strongly support this legislation. 
We must wake up to the realities of cli-
mate change and the increasing inten-
sity and cost of the natural disasters 
that it causes. This legislation will 
help to make our Nation more resil-
ient, and I ask my colleagues to sup-
port it. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman 
from Louisiana (Mr. GRAVES), the 
ranking member of the Subcommittee 
on Aviation. 
Mr. 
GRAVES 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, today we spend an average of 
$100 billion a year responding to disas-
ters; $100 billion. This is a number that 
we can’t afford to continue responding, 
continue reacting to disasters. 
The National Institute of Building 
Sciences has done all sorts of analyses 
looking at the efficacy of making in-
vestments on the front end, Mr. Speak-
er, so we are not in a situation where, 
as in the chairman’s case, we are hav-
ing to go into Oregon, Washington, 
California, or other States out West, 
and pick up the pieces of these commu-
nities destroyed by forest fires; so we 
don’t have to go into these commu-
nities that have been impacted by se-
vere winter storms, communities living 
along rivers that have been inundated 
by floods, or communities on the 
southern coast, the Gulf Coast, or the 
East Coast that have been pummeled 
by hurricanes, such as our home State 
of Louisiana, with just in recent years, 
Hurricanes Laura, Delta, Zeta, Ida; 
some of the most powerful hurricanes 
to ever make landfall in the United 
States. 
The National Institute of Building 
Sciences has found that for every $1 
you invest in natural mitigation solu-
tions, you get up to $13 in savings. By 
adopting more resilient building stand-
ards, building codes, you get up to $11 
in savings. 
Let me say it again, Mr. Speaker. We 
can’t afford to keep doing this. $100 bil-
lion a year. As Ranking Member 
GRAVES noted a few minutes ago, back 
in 2018 we worked on a bipartisan basis 
to, actually, enact the BRIC program, 
to really take the PDM, the Pre-Dis-
aster Mitigation grant program, and 
put it on steroids. Based on the incred-
ible popularity of the program, the 
progress that has been made, this legis-
lation helps to advance it even further. 
By increasing the funds that are avail-
able and, most importantly, by eating 
into that $100 billion we are spending 
in taxpayer funds every year respond-
ing to disasters, reducing that cost, 
Mr. Speaker, and the most important 
thing is the actual impact on the 
ground. 
Those communities out West that are 
dealing with forest fires, helping to 
stop, prevent, and contain those forest 
fires. 
Those communities that are experi-
encing devastation from winter storms, 
helping to protect and make them 
more resilient. 
Communities that are getting repet-
itive floods, making sure those commu-
nities can withstand those floods, and 
those communities that we represent 
in south Louisiana that have had hurri-
cane after hurricane that are truly 
challenging the existence, the liveli-
hood of those communities, helping to 
make sure they can withstand these 
storms, and we can continue to live life 
and enjoy life in coastal communities 
like south Louisiana. 
Lastly, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank 
Chairman DEFAZIO
and Chairwoman 
TITUS, Ranking Member GRAVES, and 
Ranking Member WEBSTER. 
We were able to include two amend-
ments in here. Number one, we worked 
with Congressman DUNN on a very im-
portant amendment. Right now, FEMA 
takes so long to reimburse commu-
nities in the aftermath of a disaster, in 
many cases our parishes, our counties, 
and States have to take out loans, so 
there is an amendment added to this 
bill that mandates that FEMA pay the 
interest costs of the loan. If they are 
going to take forever to reimburse, 
they can at least cover the loan costs, 
the interest costs on the loan. 
The second one is a government effi-
ciency provision. Right now, the Corps 
of Engineers has the most arduous 
process in the Federal Government for 
developing projects, including cost-to- 
benefit ratios, environmental analysis, 
and technical feasibility, yet under 
current 
law, 
Corps 
of 
Engineers’ 
projects are prohibited from receiving 
funds under the BRIC program or PDM. 
This fixes it. If that is the best solu-
tion, if that is the greatest cost sav-
ings, if it is the best efficiency of the 
dollar, my goodness, we shouldn’t be 
stopping it, we should be incentivizing 
it. 
I want to thank all the folks who 
worked together on this legislation. I 
look forward to enactment. I urge 
adoption of the bill. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
additional speakers, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from California (Mr. LAMALFA). 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I appre-
ciate Ranking Member GRAVES yield-
ing me the time on this as well as the 
bipartisan effort with Chairman DEFA-
ZIO and everybody on this important 
legislation. 
The Resilient AMERICA Act really, 
indeed, is like the old adage, a stitch in 
time saves nine. When you can spend 
dollars upfront mitigating, such as this 
bill moves to do, to make a larger pool 
of money available under FEMA to do 
so, it just saves a lot of extra pain and 
suffering. 
Mr. GARRET GRAVES talked about the 
$100 billion year in, year out we are 
spending on disaster relief. It is good 
we do so, but we can nip a lot of this in 
the bud by applying this type of think-
ing toward all types of possible disas-
ters. 
In my home district, you know, last 
year the Dixie fire, right at a million 
acres; the Camp fire before that hit the 
town of Paradise. You all heard about 
that in the news, 85 people lost their 
lives, destroyed 90 percent of the town. 
Now, if we can get ahead of the curve 
on this, whatever is applicable for 
FEMA preassistance, prework, hard-
ening power lines, having buildings 
that can be hardened with the right 
materials for their siding and for their 
roofs. The mitigation we need to be 
doing in forested areas, whatever is ap-
plicable, the more we can do, the better 
off we are. 
We are also looking at flood situa-
tions. I have that, too, with the Sac-
ramento River and Feather River in 
my area, as well as lesser areas, too, in 
size. Instead of fixing a levee on New 
Year’s Eve in the middle of the night 
on soggy levees, doing that work ahead 
of time, upgrading them makes it safer 
for the workers, safer for the commu-
nity, and is much less expensive. 
This is, indeed, a great success for us 
in this time, and there is sometimes 
difficulty here in Congress to have leg-
islation like this with strong bipar-
tisan support that can help everybody. 
I am proud of the work this committee 
has been able to do. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume to close.

April 5, 2022 
Mr. Speaker, in closing, the Resilient 
AMERICA Act does support the com-
munities by investing in premitigation 
efforts, and these efforts are going to 
save lives. It is going to save taxpayer 
dollars by lowering costs of future dis-
asters. It is going to do so many things. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this 
important piece of legislation. I again 
want to thank the chairman for work-
ing with us on this. I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume to 
close. 
We have just heard very telling testi-
mony from the gentleman from Lou-
isiana (Mr. GRAVES) about the issues 
with the frequent problems they have 
had with hurricanes down there, and 
then the gentleman from California 
(Mr. LAMALFA) talking about wildfires, 
which have become more and more in-
tense and widespread and persistent in 
the West. 
On both sides of the aisle, I think al-
most any Member who has had a dis-
aster, a natural disaster in their dis-
trict, can attest to the fact that if his 
or her community had been better pre-
pared, if they had taken steps toward 
resilience, if the Federal Government 
had given them that guidance and per-
haps some funding incentives to put in 
place those mitigation measures, that 
lives would have been saved, property 
would have been saved, and ultimately 
the Federal taxpayers would save a lot 
of money. 
This 
legislation 
has 
tremendous 
merit, and I urge my colleagues to sup-
port 
it 
unanimously; 
although, 
of 
course, we will have someone on that 
side of the aisle who will call for a vote 
even though they might even vote for 
it. Hopefully, the Senate, in its total 
dysfunction, will look favorably upon 
this legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DEFA-
ZIO) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, H.R. 5689, as amend-
ed. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. HARRIS. Mr. Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

SMALL PROJECT EFFICIENT AND 
EFFECTIVE 
DISASTER 
RECOV-
ERY ACT 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 5641) to amend the Robert T. 
Stafford Disaster Relief and Emer-
gency Assistance Act to increase the 
threshold for eligibility for assistance 
under sections 403, 406, 407, and 502 of 
such Act, and for other purposes, as 
amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 5641 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Small 
Project Efficient and Effective Disaster Re-
covery Act’’ or the ‘‘SPEED Recovery Act’’. 
SEC. 2. SIMPLIFIED PROCEDURE. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 422 of the Robert 
T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency 
Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5189) is amended— 
(1) in subsection (a) by striking ‘‘$35,000’’ 
each 
place 
it 
appears 
and 
inserting 
‘‘$1,000,000’’; and 
(2) in subsection (b)(3)— 
(A) in the heading by inserting ‘‘AND RE-
PORT’’ after ‘‘REVIEW’’; and 
(B) by inserting ‘‘and submit to the Com-
mittee on Transportation and Infrastructure 
of the House of Representatives and the 
Committee on Homeland Security and Gov-
ernmental Affairs of the Senate a report re-
garding such review, including any rec-
ommendations developed pursuant to such 
review’’ after ‘‘under this section’’. 
(b) APPLICABILITY.—The amendments made 
by subsection (a) shall apply with respect to 
any amounts appropriated after the date of 
enactment of this Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from Or-
egon (Mr. DEFAZIO) and the gentleman 
from Missouri (Mr. GRAVES) each will 
control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Oregon. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 5641, 
as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Oregon? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
5641, the SPEED Recovery Act. This 
bill will expedite the approval process 
for FEMA’s small projects within the 
public assistance program. 
The public assistance process is often 
slow and impeded by bureaucratic red 
tape, so FEMA offers a simplified ap-
proval procedure for small projects 
that cost $139,000 or less. When this 
program was implemented over 40 
years ago, it was intended to capture 95 
percent of public assistance project 
worksheets. There has been a little in-
flation since then. 
Today, as we noted earlier, many dis-
asters are more widespread and more 
expensive. Today only 75 percent of 
projects are being captured by the 
$139,000 threshold. This legislation will 
ensure that, once again, 95 percent of 
project worksheets are eligible for ex-
pedited review by raising the quali-
fying project threshold to $1 million. 
By updating the threshold for what 
qualifies as a small project, barriers to 
relief and recovery will be alleviated 
and so will the time it takes commu-
nities to get back on their feet post- 
disaster, and it will allow the limited 
staff at FEMA to turn their attention 
to more difficult, expensive, and prob-
lematic programs. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues 
to join with me and support this legis-
lation. I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to sponsor 
H.R. 5641, the SPEED Recovery Act. It 
is a bipartisan bill that cuts red tape 
and helps expedite disaster recovery ef-
forts, especially in small and rural 
areas that we have throughout the 
country. 
This legislation updates the thresh-
old of what FEMA considers a small 
project. It updates it to $1 million 
under the Stafford Act; $1 million 
under the Stafford Act. This is the first 
statutory adjustment under the Staf-
ford Act for inflation and rising repair 
costs in nearly three decades. 
Historically, small projects have ac-
counted for about 95 percent of all the 
recovery projects, but the prolonged 
failure to increase the cost threshold 
now means that 25 percent of these 
projects no longer qualify as small 
projects. That puts a huge burden on 
small rural communities that simply 
don’t have the same kind of resources 
to deal with the bureaucracy at FEMA. 
For places like Craig, Missouri, or 
Brunswick, Missouri, both of which got 
hammered by the flood of 2019, it has 
meant more delays and headaches just 
trying to get the help that they need to 
recover and to rebuild. 
Updating the small project threshold 
is going to allow these communities to 
have more control over their disaster 
recovery efforts and to allow FEMA to 
focus more of their time and resources 
on larger and much more complex 
projects, which represent 90 percent of 
all disaster costs. 
After hearing directly from the com-
munities in my district about the pa-
perwork burdens and the increasing de-
nials over technicalities, my hope is 
that this commonsense adjustment to 
the small project threshold is going to 
improve the process and speed up re-
coveries for many, many of our com-
munities. We have also received a lot 
of support for this bill from emergency 
managers themselves. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
a joint letter of support from the Na-
tional Emergency Management Asso-
ciation, the Big City Emergency Man-
agers, and the International Associa-
tion of Emergency Managers.

resentative Graves of Missouri to introduce 
the Small Project Efficient and Effective 
Disaster (SPEED) Recovery Act. 
When managing a disaster under the Staf-
ford Act with assistance through the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), 
projects falling below a certain threshold are 
considered ‘‘small.’’ While this threshold is 
adjusted annually for inflation, the Fiscal 
Year 2020 level was a mere $131,000. These 
small projects require less administrative 
burden at the local, state, and federal levels 
which means their approval and execution 
time is significantly faster than larger 
projects. The SPEED Recovery Act will raise 
this threshold to $1,000,000, thereby signifi-
cantly increasing the number of projects 
that can be expedited during the recovery to 
a disaster. 
This type of modernization to disaster re-
sponse and recovery programs will allow us 
as emergency managers to more swiftly 
move projects for disaster survivors and ex-
pedite the road toward recovery. As we work 
individually and with one another to build 
resilience nationwide, tools such as the 
SPEED Recovery Act will simplify and 
streamline FEMA programs when survivors 
need them most. 
We thank Representative Graves for his 
foresight on this issue and appreciate your 
leadership in ensuring the SPEED Recovery 
Act sees action in your subcommittee and 
throughout the legislative process. Please

Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I urge support of this legislation, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
b 1345 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as she may consume to the 
gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. TITUS), 
the chair of the subcommittee. 
Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
chairman for yielding time. 
The SPEED Recovery Act will expe-
dite the approval process for FEMA’s 
small projects within the Public As-
sistance Program, or PA program. 
I am proud to join Chairman DEFA-
ZIO, Ranking Member GRAVES, and my 
subcommittee ranking member, Mr. 
WEBSTER, in bringing this bill forward. 
PA helps communities remove debris, 
implement emergency protective serv-
ices, and repair damage to public build-
ings and infrastructure. 
The public assistance approval proc-
ess can be lengthy and complicated, 
and that is why, as you have heard, the 
1988 Stafford Act ordered FEMA to 
simplify 
the 
procedure 
for 
small 
projects that might not have the ca-
pacity or resources to deal with the red 
tape and complicated grant process. 
The cost for completing a small 
project, however, is not the same as it 
was in 1988 when this was first estab-
lished. Stakeholders have reported to 
Congress, and I heard during a hearing 
of my subcommittee back in October, 
that the small projects the program 
was intended to cover are now unquali-
fied. This legislation will raise the 
qualifying project threshold, and this 
updated 
threshold 
will 
speed 
the 
postdisaster recovery process and help 
us to make our communities get back 
on their feet. 
I support this. You heard it; that it is 
commonsense legislation. I ask my col-
leagues to do the same, use some com-
mon sense and vote to support this. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 4 minutes to the gentle-
woman 
from 
Puerto 
Rico 
(Miss 
GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N). 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank Ranking Member GRAVES 
for yielding time. 
Today, I rise in support of H.R. 5641, 
the SPEED Recovery Act, which is bi-
partisan 
legislation 
introduced 
by 
Ranking Member GRAVES with the sup-
port 
of 
Chairman 
DEFAZIO, 
Chair 
TITUS, and Ranking Member WEBSTER. 
This bill aims toward updating dis-
aster recovery procedures. I can talk 
about that at length. 
During Puerto Rico’s recovery from 
Hurricane Maria, many municipalities 
on the island faced the situation where, 
because of the rising costs of materials 
and labor, relatively simple projects 
such as a repair to a street or a minor 
building exceeded the current thresh-
old for what is defined as a small 
project. 
That 
threshold 
today 
is 
around 
$123,000, which really only covers some 
minor work. This means that a lot of 
the work for which municipalities may 
have had the resources to cover their 
non-Federal share to start and finish 
promptly instead had to go through the 
full procedural chain for major projects 
to qualify for FEMA reimbursement. 
Those 
processes 
themselves 
have 
taken longer than expected. It took al-
most 4 years in the case of Puerto Rico 
after the 2017 hurricanes for those mu-
nicipalities, FEMA, and the Puerto 
Rico Recovery Office to be able to 
agree just on the measures to make the 
processes faster. 
That is years in which the people 
wondered when they were going to see 
the promised reconstruction. When a 
community does not see at least small 
things being taken care of, that weak-
ens our communities and promotes dis-
placement. 
Increasing the threshold to $1 mil-
lion, including adjustments for infla-
tion, 
would 
allow 
more 
recovery 
projects to proceed under simplified 
procedures, reduce administrative bur-
dens, and provide more certainty for 
all. This is a major step, and that is 
the reason I am supporting this bill. 
Most disaster claims are on a small, 
local scale where there is no need to 
navigate the same procedures over 
larger, more complex projects and tie 
up the resources of FEMA and other 
agencies just looking at those papers. 
Although FEMA and other agencies 
have been open to using the adminis-
trative flexibility the law provides, in 
many real-world incidents, that is not 
enough. 
These updates make the Stafford Act 
language match the realities of con-
struction costs in our States, terri-
tories, and communities, which FEMA 
and the local authorities can then use 
in order to facilitate approval of the 
small projects. 
Believe me, this is the biggest burden 
we have in the case of Puerto Rico. 
Four years after the hurricanes, we are 
still dealing with this. 
Many heads of agencies, Cabinet 
members, and administrative positions 
from FEMA and the rest of the Federal 
agencies still travel to the island to see 
how they can do this faster, and it is 
not just red tape. It is amending this 
kind of language that will provide for 
those projects to be sped up. 
I support this commonsense bipar-
tisan legislation and urge all Members 
to support it, and I thank the ranking 
member for doing this. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from California (Mr. LAMALFA). 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. 
GRAVES) for the time. 
Here we have again another triumph 
of legislation coming together that can 
be beneficial at no great new cost to 
the process. 
The Stafford Act has needed updat-
ing, certain aspects, for a long time. 
When you look at some of the difficul-
ties when you are in a postdisaster sit-
uation of having to deal with some ar-
cane legislation and laws, it just makes 
much more suffering than is necessary 
for people who have been victims, in 
my case, from many wildfires in north-
ern California. 
In adhering to the approximate 95 
percent of projects being under the new 
threshold, that still keeps with what 
had been set in place way back in 1988. 
H.R. 5641 is a triumph in that. 
Also, with it at 10 percent of total 
funding for disasters, we are not blow-
ing the budget on this either. 
It is, indeed, very important because 
when you are talking about my rural 
district or rural America, you don’t 
have the wherewithal to be hassling 
your way through some of these proc-
esses in order to get things going again 
postdisaster. 
In my area, for example, towns like 
Whiskeytown, 
Happy 
Camp, 
Hornbrook, 
Concow, 
Yankee 
Hill, 
Magalia, Paradise, Doyle, Canyondam,

Greenville, Indian Falls, and others I 
couldn’t possibly all list here today, 
they are all going to be beneficiaries 
and appreciative of this effort because 
they don’t have the ability, small 
counties 
like 
Plumas 
County 
and 
Lassen County, to have to deal with 
some of the restrictions previously 
under the Stafford Act. 
This would be a big win for anybody 
facing disaster, a small town, or even 
large, around this country. This is an-
other win for us legislatively, and I ap-
preciate the effort of the committee. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5641, the SPEED 
Recovery Act, is a commonsense, bi-
partisan bill that is going to help many 
small and rural communities respond 
to and recover from disasters with less 
delay and much less bureaucracy. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this 
very important piece of legislation. I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
This is a needed adjustment in the 
cap, very long overdue. It will expedite 
assistance to individuals, but it also 
will free up FEMA staff for more mean-
ingful chores and work on ongoing and 
future disasters, mitigation, recovery, 
et cetera. 
It has tremendous merit, and I urge 
that all of my colleagues support this 
legislation. 
It will pass by voice vote, and then 
someone on that side will jump up and 
call for a recorded vote because that is 
why they think they are supposed to be 
here. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The

UPHOLDING THE FOUNDING DEMO-
CRATIC 
PRINCIPLES 
OF 
THE 
NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY OR-
GANIZATION AND ESTABLISHING 
A CENTER FOR DEMOCRATIC RE-
SILIENCE 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and agree to the 
resolution (H. Res. 831) calling on the 
United States Government to uphold 
the founding democratic principles of 
the North Atlantic Treaty Organiza-
tion and establish a Center for Demo-
cratic Resilience within the head-
quarters of the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the resolu-
tion. 
The text of the resolution is as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 831 
Whereas the North Atlantic Treaty Organi-
zation (NATO) is the world’s preeminent po-
litical and military alliance committed to 
democracy and the collective defense of its 
members; 
Whereas the preamble of NATO’s founding 
North Atlantic Treaty, signed in Wash-
ington, DC, on April 4, 1949, declares the alli-
ance is ‘‘founded on the principles of democ-
racy, individual liberty, and the rule of law’’; 
Whereas democracies across the alliance 
face external threats from authoritarian re-
gimes such as Russia and China and internal 
threats from proponents of illiberalism; 
Whereas Russia launched a full-scale inva-
sion of sovereign and democratic Ukraine on 
February 24, 2022, placing it on the frontlines 
in the contest between democratic values 
and autocracy; 
Whereas in his address to Congress, Presi-
dent Zelensky remarked ‘‘Right now, the 
destiny of our country is being decided. The 
destiny of our people, whether Ukrainians 
will be free, whether they will be able to pre-
serve their democracy.’’; 
Whereas Vladimir Putin’s unprovoked full- 
scale invasion of Ukraine has united the 
NATO alliance; 
Whereas there is a broad agreement within 
the alliance of the need to strengthen the de-
mocracies of NATO members, partners, and 
aspirant countries; 
Whereas, in April 2020, NATO Secretary 
General Jens Stoltenberg appointed an inde-
pendent Reflection Group tasked with sup-
porting a forward-looking reflection process 
meant to strengthen the political dimension 
of the alliance; 
Whereas the Reflection Group’s report, 
‘‘NATO 2030: United for a New Era’’, included 
analyses and recommendations for the alli-
ance to address ‘‘ ‘democratic recession,’ the 
global erosion of democratic norms, and the 
rise of authoritarianism’’, including— 
(1) ‘‘A shared democratic identity is what 
distinguishes the Alliance from the principal 
threats and challenges it faces.’’; 
(2) ‘‘NATO should reassert its core identity 
as an Alliance rooted in the principles of de-
mocracy.’’; 
(3) ‘‘Any commitment to strengthening 
NATO’s political cohesion therefore has to 
be orientated toward those shared values and 
ideals, grounded in democracy, rule of law 
and individual liberty.’’; and 
(4) recommending the establishment of a 
Center of Excellence for Democratic Resil-
ience in order to strengthen NATO democ-
racies against external threats; 
Whereas 
the 
Brussels 
Summit 
Communique´ issued by the Heads of State 
and Government participating in the meet-
ing of the North Atlantic Council in Brussels 
on June 14, 2021, stated— 
(1) ‘‘NATO is the strongest and most suc-
cessful Alliance in history. It guarantees the 
security of our territory and our one billion 
citizens, our freedom, and the values we 
share, including individual liberty, human 
rights, democracy, and the rule of law.’’; 
(2) ‘‘State and non-state actors challenge 
the rules-based international order and seek 
to undermine democracy across the globe.’’; 
and 
(3) ‘‘We reaffirm the Alliance’s shared 
democratic principles as well as our commit-
ment to the spirit and the letter of the North 
Atlantic Treaty.’’; 
Whereas in Brussels the Allies also com-
mitted to updating NATO’s Strategic Con-
cept; 
Whereas NATO Secretary General Jens 
Stoltenberg has reiterated that one of the 
primary purposes of updating the Strategic 
Concept must be a recommitment to the 
founding values of the alliance; 
Whereas the NATO Parliamentary Assem-
bly supports a new Strategic Concept that 
reaffirms that the support and strengthening 
of democratic institutions is foundational to 
the collective security of Allies; 
Whereas Russia’s full-scale invasion of sov-
ereign and democratic Ukraine underscores 
the importance of placing shared democratic 
values at the heart of NATO’s Strategic Con-
cept; and 
Whereas the NATO Parliamentary Assem-
bly has endorsed and advanced a proposal to 
establish a NATO Center for Democratic Re-
silience within NATO headquarters for the 
purposes of monitoring and identifying chal-
lenges to democracy, human rights, and the 
rule of law and facilitating democracy and 
governance assistance to member, partner, 
and aspirant states, when requested: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives— 
(1) reaffirms its unequivocal support for 
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
(NATO) as an alliance founded on democratic 
principles; 
(2) urges NATO to continue to provide un-
wavering support to the people of Ukraine as 
they fight for their sovereignty, territorial 
integrity, and a democratic future; 
(3) calls on the President to use the voice 
and vote of the United States to adopt a new 
Strategic Concept for NATO that is clear 
about its support for shared democratic val-
ues and committed to enhancing NATO’s ca-
pacity to strengthen democratic institutions 
within NATO member, partner, and aspirant 
countries; and 
(4) calls on the President to use the voice 
and vote of the United States to establish a 
Center for Democratic Resilience within 
NATO headquarters. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY) and the gen-
tleman from Ohio (Mr. TURNER) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Virginia. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H. Res. 
831, as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Virginia? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman GREG 
MEEKS
and Ranking Member MIKE 
MCCAUL for helping bring this bipar-
tisan resolution to the floor today. 
I also want to thank my partner in so 
much of this enterprise with respect to 
NATO and the NATO Parliamentary 
Assembly, the gentleman from Ohio

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4178 
April 5, 2022 
United States Government to uphold 
the founding democratic principles of 
NATO and establish a Center for Demo-
cratic Resilience within NATO itself. 
NATO’s founding document, signed 
here in Washington, D.C., on April 4, 
1949, this very week, is clear: NATO is 
an alliance of democracies. 
The preamble to the treaty notes the 
determination of allies ‘‘to safeguard 
the freedom, common heritage, and 
civilization of their peoples, founded on 
the principles of democracy, individual 
liberty, and the rule of law.’’ 
The alliance’s commitment to shared 
democratic 
values 
is 
what 
distin-
guishes NATO from any other military 
alliance. Without it, NATO is just an-
other military bloc that does not like 
Russia. 
This 
commitment 
cannot 
remain 
purely aspirational or rhetorical. It 
must be operationalized. That is why 
we believe we need formal architecture 
within NATO dedicated to the pro-
motion and advocacy of democracy. 
There are divisions and units within 
NATO dedicated to collective defense, 
terrorism, 
interoperability, 
hybrid 
warfare, cyber, climate change, and a 
number of other security challenges. 
But after 72 years, there is not even a 
broom closet at NATO headquarters 
dedicated to the promotion of demo-
cratic institution-building within the 
alliance itself or with respect to the 
members. 
b 1400 
The effort to establish a NATO Cen-
ter for Democratic Resilience is an 
idea first proposed in 2019 as part of a 
white paper this Member of Congress 
wrote on ‘‘NATO at 70.’’ 
As the current president of the NATO 
Parliamentary Assembly, I have taken 
that recommendation and made the 
strengthening 
of 
NATO’s 
founding 
democratic values our number one pri-
ority. 
The assembly has, in turn, endorsed 
this idea, the establishment of a Center 
for Democratic Resilience and made it 
a central component of the assembly’s 
pro-democracy agenda within NATO. 
And we were pleased to see the pro-
posal included in the Group of Experts’ 
report commissioned by the NATO Sec-
retary General as we prepare for updat-
ing the strategic concept. 
The U.S. delegation to the NATO PA, 
which includes Chairman MEEKS and 
Representatives MIKE TURNER of Ohio, 
LINDA SA´ NCHEZ, BRETT GUTHRIE, RICK 
LARSEN, NEAL DUNN, BRENDAN BOYLE, 
JACK
BERGMAN, DINA
TITUS, AUSTIN 
SCOTT, and Filemon Vela, has jointly 
written to the Secretary of State, 
Antony Blinken, and our Secretary of 
Defense, Lloyd Austin, encouraging the 
Biden administration to work with our 
NATO allies to operationalize support 
for our shared democratic principles 
and to establish this Center for Demo-
cratic Resilience. 
And to the credit of the Biden admin-
istration and the U.S. Ambassador to 
NATO, Julie Smith, they have followed 
up on our recommendation. 
When we met with the North Atlan-
tic Council in February in Brussels, 
Ambassador Smith made a forceful 
case for the establishment of the cen-
ter, and we were encouraged to see sev-
eral NATO Ambassadors join her in 
taking up the mantle and arguing in 
favor of the proposal. 
Today, the values upon which the al-
liance have been founded are being 
challenged by external enemies of de-
mocracy, all too tragically being wit-
nessed in the Ukraine. 
These forces aim to undermine the 
faith in and political support for our 
common democracies and the alliance 
itself. 
The strongest weapon we possess to 
counter 
effectively 
Putin 
or 
Xi’s 
authoritarianism is a vibrant, robust, 
and immutable expression of the lib-
eral democratic values that bind us. 
Putin’s renewed, full-scale aggression 
against Ukraine is a blatant attack on 
the most basic principles underlying 
the international order since the end of 
World War II, principles which Moscow 
has freely signed on to but ignored. 
President 
Putin 
seeks 
to 
crush 
Ukraine’s democracy, intimidate other 
countries where the embers of demo-
cratic ambition burn, and, by implica-
tion, undermine all democracies every-
where. 
We must respond by uniting around 
and strengthening our commitment to 
our shared democratic values and the 
rules-based order. The NATO treaty is 
clear: We are an alliance of democ-
racies. 
As NATO Secretary General Jens 
Stoltenberg said during the recent 
ministerial in Riga, Latvia: ‘‘NATO 
was created to defend democracy, free-
dom, and the rule of law. These values 
define who we are. They are not op-
tional.’’ 
And 
as 
President 
Zelenskyy 
of 
Ukraine said during his recent address 
to this body, to the Congress: ‘‘Right 
now, the destiny of our country’’— 
Ukraine—‘‘is being decided. The des-
tiny of our people, whether Ukrainians 
will be free, whether they will be able 
to preserve their democracy.’’ 
NATO stands for the preservation of 
that democracy. And we believe the 
center called for in this resolution 
must be part of NATO’s work to build 
a bulwark against authoritarianism 
and democratic backsliding as we pro-
ceed. 
I thank the bipartisan group of mem-
bers of the U.S. delegation to NATO PA 
for their support as they joined us in 
this effort, and I urge my colleagues to 
vote in favor of this strong bipartisan 
resolution. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. TURNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
NATO is the most successful military 
alliance in history. 
Our shared democratic values are a 
critical piece of that success. We are 
reminded of the importance of this alli-
ance daily as Putin continues his inhu-
mane assault on innocent civilians in 
Ukraine. 
Together, with our NATO allies and 
partners, we are unified in a strategic 
approach to counter our adversaries. 
Ukraine is not alone on the front 
lines of the global battle between de-
mocracy and authoritarianism. The 
United States and our NATO allies are 
supporting Ukraine. 
Vladimir Putin’s unprovoked and un-
justified full-scale invasion of Ukraine 
has unified the NATO alliance. 
Most recently, the world watched in 
horror as images from Bucha have sur-
faced; mass graves and bodies strewn 
throughout the street. 
NATO must be resolute in its efforts 
to continue its support for Ukraine. 
This resolution introduced by Con-
gressman CONNOLLY and myself will af-
firm the democratic values of NATO 
and establish a Center for Democratic 
Resilience. 
Having served as the President of 
NATO PA, I support the fundamental 
role 
this 
organization 
plays 
in 
strengthening and defending democ-
racies worldwide. I also congratulate 
my colleague for his efforts in support 
of this global organization, Congress-
man CONNOLLY, who currently serves as 
the President of NATO PA, has rep-
resented the United States very well 
there, and brings forth a resolution 
that is of great importance to the 
founding issues and certainly the sub-
stance of NATO. 
The resolution we are considering 
today advances this goal by reaffirm-
ing that NATO is an alliance founded 
on democratic principles and calling on 
the U.S. to support the establishment 
of this center within NATO head-
quarters. 
This center would and could monitor 
challenges and threats to democracy, 
natural rights, and the rule of law 
among member nations. Partnering 
with democracy promotion organiza-
tions, the center will assist member 
states and aspiring member states to 
preserve and foster democracy among 
their ranks. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues 
to join me today in support of this res-
olution, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, 
I 
thank my good friend from Ohio for his 
leadership. He is the former President 
of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, 
as well, and he has provided unwaver-
ing support for America’s leadership in 
this alliance and for the alliance itself. 
And he is a highly respected figure on 
both sides of the Atlantic, and I thank 
him for his leadership. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
BRENDAN F. BOYLE). 
Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Mr. Speaker, I thank my col-
leagues, both of whom have served as 
not only Members of this House and 
members of the parliamentary assem-
bly, but both have led that body as 
president emeritus and our current 
president, Mr. CONNOLLY.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4179 
April 5, 2022 
I was there in Brussels with my col-
leagues just a month ago in the days 
immediately 
preceding 
Vladimir 
Putin’s brutal Russian invasion of 
Ukraine. And there our delegation, on 
a bipartisan basis, made the case for 
this resolution, made the case for why 
such a center is needed now more than 
ever. 
We are seeing an attack not only on 
the people of Ukraine, but on our 
democratic values. They are at stake 
in a way today that they haven’t been 
since the fall of the Berlin Wall. And in 
some sense, they haven’t been under 
this sort of attack since 1945. 
I am proud to be a part, as Mr. CON-
NOLLY mentioned, of our NATO Par-
liamentary Assembly. We will be going 
this weekend to another such NATO 
PA meeting. 
This association, this alliance is 
needed now more than ever. I am so 
proud to see this country redouble its 
commitment to the alliance, but as Mr. 
CONNOLLY
has said time and time 
again, this cannot just be an alliance 
built on our shared interest, it must be 
an alliance based on our shared values. 
So I strongly support this resolution, 
and I urge its unanimous bipartisan 
adoption. 
Mr. TURNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Puerto Rico (Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N). 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank my good friend and former 
president of the NATO Parliamentary 
Assembly, MIKE TURNER, for yielding. 
Today, I am here as a proud cospon-
sor of H. Res. 831. I stand alongside our 
esteemed colleagues, the president of 
the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, 
Congressman GERRY
CONNOLLY, and 
past president, Congressman MIKE TUR-
NER, to support the establishment of a 
Center of Democratic Resilience within 
NATO. 
Just yesterday, we celebrated 73 
years since the formation of NATO, an 
alliance that has assured mutual de-
fense to one another. Beyond our stra-
tegic military alliances, we also share 
a commitment to our democratic prin-
ciples. And I think that is the most im-
portant thing about this resolution. 
Establishing an entity designed to 
promote, protect and strengthen demo-
cratic institutions will further advance 
the collective security of our allies and 
NATO’s mission of promoting freedom, 
human 
rights, 
democracy, 
and 
of 
course, the rule of law. 
Mr. Speaker, I have had the honor to 
serve as a parliamentary member twice 
during my time in Congress, and both 
have given me the opportunity to wit-
ness NATO’s defining trait, which is 
unity. 
Unity does not simply mean pre-
senting a united front. It means being 
united in spirit and purpose. 
Today, as Russia wages war on 
NATO’s borders, that unity of purpose 
is more important than ever. It is also 
clear that Ukraine shares in our spirit 
and purpose as well. 
That is why this resolution urges 
NATO to continue to provide unwaver-
ing support to the people of Ukraine as 
they fight for their sovereignty, terri-
torial integrity, and a democratic fu-
ture. 
We cannot, and we must not, allow 
Russia to dictate the terms of a sov-
ereign nation’s policy. I continue to 
support Ukraine to be afforded the op-
portunity to join our defensive alli-
ance. I think it is clear that the past 
attempts to placate through indefinite 
delays for Georgia and Ukraine have 
ended in tragedy. 
Tragedy struck Georgia in 2008, and 
Ukraine again in 2014 and 2020, and are 
evidence of how effective denying them 
membership to NATO is for protecting 
peace. 
Evidence, especially in Bucha, indi-
cates sanctioned mass killings, the 
rape and murder of small children, and 
targeting of civilian shelters housing 
infants and the elderly. All while the 
Russian leadership talks of a country 
that doesn’t exist. 
Together, NATO must continue to 
present a united front. We must in-
crease, of course, our aid to Ukraine, 
and we must ensure that countries 
make decisions to enter alliances with-
out foreign interference. And this is 
the reason this resolution is so impor-
tant, because of our principles and our 
united purpose. We must never cede an 
inch of our freedom or our values. I 
know that united, we can do this. 
Mr. TURNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. HARRIS). 
Mr. HARRIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise with 
concern about some of the wording in 
the preamble. I think this is the reason 
why we should actually go through the 
normal process, not a suspension proc-
ess for something as critical as this 
resolution. 
Clearly, I have no argument against 
the threat that Russia has against de-
mocracies in Europe. My problem is 
with page 2, line 3: ‘‘. . . internal 
threats 
from 
proponents 
of 
illiberalism.’’ That is a progressive, 
leftwing dog whistle for Poland and 
Hungary. Why in the world, as Russia 
is attacking Ukraine, and Poland is the 
center for bringing our military assist-
ance into Ukraine, why in the world in 
a preamble would we appear to attack 
one of our NATO allies? 
It is unnecessary. It is unwise. 
Again, having a Center for Demo-
cratic Resilience, I don’t have an argu-
ment with that. My argument is with 
the preamble that clearly includes in-
flammatory language toward two of 
our best allies in NATO: Poland and 
Hungary. 
Mr. TURNER. Mr. Speaker, I would 
inform Congressman HARRIS, the Am-
bassador to NATO from Hungary open-
ly supports this center, and I know Po-
land does also. 
This is something that is important 
overall for NATO, and it does have the 
support of both of those nations, and 
there is no intention other than to sup-
port democracy in this. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, all I 
can say is having authored this lan-
guage, I don’t know what the gen-
tleman from Maryland (Mr. HARRIS) is 
referring to. 
When we talk about illiberal forces 
within the NATO alliance, it is all-in-
clusive. The New York Times did an ex-
tensive podcast series on illiberal, 
rightwing groups within Germany’s po-
lice and military; not Hungary, not Po-
land: Germany. 
Many of our colleagues, when we 
meet in NATO Parliamentary Assem-
bly meetings, express concern about 
their own internal challenges to their 
own democratic institutions. 
b 1415 
And it is simply false that we are 
somehow 
selecting 
any 
particular 
country. This is a concern expressed by 
virtually all; and we recognize that we 
have got work to do in showing up and 
building democratic institutions, even 
within the alliance; that we can’t take 
it for granted. 
What we say is democracy is resil-
ient, but it can also be fragile; and that 
is what this reference is about, and 
would be recognized by virtually every 
NATO member as such. 
So while I certainly can understand 
Mr. HARRIS wanting to express a con-
cern, I would hope we have debunked it 
because it is nowhere even close to 
being what he has characterized. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. TURNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I think this is a really important res-
olution. It is also timely because, as 
Mr. BOYLE indicated, we have our next 
NATO Parliamentary Assembly meet-
ing in Athens this weekend; and if we 
are going to have input to the strategic 
concept of NATO, which is being re-
vised and will be adopted next month, 
in May, we have got to have this in 
hand as an expression, a bipartisan ex-
pression of the collective concern and 
commitment of this body. 
I am honored by the fact that this is 
bipartisan. It passed the House Foreign 
Affairs 
Committee 
overwhelmingly, 
and I would hope that later today we 
have a strong bipartisan vote on this 
resolution so we can bring it to our de-
liberations in Athens and in Madrid in 
the next 2 months. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CON-
NOLLY) that the House suspend the 
rules and agree to the resolution, H. 
Res. 831, as amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. HARRIS. Mr. Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered.

Seaway. This 370-mile-long commercial 
channel runs from the Great Lakes, 
America’s fourth seacoast, to the At-
lantic Ocean, and then connects our 
ports with markets around the world. 
With 40 million tons of industrial and 
agricultural cargo traversing the sea-
way each year, it is time to appoint an 
administrator, and especially in a time 
of war. We could be backfilling cargoes 
to Europe right now. 
It is time to fill this vital position, 
and I look forward to a nominee who 
understands the needs of our region 
and is ready to partner with the com-
munities, workers, and businesses of 
America’s industrial and agricultural 
heartland.

CELEBRATING STEWART CANDY 
COMPANY’S CENTENNIAL 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to celebrate the Stew-
art Candy Company’s 100th anniver-
sary. 
Founded in 1922 by James Ernest 
Stewart in Waycross, Georgia, the 
Stewart Candy Company has grown 
into a multimillion-dollar candy busi-
ness that distributes their products na-
tionwide. 
From its humble beginnings, when 
Ernest would package his candies in 
cigar boxes and deliver them in his 
Model T, to a massive company that 
sells candies with the click of a button, 
100 years is truly worth celebrating. 
After Ernest’s son, James, graduated 
from the University of Georgia and 
served 3 years in the United States 
Army, he came home to work at the 
family business. 
James, better known as Papa, molded 
and fashioned Stewart Candies into a 
modernized business production fit for 
the next generation of the Stewart 
family. Four of Papa’s six children 
came to work for the company and or-
ganized the Stewart Distribution com-
pany, a new division of the candy com-
pany. 
Jump to today, and Stewart Candy 
Company is still making their pure 
sugar soft peppermints in many dif-
ferent flavors, such as banana pudding, 
key lime, and cinnamon. 
The company has gone from just 3 
employees to 240 employees and works 
every day to spread the joy of their 
candies to every American.

RECOGNIZING NATIONAL LIBRARY 
WEEK 
(Ms. BROWN of Ohio asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize National Li-
brary Week. 
Libraries are the cornerstone of our 
communities. They provide access to 
knowledge and services. They expose us 
to ideas and information that help us 
better 
understand 
ourselves, 
each 
other, and the world around us. They 
connect our children to literature, 
media, and tutoring services. During 
the pandemic, they have played a crit-
ical role in ensuring access to the 
internet and technology. 
I am so grateful for the exceptional 
libraries in my district, from the Cuya-
hoga County Public Library and the 
Cleveland Public Library to the Akron- 
Summit County Public Library, and all 
the libraries in between. I am grateful 
for their dedicated library workers who 
support northeast Ohioans from all 
walks of life. 
This National Library Week, I thank 
our libraries and librarians for all they 
do to support an informed, connected 
community. I urge my colleagues to 
support robust funding for these cen-
ters of learning and opportunity.

JUDGE JACKSON WILL BE A RUB-
BER STAMP FOR BIDEN AGENDA 
(Mr. ROSE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, since before 
taking office, President Biden and his 
far-left base have openly expressed 
their interest in expanding the Su-
preme Court to create a super-legisla-
ture filled with unelected, liberal Jus-
tices determined to do the job of Con-
gress and legislate from the bench. 
After watching the nomination pro-
ceedings, I have no doubt that Judge 
Jackson will be exactly that, a rubber 
stamp for President Biden’s agenda, 
not an impartial Justice who inter-
prets the Constitution how it is writ-
ten. 
I believe Judge Jackson’s repeated 
leniency in Federal sentencing cases 
toward prisoners in Guantanamo Bay, 
child 
sex 
offenders, 
and 
convicted 
criminal drug traffickers gives us a 
window into her activist judicial phi-
losophy and renders her unsuitable to

HONORING THE LIFE OF ISIDORE 
‘‘TEDDY’’ BERTONE 
(Ms. MALLIOTAKIS asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. MALLIOTAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to tell the Nation about the serv-
ice of a World War II veteran, someone 
who became a friend of mine, Isidore 
Bertone, who on Staten Island we know 
as Teddy. 
He was born on September 13, 1925, in 
Castiglione, a small village in Sicily. 
Teddy came to the United States with 
his mother in 1937 to escape the fascist 
regime of Mussolini, who was recruit-
ing teenagers into service. 
In October 1943, at the age of 18, 
Bertone volunteered for the U.S. Navy 
during World War II. He served with 
distinction for 21⁄2
years aboard the 
USS Zircon as part of the crew that res-
cued American sailors in the acci-
dental sinking of an ammo ship off 
Boston Harbor during the D-day inva-
sion of Normandy. 
I first met Teddy after he wrote a let-
ter to the editor on August 21, 2020, 
pleading for assistance after his re-
quest for help with proving his U.S. 
citizenship went unanswered. Having 
his citizenship paper was the most im-
portant thing to him because he loved 
this country so much. 
I called President Trump’s office, and 
within 4 days, on August 25, 2020, the 
citizenship office was in his backyard, 
swearing him in just weeks shy of his 
95th birthday. To me, seeing this World 
War II veteran at the age of 95 being 
sworn in as an American citizen, was 
the most beautiful thing I ever wit-
nessed. 
Sadly, Teddy passed away on March 
19, 2022, at the age of 96. 
We miss you, Teddy. We all remem-
ber your service, and you are a hero to 
so many of us on Staten Island and 
across the United States.

REMEMBERING ROBERT ‘‘BOB’’ 
FOOTE 
(Mr. MANN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. MANN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to commemorate the memory of Bob 
Foote, 
a 
tremendous 
Kansan 
who 
passed away on March 25. 
Bob was a man of many talents. He 
built one of the largest cattle oper-
ations in America, feeding 550,000 head 
a year and employing 400. 
He and his was wife, Gail, also built 
an amazing family who will carry on 
his legacy and lead Foote Cattle Com-
pany into the future. 
Bob had tenacity, grit, and con-
fidence. He wasn’t afraid to embrace an 
aggressive approach to business. His 
motto was ‘‘Get It,’’ which he would 
say to remind those around him to 
never give up and keep pushing for-
ward. 
Bob was a staunch conservative who 
would often be found giving one of his 
trademark Bob Foote lectures on poli-
tics. He was a true patriot. Most im-
portantly, now that he has gone into 
Heaven, he was a man of great faith. 
From the farm and headquarters in 
eastern Kansas to ranchland in the 
Flint Hills and feed yards in western 
Kansas, I am hard-pressed to think of 
any ag producer who had such an im-
pact on Kansas agriculture. 
Whether he was buying cattle or 
sharing his faith and work ethic with 
his grandchildren, Bob believed that he 
should use the talents that God gave

they continue to lead the industry and

Bob Foote, may you rest in peace.

CONGRATULATING 
SOUTH 
CARO-
LINA GAMECOCKS WOMEN’S BAS-
KETBALL TEAM ON NCAA NA-
TIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP 
(Mr. RICE of South Carolina asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, it is a privilege and honor 
today to congratulate the University of 
South Carolina women’s basketball 
team on winning the NCAA National 
Championship. It is a great day to be a 
Gamecock. 
After a heartbreaking loss in the 
Final Four last year, South Carolina 
found redemption Sunday night, earn-
ing the program’s second national 
championship title with a 64–49 victory 
over second seed UConn. 
The Gamecock women’s basketball 
team had an incredible season with a 
35–2 record, averaging 70 points a game. 
While every member of the team 
played their hearts out, Aliyah Boston, 
the Southeastern Conference Player of 
the Year, won the Final Four Most 
Outstanding Player award. She is the 
first South Carolina player to earn 
that honor since A’ja Wilson in 2017. 
Coach Dawn Staley had an incredible 
season. Hard work breeds success, and 
this team is a prime example of that. 
The national title is a win for South 
Carolina and every fan who helped 
cheer them to victory. 
Congratulations, 
Gamecocks, 
on 
being the national champions once 
again.

WALK THROUGH INFLATION 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Ari-
zona (Mr. SCHWEIKERT) is recognized 
for 60 minutes as the designee of the 
minority leader. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, one 
more time, I am going to do something 
that is a little difficult, and I apologize 
for you being the poor person in the 
chair when we do this. I am going to 
walk through inflation. 
I don’t think we understand the dam-
age, the economic violence, that is 
happening to the poor, the working 
poor, and the economic future of the 
country. 
Sorry, guys, the Democrats get the 
blame on this one. 
We are going to walk through the 
facts, the mechanisms, but also maybe 
a couple of solutions. 
This is going to be a tough one. So if 
you like economics, stay tuned. If you 
don’t like math and economics, I sug-
gest you get away from this presen-
tation as fast as possible. 
Also, another weird aside because I 
get this question all the time: The 
Chamber is empty, but we are probably 
on 1,000 televisions throughout the 
campus here in the House and the Sen-
ate, with staff and Members, and that 
is, in many ways, partially who we are 
communicating with to think dif-
ferently. 
First off, 1 year ago, I think it was 
March 21, 2021, the Democrats did one 
of their huge stimulus bills. Not a sin-
gle Republican voted for it. That is the 
moment you can track the explosion in 
inflation. 
I am stealing Larry Summers’ quote 
from one of his presentations a couple 
of days ago. There was a piling of dry 
kindling, and the Democrats decided to 
take a kerosene-soaked log, light it on 
fire, throw it on that kindling, and 
boom. Now, we are having a number of 
our economists saying we may have in-
flation for an entire decade. This is not 
transitory. 
Do you remember over and over and 
over when Treasury Secretary Yellen— 
who I used to have amazing respect for, 
but now she has become a partisan— 
would say to us, oh, it is transitory. A 
number of the Democratic economists 
would say it is transitory. They are no 
longer saying that. They basically ad-
mitted they screwed up, and a lot of 
people are getting hurt right now. 
I am going to show over and over, if 
you are a middle-class person, if you 
are part of the working poor, you are 
poorer today than 14 months ago when 
the Democrats took power. 
Let’s have a little bit of amusement 
here. You may all remember this. This 
is from before the stimulus bill, from a 
year ago. Larry Summers, not a big 
Republican—come on, Larry Summers 
has classically always been one of the 
left’s favorite economists, except when 
he told them: Don’t do this. Don’t do 
this. You already have pumped so 
much cash into the system. 
b 1630 
Remember, Mr. Speaker, the world is 
sort of split. The left believes in sort of 
a Keynesian model of consumption eco-
nomics. The right sort of believes in 
productivity: make more things. It is 
referred to as supply side. They decided 
to stimulate consumption and hand out 
lots of money, and now you are poorer 
today than you were a year ago, Mr. 
Speaker. The left’s own sort of biggest 
voice, 
Larry 
Summers, 
basically 
begged them not to do it. But there is 
a policy around here: buy your votes 
and spend lots of taxpayer money. 
Even today, The Wall Street Journal 
has an editorial featuring many of the 
comments from Larry Summers talk-
ing about how he expects actually a 
pretty severe recession now. 
We are going to pay a price for my 
brothers and sisters on the left basi-
cally failing their basic economics 
class. So let’s actually walk through it. 
Here is basically the chart, Mr. Speak-
er, and you can see the inflationary ex-
pectations when the Democrats took 
power, when they actually passed their 
big stimulus bill, and off to the races. 
My community in January had a 10.9 
percent year-over-year inflation. Some 
of our models right now say that this 
month and next month we are actually 
going to be having inflationary spikes. 
I need you to have a concept. So ev-
eryone is fretting right now: Oh, the 
Federal Reserve is going to raise inter-
est rates. It is 2 percent. They might 
actually go one-half of 1 percent. Mr. 
Speaker, if you go back to the early, 
early eighties and the Paul Volcker 
time, they had to raise the Federal 
funds rate equal to inflation. 
If today the actual inflation rate as 
of this moment is not 6 percent but 
closer to 8, 8.1, are you ready for a Fed-
eral funds rate at 8? 
Because that is what it takes. Be-
cause understand, Mr. Speaker, if you 
are borrowing money today at a Fed-
eral funds rate of 2, 21⁄2, and inflation 
really is closer to 8, there a huge, huge 
gap. Those need to actually be in align-
ment because you have a negative ac-
tual interest rate. When you are bor-
rowing below what inflation is costing, 
if the dollar goes to this value every 
day and you are paying this, you have 
substantial negative interest rates. 
What do you think is going to hap-
pen? 
So back to the reality. This is what 
we have done. Actually, I take that 
back. We didn’t do this. The Repub-
licans didn’t do it. The Democrats did 
it, and they did it without a single— 
without a single—Republican vote. 
This line, functionally, is your in-
come, Mr. Speaker, and, yes, it has had 
a little bit of movement up, but this is 
your purchasing power because your 
income has become worth less. In Jan-
uary when we got the 2021 basic data, 
the mean in our country was about 21⁄2 
percent 
poorer. 
Their 
purchasing 
power, they became poorer. 
Inflation has only increased since 
then. 
The reality of it is that really bad ec-
onomics end up hurting people. You 
will notice, Mr. Speaker, it is this 
White House saying—in an absolutely 
almost laughable—well, it is Putin’s 
inflation. Of course, it was going on 
long before Putin invaded Ukraine. 
Well, it is the Big Oil companies. Ex-
cept it was Democrat policies that cre-
ated the natural gas shortages last 
year. 
They are desperate to run away from 
the responsibility of what they have 
done. 
It is not part of this board deck, but, 
repeatedly, I have come to this floor 
and tried to walk through what the two 
things are, if you want to kick the 
working poor’s head in economically; 
what do you do? 
Well, inflation, right? 
Here is another article right now 
from The Washington Post—a truly 
conservative 
publication—‘‘Fed 
offi-
cial: Inflation falls hardest on poorer 
families.’’

April 5, 2022 
So the excuse of saying: Well, infla-
tion really wasn’t hurting the poor. I 
mean, come on. We are back to reality. 
You are killing and you are crushing, 
economically, the poor. 
So number one is inflation. Number 
two, if you actually look at the data on 
those folks we put in that category of 
the working poor, they are individuals 
who often didn’t finish high school or 
they didn’t go to college. They sell 
their labor. 
Do what the left has done this last 
year: open up the border. Have mil-
lions—millions—of people cross the 
border and come into the country who 
offer similar skill sets where their eco-
nomic value is they are going to sell 
their labor. And now you take the pop-
ulation we love and care about, but we 
are crushing that working poor, and 
say, Hey, you now get to compete with 
a couple of million new residents who 
are going to sell their labor. 
The policy of the last 14 months has 
just been brutal. You see it in the 
budget data, Mr. Speaker. Income in-
equality has gotten worse since the 
Democrats have taken charge. Food in-
security has gotten worse. Minority 
populations’ incredible gains that hap-
pened in 2018, 2019, and the first quarter 
of 2020 before the pandemic have been 
lost. 
So if you actually care, Mr. Speaker, 
if you say, I care about economic 
growth, economic growth is moral, 
then would you keep doing policies 
that keep hurting people? 
It is math. At some point I would be 
elated if the left said: Okay, they ac-
cept that their model doesn’t work and 
basically has never worked, and in-
stead of spending massive amounts of 
money—we are going to talk about the 
danger the country is now in because of 
the incredible levels of spending and 
how fragile. There is this fragility con-
cept of interest rates and debt we are 
going to walk through in a bit. 
If the Democrats really cared, they 
would basically steal the supply-side 
economics, call it their own—they have 
done that before on other things—and 
say, We care about poor people. We are 
actually going to help them. 
But you can’t do it this way. Every 
single day the Democrats have had ab-
solute control, people have gotten 
poorer. 
Once again, there was one Democrat 
that voted ‘‘no,’’ so I will give that per-
son credit. Zero Republicans voted 
‘‘yes,’’ but 220, 211 voting ‘‘no.’’ This is 
what they called the American Rescue 
Plan, except now we need to be rescued 
from the Democrats’ American Rescue 
Plan. 
Some of these slides are going to get 
a little thick. 
Purchasing power of $100—we talk 
about inflation, but most people don’t 
really process what it means. So let’s 
actually pretend that the baseline in-
flation that we believe we are at this 
last quarter, about 7.4, if you had that 
for 10 years, so if I gave you $100 today, 
Mr. Speaker, 10 years ago what would 
the purchasing power of that $100 be? 
It, functionally, is about $40, $46. You 
have lost more than half of it. Basi-
cally, your value and your wealth got 
cut in half. 
Now, if you are on the rich side, Mr. 
Speaker, you own lots of real estate 
and you have lots of assets. With infla-
tion, basically those assets become a 
hedge. But if you are a young family, if 
you are someone who is retired, you 
are living on a pension or you are liv-
ing on your savings or you are trying 
to get a family started, every day being 
able to participate in the American 
Dream gets harder. 
There is a reason inflation is one of 
the most destructive forces in the 
world in societies. It is because it is 
the ultimate spreader of income in-
equality. Those who have assets basi-
cally are indemnified from inflation. 
But if you don’t have a bunch of assets, 
you are this. That is what happens to 
you. Your dollar at the current rate of 
inflation will be cut in half in a decade. 
This is the result of the policies of this 
place from the last 14 months. 
And now we are seeing models saying 
that it may not be at 7.4. Some are say-
ing it could be 4 or 5. Now, I am a little 
more worried. But some of the best ex-
perts are now saying that inflation now 
may be structurally built in for this 
next decade. 
Do you understand the damage that 
is going to do to the American people? 
Just some of the different slides try-
ing to understand what the trajectory 
is right now. We are basically looking 
at what was projected to be some of the 
inflationary trends. The current line, 
basically, is starting to look at about 
an 8, 8.4. I actually think this year—re-
member, last year: Oh, it is transitory. 
Oh, it is just a seasonal spike. It is a 
supply chain spike. 
Now we see the studies that say: Hey, 
no, half of the inflation from last 
year—so if you are my community, 10.9 
year over year was policy from this 
body. It wasn’t Federal Reserve; it was 
policy from this body. The other half: 
Well, we will call it supply chain. 
But then you have to read the rest of 
the article. It basically breaks down 
that the stresses in the supply chain 
were 
workers, 
misallocation, 
those 
things, that also happened to be sub-
stantially related to Federal policy. 
This is an occasion where the Federal 
Reserve may be a sinner of keeping in-
terest rates too low too long, but Con-
gress, 1 year ago with their American 
Rescue Plan—not a single Republican 
voted for it—decided to throw kerosene 
and matches when their own Democrat 
economist, when Larry Summers is 
saying: Don’t do it. 
Congratulations. You made America 
poorer. 
Now, there is this concept out there 
called a wage-price spiral. This is real-
ly important to get your head around, 
Mr. Speaker, because there are those 
out there who think: Oh, the Federal 
Reserve will raise interest rates a little 
bit, some of the container ships will 
come in, and the supply chain and ev-
erything will be wonderful. That is not 
the math. 
There is this concept of, well, prices 
went up, so I need to be paid more. But 
if I need to be paid more, the business, 
to keep its margins, needs to raise its 
prices. Well, if they raise their prices, I 
need to be paid more because the busi-
ness needs to keep their margins, and I 
need to be able to afford the goods and 
services. You start this sort of ratchet, 
it is referred to as a wage-price spiral, 
and it becomes an unholy circle where 
wages and demand make a circle. The 
firm needs to keep its margins to stay 
in business, well, then you have higher 
prices and you have higher inflation, 
and you chase each other. 
One of the only ways economists 
have to break this is you have two 
choices: You do a bunch of policies 
very quickly to spike productivity. 
Well, that would mean my brothers and 
sisters on the left will, basically, walk 
away from their economic theory and 
say that they just became supply-sid-
ers and we are going to do everything 
we can to make more stuff. Or we go 
into a recession. A number of econo-
mists basically now say that we are 
heading to recession, and Larry Sum-
mers actually thinks it is a pretty 
tough recession coming. 
It is a really miserable, horrible 
thing to do to people who are just get-
ting out of a pandemic trying to get 
their lives back together. You hit them 
with inflation, you flood the borders, 
you push up crime, you push up 
fentanyl deaths in my area, and now 
you are going to run the country into 
a recession. Yay team. 
This is from last week. I am told 
some of these numbers have actually 
gotten worse this week, but we didn’t 
have time to print a new board. 
Citibank basically now says 25 percent 
chance of a recession before the end of 
the year. Goldman, they were at 271⁄2 
last week. I am told some of these 
numbers are now up. 
Economists like Larry Lindsey, I 
think, is predicting before the end of 
this month we will actually start to hit 
the very first steps of a recessionary 
cycle. 
Now, remember, Mr. Speaker, prices 
have gone up faster than your wages. 
So every day you are getting a little 
bit poorer, then you begin to pull back 
on your purchases. The model basically 
says that is what kicks off a reces-
sionary cycle. 
b 1645 
Now, in the past, when you did your 
high school economics class, it was, oh, 
inventories go up too high and you stop 
buying stuff and you bleed down your 
inventories. There is such a thing as an 
inflationary-driven recessionary cycle, 
because all of a sudden, you don’t have 
the same purchasing power. You actu-
ally saw some of the consumer data 
hitting last week that, all of a sudden, 
consumers are starting to change their 
behavior.

H4188 
April 5, 2022 
Larry Lindsey may have it right, 
that these Democrat policies are basi-
cally paying off what Larry Summers 
told you was going to happen. Trust 
me, I never thought I would be behind 
this microphone saying Larry Sum-
mers got it right. 
Now, you actually go into what are 
some of the other stressors that will 
make it so inflation doesn’t taper off. 
Remember: What is inflation? It is too 
many dollars chasing too few goods and 
services. 
So you can slow down, you can crush, 
you can remove liquidity. You can 
have the Federal Reserve basically 
bleed off some its inventory of bonds 
and other holdings. They can raise in-
terest rates, and that squeezes down 
the money supply. 
Or the other side, you can make more 
stuff. But it would require our brothers 
and sisters on the left, who run this 
place—they run Washington; they have 
the Presidency; they have the House; 
they have the Senate—to do things to 
incentivize our brothers and sisters not 
to retire early; for young people to get 
into the workforce; for some of the 
populations that, you know, it is 
dystopian policies of COVID where we 
forced so many working families and 
working moms out of the labor force 
after those miracle years of 2018, 2019, 
first quarter of 2020, where we saw 
wages, particularly for women of color, 
just miraculous numbers. 
Then comes the policy of shutting 
down the schools, shutting down the 
economy. Those are the populations 
who you can see have just been 
crushed. Unless we get back to levels of 
participating in the economy, you 
can’t get the productivity. 
So, could you and I come together, as 
people on left and the right, and say we 
are going to incentivize our brothers 
and sisters who may have chosen to re-
tire to come back in? We are going to 
incentivize individuals to come back 
into the labor force because we need to 
make more stuff. This is not com-
plicated economics. It is just a lot of 
complicated decisions, and it will re-
quire the left, basically, to walk away 
from some of their orthodoxy. 
The other thing—I show this slide 
just to point out what is happening de-
mographically. It is also an oppor-
tunity, but it is also really tough. We 
actually have a situation here, if you 
look where we are at, you come to the 
10-year marks, so at the end of the dec-
ade, we, functionally, are heading at 
parts where 20, 22 percent—actually, I 
think 22 percent of the population at 
the end of the decade are 65 and older. 
What are the leverages we would 
have here in Congress to encourage 
those individuals to stay in the labor 
force? We have already done some 
things in regard to the Social Security 
tax penalties, but could we do more of 
that? If this is about a labor shortage 
that is also going to continue the infla-
tionary cycle and you have the choice 
of making people poorer by shoving us 
into a recession or making more stuff, 
what are the levers you can pull to 
incentivize 
capital 
investments 
by 
businesses and organizations and then 
our brothers and sisters get into or 
come back into the labor force. 
There are also other reasons, and this 
does tie together. You understand how 
fragile—this is a basic chart showing 
how soon Social Security and the Medi-
care part A trust fund—most of Medi-
care is actually a general fund expendi-
tures. The hospital portion, what we 
call part A, is in a trust fund, and they 
are out of money. By 2027, Medicare 
part A is modeled to be empty, and this 
number is actually sooner because of 
what we did last year. This board was 
printed last year. 
The Social Security trust fund is out 
of money, I think, in 2032 or 2031, it 
may be our best guess now. If we have 
more of our brothers and sisters in the 
labor force, these numbers go out, if 
you have productivity. But there is a 
small problem. As inflation kicks off 
and the COLA mechanisms and Medi-
care healthcare costs keep going up, we 
are not absolutely sure what happens if 
we don’t get more labor force partici-
pation, more people in the economy 
working. 
All the costs here, these numbers, 
these bankruptcies, running out of 
money, Social Security and Medicare 
part A may be happening a lot sooner. 
So the brain trust around here has 
this idea that says, hey, let’s take the 
Medicare benefit age and instead of 
making it 65, let’s make it 60, because 
that way we can have the bankruptcy 
of it happen much sooner. It is good 
politics; it is great virtue-signaling 
from the speechifying. It may be good 
at getting reelected, but it is horrible 
economics. 
To understand how bad the econom-
ics have been, this is a slide I made last 
year, at the end of last year, to under-
stand what 2021 was like from a fiscal 
standpoint. 
The punch line, when you look at all 
of these numbers, is we were borrowing 
over $47,000 every second. Every second 
we were borrowing $47,000. You wonder 
why we kicked off inflation—excuse 
me—they kicked off inflation? You 
also wonder why your country, from a 
financial standpoint, is so fragile. 
I am going to show you a slide here 
at the end. It is basically the punch 
line at the end, that if the 2 points 
higher interest rate holds for a couple 
decades, at the end of those decades, 
every dime of revenue, receipts, into 
the Federal Government just covers in-
terest costs. 
Does anyone around here own a cal-
culator? Don’t give me, oh, we need 
more tax receipts, because the fact of 
the matter, post tax reform, you had 
number 2 and number 3 highest revenue 
years in U.S. history, adjusted for in-
flation, real receipts adjusted for infla-
tion. You are going to notice, even last 
year was the highest highest ever. And 
the only reason these two weren’t num-
ber 1 and number 2 is I think 2014 had 
a weird timing effect on some paybacks 
from TARP and some other things. 
The folks here don’t tell the truth 
about math and say, Oh, you guys did 
tax reform at the end of 2017. Yeah, but 
we grew the economy at a breakneck 
pace, the poor got dramatically less 
poor, and tax receipts came screaming 
in, particularly from overseas, unlike 
what was predicted by the left. Oh, it is 
a giveaway, except we took in a hell of 
a lot more taxes. 
Remember, the new tax code, that we 
are still under today, was more pro-
gressive than the old one. In other 
words, the rich are paying a higher per-
centage of Federal income taxes than 
they were before we did tax reform at 
the very end of 2017. But that was a 
supply side type of tax reform, encour-
aging people to make more stuff, to 
make the society more productive, to 
provide more opportunity. It worked. 
But it wasn’t, basically, the giveaway 
model that the left embraces, and, 
therefore, they repeatedly lie about it. 
Yes, think about this. Even with all 
the horrible things that went on in 
2020, a slight reduction in total tax rev-
enues, receipts; 2021, highest ever. We 
basically broke through $4 trillion dol-
lars. Our problem is, we still took that 
$4 trillion and then spent a couple tril-
lion on top of that, so we borrowed a 
couple trillion last year on top of all of 
the cash that came in through taxes. 
With all that borrowing, you start to 
realize the fraud, the danger. You see 
this whole section here, that green? 
That is magic money. That is, func-
tionally, the Federal Reserve buying 
our debt. So they basically lay a claim 
on banking deposits, a theoretical 
claim, and buy it. So when you have $5 
trillion thrown in, do you blame the 
Federal Reserve or do you blame us, 
who basically are running these mas-
sive deficits and debt? 
Look, the Federal Reserve is like the 
family member of an alcoholic family 
that keeps buying them beer. They ba-
sically have enabled our bad policy de-
cisions. If we had to pay the actual 
price for a lot of this crazy spending— 
but by doing what they did here—and 
the next time you have someone say, 
Oh, it is Japan, well, Japan is down 
here. China is there. This is the Fed-
eral Reserve, and then this is, function-
ally, individuals. 
I am going to show some of the slides 
that really worry me of what is the ap-
petite for people to basically buy a U.S. 
bond to help us keep financing this 
crazy debt and deficits and the fact 
that every day the bond is actually 
worth less money. 
If you go by a 10-year bond today— 
and I think the post I saw just before I 
came in here, it was sitting at about 
2.5. If it is true that at this moment, 
inflation may be running somewhere 
from 6 to 8 percent, how much are you 
losing every single day in your value? 
People are loaning the money and tak-
ing a negative rate of return. That 
isn’t going to go on long. That is when 
you hear this discussion of inverted 
yield curves. 
I was going to do a whole presen-
tation on yield curves, and the staff,

April 5, 2022 
basically, looked at me in terror, so I 
am not going to do that to you. 
Just basically understand, when you 
hear the term ‘‘inverted,’’ it basically 
says, theoretically, if I loan you money 
on a short-term, I should be willing to 
take a lower interest rate, because 
there is less risk than if I loan you 
money longer. I should ask for a little 
bit more premium, because more bad 
things, more unknowns, more black 
swans can happen. 
When it inverts, it basically says: I 
expect something bad in the short 
term, but eventually it will work itself 
out, so I am willing to give you longer- 
term money at a better yield or at a 
better price. 
The yield curve has, right now, two 
things that should send you some very 
weird messages. The short term is in-
verted and then comes back and in-
verts. But at the end of the curve, 
longer term, you start to see people are 
getting very worried about those 20 
years, 30 years of long-term U.S. debt. 
You are starting to see it in the actual 
pricing of our debt, and that should be 
signaling you some very scary mes-
sages. 
A chart like this—and I am not even 
sure it is completely accurate yet. I 
think the numbers are actually worse. 
We are right here. We are, functionally, 
now working on the 2023 budget, and 
they are basically trying to tell you: 
Hey, be prepared; we are going to be 
well over a trillion dollars a year. 
Eight budget years from now, just the 
interest cost is a trillion bucks. That is 
assuming the CBO’s baseline interest 
rate that is nowhere near high enough. 
So we were already heading, at the 
end of this decade, to trillion-dollar-a- 
year just borrowing cost. That was just 
the interest. Remember, it is not what 
we borrow today; it is what we borrow 
today and all of the other debt that has 
to be refinanced. Because when the 
bond that was sold 10 years ago comes 
due, we don’t pay it off. We just sell 
more debt and refinance it. 
If you have a $100 billion option of 
new debt, new borrowing, because of 
our incredible spending, there may be 
another $200 or $300 billion on top of 
that, that’s what we call the roll, the 
weighted daily average. 
b 1700 
Just have that in your head. Func-
tionally, in 8 years, interest—inter-
est—is a trillion dollars a year. And 
the hits keep getting worse. This is be-
fore the craziness of the spending. 
This board was printed, I think, in 
2021, so it missed trillions of dollars of 
additional borrowing and spending. We 
were already scheduled to borrow $112 
trillion of running debt in today’s dol-
lars in 29 years. Three-quarters of it 
was Medicare, functionally, one-quar-
ter of it was Social Security. The rest 
of the budget is substantially in bal-
ance. 
Inflation now is about to drive med-
ical costs up, and inflation actually 
changes the COLA of Social Security. 
These numbers get dramatically worse. 
But there is a scam here. I am going to 
do my best to try to explain this. You 
are retired. You have savings. You are 
getting your Medicare, your Social Se-
curity. But your savings, as this infla-
tion continues, every day is worth a 
little less money. 
You hear the term, eating away at 
your value. If inflation is eating away 
at your value, where does that value 
go? It basically goes to this side of the 
ledger. When you are paying back 
those bonds, that debt, you are paying 
it back now with less valuable dollars. 
It is basically a transfer from everyone 
that saved, particularly our retired 
population. 
Remember, at the end of the decade, 
22 percent of the population is 65 or 
older. The population that has saved, 
they become poorer, and that money is 
transferred to being able to pay back 
our debt. But now you get to pay it 
back with inflated dollars. It’s a secret 
backdoor way to strip savers, older 
Americans of their wealth, and move it 
to pay back the crazy amounts of bor-
rowing that are going on. 
So now we structurally will also 
make—it really affects our retired pop-
ulation; they get poorer. But it is also 
a way to pay back the amazing amount 
of debt with what you call inflated dol-
lars, less valuable dollars, and it is a 
wink-wink-nod-nod. 
There are some economists, particu-
larly here in Washington, who will ac-
tually say, Don’t say it out loud, 
SCHWEIKERT; but we almost need to do 
this because there is no way this body 
is capable of doing the policies that 
would create the level of growth and 
economic 
participation 
that 
would 
raise everyone’s wealth, everyone’s 
prosperity, and, therefore, the tax re-
ceipts and the less need for social enti-
tlements and social transfer programs. 
We can do really good policy for real-
ly good economics, or we can just in-
flate our way out of part of the crush-
ing debt, and it looks like Democrat 
policies have decided we are going to 
inflate our way because that is what 
has happened here. That is the decision 
that has been made. 
This chart is a little hard to get our 
head around, but what is important 
about it is to get our sense of how fast, 
since January ‘21, the levels of bor-
rowing through the Federal Reserve 
are going. This one basically says since 
January ‘21 there has been another $2, 
$21⁄2 trillion of transfer from Federal 
Reserve absorbing U.S. sovereign debt. 
Basically, they are creating magic 
money to help us keep financing our 
spending. That is also money because 
of our fiscal decisions. 
Inflation didn’t come out of nowhere. 
This is the third time I am going to say 
it. Even Democrat economists were 
warning the majority here that this 
was coming, and you decided to kick 
Americans in the head. 
So, 
think 
about 
this: 
President 
Biden, Speaker PELOSI made a decision, 
and so far in President Biden’s term 
we, functionally, have well over $21⁄2 
trillion of additional debt piled on. It is 
a remarkable record. In a time when 
we were coming out of the COVID 
dystopia, we piled on another $21⁄2 tril-
lion plus created all sorts of other un-
funded liabilities. 
The next slide is really important to 
get our heads around. There is this 
concept of fragility. If it is true, we 
may be heading into not just—because 
we all agree the fraud of saying the in-
flation is transitory, okay, that con job 
has now come to an end. Now, the left 
is going to try to say, well, it is Putin’s 
inflation, it is Big Oil inflation. Ameri-
cans aren’t stupid. 
I am particularly blessed, I represent 
one of the best-educated districts in all 
of America, so I have freaky smart peo-
ple in my Phoenix-Scottsdale district, 
and they get this. But there is this con-
cept of fragility. What happens to the 
country if interest rates are just a bit 
higher than we have modeled? Do you 
have a sense of what happens? 
This board is from a year ago when 
we did the math. If interest rates are 
just 2 points, 2 percent—which is al-
ready 
happening—2 
percent 
higher 
than 
CBO’s 
baseline, 
Congressional 
Budget Office’s baseline, functionally, 
in 29 years, every dollar of tax receipts, 
tax income, however you want to call 
it—in Ways and Means we call it re-
ceipts—every dollar just pays the in-
terest bill. It buys nothing. There is no 
more money for education, space trav-
el; there is no more money for Medi-
care, Medicaid; there is no more money 
because all we are paying is interest. 
This is the fragility. This is how dan-
gerous you have made this country’s 
economics 
by 
borrowing 
so 
much 
money and then screwing up the eco-
nomics. 
My point of this 45 minutes of ram-
bling: Inflation—very, very dangerous. 
There are policy decisions. Those pol-
icy decisions will require the Demo-
crats to walk away from their ortho-
doxy. They will have to admit they 
have been worshipping a false econom-
ics god and join us in doing things that 
are, actually, good for society, good for 
poor people, good for the working poor, 
good for the middle class. 
And then, dear God, hopefully we are 
not too late, because if Larry Summers 
is correct that we are actually going to 
go into a pretty harsh recession, you 
want to kick people in the head; you 
want to destroy the middle class; you 
want to make it so it takes years to 
get back to normality; and now you 
have economists saying the inflation 
may be with us for a decade. Even if 
Republicans take back Congress and 
then take back the White House, it 
could be a decade before we repair the 
damage that this body did in 14 
months. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The majority leader is recognized. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, now 
on COVID, yesterday afternoon I an-
nounced that Senator ROMNEY and I 
had reached an agreement for a $10 bil-
lion COVID supplemental appropria-
tions package. It took many rounds of 
bipartisan talks, many days and nights 
and weekends of negotiations, but we 
have shaken hands on a compromise 
that the Senate can and should move 
forward very soon. 
I thank the Senators on both sides of 
the aisle who participated in this, and 
Senators BURR, BLUNT, and GRAHAM 
were involved with Senator ROMNEY. 
Senator COONS gets a special shout-out 
because of his fierce determination to 
work on international, on getting an 
international thing done. Senator MUR-
RAY, as well, was very helpful in our 
negotiations. 
The deal we announced yesterday has 
the support of Speaker PELOSI
and 
President Biden, who urged Congress to 
work quickly to get a bill to his desk. 
We are going to work hard to get that 
done, and I hope my Republican col-
leagues will join us to move forward on 
this legislation. 
There is no reason why we shouldn’t 
be able to get this funding passed. The 
administration needs it right now, and 
we all know that our country is in 
great need of replenishing our COVID 
health response funding. Putting in the 
work, today, to keep our Nation pre-
pared against new variants will make 
it less likely that we get caught off 
guard by a new variant down the line. 
So this is really essential to Amer-
ica’s well-being. It is essential to get-
ting back to normal. All those who de-
cried that we didn’t get to normal 
quickly enough should be supportive of 
this legislation, because the longer we 
wait, the more difficult it will be when 
the next variant hits. 
This $10 billion COVID package will 
give the Federal Government and our 
citizens the tools we need—we depend 
on—to continue our economic recov-
ery, to keep our schools open, to keep 
American families safe. The package 
we agreed to will provide billions more 
for vaccines, more testing capacity, 
and—essential—$5 billion for more life-
saving 
therapeutics, 
arguably 
the 
greatest need right now for the coun-
try. 
These therapeutics are great drugs, 
but if we don’t have them at the ready 
when the new variant hits, it will let 
the variant get its tentacles deeper 
into our society. But this money will 
go a long way at keeping our schools, 
our businesses, our churches, our com-
munities running as normally as pos-
sible, should a future variant rear its 
nasty head. 
Approving this package is simply the 
sensible, responsible, and necessary 
thing to do. Republicans and Demo-
crats alike should now work together

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1950 
April 5, 2022 
to make sure we can move this package 
through the Chamber. 
Now, while this funding is absolutely 
necessary, it is far from perfect. I am 
deeply disappointed that some of our 
Republican friends could not agree to 
include $5 billion for global response ef-
forts. I pushed them hard to include 
this 
international 
funding, 
as, 
of 
course, did Senator COONS and Sen-
ators GRAHAM
and ROMNEY
because 
fighting COVID abroad is intrinsically 
connected 
to 
keeping 
Americans 
healthy at home. 
It is not just the right thing to do to 
help struggling nations, though we cer-
tainly have an obligation to help. It is 
also good for our country. So it is put-
ting money overseas to prevent COVID 
from spreading here, because, remem-
ber, every variant—all three variants— 
that hit us started overseas and then 
came here. So that is not only humani-
tarian and the moral and right thing to 
do, but it is in our own self-interest. I 
know it sometimes sounds anomalous— 
sending money overseas is in our inter-
est—but with COVID, where it ger-
minates and starts the new variants, 
inevitably overseas, and then comes to 
hurt us is the right thing to do in our 
own self-interest, even if you had no 
humanitarian interest in doing it, 
which, of course, many of us do have a 
great deal of humanitarian interest. 
If we don’t help the developing na-
tions of the world with vaccines and 
treatment, we leave ourselves seriously 
at risk for potential new variants. Omi-
cron, after all, started, in all likeli-
hood, in South Africa, where today less 
than a third of the population is vac-
cinated—fully vaccinated. 
It is thus my intention for the Sen-
ate to consider a bipartisan inter-
national appropriations package that 
will include funding to address COVID– 
19, as well as other urgent priorities, 
like aid for Ukraine and funding for 
global food insecurity. 
I know that many on both sides—I 
mentioned the names earlier—are seri-
ous about reaching an agreement on 
this issue. Nevertheless, this week’s 
agreement is carefully negotiated. We 
bent over backward when our Repub-
lican colleagues did not want to accept 
certain kinds of pay-fors which we 
thought were appropriate and have al-
ways been used, but we thought it was 
so important to get this done that we 
did that. It is a very important step to 
keeping the country healthy and keep-
ing life as close to normal in the future 
as we can. 
I want to thank, again, Senator ROM-
NEY for leading the negotiations for the 
Senate Republicans and working in 
good faith to reach agreement. I also 
want to thank, as I mentioned, COONS, 
MURRAY, BURR, BLUNT, and GRAHAM for 
their help and support to reach this bi-
partisan 
agreement, 
and 
Chairman 
LEAHY and his staff for their assistance 
in putting the legislation together. 
Finally, I want to thank the staff of 
the CBO, the Congressional Budget Of-
fice. They worked around the clock 
with us to score this legislation. 
So we have taken a massive step 
closer to getting this important fund-
ing done, and I thank everyone for 
their good work to reach this point. 
NOMINATION OF KETANJI BROWN JACKSON 
Now, on another happy note, the 
Judge Jackson confirmation, last night 
we took our first steps here on the Sen-
ate floor toward confirming the his-
toric nomination of Judge Ketanji 
Brown Jackson to the U.S. Supreme 
Court. By virtue of a motion to dis-
charge, Judge Jackson’s nomination 
was reported out of the Judiciary Com-
mittee—it really wasn’t reported out of 
Judiciary. 
By virtue of a motion to discharge, 
Judge Jackson’s nomination was put 
on the floor by a bipartisan vote of 53– 
47. She now comes to the floor for con-
sideration by the whole Chamber. 
Every day we move closer to Judge 
Jackson’s confirmation, the case and 
likelihood of her confirmation grows 
stronger and stronger and stronger. 
And I thank my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle who have approached 
this process with good faith. At the end 
of the day, it will be our courts and the 
American people who rely on our 
courts who will benefit most from hav-
ing an amazing jurist like Judge Jack-
son elevated to the pinnacle of the Fed-
eral judiciary. 
Here is what happens next. Later 
today, I am going to take the next step 
for moving forward with Judge Jack-
son’s nomination by filing cloture on 
her. My colleagues should be advised 
that we may have to take some proce-
dural votes to do so, but this will not 
affect the ultimate result of this con-
firmation process. 
Once I file cloture, the stage will be 
set for the Senate to close debate on 
Judge Jackson’s nomination by Thurs-
day morning. A vote on final confirma-
tion will then follow. The Senate could 
then vote to confirm Judge Jackson as 
Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson as soon 
as Thursday—as soon as this Thursday. 
I hope we can work together and make 
that happen. 
What better way to wrap up this 
work period—this productive, largely 
bipartisan work period—than by con-
firming this most worthy, most quali-
fied, most historic nominee to the Su-
preme Court? 
Yesterday, I said something that I 
think is worth emphasizing all week 
long: Judge Jackson’s nomination is a 
joyous and momentous occasion for the 
Senate. She is truly one of the most 
qualified and accomplished individuals 
ever considered by this Chamber to the 
Supreme Court. She will bring a new 
and much needed perspective to the 
Court’s work, while also affirming the 
rule of law and respect for precedent. 
As I said yesterday, the confirmation 
of the Nation’s first Black woman to 
the highest Court in the land will reso-
nate for the rest of our Nation’s his-
tory. Untold millions of kids will open 
textbooks and see pictures of Justice 
Jackson and understand in a new way 
what it means to move toward a more 
perfect Union. It means that all our 
Nation’s struggles, for all the steps for-
ward and steps backward, the long 
march of our democracy is toward 
greater opportunity and representation 
for all. 
So when the Senate finishes its work 
this week, Justice Jackson will be the 
first of many—the first of many. Her 
brilliance, her lifetime of hard work, 
her remarkable story will light a flame 
of inspiration for the next generation 
to hopefully chart their own path for 
serving our democracy and unleash so 
much talent that has thus far not been 
utilized. This gives me great hope. 
That should give all of us great hope. 
COMMERCE HEARING 
Mr. President, finally, I want to close 
by thanking my friend and colleague 
Chairwoman CANTWELL for holding a 
hearing in the Commerce Committee 
that is of great importance to the 
American 
people: 
ensuring 
trans-
parency in petroleum markets. That 
hearing will occur today. 
The American people right now find 
themselves on the losing side of a truly 
disturbing trend. On the one hand, the 
American people are paying more and 
more at the pump, and some of the Na-
tion’s biggest oil companies are report-
ing soaring profits but then using those 
profits to reward shareholders with 
stock buybacks. 
This is infuriating. Prices go way up; 
oil companies make more profit; and 
what 
do 
they 
use 
it 
for? 
Stock 
buybacks, which do nothing to improve 
the economy, improve workers, or help 
the consumer. It is outrageous, and it 
is one of the reasons there is such mis-
trust of the big oil companies. 
So I am glad that the Commerce 
Committee is looking into this impor-
tant issue, and I urge the FTC to like-
wise take note. 
I thank Chair CANTWELL
for her 
work. I expect that we will see addi-
tional announcements on this matter 
very soon. This caucus—this Demo-
cratic caucus—is going to keep its eye 
out and do whatever we can to help 
with bringing down the outrageously 
high price of oil and the outrageous ac-
tions of corporate executives in the oil 
industry. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.

objection, it is so ordered.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1951 
April 5, 2022 
problem facing our country actually 
doubled and so did the share of those 
most worried about the price of gas. 
Consumer price hikes have now set 
new 40-year records multiple months in 
a row. More and more American fami-
lies are feeling the pinch. And 7 in 10 
say they do not like how President 
Biden is handling it. 
It was clear from the start that the 
Biden administration’s war on afford-
able energy would punish American 
consumers, and even liberal economists 
warned that flooding our economy with 
partisan spending could trigger broad 
inflation. 
Sure enough, American families have 
now endured 9 straight months of infla-
tion above a 5-percent annual pace, and 
the worst effects are being felt in the 
most vulnerable pockets of our society. 
One analysis of spending on house-
hold staples found that cost cutting ‘‘is 
most pronounced among lower-income 
Americans.’’ 
As the Washington Post reported, 
‘‘lower-income 
workers 
like 
[Jac-
queline] Rodriguez have seen some of 
the fastest wage growth of the pan-
demic era. But those gains are being 
eroded by the highest inflation in 40 
years. . . . ‘It’s outrageous how much 
everything has gone up,’ Rodriguez 
said. ‘I go to the supermarket to buy 
chicken, and I have to make a decision 
on what meal I’m going to cook based 
on the prices. . . . Everything is more 
expensive.’ ’’ 
Another group who especially remain 
vulnerable are seniors on fixed in-
comes. One retired teacher in North 
Carolina recently said it like this: 
Just surviving day to day has become a big 
concern of mine—because, how in the world? 
. . . I’m starting to panic. I’m starting to 
think, ‘‘How am I going to keep paying for 
everything?’’ 
Many retirees already face health 
challenges or other hardships so there 
is simply no wiggle room in their budg-
ets. 
One California man explained that 
cancer was the reason he had to retire 
in the first place. Now he is ‘‘scraping 
the bottom of the barrel. . . . I do most 
of my food shopping in markdown bins 
and don’t buy much else.’’ 
One White House official has seemed 
to endorse the sentiment that inflation 
is ‘‘a high-class problem.’’ A whole lot 
of low-income Americans and retired 
Americans could very readily set them 
straight on that. 
Last autumn, the administration’s 
top spokeswoman scoffed at what she 
called ‘‘the tragedy of the treadmill 
that’s delayed.’’ 
Well, that may be the extent of the 
pain that inflation and supply chain 
problems are causing certain affluent 
people—people like those inside the 
beltway having to wait a little extra on 
luxury purchases—but I can assure the 
President’s team that many Americans 
are hurting a lot worse than they are. 
The very least the administration 
must do is stop digging; no more reck-
less spending, no gigantic tax increases 
that would damage the economy even 
further. 
Yet Senate Democrats won’t give up 
on yet another reckless spending spree, 
and just last week, the Biden adminis-
tration proposed to smack the country 
with the largest tax hike in American 
history. 
The last thing American families can 
afford is more of the same recklessness 
that got us where we are. 
NOMINATION OF KETANJI BROWN JACKSON 
Mr. President, now on a different 
matter, the Constitution makes the 
President and the Senate partners in 
selecting Supreme Court Justices. And 
as a practical matter, each Senator 
gets to define what ‘‘advice and con-
sent’’ means to them. 
For much of the 20th century, Sen-
ates typically took a different ap-
proach. Senators tended to give Presi-
dents a lot of leeway as long as nomi-
nees checked basic professional and 
ethical boxes. 
But then the political left and Senate 
Democrats initiated a series of major 
changes. In the late 1980s, Democrats 
thrust the Senate into a more aggres-
sive posture toward nominations with 
an 
unprecedented, 
scorched-earth 
smear campaign that took aim at a 
nominee’s judicial philosophy. 
The Washington Post editorial board 
said back at the time that the formerly 
‘‘conventional view’’ that Presidents 
would get great deference had now 
‘‘fallen into . . . disrepute.’’ They wor-
ried that a ‘‘highly politicized future’’ 
for ‘‘confirmation proceedings’’ might 
lie ahead following Democrats’ actions. 
Well, just a few years later, personal 
attacks on then-Judge Thomas made 
the previous hysteria over Judge Bork 
seem like lofty debate by comparison. 
And 1 year after that, in 1992, then- 
Senator Biden proclaimed that if an-
other vacancy occurred toward the end 
of President Bush 41’s term, the Judici-
ary Committee should not hold any 
hearings before the Presidential elec-
tion. 
Well, that situation didn’t arise that 
year, and once President Clinton took 
office, Republicans did not try to 
match Democrats’ behavior simply out 
of spite. We tried actually to deesca-
late. Justices Ginsburg and Breyer 
both won lopsided votes with opposi-
tion in single digits. That was during a 
time when Republicans were in the ma-
jority. 
But the very next time that Demo-
crats lost the White House, the prece-
dent-breaking tactics came roaring 
back. 
During the Bush 43 administration, 
Senate Democrats, and especially the 
current Democratic leader, took the in-
credibly rare tactic of filibustering ju-
dicial nominations and made it rou-
tine. 
The press at the time described the 
sea change: 
They said it was important for the Senate 
to change the ground rules and there was no 
obligation to confirm someone just because 
they are scholarly or erudite. 
Democrats decided that pure legal 
qualifications were no longer enough. 
They wanted judicial philosophy on the 
table. 
So, 20 years ago, several of the same 
Senate Democrats who are now trum-
peting the historic nature of Judge 
Jackson’s nomination used these tac-
tics to delay or block nominees, includ-
ing an African-American woman and a 
Hispanic man—both, of course, nomi-
nated by a Republican President. 
In one case, Democrats suggested 
their opposition was specifically—lis-
ten to this—specifically because the 
nominee’s Hispanic heritage would ac-
tually make him a rising star. 
Half—half—of 
Senate 
Democrats 
voted against Chief Justice Roberts, 
the best appellate advocate of his gen-
eration. All but four Democrats voted 
against Justice Alito, who had the 
most judicial experience of any nomi-
nee in almost a century. 
There was no question about the 
basic legal qualifications of either, but 
Democrats opposed both. And in mid- 
2007, more than a year before the next 
Presidential election, Senator SCHU-
MER expanded upon the Biden standard 
from 15 years prior. He said that if an-
other Supreme Court vacancy arose, 
Democrats should not let President 
Bush fill it. 
Our colleague from New York pro-
posed to keep a hypothetical vacancy 
open until an election that was more 
than a year away. During President 
Obama’s terms, Republicans took up 
the same hardball tactics that Demo-
crats had just pioneered. 
But our colleagues recoiled at the 
taste of their own medicine and broke 
the rules to escape it. They preferred 
to detonate the ‘‘nuclear option’’ for 
the first time ever rather than let 
President Obama’s nominees face the 
same treatment they had just in-
vented—invented—for 
President 
Bush’s. 
Democrats did not then change the 
rule for the Supreme Court because 
there was no vacancy. But the late 
Democratic leader Harry Reid said pub-
licly he would do the same thing for 
the Supreme Court with no hesitation. 
By 2016, Democrats had spent 30 
years radically changing the confirma-
tion process, and now they had nuked 
the Senate’s rules. Obviously, this 
pushed Republicans into a more asser-
tive posture ourselves. 
So when an election-year vacancy did 
arise, we applied the Biden-Schumer 
standard and did not fill it. And then, 
when Democrats filibustered a stellar 
nominee for the next year, we extended 
the Reid standard to the Supreme 
Court. 
In 2016 and 2017, Republicans only 
took steps that Democrats had publicly 
declared they would take themselves. 
Yet our colleagues spent the next 4 
years—4 years—trying to escalate even 
further. 
Justice Gorsuch, impeccably quali-
fied, received the first successful par-
tisan filibuster of a Supreme Court

nominee in American history; Justice 
Kavanaugh got an astonishing and dis-
graceful spectacle; and Justice Barrett 
received baseless, delegitimizing at-
tacks on her integrity. 
Now, this history is not the reason 
why I oppose Judge Jackson. This is 
not about finger-pointing or partisan 
spite. I voted for a number of President 
Biden’s nominees when I could support 
them, and just yesterday, moments 
after the Judiciary Committee dead-
locked on Judge Jackson, they ap-
proved another judicial nominee by a 
unanimous vote. 
My point is simply this: Senate 
Democrats could not have less standing 
to pretend—pretend—that a vigorous 
examination of a nominee’s judicial 
philosophy is somehow off limits. 
My Democratic friends across the 
aisle have no standing whatsoever to 
argue that Senators should simply 
glance—just glance—at Judge Jack-
son’s resume and wave her on through. 
Our colleagues intentionally brought 
the Senate to a more assertive place. 
They intentionally began a vigorous 
debate about what sort of jurispru-
dence actually honors the rule of law. 
This is the debate Democrats wanted. 
Now it is the debate Democrats have. 
And that is what I will discuss tomor-
row—why Judge Jackson’s apparent ju-
dicial philosophy is not well suited to 
our highest Court.

NOMINATION OF KETANJI BROWN JACKSON 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, later 
this week, perhaps in a day or two, the 
Senate will vote on the nomination of 
Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to serve 
as a member of the U.S. Supreme 
Court. 
Last week, I laid out my reasons for 
my opposition to this nomination, and 
yesterday, I voted against her nomina-
tion in the Judiciary Committee. But I 
want to make clear that my vote 
against Judge Jackson is not a rebuke 
of her legal knowledge, her experience, 
or her character. Judge Jackson is ob-
viously very smart. She has vast prac-
tical experience, which I think is very 
useful. She is likeable. And she is very 
clearly passionate about her work. 
The Senate’s constitutional duty to 
provide advice and consent, though, re-
quires us to look beyond Judge Jack-
son’s resume and personality to under-
stand her judicial philosophy and the 
lens through which she views her role 
as a judge. 
Certainly, the Senate must evaluate 
whether Judge Jackson will act fairly 
and impartially. We have also got to 
make a judgment whether she will 
leave her personal beliefs and her pol-
icy preferences at the door and whether 
she will respect the bounds of her role 
as a judge or attempt to establish new 
judge-made law. 
This last point is absolutely critical, 
in my view. The Founders wisely estab-
lished a system of checks and balances 
to ensure that no person or institution 
wields absolute power. The legislative 
branch, of course, makes law; the exec-
utive branch enforces the law; and the 
judicial branch interprets the law. We 
have each got our responsibilities 
under the Constitution.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1953 
April 5, 2022 
And while that is certainly a sim-
plification of the duties of each of the 
three branches, it does illustrate that 
there are separate lanes or roles for 
each branch in our constitutional Re-
public. And we talked about that dur-
ing Judge Jackson’s confirmation hear-
ing. 
The judge said she understands the 
importance of staying in her lane. She 
used that phrase many times during 
the confirmation hearing. She said she 
would not try to do Congress’s job 
making laws. 
But over the years—and I think this 
is a blind spot for Judge Jackson and, 
frankly, many on the bench, particu-
larly at the highest levels. Over the 
years, we have come to see a pattern of 
judges who embrace the concept of 
judge-made law. 
In other words, it is not derived from 
a statute passed by the Congress, it is 
not derived from the text of the Con-
stitution itself, but rather, it is made 
as a policy judgment without any ex-
plicit reference in the Constitution 
itself. Now, that, I believe, is judicial 
policymaking or legislating from the 
bench. 
The Supreme Court over the years 
has developed various legal doctrines 
like substantive due process. That is a 
little more opaque, I would think, to 
most people than judge-made law, but 
basically, it is the same thing. It is a 
doctrine under which judges create new 
rights that are not laid out in the Con-
stitution. 
It shouldn’t matter if a person ulti-
mately agrees or disagrees with this 
new right. If you like the result, well, 
you are liable to overlook the process 
by which the judges reached a decision. 
But if you disagree with it, then, clear-
ly, it is a problem to have judges— 
unelected, unaccountable to the vot-
ers—making policy from the bench, no 
matter what it is called. 
It is deeply concerning, I think—and 
it should be—to all Americans, to have 
nine unelected and ultimately unac-
countable judges make policies that af-
fect 330-or-so million people and they 
can have no say-so about it at all. They 
can’t vote for them; they can’t vote 
them out of office; they can’t hold 
them accountable. In fact, the whole 
purpose of judicial independence is so 
judges can make hard decisions, but 
they have to be tethered to the Con-
stitution and the law, not made up out 
of whole cloth. 
No judge is authorized under our 
form of government to rewrite the Con-
stitution to their liking or impose a 
policy for the entire country simply be-
cause it aligns with their personal be-
lief or their policy preferences. 
As our Founders wrote in the Dec-
laration of Independence: 
Governments are instituted among Men, 
deriving their just powers from the consent 
of the governed. 
When judges find unenumerated and 
invisible rights in the Constitution and 
issue a judgment holding that, in es-
sence, all State and Federal laws that 
contradict with their new judge-made 
law is invalid and unconstitutional, 
there is no opportunity for anybody to 
consent to that outcome like you 
would if you were a Member of the Sen-
ate or a Member of the House. People 
could lobby us. They could call us on 
the phone. They could send us emails, 
use social media to try to influence our 
decision. They could recruit somebody 
to run against us in the next election. 
They could vote us out of office if they 
didn’t like the outcome. 
But none of that would apply to life- 
tenured, unaccountable Federal judges 
making judge-made law at the highest 
levels—no consent of the governed, no 
legitimacy which comes from consent. 
Abraham Lincoln made clear that it 
is the concept of consent that is the 
foundation for our form of government. 
He said famously: No man is good 
enough to govern another man without 
that man’s consent. 
Of course, he used that in the context 
of slavery, and he was right; but it has 
broader application as well. 
As I said, when it comes to the execu-
tive and legislative branches, it is easy 
to see how consent and the legitimacy 
that flows from that comes into play. 
Voters cast their ballot for Senators, 
for Members of the House, for the 
President. 
Once a person is in office, voters con-
duct what you could describe as a per-
formance evaluation. The next time 
that person is on the ballot, voters de-
termine whether that person should re-
main in office or be replaced by some-
one new. 
But, again, that is not true of the ju-
dicial branch, which highlights and 
demonstrates why the judicial branch 
is different, why it shouldn’t be a pol-
icy maker, why judges shouldn’t be 
pronouncing judge-made law that is 
not contained in the Constitution 
itself. 
It is important that our courts re-
main independent and be able to make 
those hard calls, but even people like 
Justice Breyer, who Judge Jackson 
will succeed on the Supreme Court, has 
written 
books 
worried 
about 
the 
politicization of the judiciary, and I 
think that is one reason why our judi-
cial confirmation hearings can get so 
contentious—witness 
Brett 
Kavanaugh’s 
confirmation 
hearing, 
which was a low point, I believe, for 
the Senate Judiciary Committee and 
for the Senate as a whole. 
But people wouldn’t get so exercised 
over these nominations if people were 
simply calling balls and strikes like 
the umpire at a baseball game. Judges 
should be umpires; judges should not be 
players. 
So Justices on the Supreme Court 
are not held accountable at the ballot 
box, and they aren’t evaluated every 
few years for their job performance. 
They are nominated by the President 
and confirmed for a lifetime appoint-
ment. 
When Justices engage in blatant pol-
icymaking, it takes away the power of 
‘‘we the people’’ to decide for ourselves 
and hold our government accountable. 
It speaks to that statement in the Dec-
laration of Independence that says gov-
ernment derives its just powers from 
the consent of the governed. But that 
is totally missing when it comes to 
judge-made law and identifying new 
rights that are nowhere mentioned in 
the Constitution. 
Again, I understand, when you like 
the outcome as a policy matter, you 
are not liable to complain too much. 
But we should recognize this over the 
course of our history as a source of 
abuse by judges at different times in 
our history, and we have seen the hor-
rible outcomes of things like Plessy vs. 
Ferguson, where the Supreme Court, 
without reference to the Constitution 
itself, using this doctrine of sub-
stantive due process, said that ‘‘sepa-
rate but equal’’ was the answer for the 
conflict between the rights of African- 
American schoolchildren and the rest 
of the population. They said it is OK. 
You can satisfy the Constitution if you 
give them separate but equal edu-
cations. 
Well, of course, that is a shameful 
outcome, and we would all join to-
gether in repudiating that kind of out-
come. And, thankfully, years later— 
too many years later—Brown v. Board 
of Education established that the ‘‘sep-
arate but equal’’ doctrine was over-
ruled, and that is as it should be. 
But the point I am trying to make 
here is whether it is the Court’s deci-
sions on abortion or the right to marry 
a same-sex partner or separate but 
equal, or even things like the Dred 
Scott decision, which held that Afri-
can-American 
fugitive 
slaves 
were 
chattel property, or in the famous 
Lochner case, where the New Deal Jus-
tices struck down an attempt by the 
government to regulate the working 
hours of bakers in New York. 
All of these involved the use of this 
substantive due process doctrine as a 
way to cover up and hide the fact that 
it was judges making the law and not 
the policymakers who run for office. 
I am also afraid that Judge Jackson 
did not always adhere to her own ad-
monition that judges should stay in 
their lane. In the case Make the Road 
New York v. McAleenan, the American 
Civil Liberties Union challenged a reg-
ulation involving expedited removal of 
individuals who illegally cross our bor-
ders and enter into the country. 
The Immigration and Nationality 
Act gives the Department of Homeland 
Security 
Secretary 
‘‘sole 
and 
unreviewable discretion’’ to apply ex-
pedited removal proceedings. Judge 
Jackson, who presided over the case 
challenging that rule, ignored the law. 
She went beyond the unambiguous text 
to deliver a political win to the people 
who brought the lawsuit.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1954 
April 5, 2022 
She barred the Department of Home-
land Security from using expedited re-
moval proceedings to deter illegal im-
migration. She stopped the administra-
tion from enacting immigration poli-
cies it had clear authority to imple-
ment according to the black-letter law. 
Unsurprisingly, that decision was ap-
pealed and ultimately overturned by 
the DC Court of Appeals. But this is an 
example of not staying in your lane 
and not deferring to Congress the au-
thority to make the laws of the land 
when the Congress has been unambig-
uously clear. 
So, ultimately, I believe that dem-
onstrates a willingness to engage in ju-
dicial activism and achieve a result, 
notwithstanding the facts and the 
black-letter law in the case, and to dis-
regard the law in favor of a political 
win for one of the parties. 
But this is just exactly what I start-
ed off talking about. This is the oppo-
site of consent of the governed, when 
judges ignore the laws passed by Con-
gress, even when congressional intent 
is clear. 
Unfortunately, that wasn’t the only 
example of activism in Judge Jack-
son’s decisions. We have heard a lot 
about this, and I think it was an en-
tirely appropriate subject for questions 
and answers. Judge Jackson is an ac-
complished and seasoned lawyer and 
judge, and she knows how to answer 
hard questions. 
During sentencing hearings, Judge 
Jackson has said she disagreed with 
certain sentencing enhancements for 
policy reasons. That is the word she 
used—for policy reasons—and she chose 
to disregard its application. That is not 
staying in your lane. 
She also used a compassionate re-
lease motion to retroactively slash a 
dangerous drug dealer’s criminal sen-
tence because she didn’t like that the 
government brought a mandatory min-
imum drug charge, even though the 
government had every right to do so 
under the applicable law. 
The promise of equal justice under 
the law requires judges to follow the 
law regardless of their own personal 
feelings 
about 
the 
policy. 
Justice 
Scalia famously said that if a judge 
hasn’t at one time or another in his or 
her career rendered a judgment that 
conflicts with their own personal pref-
erences, then they are probably not 
doing their job right. 
It is absolutely critical for our Su-
preme Court Justice to not only ac-
knowledge but to respect the limited 
but important role that our judges play 
in our constitutional Republic. They 
shouldn’t allow politics or policy pref-
erences to impact their decisions from 
the Bench, and they can’t use their 
power to invalidate the will of the 
American people based on invisible 
rights that aren’t actually included in 
the Constitution itself. 
In 1953, Judge Robert Jackson ob-
served that the Supreme Court is ‘‘not 
final because [it is] infallible, but [it is] 
infallible only because [it is] final.’’ 
In other words, the recourse that we 
the people have when judges overstep 
their bounds when it comes to con-
stitutional interpretation is to amend 
the 
Constitution 
itself—something 
that has only happened 27 times in our 
Nation’s history—and it is a steep hill 
to climb, to be sure. 
But it is important for the legit-
imacy of the Supreme Court itself for 
the judges to be seen as staying in 
their lane and interpreting the law, not 
making it up as they go along. I am re-
minded of another quote about the 
scope of the Judiciary’s duties and 
powers. 
In 
1820, 
Thomas 
Jefferson 
wrote, ‘‘To consider the judges as the 
ultimate arbiters of all constitutional 
questions [is] a very dangerous doc-
trine indeed, and one which would 
place us under the despotism of an oli-
garchy.’’ 
Once 
again, 
our 
Founders, 
our 
Founding Fathers, had the wisdom to 
establish three branches of government 
to share power to avoid any single per-
son or institution from wielding abso-
lute power, and to ensure that we 
maintain the proper balance of power, 
Justices need to stay in their lane and 
interpret the law, not make the law, 
particularly when the voters have de-
nied consent from them for doing so. 
So to summarize, to ensure that we 
maintain the proper balance of power 
under our Constitution, judges must 
only interpret the law and they can’t 
allow activism to bleed into their deci-
sions and they can’t ignore black-letter 
law and they can’t use doctrines like 
substantive due process to hide the fact 
that they are making up new rights 
that aren’t contained anywhere in the 
written Constitution itself. 
As I said before, I fear that, if con-
firmed, Judge Jackson will attempt to 
use her vast legal skills to deliver spe-
cific results and get outside of her lane 
by making judge-made laws that are 
not supported by the text of the Con-
stitution itself. As I said in the Judici-
ary Committee, and I will say again, 
when the time comes to vote on Judge 
Jackson’s nomination here on the Sen-
ate floor, I will once again vote no for 
the reasons I just stated. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 3951 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, I rise 
today to urge the Senate to take ac-
tion to crack down on child pornog-
raphy offenders and to protect our chil-
dren. This is a growing crisis, and it is 
one that is near to the heart of every 
parent in America. I can attest to that 
as a father of three small children my-
self. I have got a 9-year-old, a 7-year- 
old, and a 16-month-old baby at home. 
But I can also attest to it as a former 
prosecutor. As the attorney general for 
the State of Missouri, one of the first 
things I did was establish a statewide 
anti-human trafficking initiative and 
task force because what I saw as attor-
ney general of my State was that 
human trafficking, including, unfortu-
nately, child sex trafficking, is an ex-
ploding epidemic. 
In my State and around our country, 
children are exploited, children are 
trafficked. And those who work in this 
area and those who prosecute in this 
area—law enforcement who work day 
in and day out—will tell you that the 
explosion of child pornography is help-
ing to drive this exploding epidemic of 
child sexual exploitation and child sex 
trafficking. 
The problem is that child porn itself 
is exploding. A New York Times inves-
tigative reporter found that in 2018, 
there were 45 million images of chil-
dren being sexually exploited available 
on the internet—45 million. Just a few 
years before, it had been 3 million and 
in 2018, 45. Then, last year, the Na-
tional Center for Missing and Exploited 
Children found that that number had 
grown to 85 million—85 million images 
on the internet of children being bru-
tally sexually exploited. 
And as every prosecutor and every 
law enforcement advocate and every 
law enforcement agent who works in 
this area will tell you, that explosion 
of this material—which, by the way, is 
harmful in and of itself, is exploitative 
in and of itself—is driving a crisis of 
child exploitation and child sex traf-
ficking in this country. 
Now the nomination of Judge Ketanji 
Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court 
has helped bring this issue front and 
center. Her record of leniency to child 
sex offenders has been much at the cen-
ter of her hearings, and it has startled 
the public. A recent Rasmussen survey 
found that following her hearings, 56 
percent of all respondents said that 
they were troubled by her record on 
child sex offenders. That included 64 
percent of Independents. 
And they are right to be troubled. 
Her record is indeed startling. In every 
case involving child pornography where 
she had discretion, she sentenced below 
the 
Federal 
sentencing 
guidelines, 
below the prosecutor’s recommenda-
tions, and below the national averages. 
We now know that the national aver-
age for possession of child pornog-
raphy—the national sentence imposed, 
on average, is 68 months. Judge Jack-
son’s average is 29.3 months. The na-
tional average sentence for distribu-
tion of child pornography: 135 months; 
Judge Jackson’s average, 71.9 months. 
In fact, it is true for criminal sen-
tencing across the board. The national 
average of all criminal sentences im-
posed in the United States, 45 months; 
Judge Jackson’s average, 29.9 months. 
This is a record of leniency. In the 
words of the Republican leader, leni-
ency to the ‘‘extreme’’ to child sex of-
fenders and on criminal matters in gen-
eral. 
But—but, but, but—we are told, and 
have been told for weeks on end now, it 
is not really her fault. We were told by 
the White House and Senate Democrats 
that it is not her fault because those 
Federal sentencing guidelines that she, 
in every case where she could went 
below—those guidelines aren’t binding. 
Thanks to the decision by the Supreme

S1955 
April 5, 2022 
Court, by Justice Breyer and Justice 
Stevens, those guidelines are only ad-
visory. And so we were told, repeat-
edly, that if we really want to get 
tougher sentences for child porn of-
fenders, then we are going to have to 
change the law. 
In fact, I see my friend Senator DUR-
BIN here today, the chairman of the Ju-
diciary Committee. He said this to me 
multiple times during the committee. 
On March 22, he said to me: 
I hope we all agree that we want to do ev-
erything in our power . . . to lessen the inci-
dence of pornography and exploitation of 
children. . . . I . . . want to tell you, Con-
gress doesn’t have clean hands. . . . We 
haven’t touched this for 15, 16 or 17 years. 
Senator DURBIN went on: 
We have created a situation because of our 
inattention and unwillingness to tackle an 
extremely controversial area in Congress and 
left it to the judges. And I think we have to 
accept some responsibility. 
And he went on: 
I don’t know if you— 
Meaning me— 
have sponsored a bill to change this. I will be 
looking for it. . . . If we’re going to tackle it, 
we should. 
Well, I agree with that 100 percent. I 
agree we should tackle it. This is the 
time to tackle it, and I am here to do 
that today. I am proud to sponsor and 
introduce legislation along with my 
fellow Senators MIKE LEE and THOM 
TILLIS and RICK SCOTT and TED CRUZ to 
get tough on child porn offenders. 
Now, let’s be clear. When Congress 
wrote the child pornography Federal 
sentencing guidelines, and it is Con-
gress that wrote them substantially, 
way back in 2003—when Congress wrote 
them, they wanted them to be binding. 
Congress meant for these guidelines to 
bind Federal judges. The Supreme 
Court struck those guidelines down. 
Now it is time to put it back into 
place. My bill would put a new manda-
tory—mandatory—sentence of 5 years 
for every child porn offender who pos-
sesses pornography, 5 years. If you do 
this crime, you ought to go to jail. It 
would make the guidelines binding for 
any and all facts found by a jury or 
found by a judge in a trial, restore the 
law to what Congress intended back in 
2003, take away discretion from judges 
to be soft on crime, and get tough on 
child sex offenders. That is what this 
bill would do. 
Now, I called this bill the Protect 
Act of 2022 because it is modeled on the 
PROTECT Act of 2003, when Congress 
wrote these guidelines. And I would 
just note for the record that I believe 
every Senator voted for it back in 2003, 
including the chairman of the Judici-
ary Committee, Senator DURBIN, and 
every member of the Judiciary Com-
mittee, Republican and Democratic, 
who was serving at the time. 
That act back in 2003 toughened pen-
alties for child porn offenders, made 
the guidelines mandatory, and explic-
itly took away discretion from judges 
to sentence below the guidelines. 
I think it was a pretty good law, and 
I think now is the time to act. Our 
children are at risk. The epidemic of 
sexual assault, sexual exploitation, and 
victimization is real. 
And let’s be clear what child pornog-
raphy is. It is an industry—an industry 
that feeds on the exploitation of the 
most vulnerable members of our soci-
ety, that feeds on the spectator sport 
of child abuse and child victimization. 
If you have a lot of images of child 
pornography, you ought to go to jail 
for a long time. If you possess child 
pornography, you ought to go to jail 
for at least 5 years. And, yes, it is time 
for every judge in America to get tough 
on child porn. That is what this bill 
would do, and I urge the Senate now to 
take this opportunity to act. 
So as if in legislative session, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary be discharged 
from further consideration of S. 3951, 
and the Senate proceed to its imme-
diate consideration; I further ask that 
the bill be considered read a third time 
and passed and that the motion to re-
consider be considered made and laid 
upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The majority whip. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserv-
ing the right to object. I have to ask 
myself, why now? Why does the junior 
Senator from Missouri bring this bill 
to the floor of the U.S. Senate today? 
When you think back, this matter 
has been considered. Originally, the 
guidelines were considered in 1984. The 
question of child pornography came 
back to us in 2003. 
In 2005, there was a Supreme Court 
case about applying the guidelines on 
sentencing to these types of cases—a 
case known as Booker. We know that 
in 2005, that decision was handed down. 
We know that in 2012, the Sentencing 
Commission said to Congress and to 
the world that you need to do some-
thing here. These guidelines that you 
promulgated don’t reflect the reality of 
today. 
We know, as well, that the guidelines 
were written—some were written in an 
era when the materials we are talking 
about were physical materials. And we 
now live in the world of internet and 
access to not just tens and hundreds 
but thousands of images, if that is your 
decision. 
And all these things have happened, 
and we come here today—today. I don’t 
know exactly how many years the Sen-
ator from Missouri has been in the Sen-
ate, but to my knowledge, this is his 
first bill on this subject that he has 
presented in the last few weeks. And I 
wonder why—why now? 
Are there valid questions about sen-
tencing guidelines? Certainly, there is 
no question about it. I said as much, 
and he quoted me. 
The Sentencing Commission told us 
over a decade ago, in 2012: You have got 
a problem here. The world has changed, 
and the law doesn’t reflect it. 
But this is the first time, to my 
knowledge, that the Senator from Mis-
souri or any Republican Senator has 
tried to enact legislation on the sub-
ject. Why now? Well, I know why. He 
said as much. It is because we are now 
considering the nomination of Judge 
Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme 
Court. 
This Senator has suggested over the 
course of the last 2 weeks in hearings 
before the Senate Judiciary Committee 
that somehow this judge—this judge 
who is aspiring to the Supreme Court— 
is out of the mainstream when it comes 
to sentencing in child pornography 
cases. 
It is no coincidence that the Senator 
from Missouri comes to the floor today 
while Judge Jackson’s nomination is 
pending on the Senate calendar. It was 
discharged from our committee by a bi-
partisan vote in the Senate last night. 
It is no coincidence that he is raising 
this issue within hours or days before 
her confirmation vote. It is one more, 
very transparent attempt to link Judge 
Ketanji Brown Jackson’s confirmation 
with this highly emotional issue of 
Federal sentencing when it comes to 
child pornography or child exploi-
tation. 
There are some political groups—at 
least one well-known political group— 
that manufacture theories about child 
pornography, pedophilia, and the like 
and that even inspire deadly reactions 
to them, and they are cheering this on. 
I have seen their reactions already, 
this morning, in the newspaper. They 
are watching this and hoping that 
someone can keep this issue alive on 
the floor of the U.S. Senate—for them. 
The Senator from Missouri has even 
gone so far as to make the outrageous 
claim that this woman, Judge Jack-
son—the mother of two wonderful girls, 
whom I had a chance to meet, a mother 
who comes to this issue not only as a 
judge but as the sister and niece of law 
enforcement officials who have been 
part of her family—in the words of the 
Senator 
from 
Missouri, 
that 
this 
woman ‘‘endangers children’’—‘‘endan-
gers children.’’ 
Mr. HAWLEY. Will the Senator yield 
for a question? 
Mr. DURBIN. I will yield when I am 
finished. 
One conservative former prosecutor 
called 
Senator 
HAWLEY’s 
charges 
‘‘meritless to the point of dema-
goguery.’’ 
I have read so many reviews of the 
Senator’s charges against this judicial 
nominee, and not one of them gives 
him any credence. They basically say: 
What you are dealing with here is a 
complicated area of the law, a con-
troversial area of the law, and to try to 
ascribe to this one nominee these mo-
tives, these outcomes, is baseless and 
meritless. 
Consider this: How can this judicial 
nominee possibly have the endorse-
ment of the largest law enforcement 
organization 
in 
America—the 
Fra-
ternal Order of Police—the endorse-
ment of the International Association 
of Chiefs of Police, and many other law

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1956 
April 5, 2022 
enforcement groups—how could she 
possibly have all of that and be as 
wrong on a critical issue as the Sen-
ator from Missouri has asserted? 
How is it possible that the American 
Bar Association took a look at all of 
her contacts as a judge, as a lawyer, as 
a law student and came up with 250 in-
dividuals who knew her personally, ap-
peared in court with and against her, 
judged her in her individual capacity as 
a lawyer—how can the American Bar 
Association interview those 250 and 
find no evidence of the charges that 
have been made by the Senator from 
Missouri? How is it possible that they 
would review all of this and miss such 
a glaring fact? They didn’t. 
They told us, under oath, that they 
were asked point blank: Is her sen-
tencing standard soft on crime? dif-
ferent than other judges? 
The answer was no, no. 
The net result of it was that the 
American Bar Association found this 
nominee, whom the Senator from Mis-
souri 
charges 
with 
these 
outrage 
claims—they found her to be unani-
mously ‘‘well qualified’’—unanimously 
‘‘well qualified.’’ Yet the Senator from 
Missouri believes that he has discov-
ered something that the whole world 
has missed. Unfortunately, he is wrong, 
and he doesn’t admit it. 
When Judge Jackson is confirmed to 
the Supreme Court—and I pray that 
she will be later this week—it will be 
in part because she is a thoughtful, 
dedicated person who has worked as a 
judge for over 10 years. She has pub-
lished almost 600 written opinions. She 
has had 100 cases wherein she has im-
posed criminal sentences and a dozen- 
plus cases involving children. 
What the Senator from Missouri has 
done is to cherry-pick arguments from 
one small part of her service on the 
bench that has been debunked across 
the board. But let me say it again: 
Judge Jackson’s sentences were appro-
priate exercises of discretion as a judge 
in applying the law to the facts in dif-
ficult cases. 
It is interesting to me how the Sen-
ator from Missouri has carefully drawn 
lines to exclude Trump appointees to 
the bench who have done exactly what 
this judge has done as well—so-called 
deviate from the guidelines when it has 
come to sentencing. In fact, one judge 
from his State, from the Eastern Dis-
trict of Missouri, whom he has person-
ally endorsed as a good judge—and he 
may well be—has followed the same 
practice as this judge. Did he raise that 
at all in the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee about the Missouri judge who 
was doing the same thing as Judge 
Jackson? No, nothing. 
There is nothing about these judges 
that is deviating from other-than-ac-
cepted practices. When 70 to 80 percent 
of sentences handed out by judges 
across America are using the same 
standard, Judge Jackson is in that 
mainstream, along with judges whom 
this Senator from Missouri has en-
dorsed. 
If this issue needs to be addressed— 
and I believe it does—we can do so if we 
do it carefully, and we should do it 
carefully. Make no mistake, I don’t 
back off from my words. As a father, as 
a grandfather, as a caring parent, I sin-
cerely consider this to be one of the 
most serious crimes—the exploitation 
of children. I can’t think of anything 
worse. 
The pornography issue certainly is 
out of control because of the internet 
and because of those who are making a 
dollar on it. We should take it very se-
riously—very seriously. It changes and 
destroys lives. But let’s make sure we 
do this in the right way. 
What have we done in the Senate Ju-
diciary Committee? 
It is great for the chairman to stand 
on the Senate floor and talk about the 
issue. 
Well, what have you done, Senator? 
Let me tell you what I have done, 
and I think the Senator from Missouri 
knows it. 
We have done what we can to address 
this issue from many different angles. 
The committee held a hearing on the 
FBI’s failure to properly investigate al-
legations against Larry Nassar for as-
saulting young athletes, Olympic gym-
nasts included, which enabled the 
abuse of dozens of additional victims. 
We called them on the carpet. We put 
them under oath. We brought the testi-
mony forward. We didn’t back away 
from the issue of child abuse. 
Following that hearing, I introduced 
the Eliminating Limits to Justice for 
Child Sex Abuse Victims Act, with 
Senator MARSHA BLACKBURN, a Repub-
lican from Tennessee. The Senate has 
now passed this bipartisan legislation, 
which would enable those survivors of 
child sex abuse to seek civil damages 
in Federal court no matter how long it 
takes the survivor to disclose the facts 
of the case. 
The committee has also unanimously 
reported a bill which the Senator from 
Missouri knows well, the EARN IT Act, 
which is legislation he has cosponsored 
with Democratic Senator BLUMENTHAL 
that will remove blanket immunity for 
the tech industry for violations of laws 
related to online child sexual abuse 
material. 
I make no apologies for our approach 
on this, and there is more work to be 
done. 
I want to tell you that I am tempted 
to leave it just at that but for one part, 
one thing I am concerned about. 
Our Federal sentencing guidelines 
have been advisory, not mandatory, 
since the Supreme Court’s 2005 ruling 
in the Booker case. This bill now being 
offered on the floor in a very quick 
fashion by the Senator from Missouri 
attempts to create mandatory sen-
tencing guidelines for a single category 
of offense. It is not clear whether it 
passes the constitutional test of Book-
er. It could be a waste of time. We 
don’t need to waste time in a critical 
area of the law that has been so con-
troversial and has been considered and 
reviewed over decades. 
Even so, it is a dangerous slope to go 
down. Imagine a world wherein every 
time it was politically advantageous— 
whether it was a Supreme Court nomi-
nee or a headline in the paper—that 
some Senator could come forward, dis-
agree with a Federal judge in a par-
ticular case, and say: Let’s pass a man-
datory minimum sentencing guideline 
to take care of the matter. 
That is no way to approach the law 
in a fashion that is used for deterrence 
and 
punishment. 
We 
need 
to 
be 
thoughtful about it. A subject of this 
seriousness, of this gravity, deserves 
more than a driveby on the floor of the 
U.S. Senate. 
I invite my colleague to do his work 
on this issue as we all should—the 
work that is required, the work that is 
required by the seriousness of this mat-
ter. 
I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Missouri. 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, the 
Senator asks: ‘‘Why now?’’ Why act 
now? 
It is because it is a crisis now, be-
cause there are 85 million images of 
children being exploited on the inter-
net now, because child exploitation is 
exploding in this country now. 
Today, the Senator lays bare on this 
floor the bait and switch that he and 
his colleagues have employed. 
They say: Oh, Judge Jackson—it is 
not her fault. You should act on the 
law to change the law. 
But when we come to change the law 
and do what this Congress did in 2003, 
to do it now in 2022—a measure that 
Senator DURBIN supported in 2003—he 
says: Oh, no, no, we don’t need to act 
now. Why do it now? It is rushed. It is 
too hurried. Let’s do it later. Let’s 
think about it longer. 
Then we hear recited again the bi-
zarre claims that somehow child por-
nography is a conspiracy theory. This 
is something that Senate Democrats, 
including the chairman, have repeated 
over and over and over, led by the 
White House—the idea that child ex-
ploitation is a conspiracy theory. 
I would just invite you to look any 
parent in America in the eye and tell 
them that the exploitation of children 
is a conspiracy theory—or any law en-
forcement agent or any prosecutor or 
anyone who is working on the exploi-
tation, to combat the exploitation of 
children in this country. No. It is a cri-
sis, and it is real. The fact that the 
Senate hasn’t acted until now is, I 
think, shameful for the Senate. But 
why wait another day? 
Now, I look forward, if the Senator is 
serious. He does hold the gavel in the 
Judiciary Committee. We could mark 
this bill up. We could hold hearings. We 
could take action. I would invite him 
to cosponsor this bill. He voted for it in 
2003. Let’s have hearings, then, if we 
can’t vote on it today, if we can’t de-
bate it today. Let’s have hearings. 
Let’s mark it up. Let’s take it seri-
ously. I will wait. I suspect I will be 
waiting for an awfully long time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1957 
April 5, 2022 
Here is the bottom line: I am not 
willing to tell the parents of my State 
that I sat by and did nothing. I am not 
willing to dismiss child exploitation as 
just some conspiracy theory. I am not 
willing to abandon the victims of this 
crime to their own devices and say: 
Good luck to you. 
No, I am not willing to do that—nor 
am I willing to excuse Judge Jackson’s 
record of leniency that does need to be 
corrected. She should not have had the 
discretion to sentence leniently in the 
extreme, as she did, nor should any 
judge in America, in my view. What is 
sauce for the goose is sauce for the 
gander. We should fix it for everybody 
across the board, and we can begin by 
acting as we did in 2003. 
So I am disappointed, but I can’t say 
that I am surprised that this measure 
has been objected to today. All I can 
say is that I pledge to my constitu-
ents—I pledge to the parents of my 
State and, yes, to the victims of my 
State—that I will continue to come to 
this floor and that I will continue to 
seek passage of this act until we get 
action from this Senate to protect chil-
dren and to punish child pornog-
raphers. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, after 27 
minutes of debate on the floor of the 
Senate, the Senator now believes we 
are prepared to change the law that 
has been debated for decades. He has 
put in a bill introduced 7 days ago. It 
has been 7 days he has had passion for 
this issue—enough to introduce legisla-
tion. 
If you want to take on a serious 
issue, take it on seriously, and that 
means doing the homework on it. Yes, 
have a hearing. Of course, have a hear-
ing. We want to make sure the people 
from the Sentencing Commission and 
others are part of this conversation. It 
isn’t just a matter of throwing charges 
out against a nominee. 
If you want to be serious about it, 
then admit the obvious: In 70 to 80 per-
cent of cases involving child sexual 
abuse material, Federal judges struggle 
with the same sentencing that we have 
set down. In light of Supreme Court de-
cisions, we understand—I ask for order, 
Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. There 
was no response to begin with to the 
Senator, so let’s move forward. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I will 
say, as far as I am concerned, this is a 
serious matter that should be taken se-
riously. You don’t become an expert 
by, 7 days ago, introducing a bill and 
saying: I have got it. Don’t change a 
word of it. Make it the law of the land. 
Make it apply to every court in the 
land. 
No. We are going to do this seriously. 
We are going to do it the right way, 
and we are going to tackle an issue 
that has been avoided for more than 
two decades, when you look at the his-
tory of it. 
I find this reprehensible—the pornog-
raphy, this exploitation of children— 
and there are no excuses whatsoever, 
but I am not going to do this in a slip-
shod, make-a-headline manner. We are 
going to do it in a manner that is seri-
ous, one in which we work with pros-
ecutors, defenders, judges, and the Sen-
tencing Commission, and get it right. 
It is time to get it right. 
We wrote this law some 19 years ago, 
before the internet was as prevalent in 
society as it is today. Let us be mind-
ful of that as we attack this problem 
and address it in a fashion that is befit-
ting the Senate and the Senate Judici-
ary Committee. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri. 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, the 
Senator from Illinois says that Con-
gress hasn’t acted in two decades; that 
is true. I haven’t been here for two dec-
ades; he has. 
There is no excuse to not take action 
now. There is no excuse to not act on 
this problem when we know what the 
solution is. 
So, listen, if the Senator is saying 
today, if he is committing today, to 
holding hearings and marking up a bill 
to toughen the child pornography laws, 
to make mandatory the sentencing 
guidelines, that is fantastic. I will take 
him at his word. I look forward to see-
ing those hearings noticed and to see-
ing that markup noticed, and I hope it 
will be forthcoming. 
I am here to make a prediction. I 
think we will be waiting a very long 
time, because let’s not forget what his 
party and the Sentencing Commission, 
stacked with members of his party, 
have been recommending. It has not 
been to make child sentences tougher— 
child pornography sentences tougher. 
They have wanted to make them weak-
er. 
What the Sentencing Commission has 
recommended, with its liberal members 
for years now, is to make them weaker. 
That is what Judge Jackson has advo-
cated. She also wants to change the 
guidelines—to make them weaker. 
I think that is exactly the wrong 
move, and that is why the Senator was 
here to block this effort today. He 
doesn’t want there to be tougher sen-
tences. He doesn’t want to talk about 
this issue. He wants to sweep it under 
the rug. I am here to say I won’t let 
that happen. I will be here as long as it 
takes. I will be advocating for this in 
the Senate Judiciary Committee as 
long as it takes, until we get justice for 
the victims of child pornography and 
child exploitation. 
I yield the floor.

the previous order, the Senate stands

EXECUTIVE CALENDAR—Continued 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Arkansas. 
NOMINATION OF KETANJI BROWN JACKSON 
Mr. COTTON. Madam President, the 
Senate will soon vote on the nomina-
tion of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson 
to be Associate Justice of the Supreme 
Court. I will vote against her nomina-
tion. 
Judge Jackson may be a fine woman, 
but she is a dangerous judge. She built 
her career as a far-left activist, and it 
didn’t change when she put on a robe 10 
years ago. She personifies activism 
from the bench. She has crusaded to 
undermine criminal sentences, and she 
cannot be trusted to interpret the law 
or the Constitution as written. 
Judge Jackson’s record makes clear 
that her brief stint as a criminal de-
fense attorney wasn’t motivated mere-
ly by a devotion to equal representa-
tion of all. It was part of a deep com-
mitment to leniency for criminals. In-
deed, she has continued to act as a de 
facto lawyer for criminals from behind 
the bench as she did from in front of it. 
Judge Jackson’s average sentences 
for criminals are 34 percent lighter 
than the national average for criminal 
cases and 25 percent lighter than her 
own court’s average, the DC District 
Court. 
Disturbingly, some of the most sen-
sational examples of her soft-on-crime 
attitudes are cases involving child por-
nographers. She has given more lenient 
sentences than recommended by the 
sentencing guidelines in every single 
child pornography case where the law 
allowed it—every single one, every 
time. Individuals sentenced by Judge 
Jackson for child pornography posses-
sion receive, on average, 57 percent 
lighter sentences compared to the na-
tional average. For child pornography 
distribution, the sentence is 47 percent 
lighter than the national average. 
These aren’t just numbers. These are 
predators, and they go on to commit 
more of the most heinous crimes imag-
inable because Judge Jackson lets 
them off so easy. In one case, Judge 
Jackson gave child pornographer Wes-
ley Hawkins just 3 months—3 months— 
in prison when the sentencing guide-
lines recommended 8 to 10 years—3 
months versus a recommended 8 to 10 
years. Judge Jackson even gave him a 
sentence that was one-sixth as long as 
what her own probation office rec-
ommended. And a few years later, when 
Hawkins should have still been in pris-
on for his original offense, he did some-
thing else that got him 6 more months 
in custody. That is twice as long as his 
original sentence. 
When all 11 Republicans on the Judi-
ciary Committee sent a letter asking 
for details of what happened to justify 
this new sentence, Judge Jackson re-
fused to provide any further informa-
tion—so much, I guess, for looking at 
her record, as she urged us to do. 
Her leniency isn’t limited to child 
pornographers, either. In 2017, Judge

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1958 
April 5, 2022 
Jackson apologized—she apologized—to 
a fentanyl kingpin—his own words: 
kingpin—because she couldn’t find a 
way to sidestep the law to give him 
less than the mandatory minimum sen-
tence. She was very sorry that she had 
to give him such a long sentence. 
But I guess, where there is a will, 
there is a way. A few years ago, she 
found a way to resentence this self-de-
scribed kingpin below the mandatory 
minimum sentence. Through a com-
pletely 
made-up 
reinterpretation, 
Judge Jackson made the First Step Act 
retroactive for this fentanyl kingpin, 
something 
Congress 
had 
explicitly 
tried to avoid when it passed the law. 
This was judicial activism, plain and 
simple. 
In her testimony, Judge Jackson 
claimed that there were no victims in 
that case. She is wrong. Fentanyl traf-
ficking is not a victimless crime, and 
anyone who doesn’t understand that 
doesn’t belong on the Supreme Court. 
In 
another 
case, 
Judge 
Jackson 
granted compassionate release—com-
passionate release—to a man who bru-
tally murdered a deputy U.S. marshal 
on the steps of a church at a funeral. 
While in prison, this cop killer threat-
ened prison staff and was caught in 
possession of a dangerous weapon—not 
exactly a model inmate. He was repeat-
edly denied parole. Yet Judge Jackson 
granted him compassionate release be-
cause he had high blood pressure. 
In yet another case, a career criminal 
assaulted a deputy U.S. marshal with a 
deadly weapon while resisting arrest. 
This was the third time that this 
criminal had assaulted law enforce-
ment officers—the very officers who 
risk their lives to keep judges like 
Judge Jackson safe. 
Judge Jackson didn’t just sentence 
him below the government’s request or 
the sentencing guideline range. She 
gave the criminal less time than even 
the criminal himself had advocated. 
You can’t make this stuff up. 
In 2013, a sex offender who had re-
peatedly raped his 13-year-old niece 
was arrested for falsifying sex offender 
registration records to avoid telling 
the government where he was living 
and that he was working at a daycare. 
The government sought a 2-year prison 
sentence, but Judge Jackson gave him 
just 1 year instead. And during that 
second year, when he would have been 
in prison, he tried to rape again and 
then bribed the victim with $2,500 to 
recant her testimony. This dangerous 
sex offender was convicted of obstruct-
ing justice, yet when presented with a 
do-over, Judge Jackson sentenced him 
to just 24 months in prison for those 
violations. I wish I could say this was 
to her credit because, to be fair, 24 
months was the sentence recommended 
by the government. But she ensured in 
her order that this sentence would run 
concurrently with his sentence in local 
DC jail so he only ended up serving 1 
year instead of 2. 
Judge 
Jackson 
habitually 
sym-
pathizes with criminals over victims. 
These are just a few of the many out-
rageous 
cases 
in 
Judge 
Jackson’s 
record. The takeaway is crystal clear: 
If you are a criminal, you would be 
lucky to have your case assigned to 
Judge Jackson. If you are a victim or 
anyone else seeking justice, you should 
hope that your case is assigned to lit-
erally any other judge. As a trial judge, 
though, Judge Jackson could only help 
one criminal at a time. As a Supreme 
Court Justice, she would be able to 
benefit criminals nationwide, in all 
cases. 
Judge Jackson’s far-left activism ex-
tends beyond crime, as well. Not only 
did she engage in what the Sixth Cir-
cuit called an ‘‘end run around Con-
gress’’ to retroactively reduce the sen-
tence of the fentanyl kingpin I men-
tioned earlier, she also worked hard to 
strike down a Trump administration 
order expediting the removal of illegal 
aliens 
on 
equally 
specious 
legal 
grounds. 
The law passed by Congress granted 
the Department of Homeland Security 
‘‘sole and unreviewable’’ discretion— 
‘‘sole and unreviewable’’ discretion—to 
decide which illegal aliens should be 
subject to expedited removal. Nonethe-
less, Judge Jackson inserted herself to 
strike down what she called ‘‘a terrible 
policy’’ by the Department of Home-
land Security. Well, I regret to inform 
Judge Jackson that it is not her role in 
our system to decide whether immigra-
tion policy is good, bad, terrible, or 
any other adjective she wants to use, 
only whether it is lawful and author-
ized by law. 
And, of course, the DC Circuit Court, 
which is not exactly a hotbed of con-
servative jurists, agreed and reversed 
Judge Jackson’s decision noting that 
there ‘‘could hardly be a more defini-
tive expression of congressional in-
tent’’ than the language in that law 
that she disregarded. But Judge Jack-
son didn’t care. She had an anti-Trump 
op-ed she wanted to write in the form 
of a judicial opinion. 
Judge Jackson has also shown real 
interest in helping terrorists. It is true 
you shouldn’t judge a lawyer for being 
willing to take on an unpopular case, 
but you can certainly learn something 
about a lawyer whose cases they seek 
out. And for Judge Jackson and her 
friends in the liberal legal profession, 
these cases were not unpopular at all. 
Judge Jackson represented four terror-
ists as a public defender, one of whom 
she continued to represent in private 
practice voluntarily, and she volun-
tarily filed multiple friend-of-the-court 
briefs on behalf of terrorists while in 
private practice. 
To make matters worse, she appar-
ently didn’t even bother—when she was 
representing 
these 
terrorists, 
she 
didn’t bother to establish a reasonable 
belief that what she filed with the 
court was factually true. Three of her 
four case filings were identical—word 
for word, comma for comma. She al-
leged identical facts and legal argu-
ments in each case. The only dif-
ferences between the briefs were the 
names and the case numbers. And in 
every one of those cases, she claimed 
the terrorists had never had any affili-
ation with the Taliban or al-Qaida. And 
in every one of those cases, she accused 
the Bush administration and American 
soldiers of war crimes. 
And who are these supposed innocent 
victims of American war crimes who, 
according to Judge Jackson, had noth-
ing at all to do with terrorism, no 
siree, nothing at all? One of her clients 
designed the prototype shoe bomb that 
was used in an unsuccessful attempt to 
blow up a passenger airplane. Another 
planned and executed a rocket attack 
on U.S. forces in Afghanistan. And a 
third was arrested in a raid on an al- 
Qaida explosives training camp. Yet in 
every case, she claimed that none of 
them had anything to do with ter-
rorism—not a thing, totally innocent, 
just goatherders who were picked up by 
marauding American troops. 
You know, the last Judge Jackson 
left the Supreme Court to go to 
Nuremburg and prosecute the case 
against the Nazis. This Judge Jackson 
might have gone there to defend them. 
Judge Jackson also refused to answer 
one commonsense question after an-
other. For example, when Senator 
BLACKBURN asked her what a ‘‘woman’’ 
is, she pretended not to know. I asked 
her who has more of a right to be in the 
United States, new citizens who follow 
the rules or illegal aliens whose very 
first act in the United States was to 
break our laws. Judge Jackson refused 
to answer. 
When I asked the simple question of 
Judge 
Jackson 
whether 
releasing 
Guantanamo 
Bay 
terrorists 
would 
make us more safe or less safe, she 
again pretended not to know the an-
swer, even though it is published by 
the Biden administration. 
I also asked Judge Jackson if crimi-
nals were more or less likely to com-
mit a crime if they knew they would be 
caught, convicted, and sentenced. I 
asked this pretty basic question at 
least three times. It was not a hard 
question; yet, again, she refused to an-
swer. 
Judge Jackson also refused to say 
whether packing the Supreme Court 
was a bad idea, even though the judge 
for whom she clerked and seeks to re-
place, Justice Breyer, and the late, 
sainted Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg— 
neither of whom are known for their 
conservative views—were both willing 
to publicly denounce such court-pack-
ing schemes by the Democrats. 
Judge Jackson may feign ignorance, 
not because she doesn’t know these an-
swers, but because liberal judicial phi-
losophy is all too often based on deny-
ing reality. As a judge, Judge Jackson 
has denied that reality again and 
again. 
Judge 
Jackson 
will 
coddle 
criminals and terrorists, and she will 
twist or ignore the law to reach the re-
sult that she wants. That is not what 
we need in a Supreme Court Justice, 
and that is why I will be voting against 
her nomination.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1959 
April 5, 2022 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from South Dakota. 
BUDGET PROPOSAL 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, if a 
budget is a set of priorities, here are 
the President’s: an expanded Federal 
Government, a diminished national de-
fense, higher gas prices, and an open 
border. Those are the priorities re-
flected in the budget the President re-
leased last week, which contained pret-
ty much what you would expect—more 
taxes, more spending, more borrowing, 
and, in all likelihood, more inflation as 
a result. 
Big taxes and big spending have been 
the agenda for President Biden since he 
took office. After signing a $1.9 trillion 
spending spree in March of 2021 that 
helped create the worst inflation in 40 
years, President Biden spent much of 
last year pushing for still more spend-
ing to fund his vision of an expanded 
Federal Government. 
In his 2023 budget, it is just more of 
the 
same. 
The 
President’s 
budget 
would increase average yearly spending 
by 66 percent as compared to the aver-
age of the last 10 years. Sixty-six per-
cent—that is a staggering spending in-
crease. Yearly Federal spending under 
the Biden budget would average $7.3 
trillion. To put that in perspective, the 
total average spending in 2019 was $4.4 
trillion. 
How is the President going to pay for 
this, if he even can? Taxes, a lot of 
taxes—‘‘the biggest tax increase in his-
tory in dollar terms,’’ according to 
Bloomberg. 
The President, of course, attempts to 
sell the tax hikes he is proposing as 
something that won’t affect ordinary 
Americans. That couldn’t be more 
wrong. 
That corporate tax hike that he 
keeps pushing—one study estimates 
that 31 percent of the corporate tax is 
borne by consumers. Another big por-
tion of it is borne by labor, otherwise 
known 
as 
ordinary, 
hard-working 
Americans. 
Higher prices, fewer jobs, lower sala-
ries—we can expect to see all that and 
more if the President hikes taxes on 
companies. And I haven’t even men-
tioned the fact that a corporate tax 
hike may end up hurting private pen-
sions 
in 
the 
value 
of 
American’s 
401(k)s. 
Then there are the tax hikes on con-
ventional energy companies, the com-
panies that produce the oil and gas 
that Americans use to heat their 
homes and to drive their cars. Increas-
ing taxes on fossil fuel companies to 
the tune of tens of billions of dollars is 
pretty much guaranteed to discourage 
the additional energy production we 
need to drive down gas prices. Iron-
ically, the proposals to go after tradi-
tional American energy production 
come from the same administration 
that is releasing oil from the Strategic 
Petroleum Reserve to deal with high 
gas prices. You can’t make this up. 
Then there is inflation. Democrats 
helped create our current inflation cri-
sis by sending a lot of unnecessary gov-
ernment money into the economy via 
the so-called American Rescue Plan. 
The President’s budget would essen-
tially do the same thing, which means 
our already serious inflation crisis 
could get even worse. 
I mentioned the big spending in-
creases in the President’s budget. But 
what I actually meant are the big non-
defense spending increases because, 
while on paper it may look like the 
President is hiking defense spending, 
his supposed funding increase would be 
effectively canceled out by inflation. 
When you take into account Demo-
crats’ historic inflation, it turns out 
President 
Biden’s 
supposed 
defense 
spending increase could actually turn 
out to be a spending cut. Even in the 
best-case scenario, his budget would 
leave defense spending essentially flat, 
which would leave our military dan-
gerously underfunded. That is a big 
problem. 
In a rapidly evolving threat environ-
ment, the last thing we can afford is a 
self-inflicted defeat from underfunding 
our military. Given Russia’s war of ag-
gression in Ukraine and threats to 
NATO, 
an 
increasingly 
aggressive 
China, Iran’s nuclear ambitions, North 
Korea’s uptick in missile tests, and the 
Taliban taking over in Afghanistan, 
among other things, President Biden 
should be taking national defense 
spending at least as seriously as do-
mestic spending, but he is not. 
The Biden budget proposal would 
leave the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, 
Air Force, and Space Force under-
equipped and undermanned and put our 
defense planning on a dangerously in-
sufficient trajectory. 
The President’s budget also fails to 
adequately address border security and 
immigration enforcement. 
Almost since the day the President 
took office, we have been experiencing 
an unprecedented flood of illegal immi-
gration across our southern border. In 
fiscal year 2021, the Border Patrol en-
countered more than 1.7 million indi-
viduals attempting to cross our south-
ern border, the highest number ever re-
corded. We have had 12 straight months 
of border encounters in excess of 
150,000, and the surge is likely to even 
get worse now that the President has 
rescinded the title 42 border policy to 
immediately deport individuals ille-
gally attempting to cross the border. 
What is the President’s answer? 
Well, $150-million cut to the U.S. Im-
migration and Customs Enforcement 
next year. That is right. We are experi-
encing an unprecedented surge of ille-
gal immigration, and the President’s 
budget would cut funding to Immigra-
tion and Customs Enforcement. 
Perhaps the most outrageous thing 
about the President’s budget is the way 
he misrepresents it. He is now trying 
to portray himself as somewhat fis-
cally responsible, as if a 66 percent 
higher yearly average spending than 
the last 10 years could be considered 
fiscally responsible. The President is 
talking a lot about deficit reduction— 
both the deficit reduction he has sup-
posedly created and the deficit reduc-
tion 
his 
budget 
will 
supposedly 
produce. 
But the actual numbers will, again, 
tell a very different story. The deficit 
reduction the President would like to 
take credit for is partly the result of 
the end of temporary COVID spending 
measures, which were scheduled to end 
whether the President lifted a finger or 
not. Our current deficit would have 
been a lot lower if the President hadn’t 
decided that we needed a partisan $1.9 
trillion spending spree last year, a 
spending 
spree 
entirely—entirely— 
made up of deficit spending. 
When it comes to the President’s 2023 
budget, 
the 
administration 
claims 
‘‘deficits under the budget policies 
would fall to less than one-third of the 
2020 level the President inherited.’’ 
The key phrase there is ‘‘the 2020 
level the President inherited.’’ And 2020 
saw a huge but temporary surge in gov-
ernment spending to deal with the 
onset of the COVID crisis. 
As a result, it is grossly deceptive to 
take the 2020 deficit as a baseline. A 
more honest assessment of the pros-
pects for deficit reduction under the 
President’s budget would look at pre- 
COVID deficits as a baseline and com-
pare the President’s future deficits to 
those, but that wouldn’t suit the Presi-
dent’s purposes. 
Now that it has become apparent 
that the American people are not, in 
fact, thrilled by far-left Democratic 
governance, the President is eager to 
portray himself as a moderate—hence 
his inflated claims of deficit reduction. 
It is the same reason the President is 
touting his supposed spending hike on 
national defense while conveniently 
omitting the fact that when you figure 
in real inflation, the spending hike 
may actually be a spending cut. 
No matter how the President tries to 
dress it up, his fiscal year 2023 budget 
is more of the same far-left priorities— 
more taxes, more unnecessary spend-
ing, and more economic pain for the 
American people. 
And I hope, I hope my Democratic 
colleagues will think twice before 
foisting this budget onto hard-working 
Americans. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

NOMINATION OF KETANJI BROWN JACKSON

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1960 
April 5, 2022 
District of Columbia Circuit, will take 
the seat on the Supreme Court that 
Justice Stephen Breyer has held for al-
most three decades, so I would like to 
first offer a few words about Justice 
Breyer as he prepares to step down 
from the Bench. 
Justice Breyer has served the Court 
and the Nation with grace, expertise, 
humility, brilliance, and an unwaver-
ing dedication to justice. He has 
worked tirelessly to build consensus 
among his colleagues, and he has al-
ways kept in mind the real-world im-
pacts of the Court’s decisions on the 
American people. 
Justice Breyer knew that ‘‘justice for 
some’’ was a failure of the Court. From 
his opinions on voting rights to repro-
ductive rights, to the Affordable Care 
Act, he has been a key voice in many 
historic decisions that have affected so 
many Americans. We owe him a great 
debt of gratitude. And I am honored 
and privileged to call Justice Breyer a 
dear friend, and I wish him the best in 
his retirement. 
Now, in looking for Justice Breyer’s 
successor, President Biden said that he 
wanted to nominate a ‘‘persuasive’’ 
Justice, someone in the mold of Justice 
Breyer, and with Judge Ketanji Brown 
Jackson, President Biden has found 
that person. 
I am confident that Judge Jackson— 
who clerked for Justice Breyer on the 
Supreme Court—will follow in his foot-
steps as a Justice who will make a last-
ing contribution on the Court through 
her pragmatism, evenhandedness, and 
deep understanding of the Constitution 
and the impact that the Court’s deci-
sions have on all Americans. 
And as the first African-American 
woman Justice on the Bench, Judge 
Jackson’s historic nomination is an 
important and long overdue step to-
ward making the Supreme Court better 
reflect the Nation whose people the 
Court serves. 
Fifty-four years ago yesterday, our 
Nation, our world, lost the guiding 
light of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., to 
assassination. That loss was incalcu-
lable. We can only imagine the society 
we would live in if Dr. King were still 
with us, preaching, marching, teach-
ing, and I have no doubt that Dr. King 
would be on the steps of the Capitol as 
the loudest and proudest voice in sup-
port of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson 
to be our next Supreme Court Justice 
and the first Black woman to serve on 
our highest Court. 
He would know that with the ap-
pointment and confirmation of Judge 
Jackson, we would take the long over-
due step to make the Nation’s top 
Court look more like and better rep-
resent all of the American people. 
The legacy of the more just, more 
equal society that Dr. King pushed us 
to create is alive and it is well in this 
confirmation and on the floor and hear-
ing rooms of the U.S. Senate this week. 
The Judiciary Committee held 4 days 
of hearings on Judge Jackson’s nomi-
nation, including 2 days of testimony 
from the judge herself. As we all saw, 
some of the questioning of Judge Jack-
son from some of my Republican col-
leagues was nothing short of offensive, 
distorting her record, and tinged with 
racism and sexism. But Judge Jackson 
responded with poise. She responded 
with brilliance. She calmly addressed 
and corrected her questioners’ false 
and misleading premises. 
And she did so while demonstrating 
deep knowledge of the law and the Con-
stitution, respect for precedents, and 
displaying precisely the kind of tem-
perament we expect of someone sitting 
on the Nation’s highest Court. 
The hearings showed the Nation that 
Judge Jackson possesses all of the es-
sential qualities of a jurist committed 
to the words engraved above the en-
trance to the Supreme Court itself 
‘‘Equal Justice Under Law.’’ 
Of course, to anyone who knew Judge 
Jackson before her introduction to the 
Nation as a Supreme Court nominee, 
none of this was surprising. Judge 
Jackson’s qualifications to serve on 
the Supreme Court are second to none. 
She holds broad experience across the 
legal profession—as a Supreme Court 
clerk, as a Federal public defender, as 
an attorney in private practice, and as 
a member of the U.S. Sentencing Com-
mission, as a Federal district court 
judge, and as a Federal appellate judge. 
It was, therefore, surprising to no 
one that she earned a unanimous ‘‘well 
qualified’’ rating from the American 
Bar Association. Let me speak for a 
moment about one aspect of Judge 
Jackson’s background that stands out, 
and that is her experience as a public 
defender. 
When confirmed, Judge Jackson will 
become the first-ever Justice with 
background as a public defender and 
the first Justice with significant crimi-
nal defense experience since the service 
of Justice Thurgood Marshall, who re-
tired in 1991. That work as a Federal 
public defender has unjustly come 
under 
attack 
from 
my 
colleagues 
across the aisle who suggest that being 
a public defender means that she is soft 
on crime. 
But my Republican colleagues—who 
far too often focus singularly on the 
constitutional right to bear arms— 
would do well to remember that among 
the 
Constitution’s 
other 
enshrined 
rights is the Sixth Amendment’s right 
to counsel in criminal cases. Without 
that right, criminal defendants who 
cannot afford an attorney would find it 
difficult or impossible to navigate the 
Court system with their rights pro-
tected, 
including 
the 
fundamental 
right to a speedy and fair trial. 
My Republican friends may also want 
to consider that Judge Jackson comes 
from a law enforcement family, with a 
brother and uncle serving as police of-
ficers, and that she has won the en-
dorsement of the Fraternal Order of 
Police, the Nation’s largest police 
union. 
Now, let me remind my colleagues 
that public defenders do not select 
their client. They take on every as-
signed case because they are com-
mitted to preserving and defending 
constitutional rights for everyone. As a 
Federal public defender, Judge Jackson 
represented the most vulnerable among 
us. She represented the clients other 
lawyers avoided, and in doing so, she 
followed a long and honorable tradition 
in the American legal profession that 
began with John Adams stepping for-
ward in 1770 to represent the British 
soldiers who committed the Boston 
Massacre because he feared that they 
would not receive a fair trial without 
adequate representation. 
By confirming Judge Jackson, we 
will affirm that the rights of those who 
cannot afford a lawyer are just as im-
portant as the rights of those who can 
pay lawyers charging $1,000 an hour; 
that the rights of the indigent and 
powerless are just as important as 
those of the rich and the powerful. 
Public 
defenders 
also 
experience 
firsthand and, therefore, understand 
better than other lawyers just how our 
justice system treats the accused, how 
it treats people of color, how it treats 
low-income people. Every day, public 
defenders see the systemic biases and 
prejudices that permeate our criminal 
justice system. 
At a time when the United States 
holds more people behind bars than any 
other Nation on Earth—including au-
thoritarian regimes like North Korea 
and China—the highest Court in the 
land would greatly benefit from a Jus-
tice with a public defender background. 
Public defenders serve as a unique bul-
wark of liberty and racial justice. So 
we should welcome a public defender 
on the Supreme Court, especially one 
as well qualified as Judge Jackson. Her 
singular perspective and voice are sore-
ly needed. 
Judge Jackson’s service as a trial 
judge on the U.S. District Court for the 
District of Columbia is also of par-
ticular note in this nomination. Only 
one of the current Supreme Court Jus-
tices—Justice 
Sotomayor—has 
ever 
served on a trial court. And as a trial 
court judge, Judge Jackson worked to 
ensure the parties before her under-
stood her approach to deciding cases. 
Judge Jackson has explained that, as 
a trial judge, she emphasized speaking 
directly to the individuals who ap-
peared before her, not just to their law-
yers. She used the parties’ names and 
treated them with respect. She sought 
to ensure that those whom her rulings 
would directly impact clearly under-
stood the proceedings in which they 
were involved, what was happening, 
and why it was happening. 
This approach speaks to a judge who 
understands the importance of accessi-
bility to the law, to a judicial process 
that isn’t shrouded in mystery, and to 
a system that fulfills its promise of 
equal justice under the law to every-
one. We will be fortunate to have such 
a Justice on the Supreme Court of the 
United States. 
I have had the opportunity to meet 
with Judge Jackson one-on-one. I came

away deeply impressed and convinced 
that President Biden has made a great 
choice. The Senate has already con-
firmed Judge Jackson three times on a 
bipartisan 
basis—most 
recently 
in 
June of 2021, when she was confirmed 
to the D.C. Circuit. The Senate should 
again confirm her with bipartisan sup-
port. 
And when Judge Jackson is con-
firmed and becomes Justice Jackson, 
the first African-American woman ever 
to take a seat on the High Court, she 
will be an inspiration to so many 
across our country and around the 
globe. She will especially be a role 
model for young Black girls every-
where, showing them that in the 
United States of America, nothing is 
beyond their reach.

I urge all of my colleagues to vote to 
confirm Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson 
to the Supreme Court of the United

WOMEN VETERANS’ HEALTHCARE 
Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President, I 
rise today to recognize the significant 
legislative victories the Senate re-
cently delivered for women veterans 
with the passage of two pieces of legis-
lation to modernize breast cancer 
screening polices and the delivery of 
lifesaving care for women veterans. 
Breast cancer is the second most 
common cancer for women. For women 
veterans and servicemembers, the inci-
dence of breast cancer is estimated to 
be up to 40 percent higher than the 
general population. 
Given the dangerous environments in 
which military members serve and ad-
ditional risk factors associated with 
these locations, it is long overdue for 
the Department of Veterans Affairs to 
update its policies for administering 
mammograms. 
We know early detection is crucial to 
preventing and treating breast cancer, 
so making sure those who are more 
vulnerable receive screenings at a 
younger age is not only reasonable but 
critical. 
This would have helped Dr. Kate Hen-
dricks Thomas, a Marine veteran, who 
was unaware of her increased risk for 
breast cancer. She shared her memo-
ries of deployment to Fallujah in 2005 
with the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Com-
mittee last year. 
She understood the risk associated 
with IEDs, and she remembers the burn 
pits—so commonplace, they were large-
ly ignored—but she wasn’t concerned 
with the impact of what she called 
‘‘the flaming poison’’ surrounding her 
would have on her own health. 
In a routine medical appointment 
with her VHA health provider in 2018, 
Kate thought it was odd she was rec-
ommended to undergo a mammogram. 
That exam subsequently led to her di-
agnosis of stage IV breast cancer. She 
was 38 years old. 
That is devastating news for anyone 
to face, and I know the entire Senate 
joins me in praying for Kate as she 
continues her fight against cancer. 
Nobody would blame her for focusing 
on her own health battle, but she 
knows her story wouldn’t be the last if 
something didn’t change. 
That is why Kate is being an advo-
cate for modernizing VA policies so 
other veterans don’t experience the 
same struggles she is living with. 
We honored her activism by crafting 
and passing the Dr. Kate Hendricks 
Thomas Supporting Expanded Review 
for Veterans in Combat Environments 
Act. It will broaden veteran access to 
mammograms and also require the VA 
to compile data regarding the rates of 
breast cancer among members of the 
veteran and civilian population so we 
can continue improving procedures to 
better treat breast cancer patients. 
The Senate also unanimously passed 
the MAMMO for Veterans Act to ex-
pand access to high-quality breast can-
cer 
screenings, 
improving 
imaging 
services in rural areas, and clinical 
trials through partnerships with the 
National Cancer Institute. 
The VA is uniquely positioned to be a 
leader in the prevention and treatment 
of breast cancer. Taking full advantage 
of the Department’s unique capabili-
ties, resources, and outreach will help 
deliver the lifesaving care that vet-
erans deserve. 
Passage of the Dr. Kate Hendricks 
Thomas 
SERVICE 
Act 
and 
the 
MAMMO for Veterans Act reflects the 
bipartisan support for improving vet-
eran services and benefits. I appreciate 
Senator WYDEN’s support and the lead-
ership in the Senate Veterans’ Affairs 
Committee and the leadership of Sen-
ate Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chair-
man TESTER, who has been my reliable 
partner in advancing policies to im-
prove the VA’s care and services for 
women. 
The VA estimates women make up 10 
percent of our Nation’s veteran popu-
lation and continues to be the fastest 
growing population. 
Last Congress, we made significant 
progress to expand VA’s care and serv-
ices for women with the passage of the 
landmark Deborah Sampson Act. 
This was an important first step, and 
the legislation we passed last month 
continues to build on this foundation 
so we can fulfill the promise made to 
women who served in our Nation’s uni-
form. 
I am pleased the Senate has approved 
these policies, and I urge my col-
leagues in the House of Representa-
tives to follow our example and quickly 
approve the Dr. Kate Hendricks Thom-
as SERVICE Act and the MAMMO for 
Veterans Act so that they can be 
signed into law. 
The women who have served our 
country in uniform need to know we 
are taking every step available to pro-
tect their health. These bills are an im-
portant downpayment in that mission. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
REMEMBERING THOMAS HORACE PORTER 
Ms. DUCKWORTH. Madam President, 
I come to the floor today to mourn the 
passing and celebrate the life of Thom-
as Horace Porter, my good friend and a 
man who could put a smile on my face 
even in the toughest times, on one of 
the most painful days of my life, while 
I was recovering at Walter Reed. 
Among the peer visitors at Walter 
Reed Hospital, two of the most beloved 
were Tom and his wife Eleanor. 
Tom was a gentle giant—a tall, smil-
ing, 
then-74-year-old 
veteran 
who 
showed up at my bedside while I was 
still sedated to talk with my husband 
and mother and who came to visit 
again soon after I regained conscious-
ness. 
As a young Army lieutenant in the 
Korean war, Tom had lost both his legs 
in a landmine explosion. His heroic ac-
tions saving his men on that day 
earned Tom both the Silver Star in ad-
dition to the Purple Heart for his com-
bat injuries. 
During his months of recuperation 
back in the States, Eleanor—or El, as 
we all know her—an Army second lieu-
tenant herself, had been one of his 
physical therapists. 
The couple ended up married for 
more than 50 years. Tom continued to 
serve our Nation—this time as a civil 
servant, achieving the rank of Senior 
Executive Service in the Department 
of Agriculture. When Operations Iraqi 
Freedom and Enduring Freedom began 
and the wounded began flooding the 
wards at Walter Reed, Tom and El de-
cided that they needed to help. They 
became peer visitors, and for the next 7 
years, during twice weekly visits, they 
changed the lives of countless veterans 
who passed through that hospital, my 
own included. 
When I was at Walter Reed, Tom 
made it his mission to talk with in-
jured troops about the full lives they 
will lead after their devastating inju-
ries. 
A lot of the wounded warriors around 
me were really young, just 19 to 24 
years old, lying in their hospital beds 
with limbs missing, burns to their 
faces and bodies, skulls crushed and en-
cased in protective metal cages or hel-
mets. They were all facing a future 
none of them had planned for. Like 
them, I had always assumed I would ei-
ther die in combat or come home. The 
third option of coming home severely 
injured was never something that oc-
curred to the majority of us. 
Tom would walk in with that big 
smile of his and say: Hey, I was like 
you. Lost my legs at 22. But I recovered 
and I have had a full and regular life. I 
courted El after I lost my legs, and she 
and I have been married for 50 years 
and have wonderful kids and grandkids.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1962 
April 5, 2022 
He reassured them that they could 
still have the lives they dreamed of, 
and his words had weight because he 
was living proof that that was possible. 
He would wink and joke: Listen, hav-
ing an amputation is better than hav-
ing a puppy. Trust me, you won’t have 
any trouble getting the ladies. 
And then he would answer any ques-
tions they had because he knew they 
needed to hear from someone who had 
already journeyed on the road they 
were about to travel. 
For years, Tom and El came into 
Walter Reed every Tuesday and Thurs-
day without fail. El was known as the 
Cookie Lady because she would bring 
in dozens of homemade cookies that 
she collected from folks at her church. 
For those of us who were in the hos-
pital a long time, El knew our favor-
ites. Mine were oatmeal raisin. If I was 
at physical therapy or in surgery or 
getting my wounds debrided when El 
made her rounds, she would make sure 
to leave a little bag of cookies by my 
bedside table. It was a real treat in the 
midst of the painful, early stages of re-
covery—something to look forward to 
every week. 
Tom and El. El and Tom. The two of 
them became family for all of us. They 
would bring me and my husband to 
their lakeside home, feed us home- 
cooked meals, and let me fall asleep in 
their hammock overlooking the water, 
knowing the good that getting out of 
that 
fluorescent-lit 
hospital 
room 
would do me. 
As someone who loved and was des-
perately missing the ocean, I can’t 
begin to describe how restorative those 
days by the lake were. 
There are no words for how right it 
felt to be drifting off to sleep to the 
sound of waves hitting the shore rather 
than to the beeps and the buzz of the 
hospital machines that had been my 
nightly soundtrack for too long. 
And there is no possible way to ex-
press just how grateful I am to Tom 
and El for making that a possibility; 
for giving me a taste of home, right 
when I felt most like a stranger to my-
self; for enveloping me in something 
good and whole right when I felt 
untethered from what I felt was my 
life’s mission; and for simply being who 
they were—kind and fierce, as compas-
sionate for the people they loved as 
they were passionate about the causes 
that they believed in. 
They were our advocates, our heroes, 
our Tom and our El. 
I am so sorry for your loss, El. We 
miss Tom every single day. Thank you 
both for all you did for me and what 
you did for all of us. We miss you des-
perately. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
NOMINATION OF KETANJI BROWN JACKSON 
Mr. REED. Madam President, we are 
debating the President’s nominee to 
succeed Justice Stephen Breyer, who 
has served this country admirably and 
with great distinction. 
As a law student, I was fortunate to 
have Justice Breyer as an adviser, and 
I remain grateful for his guidance, en-
couragement, and counsel as I began 
my legal career. I have immense re-
spect and admiration for him as a Jus-
tice, but even more so as a person. 
When Justice Breyer announced his 
retirement, I stated my belief that the 
next Justice on the Supreme Court 
should 
be 
someone 
with 
Justice 
Breyer’s integrity, independence, and 
keen 
intellect—someone 
with 
real- 
world experience who reflects the depth 
and breadth of the American people. 
You could not find someone who better 
fits 
that 
description 
than 
Judge 
Ketanji Brown Jackson, and I rise 
today in wholehearted support of her 
nomination to the Supreme Court. 
The Supreme Court is a powerful ar-
biter of justice in our Nation, with few 
checks on the decisions of the Justices 
once they are on the Court. Therefore, 
a vote on a Supreme Court nominee is 
one of the most consequential that any 
Senator can cast. The Constitution 
makes the Senate an active partici-
pant, along with the President, in the 
confirmation of a Supreme Court Jus-
tice. 
Article II, section 2, clause 2 of the 
Constitution states that nominees to 
the Supreme Court shall only be con-
firmed ‘‘by and with the Advice and 
Consent of the Senate.’’ The Senate’s 
role in the confirmation process places 
an important democratic check on 
America’s judiciary. As a result, this 
body’s consent is both a constitutional 
requirement and a democratic obliga-
tion. It is in upholding our constitu-
tional duties as Senators to give the 
President advice and consent on his 
nominations that I believe we have one 
of our greatest opportunities and re-
sponsibilities to support and defend the 
Constitution of the United States. 
As I have stated before, my test for a 
nominee is simple and is drawn from 
the text, the history, and the principles 
of the Constitution. A nominee’s intel-
lectual gifts, experience, judgment, 
maturity, and temperament are all im-
portant, 
but 
these 
alone 
are 
not 
enough. I need to be convinced that a 
nominee for the U.S. Supreme Court 
will live up to both the letter and spirit 
of the Constitution. The nominee needs 
to be committed not only to enforcing 
laws but also to doing justice. 
The nominee needs to be able to 
make the principles of the Constitution 
come alive—equality before the law, 
due process, full and equal participa-
tion in the civic and social life of 
America for all Americans, freedom of 
conscience, individual responsibility, 
and the expansion of opportunity. The 
nominee also needs to see the unique 
role the Court plays in helping balance 
the often conflicting forces in a democ-
racy between individual autonomy and 
the obligations of community, between 
the will of the majority and the rights 
of the minority. A nominee for the Su-
preme Court needs to be able to look 
forward to the future, not just back-
wards. The nominee needs to make the 
Constitution resonate in a world that 
is changing with great rapidity. 
Judge Jackson passes these tests 
with flying colors. Beyond her unques-
tioned intellectual gifts, her legal ca-
reer over the past two decades dem-
onstrates that she has the deep fidelity 
to equality, justice, and the Constitu-
tion required to be our next Supreme 
Court Justice. 
We want Justices to be familiar with 
the Federal court system. Judge Jack-
son is. Indeed, soon after law school, 
Judge Jackson chose to clerk at three 
levels of the Federal courts, gaining 
valuable insights into the courtroom 
and learning directly from incredible 
jurists, including Judge Bruce Selya of 
Rhode Island, who was President Rea-
gan’s nominee to the U.S. Court of Ap-
peals for the First Circuit, as well as 
Justice Breyer himself. 
We want Justices to understand that 
a guilty verdict involves the hard task 
of deciding the appropriate punish-
ment. So while many of her law school 
classmates likely plotted paths to law 
firm partnerships, she chose instead to 
serve as Assistant Special Counsel and, 
later, Commissioner and Vice Chair at 
the 
U.S. 
Sentencing 
Commission, 
working to prevent unjust disparities 
in sentencing. 
We want Justices to embody the fun-
damental notion of fairness at the 
heart of our justice system, that de-
fendants have a right to counsel and 
must be proven guilty beyond a reason-
able doubt. So Judge Jackson chose to 
serve as a Federal public defender. If 
confirmed, she will bring this valuable, 
real-life perspective to our highest 
Court, where it is very much needed. 
Over the past 10 years, first as a dis-
trict judge and then as a circuit judge, 
Judge Jackson has been evenhanded 
and impartial in her decisions from the 
bench, without regard to partisanship, 
personal views, or ideology. Her opin-
ions showcase an admirable commit-
ment not only to fairness but to trans-
parency. She takes the time to ensure 
that the parties fully understand her 
rulings and that the record clearly cap-
tures her thought process in deciding a 
case. She does not hide the ball—there 
are facts, there are arguments, and ev-
eryone is invited to read and under-
stand them. 
Beyond her career choices and acco-
lades, she demonstrated her judgment, 
maturity, and equanimity during her 
recent confirmation hearings. In the 
face of hours of questioning, some of it 
quite 
pointed, 
political, 
and 
discomfiting, she showed incredible pa-
tience, resilience, and grace. Her inde-
pendence, integrity, and deep under-
standing of the Constitution shined 
through in her answers. Her cool in 
that crucible was not only admirable, 
it was inspiring. 
Judge Jackson is a trailblazer, not in 
the least because she is the first Black 
woman and first Federal public de-
fender 
nominated 
to 
the 
Supreme

plishments are personal, Judge Jack-

Court will bring America closer to the

ENERGY 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
come to the floor today to talk about 
the need for more American energy. 
On Thursday, President Biden an-
nounced that he is going to release 
even more oil from the Strategic Pe-
troleum Reserve. To me, this is an-
other desperate Hail Mary pass. It is a 
short-term effort to deal with their 
midterm election crisis. It is a crisis 
that has been created by the policies of 
this administration. 
The real crisis is the cost-of-living 
crisis, and it is a crisis that is pun-
ishing American families. Inflation is 
at a 40-year high. Gas prices recently 
hit the highest price ever. Why is it 
happening? It is economics 101. The 
supply of energy is not keeping up with 
the demand for energy. 
We are now producing about 1.3 mil-
lion barrels of oil per day fewer—less— 
than we were in 2019. Yet, for the last 
14 months that Joe Biden has been in 
the White House, he has done abso-
lutely nothing to increase the supply of 
American energy. He has not sold one 
lease to produce energy on public 
lands—not one. President Obama, at 
this time into his first term, had al-
ready held 47 Federal lease sales—in 
his first 14 months in office. For Joe 
Biden, the number is still zero. 
This just shows that when it comes 
to energy, Joe Biden is to the far, far 
left of any previous American Presi-
dent. Joe Biden is already the most 
anti-American energy President we 
have ever had. He refuses to do any of 
the things that would actually help our 
country in terms of our energy needs. 
He won’t increase oil production by a 
single drop. No. He wants to release 
some from the strategic reserve but 
not actually produce any more Amer-
ican energy. 
What he is essentially doing is burn-
ing through our savings account. This 
is now the third time that President 
Biden has released energy from the 
strategic reserve. He is on pace to burn 
through a third of our oil savings in 
less than 2 years in office. Soon, we are 
going to have the smallest amount in 
our reserve, the smallest amount in 
our savings account, since 1984. 
In November, Joe Biden conducted 
the largest release in history from the 
strategic reserve. He released 50 mil-
lion barrels. So what was the result? 
He made a big announcement of it. The 
Secretary of Energy did as well. The 
price of gas went down by 2 cents—2 
cents. The White House was so proud of 
itself that they actually sent out a 
press 
release 
congratulating 
them-
selves. Prices went back up almost im-
mediately. The result was an utter fail-
ure. So now Joe Biden said he is going 
to release 180 million barrels over the 
next 6 months, which is a million bar-
rels a day for the next 180 days—in 
other words, between now and right be-
fore the elections. 
The strategic reserve is meant for 
emergencies. It is not meant for the 
cynical, political coverup of what the 
President has done to our American en-
ergy policy. Some people call it an 
election-year gimmick. I call it dan-
gerous—dangerous 
because 
we 
are 
going to be less prepared for emer-
gencies and be less secure as a nation. 
We will be less safe. 
Now, 180 million barrels sounds like a 
lot. It is about the amount we use on 
an average of 9 or 10 days. We use 
about 20 million barrels a day in the 
United States. We are currently im-
porting a lot more than that. 
Even the President admits that it 
won’t have a big impact, but he doesn’t 
know what else to do. On Thursday, he 
said this would reduce prices by as lit-
tle as 10 cents a gallon. We are still 
over $4 a gallon nationwide in terms of 
the national average. I expect it is 
going to remain that high, over $4 a 
gallon, through the summer. 
So who do the American people 
blame for this? Well, in poll after poll, 
they blame Joe Biden because he is the 
one who proudly stood there and beat 
his chest and said: I have killed the 
Keystone XL Pipeline. 
The day Joe Biden took office, gaso-
line was $2.38 a gallon. America was en-
ergy independent for the first time in 
70 years. We were energy dominant. We 
were exporting energy. We were selling 
it to our friends instead of having to 
buy it from our enemies. Joe Biden 
took 
office 
and 
started 
attacking 
American energy, and things have de-
teriorated ever since. 
That is why it is no surprise that en-
ergy and gas prices were up 13 out of 
the last 14 months. By the time Vladi-
mir Putin invaded Ukraine, the aver-
age price of a gallon of gas had gone up 
from $2.38 gallon to $3.53 a gallon. So it 
was already up over $1.15 a gallon in 
just over that first year in office for 
President Biden. Today, the average 
price of a gallon of gas is about $4.18. 
Prices may actually go higher if Joe 
Biden gets his way in terms of energy 
policy. That is because, when the 
President put out his budget, we found 
he wants to raise taxes on American 
energy. The budget that the President 
has proposed for the next year contains 
36 new taxes, and 11 of them are di-
rectly on American energy. It would 
cost about $45 billion, which, of course, 
would be carried on to the people who 
buy American energy. It would be paid 
by working families in the form of 
higher gas prices, higher oil bills. It 
would cost more to heat your home. 
Even NANCY PELOSI, when she looked 
at the budget, said: 
Consumers pay for that. 
On Thursday, Joe Biden asked Con-
gress to charge fees on oil and gas 
leases that aren’t even being used. 
Now, this is another gimmick. People 
want to use those leases, but the ad-
ministration is blocking the permis-
sion to drill to use the leases. This is 
just a continuation of the Biden blame 
game. 
If you want to explore for energy in 
America, the lease is just the first step, 
the first of many. You need to apply 
for a permit to drill. In Wyoming, peo-
ple know all about this. They call it an 
APD, an application for the permission 
to drill. You have to pay to apply after 
you have paid the rent on the lease. 
So you apply, and somebody has to 
make a decision. Those decisions used 
to be made at the local level. Not any-
more. Now the Biden administration 
has said: We know better than any of 
you people out around the country. We 
will make all of the decisions out of 
Washington. 
The decision they have made is they 
are not going to give any of these per-
mits to drill. That is why the President 
could say: They are not drilling. 
Well, you are not letting people drill. 
Now, we are not talking about a cou-
ple of leases; we are talking about 
thousands and thousands—over 4,000 
leases—that are tied up that way. 
We have another group of leases that 
is tied up by environmental activists 
who love to sue to stop energy explo-
ration. They want to keep it in the 
ground. 
So companies are paying their rental 
fees. They want to explore for energy, 
but they are being blocked by the ad-
ministration. Then they are being 
blamed by that same administration 
for not exploring for energy. 
The President says: Use it or lose it. 
Well, that is the law of the land right 
now. If it doesn’t produce oil or gas 
within 10 years, you actually lose the 
permit. He doesn’t want to explain that 
to folks. 
If the lease does produce energy, if it 
does produce oil, then the government 
actually reaps the benefits from that. 
They get tax money from that. That 
helps to pay for many of the things 
that we do as a government. In Wyo-
ming, in our State areas, we use it to 
help with paying for education, with 
paying for healthcare. These are vital 
services in the community that are 
paid for by the successful exploration 
and recovery of energy that is cur-
rently underground and that Joe Biden 
wants to keep underground.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1964 
April 5, 2022 
In the President’s budget, he wants 
to charge an additional fee on top of all 
of this. So he refuses to let them drill, 
and he wants to charge them for not 
drilling. This is something out of 
‘‘Alice in Wonderland.’’ More fees will 
mean producing less. We need to 
produce more. That is the way to get 
down 
the 
price 
at 
the 
pump—to 
produce more American energy. 
Democrats refuse to admit that the 
percentage of leases that are actually 
being used today has never been high-
er. These are old leases. The Demo-
crats’ excuses on this issue are what I 
would put in the category of the Big 
Lie—the Big Lie to support an anti- 
American energy agenda. It is an agen-
da of less American energy, more 
taxes, and higher prices. It is the rea-
son millions of American families 
today are struggling to get by. They 
are feeling the pain. 
According to one estimate from 
economists at Bloomberg, American 
families will spend an extra $5,200 this 
year—that is $100 a week—compared to 
last year, just to stay even. It is all due 
to inflation in the cost of groceries, the 
cost of gas, the cost of goods. All of 
those things are squeezing American 
families. People are getting crushed. 
Their dreams are being crushed. Poten-
tial savings to send kids to college— 
that is going away. The savings for a 
vacation—that is going away. You have 
to empty your wallet to fill your tank 
under Joe Biden’s energy policies, and 
the extra $100 a week is on top of last 
year’s inflation whereby people across 
the country said they were paying 
more and more to get less and less and 
that even if they got a raise, they 
couldn’t keep up. They have kept fall-
ing further and further behind. 
People across the country are al-
ready living paycheck to paycheck. 
They can’t afford more price increases. 
They need real solutions, and they are 
not getting them from this White 
House. The answer seems pretty sim-
ple: Stop the reckless spending here in 
Washington. Unleash American energy. 
President Biden needs to do a couple 
of things right away to unleash Amer-
ican energy. 
The first is to have a long-term com-
mitment to produce more American 
energy. Energy companies aren’t going 
to invest if they think Joe Biden is 
going to shut them down tomorrow, 
and in a recent speech, he said that is 
what his goal is. He wants them to 
produce more today so he can shut 
them down tomorrow. 
He does need to open up our Federal 
lands. We should auction off leases 
right away, and Joe Biden should ap-
prove those 4,600 drilling permits, 
which, today, are still stuck in limbo. 
He put them there and locked them in. 
It takes months to get production up 
and running. You have to get the right 
permits. You have to tap the pipelines. 
You have to speed up the process for 
pipelines as well. Although we did see 
the Federal Energy Regulatory Com-
mission—all of the Commissioners— 
come to the Energy Committee, they 
don’t seem to be very interested—at 
least the ones in the majority don’t 
seem to be very interested—in speeding 
up the pipeline process or in allowing 
pipelines at all. 
Finally, Joe Biden needs to stop at-
tacking the hard-working men and 
women of this country who continue to 
produce energy, who go to work every 
day to keep the lights on and to keep 
us warm in winter. We need these 
workers out there, and Joe Biden needs 
to stop attacking them on a daily 
basis. They are the ones who can get us 
out of the crisis. They are the ones we 
need for the economic recovery. 
Instead of spending our savings, it is 
time to unleash American energy. We 
need more American energy, and we 
need it now.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1965 
April 5, 2022 
H.R. 4373 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I want 
there to be no mistake about what just 
happened here on the Senate floor. Re-
publicans blocked a bipartisan bill that 
would provide vaccines, testing, and 
therapeutics for the American people. 
Yesterday, a group of Democrats and 
Republicans announced we had reached 
a bipartisan agreement for COVID re-
lief funding, but today, a majority of 
Senate Republicans have blocked this 
critical and much-needed funding from 
going forward. 
Vaccines, therapeutics, and testing 
were negotiated in good faith. And it 
should not—they should not be held 
hostage 
to 
extraneous, 
unrelated 
issues. This is too important for the 
health of the American people. But 
that seems precisely what some Repub-
licans want to do. 
This is a potentially devastating vote 
for every single American who is wor-
ried about the possibility of a new vari-
ant rearing its nasty head within a few 
months. 
It is devastating for any American 
who, in the future, looks for a vaccine 
or a booster shot, only to be told sup-
plies have run out. 
It is devastating for anyone looking 
down the line to get tested because 
they feel sick or want their families 
safe and discover no tests are available. 
It is devastating for anyone who—God 
forbid—falls seriously ill but can’t ac-
cess lifesaving therapeutics because 
the Federal Government can’t purchase 
new supplies because of the vote our 
colleagues on the Republican side of 
the aisle just took. 
Too many Republicans seem to want 
to play politics at a time when we need 
to work together to pass legislation 
our country desperately needs. Repub-
licans voted no on vaccines for kids. 
Republicans voted no on tests for new 
COVID variants. Republicans voted no 
on therapies to save lives and make us 
less sick. 
Have we learned nothing from the 
last 2 years of living with this horrible 
disease? 
Have 
Republicans 
learned 
nothing about how lack of preparation 
could 
damage 
our 
economy? 
This 
money—the money that they rejected 
today—will go a long way to keeping 
our 
schools, 
our 
businesses, 
our 
churches, our communities running as 
normally as possible. 
If we want to stay at normal, we need 
these dollars. Without these dollars, 
the risk of schools closing, of busi-
nesses closing, of public transportation 
closing is too large. 
Should a future variant rear its 
nasty head—should a future variant 
rear its nasty head—Americans will 
know who voted against more funding. 
An ounce of prevention is worth a 
pound of cure. 
This was a $10 billion agreement that 
was fully paid for. If there is another 
surge, it costs us 10 times that if we are 
behind the curve again. 
I hope Republicans will get serious 
about this. It should not be so difficult 
for them to do something so good and 
important for our country. There is 
still some time. I hope my Republican 
colleagues change their tune quickly. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Colorado. 
CHILD TAX CREDIT 
Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I appre-
ciate the opportunity to address the 
Senate on an issue of real importance 
to our country and to families in Colo-
rado and all across the United States. 
Today, 120 economists wrote an open 
letter—in the face of the inflation that 
we are now facing as a nation, as a re-
sult of the economic growth that we 
are having coming out of this very deep 
recession, and the supply chain inter-
ruptions that have caused inflation, 120 
economists sent an open letter saying: 
The expanded Child Tax Credit is one of 
the easiest, most effective, and direct tools 
currently at our disposal to help families 
deal with the impact of inflation on family 
budgets. 
The exert opinions about the causes of and 
solutions to rising inflation are as varied as 
the authors of this letter, but we agree on 
this: the expanded Child Tax Credit is too 
small to meaningfully increase inflation 
across the whole economy. 
That means that that $100 billion a 
year that the child tax credit costs to 
lift half the kids out of poverty isn’t 
going to drive inflation in a $21 trillion 
economy. That is one of the points 
these economists agreed on. 
‘‘[B]ut,’’ they wrote, ‘‘it will make an 
important difference for family budg-
ets, especially families in the bottom 
half of the income spectrum. Monthly 
Child Tax Credit payments are a prov-
en success at helping families keep up 
with the everyday costs of keeping a 
family afloat.’’ 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to have printed in the RECORD the 
open letter signed by 120 economists. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
OPEN LETTER FROM ECONOMISTS: EXTEND THE 
EXPANDED CHILD TAX CREDIT TO HELP FAM-
ILIES KEEP UP WITH RISING COSTS 
The cost of everything from food and fuel 
to housing and clothes is going up at the 
fastest pace in decades. Families need relief. 
The expanded Child Tax Credit is one of the 
easiest, most effective, and direct tools cur-
rently at our disposal to help families deal 
with the impact of inflation on family budg-
ets. A recent analysis by Moody’s found that 
inflation is costing the average family $296 
per month, with lower-income families being 
hit even harder. Each $250 to $300 monthly 
child tax credit payment can offset the toll 
inflation is taking. 
The expert opinions about the causes of 
and solutions to rising inflation are as varied 
as the authors of this letter, but we agree on 
this: the expanded Child Tax Credit is too 
small to meaningfully increase inflation 
across the whole economy, but it will make 
an important difference for family budgets, 
especially families in the bottom half of the 
income spectrum. Monthly Child Tax Credit 
payments are a proven success at helping 
families keep up with the everyday costs of 
keeping a family afloat. With inflation caus-
ing those very costs to rise, the Child Tax 
Credit is even more important now to help 
families meet their basic needs.

Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, this is 
no surprise to me. I was for the child 
tax credit before we had COVID be-
cause for the last 50 years, as I have 
said before on this floor, we had an 
economy that has worked really well 
for the top 10 percent of Americans and 
basically hasn’t worked for anybody 
else. 
We have some of the lowest economic 
mobility in the industrialized world. 
We have got some of the greatest in-
come inequality in the industrialized 
world.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1966 
April 5, 2022 
Stunningly—stunningly—in the last 
two economic downturns, economic in-
equality has only gotten staggeringly 
worse in this country because of the 
massive asset inflation that has bene-
fited the wealthiest people in the econ-
omy who are in the position to make 
money on their money or, in the case 
of a lot of people, on real estate. In Col-
orado, it is making it harder and hard-
er and harder for working people to 
find a place to live. 
And I can tell you that our kids pay 
the highest price from this. 
I was the superintendent of the Den-
ver Public Schools before I was in this 
job. A majority of kids were kids of 
color; a majority of kids were kids liv-
ing in poverty. And their families were 
working—contrary to what some peo-
ple around here think, their families 
were working two and three jobs. The 
problem wasn’t that their families 
weren’t working. It wasn’t that they 
weren’t working hard. They were kill-
ing themselves, and no matter what 
they did, they couldn’t get their kids 
out of poverty, and that is not a con-
sequence of anything that is their 
fault. They are doing everything they 
can. For that matter, their kids are 
doing everything they can—going to 
schools that ought to do a better job 
for the kids living in poverty all over 
this country. 
And some people think that we have 
to just accept this as a fundamental as-
pect of our economy or our democracy 
or our society; that somehow the 
United States of America is such a fail-
ure as a community that we have to 
accept being 38 out of 41 industrialized 
countries in terms of childhood pov-
erty; that we are willing to perma-
nently accept the idea that the poorest 
people in our society are our children. 
I think there is something we can do 
about it. I know there is something we 
can do about it. I know there is a lot of 
skepticism about the Federal Govern-
ment’s ability to do anything well. I 
share that skepticism sometimes. 
We fought two wars in the Middle 
East that lasted for 20 years, that cost 
about $5.6 trillion—seems like a set of 
bad decisions. 
We have cut taxes on the floor of this 
body by $8 trillion since 2001. Almost 
all of the benefit of that has gone to 
the wealthiest people in the country, 
when we have got the worst income in-
equality that we have had since 1928. 
It has been staggering to watch—it 
has been staggering to watch people 
stay here at the end of a legislative 
year, at the end of a Congress, and burn 
the midnight oil to make sure that we 
can extend the tax cuts for the wealthi-
est people in the country and for the 
largest corporations in America. 
That is how you know it is 2 o’clock 
in the morning in the U.S. Senate. It is 
when we have to extend tax cuts for 
the richest people in this country dur-
ing a time of devastating income in-
equality that is perpetuated by the 
economic cycles that we continue to 
have. 
But last year, Mr. President, as you 
know, because you were a big part of 
this, we did something different. We 
adopted the expanded child tax credit; 
we adopted the expanded earned in-
come tax credit. Those bills were Ben-
net-Brown and Brown-Bennet, respec-
tively—my friend SHERROD BROWN from 
the great State of Ohio. 
And here on this, ahead of tax day, I 
wanted to come down to the floor just 
to give you a little report, kind of a 
book report, a status report on what 
has happened. 
And what I want to tell you is it 
worked. It worked. It worked. We dis-
covered we didn’t have to live in a soci-
ety that was 38 out of 41 industrialized 
countries. We discovered that we didn’t 
have to accept the world where the 
poorest people in our country were our 
children. 
We benefited 61 million kids in the 
United States—90 percent of the chil-
dren in Connecticut, 90 percent of the 
children in Colorado, and 90 percent of 
the children all across this country di-
rectly benefited from a bill we passed 
here. 
We cut childhood poverty nearly in 
half. We cut hunger by a quarter for 
families with kids during a pandemic, 
which feels like a worthy thing to have 
done. We did it without adding a single 
bureaucrat to the Federal Government. 
We did it without adding one more Fed-
eral Agency. We proved we could do it. 
And then we didn’t extend it at the 
end of the year. And now, predictably, 
childhood poverty is shooting up in the 
United States of America. Hunger is 
shooting up in the United States of 
America. 
I was on the phone with the leaders 
of the food banks across Colorado who 
have done such an incredible job during 
this recession and during the last re-
cession making sure people are fed. I 
have visited some of those food banks. 
I know that people are saying to me 
that there are, you know, two-thirds of 
the people who are showing up were 
people who didn’t show up before we 
had this catastrophe of COVID. 
But guess what is getting longer now, 
as a result of our failure to extend the 
child tax credit. It is the lines in these 
food banks. It is the people coming to 
get food for their kids instead of being 
able to go to the grocery store with the 
dignity of the expanded child tax cred-
it. 
There is a shred of good news here 
that I wanted to just speak about for a 
second because this will be my chance 
to do it, and I just want to remind peo-
ple that as families file their tax re-
turns, they will receive the second half 
of their child tax credit, which is worth 
up to $1,800 per child. That is still 
available. It is not coming in a month-
ly form anymore. It is not coming into 
your bank account anymore in that 
automatic way, but when you file your 
tax returns, you will receive it. 
And the other thing, because of the 
EITC work that we did—the earned in-
come tax credit work—workers with-
out children will receive the expanded 
EITC, which we tripled last year—we 
tripled last year. 
We finally decided we are not going 
to tax people into poverty anymore in 
this country, which is what we were 
doing before we expanded that. 
So I wanted to remind families to 
claim their child and dependent care 
tax credit as well. 
We expanded that last year to a max-
imum of $4,000 per child, and in my 
view we have to continue to come down 
here and fight to make these credits 
permanent. And it is my goal for us to 
end childhood poverty in this country. 
I think cutting it in half—that was 
an exciting thing. It has been a long 
time around here—decades, genera-
tions—generations since we have seen a 
reduction in poverty in this country 
like the reduction in childhood poverty 
we saw last year, generations since we 
have seen a reduction in hunger like we 
saw last year. 
And the good news is, we now know 
that it is a fact that we can do it. 
There are a lot of countries in the 
world that have an expanded child tax 
credit or child benefit like the child 
tax credit, and in all those countries, 
fewer of their kids live in poverty. 
And their workforce participation 
rates 
are 
actually 
higher, 
which 
doesn’t surprise me at all, based on the 
stories I heard from families about 
what they were spending the child tax 
credit on, which was everything that 
had to do with their kids, from buying 
back-to-school clothes to paying for a 
bicycle so a young man in Colorado 
Springs could stay at school late so he 
could have extracurriculars that he 
otherwise wouldn’t have had the abil-
ity to achieve, so that his mom could 
stay at work for a few more hours so 
she could provide for the family. 
There is literally no data in America 
or anywhere else that doesn’t support 
the idea that this is a pro-work policy, 
the child tax credit. 
We didn’t have any trouble, as I said 
earlier, extending the $8 trillion of tax 
cuts that we have cut for the wealthi-
est people in this country since 2001. 
For that money, we could have ex-
tended the child tax credit for 50 years. 
We could have doubled it for 25 years, 
and we could have ended childhood pov-
erty in the United States of America. I 
guarantee you that would have been a 
better investment than sending money 
to people who need it least in our econ-
omy. 
I would say to my own party that I 
am really grateful that we passed this 
last year, but I am deeply, deeply dis-
appointed that we couldn’t come to-
gether and extend it. 
I am deeply, deeply disappointed that 
we haven’t fulfilled our promise to re-
verse the Trump tax cuts for the rich-
est people in America. It doesn’t make 
any sense. It is completely upside 
down, but that is where we find our-
selves. 
I wish I could express how different it 
felt at the end of the year when it was

kids, many of whom were living in pov-
erty and their families who were get-
ting, on average, $450 a month—when 
the lights were going out on them, and 
we just went home. We just went home. 
There was nobody burning the mid-
night oil here to make sure that the 
kids got the benefit of this. 
And, by the way, even if you don’t be-
lieve that living in a society where the 
poorest people are your kids and that 
it ought to be a purpose of a nation to 
lift kids who, through no fault of their 
own, find themselves in poverty; who, 
through no fault of their own, find 
themselves living in a country where 
we have less economic mobility than 
almost any other industrialized coun-
try in the world and therefore don’t 
have the opportunity to rise that gen-
erations had before them—and, hope-
fully, generations that will come after 
them—and that are attending a system 
of education in this country because of 
the lack of early childhood education 
in the United States, because of the 
lack of quality K–12 education in this 
country, because of the incredible ex-
pense of higher education—who are at-
tending a system that is actually rein-
forcing the income equality we have 
rather than liberating people from 
their circumstances. 
(Mr. MARKEY assumed the Chair.) 
The best predictor of the quality of 
your education in this country is your 
parents’ income, to the point of ruth-
lessness—to the point of ruthlessness. 
I want to mention that Senator ROM-
NEY, who is a Republican from Utah, 
has a very similar bill to my bill to ex-
pand the child tax credit. In fact, it is 
basically the same bill. He is a little 
more generous with kids under the age 
of 6, and we have a difference of view 
on pay-fors, but I think that is a 
bridgeable difference. And I have no 
doubt that in the long term, we will 
come to a bipartisan agreement in this 
Chamber to make the enhanced child 
tax credit permanent; to decide that 
even if you don’t care about the kids, 
which you should, that the country 
can’t afford this level of childhood pov-
erty, that our democracy won’t be sus-
tained with this level of income in-
equality. That is what I believe. That 
is what I know. 
Childhood poverty costs the United 
States of America $1 trillion dollars a 
year. That is why it is not surprising 
that Columbia University did a study 
and found that we get an 8x return— 
that the child tax credit would pay 
back the United States eight times 
what it costs. Again, what it costs is 
$100 billion a year, but childhood pov-
erty costs us $1 trillion a year. 
Instead of accepting the idea that we 
are going to be at the bottom of the 
cellar when it comes to kids living in 
poverty, what we said was: No, we are 
going to cut it in half. 
And let me assure you, as a former 
school superintendent and—well, as a 
former school superintendent—the cost 
of mitigating for childhood poverty far 
exceeds the cost diminishing it. 
It is an amazing thing to me, on top 
of everything else that we are talking 
about today, that when families are in 
the grip of the kind of inflation that 
they are in the grip of—which costs 
them somewhere between $270 to $300 a 
month, depending on where they live 
and depending on who they are—that it 
wouldn’t occur to us that the easiest 
thing to do would be just to reinstate 
what we were doing last year and allow 
people to have the benefit of $450 on av-
erage to raise their children, to pay for 
a little bit of extra childcare, to pay 
for a little bit of transportation to fix 
a car that is broken so they can stay 
on the job. 
I know there are some colleagues 
here 
who 
think 
that 
this 
policy 
disincentivizes work. Even before we 
passed this last year, every study that 
looked at this that I was aware of, with 
the exception of one outlier that I 
think had terrible data—every single 
one—said that this was not going to 
negatively affect work. 
And guess what. Now we have had a 
6-month experiment in the United 
States of America, and every study, in-
cluding the one by the American En-
terprise Institute, which was a doubter 
about this policy—and I think probably 
still is a doubter about this policy— 
found that it had no effect on people’s 
work habits. 
The problem in America is not that 
people don’t work hard. That is not the 
problem that we have in this country. 
People are killing themselves. And it is 
true that wages are up by about 5.6 per-
cent since the Biden administration 
went into office, which is great, awe-
some. It is great, but we have had the 
effects of inflation, and we are a long 
way from having an economy that, 
when it grows, it grows for everybody, 
which, by the way, that is what we 
need to do. That is what we have to 
achieve. 
This democracy will not survive an-
other 50 years of an economy that, 
when it grows, it grows for the top 10 
percent, and everyone else’s wages are 
flat or everyone else is effectively in a 
recession. There is no evidence in world 
history that with that level of income 
inequality, that lack of economic mo-
bility, that, over 100 years, you can 
sustain a democracy. 
And we don’t have to do that. We 
don’t have to do that. We can make it 
permanent, put it back in place—pay 
for it, by the way. I believe we should 
pay for it by raising taxes on the 
wealthiest people in the country, like 
we said we were going to do by revers-
ing the Trump tax cuts—the Trump 
giveaways which were sold as the mid-
dle-class tax cut. They were so smart 
because they gave people in the lower 
levels of the income ladder a little bit, 
to say: There is your Trump tax cut— 
so he could go out to the Mahoning 
Valley, go out to Youngstown, and tell 
people: You got your tax cut. You are 
welcome. 
What he didn’t tell them was that 52 
percent of the Trump tax cuts went to 
the top 5 percent of Americans; that 
after 
he 
left 
the 
people 
of 
the 
Mahoning Valley and Youngstown, an 
old steel town, and then he went on to 
Mar-a-Lago, where people were having 
a New Year’s Eve dinner, or whatever 
it was they were having, and the first 
thing he said to them was: You are wel-
come. That was a lot closer to the 
truth. 
You are welcome. You are welcome 
that I cut your taxes at a time when 
income inequality is greater than at 
any time since 1929. You are welcome 
that I cut the corporate rate to 21 per-
cent, even though no one in corporate 
America was asking for a 21-percent 
tax cut. ‘‘You are welcome’’ is what he 
said. 
I said earlier, Mr. President, before 
you were here, that there are people in 
the country that are skeptical of the 
Federal Government doing anything 
well and that I have my own skep-
ticism for the reasons I said earlier. 
But there are people in terms of the 
child tax credit that said it would 
never work. You know, 6 months before 
we did it or 4 months before we did it, 
I was getting stopped by reporters ev-
eryday asking: Do you think they are 
really going to be able to do this? Can 
the IRS, can the Department of Treas-
ury—can they really administer this? 
And the answer is yes, they did. They 
did a fantastic job. They didn’t get ev-
erybody at first. They didn’t get every-
body at first, and we knew that would 
be a problem. We enlisted people all 
over the State of Colorado who worked 
with folks, who worked with working 
families and worked with families who 
are living in poverty, because, remem-
ber, this wasn’t just about kids living 
in poverty. 
Ninety percent—90 percent—of Amer-
ica’s children benefited from this. That 
is why some people have called it So-
cial Security for kids. Some people 
have called it universal basic income 
for kids. I think it is a good thing be-
cause I can tell you that 90 percent of 
the kids in Colorado can use the help; 
because 90 percent of the people in this 
country and in my State have not ben-
efited from economic growth the same 
way the top 10 percent of Americans 
have for the last 50 years. 
And, as I mentioned—I just want to 
say again on this floor because there 
were people out there saying, ‘‘People 
are going to drop out of the work-
force,’’—it did not happen. It didn’t 
happen in other countries that have a 
tax benefit like this, and it didn’t hap-
pen during the 6 months that we were 
here. 
I understand that, maybe, we would 
have a different debate. People would 
say: Oh, my God, Michael, all these 
people dropped out of the workforce. It 
didn’t work the way you said that it 
would. 
It did work the way I said it would. It 
did work the way that data said that it 
would, 
and 
moms 
and 
dads—very 
unsurprisingly to me—who were work-
ing hard to begin with, probably just

worked harder because now they had 
the chance to pay for a little extra 
childcare. Now they had the chance to 
fix a car or, as I said, let their kid go 
to extracurricular activities so they 
could stay at work. And that is what 
all the studies have shown. 
So I suppose one good thing has come 
out of this, which is—or maybe it is 
more than one good thing—it is that 
we now know that America is no dif-
ferent than any other place in this re-
spect: that when parents get a mar-
ginal, incremental amount of money, 
they don’t quit their jobs; they feed 
their kids. But as a society, we are able 
to say that we cut childhood poverty in 
half and we cut hunger in half—by 25 
percent. 
What good is it that now there are 
families that are lined up in soup 
kitchens, today, who weren’t there 6 
months ago because they had the ben-
efit of the child tax credit? 
As I said, parents spent this credit on 
all kinds of different things. I men-
tioned childcare. I mentioned the bicy-
cle for extracurricular, but, I will tell 
you, the thing that I heard from every 
single parent that I talked to—and 
there were a lot of them in Colorado 
over the last 6 months, over the last 6 
months of last year—was the stress 
that it had relieved for their family— 
that grinding stress of being in a reces-
sion, the grinding stress of being in the 
middle of a pandemic, the grinding 
stress of having your kids out of school 
or having interrupted schooling, the 
grinding stress of living in an economy 
where people are saying to you, no 
matter how hard you work, that some-
how it is your fault that you can’t give 
your family that; and that the deci-
sions that we have made over many 
years in this Chamber and in the 
Chamber across there, and that some of 
the largest institutions have made as 
well, unfortunately, have created real 
headwinds for working people and for 
their families. 
We are in the middle here of consid-
ering the China COMPETES bill, which 
I think gives us a real opportunity to 
reassess what we have been doing for 
the last 40 or 50 years. 
Every single thing we set and we told 
the American people we were doing in 
their name with respect to China and 
its presence in the World Trade Organi-
zation and what China would do as a 
result of that—none of that turned out 
to be true. And when I say ‘‘China,’’ I 
don’t mean the Chinese people. I mean 
Beijing. And we realize now that they 
weren’t going to follow the rules of the 
road. We realize now that they were en-
gaged in state-sponsored capitalism, 
and that is very hard to compete with; 
and that instead of just privileging the 
people in our society who want to 
make stuff as cheaply as possible in 
China, maybe we ought to be thinking 
about other things, like our supply 
chain—protecting our supply chain—or 
our national security or whether we 
are creating good-paying jobs in the 
United States so that when the econ-
omy grows, it grows for everybody. 
We have an opportunity to do that 
now, and that is what I want. That is 
what I really want: It is an economy 
that, when it grows, it grows for every-
body, because that is the American 
dream, that is the story we told our-
selves about who we are as a people, 
and that is the way to strengthen our 
democracy. That is what I really want. 
In the meantime, what I would like 
us to do, since we now know how to do 
it, finally, is lift half the kids in this 
country out of poverty so they have a 
chance to pursue the American dream 
themselves. I used to say that this 
Chamber treated America’s children 
like they were someone else’s children 
because of the education system that 
we have provided for them. And when 
we did the child tax credit, I came out 
here and I said: I can finally come to 
this floor and say: We are now treating 
America’s children like they are Amer-
ica’s children. 
But, for the moment, that is no 
longer true, and, for the moment, we 
are treating them like they are some-
one else’s children, and we will rue the 
day that we did this. We will rue the 
day that we did this. 
This is a pro-work policy. It is a pro- 
family policy. It is a pro-democracy 
policy. We now know it worked, and it 
worked well. We have got to fight to 
make it permanent, and that is what I 
will do. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
WAR CRIMES ACCOUNTABILITY ACT 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, Europe 
has seen its share of horrors over the 
last century: the atrocities of World 
War I, World War II, as well as the Bos-
nian war. Ukrainians, in particular, 
suffered under the rule of Joseph Sta-
lin. During the tragedy known as 
Holodomor, millions of Ukrainians died 
of starvation—forced starvation. 
In the wake of some—but not all—of 
these atrocities, the world responded 
by bringing the perpetrators to justice. 
After World War II, of course, there 
were the Nuremberg trials; and after 
the Bosnian war, President Milosevic 
was charged with crimes against hu-
manity by an international criminal 
tribunal. 
Sadly, now, in 2022, we are faced with 
the question: How will the world react 
to the crimes that are now being com-
mitted in Ukraine? 
Over the past week, we have wit-
nessed the reality of Vladimir Putin’s 
genocidal rampage on the innocent 
people of Ukraine, and the scenes of 
brutality in Bucha are seared in our 
collective memory. 
Today, in Bucha, Ukraine, there are 
mass graves surrounded by bodies hast-
ily shoved into garbage bags, civilian 
cars crushed like tin cans, and front 
yards and gardens lined with the dead 
bodies of innocent Ukrainian people. 
One survivor, Antonina Pomazanko, 
aged 76, watched helplessly as Russian 
soldiers 
murdered 
her 
daughter, 
Tetiana. Without provocation, the Rus-
sian soldiers opened fire on her home, 
and the bullets ripped through the 
gates and fence as Tetiana was stand-
ing in the yard. She was killed in an in-
stant. 
On Sunday, the New York Times ran 
a photo of Mrs. Pomazanko looking 
over her daughter’s dead body. Mrs. 
Pomazanko had covered it with plastic 
sheets and wooden boards. It was lying 
in the same spot where she was killed 
last month. 
In the words of Mrs. Pomazanko: 
There was so much shelling, I did not know 
what to do. 
There is nothing that will fill the 
void of loss and despair that Mrs. 
Pomazanko and millions of Ukrainians 
feel at this very moment, but there is 
more—much, much more—that we, as 
Americans, must do. 
The actions of Vladimir Putin hark-
en back to some of Europe’s darkest 
days—the atrocities committed by the 
Nazis during World War II, the mas-
sacres of the former Yugoslavia—days 
that we must endure and days which 
we hope we never have to relive. And as 
I mentioned, after the Allied Forces 
liberated Europe in 1945, the world re-
sponded. It came together at the his-
toric Nuremberg trials. 
When the trials first convened at the 
Palace of Justice on November 21, 1945, 
Supreme Court Justice Robert H. Jack-
son delivered the opening statement. 
He said: 
The wrongs which we seek to condemn and 
punish have been so calculated, so malig-
nant, and so devastating, that civilization 
cannot tolerate their being ignored because 
it cannot survive their being repeated. 
‘‘Civilization cannot tolerate’’ and 
‘‘cannot survive’’ the war crimes we 
have 
witnessed 
in 
Ukraine 
going 
unpunished. 
President Biden recognized that fact 
on Monday in his calling for a war 
crime trial for the horrors in Ukraine. 
President Lincoln once said to Con-
gress when he proposed an end to slav-
ery: 
We—even we here—hold the power, and 
bear the responsibility. 
It is within the power and the respon-
sibility of this body to deny safe haven 
in America or anywhere to perpetra-
tors of these heinous crimes. 
Under 
existing 
law, 
foreign 
war 
criminals who come to the United 
States, incredibly, cannot be pros-
ecuted. They cannot be held liable in a 
civil action or even be deported for 
their heinous crimes. Currently, the 
War Crimes Act only applies if the per-
petrator or victim is a U.S. service-
member or a U.S. national. In other 
words, it would not cover the Russian 
officials who are responsible for the 
commission of war crimes in Ukraine 
nor cover the Russian soldiers who 
committed those crimes. 
We also don’t have a statute or a law 
in America making crimes against hu-
manity a violation of U.S. law. This 
was the primary offense prosecuted in 
Nuremberg, and it was a critical tool 
for holding violators accountable.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1969 
April 5, 2022 
Other grave human rights violations, 
including genocide and torture, are al-
ready crimes under U.S. law that cover 
any offender found in the United 
States. This should also be true for war 
crimes and crimes against humanity, 
and that is why I will introduce the 
War Crimes Accountability Act. 
The War Crimes Accountability Act 
will ensure the United States has the 
tools to hold accountable the perpetra-
tors of war crimes and other atrocities. 
The bill expands the War Crimes Act to 
cover all war criminals who are in the 
United States, regardless of where they 
are from. It fills the gap in our crimi-
nal code for prosecuting crimes against 
humanity so that we can hold perpetra-
tors who come to this country account-
able. 
This is not just a hypothetical idea. 
Consider one example: After the mas-
sacre of thousands of innocent men and 
boys in the Srebrenica massacre, a war 
criminal named Marko Boskic made 
his way to the United States. When law 
enforcement tracked him down, they 
could only charge him with visa fraud, 
not a war crime or crimes against hu-
manity. We must bring war criminals 
to justice for their horrific crimes, not 
slap them on the wrist with a visa 
technicality. 
The United States must never again 
provide safe haven for perpetrators of 
war crimes and crimes against human-
ity. Our Nation led the first prosecu-
tions for crimes in the Nuremberg 
trials. It is time for the United States 
to lead again. 
Ultimately, the day will come when 
Vladimir Putin faces justice, and his 
name and his regime will be remem-
bered in history alongside the worst of 
the worst. Until Putin and his syco-
phants are brought to justice, we can-
not waver—we cannot equivocate—in 
providing Ukraine with all the re-
sources, weapons, and aid they need to 
triumph over Russia. 
Quite simply, the United States of 
America should never be a safe haven 
for a war criminal. The United States 
of America should be holding war 
criminals responsible for their horrible 
conduct and what they have done to 
the poor and innocent people in other 
places, and they should be held liable 
on criminal and civil bases. That is 
what this bill would do. It is an effort 
to move forward with the cause of jus-
tice, but I hope it is only the begin-
ning. 
When nations around the world adopt 
similar laws to the ones which I am 
proposing, we will make it clear that 
there are no safe havens left for war 
criminals. They will pay a price wher-
ever they end up, and that is the way it 
should be if there is going to be justice. 
‘‘Slava Ukraini.’’ 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
BIDEN FAMILY 
Mr. 
GRASSLEY. 
Mr. 
President, 
today, Senator JOHNSON
and I will 
present our third speech on the Biden 
investigation series. 
Today, we will focus on James Biden, 
the President’s brother. Hunter Biden 
wasn’t the only Biden family member 
who had connections to the Chinese 
communist regime. James Biden did as 
well. 
Before we begin our discussion, I 
think we will need to mention the 
main company once again, the Chinese 
company that goes by the initials 
CEFC. 
In the first two speeches, Senator 
JOHNSON and I established the connec-
tion between CEFC and the communist 
Chinese Government. We established 
the connection between CEFC and Hud-
son West III. We then established the 
connection 
with 
Hunter 
Biden’s 
Owasco, Hudson West III, and CEFC. 
We showed that Hunter Biden and 
James Biden actively assisted CEFC as 
it worked to expand its footprint and 
its holdings in the global and U.S. en-
ergy sector. Today, we will add James 
Biden’s Lion Hall Group to the list of 
Biden family companies connected to 
the communist regime. 
In my and Senator JOHNSON’s Sep-
tember 2020 report, we showed that 
Hunter Biden and James Biden and 
their aligned firms received approxi-
mately $4.8 million from Hudson West 
III from August 2017 to September 2018. 
During that same timeframe, Hunter 
Biden’s Owasco sent 20 or so wires to 
James Biden’s Lion Hall Group. Those 
20 wires totaled just about $1.4 million. 
The liberal media and our Demo-
cratic colleagues originally tried to 
claim that Senator JOHNSON and my 
findings were Russian disinformation. 
Last week, the Washington Post re-
ported the following: 
Over the course of 14 months, the Chinese 
energy conglomerate— 
Here, parenthetically, they are refer-
ring to CEFC— 
and its executives paid $4.8 million to enti-
ties controlled by Hunter Biden and his 
uncle, according to government records, 
court documents and newly disclosed bank 
statements, as well as emails contained on a 
copy of a laptop hard drive that purportedly 
once belonged to Hunter Biden. 
The Post also reported this: 
During that time period, about $1.4 million 
was transferred from Hunter’s account to the 
Lion Hall Group, the consulting firm that 
James Biden ran, according to other govern-
ment records reviewed by The Post. 
Senator JOHNSON and I were right 2 
years ago. We knew it then, but it has 
been a long road to defend our work 
product. 
The liberal media and our Demo-
cratic colleagues aggressively tried to 
make the case that we were peddling 
Russian disinformation. What will the 
liberal media and my Democratic col-
leagues say now in light of last week’s 
Washington Post article that substan-
tiated the work Senator JOHNSON and I 
have been doing? We still haven’t re-
ceived any apology from our Demo-
cratic colleagues for their false claims 
against us these past several years. 
They haven’t apologized to the Amer-
ican people. And I am not going to hold 
my breath. 
When will the big-time media in 
Washington awaken to respect my rep-
utation for the thorough investigative 
and oversight work that I do as a Sen-
ator? And it is also my constitutional 
responsibility to do exactly that. 
Now, we have more records to discuss 
today. Today, Senator JOHNSON and I 
will show you financial transfers direct 
from Hudson West III to the Lion Hall 
Group. In other words, in these trans-
fers, Hunter Biden’s Owasco isn’t the 
middleman. 
Let’s look at the first poster here. 
This is a January 2018 bank statement 
from Hudson West III. Now, there is a 
lot going on here, so I will just men-
tion several items. 
First, we have two examples of more 
wire transfers from Hudson West III for 
$165,000. The underlying wire data, 
which Senator JOHNSON
and I will 
make public this very day, shows that 
money went to Hunter Biden’s Owasco. 
That money was for the August 2017 
LLC agreement, which by its terms 
saw James Biden become a manager of 
Hudson West III. That agreement sent 
$100,000 to Hunter Biden and $65,000 to 
James 
Biden 
every 
month. 
Those 
transactions occurred after the $5 mil-
lion wire from Northern International 
Capital to Hudson West III on August 
2017. Northern International was con-
nected to Ye Jianming, who was con-
nected to the communist regime. 
We explained all that in our second 
speech just last Tuesday. 
Second, this statement shows several 
examples of wires from Hudson West III 
to CEFC. As Senator JOHNSON and I 
have established, that company is an 
arm of the communist Chinese regime. 
This new record shows how closely con-
nected Hudson West III was with CEFC 
while Hunter Biden and James Biden 
received money from Hudson West III. 
Third, we have a January 17, 2018, 
wire to Lion Hall Group. That happens 
to be James Biden’s company. James 
Biden received $18,000 from Hudson 
West III the same month that company 
sent money to CEFC. This is just one 
example of many. 
Accordingly, the official bank record 
makes clear the financial connections 
between and among James Biden and 
the communist Chinese elements. 
To the liberal media and my Demo-
cratic colleagues, this official bank 
record—is that Russian disinformation, 
as you accused us of spreading? 
Now let’s go to the second poster. 
This is a Hudson West III bank record 
from April 2018. Here, you see wire 
transfers from Coldharbour Capital. 
That 
company 
was 
connected 
to 
Mervyn Yan, who was an associate of 
Ye Jianming and Gongwen Dong. 
As Senator JOHNSON and I have al-
ready established, all of them are con-
nected to the communist regime. These 
are the players in the game that I men-
tioned in the first speech last Monday, 
and now we have established that they 
appear repeatedly in bank records with 
high-dollar transfers. 
These transfers aren’t by accident— 
no way. There is clearly a scheme here.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1970 
April 5, 2022 
There is a plan among and between all 
these individuals and their respective 
companies, which then begs the ques-
tion, has the Justice Department ac-
quired these records? If so, what has 
the Justice Department done about 
these records? 
Moving to the next transaction, 
there is another $165,000 wire. Again, 
that relates back to the LLC agree-
ment that connected Hunter and James 
Biden to the Chinese firm CEFC and its 
projects in the energy sector. Then you 
have a $34,000 wire to James Biden’s 
Lion Hall Group from Hudson West III. 
So what was this all about? Let’s 
take a look, then, at the third poster. 
Look at the sixth line from the bot-
tom. I want to quote. It says ‘‘office ex-
pense and reimbursement.’’ That is the 
same reason given for the first poster 
that I showed you. 
We will make all these records public 
this very day. 
For those of you who may still doubt 
my and Senator JOHNSON’s oversight 
work, I am going to present one last 
transaction to bring all of this home. 
Look at the fourth poster. In my and 
Senator JOHNSON’s September 2020 re-
port, we found that James Biden and 
Hunter Biden went on a $99,000 global 
spending spree courtesy of whom? An-
other Chinese person I have mentioned 
so many times in these three speech-
es—Gongwen Dong. The spending spree 
included airline tickets, purchases at 
Apple stores, hotels, and restaurants. 
This bank record next to me shows a 
$99,000 transaction in September 2017, 
but that is not all that we have. 
Let’s turn to the final poster. This is 
No. 5. This is a credit card authoriza-
tion form for $99,000. Look at the bot-
tom. There is a signature block with 
Hunter Biden and Gongwen Dong. 
To the liberal press and my Demo-
cratic colleagues, are these official 
records Russian disinformation? 
So what is the point of all these 
records? Not only have Senator JOHN-
SON
and I illustrated through new 
records that Hunter Biden was finan-
cially connected to the communist re-
gime, these records show James Biden 
was as well. These new records show di-
rect financial links between companies 
connected to the communist regime 
and James Biden through Lion Hall 
Group. These new records support the 
findings in our report to the last Con-
gress. 
Remember, those records were put 
out in September and November of 
2020, and everybody was saying it was 
Russian disinformation. Forget the 
facts. Forget the evidence. Forget the 
investigative journalism. The liberal 
media wanted to provide cover for 
then-Candidate Joe Biden. They did 
whatever they could to smear our in-
vestigations. 
With these new records, there can be 
no doubt that James Biden was finan-
cially connected to corporations and 
individuals with extensive links to 
communist China and that he and Hun-
ter Biden were in it together, working 
to help a Chinese Government-linked 
energy company pursue deals and ex-
pand its reach in the energy sector. 
Now, it is Senator JOHNSON’s turn. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wisconsin. 
Mr. 
JOHNSON. 
Mr. 
President, 
I 
thank Senator GRASSLEY. 
What Senator GRASSLEY and I have 
showed over the course of six speeches 
are the actual bank records of financial 
transactions tying President Biden’s 
son Hunter and his brother James to 
businesses that are essentially arms of 
the communist Chinese regime. But 
the Biden business ventures include ac-
tivities in many more countries than 
just China. 
In our September and November 2020 
reports, we showed a vast web of Biden 
family foreign financial entanglements 
that were largely ignored by the media 
and 
falsely 
labeled 
‘‘Russian 
disinformation’’ by our Democratic 
colleagues. As outrageous as the sup-
pression of our reports and the false at-
tacks were, perhaps the most egregious 
behavior came from 51 former intel-
ligence Agency officials who lent their 
names and reputations to an effort de-
signed to convince the American public 
that Hunter Biden’s laptop had ‘‘all the 
classic earmarks of a Russian informa-
tion operation.’’ 
Without any evidence backing their 
assertion, they engaged in their own 
information operation by signing a 
public letter right before the election. 
Their letter was actual disinformation, 
coming from what are supposed to be 
trusted former members of our U.S. in-
telligence Agencies. They should all be 
ashamed and held accountable for 
spreading this disinformation. By sign-
ing that disinformation letter, they re-
inforced false claims that the records 
on the laptop were not legitimate. 
By casting doubt on evidence of the 
Bidens’ corrupt practices, these former 
intelligence officials interfered in the 
2020 election to a far greater extent 
than Russia could have ever hoped to 
achieve. Their willing accomplices in 
the press amplified this disinformation 
letter and, by doing so, were equally 
guilty of egregious election inter-
ference. 
In August 2020, I wrote a public letter 
detailing the history, purpose, and 
goals of my oversight and investiga-
tions. In that letter, I laid out the 
timeline of Joe and Hunter Biden’s in-
volvement in Ukraine. The timeline is 
very revealing. 
It starts in February 2014. That was 
the month of the Revolution of Dignity 
in Ukraine. Two months later, on April 
16, 2014, then-Vice President Biden met 
with his son’s business partner Devon 
Archer, now a convicted felon, at the 
White House. 
I just want to pause and just let that 
sink in a little bit. Devon Archer is 
now a convicted felon. He got a meet-
ing in the White House with the Vice 
President of the United States. That is 
kind of a big deal. 
The press didn’t ask many questions. 
Five days after that meeting in the 
White House, April 21, Joe Biden vis-
ited Ukraine, and the media described 
him as the ‘‘public face of the adminis-
tration’s handling of Ukraine.’’ The 
next day, on April 22, Devon Archer 
joined the board of Burisma. What a 
coincidence. 
On April 28, 6 days later, British offi-
cials seized $23 million from the Lon-
don bank accounts of Burisma’s owner 
Mykola Zlochevsky. Let that sink in a 
little bit. Six days after Devon Archer 
joined the board of Burisma, a day 
after Vice President Biden visited 
Ukraine, which was 5 days after he met 
with Devon Archer in the White House, 
British officials seized $23 million from 
the corrupt owner of Burisma. 
On May 13, 2014, 3 weeks later, Hun-
ter Biden joined the board of Burisma. 
What a coincidence. 
Because of the findings in our reports 
and the excellent investigative jour-
nalism on the part of John Solomon, 
we also know that Hunter was involved 
with Yelena Baturina, the corrupt and 
now-sanctioned wife of the former 
mayor of Moscow, during the exact 
same period of time. 
On February 14, 2014, Baturina wired 
$3.5 
million 
to 
Rosemont 
Seneca 
Thornton, an investment firm co-
founded by Hunter Biden. 
Between April 4 and April 5, 2014— 
again, the same month that Joe Biden 
met with Devon Archer in the White 
House and Devon became a member of 
the board of Burisma—Hunter Biden 
and Devon Archer sent emails about 
meeting with Baturina, potentially re-
lating to a business deal in Chelsea, 
NY. 
On April 13, 2014, 9 days before Devon 
Archer joined the board of Burisma, 
Hunter Biden and Devon Archer dis-
cussed 
a 
potential 
deal 
involving 
Baturina. Archer wrote that Baturina 
‘‘confirmed green light to fund de-
posit.’’ Archer continued: 
Just spent two hours on the phone with 
Kiev. I am confident at this point this is a 
good if not life changing deal if the Ukraine 
doesn’t collapse in the meantime. 
It is quite interesting to see how 
much significant activity involving the 
Bidens and corrupt actors in Russia 
and Ukraine occurred within a 6-week 
period, only 2 months after the Ukrain-
ian Revolution of Dignity. It sure looks 
like they intended to cash in on the 
turmoil in Ukraine. 
In my August 2020 letter, I listed a 
number of questions about then-Vice 
President 
Biden’s 
interaction 
with 
Hunter Biden’s business partner and 
other family members’ foreign finan-
cial dealings. In making this letter 
public, my hope was that the press, the 
very uninquisitive press, would begin 
to ask then-Presidential candidate Joe 
Biden these important and legitimate 
questions. 
It should come as no surprise that 
the corporate media was completely 
uninterested and failed to conduct any 
investigative 
journalism. 
Nearly 
2 
years after I wrote this public letter, 
the mainstream media has still not

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1971 
April 5, 2022 
adequately pressed President Biden for 
answers to these very legitimate ques-
tions; for example, No. 1: Why did Joe 
Biden meet with Devon Archer at the 
White House on April 16, 2014? What did 
they discuss? Did they discuss any-
thing 
related 
to 
Ukraine, 
Hunter 
Biden, or Burisma? 
No. 2, was Joe Biden aware that 
Devon Archer joined the board of 
Burisma 6 days after that meeting, 1 
day after he visited Ukraine? 
No. 3, does Joe Biden believe Burisma 
and its owner are corrupt? 
No. 4, when did Joe Biden first be-
come aware that Hunter Biden also 
joined the board of Burisma? 
No. 5, when did Joe Biden first be-
come aware of how much money Hun-
ter Biden was being compensated by 
Burisma? Senator GRASSLEY and my 
report showed it was close to $4 mil-
lion. 
No. 6, what does Joe Biden know 
about Hunter or James Biden’s deal-
ings with China? 
No. 7, what does Joe Biden know 
about financial benefits his brother and 
sister-in-law have obtained because of 
their relationships to him? 
Investigative reporter John Solomon 
has added a few more questions to my 
list, including: No. 1, what, if anything, 
did Joe Biden know about his son’s 
dealings with Russian oligarch Yelena 
Baturina? 
No. 2, a 2017 series of memos referred 
to a Chinese business deal that in-
volved Hunter Biden and included a 10- 
percent equity for the ‘‘big guy.’’ What 
did Joe Biden know about this specific 
deal, and who was the ‘‘big guy’’? 
No. 3, emails on Hunter Biden’s 
laptop, now in the possession of the 
FBI, refer to shared accounts or bills 
between Joe Biden and Hunter. Did 
Hunter ever give Joe Biden any money, 
gift, or financial benefit from Hunter’s 
business dealings? 
After a long-overdue analysis, the 
New York Times and the Washington 
Post have finally admitted that records 
from Hunter’s laptop are authentic, 
which means—although they will never 
admit this—that Senator GRASSLEY 
and I were right, and they were wrong. 
It is interesting to read how limited 
and muted their mea culpas are. My 
guess is that they learned a lot from 
their coverage of Nixon’s Watergate 
scandal coverup. They learned that 
when you have been caught in a cover-
up—and that is what has happened 
here—you try to limit the damage by 
telling a little bit of the truth. In the 
intelligence world, this strategy is 
called a ‘‘limited hangout.’’ The Water-
gate coconspirators called it a ‘‘modi-
fied limited hangout.’’ 
Regardless of what you call it, what 
the New York Times and the Wash-
ington Post are doing is not telling the 
whole truth. I doubt they ever will. But 
just in case they decide to pursue the 
truth with a little bit more rigor, they 
can use the above list of relevant ques-
tions as a good starting point for what 
they should be asking President Biden. 
For our part, Senator GRASSLEY and 
I will continue to ask tough questions, 
review more information and records, 
and transparently provide that infor-
mation to the American public. We in-
tend to pursue and uncover the truth. 
I will now turn the floor back over to 
Senator GRASSLEY for his closing re-
marks. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I 
thank Senator JOHNSON. I will just 
quickly say that the journalists in this 
town have an obligation to investigate. 
They ave an obligation to uncover the 
facts and the evidence. They have 
failed time and again. 
What has been reported recently is 
simply the tip of the iceberg. The ques-
tion now is: Instead of accusing us of 
peddling Russian disinformation, will 
the media actually engage in true in-
vestigative journalism? Will the media 
act with intellectual honesty, or will 
the media continue to cover all this up 
for the Biden administration? 
Now, Congress has a constitutional 
responsibility to engage in oversight of 
the executive branch. The Biden ad-
ministration has been totally unre-
sponsive to our oversight requests; spe-
cifically, requests that relate to the 
Biden criminal case. 
Is Nicholas McQuaid recused from 
the Hunter Biden case? No answer from 
the Department. Does the Department 
possess FISA information on Patrick 
Ho, Hunter Biden’s associate? The De-
partment told a Federal court they do. 
They told me and Senator JOHNSON 
that they aren’t sure. Can you imagine 
that? 
When Hunter Biden communicated 
with Patrick Ho, were his communica-
tions captured by our intelligence com-
munity? Is the Biden administration 
intentionally withholding this mate-
rial from Congress out of fear of what 
we will find? 
In light of the Biden administration’s 
total failure to respond to our ques-
tions, these are legitimate questions to 
ask. The Biden Justice Department’s 
actions have cast a cloud over the case. 
The American people are rightly skep-
tical of the impact it may have on it. 
Transparency brings accountability. 
This week, Senator JOHNSON and I have 
done what we can to bring trans-
parency to our oversight work for the 
American people. We will continue to 
do so. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the

Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF KETANJI BROWN JACKSON 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I 
come here with real pleasure, pride, ex-
citement, joy, and real exuberance not 
often felt on the floor of the U.S. Sen-
ate because we are going to be making 
history this week. As confident as I am 
of anything ever in the U.S. Senate 
happening, this week we will confirm 
Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson as an As-
sociate Justice of the U.S. Supreme 
Court. 
Let me, first of all, thank President 
Biden for nominating her. His wisdom 
and courage are one of the reasons that 
she is before us as a nominee in this 
historic vote. And to all my fellow 
Members of the Judiciary Committee, 
we have labored a long time, through 
many hours, and I particularly thank 
Senator DURBIN for his leadership. 
Now, ‘‘historic’’ is a word that is 
often overused, even in this Chamber, 
where a lot of history is made, but 
Judge Jackson’s nomination truly mer-
its that word. It is a joyous, exciting 
moment for all Americans because Jus-
tice Jackson will make the U.S. Su-
preme Court look more like America 
and, hopefully, think more like Amer-
ica at a time when Black women and 
people with diverse backgrounds, races, 
religions have broken many barriers. 
Her confirmation will be a giant leap 
into the present. She stands on the 
shoulders of many who have come be-
fore her, as she recognized so explicitly 
in our hearing. One of them is Con-
stance Baker Motley, a daughter of 
New Haven, CT, the first Black woman 
to argue before the U.S. Supreme Court 
and the first Black woman to be ap-
pointed as a judge on the U.S. district 
court. 
Now, she was also instrumental in 
the well-known and profoundly signifi-
cant case of Brown v. Board of Edu-
cation, argued by Thurgood Marshall, 
and she won every one of the cases that 
she argued before the U.S. Supreme 
Court. I have argued four; she argued 
ten. Her record surpasses almost any of 
the litigators who have become judges. 
Not only will she be the first Black 
woman on the U.S. Supreme Court, 
Justice Jackson will be the first public 
defender. What does that mean? She 
has represented people who couldn’t af-
ford a lawyer. There is nobody on this 
Court who has represented people who 
couldn’t afford a lawyer as a full-time 
profession or public defender. She has 
more experience as a trial lawyer and a 
trial judge combined than anybody on 
the U.S. Supreme Court now and prob-
ably over the last century. 
She has academic credentials that 
are superlative. She has written and 
taught and counseled in ways that give 
her insights into the real-life meaning 
of the law and its real impact on peo-
ple. 
It has also given her an emotional in-
telligence. There is no question that 
she is qualified by virtue of intellect 
and intelligence. Book smart—there is 
no question that she is book smart, but 
she is also people smart. She under-
stands, as Justice Breyer has, as well, 
that all of these abstruse legalisms, all 
of the abstract concepts in law, all the 
technical distinctions, all of the ver-
biage—they have a real-life impact 
when they are words in a statute, when

they are words in a legal opinion, when 
they are words from the mouths of 
judges or Justices—Federal or State. 
She understands that real-life impact, 
which gives her more than intellect. It 
gives her emotional intelligence. 
I will say that I have talked to Judge 
Jackson about her feelings, her in-
stincts at critical decision points as a 
judge. In sentencing, when she knew 
that another person’s life was in her 
hands, metaphorically, and when an-
other person’s future was within her 
decision-making power, she has looked 
at sentencing decisions with all of the 
data points, all of the emotional intel-
ligence, all of the judgment that she 
has advanced so movingly in her con-
versations with us, as well as her ap-
pearance before our committee. 
She has that capacity for empathy 
that very few people have. A lot of peo-
ple can go to school and can graduate 
with honors. They can be book smart, 
but she understands the impact of law 
on real lives and real people. It is those 
people whose lives are touched by the 
justice system. Whether they are vic-
tims or criminal defendants or liti-
gants dealing with personal or profes-
sional conflict, their stories shone 
through her conversations with us and 
her testimony before our committee 
and her enthusiasm for the law, be-
cause judges are the face and voice of 
justice, and representation matters. 
It matters for the legitimacy and 
credibility of our judicial system that 
our judges look like America, that 
somebody coming into a courtroom 
sees that that Justice has that face and 
voice that can relate to them. 
Judge Jackson will bring to the U.S. 
Supreme Court all those immensely 
important qualities and, certainly, she 
will bring a lot of patience and perse-
verance. She has shown those qualities, 
but also grace and dignity, in the way 
that she responded to some of the abu-
sive, demanding questions that she was 
asked during our hearing. She has 
weathered that storm with extraor-
dinary distinction and diligence. When 
some of our colleagues went low, she 
went high, to paraphrase Michelle 
Obama. 
When she was attacked for not claim-
ing a ‘‘judicial philosophy,’’ she point-
ed to the decisions and opinions and 
disclaimed a judicial philosophy, just 
as Chief Justice Roberts did when he 
was asked in his hearing about judicial 
philosophy and he said he had no 
‘‘overarching judicial philosophy’’ and, 
instead, described his role as ‘‘call[ing] 
balls and strikes.’’ 
She said she knew her lane. She does, 
indeed, know her lane. She maybe 
didn’t use the same terminology, but it 
is that objectivity and impartiality 
that Chief Justice Roberts described 
that will also guide her as a matter of 
principle and philosophy. 
There were other criticisms of Judge 
Jackson, and one conservative com-
mentator described these attacks as 
‘‘meritless to the point of dema-
goguery.’’ He was right. The concocted 
outrage, the straw man, the old griev-
ances, the ancient complaints about 
past hearings and the treatment of 
nominees, all will fade and be forgotten 
because what shone through her per-
formance was her integrity, her depth 
and warmth, her grace and dignity. 
Far from being soft on crime, very 
movingly, she described what it is like 
to have a family member who walks a 
beat because her brother is a cop and 
her uncle, a chief of police. She de-
scribed the worries, concerns, even fear 
that family members have when their 
relatives are police—when their broth-
er or uncle puts himself in harm’s way. 
And that is probably the reason she has 
been endorsed by the largest rank-and- 
file enforcement organization in the 
country, the Fraternal Order of Police, 
as well as the International Associa-
tion of Chiefs of Police, high-ranking 
officials from the Department of Jus-
tice, and nearly 100 former assistant 
U.S. attorneys, many of whom ob-
served her work as a judge firsthand. 
Some may have tried to smear her, 
but they failed abysmally, fortunately. 
She had a reversal rate of about 2 per-
cent, well below the rate that the aver-
age district judge has in the DC Cir-
cuit. And she has been endorsed, as 
well, by former colleagues who were 
appointed by Republican judges—well- 
respected conservative judges who dis-
agreed with her in the outcome of cases 
but who deeply respected the way she 
called those balls and strikes in the 
best and truest sense of the term. 
And she has shown her independence. 
She has ruled for and against the 
Trump administration. She has ruled 
for and against labor and collective 
bargaining, for and against qualified 
immunity, for and against class certifi-
cation, because her philosophy and her 
‘‘methodology,’’ to use her word, is to 
follow the facts and the law, and that 
is what she will do as a Justice on the 
U.S. Supreme Court. 
Let me just finish, finally, with, 
maybe, what I think is going to be 
most important about Justice Jackson. 
She is a unifier and a consensus 
builder. She is someone who can build 
bridges among colleagues and even ad-
versaries. She has been confirmed on a 
bipartisan basis three times already by 
the Senate because she is a bridge 
builder, and the Court needs a bridge 
builder now more than ever. It has 
been politicized and polarized in a way 
that undermines respect and trust in 
the American people. Partly, it is the 
self-inflicted wounds of the Court, 
which have been dominated in many 
decisions by a far-right coalition that 
have made it look political, and that 
perception is deeply important because 
the Court’s trust and respect depend on 
the public perceiving it to be above 
politics. 
So the Court has inflicted wounds on 
itself, but so have the Congress and the 
political branch inflicted wounds on 
the Court by dragging it through a 
seemingly political process and making 
nominations and appointments seem to 
be the result of partisan politics, so 
that it may be perceived as just an-
other political branch. 
I said at the very start that I have 
reverence for the Court and deep re-
spect for it as an institution. It has no 
armies or police. It has no power of the 
purse. Its authority depends on its 
credibility. 
My hope is that Judge Jackson as 
Justice Jackson will help elevate it in 
a way that it needs now more than 
ever. I asked her about a code of ethics 
for the U.S. Supreme Court, and she 
said she would talk to her colleagues 
about it. I feel she has an under-
standing of the need now for the Court 
to adopt a code of ethics. 
It is the only judicial body that lacks 
a code of ethics. It has none. Unlike 
the 
appellate 
courts, 
the 
district 
courts, the U.S. magistrate, the court 
of claims—all of the minor judicial 
bodies in the United States—it has no 
code of ethics because it has resisted a 
code of ethics. Its credibility now de-
pends on its having a code of ethics. 
Recent events have severely imper-
iled credibility and trust, and that 
peril will grow as more becomes known 
about some of these events. But the 
Court can help itself by supporting a 
code of ethics rather than resisting it. 
Judge Jackson’s commitment to talk 
to her colleagues about it is a very wel-
come and important step. She said it in 
response to a question that I asked. I 
was the only member of the committee 
to ask about a code of ethics—surpris-
ingly, to me. But restoring credibility 
and trust will be important to our Na-
tion. Her service will help restore and 
inspire confidence. Her presence and 
active participation on the Court will 
help that task of reinvigorating credi-
bility and trust. 
Her confirmation will be, indeed, a 
giant leap forward into the present and 
the future. It will inspire lots of young 
girls, lots of young women, lots of 
Black women, lots of Americans to be-
lieve in the American dream and to be-
lieve and see the law in different ways. 
That is what one of the young girls 
who wrote to Judge Jackson said in her 
letter, indeed, that she would look at 
the law in a different way. 
We will look at the law in a different 
way, and we will look at the Court in a 
different way because the Court will 
look and hopefully think more like 
America. 
I am looking forward to that vote. I 
will never cast a vote in this body that 
I am more proud and excited to do. 
I thank all of my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle, and hopefully there 
will be more on the other side of the 
aisle 
joining 
us 
for 
this 
historic 
achievement for our Nation. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1973 
April 5, 2022 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, in the 
last few weeks, we have heard a lot 
about and from Judge Ketanji Brown 
Jackson. 
I would like to start off by congratu-
lating Judge Jackson and her family 
on her nomination. I had a wonderful 
meeting with the judge last week. She 
is a highly qualified attorney. I would 
also like to congratulate her for mak-
ing it through the Senate Judiciary 
Committee. The hearing process can be 
grueling, but it is extremely impor-
tant. 
Judge 
Jackson 
demonstrated 
grace under pressure. However, I have 
concerns about Judge Jackson’s nomi-
nation and will not be supporting her 
confirmation to the Supreme Court. 
Perhaps 
my 
greatest 
issue 
with 
Judge Jackson is her lack of adherence 
to a judicial philosophy. I have been 
very clear with each Supreme Court 
nominee since I took office that I am 
looking to support a nominee who pre-
scribes to originalism. Judge Jackson 
explained during the Senate Judiciary 
hearing that she abides by a judicial 
‘‘methodology’’ instead of a philos-
ophy. This means, according to her, 
that she begins at a neutral position to 
understand the facts and to interpret 
the law, receives all the appropriate in-
puts, and then interprets the law. 
While I would hope that all judges, 
no matter which court they sit on, ap-
proach their rulings from a neutral po-
sition and evaluate all applicable court 
filings, Judge Jackson’s methodology 
says nothing about the way she under-
stands and subsequently interprets the 
law. 
In my mind, there are three areas of 
the law a judge must evaluate: the 
meaning of the Constitution, statutes, 
and case precedents. Different theories 
of interpretation sometimes lead to 
different answers about the meaning of 
each of these different areas, which is 
why it is vitally important to know 
what a Supreme Court nominee’s phi-
losophy is. 
For example, Justice Breyer, whom 
Judge Jackson clerked for and is nomi-
nated to replace on the Court, often de-
scribed his own judicial philosophy as 
pragmatic. As a result, Justice Breyer 
balances the interests and values sur-
rounding a case. 
While I don’t agree with Justice 
Breyer’s 
method 
of 
interpretation, 
Judge Jackson won’t even commit to 
abiding by this judicial philosophy, and 
this is very troubling. If a Justice’s 
legal 
interpretation 
has 
no 
philo-
sophical grounding, that provides flexi-
bility for a Justice to bend their think-
ing to achieve a desired outcome in-
stead of following a structured anal-
ysis. We have enough politicians in the 
legislative branch; we don’t need any 
in the courts, especially the Supreme 
Court. 
My concerns with Judge Jackson’s 
apparent lack of a judicial philosophy 
are magnified by her other progressive 
and activist choices. Case in point: her 
lax 
stance 
on 
the 
sentencing 
of 
pedophiles. The laws she applied sim-
ply hold those who distribute child por-
nography accountable, considering how 
often these offenders recidivate. In-
stead, Judge Jackson went out of her 
way to articulate her discomfort with 
imposing sentences based upon, in her 
words, ‘‘outdated laws’’ because the na-
ture of child pornography distribution 
has changed. For the children depicted 
in these heinous images, it really 
doesn’t matter how they are distrib-
uted. Judge Jackson afforded leniency 
to offenders and previewed for all of us 
how she applies outdated laws to mod-
ern problems. 
Going further, when asked if she sup-
ports expanding the number of Justices 
on the Supreme Court, Judge Jackson 
refused to reject that position. Perhaps 
echoing this thought process during 
the Senate Judiciary hearing, Judge 
Jackson commented that she would be 
‘‘thrilled to be one of however many’’ 
Justices. This tells me everything I 
need to know. 
In 
addition, 
Judge 
Jackson’s 
unverified stance on life issues gives 
me great pause. During several ex-
changes at the hearing, Judge Jackson 
refused to acknowledge when the life of 
an unborn child begins. As a result, the 
only information I have to evaluate is 
her previous decision supporting a Mas-
sachusetts law that created a buffer 
zone preventing pro-life sidewalk coun-
selors 
from 
approaching 
expectant 
mothers outside of abortion clinics. 
Without an articulated process on 
how the judge would approach a life 
question in combination with this 
troubling decision, I have no reassur-
ance that the judge will not take an ac-
tivist stance. I cannot and will not ac-
cept this answer. 
Finally, I am deeply concerned at 
Judge Jackson’s response when asked 
to define a woman. The judge re-
sponded that she is not a biologist. 
Well, folks, I am not a biologist either, 
but it seems pretty common sense to 
me. I can tell you the voters of Iowa 
didn’t have to think about the answer 
to this question when they elected me 
as the first woman to represent Iowa in 
the U.S. Senate. I can tell you the 
Taliban didn’t have to think about the 
answer to this question when they 
closed the doors of schools to female 
students 2 weeks ago. And I can tell 
you President Biden didn’t have to 
think about the answer to this ques-
tion when he nominated Judge Jackson 
as the first Black woman to the Su-
preme Court. 
While I am grateful Judge Jackson 
believes science is the basis for deter-
mining a woman, I am deeply con-
cerned that a fellow woman who is set 
to define the contours of laws that are 
specific to women has to even think 
about an answer to that question. 
So Judge Jackson’s language, or lack 
thereof, speaks volumes for me, and I 
cannot support her nomination for a 
lifetime appointment on our Nation’s 
highest Court. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Presi-
dent, I ask unanimous consent that the 
order for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. HAS-
SAN). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Presi-
dent, later this week, the full Senate 
will take up and vote on the nomina-
tion of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson 
to be an Associate Justice of the Su-
preme Court of the United States. 
Over the last several weeks, the Con-
gress and the country and, indeed, the 
world have gotten to know Judge Jack-
son. We have learned about her broad 
life experience, her exceptional career, 
her deep love of the law. 
Judge Jackson endured a verbal mar-
athon of intense questioning from 
members of the Judiciary Committee. 
She endured challenging and some-
times specious lines of questioning 
from some of our colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle, but through it 
all, she shined. She approached every 
moment of the hearing with grace, 
with wisdom, and with brilliance. Her 
good judgment and sharp mind were on 
full display for all to see. She was 
unshakable; she was inspiring. 
If confirmed, she will make history 
as the first Black woman to sit on the 
highest Court of the land. With Judge 
Jackson on the top Bench, we will get 
one step closer to ensuring that the Su-
preme Court of the United States looks 
like the Nation it serves; and with 
Judge Jackson on the highest Court, 
we will be even closer to realizing the 
noble ideal inscribed on the face of the 
Supreme Court building: ‘‘Equal Jus-
tice Under Law.’’ 
Her confirmation will be a victory for 
all of America. 
My State of Maryland is also proud 
to have a small connection with Judge 
Jackson. Not only did she reside in 
Maryland for a period of time, but her 
brother served on the Baltimore Police 
Department for 7 years, and he has also 
served two tours of duty as a member 
of the Maryland National Guard. Other 
members of her family also pursued ca-
reers in public service. Two of her un-
cles were police officers, and her par-
ents were public school teachers. 
Like her family members, Ketanji 
Brown Jackson has taken up the man-
tle of public service as a public de-
fender, as a member of the U.S. Sen-
tencing Commission, as a district court 
judge, and as a Federal circuit court 
judge. 
It is no mystery as to why her nomi-
nation has been met with widespread 
praise. She has been lauded by the Fra-
ternal Order of Police and by the Inter-
national Association of Chiefs of Po-
lice. Prominent Republican-appointed 
judges and lawyers have spoken in 
favor of her confirmation. The Amer-
ican Bar Association listed her as

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1974 
April 5, 2022 
‘‘well-qualified’’ for the position to 
which she has been nominated—their 
highest rating. 
There is no question in my mind that 
she will serve our Nation well and with 
distinction as the newest Justice of the 
Supreme Court, and I will vote in favor 
of her confirmation this week, proudly. 
I have watched many of my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
strain to find some justification for 
voting against Judge Jackson. They 
know she is highly qualified. They 
know she is a person of integrity. They 
know she has the training and judg-
ment required of a Supreme Court Jus-
tice. 
Last week, one Republican member 
of the Senate Judiciary Committee 
called Judge Jackson a ‘‘person of ex-
ceptionally good character, respected 
by her peers, and someone who has 
worked hard to achieve her current po-
sition.’’ 
Another Republican member of the 
committee noted that she had ‘‘impec-
cable credentials and a deep knowledge 
of the law.’’ 
You would think these were words 
leading up to state support for Judge 
Jackson, but in both of those cases, 
those Senators have announced their 
decisions to vote against her. The pat-
tern is the same for too many of our 
Republican colleagues. They come out 
and praise Judge Jackson and then an-
nounce they are voting against her. 
So the question is, Why? What is the 
reasoning here? And I have been listen-
ing carefully. 
Many of our colleagues tie their op-
position to what they have called her 
‘‘judicial philosophy.’’ They say Judge 
Jackson will push her own political 
ideology at the expense of the law. 
They say she is going to be an activist 
instead of a judge. They say she will 
create ‘‘new rights from the Constitu-
tion out of whole cloth.’’ In fact, that 
was a quote from my colleague, the 
senior Senator from Texas, who took 
to the floor last week in opposing 
Judge Jackson’s confirmation. 
When my friend from Texas made 
that statement, I happened to be sit-
ting where the Presiding Officer is 
right now, as I was presiding over the 
Senate, and I listened very closely to 
his arguments and others that were 
made along similar lines. None of the 
claims that I have heard hold water 
when you look at the facts because 
here is what Judge Jackson herself said 
during her confirmation hearing when 
asked about judicial restraint: 
I am acutely aware that, as a judge in our 
system, I have limited power, and I am try-
ing in every case to stay in my lane. 
This is not just a hollow promise. 
Judge Jackson has explained to this 
Senate her clear methodology for rul-
ing on cases to ensure that she stays in 
her lane. The methodology is simple. 
Step 1, start from a position of neu-
trality. 
We have all seen the scales of justice. 
We want them to be evenly balanced. 
Everybody who walks into a court 
should get a fair shot. That is step 1. 
Step 2, evaluate all of the facts from 
various perspectives. 
Step 3, apply the law to those facts. 
That is it. She was clear. That is how 
she makes decisions. That is how she 
rules from the bench. 
So 
what 
about 
the 
Constitution 
itself, that great document? What 
about this notion that she would be a 
runaway Justice, ‘‘creating new rights 
from the Constitution out of whole 
cloth’’?—to use the language, the ex-
pression, of some of my colleagues. 
That, too, is just plain wrong. 
Here is Judge Jackson again when 
she said: 
I believe that the Constitution is fixed in 
its meaning. I believe it is appropriate to 
look at the original intent, original public 
meaning of the words when one is trying to 
assess because, again, that is a limitation on 
my authority to import my own policy. 
Judge 
Jackson 
understands 
the 
boundaries of her authority as a judge. 
She has stayed within those boundaries 
for over a decade on the Federal bench. 
So enough of the spurious arguments 
that she is going to be an activist on 
the Court. Her method is clear; it is 
fair; it is balanced and honest, and I 
am confident that her rulings will be 
clear, fair, balanced, and honest. 
Let’s not forget this: There are cer-
tain rights that most Americans would 
acknowledge are central to our Na-
tion’s traditions and values but that 
are not specifically and expressly enu-
merated in the Constitution, not each 
and every one with its own sentence. 
I have a short list here: the right to 
travel, the right to vote, the right to 
privacy, the right to marry. None of 
these rights are explicitly, expressly 
referenced in the text of the Constitu-
tion, but all of them have been derived 
by a close analysis of the letter and 
spirit of our Constitution and laws. 
These are rights we all embrace. These 
are rights the American people don’t 
want elected officials to be able to take 
away from them. 
Let’s 
not forget that the First 
Amendment, as written, only protects 
Americans from Federal action, from 
congressional action, that would vio-
late their right to freedom of religion, 
press, speech, and assembly. 
Over time, the Court has taken ac-
tion to protect these rights in the face 
of all government action, whether Fed-
eral or State or local, to make sure 
that those rights are protected against 
all government action no matter what 
its source. 
Justices appointed by Presidents of 
both parties have worked to protect 
rights Americans hold dear. 
President Reagan’s appointee Justice 
Anthony Kennedy wrote the majority 
opinion in the case of Obergefell v. 
Hodges, which protects the rights of 
same-sex couples to marry. His fellow 
Reagan appointee Sandra Day O’Con-
nor joined the majority in the case of 
Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which 
reaffirmed the reproductive liberties 
guaranteed under Roe v. Wade. 
Let’s be clear: The Supreme Court 
considers the most challenging ques-
tions in American law. Judge Jackson 
will have to take on these challenging 
questions, like her peers on the Court, 
if she is confirmed; but one thing is 
crystal clear from her testimony and 
from the record: She will apply the law 
based on the facts. She will not be a 
partisan in a robe. She will be a fair, 
independent Justice of the Supreme 
Court, and she is very deserving of that 
title. 
I had the great privilege of meeting 
with Judge Jackson just yesterday. 
During our conversation, I was struck, 
again, by her brilliance, her intel-
ligence, her kindness, and resolve. That 
came across on television during the 
hearings, but it was very evident in our 
one-on-one meeting. I thought about 
another Supreme Court nominee who 
broke barriers nearly 55 years ago, a 
man from Baltimore, MD: Thurgood 
Marshall. He was the first Black man 
to serve on the Supreme Court of the 
United States. 
So, during my conversation with 
Judge Jackson, I invited her to join me 
in West Baltimore at P.S. 103. This is 
public school building 103. It is in West 
Baltimore. It is the school where 
Thurgood Marshall learned to read and 
write. It is no longer an active school. 
The building is in bad condition. Just 
this year, as part of the omnibus appro-
priations bill, Senator CARDIN and I 
were able to secure some Federal funds 
to help renovate that building and to 
turn it into a living memorial to Jus-
tice Thurgood Marshall and to expand 
opportunities for people in West Balti-
more. So I told Judge Jackson that 
once she gets settled, it would be a 
great honor and privilege to bring her, 
the first Black woman on the Supreme 
Court, to the place where the first 
Black man on the Court grew up and 
went to school. 
Justice Thurgood Marshall inspired a 
generation of leaders and public serv-
ants to enter the legal field. Soon, Jus-
tice Ketanji Brown Jackson will do the 
same. Young people from all across our 
country will look at the Supreme 
Court of the United States and feel 
more included. Her presence on the 
Court will be a victory for ‘‘we the peo-
ple.’’ 
In 1978, Justice Thurgood Marshall 
said to a group of university graduates: 
This is your democracy. Make it. Protect 
it. Pass it on. 
I am deeply honored to work along-
side my colleagues in the Senate to ad-
vance that vision, as we all strive to 
form a more perfect Union. And there 
is no doubt in my mind—no doubt at 
all—that elevating Judge Jackson to 
Justice Jackson will make our Union a 
little more perfect. 
I yield the floor.

CONSOLIDATED APPROPRIATIONS 
ACT 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that this letter 
to the Senate Archivist be printed in

There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
CHARLES E. GRASSLEY, 
PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE EMERITUS, 
Washington, DC, April 1, 2022. 
KAREN D. PAUL, 
Senate Archivist, Senate Historical Office, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR MS. PAUL: I understand that you 
have been charged with implementing a pro-
vision in the Consolidated Appropriations 
Act, 2022 that offered a very limited number 
of senators up to $2.5 million each for the 
preservation of their records. This is a 
shocking amount of money, well beyond 
what could possibly be necessary for proc-
essing and preserving records, even for long 
serving senators with a lot of records. On 
September 22, 2021, my staff alerted the Sen-
ate Legislative Branch Appropriations Sub-
committee of my decision not to accept any 
of the funding being proposed. It was my un-
derstanding at that time that the Appropria-
tions Committee would reduce the funding 
appropriated accordingly. 
With a budget deficit for the current fiscal 
year expected to be well over $1 Trillion, and 
ballooning debt that is on pace to reach an 
all-time record as a share of our economy 
within 10 years, spending millions of tax-
payer dollars on a handful of senators’ 
records cannot be justified. The tradition in 
the Senate is for academic institutions to 
agree to store and manage former senators’ 
records as part of their academic mission. 
Some senators seek to go beyond simple 
preservations of records and establish cen-
ters to perpetuate their legacy. However, 
funds for new facilities or other functions be-
yond simply storing records are traditionally 
raised privately. The taxpayers should NOT 
be on the hook for senators’ legacy projects. 
As a working senator, lam not focused on my 
legacy. I often say that my legacy will be de-
cided by historians decades into the future 
with the benefit of hindsight. As such, my 
legacy is not something I can or should 
worry about. 
Again, I did not seek these funds and I op-
pose their expenditure. I ask that you not 
transmit paperwork to the future repository 
of my records. I also ask that any funding 
that is eligible to be spent on the preserva-
tion of my records remain in the Treasury to 
reduce the deficit. 
Sincerely, 
CHUCK GRASSLEY, 
United States Senator. 
PS: Read and signed by this Senator. 
f 
NOMINATION OF KETANJI BROWN 
JACKSON 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, 
I rise today in support of the nomina-
tion of Ketanji Brown Jackson to be an 
Associate Justice on the U.S. Supreme 
Court. I have had the privilege of serv-
ing in this body for nearly three dec-
ades now. 
In that time, I have participated in 
the confirmation hearings of 10 Su-
preme Court Justices and hundreds of 
nominees to our Federal circuit and 
district courts. I have carefully scruti-
nized Judge Jackson’s record and lis-
tened very closely to her testimony. In 
my view, Judge Jackson is both well 
qualified and extremely prepared to 
take on the important role of serving 
on the U.S. Supreme Court. 
Judge Jackson is a graduate of both 
Harvard University and Harvard Law 
School, a former Supreme Court clerk, 
a former Federal public defender, and a 
former U.S. Sentencing Commissioner. 
On top of that, Judge Jackson has 
served as a federal judge for nearly a 
decade. 
Judge Jackson would be the first 
Federal public defender to sit on the 
Supreme Court and the first Justice 
since Thurgood Marshall with signifi-
cant experience representing low-in-
come defendants in criminal cases. As 
a former public defender, Judge Jack-
son truly understands the power of our 
constitutional rights, including the 
Sixth Amendment right to counsel and 
the Fifth Amendment right to due 
process. Judge Jackson would also join 
Justice Sotomayor as the only former 
Federal district court judges serving on 
the Supreme Court. 
What has impressed me most about 
Judge Jackson does not appear on her 
resume. That is Judge Jackson’s stead-
fast commitment to the fair and impar-
tial application of the law, her deep 
knowledge of the U.S. Constitution, 
and her remarkable judicial tempera-
ment. 
These 
qualities 
were 
dem-
onstrated in her testimony before the 
Judiciary 
Committee 
earlier 
this 
month. They were also shown in the 
letters and testimony of the many peo-
ple—of all ideological viewpoints—who 
have supported Judge Jackson’s nomi-
nation. 
First, Judge Jackson’s respect for 
the law and the Constitution are clear 
from the nearly 600 legal opinions she 
has drafted as a Federal judge. Her 
legal opinions are clear and detailed. 
As she explained during her confirma-
tion hearings, Judge Jackson carefully 
and fairly applies the law to the spe-
cific facts of each case. And Judge 
Jackson takes the time to explain why 
she reached each decision. In my view, 
it is important that the decisions of 
the Supreme Court are accessible to 
the American people. Judge Jackson’s 
approach to judicial decision-making 
will help to ensure transparency in her 
judging and help to restore the public’s 
confidence in the decisions of the Su-
preme Court. 
Second, Judge Jackson clearly has 
deep legal knowledge. During her more 
than 20 hours of testimony before the 
Judiciary Committee, she spoke with 
skill on a wide range of topics. She ad-
dressed legal issues of all kinds, includ-
ing separation of powers, the First 
Amendment, 
administrative 
law, 
criminal sentencing, and much more. I 
believe Judge Jackson has the knowl-
edge and expertise to decide the most 
difficult and pressing legal issues fac-
ing this Nation. 
Finally, during her hearings, Judge 
Jackson also showed that she has a re-
markable temperament. Lawyers and 
judges who have worked with her, or 
appeared before her, have confirmed 
that Judge Jackson brings this tem-
perament with her in all aspects of her 
work. They have told the Senate that 
she is as collegial, calm, and steadfast 
as she appeared to be during her hear-
ings. 
For example, Judge Thomas Griffith 
testified in support of Judge Jackson’s 
nomination and focused on her char-
acter and temperament, in addition to 
her exceptional qualifications. Judge 
Griffith is a retired judge of the D.C. 
Circuit and was appointed to the bench 
by President George W. Bush. Judge 
Griffith said that Judge Jackson has 
modeled the ideal qualities of a judge, 
including diligence, carefulness, high 
character, deep legal knowledge, and 
broad experience. 
Witnesses from the American Bar As-
sociation also testified about Judge 
Jackson’s sterling reputation for integ-
rity. Those witnesses interviewed law-
yers and judges who have known and 
worked with Judge Jackson at various 
points over the course of her career. 
And, in those interviews, lawyers and 
judges who were familiar with Judge 
Jackson uniformly praised her char-
acter. They called her ‘‘first rate,’’ 
‘‘impeccable,’’ and ‘‘beyond reproach.’’ 
One comment said: ‘‘You write the 
word ‘integrity,’ and then you put her 
initials next to it.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1976 
April 5, 2022 
The 
American 
Bar 
Association’s 
interviews also revealed that prosecu-
tors and defense attorneys alike regard 
Judge Jackson as fair, balanced, and 
unbiased. She is precisely the kind of 
Justice we need on the Supreme Court. 
Judge Jackson is plainly up to the task 
of faithfully interpreting our Constitu-
tion and our laws and fairly applying 
the law in each and every case. 
Judge Jackson laid out in simple 
terms the three-part methodology she 
uses in each case to ensure that her de-
cisions are informed by the arguments 
of the parties, the facts, and the law, 
and not by any personal views she may 
hold. 
Judge 
Jackson’s 
thoughtful 
methodology shows that she appre-
ciates how important it is for judges to 
approach each and every case with an 
open mind and to avoid both actual and 
perceived conflicts of interest. 
I believe Judge Jackson is an ex-
traordinary person. Her rich family 
history in law enforcement and her 
background as a Federal public de-
fender, a member of the U.S. Sen-
tencing Commission, a trial judge, and 
an appellate judge will benefit our Su-
preme Court. 
It will be my great pleasure to vote 
to confirm Judge Jackson to be an As-
sociate Justice on the Supreme Court. 
And I hope that my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle will do the same. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO ERIC CIOPPA 
Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I 
rise today to honor Eric Cioppa, the su-
perintendent of the Maine Bureau of 
Insurance, who recently retired after 
more than three decades of distin-
guished public service to the State of 
Maine. Throughout his time at the bu-
reau, Eric’s leadership and service have 
benefited all Mainers and have contrib-
uted to the financial health of Mainers. 
Eric joined the bureau in 1988 as a 
statistician before being named super-
visor of the workers’ compensation sec-
tion. I had the pleasure of working di-
rectly with Eric when I was commis-
sioner of the Maine Department of Pro-
fessional and Financial Regulation. In 
1998, he was promoted to deputy super-
intendent and was then appointed to 
the position of superintendent of the 
Maine Bureau of Insurance by Gov-
ernor Paul LePage in 2011, a position to 
which he was unanimously confirmed, 
and then reconfirmed in 2017 to serve 
another 5-year term. 
Throughout his service as super-
intendent, Eric’s work has touched the 
lives of nearly every citizen in Maine. 
His tireless commitment to protecting 
insurance consumers, while also sup-
porting ongoing competition and inno-
vation in Maine’s insurance industry, 
will leave a lasting positive impact on 
the 
State. 
Furthermore, 
numerous 
Governors have benefited from Eric’s 
guidance and expertise on a wide range 
of insurance issues for decades, and his 
deep knowledge of Maine’s insurance 
industry will be missed by all policy-
makers. 
Outside of Maine, Eric has been heav-
ily involved in helping to set national 
priorities and developing new laws and 
regulations through his longtime serv-
ice with the National Association of In-
surance 
Commissioners, 
NAIC. 
At 
NAIC, he has served as the associa-
tion’s president, vice president, and 
secretary, among other positions. At-
tributable to his stellar reputation, 
Eric was appointed by his peers at 
NAIC to serve a 2-year term as the 
State 
insurance 
commissioner 
rep-
resentative on the Financial Stability 
Oversight Council in 2018 and was re-
elected for another 2-year term in 2020. 
Eric has also been an invaluable re-
source for me on insurance issues going 
back to my time as commissioner of 
the Maine Department of Professional 
and Financial Regulation. Throughout 
my service in the Senate, Eric has con-
tinued to provide wise counsel and ad-
vice to both me and my staff, and his 
wisdom and insight will be greatly 
missed. 
Eric exemplifies the ideal public 
servant, and there is no doubt that 
Mainers are better off because of his 
longtime dedication to protecting and 
serving the public. I wish him and his 
family all the best as they embark on 
their next chapter.

TRIBUTE 
TO 
REVEREND 
KEN 
DEGROOT AND SISTER MELANIE 
MACZKA 
Ms. BALDWIN. Madam President, I 
rise today to honor the lives, careers, 
and achievements of Reverend Ken 
DeGroot and Sister Melanie Maczka. 
Together, Reverend Ken and Sister 
Melanie 
created 
the 
Casa 
ALBA 
Melanie a community center dedicated 
to serving the Hispanic population of 
the greater Green Bay area. Through 
Casa ALBA Melanie, and their ministe-
rial service, Reverend Ken and Sister 
Melanie have welcomed members of the 
Hispanic community to our State with 
open arms for over 25 years. 
It was 1991 when Reverend Ken first 
encountered the mission which would 
encompass the rest of his career. Two 
young men, fresh off the train from 
Mexico and at his doorstep, were tired, 
hungry, and could not speak English. 
Far from home and looking for a house 
of worship, Reverend Ken welcomed 
them into St. Willebrord parish. He de-
cided that night that Green Bay could 
be the home they searched for. 
They would find they were not alone. 
Thousands of people from Central and 
South America already lived in their 
community, working in a world where 
they could not speak the language. 
Today, it is estimated that at least 
20,500 Hispanics live in the greater 
Green Bay area, and about 28 percent 
of the Green Bay school population is 
Hispanic. Alongside Sister Melanie, 
Reverend Ken decided things had to 
change. They traveled to Mexico, vis-
iting villages, learning the culture and 
language of the neighbors they had 
never known they had. When they re-
turned to Green Bay, they knew they 
could work to better serve the Hispanic 
community. 
In 2012, Reverend Ken and Sister 
Melanie 
established 
Casa 
ALBA 
Melanie and transformed the quality of 
life for Hispanic families by providing 
legal assistance, health services, lan-
guage acquisition, Spanish GED les-
sons, financial assistance, and, perhaps 
most importantly, a safe haven for 
Green Bay’s Spanish speaking resi-
dents. 
This year, Casa ALBA Melanie cele-
brates its 10-year anniversary and with 
this great celebration comes a change 
in leadership. Reverend Ken, who has 
served as chair of the development 
committee and the finance committee, 
and Sister Melanie who has served as 
executive director, will both retire 
from the impactful organization they 
helped guide over this past decade. 
Their work is an inspiration to all peo-
ple seeking to create a more equitable 
and welcoming America. 
I extend my sincere thanks and ap-
preciation to Reverend Ken DeGroot 
and Sister Melanie Maczka for their 
leadership at Casa ALBA Melanie and 
throughout the greater Green Bay 
community.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
REMEMBERING LANE R. WILLIAMS 
∑ Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, along 
with my colleagues Senator and Rep-
resentative RUSS FULCHER, I recognize 
the life of an extraordinary Idahoan, 
Lane R. Williams, who passed away in 
February. Lane was the former owner 
of Midvale Telephone Exchange and is 
remembered for his commitment to ad-
vancing opportunities for others. This 
includes his role in keeping the Weiser 
area 
north 
to 
McCall 
connected 
through his telephone company. 
His obituary reads, ‘‘Lane left behind 
a legacy of championing the underdog 
and empowering people by creating 
possibilities and opportunities. He did 
this in part by being an educator of 
many, including years spent working 
with migrant workers as a teacher. He 
always believed that education was the 
key to empowerment.’’ In 1977, Lane 
took over Midvale Telephone Exchange 
from his parents and, with his wife 
Mary Gaile, began expanding service to 
five Idaho communities and to the re-
mote Cascabel community in southern 
Arizona before building four additional 
areas throughout Arizona. This expan-
sion is credited with enabling more 
than 4,000 people in rural areas to have 
internet and phone service and employ-
ing over 45 people. In 2008, Lane created 
an employee stock ownership plan, 
ESOP, and sold the company to his em-
ployees to help ensure their continued 
employment and security in retire-
ment. 
Lane was one of those industrious 
and inspiring people who figure out 
ways to help and encourage improve-
ments in their community, and do

them. Some years after his beloved 
wife Mary Gaile passed, he met his wife 
Elsa Freeman, who again enlightened 
his life with love and companionship. 
The two bought and restored the 
Midvale Mercantile. The project’s ben-
efits to the community include, pro-
viding jobs, a local grocery source, 
community kitchen, community gar-
den, and lodging for travelers. They 
also started Midvale Marketplace, Inc., 
a nonprofit focused on identifying com-
munity needs; creating service, edu-
cation, and employment opportunities; 
and developing and supporting sustain-
able economic growth. Lane was also 
instrumental in developing the Weiser 
River Trail, and worked hard to main-
tain and improve the park and trail. 
As we recognize the good Lane Wil-
liams did for his treasured community 
of Midvale and far beyond, we extend 
our deep condolences to Lane’s friends 
and loved ones, including his wife Elsa 
Freeman, children, grandchildren, and 
great-grandchildren. His love, compas-
sion, and open-heartedness will endure 
in the many lives he touched during his 
life well lived.∑ 
f 
RECOGNIZING IDAHO’S 
COMMUNITY COLLEGES 
∑ Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, along 
with my colleagues Senator JIM RISCH, 
Representative MIKE SIMPSON, and Rep-
resentative RUSS FULCHER, we honor 
Idaho’s community colleges during this 
Community College Month. 
In order to meet the needs of a com-
petitive job market, the importance of 
providing Idahoans with the oppor-
tunity to enhance their education has 
grown tremendously. Idaho’s four com-
munity colleges are a central part of 
preparing young people and adults for 
postsecondary education, successful ca-
reers, and productive lives. 
Our community colleges not only 
link students to Idaho’s 4-year institu-
tions through cooperative agreements, 
but also provide dual enrollment oppor-
tunities 
for 
students 
pursuing 
ad-
vanced learning while in high school 
through partnerships with the K–12 sec-
tor. Through collaboration with Ida-
ho’s business community, Idaho’s com-
munity colleges also help grow the 
skillset necessary to prepare students 
for Idaho’s workforce. 
The recognition of April as Commu-
nity College Month by the American 
Association of Community Colleges 
and the Association of Community Col-
lege Trustees provides an opportunity 
to spotlight the valued role of Idaho’s 
community colleges in enhancing Ida-
hoans’ quality of life and contributing 
to Idaho’s economic success. We com-
mend Idaho’s community colleges and 
the educators who inform and inspire 
through these local assets for being a 
conduit for opportunities for so many 
Idahoans.∑ 
TRIBUTE TO OFFICER SAMANTHA 
FAORO 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Madam President, we 
have all heard the phrase ‘‘law enforce-
ment family.’’ This law enforcement 
family is a diverse family with rep-
resentatives from all walks of life. This 
family is not bound by traditions of 
race, religion, color, or sex. This family 
is all inclusive. Today, I want to pro-
vide an example of this family and how 
they came together to save the life of 
a fellow law enforcement officer. 
On January 28, 2022, Kentucky State 
Police Trooper Michael Sanguini was 
shot multiple times while conducting a 
traffic stop in Harrison County. Ac-
cording to the preliminary investiga-
tion, he was struck six times, of which 
three shots were stopped by his bal-
listic vest. One shot struck his portable 
radio, and another struck his issued 
taser, with one shot striking his body. 
Although many officers from mul-
tiple agencies responded to assist the 
injured trooper, I want to recognize 
Kentucky Fish and Wildlife Officer 
Samantha Faoro for her quick response 
and 
actions 
of

Officer 
Samantha Faoro is a native of Colo-
rado, who moved to Kentucky to pur-
sue her career with the Kentucky De-
partment of Fish and Wildlife. She 
graduated from the police academy in 
February 2021 and was assigned to work 
in Harrison County. Officer Faoro 
comes from a family of first respond-
ers, continuing the life of service to

Kentucky. 
Officer Faoro was working in the 
area of Cynthiana, KY, when she heard 
Trooper Sanguini state he had been 
shot. Without hesitation, Officer Faoro 
responded directly to the scene to pro-
vide assistance to a fellow officer in 
need. Upon arrival to the scene, she ob-
served the wounded trooper and quick-
ly transported him to the hospital. 
Trooper 
Sanguini 
quickly

School Lunch Program (NSLP) provide nu-
tritionally balanced, free school meals to 
millions of American children each school 
day; and 
Whereas, Under the SBP and NSLP, chil-
dren may be determined categorically eligi-
ble for free school meals through participa-
tion in certain federal assistance programs, 
such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assist-
ance Program, or based on the child’s status 
as a homeless, migrant, runaway, or foster 
child; and 
Whereas, Under the SBP and NSLP, chil-
dren from families with incomes at or below 
130 percent of the federal poverty level are 
eligible for free school meals; and 
Whereas, Many children are excluded from 
categorical eligibility to receive free school 
meals because they have moved out of the 
foster care system and are in the care of 
grandparents or other relatives who have 
adopted them or have become their legal 
guardians; and 
Whereas, More than 7.8 million children 
under the age of 18 live in homes where the 
householders are grandparents or relatives 
other than their parents; and 
Whereas, The federal ‘‘Caregivers Access 
and Responsible Expansion (CARE) for Kids 
Act of 2019,’’ introduced by United States 
Senator Bob Casey (D–PA), provides auto-
matic eligibility for free school meals to 
children being raised by a relative who re-
ceives adoption or guardianship assistance; 
to children being raised by grandparents or 
other relatives due to placement by a state 
or tribal welfare agency; and to children liv-

Whereas, It is altogether fitting and proper 
to urge the President and Congress of the 
United States to enact the ‘‘CARE for Kids 
Act of 2019,’’ to automatically provide free

It 
Resolved by the Senate of the State of New 
Jersey: 
1. This resolution urges the President and 
Congress of the United States to enact the 
‘‘CARE for Kids Act of 2019,’’ to provide 
automatic eligibility for free school meals to 
American children who are being raised by 
grandparents or relatives other than their 
parents. 
2. Copies of this resolution, as filed with 
the Secretary of State, shall be transmitted 
by the Secretary of the Senate to the Presi-
dent of the United States, Majority and Mi-
nority Leaders of the United States Senate, 
to the Speaker and Minority Leader of the 
United States House of Representatives, and 
to each member of the United States Con-
gress elected from this State. 
POM–126. A joint resolution adopted by the 
Legislature of the State of Colorado memori-
alizing its support for Colorado to be the per-
manent location for the United States Space 
Command, and, in connection therewith, 
urging the Department of Defense to keep 
the United States Space Command in Colo-
rado; to the Committee on Armed Services. 
HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION NO. 22–1012 
Whereas, Our nation and the world have 
significantly benefitted from technological 
and scientific advances resulting from space 
exploration and aerospace activities, and 
Colorado is paving the way for new discov-
eries in the frontiers of space by having a 
rich history in aerospace development and 
being at the forefront of space travel, explo-
ration, and aerospace research; and 
Whereas, Colorado is the acting provisional 
Space Command Base and it will remain the 
provisional base until 2023. Colorado is also 
the center for United States military space 
operations and strategy. According to the 
Colorado Space Coalition (CSC), the state’s 
military commands are the primary cus-
tomers for space-based research, develop-
ment, acquisitions, and operations, rep-
resenting nearly 90 percent of space-related 
expenditure by the military. Moving the 
United 
States 
Space 
Command 
(USSP 
ACECOM) to Huntsville, Alabama, will be in-
credibly disruptive to the National Defense 
Strategy. In addition, it will cause a major 
upheaval in existing infrastructure and jobs 
in the state, which will result in higher costs 
and less efficient outcomes for the United 
States military; and 
Whereas, Colorado is strategically located 
at the center of our national and space de-
fense. We are the home to five key strategic 
military commands: North American Aero-
space Defense Command (NORAD), United 
States Northern Command (USNORTHCOM), 
United States Strategic Command’s Joint 
Functional Component Command for Space 
(JFCC Space) Missile Warning Center, the 
United States Air Force Space Command, 
and the United States Army Space and Mis-
sile Defense Command/Army Forces Stra-
tegic Command; and five military installa-
tions, including United States Space Force 
bases Buckley, Peterson, and Schriever, 
United States Space Force Station Cheyenne 
Mountain, as well as Fort Carson Army 
Base; and 
Whereas, The Space Delta Four at Buckley 
Space Force Base provides operational com-
mand and control of three constellations to 
space-based infrared missile warning sys-
tems, has been defending America continu-
ously since 1970, and is a critical part of 
global defense and national security; and 
Whereas, Colorado leads the charge in 
bringing current and future global posi-
tioning system (GPS) assets to life, a service 
provided free to the world by Air Force 
Space Command in Colorado Springs. From 
the operation of GPS satellites by Schriever 
Space Force Base to GPS III, the most pow-
erful GPS satellite to date—being designed 
and built by Lockheed Martin and launched 
by United Launch Alliance with Raytheon 
developing the command and control capa-
bilities, and with companies such as Boeing, 
Harris Corporation, Braxton Technologies, 
and Infinity Systems Engineering also sup-
porting GPS development and operations 
from locations in Colorado, GPS tech-
nologies enable an integral part of our global 
economy to have an incalculable impact that 
has improved the everyday lives of billions 
of people around the world; and 
Whereas, Colorado’s aerospace industry is 
home to a broad range of companies that cre-
ate products and systems for commercial, 
military, and civil space applications, such 
as spacecraft, launch vehicles, satellites, 
command and control software, sensors, and 
navigation operations. These companies in-
clude Ball Aerospace, Boeing, DigitalGlobe, 
Harris Corporation, Lockheed Martin Space 
Systems, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, Si-
erra Nevada Corporation, Teledyne Brown 
Engineering, and United Launch Alliance, 
which make up a large portion of the aero-
space sector; and 
Whereas, Colorado has an existing edu-
cated workforce, ranked second in the nation 
with residents with a bachelor’s degree or 
higher, and a pipeline of higher education in-
stitutions to sustain future growth. We are 
home to the United States Air Force Acad-
emy and many colleges and universities, in-
cluding the University of Colorado Boulder 
and the University of Colorado Colorado 
Springs, Colorado School of Mines, Colorado 
State University, Metropolitan State Uni-
versity of Denver, University of Denver, Col-
orado Mesa University, and Fort Lewis Col-
lege. Altogether, they provide access to 
world-class aerospace-related degrees and 
offer aerospace companies one of the coun-
try’s most educated workforces; and 
Whereas, Colorado is home to some amaz-
ing research institutions. These institutions 
include the prestigious Laboratory for At-
mospheric and Space Physics (LASP) at the 
University of Colorado Boulder. It began in 
1948, a decade before NASA, and is the 
world’s only research institute to have sent 
instruments to all eight planets and to 
Pluto, combining all aspects of space explo-
ration through science, engineering, mission 
operations, and scientific data analysis; and 
Whereas, Colorado is also home to the Na-
tional Oceanic and Atmospheric Administra-
tion’s (NOAA) Space Weather Prediction 
Center, a world-leading center of predictions 
for the solar and near-Earth space environ-
ment and the nation’s official source of 
watches, warnings, and alerts ofincoming 
solar storms, using satellite observations to 
protect and save lives and property; and 
Whereas, Various organizations are key to 
Colorado’s prominence in aerospace, such as 
the Colorado Space Coalition, a group of in-
dustry stakeholders working to make Colo-
rado a center of excellence for aerospace; the 
Colorado Space Business Roundtable, work-
ing to bring together aerospace stakeholders 
from the industry, government, and aca-
demia for roundtable discussions and busi-
ness development and to encourage grass-
roots citizen participation in aerospace 
issues; the Colorado chapter of Citizens for 
Space Exploration, whose mission is to pro-
mote better understanding of aerospace and 
its importance in our economy and daily 
lives, as well as to promote the importance 
of human space exploration; Manufacturer’s 
Edge, a statewide manufacturing assistance 
center that encourages the strength and 
competitiveness of Colorado manufacturers 
by providing on-site technical assistance 
through coaching, training, and consulting, 
by providing collaboration-focused industry 
programs, and by leveraging government, 
university, and economic development part-
nerships; and the Space Foundation, founded 
in 1983, with its world headquarters in Colo-
rado Springs, Colorado, which holds an an-
nual Space Symposium, bringing together 
civil, commercial, and national security 
space leaders from around the world to dis-
cuss, address, and plan for the future of 
space; and 
Whereas, For the aforementioned reasons, 
it is in the best interests of the American 
taxpayer to keep USSP/ACECOM in the state 
because Colorado is already fulfilling the 
mission of the USSP/ACECOM; because Colo-
rado Springs has in place the community in-
frastructure capacity and community sup-
port to champion an expanding mission; be-
cause the move will cost the United States 
billions of dollars to relocate the facility; 
and because the move would severely disrupt 
the Colorado aerospace industry, which has 
grown to support the mission; Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved by the House of Representatives of 
the Seventy-third General Assembly of the State 
of Colorado, the Senate concurring herein: 
That we, the members of the General As-
sembly: 
(1) Recognizing Colorado’s unique blend of 
military installations and major commands, 
private aerospace companies, academic and 
research institutions, and government enti-
ties, and the valuable synergies this eco-
system produces, strongly urge the Depart-
ment of Defense and the Biden-Harris admin-
istration to reevaluate the merits of this ir-
responsible decision and should rightly con-
clude that it is the correct decision to keep

POM–127. A resolution adopted by the Sen-
ate of the State of West Virginia urging the 
current presidential administration to open 
federal lease sales onshore and offshore, sup-
porting critical energy infrastructure to 
safely deliver energy produced in West Vir-
ginia, and ensuring American energy compa-
nies can access the capital they need to hire 
American workers; to the Committee on En-
ergy and Natural Resources. 
SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 55 
Whereas, All West Virginia residents de-
serve access to affordable and reliable en-
ergy, whether electricity, natural gas, or 
transportation fuels; and 
Whereas, West Virginians are currently 
dealing with the highest inflation in over 40 
years, with energy costs rising 29 percent, 
and gasoline surging 50 percent, according to 
the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics; and 
Whereas, The current administration is 
pursuing a policy placing the United States 
at the mercy of the Organization of Petro-
leum Exporting Countries and Russia to 
meet our domestic needs, harming our na-
tional and economic security; and 
Whereas, Foreign oil imports from Russia 
surged more than 20 percent providing over 
$16 billion to Russia in 2021, according to the 
U.S. Energy Information Agency; and 
Whereas, The current administration has 
frozen federal lease sales for American en-
ergy resources onshore and offshore while 
cancelling 
critical 
energy 
infrastructure 
projects like the KeystoneXL pipeline which 
would have reduced our dependence on Rus-
sian oil imports; and 
Whereas, The current administration is ac-
tively litigating against its obligations to 
issue lease sales on federal lands and waters 
required under federal law; and 
Whereas, The Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission has continually delayed impor-
tant decisions on permits for pipelines across 
the country and has recently issued new 
harmful policy statements that could further 
delay and impede critical domestic energy 
infrastructure from being developed, depriv-
ing West Virginia access to energy markets 
outside of our state; and 
Whereas, The Securities and Exchange 
Commission is designing rules to discourage 
investment in domestic oil and natural gas 
companies which may further impede pro-
duction and opportunities for West Vir-
ginians; and 
Whereas, The Environmental Protection 
Agency has not issued a decision on West 
Virginia’s application for Class VI primacy 
that would allow West Virginia to safely uti-
lize long-term storage in conjunction with 
state energy development; therefore, be it 
Resolved by the Legislature of West Virginia: 
That the Legislature hereby respectfully 
urges the current Presidential Administra-
tion to open federal lease sales onshore and 
offshore, supporting critical energy infra-
structure to safely deliver energy produced 
in West Virginia, and ensuring American en-
ergy companies can access the capital they 
need to hire American workers; and, be it 
further 
Resolved, That the Clerk of the Senate is 
hereby directed to forward a copy of this res-
olution to the President of the United 
States, the Secretary of the Interior, the 
Secretary of the Department of Energy, the 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the 
White House National Climate Advisor, the 
Speaker and Clerk of the United States 
House of Representatives, the President Pro 
Tempore and Secretary of the United States 
Senate, the members of the West Virginia 
Congressional Delegation, and the news 
media of West Virginia. 
POM–128. A memorial adopted by the Sen-
ate of the State of Arizona urging the United 
States Congress to implement legislation to 
strengthen the United States and Arizona 
electrical grids; to the Committee on Energy 
and Natural Resources. 
SENATE MEMORIAL NO. 1003 
Whereas, the United States electrical grid 
is divided into three parts, all of which are 
extremely vulnerable to attack by electro-
magnetic pulse (EMP), hacking, physical as-
sault, severe electrical storms or damage by 
a natural solar event; and 
Whereas, a nuclear EMP attack would have 
devastating consequences to our nation, as 
congressional studies estimate that such an 
attack on the Eastern United States power 
grid would result in a 90% death rate over a 
one-year period. Further, the United States 
military is 99% dependent on civilian elec-
tricity, and such an attack could severely 
hinder our nation’s defense capabilities; and 
Whereas, in addition to the threat of 
enemy attack, the sun has already hit North 
America twice with devastating electrical 
force that caused major upheaval in infra-
structure elements, in 1859 and again in 1989; 
and 
Whereas, the next natural solar event or 
enemy attack on our nation’s power grids 
could potentially disrupt numerous United 
States industries and services, including the 
military, banking, farming, fuel delivery, 
water and sewage services, hospitals, emer-
gency services, communications and manu-
facturing; and 
Whereas, none of the United States grids 
are currently EMP-protected at all, and 
basic protection has been estimated in a 2004 
Congressional Report to cost $2 billion; and 
Whereas, protecting our nation’s vital in-
frastructure, including its electrical grids, is 
a valid function of the United States and 
state governments that benefits all citizens; 
and 
Whereas, China, Russia and Israel have al-
ready strengthened their electrical grids to 
limit damage and to restore power after an 
attack or natural solar flare; and 
Whereas, terrorist countries are known to 
be testing and preparing super-EMP weap-
ons, naming our nation as a target. If an 
enemy launched an attack from sea or space, 
the United States would not soon know who 
attacked us and could not easily retaliate; 
and 
Whereas, over the years, Congress and sev-
eral states have studied these threats, yet to 
date no legislation has been passed requiring 
the strengthening of our electrical grids. It 
is imperative that the current Congress ex-
peditiously enact comprehensive legislation 
that will protect our nation’s vital electrical 
grids from EMP threats, both natural and 
man-made. 
Wherefore your memorialist, the Senate of 
the State of Arizona, prays: 
1. 
That 
the 
United 
States 
Congress 
promptly enact comprehensive legislation to 
strengthen the United States and Arizona 
electrical grids. 
2. That the Secretary of State of the State 
of Arizona transmit copies of this Memorial 
to the President of the United States Senate, 
the Speaker of the United States House of 
Representatives and each Member of Con-
gress from the State of Arizona. 
POM–129. A resolution adopted by the 
House of Representatives of the State of 
Michigan urging the United States Congress 
to support legislation to strengthen the 
Workforce Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC); 
to the Committee on Finance. 
HOUSE RESOLUTION NO. 198 
Whereas, The Workforce Opportunity Tax 
Credit (WOTC) encourages businesses to hire 
employees in certain groups that face sig-
nificant barriers to employment. The credit 
helps to defer the costs of recruiting, train-
ing, and employing these individuals; and 
Whereas, Since its creation, the WOTC has 
not kept up-to-date with rising labor costs. 
The maximum credit amount has not been 
updated since the credit was created in 1996, 
limiting its effectiveness in incentivizing 
businesses to hire individuals from the tar-
geted groups; and 
Whereas, The economic effects of the 
COVID–19 Pandemic have made it more im-
portant than ever to strengthen the WOTC. 
The credit targets jobs to those groups that 
have been disproportionately impacted by 
the pandemic. Increasing the credit amount 
will also help businesses to recover from the 
pandemic by defraying the costs of hiring 
these individuals as labor costs rise; and 
Whereas, Legislation has been introduced 
to strengthen the WOTC. H.R. 3449 of 2021, 
also known as the Hiring Incentive to Re-
turn Employment (HIRE) Act, would tempo-
rarily increase the credit amount for all tar-
geted groups for two years. The bill would 
also eliminate the credit’s prohibition on re-
hiring employees for this two-year period; 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the House of Representatives, 
That we urge Congress to support legislation

ate of the State of New Jersey condemning 
the November 1984 anti-Sikh violence in 
India as genocide; to the Committee on For-
eign Relations. 
SENATE RESOLUTION NO. 142 
Whereas, The Sikh community in the 
United States and New Jersey has recovered 
from the material damages of the genocide 
as they continue to keep the memory of 
those who were killed alive and will never 
forget the Sikh genocide; and 
Whereas, Recognizing the state-sponsored 
violence that targeted Sikhs across India in 
1984 is an important and historic step to-
wards justice, accountability, and reconcili-
ation, which should be an example to other 
governments; Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the Senate of the State of New 
Jersey: 
1. The New Jersey Senate condemns the 
November 1984 anti-Sikh violence in India as 
genocide. 
2. Copies of this resolution, as filed with 
the Secretary of State, shall be transmitted 
by the Secretary of the Senate to the Presi-
dent and Vice-President of the United 
States, the Majority and Minority Leaders of 
the United States Senate, the Speaker and 
Minority Leader of the United States House

POM–131. A resolution adopted by the 
House of Representatives of the State of Col-
orado urging the United States Congress to 
adopt comprehensive voting rights legisla-
tion to protect the integrity of American de-
mocracy and the sacred right to vote; to the 
Committee on Rules and Administration. 
HOUSE RESOLUTION NO. 22–1004 
Whereas, Every January we honor the 
memory of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and 
his heroic efforts to advance voting rights 
and we aspire to follow in his footsteps; and 
Whereas, No one did more to promote the 
right to vote for disenfranchised Americans 
than the civil rights leaders of the 1960s, in-
cluding Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Con-
gressman John Lewis, Fannie Lou Hamer, 
and Ella Baker; and 
Whereas, Until the United States Congress 
passed the federal ‘‘Voting Rights Act of 
1965’’, people of color in the United States 
were frequently subject to poll taxes, lit-
eracy tests, and fraud and intimidation, pre-
venting them from exercising their right to 
cast a ballot; and 
Whereas, The United States Senate is con-
sidering critical federal elections reform and 
long overdue updates to the federal ‘‘Voting 
Rights Act of 1965’’ to preserve voting rights 
for generations to come, in honor of the leg-
acy of the late Congressman John Lewis; and 
Whereas, 
Colorado’s 
electoral 
system 
serves as an example to the rest of the na-
tion, and in fact the world, of how to expand 
voter access while protecting electoral integ-
rity through safeguards including risk-lim-
iting audits and signature verification; and 
Whereas, In the 2020 election, Colorado had 
the second highest voter turnout of any state 
in the nation, and Colorado’s largest voting 
bloc—young people ages 18 to 34—turned out 
in record numbers; and 
Whereas, Efforts to suppress the vote and 
disenfranchise Americans who historically 
have had the least access to the ballot have 
been on the rise across the country in recent 
years; and 
Whereas, Last year, more than 440 bills 
with provisions that restrict voting access 
were introduced in 49 states, including here 
in Colorado, where legislation was intro-
duced to restrict voters’ access to Colorado’s 
vote by mail system, a national model of ex-
cellence for election access, security, and in-
tegrity; and 
Whereas, Last year, 19 states passed 34 
laws restricting access to voting, including 
Georgia’s Senate Bill 202 and Texas’ Senate 
Bill No. 1, both of which made it more dif-
ficult for voters to exercise their funda-
mental right to vote enshrined in the United 
States Constitution and the federal ‘‘Voting 
Rights Act of 1965’’; and 
Whereas, Falsehoods and conspiracies re-
garding the integrity of the 2020 election 
have run rampant in our media and public 
discourse; and 
Whereas, The months-long, coordinated at-
tempt to interfere with the democratic proc-
ess following the November 2020 election and 
prevent the peaceful transfer of power by 
overturning the legitimate results of the 
presidential election, which culminated with 
the insurrection at the United States Capitol 
on January 6, 2021, serves as a violent re-
minder of the fragility of our democracy; 
now, therefore, 
Be It Resolved by the House of Representa-
tives of the Seventy-third General Assembly of 
the State of Colorado: 
That we, the members of the Colorado 
House of Representatives: 
(1) Reassert the validity of the 2020 presi-
dential election results as legitimate and 
verified; 
(2) Offer Colorado’s premier electoral sys-
tem as a model for states across the country 
to adopt in order to increase voter participa-
tion while ensuring electoral integrity; and 
(3) Call on the United States Congress, and 
specifically members of the United States 
Senate, to pass comprehensive voting rights 
legislation to protect the fundamental right 
to vote, which has been the cornerstone of 
our democracy since the founding of our re-
public. 
Be It Further Resolved, That copies of this 
Resolution be sent to the Speaker of the 
United States House of Representatives, the 
Majority Leader of the United States House 
of Representatives, the Minority Leader of 
the United States House of Representatives, 
the President of the United States Senate, 
the Majority Leader of the United States 
Senate, the Minority Leader of the United 
States Senate, and all members of the Colo-
rado Congressional delegation. 
POM–132. A resolution adopted by the 
Board of Supervisors of the City and County 
of San Francisco, California, urging the 
United States Senate to ratify the Conven-
tion on the Elimination of All Forms of Dis-
crimination Against Women (CEDAW); to 
the Committee on Foreign Relations.

DATA MAPPING TO SAVE MOMS’ 
LIVES ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. G. K. BUTTERFIELD 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 4, 2022 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Madam Speaker, as 
many of you know, the United States is one of 
the only developed nations in the world where 
the maternal mortality rate continues to rise 
every year. The rate of mortality is especially 
higher in minority populations and rural com-
munities—those who most often sit on the 
wrong side of the digital divide. This women’s 
health crisis has had a particularly disparate 
impact on the African American community. 
African American women are three times more 
likely to die during pregnancy and childbirth 
than their counterparts. Physicians and sci-
entists continue to study the cause of these 
high numbers, citing lack of access to re-
sources as one of many reasons the maternal 
mortality rate continues to rise. These re-
sources include, but are not limited, to 
broadband access. 
My bill, the Data Mapping to Save Moms’ 
Lives Act, focuses on overlaying broadband 
connectivity data held by the FCC with health 
information held by the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention. Armed with this infor-
mation, policymakers will be able to target 
connectivity resources where telehealth may 
be able to assist medical professionals re-
motely monitor the health of pregnant women. 
We must act to address this crisis and my bill 
will give us the needed information to target 
our interventions. 
I urge my colleagues to help protect our Na-
tion’s mothers and vote yes on H.R. 1218, the 
Data Mapping to Save Moms’ Lives Act.

GIRLS OF STEEL 
HON. MICHAEL F. DOYLE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 5, 2022 
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to commend the 
Girls of Steel robotics team for qualifying for 
the eleventh time to attend the FIRST World 
Championship competition by winning the Re-
gional Engineering Inspiration award at the 
Greater Pittsburgh Regional, held at California 
University of Pennsylvania in California, Penn-
sylvania, between March 17th and 19th, 2022. 
I also want to commend the Girls of Steel 
for winning the Regional Chairman’s Award at 
the Buckeye Regional held at Cleveland State 
University in Cleveland, Ohio, between March 
24 and 26, 2022. The Regional Chairman’s 
Award is the most prestigious award at FIRST. 
It honors the team that best represents a 
model for other teams to emulate and best 
embodies the purpose and goals of FIRST. 
The students are proud that their awards 
qualify them to attend the 2022 FIRST World 
Championship in Houston, Texas. I think that 
the remarkable accomplishment of continu-
ously making it to the Championship speaks 
volumes about the dedication these young 
women have in pursuing ‘‘STEM’’—Science, 
Technology, Engineering, and Math—careers, 
their ability to sustain their team, and the thou-
sands of hours they have spent collectively 
doing outreach in the community. The Girls of 
Steel are often referred to as the hometown 
favorite robotics group and continue to be fea-
tured in videos, print media, and blog posts. 
FIRST, which stands for ‘‘For Inspiration 
and Recognition of Science and Technology,’’ 
is an organization dedicated to engaging our 
students in STEM fields. Hundreds of thou-
sands of students gain practical, team-based 
engineering experiences through FIRST every 
year. 
As a founder and co-chair of the Congres-
sional Robotics Caucus, I believe competitions 
like these are incredible tools for helping our 
young people to explore potential careers in 
STEM. I’ve witnessed firsthand the incredible 
economic growth and development that these 
fields can bring to my home district, and I 
strongly believe that these fields are crucial to 
our nation’s future prosperity. For encouraging 
young people in these pursuits, I want to com-
mend organizations like FIRST for their impor-
tant work. The FIRST Robotics Competition al-
lows students to apply creativity and critical 
thinking in the demanding and competitive 
field of robotics, all while instilling a strong 
sense of pride in participants. 
Fifty-three young women from 8th through 
12th grade associated with schools located in 
and around the Pittsburgh area represent this 
year’s Girls of Steel program, and in recogni-
tion of their hard work, intelligence, and team-
work, I would like to mention each of these in-
spiring young people by name. They are Ciara 
Anderson, Ariella Avigad, Somdatta Basu, 
Justine Bennett, Aashi Bhatt, Megan Cassady,

Additionally, I want to convey my sincere 
appreciation to the faculty and staff of Car-
negie Mellon University’s Field Robotics Cen-
ter, who have mentored the Girls of Steel 
since 2010. Because of their efforts, more 
young women experience real-world techno-
logical challenges and learn from some of the 
nation’s best at solving these problems. These 
experiences will certainly benefit these young 
women in the future. 
The Girls of Steel will compete in the FIRST 
Championship in Houston, Texas, at the end 
of April—one of the largest competitions of its 
kind. It’s essentially the Super Bowl of Smarts. 
They will compete against top teams from all 
over the world. 
I congratulate the Girls of Steel and wish 
them all continued success in their academic 
and professional endeavors.

DR. ROBERT MCCRORY 
HON. JAMES COMER 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 5, 2022 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor Dr. Robert McCrory for his admirable 
commitment to revitalizing the legendary Tater 
Day Festival in Benton, Kentucky. 
Today this annual tradition in Marshall 
County will commence, bringing the commu-
nity together for a weekend of fun, entertain-
ment, and competition. 
Originally started in 1843 when farmers 
came to town to trade sweet potatoes, this 
event was unfortunately lagging by the 1960s. 
Dr. McCrory didn’t like that—and nor did he 
accept it. 
A longtime community leader and a charter 
member of the local Kiwanis Club, he took a 
lead role in returning this event to its prior leg-
endary status. 
As head of a committee formed to do just 
that—Dr. McCrory revitalized Tater Day in a 
major way. Now, this historic event features 
sizable crowds that descend on Benton every 
year for a parade, contests, and tasty potato 
treats. 
Without Dr. McCrory’s leadership, this proud 
local tradition would not be what it is today. 
Because of that, I express my sincere thanks 
to him as Marshall County and West Ken-
tucky’s representative in Washington.

Tuesday, April 5, 2022 
Mr. MORELLE. Madam Speaker, I would 
like to pay tribute to Ana J. Kordovich 
Galovski, who passed away earlier this year 
following a battle with Alzheimer’s disease. 
Ana was born in Bukov, Macedonia and im-
migrated to the United States in 1951, where 
she was able to meet her father for the first 
time at the age of 12. She attended West High 
School here in Rochester and graduated as a

Ana was deeply involved in the local com-
munity—especially in the local Macedonian 
community. She was a founding member of 
St. Dimitria Macedonian Orthodox Church in 
Henrietta, NY and remained active in the 
church community throughout her life. She 
was often seen attending services and board 
meetings, singing in the choir, or calling bingo 
numbers. Ana went above and beyond to help 
those in the Macedonian community acclimate 
to living in the United States. 
Ana loved to travel with friends and family, 
especially with her grandkids later in life. She 
was loved by all who knew her, and she will 
be deeply missed. My heart goes out to her 
entire family during this difficult time.

HONORING THE SERVICE OF MR. 
WARREN WRIGHT BROOME 
HON. BRUCE WESTERMAN 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 5, 2022 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the life and service of Mr. 
Warren Wright Broome, a committed, retired 
member of the United States Navy and a be-
loved husband, father, and brother. Warren 
Wright Broome, 100 years old, passed away 
on March 21, 2022, in Camden, Arkansas. He 
was born on January 12, 1922, in Kathwood, 
South Carolina, to James Manford and Ruby 
Brinson Broome. 
Warren enlisted in the Navy in June 1942 
and served until his retirement in August 1972. 
During his thirty years of honorable service to 
our Nation, he fought in three Wars: World 
War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. 
After his retirement from the Navy, he worked 
for RCA Service Company in Washington, 
D.C. Mr. Broome loved history, was a wonder-
ful storyteller, and an avid book collector who 
enjoyed spending time in his library. He was 
also particularly dedicated to his faith and was 
an active member of the United Methodist 
Men and of Fairview United Methodist Church 
in Camden. Mr. Broome led a rich life filled 
with laughter and will be missed by all who 
knew him. 
I take this time today to celebrate the life

HONORING MR. KEN DUBERSTEIN 
FOR HIS LIFETIME OF ACHIEVE-
MENTS 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 5, 2022 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Mr. Ken Duberstein for his life-
time of achievements in both the private sec-
tor and public service. 
Ken Duberstein was born in Brooklyn, New 
York and grew up loving everything the city 
had to offer. Duberstein’s first political experi-
ence as a young boy was handing out leaflets 
for Republican presidential candidate Dwight 
D. Eisenhower during the 1952 election. After 
graduating from high school, Mr. Duberstein 
attended Franklin & Marshall College in Lan-
caster, Pennsylvania. He went on to obtain a 
master’s degree in political science at Amer-
ican University. Mr. Duberstein got his first 
taste of Capitol Hill with an internship in the 
office of Republican Senator Jacob Javits from 
New York. He then went on to work for the 
General Services Administration in the 1970s 
and later for the U.S. Department of Labor. 
In 1981, Ken joined President Reagan’s 
White House as the President’s liaison to the 
House of Representatives. During this time, he 
helped Congress push through an extensive 
tax cut by successfully convincing conserv-
ative Democrats to break with their party. In 
1987, Ken accompanied President Reagan to 
the Berlin Wall in 1987 and played a pivotal 
role in the subsequent summit between 
Reagan and Gorbachev. Duberstein became 
White House Chief of Staff in 1988. After his 
years of public service, Ken opened the tre-
mendously successful boutique firm, The 
Duberstein Group, Inc. 
Ken Duberstein remained steadfast in his 
patriotism, commitment to country, and served 
as a mentor to Presidents of the United 
States, White House Chiefs of Staff, Members 
of Congress, and countless senior elected and 
appointed officials. He was deeply respected 
by both sides of the aisle. On behalf of New 
York’s 21st Congressional District, I am hon-
ored to recognize his remarkable leadership 
and life.

HONORING MAYOR SANDY LUCY 
HON. BLAINE LUETKEMEYER

Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor a woman who has dedi-
cated her life to public service and the people 
of Washington, Missouri. After being in public 
service for over thirty years and as the Mayor 
of Washington, Missouri for almost twelve 
years, Mayor Sandy Lucy is retiring. 
Over the past thirty years Mayor Lucy has 
served her community in multiple roles. She 
was president of Downtown Washington Inc. 
and a member of the Washington Area Cham-
ber of Commerce. Most recently she was the 
first woman to serve as Mayor of Washington, 
Missouri. As Mayor she served with profes-
sionalism, honor, and integrity. Through her 
leadership the city has achieved many suc-
cesses and earned Washington the Great 
American Main Street Award. Mayor Lucy 
leaves a legacy that will be cherished by the 
community for years to come. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in con-
gratulating Mayor Sandy Lucy on an excep-
tional career and a well-deserved retirement.

HONORING DOLORES H. 
HICKAMBOTTOM 
HON. JUDY CHU 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 5, 2022 
Ms. CHU. Madam Speaker, Dolores H. 
Hickambottom is a true legend in Altadena, 
Pasadena and the Greater San Gabriel Valley. 
Widely admired and greatly respected in the 
community, she was at the forefront of many 
monumental issues for over five decades. 
Dolores led the effort to desegregate the 
schools who were part of the Pasadena Uni-
fied School District (PUSD). After PUSD had 
failed to integrate its schools, they were sued 
by community members resulting in the 1970 
landmark case of Spangler vs. the Pasadena 
City Board of Education. Dolores did every-
thing she could to help the plaintiffs and orga-
nized hundreds of residents in the Pasadena 
area to support them, while at the same time 
educating people about the racial segregation 
affecting the school district. Due to the monu-
mental efforts of Dolores and members of the 
community, the case went up to the U.S. Dis-
trict Court, which ultimately determined that ra-
cial segregation existed at all levels of PUSD. 
As a result, Pasadena was integrated and be-
came the first school district west of the Mis-
sissippi to have crosstown bussing. 
Dolores also went to great lengths to raise 
the visibility of African Americans in govern-
ment. During her early years in Pasadena, Do-
lores noticed that few African Americans in the 
community attended city council meetings. 
They saw the lack of representation in their 
local government and rightly believed their 
voices would not be heard. Dolores made it 
her mission to correct this problem and deliver 
the representation the African American com-
munity deserved. Through hard work and de-
termination, Dolores helped to elect Pasa-
dena’s first African-American and second fe-
male mayor, Loretta Thompson-Glickman, in 
1977, and later served as her field representa-
tive. Dolores went on to serve in other impor-
tant political roles, including as a staff member 
for California State Senators Walter Stiern, 
Richard Polanco, and Jack Scott. 
Dolores had so many interests and pas-
sions, serving on the boards of numerous 
community organizations from the League of 
Women Voters to the Pasadena Chapter of 
the National Women’s Political Caucus to 
Pasadena City College. However, most im-
pressive of all was her service in the Korean 
War. Dolores was one of the few women serv-
ing in the United States Army, and one of the 
few people of color. Even though the odds 
were against her, she excelled in her position 
and was recognized as an outstanding basic 
trainee. Dolores never forgot her service in the 
military and joined organizations like American 
Legion Post 13 so that she could provide sup-
port to struggling Veterans. Throughout her 
years, she made it a priority to help Veterans 
in the community and was a crucial part in es-
tablishing a Veteran’s Community Based Out-
patient Clinic in the San Gabriel Valley. Dolo-
res’ commitment to her fellow veterans will live 
on and continue to serve those who were 
brave enough to stand beside her. 
For 
her 
entire 
lifetime, 
Dolores 
Hickambottom broke barriers, built bridges, 
and strove to make the world a greater place. 
She was a hero to the community and her in-
credible legacy will forever serve as an inspi-
ration to us all.

HONORING MR. DAVID MARZETTI 
HON. JIMMY PANETTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 5, 2022 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Mr. David Marzetti as the central 
coast of California celebrates the 20th anniver-
sary of the Shagbag Radio Show. Mr. Marzetti 
is a pillar of the Monterey Peninsula and its 
airwaves. The Shagbag Radio Show has fea-
tured over 4,000 guests over 1,000 shows, ce-
menting Mr. Marzetti’s legacy as the Voice of 
Monterey. 
Mr. Marzetti, originally from Canton, Ohio, 
has called the Monterey Peninsula home since 
1989. Inspired by the beauty of the Central 
Coast, Mr. Marzetti left behind a behind a bur-
geoning East Coast radio career to become 
Program Director and Morning DJ at KOCN 
105.1 FM, where he would work for the next 
12 years. 
In 
2002, 
Mr. 
Marzetti 
developed 
the 
Shagbag Show, where over two decades, he 
would air over 1,000 shows and feature over 
4,000 guests from all walks of life. Despite air-
ing from the Del Monte Golf Course, Mr. 
Marzetti’s guests extend far beyond golfers 
and golf enthusiasts, but include celebrities, 
athletes; local business owners, restaurateurs, 
writers, doctors, politicians, and more. 
Mr. David Marzetti’s dedication to the Cen-
tral Coast and the Monterey Peninsula goes 
beyond his radio presence. In an effort to pro-
mote local businesses, he joined the Monterey 
County Convention and Visitors Bureau as its 
Membership Manager. He continues to be in-
volved in the Peninsula’s golf community, cov-
ering the U.S. Open and U.S. Amateur Cham-
pionship golf tournaments at Pebble Beach 
and the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am. Over 30 
years, Mr. Marzetti has interviewed hundreds 
of professional and celebrity players, bringing 
his enthusiasm for the sport and the commu-
nity to the airwaves. 
Mr. Marzetti’s dedication and enthusiasm 
has not gone unrecognized. He is a three-time 
winner of the PGA of Northern California 
Media Person of the Year and he was the first 
person bestowed with the Carmel Chamber of 
Commerce ‘‘Community Champion’’ Award. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the 
House of Representatives to join me in recog-
nizing Mr. Marzetti’s long career in service to 
the Central Coast. I extend my personal ap-
preciation to Mr. David Marzetti and his dedi-
cation to radio and entertainment.

RECOGNIZING LILLIAN J. 
GARDNER 
HON. BRIAN K. FITZPATRICK 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 5, 2022 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to acknowledge an outstanding con-
stituent from my district, Lillian J. Gardner, 
who has served the Defense Logistics Agency 
(DLA) for nearly four decades. After achieving 
both a bachelor’s degree in Business Logistics 
and a master’s degree in Business Administra-
tion from the Pennsylvania State University, 
Lillian joined the Defense Personnel Support 
Center (now the DLA) in 1983 as an Inventory 
Management Specialist. Since then, she has 
held a number of different positions within the 
agency, working tirelessly to support our Na-
tion’s warfighters and becoming an expert in 
the acquisition field. 
Now, after 38 years of dedicated public 
service and professional leadership in the De-
partment of Defense, Lillian is entering retire-
ment. She concludes her impressive career as 
the Director and Chief of the Contracting Serv-
ices Office. Widely respected for her accurate, 
strategic, and creative acquisition support to 
DLA’s leaders, Lillian has also demonstrated 
an extraordinary ability to overcome complex 
and innumerable challenges, including those 
that have arisen because of the COVID–19 
pandemic. Her dedication and diligence have 
contributed to keeping our military mission- 
ready. 
We are incredibly grateful for the positive 
impact Lillian has had on our community and 
country throughout her time in government 
service, and we wish Lillian countless bless-
ings during her retirement.

INTRODUCTION OF THE REDUCING 
HELICOPTER NOISE IN THE DIS-
TRICT OF COLUMBIA ACT 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 5, 2022 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the Reducing Helicopter Noise in the 
District of Columbia Act, which would require 
all helicopters and rotocraft in the District of 
Columbia to fly at the maximum altitude per-
mitted by the Federal Aviation Administration 
(FAA) in D.C., with limited exceptions. The ex-
ceptions would include active law enforcement 
and rescue operations, transporting the presi-
dent and vice president and safety. 
I hear from D.C. residents almost daily 
about helicopter noise. Helicopter noise can 
harm health, quality of life and the structural 
integrity of homes. In 2019, I led members of 
the National Capital Region (NCR) in request-
ing that the Government Accountability Office 
(GAO) study helicopter noise in the NCR. Last 
year, GAO issued its report. GAO found that 
there had been nearly 90,000 helicopter flights 
in the NCR from 2017 to 2019. GAO rec-
ommended that the FAA develop a mecha-
nism to exchange helicopter noise information 
with operators in the NCR. The FAA indicated 
that it would implement such a mechanism, 
and I also introduced the Washington, DC 
Area Helicopter Noise Information Exchange 
Act of 2021 to require the FAA to implement 
such a mechanism. 
I urge my colleagues to support the Reduc-
ing Helicopter Noise in the District of Columbia 
Act.

IN RECOGNITION OF WILHELMINA 
HENRY’S LIFETIME OF SERVICE 
AND IN CELEBRATION OF HER 
100TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. JERRY McNERNEY 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 5, 2022 
Mr. MCNERNEY. Madam Speaker, I ask my 
colleagues to join me in recognizing Wilhel-
mina Henry for a lifetime of service and to 
honor her on the 100th anniversary of her 
birth. 
Born in Columbia, South Carolina on Janu-
ary 20, 1920, Mrs. Henry earned a degree 
from the Tuskegee Institute and began her 
teaching career after World War II in seg-
regated schools in South Carolina, Georgia, 
and Alabama. In 1947, she moved to Stock-
ton, California and was appointed to a teach-
ing position in the Stockton Unified School 
District—becoming Stockton’s first teacher of 
color. 
Mrs. Henry has made invaluable contribu-
tions to our local education system. She 
taught within the Stockton Unified School Dis-
trict until her retirement in 1994, ending her 
52-year teaching career. In recognition of her 
role as a pioneer in education and a civil 
rights activist who broke the color barrier for 
teachers, the Wilhelmina Henry Elementary 
School in Stockton, California was named in 
her honor in 2006. 
In addition to her invaluable contributions in 
education, Mrs. Henry and her husband, Re-
vered Edwin Henry, Sr., formed the Church of 
All Nations and the Henry Affordable Housing 
Program in Stockton. She remains an active 
member in the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, 
the Black Employees Association of Stockton 
Unified School District, the Ebenezer AME 
Church, the NAACP, and the Stockton Teach-
ers Association. 
Mrs. Henry is a trailblazer and role model, 
paving the way for many others who have fol-
lowed in her footsteps. In celebration of her 
100th birthday and lifetime of service, I ask my 
colleagues to join me in recognizing Wilhel-
mina Henry.

PUTIN’S MASS MURDER 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 5, 2022 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, the civilized world is shocked at the 
discovery of mass murder by Putin in Bucha, 
Ukraine. It is inspiring the leadership of Presi-
dent Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the immediate 
responses by Germany to Italy for expelling 
Putin’s murder-complicit diplomats. 
With innocent civilians discovered having 
their hands tied behind their backs, shot in the 
head, it is clear, war criminal Putin must be 
stopped with immediate military aid. Biden is 
correct to recognize this as part of the world-
wide conflict of democracy with rule of law 
versus autocracy with rule of gun. 
An undisputed atrocity is the Putin detention 
of Mayor Olga Sukhenko of Motyzhyn (Ma-ta- 
jhin), her husband, Igor and her son, Alex-
ander. Later, they were discovered murdered 
mercilessly in a shallow grave. 
I have faith in the Russian people with a 
great culture betrayed by the war criminal, 
Putin. There is legislation for defecting Rus-
sian troops, diplomats, and Duma members to 
be provided expedited refugee status to Amer-
ica and up to $100,000 for any Russian mili-
tary equipment turned over to Ukraine. 
Ukraine will achieve victory. 
God bless Ukraine. God save Ukraine. Long 
live Volodymyr Zelenskyy. 
Congratulations to Mayor Dan Rickenmann 
and the city of Columbia for sending aid to 
Ukraine.

CONGRATULATING

THEIR VALIANT EFFORT IN THE

HOCKEY 
SEMIFINALS 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK

Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate the Queensbury High 
School hockey team on an extraordinary sea-
son culminating in a great effort at the state 
semifinal game. 
Due to the pandemic, the New York State 
high school hockey playoffs were unfortunately 
cancelled the last two seasons. However, prior 
to these cancellations, the Queensbury Spar-
tans had built a reputation of playing at an ex-
tremely high level, appearing in the Final Four 
in back-to-back years. In the 2021–2022 sea-
son, under the leadership of Head Coach 
Dean Williams, the team of dedicated young 
men picked up right where they left off. The 
Spartans defeated John Jay High School in 
the quarterfinal game seven to five. Mack 
Ryan had a record-setting five-goal perform-
ance leading the Spartans to another oppor-
tunity to compete in the Final Four. In the 
semifinal game the Spartans faced New 
York’s number one ranked team, the Pelham 
Pelicans of Westchester County. 
The Queensbury Spartans put up a valiant 
effort against the Pelham Pelicans in the Divi-
sion II semifinal game and came just short of 
appearing in their first state championship. De-
spite ultimately falling seven to one, the Spar-
tans fought hard until the final buzzer. Pelham 
scored two goals in the game’s first minute, 
and the Spartans faced an uphill battle the 
rest of the evening. Despite the outcome, 
Queensbury saw standout performances from 
Nick Ogden, who scored the team’s only goal, 
and goalie Blake Powers, who had an impres-
sive 34 saves in the game. With only four sen-
iors on the roster, most of these young men 
will return ready to play hard next season. I 
am confident that Queensbury High School 
will field a highly competitive hockey program 
for years to come. 
On behalf of New York’s 21st Congressional 
District, I would like to congratulate the 
Queensbury Spartans on their incredible 
2021–2022 season. We are very proud of their 
hard work and dedication throughout this year.
