PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal God, teach us how to live our 
lives with wisdom, refusing to deviate 
from the path of integrity. 
Lord, give our lawmakers the wisdom 
to trust in You and do good, enabling 
them to help our Nation become safe 
and secure. As our Senators commit 
their plans and work to You, bless 
their efforts with radiant success. Help 
them to remember the power of godli-
ness, and may they use it to discern 
the 
difference 
between 
right 
and 
wrong. 
Remind us all that Your sacred Word 
continues to be a lamp of wisdom, pro-
viding light for our feet and illumina-
tion for the road ahead. 
We pray in Your righteous Name. 
Amen.

The 
clerk will please read a communication 
to the Senate from the President pro 
tempore (Mr. LEAHY). 
The legislative clerk read the fol-
lowing letter: 
U.S. SENATE,

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader is recog-
nized. 
f 
LEGISLATIVE AGENDA 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
the Senate returns to session with a 
busy and consequential work period 
ahead of it. We will consider landmark 
legislation to establish paycheck fair-
ness, legislation to boost American in-
novation in the 21st century, and in the 
final week of June, legislation to pro-
tect voting rights and American de-
mocracy. The Senate will consider all 
three of these issues this month. 
We will start by finishing the U.S. In-
novation and Competition Act, now 
known as the USICA Act. The bipar-
tisan legislation will be the largest in-
vestment in scientific research and 
technological innovation in genera-
tions, setting the United States on a 
path to lead the world in the industries 
of the future. It includes the input of 
virtually everyone in this Chamber—a 
product of over six committees and 
dozens of amendments from our Repub-
lican colleagues. 
Tomorrow, the Senate will consider a 
couple of final amendments before 
passing this historic legislation. It will 
be one of the most important things we 
will have done in a very long time. It 
will be the largest investment in sci-
entific research and technological in-
novation in generations—decades. 
f 
JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, on 
judges, in addition, today and tomor-
row, the Senate will confirm the first 
of President Biden’s nominees to the 
Federal bench: Julien Xavier Neals of 
New Jersey and Regina Rodriguez of 
Colorado. I also look forward to con-
firming other highly qualified jurists 
later 
this 
work 
period, 
including 
Ketanji Brown Jackson to serve on the 
DC Circuit Court of Appeals. These are 
the first of many jurists that the 
Democratic Senate will consider to re-
store the balance to the Federal judici-
ary. 
Under President Trump and Leader 
MCCONNELL, the Senate became a con-
veyor belt for nearly 200 judges. Many 
were woefully inexperienced and far 
outside the judicial mainstream. Some 
were so extreme on issues of race and 
voting rights that even some of our Re-
publican colleagues joined the Demo-
crats in rejecting those nominations.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3944 
June 7, 2021 
On the flip side, President Obama ap-
pointed 320 judges, and President Biden 
now has the opportunity to fill more 
than 80 vacancies. Under this Demo-
cratic majority, the Senate will swiftly 
and consistently confirm President 
Biden’s appointments to the Federal 
bench, bringing balance, experience, 
and diversity back to the judiciary. Mr. 
Neals and Ms. Rodriguez are two great 
examples, along with Ms. Brown Jack-
son. 
In the same vein, today, I also an-
nounced two judicial recommendations 
to President Biden: Myrna Perez, the 
director of voting rights at the Bren-
nan Center for Justice, to serve on the 
prestigious Second Circuit Court of Ap-
peals, and Dale Ho, the leader of the 
voting rights project at the ACLU, to 
serve on the Southern District of New 
York. Ms. Perez and Mr. Ho are two of 
the foremost voting rights and election 
experts in the country. With a national 
focus on voting rights right now, their 
elevation is timely, and their perspec-
tives will be invaluable. Ms. Perez 
would also be the first Latina to serve 
on the Second Circuit Court since now- 
Justice Sonia Sotomayor. 
Diversity on the Federal bench is 
very important to me, both demo-
graphic diversity and diversity of expe-
rience. The courts have long been 
packed with former prosecutors and 
corporate lawyers. It is about time 
that civil rights attorneys, voting 
rights attorneys, and Federal defenders 
start getting the nod. My recommenda-
tions of Ms. Perez and Mr. Ho are part 
of that effort. 
Last month, I also recommended Eu-
nice Lee, an appellate attorney with 
the Federal Defenders of New York, to 
serve as a judge on the Second Circuit. 
Lee could become just the second 
Black woman to sit on this prestigious 
appeals court, a court that has never— 
never—had a former Federal defender 
on its roster. 
Just like Ms. Perez and Mr. Ho, Eu-
nice Lee will bring demographic and 
professional diversity to the Federal 
bench. The three of them, in tandem, 
will bring dynamism, brilliance, and a 
real diversity of experience to courts in 
New York. 
As a Senator from New York and as 
majority leader, I am intent on restor-
ing balance to a judiciary that has 
been thrown out of whack by 4 years of 
President Trump’s selections. 
f 
PAYCHECK FAIRNESS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, fi-
nally, on paycheck fairness, tomorrow, 
the Senate will decide whether to take 
up legislation to address the gender 
pay gap. 
Right now in America, women earn, 
roughly, 82 cents for every dollar a 
man makes. The gap is even wider for 
women of color. Even when you ac-
count 
for 
educational 
attainment, 
Black and Latina women earn only 65 
to 70 percent of what a White man 
makes with the same degree, whether 
it is a bachelor’s degree or an advanced 
degree. Many women with advanced de-
grees actually make less than their 
male counterparts who don’t have 
them. So, looking at the facts, women 
with the same jobs, the same degrees— 
sometimes better degrees than their 
male 
colleagues—are 
making 
less 
money. That is the very definition of 
gender discrimination, and it is holding 
back women in every industry and area 
of the country. 
The pandemic has only made matters 
worse. Faced with impossible choices 
between careers and childcare, women 
have fallen out of the workforce at an 
alarming rate. By one measure, the 
COVID–19 pandemic has set women’s 
labor force participation back by more 
than 30 years, leading some economists 
to describe the 2020 year not as a reces-
sion but as a ‘‘she-cession.’’ 
So there is a lot of work to do to not 
only recover from a devastating year 
for women in the workplace but also 
establish an equal playing field where 
women are paid what they deserve. 
Senate Democrats have put forward a 
bill that would make it much easier for 
women to petition for pay equity. It 
doesn’t mandate that employers set 
wages at a certain level. It doesn’t 
have the government reach into the 
private sector. It merely makes it easi-
er for women to overcome pay dis-
crimination. 
In my view, this straightforward, 
unobjectionable piece of legislation 
should merit bipartisan support and 
should not require changes. All 50 
Democratic Senators are cosponsors of 
the bill—all 50. Will our Republican 
colleagues step up to the plate and join 
us tomorrow to advance this common-
sense legislation? 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered.

f 
ECONOMIC RECOVERY 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
on Friday, the U.S. job market got an-
other monthly checkup. Hiring in May 
was up from the previous month but 
still fell short of the level experts and 
American employers had hoped for. 
Of course, the highest expectations 
for our economic recovery under Demo-
cratic control were set by none other 
than the Democrats themselves. 
Back in February, the Biden adminis-
tration pointed to projections that its 
so-called American Rescue Plan would 
boost job creation in 2021 by 4 million 
over existing expectations. Meeting 
that new higher goal meant the econ-
omy would have to grow by over 900,000 
new jobs a month. Needless to say, the 
job market is nowhere close—nowhere 
close—to meeting this target. In fact, 
hiring is falling short of where non-
partisan experts forecasted it would be 
even 
if—even 
if—Democrats 
hadn’t 
rammed through a multitrillion-dollar 
liberal wish list this spring. 
I have been clear on the dangers of 
that bill from the beginning, and the 
data is now spelling it out very clearly. 
Democrats’ bloated additions to unem-
ployment insurance haven’t just failed 
to help our recovery, they have actu-
ally hurt it, and the consequences on 
Main Street are now in full focus. 
As hiring lags, employers are strug-
gling to entice workers to rejoin and 
keep their facilities staffed. After a 
year that already tested budgets to the 
breaking point, small business owners 
are having to dig even deeper to at-
tract staff, offering bigger bonuses and 
flexible hours. But even that hasn’t 
been enough. For the fourth straight 
month, one survey of small businesses 
came back with record-high reports of 
unfilled job openings. As one small 
business owner in London, KY, re-
ported to me, ‘‘The current labor short-
age is by far the worst’’ he has ever 
seen. In fact, his short staff has had 
such a hard time keeping up with or-
ders that ‘‘customers are already con-
sidering moving business from this fa-
cility to other states.’’ 
Unfortunately, this situation isn’t 
unique. As I traveled the State last 
week, I heard the same story from em-
ployers of all sizes. Kentucky’s labor 
force is still 90,000 workers below 
prepandemic levels. Nationwide, work-
force participation has remained stag-
nant for nearly a year. All the while, 
prices for consumers are continuing to 
creep up. 
This is exactly what Republicans and 
nonpartisan 
experts 
had 
warned 
against months ago. We urged Demo-
crats not to force our country’s prom-
ising early recovery into a permanent 
defensive crouch. Now, as States and 
business owners grapple with the con-
sequences, I hope Democrats in Wash-
ington are paying attention and learn-
ing from this costly mistake. 
f 
SENATE AGENDA 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Now, 
Madam 
President, on another matter, after a 
week of work with our constituents, 
the Senate reconvenes with a chance to 
refocus on the most important issues 
facing our folks back home. 
Already on multiple occasions this 
year, we have demonstrated that even 
a narrowly divided Chamber is capable 
of taking productive, bipartisan steps 
on serious issues. Wide majorities have 
come together to extend access to the 
critical PPP loans, invest in drinking 
water infrastructure, and equip the jus-
tice system to better combat hate

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3945 
June 7, 2021 
crimes against Asian Americans. This 
week, the Senate is set to do the same 
on legislation regarding competition 
with China, and many of our colleagues 
are working hard to make further con-
sensus possible on issues that have his-
torically enjoyed bipartisan support, 
like transportation infrastructure. 
Remember, this sort of collaboration 
on serious priorities is what the Amer-
ican people insisted upon just last No-
vember. They elected a 50–50 Senate, 
shrunk Democrats’ majority in the 
House, and took President Biden up on 
a promise to unite the country. So the 
question at the outset of this work pe-
riod is how Democrats will use their 
razor-thin majority over the next few 
weeks. Unfortunately, the Democratic 
leader already signaled his answer a 
week ago by laying out a June agenda 
that is transparently designed to fail. 
As I understand it, Senate Democrats 
intend to focus this month on the de-
mands of their radical base: exploiting 
the cause of pay fairness to send a 
windfall to trial lawyers; saddling hos-
pitals, schools, and small businesses 
with crippling new legal burdens if 
they fail to keep pace with ‘‘woke’’ so-
cial norms; and opening an unprece-
dented new front in the left’s war on 
the Second Amendment. 
As written, these are not proposals 
aimed at earning bipartisan support. 
They are not designed to clear the Sen-
ate’s necessarily high bar for ending 
debate. Bizarrely, it appears they are 
being floated in order to illustrate that 
the bar is too high. 
After a spring in which the Senate 
has repeatedly passed mainstream leg-
islation by wide margins, Democrats 
have decided that now—now is the time 
to argue that the legislative process is 
somehow broken. 
Let’s not forget the Democrats’ post-
er child for why the Senate should 
change its rules is a bill that would 
forcibly change the rules for elections 
in every State in America. 
Let me say that again. Democrats’ 
poster child for why the Senate should 
change its rules is a bill that would 
forcibly change the rules for elections 
in every State in America. 
Their marquee bill, S. 1, is such a 
brazen political power grab that the 
question isn’t whether it could earn bi-
partisan support; the question is how 
wide the bipartisan opposition will be. 
This is the bill the Democratic leader 
has placed at the vanguard of his cam-
paign to destroy the filibuster, even 
though multiple Members of his own 
majority are now on the record object-
ing to it. 
So make no mistake: Failing to sell 
reckless, wholesale changes to our de-
mocracy isn’t proof that the guardrails 
should be removed; it is a reminder 
that they are there for a reason. 
The American people rightly expect a 
50–50 Senate to spend its time finding 
common ground, but our Democratic 
colleagues seem to believe that the 
most important expectations are those 
of their far-left fringe. They put for-
ward an agenda that is designed to fail, 
and fail it will.

ELECTION PROTESTS 
Mr. 
DURBIN. 
Madam 
President, 
imagine this: In one of the great na-
tions of the world, there is a con-
troversy over transition of power, the 
peaceful transfer of power. And in this 
country, those who are about to lose 
power 
are 
concerned—so 
concerned 
that their backers are turning to the 
streets. They plan on demonstrations 
against the supposed new leadership in 
their country, and people fear violence. 
It was against this background that 
Nadav Argaman, the director of Shin 
Bet, Israel’s internal security service, 
made a rare public intervention on Sat-
urday night, warning of discourse that 
is ‘‘liable to be interpreted by certain 
groups or by individuals as one that 
permits violent and illegal activity 
that is liable, heaven forbid, to reach 
mortal injury.’’ Without mentioning 
any politicians directly, Mr. Argaman 
added, ‘‘It is our duty to come out with 
a clear and decisive call to stop imme-
diately the inciting and violent dis-
course. The responsibility for calming 
spirits and reining in the discourse 
rests on all of our shoulders.’’ 
I bring this matter to the floor of the 
Senate because it parallels what we en-
dured and experienced just a few 
months ago. I am sure you remember it 
well, Madam President. I do. The elec-
tion last November, which was won by 
Joseph Biden over Donald Trump, the 
incumbent President, by some 7 mil-
lion votes—one of the largest turnouts, 
if not the largest turnout, in the his-
tory of the United States. It was a de-
cisive electoral college victory in the 
same margin that Trump had tri-
umphed over Hillary Clinton just a few 
years before. Yet, because of the Big 
Lie and the denial by Donald Trump, 
he inspired his followers to come to 
Washington, DC, and participate in a 
rally to protest, and not to come just 
any day but to come on January 6, 2021, 
of this year because that is when the 
electoral college votes would be count-
ed. 
We know what followed. We know 
that mob was turned loose in the 
streets of Washington and turned loose 
on the Capitol Building, and those who 
were here that day will never forget it. 
I can recall the Vice President of the 
United States being pulled from that 
chair you are sitting in, Madam Presi-
dent. He was taken out that door. It 
was about 2:15 in the afternoon. Then a 
member of the Capitol Police stood be-
fore us and warned us: Stay in your 
seats. This will be a safe place to be. 
We are going to gather all the staff 
around the walls here. Just sit tight. 
Ten minutes later, he came back and 
said: Change of plans. The mob is ad-
vancing on this Chamber as we speak. 
Leave immediately. 
Everyone picked up as fast as they 
could and left. 
It was a scene that seemed so unreal-
istic, you wouldn’t imagine it could 
happen in the Capitol of the United 
States of America. But the insurrec-
tionist mob inspired by President Don-
ald Trump was here for business. They 
were here to stop the ordinary course 
of business in the Senate and the 
House, which would announce at the 
end of the day the selection of Joseph 
Biden as our new President. 
Now a parallel is taking place in 
Israel, and a new coalition to replace 
Benjamin Netanyahu is being con-
tested by those who are going to march 
in the streets. The Israeli leaders—at 
least those in the security services— 
are begging people not to do it. 
I put that in context to think that 
that idea in the United States some-
how has taken root in Israel. I pray 
that nothing happens. I want nothing 
to happen there. But we should be fore-
warned to take this seriously. There 
are forces at work in the United States 
and Israel and other countries to stop 
the orderly transfer of power in a 
democratic nation. We ought to take 
that seriously. We ought to take it so 
seriously that we appoint a bipartisan 
Commission to investigate what hap-
pened here on January 6, 2021. 
Just a few weeks ago, Republican 
Members of the House of Representa-
tives were dismissing the January 6th 
events, the mob action here in the Cap-
itol, and saying that they were some-
how ‘‘orderly tourists.’’ That is what 
one of the Congressmen said, a Con-
gressman from Georgia, a Republican. 
Those were ‘‘orderly tourists.’’ Look at 
those videos and imagine under any 
circumstance that you would describe 
them 
as 
‘‘orderly 
tourists.’’ 
They 
weren’t orderly tourists when you see 
five people losing their lives as a result 
of their actions and 140 of our law en-
forcement officials being personally at-
tacked, many of them still bearing the 
scars of that day.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3946 
June 7, 2021 
I bring this to the attention of the 
Senate and the American people be-
cause I think the answer is obvious. 
Israel is taking it seriously. They don’t 
want a Trump-like mob to take control 
in their country. 
We shouldn’t be allowing this to hap-
pen, nor should we stop with what we 
have done and say no more will be said. 
This was a direct attack on our democ-
racy. We cannot find, unfortunately, in 
the Republican leadership one Repub-
lican leader who will support this idea 
of a bipartisan Commission. When it 
comes to January 6, the job isn’t fin-
ished. 
The last point I will make is, we re-
ceived a letter—an anonymous letter— 
from the Capitol Hill Police asking us 
to form this Commission and to get to 
the bottom of it. To think that we 
walk through this Capitol every day 
and those men and women are risking 
their lives for us and we would not 
even allow a bipartisan Commission to 
look into that day and the threats to 
the lives of those policemen on that 
day is shameful. It is disgraceful. It is 
unacceptable. 
Senator SCHUMER said we will vote 
on it again. I hope we do, and fre-
quently, so we can remind the Amer-
ican people who is taking this matter 
very seriously and who is not. 
FARM WORKERS 
Madam President, on another issue, 
on another topic, when the pandemic 
was first declared in March of last 
year, we entered a world of uncer-
tainty. We were confronted with the re-
ality that our schools and our work-
places were going to be shut down in 
the foreseeable future, family gath-
erings and get-togethers were going to 
be restrained, and our favorite places 
for relaxing and fun—restaurants and 
stores—were basically closed. But amid 
all these uncertainties, one thing re-
mained constant and dependable: our 
domestic food supply. Despite the dis-
ruptions, panic buying, and supply 
chain bottlenecks that arose during 
the pandemic, our domestic food supply 
remained fundamentally intact every 
step of the way. 
Over the past year, most of us had 
the assurance that when we stopped at 
a grocery store, there was plenty of 
food for our family, and when grocery 
store shelves started to run empty, we 
could always trust that more food was 
on the way because farmers were doing 
their job and distributors of food sup-
ply were doing the same. It goes to 
show that, thanks to American agri-
culture, we are blessed by abundance. 
As we come together to commend the 
courageous doctors, nurses, and other 
frontline workers who have cared for 
our loved ones, there is another group 
of essential workers who have toiled 
alongside our farmers and ranchers to 
keep our families fed: farm workers. 
I am sure most Americans know very 
little about the farm workers who sup-
ply the food we eat every day. In Illi-
nois, we have 20,000 of these farm work-
ers. They plant, harvest, and pick our 
State’s most lucrative crops. 
Across the country, we have 2.5 mil-
lion farm workers. Roughly half of 
these 2.5 million are undocumented. 
These undocumented farm workers are 
part of our communities, and many are 
parents of American children. But de-
spite the essential work they do to 
keep our families fed, their second- 
class status in America means that 
they are often subject to harassment, 
untenable working conditions, sub-
standard housing, and they live under 
constant threat of deportation. 
Last month, The Guardian news serv-
ice published a piece on the working 
and living conditions for farm workers 
in southern Texas. I want to share a 
few passages about one worker in par-
ticular. Her name is Linda. Nina 
Lakhani writes that Linda ‘‘works six 
days a week, sometimes seven, putting 
food on Americans’ tables but earns 
barely enough to cover the bills and de-
pends on food stamps to feed her [own] 
family,’’ her children. 
After long days in the fields, [Linda] sleeps 
on an old couch in the kitchen-lounge as 
part of the house was left uninhabitable by a 
fire and a hurricane. 
But she calls it home. 
Her 11-year-old son [who has some learning 
disorders] sleeps on the other couch . . . two 
daughters share a bedroom where water 
leaks through a mouldy roof. The eldest, a 
16-year-old . . . and her 6-month-old baby 
sleep in a room with cindered walls. 
Last summer, [Linda] and her three teen-
age 
daughters 
contracted 
Covid-19. 
. . . 
Rather than risk going to an emergency 
room, a relative with legal immigration sta-
tus crossed the border to Reynosa and pur-
chased a small tank of oxygen [for Linda]. 
Linda has lived in the United States 
of America for more than 25 years. She 
is one of the many undocumented farm 
workers who keep my family and our 
families fed. Yet she herself can barely 
feed her own family. Her experience is 
not an isolated one. 
I want to share one last passage from 
the article in The Guardian: ‘‘Even be-
fore the pandemic, farms were among 
the most dangerous workplaces in the 
country, where low-paid workers have 
little protection . . . long hours, repet-
itive strain injuries, exposures to pes-
ticides, dangerous machinery, extreme 
heat and animal waste.’’ 
Now add this contagious virus that 
these workers face too. 
According 
to 
the 
Environmental 
Working Group, more than a dozen 
States don’t provide any form of PPE 
or COVID testing for farm workers, and 
there are no social distancing guide-
lines in place on these farms. In some 
cases, workers arrive to the fields in 
tightly packed trucks, and the crews 
reportedly share cups of water from the 
same cup during the day. 
I think it would be accurate to clas-
sify these working conditions as dan-
gerous, but these essential workers 
don’t have the luxury of being able to 
advocate for themselves—because they 
are always under the shadow and risk 
of deportation. 
We in the Senate can change that. 
We can pass a piece of bipartisan legis-
lation that has already passed the 
House. It is called the Farm Workforce 
Modernization Act. This legislation 
would fundamentally change the lives 
of hundreds of thousands of these farm 
workers who came to our rescue during 
the darkest days of the pandemic, who 
kept working despite the threat of 
COVID–19 and the fact that they had 
few creature comforts of their own. 
This is legislation that has been in 
the making for years. It would provide 
a path to lawful, permanent residency 
for undocumented farm workers and 
their family members. That means 
they would be able to do the essential 
work they have already been doing 
without living in fear of being deported 
and losing their kids. It also means 
these workers could advocate for high-
er wages, safer working conditions, 
which would make our Nation’s farm 
labor 
workforce 
more 
stable 
and 
strengthen the durability of our food 
supply chain. 
Offering these farm workers a path to 
permanent residency is the least that 
we could do to acknowledge their tire-
less, back-breaking work during this 
pandemic. Over the past year, we have 
heard a lot of praise for the essential 
workers of America. I join them, of 
course. At our time of need, they did 
their job, sometimes at great personal 
cost. Now it is time to do our job and 
pass the Farm Workforce Moderniza-
tion Act. 
Enacting this legislation is not just 
about doing the right thing for work-
ers; it is about doing the right thing 
for our economy and doing the right 
thing, period. 
When the pandemic hit last year, it 
caused the worst economic crisis since 
the Great Depression. Twenty-two mil-
lion jobs vanished in America. Millions 
of working families lost their source of 
income, and some, for the first time in 
their lives, struggled to put food on the 
table. Can you imagine how much 
worse this crisis would have been if our 
Nation was saddled with a food scar-
city crisis as well? Thanks to our farm-
ers and these farm workers I am speak-
ing for today, we never faced it. It is 
one of the many examples of how im-
migrants make our country stronger. 
We take them for granted. They go to 
work every day and do the dirtiest, 
most dangerous jobs in America. Now 
we have to do something for them. 
According 
to 
last 
year’s 
census, 
America’s population grew at the slow-
est rate since the 1930s. That is a warn-
ing sign for the future of our economy. 
If our population growth continues to 
slow, our Nation’s tax base will shrink. 
It means we will have fewer working- 
age adults who can help support elderly 
Americans—a population that is ex-
pected to double over the next few dec-
ades. To grow our economy, we need to 
bring people out of the shadows so they 
can continue to contribute to America 
for years to come. So when we vote on 
legislation like the Farm Workforce 
Modernization Act, we are really vot-
ing for our economic future.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3947 
June 7, 2021 
I would like to remind my colleagues 
that America didn’t build the world’s 
greatest economy by closing our doors, 
crossing our fingers, and doing one an-
other’s laundry. We did it by wel-
coming the workers of the world, by of-
fering them a home where they can 
earn an honest living, pay their fair 
share, and secure a brighter future for 
their children. 
Many people say: Well, we want to 
get those Ph.D.s from India, China, and 
Asia. We want them living here. They 
are going to be good for our economy, 
and they are going to create busi-
nesses. 
That is all true. I stand behind that 
as well. But there are also many work-
ers who don’t have that level of edu-
cation but have a determination and a 
work ethic that have always been part 
of success in the American economy. 
This unique American promise, build 
a brighter future for their children as 
well as ours, is the bedrock of our Na-
tion. No other country in the world can 
deprive us of it. We can only deprive 
ourselves by refusing to fix a broken 
immigration system that leaves mil-
lions of hard-working families in the 
shadows of our society. If we want to 
continue leading in the 21st century, if 
we want America to be in first place 
and not second place, we need to keep 
the American promise alive, and we 
need to do it by passing the Farm 
Workforce Modernization Act, joining 
together in support of comprehensive 
immigration reform. 
Madam President, the issue of immi-
gration, as you probably know, is a 
point of passion of mine. I know it is 
one of yours. You mentioned to me the 
other day in passing that you are the 
only true immigrant in the Senate, and 
it is, I guess, historic that I would give 
this speech and you would be presiding 
over the Senate as I do. I am sure you 
feel as I do. These people go to work 
every single day. They do the dirtiest, 
hardest, most dangerous work in Amer-
ica, and they do it without any hope of 
a great future because they are un-
documented. They have no future. The 
person they are working for this week 
may decide on Friday night not to pay 
them anything. Are they going to go to 
court to fight for their rights as work-
ers? Probably not. They don’t feel they 
have any rights because they are un-
documented. 
But a good thing happened here years 
ago when a coalition of Senators, 
Democrats and Republicans, put to-
gether a farm worker provision. Now 
the House has done it for us again. 
They have led the way with the Farm 
Workforce 
Modernization 
Act 
and 
passed it and sent it here. It is time for 
us to take up this measure. 
I have talked to a number of our Re-
publican friends, and many of them are 
from agricultural States. They under-
stand it, and they support it. They 
want to be a part of it. You would be 
surprised if I told you their names on 
the floor, but I am careful not to. They 
are worried because this issue of immi-
gration is controversial. But they un-
derstand the fairness of it all. 
I want to salute MICHAEL BENNET, the 
Senator from Colorado, who has been a 
leader on this subject from the start. 
Years ago, we had a coalition effort, 
the Gang of 8 effort. He was the person 
who put together the farm worker pro-
vision. I think DIANNE FEINSTEIN was a 
great contributor in that effort as well. 
MICHAEL BENNET is back again work-
ing for this bill. We ought to take this 
up. We ought to do it this week. We 
ought to pass it out of the Senate, the 
bill that passed the House, and, in so 
doing, we would be doing a favor for es-
sential workers—some of the lowest 
paid, hardest working people in Amer-
ica. It is only right, and I hope we do it 
soon. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Madam Presi-
dent, I ask unanimous consent that the 
order for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
BALDWIN). Without objection, it is so 
ordered. 
ECONOMIC RECOVERY 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Madam Presi-
dent, I spoke recently about a serious 
crisis facing our economy, the work-
force shortage. This has been brought 
on by many things that my colleagues 
from the left have spent and asked 
questions and brought about policies. 
Today, I want to discuss another 
looming challenge to our economy, one 
where Democratic policies are adding 
fuel to the fire, if not starting the fire 
itself. I am talking about inflation. 
Inflation is not an abstract idea 
thrown around by finance gurus. Infla-
tion is a real threat to the pocketbooks 
of hard-working Americans throughout 
our great country. We haven’t hit the 
inflation levels of Jimmy Carter’s days 
yet, but the warning signs are here. 
I recently spoke with a group of 
homebuilders from across my home 
State of Alabama. They told me how 
they are seeing prices increase that are 
even higher than the ballooning na-
tional average. As an example, in Ala-
bama and across much of the South, 
homebuilding materials, such as brick, 
are up 10 percent. Insulation prices are 
up 15 percent. Sheetrock prices are up 
nearly 50 percent. Lumber prices are up 
300 percent. And particle board prices, 
which are used in most homes across 
the country, the price is up almost 600 
percent. 
Although demand for houses went up 
during the height of the pandemic, the 
Commerce Department reported that 
U.S. homebuilding actually declined in 
April of this year. With the demand for 
housing so high right now, you would 
think new construction would be tak-
ing place everywhere you turn, but 
that is not the case. Builders are actu-
ally delaying construction projects be-
cause material prices have hit record 
highs. Prices are rising so rapidly that 
a project costing $300,000 at the begin-
ning ends up costing more than $350,000 
at the time of completion. This eats 
into builders’ margins and discourages 
them 
from 
starting 
new 
projects, 
therefore, putting people out of work. 
Folks back home can rest assured 
that I will be monitoring this closely. I 
will be listening to my constituents 
and other companies about their costs 
and supply chain experiences. But I 
shouldn’t be the only one taking all 
these concerns into account. These 
price jumps should be concerning to all 
of us in this building because the na-
tional numbers don’t paint a rosy pic-
ture. 
In April, consumer prices jumped by 
4.2 percent, the highest rise in over a 
decade. Energy prices went up 25 per-
cent overall, with gas prices increasing 
nearly 50 percent. According to the 
Philadelphia Federal Reserve, price in-
creases by one metric were the highest 
since 1980. 
This level of inflation doesn’t just af-
fect a select few; it affects all Amer-
ican families. For many folks, a 4-per-
cent hike on grocery bills takes a seri-
ous toll. Rising prices like these are 
the definition of a kitchen table issue. 
Paying 50 percent more for gas or hav-
ing a costlier electric bill forces fami-
lies to make a hard choice on what 
they can and cannot afford for that 
month. 
We must get our fiscal house in order 
before inflation gets totally out of con-
trol and reverses the economic progress 
we made under President Trump’s lead-
ership. 
You know there are different ways to 
combat inflation—a lot of different 
ways—but we know what makes infla-
tion worse: massive government spend-
ing, and that is exactly what we are 
getting as we speak. 
President Biden and congressional 
Democrats spent $1.9 trillion on a stim-
ulus bill that flooded the economy with 
cash just 2 months ago. Think about 
that—1.9 trillion. Now we want to 
spend trillions on a package in disguise 
of an infrastructure bill. And they are 
following this up by trillions more to 
fund items on the progressive priority 
list in the future. 
Well, they are being confronted by 
the old truth: There is no such thing as 
a free lunch. Simple economics show 
that when the supply of something 
goes up, the value goes down. Money is 
no different. 
President Biden’s policies are pump-
ing our economy with money we sim-
ply don’t have to spend, and that is the 
definition of inflation: making money 
lose its value. It is the natural result of 
the policies that we passed in this 
Chamber in the last few months. 
That is why Larry Summers, a 
former Treasury Secretary and adviser 
to Presidents Clinton and Obama, 
warned that the Biden stimulus would 
be 
‘‘the 
least 
responsible 
macro-
economic policy we’ve had in the last 
40 years.’’ Remember, he worked for

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3948 
June 7, 2021 
two Democratic Presidents. I couldn’t 
agree more with Mr. Summers. 
Democrats learned the wrong lesson 
from the financial crisis in 2008. They 
thought the recovery was slow because 
the government spent too little. They 
have been determined to spend much 
more this time around. The economic 
recovery from the pandemic was al-
ready well underway when the Demo-
crats passed their massive stimulus in 
March—$1.9 trillion. 
Thanks to the bipartisan emergency 
relief bills passed under President 
Trump, the economy had stabilized by 
yearend. We were in the middle of the 
most 
rapid 
economic 
recovery 
on 
record, but the Democrats’ out-of-con-
trol spending is putting the recovery at 
risk, and it is the American families 
who will pay the price in the end. 
In addition to a reckless monetary 
policy, they want to raise taxes on all 
of us, including small businesses and 
family farms, to fund this spending 
spree. They want to undo the Tax and 
Jobs Cuts Act passed by the Senate Re-
publicans and signed into law by Presi-
dent Trump. 
These Republican tax cuts helped 
create the best economy in a genera-
tion. They created countless opportuni-
ties for hard-working Americans. Un-
employment was at historic lows. Blue- 
collar wages rose faster than white-col-
lar wages for the first time in history. 
If they repeal the Republican tax 
cuts, Democrats will be encouraging 
American companies to move overseas. 
Job creators will have to pay more 
taxes at the same time as they are re-
covering from the pandemic, and the 
tax increases being proposed will be 
passed on to working Americans in the 
form of higher prices and lower wages. 
In fact, the only people Democrats 
want to lower taxes for are the people 
who are high earners in New York, 
California, and New Jersey. Higher 
taxes, combined with the Democrats’ 
inflation, would be a one-two knockout 
punch of our Nation’s economic recov-
ery. 
It only takes one match to start a 
brush fire. Rather than taking com-
monsense 
steps 
to 
fight 
inflation, 
Democrats are preparing for it by 
dumping lighter fluid on the entire 
field. President Biden styles himself as 
the second coming of FDR, but he is 
looking more like Jimmy Carter every 
day. 
Americans my age will remember 
Carter’s Presidency and how tough 
those times were for working families. 
I hope we can avoid repeating history, 
but that means we need to take action, 
and we need to take action now. I urge 
my Democratic colleagues to reexam-
ine their misplaced priorities and keep 
pro-worker tax and spending policies in 
place. 
Let’s work together on practical 
ways to get our economy and our coun-
try back to work. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
BORDER SECURITY 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, dur-
ing the first 4 months of 2021, more 
than half a million migrants have 
crossed our southern border—a half a 
million—including more than 50,000 un-
accompanied children. Now, nobody 
really believes that those children got 
there all by themselves. The truth is, 
they have been smuggled to the border 
and crossed the border only to be 
picked up by Border Patrol, taken care 
of, as we would all hope they would be, 
and ultimately be placed with U.S. 
sponsors. I will have more to say about 
that in a moment. 
In the same period of time last year, 
there were fewer than 125 migrants who 
crossed our border, including just over 
10,000 children—half a million so far 
this year, 125,000 last year, 50,000 chil-
dren so far this year, 10,000 last year 
during the same period of time. Put 
simply, this is not normal, nor should 
it be the standard operating procedure 
for the U.S. Government. The truth is, 
our country lacks the facilities, the 
personnel, the resources, and the poli-
cies to handle this sort of influx of hu-
manity in a humane way. 
Back in March, the President tapped 
Vice President HARRIS to handle the 
border crisis, but we have seen no 
progress to date. In fact, the Vice 
President, I believe, is in Guatemala 
today, and she hasn’t even been to our 
southern border. She hasn’t visited the 
facilities where tens of thousands of 
migrant children have been cared for. 
And she hasn’t listened to the mi-
grants’ horrifying stories of how they 
were treated by the human smugglers 
that brought them to the border. 
We do know the Vice President is fi-
nally hitting the trail this week to 
talk about the border crisis. But that 
seems to be all it is, is talk. The only 
problem is, she is not visiting the bor-
der. She is not even in her home State 
of California, which has a border with 
Mexico. She is in Guatemala. 
As 
law 
enforcement, 
nongovern-
mental organizations, and border com-
munities are being overwhelmed by the 
surge of migration, the Vice President 
is meeting with foreign leaders. Now, 
there is nothing inherently wrong 
about meeting with foreign leaders, 
but, surely, she can’t think that a con-
versation with the President of Guate-
mala is going to solve the human crisis 
at our border. 
The Border Patrol will tell you, as 
they have told me, mass migration like 
this is a product of two different ac-
tions. One is the so-called push factors, 
which means people who lack economic 
opportunity; maybe they are fleeing vi-
olence; maybe they just want to come 
to America to be reunited with some 
other 
relatives; 
and 
certainly 
the 
human smugglers are more than happy 
at $5,000, and more, a head to help 
them. But these smugglers, as I inti-
mated a moment ago, are a part of 
transnational criminal organizations 
that care nothing for these migrants. 
They just care about the money. And 
what they do is they flood the border 
with unaccompanied children, for ex-
ample, taking as many as 40 percent of 
the Border Patrol off the frontlines in 
the war against illegal drugs coming 
across the border. And when the Border 
Patrol is not there—surprise, sur-
prise—the very drugs that contributed 
to the loss of about 80,000 lives last 
year in America alone come flowing 
across, whether it is heroin or cocaine 
or artificial opioids. You name it, it is 
coming across the border by the same 
people who are moving the migrants 
across the border. Again, they are com-
modity agnostic. They will do anything 
for a buck, and they care nothing 
about the migrants at all. 
Well, imagine calling 9–1–1 when your 
home is on fire and watching as they 
hose down your neighbor’s house in-
stead. That is what it feels like watch-
ing the Vice President down in Central 
America. 
For years, the United States has 
tried to address the crime and corrup-
tion in Central America with very lim-
ited success. Do they have some mod-
est role in the crisis? Well, yes, but 
that is hardly where the Vice Presi-
dent’s attention should be focused 
right now. Particularly, she should be 
focused—and the President focused—on 
working with us on policies that Con-
gress would pass that would mitigate 
this humanitarian crisis. 
Former Senator HARRIS’s list of leg-
islative accomplishments and her expe-
rience solving complex policy problems 
is not particularly deep. But rather 
than be critical, I would like to offer a 
suggestion. 
In April, Senator SINEMA—the Sen-
ator from Arizona—and I introduced 
the Bipartisan Border Solutions Act to 
address this unfettered flow of migra-
tion. She is concerned about Arizona; I 
am concerned about Texas. But the 
truth is, I am concerned about America 
writ large. 
We have been proud to work in a bi-
cameral way, too, with two of our 
friends on the other side of the Capitol: 
Congressman HENRY CUELLAR, a Demo-
crat 
from 
Laredo, 
TX; 
and 
TONY 
GONZALES, from the 23rd congressional 
district. The four of us live in and rep-
resent border States and districts. We 
have spent time—a lot of time—listen-
ing and learning from the men and 
women who are committed to safe-
guarding our border and those who care 
for the migrants and those who live in 
these border communities. 
There are a lot of people out there 
who will talk about what is happening 
at the border who have never actually 
been there, so how in the world would 
they possibly know? They inaccurately 
characterize border communities as 
unsafe, lawless places. That is not true.

S3949 
June 7, 2021 
They villainize the Border Patrol and 
other law enforcement Agencies like 
ICE, Immigration and Customs En-
forcement. Remember the ‘‘Abolish 
ICE’’ slogan? They are criticizing these 
public servants for actually enforcing 
the laws that Congress has passed. Con-
gress passed those laws. These brave 
men and women are simply executing 
the laws that Congress itself has 
passed. 
Well, unfortunately, there is a lot of 
talk here in Washington by people who 
offer blanket solutions that have noth-
ing to do, or very little, with solving 
the complex problems that exist. The 
fact of the matter is, my State of 29 
million people has a beautiful, safe, 
and vibrant border region. I was there 
last Wednesday, last. The men and 
women who lead and protect these 
communities are doing everything they 
can to fairly and humanely respond to 
the crisis. But they are being over-
whelmed, and they are not getting 
much help from the Federal Govern-
ment. 
The same is true across our entire 
southern border. At her invitation, I 
visited Tucson last Tuesday, a very dif-
ferent border region than we visited on 
Wednesday, 
where 
Senator 
SINEMA 
came to McAllen, at my request, in the 
Rio Grande Valley. 
I appreciate her and her staff taking 
the time to learn more about the dif-
ferences in the border in my State from 
her State. And I certainly learned a lot 
by traveling to Tucson and meeting 
with her constituents. 
In Arizona, we visited a soft-sided 
Customs and Border Protection facility 
where migrants are processed, and the 
Tucson sector chief talked about the 
broad responsibilities his agents have 
in these facilities. 
As I suggested a moment ago, nor-
mally, the Border Patrol is responsible 
for patrolling the border. That is why 
they call them the Border Patrol. But 
now they are encountering unaccom-
panied children and have to leave those 
frontlines—about 40 percent of them— 
just to take care of them at these CBP, 
Customs and Border Protection, facili-
ties. 
Well, we need the Border Patrol on 
the border, patrolling the border so 
they can deal with everything from en-
countering 
a 
child 
abandoned 
by 
human smugglers to a tractor full of 
human 
trafficking 
victims. 
They 
might, and will and do, interdict drugs, 
weapons, money, or any of a number of 
contraband being smuggled across the 
border. Again, as some wise person 
coined the phrase ‘‘commodity agnos-
tic,’’ these transnational criminal or-
ganizations that really bring people 
into the United States from worldwide 
locations but principally from Mexico 
and Central America—all they care 
about is the money. 
In the Tucson sector alone, 103 
agents were pulled from the field be-
cause somebody needed to take care of 
the migrants. Now they are doing ev-
erything from changing diapers to 
serving meals, to supervising playtime 
for the children—103 law enforcement 
officers in the Tucson sector alone who 
should be stopping dangerous people 
and dangerous substances from enter-
ing our country instead of acting as 
caretakers and not creating serious 
gaps in our border security. 
Of course, the cartels—these criminal 
organizations—are pretty smart. This 
is actually part of their business 
model. They know that if they flood 
the border with unaccompanied chil-
dren, for example, the Border Patrol is 
going to leave huge gaps that are then 
going to be exploited by the drug smug-
glers. 
They know about the vulnerabilities 
that exist on our border. They know 
about our laws and policies, and they 
are actively exploiting them. And we 
are basically letting them. Shame on 
us. 
In the Rio Grande Valley last week, 
we spoke with a number of law enforce-
ment and community leaders, includ-
ing the National Border Patrol Council 
president, Brandon Judd. Brandon told 
us that, this year, individuals from 151 
different countries were processed at 
the Donna Processing Facility. This is 
one processing facility in Donna, TX, 
in the Rio Grande Valley. Last year, 
they processed people from 151 dif-
ferent countries. 
A couple of weeks ago, Customs and 
Border Protection at the Laredo Port 
of Entry made a seizure of hard nar-
cotics worth more than $3.5 million of 
street value. This wasn’t from an en-
tire week’s worth of drug interdictions; 
this came from two vehicles that they 
stopped. One had 20 pounds of cocaine 
in it; the other had more than 167 
pounds of methamphetamine. 
This strain on law enforcement poses 
serious risks to our entire country. The 
criminals, the drugs, the weapons, and 
other illegal goods that cross our bor-
der are heading to every corner of the 
United States. And if you think they 
are stopping at the border, think again. 
They are traveling to all 50 of the 
United States. 
And while unaccompanied children 
have become the face of this crisis, 
there is a ripple effect that extends far 
and wide. Border Patrol, ultimately, 
doesn’t have the capacity to provide 
safe and thorough care for these chil-
dren and patrol our borders and inter-
dict dangerous substances and enforce 
our laws. Agents are spread a mile wide 
and an inch deep, and something has 
got to change. 
This is where the Bipartisan Border 
Solutions Act comes in. We provide for 
two major changes in the way that mi-
grants are processed to alleviate the 
strain on law enforcement and improve 
the way we process and care for mi-
grants when they are in our custody. 
One, the bill establishes at least four 
regional processing centers in high- 
traffic areas. It is, in effect, a ‘‘one 
stop shop’’ for the various government 
Agencies involved in processing mi-
grants. CBP, Customs and Border Pro-
tection; ICE, Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement; 
FEMA, 
the 
Federal 
Emergency Management Agency; the 
USCIS, U.S. Customs and Immigration 
Service; and the Office of Refugee Re-
settlement will all be housed under a 
single roof. 
Migrants 
can 
receive 
medical 
screenings, 
have 
their 
identities 
verified, and go through a criminal his-
tory check all in one place. And then 
they will begin the legal process of 
seeking asylum if, in fact, that is what 
they are doing. They will complete 
their asylum interviews, go through 
legal orientation so they know their 
rights, and receive the documents and 
information they need to appear for 
their future court date in front of an 
immigration judge. 
Our bill also addresses the staffing 
shortages that have made this situa-
tion much more challenging. It re-
quires the hiring of hundreds of CBP 
officers and Border Patrol processing 
coordinators so agents can get back on 
the frontlines. In other words, these 
processing coordinators aren’t going to 
be Border Patrol agents who are highly 
trained law enforcement officers. We 
want them back on the frontlines. But 
if it comes to processing the migrants 
and preparing the paperwork, we be-
lieve these processing coordinators can 
help. 
Our legislation also calls for 150 new 
immigration judge teams, 300 asylum 
officers, ICE litigation teams, and 
other personnel to help adjudicate 
these asylum claims. 
Right now, the system is completely 
overwhelmed, and that is exactly what 
the human smugglers—what we call 
the coyotes—are planning on. Every-
body in Texas along the border, every-
body in Arizona, and everybody who 
lives or works along the border under-
stands what is happening. Again, that 
is why it would be so instructive for 
Vice President HARRIS to actually go 
to the border. 
In order to gain a handle on the mass 
movement of migrants, we need to 
make 
these 
commonsense 
changes. 
When it comes to children, it is not 
enough to ensure they are safely proc-
essed by Border Patrol and then trans-
ferred to Health and Human Services’ 
custody. We also need to make sure 
these children are safe after they have 
been placed with sponsors in the 
United States and told to appear for a 
future court hearing. In most cases, 
children are released to parents or 
other relatives, but not always. 
HHS reports that in 2021, more than 
1,000 children have been released to un-
related individuals or distant relatives 
they don’t even know. While these may 
be legitimate caretakers, it can also 
open the door for these children to be 
exploited or trafficked. 
In 2014, the Office of Refugee Reset-
tlement placed eight children with 
members of a human trafficking ring 
who posed as family or friends. These 
children were forced to work on an egg 
farm in Ohio for no pay for 12 hours a

day, 6 or 7 days a week. They lived in 
deplorable conditions, and they were 
threatened with violence if they didn’t 
comply. These distant relatives, unbe-
knownst to these children, and these 
unrelated individuals are a big cause 
for concern, but not the only one. 
Before a child is released into the 
custody of anyone—a parent, grand-
parent, aunt, or uncle—this person 
must be thoroughly vetted by the Fed-
eral Government because we simply 
can’t hand a child over to somebody 
who is going to be a danger to them. 
There 
is 
no 
vetting 
requirement, 
though, for other people who live in the 
same home. And those of us who have 
dealt with the scourge of child abuse 
know that about anybody living in the 
same home with a minor child—par-
ticularly, an unaccompanied child who 
has undergone the trauma of moving 
from Central America to the United 
States is going to be a potential vic-
tim. 
You can have a trustworthy indi-
vidual identified as taking care of the 
child, but abuse could be happening 
under the roof by another person who 
lives there. Why do we say that? Be-
cause, sadly, it happens all the time. 
Or, heaven forbid, the parent or the rel-
ative is the one who decides to exploit 
the child themselves. 
What is being done to prevent this 
abuse? As it turns out, not a lot by the 
Federal Government. The Health and 
Human Services Department requires 
safety and well-being check-in calls to 
be made to sponsors within 30 days 
after a child has been released. But in 
2021 alone, the data shows that 18 per-
cent, nearly one in five children, could 
not be reached after 30 days. Phone 
calls were not answered. Door knocks 
were not responded to. And that means 
that hundreds of children released to 
the care of these adults in the United 
States on our watch are lost to the sys-
tem. We don’t know if they are in a 
safe home or if they are a victim of 
trafficking or abuse, or whether they 
simply disappeared, whether they have 
been recruited into a gang. The U.S. 
Government simply does not know 
where they are and what is happening 
to them. This is a national scandal. 
Senator SINEMA and I are committed 
to passing this legislation that pro-
vides these critical protections for 
these children who already have en-
dured a lot of pain and suffering—a lot 
more than any child should. 
Our bill would require criminal back-
ground checks, not only for the child’s 
sponsor but for any other adult living 
in the household. It will bar children 
from being placed in the custody of 
anyone who has been convicted of sex 
offenses, domestic violence, human 
trafficking, child abuse, or other seri-
ous crimes. The U.S. Government sim-
ply can’t check a box once they have 
placed a child with a sponsor in the 
United States. After the initial 30-day 
checkup, we require another 60-day 
checkup—as a matter of fact, every 60 
days. 
Protections for children, streamlined 
processes, more personnel—these are 
commonsense reforms that will address 
the most urgent issues currently on 
our southern border. 
Bipartisanship, as we know, is in 
short supply these days, especially 
when it comes to the debate sur-
rounding immigration and border secu-
rity. We have folks in both parties and 
in both Chambers of Congress lined up 
behind this particular bill. I hope we 
can add more bipartisan cosponsors. 
Our bill has already been endorsed by 
a broad range of law enforcement, im-
migration, and business groups—for ex-
ample, the National Border Patrol 
Council, National Immigration Forum, 
and U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Com-
merce. I could go on and on. 
As I have said before, and I will say 
again in closing, if anybody has a bet-
ter idea, I am all ears. But, right now, 
all we hear is crickets. No one is offer-
ing any bipartisan, bicameral solu-
tions—anything close to what we have 
described here. This isn’t meant to be 
comprehensive immigration reform. It 
is a targeted solution to the most ur-
gent problems at hand. 
I would be happy to offer this legisla-
tion to Vice President HARRIS or Presi-
dent Biden as a solution to the crisis 
on our southern border. I am happy to 
meet with them. Senator SINEMA, I am 
sure, feels the same, and Congressman 
CUELLAR and Congressman GONZALEZ. 
We are interested in fixing the prob-
lem, not scoring political points, and 
we can’t afford to wait years or maybe 
even decades to see the circumstances 
in Central America change. After all, 
then-Vice President Biden was tapped 
to solve this identical problem by 
President Obama. Let me say that 
again: Vice President Biden was tapped 
to solve this identical problem by 
President Obama. Not only was he un-
successful, but, as we know, it has got-
ten worse since that time. 
We need urgent action to address the 
crisis we are experiencing today at our 
Nation’s border and the Bipartisan 
Border Solutions Act is an important 
first step. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sen-
ior Senator from Iowa. 
INFLATION 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
when I was first elected to Congress in 
the 1970s, I ran as ‘‘Grassley, the infla-
tion fighter.’’ Inflation was about 12 or 
13 percent at that time. When I ran for 
the Senate, it was 12 or 13 percent 
again, and it hasn’t been a major prob-
lem since then. 
Those who remember that time of 
high inflation know that it is a time 
period when inflation was a real prob-
lem. It kneecaps middle-class pros-
perity and causes severe hardships for 
those already struggling. Inflation is 
nothing short of a regressive tax, as it 
hurts Americans more the less money 
that they have. 
It is a stealth tax. With the income 
tax, you can see how much the govern-
ment is taking out of your paycheck. 
With a sales tax, you can see on your 
receipt what the government took for 
its cut. With inflation, the value of the 
dollar in your pocket is reduced with-
out even leaving your billfold. 
When 
Americans 
suddenly 
notice 
that it costs more to buy the same gro-
ceries, it can be hard to know whom to 
blame. Did the store just decide to 
raise prices or is inflation caused by 
mysterious economic forces beyond 
anyone’s control? 
In reality, the Federal Government 
can directly cause inflation by printing 
too much money to feed its spending 
habits. Politicians like to promise 
freebies that someone else will pay 
for—maybe ‘‘the rich’’ will pay. 
Who is ‘‘the rich,’’ you might ask. 
‘‘Don’t worry; it is not you,’’ the big 
spenders assure us. 
Well, don’t be so sure. President 
Biden suggested that if rich people pay 
their fair share of taxes, we can afford 
to spend another $4 to $6 trillion. Now, 
in reality, if the government con-
fiscated all the wealth of all the U.S. 
billionaires, it wouldn’t cover that bill. 
Just asking them to pay a little bit 
more, as the President suggests, will 
barely make a dent. 
So who is going to pay the bill? Don’t 
be fooled. Each American is going to 
pay that bill. Hard-working Americans 
will be shouldering the costs of Biden’s 
spending plans in the form of lower 
wages or higher prices at the gas pump 
or the checkout lines at Hy-Vee in 
Cedar Falls, IA. 
Remember, prior to the pandemic, 
tax reform and a more predictable reg-
ulatory environment contributed to 
the best economy America had seen in 
decades. Yes, prior to the pandemic, as 
a result of the policies of regulatory re-
form and of the tax bill of 2017, we did 
end up with the best economy America 
had seen in 50 years. Unemployment 
reached a 50-year low. Family incomes 
and workers’ wages experienced robust 
gains. In fact, wage growth was strong-
est for low-wage workers. As a result, 
income inequality actually declined. 
My colleagues across the aisle like to 
repeat the falsehood that tax reform 
was just ‘‘tax cuts for the rich’’—not 
true. We eliminated loopholes that al-
lowed some favored corporations to 
avoid millions in taxes. By having 
more corporations paying their fair 
share, we were able to lower the overall 
corporate rate to be more in line with 
other countries, like Sweden or Den-
mark. 
Tax reform meant more investments 
in America, creating good-paying jobs 
for hard-working Americans. 
The prepandemic thriving economy is 
poised now to come roaring back if the 
government just gets out of the way. 
Raising tax rates while adding new 
giveaways for Democrats’ favored cor-
porations that sign onto the Green New 
Deal will kill the goose that laid the 
golden egg. 
While President Biden talks a good 
game about everyone paying their fair 
share, he is proposing an unprece-
dented spending binge. This will only

fuel inflation. The burden will fall hard 
on the middle class and be devastating 
to low-income Americans. 
There are already signs that inflation 
is starting to kick in. Have you ordered 
a hamburger at a restaurant lately? I 
heard from an Iowan in Sioux City that 
at one furniture store, a particular re-
cliner that sold for $199 last year now 
sells for $249. A leather reclining sofa 
that sold for $1,899 last year, today 
costs $2,599. Price increases of 25 per-
cent to 37 percent for furniture are im-
pacting the lifestyle of Iowa families 
and doing it right now. 
Many homebuilding supplies have 
doubled or even tripled in price. This is 
partly due to the shortage of lumber. I 
have called on the administration to 
take action to address this, but the 
price increases are not limited just to 
wood products. 
President Biden’s economic advisers 
assure us that this inflation Iowans are 
seeing with their own eyes is just tem-
porary and really nothing to worry 
about, but it is real and it is hap-
pening. 
Economists from across the political 
spectrum are starting to raise alarms. 
Larry Summers—whom you know as 
the 
former 
president 
of 
Harvard, 
former outstanding economic professor 
at Harvard, President Obama’s chief 
economist, and also Secretary of Treas-
ury under President Clinton—warned 
that the $2 trillion Biden stimulus that 
was rammed through Congress on a 
partisan basis was way too big. 
Larry Summers is quoted as saying: 
I think this is the least responsible macro-
economic policy we’ve had in the last 40 
years. 
More recently, in a Time Magazine 
interview conducted after the release 
of the President’s budget, he expressed 
concerns this way: ‘‘that we are inject-
ing more demand into the economy 
than the potential supply . . . and that 
will generate overheating.’’ 
When a longtime Democratic econo-
mist of the stature of Larry Summers 
sounds the inflation alarm, the Presi-
dent would be well advised to listen to 
that alarm. The President’s spending 
plans would dump fuel on an inflation 
fire that the Fed has ignored in favor 
of easy money policies geared toward 
propping up Wall Street. 
In the end, the poor and the middle 
class will pay. Income inequality will 
rise. For all of their lip service about 
taking from the rich and giving to the 
poor, the Democrats’ big spending poli-
cies may stimulate stock prices for the 
wealthiest Americans, while everyone 
else pays more for less. 
I suggested in a speech about excess 
unemployment benefits that politi-
cians should emulate doctors, and you 
know what doctors are taught: ‘‘First, 
do no harm.’’ That applies to big spend-
ing plans when there are signs of infla-
tion. Once inflation starts to run away, 
it is difficult to stamp out. Remember 
the decade of the seventies. The Fed 
would have no choice but to aggres-
sively hike interest rates, which could 
trigger a recession. 
In coming out of a pandemic that has 
caused so many hardships for American 
families, the last thing they need is 
more economic hardship caused by ei-
ther inflation or a recession. That 
should give Congress pause. 
First, do no harm. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
SMITH). The Senator from Tennessee. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, it appears the White House had 
good reason to wait until the Friday 
before Memorial Day to release their 
budget proposal. They couldn’t afford a 
full week’s news cycle any more than 
the American people can afford to ful-
fill the wish list items President Biden 
is asking them to pay for. It is a very 
long list. 
I think it is safe to say my Demo-
cratic colleagues are trying to make 
the most of the next year and a half. 
They know that time is not on their 
side nor are the American people. 
There really is something for every fac-
tion of the left. Here are a few of the 
items that are contained in this Biden 
boondoggle of a budget. 
The environmental lobby did a great 
job these past few months. They are 
more than taken care of with more 
electric car subsidies and a $936 million 
payout toward environmental justice 
initiatives. 
We also have more funding to expand 
the Department of Education. If you 
think that more government is what 
your child’s educational experience has 
been missing, well, this is the budget 
for you. Yet, if you are fed up with the 
way teachers unions have treated chil-
dren in the classroom, if you are fed up 
with 
schools 
that 
have 
been 
in 
lockdown, you will want to pay close 
attention to what I am talking about 
today. 
Apparently, the good people over at 
the Department of Health and Human 
Services have time on their hands. 
Bear in mind, it is your money that is 
paying them to do the job at which 
they have time on their hands. Now, 
they will be switching gears from pan-
demic response to a new focus on envi-
ronmental extremism, reparations, and 
gutting the Second Amendment. 
What is in this budget? Bigger gov-
ernment, a higher deficit, and runaway 
inflation. 
What is out? According to this budg-
et, national defense is no longer a pri-
ority for the Biden administration or 
for the Department of Defense. Border 
security is also on the back burner 
along with the family-friendly tax poli-
cies we implemented under President 
Trump. 
President Biden and the Democrats 
are doubling down on every mistake 
they have made so far. Instead of doing 
their jobs, they are paying lip service 
to struggling businesses, to struggling 
stores on Main Street in your home-
town, to crumbling bridges—like in 
Memphis, TN—and roadways, and to 
future generations of Americans who 
will come into this world owning their 
own, 
personal 
chunk 
of 
our 
sky-
rocketing national debt. That is right. 
If you have a child or a grandchild born 
this year, their share of the national 
debt is going to be about $80,000. Think 
about that. 
Think about what has happened to 
this debt. From President Washington 
to President George Bush, it was about 
$10.6 trillion. During the Obama-Biden 
years, that debt doubled. Then it was 
added to through the pandemic. Now 
one would be led to believe that this 
administration had decided it was 
going to take the credit cards and 
swipe them so many times they would 
run the numbers off of them. 
Yes, this is the Biden surcharge at 
work—forcing the American people to 
pay a premium just to live. Cradle to 
grave, daylight to dark, they have got 
a list of tax hikes and increased fees 
for you. You hard-working Americans, 
you cannot escape it, and what a world 
they have decided they want to leave 
for future generations. I think it is 
awful. 
I will tell you what—this budget is 
such a terrible representation of what 
America actually needs that, back 
home in Tennessee, as I was home last 
week, people would come up to me and 
ask me if this was really a serious 
budget. It is so extreme. It is so huge. 
They would say: Surely, your Demo-
cratic colleagues are not serious about 
this. Surely, President Biden is not se-
rious about this budget. 
Still, my colleagues across the aisle 
are so eager to get this done that they 
are prepared to, once again, throw reg-
ular order out the window. 
My Democratic colleagues are living 
in an alternate reality. It is the only 
explanation for why they continue to 
insist that this country will be better 
off under a government that strips 
away your freedoms rather than guar-
antees them and one that tries to tell 
you how to live your life every minute 
of every day—from the time your feet 
hit the floor in the morning until the 
time you brush your teeth and get in 
bed at night. 
FOR THE PEOPLE ACT OF 2021 
No, Madam President, when it comes 
to the Biden administration, Big Gov-
ernment is its theme not only of the 
day but of every day. It is the theme 
when it comes to spending, to regula-
tions, and even to intrusions into con-
stitutionally mandated State author-
ity. 
Before the State work period, the 
majority leader indicated that he in-
tended to use this month to shove 
through yet another wish list item. My 
Democratic colleagues have tried sev-
eral times to skip debate and sneak 
through various provisions of their S. 1 
election takeover bill. They tried to do 
this for the same reason President 
Biden released his disastrous budget on 
a Friday after everyone had already 
left town. It is because the bill could 
not survive a fair news cycle once the 
American people knew what was in it. 
To my Democratic colleagues, re-
member the American people know—

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3952 
June 7, 2021 
after we went through ObamaCare and 
the Affordable Care Act—that the cur-
rent Speaker of the House had then 
said: Well, we have to pass this bill so 
we can read it and find out what is in 
it. 
They know that this is the way you 
like to operate. 
I am sure many of my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle would dis-
pute my characterization of the bill. 
So, for the benefit of the record, let’s 
go through a few of the provisions they 
are absolutely convinced will somehow 
expand freedom and secure our elec-
tions. This is what you will find in 
their S. 1 election takeover bill: 
It would require States to allow bal-
lot harvesting and no-excuse mail-in 
balloting, which we know from experi-
ence will open the door to fraud. We 
know this. So are they intentionally 
trying to open the door to fraud? You 
are right; people are correct in asking 
that question. 
It would also overrule State-level 
voter ID laws—another great way to 
guarantee rampant fraud. So, yes, you 
heard me correctly. They want the 
Federal Government to tell your State 
that you cannot require someone to 
prove his identity, to show an ID in 
order to—what?—vote in an election. 
How about that? 
It would weaponize the FEC against 
minority parties, mandate donor dis-
closure, and require the Federal Gov-
ernment to match private contribu-
tions. You heard me right. They want 
your tax dollars to fund people who are 
running for office even if you don’t 
agree with their opinions. Your money 
would be going to them to match the 
contributions that they are raising. By 
the way, it is a 6-to-1 match. Pretty 
convenient, isn’t it? 
I call it insanity, and anyone who has 
ever staffed a polling place or has 
helped to count ballots knows this. Yet 
here we are, staring down yet another 
attempt to put this bill on the fast 
track—taking away the States’ author-
ity to run elections in their States. 
Here is what I say to my Democratic 
colleagues: You are not going to get 
the benefit of a quiet news cycle on 
this. America is watching and listen-
ing, and they are paying attention. 
Your attempts to whip the Senate 
into a state of partisan warfare over a 
bill you don’t have the votes to pass 
will not go unnoticed. 
Your attempts to make another run 
at the filibuster and invent a mandate 
the voters refuse to give you will not 
go unnoticed. 
Your attempt to sneak through this 
unconstitutional, partisan power grab 
is not going to go unnoticed. People 
are paying attention, and my Repub-
lican colleagues and I are going to 
stand up against it. Members of your 
own caucus have said they will not 
stand for it. 
Most importantly, the American peo-
ple are watching, they are listening, 
they are paying attention, and they do 
not stand for what you are seeking to 
do. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
NOMINATION OF JULIEN XAVIER NEALS 
Mr. BOOKER. Madam President, I 
rise today with a lot of joy. I get a 
chance to speak about someone I have 
known for decades. I am rising to speak 
about Julien Neals and my hope that 
he gets to serve on the U.S. District 
Court of the great State of New Jersey. 
I have spoken to many of my col-
leagues on the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee about Julien Neals. He is some-
one I have not just known for a long 
time, but even though he is not quite 
my height, I look up to him. We 
worked together when I was mayor of 
the city of Newark. So today what I 
really want to speak about is not sim-
ply his impressive career, his distin-
guished resume, but I really want to 
talk a bit about who he is. 
I am not sure how many of my col-
leagues know this about the city of 
Newark, NJ, but when I became mayor 
in 2006, we inherited a lot of very com-
plex, very serious challenges, and for 
the sake of our residents, we needed to 
make change quickly and very ur-
gently. So I brought in this guy named 
Julien Neals, whom I didn’t quite know 
that well, but he was so well highly 
recommended. 
He moved from the private sector, 
where he was with a very prestigious 
New Jersey law firm, and decided to 
lead the transformation in New Jer-
sey’s largest municipal court. He knew 
that it was a court system that had to 
change, and he stepped up. He changed 
it. He changed the way our court oper-
ated. He centered it in common com-
munity values and made sure that ev-
eryone who came before that court was 
treated in a way that affirmed their 
dignity, no matter what the matter 
was. 
He pioneered innovations that the 
whole State—in fact, many places in 
our Nation—took notice of. He created 
the first community court in the State 
of New Jersey, the first youth court, 
and the first veterans court. He real-
ized that citizens all have, often, dif-
ferent needs, especially folks like our 
young people and our veterans, and 
that there is a different way to achieve 
a larger standard and a larger ideal of 
justice. 
Well, the problem is, when you do so 
well in one job, you get pushed to an-
other opportunity. I quickly moved 
him from being my chief judge of New 
Jersey’s largest municipal court to 
come in and be my corporation counsel 
in my mayoral administration. 
In the wake of the recession in 2008, 
he became the business manager, the 
person who runs the city day to day, 
and under the most difficult, savage of 
circumstances, he made challenging 
changes that helped us get through 
that very difficult period. 
Cities all over New Jersey were being 
crushed financially, making massive 
amounts of layoffs, and in those finan-
cial times, he was able to get our city 
to be dramatically more efficient, to 
bring in new ideas that helped us to 
create everything from environmental 
sustainability to expanding access to 
municipal services to the public. He 
brought in innovations that became 
really par for the course all over New 
Jersey, but Newark did them first. 
Today, now, Julien serves as the 
counsel for the largest county in New 
Jersey—a county that is bigger than 
some of our States. 
I have had the privilege of knowing 
Julien, as I have said, now for the past 
couple decades, and I have watched him 
handle challenge after challenge, from 
a global recession to Hurricane Sandy. 
He has stood in the saddle and helped 
with calmness, with coolness, with an 
equipoise that is enviable to all, in-
cluding me. I have watched him lead. I 
have watched him care. I have watched 
his love of others be reflected in the de-
cisions he made under the most dif-
ficult of circumstances. I have seen 
him in crisis after crisis rise not just to 
meet the challenge but to, in most cir-
cumstances, have us come out better 
off than we were before. 
He, in so many ways, is one of the 
great leaders I have had the privilege 
of working with in my life. Julien 
Neals is brilliant. He is thoughtful. He 
is deliberate in his decision making. He 
has all of the ideals that I think we 
want in a Federal judge. 
I have to tell you, most importantly 
to me, I know him. I know his parents. 
I know his family. I know his kids. He 
is one of those people who would make 
you proud not just in knowing but in 
ascending to a position like a judge. I 
know he will make us proud in the way 
that he leads from the bench. 
I want to thank President Biden for 
nominating him. I want to encourage 
all of my colleagues in a bipartisan 
way, as I said in the Judiciary Com-
mittee, to consider supporting him. 
I have had many privileges as a U.S. 
Senator. God, this is one of those jobs 
where you have to, like, give glory to 
God every day for just having the privi-
lege of standing on this floor and get-
ting to be a part of some things that, 
as much as we rancor back and forth, 
we should all be proud of, whether it is 
a global pandemic or just making sure 
we are funding critical parts of the 
government 
where 
public 
servants 
serve. But of all the privileges I have, 
I have to say this is one of the great 
ones, the chance to make a man whom 
I look up to in every way—make him a 
Federal judge, to try to encourage my 
colleagues to make him a Federal 
judge. 
I see that my senior Senator, my 
friend—another guy I look up to even 
though I got him by an inch or two— 
has come to the floor, and if the Pre-
siding Officer would allow me, I would 
like to yield to the senior Senator of 
the State of New Jersey—more hand-
some than I am, but I think we are an 
equal tag team when it comes to serv-
ing our State. 
I yield the floor with the fear that he 
does have the microphone last.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3953 
June 7, 2021 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sen-
ior Senator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, 
it is a fear that one should have as to 
who gets the microphone last, but 
nonetheless, no need to fear. I think 
that statement about better looking is 
a Pinocchio on your part, in any event. 
But I will stop before I get called out of 
order. 
Madam President, it is with great ur-
gency that I come to the floor to urge 
support for the confirmation of Julien 
Xavier Neals to be a U.S. district court 
judge in New Jersey. My distinguished 
colleague, who knows Mr. Neals ex-
traordinarily well, can speak to all the 
elements of him as a human being, as a 
lawyer, and as someone who was a 
judge at one level and, in fact, can be 
and will be an extraordinary district 
court judge. 
We are known in New Jersey as hav-
ing one of the busiest courts in the en-
tire country. As of last year, more than 
46,000 cases were pending before it, 
many of them among the most complex 
and challenging cases in the Nation. 
Yet multiple judicial vacancies on the 
court have led the Judicial Conference 
of the United States to declare a judi-
cial emergency. The court is short- 
staffed by a third, leaving each of our 
seated judges with a mind-boggling 
caseload of 2,700 pending cases. That is 
a caseload more than three times high-
er than the national average. 
Fortunately, this week, the Senate 
has an opportunity to begin alleviating 
this judicial emergency by confirming 
Julien Neals to the U.S. District Court 
in New Jersey. Mr. Neals is an out-
standing nominee who has devoted his 
entire career to the practice of law in 
my 
home 
State 
of 
New 
Jersey. 
Throughout his three decades in the 
legal profession, he has served in many 
diverse roles. Every step of the way, he 
has impressed those around him with 
his integrity, sound judgment, and 
commitment to equal justice and fair 
administration of the law. 
He clerked on the Superior Court of 
New Jersey, practiced civil rights, em-
ployment discrimination, and intellec-
tual property law as an associate and 
partner of a Secaucus-based firm. He 
served the city of Newark during my 
distinguished colleague Senator BOOK-
ER’s time as the mayor of that great 
city of Newark and since 2015 has 
worked as counsel for Bergen County, 
the most populous county in all of New 
Jersey. 
As you heard, my colleague still 
speaks glowingly of Mr. Neals’ achieve-
ments during his time as chief judge of 
the Newark Municipal Court, how he 
improved the efficiency and the culture 
of the institution, created the first 
community court in the State of New 
Jersey, and in less than 2 years pre-
sided over more than 6,000 cases, while 
supervising 11 full-time judges. 
There is no doubt in my mind that 
Mr. Neals will be an asset to the U.S. 
District Court in New Jersey as it 
emerges from this pandemic and works 
to reduce its backlog of pending cases. 
He is qualified, and he was qualified to 
serve on the Federal bench back in 2015 
when President Obama first nominated 
him to the U.S. District Court in New 
Jersey. Unfortunately, the politics of 
the time didn’t get him a vote, and he 
is even more qualified today. 
Mr. Neals already commands enor-
mous respect in our legal community. 
From serving on the Supreme Court of 
New Jersey’s Committee on Character 
and Fitness to serving as chairman for 
the Volunteer Lawyers for Justice, he 
personifies the meaning of public serv-
ice. His tremendous breadth of experi-
ence, even temperament, and sound 
judgment make him a superb candidate 
to serve on the Federal bench. Clearly 
our colleagues on the Judiciary Com-
mittee here in the Senate came to the 
same conclusion when they reported 
him out of committee by a large bipar-
tisan margin. 
New Jerseyans have waited too long 
for the Senate to fill this vacancy, and 
I urge my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle to confirm Mr. Julien Neals 
without further delay. I am thrilled to 
join my colleague from New Jersey in 
advocating for him and especially 
thankful to the junior Senator from 
New Jersey for advancing his name so 
that justice can be realized in the 
State of New Jersey. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING

The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
Mr. BOOKER. Madam President, is 
there a pending vote now on the clo-
ture vote? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ate is in a quorum call. 
Mr. BOOKER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The vote is to occur in 3 minutes. 
Mr. BOOKER. Madam President, I ap-
preciate the 180 seconds, and I will be 
patient and wait. 
I am sorry. There is a quorum call, 
correct? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. No. 
The senior Senator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent to waive all ex-
isting time and move towards the vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. BOOKER. Reserving the right to 
object, I would just like to say that is 
why he is the senior Senator.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3954 
June 7, 2021 
The motion is agreed to. 
The Senator from New York. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 1520 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I 
rise to ask that the Senate be given the 
chance to consider and vote on the 
Military Justice Improvement and In-
creasing Prevention Act. 
Before I discuss the bill, I would like 
to first acknowledge that we have just 
returned from Memorial Day recess 
and to recognize the men and women 
who made the ultimate sacrifice to 
protect our country and to protect our 
freedom. They got on a plane or they 
got on a ship; they went to countries 
they may never have been to before; 
they fought for our country; and they 
didn’t come home. 
We ask so much of our servicemem-
bers and their families, and we owe it 
to them to take action when they are 
in danger. That is why I want to talk 
about this bill right now. 
Sexual assault in the military is an 
epidemic. Year after year, reports of 
sexual assault have gone up, but con-
viction rates and prosecution rates 
have actually come down. This stems 
from a fundamental problem which has 
to be addressed: There is bias in our 
military justice system. 
Right now, if you are a victim of sex-
ual assault or another serious crime, 
the decision to prosecute goes to a 
commander, not to a trained military 
prosecutor. And while our commanders 
are exceptional leaders and exceptional 
warfighters, they are not legal experts, 
nor should they be asked to be. Nor can 
commanders 
be 
truly 
independent 
when considering charges against a 
subordinate or charges made by a sub-
ordinate. 
This bill removes the decision of 
whether to prosecute sexual assaults or 
any other serious crime out of the 
chain of command and gives it to 
trained military prosecutors, where it 
belongs. This would establish some-
thing fundamental to our justice sys-
tem: blind justice. It is a simple 
change. It is a change that is supported 
by legal experts, by JAGs, by com-
manders, by generals, by admirals, by 
veterans. 
Opponents of this bill—and their 
numbers are dwindling—claim that 
this one change would somehow under-
mine good order and discipline. Well, I 
will tell you, I have heard that one be-
fore. It is the same weak argument 
they have made time and time again. 
Many people stood on this floor and 
said that we could not repeal don’t ask, 
don’t tell because it undermined good 
order and discipline. When we wanted 
to integrate the military and have 
Black servicemembers serve, we were 
told we couldn’t possibly do that; it 
would undermine good order and dis-
cipline. We made the case that LGBTQ 
members should be able to serve open-
ly, that trans members should be able 
to serve openly. We were told: You 
can’t possibly do that; it would under-
mine good order and discipline. When 
we asked for women to be able to serve 
in combat, something they had been 
doing for a very long time but not nec-
essarily getting credit for it, we were 
told: You can’t possibly do that; it will 
undermine good order and discipline. 
But each of those times Congress 
rose to the occasion and did the right 
thing and did the thing that was nec-
essary to make our military stronger, 
and each time our military became 
stronger. 
Further undermining this argument 
is the fact that this system, or versions 
very similar to it, are being used today 
by our allies that we fight side by side, 
allies like the UK or Israel or Germany 
or Netherlands or Australia or Canada. 
They did not see a degradation of good 
order and discipline. They told us so. 
Finally, in addition to the opposition 
to this bill being a weak argument, the 
support for this bill is strong, and that 
support continues to grow. How many 
bills have you heard of in this Con-
gress, or the last, or the last, or the 
last that have 66 cosponsors? Widely bi-
partisan. How many bills have LIZ 
WARREN
and TED
CRUZ
on them or 
MITCH MCCONNELL and CHUCK SCHUMER 
in support of? It doesn’t happen very 
often. 
But this is something that I and 
many Senators in this Chamber have 
been working on for 8 years, holding 
hearings on for 8 years, making amend-
ments in the NDAA for 8 years, making 
the case that this change is needed for 
8 years. And through all that work and 
through all that advocacy, we now 
have 66 cosponsors—a majority of the 
Senate, a majority of the Armed Serv-
ices Committee. This bill deserves a 
vote. This bill deserves to have the 
Senate vote on it now. It is time to 
pass this law, and it is time to do our 
jobs. 
Mr. President, as if in legislative ses-
sion, I ask unanimous consent that, at 
a time to be determined by the major-
ity leader in consultation with the Re-
publican leader, the Senate Armed 
Services Committee be discharged from 
further consideration of S. 1520 and the 
Senate proceed to its consideration; 
that there be 2 hours for debate, equal-
ly divided, in the usual form and that 
upon the use or yielding back of that 
time, the Senate vote on the bill with 
no intervening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, reserving 
the right to object, first of all, let me 
commend Senator GILLIBRAND. No one 
has been as relentless in terms of try-
ing to improve the Uniform Code of 
Military Justice, particularly with re-
spect to sexual assault. And I agree: 
These crimes involving sexual assault 
can be properly moved out, done so in 
a way that does not impede good order 
and discipline in the U.S. military. 
The issue that is emerging is an issue 
of the scope. The Senator’s bill in-
cludes felonies like burglary and lar-
ceny that do not involve sexual as-
sault. The Senator has pointed out, and 
I think correctly, that Congress has 
risen to the occasion. In fact, I was 
with people who wanted to repeal 
‘‘don’t ask, don’t tell.’’ I was fighting 
for those things, along with other pro-
visions that she cited. 
But Congress has done the right 
thing only after careful consideration, 
and we have that opportunity in the 
committee. That is the way we have 
done every piece of major legislation 
since I have been here over a couple 
decades. There will be an opportunity 
to vote on all these issues in the com-
mittee with men and women who have 
great insight and knowledge—combat 
veterans, others who have served for a 
very long time. And they have in-
vested, as I know the Senator has in-
vested, time and effort and can perhaps 
improve the bill and perhaps point out 
areas of the bill that have not been 
thoroughly analyzed. 
So I think it is incumbent upon us to 
move forward to consider this bill in 
committee and then to bring it to the 
floor of the Senate. There will be op-
portunities for amendments, and at the 
end of the day, we will have, I think, 
one, a better bill, perhaps. But, two, we 
will have a bill that people can em-
brace because it has been thoroughly 
vetted by the committee of jurisdic-
tion. 
So for those reasons, I would object 
to the unanimous consent request. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from New York. 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, 
while the chairman does agree that the 
serious crime of sexual assault should 
be taken out of the chain of command, 
our bill requests and requires that all 
serious crimes be taken out of the 
chain of command because of the exist-
ence of bias. And we have two data 
points that prove that bias. One is the 
poor results we have seen for survivors 
of sexual assaults over the last 10 years 
that data has been collected, and the 
second data point we have, which has 
been developed over the last 3 years, is 
the existence of racial bias. 
Protect Our Defenders did a serious 
report in 2017, and it determined that 
across all services, looking at all pun-
ishments, Black and Brown service-
members were punished approximately 
two times more often than White serv-
icemembers, looking at both non-
judicial and court-martials. And that 
show of bias means that the military 
justice system isn’t working for many 
people. It is not working for plaintiffs, 
and it is not working for defendants. 
And, in fact, when our allies looked 
at this same issue, particularly defend-
ants’ rights over the last 40 years, they 
determined that bias in the system was 
incompatible with their views of jus-
tice, and they decided that for defend-
ants’ rights, specifically, all serious 
crimes should be decided by trained 
military prosecutors. 
So this solution is one we have been 
debating in the committee for 8 years, 
and, in fact, we have used compromises

and smaller steps and small-ball meas-
ures over the last 8 years to address 
this problem. Unfortunately, despite 
putting in place approximately 250 new 
measures over the last 8 years, the rate 
of conviction and the rate of prosecu-
tion is still going down, but the rate of 
sexual assault has stayed persistent at 
approximately 20,000 incidents a year. 
So while I appreciate that my col-
league is coming to the conclusion that 
one serious crime should be taken out 
of the chain of command, military ex-
perts disagree that a line should be 
drawn around only one crime because 
they believe that that will result in un-
fair systems of justice—two systems of 
justice and one that does not meet the 
needs of bias that we see in the current 
system. 
Second, we have many combat vet-
erans on this legislation. JONI ERNST is 
one of our lead sponsors, who is the 
only female Republican combat vet-
eran and who has also experienced sex-
ual assault. MARK KELLY is on our bill. 
TAMMY DUCKWORTH is on our bill. GARY 
PETERS is on our bill. JOSH HAWLEY is 
on our bill. And we also have many of 
our attorneys general on this bill, peo-
ple who have looked at the law from a 
perspective of civil rights and civil lib-
erties, such as RICHARD BLUMENTHAL. 
This matters, and I believe that we 
have given the committee 8 years to 
solve this problem. 
Third, when we have given the oppor-
tunity to the committee to solve this 
problem and pass meaningful—mean-
ingful—reforms, if the DOD disagreed 
with those reforms, despite passing in 
the House and in the Senate, they have 
seen fit to make sure those reforms 
have been taken out in conference. One 
such example was legislation we passed 
in 2019 creating a ‘‘safe to report’’ pro-
vision, which would have allowed sur-
vivors of sexual assault to come for-
ward to report the crime but not be 
prosecuted for related smaller crimes, 
such as drinking or being off base. 
That language passed the Senate. It 
passed the House. And, miraculously, 
because the DOD didn’t approve, it was 
taken out in conference. In 2020, the 
Senators who worked on that provi-
sion, Senator ERNST and I, made very 
clear that we did not appreciate staff 
members taking out work and provi-
sions that had been considered and 
voted on by Senators as part of their 
responsibility. And we were able to 
pass it the second time. 
So, unfortunately, Mr. President, I 
don’t have faith that if we allow the 
committee to look at this bill and pass 
it in the Senate and the House, that it 
will not be watered down or taken out 
in conference without the consent of 
all the Senators who voted for it. 
Therefore, I urge this body to allow 
for an up-or-down vote on this Senate 
floor. That is a privilege that was given 
‘‘don’t ask, don’t tell’’ repeal because 
of similar filibusters by members of 
the Armed Services Committee. When 
we voted on ‘‘don’t ask, don’t tell,’’ it 
was an up-or-down Senate vote. This 
deserves the same opportunity. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
SMITH). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
77TH ANNIVERSARY OF D-DAY 
Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I 
am here on the floor of the Senate this 
evening to commemorate the 77th an-
niversary of D-day. This was a huge 
turning point in World War II, of 
course. The invasion of Normandy oc-
curred 77 years ago yesterday. 
Historian Douglas Brinkley wrote 
that D-day was the single most impor-
tant moment in the 20th century and 
one of the most tragic, too, in terms of 
loss of life. I think he was right. There 
were 160,000 soldiers who crossed the 
Channel that day to begin the cam-
paign to recapture Europe from Hit-
ler’s 
rule. 
On 
their 
backs 
were 
rucksacks with 80 pounds of gear, but 
so too was the fate of all of us—our al-
lies in Europe and, really, the fate of 
the free world. 
Many of our best and brightest young 
Americans did fall that day. We lost 
more than 10,000 men in 1 day. The 
Nazis had spent 2 years fortifying the 
coast to prepare for this moment. It 
was Hitler’s so-called Atlantic Wall. 
The beautiful coastline of Northern 
France was covered in barbed wire, 
land mines, and bunkers, but at the 
end of the largest amphibious invasion 
in history, we stood victorious, bat-
tered but not broken. On we marched 
through France, through Belgium, and, 
finally, into Germany itself. 
But even today, amid the flowers and 
fields of Normandy—I have been there, 
and many of you have been there who 
are listening tonight—you can feel, 
even today, the lingering presence of 
those who died that day in the service 
of liberating Europe, and you can see it 
in the stark, orderly U.S. military 
cemeteries, where row after row of 
white crosses and Stars of David com-
memorate those brave souls who were 
lost—representing lives lost in a noble 
cause. Though much has happened in 
the following 77 years, we can never 
lose sight of the valor and the sacrifice 
by our Armed Forces on that 1 day. 
On Memorial Day, about a week ago, 
I spoke at the National Veterans Me-
morial and Museum in Columbus, OH. 
It was a hopeful day for me not just to 
have so many people together as we 
emerged from COVID–19—really the 
first big public event they have had— 
but also to see the generations of vet-
erans and family members there to 
honor the fallen: World War II vet-
erans, Gulf war veterans, Korean war 
veterans, Vietnam veterans, and vet-
erans, of course, from Afghanistan and 
Iraq. They represented the living em-
bodiment of the stories we ought to be 
remembering from a war that recedes 
further into the past with every pass-
ing year. 
They are the stories of valor like 
that displayed by Jim ‘‘Pee Wee’’ Mar-
tin from Dayton, OH. On that day, he 
and the rest of the 506th Parachute In-
fantry Regiment parachuted behind 
German lines in the dark of pre-dawn. 
Jim was wounded but fought bravely, 
earning both the Purple Heart and the 
Bronze Star for his efforts. 
They are the stories of sacrifice like 
that of the Napier brothers of Warren 
County in southwest Ohio, the county 
my mom is from. All five of the broth-
ers served in the war, and two of the 
five brothers landed at D-day. One died 
there on the beaches, never to return 
to his Ohio home. 
These are stories to be preserved for 
generations to come. The memory of D- 
day and, indeed, of all of World War II 
must never be lost. 
Since I have been here in the U.S. 
Senate, I have often come to the floor 
on D-day to recite the special prayer 
that was given that day by Franklin 
Delano Roosevelt. It was expected, of 
course, that FDR would give a speech 
when the invasion took place—one of 
his fireside chats from the White 
House—but for some reason, FDR was 
moved to prayer. The famous prayer 
that he gave that day has become 
known as the D-day Prayer. It is a pow-
erful statement, my favorite Presi-
dential statement and one that de-
serves to be remembered for genera-
tions to come. 
In 2013, I introduced legislation, 
called the World War II Memorial 
Prayer Act, which directs the Sec-
retary of the Interior to install a 
plaque to be placed at the World War II 
Memorial, on the National Mall, with 
the words of the D-day Prayer. It is a 
beautiful memorial, but, frankly, some 
more interpretation wouldn’t be a bad 
thing, and having that prayer there, as 
you will see in a moment when we re-
cite it, would be an appropriate way to 
pay tribute to those who lost their 
lives that day. 
It was the Ohio Christian Alliance 
President, Chris Long, who first came 
to me with the idea of a plaque to dis-
play this historic prayer. That legisla-
tion was actually signed into law with 
the help of Senator Joe Lieberman. On 
a bipartisan basis, we got it passed in 
2014. 
The friends of the National World 
War II Memorial and the National Park 
Service, since that time, have worked 
with us to develop and refine the final 
permanent plaque design. Most re-
cently, they received design approvals 
from the Commission of Fine Arts and 
the National Capital Planning Com-
mission. 
It takes a while to get things done on 
the National Mall, I found. There is 
quite a process. It has now been 7 
years, longer than World War II itself. 
Despite the hurdles, we have yet to see 
the final plaque installed, but it will be 
done, by the way, not at any cost to

the taxpayers, meaning private fund-
raising, not taxpayer dollars, will be 
used. We had hoped to have the final 
plaque in place for the 75th anniver-
sary. In the meantime, in 2019, we were 
able to have a temporary plaque in 
place with the words of the prayer at 
the permanent location for the perma-
nent plaque, which is at the Circle of 
Remembrance, next to the World War 
II Memorial. 
If you are on The Mall and you are 
coming from the Capitol, it will be on 
your right. It is north of the World War 
II Memorial but right next to it. In this 
very beautiful place, the Circle of Re-
membrance—a good place to sit and re-
flect—you will see, right now, the 
plaque is there, and you can read the 
prayer. The permanent plaque will be 
even bigger and will allow even more 
people to have access to it. I encourage 
people to go see that plaque. By the 
way, I think it is the only prayer on 
display on our National Mall. 
The temporary plaque, by the way, 
was generously donated by the Friends 
of the National World War II Memorial. 
We are very hopeful that the perma-
nent plaque will be placed at the circle 
next year. I want to thank the Lilly 
Endowment for its generous support of 
this project, by the way. Last October, 
it provided a $2 million grant for the 
construction and installation of the 
permanent plaque. This committed fi-
nancial support will be critical to fi-
nally bringing the project across the 
line. 
The fact that a prayer was offered 
that day by our Commander in Chief is 
historic in and of itself, but it is the 
content of the prayer that makes it so 
worthy of remembrance. I would now 
like to read this World War II D-day 
Prayer, if I may. 
My fellow Americans [FDR began]: Last 
night, when I spoke with you about the fall 
of Rome, I knew at that moment that troops 
of the United States and our allies were 
crossing the Channel in another and greater 
operation. It has come to pass with success 
thus far. 
And so, in this poignant hour, I ask you to 
join with me in prayer: 
Almighty God: Our sons, pride of our Na-
tion, this day have set upon a mighty en-
deavor, a struggle to preserve our Republic, 
our religion, and our civilization, and to set 
free a suffering humanity. 
Lead them straight and true; give strength 
to their arms, stoutness to their hearts, 
steadfastness in their faith. 
They will need Thy blessings. Their road 
will be long and hard, for the enemy is 
strong. He may hurl back our forces. Success 
may not come with rushing speed, but we 
shall return again and again; and we know 
that by Thy grace, and by the righteousness 
of our cause, our sons will [prevail]. 
They will be sore tried, by night and by 
day, without rest—until the victory is won. 
The darkness will be rent by noise and flame. 
Men’s souls will be shaken with the violences 
of war. 
For these men are lately drawn from the 
ways of peace. They fight not for the lust of 
conquest. They fight to end conquest. They 
fight to liberate. They fight to let justice 
arise, and tolerance and good will among all 
Thy people. They yearn but for the end of 
battle, for their return to the haven of home. 
Some will never return. Embrace these, 
Father, and receive them, Thy heroic serv-
ants, into Thy kingdom. 
And for us at home—fathers, mothers, chil-
dren, wives, sisters, and brothers of brave 
men overseas—whose thoughts and prayers 
are ever with them—help us, Almighty God, 
to rededicate ourselves in renewed faith in 
Thee in this hour of great sacrifice. 
Many people have urged that I call the Na-
tion into a single day of special prayer. But 
because the road is long and the desire is 
great, I ask that our people devote them-
selves in a continuance of prayer. As we rise 
to each new day, and again when each day is 
spent, let words of prayer be on our lips, in-
voking Thy help to our efforts. 
Give us strength, too—strength in our 
daily tasks, to redouble the contributions we 
make in the physical and the material sup-
port of our armed forces. 
And let our hearts be stout, to wait out the 
long travail, to bear sorrows that may come, 
to 
impart 
our 
courage 
unto 
our 
sons 
wheresoever they may be. 
And, O Lord, give us Faith. Give us Faith 
in Thee; Faith in our sons; Faith in each 
other; Faith in our united crusade. Let not 
the keenness of our spirit ever be dulled. Let 
not the impacts of temporary events, of tem-
poral matters of but fleeting moment let not 
these deter us in our unconquerable purpose. 
With Thy blessing, we shall prevail over 
the unholy forces of our enemy. Help us to 
conquer the apostles of greed and racial 
arrogancies. Lead us to the saving of our 
country, and with our sister Nations into a 
world unity that will spell a sure peace a 
peace invulnerable to the schemings of un-
worthy men. And a peace that will let all of 
men live in freedom, reaping the just re-
wards of their honest toil. 
Thy will be done, Almighty God. 
Amen. 
A powerful prayer. I love the part 
about they come not to conquer; they 
come to liberate. The same can be said 
for our Armed Forces throughout the 
ages. 
I look forward to seeing these words 
of prayer permanently displayed on the 
National Mall to help us memorialize 
such a noble day we must never forget. 
I yield the floor.

LEGISLATIVE SESSION 
MORNING BUSINESS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the Sen-
ate proceed to legislative session for a 
period of morning business, with Sen-
ators permitted to speak therein for up 
to 10 minutes each. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

CONFIRMATION OF ERIC S. 
LANDER 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, per an 
agreement that was reached with my 
colleagues, Dr. Eric Lander, the Presi-
dent’s nominee for the Director of the 
Office of Science and Technology Pol-
icy was not subject to a rollcall vote on 
the Senate floor, but was instead con-
sidered under a voice vote. 
I would like to be on the record that 
I am opposed to the nomination of Dr. 
Lander. As OSTP Director, Dr. Lander 
will advise the President and the ad-
ministration on all the scientific, tech-
nological, and engineering aspects of 
Federal policy, including Federal re-
search. Dr. Lander should receive even 
further scrutiny for this position after 
President Biden has chosen to elevate 
the Director of the OSTP to a Cabinet- 
level position. 
This nomination comes at a critical 
time as the Senate seeks to pass the 
Endless Frontier Act, which would in-
crease Federal scientific research and 
development funding—imprudently in 
my opinion—by over $100 billion. As I 
have weighed the nomination of Dr. 
Lander both in the Senate Commerce 
Committee and in the weeks leading up 
to his consideration by the full Senate, 
Dr. Lander has failed to provide the 
guarantees that he supports appro-
priate 
guardrails 
around 
federally 
funded research, including protections 
for unborn life through the prohibition 
of experimenting with aborted fetal 
tissue, embryonic stem cells, or live 
embryos. 
With the consideration of the Endless 
Frontier Act and the greater role that 
OSTP will take in directing the direc-
tion of our Federal research and devel-
opment, I am very concerned that Dr. 
Lander has not assured me that he will 
put in place protections for the unborn 
or institute appropriate ethical guard-
rails to protect such life. 
For these reasons, I opposed the nom-
ination of Dr. Lander.

TRIBUTE TO BRIGADIER GENERAL 
NEIL R. RICHARDSON 
Mr. 
INHOFE. 
Madam 
President, 
today I honor a servant leader, liaison, 
and combat warrior. After 2 years of 
service as Director of the Air Force 
Senate Liaison Office, Brig. Gen. Neil 
Richardson is deservedly moving on 
and assuming the responsibilities of 
Deputy Director of Operations of Air 
Mobility Command at Scott Air Force 
Base, IL. On this occasion, I believe it 
is fitting to recognize General Richard-
son’s distinguished service and dedica-
tion to fostering the relationship be-
tween the U.S. Air Force and this 
Chamber. 
A C–130 weapons officer and navi-
gator by designation, General Richard-
son has led our Nation’s men and 
women in combat, overseas, and at 
home. He has led at every level with 
highlights as an instructor navigator 
at 
the 
C–130 
Weapons 
Instructor 
Course, the commander of the 447th Ex-
peditionary Operations Support Squad-
ron, leading joint and coalition airfield 
operations at Baghdad International 
Airport, Iraq, and the 87th Air Base 
Wing 
commander 
at 
Joint 
Base 
McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in New Jersey, 
the 
Defense 
Department’s 
only 
triservice joint base. The Air Force has 
consistently relied upon General Rich-
ardson’s exceptional leadership and un-
paralleled work ethic.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3957 
June 7, 2021 
General Richardson has excelled in 
numerous other leadership positions in 
the Air Force, most recently as the Di-
rector, Air Force Senate Liaison. In 
the Russell Senate Office Building and 
around the globe, General Richardson 
facilitated 
communications 
between 
the Chamber and the Department of 
the Air Force in establishing the U.S. 
Space Force. He supported the Depart-
ment of the Air Force in twice gaining 
confirmation of the Secretary of the 
Air Force and the Chief of Staff of the 
Air Force. 
General Richardson and his team 
twice supported successful legislation 
of the National Defense Authorization 
Act despite challenges resulting from 
the unprecedented coronavirus pan-
demic and heightened security on Cap-
itol Hill. His team facilitated 200 con-
gressional engagements with Air Force 
and Space Force senior leaders to in-
clude seven Air Force Caucus events 
and the establishment of our new 
Space Force Caucus. Furthermore, his 
team escorted congressional delega-
tions for more than 84 Members of Con-
gress on visits both stateside and 
abroad to include our annual trip to 
the Ronald Reagan National Defense 
Forum. 
Next month, General Richardson de-
parts Washington for Scott Air Force 
Base, IL, to serve as the deputy direc-
tor of the greatest airlift, aerial refuel-
ing, 
and 
aeromedical 
evacuation 
logistical force in the world. This 
Chamber will feel General Richardson’s 
absence. I join many past and present 
Members of Congress in my gratitude 
and appreciation to General Richard-
son for his outstanding leadership and 
unwavering support of the missions of 
the U.S. Air Force and especially rec-
ognize his patient and supportive fam-
ily, Mrs. Melissa Richardson, their 
daughter 
Megan, 
her 
husband 
Air 
Force SSgt Nathan Brock, along with 
the rest of his children; Katie, Garrett, 
and Gage. I wish this Air Force family 
safe travels and endless gratitude for 
their dedicated service to our Nation.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO DR. HEBER SIMMONS, 
JR. 
∑ Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Madam Presi-
dent, the American Academy of Pedi-
atric 
Dentists, 
AAPD, 
last 
month 
named Dr. Heber Simmons, Jr., of 
Jackson, MS, as its 2021 Pediatric Den-
tist of the Year. I commend him for his 
decades of service and for the signifi-
cant contributions he has made to the 
dental profession. His lifetime commit-
ment to the specialty of pediatric den-
tistry has helped advance children’s 
health in Mississippi and around the 
country. Dr. Simmons’ many years of 
clinical practice, his dedication to im-
proving academic dentistry, and his 
passion for public policy make him a 
deserving recipient of the Pediatric 
Dentist of the Year honor. 
Dr. Simmons received his dental de-
gree from the University of Tennessee 
and completed his pediatric dentistry 
training there after serving our Nation 
for 3 years in the U.S. Army Dental 
Corps. Following his training and mili-
tary service, Dr. Simmons practiced for 
57 years in Jackson before retiring re-
cently from active practice. His pas-
sion and dedication have made him a 
national leader in dentistry, proven by 
his past presidencies of the AAPD, the 
American Academy of Dental Practice 
Administration, the Pierre Fauchard 
Academy, and the Mississippi Dental 
Association. Furthermore, he received 
the AAPD Distinguished Service Award 
in 1994 and the Ann Page Griffin Hu-
manitarian Award in 2011. For many 
years, he served on the Board of Trust-
ees of the American Dental Associa-
tion, ADA, serving as a spokesperson 
for the ADA from 1981 to 2019. In this 
role, he was featured on nationally 
televised programs such as ‘‘60 Min-
utes’’ and ‘‘Good Morning, America.’’ 
Dr. Simmons currently serves as a 
special consultant to the AAPD Board 
of Trustees after serving as the acad-
emy’s congressional liaison since 1997. 
As AAPD Congressional Liaison, he 
helped educate Members of Congress 
and their staffs concerning oral health 
issues for children, testified before 
Congress, and served in a key leader-
ship role in AAPD advocacy efforts. 
This includes helping to allocate more 
than $158 million for pediatric den-
tistry to the title VII program at the 
Health Resources and Services Admin-
istration. For this work, Heber was 
awarded an AAPD Presidential Cita-
tion in 2001, and more recently, his 
alma mater, the College of Dentistry at 
the University of Tennessee Health 
Science Center, recreated an endowed 
professorship in his name. Last year, at 
the AAPD Pediatric Oral Health Advo-
cacy Conference, Dr. Simmons was the 
keynote speaker and received another 
Presidential citation in recognition of 
and appreciation for his tireless and 
dedicated national advocacy for his 
profession and the oral health of Amer-
ica’s children. 
I commend Dr. Heber Simmons, Jr., 
for his many accomplishments and 
well-deserved recognition of his advo-
cacy, dedication, and leadership. My 
State is fortunate to have him as a 
leader focused on the health and 
wellness of all Mississippians. I con-
gratulate him on being recognized for 
his many years of service by being 
named the 2021 Pediatric Dentist of the 
Year.∑
