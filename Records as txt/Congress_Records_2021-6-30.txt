PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
God our guide, we pray this day that 
You would go before us as we head into 
the business that awaits. And as we 
proceed, may we see Your hand in both 
the ordinary as well as the exceptional. 
Reveal to us Your intent as we at-
tend to the simple things and make us 
ever mindful that as inconsequential as 
they may seem, over even the least of 
these, You have authority. 
Unveil Your will as we address the 
substantial items and remind us that 
through the significant decisions made 
by this body, You remain sovereign. 
Make us keenly aware of Your claim 
on each and every Member of this 
House and those who labor alongside 
them in these hallowed Halls and be-
yond, that we all would be faithful in 
our service to You even as we serve the 
people. 
Holy God, remain with us on the 
journey You have set before us. Never 
leave or forsake us. But abide with us 
as we seek to walk in obedience to You 
this day. 
It is in the strength of Your name we 
pray. 
Amen.

TRIBUTE TO ANDREA HARRIS 
(Ms. ADAMS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. ADAMS. Madam Speaker, I am 
honored today to stand on the floor of 
the House to honor the life of a cher-
ished friend and extraordinary North 
Carolinian, Andrea L. Harris, a resi-
dent of Henderson, North Carolina, who 
passed away on May 20, 2020. 
Her death leaves a tremendous void 
throughout our State, but her life’s 
work is a lasting reminder of her cou-
rageous fight for civil and human 
rights, social justice, and building 
Black wealth. 
A bold voice of reason for the under-
represented, her work helped improve 
the quality of life for so many. 
A proud alumna of Bennett College, 
an advocate for HBCUs, a shero for 
Black businesses, this ‘‘mother of mi-
nority enterprise’’ was always about 
making good trouble. 
She cofounded the North Carolina In-
stitute for Minority Economic Devel-
opment, serving as president for more 
than two decades. 
Andrea L. Harris made our State, our 
community, and our world much better 
than she found it and fulfilled the 
Scripture in Psalms 84:10, which says: 
‘‘Better is one day in Your courts than 
a thousand elsewhere; I would rather 
be a doorkeeper in the house of my God 
than dwell in the tents of the wicked.’’ 
Rest in peace, my friend. 
Andrea, we love and miss you. 
f 
REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 18, NO 
TAXPAYER FUNDING FOR ABOR-
TION ACT 
(Mr. GRIFFITH asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, the 
Hyde amendment respects the deeply 
held beliefs of pro-life people like me 
by not spending our tax dollars to pay 
for abortions. 
But support for the Hyde amendment 
goes beyond the pro-life community. It 
has enjoyed broad bipartisan support 
during most of its 45-year history, pre-
viously including the current Demo-
crat in the Oval Office.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3312 
June 30, 2021 
That is because it respects a cher-
ished American value, freedom of con-
science regarding our deepest religious 
beliefs. Now, that freedom is under at-
tack by radicals running this country. 
Their assault on the Hyde amendment 
threatens to undo this important pro-
tection for the lives of millions and the 
consciences of millions more. 
That is why we need H.R. 18, the No 
Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Committees on En-
ergy and Commerce, Ways and Means, 
and the Judiciary be discharged from 
further consideration of H.R. 18, and 
ask for its immediate consideration in 
the House. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
DEGETTE). Under guidelines consist-
ently issued by successive Speakers, as 
recorded in section 956 of the House 
Rules and Manual, the Chair is con-
strained not to entertain the request 
unless it has been cleared by the bipar-
tisan floor and committee leaderships. 
f 
NO TIME TO WASTE ON 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
(Ms. WILD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. WILD. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to talk about the INVEST in 
America Act, an important moment in 
the fight to upgrade our national infra-
structure. 
I am so glad to see the House take a 
critical step toward fulfilling many of 
the key priorities laid out in the Amer-
ican Jobs Plan by passing this bill. 
I want to be really frank. There is no 
time to waste on this. We urgently 
need to fix the roads, bridges, tunnels, 
and drainage systems that we see 
crumbling around the country. 
Not only does the INVEST Act ad-
dress some of the key infrastructure 
needs of our country, but it also cre-
ates good-paying, middle-class jobs 
that 
will 
turbocharge 
economic 
growth. 
The INVEST Act also includes $20 
million in key infrastructure invest-
ments for my district, Pennsylvania’s 
Seventh, that will support our econ-
omy and make roads safer for both mo-
torists and pedestrians. I am proud to 
have secured this funding for my com-
munity. 
We have more work to do to get an 
infrastructure package finalized, sent 
to the President’s desk, and signed into 
law. Our country simply cannot wait 
any longer, but I am proud to support 
the INVEST Act and to get us one step 
closer to that goal. 
f 
REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 18, NO 
TAXPAYER FUNDING FOR ABOR-
TION ACT 
(Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. 
Fifty million, Madam Speaker. The 
WHO estimates that 50 million abor-
tions are performed each year. It is a 
soul-rending number. 
Of course, abortion is a deeply divi-
sive legal, political, and moral dispute, 
but despite that fact, for 45 years, this 
body has been able to come together to 
accept the powerful message of the 
Hyde amendment, that taxpayer fund-
ing should never be used for abortion. 
When I think about what we can do 
together, that is a powerful message. It 
is in that spirit that I ask unanimous 
consent that the relevant committees 
be discharged from any further consid-
eration of H.R. 18, the No Taxpayer 
Funding for Abortion Act, and I ask for 
its immediate consideration by this 
House. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. As the 
Chair has previously advised, the re-
quest cannot be entertained absent ap-
propriate clearance. 
f 
BOLD ACTION ON CLIMATE CRISIS 
(Ms. BONAMICI asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. BONAMICI. Madam Speaker, 1 
year ago today, I joined my colleagues 
on the Select Committee on the Cli-
mate Crisis and we released our bold, 
comprehensive, science-based climate 
action plan. Our plan is a roadmap for 
solving the climate crisis, and I am 
thrilled that we are advancing many of 
its provisions this week as part of the 
INVEST in America Act. 
The transportation sector is the larg-
est source of energy-related carbon di-
oxide emissions in the country, and the 
pollution 
disproportionately 
affects 
low-income communities and commu-
nities of color. We must take bold ac-
tion to mitigate the climate crisis, and 
that includes advancing the INVEST in 
America Act. 
This bill would help decarbonize our 
transportation sector by investing in 
electric vehicle charging infrastruc-
ture, zero-emission buses, and transit. 
It will increase the resilience of our 
communities 
by 
strengthening 
predisaster 
mitigation 
efforts, 
sup-
porting the use of natural infrastruc-
ture, and restoring fish passages. And 
importantly, this bill also invests in 
the people who will rebuild our Na-
tion’s infrastructure. 
By passing the INVEST in America 
Act, we can protect our planet, create 
good-paying jobs, and truly begin to 
build back better. I thank Chairs CAS-
TOR, DEFAZIO, and PALLONE for their 
leadership. 
f 
SKYROCKETING VIOLENT CRIME 
(Mr. KELLER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, in 
large cities across America, violent 
crime rates are skyrocketing. At the 
same time, many of our Democrat col-
leagues are leading dangerous calls to 
defund the police and take cops off the 
streets. 
I can’t believe this needs to be said, 
but demonizing law enforcement will 
not make our streets safer. This kind 
of rhetoric makes it more difficult for 
police officers to do their jobs and 
harder for local departments to attract 
new officers. 
Just look at the cities which are ex-
periencing the largest spikes in violent 
crime. Homicides are up 533 percent in 
Portland, 58 percent in Atlanta, 37 per-
cent in Philadelphia, and 22 percent in 
Los Angeles. Each of these cities has 
embraced the same antipolice rhetoric 
that we have heard from Democrats in 
this very Chamber. Now, in a bizarre 
twist of logic, Democrats are trying to 
shift the blame to Republicans. 
The only way to solve this problem is 
to reestablish respect for law enforce-
ment and make sure they have the sup-
port and resources needed to protect 
themselves and our communities. 
f 
TIME TO STEP UP 
(Mr. CARTWRIGHT asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, 
I am thrilled that, this week, we bring 
up the INVEST in America Act, part of 
Joe Biden’s American Jobs Plan, some-
thing that we have been waiting for for 
many years. 
We have had infrastructure week 
after infrastructure week. We actually 
have a real one this week because we 
will be voting on the INVEST in Amer-
ica Act, something that will invest $700 
billion into America’s roads, bridges, 
tunnels, rail systems, water systems, 
and sewer systems, things that the 
Greatest Generation handed down to 
us. They came back from World War II 
after all the suffering and all the 
losses, and they sucked it up and actu-
ally contributed more. 
All of these investments in American 
infrastructure 
that 
happened 
after 
World 
War 
II, 
we 
have 
been 
disinvesting in those things. It is time 
for us to step up to the plate and invest 
in America with the INVEST in Amer-
ica Act. 
Let’s get it done, and let’s do it on a 
bipartisan basis. We all need to invest 
in our great Nation. 
f 
REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 18, NO 
TAXPAYER FUNDING FOR ABOR-
TION ACT 
(Mr. ALLEN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, H.R. 18 
must be immediately brought to the 
House floor for a vote. 
The No Taxpayer Funding for Abor-
tion Act would make the Hyde amend-
ment and other current abortion fund-
ing prohibitions permanent and gov-
ernmentwide.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3313 
June 30, 2021 
The Hyde amendment was passed in 
1976 and has shared bipartisan support 
for over four decades, while saving at 
least 2.4 million lives. But, now, my 
Democrat colleagues want to break 
with precedent and pave the way for 
taxpayer-funded abortions. 
This is wrong. It is in direct opposi-
tion to God’s word and the will of the 
American people. 
Psalm 139:13 is clear: ‘‘For You 
formed my inward parts; You knitted 
me together in my mother’s womb. I 
praise You, for I am fearfully and won-
derfully made.’’ 
Polling shows that 60 percent of 
Americans oppose taxpayer funding of 
abortion. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Committees on En-
ergy and Commerce, Ways and Means, 
and the Judiciary be discharged from 
further consideration of H.R. 18, and 
ask for its immediate consideration in 
the House. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. As the 
Chair has previously advised, the re-
quest cannot be entertained absent ap-
propriate clearance. 
f 
b 1215 
NOW IS THE TIME TO INVEST IN 
AMERICA 
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I rise in support of the IN-
VEST in America Act. 
This bill makes long overdue invest-
ments in the Nation building here at 
home and would deliver for my commu-
nity in Buffalo and western New York. 
It includes funding to convert the 
historic DL&W train station into a 
multiuse transportation hub. It sup-
ports the transition of a North Tona-
wanda highway near the Erie Canal 
into a walkable neighborhood. And it 
will transform an abandoned rail line 
in Buffalo into the vibrant Riverline 
trail. 
The INVEST in America Act will add 
more than $400 million in annual fund-
ing to New York to fix bridges and 
roads, an increase of over 30 percent. 
This bill does not, however, fix neigh-
borhoods destroyed by highway build-
ing in the decade of the 1950s. We need 
to do more to restore those commu-
nities in those neighborhoods that were 
destroyed many years ago. 
Now is the time to invest in America. 
f 
IMMEDIATE 
ACTION 
MUST 
BE 
TAKEN TO PROTECT AMERICA’S 
INFRASTRUCTURE AGAINST OUR 
ADVERSARIES 
(Mr. STEIL asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. STEIL. Madam Speaker, bol-
stering 
our 
infrastructure 
against 
cyberattacks and ransomware attacks 
is an issue that concerns every Amer-
ican. It is not Republican or Democrat, 
liberal or conservative. 
As we have seen from the recent Co-
lonial Pipeline hack and the shutdown 
of the world’s largest beef supplier, 
JBS, there are alarming cybersecurity 
weaknesses in America’s critical infra-
structure. 
Immediate action must be taken to 
protect 
America’s 
infrastructure 
against our adversaries. That is why we 
must pass my amendment to the sur-
face transportation bill. 
My proposal is simple. It is focused. 
It does not grow the size of the Federal 
Government. 
My amendment requires the GAO, 
the Government Accountability Office, 
to study the vulnerabilities within our 
transportation 
system 
to 
combat 
cyberattacks. 
This study will show us and accu-
rately allow us to plan, invest, and put 
forth 
policies 
that 
address 
our 
susceptibilities to future threats. 
I thank my colleagues from Massa-
chusetts and Pennsylvania for joining 
me in this effort, and I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this amend-
ment. 
f 
AMERICANS DESERVE BETTER 
(Mrs. DINGELL asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, this 
past weekend and early this week, the 
people of Michigan’s southeast area in 
the Twelfth District have experienced 
devastating floods. More than 7 inches 
fell on my hometown of Dearborn in a 
few hours. 
But it is not new for Michiganians. 
We keep experiencing these once-in-a- 
lifetime storms every year. But that 
doesn’t make it any different when 
your basements are flooded, family 
photos are ruined, carpets are soaked, 
cars can’t operate, water is not run-
ning, and the power is out. 
We have to do something. Our Na-
tion’s infrastructure is crumbling, and 
the American people deserve better. 
We need to invest in our infrastruc-
ture to make communities more resil-
ient to the impacts of the climate cri-
sis. 
On Saturday, I sent a letter to the 
President urging immediate FEMA as-
sistance to our communities. I have 
asked the Army Corps of Engineers to 
begin a study to tell us what we have 
to do. 
My constituents are dealing with so 
much damage and are in immediate 
need of essential resources. We are fo-
cused on doing everything we can to 
coordinate with all to help our commu-
nities. We just wish we could send the 
West some of our water. 
f 
WE ARE FOREVER INDEBTED TO 
OUR VETERANS 
(Mr. BOST asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
celebrate the men and women who have 
proudly safeguarded the American way 
of life since 1776. 
Generations of veterans have pro-
tected our homeland and its principles 
against all enemies. 
These everyday American heroes are 
willing to give their lives to ensure a 
better tomorrow for our children and 
grandchildren. 
We are forever indebted to them. 
To the over 19 million veterans and 
1.5 million Active Duty service per-
sonnel who hail from every corner of 
our Nation, we say thank you. 
To the military families whose loved 
ones took their last breath in defense 
of tyranny, we will never forget the 
sacrifices. 
This Independence Day, I will be 
thanking them, and I hope you will be 
as well. 
May God continue to bless this great 
United States of America. 
f 
RECOGNIZING THE 60TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE NORTH CAROLINA 
SWEET POTATO COMMISSION 
(Mr. BUTTERFIELD asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize the 60th 
anniversary of the North Carolina 
Sweet Potato Commission. 
The role of this commission is to sup-
port growers and increase sweet potato 
consumption. Their efforts have been 
tremendously effective as the popu-
larity of sweet potatoes has increased 
at home and especially abroad. 
North Carolina leads the Nation in 
sweet potato production and has done 
so for the last 50 years. There are over 
450 sweet potato farmers in North 
Carolina, and those farmers produce 
about 65 percent of all sweet potatoes 
grown throughout the country. 
I am proud to recognize and con-
gratulate the North Carolina Sweet Po-
tato Commission on its 60th anniver-
sary. I wish them another 60 years of 
continued success.

MEETING WITH PRESIDENT 
REUVEN RIVLIN 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina

Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, on Monday, I appre-
ciate meeting with Israeli President 
Reuven Rivlin at the U.S. Capitol. We 
are always grateful for the opportunity 
to reaffirm our commitment to Israel. 
Recently, Hamas terrorists in Gaza 
launched 4,500 Iranian-produced rock-
ets against Israeli families. America 
should always stand with our allies. 
The world is impressed by Israel as she 
defends herself with the Iron Dome. 
It is encouraging to see the successes 
of Iron Dome intercepting rockets

launched by Iranian-backed Hamas. 
The Iron Dome intercepted 90 percent 
of the rockets toward the civilian areas 
of Israel protecting Israeli families. 
Allies stand together. Thank you, 
President Rivlin, for your incredible 
insight on the murderous threat of 
Iran. Israel is vigilant in monitoring 
Iranian intercontinental ballistic mis-
sile development, which would deliver 
nuclear warheads against North Amer-
ica. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops, 
and we will never forget September the 
11th in the global war on terrorism. 
f 
A TAX CUT FOR WORKING-CLASS 
FAMILIES 
(Mr. PANETTA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, the 
child tax credit is a tax cut for work-
ing-class families. 
By passing the American Rescue 
Plan, we enhanced, and we advanced 
this tax cut, so that if you are a parent 
that works or a parent that cares for 
children, you will get a tax cut. 
We enhanced this tax cut so that per 
year working-class families will re-
ceive up to $3,600 for each child under 6 
and $3,000 for each child under 18. 
We advanced this tax cut so that 
working class families will get this 
benefit starting July 15. 
Now, in my district on the central 
coast of California, the tax cut will 
benefit over 150,000 children and lift 
15,000 children out of poverty. 
Working-class parents from the cen-
tral coast to the center of America can 
use this support to provide healthcare, 
childcare, and daycare for their kids so 
that those same parents can continue 
to work, or better yet, get right back 
into the workforce. 
Madam Speaker, the child tax credit 
will not only help us recover from the 
economic shutdowns of the pandemic, 
it is a tax cut that will lift parents out 
of poverty, reward working-class fami-
lies, and really represents what we 
stand for as a Nation. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF RUTH COX MIZELL 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor 
the life and legacy of Ruth Cox Mizell, 
a staple figure in the religious life of 
this Capitol for decades. 
Ruth served as campaign chair for 
George H.W. Bush, adviser to the U.S. 
Peace Corps under Presidents George 
H.W. Bush and Ronald Reagan, liaison 
for the Capitol Hill Prayer Partners, 
and was the spouse of Congressman 
Wilmer Mizell. 
She used her positions in and around 
the Capitol to passionately advocate 
for the power of Scripture and prayer 
on a personal and national level. 
Many bible studies and prayer groups 
take place on Capitol Hill and are at-
tended by a great number of my col-
leagues in Congress. And these groups 
honor Ruth’s legacy and serve as a re-
minder that faith is still alive in our 
Nation and certainly our Nation’s Cap-
itol. 
I will end with Ruth’s favorite scrip-
ture quote from Lamentations, chapter 
3, verses 22 and 23: ‘‘The steadfast love 
of the Lord never ceases, His mercies 
never come to an end; they are new 
every morning; great is thy faithful-
ness.’’ 
Ruth Mizell was a strong woman of 
faith and rests in the loving arms and 
comfort of her Savior. 
f 
SALUTING MARK SCHAUERTE 
(Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. 
KRISHNAMOORTHI. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise to salute my departing 
chief of staff, Mark Schauerte, for his 
devoted service to my office and to my 
constituents. 
Mark and I have been friends since 
the third grade, having grown up in Pe-
oria, Illinois, and today Mark is one of 
my most trusted advisers. His intel-
ligence, decency, and grit informed 
every initiative undertaken by my of-
fice. 
I will miss Mark’s daily presence and 
his warm sense of humor. My loss, how-
ever, is his family’s gain, and I am glad 
Mark’s lovely wife, Chris, and his son, 
Eddie, will now enjoy more of Mark’s 
time. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Mark for 
his dedicated, stalwart public service, 
and I thank him for his friendship of 
more than 40 years. I wish Mark great 
success in this new chapter of his life. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF LAMETTA 
WYNN 
(Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the life 
of an Iowa trailblazer from my district. 
LaMetta Wynn, Iowa’s first African- 
American female mayor, passed away 
last week at the age of 87 in Lincoln, 
Nebraska. 
LaMetta was an incredible woman 
who spent her life in service to her 
community of Clinton, Iowa. 
For 30 years, LaMetta worked during 
the day at Rock Island Arsenal and 
night shifts as a registered nurse. 
LaMetta’s service as an elected offi-
cial officially began when she ran for 
Clinton School Board in 1983. For 12 
years, LaMetta served on the school 
board, 
eventually 
becoming 
board 
president, all while raising 10 children. 
In 1995, LaMetta was elected mayor 
of Clinton, a position she held for 12 
years before retiring in 2007. 
In 1996, Newsweek picked LaMetta as 
one of the 25 most dynamic mayors in 
the country. 
Madam Speaker, I thank LaMetta for 
her service to the State of Iowa, and I 
will keep her loved ones in my prayers.

HONORING DAVID BROWN 
(Ms. CRAIG asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. CRAIG. Madam Speaker, it is 
with great pride that I come to the 
House floor today to honor my con-
stituent, David Brown, from Shakopee, 
Minnesota, who was recently awarded 
the Carnegie Medal for an extraor-
dinary act of heroism in our commu-
nity. 
On May 26, 2019, two men began to 
struggle after entering the frigid water 
of the Gull River. They were trying to 
save their friend who was having trou-
ble getting back to shore due to the 
strong current. 
Despite the risk to his own safety, 
David jumped into the water and suc-
cessfully brought both men back to the 
shore while another saved their friend. 
It is so important that this heroic 
act be recognized here on the floor of 
the U.S. House of Representatives, and 
it is my honor to do so. 
Madam Speaker, I thank David for 
his outstanding commitment to our 
community and his life-saving action.

WISHING THE MISSISSIPPI 
BULLDOGS GOOD LUCK 
(Mr. GUEST asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. GUEST. Madam Speaker, tonight 
the eyes of the Nation will be on TD 
Ameritrade Park in Omaha, Nebraska, 
as the Mississippi State Bulldogs face 
the Vanderbilt Commodores to deter-
mine who will be crowned the national 
champion in NCAA Baseball. 
Mississippi State will not only be 
playing for their fellow students, the 
faculty, and alumni, but also for our 
great State as they seek to bring home 
the first Division 1 National Baseball 
Championship in Mississippi history. 
Led by the offense of Tanner Allen, 
Rowdey Jordan, and Kamren James 
and the pitching of Will Bednar and 
Landon Sims, this group of athletes 
has brought life and excitement back 
to the people of Mississippi in the wake 
of a deadly pandemic. 
We could not be prouder of these 
young men and all that they have ac-
complished. Tonight, I and the entire 
State of Mississippi will be hanging on 
every pitch of this winner-take-all 
game at the College World Series. 
Good luck and Hail State.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3315 
June 30, 2021 
Ms. BROWNLEY. Madam Speaker, 
this week, the House will consider the 
INVEST in America Act. 
This bill is a critical and trans-
formative 
component 
of 
President 
Biden’s bold action plan to invest in 
our Nation’s infrastructure while cre-
ating good-paying American jobs and 
rebuilding our economy as we continue 
to navigate through the pandemic. 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased the bill 
includes several of my provisions that 
make significant investments in build-
ing resilient infrastructure to with-
stand the impacts of climate change, 
including wildfires and floods, while at 
the same time putting the U.S. on a 
path to achieving zero emissions in the 
transportation sector. 
The INVEST in America Act provides 
us an opportunity to fix our country’s 
crumbling infrastructure while ensur-
ing economic prosperity for America’s 
workers and their families. 
I am committed to continuing to 
work with President Biden and all my 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle to 
ensure these historic investments in 
our future come to fruition now. 
This is our moment. 
f 
MOURNING THE LOSS OF OFFICER 
KEVIN APPLE 
(Mr. WOMACK asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, it is 
with a heavy heart that I rise today. 
Arkansas lost one of its finest over 
the weekend. Pea Ridge Police Officer 
Kevin Apple was tragically killed in 
the line of duty while working to ap-
prehend two suspects. When he ap-
proached the suspects’ vehicle, he did 
what professional law enforcement offi-
cers do. He didn’t shy away from the 
threat. He confronted it. And in so 
doing, he gave his life for his commu-
nity. 
It reminds us of the supreme courage 
displayed by the men and women in 
uniform and the growing dangers they 
face each and every day. Through his 
leadership, bravery, and selfless dedica-
tion, Officer Apple exemplified the best 
our State has to offer. 
For more than 20 years, he nobly 
served in law enforcement. He was a 
protector and demonstrated the prin-
cipled integrity the badge requires. 
This heart for service was at the core 
of his character. Past his uniform, he 
was known as a good neighbor who was 
always willing to help others. 
Arkansas will never forget his serv-
ice. I join Mayor Jackie Crabtree and 
Police Chief Lynn Hahn; his mother, 
Dalene 
Hart; 
stepfather, 
Richard 
White; and brother, Kyle Hart, in 
mourning his loss. 
The Third District of Arkansas was 
blessed to have such a dedicated hero 
keeping us safe. We will always keep 
his memory alive. 
AMENDMENTS 87 AND 89 TO THE 
INVEST IN AMERICA ACT 
(Ms. CASTOR of Florida asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Madam 
Speaker, there is good news. The Con-
gress intends to invest in America 
through passage of a landmark surface 
transportation 
and 
infrastructure 
package. This is what President Biden 
challenged us to do, and we will follow 
through. 
It also comes one year after the 
House Select Committee on the Cli-
mate 
Crisis 
made 
landmark 
rec-
ommendations to solve the climate cri-
sis and expand clean energy through a 
clean energy action plan to cut green-
house gas pollution, to reach net zero 
as soon as possible, follow the science, 
improve our health, and make our com-
munities more resilient to costly cli-
mate fuel disasters. 
Madam Speaker, over the past year, 
we 
have 
already 
passed 
250 
rec-
ommendations here in the House and 
turned 100 of them into law. But now 
we are going to build on that progress 
through the INVEST in America Act. 
It is the most climate-forward trans-
portation bill in the history of the Con-
gress with record investment in public 
transit and rail; investments to make 
roads 
and 
bridges 
more 
resilient; 
record investment in electric vehicle 
charging stations, pedestrian and bicy-
cle trails; progress on environmental 
justice, clean air, and clean water. 
This is good news, indeed. 
f 
MANAGING OUR FORESTS 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, rad-
ical 
environmentalists 
have 
weaponized the Endangered Species 
Act and the National Environmental 
Policy Act, known as NEPA, and are 
using frivolous lawsuits to block near-
ly every management project or sal-
vage sale after fire that the U.S. Forest 
Service proposes. 
This has helped result in over 68 mil-
lion acres of forest land burned in the 
last decade and over 10 million acres 
just in 2020 alone. 
I am pleased to see President Biden 
today is speaking about how to address 
wildfires. One important component I 
hope he will look into and help rectify 
is we desperately need to rectify the 
litigation and the amount of stoppage 
of forest management that is the result 
of environmental groups. 
These groups have worked very hard 
to advance the false scenario that cli-
mate change is somehow responsible 
for the increasing vulnerability of for-
ests. This is flatout false. The truth is 
that the decline of responsible timber 
harvesting and the lack of active man-
agement are undeniably the real cul-
prits. 
In California, most forest types his-
torically had, in the past, about 64 
trees per acre. They now sit at an aver-
age of over 300 trees per acre. Indeed, 
too much inventory. 
We need to get back to basics and 
manage our forests and help prevent 
this fire problem. 
f 
INVEST IN AMERICA ACT 
(Mrs. LURIA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mrs. LURIA. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the INVEST in 
America Act. 
I am pleased that this bill includes 
funding for projects that are critical to 
our community in coastal Virginia. 
The parallel Chesapeake Bay Bridge- 
Tunnel will expand to four lanes, will 
make the roads safer, and reduce traf-
fic. Updating Tidewater Drive in Nor-
folk will facilitate access to Norfolk 
Naval Station, the world’s largest 
Navy base. 
The funding will create a much-need-
ed evacuation route for the Sandbridge 
community and Virginia Beach in the 
event of flooding or extreme weather, 
which happens more frequently due to 
climate change. 
This bill will also fund the replace-
ment of aging buses that serve Hamp-
ton Roads Transit. 
Madam Speaker, finally, the INVEST 
in America Act will fund planning for 
the Craney Island Marine Terminal, 
connecting Route 164 with the Com-
monwealth Railway that services the 
Port of Virginia, which is responsible 
for one in nine jobs in the Common-
wealth. 
Members of Congress must be respon-
sible stewards of taxpayer dollars, and 
I advocated for these projects that will 
support our constituents. Investing in 
infrastructure strengthens the back-
bone of our economy, keeps America 
running, and puts a down payment on 
the future. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to join me in voting for these 
critical projects. 
f 
FAIR REPAIR ACT 
(Mr. MORELLE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. 
MORELLE. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
today, I rise in support of a simple con-
cept: A consumer’s right to repair the 
goods they own. 
For too long, large corporations have 
used embedded technology to prevent 
small business owners and everyday 
Americans from repairing their own 
equipment. 
This 
needs 
to 
change, 
which is why I am proud to introduce 
the Fair Repair Act to put power back 
in the hands of consumers where it be-
longs. 
The concept behind this is as old as it 
is simple: if you own something, you 
own all of it, including the right to re-
pair it.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3316 
June 30, 2021 
This pandemic has magnified our 
need to be self-reliant and have the 
ability to repair our own devices, espe-
cially when large retailers are forced 
to shutter. 
My bill will guarantee consumers and 
small businesses that right by requir-
ing manufacturers to make diagnostic 
repair information, parts, and tools 
readily available rather than forcing 
individuals to go to an original equip-
ment manufacturer. 
This commonsense legislation will 
help make technology repairs more ac-
cessible and affordable for items from 
cell phones to laptops to farm equip-
ment. 
Madam Speaker, I look forward to 
working with my colleagues to bring 
this legislation to the floor and finally 
give individuals the autonomy they de-
serve.

PROVIDING FOR FURTHER CONSID-
ERATION OF H.R. 3684, INVEST-
ING IN A NEW VISION FOR THE 
ENVIRONMENT 
AND 
SURFACE 
TRANSPORTATION 
IN 
AMERICA 
ACT; AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, 
by direction of the Committee on

place it appears and inserting (in each in-
stance) ‘‘July 30, 2021’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from California is recognized 
for 1 hour. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, 
for the purpose of debate only, I yield 
the customary 30 minutes to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER), pending which I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
During consideration of this resolu-
tion, all time yielded is for the purpose 
of debate only. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers be given 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, 
on Tuesday, the Committee on Rules 
met and reported a rule, House Resolu-
tion 508, to provide for further consid-
eration of H.R. 3684, the INVEST in 
America Act under a structured rule. 
The rule makes in order 149 amend-
ments and provides en bloc authority 
to the chair of the Committee on 
Transportation and Infrastructure. 
The rule also allows for consideration 
of concurrent resolutions providing for 
adjournment during the month of July, 
and provides that the provisions of sec-
tion 202 of the National Emergencies 
Act shall not apply for the remainder 
of the 117th Congress to a joint resolu-
tion terminating the national emer-
gency declared by the President on 
March 13, 2020. 
Lastly, the rule provides for recess 
instructions, suspension authority, and 
same-day authority through July 30, 
2021. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
our 
roads 
and 
bridges are crumbling before our eyes, 
and our public transportation systems 
are suffering drastically from reduced 
ridership during the pandemic. With 
these challenges comes a great oppor-
tunity. Our country can use this 
unique 
once-in-a-generation 
oppor-
tunity to reimagine and rebuild our 
community 
in 
America’s 
transpor-
tation systems and build back better. 
As a former member of the California 
Air Resources Board and a former chair 
of both the State Assembly Transpor-
tation Committee and the State Senate 
Transportation 
Committee 
and 
a 
former member of the Bay Area’s MPO, 
I have spent my career focused on the 
transportation 
sector 
and 
reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions and other 
pollutants to help fight against climate 
change. 
b 1245 
In my 30 years of public service, 
never has the time been more ripe to 
seize this opportunity to reimagine and 
reinvest in America’s transportation 
infrastructure. 
The INVEST in America Act offers a 
new approach to Federal transpor-
tation policy by emphasizing fixing our 
existing roads and bridges first and 
making record investments in pas-
senger rail, public transit, cycling and 
walking infrastructure, and zero-emis-
sion options while creating safer, more 
connected communities for all Ameri-
cans. This bill would also help create 
millions of jobs that cannot be ex-
ported. 
Thanks to strong Buy American pro-
visions and labor protections, including 
Davis-Bacon, the work will be fueled by 
American workers, manufacturing, and 
ingenuity, with targeted investments 
in rural and underserved communities. 
Madam Speaker, our country badly 
needs the investments outlined in this 
bill. Over 40 percent of America’s roads 
are in poor or mediocre condition, ac-
cording to the American Society of 
Civil Engineers. In fact, our roads have 
a D rating, and American motorists are 
forced to pay over $1,000 every year in 
wasted time and fuel as a result of our 
failure to act. 
In my own State, California’s infra-
structure does not fare any better. We 
have a C-minus rating overall, with a D 
rating for roads and a C-minus for 
bridges and transit, in spite of Cali-
fornia voters voting over and over 
again to tax themselves to invest in 
our infrastructure. 
Not only is the problem of crumbling 
infrastructure a detriment to our econ-
omy, but it is dangerous to public safe-
ty. Over 36,000 Americans die on our 
Nation’s roadways every year. The IN-
VEST in America Act directs $343 bil-
lion to roads, bridges, and safety pro-
grams, with record levels of investment 
in walking and cycling infrastructure, 
complete streets planning and smarter 
road design, and safe routes to schools. 
This transformative bill also directs 
Federal investments in transit and rail 
and reimagines our national transpor-
tation policies. Public transit is essen-
tial to everyday living in communities 
across the country, providing access to 
jobs, 
schools, 
healthcare, 
and 
childcare. 
Currently, there is a $176 billion tran-
sit backlog, and transit ridership, of 
course, is declining because of COVID– 
19. These issues, if not addressed, stand 
to further increase congestion, hamper 
the economy, worsen air quality, and 
disproportionately affect underserved 
communities. 
The INVEST in America Act provides 
$109 billion for transit to create a safe 
and reliable transit system that en-
sures every American, including those

in economically disadvantaged and un-
derserved neighborhoods, can get to es-
sential services, as I have said, like 
jobs, healthcare, and childcare. 
Importantly, this effort takes every 
opportunity to meet the challenges of 
the climate crisis. Climate change is 
the defining challenge of our time, and 
transportation 
is 
the 
number 
one 
source of greenhouse gas emissions. 
The INVEST in America Act takes bold 
steps to build the clean infrastructure 
and transportation sector of the future 
by reforming existing programs and 
launching new initiatives to reduce 
carbon pollution. 
For example, it invests $8.3 billion in 
highway, transit, and rail projects that 
will reduce greenhouse gas emissions, 
and it holds States accountable for 
their performance by measuring annual 
progress. 
Moreover, under the Clean Corridors 
program, a program that I was proud to 
author, it invests $4 billion in electric 
vehicle charging and alternative fuel-
ing stations. This infrastructure along 
designated corridors will help reduce 
range anxiety and help America shift 
to the next generation of clean vehi-
cles. 
To further address climate change 
and equity, this bill increases funding 
and incentives for transit-oriented de-
velopment, ensuring that more Ameri-
cans have access to walkable and tran-
sit-supportive 
communities, 
thereby 
reducing vehicle miles traveled and 
greenhouse gas emissions and, most 
importantly, improving their quality 
of life and their ability to be at home 
with their family. 
Finally, this bill invests in safe 
drinking water infrastructure by re-
placing dangerous lead piping and 
treating PFAS in our water supply. It 
will also help ensure that all families 
can afford a safe and reliable water 
supply. 
Madam Speaker, we cannot allow 
this opportunity to slip through our 
fingers. Now is the time for trans-
formative investments in our transpor-
tation systems and our infrastructure 
to improve our roads, bridges, rail-
ways, and transit systems to support 
American workers, to address equity 
and environmental justice, and to fight 
boldly against the climate crisis. 
That is why I proudly support the IN-
VEST in America Act. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the distin-
guished gentleman from California for 
yielding me the customary 30 minutes, 
and I also want to say it is nice to see 
him on the floor in good and improving 
health. 
Madam Speaker, the rule before us 
today makes in order 149 amendments 
to H.R. 3684, House Democrats’ progres-
sive 
infrastructure 
wish 
list 
that 
prioritizes Green New Deal mandates 
above actual transportation needs. 
Sadly, only 18 percent of the amend-
ments made in order under this rule 
were offered by Republicans. Compare 
that with the FAST Act. The FAST 
Act was the last surface transportation 
reauthorization bill, which was signed 
into law back in 2015. 
Back then, Republicans controlled 
the House. Yet, 30 percent of the 
amendments 
made 
in 
order 
were 
amendments offered by Democrats. The 
bill itself was actually bipartisan, un-
like the bill we are debating today. 
And even with that bipartisan bill, Re-
publicans, when we were in charge, al-
lowed 30 percent of the amendments to 
come from Democrats. That is nearly 
double the amount that Democrats are 
allowing Republicans to offer today. 
Democrats went so far that they 
stripped out a Republican amendment 
that was actually agreed to in the 
Transportation Committee’s markup. 
It was agreed to by unanimous consent. 
Mr. GIMENEZ from Florida offered an 
amendment during the committee con-
sideration of this bill, H.R. 3684. Mr. 
GIMENEZ offered an amendment that 
would prohibit civil penalties in the 
bill from being used to publicly finance 
political campaigns. 
For example, under this amendment, 
civil penalties for violating rules on 
transporting animals could not have 
been used to contribute to a politi-
cian’s campaign coffers. It is actually 
unfathomable that the majority ac-
cepted that Republican amendment, an 
amendment that is good for trans-
parency and good for taxpayers, only 
to then strip it out in the Rules Com-
mittee print. 
Madam Speaker, compromise used to 
be when Republicans and Democrats 
came together to pass a bill that is ac-
tually bipartisan. That is compromise. 
Today, though, compromise is being 
defined as liberals and socialists com-
ing together to pass a partisan piece of 
legislation. 
During his inauguration, I sat there 
and listened to Joe Biden say: ‘‘With 
unity, we can do great things.’’ I don’t 
know if the House Democrats missed 
that memo or if they weren’t listening 
like I was at the inauguration. Or 
maybe Joe Biden was saying that unity 
is when liberal activist groups come to-
gether. 
With today’s rule, liberals are dou-
bling down on the partisan approach to 
government, and it is not just me say-
ing this. According to the majority’s 
own press release, this bill moves fur-
ther left than finding compromise. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to oppose this rule, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I 
look forward to continuing this dia-
logue respectfully. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
MORELLE), a very distinguished mem-
ber of the Rules Committee. 
Mr. MORELLE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my dear friend and fellow mem-
ber of the Rules Committee, Mr. 
DESAULNIER, for giving me the oppor-
tunity to speak for just a moment. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
the rule that would allow us to con-
sider the INVEST in America Act. 
This long-overdue infrastructure leg-
islation will prioritize direct Federal 
investments in roads, bridges, transit, 
and rail, while also leveraging modern 
and innovative approaches to reliable 
and sustainable infrastructure invest-
ments. 
As we continue our recovery from the 
pandemic and seek to revitalize our 
communities, we know an essential 
part of that is strengthening our local 
infrastructure. Modernizing our infra-
structure helps to meet growing mobil-
ity demands, create jobs, and grow the 
economy, all while creating stronger 
and more interconnected communities. 
I am thrilled that this legislative 
package lays the groundwork for major 
investments across the country while 
also 
supporting 
opportunities 
to 
strengthen our local infrastructure 
through targeted priorities. 
My own community of Rochester, 
New York, will only grow stronger 
through the enactment of the INVEST 
in America Act, and I look forward to 
seeing this critical legislation passed 
into law. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to have 
helped move this transformative bill 
forward, and I urge my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle to vote in favor 
of the rule and the underlying bill. And 
I call on our partners in the Senate to 
join us in making this investment a re-
ality. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman 
DEFAZIO for his tireless work on this 
effort, 
and 
my 
dear 
friend, 
Mr. 
DESAULNIER, for yielding time. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, my good friend from 
New York talked about investment, 
but I would like to remind my liberal 
colleagues that this bill ties $1 out of 
every $2 into Green New Deal man-
dates. And the infrastructure that is 
being talked about in some parts of 
this bill is actually defined as art. 
So let’s just keep the facts in per-
spective and remember that these 
words actually do have meaning. 
Madam Speaker, included in today’s 
rule is a provision that prevents con-
sideration of joint resolutions termi-
nating COVID–19 mandates. 
Right now, America is the most 
COVID-resilient country in the world. 
We are the most resilient in the world, 
thanks to President Trump and Oper-
ation Warp Speed. It is time for us to 
return to normal because President 
Trump, by putting science over polit-
ical science, gave us the ability to re-
turn to normal. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Arizona 
(Mr. 
GOSAR) to discuss his resolution that 
would terminate the COVID–19 emer-
gency mandates. 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Pennsylvania for 
yielding.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3318 
June 30, 2021 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in oppo-
sition to the rule. 
While I do not support the legislation 
this rule brings up, that is not the 
main reason for my objection. I am op-
posed to the rule before us because pro-
vision 6 in the rule turns off section 202 
of the National Emergencies Act relat-
ing to the COVID–19 national emer-
gency for the remainder of the 117th 
Congress. 
What this line really does is kill a 
joint resolution I introduced 2 weeks 
ago in accordance with the National 
Emergencies Act. The framers of this 
act wrote the law to inject congres-
sional oversight to rein in the emer-
gency powers codified into U.S. law 
that give the President additional pow-
ers in times of declared emergency. 
Section 202 outlined the process 
where, 6 months after an emergency is 
declared, Congress meets to consider a 
joint resolution of termination, forcing 
the debate on the necessity of con-
tinuing the national emergency and 
correlating powers given to the Presi-
dent. 
Over a year later, Congress has never 
met to debate the merit of the COVID– 
19 declared emergency, even after the 
President extended the emergency an-
other year. This is because Congress 
has a poor track record in enforcing 
our emergency duties. 
In fact, there are over 30 active emer-
gencies on the books dating back to 
the 
Carter 
administration—hardly 
emergencies, I take it—few of which 
this body has ever met to debate the 
merit of the emergency and the powers 
it invokes. 
With nationwide cases falling, vac-
cine rates rising, mask mandates being 
lifted, and States reopening with no ca-
pacity limits, it would seem appro-
priate to debate whether or not this 
Nation is truly in a state of emergency, 
not to mention, once again, the man-
dated duties of oversight of the execu-
tive branch. 
Therefore, I introduced H.J. Res. 52 
to have this debate. I did this because 
the first joint resolution I introduced 
was killed in a prior rule. 
b 1300 
Now the majority is killing debate on 
the COVID emergency for the entire 
117th Congress unless the majority 
leadership determines we can have this 
debate. I guess that is not part of the 
law. 
This completely goes against the ex-
plicit expedited procedure in the law 
providing for quick and efficient over-
sight. This is tyranny of the majority 
at its finest. 
Why must we continue to neglect our 
duties? 
Why must we continue the congres-
sional track record of being asleep at 
the wheel and yielding more power to 
the executive? 
The National Emergencies Act man-
dates that we have this debate, and 
that is all my joint resolution does—re-
quire the people’s Representatives to 
meet, debate, and vote on a termi-
nation resolution of the COVID emer-
gency powers in accordance with the 
law. 
Madam Speaker, you may feel that 
we are still in an emergency. You may 
still feel COVID is a threat but not a 
national emergency, or you may feel 
the national emergency is over. How-
ever you feel, I am simply asking that 
we engage in the debate as the law re-
quires. 
Using the National Emergencies Act, 
the executive has requested powers 
outside the scope of Article II. As this 
declared emergency continues, the ex-
ecutive could request even more. This 
body should debate on whether to rein 
in the extraordinary powers, especially 
among the backdrop of a radically dif-
ferent COVID situation in this Nation. 
In a time when this body is trying to 
reassert its claim on Article I author-
ization, simple oversight like this re-
stores trust. Trust is a series of prom-
ises kept with the citizens of this great 
Nation. Imagine that, trust, just by 
following the definitions and the law. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this rule. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank my 
colleague from Pennsylvania on his 
kind observation about my own per-
sonal health. 
Just in regards to this debate, as 
somebody who went into the ICU on 
the first date in the State of California 
that the Governor of California actu-
ally required shelter in place, and I was 
then put on a ventilator for 4 weeks at 
the same time that the country was 
dealing with this pandemic, maybe I 
have a little unique perspective. 
So evidence-based research maybe is 
in the mind of the beholder. I trust my 
doctors. I know they are human, and I 
know evidence-based research is the 
reason I stand here in front of you, 
Madam Speaker, by following the doc-
tors. 
I think of what the Speaker is doing 
and what the President is doing, and 
that is following evidence-based re-
search 
and 
statistically 
protecting 
Americans. We know if Americans get 
vaccinated, we know if we are sensitive 
to distances around us and masking, 
we still have challenges. And for some-
body like myself, who has an under-
lying health condition, I am particu-
larly sensitive to this. Not everybody 
is in the same position vis-a-vis their 
medical risks. 
So with all due respect, the debate is 
always a good one, but from my per-
spective I wish that people would keep 
in mind that this pandemic is not done 
until the evidence-based research indi-
cates that it is done. I know everybody 
wants to get back to normal. I know I 
do too, as well, but I would like to be 
able to enjoy this wonderful existence 
that we all are allowed to do as well. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the distinguished gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Mrs. DINGELL). 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my colleague for yielding, and I 
share the bipartisan happiness at see-
ing his smiling face and good health 
back. 
I rise in support of the rule and the 
underlying bill, H.R. 3684, the INVEST 
in America Act. 
We need to invest in the infrastruc-
ture of the future, not the past. This 
surface transportation reauthorization 
legislation, along with the important 
package of water infrastructure and as-
sistance outlined in this bill will make 
a meaningful and bold difference in the 
lives of Americans. 
I am proud to have authored a num-
ber of provisions in this bill, but at the 
moment I want to specifically address 
the water package that is in the bill, 
thanks to the tireless work of the En-
ergy and Commerce Committee. 
Water is a human right that no one 
should be denied. In this pandemic, the 
very first instructions before we ever 
wore masks, we told people to wash 
your hands. Yet, so many Americans 
didn’t have access to water because the 
water had been turned off. Imagine liv-
ing in this pandemic and not having 
sanitary conditions—water in a run-
ning bathroom. 
This bill includes legislation that I 
have authored with Representatives 
TLAIB
and 
BLUNT
ROCHESTER, 
the 
Water Debt Relief Act, that establishes 
a $4 billion residential emergency relief 
program through EPA for public water 
systems to forgive any debt incurred 
by struggling households since the 
start of the COVID–19 pandemic. Many 
are in our frontline communities. It 
would also prevent water systems from 
cutting off any of these households 
from clean water. People have a right 
to be able to wash their hands. 
Additionally, it includes bipartisan 
legislation that I have co-led with Rep-
resentatives BLUNT ROCHESTER, KATKO, 
and TLAIB that would establish a per-
manent, long-term water assistance 
program to address the growing water 
debt crisis we have. 
I thank the leadership of Chairman 
DEFAZIO and Chairman PALLONE, and I 
urge my colleagues to support this. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, water is certainly 
infrastructure. What is not is art. 
While the majority places restrictions 
on building roads—again, roads actu-
ally are infrastructure. While there are 
restrictions on roads, there is no re-
striction on using Federal 
transit 
money for art. Essentially, this bill de-
fines art as infrastructure. 
Let’s talk more about roads which 
are, as I define, actually infrastruc-
ture. 
The so-called infrastructure bill ac-
tually bans construction of new roads. 
The bill also prioritizes urban areas at 
the expense of rural and suburban com-
munities. There are massive increases 
in transit and rail funding, yet, again, 
there are restrictions on the building

of 
roads—the 
transportation 
mode 
rural Americans use the most. 
Madam Speaker, since his first day in 
office, President Biden has declared a 
war on blue-collar workers. He has also 
declared a war on the American energy 
industry. Thanks to liberal Democrats 
and the fantasy of the Green New Deal, 
energy costs for Americans are sky-
rocketing. It is evident at the gas 
pump where prices heading into the 
Fourth of July weekend are the highest 
they have been since 2014. 
Now, Republicans and conservatives 
believe that America should be energy 
independent. That is good for American 
families, it is good for the economy, 
and it is certainly good for national se-
curity. 
That is why, if we defeat the previous 
question, I will personally offer an 
amendment to the rule to immediately 
consider Congressman JEFF DUNCAN’s 
Protecting American Energy Produc-
tion Act. 
This legislation, which I am a proud 
cosponsor of, would prohibit the Presi-
dent from declaring a moratorium on 
fracking 
without 
congressional 
ap-
proval. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to insert the text of my 
amendment into the RECORD, along 
with any extraneous material, imme-
diately prior to the vote on the pre-
vious question. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gen-
tleman from South Carolina (Mr. DUN-
CAN), who is here to explain this 
amendment and is the bill’s author and 
my good friend. 
Mr. DUNCAN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for the time. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition 
to the previous question, so that we 
can amend the rule to immediately 
consider H.R. 751, the Protecting Amer-
ican Energy Production Act. 
Now, my bill is straightforward. It 
prohibits the President from declaring 
a moratorium on the use of hydraulic 
fracturing, or fracking, unless Congress 
authorizes the moratorium. 
It further expresses the sense of Con-
gress that States should maintain au-
thority for the regulation of oil and 
natural gas production on State and 
private lands. That is how it has been 
done for decades. 
President Biden and House Demo-
crats have wasted no time in this Con-
gress, and since his administration 
began, undermining American energy 
independence. They have signaled that 
they will use any tool necessary to end 
fossil fuel production in the United 
States. 
In fact, Democrats keep rushing to 
President Biden’s defense, claiming he 
never supported a fracking ban, which 
is simply not true. When he was asked 
by a debate moderator during the Pres-
idential debates in 2019 if there was any 
place for fossil fuels in his administra-
tion, this is what Senator Biden, now- 
President Biden, actually said: ‘‘No. We 
would work it out. We would make sure 
it’s eliminated.’’ 
He was talking about fossil fuels. 
How is this policy working out for 
the American people at the pump? 
They are seeing higher prices for gas-
oline, and as they are getting ready to 
travel over the holidays and go on va-
cation, they are paying more at the 
pump. That is less money to spend on 
their family for family vacation during 
the holiday this summer. That is what 
bad policy gets you, Madam Speaker. 
President Biden has already made 
good on his promises to revoke the 
Keystone XL permit, ultimately result-
ing in its cancelation and the loss of 
thousands of American and Canadian 
jobs—thousands of jobs. He also has 
halted all new Federal oil and gas 
leases. There is no telling which en-
ergy-killing promise he will fulfill next 
as he continues his war against Amer-
ican energy. 
Instead of prioritizing American jobs 
and American energy, President Biden 
and the Democrats would rather ap-
pease the backwards logic of the rad-
ical environmental left. I have no other 
way to say it. 
They would rather make us weaker 
and more reliant on energy from our 
foreign adversaries at a time when we 
are energy independent and we are ac-
tually exporting oil and gas. 
The adversaries that they are sup-
porting have no regard for the environ-
mental standards that we all push in 
this country. 
The INVEST in America Act—or 
more accurately titled, the green new 
deal and inflation transportation act— 
is a continuation of this America-last 
agenda. One out of every $2 spent in 
this bill is tied up in Green New Deal 
priorities. Madam Speaker, one out of 
every $2 is tied up in Green New Deal 
priorities. 
It is ironic that while President 
Biden has no problem killing American 
energy 
projects 
and 
jobs, 
he 
is 
greenlighting at the same time Russian 
energy projects, like the Nord Stream 
II Pipeline that is going to bring gas 
into Europe and give Vladimir Putin 
even more control to manipulate poli-
tics in Europe. 
President Biden doesn’t think twice 
before waiving sanctions on a Russian 
company 
and 
friend 
of 
Vladimir 
Putin’s. 
Undercutting American energy pro-
duction is a handout to Vladimir Putin 
and opens doors for Russia to influence 
operations across Europe and even in 
the United States. 
New England doesn’t have a pipeline 
for natural gas to come up there. They 
bring an LNG ship in from Russia that 
provides natural gas to the New Eng-
land States—Russian, not American 
gas. 
Colonial Pipeline’s cyberattack is 
the most recent reminder of this long-
standing effort by the Russians. Putin 
will continue to use energy as a polit-
ical weapon, and through policies like 
the partisan Green New Deal infra-
structure package, Democrats will con-
tinue to help Russia, not American 
families—they are paying more at the 
pump this summer—Russia, Vladimir 
Putin. Putin will continue to use those 
policies. 
The infrastructure policies we should 
be focused on are hardening our energy 
infrastructure to protect against these 
attacks, but the INVEST in America 
Act doesn’t do this. 
It instead remakes the entire energy 
market, 
squeezes 
fossil 
fuels, 
and 
makes the grid far more vulnerable to 
attacks. 
The INVEST in America Act puts 
radical climate and Green New Deal 
priorities 
above 
the 
infrastructure 
needs of the Nation. 
It creates more roadblocks for trans-
porting clean-burning LNG, gives more 
money to EV charging stations than to 
the entire Rebuild Rural America 
grant program, and it fails to include 
any regulatory reforms that plague in-
frastructure projects. 
My goodness, instead of voting on a 
$548 billion Green New Deal-disguised 
infrastructure bill, we should be pro-
tecting American energy production 
and American energy jobs here in the 
United States. 
Not long ago, the U.S. depended on 
OPEC for much of our oil supply. We 
now lead the world in oil and gas pro-
duction as well as emission reduction. 
That is a fact that the left doesn’t 
want to acknowledge. We lead the 
world in emissions reduction. 
The Democrats refuse to acknowl-
edge this and recognize this. Instead, 
they want to surrender one of our 
greatest economic and strategic advan-
tages: our energy independence. As Ad-
miral Mike Mullen once said: ‘‘There is 
no national security without energy se-
curity.’’ 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield the gentleman from 
South Carolina such additional time as 
he may consume. 
Mr. DUNCAN. Listen to this, Madam 
Speaker, there is no national security 
without energy security. 
How true is that statement? 
This is all in the name of saving the 
climate. The reality is phasing out fos-
sil fuels in the United States won’t 
eliminate carbon emissions globally. 
Production will just happen someplace 
else, oftentimes in dirty production 
areas, because they don’t have the 
same regulations that we have so that 
the environment gets dirtier, along 
with the jobs and geopolitical leverage 
that we have when we export our en-
ergy. 
Democrats’ anti-fossil fuel agenda 
will have no effect on the climate. 
Eliminating fossil fuels will also under-
cut our own economic interests. On av-
erage, a Federal fracking ban will in-
crease household energy costs by $618 a 
year.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3320 
June 30, 2021 
Allowing President Biden to ban 
fracking will make all of this worse. 
Russia, China, and Iran stand ready to 
take advantage of us as we continue to 
pursue this self-inflicting harm. 
By prohibiting the President from 
banning fracking, we, in turn, safe-
guard our energy production, our na-
tional security, our geopolitical influ-
ence, and the livelihoods of Ameri-
cans—thousands 
of 
Americans—who 
have lost their job. 
At the end of the day, American citi-
zens—our constituents—pay less at the 
pump and for their household energy 
needs when we produce energy here in 
this country. That is a winning solu-
tion, and this bill that we are hoping to 
replace isn’t. 
So if President Biden wants to back 
up his buy America rhetoric, I have a 
question for him: 
Why not start right here? 
Let’s buy American energy. 
If he truly believes in buy America, 
then let’s buy American energy and 
support American energy jobs. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous 
question so that the House will imme-
diately consider this bill, put Ameri-
cans back to work, and protect our na-
tional energy security. 
b 1315 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Just briefly on the points that were 
just brought up. As somebody who rep-
resents a county that has four refin-
eries in it, those four refineries produce 
much of the refined CARB-certified 
fuel on the West Coast and in Cali-
fornia. Also, a county that is head-
quarters to the second largest energy 
company in the United States, Chev-
ron, this isn’t about ending the fossil 
fuel industry. 
It is about the transition from that 
energy source to a new, cleaner, renew-
able, alternative fuel energy source. It 
is about being independent and being 
mindful about what our global com-
petitors are doing; what the Chinese 
are doing to get ahead of us in this en-
ergy source. 
So with all due respect, as someone 
who knows the benefit and also the 
dangers and the opportunities to the 
fossil fuel industry, as we have experi-
enced it in this country, those four re-
fineries only employ people, as re-
quired by State statute, who have 
graduated from State-approved appren-
ticeship programs, the best apprentice-
ship programs in the world. Each one 
of those jobs have a multiplier of 14. 
We like those jobs. We want to keep 
those jobs. 
But we want to meet the reductions 
we have to have to be leaders in this 
country on climate reductions, and 
prepare for a future that isn’t depend-
ent on the fossil fuel industry; both for 
our public health, and our environ-
ment, and for our economy. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the distinguished gentleman from Or-
egon (Mr. BLUMENAUER). 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, 
I appreciate the gentleman’s courtesy. 
I came to Congress 25 years ago de-
termined that the Federal Government 
should be a better partner, working 
with our communities, making our 
families safer, healthier, and more eco-
nomically secure. 
I have traveled to over 200 commu-
nities, working with architects, land-
scape, engineers, local government, 
State government, transit, listening to 
their concerns about how we make the 
transportation system work better. 
I can say unequivocally that this leg-
islation that we are considering today 
reflects what America wants. There is 
a broad consensus that we can’t keep 
doing the same thing. 
We need to make sure that we build 
a low-carbon future; that it is equi-
table; that deals with the challenges 
that indiscriminate infrastructure in-
flicted on communities. I have an ex-
ample in my hometown, where a trans-
portation 
project, 
a 
freeway, 
just 
ripped through an African-American 
community, without the sense of what 
it was doing to people who weren’t in-
volved. 
Well, people don’t want to do that 
anymore, and they want to have a 
multi-modal solution. 
The nonsense that we hear from the 
other side, that somehow this will pro-
hibit construction of new roads, is not 
true. But what it does is emphasize fix-
ing it first and having plans that put 
the pieces together in a way that 
solves problems rather than creating 
new ones. 
Yes, we ought to pursue the bipar-
tisan agreement that the President has 
struck with our friends in the Senate. 
I think that is optimistic. But we need 
to reauthorize the Surface Transpor-
tation Act. And with the approach that 
has been offered by the administration 
and embodied in this legislation, we 
are cutting to the chase. 
The details here matter. $45 billion 
would be authorized to deal with the 
lead pipes that are poisoning our chil-
dren; 
streamlining 
drinking 
water 
standards. Yes, it deals with roads and 
bridges. It has transformational invest-
ments for transit, $109 billion, and at-
tention to rural and urban areas. Pas-
senger and freight rail, and triples 
funding for Amtrak. 
It is beyond just the numbers. It is 
how we put these pieces together. 
Madam Speaker, I cringe a little bit 
when I have my friends dismiss the no-
tions of a low-carbon future. I bring 
you greetings from Portland, Oregon, 
where we had three record-breaking 
116-degree temperatures in June. The 
Pacific Northwest is facing a climate 
catastrophe that, in no small measure, 
is due to the fact that we are not doing 
what we all could to have a low-carbon 
future. 
This legislation captures the mo-
ment. It invests in the future, not in 
the past. It is how we will heal divi-
sions, protect the planet, revitalize the 
economy, and pull America together. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
The gentleman from Oregon said that 
he ran for Congress to make everyday 
Americans more financially secure. If 
that is the case, this bill is not going 
to do any of that, and here is why. 
There is a little thing called inflation, 
which is a tax from an economic per-
spective. 
This bill’s massive price tag, which is 
just under $550 billion, that price tag 
relies heavily on deficit spending, 
which further fuels inflation and in-
creases the costs of goods, like food 
and gas, that everyday Americans 
need. That is the true cost—just one of 
the true costs of this bill, which will 
hurt blue-collar workers. 
Now, if you are a member of the 
Zoom class, if you are a woke yuppie 
that is staring at screens all day, not 
actually working for a living, well, you 
can take your $100,000-plus income and 
buy an electric vehicle. 
But let’s talk about electric vehicles. 
Although the gentleman from Oregon 
thinks they are the wave of the future, 
this bill provides $4 billion for electric 
vehicle charging stations, but only $1 
billion for the Rebuild Rural grant pro-
gram that helps people who are likely 
living in rural areas, making less than 
$100,000. 
And why I am focused on $100,000 is 
because 70 percent of electric car own-
ers earn at least $100,000 a year. Again, 
the electric vehicles are not going to 
do anything really for the environ-
ment, but it sounds good if you are a 
woke yuppie sitting at home. 
Further, this empowers China, which 
China is the world’s greatest polluter. 
If you take all the emissions of the 
United States, all of the EU, and 
Japan, added together, we still collec-
tively don’t emit more than China 
does. And we rely on China for 80 per-
cent of our critical minerals that we 
need to actually make an electronic 
vehicle. 
So, again, scoring cheap political 
points, hurting blue-collar workers, 
and doing zero to actually improve the 
environment. 
But talking about radical policies: 
Radical progressives, including Mem-
bers of this very body, have called for 
a Federal ban on fracking. Again, more 
of the war on blue-collar workers. 
So, apparently, Democrats and lib-
eral Progressives don’t care about 
American workers. These blue-collar 
workers, these guys that are working 
the oil and gas pads of southwestern 
Pennsylvania, they rely on fracking for 
jobs. In fact, a fracking ban would cost

They must not care. Democrats must 
not care about American families ei-
ther because household energy costs 
would increase over $600 per year, while 
household incomes would fall by $5,400 
a year annually.

June 30, 2021 
fracking ban would be to our State and 
national economy. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to 
the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. 
KELLER) to explain this. 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my colleague and co-Pennsylva-
nian for yielding to me. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition 
to the previous question so that we can 
amend the rule to immediately con-
sider H.R. 751, the Protecting American 
Energy Production Act, which would 
prevent the Biden administration from 
unilaterally imposing a moratorium on 
hydraulic fracturing. 
Pennsylvania is home to some of the 
most abundant energy and natural gas 
resources in the Nation, and our econ-
omy is proof of all the benefits that 
come with it. On any given day, up to 
10 percent of the Nation’s dry natural 
gas comes out of Pennsylvania’s 12th 
Congressional District. 
Energy producers have been critical 
partners in central and northeastern 
Pennsylvania, investing in local com-
munities, colleges, generating count-
less job opportunities, and preparing 
the next generation of workers for in- 
demand careers. 
However, President Biden has made 
it clear that he is no friend of Amer-
ican energy or the workers employed 
by this industry. He has canceled the 
Keystone XL pipeline, rejoined the dis-
astrous Paris climate accords, and 
banned all new oil and gas leases on 
Federal lands. 
Meanwhile, the President lifted sanc-
tions on Russia’s Nord Stream 2 pipe-
line, thereby prioritizing Russian en-
ergy over domestic American energy. 
Overregulation, Federal mandates, 
and policies that will kill American en-
ergy production ignore facts and, in-
stead, increase energy costs and weak-
en our national security. 
These energy-killing policies are pav-
ing the way for the Green New Deal. 
Democrats like to sell this package as 
a greener America when, in reality, it 
makes our Nation more dependent on 
foreign nations for our growing energy 
needs; I might add, foreign nations 
that don’t protect the environment and 
develop this energy as safely as we do 
here in the United States. 
These energy needs, what we do in 
the United States, would sustain good- 
paying jobs, create prosperity for fu-
ture generations, and secure American 
interests around the globe. We must in-
vest in critical infrastructure like 
pipelines and refineries, and promote a 
regulatory environment that cultivates 
innovation in the energy sector. 
We must reject policies that place 
higher premiums on appeasing the 
Democrats’ Green New Deal ambitions 
than protecting the future of America’s 
energy sector and the thousands of 
American workers it employs. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote 
on the previous question so that the 
House can immediately consider this 
important legislation. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
A couple of points. I appreciate the 
attention to the Clean Corridors Pro-
gram. Again, this is about preparing 
for the future, from my perspective. 
This bill prepares for the future, and it 
prepares American workers to transi-
tion to that future and future genera-
tions. 
On the Clean Corridors Program, Chi-
nese are already doing this. In Decem-
ber, they produced 100,000 new charging 
and alternative fuel stations to prepare 
for the future. The Chinese have over a 
million of these stations. The U.S. has 
less than 50,000. 
So if we want to talk about energy 
independence, right on. That is what 
we want to talk about. We want to pre-
pare America for the future, while we 
protect the planet. 
The State of California gets more 
venture capital for research and renew-
ables and alternative fuels than the 
other 49 States combined. 
Why is that? 
Because we are preparing for the fu-
ture. We want to be competitive, and 
we want our workforce to continue to 
be the best in the world when it comes 
to energy. And we want to compete 
against the Chinese so that we are 
ready to capture these new energy 
sources. And we are doing it. 
It is not only good for the environ-
ment, it is good for the economy. 
And I would say, as a Californian who 
has been in the middle of this—and I 
will agree to being a liberal. I was once 
described as a liberal Republican under 
former party affiliations. I don’t think 
there is any such thing anymore, prob-
ably. 
This is about preparing for the fu-
ture. And mostly it is about preparing 
our American workforce to continue to 
be what they have been for so long, the 
best workforce, the best workers in the 
world. But you give them the tools to 
do that. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
SIRES), my good friend. 
Mr. SIRES. Madam Speaker, it is 
nice to see our colleague back, ready 
for the fight. It is nice to have him 
back. 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to 
speak in favor of the INVEST in Amer-
ica Act today. This type of investment 
in our country’s surface transportation 
is long overdue. 
The American Society of Civil Engi-
neers has rated our infrastructure a C- 
minus and said that we will need addi-
tional $2.6 trillion over the next decade 
to make the needed upgrades and re-
pairs. 
In New Jersey, drivers lose an aver-
age of $713 per year from driving on our 
roads, and 7.8 percent of our bridges are 
structurally deficient. 
The INVEST in America Act will de-
liver $343 billion for roads, bridges, and 
safety; $109 billion for transit; and $95 
billion for freight and passenger rail. 
Beyond improving our surface trans-
portation networks, this bill will make 
crucial investments to reduce carbon 
pollution and increase climate resil-
iency. 
I also want to thank Chairman DEFA-
ZIO and Ranking Member GRAVES for 
including funding for Member Des-
ignated Projects in the INVEST in 
America Act, which will deliver nec-
essary resources to communities in a 
transparent and accountable fashion. 
My district will receive critical fund-
ing for projects to connect pedestrians 
with transit, improve roadway safety, 
construct a ferry terminal, and im-
prove drainage systems and traffic sig-
nals. 
This bill is a win for New Jersey and 
a win for our country. We have costly 
needs, and the INVEST in America Act 
meets them. 
b 1330 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, the gentleman from 
California, who I do consider a friend, 
was talking about electric vehicles. I 
think there is a disconnect with where 
that electricity comes from. 
The drywall is not producing elec-
tricity when you plug in an electric ve-
hicle. The electricity is being manufac-
tured in a plant. So even if you had 100 
percent electric vehicles, the source of 
the electricity is still coming from 
some kind of fossil fuel. That is the re-
ality. It might upset some folks, but 
that is just the reality of electric vehi-
cles. 
Even if we were to go to a 100 percent 
renewable clean energy for all of our 
energy needs, even if we were to cede 
that part of the argument, you still 
need petrochemicals. You still need oil 
and gas for petrochemicals that we use 
for everything. 
If you are one of the individuals who 
is lucky enough to earn over $100,000 a 
year and can afford a Tesla, I want you 
to look at the dashboard on your Tesla 
and thank an American fracker be-
cause I can guarantee you that dash-
board is not made with hemp. It is 
made of petrochemicals. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. TAKANO). 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my fellow Californian for yield-
ing. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
the INVEST in America Act, a $547 bil-
lion infrastructure bill that will invest 
in communities across the country. 
This bold piece of legislation includes 
$20 million in contract authority to 
fund 
the 
I–15 
northern 
extension 
project in my own community in Riv-
erside County. 
This investment will create jobs in 
the Inland Empire; it will meet our 
basic infrastructure needs; and it will 
improve our freeways and better con-
nect our region. 
The INVEST in America Act will put 
us on the path to finally modernizing

June 30, 2021 
our Nation’s roads, bridges, rails, and 
water systems, while keeping in mind 
the urgency to fight climate change. 
I do not hear from my colleagues 
across the aisle language that speaks 
to the future; I hear language instead 
that clings to the past. On this side of 
the aisle, we speak about a transition 
to a cleaner, more green future. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ and invest in our 
communities. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
Madam Speaker, once again, Demo-
crats are bringing a hyperpartisan bill 
to the floor. They are blocking Repub-
lican efforts to actually improve meas-
ures for the Americans who don’t make 
$100,000 a year, who can’t afford a 
Tesla. 
This is not me saying that. You can 
look at the numbers. You can follow 
the money. 
Let’s just look at the numbers. In 
2015, when House Republicans were in 
charge and had another package that 
was an infrastructure package, 30 per-
cent of the amendments were Demo-
crat amendments. This time, only 18 
percent of the amendments are Repub-
lican amendments. Clearly, this is far 
from a bipartisan bill. 
Follow the money. It is no surprise 
that, under this bill, congressional dis-
tricts in blue States would get almost 
double the funding for transportation 
projects compared to districts in red 
States. 
Madam Speaker, while liberals and 
progressives push the Green New Deal 
fantasy on Americans, and while we do 
things like define art as infrastructure, 
House Republicans will continue to 
fight for investment in roads, bridges, 
and real transportation that will help 
real Americans and drive our economy. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous 
question and vote ‘‘no’’ on the rule, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
I want to thank my friend and col-
league from Pennsylvania. I do appre-
ciate his comments about my personal 
health and also his collegiality. 
His comments about being bipar-
tisan, I completely agree with. But 
compromise requires, from my perspec-
tive—and granted, we do have a dif-
ferent perspective about how we get 
there and who is giving and how much 
is given. 
I really think this bill is an incred-
ibly important bill for the future of 
America and American workers and in-
novation. 
As far as changing to renewables and 
alternatives, that electrical system has 
to be upgraded. We have seen what has 
happened because of climate change in 
the Gulf. We see the struggles we have 
on the West Coast with fires, all be-
cause, as evidence-based research tells 
us, what we have done with the envi-
ronment and the benefits we have got-
ten from fossil fuels over the course of 
the last decades and century. 
But now is the time to change and 
prepare for that change—not mind-
lessly. This isn’t a radical proposal. 
This is about preparing for the future. 
In terms of the infrastructure that 
gets those new alternative fuels, hydro-
gen fuel cell cars, battery electric cars, 
in California, we have acknowledged 
that we need to get these cars to be 
available to everyone, including people 
from disadvantaged communities. That 
is why we have changed the tax code to 
make it easier for everyone to get an 
alternative fuel car, not just wealthy 
people, and get the benefits of that. 
I want to read a quote from Forbes 
magazine 
about 
infrastructure 
and 
electric cars: ‘‘These vehicles use a dif-
ferent kind of fuel and plug into our 
electricity system, and the good news 
about that is there are a number of 
cost-benefit studies,’’ numerous ones, 
‘‘that are showing this can be really 
beneficial to all ratepayers, not just 
the drivers of the vehicles.’’ 
The critical mass of changing helps 
everybody. It brings down the cost of 
energy. So, for those rising costs at the 
pump, there is a bend in the arc that 
will come sooner rather than later that 
will help everyone, as opposed to the 
opinions by my colleague and some of 
his other speakers today. 
Matt Stanberry, the managing direc-
tor for the advanced transportation 
program at the trade group Advanced 
Energy Economy, says: ‘‘As you in-
crease electricity sales for charging 
the vehicles, it has the effect of driving 
down rates for all ratepayers because it 
spreads the fixed cost of the system out 
across a larger volume of sales.’’ 
Madam Speaker, this is about pre-
paring for this new energy future. Who-
ever gets there first, as a country, as 
always in our history, has a predomi-
nant role in foreign affairs and the 
leadership on this globe. The Chinese 
are trying to beat us to that. We can’t 
let that happen. We talk about global 
competitiveness. We need to get the in-
frastructure in. Yes, they need to do a 
better job at reducing pollution, tradi-
tional pollutants and carbon. 
The Clean Air Act, originally signed 
by Richard Nixon, and then changed 
and amended by Ronald Reagan, two 
Republicans, and the waiver that, un-
fortunately, previous administrations 
gave to California through multiple 
generations, have fueled, pardon the 
expression, the benefits we have gotten 
in public health and traditional pollut-
ants. It is fueling today the States that 
join California, like Colorado, which 
are pushing this innovation. 
Madam Speaker, this is about the fu-
ture of America and America’s excel-
lence and its energy independence and 
its workforce, staying at home and pro-
viding for this energy independence for 
future generations. 
Madam Speaker, in a moment, I will 
offer an amendment to the rule to 
make in order the amendment offered 
by Ms. SLOTKIN, which amends the un-
derlying bill to prohibit using transit 
funds for artwork and nonfunctional 
landscaping. 
AMENDMENT OFFERED BY MR. DESAULNIER

H3323 
June 30, 2021 
The Clerk read the title of the resolu-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 504, the resolu-
tion is considered read. 
The text of the resolution is as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 503 
Whereas January 6, 2021, was one of the 
darkest days of our democracy, during which 
insurrectionists 
attempted 
to 
impede 
Congress’s Constitutional mandate to vali-
date the presidential election and launched 
an assault on the United States Capitol Com-
plex that resulted in multiple deaths, phys-
ical harm to over 140 members of law en-
forcement, and terror and trauma among 
staff, institutional employees, press, and 
Members; 
Whereas, on January 27, 2021, the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security issued a Na-
tional Terrorism Advisory System Bulletin 
that due to the ‘‘heightened threat environ-
ment across the United States,’’ in which 
‘‘[S]ome ideologically-motivated violent ex-
tremists with objections to the exercise of 
governmental authority and the presidential 
transition, as well as other perceived griev-
ances fueled by false narratives, could con-
tinue to mobilize to incite or commit vio-
lence.’’ The Bulletin also stated that— 
(1) ‘‘DHS is concerned these same drivers 
to violence will remain through early 2021 
and some DVEs [domestic violent extrem-
ists] may be emboldened by the January 6, 
2021 breach of the U.S. Capitol Building in 
Washington, D.C. to target elected officials 
and government facilities.’’; and 
(2) ‘‘Threats of violence against critical in-
frastructure, including the electric, tele-
communications and healthcare sectors, in-
creased in 2020 with violent extremists citing 
misinformation 
and 
conspiracy 
theories 
about COVID–19 for their actions’’; 
Whereas, on September 24, 2020, Director of 
the Federal Bureau of Investigation Chris-
topher Wray testified before the Committee 
on Homeland Security of the House of Rep-
resentatives that— 
(1) ‘‘[T]he underlying drivers for domestic 
violent extremism – such as perceptions of 
government or law enforcement overreach, 
sociopolitical conditions, racism, anti-Semi-
tism, Islamophobia, misogyny, and reactions 
to legislative actions – remain constant.’’; 
(2) ‘‘[W]ithin the domestic terrorism buck-
et category as a whole, racially-motivated 
violent extremism is, I think, the biggest 
bucket within the larger group. And within 
the racially-motivated violent extremists 
bucket, people subscribing to some kind of 
white supremacist-type ideology is certainly 
the biggest chunk of that.’’; and 
(3) ‘‘More deaths were caused by DVEs 
than international terrorists in recent years. 
In fact, 2019 was the deadliest year for do-
mestic extremist violence since the Okla-
homa City bombing in 1995’’; 
Whereas, on April 15, 2021, Michael Bolton, 
the Inspector General for the United States 
Capitol Police, testified to the Committee on 
House Administration of the House of Rep-
resentatives that— 
(1) ‘‘The Department lacked adequate guid-
ance for operational planning. USCP did not 
have policy and procedures in place that 
communicated which personnel were respon-
sible for operational planning, what type of 
operational planning documents its per-
sonnel should prepare, nor when its per-
sonnel should prepare operational planning 
documents.’’; and 
(2) ‘‘USCP failed to disseminate relevant 
information obtained from outside sources, 
lacked consensus on interpretation of threat 
analyses, and disseminated conflicting intel-
ligence 
information 
regarding 
planned 
events for January 6, 2021.’’; and 
Whereas the security leadership of the 
Congress under-prepared for the events of 
January 6th, with United States Capitol Po-
lice Inspector General Michael Bolton testi-
fying again on June 15, 2021, that— 
(1) ‘‘USCP did not have adequate policies 
and procedures for FRU (First Responder 
Unit) defining its overall operations. Addi-
tionally, FRU lacked resources and training 
for properly completing its mission.’’; 
(2) ‘‘The Department did not have adequate 
policies and procedures for securing ballistic 
helmets 
and 
vests 
strategically 
stored 
around the Capitol Complex.’’; and 
(3) ‘‘FRU did not have the proper resources 
to complete its mission.’’: Now, therefore, be 
it

from Minnesota (Mrs. FISCHBACH) each 
will control 30 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Massachusetts. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, 175 days ago, as we 
gathered here in this spot, the House 
floor became a crime scene. The U.S. 
Capitol, this temple of democracy, was 
ransacked. Property was damaged, and 
more importantly, lives were lost. 
Insurrectionists tried to stop our de-
mocracy in its tracks. A mob wanted 
to prevent the certification of a free 
and fair election in America, and they 
resorted to violence to do it. 
I will never forget that day. I was one 
of the last Members off this House 
floor, as we were being taken to a se-
cure location away from the mayhem. 
As I was walking out, I looked over 
and saw these people—homegrown ter-
rorists, I call them—literally smashing 
the doors with their bare fists and 
breaking the glass to try to get at us. 
They weren’t here to peacefully pro-
test. They were fueled by rage and here 
to cause harm. I looked in their eyes, 
and I saw hate. 
Many of my colleagues feared for 
their lives. Some called loved ones to 
say good-bye. The staff that worked 
here barricaded their office doors. They 
ran down these marble halls, trying 
one door after the next, just searching 
for safety. Others hid in closets, terri-
fied. 
When those of us who are elected to 
Congress put our names on the ballot, 
we are prepared to take all kinds of in-
coming. But the staff here—the cafe-
teria workers, the cleaning crew, the 
people who make our democracy func-
tion day in and day out—they do not. 
But, still, they found themselves in 
danger, afraid for their lives. 
We must speak the truth of what 
happened that day, Madam Speaker. 
Shockingly, there is an effort by some 
in this Congress to whitewash and min-
imize what went on. One of my col-
leagues even suggested it was somehow 
just a normal tourist visit, as if facts 
don’t matter, as if we all didn’t see 
with our own eyes what happened. 
History will judge how we respond to 
the events of that day, and the glare of 
history should be cast most harshly on 
the minority leader, who worked over-
time to prevent a bipartisan, bicameral 
commission from being formed to ex-
amine what happened on January 6. 
A bipartisan commission emerged 
out of the Homeland Security Com-
mittee with a bipartisan vote. Every-
thing the minority leader asked for in 
this commission, he got it. He got it 
all. But then, I guess, Donald Trump 
called him, and he began walking back 
his support and whipping against his 
own ranking member’s bipartisan deal. 
It has been 25 weeks since an insur-
rection in our country. A commission 
should be already at work right now, 
getting the facts about this attack on 
our democracy so it will never, ever, 
ever happen again. 
Sadly, a majority of Republicans ob-
jected to that happening. Now, they 
may 
have 
delayed 
uncovering 
the 
truth, Madam Speaker. But, Madam 
Speaker, the truth will not stay buried 
forever. That is why we are here today, 
because the facts matter.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3325 
June 30, 2021 
A select committee will finally get to 
the truth about the events of January 
6. It is modeled after a select com-
mittee formed when my Republican 
colleagues were in charge. 
I hope I am wrong, but if past is pro-
logue, many of my Republican friends 
will stand up today and say no. They 
will oppose this select committee and 
say they want a different approach. 
Well, let me again remind them: We 
already gave them exactly what they 
asked for with the commission, and 
even that wasn’t good enough. I think, 
for some on the other side, nothing 
that gets to the truth will ever be good 
enough because they do not want the 
truth. 
Michael Fanone, a Metropolitan Po-
lice Department officer for nearly two 
decades, responded to the insurrection 
on January 6. In a letter that he wrote 
to all of us, he said: ‘‘I struggle daily 
with the emotional anxiety of having 
survived such a traumatic event, but I 
also struggle with the anxiety of hear-
ing those who continue to downplay 
the events of that day and those who 
would ignore them altogether with 
their lack of acknowledgment. The in-
difference shown to my colleagues and 
I is disgraceful.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I include the full 
text of his letter in the RECORD. 
MAY 5, 2021. 
TO ALL ELECTED MEMBERS OF THE UNITED 
STATES GOVERNMENT, My name is Michael 
Fanone and I have been a sworn officer with 
the Metropolitan Police Department for al-
most two decades. On January 06, 2021, I par-
ticipated in the defense of the United States 
Capitol and as a result of my efforts was se-
verely injured. I was pulled out into the 
crowd, away from my fellow officers, beaten 
with fists, metal objects, stripped of my 
issued badge, radio and ammunition maga-
zine and electrocuted numerous times with a 
Taser. I am writing to you so that you may 
better understand my experience that day. 
I am assigned to the First District’s Crime 
Suppression Team and while my daily re-
sponsibilities 
involve 
combating 
violent 
crime and narcotics related offenses. I, like 
many other officers, took it upon myself to 
respond to the numerous calls for help com-
ing from my colleagues at the Capitol Com-
plex. Upon my arrival my partner, Jimmy 
Albright, and I searched for an area where 
we could be of most assistance and eventu-
ally found our way to the West Terrace 
Lower Tunnel entrance to the Capitol. The 
fighting here was nothing short of brutal. I 
observed approximately thirty police officers 
standing shoulder-to-shoulder maybe four or 
five abreast using the weight of their own 
bodies to hold back the onslaught of violent 
attackers. Many of these officers were in-
jured, bleeding and fatigued but they contin-
ued to fight. 
In the midst of this fighting, I observed 
Commander Ramey Kyle, cool, calm, and 
collected giving commands to his officers. 
‘‘Hold the line.’’ It was the most inspira-
tional moment of my entire life. Even as I 
write this it brings me to tears. I tried to 
render assistance to some of the injured offi-
cers asking them if they needed a break. 
There were no volunteers, only those that 
identified injured colleagues who may be in 
need of assistance. I have never experienced 
such bravery, courage and selflessness. 
Since then I have struggled with many as-
pects of that day. As the physical injuries 
gradually subsided in crept the psychological 
trauma. In many ways I still live my life as 
if it is January 07, 2021. I struggle daily with 
the emotional anxiety of having survived 
such a traumatic event but I also struggle 
with the anxiety of hearing those who con-
tinue to downplay the events of that day and 
those who would ignore them altogether 
with their lack of acknowledgement. The in-
difference shown to my colleagues and I is 
disgraceful. 
It has been 119 days since 850 Metropolitan 
Police (MPDC) Officers responded to the Cap-
itol and stopped a violent insurrection from 
taking over the Capitol Complex saving 
countless Members of Congress and their 
staff from almost certain injury and even 
death. The time to fully recognize these Offi-
cers actions is NOW! 
Sincerely, 
MICHAEL FANONE. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
am tired of the delays. Quite frankly, I 
am sick and tired of the fact that there 
are too many people in this Chamber 
who continue to put party over country 
and propagate the lies, distortions, and 
falsehoods that led to January 6. It is 
disgusting. 
For Congress to do nothing in re-
sponse to a literal insurrection would 
allow our democracy to be chipped 
away at from the inside. Not on my 
watch. 
Our system of government is fragile. 
It is not a given; it is a choice. Looking 
down on us from the gallery right now 
are representatives of the D.C. Metro-
politan Police and the U.S. Capitol Po-
lice, and I want to thank them and 
their colleagues for their service and 
for protecting us and our democracy on 
January 6. 
To my colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle who are about to vote ‘‘no’’ on 
this, please, no lectures on respect for 
the police because a ‘‘no’’ vote is a vote 
to cover for those who brutally at-
tacked the police on January 6. 
I say to my colleagues in this House, 
they will be watching as we cast our 
votes. History will be watching. I pray 
that we have the moral courage to do 
what is right, that we choose truth and 
that we choose to defend our democ-
racy. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in opposition to H. Res. 503, and I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
There is no doubt that what tran-
spired on January 6 was a dark day, 
but instead of a good-faith effort to 
reach an objective conclusion, Speaker 
PELOSI
and House Democrats have 
placed partisan, divisive politics ahead 
of the interests of the American people. 
Most fundamental to any objective 
investigation is being free from polit-
ical influence and partisan bias. Unfor-
tunately, this resolution fails to meet 
that basic benchmark, as Democrats 
refuse to put together a truly bipar-
tisan commission, with equal authority 
given to all members, not just the ma-
jority. 
It appears my colleagues are more in-
terested in reaching the predetermined 
outcome of their own narrative than 
truly investigating the January 6 at-
tack. The resolution itself is full of 
charged language that implies an out-
come. 
In fact, two bipartisan committees in 
the Senate have already conducted 
wide-ranging investigations and issued 
their joint report. Their report, which 
is more than 100 pages, outlines a 
timeline of events and a series of rec-
ommendations for moving forward. 
The Architect of the Capitol has also 
already been given $10 million to inves-
tigate the security failures on January 
6. Why are we replicating that work? 
The Department of Justice and the 
FBI have already arrested and charged 
more than 500 people for crimes rang-
ing from disorderly conduct to theft of 
government property to assaulting a 
Federal law enforcement officer. Those 
individuals are being adjudicated by 
the courts as we speak. That process 
will continue for some time. That is 
the way it should work. 
Instead, Democrats are injecting par-
tisanship into the equation, hoping to 
stretch 
out 
an 
investigation 
long 
enough to distract from their abject 
failure to govern, while the American 
people are left to suffer the con-
sequences of that failure. 
While we spend time discussing this 
partisan committee, American farmers 
are facing a severe drought, gas prices 
are going up, inflation is rising, busi-
nesses can’t find employees, and there 
is a crisis at the southern border. We 
need to spend our time finding solu-
tions and helping Americans, not cre-
ating partisan commissions to do work 
that has already been done com-
petently by the U.S. Senate and by law 
enforcement. 
Not only would this select committee 
not prohibit interfering with ongoing 
law enforcement investigations that 
are already yielding significant results, 
but it would lack the enforcement pow-
ers of those existing investigations. 
Even worse, Speaker PELOSI
would 
have the ability to handpick the en-
tirety of the committee. 
If Speaker PELOSI and House Demo-
crats were serious about this, they 
might have considered acting sooner 
than 6 months after the fact. The 
standing committees of this body al-
ready have the jurisdiction and the au-
thority to investigate January 6, and 
the Speaker could have directed them 
to open an investigation at any time. 
But perhaps most important is our 
obligation to the brave men and women 
of law enforcement who responded to 
the Capitol and surrounding areas on 
January 6, members of the U.S. Capitol 
Police, the D.C. Metropolitan Police, 
the National Guard, and the many 
other State and Federal agencies who 
assisted in restoring order. We owe it 
to them to ensure that any investiga-
tion we undertake is one that is fair, 
bipartisan, and honorable, absent the 
ulterior motives and partisan politics 
that so often plague us. 
Unfortunately, Madam Speaker, H. 
Res. 503 falls far short. For that reason,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3326 
June 30, 2021 
I oppose the legislation, and I urge 
other Members to do so. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Oh, my God, I can’t believe what I 
just heard. I mean, my Republican col-
leagues are talking about the need for 
bipartisanship. We gave them biparti-
sanship. The ranking Republican mem-
ber on the Homeland Security Com-
mittee endorsed a bipartisan commis-
sion, and my friends on the other side, 
including the gentlewoman who just 
spoke, voted ‘‘no’’ on it. 
Now, they are objecting to a select 
committee that we are forming that is 
exactly like the select committee that 
they formed when they were in charge. 
Give me a break. 
This is clear—people should know 
this—they don’t want to get to the 
truth. But we will insist that we get to 
the truth. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. 
THOMPSON), the chairman of the Home-
land Security Committee, who did such 
an incredible job in negotiating a bi-
partisan commission. 
b 1400 
Mr. 
THOMPSON 
of 
Mississippi. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman for yielding. 
I rise in support of H. Res. 503, a 
measure Establishing the Select Com-
mittee to Investigate the January 6th 
Attack on the United States Capitol. 
Next week will mark 6 months since 
the world watched in horror as Ameri-
cans violently stormed the Capitol in 
an attempt to stop Congress from car-
rying out its constitutional duty to 
certify a Presidential election. 
Like many of my colleagues, I had 
hoped that the Republican Senators 
would put country over politics and 
support legislation to establish a bipar-
tisan, independent commission just as 
35 House Republicans did in May. 
I had hoped they would do so, just as 
a previous generation of Senators did 
in response to the 9/11 terrorist attack. 
Instead, our bipartisan, good faith 
proposal was met with a filibuster. 
Now that Senate Republicans have cho-
sen to block the formation of an inde-
pendent commission, it falls to the 
House to stay the course and get the 
American people the answers they de-
serve. 
I commend the Speaker for intro-
ducing this measure and offering us a 
way forward. 
I believe that with the right Mem-
bers, staff and resources, and coopera-
tion from Federal, State, and local 
partners and the private sector, this se-
lect committee will be well-positioned 
to do vital oversight work into why our 
information-sharing, counterterrorism, 
and coordination efforts failed so cata-
strophically on January 6. 
In addition to that, I salute the men 
and women who protected us on that 
day. Some of us were in this very build-
ing at the time, some of us in the gal-
lery. I find it incomprehensible that 
people would deny what occurred and 
now try to deflect by talking about 
other issues. 
This is the citadel of democracy we 
are standing in right now. We have to 
protect it. I urge my colleagues to join 
me in voting to protect this temple of 
democracy by voting in favor of H. Res. 
503. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
will remind the gentleman from Mis-
sissippi that it was not this body that 
stopped the commission. It did not re-
ceive the required support from both 
sides of the aisle in the Senate to move 
forward. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to 
the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BUR-
GESS). 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
This resolution establishes a select 
committee to investigate the January 
6 attack on the Capitol. After Speaker 
PELOSI’s first attempt at a commission 
failed to pass the Senate, she is now 
pushing a resolution to create, what 
will be by its very nature, a very par-
tisan select committee. 
The outcome of this investigation 
has, in fact, already been written. The 
Democrats have been publicly excori-
ating President Trump for months. 
They claim we need to understand the 
root cause of what happened on Janu-
ary 6, but the truth is, they have al-
ready laid the blame. 
I was concerned that the commission 
that the Speaker previously attempted 
to create would, in fact, have been very 
partisan in nature. That is why I and 
many other Members of this body and 
Members of the Senate voted against 
her resolution. 
The Speaker attempted to establish 
what she claimed would be a bipartisan 
commission to investigate the events 
of January 6 modeled after the 9/11 
Commission, but there are some key 
differences between the two. 
The 9/11 Commission focused on a for-
eign attack on the homeland. The pro-
posed January 6 commission would 
have focused on a purely domestic 
event. 
The fact pattern for these two events 
is entirely different. For the 9/11 Com-
mission we did not definitely know at 
the outset who had perpetrated that 
attack. Unfortunately, as we know, 
Democrats have already laid the blame 
for the January 6 attack before any in-
vestigative body has been established. 
The staff composition for the Speak-
er’s proposed January 6 commission 
mirrored that of the 9/11 Commission, 
however, the January 6 commission 
would have ultimately been one party 
investigating the other. The biggest 
concern of Republicans is that only one 
staff would have served the entire Jan-
uary 6 commission. In an inherently 
partisan investigation, Congress should 
authorize two separate staffs to serve 
the Members of each party. And, in 
fact, I attempted to amend that origi-
nal resolution at the Rules Committee 
but was turned away. 
Whether or not you blame President 
Trump for the events of January 6, the 
fact remains that the incident was a 
massive security failure. 
Why were our United States Capitol 
Police Officers, who sacrifice every day 
to protect us, caught so unprepared? 
Why did the National Guard take so 
long to mobilize when the threat was 
clear? 
What was known by our intelligence 
agencies and the Sergeant at Arms in 
the days leading up to January 6? 
These are the questions that need an-
swering if we are truly going to be fo-
cused on preventing another security 
failure. And I won’t reiterate the lit-
any that the gentlewoman from Min-
nesota has already elucidated. 
If we don’t do it, it is not that there 
are no investigations; the investiga-
tions are ongoing. The Department of 
Justice—the FBI has a major inves-
tigation, as has already been pointed 
out. 500 people are incarcerated and 
waiting adjudication, waiting for their 
day in court. 
I am disappointed that the Demo-
crats remain fixated on laying blame, 
rather than investigating how we can 
better prepare our United States Cap-
itol Police and our other Federal re-
sponse forces to face future threats. 
There will be future threats. For these 
reasons, I urge opposition to this reso-
lution. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
urge my colleagues on the other side to 
stop the lame excuses. Now they are 
blaming the Senate? 
Let’s go over the chronology: Leader 
MCCARTHY had a bunch of demands in 
order that we move forward with a bi-
partisan commission. We gave him 
every one. 
And then what happened is, I guess, 
he didn’t expect us to actually work 
with him on this in a bipartisan way. 
There is a quote that appeared in Polit-
ico from a Republican aide who said: ‘‘I 
think Kevin was hoping that the Demo-
crats would never agree to our re-
quests. 
That 
way 
the 
commission 
would be partisan and we can all vote 
no and say it’s a sham operation. 
‘‘Because he knows Trump is going to 
‘lose his mind over this commission’.’’ 
And then all the sudden, he comes 
out against it, and 175 of my Repub-
lican colleagues voted against a bipar-
tisan commission. They sent a signal 
to the Senate to kill it. 
So the idea that somehow they are 
washing their hands of any responsi-
bility, they were complicit in killing 
the bipartisan commission. 
And now they are here to try to kill 
a select committee modeled after a 
committee that they established when 
they were in charge. 
So enough of the lame excuses. We 
get it. You don’t want to get to the 
truth. 
I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from New York (Mr. JEFFRIES), the dis-
tinguished chairman of the Democratic 
Caucus.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3327 
June 30, 2021 
Mr. JEFFRIES. Madam Speaker, the 
hypocrisy coming from some in this 
Chamber is extraordinary. The radical 
right consistently claims to be the 
party of law and order, but they refuse 
to sign off on an investigation into the 
January 6 violent attack on the Cap-
itol, which embodied lawlessness and 
disorder. 
They have chosen party over patriot-
ism. They have chosen autocracy over 
democracy. They have chosen the big 
lie over the rule of law. They have cho-
sen conspiracy theories over the Con-
stitution. And, yes, they have chosen 
the most corrupt President in Amer-
ican history over the peaceful transfer 
of power. 
But truth crushed to the ground will 
rise again, and we will uncover the 
truth, the whole truth, and nothing but 
the truth whether you like it or not. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. VAN DUYNE). 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Madam Speaker, I 
ran for Congress, like many of my col-
leagues, to make change, to represent 
my district well, and to work hard with 
my colleagues in a bipartisan way to 
deliver the solutions that the Amer-
ican people expect from us. 
Unfortunately, we are again here 
today using the taxpayers’ time to play 
a part in more political theater. 
January 6 was a terrible day for this 
institution, for the Capitol Police, the 
Members and the staff serving here, 
and the country. That is why the Sen-
ate Rules Committee conducted a thor-
ough investigation into the events that 
day and publicly released their find-
ings. That is why there are still inves-
tigations going on at Federal agencies. 
That is why the House Committee on 
Appropriations, 
Financial 
Services, 
Homeland 
Security, 
Judiciary, 
and 
Oversight and Reform are still con-
ducting investigations. 
The redundancy of another com-
mittee is not only unnecessary, but it 
is a distraction. It is a distraction 
meant to mask humanitarian failures 
at the border, massive spikes in crime 
in cities across the country, and abso-
lute inept leadership in confronting our 
foreign adversaries. 
The Speaker’s obsession with domi-
nating this investigation is concerning. 
Her puppet committee has no prohibi-
tion on interfering with ongoing law 
enforcement 
investigations, 
poten-
tially distracting from putting those 
responsible behind bars, because it is 
clear that this is not the priority here. 
The only priority here is a self-serving 
agenda to put D.C. politicians first and 
give them their cable news talking 
points. 
If we are going to spend time and re-
sources on investigations, we should be 
doing many things in this House that 
have been ignored by the Democrats, 
like investigating the origins of COVID 
to hold China accountable, cleaning up 
a humanitarian crisis at the border 
created by Democrat policies. But 
there is no outrage on the left for half 
a million people who died of COVID, for 
the countless children who have been 
harmed at our border. 
I will be voting ‘‘no’’ on this select 
committee. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
am sorry that the previous speaker 
doesn’t see the importance of trying to 
get to the bottom of an attack on our 
democracy. 
And by the way, for the Record, the 
gentlewoman voted against the bipar-
tisan commission. 
I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from New York (Mrs. CAROLYN
B. 
MALONEY), 
the 
distinguished 
chair-
woman of the Committee on Oversight 
and Reform. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. I thank the gentleman for yield-
ing and for his leadership. 
I rise today in strong support of 
Speaker PELOSI’s resolution to estab-
lish a select committee to investigate 
the January 6 attack on our Capitol. I 
thank the Speaker for her unwavering 
commitment to uncovering the truth 
about what happened that day. 
This select committee will be critical 
to fully understanding the root causes 
of the attack on our Capitol and to 
passing reforms to ensure that an in-
surrection never again reaches these 
Halls or threatens our democracy. 
Over the past 5 months, the Over-
sight and Reform Committee has made 
substantial progress in investigating 
the attack on our Capitol. 
The committee has asked why our 
Nation’s 
law 
enforcement 
agencies 
failed to anticipate a domestic ter-
rorist attack that was planned right 
out in the open on social media, tele-
vision, and why critical assistance 
took so long to arrive during the at-
tack. 
In the course of our investigation, 
the Oversight and Reform Committee 
has found that officials made 12 urgent 
requests for security assistance at the 
Capitol, yet the National Guard did not 
arrive until more than 4 hours after 
the Capitol perimeter was breached and 
lives were threatened. 
We have found that warnings of the 
impending assault were passed directly 
to the FBI in the weeks before the at-
tack, including that insurrectionists 
planned in writing to take the Capitol 
building. We plan to take the Capitol 
building. Yet, in the face of these warn-
ings, we have found that our Nation’s 
intelligence agencies failed to act. 
Our work is far from done, and we 
must continue to seek the truth about 
the January 6 domestic terrorist at-
tack. I look forward to supporting this 
select committee and its investigation 
and working together to secure our de-
mocracy. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. The gentleman from Massachu-
setts continues talking about how this 
select committee has been modeled 
after 
the 
Select 
Committee 
on 
Benghazi, but ‘‘modeled’’ is a very 
loose term, given that this committee 
obviously has a far more skewed ratio 
than the Benghazi committee did. 
In addition to that, this committee 
can all be appointed by the Speaker. In 
her own words, she agreed that, yes, 
she could appoint them all. In the Se-
lect Committee on Benghazi, there 
were recommendations taken from the 
minority to the majority in order to 
appoint that membership. 
So to say that this has been modeled 
after Benghazi, maybe because they 
have the name ‘‘select committee,’’ 
and that is the model they use, but cer-
tainly the membership and the makeup 
of this is not the bipartisan issue that 
it was on the Select Committee on 
Benghazi. 
Madam Speaker, I have been listen-
ing to some of my colleagues on the 
other side, and you would think that 
nothing is being done to investigate 
the January 6 attack, and that is 
wrong. 
In addition to the bipartisan Senate 
investigation that has already been 
mentioned, numerous other investiga-
tions are under way by both law en-
forcement and congressional bodies. 
b 1415 
And as I have mentioned, we have al-
ready allocated $10 million for the Ar-
chitect of the Capitol to investigate 
what went wrong that day, and law en-
forcement continues to conduct its in-
vestigation. 
The majority ignores the fact that 
more than 500 individuals—which has 
been mentioned several times—have 
been arrested or charged in connection 
with the January 6 attack, and that in-
vestigation will likely continue for 
some time. 
Instead of ignoring legitimate inves-
tigations and launching one of partisan 
politics, we ought to let the processes 
that are already underway continue. If 
we don’t, we risk undermining the 
work that is already being done. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, 
the language on consultation is the 
exact same language that was in the 
Select Committee on Benghazi. 
Let’s just be honest. My friends on 
the other side are not interested in get-
ting to the truth. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
SWALWELL). 
Mr. SWALWELL. ‘‘Blessed are the 
peacemakers, for they shall be called 
the children of God.’’ 
Madam Speaker, we are blessed today 
that joining us are some of the heroes 
from the Metropolitan Police Depart-
ment and Capitol Police, who defended 
this Capitol on January 6. And the 
questions that they are asking are the 
questions that our constituents are 
asking about January 6. 
Will we investigate how our democ-
racy was attacked, or will we send a 
green light to allow it to be attacked 
again? 
Will we stand with the cops, or roll 
with the cop killers?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3328 
June 30, 2021 
Do we want the truth, or will we 
allow history to be erased? 
Are we for the Constitution, or are 
we for chaos? 
Madam Speaker, January 6 was a 
crime against our democracy and the 
heroes of this Capitol. Now we must in-
vestigate it. Failing that, we are law-
less and lost. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Pennsylvania (Ms. DEAN). 
Ms. DEAN. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the chairman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, what are they afraid 
of? The truth? 
On January 6, I came to this Cham-
ber to try to understand why some of 
my colleagues were engaged in a lie 
that the 2020 election was stolen from 
their candidate. I never expected to 
finish that day forever shaken and 
changed by what happened in this 
Chamber. 
Madam Speaker, I was up in the Gal-
lery, right up here. I remember the ter-
rifying banging on those doors as we 
were exited and wearing gas masks— 
my fear for my colleagues, the staff, 
the press, the custodial staff, the Cap-
itol Police, and the anxiety that my 
family suffered with their mom inside 
as they watched an insurrection on tel-
evision, wondering if we would make it 
out alive. 
To be clear, this was a domestic ter-
rorist attack on everyone who works in 
this Capitol complex. It was an attack 
on democracy. It was an attack on the 
peaceful transfer of power. It was an 
attack on our Nation. 
We need a select subcommittee to 
understand what happened on January 
6, where many of our lives were at risk. 
We need to know the facts and cir-
cumstances. We need to know the truth 
so that it never happens again. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
wanted to comment a little on the 
comments regarding the makeup of the 
select committee. 
Madam Speaker, it is my under-
standing that when Speaker PELOSI 
was asked if she could veto Republican 
picks for the select committee, Speak-
er PELOSI responded: Yes, we will see 
who they nominate. 
That opens the door for the commit-
tee’s work to be corrupted even before 
it begins, and she continues to have 
full control over the members of that 
committee. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, let 
me again say it is the exact same lan-
guage that was in their Benghazi Se-
lect Committee. And I am more than 
happy to send over a paper copy so 
they can see it. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
MALINOWSKI). 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Madam Speaker, 
I rise in support of what is now our 
only remaining opportunity to under-
stand the attack on the Capitol. 
January 6 was a day when democracy 
in America almost gave way to anar-
chy. It was also the worst day for law 
enforcement in America since 9/11. 
Yes, the courts can tell us who bru-
tally attacked our brave police officers 
that day; who tried to stop, by vio-
lence, the peaceful transfer of power 
from one President to another. 
But they can’t tell us why this hap-
pened; how and why did so many ordi-
nary Americans come to believe that 
storming our Capitol was a perfectly 
normal thing to do; how did this move-
ment become radicalized, and what 
drives it to this day. 
Because the lies are still being told, 
and I am not going to move on from 
confronting a lie as others refuse to 
move on from promoting that lie. 
If somebody voted against a bipar-
tisan commission and opposes this se-
lect committee, it can only be because 
they don’t want to know the answers 
to the questions that still remain. 
Madam Speaker, I am going to vote 
‘‘yes’’ because I want to know those an-
swers so that this will never happen 
again. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PAS-
CRELL). 
Mr. PASCRELL. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the chairman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
the truth and justice. 
Twenty years ago, we suffered the 
worst external terrorist attack in our 
modern history. But the gravest attack 
ever on American democracy came 175 
days ago. That attack was borne of big 
lies; big lies about the election, about 
voting, and about our democracy. The 
lies divided our country. They spread 
like a plague. 
On December 11, I warned of elected 
officials amplifying big lies. The 14th 
Amendment is clear about traitors and 
seditionists on the day the electors 
tried to do their job. Think about it. 
We must now hold everyone respon-
sible. We must know how the spark of 
insurrection was ignited and document 
who fanned the flames. 
Madam Speaker, we have a duty to 
history. Our review will guide future 
generations. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from the U.S. Virgin Islands (Ms. 
PLASKETT). 
Ms. PLASKETT. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in strong support of this bill. 
On January 6, we witnessed one of 
the darkest days in our history, a vio-
lent attack on the U.S. Capitol during 
the formal counting of the votes on the 
election of a President. They at-
tempted to destroy our House, the peo-
ple’s House. 
As the elected stewards of this 
House, it is our responsibility to inves-
tigate the breakdowns and breaches in 
security that failed us, that led us to 
January 6. 
It is our collective responsibility to 
use the authority given to us for a se-
lect panel devoted solely to the proper 
and thorough investigation of the facts 
and causes of the attack; not just the 
attackers, but the conspirators and the 
enablers. 
If you can’t protect the people’s 
House, God help your family’s house if 
the former President wishes to loot 
that as well. 
Madam Speaker, consideration and 
passage of this resolution today is 
timely, as Americans across the Nation 
prepare to celebrate Fourth of July, 
the signing of our Declaration of Inde-
pendence. Our country was founded on 
a democratic process of fair elections. I 
cannot think of a more genuine cele-
bration of our independence than the 
commitment to protect our democracy. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. TAKANO), the distin-
guished chairman of the Committee on 
Veterans’ Affairs. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Chairman MCGOVERN for yield-
ing. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
strong support of House Resolution 503, 
to establish a select committee to in-
vestigate the January 6 attack on the 
United States Capitol. 
On 
January 
6, 
2021, 
Americans 
watched as the U.S. Capitol was over-
run by a violent mob of Trump sup-
porters on a mission to stop the certifi-
cation of the electoral college votes. 
Lawmakers were in this very Chamber 
carrying out their constitutional duty 
when this mob, incited by then-Presi-
dent 
Trump, 
forced 
them 
into 
lockdown. Many feared for their lives. 
Our democratic process came to a halt, 
and, unfortunately, a Capitol Police of-
ficer lost his life. 
Madam Speaker, this was an attack 
on our democracy. We must shine a 
light on the truth to prevent some-
thing like this from ever happening 
again and to hold those responsible for 
inciting this insurrection accountable 
for the damage they have caused. 
For the sake of our democracy, I urge 
my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ to estab-
lish the select committee. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, our country is fac-
ing enormous challenges, but instead of 
addressing those challenges, we are fo-
cused on duplicating work that has al-
ready been done. And I have to repeat 
that. These investigations have been 
done and are ongoing. And it appears 
as though this select committee is 
being done purely for political pur-
poses. 
In early June, two Senate commit-
tees issued a joint report focusing on 
‘‘security, planning, and response fail-
ures related to the violence and un-
precedented attack on January 6.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3329 
June 30, 2021 
That report was signed by Democrats 
and Republicans, and it included a 
comprehensive audit of the security, 
intelligence, and authority failures of 
that day. It also included substantive 
recommendations for moving forward, 
including tangible action items that 
can be addressed by this Congress. 
But instead of working in tandem 
with our Senate counterparts, Demo-
crats want to politicize this issue even 
further. At a time when the American 
people have little trust in the govern-
ment, we need to be working to restore 
that trust. Unfortunately, this kind of 
partisan move will not advance that 
shared goal. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself 30 seconds. 
Madam Speaker, I was one of the last 
people off this House floor. When I 
walked into the Speaker’s lobby, I saw 
this mob smashing the window, trying 
to get at us. And we were protected be-
cause of the Capitol Police and the D.C. 
police who were here. They protected 
my life. They protected your life. 
And to them: I apologize that you 
have to hear this kind of debate, a par-
tisan attempt to try to undermine a 
committee that is aimed at getting at 
the truth of what happened. You de-
serve better. 
The people who work up here deserve 
better. Our democracy deserves better. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. 
DEMINGS). 
Mrs. DEMINGS. Madam Speaker, my 
colleagues way on the other side of the 
aisle asked a question: How can we bet-
ter protect our Capitol Police? 
Well, as a former police chief, let me 
tell you how. 
First, do not replace truth with lies. 
Second, uphold the law yourselves. 
Third, hold those who beat the police 
down accountable. 
How can you do that without know-
ing the complete truth, without a thor-
ough investigation? 
My colleagues way on the other side 
of the aisle brought up the 9/11 Com-
mission being about foreign actors. 
Well, let me remind you that the 
oath that we took says that we will 
protect and defend the Constitution of 
the United States against all enemies, 
foreign and domestic. 
Madam Speaker, did they forget? Did 
they ever really know? Or were they 
simply too afraid to care? 
Well, I care, and so do my brothers 
and sisters in blue. We will not forget, 
and we will not let you forget either. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers be given 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks on H. 
Res. 503. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON 
LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentleman for yielding, and 
I thank my friend who is managing on 
the other side. 
Madam Speaker, I wanted to come 
just for a brief minute to clarify what 
I heard on this floor. There is not a 
self-serving mindset today. There is a 
serving of the American people, be-
cause the American people have cried 
out for the reasons why domestic ter-
rorists attacked this place. 
So I say that the Speaker worked bi-
partisan with Mr. KATKO
and Mr. 
THOMPSON and gave us an independent 
commission, but that was not accepted. 
So, today, we come because it is not 
our voices that are demanding it, it is 
the American people. 
Madam Speaker, I just want to say 
that I was here for September 11, and it 
was the Democrats who had to push for 
the 9/11 Commission. But even on that 
day, there were no Republicans or 
Democrats. There were no Northerners 
or Southerners or West Coast or East 
Coast. We were not red State or blue 
State. We were all simply Americans. 
And that is where we find ourselves 
today. 
Madam Speaker, I experienced at 
that time a gamut of emotions, as I did 
on January 6. Because of the Constitu-
tion, it is necessary that we move on 
this bill today. 
Madam Speaker, as Chair of the Judiciary 
Subcommittee on Crime, Homeland Security, 
and Terrorism, and a senior member of the 
Homeland Security, and Budget Committees, I 
rise in strong support of H. Res. 503, which 
establishes a Select Committee to Investigate 
the January 6 Attack on the Capitol Complex 
Act and charged with investigating and report-
ing upon the facts and causes of the January 
6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol as well as 
the influencing factors that may have provoked 
the attack on our democracy. 
Specifically, the Select Committee’s man-
date includes: 
1. examining and evaluating evidence devel-
oped by relevant Federal, State, and local 
governments, in a manner that is respectful of 
ongoing investigations, regarding the facts and 
circumstances of the attack; 
2. building upon other investigations regard-
ing the attack and targeted violence and do-
mestic terrorism related to such attack; and 
3. reporting its findings, conclusions, and 
recommendations for corrective measures 
taken to prevent future acts of targeted vio-
lence and domestic terrorism and improves 
the security posture of the United States Cap-
itol Complex in a manner that preserves the 
accessibility of the Capitol Complex for all 
Americans, and strengthen the security and 
resilience of nation and American democratic 
institutions against domestic terrorism. 
H. Res. 503 establishes a 13-person com-
mittee appointed by the Speaker, with five 
members appointed after consultation with the 
House Republican Leader. 
The Select Committee is authorized to issue 
subpoenas to secure information to carry out 
its investigation and is be required to issue a 
final report with findings regarding the facts 
and causes of the attack, along with rec-
ommendations to prevent future attacks on our 
democratic institutions . 
Like September 11, 2001, we cannot and 
must not ever forget the existential threat 
faced by our democracy on January 6, 2021, 
when thousands of domestic terrorists inspired 
by the 45th President stormed the U.S. Capitol 
in a violent, crazed, and desperate effort to 
disrupt the Joint Meeting of Congress pre-
scribed by the Constitution to tally the votes of 
presidential electors and announce the results 
to the nation and the world. 
Madam Speaker, the morning of September 
11, 2001 is, and will always be, a day like no 
other. 
It is a day all living Americans will remem-
ber because not since Pearl Harbor had there 
been such a dastardly and deadly attack on 
American soil. 
My heart still grieves for those who perished 
on flights United Airlines 93, American Airlines 
77, American Airlines 11, and United Airlines 
175. 
When the sun rose on the morning of Sep-
tember 11, none of us knew that it would end 
in an inferno in the magnificent World Trade 
Center Towers in New York City and the Pen-
tagon and in the grassy fields of Shanksville, 
Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, as hard as it is to believe, 
out of a tragedy so overwhelming and horrific, 
something good and great emerged in the 
aftermath of September 11. 
On that day there were no Republicans or 
Democrats; there were no Northerners or 
Southerners or West or East Coasters. 
We were not Red State or Blue State; we 
were all simply Americans. 
On that day, we were united in our shock 
and anger and sadness and in our resolve to 
defend our country and protect the freedoms 
that has made America the greatest country in 
the history of the world. 
I experienced the same gamut of emotions 
on January 6: grief, hope, resolve, and fierce 
commitment to protect our country. 
Madam Speaker, the assault on the U.S. 
Capitol by domestic terrorists and insurrection-
ists rightly takes its place as one of the dark-
est moments in our nation’s history since the 
Civil War. 
Madam Speaker, the January 6 insurrection 
caused tragic loss of life and many injuries, 
while leaving behind widespread physical 
damage to the Capitol Complex and emotional 
trauma for Members, Congressional employ-
ees, and the Capitol Police. 
It bears repeating often that the Congress 
and the nation owe undying gratitude to the 
men and women who answered the call of 
constitutional duty and heroically won the day 
on that bloody and deadly afternoon. 
That is why I introduced H. Res. 169, a res-
olution commending the officers of the United 
States Capitol Police Department, the Metro-
politan Police Department of Washington, DC, 
and other law enforcement personnel for their 
selfless and heroic service in defense of 
American democracy in responding to the as-
sault on the United States Capitol by domestic 
terrorists on January 6, 2021. 
H. Res. 169 notes that the January 6, 2021 
siege of the Capitol assault resulted in one of 
the worst days of injuries for law enforcement 
in the United States since the September 11,

2001, terrorist attacks but that the officers of 
the United States Capitol Police Department, 
the Metropolitan Police Department of Wash-
ington, DC, and other uniformed law enforce-
ment officers stood their ground in defense of 
American democracy while being attacked 
metal pipes, discharged chemical irritants, and 
other weapons. 
The resolution conveys the thanks and ap-
preciation of a grateful nation to them for their 
selfless and heroic service, encourages all 
educational and media institutions throughout 
the United States to teach and celebrate the 
story of their heroism and patriotism; and calls 
upon all Americans to read, celebrate, and re-
vere the Constitution of the United States, fi-
delity to which is the surest best means of 
forming a more perfect union, establishing jus-
tice, ensuring domestic tranquility, providing 
for the common defense, promoting the gen-
eral welfare, and securing the blessing of lib-
erty to them and their posterity. 
Madam Speaker, the domestic terrorists and 
seditionists who attacked the Capitol Building 
on January 6, 2021 were not, as some of their 
ardent defenders and apologists across the 
aisle have stated falsely, on a ‘‘normal tour 
visit’’; nor was their effort to lay siege to the 
Capitol and disrupt the processes of govern-
ment an act of persons who love their country. 
And it is absurd to suggest that it was a 
celebration of the United States and what it 
stands for when the leading edge of terrorists 
desecrated the Capitol by offensively parading 
the treasonous Confederate flag through the 
building and when, because of their insurrec-
tion, several members of law enforcement 
made the supreme sacrifice and scores more 
were seriously injured. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to take a few 
moments to explain why the intended purpose 
of the January 6 insurrection—to disrupt the 
Joint Meeting of Congress to tally the votes of 
presidential electors and announce the results 
to the nation and the world—was the greatest 
threat to the American Experiment since the 
Civil War when the proslavery forces would 
rather make war than let the nation survive 
and the pro-freedom forces would accept war 
rather than let the nation perish. 
Madam Speaker, the Framers had first-hand 
experience with the types of abuses and 
usurpations committed by political leaders who 
ruled them but were not accountable to them 
and detailed many of those wrongs in the 
Declaration of Independence. 
The Framers understood and declared to 
the world that democratic governors derived 
their powers from the knowing and voluntary 
consent of the governed as expressed in free, 
fair, and unfettered elections unmarred by the 
influence or sabotage of any foreign country or 
entity not a member of the political community. 
The Framers understood that if elections are 
influenced by foreign actors or authoritarian 
forces within, then voters are reduced from the 
great role of citizens to mere subjects, and 
government for and by the people is a sham. 
The most important feature of a democracy 
is that it is the voters who alone can confer 
the legitimate consent and authorization nec-
essary to govern upon the governors who are 
then duty-bound to represent the voters’ inter-
ests, and only their interests. 
Madam Speaker, the fundamental demo-
cratic compact between the governed and the 
governors is that the latter’s authority and con-
tinuance in office comes exclusively from the 
governed and allegiance is owed exclusively 
to the governed. 
This agreement can only be reached 
through free and fair elections, a breach of 
which threatens the vitality and viability of the 
social contract upon which democratic self-rule 
of, by, and for the people depends. 
Madam Speaker, President Lincoln called 
the United States the ‘‘last best hope of man 
on earth’’ and stated at Gettysburg the impor-
tance of finishing the work we are in to ensure 
that ‘‘government of the people, for the peo-
ple, by the people does not perish from the 
earth.’’ 
By our actions in voting to establish and 
empower a Select Committee to Investigate 
the January 6 Attack on the Capitol Complex, 
we are taking an indispensable step in ensur-
ing the preservation of our democracy, which 
has been the envy of the world for than 240 
years. 
I urge all Members to join me in voting for 
H. Res. 503, establishing a Select Committee 
to Investigate the January 6 Attack on the 
Capitol Complex Act.

Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. SPEIER). 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
My heart is racing right now, and I 
am trembling, in part because I am re-
calling what happened to me on Janu-
ary 6, when I was in that gallery and 
had to climb around the other side and 
then lie there on the floor. Then, I 
heard a shot ring out, and it took me 
back over 40 years ago, lying on an air-
strip in Guyana about to lose my life. 
I thought, at that moment: My God, I 
survived Guyana, but I am not going to 
survive this, in the house of democracy 
in the country in which I was born. 
For the Members on the other side of 
the aisle to call this political, let me 
remind you, it was political because 
the President of the United States at 
the time thought it was fun and an act 
of great patriotism to come up here 
and try to overturn the election. 
So, you may call it political; it was 
political. But we are going to find out 
why it happened, and we are going to 
make sure it never happens again. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
include in the RECORD the bipartisan 
Senate Homeland Security report. 
EXAMINING THE U.S. CAPITOL ATTACK: A RE-
VIEW OF THE SECURITY, PLANNING, AND RE-
SPONSE FAILURES ON JANUARY 6 
Committee on Homeland Security and Gov-
ernmental Affairs 
U.S. Senator GARY PETERS, Chair, 
U.S. Senator ROB PORTMAN, Ranking Member.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
On January 6, 2021, the world witnessed a 
violent and unprecedented attack on the 
U.S. Capitol, the Vice President, Members of 
Congress, and the democratic process. Riot-
ers, attempting to disrupt the Joint Session 
of Congress, broke into the Capitol building, 
vandalized and stole property, and ransacked 
offices. They attacked members of law en-
forcement and threatened the safety and 
lives of our nation’s elected leaders. Trag-
ically, seven individuals, including three law 
enforcement officers, ultimately lost their 
lives. 
Rioters were intent on disrupting the Joint 
Session, during which Members of Congress 
were scheduled to perform their constitu-
tional obligation to count the electoral votes 
for President and Vice President of the 
United States and announce the official re-
sults of the 2020 election. Due to the heroism 
of United States Capitol Police (‘‘USCP’’) of-
ficers, along with their federal, state, and 
local law enforcement partners, the rioters 
failed to prevent Congress from fulfilling its 
constitutional duty. In the early hours of 
January 7, the President of the Senate, Vice 
President Pence, announced Joseph Biden 
and Kamala Harris as the President-elect 
and Vice President-elect of the United 
States. 
This report addresses the security, plan-
ning, and response failures of the entities di-
rectly responsible for Capitol security— 
USCP and the Capitol Police Board, which is 
comprised of the House and Senate Ser-
geants at Arms and the Architect of the Cap-
itol as voting members, and the USCP Chief 
as a non-voting member—along with critical 
breakdowns involving several federal agen-
cies, particularly the Federal Bureau of In-
vestigation (‘‘FBI’’), Department of Home-
land Security (‘‘DHS’’), and Department of 
Defense (‘‘DOD’’). The Committees also made 
a series of recommendations for the Capitol 
Police Board, USCP, federal intelligence 
agencies, DOD, and other Capital region law 
enforcement agencies to address the intel-
ligence and security failures. 
The Committees’ investigation uncovered 
a number of intelligence and security fail-
ures leading up to and on January 6 that al-
lowed for the breach of the Capitol. These 
breakdowns ranged from federal intelligence 
agencies failing to warn of a potential for vi-
olence to a lack of planning and preparation 
by USCP and law enforcement leadership. 
The federal Intelligence Community—led 
by FBI and DHS—did not issue a threat as-
sessment warning of potential violence tar-
geting the Capitol on January 6. Law en-
forcement entities, including USCP, largely 
rely on FBI and DHS to assess and commu-
nicate homeland security threats. Through-
out 2020, the FBI and DHS disseminated writ-
ten documents detailing the potential for in-
creased violent extremist activity at lawful 
protests and targeting of law enforcement 
and government facilities and personnel. De-
spite online calls for violence at the Capitol, 
neither the FBI nor DHS issued a threat as-
sessment or intelligence bulletin warning 
law enforcement entities in the National 
Capital Region of the potential for violence. 
FBI and DHS officials stressed the difficulty 
in discerning constitutionally protected free 
speech versus actionable, credible threats of 
violence. In testimony before the Commit-
tees, officials from both FBI and DHS ac-
knowledged that the Intelligence Commu-
nity needs to improve its handling and dis-
semination of threat information from social 
media and online message boards. 
USCP’s intelligence components failed to 
convey the full scope of threat information 
they possessed. Although USCP mainly re-
lies on the FBI and DHS for intelligence and 
threat information, USCP has three compo-
nents responsible for intelligence-related ac-
tivities. These components, and the mate-
rials they produce, are supposed to inform 
USCP’s security and operational planning. 
This, however, was not the case for January 
6.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3331 
June 30, 2021 
USCP’s lead intelligence component—the 
Intelligence and Interagency Coordination 
Division (‘‘IICD’’)—was aware of the poten-
tial for violence in the days and weeks ahead 
of January 6. It received information from a 
variety of sources about threats of violence 
focused on the Joint Session and the Capitol 
Complex and the large crowds expected to 
gather in Washington, D.C. on January 6. 
Yet, IICD failed to fully incorporate this in-
formation into all of its internal assessments 
about January 6 and the Joint Session. As a 
result, 
critical 
information 
regarding 
threats of violence was not shared with 
USCP’s own officers and other law enforce-
ment partners. 
USCP’s preparations for the Joint Session 
also suffered because of the decentralized na-
ture of its intelligence components. On Janu-
ary 5, an employee in a separate USCP intel-
ligence-related component received informa-
tion from the FBI’s Norfolk Field Office re-
garding online discussions of violence di-
rected at Congress, including that protestors 
were coming to Congress ‘‘prepared for war.’’ 
This report, similar to other information re-
ceived by IICD, was never distributed to IICD 
or USCP leadership before January 6. 
USCP was not adequately prepared to pre-
vent or respond to the January 6 security 
threats, which contributed to the breach of 
the Capitol. Steven Sund, the USCP Chief on 
January 6, and Yogananda Pittman, who was 
designated as Acting Chief after Steven Sund 
announced his resignation on January 7, 
both attributed the breach of the Capitol to 
intelligence failures across the federal gov-
ernment. USCP leadership, however, also 
failed to prepare a department-wide oper-
ational plan for the Joint Session. Similarly, 
USCP leadership did not develop a com-
prehensive staffing plan for the Joint Ses-
sion detailing, among other things, where of-
ficers would be located. USCP could not pro-
vide the Committees any documents showing 
where officers were located at the start of 
the attack and how that changed throughout 
the attack. 
USCP leadership also failed to provide 
front-line officers with effective protective 
equipment or training. Although USCP acti-
vated seven specialty Civil Disturbance Unit 
(‘‘CDU’’) platoons in advance of the Joint 
Session, only four of those platoons were 
outfitted with special protective equipment, 
including helmets, hardened plastic armor, 
and shields. The many other USCP officers 
who fought to defend the Capitol were left to 
do so in their daily uniforms. Many of those 
front-line officers had not received training 
in basic civil disturbance tactics since their 
initial Recruit Officer Class training. While 
some CDU officers were issued special pro-
tective equipment, the platoons were not au-
thorized to wear the equipment at the begin-
ning of their shifts. Instead, USCP staged 
equipment on buses near the Capitol. In at 
least one instance, when the platoon at-
tempted to retrieve the equipment, the bus 
was locked, leaving the platoon without ac-
cess to this critical equipment. USCP also 
failed to provide equipment training to sup-
port the CDU platoons and did not authorize 
CDU platoons to use all available less-than- 
lethal munitions, which could have enhanced 
officers’ ability to push back rioters. 
These operational failures were exacer-
bated by leadership’s failure to clearly com-
municate during the attack. USCP leader-
ship gathered in a command center, blocks 
away from the Capitol building. Two inci-
dent commanders identified as responsible 
for relaying information to front-line offi-
cers were forced to engage with rioters dur-
ing the attack, making it difficult for them 
to relay information. As a result, commu-
nications were chaotic, sporadic, and, ac-
cording to many front-line officers, non-ex-
istent. 
Opaque processes and a lack of emergency 
authority delayed requests for National 
Guard assistance. The USCP Chief has no 
unilateral authority to request assistance 
from the National Guard; the USCP Chief 
must submit a request for assistance to the 
Capitol Police Board for approval. Steven 
Sund never submitted a formal request to 
the Capitol Police Board for National Guard 
support in advance of January 6. Instead, 
Steven Sund had informal conversations 
with the House Sergeant at Arms, Paul Ir-
ving, and the Senate Sergeant at Arms, Mi-
chael Stenger, regarding the potential need 
for National Guard support. No one ever dis-
cussed the possibility of National Guard sup-
port with the Architect of the Capitol, the 
third voting member of the Capitol Police 
Board. 
The members of the Capitol Police Board 
who were in charge on January 6 did not ap-
pear to be fully familiar with the statutory 
and regulatory requirements for requesting 
National Guard support, which contributed 
to the delay in deploying the National Guard 
to the Capitol. In their testimony before the 
Committees, Paul Irving and Steven Sund of-
fered different accounts of when Steven Sund 
first requested National Guard assistance 
during the attack. Phone records reveal a 
number of conversations between Steven 
Sund and Paul Irving on January 6. However, 
because there is no transcription of the con-
versations, there is no way for the Commit-
tees to determine when the request was 
made. National Guard assistance was de-
layed while Steven Sund attempted to con-
tact the Capitol Police Board members and 
obtain the required approvals. Regardless of 
what time the request was made, the need to 
await Capitol Police Board approval during 
an emergency hindered the ability to request 
District 
of 
Columbia 
National 
Guard 
(‘‘DCNG’’) assistance quickly. 
The intelligence failures, coupled with the 
Capitol Police Board’s failure to request Na-
tional Guard assistance prior to January 6, 
meant DCNG was not activated, staged, and 
prepared to quickly respond to an attack on 
the Capitol. As the attack unfolded, DOD re-
quired time to approve the request and gath-
er, equip, and instruct its personnel on the 
mission, which resulted in additional delays. 
Prior to January 6, USCP informed DOD offi-
cials on two separate occasions that it was 
not seeking DCNG assistance for the Joint 
Session of Congress. The D.C. government, 
by contrast, did request unarmed troops for 
traffic support, and on January 6, 154 un-
armed DCNG personnel were staged at traffic 
control points throughout the city. As the 
attack unfolded, USCP and the Metropolitan 
Police Department of the District of Colum-
bia (‘‘MPD’’) both pleaded with DOD officials 
for immediate assistance. DOD officials 
claimed they received a ‘‘workable’’ request 
for assistance from USCP at approximately 
2:30 p.m. The request was presented to the 
Acting Secretary of Defense and approved at 
approximately 3:00 p.m. For the next ninety 
minutes, DOD officials ordered DCNG per-
sonnel to return to the Armory, obtain nec-
essary gear, and prepare for deployment as 
leaders quickly prepared a mission plan. 
Miscommunication and confusion during re-
sponse preparations, demonstrated by con-
flicting records about who authorized de-
ployment and at what time, contributed to 
the delayed deployment. DCNG began arriv-
ing at the Capitol Complex at 5:20 p.m.— 
nearly three hours after DOD received 
USCP’s request for assistance and more than 
four hours after the barriers at the Capitol 
were first breached. 
The Committees’ Recommendations 
Based on the findings of the investigation, 
the Committees identified a number of rec-
ommendations to address the intelligence 
and security failures leading up to and on 
January 6. Recommendations specific to the 
Capitol Complex include empowering the 
USCP Chief to request assistance from the 
DCNG in emergency situations and passing 
legislation to clarify the statutes governing 
requests for assistance from executive agen-
cies and departments in nonemergency situa-
tions. To address the preparedness of the 
USCP, the Committees recommend improve-
ments to training, equipment, intelligence 
collection, and operational planning. 
The Committees further recommend intel-
ligence agencies review and evaluate criteria 
for issuing and communicating intelligence 
assessments and the establishment of stand-
ing ‘‘concept of operation’’ scenarios and 
contingency plans to improve DOD and 
DCNG response to civil disturbance and ter-
rorism incidents. These scenarios and plans 
should detail what level of DOD or DCNG as-
sistance may be required, what equipment 
would be needed for responding personnel, 
and the plan for command-and-control dur-
ing the response. 
The Committees’ Investigation 
Two days after the January 6 attack, the 
Senate Committee on Rules and Administra-
tion and Senate Homeland Security and Gov-
ernmental Affairs Committee announced a 
joint bipartisan oversight investigation to 
examine the intelligence and security fail-
ures that led to the attack. On February 23, 
2021, the Committees held the first public 
oversight hearing on the attack. The hear-
ing, entitled Examining the January 6 At-
tack on the U.S. Capitol, featured testimony 
from the USCP Chief, House Sergeant at 
Arms, and Senate Sergeant at Arms in 
charge on January 6. The Committees also 
heard testimony from the Acting Chief of 
MPD. One week later, on March 3, 2021, the 
Committees held a second oversight hearing, 
which included witnesses from DOD, DCNG, 
FBI, and DHS. 
As part of their investigation, the Commit-
tees reviewed thousands of documents. The 
Committees also received written state-
ments from more than 50 USCP officers 
about their experiences. In addition, the 
Committees interviewed numerous current 
and former officials from USCP, Senate Ser-
geant at Arms, House Sergeant at Arms, Ar-
chitect of the Capitol, FBI, DHS, MPD, DOD, 
and DCNG. Most entities cooperated with 
the Committees’ requests. There were nota-
ble exceptions, however: the Department of 
Justice and DHS have yet to fully comply 
with the Committees’ requests for informa-
tion, the Office of the House of Representa-
tives Sergeant at Arms did not comply with 
the Committees’ information requests, and a 
USCP Deputy Chief of Police declined to be 
interviewed by the Committees. The Com-
mittees will continue to pursue responses 
from those who have failed to fully comply. 
The oversight of events related to January 6, 
including intelligence and security failures, 
will continue. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I know we do live in 
a highly polarized time, but despite the 
partisanship that so often plagues the 
House of Representatives, there is no 
reason this select committee should 
not be wholly bipartisan. In fact, that 
is what the American people demand. 
Unfortunately, the resolution en-
sures that bipartisanship will not hap-
pen. The result will be a divided report 
focused more on a narrative than a so-
lution, and that is why I asked that we

June 30, 2021 
submit that Senate report as part of 
the RECORD. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I have great respect 
for the gentlewoman. We serve on the 
Rules Committee together, and she has 
a tough job here today. But, I mean, 
come on. Give me a break. 
I mean, we had a bipartisan commis-
sion, equally divided, equal subpoena 
power, and they voted against it. The 
minority leader of this House whipped 
against it and fought against it and 
convinced the Senate to try to kill it. 
I have noticed that there is a lack of 
Republicans who have the backbone to 
come down here and explain to the 
American people why they won’t sup-
port the bipartisan commission or this 
select commission, because they don’t 
want to be on record as defending a po-
sition aimed at not getting to the 
truth. 
This is a moment that, quite frankly, 
people are going to remember. I best 
point that out because it is stunning to 
me. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the 
distinguished 
gentleman 
from 
Maryland (Mr. HOYER), the majority 
leader. 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, the 
American public watching this debate 
must think that some of the verbiage 
was written by Lewis Carroll. Lewis 
Carroll, of course, wrote ‘‘Alice in Won-
derland,’’ where up was down, black 
was white, left was right, and right was 
left. 
There is an advantage, I would tell 
you, of not having served here for some 
time because you don’t know what hap-
pened in the past. The gentlewoman 
who represents the Rules Committee 
said, gee, there have been other inves-
tigations. 
I remember how outraged I was when 
the Republicans had the eighth inves-
tigation of Benghazi, outraged not only 
because, as it has been opined by the 
gentlewoman, that, oh, we looked at 
this, but because for the first seven 
times, 
they 
found 
nothing 
there, 
‘‘they’’ being the Republicans. And so, 
they logically concluded, we need to 
have another study until we get the an-
swer we want. 
Lo and behold, the investigator, Mr. 
Gowdy, felt to be a person of extraor-
dinary intellect, which he was, had a 
study, a partisan study, and found ex-
actly the same outcome. 
The studies to date have found that 
there were many things done wrong, 
but they were limited in their scope, 
which is, of course, the one thing that 
the Republicans wanted to do with the 
bipartisan commission they asked for, 
that the Speaker gave them: five 
Democrats, five Republicans; equal 
power over subpoenas. And the staff-
ing, clearly, had been worked out on 
the Senate side. 
In the final analysis, the issue was 
really: See no evil, hear no evil, speak 
no evil. 
Madam Speaker, like many of our 
colleagues and many Americans, I had 
hoped that Congress would establish a 
bipartisan commission to investigate 
the terrible, tragic, almost unthink-
able events of January 6, when we saw 
Americans assault this Capitol, these 
Representatives on this floor and the 
floor down the hall, calling for the 
death of the Vice President of the 
United States and the Speaker of the 
House, one of the most tragic events in 
the history of our country. 
The House brought a bill to this 
floor. The Speaker brought to this 
floor what the minority leader asked 
for, except for one thing, scope, the 
fear that we would look at the very es-
sence of what January 6 was about. 
Yes, some accuse us of concluding 
that, because the President recruited 
people to come to Washington, incited 
them in a fiery speech, and then de-
ployed them to the Capitol of the 
United States, Heaven forbid that we 
would look at him as being a cause of 
that event. That is only three things 
that he did. 
The House voted on May 19 to do ex-
actly that. And then what happened? 
Well, the Republicans all voted against 
it. Not everyone, strike that. There 
were a few courageous souls that did 
vote for it because they wanted to see 
the truth and get the truth. In fact, 
some of them articulated the truth, 
and to that extent, their party kicked 
them out of the leadership. 
That is what they said: See no evil, 
hear no evil, speak no evil. The Bible 
says the truth shall set you free, and 
the people need to know the truth be-
cause that is what will keep them free. 
We voted, with hopes that the Senate 
would concur in the House’s judgment, 
that a bipartisan commission con-
sistent with what Leader MCCARTHY 
asked for, except for scope—we wanted 
the commission to be able to look at 
the event that was the cause of the 
commission’s 
creation. 
Afterward, 
however, the former President tweeted: 
‘‘Republicans in the House and Senate 
should not approve the Democratic 
trap of the January 6 commission.’’ 
What was the truth? That was the 
trap. That was the trap that the Presi-
dent feared. See no evil, hear no evil, 
speak no evil. 
The Senate was forced to choose be-
tween a bipartisan process that many 
Republicans had earlier supported—you 
remember, of course, that the ranking 
member of the committee that re-
ported out the commission bill sup-
ported it and urged his colleagues to do 
so as well. It was not a partisan effort; 
it was a bipartisan effort. But, of 
course, Mr. Trump hadn’t spoken at 
that point in time. 
They were forced to choose between 
the President and the truth. Sadly, 
they chose former President Trump, 
not truth. 
However, the American people are 
still demanding answers and account-
ability, and they deserve both. They 
want to know that steps are being 
taken to understand what happened 
and take measures to ensure that it 
never happens again. It had never hap-
pened before, and we don’t want it to 
happen again. 
Just like after the 9/11 attacks, we 
need to come together, as we did after 
9/11, to ensure that a full investigation 
is conducted on an independent and bi-
partisan basis. 
Now, yes, this select committee is 
not even, as other investigative com-
mittees have not been even. We would 
prefer even, which is why we brought it 
to the floor. Mr. KATKO preferred even, 
which is why we brought it to the floor. 
Mr. MCCARTHY
had asked for even, 
which is why we brought even to the 
floor. Sadly, House and Senate Repub-
licans made it impossible to establish a 
commission on a bipartisan basis be-
cause you have reached your conclu-
sion. And your conclusion is: Let’s 
move on. Let bygones be bygones. Let 
the past be forgotten. 
Who said that? JOHN THUNE. He said: 
We don’t want to—the gentlewoman 
has said it. All they want to do is drag 
this on because we don’t want it to ad-
versely affect our election. That is 
what was said. Senator THUNE essen-
tially said that. 
Notwithstanding that, the House is 
going to do its job, and we are going to 
create this select committee to achieve 
the goal of truth. We will do it on be-
half of the people we represent, who 
watched in horror as their Capitol was 
assaulted by a violent mob bent on 
overturning a United States election. 
That is insurrection. 
The people who thought it was a 
tourist visit I don’t think were on the 
floor. You heard the gentlewoman from 
California talk about her experience. It 
was not a tourist experience. 
I hope my Republican friends will 
participate in this committee’s work in 
good faith with their Democratic col-
leagues to carry out its mission. If 
they see things being done that are not 
the truth, then they ought to tell the 
truth. They ought to bring up the facts 
as they see them. 
That is what our adversary system is. 
We have an adversary system here in 
this House. We have an adversary sys-
tem in our legal system. Engage, be in-
volved, raise the flag as you see it. 
b 1445 
I hope we can come together to cre-
ate the bipartisan commission so many 
have sought and still seek. The launch-
ing of this new select committee will 
not preclude the alternative objective. 
So I urge my colleagues to join me in 
passing this resolution today, and I 
hope we can begin to uncover exactly 
what happened and take responsible 
steps to prevent the events of January 
6 from reoccurring, and, yes, find out 
who is responsible. 
Who is responsible for inciting a mob 
to come to the Capitol of the United 
States to overturn the election of the 
President of the United States? 
That was their stated intent.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3333 
June 30, 2021 
Madam Speaker, I urge a strong vote 
for this select committee Americans 
deserve and want and let us pray they 
get the truth. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Ohio (Mr. WENSTRUP). 
Mr. WENSTRUP. Madam Speaker, I 
have heard it mentioned here today 
Democrats telling us why we voted 
against the bill. They didn’t ask us. 
I can tell you why I voted against the 
bill before. And I think it is known by 
the other side, because I offered an 
amendment to this bill for a commis-
sion, that if you are very serious and 
curious about the defense posture of 
this building and the posture of those 
who work in it, then would you please 
include in this commission to inves-
tigate and look at the events of June 
14, 2017, at the baseball field? 
Do you know what, Madam Speaker? 
There weren’t any Democrats there 
that day except for one, the one that 
tried to kill us. 
Madam Speaker, you talked about an 
insurrection. If not for the Capitol Po-
lice being there that day, 20 to 30 Mem-
bers of Congress from the House of 
Representatives on the Republican side 
may have been assassinated that day 
changing the balance of power in this 
Congress. 
That is an insurrection. 
Why is it the Democrats voted that 
down to include that as part of the 
commission? 
No one could explain that. It has all 
got to be about one event. 
I do not condone for one second what 
happened here on January 6—not for 
one second—but if you are serious, 
Madam Speaker, about looking at what 
we need and what goes on and what in-
spires people to attack this building 
and the people who work here, then 
let’s take a look at everything. 
Why aren’t we including the event on 
Good Friday when the gentleman drove 
up and killed a Capitol Policeman? 
He could have had a car full of explo-
sives and pulled a Timothy McVeigh- 
type of event. 
Why are we not looking at that as 
well? 
This is incomplete, and it is insuffi-
cient. 
After the events on June 14, 2017, 
Speaker Paul Ryan stood in this Cham-
ber and got applause from both sides of 
the aisle when he said: ‘‘An attack on 
one of us is an attack on all of us.’’ 
We didn’t hear that this time, did 
we? 
No, we did not. 
This has been created as a partisan 
issue at a time when it should not be 
partisan. If you are not partisan, 
Madam Speaker, then you include all 
the things that threaten us, that 
threaten this body, that threaten this 
building, and that threaten the people 
who work in it. 
Let’s be serious. If you are serious, be 
inclusive, be complete, and do the right 
thing. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. May I inquire of the 
gentlewoman how many speakers re-
main on her side. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, 
that is it. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
have one additional speaker. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I want to just cor-
rect the RECORD on what the previous 
speaker has just said. The bill that he 
referred to was not written by Demo-
crats. The bill that he referred to, the 
bipartisan commission, was written by 
Democrats and Republicans. It was 
written in consultation by the minor-
ity leader’s designee, Mr. KATKO. It was 
presented to the Rules Committee in a 
bipartisan way. This was a bipartisan 
product. 
I share the gentleman’s outrage over 
the attack against the shooting of Re-
publican Members, including the dis-
tinguished minority whip, during that 
baseball practice. But I would just say 
to the gentleman, respectfully, my 
friends on the other side of the aisle 
were in charge of this institution then. 
They could have called for an inde-
pendent committee to look into that, 
and I think all of us would have sup-
ported that. 
Let me just say, Madam Speaker, 
that I assume many of my colleagues 
on the other side of the aisle are get-
ting their talking points from the mi-
nority leader. 
I have to tell you, Madam Speaker, I 
get why the mother of Officer Sicknick 
who lost his life defending us on Janu-
ary 6 said yesterday that she was dis-
appointed with her meeting with Mi-
nority Leader MCCARTHY. 
I was hoping that maybe the minor-
ity leader would come to the floor and 
explain to us why he objected to the bi-
partisan commission, why he objects to 
the select committee, and why he ob-
jects to getting to the truth. But ap-
parently he is not coming. Because, 
Madam Speaker, there was no rational 
explanation for putting up roadblocks 
to get to the truth unless you are try-
ing to keep it hidden. 
I am reminded of that old line: If you 
have got nothing to hide, you have got 
nothing to fear. 
So what are my Republican friends so 
afraid of, Madam Speaker? 
Does a defeated and disgraced Presi-
dent hold so much sway that they are 
forever unwilling to investigate what 
happened here? 
There was an insurrection in the 
United States of America, and each of 
us not only has the ability to figure 
out what happened, but we have an ob-
ligation to do so. An obligation that is 
more important than party and should 
come before the whims of any one man, 
and that includes the former occupant 
of the White House. So I urge my col-
leagues to uphold that solemn duty 
today. 
Our system of government isn’t guar-
anteed. It is a choice. Keeping it takes 
work, and it is time we finally did the 
work of defending our democracy after 
a literal insurrection and allow the 
process of getting to the bottom of 
what happened on January 6 com-
mence. 
I was here. I was presiding over the 
House when this attack happened. I as-
sumed the chair after the Speaker left. 
I went out into the hallway, and I saw 
these people who were crazed trying to 
get at us. My colleagues were here. Our 
staff was here. The people who support 
this campus were here. 
The Capitol Police protected us. I 
mean, I get it. My friends have turned 
this into some sort of partisan issue. It 
isn’t. 
Please, I hope everybody before they 
vote will think of not just Donald 
Trump or not just what the minority 
leader instructs them to do, but think 
of our police who defended us, think of 
their staff who put their lives at risk, 
and think of everybody who works on 
this campus. They deserve a hell of a 
lot better than what they are getting 
here today. 
So, Madam Speaker, I urge all of my 
colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on the select 
committee, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time to 
close. 
Madam Speaker, I oppose H. Res. 503. 
The events of January 6 were tragic in 
so many ways and certainly demand a 
real investigation, but bipartisan in-
vestigations have already taken place 
in the Senate, and law enforcement 
also continues to investigate. 
We all share the concern for what 
happened here in Washington, D.C., on 
that day, and it can never happen 
again. But unless Democrats abandon 
their desires for a predetermined out-
come, we are doing the American peo-
ple a disservice. 
Moving forward and making sure 
that it never happens again requires a 
fully bipartisan solution, not a par-
tisan committee rigged from the start. 
This resolution is rife with partisan 
politics at its worst. 
Madam Speaker, I urge Members to 
oppose H. Res. 503, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
PELOSI). 
Ms. 
PELOSI. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding and 
for his bringing this important legisla-
tion to the floor. I thank our distin-
guished majority leader for his clarity 
in presenting the case for this legisla-
tion and all of our colleagues who have 
come to the floor on the Democratic 
side in the search of truth, justice, and 
security for our country. 
Madam Speaker, I particularly thank 
Mr. MCGOVERN because on the night of 
this insurrection, I was in the chair, 
the security came and pulled me out. 
He took the chair. He risked his life to 
take the chair as the assaulters of our 
Capitol were out to get me with a bul-
let in the head or to hang the Vice

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3334 
June 30, 2021 
President of the United States, assault 
the lives of Members of Congress, trau-
matize our staff, and disrespect the 
workers in the Capitol. 
It was not an ordinary tourist day in 
the Capitol as the Republicans have 
characterized. Republicans have char-
acterized it as a normal day in the Con-
gress, when we have pictures of those 
very same people pushing furniture 
against the door to keep the intruders 
out. 
We are under the dome of the Cap-
itol, a dome that was built by Abraham 
Lincoln during the Civil War when peo-
ple said to him: No, we need the steel, 
the this and the that to fight the war. 
He said: No, we need to show our de-
termination. 
Madam Speaker, 1 year into the dev-
astation of the Civil War, President 
Abraham Lincoln sent a message to 
Congress imploring Members to join as 
one to save the Union. 
He said: ‘‘Fellow-citizens, we cannot 
escape history. We of this Congress and 
this administration, will be remem-
bered in spite of ourselves. No personal 
significance, 
or 
insignificance, 
can 
spare one or another of us. The fiery 
trial through which we pass, will light 
us down, in honor or dishonor, to the 
latest generation.’’ 
Madam Speaker, today we go on 
record. We too have a responsibility, as 
was described by President Lincoln. We 
too cannot escape history. We have a 
duty to the Constitution and to the 
American people to find the truth of 
January 6 and to ensure that such an 
assault on our Democracy can never 
happen again. 
Rather than being frivolous with the 
facts, we are going to be prayerful and 
patriotic and honor the concerns of the 
American people by seeking and find-
ing the truth to protect our country 
from any future or similar assault. 
As has been said many times, that 
day, January 6, was one of the darkest 
days of our history. For the Members, 
the police officers, the staff, the press, 
and the support workers who were 
there, the memory of that day remains 
seared in our memory: the sounds of 
glass shattering, officers fighting, riot-
ers chanting, the smell of teargas and 
the taste of smoke in the air and the 
sight of people fleeing the Capitol or 
barricading doors as Republicans and 
Democrats did that night, and the 
sense of terror, hundreds of people fear-
ing for their lives. 
In the aftermath, over 140 members 
of law enforcement were physically and 
seriously harmed, five people died, and 
staff, workers, press, and Members 
were and still remain traumatized by 
the experience. 
The sheer scale of the violence of 
that day is shocking. But what is just 
as shocking is remembering why this 
violence occurred: to block the certifi-
cation of an election and the peaceful 
transfer of power that is the corner-
stone of our Democracy. It was a date 
actually required by the Constitution. 
It was not just another tourist day in 
the Capitol. 
Congress returned to the Capitol that 
same night to accomplish our constitu-
tional duty—that same night. Thanks 
to the workers, the maintenance people 
here, the Capitol Police, and the rest, 
we were able to return and send a mes-
sage to the world that this Congress 
would honor its constitutional duties 
regardless of the assault that was made 
on it. 
This was important, and it was bipar-
tisan in the decision. Mr. HOYER and 
Mr. MCCONNELL agreed that we would 
come back. 
Where others were saying: Go to an 
undisclosed location; we said: No, we 
are going to the Capitol. 
Congress returned to the Capitol, as I 
said, to honor that responsibility. We 
showed the insurrectionists, the coun-
try, and the world that we would not be 
diverted from our duty. We could do 
that because of the courage of the Cap-
itol Police, the Metropolitan Police, 
and other law enforcement, some of 
whom are with us today. 
b 1500 
I especially want to recognize Gladys 
Sicknick, the mother of Brian, who 
gave his life; and Sandra Garza, his 
friend and partner. 
But it is clear that January 6 was not 
simply an attack on the Capitol build-
ing. It was an attack on our democ-
racy. Every Member here knows that 
January 6 was an attempt to subvert 
our democracy. 
But many across the aisle refuse to 
admit the truth. They refused to admit 
the truth when they voted against cer-
tifying President Biden’s election that 
night. They refused to admit the truth 
when they voted against the creating 
of a bipartisan commission to inves-
tigate the attack. They refused to 
admit the truth when they called that 
day a ‘‘normal tourist visit.’’ 
And, today, when many will vote 
against establishing a select com-
mittee to investigate that day, they 
will, again, refuse to admit the truth. 
But they did that; 100 percent of them 
voted ‘‘no’’ against putting resources 
to ensure the security of our Capitol 
Police and the security of this build-
ing. 175 Republicans voted ‘‘no’’ when 
it came time for the commission, 35 
‘‘yeses’’ on the Republican side. 
I am heartbroken that we don’t have 
the bipartisan commission. We yielded 
on every point. 
Numbers, as Mr. HOYER
said, the 
numbers, the process for subpoenas, 
the timing, and further yielded on the 
Senate side on timing again, as well as 
clarification on staffing, that was 
never in doubt, but they wanted fur-
ther clarification. 
They thought—the Republican Sen-
ators thought that they could win the 
day over there. They thought they 
could. And they thought they had the 
votes, until the Minority Leader of the 
Senate, MITCH MCCONNELL, asked them 
to do him a personal favor and vote 
against the commission. 
Too many of them chose to do MITCH 
MCCONNELL
a personal favor rather 
than to perform their patriotic duty. 
And, hence, despite the fact that seven 
Republican Members either voted or 
said they would vote for the commis-
sion, it was defeated. 
They said: Give us another week; 
give us another week; give us another 
week; give us another week. 
Now it is almost—well, it is 41⁄2 
weeks, and we must go forward. 
It does not appear at this time that 
we can have a bipartisan commission, 
outside commission. Hopefully, that 
could still happen. But, in the mean-
time, we will have a select committee. 
This is not unlike what happened in 
2001, at the time of the 9/11 Commis-
sion. 9/11 happened exactly then, 9/11/ 
2001. It took more than 1 year to get 
the commission. It was signed into law 
by the President on November 27, 2002. 
In the meantime, there was a Con-
gressional investigation, which was 
useful to the commission when they fi-
nally were formed. So perhaps we can 
still hope for that, but we cannot wait 
for it. 
To do that, we believe that Congress 
must, in the spirit of bipartisanship 
and patriotism, establish this commis-
sion. And it will be conducted with dig-
nity, with patriotism, with respect for 
the American people so that they can 
know the truth. 
It is a funny thing about MITCH say-
ing he wanted them to do him a per-
sonal favor. Oh, my goodness. 
We had a commission on this side of 
the Capitol. BENNIE THOMPSON, our dis-
tinguished chair of the Homeland Secu-
rity Committee, working with the 
ranking member of the committee, Mr. 
KATKO, put together a bipartisan com-
mission. Only 35 Republicans voted for 
it, even though we responded to every 
one of their concerns, except, as Mr. 
HOYER said, scope. Scope. They just did 
not want to go to the truth, sadly. 
That is why there will be—and, 
today, we are establishing—a select 
committee on the January 6 insurrec-
tion. It will investigate and report 
upon the facts and causes of the at-
tack. It will report on conclusions and 
recommendations for preventing any 
future assault. And it will find the 
truth, which, clearly, the Republicans 
fear; but, hopefully, not across the 
country. 
This committee is about our secu-
rity, ensuring that a future attack does 
not happen. It is about patriotism and 
democracy, ensuring that Congress can 
continue to serve the American people. 
Mr. HOYER
rightfully pointed out 
that, as the other side likes to say, oh, 
the Senate did a bipartisan—they were 
very limited in what they were allowed 
to do. They were only allowed to inves-
tigate the security of the building, not 
the cause of it, not the fact that it was 
an insurrection incited by the execu-
tive branch. None of that was allowed. 
So don’t use that as an excuse not to 
have a fuller investigation of the un-
derlying causes of what happened, the 
underlying causes of white suprema-
cists and anti-Semites; one man with a

Camp Auschwitz shirt on: Six million 
are not enough. 
You would think they would reject 
that. Not just a normal day of tourism 
in the Capitol. 
In that message to the Congress that 
I quoted in the beginning from Presi-
dent Lincoln, it concluded by clearly 
declaring: ‘‘We shall nobly save, or 
meanly lose, the last best hope of 
Earth. The way is plain, peaceful, gen-
erous, just—a way which, if followed, 
the world will forever applaud, and God 
must forever bless.’’ 
He also said: ‘‘We know how to save 
the Union. The world knows we do 
know how to save it. We . . . hold the 
power, and bear the responsibility.’’ 
Today, we, too, hold the power and 
bear the responsibility. Let all Mem-
bers do what is right and vote for this 
legislation. We will be judged by future 
generations as to how we value our de-
mocracy. Let’s be on the right side not 
only of history, but the right side of 
the future. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘aye.’’ 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
for debate has expired. 
Pursuant to House Resolution 504, 
the previous question is ordered on the 
resolution and the preamble. 
The question is on the resolution.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the amendment offered 
by the gentleman from California (Mr. 
DESAULNIER). 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, on that I demand the yeas 
and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this question are 
postponed. 
(By unanimous consent, Ms. PELOSI 
was allowed to speak out of order.) 
TRIBUTE TO DIANE DEWHIRST AND PATTI ROSS 
Ms. PELOSI. Madam Speaker, it is 
with great official pride and personal 
pride, but some sadness, that I rise to 
honor the dedicated service of two de-
parting members of the Speaker’s staff: 
my 
deputy 
chief 
of 
staff, 
Diane 
Dewhirst; and my senior policy advi-
sor, Patti Ross. 
Diane Dewhirst is a pillar of the 
Speaker’s office and of our caucus. In-
deed, there are few Members who do 
not know Diane, and even fewer who 
are unfamiliar with her skills and her 
contributions. 
Diane 
has 
dedicated 
decades 
to 
Democratic politics, ever since, as a 
college student, she borrowed her fa-
ther’s red Buick Skylark to drive 
across Illinois to campaign for the leg-
endary Congressman Abner Mikva. 
And she has remained in the political 
arena ever since; working in the DNC 
and DSCC; holding positions in the 
Clinton administration in not one, but 
six agencies; serving in Senator George 
Mitchell’s office; and then serving as a 
key member of my office when I was 
leader and now Speaker. 
Her interest in politics sprang from 
her commitment to the values of our 
country and her patriotic spirit. She 
has a trusted voice, bringing extensive 
experience, sound judgment, and re-
markable institutional knowledge to 
our legislative work. 
I know that she takes great pride in 
our work for women and families, par-
ticularly in what is my proudest offi-
cial moment as Speaker: The passage 
of the Affordable Care Act, which has 
delivered quality healthcare to mil-
lions of Americans. 
Diane has made a difference in this 
institution that transcends the polit-
ical, the policy, and the legislative 
realm. Over her 15 years in my office, 
she has been an outstanding mentor 
and role model to many, particularly 
young women. She has dedicated her 
service to this truth, as I always say: 
‘‘When women succeed, America suc-
ceeds.’’ 
Diane’s love of the arts is well 
known. She has represented my office 
in our work with leading cultural insti-
tutions, including the Smithsonian, 
the Kennedy Center, the Library of 
Congress, the National Archives, and 
the National Gallery of Art. Given her 
passion and experience in this arena, it 
is fitting that she is leaving Capitol 
Hill for the National Endowment for 
the Arts. 
Inscribed in the marble facade of the 
Kennedy Center are President John F. 
Kennedy’s powerful words: ‘‘The life of 
the arts, far from being an interrup-
tion, a distraction, in the life of the na-
tion, is very close to the center of a na-
tion’s purpose . . . and is a test of the 
quality of a nation’s civilization.’’ 
At the NEA, Diane’s passion for the 
‘‘life of the arts’’ will serve this Na-
tion’s purpose well. 
On behalf of the House of Representa-
tives, I thank Diane. I wish her and her

husband, Bob; and her children, Jo-
Anna, Billy, and Rob, much happiness 
as she begins this next phase. 
Thank you very much, Diane. 
I thank the Biden administration for 
taking my staff. 
Also departing this week is our sen-
ior policy advisor, Patti Ross. Patti is, 
simply, the gold standard of public 
service. Indeed, President Biden chose 
an expert of domestic policymaking in 
appointing Patti Ross to serve as As-
sistant Secretary for the Office of Con-
gressional and Legislative Affairs at 
the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
Patti has served in my office for over 
a decade, where she has been an invalu-
able asset to all of us; our caucus; in-
deed, the entire Congress. 
Her portfolio spans a major portion 
of domestic policy: agriculture, nutri-
tion, education and labor, veterans, 
military families, and caregivers. 
Patti has earned the respect of Mem-
bers and staff on both sides of the aisle 
for all her legislative acumen and ac-
complishments, but particularly for 
her ironclad commitment to our vet-
erans. Coming from a long line of vet-
erans in her family, this dedication is 
in her DNA. 
As Speaker, I have seen her commit-
ment firsthand, including her work 
leading the VSO roundtables, which en-
sure that those who have donned the 
uniform have a seat at the decision-
making table. 
Indeed, one of the many strengths 
that Patti brings is her experience as a 
consensus finder and a coalition build-
er; a leader with the courage and the 
character to fight to ensure that Con-
gress and veterans have a voice at the 
VA. 
The unanimous confirmation of Patti 
Ross last week was, therefore, a joyous 
victory for America’s veterans and 
their families and caregivers. 
When I spoke at Patti’s confirmation 
hearing, I relayed an anecdote from a 
congressional delegation visit that she 
helped plan. This was to France for the 
75th anniversary of the Allied D-day 
landings in Normandy and to Belgium 
and Luxembourg for the anniversary of 
the Battle of the Bulge. 
During that visit, we were honored, 
as we often have been on those visits, 
to meet with World War II veterans, in-
cluding one man in his nineties, whose 
message to us all was simply: ‘‘Pray for 
peace.’’ 
As I said at her hearing, ‘‘It is with 
great confidence that I can say that 
Patti Ross, if confirmed, will be a pow-
erful force for peace for our veterans, 
their families, and caregivers.’’ 
On behalf of the Congress, I con-
gratulate Patti on her well-deserved 
recognition. Congratulations also to 
her family and partner, Tim. 
I thank both Diane and Patti for 
their consequential service and wish 
them much success in their new capac-
ity in the Biden administration. 
AMENDMENT OFFERED BY MR. DESAULNIER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, the unfin-
ished business is the question on the 
amendment to House Resolution 508 of-
fered by the gentleman from California 
(Mr. DESAULNIER) on which the yeas 
prevailed by voice vote, and on which 
the yeas and nays were ordered. 
The 
Clerk 
will 
redesignate 
the 
amendment. 
The Clerk redesignated the amend-
ment.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE

June 30, 2021 
subsection (a) shall be administered as if appor-
tioned under chapter 1 of title 23, United States 
Code. 
(c) DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS ENTERPRISES.— 
(1) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that— 
(A) despite the real improvements caused by 
the disadvantaged business enterprise program, 
minority- and women-owned businesses across 
the country continue to confront serious and 
significant obstacles to success caused by race 
and gender discrimination in the federally as-
sisted surface transportation market and related 
markets across the United States; 
(B) the continuing race and gender discrimi-
nation described in subparagraph (A) merits the 
continuation of the disadvantaged business en-
terprise program; 
(C) recently, the disparities cause by discrimi-
nation against African American, Hispanic 
American, Asian American, Native American, 
and women business owners have been further 
exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic and 
its disproportionate effects on minority- and 
women-owned businesses across the nation; 
(D) Congress has received and reviewed testi-
mony and documentation of race and gender 
discrimination from numerous sources, includ-
ing congressional hearings and other investiga-
tive activities, scientific reports, reports issued 
by public and private agencies at every level of 
government, news reports, academic publica-
tions, reports of discrimination by organizations 
and individuals, and discrimination lawsuits, 
which continue to demonstrate that race- and 
gender-neutral efforts alone are insufficient to 
address the problem; 
(E) the testimony and documentation de-
scribed in subparagraph (D) demonstrate that 
discrimination across the United States poses an 
injurious and enduring barrier to full and fair 
participation in surface transportation-related 
businesses of women business owners and mi-
nority business owners and has negatively af-
fected firm formation, development and success 
in many aspects of surface transportation-re-
lated business in the public and private markets; 
and 
(F) the testimony and documentation de-
scribed in subparagraph (D) provide a clear pic-
ture of the inequality caused by discrimination 
that continues to plague our nation and a 
strong basis that there is a compelling need for 
the continuation of the disadvantaged business 
enterprise program to address race and gender 
discrimination in surface transportation-related 
business. 
(2) DEFINITIONS.—In this subsection, the fol-
lowing definitions apply: 
(A) SMALL

TAGED
INDIVIDUALS.—The term ‘‘socially and 
economically disadvantaged individuals’’ has 
the meaning given the term in section 8(d) of the 
Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d)) and rel-
evant subcontracting regulations issued pursu-
ant to that Act, except that women shall be pre-
sumed to be socially and economically disadvan-
taged individuals for purposes of this sub-
section.

Code, shall be expended through small business

NESS ENTERPRISES.—Each State shall annually— 
(A) survey and compile a list of the small busi-
ness concerns referred to in paragraph (3) in the 
State, including the location of the small busi-
ness concerns in the State; and

percentage of the small business concerns that 
are controlled by— 
(i) women; 
(ii) socially and economically disadvantaged 
individuals (other than women); and 
(iii) individuals who are women and are oth-
erwise socially and economically disadvantaged 
individuals. 
(5) UNIFORM CERTIFICATION.— 
(A) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary of Transpor-
tation shall establish minimum uniform criteria 
for use by State governments in certifying 
whether a concern qualifies as a small business 
concern for the purpose of this subsection.

itoring of the disadvantaged business enterprise

ing in this subsection limits the eligibility of an 
individual or entity to receive funds made avail-
able under titles I, II, V, and VII of this division 
and section 403 of title 23, United States Code, 
if the entity or person is prevented, in whole or 
in part, from complying with paragraph (3) be-
cause a Federal court issues a final order in 
which the court finds that a requirement or the 
implementation of paragraph (3) is unconstitu-
tional. 
(8) SENSE OF CONGRESS ON PROMPT PAYMENT 
OF
DBE
SUBCONTRACTORS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(A) the Secretary of Transportation should 
take additional steps to ensure that recipients 
comply with section 26.29 of title 49, Code of 
Federal Regulations (the disadvantaged busi-
ness enterprises prompt payment rule), or any 
corresponding regulation, in awarding federally 
funded transportation contracts under laws and 
regulations administered by the Secretary; and 
(B) such additional steps should include in-
creasing the Department of Transportation’s 
ability to track and keep records of complaints 
and to make that information publicly avail-
able. 
(9) SENSE OF CONGRESS ON FULFILLING CERTAIN 
CONTRACTS.—It is the sense of Congress that 
contractors participating in a federally funded 
transportation contract with a small business 
concern owned and controlled by socially and 
economically disadvantaged individuals should 
ensure that the percentage of a contract prom-
ised to such small business concern is fulfilled, 
unless prior approval is obtained consistent with 
the regulations under part 26 of title 49, Code of 
Federal Regulations.

struction, operation and maintenance. 
(2) Addressing critical information gaps and 
challenges. 
(3) Financing options to help fund climate-re-
silient infrastructure. 
(4) A platform or process to facilitate commu-
nication between climate scientists and other ex-
perts with infrastructure planners, engineers 
and other relevant experts. 
(5) A stakeholder process to engage with rep-
resentatives of State, local, tribal and commu-
nity groups. 
(6) A platform for tracking Federal funding of 
climate-resilient infrastructure. 
(7) Labor and workforce needs to implement 
climate-resilient transportation infrastructure 
projects including new and emerging skills, 
training programs, competencies and recognized 
postsecondary credentials that may be required 
to adequately equip the workforce. 
(8) Outlining how Federal infrastructure 
planning, design, engineering, construction, op-
eration, and maintenance impact the environ-
ment and public health of disproportionately ex-
posed communities. For purposes of this para-
graph, the term ‘‘disproportionately exposed 
communities’’ means a community in which cli-
mate change, pollution, or environmental de-
struction have exacerbated systemic racial, re-
gional, social, environmental, and economic in-
justices by disproportionately affecting indige-
nous peoples, communities of color, migrant 
communities, deindustrialized communities, de-
populated rural communities, the poor, low-in-
come workers, women, the elderly, people experi-
encing homelessness, people with disabilities, 
people who are incarcerated, or youth. 
(d) CONSIDERATIONS.—In carrying out the 
study, the Transportation Research Board shall 
determine the need for information related to 
climate resilient transportation infrastructure 
by considering— 
(1) the current informational and institutional 
barriers to integrating projected infrastructure 
risks posed by climate change into federal infra-
structure planning, design, engineering, con-
struction, operation and maintenance; 
(2) the critical information needed by engi-
neers, planners and those charged with infra-
structure upgrades and maintenance to better 
incorporate climate change risks and impacts 
over the lifetime of projects; 
(3) how to select an appropriate, adaptive en-
gineering design for a range of future climate 
scenarios as related to infrastructure planning 
and investment; 
(4) how to incentivize and incorporate systems 
thinking into engineering design to maximize 
the benefits of multiple natural functions and 
emissions reduction, as well as regional plan-
ning; 
(5) how to take account of the risks of cas-
cading infrastructure failures and develop more 
holistic approaches to evaluating and mitigating 
climate risks; 
(6) how to ensure that investments in infra-
structure resilience benefit all communities, in-
cluding communities of color, low-income com-
munities, and Indian Tribes that face a dis-
proportionate risk from climate change and in 
many cases have experienced long-standing 
unmet needs and underinvestment in critical in-
frastructure; 
(7) how to incorporate capital assessment and 
planning training and techniques, including a 
range of financing options to help local and 
State governments plan for and provide match-
ing funds; 
(8) how federal agencies can track and mon-
itor federally funded resilient infrastructure in 
a coordinated fashion to help build the under-
standing of the cost-benefit of resilient infra-
structure and to build the capacity for imple-
menting resilient infrastructure; and 
(9) the occupations, skillsets, training pro-
grams, competencies and recognized postsec-
ondary credentials that will be needed to imple-
ment such climate-resilient transportation infra-
structure projects, and how to ensure that any 
new jobs created by such projects ensure that 
priority hiring considerations are given to indi-
viduals facing barriers to employment, commu-
nities of color, low-income communities and In-
dian Tribes that face a disproportionate risk 
from climate change and have been excluded 
from job opportunities.

retary, in consultation with State motor carrier 
enforcement entities, shall undertake a statis-
tically valid analysis to determine the safety im-
pact, including on enforcement, of the exemp-
tions, waivers, or other allowances compiled 
under paragraph (2) by— 
(i) using available data, or collecting from 
motor carriers or motor private carriers and 
drivers operating under an exemption, waiver, 
or other allowance if the Secretary does not 
have sufficient data, to determine the incidence 
of accidents, fatigue-related incidents, and 
other relevant safety information related to 
hours of service among motor carriers, private 
motor carriers, and drivers permitted to operate 
under each exemption, waiver, or other allow-
ance; 
(ii) comparing the data described in subpara-
graph (A) to safety data from motor carriers, 
motor private carriers, and drivers that are sub-
ject to the hours of service rules and not oper-
ating under an exemption, waiver, or other al-
lowance; and 
(iii) based on the comparison under subpara-
graph (B), determining whether waivers, exemp-
tions, and other allowances in effect provide an 
equivalent level of safety as would exist in the 
absence of exemptions, waivers, or other allow-
ances. 
(B) CONSULTATION.—The Secretary shall con-
sult with State motor carrier enforcement enti-
ties in carrying out this paragraph. 
(C) EXCLUSIONS.—The Secretary shall exclude 
data related to exemptions, waivers, or other al-
lowances made pursuant to an emergency dec-
laration under section 390.23 of title 49, Code of 
Federal Regulations, or extended under section 
390.25 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, 
from the analysis required under this para-
graph.

the comprehensive review under paragraph (1), 
the Secretary shall further consider— 
(A) data on driver detention collected by the 
Secretary pursuant to section 4304 of this Act 
and other conditions affecting the movement of 
goods by commercial motor vehicle, and how 
such conditions interact with the Secretary’s 
regulations on hours of service; 
(B) whether exemptions, waivers, or other al-
lowances that permit additional on-duty time or 
driving time have a deleterious effect on the 
physical condition of drivers; and 
(C) whether differences in the manner in 
which drivers are compensated result in dif-
ferent levels of burden for drivers in complying 
with hours of service rules. 
(b) PEER REVIEW.—Prior to the publication of 
the review required under subsection (d), the 
analyses performed by the Secretary shall un-
dergo an independent peer review. 
(c) PUBLICATION.—Not later than 18 months

country (as defined in section 771(18) of the Tar-
iff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1677(18))) as of the date 
of enactment of this Act;

Representative in the most recent report re-
quired by section 182 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 
U.S.C. 2242) as a priority foreign country under 
subsection (a)(2) of that section; and

resentative under section 306 of the Trade Act of 
1974 (19 U.S.C. 2416). 
(2) EXCEPTION.—For purposes of paragraph 
(1), the term ‘‘otherwise related legally or finan-
cially’’ does not include a minority relationship 
or investment. 
(3) INTERNATIONAL
AGREEMENTS.—This sub-
section shall be applied in a manner consistent 
with the obligations of the United States under 
international agreements. 
(o) RAIL TRUST FUND.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.— 
(A) FUNDING.—Beginning on the date on 
which a rail trust fund is established, any 
amounts made available under subsections (a), 
(g), (h), (i), (j)(1), (k), and (l) shall be derived 
from such fund. 
(B) RAIL TRUST FUND DEFINED.—In this sub-
section, the term ‘‘rail trust fund’’ means a trust 
fund established under the Internal Revenue 
Code of 1986 for making certain expenditures for 
the benefit of rail and for crediting certain taxes 
and penalties collected relating to rail. 
(2) SENSE OF COMMITTEE ON NEED FOR RAIL 
TRUST FUND.—The following is the sense of the 
Committee on Transportation and Infrastruc-
ture of the House of Representatives: 
(A) There is a discrepancy in historical Fed-
eral investment between highways, aviation, 
and intercity passenger rail. Between 1949 and 
2017, the Federal Government invested more 
than $2 trillion in our nation’s highways and 
over $777 billion in aviation. The Federal Gov-
ernment has invested $96 billion in intercity pas-
senger rail, beginning in 1971 with the creation 
of the National Railroad Passenger Corporation. 
Intercity passenger rail Federal investment is 
only 12 percent of Federal aviation investment 
and less than 5 percent of Federal highway in-
vestment. 
(B) Congress has recognized the value and im-
portance of a predictable, dedicated funding 
source through a trust fund for all other modes 
of transportation including for aviation, high-
ways, transit, and waterways. The Highway 
Trust Fund was created in 1956. The Airport 
and Aviation Trust Fund was created in 1970. 
The Inland Waterways Trust Fund was created 
in 1978. Mass transit was added to the Highway 
Trust Fund in 1983. The Harbor Maintenance 
Trust Fund was created in 1986. With regard to 
Federal transportation investment, only inter-
city passenger and freight rail do not have a 
predictable, dedicated funding source through a 
trust fund. 
(C) The Federal Railroad Administration has 
identified more than $300 billion worth of invest-
ment needed to develop both high-speed and 
higher speed intercity passenger rail corridors 
around the United States. In addition, a Fed-
eral Railroad Administration report from 2014 
found that shortline and regional railroads need 
$7 billion of investment. The Northeast Corridor 
has a $40 billion state of good repair backlog. 
(D) A rail trust fund would provide a predict-
able, dedicated funding source to high-speed 
and intercity passenger rail projects and for the 
public benefits of shortline and regional railroad 
freight rail projects. A trust fund provides essen-
tial longer term funding certainty to allow the 
United States to develop quality intercity pas-
senger rail service in corridors across the coun-
try, eliminate the state of good repair backlog 
on the Northeast Corridor, allow for accessible 
equipment and stations for passengers with dis-
abilities, move more freight on rail, redevelop an 
American passenger rail car manufacturing 
base, create good paying, middle class jobs, and 
reduce our nation’s transportation carbon emis-
sions.

retary shall determine the order of priority for 
projects in the BeST Inventory based on projects 
identified in paragraph (4) and project manage-
ment plans as described in subsection (d). The 
Secretary may alter the BeST Inventory as nec-
essary if eligible entities are not carrying out 
the schedule identified in the Inventory. 
‘‘(6) TERMS.—The Secretary shall ensure the 
BeST Inventory establishes, for each project in-
cluded in such Inventory— 
‘‘(A) the roles and terms of participation by 
any railroad bridge, station, or tunnel owners 
and railroad carriers in the project; and 
‘‘(B) the schedule for such project that en-
sures efficient completion of the project. 
‘‘(7) SPECIAL FINANCIAL RULES.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—Projects listed in the BeST 
Inventory may include an agreement with a 
commitment, contingent on future amounts to be 
specified in law for commitments under this 
paragraph, to obligate an additional amount 
from future available budget authority specified 
in law.

MENT.—An obligation or administrative commit-
ment under this paragraph may be made only 
when amounts are appropriated. An agreement

TITLE IV—COMMUTER RAIL POLICY 
SEC. 9401. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING 
COMMUTER RAIL LIABILITY INSUR-
ANCE. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
(1) Prior to the COVID–19 pandemic, 32 com-
muter railroads across the United States safely 
carried passengers on more than 500,000,000 trips 
each year. 
(2) Commuter rail is a $9,900,000,000 industry 
that creates and supports more than 200,000 
public- and private-sector jobs, and continues to 
grow. 
(3) Most commuter rail agencies are required 
to maintain liability insurance up to statutory 
liability limits. 
(4) Commuter rail agencies face significant ob-
stacles to finding and obtaining liability insur-
ance. 
(5) Only a handful of insurers offer this cov-
erage, and a significant percentage of the rail-
road liability insurance marketplace is provided 
by foreign companies. 
(6) The number of insurers in the American 
and foreign markets willing to even offer poten-
tial capacity for this coverage has drastically 
decreased over the past several years, and, re-
gardless of cost, it is becoming extremely dif-
ficult for commuter railroads to obtain the need-
ed coverage. 
(7) Despite the exceptional safety record of 
commuter railroads and recent full compliance 
with positive train control, a 2021 survey of the 
American Public Transportation Association’s 
commuter rail agencies revealed that there has 
been a 60 percent increase in premium costs over 
the last 3 years. 
(8) The increase in premiums is largely due to 
factors outside the control of the commuter rail 
industry, including major forest fires, hurri-
canes, and insurers exiting the market. 
(9) The cost of liability insurance severely im-
pacts the operating budgets of many commuter 
rail agencies and potentially affects their ability 
to offer these critical public transportation serv-
ices. 
(b) SENSE
OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that Congress should address the ca-
pacity and cost issues associated with the com-
muter rail liability insurance market and con-
sider establishing a commuter rail insurance 
program within the Department of Transpor-
tation. 
SEC. 9402. SURFACE TRANSPORTATION BOARD 
MEDIATION OF TRACKAGE USE RE-
QUESTS. 
Section 28502 of title 49, United States Code, is 
amended to read as follows: 
‘‘§ 28502. Surface Transportation Board medi-
ation of trackage use requests 
‘‘A rail carrier shall provide good faith con-
sideration to a reasonable request from a pro-
vider of commuter rail passenger transportation 
for access to trackage and provision of related 
services. If, after a reasonable period of negotia-
tion, a public transportation authority cannot 
reach agreement with a rail carrier to use track-
age of, and have related services provided by, 
the rail carrier for purposes of commuter rail 
passenger transportation, the public transpor-
tation authority or the rail carrier may apply to 
the Board for nonbinding mediation. In any 
case in which dispatching for the relevant 
trackage is controlled by a rail carrier other 
than the trackage owner, both shall be subject 
to the requirements of this section and included 
in the Board’s mediation process. The Board 
shall conduct the nonbinding mediation in ac-
cordance with the mediation process of section 
1109.4 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, 
as in effect on the date of enactment of the

Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I include 
in the RECORD a letter from Chair-
woman EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of the 
House Committee on Science, Space, 
and Technology, to waive consider-
ation of H.R. 3684, as amended, as well 
as my response to Chairwoman JOHN-
SON
expressing appreciation for her 
willingness to work cooperatively on 
this legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, the INVEST in America 
Act before us today is generational 
transformational in terms of what we 
are going to do in terms of 21st century 
surface transportation and water infra-
structure. We are going to move past 
the Eisenhower era of the 1950s. 
During the Eisenhower era, the exis-
tential threat to the United States was 
invasion or attack by Russia. The Na-
tional Defense Highway System was 
built to move military equipment to 
the coast, and it was also built to evac-
uate our cities in times of nuclear war. 
Now we have a different existential 
threat, which is climate change. Tack-
ling climate change is a Herculean 
task. 
Some may ask: Why address it in the 
transportation bill? 
In fact, we will hear that from the 
other side. 
Because the transportation sector is 
the single largest carbon emitter in the 
United States of America, and it would 
be foolish and irresponsible to continue 
pouring taxpayer money into the old 
way of thinking, that we must merely 
expand highways. 
We know now that doing that creates 
induced demand. You add more lanes, 
attract more cars and, before long, con-
gestion returns and you are right back 
where you started, except now you 
have bad traffic and more carbon pollu-
tion. 
According to the Texas A&M Trans-
portation Institute, in the last 25 
years, we have built 35,000 lane miles in 
our 100 largest cities, and the cost of 
congestion and delay have gone up six 
times. 
Should we keep doing that? 
No. It is not working. 
There are alternatives. We have a 
great opportunity. 
The infrastructure of the Eisenhower 
era is crumbling, threatening safety, 
quality of life, and economic competi-
tiveness. In fact, some of the infra-
structure we are living off, like the 
critical Baltimore rail tunnel, was 
built in 1872. It is not going to last 
long. It is brick and it is leaking water. 
The tunnels under the Hudson are 
subject to failure in the not-too-distant 
future. They were built in 1908. We had 
great engineers at the time, but now 
we have become so puny, we can’t do 
big projects like that. 
No, that is not the United States of 
America. That is not the American 
way. We can tackle these challenges, 
and we will. And climate change is part 
of what we have to deal with. 
I hear a lot from the other side about 
we want resilience. 
Resilience to what? Sea level rise? 
Why is the sea level rising? 
Hmm, I don’t know. 
Severe weather events? 
Nope. 
But in my region, just this week, an 
unprecedented 
heat 
wave—unprece-
dented in the history of the United 
States and western Canada, by far; 40 
degrees above normal—pavement buck-
led and melted, cables supplying power 
to transit melted, high tension lines 
sagged. Luckily, we got the trees out 
from under them. They didn’t cause 
fires this time. 
We have to rebuild this infrastruc-
ture to deal with the threats of the 21st 
century, and this is a tremendous op-
portunity. 
We have long had problems with in-
equality and racial injustice perpet-
uated 
by 
transportation 
programs, 
policies, and funding decisions. We 
have a major section in this bill to 
right those wrongs and provide new op-
portunities for those communities and 
rejoin some of those communities; so-
cial equity. 
U.S. infrastructure was once the 
envy of the world. We are now 13th and 
plummeting fast. We are kind of a joke 
around the world. China is putting 6 
percent of their GDP into transpor-
tation infrastructure. We are putting 
in one-half of 1 percent. 
We are going to compete with that? 
Other competitive nations in Europe 
are putting in 2 or 3 percent of their 
GDP. We are putting in a fraction of 
that. 
You know, we have water mains that 
explode, sewers that back up, and 
bridges that collapse. We have decrepit 
transit, $100 billion to bring up to state 
of good repair, and it breaks down 
when people are trying to get to work. 
We have potholes that cost every 
American between $560 and $1,000 a 
year in car repairs. The cost of delays 
is $170 billion, which is way more than 
we are spending on investment in 
transportation infrastructure. 
A rising China is threatening to take 
over the future of transportation in the 
world. We cannot let the Chinese do 
this yet again and steal those jobs from 
America. We have to move toward the 
future. 
We have General Motors, all electric 
in 2035. The Ford electric Mustang is 
outselling the fossil fuel Mustang. Hey, 
it is faster. I have driven a semi-truck 
made by Volvo. But there are four 
manufacturers making them, an 80,000- 
pound 
capable 
semi-tractor. 
Fred 
Smith from FedEx is going all electric, 
but he says there is no place to charge 
them. 
We have to meet this challenge, and 
part of this bill is EV challenging on 
the backbone of the national highway 
network. 
We are also going to put significant 
funds into safety. We are having huge

problems with safety: growing deaths 
in pedestrian, cycling, and others. We 
have to promote those modes, make 
them safe. More people will use them. 
We are making a major investment 
there, fossil fuel free. 
This bill is going to focus on bringing 
things to a state of good repair. 47,000 
bridges on the National Highway Sys-
tem need substantial repair or replace-
ment, and an infinite number of off- 
system bridges. We are creating a new 
program 
for 
off-highway-system 
bridges; a new program for rural 
bridges; a new program for the 10 most 
economically significant bridges in the 
country, including ones like the Brent 
Spence Bridge, which is going to col-
lapse or be closed in 8 years, con-
necting Kentucky and Ohio. 
Those things are in this bill. If we 
don’t do this bill, then we are doomed 
to an even more inefficient and de-
crepit future. 
We are going to make historic invest-
ments in transit, helping to address, as 
I mentioned, the $100 billion state of 
good repair backlog. We are closing the 
last loopholes in transit. 
We are going to get two Chinese com-
panies—predatory Chinese companies 
out of here, making electric buses and 
rail. And we are going to make all of 
that stuff in the United States of 
America and create one heck of a lot of 
jobs. Maybe we will even export elec-
tric buses to the rest of the world. 
Then beyond that, you know, we are 
going to be a leader in the clean energy 
economy. That is the future. It is the 
future. It is the business case. It is 
where the corporations are going, ex-
cept parts of the fossil fuel industry. 
Even ExxonMobil is talking about 
spending $100 billion on carbon capture 
and sequestration; even ExxonMobil. 
But there are other parts of the fossil 
fuel industry that are, like, ‘‘No, you 
stick with us. Stick with fossil fuel. 
Don’t allow them to do this electrifica-
tion stuff. Don’t talk about climate 
change. Carbon pollution doesn’t do 
anything.’’ 
No, none of that is true, and we have 
to deal with it. 
It offers opportunities to commu-
nities of all sizes: urban, suburban, and 
rural. There’s a 50 percent increase for 
rural transit, $37 billion from the Sur-
face Transportation Program suballo-
cated to local communities, not the 
biggest cities. We create several new 
multimodal discretionary grant pro-
grams, 
including 
the 
Community 
Transportation and Community Cli-
mate grants, for local government ap-
plicants. 
For the first time in a decade, we 
provided bipartisan member-designated 
projects. 109 Republicans applied for 
projects. Everyone was offered $20 mil-
lion under very strict guidelines agreed 
to by the majority and the minority. 
We cleaned that up. 
Some people are saying: Well, this is 
bad; it is poor. 
No. Does the Federal DOT or your 
State DOT know what you need most 
in your district? What your city needs? 
What your county needs? 
You know better, but sometimes 
they just ignore it. They are focused on 
the capitol; they are focused on the 
biggest cities; they are focused on 
Washington, D.C., who knows what. 
So we have those projects in this bill. 
Someone said: Well, if the Repub-
licans won’t vote for it, are you going 
to strip them out? 
I said: No. These are meritorious 
projects that have gone through a vet-
ting process. They will stay in. This is 
helping local communities. 
Now, I also have to say that we have 
had issues with the DBE—Disadvan-
taged Business Enterprise—program at 
the Department of Transportation. Dis-
crimination is still a barrier for many 
to get into constructing and maintain-
ing our Surface Transportation Pro-
gram. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
a more comprehensive statement about 
the need for this crucial program, 
along with a list of several key studies 
on discrimination used to help inform 
the reauthorization of the DBE pro-
gram. It includes a historic $95 billion 
in rail investment. That is about a 500 
percent increase. 
We are going to begin to join city 
pairs so people can get off the high-
ways. 
Virginia is doing a great project. In-
stead of putting two more lanes, which 
would be immediately congested, for 
$12 billion on I–95, they are going to 
build a rail project with a new bridge 
over the Potomac River, partnering 
with CSX for half the cost, and reduce 
congestion more and give people a bet-
ter commute. We need to be looking at 
that model around the country. 
b 1715 
The bill includes $32 billion for Am-
trak. It also has money for a new pro-
gram, PRIME, the Passenger Rail Im-
provement, Modernization, and Expan-
sion program, a $25 billion competitive 
grant program for States and localities 
to launch high-speed and intercity rail 
development. 
It tackles big rail projects that need 
significant investment to get off the 
ground. The $25 billion Bridges, Sta-
tions, and Tunnels, or BeST—I men-
tioned the Baltimore tunnel earlier— 
directed grant program funds bridges, 
stations, and tunnels that have total 
project costs of $500 million or more, 
which cannot just be carried by local 
communities. 
I previously mentioned robust safety 
programs. 
It also includes the first reauthoriza-
tion of the Clean Water State Revolv-
ing Fund since 1987. 
When I was a county commissioner, 
we got a 75 percent match from the 
Federal Government to build a system 
that is still serving a community twice 
that size today. Today, if we went to 
the Federal Government for a match, 
they would say, ‘‘Sorry, we don’t help 
you with wastewater.’’ 
Wastewater does not observe city 
limits. It does not observe county 
lines. It does not observe State lines. It 
does not observe international bound-
aries. It is a national problem, and our 
communities need help. 
I was on a statewide call with county 
commissioners, 75 percent of them Re-
publicans. They are begging—begging— 
in these rural counties for help with 
wastewater and drinking water. We 
have to step up to the plate on that. 
This will be the first reauthorization in 
many, many years. 
We are going to move forward with 
this bill, and every part of this bill is 
backed by the strongest Buy America 
requirements, labor protections, and 
new investments in worker training 
safety. I wish some of the other depart-
ments of the Federal Government, par-
ticularly the Pentagon, would follow 
our model to create more jobs in Amer-
ica. 
It is not enough just to transform it. 
We need to ensure our investments cre-
ate good-paying jobs, revitalize Amer-
ican manufacturing, help us compete in 
the clean energy economy, and lead the 
world once again, as we were the envy 
of the world in the 1970s and up to 
about the early 1980s. 
This is a chance to reform and re-
build our infrastructure for the future. 
It is an opportunity to improve safety, 
equity, and access for all Americans. It 
is an urgent call to confront the exis-
tential threat of climate change and 
leave a better world for future genera-
tions. 
This is a transformative bill that will 
improve mobility, economic competi-
tiveness, and the quality of life in com-
munities across the country. Infra-
structure is calling, and Congress must 
finally answer the call. 
Chairman PETER DEFAZIO Statement for the 
RECORD on DBE Program and Disparity Stud-
ies Submitted to the RECORD
INVEST in 
America Act, General Debate, June 30, 2021. 
I include in the RECORD: 
The INVEST in America Act once again re-
authorizes the critically important Dis-
advantage Business Enterprise, or DBE, pro-
gram at the Department of Transportation. 
Unfortunately, even with the DBE Pro-
gram, discrimination still haunts us in the 
market to construct and maintain our fed-
eral surface transportation system. We hear 
about it from constituents and others who 
work as contractors in the transportation in-
dustry. We’ve read about it in personal state-
ments submitted by women- and minority- 
small business owners from across the coun-
try. And we see it reflected in mounds of sta-
tistical evidence compiled by my Committee. 
This evidence includes many thousands of 
pages of rigorous statistical analysis dem-
onstrating clear disparities between the ca-
pacity of minority- and women-owned busi-
nesses to compete for federal dollars, and the 
utilization of that capacity by federal con-
tractors. 
These studies represent thousands of pages 
of complex rigorous analysis by many dif-
ferent authors in every region of our nation. 
And while the findings are better than in the 
early days of the DBE program, we still have 
a long way to go. I’d like to just highlight a 
tiny fraction of the information found in 
these studies:

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3506 
June 30, 2021 
Just so my colleagues don’t think I am 
picking on their states, let me start with Or-
egon. The 2016 ODOT Disparity Study found 
that women- and minority-owned firms only 
won 61 cents on the dollar of what we would 
expect given their availability on state and 
federally funded highway contracts. Non-mi-
nority women, African Americans and Na-
tive Americans did even worse at 52 cents, 58 
cents and 49 cents respectively. 
In Texas DOT spending, women and minor-
ity owned firms as a group won only 60 cents 
on the dollar of what we might have ex-
pected 
for 
state-funded 
transportation 
projects given their availability in the mar-
ket. Non-minority women, African Ameri-
cans, Hispanic Americans and Native Ameri-
cans all did worse. Indeed, African Ameri-
cans won only 22 cents on the dollar and Na-
tive Americans won only 18 cents on the dol-
lar. The numbers were even worse when con-
sidering only federal funds—32 cents on the 
dollar when considering Federal Highway 
Administration contracts alone. 
For Maryland, which has had one of the 
more robust and continuously operated DBE 
programs in the nation, DBEs still get only 
70 cents on the dollar of combined federal 
and state transportation funding. For Afri-
can Americans, the number is 50 cents, for 
Native Americans it’s 43 cents and for non- 
minority women, the number is 56 cents. 
Sadly, in the transit industry, things are 
not much better. For instance, an analysis of 
contracting for the Los Angeles, California, 
Metropolitan 
Transportation 
Authority, 
found that firms owned by women and mi-
norities make about 74 cents on the dollar of 
what we would expect given their representa-
tion in the marketplace. For non-minority 
women, the number was 59 cents and for Af-
rican Americans it was 51 cents. 
These same troubling statistics are re-
peated in cities and states that spend some 
of their budgets on surface transportation 
and similar construction, architecture, and 
engineering projects. For instance, the 2018 
study for the Nashville, Tennessee area 
found that women- and minority-owned busi-
ness enterprises got 54 cents of every one 
dollar in construction prime contracting; 
Asian American firms were at 25 cents on the 
dollar; and firms owned by Hispanic Ameri-
cans earned only 1 cent of every dollar of 
what we would expect given their market-
place representation. 
There’s no doubt that things are better 
today than before the DBE Program—more 
firms owned by women and minorities get 
work than they did forty years ago. But the 
progress has been slow, halting, and exceed-
ingly fragile. One of the powerful things 
about the disparity study evidence we have 
collected is the diversity of approaches and 
analyses these documents provide. Some 
studies, for instance, not only study dispari-
ties in the public and private surface trans-
portation markets, but they also attempt to 
analyze what might occur if the DBE pro-
gram no longer existed. One interesting ex-
ample is found in the LA Metro study where 
they 
compared 
the 
participation 
of 
minority- and women-owned firms on con-
tracts that had goals to encourage diverse 
participation and those that did not. The re-
sults are stunning. On contracts with goals, 
participation occurred at almost the level we 
would expect given the presence of minority- 
and women-owned firms in the marketplace 
and firms owned by minorities and women 
earned 96 cents on the dollar—on contracts 
without goals, they earned 53 cents on the 
dollar. The numbers are even more startling 
for certain subgroups. On contracts with 
goals, non-minority women actually exceed-
ed parity (something that regularly occurs 
for firms owned by non-minority males, but 
rarely happens for firms owned by women 
and minorities). But on contracts without 
goals, firms owned by non-minority women 
earned only 37 cents on the dollar. Firms 
owned by Hispanic Americans approached 
parity on contracts with goals (98 cents on 
the dollar), but on contracts without goals, 
they earned only 59 cents on the dollar. Afri-
can American owned firms earned only 64 
cents on the dollar even on contracts with 
goals, and on contracts without goals the 
number plummeted to 30 cents on the dollar. 
Tragically, the COVID–19 pandemic only 
exacerbated the need for the DBE program. 
Preliminary data on the pandemic’s eco-
nomic devastation shows a massively dis-
proportionate impact on small businesses in 
minority communities. An article by Dr. 
Robert Fairlie published last year by the 
Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Re-
search, uses statistics from the Census Bu-
reau’s Current Population Survey to illus-
trate just how devastating the COVID–19 
pandemic has already been for firms owned 
by minorities and women. His analysis exam-
ines the drop in ‘‘active businesses’’ com-
paring the numbers from mid-February 2020, 
just before the effects of the pandemic be-
came clear in the United States, to mid- 
April, when the economy in much of the 
country had shut down. During that time, all 
businesses experienced economic devasta-
tion—but because of discrimination, the dev-
astation was far greater for businesses owned 
by women and minorities. For instance, dur-
ing this period the number of active busi-
nesses owned by whites dropped 17 percent, 
but the number of businesses owned by Afri-
can Americans dropped 41 percent. For His-
panic businesses, the number was 32 percent 
and for firms owned by Asian Americans the 
drop was 26 percent. These numbers are not 
just troubling, they are staggering, and the 
pandemic is still not over. 
Now, more than ever, as we prepare to 
spend billions of federal dollars on transpor-
tation projects, it is urgent that we ensure 
the process of awarding federal transpor-
tation contract dollars is not discrimina-
tory, and that minorities and women are al-
lowed to compete on an equal playing field 
for those dollars.

Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
HOUSE
OF REPRESENTATIVES, COM-
MITTEE
ON SCIENCE, SPACE, AND 
TECHNOLOGY, 
Washington, DC, June 21, 2021. 
Hon. PETER A. DEFAZIO, 
Chairman, Committee on Transportation and 
Infrastructure, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN DEFAZIO: I am writing you 
concerning H.R. 3684, the ‘‘INVEST in Amer-
ica Act,’’ which was ordered to be reported 
out of the Committee on Transportation and 
Infrastructure on June 10, 2021. Prior to this, 
I submitted a jurisdictional claim letter for 
a sequential referral on this bill on June 7, 
2021 and the Office of the Parliamentarian 
found this claim to be valid. 
As a result of cooperative consultations 
with the Committee on Science, Space, and 
Technology (‘‘Science Committee’’) and in 
the interest an expedient consideration of 
H.R. 3684 before the House of Representa-
tives, I will waive formal consideration of 
this bill. I take this action with a mutual 
understanding between our two Committees 
that by foregoing consideration of H.R. 3684, 
the Science Committee does not waive any 
jurisdiction over the subject matter con-
tained in this, or in similar, legislation. 
Furthermore, I humbly request a letter 
confirming this understanding and that this 
exchange of letters be included in the bill re-
port to be filed by the Committee on Trans-
portation and Infrastructure as well as in-
cluded in the Congressional Record during 
floor consideration of the bill. Finally, I ask 
that you support the appointment of Science 
Committee conferees during any House-Sen-
ate conference convened on this legislation. 
Sincerely, 
EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON, 
Chairwoman, Committee on Science, 
Space, and Technology.

Washington DC, June 21, 2021. 
Hon. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON, 
Chairwoman, Committee on Science, Space, and 
Technology, 
House 
of 
Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRWOMAN JOHNSON: Thank you for 
your letter regarding H.R. 3684, the INVEST 
in America Act. I appreciate your decision to 
waive formal consideration of the bill. 
I agree that the Committee on Science, 
Space, 
and 
Technology 
(‘‘Science 
Com-
mittee’’) has valid jurisdictional claims to 
certain provisions in this important legisla-
tion, and I further agree that by forgoing 
formal consideration of the bill, the Science 
Committee is not waiving any jurisdiction 
over any relevant subject matter. Addition-
ally, I will support the appointment of con-
ferees from the Science Committee should a 
House-Senate conference be convened on this 
legislation. Finally, this exchange of letters 
will be included in the committee report 
filed by the Committee on Transportation 
and Infrastructure and included in the Con-
gressional Record when the bill is considered 
on the floor. 
Thank you again, and I look forward to 
continuing to work collaboratively with the 
Science Committee to ensure H.R. 3684 
passes the House and is enacted into law. 
Sincerely, 
PETER A. DEFAZIO, 
Chair. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposi-
tion to H.R. 3684. 
Here we are again. It is ‘‘Groundhog 
Day’’ for infrastructure on the floor 
this week. Exactly 1 year ago, I stood 
here as we took up the majority’s first 
version of its my-way-or-the-highway 
bill. That bill, just like today’s, was de-
veloped without working with Repub-
lican Members, and it passed mostly 
along party lines. And then that bill 
died, forcing Congress to pass a 1-year, 
short-term extension, something that 
we all know is extremely costly, and it 
is detrimental to our States’ ability to 
plan and carry out the improvements 
that they need. 
Unfortunately, the Speaker has ig-
nored the obvious lesson that success-
ful legislating is through partnership, 
not through partisanship. As a result, 
today’s bill is even worse than last 
year’s failed effort. 
This bill is completely unpaid for. It 
is completely unpaid for, something 
that I have never seen in a highway bill 
in my two decades here in Congress. It 
is all deficit spending, and it is going 
to continue driving up what is already 
the highest inflation rate since 2008. 
Mr. Speaker, it didn’t have to be this 
way. Earlier this year, our committee’s 
leaders met with the President, and we 
made it clear that Republicans wanted 
to be a part of a bipartisan bill. I have 
no doubt that we could have com-
promised in a way that met many of 
the majority’s goals while still includ-
ing Republicans’ priorities from our 
own proposal. 
Far from being impossible, the Sen-
ate committees have managed to do 
just that. They found common ground 
on commonsense project streamlining, 
flexibility for our State and local part-
ners, and equitable treatment for rural 
America. 
However, in order to appease the pro-
gressives in their party, the majority 
showed no willingness to meet us any-
where in the middle. Instead, they 
moved their bill even further to the 
left than the one from last year. Iron-
ically, even that won’t be enough, as 
Speaker PELOSI right now is preparing 
another partisan effort that is going to 
completely overshadow this bill by 
pushing through a multitrillion-dollar, 
tax-and-spend plan using budget rec-
onciliation. 
Mr. Speaker, I will just walk through 
a few of the things, just a very few of 
the things that are wrong with this 
bill. 
Mr. Speaker, $1 out of every $2 on 
this bill is tied up in the Green New 
Deal agenda. This bill eliminates a ban 
on spending transit dollars to fund art 
at train stations or transit stations. It 
is insane, given the infrastructure 
needs that we have in this country, 
that this bill would waste critical in-
frastructure resources on buying paint-
ings and sculptures for transit sta-
tions. 
This bill significantly increases the 
size of government. It creates 41 new 
programs. 
As I mentioned, this bill provides no 
regulatory reform to make project de-
livery more efficient and less wasteful. 
This bill ties the hands of States that 
need to build new roads and new capac-
ity. Even if that is their most critical 
need, it still ties their hands. 
These are just a few of the examples 
of why this bill is bad for the country. 
I can go on and on and on and on and 
on. This partisanship was absolutely 
unnecessary, and it is sad. 
The Senate Environment and Public 
Works Committee and the Senate Com-
merce Committee have overwhelm-
ingly approved their own pieces of a 
surface reauthorization. The Senate 
has also approved a bipartisan $35 bil-
lion water infrastructure plan. But in-
stead of following that example or 
using the bipartisan agreement we had 
on clean water infrastructure that we 
agreed to last Congress as the frame-
work, the majority again chose to walk 
away from bipartisanship. 
This bill now includes more than $170 
billion for drinking water and waste-
water infrastructure, which is com-
pletely unrealistic, and it is out of 
touch with the Senate’s bill and House 
Republicans. In fact, everything about 
this bill is out of touch. 
Although the President currently 
supports a bipartisan infrastructure 
framework in the Senate, progressives 
in Congress have already declared that 
that Senate proposal is dead on arrival 
without first getting their massive par-
tisan wish list. If they don’t get it, 
they have stated that. 
The Speaker and the far left are try-
ing to hold infrastructure hostage in 
order to get their $6 trillion in other 
priorities through budget reconcili-
ation. 
While the other side says that all the 
spending in today’s bill is supposed to 
transform our transportation system, 
it is certainly going to change one 
thing in transportation, and that is 
your gas prices. More deficit spending 
is only going to further fuel inflation 
and raise the price of not only gas but 
food and every other necessity. 
Voting for this bill is an implicit en-
dorsement of the Speaker’s overall 
strategy to ram through a $6 trillion 
tax-and-spend reconciliation package, 
and I encourage Members to vote 
against this bill and against this par-
tisan process. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from the 
District of Columbia (Ms. NORTON), the 
chair of the Surface Transportation 
Subcommittee. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, as chair 
of the subcommittee that helped write 
today’s INVEST in America Act, I 
want to emphasize that this bill breaks 
with previous Transportation and In-
frastructure 
bills 
generally 
passed 
every 4 or 5 years. Until today, we have 
simply updated the bill first passed 
during the Eisenhower administration. 
However, today’s bill, for example, 
for the first time tackles climate 
change in recognition that transpor-
tation leads as a source of greenhouse 
gas emissions. The need to reduce 
burning fossil fuels is a priority in this

bill to move us more quickly to zero 
emissions. 
I am particularly focused on trans-
portation infrastructure alternatives, 
like those here in my district, the Dis-
trict of Columbia, particularly transit, 
especially Amtrak, and establishing a 
pilot project for reduced transit fares 
for low-income riders. 
Perhaps most important, this bill 
fundamentally reverses course by ac-
tively discouraging expansion of roads 
for the first time. This limitation is in 
recognition of climate change. Instead 
of incentivizing more miles of roads for 
cars, this bill encourages safer roads 
for walking, biking, and scooters. To-
day’s bill repairs existing roads with 
climate-resilient materials rather than 
building new roads. 
The INVEST in America Act changes 
course altogether in the interest of 21st 
century transportation realities from 
climate change to rapidly emerging al-
ternatives to cars as forms of travel 
and mobility. 
The 54 percent increase in funding for 
this bill is in keeping with the road to 
change course on transportation and 
infrastructure. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Arkansas (Mr. CRAWFORD). 
Mr. CRAWFORD. Mr. Speaker, today, 
we are debating a partisan bill that 
spends over $400 billion on everything 
but long-term investments in Amer-
ica’s roads and bridges. 
Despite being the largest percentage 
increase in surface transportation pro-
grams in the last quarter-century, very 
little of the money going out the door 
is directed at the policies, programs, 
and people that need it. 
It ignores the need to streamline our 
project review process, creates more 
bureaucratic red tape, and, once again, 
leaves rural America behind. 
A focus on the rail title, for example, 
reveals complete ignorance of the in-
dustry. Freight railroads are the most 
fuel-efficient way to move freight over 
land, covering more than 480 miles on a 
single gallon of fuel. Yet, my col-
leagues on the left included section 
9607 that would require Class I freight 
railroads to replace locomotives con-
structed prior to 2008 with brand-new 
fossil-fuel-burning locomotives by 2030. 
This ignores the significant efforts of 
the Class I freight railroads themselves 
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and 
combat climate change. It locks the in-
dustry into utilizing internal combus-
tion engines for decades, negating the 
ongoing efforts with suppliers to re-
search, test, and adapt zero-emission 
locomotives for future incorporation 
into their fleets. 
This section alone would cost the in-
dustry tens of billions of dollars and, 
needless to say, was written without 
the consultation of the railroads or 
stakeholders. 
This is just one of the many exam-
ples in this partisan bill of the signifi-
cant disconnect between constituents 
and the majority’s Green New Deal 
agenda. We have a bill that cares more 
about appeasing the climate lobby than 
fixing the cracks in our bridges. 
I cannot support this legislation 
today. Instead, I will continue working 
with my colleagues who are serious 
about addressing American transpor-
tation and infrastructure, and I en-
courage everyone to do the same thing. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. PAYNE), the chair of the 
Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous 
Materials Subcommittee. 
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to support the INVEST in Amer-
ica Act. It is a bill that I have co-led 
because it would help fix our country’s 
decaying and unreliable infrastructure. 
America has always used infrastruc-
ture to grow our Nation and our econ-
omy, but those improvements have left 
behind too many people in underserved 
and rural communities. 
In Congress, we have a responsibility 
to make sure everyone has an oppor-
tunity to achieve the American Dream. 
That is why the INVEST in America 
Act is so critical. 
It provides funds to build or improve 
roads, bridges, and tunnels throughout 
America, and it will allow access and 
development 
within 
those 
commu-
nities. 
For example, it provides $95 billion to 
improve passenger rail travel nation-
wide. That figure includes almost $19 
billion to help Amtrak upgrade sta-
tions and tracks. And it provides $13.5 
billion for rail improvements in the 
Northeast corridor. 
It would spend $25 billion to repair 
and rebuild bridges, train stations, and 
train tunnels across this Nation. 
Most important, it provides $25 bil-
lion to modernize existing rail and ex-
pand into more American commu-
nities. The expansion would increase 
our opportunities for jobs and pros-
perity in underserved communities. 
We need to make these investments 
now and improve the lives of millions 
of Americans in the process. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Ohio (Mr. GIBBS). 
Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in op-
position to H.R. 3684, which is nothing 
more than the Green New Deal in dis-
guise. Whether it is creating dozens of 
new government programs or propping 
up failed passenger rail projects, the 
House Democrats’ my-way-or-the-high-
way bill is bloated Big Government at 
its worst. 
b 1730 
Democrats blocked every Republican 
attempt to improve the bill, including 
my amendment in committee that 
would stop taxpayer dollars for funding 
art through transit projects. 
H.R. 3684 also bends the knee to Bei-
jing, allowing communist China to 
profit off American investments in 
electric vehicles. 
There is plenty of room for common-
sense, bipartisan efforts on actual 
transportation infrastructure: Fixing 
roads and bridges, repairing airports, 
and even responsible investments in 
broadband. 
But the majority is intent on ignor-
ing these bipartisan prospects with ir-
responsible spending on socialism and 
driving up debt on the backs of Amer-
ican taxpayers. 
I reject H.R. 3684, and I urge my col-
leagues to do the same. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Texas 
(Ms. 
JOHNSON), 
the 
chair 
of 
the 
Science, Space and Technology Com-
mittee, and a senior member of the 
Transportation 
and 
Infrastructure 
Committee. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
I thank Chairman DEFAZIO for his lead-
ership in bringing this bill to the floor. 
I rise in strong support of H.R. 3684, 
the INVEST in America Act. This bill 
authorizes a tremendous funding boost 
to our Nation’s surface transportation 
and infrastructure system, including a 
significant amount for my State of 
Texas. Failing to invest now will cost 
much more later. 
The INVEST in America Act also 
makes 
significant 
investments 
in 
transportation research, development, 
and demonstration to support of safer 
and more resilient, equitable, and sus-
tainable transportation future. 
I am pleased to have inserted numer-
ous provisions in the bill before us 
today, including one to establish a 
grants program in the Department of 
Transportation to develop transpor-
tation workforce training programs for 
workers adversely affected by industry 
automation; a sense of Congress to em-
phasize that contractors participating 
in a federally funded transportation 
contract with a minority-owned busi-
ness must ensure that it is fulfilled. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
the gentlewoman an additional 30 sec-
onds. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. As well as an 
amendment to require the GAO to ana-
lyze the DOT’s performance of key 
DBE objectives, and a provision to as-
sist communities to retrofit transpor-
tation infrastructure. 
Nothing in this bill is intended to 
build a wall in Texas, and I look for-
ward to supporting this legislation. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Louisiana (Mr. GRAVES). 
Mr. 
GRAVES 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, you can look back at history 
at highway bills and infrastructure 
bills, and all of these bills passed this 
House with strong bipartisan support. 
Seventy-five, 80 percent, 90 percent of 
the Members of Congress have sup-
ported these bills. You can look back, 
Mr. Speaker. For decades this has hap-
pened. 
Why is this bill moving in an entirely 
partisan manner? Why is there not bi-
partisan support? 
And the answer is really simple: Be-
cause this bill is not infrastructure. It

is not solving road problems and traffic 
problems that are plaguing this coun-
try. 
What this bill does is it puts billions 
of dollars into things like EV charging 
stations. So if you are an American 
that owns the 0.6 percent of vehicles 
out there that are electric vehicles— 
the majority of which make over 
$160,000—the great news for you is you 
are going to get billions of dollars in 
federally paid-for subsidized charging 
stations. 
The process needs to be fixed for de-
livering projects. This bill doesn’t do 
it. 
Why is it we are building projects 
around the country that have been 
around for decades? 
It is because the process is flawed. It 
takes decades just to get a project ap-
proved, but don’t worry, Mr. Speaker, 
because this bill fixes it for bus shel-
ters. 
This bill should be bipartisan, as has 
been done for decades. We need real 
traffic solutions, real investments in 
infrastructure, and unfortunately, this 
bill doesn’t do it. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. GARAMENDI), a member of 
the committee. 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the chairman for his leadership 
and his partnership in this vital $715 
billion INVEST in America Act. This 
bill will modernize our Nation’s roads, 
bridges, transit, rail, water systems, 
and hasten the transition to carbon- 
free mobility and resilience to climate 
threats in America. 
My amendments to the bill ensure 
that projects will be built by well-paid 
American 
workers 
with 
American 
made services and products. It does ex-
tend the NEPA timelines to ensure a 
timely project completion, and it also 
prioritizes evacuation routes and in-
vests in corrosion resistance. 
This bill also invests $27 billion for 
roads and transit in California over the 
next 5 years and three critical projects 
in my own district: $8.5 million for the 
505 highway over crossing in Winters, 
California; $4 million for a multimodal 
transit/highway 
improvement 
in 
Vacaville; and a $71⁄2 million project in 
Fairfield, and—I would dare say, for 
my colleagues on the Republican side— 
a whole lot of their community-based 
projects which apparently they want us 
to vote for but they don’t have the 
willingness to vote for on their own. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman 
from North Carolina (Mr. ROUZER). 
Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, the bill 
before us today represents a missed op-
portunity to produce good, strong bi-
partisan legislation focused on the 
country’s real infrastructure needs. 
Instead, it is one focused on an agen-
da cloaked under the guise of the term 
‘‘infrastructure.’’ 
This bill is all about Green New Deal 
mandates. In fact, for every $2 spent, $1 
of that goes to meet these mandates. 
The bill rejects widely supported bi-
partisan projects streamlining provi-
sions that would save taxpayer dollars. 
The bill creates 41 new programs and 
adds dozens of new eligibilities to ex-
isting programs for progressive prior-
ities, which means true infrastructure 
needs are likely going to have access to 
fewer dollars. 
The bill strips States of their ability 
to prioritize new roads and bridges. 
And we all know States need more 
flexibility to meet their infrastructure 
needs, not less. 
Today’s bill is also a missed oppor-
tunity to address our aging wastewater 
infrastructure. 
In the most recent Congress, we 
reached a bipartisan agreement on a 
way to move forward on clean water in-
frastructure with realistic levels of 
funding that address the needs of our 
rural communities. Well, not this time. 
Unfortunately, by choosing partisan-
ship, the majority has chosen a very 
rocky path that will make it unlikely 
any final infrastructure package will 
be able to pass both Chambers and get 
to the President’s desk during this 
Congress. 
Mr. Speaker, it didn’t have to be this 
way. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, may I 
ask how much time is remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Oregon has 101⁄2 minutes 
remaining. The gentleman from Mis-
souri has 19-minutes remaining. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. HUFFMAN), a member of the 
committee. 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, it is 
important that this 5-year surface 
transportation reauthorization invests 
in a cleaner, greener transportation fu-
ture while helping create great-paying 
jobs for American workers, but the IN-
VEST in America Act does more than 
that. It finally restores Congress’ Arti-
cle I prerogative in controlling the 
power of the purse. 
Through an open, transparent proc-
ess, Member-designated projects will 
ensure that elected Representatives of 
the people have at least some say on 
which surface transportation projects 
get funding. And in my district that 
means expanding the SMART rail serv-
ice into Healdsburg and further north, 
closing the gaps in a pedestrian and 
bike pathway along San Francisco Bay 
Trail, providing ADA accessibility and 
educational signage at the mouth of 
the Smith River Overlook, and plan-
ning for a safe pedestrian crossing at 
the San Rafael Channel. 
The INVEST Act will also start plan-
ning for improvements along Route 37 
to benefit both commuters and the en-
vironment in the face of rising sea lev-
els. 
I thank Chairman DEFAZIO for his 
leadership on this bill, and I look for-
ward to sending it to President Biden’s 
desk for his signature. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Illinois (Mr. BOST). 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman for yielding. 
With this bill, House Democrats are 
saying that when it comes to our Na-
tion’s infrastructure, it is either their 
way or the highway. 
Instead of accurately investing in our 
roads and bridges, the House Demo-
crats have chosen to double down on a 
liberal wish list. 
In fact, $1 of every $2 in this bill is 
spent on parts of Green New Deal man-
dates. 
It allows jurisdictions that have 
defunded the police to backfill their 
budgets with Federal dollars for traffic 
enforcement activities. 
It allows funds to be spent on art in-
stead of roads, bridges, and waterways. 
I will just repeat that again. It allows 
the funds to be spent on art instead of 
roads, bridges, and waterways. 
It punishes our Nation’s truckers by 
raising their minimum insurance costs 
by 167 percent and regulating when and 
how far they can drive their own vehi-
cles on their own personal time. 
And it does not include any way to 
pay for this massive $547.9 billion price 
tag. 
I urge my colleagues to oppose this 
legislation. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Ne-
vada (Ms. TITUS), the chair of the Eco-
nomic Development, Public Buildings, 
and 
Emergency 
Management 
Sub-
committee. 
Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
chairman for yielding. 
I rise in support of the INVEST in 
America Act, which focuses on rebuild-
ing our Nation’s highways, transit sys-
tems, railroads, and water systems. 
These investments will spur eco-
nomic development, tackle the climate 
crisis, and put people to work in good- 
paying union jobs. 
I am proud that the Act includes 
some issues that I fought for that will 
benefit the State of Nevada, provisions 
to support projects of regional impact, 
like the completion of I–11 between Las 
Vegas and Phoenix; an expansion of the 
RRIF program to help with the devel-
opment of high-speed passenger rail; 
projects to reduce congestion and im-
prove air quality in our environmental 
justice communities; and resources for 
child passenger safety programs in our 
underserved communities. 
Finally, I am glad to see Congress re-
assert its authority to direct funding 
to priority projects in a very trans-
parent manner. 
Critical infrastructure projects in 
southern Nevada will see $20 million in 
funding to support congestion relief, 
transit, and safety enhancements on 
roadways that cross and crisscross the 
district. 
The INVEST Act sends a clear and 
strong message about our priorities, 
and I congratulate our chairman for 
his hard work on this issue. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from California (Mr. LAMALFA).

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3511 
June 30, 2021 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I do 
have to clear up one point made ear-
lier. The sales of gas Mustangs are dou-
ble that of the so-called four-door elec-
tric Mustang in the month of May, and 
the gas Mustang is triple that of the 
electric Mustang for the year. As a 
Mustang driver, I had to get that out. 
So when we had the Biden adminis-
tration announcing an over $2 trillion 
spending package, but we only end up 
with 6 percent in expenditures for 
roads and bridges, it is a bait and 
switch. 
Indeed, it seems like the Democrats 
are trying to take this miniscule in-
vestment in infrastructure and chal-
lenge themselves to waste it on some-
thing else in Green New Deal programs. 
It is already a big enough challenge 
to get money and keep money in infra-
structure these days and keep it from 
being siphoned off. 
This bill does nothing to reform or 
fix the 30 percent of overhead costs 
that go towards frivolous regulation, et 
cetera. That means they are planning 
to waste right off the top $160 billion of 
their own proposal. 
In California, with the high-speed 
rail boondoggle, they are setting aside 
$25 billion for a program that origi-
nally was going to cost $33 billion, ac-
cording to how it was sold to the vot-
ers. So this needs to be stopped and put 
into programs that people can actually 
use like their road system. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. BROWN), a member of the 
committee. 
b 1745 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. Speaker, first, let 
me thank Chairman DEFAZIO, Chair-
woman NORTON, and Chairman PAYNE 
for their leadership. 
This bill will get our infrastructure 
working 
again; 
fund 
new, 
trans-
formative projects; and create good- 
paying American jobs. We need 21st 
century infrastructure that meets the 
challenges facing the Nation, and that 
is exactly what the INVEST in Amer-
ica Act will do: 
With investments in our commu-
nities, including more than $6.2 billion 
to Maryland’s highway and transit sys-
tems; 
With an emphasis on equity, includ-
ing $3 billion to reconnect neighbor-
hoods, particularly communities of 
color separated from local economic 
opportunities and divided by decades of 
bad infrastructure policy; 
And with a modern approach to 
growth and development, including $134 
million to promote Transit Oriented 
Development needed to create thriving 
and inclusive communities around our 
transit 
hubs, 
and 
promote 
safe 
multimodal transits in communities 
like New Carrollton in my district. 
Mr. Speaker, this is a historic invest-
ment in America, and I urge its adop-
tion. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Arkansas (Mr. WESTERMAN). 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, the 
bill that passed the committee was par-
tisan and wasteful. 
As expected, the Speaker succeeded 
in making a bad bill even worse. That 
is crazy, but that is how it goes. 
And things are going wrong for rural 
America in this bill. In fact, it specifi-
cally bans building new roads and lets 
road and bridge funding expire while 
playing favorites with urban transit 
funding, like Amtrak and Speaker 
PELOSI’s pet train project. It mandates 
policies that make us more dependent 
on Chinese supply chains while Demo-
crats refuse to allow development of 
our own resources. 
The bill is more focused on the Green 
New Deal than the well-being of hard-
working 
Americans—spending 
now 
with promises to tax later. 
Speaker PELOSI said it herself last 
week. 
According 
to 
the 
Speaker: 
‘‘There ain’t gonna be no bipartisan 
bill, unless we have a reconciliation 
bill. Plain and simple. In fact, I use the 
word ‘ain’t.’ There ain’t going to be an 
infrastructure bill, unless we have the 
reconciliation bill passed by the United 
States Senate.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, listen to that. The 
Speaker is hellbent on raising your 
taxes and using them to increase 
wasteful spending. House Democrats, 
led by Speaker PELOSI, can’t even get 
on board with their Democrat col-
leagues in the Senate and administra-
tion. 
Maybe it is not too late to learn and 
do better. The STARTER Act is one 
way to move forward. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
whatever 
path 
we 
choose, it would be better than going 
off the rails on a crazy train bill like 
this one. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘no.’’ 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Geor-
gia (Ms. BOURDEAUX). 
Ms. BOURDEAUX. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today in support of the INVEST in 
America Act. 
This bill provides funding that will 
accelerate road repairs, reduce conges-
tion, and shore up our water systems, 
all while creating good-paying jobs and 
building sustainable, green infrastruc-
ture. 
Under the INVEST in America Act, 
Georgia will receive a $2.6 billion in-
crease in funding for core infrastruc-
ture programs over the next 5 years, a 
38 percent increase. With such an in-
vestment, we need to be innovative, 
forward-looking, 
and 
climate 
con-
scious. 
The 
bill 
includes 
many 
of 
my 
FutureFit The Suburbs initiatives, pro-
viding funding for the expansion of 
greenways, express lane transit options 
to decrease congestion, renewable en-
ergy projects, innovative wastewater 
technology, and more. 
The INVEST in America Act will 
jump-start innovation that will lead to 
economic growth in small towns, big 
cities, and suburban areas like mine. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote in support of the INVEST in 
America Act. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Ohio (Mr. BALDERSON). 
Mr. BALDERSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in opposition to H.R. 3684, the major-
ity’s ‘‘my-way-or-the-highway bill.’’ 
Rather than working with Repub-
licans to deliver a commonsense, bipar-
tisan bill that puts America’s real in-
frastructure needs center stage, the 
majority has decided to fast track its 
Green New Deal agenda. In fact, half of 
the funding in this bill is tied up meet-
ing Green New Deal mandates. 
The majority refused to work with 
Republicans on policies to streamline 
the permitting process for construction 
projects. These policies will save tax-
payers billions of dollars and move 
projects forward faster, while still en-
suring 
world-class 
environmental 
standards. 
Unfortunately, 
Republicans 
were 
shut out of the process, and the impact 
is clear. This bill places costly restric-
tions on local construction projects, in-
cludes catastrophic provisions that 
would put small trucking companies 
and independent truckers out of busi-
ness, and relies on deficit spending, 
which will further fuel the problem of 
inflation. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly encourage 
my colleagues to reject this partisan 
process and vote ‘‘no’’ on H.R. 3684. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Geor-
gia (Ms. WILLIAMS), a new and es-
teemed member of the committee. 
Ms. 
WILLIAMS 
of 
Georgia. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today in support of the 
INVEST in America Act, which in-
cludes the legislative provision based 
on my bill, the Reconnecting Neighbor-
hoods and Strengthening Communities 
Act. 
This act is a long overdue matter of 
racial justice and environmental jus-
tice. The Federal Highway Act of 1956 
built highways through the middle of 
cities, sometimes to intentionally dis-
place Black families, disconnecting 
thriving communities, and made dev-
astating economic impacts that still 
exist today. 
We have a responsibility to undo the 
harm of these intentional decisions. 
Two examples of these disenfranchising 
projects are in the Fifth District of 
Georgia that you see right next to me. 
The Sweet Auburn and Summerhill 
communities were divided by the con-
struction of the downtown connector 
and I–20. 
Millions of people in the districts 
across the country will benefit from 
the Reconnecting Neighborhoods Pro-
gram because the government built 
these projects in virtually every major 
city. 
My program invests in the redesign 
or removal of infrastructural barriers 
built through communities of color. It 
ensures the infrastructure of the future 
will serve communities rather than di-
vide them.

June 30, 2021 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Tennessee (Mr. BURCHETT). 
Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in opposition to this legislation. 
Improving and reauthorizing our Na-
tion’s surface transportation programs 
should take priority over advancing a 
very liberal, woke, partisan agenda. 
These programs should fund our roads, 
railways, and waterways, and should be 
the foundation of our country’s long- 
term economic success. 
Mr. Speaker, instead of working with 
Republicans, the majority advanced a 
partisan bill that dramatically in-
creases spending and regulation that 
would stifle development. I even had an 
amendment that was nonpartisan. It 
was just a technical correction, which 
was agreed upon by several Members, 
and it went straight down party lines. 
So if anybody tells you this is a bipar-
tisan bill, they are speaking with a 
very forked tongue. 
It redirects funding away from basic 
investments and physical infrastruc-
ture and towards social programs, new 
regulatory regimes, and government 
mandates on business. Out-of-control 
spending by Congress and the Biden ad-
ministration has triggered an inflation 
crisis that is leaving less money in the 
pockets of working folks. 
Mr. Speaker, American citizens can-
not afford another partisan spending 
boondoggle 
orchestrated 
by 
Wash-
ington liberals. I urge my colleagues to 
join me in opposing this bill. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. MALINOWSKI), a member of 
the committee. 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, the 
INVEST in America Act will put mil-
lions of Americans to work building 
21st century infrastructure that will 
make us again the envy of the world. 
This is not Eisenhower 7.0, as the 
chairman often reminds us. Of course, 
we are going to fix our highways, but 
we are not just going to keep building 
bigger and wider ones. We are going to 
do something as new and as bold today 
as the Interstate Highway System was 
in the 1950s. 
So, yes, the bill invests in EV charg-
ing. Yes, it makes record investments 
in passenger rail, including our impor-
tant Hudson Tunnel between New Jer-
sey and New York. 
And please, don’t tell New Jersey 
commuters that they are riding the 
Green New Deal to work every day. 
They just want better trains that will 
get there faster than they did 100 years 
ago. 
Anyone who wants to do just what we 
have been doing here for the last few 
decades is basically saying they want 
to let other countries, like China, mas-
ter and market the clean energy tech-
nologies of the future. 
Well, I am not going to cede our lead-
ership. I want America to win. I want 
America to do big and bold and great 
things again. 
Mr. Speaker, I am going to vote for 
this bill. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from South Dakota (Mr. JOHNSON). 
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. 
Speaker, railroad hauls 40 percent of 
America’s long-haul freight, but it 
makes up only 2 percent of our trans-
portation-based emissions. 
Now, unfortunately, the INVEST in 
America Act tells freight railroads 
that they need to replace all of their 
older locomotives with newer, albeit 
only marginally cleaner, fossil-fuel 
burning locomotives. And this will be 
incredibly 
expensive. 
Again, 
only 
slightly cleaner. And that cost will 
slow industry’s progress toward the de-
velopment 
of 
zero 
emission 
loco-
motives. 
There is a cleaner, a better, a less 
prescriptive, and a less expensive way 
to make this transition. You think 
about slowing the deployment of those 
locomotives will actually hinder the 
majority’s 
fight 
against 
climate 
change. 
Mr. Speaker, I would say that this 
part of the INVEST in America Act 
moves in the wrong direction, like so 
many parts of the INVEST in America 
Act, and it is one more good reason to 
vote ‘‘no.’’ 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, may I in-
quire how much time is remaining on 
both sides? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Oregon has 41⁄2 minutes re-
maining. The gentleman from Missouri 
has 12 minutes remaining. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman 
from New Jersey (Mr. VAN DREW). 
(Mr. VAN DREW asked and was given 
permission to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in opposition to H.R. 3684. 
Our country’s infrastructure is crum-
bling. Prices are surging everywhere. 
Yet before us is an infrastructure plan 
that fails to address America’s needs, 
and, in fact, will make our lives even 
more expensive. This bill neglects to 
fix the bureaucracy that makes the 
United States one of the most difficult 
places in the world to build infrastruc-
ture. 
The bill diminishes American energy 
prosperity and grows our dependence 
on the Chinese Communist Party’s 
slave labor. The bill makes goods and 
services more expensive by overregu-
lating American workers and American 
businesses. 
To put it simply, this bill makes it 
more expensive to be an American. 
We need truly bipartisan legislation 
to address the American infrastructure 
crisis. We should focus on traditional 
infrastructure by investing in roads 
and bridges and dams, as well as mod-
ern infrastructure of broadband inter-
net. We should strengthen American 
supply chains so that the American in-
frastructure boom is fueled by Amer-
ican materials, American workers, and 
American businesses. 
Mr. Speaker, these are the steps we 
must take to build a stronger America. 
I and all of us will never stop fighting 
for this vision of American greatness. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Arizona 
(Mr. STANTON), a member of the com-
mittee. 
Mr. STANTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the chairman for his incredible leader-
ship up to this point and moving for-
ward as we get the INVEST in America 
Act passed in this House and soon 
signed by the President of the United 
States. 
It is bold. It is transformative. And it 
is the investment we need now to com-
pete in the 21st century economy. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill includes long- 
delayed, incredibly important invest-
ments in Arizona’s roads, bridges, tran-
sit, rail, and water infrastructure. Ari-
zona will receive more than $5 billion 
for highways and almost $1 billion for 
transit. 
Importantly, it supports major Ari-
zona projects: I–11, public transit in 
cities big and small, key investments 
to support local communities, and im-
prove the way we move people and 
goods. 
It directs significant resources to our 
long overlooked Tribal communities 
throughout the State. It also addresses 
urgent water needs in my State by in-
creasing investments in drinking water 
and wastewater infrastructure. 
Mr. Speaker, the time for action is 
now, and I urge my colleagues to sup-
port this historic investment in the 
American people and our American 
economy. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Mississippi (Mr. GUEST). 
Mr. GUEST. Mr. Speaker, this legis-
lation includes more than $715 billion 
in wasteful spending. 
One out of every two dollars would go 
toward Green New Deal requirements. 
Funding for passenger rail for big cities 
has been increased eight-fold in this 
bill, sacrificing our rural roads and 
bridges for costly urban projects. The 
Electric Charging Station Grant Pro-
gram in this bill would receive four 
times more funding than a rural grant 
program and take away funding from 
States that don’t comply; even in 
States like Mississippi, which has less 
than 1,000 electric vehicles. 
This bill is bad for our economy. It is 
bad for our rural States. And without 
significant change, this bill is bad for 
America.

Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds

the 
gentlewoman

Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, 
this bill is so important to the Nation

spire.

June 30, 2021 
Thank you for the INVEST in Amer-
ica Act that looks at social equity, 
that realizes we cannot concrete our 
way to a better quality of life, that 
also invests in those issues of dams and 
bayous and roads and bridges, but at 
the same time recognizes the economic 
engine that climate change is, the eco-
nomic engine that investment in work-
ers is, and, as well, recognizes that we 
have a new day in America where tran-
sit is for everyone. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman 
for giving us transit for America. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. VAN DUYNE). 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Mr. Speaker, there 
are very few issues that we work on 
that have such an impact on every sin-
gle person’s daily life as an infrastruc-
ture bill. It is what moves people. It is 
what moves goods. 
That is why we need a bill that 
makes us globally competitive. We 
need a bill that builds roads and 
bridges. We need a bill that decreases 
traffic and improves people’s quality of 
life. Doing so, by the way, would de-
crease carbon emissions. But this bill 
actually bans new roads by stripping 
States of their ability to prioritize 
building new roads or bridges. 
We need a bill that makes it more ef-
ficient to move products from place to 
place, and we need a bill that takes 
control out of the hands of bureaucrats 
and empowers local leaders because 
they know best what their community 
needs. Unfortunately, this bill does 
none of those things. 
What it does do is increase inflation, 
cost, and debt. There are zero proposals 
to pay for this bill. It is not a serious 
attempt to legislate. It is another par-
tisan wish list and, sadly, another 
missed opportunity to uplift the every-
day lives of Americans. 
This misguided legislation is not 
what the American people need. I hope 
calmer heads will prevail, and we see 
that a real bipartisan effort to get this 
important work done actually happens. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Kansas (Ms. DAVIDS), the vice 
chair of the committee. 
Ms. 
DAVIDS 
of 
Kansas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise in support of the IN-
VEST in America Act. 
This comprehensive bill builds our 
economy back better than before, cre-
ates good-paying jobs, and tackles cli-
mate change. 
In the Kansas Third, there is a par-
ticular highway that has been a pri-
ority since my predecessor’s prede-
cessor. It is the busiest four-lane road 
in the State, experiencing increased 
crashes and constant congestion. 
Folks in our district disagree on 
plenty, but not this. U.S. 69 must be 
addressed. 
I am now the vice chair of the Trans-
portation 
and 
Infrastructure 
Com-
mittee, the first Kansan to serve on the 
committee in a decade. I am proud to 
say this bill puts us one step closer to 
bringing home the Federal investment 
necessary to reduce congestion, in-
crease safety, and attract economic de-
velopment. 
It also includes two provisions I in-
troduced on resiliency and responsible 
financing, saving taxpayer money and 
bringing smart investments home. 
For the people sitting in traffic, 
waiting for the bus in Wyandotte Coun-
ty, or wondering why that one road 
floods every year no matter how many 
times we fix it, this cannot wait. If we 
fail to act, these authorizations will 
run out by October. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support the INVEST in 
America Act to create jobs and propel 
our infrastructure into the modern era. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam 
Speaker, can I inquire as to how much 
time is remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
JACKSON
LEE). The gentleman from 
Missouri has 81⁄2 minutes remaining. 
The gentleman from Oregon has 2 min-
utes remaining. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Virginia (Mr. CLINE). 
Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, rather 
than working across the aisle to ad-
vance a bipartisan highway bill, as 
they are attempting to do in the Sen-
ate, House Democrats have jammed a 
partisan bill through to the floor that 
puts America on a road to nowhere. 
This bill is nothing but a partisan 
wish list that prioritizes the Green 
New Deal agenda over the core needs of 
our Nation’s infrastructure, like roads 
and bridges. In fact, the bill before us 
would actually prevent the building of 
new roads, ripping away the ability of 
States to prioritize the needs of local 
communities. 
I was sent to Washington to ensure 
our government is transparent and ac-
countable for every action it takes. 
Spending $1 out of every $2 to comply 
with Green New Deal mandates is abso-
lutely ludicrous. 
I will not accept a deal that puts big 
cities and Big Government over the in-
terests of the American taxpayers who 
I represent in rural America. 
We are willing and open to negoti-
ating realistic ways to rebuild our 
highways and infrastructure, but it 
must be done in a fiscally responsible 
manner and not through deficit spend-
ing. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote 
on this misguided piece of legislation. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from North Carolina (Mr. MUR-
PHY). 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, today, I rise in oppo-
sition to H.R. 3684. American infra-
structure is in dire need of repair, but 
this is just not the way to do it. 
One provision lifts a longtime ban 
against spending Federal money on art 
and nonfunctional landscaping. It is 
sad when tax dollars are diverted to af-
ford art projects rather than fixing 
crumbling 
bridges, 
buildings, 
and 
roads. 
That is why I introduced H.R. 3208, 
which would amend the U.S. Code to 
explicitly define what the term ‘‘infra-
structure’’ means so we can better allo-
cate taxpayer dollars. In my bill, the 
term ‘‘infrastructure’’ is defined as 
being 
specific 
to 
bridges, 
dams, 
wharves, roads, highways, ports, build-
ings, and public utilities, including 
broadband, airports, and train stations, 
not childcare. 
This 
messaging 
bill 
prioritizes 
Pelosi’s party and its green agenda 
over the needs of this great Nation. I 
urge my colleagues to vigorously op-
pose passage of this misguided bill. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. NEHLS). 
Mr. NEHLS. Madam Speaker, my 
amendment, which was rejected by the 
majority, calls for cities—think about 
this now—that have defunded their po-
lice forces from receiving Federal Na-
tional Highway Traffic Safety Admin-
istration grants for traffic enforce-
ment. 
Look at Austin, look at Seattle, look 
at Oakland, look at New York, millions 
and millions of dollars being defunded 
from their local law enforcement agen-
cies. They should not be eligible to 
apply for Federal grant funds in the 
millions of dollars after they have cho-
sen to defund their own agencies. It 
makes no sense. 
Look at Oakland and look at the 
other cities today. Crime is on the rise. 
Violence in these liberal cities is out of 
control, and still, these cities continue 
to defund their police departments. 
They should not be allowed to tap into 
Federal grant moneys when they have 
chosen to defund their police. 
Madam Speaker, I cannot support 
such hypocrisy, and I will be voting 
against this bill. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, this bill basically 
lets the American people down. This is 
a missed opportunity for partnership, a 
chance to come together and pass a bill 
that addresses the real infrastructure 
needs of all of our communities, from 
the largest cities right down to our 
most rural areas. 
Members on the other side have said 
that they don’t want another tradi-
tional highway bill, but we can’t aban-
don our roads and bridges just to say 
we want something new. Our core in-
frastructure has become traditional be-
cause Americans depend on it to work, 
travel, and live. 
That is why every highway bill that 
has become law for at least the last 
three decades has done so based on bi-
partisanship, Democrats and Repub-
licans sitting down together with their

priorities and putting in the work to 
find common ground that both sides 
can support. 
We could have found common ground 
and achieved many of the goals while 
addressing Republican priorities, as 
well. That is what the American people 
want us to do. That is what the Presi-
dent at least said that he wanted, and 
that is what the Speaker actually said 
she wanted our committees to do. 
But the process that led us here 
didn’t reflect any of those calls to 
unity. What is even more frustrating is 
that we did have a bipartisan agree-
ment in place, at least part of it, ready 
to take up again, and that was the 
wastewater section of this bill. But the 
majority, again, blatantly rejected the 
chance to work together on another in-
frastructure issue that has been and 
should continue to be bipartisan. 
This bill only reflects the majority’s 
one-size-fits-all vision for what they 
think our infrastructure should look 
like. It doesn’t reflect the realities of 
what actually addresses the needs of 
our communities. 
Today, I am going to ask my col-
leagues to consider this: Does this help 
your communities? Do you consider art 
to be infrastructure? Do you feel good 
about spending $550 billion on a high-
way bill that restricts communities 
from building highways? Most impor-
tantly, can you ignore the reality of 
spending more than $715 billion with no 
pay-fors, no revenue title, just piling 
more debt onto our children’s future 
and driving up inflation? 
For me, that answer is really simple. 
It is no. 
What is worse, progressives are not 
going to let this bill or any real infra-
structure bill become law unless they 
get their $6 trillion partisan wish list. 
They are holding infrastructure hos-
tage to achieve their socialist tax and 
spend agenda. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to oppose this bill and the ma-
jority’s partisan process, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, we have heard a lot 
from their side that we should have 
worked with them. They offered an al-
ternative. They have talked a lot about 
how we are not putting money into 
bridges and highways. We are putting 
in $333 billion, and they put in $310 bil-
lion, and I am not even sure that they 
included anything on safety. They had 
zero on rail—zero—and status quo for 
transit. That is a 21st century trans-
portation bill? 
As I mentioned earlier, we have built 
35,000 lane miles in the hundred largest 
cities. Guess what? They are running 
out of space. They have to tear down 
neighborhoods to build any more, and 
it is not working. 
Congestion is six times worse than it 
was 35 years ago. Americans waste $170 
billion a year in congestion. Business 
wastes time in congestion. 
We need to solve these problems, and 
we have to look at new ways of solving 
these problems. What we have been 
doing since Dwight David Eisenhower 
was great at the time. It doesn’t work 
in the 21st century. 
They continue to deny the threat of 
climate change or even the existence of 
climate change. I tried to say: Okay, 
you can’t acknowledge climate change. 
Trump won’t let you do that, and fossil 
fuel contributors won’t let you do that. 
How about this? You acknowledge that 
there is a business case to be made. 
GM is going all electric, all electric 
in 2035. Where are they going to 
charge? You have four companies mak-
ing 80,000-pound tractor semis. Fred 
Smith, FedEx, going all electric in the 
near term—no place to charge them ex-
cept at fleet headquarters. They have 
to be able to charge on the road. 
But, no, we shouldn’t invest in EV 
charging. We should just keep doing 
the same thing. We should keep pol-
luting the atmosphere. 
But they do believe in resilience. We 
have to build up Louisiana and other 
places, Florida, to deal with sea level 
rise. Why is the sea level rising? We 
have to deal with extraordinary, un-
precedented climate events. We have to 
deal with those in rebuilding our infra-
structure. ‘‘Oh, no. Why is that hap-
pening?’’ ‘‘Don’t worry about that.’’ 
We will do that, but we will not go to 
the root cause. 
We are doing all three. We are re-
building resilient; we are rebuilding 
America and creating jobs. We are 
making the country more efficient. 
And we are dealing with climate 
change. This is the 21st century. Deal 
with the threats of the 21st century. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the Committee on Transpor-
tation and Infrastructure has expired. 
b 1815 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, the INVEST in 
America Act marks an important first 
step forward on President Biden’s jobs 
agenda. This legislation invests in sur-
face and water infrastructure to create 
jobs, revitalize the economy, and im-
prove public health. 
I appreciate all the hard work that 
Chairman DEFAZIO and the members of 
the Transportation and Infrastructure 
Committee have done to make our 
transportation sector greener and more 
equitable. 
I am proud of the important drinking 
water legislation and vehicle safety 
legislation that is included in this bill 
that came out of my committee, the 
Energy and Commerce Committee. 
Madam Speaker, the drinking water 
provisions of this bill combine two 
pieces of legislation, the AQUA Act of 
2021, authored by Environment and Cli-
mate Change Subcommittee Chairman 
TONKO, and the Low-Income Water Cus-
tomer Assistance Program led by Rep-
resentatives BLUNT ROCHESTER, KATKO, 
DINGELL, and TLAIB. 
Safe drinking water is one of our 
most fundamental human rights, yet 
right now, there are millions of Ameri-
cans across the country who cannot 
trust that the water coming out of 
their taps is safe. That is simply unac-
ceptable, and it is why the INVEST in 
America Act invests $117 billion to ad-
dress drinking water infrastructure 
safety and affordability. 
The legislation increases authoriza-
tions for drinking water programs by 
more than $80 billion, including fund-
ing to replace lead service lines nation-
wide. There is no safe level of lead ex-
posure. It comes with tremendous 
human health risks, and that is why we 
must replace the lead service lines that 
deliver our water and ensure every 
home is safe from lead contamination. 
The legislation also funds water re-
siliency 
programs, 
school 
drinking 
water safety programs, and Tribal 
water programs. Investments in drink-
ing water infrastructure have a proven 
track record of creating jobs while im-
proving public health protections. Re-
quirements included in this bill will 
ensure those jobs and those health ben-
efits reach environmental justice com-
munities. 
The bill will also improve drinking 
water safety by repairing the broken 
standard-setting process under the Safe 
Drinking Water Act. We all know that 
we need to do more to ensure the safe-
ty of our drinking water. This bill 
would make targeted changes and set 
deadlines to empower the EPA to set 
the protective drinking water stand-
ards that our communities need. 
Madam Speaker, the bill provides as-
sistance to low-income families so they 
can afford their water bills. Financial 
hardship should not stand between any 
family and basic access to water. This 
bill creates two water assistance pro-
grams similar to the successful Low In-
come Home Energy Assistance Pro-
gram, better known as LIHEAP. 
We also authorize funding to reduce 
or eliminate customer debt and pro-
hibit water service shutoffs for 5 years 
for the participating water systems. 
These funds will give families peace of 
mind that they will continue to have 
access to safe, clean, and affordable 
water. 
The legislation also includes auto 
safety reforms that mandate proven 
safety technologies that could save 
20,000 lives per year. In 2020 alone ve-
hicular crashes resulted in over 42,000 
deaths. The INVEST in America Act 
includes a bold vision of safety and in-
novation that will save lives, boost do-
mestic manufacturing, and strengthen 
our industrial base. The safety reforms 
will 
deploy 
existing 
proven 
tech-
nologies that can have immediate life-
saving effects such as crash avoidance 
systems, 
drunk 
driving 
prevention 
technology, and it will put an end to 
children dying in hot cars. 
It also includes my Five-Stars for 
Safe Cars Act, legislation modernizing 
the five-star safety rating for the 21st 
century, 
providing 
consumers 
with

meaningful comparative information 
about the safety of vehicles. 
Now, in addition to our water and 
safety 
provisions, 
Madam 
Speaker, 
there are several important amend-
ments that will strengthen the bill 
even further. 
Particularly, I urge support for an 
amendment 
from 
Energy 
Sub-
committee Chairman RUSH that will 
supercharge electric vehicle infrastruc-
ture and electric vehicle deployment. 
It also encourages the domestic manu-
facturing of electric vehicle and infra-
structure components. 
I also urge support for Representa-
tive DINGELL’s clean energy technology 
accelerator amendment that incor-
porates her bipartisan legislation with 
Representative YOUNG and provides fi-
nancing for clean energy infrastruc-
ture. 
So, Madam Speaker, the INVEST in 
America Act is transformative legisla-
tion that focuses our investments 
where they belong: revitalizing and 
modernizing our infrastructure, cre-
ating new, good-paying jobs, and tak-
ing a critical step to fulfill President 
Biden’s promise to build back better. 
Madam Speaker, I urge strong bipar-
tisan support for this legislation, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today on H.R. 
3684, the INVEST in America Act. 
I support improving America’s infra-
structure, but even a broad definition 
of infrastructure doesn’t include cre-
ating a massive network of centralized 
planning, 
unreasonable 
regulations, 
and undisciplined debt. This is not how 
we win the future. 
We have shown how working together 
can result in positive improvements for 
drinking water systems. Take the 
America’s Water Infrastructure Act of 
2018, AWIA, which was a huge bipar-
tisan win for water infrastructure. 
Today, while the bill before us renews 
several AWIA authorizations, H.R. 3684 
is plagued by significant controversial 
policy choices. 
First, it authorizes drinking water 
loan fund spending amounts that are 
triple those requested in the Presi-
dent’s fiscal year 2022 budget, $1.35 bil-
lion versus $4.14 billion. 
It also layers an expensive, new, 10- 
year, $45 billion public and privately 
owned lead service replacement pro-
gram on top of two existing EPA pro-
grams. It does so even though EPA is 
at least 2 years away from determining 
where lead service lines should be re-
placed, and the costs involved. 
Second, the legislation makes radical 
changes to EPA’s regulatory authority 
for drinking water contaminants. It 
promotes 
stringency 
rather 
than 
health. 
It will raise costs on all customers, 
including low-and middle-income fami-
lies and punish communities with the 
lowest rate bases. 
H.R. 3684 strikes the requirement in 
the Safe Drinking Water Act that costs 
of a regulation be in line with its 
health benefits. That allows commu-
nities to protect public health without 
overspending their finite public health 
resources on minimal risks. Commu-
nities must be allowed to prioritize 
their limited resources on their most 
pressing concerns. 
The INVEST in America Act also re-
moves language permitting our lowest 
and smallest communities—with EPA 
approval—to use more affordable tech-
nology that protects people’s health. 
This bill authorizes $4 billion to pay 
off unpaid bills from the last 15 
months—even though Congress has al-
ready provided at least $1.1 billion to 
do this. Importantly, water systems 
that participate in this program are 
prohibited from collecting old amounts 
from their customers for 5 years, re-
gardless of income. This will cripple 
water systems’ ability to meet ex-
penses and plan. 
If that is not enough, H.R. 3684 cre-
ates a new, $8 billion entitlement pro-
gram at the EPA. This is EPA’s first- 
ever entitlement program. It creates 
barriers for smaller, poorer, water sys-
tems and requires EPA to study the 
need for this program only after it 
starts handing out all this money. 
Without dramatic changes, I can’t 
support this bill, and I urge opposition. 
I encourage all Members of the House 
to support Republican amendments 
that correct its deficits, including my 
amendment 
with 
Ranking 
Member 
MCKINLEY, which builds upon the 2018 
bipartisan 
efforts 
and 
reauthorizes 
more than $11 billion for the bipartisan 
drinking water programs from AWIA. 
I also have to address the so-called 
auto safety title that the majority 
dropped into this bill. 
In mid-April we agreed with the En-
ergy and Commerce Committee Demo-
crats to circulate a draft auto safety 
title to stakeholders, largely written 
by the Democrats, that included a pro-
posal promoting autonomous vehicles. 
We worked in good faith—even when 
the majority backed off on their com-
mitment for a legislative hearing. Our 
patience seemed to be rewarded with 
this rushed measure without even a 
markup. 
It is notable that the framework for 
autonomous vehicles is missing in this 
legislation before us. We must provide 
a pathway for America to beat China 
and lead in the testing and the deploy-
ment of AVs. 
This deficiency is a gift to the trial 
lawyers who make money off of unsafe 
roads. 
It rewards the Teamsters, who com-
pletely misunderstood that our juris-
diction only includes passenger vehi-
cles and not trucking. Their opposition 
hurts their brothers and sisters in 
labor who want to make these vehicles. 
Sadly, this failure will hurt vulner-
able communities. AV legislation, au-
tonomous vehicles, self-driving cars, 
would deliver a whole new form of mo-
bility for seniors and people with dis-
abilities. 
Our economy and national security is 
also compromised here as well. Inac-
tion cedes the leadership of driverless 
cars to China, just like we did for com-
munication equipment companies. It is 
not acceptable. We can do better. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. MCNERNEY), who is a 
member of our committee and always 
looking to make everything green. 
Mr. MCNERNEY. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of H.R. 3684, the 
INVEST in America Act, and in sup-
port of my amendment to this legisla-
tion. 
Water main breaks are one of the 
most visible signs of our deteriorating 
infrastructure. Some of our Nation’s 
water pipes date back to the 19th cen-
tury, and many are reaching the end of 
their designed lifetime. 
Reports have found a 27 percent in-
crease in water main breaks between 
2012 and 2018—that is 6 years—equating 
to a break every 2 minutes nationwide. 
Despite vast economic implications, 
most water main breaks don’t even 
make the local news, and consistent 
data about them is not regularly col-
lected. And as California faces the 
worst drought in decades, we do not 
have the luxury of remaining in the 
dark about our most valuable resource. 
Under my amendment, data on water 
main breaks will be compiled in a pub-
licly accessible database that will offer 
great opportunities for analysis and in-
sights into this nationwide problem. 
Increasing the consistent reporting 
of breaks will shine new light on the 
magnitude of this water infrastructure 
challenge and help us track the pace of 
improvements as we make needed re-
pairs and replacements. The knowledge 
to be drawn from this new database 
will help all our drinking water utili-
ties become more resilient in facing 
the challenges of climate change. 
Furthermore, the work done by my 
colleagues and me in the Energy and 
Commerce Committee will ensure cru-
cial drinking and wastewater infra-
structure improvements that commu-
nities across the Nation desperately 
need. These provisions not only im-
prove the water we drink and help keep 
pollution out of our rivers and lakes, 
they will also create good-paying jobs 
and tackle the climate crisis head-on. 
Lastly, this legislation recognizes 
that working directly with our commu-
nities is the best way to identify the 
unique infrastructure needs of our spe-
cific districts. As a result, my district 
is set to receive much-needed funding 
for six separate infrastructure projects 
spanning road, rail, and public trans-
portation infrastructure. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support it. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Ohio (Mr. LATTA), who is 
the 
ranking 
member 
of 
the 
Sub-
committee on Communications and 
Technology.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3516 
June 30, 2021 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to voice 
my disappointment and opposition to 
the INVEST in America Act and the 
amendment process. 
The majority has missed the mark 
with this so-called infrastructure bill 
that doesn’t even allow States to build 
new roads or bridges. 
How are my constituents in rural 
Van Wert County going to get to 
school, work, doctor’s appointments, or 
the grocery store without roads to 
drive on? 
Rural America is not considered in 
this bill, and it does not increase safety 
on our roads. 
I filed my legislation, the SELF 
DRIVE Act, as an amendment to create 
a Federal safety framework for autono-
mous vehicles, but it was not made in 
order. My amendment would have sup-
ported the safe testing and deployment 
of self-driving cars. This technology 
will save lives on roads, improve mobil-
ity for seniors and individuals with dis-
abilities, and keep innovation and jobs 
in America. 
Ironically enough, an amendment ex-
pressing the sense of the House to de-
velop this type of Federal framework 
was made in order. Yet the bipartisan 
solution—the actual framework to im-
prove roadway safety—will not be con-
sidered on the floor today. 
I am disappointed this House is not 
prioritizing safety and American lead-
ership by supporting self-driving vehi-
cles. I remain at the table to work with 
Members on both sides of the aisle to 
enact legislation establishing a na-
tional AV framework. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, may 
I inquire about the time remaining on 
each side. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania has 81⁄2 min-
utes remaining. The gentleman from 
New Jersey has 81⁄2 minutes remaining. 
b 1830 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. TONKO), who is the au-
thor of the AQUA Act, which is the in-
frastructure piece of the water bill, and 
the chairman of the Environment and 
Climate Change Subcommittee. 
Mr. TONKO. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
Every life and every job depends on 
safe drinking water. Unfortunately, 
our water systems have been under-
funded for decades, and the EPA has 
been unable to finalize new national 
standards since 1996. 
Division I will enhance our drinking 
water infrastructure, its quality, and 
its affordability. This bill includes the 
investments and the policy reforms 
that will make the Safe Drinking 
Water Act actually live up to its name. 
It significantly increases funding for 
the State Revolving Fund. It funds lead 
line removals to the full extent. It ad-
dresses PFAS contaminations, which 
are an endangerment to public health. 
This is a down payment on critical 
public health infrastructure that must 
be part of our infrastructure invest-
ments moving forward. We know our 
water systems need these dollars; and 
our constituents deserve to have safe, 
reliable, and affordable water, free 
from lead, from PFAS, and other dan-
gerous contaminants. 
We need to be stronger partners with 
those at the local levels of government. 
So I encourage support of this measure. 
I thank Rick Kessler, Jacqueline 
Cohen, Anthony Gutierrez, Rebecca 
Tomilchik, and last, but not least, 
Brendan Larkin from the committee 
staff for their long hours put into this 
effort and their diligence as it relates 
to this division. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to sup-
port this bill. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. BILIRAKIS), 
my friend and colleague. 
Mr. 
BILIRAKIS. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank my friend from Pennsylvania, a 
great member of the Energy and Com-
merce Committee. 
I want to express my disappointment 
with the inclusion of a partisan auto 
safety title in this legislation before us 
today. I hope the Senate is listening 
and sees that this does not represent a 
consensus, since this product com-
pletely bypassed the Energy and Com-
merce Committee. 
We even agreed in April to circulate 
a draft safety title to stakeholders 
with our majority counterparts; drafts, 
I would add, that were largely written 
by them. But, sadly, they walked away 
from their own proposals, completely 
ignoring minority and stakeholder con-
cerns, and bypassed regular order alto-
gether. 
One could only surmise that the di-
rective came straight from the major-
ity leadership. 
And for what? To snatch defeat from 
the jaws of a bipartisan victory? 
The National Federation of the Blind 
even supported an amendment I draft-
ed, with their input, to increase trans-
portation access and benefits for Amer-
icans with disabilities. The Rules Com-
mittee voted not to make it in order. It 
is truly puzzling that a vote for this 
previously bipartisan initiative would 
fall victim to such partisan politics. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on 
this legislation. We need to get back to 
the table and deliver for those who are 
left behind by this partisan bill. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Oregon 
(Mr. SCHRADER). 
Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Speaker, I 
strongly support the energy and com-
merce provisions in the INVEST in 
America Act. 
I would like to speak briefly about 
the surface transportation side. An 
amendment I have in there adds a goal 
to the Highway Bridge Replacement 
and Rehabilitation Program that these 
investments increase the resiliency of 
bridges, including the ability to with-
stand disruptions from a seismic event. 
The Pacific Northwest is due for a 
major seismic event, and our commu-
nities need to be able to take the nec-
essary steps to ensure our infrastruc-
ture can withstand these disasters. 
This amendment will make that a pos-
sibility and ensure that projects focus-
ing 
on 
seismic 
resiliency 
are 
prioritized by the U.S. Department of 
Transportation when they submit ap-
plications. 
In my district, Interstate 205 is set 
for a massive retrofitting to improve 
the vital passenger and freight corridor 
and mitigate the awful congestion 
many of our communities currently 
face. 
One of the key components of this 
project is to retrofit the Abernathy 
Bridge and make it seismically resil-
ient. This bridge is a critical span over 
the Willamette River and will be essen-
tial in the event of a major disaster to 
coordinate first responders and sup-
plies to affected Oregonians. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to offer the 
amendment. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from South Carolina (Mr. DUN-
CAN). 
Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, this bill 
is riddled with problems, but one exam-
ple I want to focus on right now is the 
Low-Income Water Customer Assist-
ance Program. 
I have an amendment that would rein 
in some of this program’s outlandish 
spending and take a more targeted ap-
proach at water assistance. 
Let me be very clear. I am not saying 
that there is not a need for a program 
such as this, and I am not saying that 
some people wouldn’t benefit from it. 
All I am saying is that we should figure 
out the best way to attack the problem 
before authorizing $8 billion to fund it. 
Funding the program prior to a study 
is backwards. 
The logical first step is to determine 
the scope of the problem, rather than 
just throwing money at it; and my 
amendment would do just that. 
I would argue that the Democrats 
even recognize the need for a study. 
They included it in the bill. I am just 
arguing it should be done before the 
implementation of a permanent enti-
tlement at the EPA, the very first of 
its kind, when the EPA said they didn’t 
have the logistics or the ability to run 
the program. 
This is irresponsible government, and 
it will come at the cost of taxpayers. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
consider this and vote ‘‘no’’ on the un-
derlying bill. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Ms. TLAIB), who has been so 
helpful in putting together the infra-
structure and the assistance program 
in this bill. 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, during my 
time in Congress, I have made it my 
mission to put into policy what we all 
should know to be true: That safe, 
clean water is a human right; that 
water is life.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3517 
June 30, 2021 
This bill includes critical water pro-
visions that will provide clean, afford-
able drinking water. Over 60 schools in 
one of my cities alone has garbage bags 
over their drinking fountains. So we 
must invest in lead pipe and school 
drinking fountain replacement so that 
no child has to drink poisoned water. 
This bill gets us closer to that. 
We invest in water debt relief and 
low-income assistance so that nobody 
has to suffer the indignity of having 
their water shut off and having to rely 
on bottled water or collecting rain-
water. 
A couple in my district, Mr. Speaker, 
had to melt snow just to flush their 
toilets. 
Millions of Americans have experi-
enced inhumane water shutoffs, but 
this bill declares that nobody, espe-
cially our poor neighbors, should live 
without water in our country. We will 
stop water shutoffs. 
And my amendment helps families to 
make it clear that everyone receiving 
assistance must be reconnected and 
stays connected. Again, we are getting 
closer to the root causes of shutoffs be-
cause in this bill we include reporting 
and data collection that is so critically 
important to understand why water is 
becoming unaffordable and inacces-
sible. 
Again, it is important at all levels of 
government that we continue to work 
together in truly making water a 
human right. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. LESKO), 
my colleague and a member of the En-
ergy and Commerce Committee. 
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
opposition to this bill. 
This bill should be focused on pro-
posals that make the United States 
more competitive in the global econ-
omy, and update our Nation’s infra-
structure; but instead it is filled with 
detrimental mandates. 
Despite the fact that rail offers one 
of the most environmentally efficient 
ways to transport goods, this bill in-
cludes regulations that undermine the 
railroad industry’s ability to offer com-
petitive services. The bill effectively 
prohibits movement of liquefied nat-
ural gas by rail, despite extensive re-
search into the safety of this method 
by the Department of Transportation. 
This legislation also would allow the 
EPA to enact burdensome regulations 
on drinking water utilities, driving up 
costs for low-income consumers. 
Under these new regulations, drink-
ing water utilities that serve smaller, 
lower-income communities cannot re-
ceive direct funding from the EPA. 
This harms low-income consumers and 
those on fixed incomes. They will have 
to jump through burdensome hoops and 
will face increased costs that many of 
them cannot afford. 
In drafting this bill, Democrats have 
pushed aside commonsense solutions to 
push their radical, partisan agenda. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
oppose this bill. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. GARCI´A). 
Mr. GARCI´A of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, 
I commend both Chairman PALLONE 
and Chairman DEFAZIO for their excel-
lent work on moving forward the IN-
VEST in America Act and clean water 
work as well. 
I fought hard to advance equitable 
transit oriented development, create a 
National Frontline Transit Workforce 
Development Center, and ensure that 
our transportation system is focused 
on providing access to jobs and services 
for those who need it. 
As we move forward toward a rec-
onciliation package, I will keep fight-
ing for robust investments to reduce 
carbon emissions and air pollution 
from transportation; expand mass tran-
sit and biking and walking options; and 
electrify every public transit bus, 
school bus, and commuter railroad in 
this country. 
Mr. Speaker, we cannot wait any 
more for bold action. The climate cri-
sis certainly won’t wait. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, can I 
ask again how much time remains on 
each side? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
MORELLE). The gentleman from New 
Jersey has 31⁄2 minutes remaining. The 
gentleman from Pennsylvania has 41⁄2 
minutes remaining. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Illi-
nois (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY), who is the 
chair of our Consumer Protection and 
Commerce Subcommittee, and is the 
author of many of the auto safety pro-
visions in this bill. 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank Chairman PALLONE for getting a 
transformative auto safety package 
into the INVEST in America Act. This 
will save tens of thousands of lives if 
we can get this passed, and I hope that 
we will see that happen. 
We had a press conference this morn-
ing where we had people who have suf-
fered such great harm. We heard the 
story of a limousine with 18 people, 6 
from one family, that went up in 
flames because of a drunk driver. 
We heard from a woman whose child 
died in a hot car. We have the Hot Car 
Act that would make sure that there is 
a warning that there is a child in the 
back seat, because 1,000 children, ba-
bies and toddlers, have died since 1990 
in hot cars. This was a press conference 
with tears and anguish for preventable 
things, and I am so grateful that this is 
in the legislation. 
I also just want to say that the city 
of Chicago has the most water lines 
with lead inside of them, and this legis-
lation will deal with water safety. And 
this is so important because the lead 
poisoning does not go away. Children 
are affected for life because of that. 
So the bills that I am talking about 
are lifesavers as part of this whole 
package of the INVEST in America 
Act. 
I also want to thank Representative 
PETER DEFAZIO for his great work in 
putting this together. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
I rise to oppose H.R. 3684 as a whole, 
and, in particular, the AQUA Act. This 
is yet another partisan attempt at un-
necessary and costly legislation. These 
rush-to-spend bills are bad for rural 
America. They are bad for my constitu-
ents. 
b 1845 
Every Member in this Congress wants 
safe drinking water for their commu-
nities and constituents. That is why we 
have already spent over $1 billion in 
the last 6 months on drinking water 
and on wastewater assistance. 
The additional tens of billions of dol-
lars that this legislation will spend is 
wasteful and gratuitous. Under this 
proposal, the EPA will be tasked, for 
the first time, with administering a 
welfare program, which will be worth 
$8 billion. 
Worse yet, these bills restrict the 
rights of local and municipal authori-
ties to best meet their customers’ 
needs. In this legislation, local water 
utilities are prevented from taking ac-
tion to collect overdue payments for up 
to 5 years, regardless of the income 
level of the offenders. 
It would rescind flexibility for mod-
est communities to have variances for 
their small water systems. 
Furthermore, it would repeal provi-
sions in the Safe Drinking Water Act 
that prohibit burdensome regulations 
where costs exceed benefits. 
Unfortunately, this legislation yet 
again demonstrates the Democrats’ fix-
ation on urban centers while leaving 
rural Americans behind. 
For all of these reasons, I strongly 
urge my colleagues to join me in vot-
ing ‘‘no,’’ and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
I respect my colleague from Pennsyl-
vania, but I have to say, I totally dis-
agree that this legislation is not nec-
essary. 
We know that America’s drinking 
water infrastructure is failing. Anyone 
who experienced what happened in 
Flint, Michigan, or my own State, in 
Newark, knows that there are all of 
these lead pipes out there that need to 
be replaced. Congress has to take bold 
action 
to 
deliver 
crucial 
drinking 
water improvements that communities 
all around the Nation desperately need. 
I heard what my colleague, Congress-
woman TLAIB, said, that safe drinking 
water is a fundamental human right, 
and that is true. These bills include 
significant 
and 
meaningful 
invest-
ments and reform that will ensure that 
every household has safe, reliable, and 
affordable drinking water. 
Congresswoman TLAIB and the Michi-
gan delegation, they really brought

home to us, practically speaking, what 
needs to be done here, both with the in-
frastructure improvements for drink-
ing water as well as for the assistance 
for households and those with debt. 
Mr. Speaker, this is a very important 
bill. I urge bipartisan support, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, in November, the 
American people elected leaders committed to 
not only recovering from the pandemic and 
economic crisis, but to Building Back Better. 
Americans know that now is the time to act 
boldly with a once-in-a-century investment to 
rebuild our nation’s infrastructure. 
With the INVEST in America Act, Democrats 
are honoring the faith placed in us, as we 
seize this historic opportunity to Build Back 
Better. 
Thank you to Chair PETER DEFAZIO, who 
has been masterful in putting together this 
strong, jobs-creating package to rebuild Amer-
ica. Thanks also to Chair FRANK PALLONE, and 
to members of both committees for ensuring 
that the priorities of all our communities are 
represented in this legislation. 
INVEST IN AMERICA ACT 
This package was developed with the ben-
efit of regular order, after dozens of hours of 
hearings and mark-ups, and hundreds of 
amendments debated. 
And—proudly—as a result, it is trans-
formative. It contains the goals of the Presi-
dent’s American Jobs Plan, as it puts America 
on a path to create millions of good-paying 
jobs, ensure we can out-compete any other 
country and power economic growth for dec-
ades. 
NEED FOR INVESTMENT 
And it is desperately needed: America ranks 
13th in infrastructure quality, with the Amer-
ican Society of Civil Engineer awarding us a 
‘‘C-’’ grade. 
We face a maintenance backlog of over $1 
trillion in transportation alone—imposing seri-
ous costs on businesses and workers, who 
bear the burden of congestion, delays and 
missed opportunity. 
As I often say, the most expensive mainte-
nance is no maintenance. 
COMPETITIVENESS 
The INVEST in America Act will not only re-
build our infrastructure; it will rebuild our mid-
dle class—connecting workers with good-pay-
ing union jobs with benefits and helping work-
ing families recover from the pandemic and 
economic crisis. 
It puts equity front and center. Its benefits 
target underserved communities: communities 
of color, rural communities and places with 
persistent poverty. 
And it will take us into the future: advancing 
a zero-emissions future by expanding trans-
portation alternatives, targeting pollution re-
duction, using greener materials and investing 
in resilient infrastructure. 
EV INFRASTRUCTURE 
We are particularly proud of the investments 
that this legislation makes in electric vehicle 
charging infrastructure. 
This spring, before Easter, Chair DEFAZIO 
held a bipartisan hearing on electrification in 
which CEOs from companies such as FedEx 
testified. And they all, including Fred Smith of 
FedEx, said, ‘‘We’re going electric.’’ 
Electric vehicles are the future, and America 
cannot be left behind. 
DETAILS 
The American people across parties support 
these initiatives, which include: 
$343 billion investment in roads, bridges 
and safety: a more than 50 percent increase, 
focused on fixing existing infrastructure, in-
cluding with $32 billion to ensure bridges in 
communities of all sizes are safer, more reli-
able and more resilient. 
$109 billion for transit: a record investment 
to increase routes, reduce the maintenance 
backlog, expand service for rural communities 
and low-income riders and invest in zero-emis-
sion vehicles. 
$95 billion for passenger and freight rail: tri-
pling Amtrak funding for better service, re-
duced congestion and improved rail safety. 
We are particularly proud of the funding se-
cured for the development of high-speed rail— 
which is the future. 
Over $50 billion for wastewater infrastruc-
ture: improving services for vulnerable com-
munities and prioritizing energy efficiency and 
resilience. 
$117 billion for drinking water infrastructure, 
including to replace the 10 million lead service 
lines in use nationwide, including at an esti-
mated 400,000 schools and child care facili-
ties. As many here. I have traveled to Flint, 
Michigan over time and seen the dire need for 
improved drinking water infrastructure in this 
and so any other communities. 
NEXT STEPS: JOBS & FAMILIES PLANS 
The American people want and expect us to 
pass this legislation. 
Once we do so, the House will work with 
the Senate to ensure that the strong and bi-
partisan provisions of our legislation are in-
cluded in the final package. And we will work 
with them to secure robust investments in par-
ents, workers and young people through the 
American Families Plan. 
Our responsibility—and our pledge—is to 
pass and enact an infrastructure package and 
reconciliation bill that truly meet the needs of 
Americans. 
The initiatives of President Biden’s Amer-
ican Jobs and American Families Plans enjoy 
the strong support of the American people, in-
cluding Republicans. Democrats are com-
mitted to making them law—so we can Build 
Back Better, with prosperity, opportunity and 
justice for all.

SEC. 2608. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING 
ELECTRIC 
VEHICLE 
TRANSITION 
STRATEGY. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) The transition to a modern electric 
fleet managed by the nation’s transit agen-
cies represents a key opportunity to mod-
ernize and green the public transit fleets. 
(2) The impending fleet transition presents 
difficult workforce challenges for the transit 
agencies and their frontline workers as they 
prepare for the differences in purchasing, 
maintaining, and managing new electric 
buses and the related maintenance systems. 
(3) The maintenance of electric engines re-
quires fewer mechanics than does the main-
tenance of diesel and natural gas engines,

which make up more than 99 percent of bus 
fleets in the United States. 
(4) Although approximately 400,000 people 
work in public transportation, and of that 
figure, 90 percent work in the frontline occu-
pations, because of retirements and a mas-
sive transition in the transit workforce, 
large changes are bound for workers, transit 
agencies, and the communities that the tran-
sit workforce serves. 
(5) Based on the Department of Transpor-
tation and the Department of Labor data 
from 2014, transit systems needed to hire, 
train, and retain approximately 126 percent 
of their workforce over a 10-year period. 
(6) The Department of Transportation, the 
Federal Railroad Administration, and sister 
Federal agencies like the Department of En-
ergy and the Department of Labor can offer 
resources, strategy, and a research and de-
velopment plan to prepare and assist in the 
upcoming transition to electric and clean ve-
hicle systems. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that the transit industry needs an 
integrated, cooperative, and forward-looking 
workforce development strategy in order to 
help frontline workers and the transit agen-
cies prepare for and mitigate the workforce 
disruption challenges posed by the transition 
to electric vehicles and electric buses.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 508, the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. LAMB) 
and the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. 
GRAVES) each will control 10 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. LAMB. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this 
en bloc amendment, which provides for 
the consideration of 42 amendments. 
The amendments contained in this en 
bloc touch upon various policy areas in 
the base bill. 
The surface transportation amend-
ments include: increasing funding for 
the National Scenic Byways Program; 
creating a climate-safe infrastructure 
working group to prepare transpor-
tation infrastructure for the effects of 
climate change; requiring a GAO report 
to Congress on access to nonemergency 
medical transportation for disadvan-
taged populations; requiring the Sec-
retary of Transportation to submit a 
report to Congress on the Disadvan-
taged Business Enterprise Program; 
and ensuring underserved communities 
are considered in the expansion of elec-
tric vehicle charging infrastructure. 
These are just some of the highlights 
of the amendments included. I thank 
my 
colleagues 
for 
offering 
such 
thoughtful amendments to improve the 
surface transportation portions of the 
INVEST in America Act, and I urge 
adoption of the amendment. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. 
GRAVES 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I actually want to re-
peat what the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania just said: This bloc of amend-
ments consists of 42 amendments. 
All you Americans that are at home 
right now, your Member of Congress 
that you elected to come up here to de-
bate, to influence, to fix the crisis we 
have in transportation and traffic right 
now, you get the choice to either sup-
port or oppose 42 different amend-
ments, some of which may be good, 
some of which may be awful. 
This is what democracy looks like 
right now under this Democrat major-
ity, where the individual Members of 
Congress aren’t even allowed to effec-
tively represent their constituents. 
This bill, including this amendment, 
simply adds more money to a bad sys-
tem. 
The 
average 
American, 
Mr. 
Speaker, all they need to do is think 
about that road project, that traffic 
jam, they have in their community. All 
this bill does is puts more money in 
that very system that resulted in those 
problems 
in 
their 
community. 
It 
doesn’t fix it. 
In fact, it even diverts money from 
what should be infrastructure into 
things that have absolutely nothing to 
do with infrastructure, which, just to 
give an example of that, includes art. 
That is where your transportation dol-
lars are going, art infrastructure. 
Mr. Speaker, this amendment is so 
fundamentally flawed, this process is 
so fundamentally flawed, I urge rejec-
tion of this entire bloc. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. LAMB. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Rhode 
Island (Mr. LANGEVIN). 
Mr. 
LANGEVIN. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise in 
support of the INVEST in America Act, 
which will help rebuild America’s in-
frastructure. I especially rise today in 
strong support of my amendment and 
other disability provisions in the IN-
VEST in America Act.

June 30, 2021 
with disabilities still face substantial 
barriers to transportation. The IN-
VEST in America Act includes provi-
sions from the Disability Access to 
Transportation Act, a bill I authored 
to break down barriers in transpor-
tation for people with disabilities. 
These 
provisions, 
among 
other 
things, include establishing a one-stop 
paratransit pilot program so that rid-
ers can schedule an intermediate stop 
during their trips, reauthorizing and 
increasing funding for section 5310 mo-
bility grants, and streamlining the re-
porting process for accessibility com-
plaints. 
The bill will also require the Depart-
ment of Transportation to adopt the 
U.S. Access Board’s proposed ‘‘Public 
Rights-of-Way 
Accessibility 
Guide-
lines’’ as enforceable standards, and 
my amendment will require the De-
partment of Justice to follow suit. 
Mr. Speaker, this amendment and 
the INVEST in America Act will help 
make our Nation more accessible for 
Americans with disabilities. I urge my 
colleagues 
to 
vote 
‘‘yes’’ 
on 
this 
amendment, and I thank the chairman 
for his leadership on this outstanding 
bill. 
Mr. 
GRAVES 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. LAMB. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. JONES). 
Mr. JONES. Mr. Speaker, people in 
suburban communities benefit from 
convenient, reliable public transpor-
tation to urban areas. It allows them 
to move to more affordable neighbor-
hoods while maintaining access to the 
economic opportunities in the city. 
This is evident in part of my district, 
where a one-seat ride on the east side 
of the Hudson River in New York 
makes it easy to get off the roads and 
commute by train between Westchester 
County and New York City. 
Unfortunately, Rockland County, on 
the west side of the Hudson, lacks di-
rect rail service to the city, making 
the commute deeply inconvenient and 
the area a more challenging place to 
live. 
My amendment would commission a 
study on the economic benefits of one- 
seat ride commuter rail service be-
tween urban and suburban commu-
nities. This study would help Federal, 
State, and local governments plan for 
expansion of direct rail service to com-
munities like Rockland County and 
identify areas where improvements are 
not only feasible but necessary. 
I urge support for my amendment be-
cause communities like Rockland de-
serve convenient, reliable public trans-
portation to urban areas like New York 
City. 
Mr. 
GRAVES 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, we have heard people 
talk about how this bill is going to 
help address climate change, and we 
have heard people try to suggest that 
our side doesn’t care about it. The 
facts actually paint a very different 
story. 
My friends on the other side of the 
aisle came in and tried very hard to 
force legislation that would mandate 
reductions in emissions in the power 
sector. That was going to significantly 
drive up energy costs. Thankfully, Con-
gress didn’t enact it. 
But do you know what actually hap-
pened? By letting innovators innovate, 
by Congress not coming in and forcing 
regulatory mandates and forcing and 
choosing different types of energy 
technologies, the United States has re-
duced emissions more than the next 12 
emissions-reducing 
countries 
com-
bined. 
Is it because of Congress’ actions? 
No. It is because Americans are innova-
tive, and Americans innovated their 
way out of this. We have been leading 
the world. 
What this legislation does is it goes 
back, and it fails to learn from the les-
sons of the past. It tries to force tech-
nologies. 
Right now, electric vehicle sales rep-
resent 2 percent of sales. Consumers 
don’t want them. 
In my home State, we drive pickup 
trucks and put our boats behind them. 
But don’t worry, because according to 
Car and Driver, you are going to get to 
pull your boat 100 miles, and then you 
get to stop at a charging station, paid 
for by this bill. You will then get to sit 
there for 45 minutes, potentially get 
your truck up to 80 percent, and you 
can maybe then drive another, I don’t 
know, 70 miles or so. It is going to be 
great. 
This is crazy. This is absolutely 
crazy. Americans need traffic solu-
tions. We need traffic solutions. We had 
325 amendments submitted to this bill 
to try to improve it. Mr. Speaker, 149 
of those were accepted, and 105 of those 
were Democrat amendments, not even 
giving Republican constituents across 
America the opportunity to be able to 
be represented. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge rejection of this 
partisan, failed process that, for the 
first time in decades, has failed to 
yield a bipartisan bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. LAMB. Mr. Speaker, I would just 
note for my colleague’s edification the 
strong role that the Federal Govern-
ment and national lab system played in 
the very energy innovation that he was 
mentioning in his remarks. It was not 
done by the private sector alone. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman 
from 
New 
York 
(Mr. 
TORRES). 
Mr. TORRES of New York. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to speak in favor of my 
amendment to the INVEST Act, which 
clarifies that the capping of highways 
with deck parks shall qualify for fund-
ing under the Reconnecting Neighbor-
hoods Program. 
The South Bronx is the most densely 
populated congressional district with 
the highest concentration of diesel 
truck traffic. In Hunts Point alone, 
there are 15,000 trucks traveling every 
day from and to the Hunts Point Ter-
minal Market. Children living near the 
Cross Bronx Expressway are, through 
no fault of their own, breathing in air 
pollutants that cause respiratory dis-
ease. 
The sheer prevalence of asthma in 
the South Bronx is no accident. It is a 
consequence of the Cross Bronx Ex-
pressway, which stands both literally 
and metaphorically as a structure of 
racism. 
My amendment to the INVEST Act 
would lay the groundwork for capping 
the Cross Bronx Expressway in the 
hopes of preventing diesel truck traffic 
from polluting the air we breathe in 
the Bronx. 
There is no policy or project that 
would do more to fundamentally im-
prove the air quality and life expect-
ancy in the South Bronx than the long- 
overdue transformation of the Cross

Mr. 
GRAVES 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. LAMB. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Massa-
chusetts (Mr. AUCHINCLOSS). 
Mr. AUCHINCLOSS. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today in support of my amendment 
to the INVEST in America Act to en-
sure the future of transportation is 
convenient, affordable, and sustain-
able. 
My amendment would help local gov-
ernments sustainably fund innovative 
public transportation options, includ-
ing on-demand transit. These new tran-
sit services will be required to follow 
FTA rules and to protect the labor 
force that makes public transit pos-
sible. 
Expanding 
mobility-as-a-service— 
like 
bikeshare, 
scooters, 
and 
rideshare—will bring in new transit 
ridership, meaning less traffic and pol-
lution and more walkable, vibrant 
downtowns. 
I am grateful for Chairman DEFAZIO’s 
leadership on this transformational bill 
and the diligent work of his staff. I 
urge my colleagues to support my 
amendment and the underlying bill. 
Mr. 
GRAVES 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I heard my friends talk 
about how it has been innovation that 
has led us to emissions reductions. I 
find it fascinating and certainly look 
forward to that discussion. 
But, Mr. Speaker, right now, just a 
few months ago, the United States was 
entirely energy independent. We pro-
duced all the resources that we needed 
to power our economy and to power our 
transportation sector. 
What this bill does is begins forcing 
everything, manipulating markets in a 
direction that doesn’t work. 
Don’t take my word for it. Let me 
give you examples about the State of

California that has tried to do the very 
thing that this bill does. The State of 
California currently has electricity 
prices that are twice those of my home 
State. 
I ask the American citizens, Mr. 
Speaker, which American is asking to 
have their electricity bills doubled? 
By the way, when you increase de-
mand for electricity, the price goes up 
even higher. When you try to electrify 
the entire vehicle fleet, then prices go 
up. 
Do you think they got a plan for 
this? 
There is a study in this very amend-
ment that tries to study how you are 
going to incorporate vehicles into the 
energy and transportation sector. They 
don’t even know how they are going to 
do it, yet they are charging ahead bold-
ly under this en bloc amendment. 
Another great one in here: During 
the committee process on this, I of-
fered an amendment, Mr. Speaker, to 
establish national centers of resilience. 
I got a commitment from the chairman 
saying: Yes, we are going to work with 
you on this. 
They didn’t work with us. But all of 
a sudden, when we filed our amend-
ment, that one is discarded, and one 
pops up from a Democrat Member with 
our idea. It is now going to be in this 
en bloc for consideration. 
This whole process just doesn’t re-
flect democracy. I can’t say it enough, 
Mr. Speaker: Decades and decades of 
bipartisan support, strong support, rep-
resenting the leadership on how you 
negotiate legislation and bringing traf-
fic solutions and transportation solu-
tions to America. 
In this case, there is no bipartisan 
support. This is a failed effort that 
fails to address the needs of the Amer-
ican public. It diverts funds that need 
to go to traffic solutions to things 
that, quite frankly, are going to play 
into China’s hands and cause the loss 
of jobs. We need to be exporting Amer-
ican innovation, not exporting jobs to 
China, as this bill does. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. LAMB. Mr. Speaker, may I in-
quire as to how much time is remain-
ing. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania has 5 min-
utes remaining. The gentleman from 
Louisiana has 31⁄2 minutes remaining. 
Mr. LAMB. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Wis-
consin (Ms. MOORE). 
Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank the chairmen for their lead-
ership, vision, and work on this bill. 
It must be our priority to ensure 
needed infrastructure investments pro-
mote equity to help address the myriad 
environmental injustices experienced 
by minority, Tribal, and low-income 
communities. 
For this reason, I was happy to join 
forces with the gentleman from Colo-
rado (Mr. CROW) to offer an amendment 
which ensures underserved and dis-
advantaged communities are not left 
behind as we make the electric vehicle 
transition. 
I also want to thank Chairman DEFA-
ZIO for the strong equity-focused in-
vestments in this package, such as the 
new reduced fare for the low-income 
riders demonstration grant program 
and changes to the transit formula to 
require transit agencies to better serve 
transit-dependent populations. 
I am pleased that my amendment to 
this package, which would increase the 
funding set-aside for low- and mod-
erate-income communities under the 
Zero Emission Bus Grant Program, is 
included. 
Finally, providing equitable access to 
electric charging infrastructure and 
substantial public transit funding helps 
build equity into our Nation’s trans-
portation options and will help address 
the climate hazards that must remain 
a priority for this administration and 
Congress. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge the body to sup-
port this bill. 
Mr. 
GRAVES 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. LAMB. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from New 
York (Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ). 
Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to offer six amendments to 
the INVEST in America Act. 
It is imperative that any infrastruc-
ture bill that we work on and is passed 
by Congress helps to achieve two goals: 
one, address the history of injustice 
and displacement that traditional and 
historic infrastructure investment has 
imposed on communities of color and 
working people, like the construction 
of the Cross Bronx Expressway; and the 
second is to prepare for and create 
good, dignified union jobs in building 
the infrastructure that helps mitigate 
climate change. 
One amendment that I am offering 
today would double the funding to re-
place lead water infrastructure in 
schools. In the richest country in the 
world, no child should be poisoned by 
their classroom water fountain, yet 
that is exactly the case for millions of 
American schoolchildren. In New York 
City alone, at least 400 schools, many 
in the Bronx, contained faucets with 
elevated lead levels as recently as 2019. 
I am also offering an amendment 
today with Representative MOULTON to 
increase rail funding by 20 percent. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support and pas-
sage of these amendments. 
Mr. 
GRAVES 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. LAMB. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. MCNERNEY). 
Mr. MCNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of my amendment to 
H.R. 3684, the INVEST in America Act. 
Among other things, this legislation 
aims to increase both the awareness of 
career opportunities in the transpor-
tation sector and to build a more di-
verse workforce in this field. 
My amendment would add veteran 
status as a factor to be considered 
under diversity. 
As of 2017, women represented 16 per-
cent of the overall Active Duty force, 
with 43 percent of Active Duty military 
identified as Black, Hispanic, Asian, or 
another racial or ethnic group. Our in-
creasingly diverse military is not only 
an asset to our Nation’s security, but 
when these servicemembers return to 
civilian life, they are often an un-
tapped pool of potential. 
We have a duty to protect and serve 
those who have done so for us. A key 
part of that is helping our veterans 
find gainful employment once their 
service has ended, which is what my 
amendment would seek to do. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this. 
Mr. 
GRAVES 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. LAMB. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Texas 
(Mrs. FLETCHER). 
Mrs. FLETCHER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to offer an amendment to the IN-
VEST in America Act to provide local 
transit agencies the flexibility to de-
velop large-scale transit improvement 
plans. 
As Congress discusses legislation to 
reimagine and rebuild our country’s in-
frastructure and transit systems, the 
amendment I am offering today pro-
vides additional flexibility, as transit 
agencies group transit improvement 
projects together and allow more than 
one project to be developed and fi-
nanced at a time. 
Specifically, if an agency pays more 
than the required 20 percent of local 
funds to pay for a federally qualified 
project, the extra funds they used on 
that project will be counted as a credit 
on another project. 
This will ensure that local agencies 
are able to maximize both the Federal 
and local funds available to them to 
deliver large-scale regional transit im-
provements. 
As we reimagine and rebuild our 
country’s infrastructure, this is pre-
cisely the type of Federal-local part-
nership that will deliver the highest 
value for our investment as we work to 
build for our future. 
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. LAMB. Madam Speaker, I am 
prepared to close whenever the gen-
tleman from Louisiana is prepared to 
close. I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I am prepared to close, but 
being in opposition, I reserve the right 
to close. 
Mr. LAMB. Madam Speaker, just 
kind of wrapping up everyone’s com-
ments today, I think that this bill is a 
significant down payment on the fu-
ture that we are all working toward. 
The reality of American history is 
that the government often works to-
gether with businesses to stimulate in-
vestments and speed up new markets.

That is what we are trying to do in this 
bill. That has been true in natural gas; 
it has been true in public transpor-
tation; and it is true in electric vehi-
cles. And that is what this bill is 
about. 
We are very proud to offer all of 
these amendments, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, recognizing that I have the 
right to close, I continue to reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. LAMB. Madam Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I would like to start a col-
loquy with the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania, who made a statement about 
how our national labs innovated us 
into this emissions reduction leader-
ship role we play in the United States. 
I ask the gentleman from Pennsyl-
vania to explain to us about those in-
novations and how that contributed to 
emissions reductions. 
I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania (Mr. LAMB) for the 
purpose of a colloquy. 
Mr. LAMB. Madam Speaker, I will 
try to do it in 30 seconds. 
The bulk of our emissions reduction 
has come from the transition from coal 
to natural gas. Most of the critical 
science that is behind the shale revolu-
tion was developed within the national 
lab system, particularly at the Na-
tional Energy Technology Laboratory, 
proudly located in western Pennsyl-
vania. 
Of course, private-sector innovation 
played a huge role, but there were 
many key scientific advances that 
would not have been possible without 
Federal investment paid for by this 
very Congress. 
That is how we are responsible for 
many of the emissions reductions that 
have taken place and that will con-
tinue to take place in the future. 
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, 
reclaiming 
my 
time, 
I 
couldn’t have asked the gentleman to 
make my point any more than he just 
did. 
This bill attempts to force or manip-
ulate markets in a direction that is 
simply not consistent with the re-
sources, the workforce of America. 
The gentleman is exactly right. He is 
exactly right. It is our natural gas rev-
olution that has resulted in the United 
States leading the world in reducing 
emissions. It is not a result of someone 
coming in and forcing people to drive 
electric vehicles. It is not a result of 
forcing people to put solar panels on 
their homes. That is not it. It is the 
transition to natural gas. 
As a matter of fact, the natural gas 
from the gentleman’s home State, ac-
cording to the National Energy Tech-
nology Lab in the gentleman’s home 
State, has a 42 to 47 percent lower 
emissions profile than Russian gas, 
which is effectively what this bill 
forces to happen, more dependence on 
Russian gas. 
A year ago, we imported zero barrels 
of Russian oil—zero—into the United 
States. This month, we are on a trajec-
tory to import 7 million barrels, 7 mil-
lion barrels of oil from Vladimir Putin. 
Thanks. This is crazy. 
This bill just continues building on 
that. I really don’t understand, Madam 
Speaker, what the gentleman is going 
to tell his own constituents when they 
are no longer employed. Folks say: 
Hey, don’t you worry. We are going to 
get new clean energy jobs. 
Madam Speaker, what has happened 
every single time we have developed 
new technology that wasn’t tied back 
to America’s resources? China steals 
the property. They steal the intellec-
tual property. They steal the inven-
tions and sell it back to us at a cheaper 
price—by the way, at the same time, 
causing greater environmental con-
sequences using child enslaved labor. 
Madam Speaker, what I urge is, let’s 
apply cancel culture to the countries 
that my friends across the aisle are ac-
tually promoting right now, to China 
and Russia. 
Let me say this again. This bill at-
tempts to take California’s model and 
apply it nationally, doubling the elec-
tricity prices in my home State. 
Guess which State had the eighth 
worst emissions growth in America? Is 
it the State that carried all this out? 
No. It is California. Guess which State 
is the most dependent State on foreign 
energy? It is California. 
I can’t say it enough. We need to be 
exporting our innovation, not export-
ing our jobs. This is a flawed bill. It is 
an entirely flawed strategy that is 
being forced on American citizens 
under this legislation. People have the 
option right now to buy electric vehi-
cles, and they are not doing it. It is 0.6 
percent of the vehicles today. 
Madam Speaker, I urge rejection of 
this amendment. I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
these amendments en bloc, which pro-
vide for the consideration of 21 amend-

And 
prohibiting

cals. 
I look forward to hearing further dis-
cussion of these amendments from the 
various sponsors. I thank my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle for of-
fering these amendments to improve 
the INVEST in America Act, and I urge 
adoption of the amendment. I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, traditionally what 
would happen in an amendment group-
ing like this is that Republicans and 
Democrats would sit down and decide 
which group of amendments everybody 
agrees on. There are actually some 
really good amendments that are in-
cluded in this en bloc, some of which 
address some fundamental problems in 
our transportation system. 
For example, there is an amendment 
in here by Congresswoman MACE. What 
that amendment does is after much re-
search, the Department of Transpor-
tation couldn’t even tell us how much 
money is being invested in roads and 
bridges. Couldn’t even answer the ques-
tion. Congressional Research Service 
couldn’t. Government Accountability 
Office couldn’t. We have tried for 
months to get an answer. 
So this commission is a study to look 
at that, to give us feedback to under-
stand where the dollars are going to 
help inform us on how to do a better 
job governing. 
There is an amendment here that I 
want to say thanks to my friends 
across the aisle for that has to do with 
the resilience of materials of roads. 
And again, there are good amend-
ments, but, Madam Speaker, this is 
how the process is supposed to work. 
We are supposed to sit down and try to 
come to common ground and decide 
which amendments make sense and we 
all agree on and help to expedite this 
entire process to go from 325 amend-
ments, hopefully, to a much shorter 
number, not by having unilateral con-
trol and someone unilaterally deciding 
they are going to let these amend-
ments go and these not and design a 
group of amendments to intentionally 
fail, despite the fact that there is good 
policy. 
So I will say it again, I think there 
are some good amendments in here. I 
look forward to hearing from my col-
leagues about their particular amend-
ments and why they are good policy, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LAMB. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Wash-
ington (Mr. KILMER). 
Mr. KILMER. Madam Speaker, peo-
ple in the Pacific Northwest have faced 
horrific news this week regarding po-
tential catastrophic die-off of salmon 
populations resulting from rising water 
temperatures 
from 
this 
week’s 
heatwave. 
Sadly, in our region, deteriorating 
infrastructure and failing culverts have 
long had a negative impact on water 
quality and have threatened the salm-
on that are so important to our econ-
omy and to our identity. 
But today, through this bipartisan 
amendment, we have some good news. 
This amendment would create a new 
grant program within the U.S. Depart-
ment of Transportation for culvert res-
toration to aid fish passage and recov-
ery efforts. 
It provides $800 million for the new 
National Culvert Removal, Replace-
ment and Restoration Grant Program. 
By providing this dedicated funding 
for culvert restoration, the Federal 
Government can restore fish passages 
and provide critical access to upstream 
habitat for aquatic species. 
I am grateful for Senator CANTWELL’s 
partnership and that of Chair DEFAZIO 
and for the support of bipartisan Mem-
bers from the Pacific Northwest, who 
know how important this effort is to 
protecting clean water and recovering 
salmon populations in our region. 
This is good news, and I encourage 
my colleagues to support this amend-
ment. 
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
MEUSER). 
Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Mr. GRAVES for yielding and for 
so strongly and well leading this im-
portant debate. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
my amendment, the roads to revital-
ization amendment, which would in-
crease the Federal share for infrastruc-
ture projects in areas of persistent pov-
erty from 80 percent to 85 percent. Lev-
elling up the Federal contribution to 
these projects could reduce the burden 
on local governments, enabling long 
overdue projects to proceed sooner. 
Many low-income communities have 
infrastructure needs that have been de-
ferred for far too long, imperiling pub-
lic 
safety 
and 
compounding 
the 
project’s costs. My amendment reduces 
the burden on State and local govern-
ments to drive infrastructure invest-
ments in distressed areas, paving the 
way for broader economic development 
and revitalization of countless great 
American neighborhoods. 
Infrastructure investment, as we all 
know, can be a game changer for many 
of the communities I represent, as we 
all do. This simple policy change will 
help 
these 
communities, 
Madam 
Speaker, make the up-front investment 
they need to revitalize Main Street, at-
tract private-sector investment, and 
become even better places to live and 
to work. 
Mr. LAMB. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute 
to 
the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Washington (Ms. SCHRIER). 
Ms. SCHRIER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Mr. LAMB for yielding. 
I am incredibly excited to have three 
local projects included in the INVEST 
in America Act. I worked with mayors, 
county commissioners, and community 
members across my district to identify 
priorities and advocate for Federal in-
vestment. These projects will improve 
the safety and resiliency of infrastruc-
ture in our communities, create jobs, 
and boost local economies. 
Now, I would like to ask my col-
leagues to support my amendment to 
codify the Forest Service’s Legacy 
Roads and Trails Program. This pro-
gram leverages public and private 
funding to address our national back-
log of deteriorating infrastructure, and 
does so while protecting American riv-
ers and streams, endangered fish, and 
community water systems with tar-
geted projects, like restoring fish pas-
sage and access to upstream habitat for 
salmon and steelhead, maintaining and 
storm-proofing forest roads, and im-
proving trails so people can safely 
recreate in our public lands. 
Chronic underfunding has left a long 
backlog of projects, and I am proud to 
present this solution. As we face the 
increasing threat of climate change 
and the need to improve our Nation’s 
crumbling infrastructure, we must en-
sure pragmatic programs like legacy 
roads are also protected. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
amendment. 
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Indiana (Mr. PENCE), a 
leading member of the Transportation 
and Infrastructure Committee. 
Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, I am 
going to get straight to the point since 
infrastructure is fundamental to a Hoo-
sier’s way of life back home in Indiana 
and across America. 
I rise today in support of my amend-
ment to codify the Rural Opportunities 
to Use Transportation for Economic 
Success, or the ROUTES initiative. 
The ROUTES initiative, first intro-
duced in 2019, works to ensure that 
rural communities like mine get their 
fair share of federal funding for infra-
structure. 
This 
amendment 
would 
provide 
much-needed technical assistance for

local 
municipalities, 
strengthening 
their ability to be competitive in ap-
plying for Federal funds. 
Indiana is the ‘‘Crossroads of Amer-
ica.’’ We see billions in commerce come 
through our State via airports, high-
ways, and railways. 
My home State, and countless other 
parts of the country are just as depend-
ent on reliable, safe, and updated infra-
structure. 
That is why in April I introduced this 
bipartisan legislation with my col-
league 
from 
Texas, 
Congressman 
HENRY CUELLAR. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I yield the gentleman an addi-
tional 30 seconds. 
Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, in 
short, this means rural America will 
have the ability to improve critical in-
frastructure that will drive economic 
competitiveness and improve safety. 
Madam Speaker, I am thankful this 
issue has remained a bipartisan pri-
ority, and I urge my colleagues to sup-
port this amendment so Congress can 
continue to recognize the infrastruc-
ture needs of our rural communities 
across America. 
Mr. LAMB. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Lou-
isiana (Mr. CARTER). 
Mr. CARTER of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to offer a bipar-
tisan, commonsense amendment. 
This amendment will protect Amer-
ica’s equines from being moved across 
State lines then exported to Canada 
and Mexico to be butchered for human 
consumption. 
Horses aren’t bred for food, and 
Americans don’t want them bought 
under false pretenses, forced into over-
crowded trailers, tormented on a thou-
sand-mile journey and then prodded to 
slaughterhouses. 
However, a legal loophole still allows 
tens of thousands of American equines 
to be exported each year to Canada and 
Mexico for slaughter. 
This is a heinous practice, and Con-
gress should take every step and 
chance we have to end it for good. 
I thank the chairman and all of my 
colleagues for working with me to 
make this amendment possible. I thank 
the amazing advocates who work to 
protect horses, equines, and all animals 
day in and day out, year in and year 
out. This amendment wouldn’t be on 
the floor today without their support. I 
tip my hat to them. This is a huge 
amendment that is bipartisan. 
b 1930 
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
FITZPATRICK), one of the hardest work-
ing members on the Committee on 
Transportation and Infrastructure. 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today in support of amendment 
No. 15. 
This important bipartisan amend-
ment 
bans 
the 
transportation 
of 
equines for the purpose of being slaugh-
tered for human consumption. 
Madam Speaker, currently, horses, 
donkeys, and others can be transported 
inhumanely across our country and 
borders only to be slaughtered for 
human consumption in Mexico and in 
Canada. 
Moreover, this heinous practice is re-
sponsible for over 3,500 horses being 
slaughtered in 2020 alone. These horses 
are not old or sickly. More than 92 per-
cent of these horses sent to slaughter 
are in good condition, according to the 
USDA. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
these 
innocent 
horses deserve better, and we must 
lend a voice to the voiceless to help end 
the practice of American horses being 
needlessly slaughtered. This amend-
ment has the overwhelming support of 
the equestrian community, including 
the Humane Society, the SPCA, and 
Horses for Homes Coalition. 
I thank Representative CARTER for 
leading this amendment, along with 
the other bipartisan cosponsors of this 
amendment, and I urge all my col-
leagues across the aisle to support it 
and vote ‘‘yes’’ on this bipartisan en 
bloc. 
Mr. LAMB. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Georgia 
(Mr. JOHNSON). 
Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise to support the INVEST 
in America Act, which is landmark leg-
islation that provides critical funding 
to repair our crumbling infrastructure, 
makes long-overdue investments in 
public transit, and improves overall 
safety. 
Together, the reforms respond to the 
climate crisis by reducing emissions 
from transportation, which represents 
the largest share of greenhouse gas 
emissions in our economy. This bill in-
cludes several provisions that I au-
thored, including a boost to disadvan-
taged business enterprises, a require-
ment that trucks be equipped with life-
saving, automatic emergency braking 
systems, and critical funding for public 
transit. 
The bill would also fund five projects 
in my district to expand or add public 
transit service and improve rider safe-
ty, including the Stonecrest Transit 
Hub. 
Moving forward, I am hopeful that a 
final law will include a dedicated pub-
lic transit operating program, such as 
the one that I have proposed, to grow 
and improve service around the Nation. 
Madam Speaker, I applaud the chair-
man for his leadership. 
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. LAMB. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Oregon 
(Mr. BLUMENAUER). 
Mr. 
BLUMENAUER. 
I 
appreciate 
your forthright support for a legisla-
tion that deals with the future. The 
gentleman from Louisiana State is a 
textbook example of what happens 
when we are not dealing meaningfully, 
when, for example, allowing the petrol 
chemical industry free rein. That is 
why they are losing an acre an hour, 
putting them at risk. This legislation 
is visionary in terms of providing the 
tools that communities need. 
I visited over 200 communities since I 
have been in Congress dealing with 
land use, transportation, cycling, how 
we deal with land use planning in 
terms of design. This legislation super-
charges that, gives them the tools that 
communities want. 
Madam Speaker, Republicans for 8 
years refused to move forward in a 
meaningful way; paralyzed, not willing 
to make a tough decision. I salute the 
committee. I salute you and these 
package of amendments because this 
prepares us for the future. 
I bring you greetings from a commu-
nity that had 116-degree temperature 
in June. This is the future if we don’t 
move forward. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. LAMB. Madam Speaker, I yield 
an additional 30 seconds to the gen-
tleman from Oregon. 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, 
that is the future you are all going to 
be experiencing. It is not just losing an 
acre an hour in Louisiana, it is baking 
in the Pacific Northwest, where people 
didn’t even think they needed air-con-
ditioning. 
We have an opportunity to make 
those investments. I think the com-
mittee has done an outstanding job. 
And if you spend time on the ground 
with local government, with the pri-
vate sector who want to solve these 
problems, we will find that this is very 
much in keeping with what America 
wants and America needs. 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate their 
leadership and hard work. 
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. BRADY), the 
leader of the Committee on Ways and 
Means. 
Mr. 
BRADY. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank Ranking Member GRAVES for his 
leadership trying to find a bipartisan 
framework on our Nation’s infrastruc-
ture priorities. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
speak in support of my amendment 
that would add crucial taxpayer safe-
guards to the Railroad Rehabilitation 
and Improvement Financing. 
With this amendment, 67 percent of 
total funding for projects would be re-
quired to come from sources other than 
the Federal Government. This ensures 
Federal 
funds 
are 
going 
towards 
projects with sound financials that 
partner with other public or private en-
tities. 
My amendment would require bor-
rowers to document a revenue stream 
with the sole objective of paying off 
the loan. If the Federal Government is 
going to lend money to a project, we 
have to make sure they have a plan to 
pay it back. And this provision does 
just that.

Another provision would require the 
Federal loan be repaid, along with pri-
mary debt, if the loan defaults. This re-
quirement 
protects 
taxpayers 
from 
bearing the brunt of costs from bank-
rupt projects. 
In my district, constituents are see-
ing 
firsthand 
how 
high-speed 
rail 
projects with uncertain financing and 
lacking necessary permits in place, are 
looking to the RRIF program for fund-
ing. Even though Texas Central Rail-
road vowed for years to not seek Fed-
eral funding for the high-speed rail 
projects, just last year they lobbied 
Congress to loosen the RRIF lending 
requirements even further. 
This amendment protects Federal 
taxpayers not only in my district, but 
across America, to make sure our con-
stituents aren’t stuck holding the bag 
when rail projects default on their 
loan. 
Madam Speaker, I urge bipartisan 
support. 
Mr. LAMB. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from North 
Carolina (Mr. BUTTERFIELD). 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Madam Speak-
er, I thank the gentleman for yielding 
to me. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of H.R. 3684, the INVEST in Amer-
ica Act. 
This legislation invests in commu-
nities like mine all across the country 
that are in desperate need of infra-
structure improvements. 
Madam Speaker, this past weekend, I 
took the train back to Washington, 
D.C., from my hometown of Wilson, 
North Carolina. As I waited to board 
the train, I noticed significant deterio-
ration to facilities of the station, in-
cluding the platform and the canopy. 
Like many train stations across Amer-
ica, the Wilson Station is in dire need 
of repair and renovation. The INVEST 
in America Act, among other things, 
provides 
funding 
to 
address 
these 
issues. 
I thank Chairman DEFAZIO for in-
cluding over $57 billion in grant fund-
ing to help repair and modernize our 
aging train facilities. I also thank the 
chairman for the inclusion of five 
transformative infrastructure projects 
across my district. 
Madam Speaker, this momentous bill 
delivers on a promise that we made to 
the American people. Let’s build back 
better. 
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I have the right to close so I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LAMB. Madam Speaker, I am 
prepared to close, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I believe we have the right to 
close, so I am going to reserve. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the 
gentleman opposed to the amendment? 
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. I am op-
posed to the amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania is recog-
nized. 
Mr. LAMB. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. I sim-
ply rise again to encourage my col-
leagues to support amendments en bloc 
No. 2, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, as I mentioned, there are a 
number of amendments in here that I 
fully support. This whole process is a 
flawed process. 
I have heard the gentleman from Or-
egon (Mr. BLUMENAUER) bring up the 
coastal Louisiana and the loss of land. 
The ranking member of the committee 
talked about the loss in coastal Lou-
isiana, and it is extraordinary. 
We have lost 2,000 square miles of our 
coast. It is like taking the State of 
Rhode Island and wiping it off the map, 
which is why I care so much about this 
issue; and it is why I care that we actu-
ally provide solutions, not rhetoric. 
And let me explain. 
Madam Speaker, the dirty little se-
cret that my friends across the aisle 
will tell you is that the highly cele-
brated Paris accords that they are all 
out there advocating for and saying 
this bill is going to advance this Green 
New Deal and Paris accord commit-
ments, the Paris accord results in an 
increase 
in 
global 
emissions. 
that 
doesn’t fix what is going on in my 
home State. It doesn’t do anything. It 
makes it worse. 
As a matter of fact, in negotiations, 
Secretary 
Kerry 
conducted—allows 
China to increase emissions another 50 
percent between now and 2030. China 
today emits more than every developed 
country combined. 
So these are the people who we are 
being asked to trust what happens to 
the people that I represent in coastal 
Louisiana? 
Absolutely not. 
Let me say it again. It is as a result 
of what we have done, as a result of 
what innovators have done that have 
resulted in the greatest reduction in 
emissions in world history. And don’t 
take my word for it. That is a quote 
from the IEA’s executive director— 
International Energy Agency’s execu-
tive director. 
Madam Speaker, these are flawed 
strategies. It is proven. 
Who has cornered the market on rare 
earth and strategic minerals? 
China has. 
So who is going to be responsible for 
manufacturing the batteries? 
China. 
Who has made 80 percent of the glob-
al investment in battery technology 
and in manufacturing? 
China. 
Madam Speaker, I represent people 
from America, and that is who I am 
going to fight for. That is who I am 
going to defend. I am going to defend 
our land and prevent it from eroding 
and disappearing because of flawed 
policies. I am going to defend their tax 
dollars to prevent them being wasted 
on things that clearly play into China’s 
hands. 
Madam Speaker, I can’t say this 
enough. I want to export American in-
novation or ingenuity, not our jobs, 
not our economy. This bill is fun-
damentally flawed. And representing 
the greatest loss of coastal wetlands in 
the United States, I won’t stand for 
this type of behavior that squanders 
dollars and actually exacerbates the 
problem of coastal land lost and sus-
tainability, and ecological productivity 
in my home State. 
Madam Speaker, I urge that we stop 
this; that we start this bill over again; 
and as we have done for decades, that 
we come together in a bipartisan proc-
ess, just like I know my friend from Or-
egon would be saying right now if roles 
were reversed. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 504, the pre-
vious 
question 
is 
ordered 
on 
the 
amendments en bloc printed in House 
Report 117–75, offered by the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania (Mr. LAMB). 
The question is on the amendments 
en bloc. 
The en bloc amendments were agreed 
to. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3541 
June 30, 2021 
300j–19e) is amended by striking ‘‘and 2020’’ 
and inserting ‘‘through 2026’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 508, the gen-
tleman from Oregon (Mr. DEFAZIO) and 
the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. 
CRAWFORD) each will control 10 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Oregon. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition 
to the amendments en bloc, which pro-
vides for the consideration of 19 amend-
ments. 
The amendments contained in this en 
bloc amend various provisions of the 
bill. They would strike some of the 
highest priorities in a bill. We just 
heard an impassioned speech from the 
gentleman from Louisiana, talking 
about Louisiana sea-level rise, sinking, 
and all that, and wanting to take on 
China and the world economy. 
Well, guess what? 
They are building the future. That is 
EVs and AVs. And they want to strike 
all of the provisions in the bill that 
will provide for electric charging. 
So Fred Smith, no liberal Democrat 
going all electric with FedEx. GM, 
going all electric. Four truck manufac-
turers making 80,000-pound capable 
tractors. 
No 
charging 
stations 
in 
America. 
Oh, that is not supposed to be the fu-
ture? 
That is the future. That is the future. 
And we also—yeah, we deal with cli-
mate change. And I know you don’t be-
lieve in climate change on that side of 
the aisle. That is fine. I wish you lived 
up where I do. You might just get a 
sample of what the future is like. 
Now, this strikes the Fix-It-First re-
quirements that prioritize state of 
good repair. 
Oh, great. Let’s go lay down more 
lane miles; 35,000 lane miles, the hun-
dred largest cities in America in the 
last 25 years, and congestion is six 
times worse. It is called induced de-
mand. Don’t provide transit alter-
natives. They kill transit. They kill 
rail. We are just going to build more 
highways. We are going to pave over 
the entire city. 
How much of it are you going to 
knock down? 
b 1945 
It is not going to work. It didn’t 
work. It hasn’t been working. So it is 
time to do something different. 
It is time to fix what we have, the Ei-
senhower legacy, 47,000 bridges in the 
National Highway System in desperate 
need of repair or replacement, tens of 
thousands in rural areas and counties, 
new programs in this bill to deal with 
those rural areas and counties. 
They take out the $4 billion Clean 
Corridors program, as I said, for EV 
charging and hydrogen fueling. 
Madam Speaker, $8.3 billion for car-
bon pollution—they don’t believe in 
carbon pollution because the parts of 
the fossil fuel industry that are en-
lightened are big contributors, and 
Donald Trump says we can’t believe in 
climate change. So, okay, got to take 
that out. 
It prohibits any expenditures out of 
the highway trust fund, except for road 
and bridge construction. That means 
no safety. 
We are having record numbers of pe-
destrian and cycling deaths, and this 
bill is going to make it safer for people 
to use alternative modes in urban, sub-
urban, and rural areas. 
I am building a bike lane on a high-
way in a rural area that is heavily traf-
ficked by bikers to a winery in my dis-
trict where there have been fatalities. 
But, no, none of that. None of that in 
the bill. We don’t care about the pedes-
trian deaths. We don’t care about the 
cycling deaths. We don’t care about 
safety. None of that. None of that is in 
their proposal. 
They say we are not doing enough on 
highways. We are doing more than $20 
billion more than they are on highways 
and bridges. But, oh, we are ignoring 
the problem. No, we are not. 
They eliminate the Capital Invest-
ment Grant Program in its entirety. 
They allow the transfer of rural and 
small urban transit funding to high-
ways. I represent a very, very large dis-
trict, bigger than a number of your 
States, and I have a lot of rural areas 
and small cities, and they want to have 
some options for transit. You would 
eliminate that. Okay. 
It eliminates rail funding: no Am-
trak, no passenger rail. 
Highways are funded at a lower level 
than we do, and that is going to take 
care of the problem. That is kind of 
laughable. 
These are just some of the really bad 
ideas in this amendment. This is not 
the path to the future, not the path to 
the 21st century. It is the path of the 
failed policies of the late 20th century 
that don’t work anymore. 
We also need to hold States account-
able. I know some States don’t like 
that. They don’t want to be held ac-
countable. They don’t want to fix it 
first. They don’t want to be held ac-
countable for fossil fuel pollution. If 
you don’t believe in climate change, 
you don’t care: What is the problem 
with fossil fuel pollution? 
So this is ‘‘Groundhog Day’’ on their 
side of the aisle. Let’s bring back the 
failed policies of the 1990s and the early 
2000s. Yes, they were bipartisan, but 
they didn’t deal with 21st century prob-
lems. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. CRAWFORD. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, there is a lot to un-
pack in that statement right there. Let 
me start with section 1201 of H.R. 3684, 
which basically requires States to 
prioritize the state of good repair for 
their roads over constructing new ca-
pacity. 
Well, it is almost impossible to 
achieve a state of good repair when 
new capacity is necessary to achieve 
that state of good repair. You are tell-
ing States they can’t do that, exer-
cising more Federal control over the 
States. 
It would greatly limit the State’s ju-
risdiction over their own roads. Each 
State has unique transportation sys-
tems with needs that vary greatly, and 
their decisions to expand highway ca-
pacity should be made by them and not 
in a vacuum, certainly not here in 
Washington, D.C. DOTs must consider 
everything, from balancing loan serv-
ice to asset management. 
Section 1201 is an attempt by the 
Federal Government to identify the 
needs of States for them and direct 
their policies rather than promoting 
State flexibility. This section would 
limit the scope of good-paying con-
struction projects and jobs for our con-
stituents. It disproportionately affects 
rural and suburban communities, mind 
you, where new capacity is often need-
ed far more than repairs. 
As I mentioned before, Washington 
cannot and should not try to dictate 
every need of the road systems State 
by State when the individuals who un-
derstand those roads are the best ones 
to make that decision. They are the 
ones who are driving on them every 
single day. 
Instead, Congress should focus our ef-
forts on empowering States to build 
the transportation systems their com-
munities need rather than create more 
bureaucratic hurdles. 
It is interesting to note the com-
ments about electric vehicles in China. 
I don’t think we should emulate China 
in any way, shape, or form, number 
one. Number two, I am curious to note 
how those electric vehicles are pow-
ered: by coal-fired power plants. Then, 
we have the conversation about the 
Paris climate accord and who is emit-
ting the most carbon. 
I don’t know how you expect to 
power all these electric vehicles just by 
plugging into the wall. Power has to 
come from somewhere. You are against 
nuclear. We are shuttering coal-fired 
plants. I would ask for some sugges-
tions on that, but I don’t see any real-
istic ones coming from the other side. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE). 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in opposition to the en bloc No. 3 
Republican amendments. 
Some of my colleagues on the Energy 
and Commerce Committee on the Re-
publican side earlier said that this 
water bill was not necessary, and I 
strongly disagree. A lot needs to be 
done to ensure the safety of our drink-
ing water. We saw what happened in 
Flint. In my State, we saw serious lead 
contamination in Newark. 
This bill would provide new resources 
to address lead and PFAS in drinking

water, including $45 billion for lead 
service line replacement. But the Rod-
gers amendment in this bloc would 
strip these resources out. And, unfortu-
nately, the Hudson amendment would 
direct the PFAS resources in the bill 
toward just one set of PFAS chemicals, 
undermining access to those resources 
for communities in need. 
The underlying bill would provide in-
creased funds for resiliency, to help 
water systems plan for and adapt to 
climate 
change. 
But 
the 
Rodgers 
amendment would strip out those in-
creases. 
The underlying bill provides for dead-
lines for the EPA to set health-protec-
tive standards for PFAS, 1,4-dioxane, 
and microcystin toxin, which are long 
overdue. But the Rodgers amendment 
would strip out those deadlines. 
The underlying bill also makes tar-
geted changes to improve the standard- 
setting process and empower EPA to 
set standards as needed. The current 
standard-setting process has been an 
utter failure. EPA has not been able to 
complete that process for a single 
drinking water standard in the 25 years 
it has been in place. That should be un-
acceptable to all of us. But the Rodgers 
and McKinley amendments would strip 
out the changes this bill makes on 
standard-setting. 
Instead of working with us to im-
prove the standard-setting process, my 
Republican colleagues seem intent on 
preserving the status quo, despite so 
much evidence that this is simply not 
enough. 
Let me turn briefly to the afford-
ability provisions of this bill. This bill 
authorizes significant new funding to 
reduce or eliminate customer water 
debt, recognizing that water debt has 
become a crisis in this country. Impor-
tantly, water systems taking these 
funds will agree not to shut off cus-
tomer water access for nonpayment for 
a 5-year period, offering families peace 
of mind as we all recover from the pan-
demic. 
But 
Representative 
CURTIS’ 
amendment would strip out that shut-
off moratorium and make it harder for 
EPA to get this assistance out the 
door. 
Last but not least, the drinking 
water provisions of this bill will estab-
lish permanent rate assistance pro-
grams for drinking water and waste-
water service to help families pay their 
bills and avoid a repeat of our current 
debt crisis. These programs have broad 
support from all kinds of stakeholders. 
Safe drinking water is a fundamental 
human right, and the drinking water 
provisions we have included in the IN-
VEST in America Act include signifi-
cant and meaningful investments and 
reforms to help guarantee that right. 
The Republican amendments in this 
bloc would undermine each of these im-
provements, leaving nothing but the 
status quo. 
It is no longer enough to keep push-
ing the status quo. We have urgent 
public health and infrastructure needs 
that require that we build back better, 
as the President says. The INVEST in 
America Act takes significant steps to-
ward repairing our water infrastruc-
ture, creating jobs, and protecting pub-
lic health. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on these harmful 
amendments and pass the underlying 
bill to affirm that safe drinking water 
is a fundamental human right. 
Mr. CRAWFORD. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Ohio (Mr. GIBBS). 
Mr. GIBBS. Madam Speaker, for 6 
years, a bipartisan agreement in the 
last surface transportation reauthor-
ization prohibited transit funds going 
to nontransportation, art-related as-
pects 
in 
federally 
funded 
transit 
projects. The majority’s bill ends that 
bipartisan agreement and allows for 
the diversion of transportation infra-
structure funding to ancillary and un-
necessary art projects. My amendment 
would keep this prohibition in place so 
that 
transportation 
infrastructure 
funding goes to actual infrastructure 
projects. 
Both 
Republicans 
and 
Democrats 
agree there is a real need for invest-
ments 
in 
critical 
infrastructure, 
though the majority is attempting to 
expand the definition of infrastructure 
to include virtually anything. 
Rerouting these investments to un-
necessary art projects or to pay for art-
ists on the project design team is a 
misuse of taxpayer dollars. We need to 
focus on repairs for roads and bridges, 
not feel-good frescoes and metro sta-
tion murals. 
The amendment will allow excess 
transit funding to be directed toward 
improving our highway systems. 
My colleague from the Transpor-
tation and Infrastructure Committee 
today suggested that if the Soviet 
Union could have artwork as part of 
their 
infrastructure 
projects, 
the 
United States can as well. I am not 
sure we should be taking infrastructure 
advice from the bankrupt nation that 
gave us the Chernobyl incident. And 
the comparison to the Soviet Union is 
unintentionally appropriate: This bill 
is bloated with socialist policies. 
Simply put, this amendment makes 
sure that infrastructure funds are used 
to fund actual infrastructure. A vote 
against this amendment codifies art as 
infrastructure. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this amendment to 
prohibit Federal funding for unneces-
sary art projects. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, may 
I inquire as to the balance of time on 
each side. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Arkansas has 61⁄2 minutes. 
The gentleman from Oregon has 21⁄2 
minutes. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2
minutes to the gentleman 
from Oregon (Mr. BLUMENAUER). 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, 
I appreciate the gentleman’s courtesy 
in permitting me to speak against the 
Republican 
approach 
with 
these 
amendments. 
It is a different world that we are op-
erating in, in terms of climate change, 
in terms of the facts. I bring you greet-
ings from a community that suffered a 
116-degree temperature in June. 
But I guess we can understand their 
being confused. These are the same 
people who thought the rioters that at-
tacked the Capitol were a group of 
peaceful tourists. They are in an alter-
native universe. 
Who are the groups and organizations 
that support this approach? Not the en-
gineers, not the truckers, not local 
government, not State government, 
not 
environmentalists, 
not 
the 
bicyclists. 
There is a wide array of interest 
groups that understand that this is the 
future. This is an opportunity for us to 
actually compete with China. 
I was there 12 years ago and watched 
them weaponize our research, leaping 
ahead in solar, wind, and electric vehi-
cles. That is the future that China has 
unless we reclaim it. 
This visionary legislation, offered by 
the gentleman from Oregon and his 
committee, helps us get back in the 
game. It is one that we can’t afford to 
lose. This approach will do it, and I ap-
plaud him for his leadership in allow-
ing us to move forward. 
Mr. CRAWFORD. Madam Speaker, 
the gentleman’s comments were dan-
gerously close to what I would consider 
disparaging, and I would bring that to 
your attention. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. 
PERRY). 
Mr. 
PERRY. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman from Arkansas. 
This en bloc includes my amend-
ments to strike the EV funding pro-
gram. Do you know why? Because the 
EV funding program pays the Com-
munist Party of China. That is who it 
pays. You don’t have to believe me. 
You can just listen to the chairman. He 
said it in his remarks, right? That is 
the future, and China is building it. 
That is where your money is going. 
My amendment also prohibits loans 
to high-speed rail projects that fail to 
meet the FRA safety standards, our 
safety standards. We just ask that they 
meet them. But since they don’t, we 
shouldn’t be building them. 
It strikes the carbon reduction pro-
gram. Why? Because that, again, pays 
the Communist Party of China. It pro-
hibits Amtrak from expanding their 
network because they can’t afford the 
network they have now. You don’t be-
lieve me? Talk to Mr. BUTTERFIELD. He 
just talked about it. 
It strikes the Capital Investment 
Grant program because all of America 
shouldn’t pay for a couple of pet 
projects in somebody’s location. 
It strikes the section restricting the 
right of States to set their speed limits 
because, I don’t know, I think there 
should be a different speed limit in 
Center City Philadelphia than one in 
Nebraska or across Wyoming.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3543 
June 30, 2021 
b 2000 
Now, Madam Speaker, I am grateful 
to have some amendments finally 
heard here, but this system is broken. 
The Speaker and the majority have 
chosen a closed process that restricts 
debate. 
Why have they done it? 
Because they are scared to death of 
the radical green left. That is what we 
are doing here is supporting the Green 
New Deal and Communist China. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PAYNE), who is the 
Chair of the Railroads, Pipelines, and 
Hazardous Materials Subcommittee. 
Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, to the 
gentleman on the right, I would like to 
use a great quote from somebody who 
all of you loved over there: ‘‘There you 
go again.’’ 
Madam Speaker, as the chairman of 
the Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipe-
lines, and Hazardous Materials, I rise 
today in opposition to the amendments 
offered en bloc, including the one of-
fered by Mr. PERRY that would prohibit 
expansion of Amtrak service. 
I strongly oppose the prohibition 
which would prevent Amtrak from ex-
panding their network across the coun-
try. Allowing Amtrak to expand the 
national network will connect commu-
nities that have previously been iso-
lated and create new economic oppor-
tunities. It is vital that we add new 
service to underserved cities and not 
just maintain the status quo. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to oppose the amendments of-
fered en bloc. 
Mr. CRAWFORD. Madam Speaker, 
before I yield to my distinguished col-
league from North Carolina (Mr. BUDD), 
it is my understanding that we are to 
address our comments to the Chair and 
not to each other. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes 
to the gentleman from North Carolina 
(Mr. BUDD). 
Mr. BUDD. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my colleague from Arkansas for yield-
ing. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
my 
amendment 
would re-implement a Federal Transit 
Administration policy that ensured 
that Federal loans were not counted 
towards State contributions for capital 
investment projects. 
This is particularly important as the 
FTA considers the Gateway project be-
tween New York and New Jersey. Sec-
retary 
Buttigieg 
recently 
made 
a 
verbal commitment to approve this 
project, but he has yet to provide any 
details on the Federal share. If it mir-
rors the Obama administration’s plans, 
Federal taxpayers would be footing 
half of the bill for this project while 
New York and New Jersey would cover 
the rest. But the States are planning to 
cover most of their local share with 
billions in Federal loans. 
In essence, New York and New Jersey 
are demanding that taxpayers in my 
State of North Carolina pay for their 
project. 
My amendment makes sure that driv-
ers in North Carolina are not overly 
subsidizing potentially wasteful transit 
projects in New York, L.A., San Fran-
cisco, or Chicago. 
Mr. CRAWFORD. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. VAN DUYNE.) 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in support of this en bloc amendment. 
The American people overwhelm-
ingly have been telling us that Con-
gress must pass an infrastructure bill 
which focuses on true infrastructure 
and not superficial projects perpet-
uating frivolous spending. We have 
crumbling roads and bridges on the 
verge of collapse across the country, 
and my Democrat colleagues with a 
straight face are prioritizing road art 
over actual roads. 
This amendment would maintain the 
current probation on defining infra-
structure as art. It is, once again, clear 
where the priority of the majority is, 
and it is not on transportation, roads, 
and bridges. 
The fact that we even have to have 
this debate on this amendment shows 
how out of touch some of my col-
leagues are. The INVEST in America 
Act does little to streamline permit-
ting and get relative costs in order. 
In California 40 percent of the cost of 
building a new home is related to gov-
ernment fees. In Texas it is 20 percent. 
Mr. Speaker, you can expect similar 
costs when it comes to other infra-
structure projects. 
My amendment included in the en 
bloc ensures States, such as California, 
can choose if they want to have exuber-
ant costs—just not at the cost of the 
Federal Government. 
Mr. Speaker, this amendment would 
encourage States to right size their 
permit costs and not award high-per-
mit-cost States with a Federal bailout, 
and I urge adoption. 
Mr. CRAWFORD. Mr. Speaker, may I 
inquire as to how much time is remain-
ing. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
MRVAN). The gentleman from Arkansas 
has 3 minutes remaining. 
Mr. CRAWFORD. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to urge a vote 
against this en bloc. This en bloc con-
tains 8 percent of the total amend-
ments that Republicans were allowed 
to offer in this process. 
To me it is amazing that this bill 
prioritizes things like artwork in rail 
terminals. I heard the chairman say 
earlier that, look, in Russia, they have 
chandeliers hanging in their rail sta-
tions. So I am not sure that we nec-
essarily need to emulate Russian infra-
structure, particularly focusing our 
hard-earned taxpayer dollars on hang-
ing chandeliers and other artwork that 
the chairman categorizes as art infra-
structure. I don’t consider art infra-
structure. I don’t think my constitu-
ents would either. 
Our infrastructure is crumbling. I 
live in a district that is connected to 
Tennessee via the I–40 bridge, a glaring 
example of where we need to be placing 
our infrastructure dollars. That bridge 
was shut down just about 6 weeks ago 
for structural deficiencies. 
Ironically, we have two bridges con-
necting Arkansas and Tennessee. They 
are in Memphis and West Memphis, Ar-
kansas. One bridge which was built in 
1969, we refer to it as the ‘‘new bridge.’’ 
That is how old it is. 
Thankfully, those structural defects 
were found in time. But the majority is 
proposing to waste some of the billions 
of dollars on infrastructure on art—and 
without any way to pay for it after 
sending $70 billion to transit agencies 
over the last year to support them 
through the pandemic. But now the 
majority thinks we should be allowing 
these same agencies to divert Federal 
resources for art and that it is okay to 
use that money for paintings and what-
ever else you might consider. 
If you vote against this amendment, 
your vote says that you believe that 
art is infrastructure, Mr. Speaker, and 
that we should send taxpayer dollars to 
support infrastructure dollars as art. It 
is as simple as that. 
Our limited transportation resources 
need to be invested in rebuilding our 
communities’ roads and bridges. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this en bloc amendment No. 3, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 504, the pre-
vious 
question 
is 
ordered 
on 
the 
amendments en bloc offered by the 
gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DEFAZIO). 
The question is on the amendments 
en bloc. 
The question was taken; and the

the ayes appear to have it. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this question are

June 30, 2021 
Act, the Secretary of Transportation shall 
establish a working group, to be known as 
the ‘‘Climate-Safe Infrastructure Working 
Group’’ (in this section referred to as the 
‘‘Working Group’’), to examine how to inte-
grate scientific data regarding the projected 
impacts and risks of climate change into in-
frastructure planning, design, engineering, 
construction, operation, and maintenance 
that is funded by the Federal Government. 
(b) 
COMPOSITION.—The 
Working 
Group 
shall consist of the following: 
(1) One or more representatives from each 
of the Federal agencies that participate in 
the U.S. Global Change Research Program. 
(2) One or more representatives from the 
Department of the Treasury. 
(3) One or more professional engineers with 
relevant expertise in infrastructure design. 
(4) One or more scientists from the Na-
tional Academy of Sciences. 
(5) One or more scientists, social scientists, 
and experts from academic and research in-
stitutions who have expertise in— 
(A) climate change projections and im-
pacts; 
(B) engineering; 
(C) architecture; or 
(D) other relevant areas of expertise. 
(6) One or more licensed architects with 
relevant expertise in infrastructure design. 
(7) One or more certified planners with rel-
evant expertise in climate change impacts. 
(8) One or more representatives of State, 
local, and Tribal governments. 
(9) One or more representatives of environ-
mental justice groups. 
(c) DUTIES.—The Working Group shall con-
sider and examine, at a minimum, the fol-
lowing matters: 
(1) The current informational and institu-
tional barriers to integrating scientific data 
regarding the projected impacts and risks of 
climate change into infrastructure planning, 
design, engineering, construction, operation, 
and maintenance that is funded by the Fed-
eral Government. 
(2) The critical information needed by en-
gineers, certified planners, Federal, State, 
and local governments, and other persons 
charged with infrastructure upgrades and 
maintenance to better address the impacts 
and risks of climate change over the lifetime 
of infrastructure projects. 
(3) With respect to Federal investment and 
planning for infrastructure, how to select an 
appropriate, adaptive engineering design for 
a range of future climate scenarios. 
(4) How to incentivize and incorporate 
transportation systems thinking, consid-
ering how various transportation and infra-
structure projects are linked together in a 
metropolitan region or community, into re-
gional planning and engineering design to 
ensure the social, economic, and environ-
mental benefits of transportation and infra-
structure projects are maximized. 
(5) With respect to Federal investment and 
planning for infrastructure, how to take ac-
count of the risks of cascading infrastruc-
ture failures and develop more holistic and 
equitable approaches to evaluating and miti-
gating risks of climate change. 
(6) How to ensure that Federal investments 
in infrastructure resilience benefit all com-
munities, including communities of color, 
low-income communities, Tribal commu-
nities, and other communities that face a 
disproportionate risk from climate change 
and may have experienced long-standing 
unmet needs and underinvestment in critical 
infrastructure. 
(7) How Federal agencies can track and 
monitor federally-funded climate resilient 
infrastructure in a coordinated fashion to— 
(A) help build an understanding of the 
costs and benefits of climate resilient infra-
structure; 
(B) build the capacity for climate resilient 
infrastructure; and 
(C) plan for investments for the future. 
(d) COORDINATION AND CONSIDERATIONS.—In 
carrying out its duties, the Working Group 
shall— 
(1) coordinate with other Federal climate 
change 
adaptation 
planning 
efforts 
and 
strategies that advance reliability and safety 
in infrastructure, including the Mitigation 
Framework Leadership Group and the Na-
tional Mitigation Investment Strategy; and 
(2) consider and build upon existing infor-
mation relating to climate change, including 
information from the most recent National 
Climate Assessment. 
(e) PUBLIC INPUT.—In carrying out its du-
ties, the Working Group shall, prior to sub-
mission of a draft report under subsection 
(f), engage in a public stakeholder process 
by— 
(1) holding regional public meetings with 
key stakeholders, including climate experts, 
infrastructure experts, State, local, and com-
munity groups, and infrastructure finance 
and insurance experts; and 
(2) providing the public an opportunity to 
provide views, for a period of at least 60 days, 
to the Working Group regarding the best 
way to incorporate scientific data regarding 
the projected impacts and risks of climate 
change into infrastructure planning, design, 
engineering, construction, operation, and 
maintenance that is funded by the Federal 
Government. 
(f) PRELIMINARY RECOMMENDATIONS.— 
(1) SUBMISSION.—Not later than 1 year after 
the date of enactment of this Act, the Work-
ing Group shall submit to the President and 
Congress a draft report that includes pre-
liminary recommendations addressing the 
each of the matters described in subsection 
(c). 
(2) PUBLIC COMMENT.—The Working Group 
shall make draft report submitted under 
paragraph (1) available to the public for com-
ment for a period of not less than 60 days 
prior to submission of the final report under 
subsection (g).

den of, any combination of economic, social, 
environmental, and climate stressors.

‘‘(B) AREA DESCRIBED.—An area described

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 508, the gen-
tleman from Oregon (Mr. DEFAZIO) and 
the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. 
CRAWFORD) each will control 10 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Oregon. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of this en bloc amendment, which pro-
vides for the consideration of 38 amend-
ments filed by Members and made in 
order by the Committee on Rules. The 
amendments contained in this en bloc 
touch upon various policy areas in the 
base bill. 
The surface transportation amend-
ments include: 
Expressing the sense of Congress on 
the importance of protecting workers 
in transition to electric vehicles. 
Promoting a more diverse transpor-
tation workforce and more inclusive 
work sites for infrastructure projects. 
Allowing high-performing local pub-
lic agencies to utilize enhanced project 
delivery methods when appropriate. 
Expanding the number of veterans in 
the transportation sector through the 
Transportation 
Workforce 
Outreach 
Program. 
Requiring 
EV 
supply 
equipment 
projects to be performed by qualified 
electricians with proper certification. 
Adding language to increase bridge 
resiliency for seismic events. 
Strengthening 
reporting 
require-
ments under the Reconnecting Neigh-
borhoods Program. 
Allowing 
private 
high-speed 
rail 
projects access to credit risk premium 
subsidies for rail financing to develop 
high-speed rail projects. 
These are just some of the highlights 
of the amendments included. I thank 
my colleagues for their thoughtful 
amendments to improve the INVEST in 
America Act. I urge the adoption of the 
amendment. I will remember to vote 
properly this time, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. CRAWFORD. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume, and I claim the time in opposi-
tion to this en bloc of amendments. 
Again, this bill is nothing more than 
a partisan exercise, and this en bloc 
just throws together, again, a bunch of 
bad ideas with little opportunity for 
input or debate. 
Nothing further proves that point 
than the disproportionate amount of 
Democrat amendments we will be con-
sidering today, many of which will not 
be subjected to the scrutiny of stand-
alone votes or debate. 
Over 100 Democrat amendments have 
been approved by the Rules Committee 
while less than 30 Republican amend-
ments have been made in order. 
Unfortunately, this is not just about 
the terrible legislative process—it is 
also about the policy which moves for-
ward with no pay-for in sight. This is 
completely unacceptable. 
Members should not be forced to 
choose between voting on a bill that 
just burdens future generations of 
Americans with more debt and greater 
dependence on China or passing an-
other short-term surface extension. 
But those are the two options pre-
sented to us by the majority here 
today. 
What we are looking at is a bill with 
policies that prevent rural commu-
nities from growing and that raises in-
flation so average Americans will con-
tinue to see rising prices in everyday 
products like milk and gas. 
I had hoped we wouldn’t make this 
bad bill even worse, but this en bloc 
only adds more spending and more bad 
policies. 
This bill is over 1,600 pages and over 
230 amendments were filed by Members 
on both sides. But we are going to 
spend less than 12 hours working 
through amendments and debate to 
rush to an inevitable partisan vote. 
This is not a process anyone should 
be proud of and very indicative of how 
we got here today: just a one-sided, 
my-way-or-the-highway approach. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
oppose this en bloc amendment, and I 
reserve the balance of my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3559 
June 30, 2021 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
DOGGETT). 
Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, since 
they make such important decisions 
concerning mobility, social and eco-
nomic opportunity, metropolitan plan-
ning organizations across the country 
have boards that should be fully rep-
resentative of all those who are served 
within their jurisdiction. And while 
some MPOs do just that, my amend-
ment No. 25, which was a part of en 
bloc No. 1, addresses those that do not 
by ensuring that MPO board member-
ship is equal, equitable, and propor-
tional to the population. 
I would like to engage in a colloquy 
with the chairman. 
Mr. Chairman, I thank you for sup-
porting this amendment and trust that 
you share that objective. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. I totally concur in the 
amendment. 
Mr. DOGGETT. If, for example, as 
happened down in Texas, an MPO arbi-
trarily provides that a new MPO voting 
representative gets added any time a 
new city comes along and surpasses a 
population of 50,000, but is not pro-
viding a voting representative for 
every 50,000 residents in longstanding 
urban areas, would you agree that that 
does 
not 
constitute 
representation 
which is equal, proportional, or equi-
table, and that with the adoption of 
this amendment a change must be 
made to ensure equal representation? 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Absolutely, I concur 
with the gentleman. 
Mr. DOGGETT. I thank you very 
much for accepting the amendment. I 
think it will be helpful to us here. 
Much of my concern about this issue 
arose from the fact that in our area, 
my hometown of Austin, an effort was 
made to require in transportation plan-
ning that we measure greenhouse gas 
emissions and that we consider that. It 
was rejected, and it is not representa-
tive of the feelings of people in the cen-
tral Texas area. 
I appreciate not only your endorsing 
amendment No. 25, which can bring 
about important changes, but also in-
corporating in the base bill the Green 
Transportation Act which we worked 
on with your staff to ensure that green-
house gas emissions are measured, 
evaluated, and considered in transpor-
tation planning. 
b 2015 
Mr. CRAWFORD. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. PALLONE). 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I stand 
in support of this amendment. I would 
like to thank the chairman of the En-
ergy and Commerce’s Energy Sub-
committee, Chairman RUSH, for his 
dedicated commitment to supporting 
the development of electric vehicle in-
frastructure. 
Electrifying the transportation sec-
tor is critical to meeting our climate 
goals. It is expected that nearly seven 
million electric vehicles will be sold 
per year by 2025. To ensure we are 
ready for this growing demand, we 
must invest in the necessary charging 
and manufacturing infrastructure so 
that Americans are able to reliably 
power their cars. Chairman RUSH’s 
amendment is crucial to this effort and 
supports charging infrastructure build- 
out. 
We must also guarantee the benefits 
of electric vehicles are available and 
accessible to all communities. Minor-
ity communities and rural and under-
served communities, stand to benefit 
from EV infrastructure development, 
as EV charging infrastructure can help 
support local economies and help sup-
port reduced emissions. Provisions in 
this amendment help address the lack 
of EV infrastructure in these commu-
nities and bring resources to this area. 
Additionally, as we see growing EV 
adoption in this country, we must 
make sure our transition prioritizes 
American workers. 
Mr. CRAWFORD. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Again, just as a reminder for the 
many of the tens of people who are 
watching at home, this en bloc amend-
ment contains 38 Democrat amend-
ments. In contrast to the en bloc No. 3 
that we just considered that contained 
all of the Republican amendments, 
only 19 were considered there. So that 
represents, again, 8 percent of the total 
number of amendments that were made 
in order. 
And there are a good number of these 
amendments, by the way, that are of-
fered by Members on the committee. In 
fact, I mean, there are an awful lot of 
them. And it just underscores how this 
process has been so flawed and so ill- 
conceived. 
Back in the not-too-distant past—I 
have been on this committee now for 11 
years—we would bring a bill to com-
mittee to mark up, and it was agreed 
upon by the four principals of the com-
mittee. And the amendments would be 
agreed upon by the four principals of 
the committee, and that is how we 
achieved bipartisanship. Those days, 
apparently, are gone. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Rhode 
Island (Mr. CICILLINE). 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, our in-
frastructure is stuck in the 1950s, and 
it doesn’t have to be this way. It is 
long past time for America to bring our 
bridges, roads, public transit, and 
water infrastructure into the 21st cen-
tury. 
The INVEST in America Act provides 
$715 billion to accomplish this goal 
through bold investments in modern, 
sustainable infrastructure. This legis-
lation will create millions of good-pay-
ing 
jobs 
while 
combating 
climate 
change and investing in the well-being 
of our cities and towns. 
I worked with Chairman DEFAZIO and 
the committee to secure nearly $20 
million in funding for four high-pri-
ority infrastructure projects in Rhode 
Island. 
The quality of roads and bridges is 
particularly important. That is why I 
introduced amendment 19, to bring 
funding for the National Scenic By-
ways Program in line with historic 
funding levels, adjusted for inflation. 
This will allow the Secretary of Trans-
portation to designate new National 
Scenic 
Byways 
and 
All-American 
Roads; and allow already designated 
roads, 
including 
the 
Revolutionary 
Heritage Byway in Bristol, Rhode Is-
land, to apply for competitive grants. 
I urge the House to adopt the en bloc 
package 4, which includes my amend-
ment No. 19, and to pass the underlying 
bill without delay. 
Mr. CRAWFORD. Mr. Speaker, may I 
inquire as to the remaining time? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Arkansas has 71⁄2 minutes 
remaining. The gentleman from Oregon 
has 5 minutes remaining. 
Mr. CRAWFORD. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Massa-
chusetts (Mr. MOULTON), a member of 
the committee. 
Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
urge passage of my amendment to in-
crease funding for the Passenger Rail 
Improvement, Modernization, and Ex-
pansion program. 
The 
coalition 
that 
supports 
the 
PRIME program spans ideology and ge-
ography. We are united in this belief: 
America can still do big things. 
Ten of our colleagues joined me by 
cosponsoring 
this 
amendment 
and, 
today, 80 Representatives and Senators 
joined Representatives COSTA, OCASIO- 
CORTEZ, and me, calling for invest-
ments in high-speed rail. 
In our country today, transportation 
is the leading driver of carbon emis-
sions. Americans have fewer options 
for inner-city travel than citizens of 
China and France. And families are un-
able to afford homes where they work, 
and they can’t go to where they work 
from where they can afford homes. 
On top of that, trains are slower in 
America today than they were in the 
1930s, a century ago. 
The PRIME program is a great first 
step to fixing these problems. Regions 
like the Pacific Northwest can create 
an economic mega-region and see a 10:1 
return by investing in the Cascadia 
High-Speed Rail Corridor, at less than 
half the cost of another lane of high-
way in either direction. 
Americans across the Midwest would 
have access to new jobs and housing 
opportunities. You could live in Chat-
tanooga and get to work in Atlanta in 
a little more than a half hour. 
We can build a system that is faster 
than driving and more convenient than 
flying, and we can power it on low- 
power emissions. 
Mr. Speaker, there is no reason we 
shouldn’t adopt this.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE

June 30, 2021 
Mr. CRAWFORD. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
American demand for high-speed rail 
is low; and Federal money for transpor-
tation must be spent on projects and 
infrastructure that Americans need 
and use. 
The issue is not whether America 
must lead the world in high-speed rail, 
but whether Americans actually want 
high-speed rail. 
In California, the high-speed rail 
project launched in 2008 has been con-
tinually plagued by cost increases and 
delays. According to the L.A. Times, 
costs have gone from $33 billion to over 
$100 billion, and it is at least 12 years 
behind schedule. 
These projects inevitably result in 
environmental and endangered species 
concerns, eminent domain fights, po-
tential displacement of families and 
businesses, including in low-income 
communities, and highly questionable 
demand that will leave these railroads 
dependent on government subsidies for-
ever. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. PANETTA). 
Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of my amendment to the IN-
VEST in America Act that would save 
our Nation’s pollinators. 
In my district, on the Central Coast, 
we grow over 100 different specialty 
crops that greatly contribute to our 
Nation’s food security. But what many 
people don’t realize is that our agri-
culture, from the Central Coast, or to 
the center of America, would not be 
possible without our pollinators. 
Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, those 
pollinators and their habitats on are 
the verge of extinction. That is why 
the robust investment, as provided in 
my amendment, is needed now more 
than ever. The amendment sets up 
grant programs that State transpor-
tation departments can use to grow 
more flora and fauna, from grasses to 
wildflowers to milkweed, so that polli-
nators can thrive. 
I 
want 
to 
thank 
Representative 
CARBAJAL, my Central Coast neighbor, 
for his partnership on this amendment, 
and our work together on bills and 
amendments like this to revive our 
pollinators habitats and regrow their 
population. 
By passing this amendment, we not 
only can save the pollinators, but we 
can also secure the food supply of our 
Nation. 
Mr. CRAWFORD. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Texas 
(Ms. ESCOBAR). 
Ms. ESCOBAR. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
both committees of jurisdiction for 
their work on the INVEST in America 
Act. 
I would like to share some of the sig-
nificant resources that this bill will 
bring to my home district of El Paso, 
Texas. 
This bill would bring almost $20 mil-
lion in investment directly to two 
projects for the city and county of El 
Paso. The first project, the John Hayes 
Extension, 
would 
assist 
the 
expo-
nential growth we have seen in the 
Eastern portion of our country. 
The second project, the Stanton 
Street Bridge Intelligent Transpor-
tation System, would improve the traf-
fic flow around this land port of entry. 
The INVEST in America Act also es-
tablishes the Reconnecting Neighbor-
hoods Program to help communities, 
like downtown El Paso, that were di-
vided when highways, such as I–10, 
were built through the heart of our 
city. 
The amendments I have offered to 
this bill would bring crucial funding to 
some of the most economically dis-
advantaged members of our commu-
nity. They also recognize our key loca-
tion on the U.S.-Mexico trade corridor. 
My amendments include millions of 
dollars for colonial surface, drinking 
water, and wastewater infrastructure, 
as well as an increase in an optional 
set-aside for infrastructure critical to 
trade in border communities. 
Simply put, the INVEST in America 
Act is a transformational measure for 
El Paso, and I look forward to voting 
for it. 
Mr. CRAWFORD. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI). 
Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise to urge my colleagues to sup-
port this en bloc amendment, which in-
cludes mine and Representative POR-
TER’s amendment to improve booster 
seat safety. 
In December, my Oversight Sub-
committee on Economic and Consumer 
Policy released a concerning report on 
the safety of booster seats for children. 
Booster seatmakers have been mar-
keting their booster seats as safe for 
30-pound children, a standard not rec-
ommended by experts. And these mak-
ers have been left largely unregulated 
when it comes to side-impact testing. 
Some makers gave passing grades to 
booster seats because the seat main-
tained its structural integrity. Mean-
while, the dummy was damaged. And 
we all know what a damaged dummy 
equates to: The severe spinal cord or 
other injuries to a child. 
We expect the products we buy to be 
tried and true, but, sadly, that is not 
the case with booster seats. And when 
it comes to our children, we cannot 
continue to stand idly by. 
My 
amendment 
would 
require 
NHTSA to revise their recommended 
minimum weight for a booster seat to 
40 pounds, and would require booster 
seatmakers to produce labels that dis-
play recommendations clearly for par-
ents. 
Mr. CRAWFORD. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, how 
much time do I have remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has 1 minute remaining. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Well, we have heard the same tired 
arguments: Over 200 amendments in 
committee from the Republicans. 
And today, all day, on the floor: Not 
bipartisan. 
It is pretty simple, if you deny cli-
mate change and you deny the need to 
do things differently than the failures 
of the last 30 years in building 35,000 
lane miles and making congestion 
worse in our 100 largest cities; and you 
don’t want to fund transit; and you 
don’t want to fund rail options; and 
transit includes rural areas and small 
cities, which is a new emphasis in this 
program; if you don’t want to repair 
America’s 47,000 crumbling bridges and 
national highway system, you are pro-
posing $20 billion less than we are for 
repairing bridges and highways. 
You object to the fact that we want 
States to fix things first, and also to 
look at alternatives to paving over the 
whole country and causing more in-
duced congestion. You deny climate 
change. You deny fossil fuel pollution. 
I hope you don’t go through what my 
region just went through. We have had 
50 people die in Portland. No one has 
air-conditioning there; two-thirds of 
the people don’t. It has never been—it 
was 45 degrees above normal. This is 
not normal. 
Climate change is real. Keep up the 
denial and you are going to destroy 
this country and the planet. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to direct their re-
marks to the Chair. 
Mr. CRAWFORD. Mr. Speaker, may I 
inquire as to how much time I have re-
maining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has 7 minutes remaining. 
Mr. CRAWFORD. Mr. Speaker, I will 
try to only use 6 of those 7 minutes. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time 
as I may consume. 
This bill contains—tons of money 
just won’t matter if we fail to support 
programs for roads and bridges. The 
huge funding levels aren’t what they 
appear to be because the bill spreads 
the dollars thin over 41 new programs; 
adds many new burdensome mandates 
to programs that States rely on; 
doesn’t include meaningful regulatory 
reforms so dollars are used more effec-
tively. 
Instead of getting money to States 
quickly so they can use it how they 
need, the majority adds new restric-
tions, like prohibiting new highway ca-
pacity that would hamper States’ abil-
ity to build the projects that their 
communities need.

this big, drastic change. This bill wants

June 30, 2021 
to force Americans off the roads and 
into transit and passenger rail. But the 
central planning push couldn’t come at 
a worse time because of the pandemic- 
related 
uncertainty 
and 
ongoing 
changes in transportation, work, and 
living patterns that will last for years 
to come. 
Even before the pandemic, 85 percent 
of Americans traveled to work in a car, 
truck, or van, and only 5 percent used 
public transportation. But the major-
ity chose to bankrupt the programs the 
overwhelming majority of Americans 
rely on. 
As employers are becoming more 
flexible with teleworking, the majority 
believes we should be less flexible with 
our State and local partners. We should 
focus on core infrastructure and proven 
programs that provide for flexibility 
instead of dictating a one-size-fits-all 
progressive idea of what transportation 
should look like. 
The majority calls this is a trans-
formative bill. Well, the American peo-
ple can be assured they will see the 
price of gas and goods transform up-
wards with the increasing inflation 
this unpaid-for bill will drive. 
We just heard 38 amendments and not 
a single reference to how any of those 
would be paid for. In fact, there is not 
any pay-for in this entire bill. Any ar-
gument that we don’t want to work 
with the majority is just simply false. 
In addition to the strong resiliency 
title in Republican bill STARTER Act 
2.0, I frequently said I was willing to 
work with the majority. And the rank-
ing member said that he wanted to 
work with the majority on their pri-
ority of reducing transportation’s im-
pact on the environment, but that we 
also needed to work to address Repub-
lican priorities like streamlining. They 
simply refused. 
In committee, we proposed com-
promises that would include both cli-
mate and streamlining provisions and 
offered a ‘‘Buy American’’ amendment 
to ensure we weren’t sending U.S. dol-
lars for electric vehicle infrastructure 
to support the Chinese Government’s 
slave labor and environmental destruc-
tion. The majority rejected those pro-
posals. Instead, House Democrats are 
willing to sell out to China to claim 
they are reaching their climate goals. 
Republican Members are not willing 
to ignore the fact that relying on 
China, the worst polluter in the world, 
will absolutely increase global emis-
sions. 
Furthermore, we have to remember 
this is a transportation bill, first and 
foremost. Spending $1 out of every $2 
on meeting Green New Deal objectives 
begs the question: Is this bill still a 
transportation bill? 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on 
this en bloc amendment, I urge a ‘‘no’’ 
vote on the underlying bill, and I yield 
the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 504, the pre-
vious 
question 
is 
ordered 
on 
the 
amendments en bloc offered by the 
gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DEFAZIO). 
The question is on the amendments 
en bloc. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. CRAWFORD. Mr. Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this question are 
postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO. 10 OFFERED BY MRS. CAMMACK 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now 
in order to consider amendment No. 10 
printed in House Report 117–75. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Mr. Speaker, I have 
an amendment at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Page 1029, after line 8, insert the following: 
SEC. 4312. TRANSPORTATION OF AGRICULTURAL 
COMMODITIES AND FARM SUPPLIES. 
Section 229(a)(1) of the Motor Carrier Safe-
ty Improvement Act of 1999 (49 U.S.C. 31136 
note) is amended— 
(1) in subparagraph (B) by striking ‘‘or’’ at 
the end; 
(2) in subparagraph (C) by striking the pe-
riod at the end and inserting ‘‘; or’’; and 
(3) by adding at the end the following: 
‘‘(D) drivers transporting livestock (as de-
fined in section 602 of the Emergency Live-
stock Feed Assistance Act of 1988 (7 U.S.C. 
1471) including insects) within a 150 air-mile 
radius from the final destination of the live-
stock.’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 508, the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Florida 
(Mrs. 
CAMMACK) and a Member opposed each 
will control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Florida. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to offer a bipartisan amendment 
to give needed flexibility to our live-
stock 
haulers 
and 
producers. 
My 
amendment would exempt livestock 
haulers from hours-of-service require-
ments for the last 150 air miles to their 
final destination. 
Mr. Speaker, since last year, live-
stock haulers have been temporarily 
exempted 
from 
hours-of-service 
re-
quirements. However, a permanent so-
lution for our livestock haulers and 
cattle producers is urgently needed. 
Speaking as a Floridian, cattle is one 
of Florida’s most important exports. It 
is typically an 8-hour journey just to 
transport cattle from our producers in 
south Florida all the way to the north 
end of the State, before continuing on-
ward to destinations in the Midwest or 
elsewhere. 
For the health and welfare of the cat-
tle in transit, livestock haulers need 
flexibility on both the front and back 
end of their journey to get the cattle 
safely and efficiently transported to 
their final destinations. 
Hauling live animals is simply not 
the same as hauling a trailer full of 
toilet paper; however, we saw that both 
were vital during the pandemic. 
Although I and many other Members 
on both sides of the aisle support this 
measure wholeheartedly, I will reluc-
tantly withdraw my amendment today. 
I remain hopeful that as we move for-
ward, we can work to fix these hours- 
of-service rules to provide greater 
flexibility for the success of our Na-
tion’s producers and livestock haulers. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time, and I withdraw the amend-
ment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
amendment is withdrawn. 
The Chair understands that amend-
ment No. 70 will not be offered. 
AMENDMENT NO. 108 OFFERED BY MS. VAN 
DUYNE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now 
in order to consider amendment No. 108 
printed in House Report 117–75. 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Mr. Speaker, I 
have an amendment at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Page 705, after line 3, insert the following: 
SEC. 1640. HOV FACILITY REVIEW. 
Section 166 of title 23, United States Code, 
is further amended by adding at the end the 
following: 
‘‘(h) REVIEW
AND REMOVAL.—If the Sec-
retary of Transportation determines appro-
priate, 10 years after construction of an HOV 
facility operated in compliance with this 
section, a State may— 
‘‘(1) conduct a review of such facility; and 
‘‘(2) remove such facility and repay any 
funds associated with such facility.’’. 
SEC. 2. . 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 508, the gen-
tlewoman from Texas (Ms. VAN DUYNE) 
and a Member opposed each will con-
trol 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Texas. 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Mr. Speaker, my 
amendment would fix an ongoing prob-
lem that I see back home and in other 
areas of the country which highlights 
the need for local control to be able to 
fix local problems. 
One example is U.S. Highway 75, just 
across my district line in Dallas. The 
highway received funds over 10 years 
ago to install HOV lanes to help allevi-
ate congestion in the area. Unfortu-
nately, 10 years later, these lanes are 
not being used and are actually cre-
ating more congestion. Due to Federal 
DOT regulations, these lanes cannot be 
removed even if the funds are repaid 
for the cost of installation. 
This amendment would allow for in-
creased flexibility to local elected offi-
cials to properly manage traffic flow as 
patterns change. Because these funds 
would be repaid to the DOT, these 
funds could be used to fund more and 
essential 
future 
transportation 
projects. 
Unfortunately, this bill further lim-
its local government control. Local 
leaders know better than bureaucrats 
in Washington how to solve problems, 
and my amendment would provide the 
relief needed to local governments 
without any Federal cost.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3562 
June 30, 2021 
Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this 
amendment, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I claim 
the time in opposition to the amend-
ment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, this totally contradicts 
the intent of the Congestion Mitigation 
and Air Quality Improvement program, 
a relatively small program in terms of 
the entire bill, but a very, very impor-
tant program. 
As I mentioned earlier, we have been 
doing the same thing for 30 years. 30,511 
new freeway lane-miles in and around 
our 100 largest urban areas. The cost of 
delay has gone from $16 billion a year 
to $166 billion a year, which wastes way 
more than we are spending to deal with 
the problem, and delay is up a stag-
gering 144 percent and pollution is 
worse. 
So this is an amendment that would 
say, okay, you can take the money to 
deal with congestion mitigation and 
air quality, you can spend it to build 
an HOV lane, and then after you toll 
people on that HOV lane—maybe like 
in Virginia where you can pay $48 for 10 
miles in the Bentley lane during rush 
hour sometimes—and then they pay 
back the money, then they convert it 
to a single-occupancy vehicle lane, 
voila, we are back at another induced- 
demand 
congested 
road, 
the 
same 
Groundhog Day strategy we have been 
doing for 30 years that doesn’t work. 
HOV lanes and other operational im-
provements are eligible under the 
CMAQ program. They are part of the 
solution, but not in this form. They 
allow more people to move more effi-
ciently in the most congested transpor-
tation corridors by getting more than 
one person per car. But this would only 
do that temporarily and then revert to 
one person per car. Great idea. 
So it allows van pools, car pools, and 
transit in these lanes. They benefit all 
drivers. So in this case, we would say, 
well, yeah, for a while, they will ben-
efit car pools, van pools, and transit, 
but then we are going to go back to 
putting single-occupancy vehicles in 
them. That is not a solution to the 
problem. 
It is of particular concern, because it 
allows for HOV restrictions to be re-
pealed without any analysis of the im-
pacts on the traffic in the corridor. 
Under this proposal, as I said, all of 
those who have begun to use it, the 
families, transit riders, car poolers in 
HOV lanes, they are going to go back 
into gridlock traffic with everybody 
else. It is an extraordinarily bad idea 
whose time has not come. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Mr. Speaker, while 
I appreciate the gentleman’s comments 
on increasing traffic and increasing 
congestion, what I would remind him is 
that this is going to be looked at by 
local elected officials. And if those 
local elected officials deem that this is 
an unused lane, which is what we are 
seeing on Highway 75, we will actually 
be opening up and relieving congestion 
by allowing those elected officials to be 
able to say we are going to open this 
back up, which will have much more 
response to alleviating traffic, alle-
viating problems with congestion, al-
lowing many more people to be able to 
drive on that lane, as opposed to pay-
ing money to create more congestion, 
more carbon emissions, and less effi-
ciency. 
Again, these cities would be paying 
back those dollars which could be used 
for necessary future transportation 
costs. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Mr. Speaker, how 
much time is remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman has 21⁄2 minutes remaining. 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Again, I would argue that this is an 
opportunity to be able to get money 
back from cities that have found that 
the HOV lanes have not had the im-
pact, have not had the necessary effect 
on creating less congestion, but what 
they found is they have actually cre-
ated more congestion. 
So in areas where traffic patterns 
may have changed, where additional 
highways or other roads may have alle-
viated those conditions, where 10 years 
prior HOV lanes were necessary, they 
are no longer necessary, instead of 
keeping them closed, we will actually 
be able to open them up and provide 
the help that these funds were initially 
used for. 
Mr. Speaker, I would encourage adop-
tion of this amendment, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, perhaps the gentle-
woman has an absolute unique cir-
cumstance in her district or her State. 
But to make this a national policy for 
a program that is intended to deal with 
congestion management and air qual-
ity would be a huge mistake. 
I cannot support the amendment, I 
urge people to vote ‘‘no,’’ and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 504, the pre-
vious 
question 
is 
ordered 
on 
the 
amendment offered by the gentle-
woman from Texas (Ms. VAN DUYNE). 
The question is on the amendment. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the noes appear to have it. 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Mr. Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays.

ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 508, the gen-
tlewoman from Kansas (Ms. DAVIDS) 
and the gentleman from North Caro-
lina (Mr. ROUZER) each will control 10 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Kansas. 
Ms. DAVIDS of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this 
en bloc amendment, which provides for 
the 
consideration 
of 
25 
individual 
amendments to address both drinking 
and wastewater infrastructure con-
cerns. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
these 
amendments 
make several improvements to the un-
derlying legislation, including increas-
ing Federal investment in failing or in-
sufficient septic systems, which is a 
pervasive water quality and human 
health challenge facing many of our 
rural and economically disadvantaged 
communities, including those from Or-
egon, Alabama, and New York; 
Addressing emerging pollution con-
cerns, 
including 
so-called 
flushable 
wipes that are clogging our Nation’s 
sewers, and the discharge of plastic pel-
lets into our waste stream; 
Addressing several local water qual-
ity challenges, including transbound-
ary sewage flows that have adversely 
affected the San Diego region, the in-
adequate wastewater infrastructure in 
the U.S.-Mexico border region, and the 
legacy radiological contamination of 
Coldwater Creek in St. Louis, Missouri; 
Clarifying audit and reporting re-
quirements for EPA’s Green Project 
Reserve; and 
Focusing additional attention on po-
tential discrimination and civil rights 
violations in water infrastructure fund-
ing so we can ensure these programs 
equitably help all communities address 
their long-term wastewater concerns. 
Each of these amendments further 
strengthens the ability of this bill to 
address the water and wastewater in-
frastructure needs of this Nation in a 
way that protects public health and 
our environment; creates well-paying 
jobs here in the United States; and ad-
dresses the historic water infrastruc-
ture challenges that is facing our rural, 
small, and economically disadvantaged 
communities. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the members 
for working with the Committee on 
Transportation and Infrastructure and 
the Committee on Energy and Com-
merce to improve this bill and urge 
passage of this en bloc amendment. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume,

and I rise in opposition to the amend-
ments en bloc. 
These amendments en bloc would fur-
ther expand upon the majority’s wish 
list of progressive priorities for water 
infrastructure, just like the underlying 
bill. 
These amendments create additional 
programs costing billions in taxpayer 
dollars. 
In addition, several of the amend-
ments create additional burdens and 
take discretionary, science-based regu-
latory decisionmaking out of the hands 
of the experts. 
Again, this bill is nothing more than 
a partisan exercise, and this en bloc 
just throws together another bunch of 
bad ideas with little opportunity for 
input or debate. 
This group of Democrat amendments 
we are considering at the moment is 
completely lopsided, and by consid-
ering them en bloc, they will not be 
subjected to the scrutiny of standalone 
votes or debate. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
oppose this en bloc amendment, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. DAVIDS of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Missouri (Ms. BUSH). 
Ms. BUSH. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentlewoman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, St. Louis and I rise 
today in support of our amendment to 
the INVEST in America Act. 
Our amendment would save lives by 
reviewing the inadequate efforts to 
clean up Coldwater Creek in north St. 
Louis County and posting signs to pre-
vent further hazardous exposure to our 
community. 
The CDC estimates that 350,000 peo-
ple have potential radioactive exposure 
from Coldwater Creek. That is nearly 
one in two residents in Missouri’s First 
District—my district—and I am pos-
sibly one of those people. Too many of 
us have gotten sick or died because of 
exposure to this toxic water. No one 
should have to face such an injustice. 
St. Louis deserves better. St. Louis 
needs better. 
Mr. Speaker, this amendment would 
immediately start saving lives, and I 
urge my colleagues to support it. In-
vest in America. 
b 2230 
Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Washington (Mrs. RODGERS), the rank-
ing member of the Committee on En-
ergy and Commerce. 
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise in opposition to amend-
ments en bloc No. 5. 
En bloc No. 5 is filled with proposals 
that spend excessively on new pro-
grams, create duplicate programs, ig-
nore scientific and public input, and 
place serious burdens on rural commu-
nities. 
For instance, one amendment, which 
I might add is very well-meaning, cre-
ates a new program with a price tag of 
$200 million per year, or eight times 
the amount for the existing program 
that covers physical upgrades and 
training to deal with all terrorism 
threats and resilience. 
There is a proposal in this bloc to re-
quire EPA to establish a website for 
testing private water wells. Yet, for 
those seeking information, EPA al-
ready has a website to provide informa-
tion to the public on private well test-
ing, preventing water pollution, identi-
fying contaminants, and contacts for 
emergency response. 
In another area, en bloc No. 5 re-
quires GAO to provide Congress policy 
options for best practices for EPA to 
use with States and local governments 
to include the public in a consolidation 
process. 
The study is unnecessary and puni-
tive to rural communities. Section 1414 
of the Safe Drinking Water Act already 
has mandatory assessment require-
ments for systems that have problems. 
Mr. Speaker, I have identified here 
only a few of the provisions that I find 
troublesome. There are other matters 
in this amendment that are difficult 
when it comes to workability and also 
that have other policy concerns. 
On a separate note, I must express 
my opposition to the inclusion in the 
previous bloc of amendments of the NO 
EXHAUST Act, a partisan Energy and 
Commerce bill. This amendment pro-
vides subsidies for the rich to buy elec-
tric vehicles at the expense of the tax-
payers and everyone else’s electric reli-
ability and utility bills. 
The amendment makes no consider-
ation for American jobs, our growing 
reliance on China for critical minerals 
to make batteries, or the strain that 
electric vehicles undoubtedly will place 
on the grid. 
The amendment even mandates new 
building codes so everyone has to in-
stall expensive electrical equipment in 
their homes and buildings for EV char-
gers, even if nobody is driving an elec-
tric vehicle. 
These kinds of policies will harm 
hardworking American families, espe-
cially those in our rural communities. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to join 
me in opposing this en bloc amend-
ment. 
Ms. DAVIDS of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, 
I wish to yield 21⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON 
LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman from Kansas 
for her leadership, and I want to take a 
moment to thank Mr. DEFAZIO for this 
transformative legislation that is real-
ly going to move America, not just in 
mobility, but in quality of life. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to also take a 
moment to offer my sympathy to a 
family in my community, the Cum-
mings family, whose mother was killed 
as she brought her son to the United 
States Naval Academy in the last 48 
hours. I hope that we will pray for 
them at this time. 
Mr. Speaker, I also want to take this 
moment to dedicate this amendment 
that Mr. ESPAILLAT and myself intro-
duced to bicyclists, motorcyclists, pe-
destrians, and wheelchair users, and 
particularly to Jamail Harris, who was 
killed on a motorcycle in an intersec-
tion at Highway 288. 
This amendment that I am offering 
in the name of others, such as Lesha 
White, Jesus Perez, David Leon Loya, 
is evidence of the dangers of mobility 
in the form of bikes and pedestrians in 
the city of Houston. 
In the past 16 years, the Houston area 
has seen 2,000 deaths of bicyclists and 
pedestrians, an average of 100 a year, 
with the last 3 years seeing the rate in-
crease to 150 a year, according to Fed-
eral statistics. 
The amendment that I am offering is 
an amendment that deals specifically 
with the safety legislation that causes 
the Department of Transportation to 
work with local entities to decide 
where those dollars will go, where the 
crashes or the numbers of crashes or 
the incidences with pedestrians and 
bike riders and motorcycles are at 
their highest. Listen to the commu-
nity. 
This is in the name of those who have 
lost their lives, these families who 
have lost a life: one crashed in a school 
bus; one was a lady helping a wheel-
chair get across the street, and she 
stopped a car and a car ran into her 
and the wheelchair. I think it is ex-
tremely important in this particular 
amendment. 
Mr. Speaker, I also want to indicate 
that I thank Mr. DEFAZIO for the legis-
lation that allows a new redoing of 
Scott Street in an earmark, a commu-
nity assessment that we are able to 
utilize for Scott Street to make a dif-
ference in that area. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to mention my 
next amendment that directs the EPA 
Administrator to establish and imple-
ment a program under which the Ad-
ministrator may award grants to com-
munity water systems to carry out ac-
tivities to educate and assist persons 
served by the community water system 
and adapting and responding to acts 
and natural hazards, including subzero 
temperatures. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Ms. DAVIDS of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield the gentlewoman from Texas an 
additional 30 seconds. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, 
this has to do with the freeze that we 
had in Houston, and I am very grateful 
for this amendment because there were 
more than 100 people who died. 
Mr. Speaker, my second amendment 
has to do with wastewater. A recent re-
port suggested that wastewater re-
sources in facilities in urban and rural 
areas were at their lowest. This forces 
a study to determine how to improve 
and to ensure that those kinds of re-
sources for wastewater and sewage are 
equal in rural and urban areas as would 
be otherwise. 
I am grateful for these amendments 
because they will change lives, and cer-
tainly, the bike amendment will allow 
us to be able to save lives.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3572 
June 30, 2021 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Invest 
in America Act (RCP 117–8 and RCP 117–9; 
H.R. 3684), and the Jackson Lee Amend-
ments incorporated in the Chairman’s En Bloc 
Amendment. 
Let me thank Chairman DEFAZIO and Rank-
ing Member GRAVES of the Transportation and 
Infrastructure Committee for their hard work in 
crafting and shepherding the legislative pack-
age before us today. 
I thank the staff of the Transportation Com-
mittee for working with me and my staff on the 
three Jackson Lee Amendments that are in-
cluded in the En Bloc Amendment. 
These amendments are intended to make a 
good bill better. 
The first amendment I want to speak to you 
about is intended to make walking, biking, 
motorcycling, and other pedestrian travel safer 
by making changes to the new ‘‘Safe Streets’’ 
program already in the bill to allow local input 
in decisions by state Department of Transpor-
tation on projects intended to reduce fatalities 
of vulnerable road users. 
This 
Jackson 
Lee-Espaillat 
Amendment 
gives local governments more control over 
where the funds for the new ‘‘Safe Streets’’ 
program are spent, by requiring state Depart-
ments of Transportation to consult with the 
local governments before carrying out these 
complete streets’ projects. 
The ‘‘Safe Streets’’ program sets aside safe-
ty funds to reduce fatalities and serious inju-
ries on public roads, with a focus on vulner-
able 
road 
users 
such 
as 
pedestrians, 
bicyclists, scooters users, and motorcyclist. 
The amendment will support local govern-
ments by giving them a voice in the implemen-
tation of projects intended to address high 
crash areas where pedestrian fatalities occur. 
The goal of this amendment is to make 
more efficient the learning curve of State De-
partments of Transportation on methods, strat-
egies and policies that yield proven reductions 
in deaths. 
We can and must do a better job of making 
the roads safer for everyone—including bike 
riders. 
As the nation celebrates its first Juneteenth 
Independence Day, it was an added bonus for 
participants to take a bike ride from Galveston 
to Houston along routes once used by former 
slaves to travel from the island to their new 
lives in the city of Houston and beyond. 
The 58-mile bike route is scenic and historic 
with lush green spaces, and eclectic neighbor-
hoods—that are linked by trails, park land and 
roads. 
This event is a welcomed recent addition to 
the 156-year history of Juneteenth celebra-
tions in the Galveston Houston area, and this 
year’s jubilation was more exuberant with the 
knowledge that the entire nation joined us in 
the festivities. 
The bike ride is not a race, but a leisure ac-
tivity that all members of the family can enjoy. 
There are adequate rest breaks along the 
way to visit historic sites like a trailer exhibit of 
memorabilia about Marshall Walter ‘‘Major’’ 
Taylor who was born on November 26, 1878. 
Taylor became a professional cyclist at 18 
and won the sprint event at the 1899 world 
track championships at the age of 20 to be-
come the first African American to achieve the 
level of cycling world champion. 
Another rest stop is at the 1867 Settlement, 
which was the home of newly freed slaves 
who bought property to form a community that 
would later be well known for the cowboy 
skills of its residents. 
A little-known fact is that some of the skills 
featured at Rodeos owe their invention or re-
finement to black cowboys—a term used to 
distinguish between whites and blacks. 
Whites were called cow hands and blacks 
referred to as ‘‘cow boys,’’ which later became 
the term for everyone working with cattle re-
gardless of race. 
Some well-known rodeo contests skills owe 
a thanks to black cowboys like Bill Pickett 
(1870–1932), who invented the form of steer 
wrestling called ‘‘bulldogging,’’ and Jesse 
Stahl (c. 1879–1935), who was a bronco rider. 
The pleasure of riding bikes has and con-
tinues to be an important source of recreation 
and exercise for millions of people who ride 
routinely or occasionally, which is evidenced 
by the growth in popularity of this biking event. 
Unfortunately, biking is not always so care-
free as this event held on Juneteenth week-
end. 
The reality for too many bicyclists is the 
dread and fear they sometimes experience 
while riding in residential, rural, or urban 
spaces. 
In June 2019, the National Highway Traffic 
Safety Administration published its traffic fatal-
ity report which showed a one percent de-
crease in traffic fatalities and a four percent in-
crease in pedestrian fatalities, but a whopping 
10 percent increase in bicyclist fatalities. 
On May 9, 2021, a hit-and-run driver who 
allegedly ran a red light slammed into a motor-
cycle, killing the rider. 
Despite less traffic on the road in 2020 due 
to the pandemic and a 2 percent reduction in 
motorcycle crashes nationally, safety officials 
are alarmed by a 17 percent increase in 
Texas motorcycle fatalities in 2020 compared 
to 2019. 
On average, a motorcyclist is killed in a 
crash on Texas roads every day. 
Last year, 482 died, accounting for 12 per-
cent of all traffic fatalities statewide. 
In my city of Houston, just last month, a 
driver allegedly ran a red light and struck and 
killed a motorcyclist on Highway 288. 
The incident happened along Holly Hall and 
Highway 288, the South Freeway. 
Witnesses told police a pickup or SUV ran 
the light and struck a motorcyclist, who was 
heading westbound on Holly Hall. 
The motorcyclist had a green light, police 
believe. 
The suspect, who was believed to be in a 
white or light color vehicle, briefly stopped but 
then sped away. 
The motorcyclist died at the scene. 
On March 30, 2019, in the city of Houston, 
at the intersection of North Shepherd Drive 
and West 10th Street, located in the 18th Con-
gressional District of Texas, Lesha White, 54, 
was driving with her daughters when she saw 
Jesus ‘‘Jesse’’ Perez struggling to cross the 
intersection in a wheelchair. 
Ms. White pulled over and got out of her car 
to help Mr. Perez cross the street when an-
other vehicle struck them, and they were both 
killed. 
On March 7, 2019, 23-year-old David Leon 
Loya was killed in a collision with a school bus 
while riding his bicycle in The Heights area of 
Houston. 
Police report that Mr. Loya was in the bike 
lane and tried to avoid the accident by sliding 
under the bus, but unfortunately, he was run 
over by the back axle. 
This young man was greatly loved by his 
family and is missed by the people he helped 
through his volunteer work, and the bicyclist 
community. 
I offer this amendment in remembrance of 
Lesha White, Jesus ‘‘Jesse’’ Perez, David 
Leon Loya, and all of the other pedestrians 
and bicyclists who have lost their lives in acci-
dents with motor vehicles in urban areas. 
In the past sixteen years, the Houston area 
has seen 2,000 deaths of bicyclists and pe-
destrians, at an average of 100 a year, with 
the last three years seeing the rate increase to 
150 a year, according to federal statistics. 
In 2017, the most recent year for which 
comprehensive statistics are available, accord-
ing to the Texas Department of Transportation 
(‘‘TDOT’’), the numbers were no more encour-
aging. 
According to TDOT, 1,409 Houston-area pe-
destrians were injured in roadways crashes: 
1. 275 of them were injured seriously; 
2. 146 pedestrians were killed in roadways 
crashes; 
3. 639 bicyclists were injured in roadways 
crashes; and 
4. 82 bicyclists were injured seriously. 
The National Highway Traffic Safety Admin-
istration has called the number of deaths a’’ 
public health crisis.’’ 
The problem is no more encouraging on the 
national level, as Texas ranks third nationwide 
in bicycle deaths, behind California and Flor-
ida. 
Nationwide, the number of fatal bicyclist ac-
cidents is rising and are also amounting to a 
greater percentage of total traffic fatalities. 
Cities are uniquely susceptible to this prob-
lem, as the National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration reports that 70 percent of bicy-
cle fatalities occur in cities. 
The Jackson Lee Amendment amends Sec-
tion 12020 of the Water Quality Protection and 
Job Creation Act of 2021, which is Division H 
of Rules Committee Print 117–9, and requires 
the EPA Administrator to initiate a study on 
the distribution of wastewater infrastructure 
funds to rural communities, economically dis-
advantaged communities, and Tribal commu-
nities during the 20 fiscal years preceding the 
date of enactment of this Act. 
Among other things, the legislation requires 
that in conducting this study, the EPA Admin-
istrator: 
1. consult with other Federal agencies, 
State, local, and Tribal governments, owners 
and operators of publicly owned treatment 
works, and stakeholder organizations; 
2. undertake at least one public meeting in 
a rural community, in an economically dis-
advantaged community, and in a Tribal com-
munity, to receive testimony from the public; 
3. examine whether the distribution of 
wastewater infrastructure funds during the pe-
riod covered by the study has been in accord-
ance with any applicable executive order or 
policy regarding environmental justice; and 
4. examine how wastewater infrastructure 
funds have been distributed with respect to 
the identified needs of rural communities, eco-
nomically disadvantaged communities, and 
Tribal communities, and whether such funds 
have addressed the needs of such commu-
nities equitably. 
These are all laudable requirements; the 
Jackson Lee Amendment goes a step further 
and adds a fifth requirement that the EPA Ad-
ministrator endeavor to calculate, measure,

and ‘‘document the harm and injury caused by 
any identified inequities in the distribution of 
wastewater infrastructure funds with respect to 
the identified needs of rural communities, eco-
nomically disadvantaged communities, and 
Tribal communities.’’ 
The events of the past year have laid bare 
for the nation and world the systemic inequal-
ities that unfortunately still exist in too many 
sectors of American life, including the health 
care, education, and criminal justice systems, 
housing patterns, and environmental quality of 
life. 
The path-breaking 2019 study and report, 
‘‘Flushed 
and 
Forgotten: 
Sanitation 
and 
Wastewater in the Rural United States,’’ con-
ducted by the Alabama Center for Rural Enter-
prise (ACRE), the Columbia Law School 
Human Rights Clinic, and the Institute for the 
Study of Human Rights at Columbia University 
concluded: 
Sanitation is essential to everyday functions 
such as urination and defecation. Without a 
system in place to dispose of wastewater, indi-
viduals experience environmental contamina-
tion and health risks. Common risks include 
infections such as hookworm and other trop-
ical diseases that were thought to be eradi-
cated in the United States. These can have 
serious impacts on health, including develop-
ment, pregnancy, and reproductive capacity. 
The perpetual appearance of wastewater in 
and around homes that occur when systems 
are absent or failing, takes a significant toll on 
mental health and the ability of individuals to 
live with dignity. 
These communities do not have the luxury 
to flush and forget as raw sewage backs up 
into their yards and homes. 
A lack of adequate sanitation can also per-
petuate cycles of poverty and marginalization 
through negative impacts on health, education, 
and employment. 
The burden for improving sanitation systems 
currently rests primarily on homeowners, who 
receive little government support. 
Securing sanitation can be costly, especially 
for individuals who lack access to central 
wastewater systems. 
Further, in some jurisdictions, failure to com-
ply with sanitation 1 regulations leads to fines 
and criminal records, in effect criminalizing 
poverty. 
This criminalization compounds the chal-
lenges already faced by individuals living in 
poverty. 
Jackson Lee Amendment No. 15 requires 
the EPA Administrator to document identified 
results from disparate treatment in the distribu-
tion of wastewater funding to rural areas and 
communities of color. 
We cannot begin to pursue and implement 
effective measures to ameliorate the damage 
caused until we know the extent of the injury, 
which is the purpose of the Jackson Lee 
Amendment. 
My next amendment to RCP 117–9 directs 
the EPA Administrator to establish and imple-
ment a program under which the Administrator 
may award grants to community water sys-
tems to carry out activities to educate and as-
sist persons served by the community water 
system in adapting and responding to malevo-
lent acts and natural hazards, including sub- 
zero temperatures, that disrupt the provision of 
safe drinking water or significantly affect the 
public health or the safety or supply of drink-
ing water provided to communities and individ-
uals. 
This past February, a historic cold outbreak 
led in the coldest air in decades across the 
United States, reaching all the way to the Rio 
Grande and bringing record amounts of snow 
and ice to the Deep South. 
Over 154 million people, or roughly half the 
population of the country, were in subfreezing 
temperatures. 
1. Dallas dipped to 5 degrees Fahrenheit, 
the coldest temperature the city has seen 
since 1989. 
2. Oklahoma City hit 6 degrees below zero, 
the city’s coldest temperature since 1989, and 
the wind chill reached a record 29 degrees 
below zero. 
3. Austin and San Antonio in Texas both 
had single-digit temperatures for the first time 
since 1989. 
4. Corpus Christi, Texas, dipped down to 17 
degrees, the coldest it’s been there since 
1989. 
5. Rapid City, South Dakota has had five 
consecutive nights of 12 degrees below zero. 
The last time this happened was in 1943. 
6. The wind chill dipped to 32 degrees 
below zero in Kansas City, Missouri, the low-
est since 1989. 
7. Monday’s high of 3 degrees below zero 
and a low of 21 degrees below zero was the 
coldest day in Omaha, Nebraska, in 25 years. 
Texas power providers, Electric Reliability 
Council of Texas (ERCOT), and Entergy Cor-
poration, did not provide the needed weather-
ization of power generating and delivery 
equipment after being warned in 2011 after a 
cold snap that the system would fail if these 
steps where not taken. 
What made matters worse was the Texas 
electric grid was not connected to neighboring 
electric grids so that it could take power from 
other electricity generating sources onto the 
Texas grid to heat homes or businesses. 
Today, too many families mourn the loss of 
a loved one, including the mother of 11-year- 
old Cristian Pineda, after he and his family 
were trapped in their mobile home for two 
days without electricity. 
Nearly 8.8 million people—approximately a 
third of the state’s total population—still expe-
rienced water disruptions on Sunday evening, 
according to the Texas Commission on Envi-
ronmental Quality. 
The disruptions impacted more than 1,200 
public water systems in 199 counties in the 
state, and about 147 public water systems 
serving ‘‘just under’’ 120,000 people were non-
operational. 
Active duty troops from Fort Hood, Texas, 
helped to provide clean water to local inmates 
at jails in several towns in Texas that were 
struggling to restore water supplies in the 
wake of the extremely cold weather, and the 
Texas Agriculture Commissioner announced 
that grocery stores were unable to get ship-
ments of some products, and severe weather 
conditions had created a ‘‘food supply chain 
problem like we’ve never seen before, even 
with Covid–19.’’ 
No one was prepared for five days of sub-
freezing temperatures, ice and snow-covered 
roads, and a failed energy grid throughout the 
state of Texas. 
That is why Jackson Lee Amendment No. 
18 is necessary; to ensure that should we ex-
perience another once-in-a-century ice storm 
like we did earlier this year, that Americans 
will be prepared to ride it out without unneces-
sary loss of life and minimal economic and 
physical damage. 
I thank the Rules Committee for making the 
Jackson Lee Amendments in order and Chair-
man DeFazio for including them in the Chair’s 
En Bloc Amendment, and I urge all Members 
to vote for the Amendment and the underlying 
legislation, the Invest in America Act of 2021. 
Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, how 
much time do I have remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlemen from North Carolina has 61⁄2 
minutes remaining. The gentlewoman 
from Kansas has 4 minutes remaining. 
Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. DAVIDS of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. GREEN). 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to thank Chairperson DEFA-
ZIO for his leadership on this issue of 
importance to all Americans. I espe-
cially want to thank the staff for being 
people with great integrity. They are 
honorable people. With them, we can 
do great things. Without them, we can 
do very little. 
Mr. Speaker, there is no national 
drinking water standard for chromium- 
6. The American Cancer Society lists 
chromium-6 as a known and probable 
human carcinogen. 
Mr. Speaker, there are an estimated 
200 
million 
Americans 
exposed 
to 
drinking water with unsafe levels of 
chromium-6. 
This 
amendment, 
if 
passed, will require the EPA to estab-
lish national standards for chromium- 
6. Lives will be saved, and the Amer-
ican people will be in a better place. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank, again, Mr. 
DEFAZIO for his efforts. I also would 
like to thank Debbie Strauss at KPRC 
Channel 2 for calling this issue to my 
attention. 
Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. GIBBS). 
Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, Americans 
depend on basic infrastructure to get 
to work and go about their daily lives, 
but our infrastructure is crumbling. 
The majority’s bill proposes spending 
$715 billion over 5 years to make a 
transformational investment in our in-
frastructure, including more than $109 
billion on transit. That is an extraor-
dinary amount, especially after all the 
relief we have provided transit agen-
cies over the last year, nearly $70 bil-
lion in total. 
b 2240 
For now, let’s ignore the fact that 
none of this bill is paid for, because in-
stead of concentrating our taxpayer re-
sources on real infrastructure, the ma-
jority thinks we have the luxury of 
spending these resources on art, sculp-
tures, and nonfunctional landscaping. 
Mr. Speaker, I don’t know how many 
times we have to say that art is not in-
frastructure. It does not provide mobil-
ity. It doesn’t get you to work or to the 
store. Our limited resources for trans-
portation should not be wasted on art. 
That is why this body in the FAST Act 
put in place a bipartisan ban to prevent 
wasting our valuable transportation 
dollars on nonfunctional art.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3574 
June 30, 2021 
Interestingly, it seems that some on 
the other side still agree. Just a few 
hours ago, the Democratic leadership 
tried to allow a vote on restoring this 
commonsense ban but failed. This was 
an interesting development, particu-
larly since I offered an amendment 
during the committee markup 3 weeks 
ago to ensure we keep the ban in place. 
Of course, given this partisan process, 
the majority voted against my com-
mittee amendment. 
Throughout this whole process, the 
majority has turned its back on bipar-
tisanship 
and 
commonsense. 
My 
amendment now will keep in place 2015 
the protection against wasting trans-
portation money on art. We simply 
can’t afford to decorate the walls when 
the house is crumbling. We shouldn’t 
be putting art before the horse. It 
doesn’t even pass the laugh test that 
the majority continues to defend this 
policy. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent to include the text of the amend-
ment in the RECORD immediately prior 
to the vote on the motion to recommit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Ohio? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. DAVIDS of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Michigan (Ms. STEVENS). 
Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the vice chair of the Transportation 
and Infrastructure Committee from the 
State of Kansas. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the 
INVEST in America Act which author-
izes billions of dollars in direct infra-
structure investment over the next 5 
years to address America’s crumbling 
wastewater and local water quality 
challenges—something we know all too 
well in Michigan, particularly in the 
wake of our communities being deluged 
by storms and deluged by wastewater 
coming up into our roads and into peo-
ple’s homes. 
Less than 50 years ago, many U.S. 
rivers were little more than open sew-
ers with some so polluted that they lit-
erally caught fire—something that, yet 
again, motivated Members of Congress 
from Michigan to enact landmark leg-
islation. But even today, communities 
are struggling. 
For instance, for decades, to this day, 
residents of Centreville, Illinois, a 
nearly all Black town of 5,000 in south-
ern Illinois, just a 12-minute drive from 
downtown East St. Louis, had been 
dealing with persistent flooding and 
sewage overflows. 
The smell of it is in the air and all 
over the town after a rain, and bits of 
soggy toilet paper and slicks of human 
waste cling to the grass in the neigh-
borhoods where children used to play 
on warm days. 
This, Mr. Speaker, is why we commit 
to an infrastructure bill because we are 
standing for the guarantee that every-
one deserves to live safely and in clean 
environments. 
With that, Mr. Speaker, I urge my 
colleagues to support this bipartisan 
bill that will get us the wastewater 
spend and make our country great. 
Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, if I could 
inquire how much time I have remain-
ing. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from North Carolina has 41⁄2 
minutes remaining. The gentlewoman 
from Kansas has 1 minute remaining. 
Mr. ROUZER. Inquiry to the other 
side: Does the gentlewoman have other 
speakers as well? 
Ms. DAVIDS of Kansas. No, I do not, 
Mr. Speaker, and I am prepared to 
close. 
Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. DAVIDS of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, 
I urge my colleagues to support these 
amendments en bloc, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, I have 
listened to the debate today, and it is 
a real shame that a surface reauthor-
ization bill and a wastewater reauthor-
ization bill have to be partisan. They 
shouldn’t be partisan. We wanted a bi-
partisan process, but that is not what 
we got. And here we are today. In fact, 
we probably could have avoided even en 
bloc amendments had we had the op-
portunity to have a bipartisan process. 
But that is not the path, unfortu-
nately, that our friends in the majority 
chose to take; and that, Mr. Speaker, is 
quite regretful. It is regretful in a 
number of ways, but most regretful for 
the great citizens of this country. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
oppose this amendment, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in strong support of the Invest in America 
Act. I thank Chairman DEFAZIO and Chairman 
PALLONE, among others, for their outstanding 
work in getting this bill to the floor. 
I appreciate their support for my amend-
ments to this bill. 
On the water portion of this bill, my three 
amendments attempt to: 
(1) spur innovation to help address storm 
water challenges 
(2) link efforts to remove lead pipes to cre-
ating jobs for low-income and very low-income 
individuals where these projects take place, 
and 
(3) strengthen an existing water workforce 
development program. 
I have spoken directly to both Chairman 
DEFAZIO and Chairman PALLONE about the 
need to link investments in water infrastructure 
to jobs for those in affected communities, es-
pecially for underserved communities. So I am 
excited to have their support, both through 
provisions including in the underlying bill, and 
for my amendments. 
Every $1 billion invested in water infrastruc-
ture creates or sustains approximately 28,000 
American jobs. I want to make sure that those 
in communities where these projects take 
place directly benefit from this job creation. 
Likewise, the new regional stormwater cen-
ters of excellence will help support research 
into new and emerging technologies that can 
help to meet stormwater needs in our commu-
nities, such as stopping sewer overflows. 
I thank both Chairs for working with me on 
these amendments and their inclusion in this 
strong bill and urge my colleagues to vote for 
this measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 504, the pre-
vious 
question 
is 
ordered 
on 
the 
amendments en bloc offered by the 
gentlewoman from Kansas (Ms. DA-
VIDS). 
The question is on the amendments 
en bloc. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, on that I

ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution

SEC. 12022. RULEMAKING ON CLIMATE RESIL-
IENCY. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 18 months 
after the date of enactment of this section, 
the Administrator of the Environmental 
Protection Agency, after notice and oppor-
tunity for public comment, shall issue such 
regulations as are necessary to require that 
an applicant for wastewater infrastructure 
funds— 
(1) undertake an assessment of the poten-
tial impacts of climate change on the project 
or activity for which such funds are sought; 
and 
(2) where appropriate, incorporate meas-
ures to avoid, minimize, or mitigate such po-
tential impacts into the design of such 
project or activity. 
(b) CONSIDERATIONS.—In issuing regula-
tions under subsection (a)(1), the Adminis-
trator shall consider requiring varying levels 
of assessments that reflect the scale or type 
of the project or activity for which waste-
water infrastructure funds are sought. 
(c) 
CONSULTATION; 
TECHNICAL
ASSIST-
ANCE.—In carrying out the rulemaking re-
quired under subsection (a), the Adminis-
trator shall— 
(1) consult with other Federal and State 
agencies, 
municipalities, 
Tribal 
govern-
ments, owners and operators of publicly 
owned treatment works, and other stake-
holders with experience in addressing poten-
tial impacts of climate change on projects 
and activities eligible for wastewater infra-
structure funds; and 
(2) identify entities to provide technical 
assistance to applicants for wastewater in-
frastructure funds to assist such applicants 
in incorporating the climate resilience meas-
ures described under subsection (a)(2). 
(d) DEFINITIONS.—In this section: 
(1) IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE.—The term 
‘‘impacts of climate change’’ includes ob-
served changes to temperature, precipitation 
patterns, drought, storms, flooding, and sea 
level rise that may adversely impact the 
continued safe and reliable operation of a 
treatment works.

and ‘‘treatment works’’ have the meaning 
given such terms in section 502 of the Fed-
eral Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 
1362). 
(3) WASTEWATER INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDS.— 
The term ‘‘wastewater infrastructure funds’’ 
means funds made available for projects or 
activities under or pursuant to— 
(A) title VI of the Federal Water Pollution 
Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1381 et seq.); 
(B) section 122 of the Federal Water Pollu-
tion Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1274); 
(C) section 220 of the Federal Water Pollu-
tion Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1300); and 
(D) section 221 of the Federal Water Pollu-
tion Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1301). 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 508, the gen-
tlewoman from Nevada (Mrs. LEE) and 
a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Nevada. 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong 
support of my amendment No. 132 to 
the INVEST in America Act which 
would ensure that wastewater infra-
structure funding using the Clean 
Water State Revolving Fund or other 
Clean Water Act grant programs under-
go a climate resiliency assessment. 
Today, 88 percent of the West is 
under some form of drought. Back in 
my home district, Nevada’s Third, the 
water in Lake Mead sits at the lowest 
level since the Hoover Dam was built. 
Almost half of my home State of Ne-
vada 
is 
experiencing 
exceptional 
drought—the 
highest 
classification 
there is. 
As I stand here today, the unfortu-
nate truth is that this is not just a Ne-
vada problem. From coast to coast, cli-
mate change is here—it is not some 
distant threat—and it demands that we 
take action for all of our constituents. 
Investments in infrastructure are 
desperately needed, and we need to en-
sure that these projects can withstand 
the impact of climate change. We can-
not talk about infrastructure without 
talking about climate change, because 
what good is it for us to invest millions 
or billions in infrastructure if it can’t 
hold up to the devastating impact of 
climate change? 
For example, we should be looking at 
how a water treatment facility would 
withstand extreme heat, because the 
reality is, as we have experienced, tem-
peratures are rising. Just look at the 
West right now. So as we are making 
investments in water treatment facili-
ties, we must ensure that these facili-
ties will not fail under extreme heat, 
straining already limited water re-
sources. 
A 
climate 
resiliency 
assessment 
might look at what happens when it is 
120 degrees and the wastewater facility 
loses power during a blackout. We need 
to ensure that our facilities are pre-
pared for the realities that we are fac-
ing. That is true whether we are talk-
ing about drought and extreme heat or 
worsening hurricanes or even rising sea 
levels along the coast. 
My amendment will ensure that fu-
ture wastewater infrastructure is de-
signed and constructed to withstand 
potential impacts of climate change. 
Importantly, my amendment also is in 
line with a January 2020 report on 
water infrastructure from the non-
partisan Government Accountability 
Office. This nonpartisan report rec-
ommended that Congress require that 
climate resilience be considered in 
planning for federally funded water in-
frastructure projects. 
So I am implore all of you to join me 
in voting ‘‘yes’’ on my amendment. We 
must ensure that our investments in 
infrastructure are longlasting and re-
silient to the threat of climate change. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
b 2250 
Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
opposition to the amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from North Carolina is recog-
nized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
opposition to Lee amendment No. 132. 
This amendment would require that 
any applicant for wastewater infra-
structure funds undertake an assess-
ment regarding the potential impacts 
of climate change on the project and to 
adjust that project accordingly. 
Well, that sounds well and good, but 
this layers a new Federal mandate on 
top of the multitude of Federal regula-
tions that are already being imposed 
on States, Tribes, and local govern-
ments in order to maintain their 
wastewater infrastructure and serve 
their communities. 
A one-size-fits-all regulation like 
this will create more process and in-
crease project costs, but not add any 
more protection for projects, the envi-
ronment or the climate. 
States, Tribes, and local govern-
ments are already incorporating resil-
iency into their infrastructure project 
planning and implementation. This is 
not 1960. 
For example, the State revolving 
loan fund programs already fund a wide 
range of projects to add resiliency and 
climate 
change. 
That 
makes 
this 
amendment unnecessarily redundant 
and an impediment for communities 
looking to upgrade their wastewater 
infrastructure. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
oppose this amendment, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to address a couple of points 
that were raised. 
First of all, if these requirements 
were already being met, I don’t under-
stand why the GAO, in 2020, rec-
ommended that any investment in fed-
erally funded infrastructure should un-
dergo such an assessment. 
Secondly, in terms of the burden, we 
have added language to this amend-
ment to make it not a one-size-fits-all. 
In fact, it will only require assessment 
when appropriate for the project. 
It will consider varying levels of as-
sessments that reflect the scale, or the 
type of the project, or activity for 
which the infrastructure funds are 
sought; and it will identify entities to 
provide technical assistance to appli-
cants for wastewater infrastructure 
funds to assist them. This is particu-
larly geared toward smaller invest-
ments. 
Finally, with respect to this amend-
ment being unnecessary, I say just 
look around this country at what is 
happening. I mean, we want to be fis-
cally responsible, and I don’t think we 
want to make investments to know 
that in 3 or 5 years, or even 1 year, 
they are rendered unusable because of 
climate change. 
So this, in fact, is a most necessary 
amendment, and we are feeling the im-
pacts of climate change right now, and 
the time is now to provide these assess-
ments. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, in my 
past career, I have served as a senior 
staffer in the U.S. Senate, under 
George W. Bush during his administra-
tion, as a member of the State legisla-
ture, and now as a Member of Congress. 
It is interesting to me that—and I have 
never quite understood this, but our 
friends on the other side of the aisle 
seem to think that Washington knows 
best about everything. 
Our local communities, our States, 
our local partners, they know what 
they are doing. Let’s give them the 
flexibility. Let’s let them do what they 
need to do for their communities. 
Climate change is not a new notion. 
It has been around for a little while. 
You have got a lot of States and a lot 
of folks in private enterprise, in fact, 
that are incorporating changes, not at 
the request of Washington, but because 
that is what they feel like they need to 
do. 
We don’t need a one-size-fits-all ap-
proach for any of this. In fact, a lot of 
this could have been worked out, had 
we had a bipartisan open process, but 
we didn’t. 
Mr. Speaker, that is regrettable. I en-
courage my colleagues to oppose this 
amendment, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, 
how much time do I have remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman has 30 seconds remaining. 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I 
will just, again, reiterate that most 
importantly about this amendment is 
it does address local needs. Specifi-
cally, we included language in this to 
allow for local entities. But most im-
portantly, they are accessing Federal 
dollars. So with Federal dollars, I 
think we need to put some safeguards 
to make sure that that investment will 
withstand 
the 
impact 
of 
climate 
change that we are seeing all across 
this country. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3576 
June 30, 2021 
Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, how 
much time do I have remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from North Carolina has 2 min-
utes remaining. 
Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, again, we 
have had the opportunity here tonight 
and before to have a very open bipar-
tisan process. And that is not what we 
have had, and that is quite regrettable. 
It is regrettable from not only a stand-
point of this institution, but it is re-
grettable for the American people. 
You know, all the proven successful 
surface 
reauthorization 
bills 
and 
wastewater reauthorization bills, they 
went through a thorough bipartisan 
process. That is not what we have had. 
Instead, we have just had lip service. 
When House Republicans held the 
majority, we led every successful bi-
partisan effort in the last 30 years to 
reauthorize surface transportation pro-
grams. 
However, this time around, there has 
been little opportunity for meaningful 
input from the minority, and this en 
bloc process just continues down that 
same road. 
Look no further than the number of 
Democrat amendments that we have 
considered today, many of which have 
not been subjected to the scrutiny of a 
standalone vote or debate. More than 
100 Democrat amendments have been 
approved by the Rules Committee, 
while less than 30 Republican amend-
ments have been made in order. 
The majority argues they are moving 
this through regular order and pro-
viding both sides with the opportunity 
to offer amendments. That is not true. 
Both sides should be appalled that 
this en bloc takes away from our indi-
vidual right to speak on these indi-
vidual 
amendments 
and 
randomly 
groups them with other items with 
zero input given to the amendments’ 
sponsor. It is all just a partisan move 
meant to further suppress the minori-
ty’s rights to fairly represent their 
constituents. 
I think we can all agree that every 
Member deserves an opportunity to be 
heard on these amendments. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to vote against this amend-
ment, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 504, the pre-
vious 
question 
is 
ordered 
on 
the 
amendment offered by the gentle-
woman from Nevada (Mrs. LEE). 
The question is on the amendment. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this question are 
postponed. 
Pursuant to clause 1(c) of rule XIX, 
further consideration of the bill (H.R. 
3684) to authorize funds for Federal-aid 
highways, highway safety programs, 
and transit programs, and for other 
purposes, is postponed.

ELECTING A MEMBER TO A CER-
TAIN STANDING COMMITTEE OF 
THE 
HOUSE 
OF 
REPRESENTA-
TIVES 
Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, by direc-
tion of the House Republican Con-
ference, I send to the desk a privileged 
resolution and ask for its immediate 
consideration. 
The Clerk read the resolution, as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 511 
Resolved That the following named Member 
be, and hereby, elected to the following 
standing committee of the House of Rep-
resentatives: 
COMMITTEE ON FINANCIAL SERVICES: 
Mr. Sessions (to rank immediately after Mr. 
Lucas). 
The resolution was agreed to. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
STATUS OF THE HYDE 
AMENDMENT 
(Mr. BURCHETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker, Joe 
Biden’s budget request is troubling for 
many reasons. Today, I want to focus 
on how the President is weaponizing 
his budget to the left’s anti-life agenda. 
In his fiscal year 2022 budget, Presi-
dent Biden has called on Congress to 
eliminate the Hyde amendment, which 
Biden used to support when he was in 
the United States Senate. 
The Hyde amendment is common-
sense policy that has stood for decades. 
It would be wrong to force pro-life 
Americans to fund abortions against 
their moral will. 
Mr. Speaker, abortion goes directly 
against the Catholic Church’s teach-
ings, but Joe Biden, a Catholic himself, 
has embraced abortion. 
I applaud the United States Con-
ference of Catholic Bishops for sticking 
to their guns about the church’s prin-
ciples. On June 18, the organization 
condemned President Biden’s assault 
on right to life by overwhelmingly vot-
ing to deny him communion. 
Eliminating the Hyde amendment 
would be a death sentence for millions 
of unborn Americans, Mr. Speaker. 
Being anti-life is now the price of ad-
mission into today’s Democratic Party, 
but Joe Biden knows deep down this 
isn’t right. 
The President needs to buck his par-
ty’s radical base on this issue and ditch 
his plans to scrap the Hyde amend-
ment. 
Mr. President, get back to your roots 
from when you were a Senator. Make 
the right decision and protect the lives 
of the unborn.

HONORING THE LIFE OF RODNEY 
ARDELL WELLS 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 30, 2021 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Rodney Ardell Wells. Rodney 
passed away on December 8, 2020. Rodney 
was a veteran of the United States Navy, a fa-
ther, grandfather, friend, and a husband to his 
best friend, Sherril. 
Rodney was born on July 26, 1955 in To-
peka, Kansas and was raised in Compton, 
California. As he got older, Rodney had the 
urge to serve the United States Navy. From 
1973 to 2003, Rodney served active duty for 
more than 20 of those years, at sea. 
After serving in the Navy 12 years as Com-
mand Master Chief on the USS Shiloh, USS 
Pearl Harbor, and Chief of the Boat on the 
USS Pogy, Rodney attended college. He grad-
uated with a degree in Mechanized Agriculture 
and a B.S. in psychology from Reedley Col-
lege. 
Rodney worked at the Veterans Affairs Cen-
tral California Health Care System in Fresno, 
California as a Boiler Plant Operator. Rodney 
was liked by all of the people he had the 
pleasure of meeting. He was a leader, wise, 
and a caring individual who was ready to help. 
Rodney continued his giving back to the com-
munity through helping other veterans like 
himself at the hospital, but as well as helped 
to grow food. 
When he was not working at the hospital, 
Rodney would grow seasonal varieties of 
fruits, herbs, and vegetables. Rancho de Rod-
ney founded in 2009, grew heirloom and cher-
ry tomatoes, hot and sweet peppers, carrots, 
thyme, sage, radishes, and more. In 2014 
Rancho de Rodney was certified as organic by 
the CCOF. He participated in farmers’ markets 
at Fresno Kaiser, True Value Hardware in 
Oakhurst 
and 
the 
Peddler’s 
Corner 
in 
Coarsegold. 
As time went on, Rodney changed focus. 
They were growing food not to sell, but for do-
nation. A disabled veteran owned business, 
Rodney and his wife Sherril moved towards a 
non-profit status. Their love for their commu-
nity and those in need were evident. They 
were known to help St. Benedict Catholic 
Worker on distributing their fresh produce to 
families and individuals. Rodney was also in-
volved with African American Farmers of Cali-
fornia headquartered in Fresno. Before his 
passing, Rodney spent his last Saturday with 
his fellow veterans at the African American 
Farmers of California demonstration site work-
ing on the vegetables he grew for the Catholic 
Worker. 
Rodney was a proud descendent of mem-
bers of the Civil War’s U.S. Colored Troops 
and the Cherokee Freedom. He was a friend 
to many in his life and evolved his passion to 
giving back to others with his wife by his side. 
He is survived by his wife, Sherril, sister 
Deborah, daughter Charletha Harris, grand-
children and greatgranddaughter. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the life of Rodney Ardell Wells. 
His service and contributions to the nations 
and State of California will be missed. I join 
his family and friends in celebrating Rodney’s 
life.

REMEMBERING MARILYNN JANINE 
DENHOLM 
HON. TIM RYAN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 30, 2021 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise to honor 
the life of Marilynn Janine Denholm, originally 
of Niles, Ohio, who passed away on Thursday, 
June 24 at the age of 71. 
She was born in 1950, the daughter of Fred 
and Mary (Colla) Guerra. Marilynn was mar-
ried to her husband Dave for nearly 45 years. 
She had 3 children, 5 grandchildren, and ex-
tended family and friends with whom she cher-
ished spending time. 
Marilynn grew up in Niles, Ohio, and grad-
uated from Niles McKinley High School in 
1968. She earned her BA in Elementary Edu-
cation from Youngstown State University 
(YSU) in 1972 where she was also a member 
of the Zeta Tau Alpha (ZTA) sorority. She 
earned her MA in Guidance and Counseling 
from YSU in 1978. Marilynn spent 13 years in 
education in Ohio and 30 years in education 
in Gaston County, NC. Mrs. Denholm loved 
being a Guidance Counselor at Gardner Park 
Elementary where she was able to help thou-
sands of children. 
Marilynn was an active member of the ZTA 
Alumni group and recently received her 50- 
year alumni pin. She also volunteered with the 
Blumenthal Performing Arts for 20 years. 
Survivors include her husband, David; chil-
dren Kristine (Seth Thompson) of Phoenix, 
AZ; David (Nichole) of Merritt Island, FL; and 
Victoria of Madrid, Spain; grandchildren David, 
Hannah, William and Henry Denholm, and 
Nora Thompson; and brother Fred (Gretchen) 
Guerra of Cuyahoga Falls, OH. Her parents 
Fred and Mary Guerra preceded her in death. 
I am honored to have called Marilynn my 
Godmother. She was an incredible woman 
that dedicated her life to helping others, and I 
was lucky enough to have personally known 
how truly kind her spirit was. Throughout her 
life as an educator, she touched countless 
lives of the children that she taught. My con-
dolences go out to her family and friends. She 
will be dearly missed. 
INTRODUCING THE INVESTING IN 
COMMONSENSE BALLISTIC MIS-
SILES (ICBM) ACT OF 2021 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 30, 2021 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, the In-
vesting in Commonsense Ballistic Missiles 
(ICBM) Act of 2021 bill will pause the develop-
ment of the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent 
(GBSD) Intercontinental Ballistic Missile pro-
gram, the planned replacement to the current 
Minuteman III missile, and the associated 
W87–1 nuclear warhead. Additionally, it re-
quires the service life of the currently deployed 
Minuteman III missiles to be extended until 
2040—something that is both technically fea-
sible and more cost-efficient. 
The world is witnessing a new nuclear arms 
race, and this one is extremely dangerous as 
tensions rise between the Great Powers. As 
the United States, Russia, and China rush to 
modernize their nuclear arsenals, the trip wire 
is growing more taut. Observation and com-
munication satellites and systems are increas-
ingly vulnerable to attacks. All three countries 
are fielding stealth and hypersonic nuclear de-
livery systems designed to evade detection. 
The risk of a false alarm or a political mis-
calculation has always haunted the nuclear 
landscape and they do even more today. 
As long as nuclear weapons exist we must 
have a safe, secure, and effective nuclear de-
terrent. The simultaneous modernization ef-
forts across all three legs of the nuclear triad 
are an unnecessary and costly way to achieve 
our deterrent. The modernization includes the 
Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD), 
the B–21 bomber, the Columbia-class sub-
marine, the Long-Range Standoff (LRSO) air- 
launched cruise missile, the sea launched nu-
clear cruise missile, and new nuclear war-
heads. The costs are extraordinary: a 2017 
Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report es-
timated that the 30-year cost of nuclear weap-
ons spending would be $1.2 trillion ($1.7 tril-
lion adjusted for inflation). As the Government 
Accountability Office recently noted, the cur-
rent plan to modernize every part of the arse-
nal at the same time is a recipe for schedule 
delays and cost overruns. 
The ICBM leg of the Triad deserves special 
attention. The total price tag to procure the 
GBSD is projected to be at least $95 billion, 
and $264 billion when accounting for total life- 
cycle costs. A GBSD pause will help defray 
short-term costs for the Air Force and will also 
defer a long-term expenditure. Additionally, the 
W87–1, the warhead that is being designed 
for the GBSD, will cost at least $12 billion to 
build—and is not part of the estimated GBSD 
procurement cost of $95 billion. To build new 
warhead cores for the W87–1, the National 
Nuclear Security Agency (NNSA) is expanding 
plutonium pit production, which will cost at 
least another $9 billion through the late 2020s 
according to the Congressional Budget Office.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E720 
June 30, 2021 
We do not need a new ICBM to provide a 
robust deterrence. The existing MMIII can 
serve until 2040 with one more life extension, 
which is technically feasible. Lieutenant Gen-
eral Richard M. Clark, then-Air Force Deputy 
Chief of Staff for Strategic Deterrence and Nu-
clear Integration, noted in testimony before the 
Committee on Armed Services of the House of 
Representatives that we have ‘‘one more op-
portunity’’ to conduct life extension on the Min-
uteman III intercontinental ballistic missile, in-
dicating the technical feasibility of extending 
the Minuteman III missile. 
Other independent experts have confirmed 
the feasibility of a MMIII life extension. In fact, 
the Air Force intends to do just that. It will up-
grade and extend the life of existing MMIII 
missiles while it is replacing others with the 
GBSD. The swap out plan is an admission 
that the life extension is not only possible but 
has already been factored into the existing 
plan. 
Maintaining and upgrading the current Min-
uteman III missile is technically possible, and 
according to a 2017 CBO report, it would cost 
$37 billion less than developing and deploying 
the GBSD through 2036. 
Budget analysts who watch Pentagon budg-
ets have warned that an unaffordable ‘‘bow 
wave’’ would occur as the Pentagon plans to 
upgrade every weapon system at the same 
time. Former Secretary of the Air Force Heath-
er Wilson noted in December 2020, ‘‘the next 
fiscal year (FY22) will see a steep increase in 
the cost of refurbishing our nuclear deterrent, 
and with a flat budget, the Air Force can’t do 
this without crushing its ability to handle all of 
its other missions.’’ The current leadership of 
the military must answer the question, ‘‘What 
critical weapon, defense system, or benefit for 
the troops and their families could be funded 
with the $37 billion saved by pausing the 
GBSD Missile program?’’ 
Any discussion of the GBSD and the MMIII 
must include the question ‘‘Do we need 
ICBM’s sitting in 400 silos in the upper mid-
west to have an effective deterrent?’’ There is 
a powerful argument that they are not nec-
essary. The bomber fleet, together with Amer-
ica’s Trident II D5 Submarine Launched Bal-
listic Missiles, can deliver several times more 
nuclear bombs to any part of the globe than 
the 400 silo-based ICBM’s. Moreover, it is ar-
gued that the silo-based ICBM’s are inherently 
dangerous because their location is known 
and they must therefore be launched within 
minutes of notification of a nuclear attack or 
be lost to an incoming missile attack. 
In every ICBM silo lies the existential risk of 
a false alarm or a miscalculation. Both have 
happened in the past but fortunately the errors 
were discovered in time to save human life on 
our planet. Bombers can be recalled and subs 
cannot be found as they hide in the oceans, 
thereby providing critical time for a thoughtful 
and fully informed decision before pressing the 
button. 
The ICBM Act bill will strengthen our na-
tional security and save billions of tax-payer 
dollars by: 
Prohibiting the use of funds for the GBSD 
program and W87–1 warhead modification 
program for fiscal years 2022 through 2031; 
Extending the service life of the Minuteman 
III missiles until at least 2040, and requiring 
use of nondestructive testing methods and 
technologies similar to those used by the Navy 
for Trident II D5 SLBMs; and 
Transferring back to the Air Force all unobli-
gated funds for the GBSD program, and trans-
ferring unobligated funds for the W87–1 war-
head modification program from the National 
Nuclear Security Administration to the Treas-
ury. 
I shall end this with a personal memory of 
a visit to a United Kingdom submarine that 
was about to deploy with 16 ICBM’s and mul-
tiple nuclear bombs. The captain took great 
pride in his ship and its role in deterrence. As 
we were leaving the sub I asked him, ‘‘Sup-
pose you are ordered to launch your missiles 
and their nuclear bombs. You follow the order 
and launch your missiles. Then what do you 
do? Go home? To what?’’ He did not reply.

TANEY 
WITH 
BUST OF THURGOOD MARSHALL 
SPEECH OF 
HON. KEVIN HERN 
OF OKLAHOMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 29, 2021 
Mr. HERN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
shed some light on history. 
In 1854, members of the Whig Party met to 
begin discussions on a new political party— 
the primary platform being the abolition of 
slavery. 
The idea spread like wildfire, and just six 
years later, the newly formed Republican 
Party successfully elected their first President, 
Abraham Lincoln. 
Republican leadership fought to eradicate 
the scourge of slavery, defeat the racist 
Southern Democrats, and forge a new future 
for America where all were equal—no matter 
the color of their skin. 
Republicans, as the Speaker of the House 
so eloquently explained earlier, voted to pass 
the 14th amendment to give Black Americans 
the right to vote. Against the will of the Demo-
crats. This history is integral to the discussion 
we’re having today, as the men who fought to 
perpetuate slavery, impose racist policies, and 
oppress newly freed Black Americans were all 
Democrats. 
Now, the Democrats of today don’t want you 
to know that. 
They’ve worked hard to hide their history 
and supplant the accurate story of their party 
with the narrative of the Democratic savior. 
What they’re attempting to do today is further 
bury their racist past and hide it from the 
American people. 
I represent Tulsa, a city that knows some-
thing about Democrats hiding their past. Just 
this month, we observed 100 years since the 
horrific race massacre that destroyed Black 
Wall Street and killed hundreds of Black 
Tulsans. These attacks were orchestrated by 
Oklahoma Democrats and subsequently hid-
den by Oklahoma Democrats for decades, 
until we began to seek out the truth. 
Tulsa no longer hides this shameful part of 
our history. Under Republican leadership, 
Tulsa has worked hard to honor the memories 
of the race massacre victims and share the 
accurate history of the horrific, racist attack 
that took place 100 years ago. 
We are stronger now because of our com-
mitment to shine a light on our history . . . 
even the painful pieces. We do not hide it, ob-
fuscate it, or rewrite it—like my Democratic 
colleagues are attempting to do today. 
There are men on display in the Capitol 
Building who did terrible things. They should 
never have been placed in such positions of 
prominence, but it was Democrat leaders at 
the state level who sent them here. Many 
such states are now working to remove their 
statues under the proper process, led by Re-
publican leaders at the state level. 
Congressional Democrats are attempting to 
usurp the authority given to our states and 
claim it as a moral victory for themselves. 
For the statues and busts under Congres-
sional jurisdiction, I fully support efforts to re-
move terrible men from positions of promi-
nence, but I cannot justify usurping power 
from the states—states that are already work-
ing to rectify the decisions made generations 
ago by racist Democrats. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in opposi-
tion to this bill.

HONORING THE LIFE OF DONALD

HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 30, 2021 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Donald F. Saladino. Donald 
passed away on June 1, 2021. Donald was a 
Veteran of the United States, a loyal family- 
oriented son, a husband, father, grandfather, 
great grandfather, and a friend. 
Donald was born on August 5, 1927 in Fres-
no, California. He spent his youth dedicated to 
the Catholic church, as he attended St. 
Alphonsus Catholic School and served as an 
altar boy. While attending Edison High School, 
he found passion in basketball, where he was 
recruited to play for the New York Knicks. 
However, with his strong family bonds, Donald 
decided to stay at home, where he became a

part of his family’s grocery store as a butcher 
and where he found the love of his life, Anna. 
Donald’s love for family extended to a global 
level where he decided to serve for people 
around him. In 1945, Donald joined the Mer-
chant Marines. In 1946, he was drafted into 
the Army, and while stationed in Berlin, he 
joined the marching band, where they per-
formed for all U.S. dignitaries and service per-
sonnel. In 1951, he joined the Navy Reserves 
where he was discharged in 1955. 
Donald was an outstanding talent in the 
kitchen. Using his family recipes that were 
brought over from the Calabrese region of 
Italy, he began to make their special family 
sausages in 1944. Saladinos Catering was 
created with Anna by his side working just as 
much as Donald did. He connected with the 
San Joaquin Valley through his dishes and by 
providing employment for students from his 
local high school, San Joaquin Memorial. In 
1980, his son Craig, joined the family business 
and to this day, Saladino’s Foodservice has 
continued to have the same quality and stand-
ards set forth by its founders. 
Donald spent his time donating to various 
charities, organizations, and philanthropic pur-
poses. Amongst spending quality time with his 
wife, he enjoyed several activities with his 
family and close friends. Donald had many 
memories in the kitchen and creating dishes 
for his grandchildren and great-grandchildren. 
Ranging from hosting parties, catering events, 
traveling and exploring the world with Anna 
and their close cousins. He loved his family 
and his two children. Donald always reminded 
his family to never forget where they came 
from and how important it was to have strong 
values, ethics and wisdom. He spent his entire 
life fulfilling his family traditions of providing for 
his family through food, well into the last 
weeks of his life. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the life of Donald F. Saladino. 
His service and contributions will be missed. I 
join his family and friends in celebrating 
Donald’s life.

REMEMBERING RICHARD ADAM 
STROMBRES 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 30, 2021 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I would like to include in the RECORD 
the following obituary for Richard Adam 
Stombres. 
Richard Adam Stombres 
September 24, 1936–June 19, 2021 
It is with a heavy heart that we announce 
that Richard A. Stombres passed away at 
Banner Desert Medical Center in Mesa, Ari-
zona on June 19, 2021. He was born on Sep-
tember 24, 1936 in Aurora, Illinois to Adam H. 
Stombres and Frances May Jeffers Stombres. 
The Stombres family, including Richard 
and his younger brother Don, moved from Il-
linois to Phoenix in 1946. His youngest broth-
er Glenn and his sister Patrice were both 
born in Phoenix. Richard graduated from 
West High School in 1954. He attended the 
United States Military Academy at West 
Point, Arizona State University, and Boston 
University where he earned a Bachelor’s and 
a Master’s degree. While he would live in 
many places throughout his life, he always 
considered Arizona to be his home. 
Richard joined the Army in 1961 and faith-
fully served his country for 28 years as an In-
fantry Officer. He was a graduate of the In-
fantry Officer Basic Course, the Ranger 
School, the Airborne Course, the Pathfinder 
Course, the Marine Amphibious Warfare 
School, and the Command and General Staff 
College. 
Lieutenant Stombres was assigned to the 
101st Airborne Division at Fort Campbell, 
Kentucky when he met Vickie M. Hayes 
from Clarksville, Tennessee. They were mar-
ried at Fort Campbell in 1961. Lieutenant 
Stombres was sent to Vietnam in 1963 where 
he served as a Military Advisor to the Army 
of the Republic of Vietnam until July of 1964 
when he was wounded in action. He would go 
on to serve a second tour in Vietnam from 
1967 to 1968 where he was attached to the 
Military 
Assistance 
Command, 
Vietnam 
(MACV). 
Upon his return from Vietnam, Richard 
was stationed at numerous bases around the 
world including Fort Hood, Texas; Fort 
Benning, 
Georgia; 
Fort 
Ord, 
California;

IN RECOGNITION OF DEPUTY JON 
HOLT 
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 30, 2021 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Deputy Jon Holt for his he-
roic actions and continued outstanding serv-
ice. 
Most recently, Deputy Holt has been recog-
nized for his courageous act of heroism in the 
line of duty. Single-handedly, Deputy Holt res-
cued a woman from being crushed and suffo-
cated underneath an overturned car when he 
lifted the vehicle off the trapped woman. Both 
the mother and her child were able to walk 
away from the accident unharmed. 
This was not the first time that Deputy Holt 
has exhibited bravery and commitment to pub-
lic safety. Deputy Holt was also recognized by 
the Greater Hampton Roads Regional Crime 
Line as both the local and regional ‘‘Top Cop’’ 
after rescuing two people trapped in a burning 
house. 
In addition to his eight years with the 
Gloucester County Sheriff’s Department, Dep-
uty Holt served his country in Iraq as a mem-
ber of the Virginia National Guard. In 2007 he 
was severely wounded by an improvised ex-
plosive device while on patrol in Baghdad. Fol-
lowing several years of rehabilitation and after 
medical retirement from the military, Holt 
joined the Sheriff’s Department. 
Currently, Deputy Holt is completing his 
master’s degree in National Security and re-
cently began his assignment with the Glouces-
ter Investigations Unit where he hopes to con-
tinue to serve his country and community. 
Deputy Holt has repeatedly put his own life 
on the line to keep others safe. It is an honor 
to recognize his valiant efforts and know that 
his substantial contribution to law enforcement 
has not gone unnoticed. I commend Deputy 
Jon Holt for his service throughout the years. 
Therefore, Madam Speaker, I ask that you rise 
with me to recognize the brave and humble 
service of Deputy Jon Holt.

RECOGNIZING THE WORK OF 
OPERATION H.O.P.E. 
HON. VERONICA ESCOBAR 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 30, 2021 
Ms. ESCOBAR. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise to recognize the work and service of Op-
eration H.O.P.E. 
Operation H.O.P.E, which stands for Help-
ing Other People Endure, was founded in 
2009 by Angel Gomez, a life-long El Pasoan 
and U.S. Navy veteran. Throughout the 
COVID–19 pandemic, Operation H.O.P.E. has 
provided funeral assistance to over 1,100 fam-
ilies who have lost loved ones. In the wake of 
the August 3, 2019 domestic terrorist attack 
that killed 23 beautiful souls and wounded 
countless others, Operation H.O.P.E. was at 
the center of supporting grieving families who 
lost loved ones. They helped find funeral 
homes for those who were killed and helped 
offset the cost of repatriation of the Mexican 
nationals who died that day. This past Easter, 
they gave away food and Easter baskets to 
over 400 families in need. Whether it is a holi-
day or tragedy, Operation H.O.P.E. is there 
when we need them. 
I am proud to be sharing Operation 
H.O.P.E.’s work today, and am grateful for 
their continued service to our community.

HONORING PAUL DELACRUZ 
MEGIA 
HON. JERRY McNERNEY 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 30, 2021 
Mr. MCNERNEY. Madam Speaker, once 
again, our nation has experienced a mass 
shooting, this time in our own neighborhood. 
The 
deadly 
shooting 
that 
occurred 
on 
Wednesday May 28, 2021 at the Santa Clara 
Valley Transportation Authority too the lives of 
nine individuals. It is with great sadness that 
I share one of those individuals was my con-
stituent, Paul Delacruz Megia. 
Paul Delacruz Megia immigrated to the 
United States from the Philippines at a young 
age and was a resident of Mountain House, 
California. He was a son, brother, husband, 
and father who leaves behind his wife and 
three children. 
Paul joined Valley Transportation Authority 
in 2002 as a bus operator trainee and worked 
his way up to an assistant superintendent in 
service management. His supervisor shared 
that he had a calming effect on others and 
was always willing to lend a helping hand to 
those in need. 
Paul is remembered as full of life and love. 
He helped others to reach their goals of pur-
suing careers in transportation by serving as a 
mentor with the Overhead Line Worker ap-
prenticeship program at Mission College in 
Santa Clara, also serving as the liaison be-
tween the College and Valley Transportation 
Authority. Paul cared for others and in his final 
moments, he risked his life to keep his co-
workers safe. He is a hero, and his courage 
will never be forgotten. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring 
the life and memory of Paul Delacruz Megia.

HONORING THE LIFE OF JUSTICE 
CRUZ REYNOSO 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 30, 2021 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Justice Cruz Reynoso. Cruz 
passed away on May 7, 2021. Cruz was a 
Veteran of the United States Army, a law pro-
fessor, role model, a father, grandfather, hus-
band. 
Cruz was born on May 2, 1931 in Brea, 
California and was raised in a barrio outside of 
La Habra, California. With his experiences, 
public and community service grew to become 
such an important part of his life. Cruz had the 
urge to serve while attending grade school 
after he recognized the segregation he and his 
peers were facing. He attended and graduated 
from then Pomona College in 1953, served 
two years in the Army’s Counterintelligence 
Corps, then attended the University of Cali-
fornia, Berkeley School of Law where he was 
the only Latino in his 1958 graduating class. 
Cruz was known as a trailblazer to those 
who crossed his path. He began his career in 
service as a staff secretary for the office of 
Governor Edmund G. ‘‘Pat’’ Brown and asso-
ciate general counsel of the Equal Employ-
ment Opportunity Commission. Cruz became 
the first Latino director of the California Rural 
Legal Assistance organization, and the first 
Latino to be a law professor at the University 
of New Mexico. What brought him back to 
California was his historic 1976 appointment to 
the Court of Appeals, 3rd Appellate District, as 
the first Latino to fill the seat. Again, he was 
the first Hispanic Associate Judge on the Cali-
fornia Supreme Court. 
He was a leader, a wise, and a caring indi-
vidual who was ready to help. Cruz continued 
his service to others as he practiced in law 
firms. He was a mentor and a law professor 
at the University of California Los Angeles 
School of Law. Cruz was given the inaugural 
Boochever and Bird Endowed Chair for the 
Study and Teaching of Freedom and Equality 
at the University of California Davis School of 
Law. While doing so, he also began his eleven 
years of service on the U.S. Commission on 
Civil Rights, where he served as the vice 
chairman. 
When he was taking a break from lending a 
hand, he was getting recognized for his inspir-
ing and tireless commitment to service. Cruz 
received eight Honorary Doctorates. President 
Clinton awarded Cruz the Presidential Medal 
of Freedom in 2000 and the Hispanic Heritage 
Foundation Award. Additionally, there con-
tinues to be an investment to help students 
with their law school endeavors through fel-
lowship 
and 
scholarship 
opportunities 
in 
Cruz’s name. His legacy continues to be felt in 
Sacramento through the Cruz Reynoso Bar 
Association. Cruz was a proud son of a farm 
working family. He spent his entire life in serv-
ice advocating for workers and immigrants 
throughout his career. He was a friend to 
many in his life and evolved his passion to 
giving back to others. 
He is survived by four brothers and four sis-
ters; four children and their spouses; two step-
children and their spouses; seventeen grand-
children, three step grandchildren and two 
great grandchildren. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the life of Justice Cruz 
Reynoso. His service and contributions to the 
Nation and State of California will be missed. 
I join his family and friends in celebrating 
Cruz’s life.

Jim is a native of Batesville, Mississippi, and 
is a 1976 graduate of The University of Mis-
sissippi. He resides in Pascagoula with his 
wife, Nancy, with whom he will celebrate 45 
years of marriage in August of this year. Their 
daughter, Brooke, will be the first to tell you 
that her father has been the ultimate role 
model and mentor in her life. She grew up un-
derstanding the value of hard work and dedi-
cation as she truly was a part of the Ingalls 
family. Some of her favorite memories are 
from attending the revered tradition of Naval 
ship christenings, as well as meeting the ships 
sponsors and guests. 
Jim began his career at Ingalls in 1977 as 
a photographer and has progressed through 
the years to various positions of increasing re-
sponsibility. Jim, has been a tireless advocate 
for America’s naval supremacy on the high 
seas, through shipbuilding which helped to im-
prove the quality of life for all Mississippians. 
Jim’s list of accomplishments is extensive, a 
few highlights from his career include being a 
founding member of The Mississippi Military 
Communities Council (MMCC), and most re-
cently, serving as the organization’s chairman. 
In 2012, he was appointed by Governor Phil 
Bryant as a commissioner of GoCoast 2020, 
charged with defining how key priorities and 
leveraged resources can help overcome chal-
lenges faced by the Coast in the aftermath of 
the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill. He is most 
proud of the impact made on the Gulf Coast 
while 
serving 
alongside 
Governor 
Haley 
Barbour following Hurricane Katrina. 
Although, he is retiring from Ingalls Ship-
yard, we are fortunate that he will remain an 
active leader in our community. Jim, congratu-
lations on your well-deserved retirement. On 
behalf of Mississippi’s Fourth Congressional 
District, I thank Jim for his service.

HONORING THE LIFE OF COLONEL 
VANG FONG 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 30, 2021 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Colonel Vang Fong. Vang 
passed away on February 17, 2021 in Fresno 
County. Vang was a husband, father, and 
grandfather and a leader in the Secret War in 
Laos. 
Vang was born on January 1, 1944 in 
Rhawv Zeb, Xieng Khouang, Laos to Cheu 
Xang Vang and Nai Lor. He was one of eight 
children. In the year of 1960, Vang left school 
at the age of 12 to join the CIA’s Secret Army 
in Laos. He was chosen by the late Brigadier 
General Vang Pao in 1962 to attend military 
training at Savannakhet. It was there that 
Vang obtained the CCB/Premier Degree from 
Pham Khaum. 
Vang was stationed to Long Cheng, Laos. 
After hard work and dedication to protect all 
around him, he quickly rose rank and he was 
promoted to W–4 Chief Warrant Officer. After 
a brief period as W–4 Chief Warrant Officer, 
he was named to Lieutenant Colonel in 1964. 
Nine years later, he was appointed to rep-
resent the second military region at Luang 
Prabang, Laos. 
His love for his family encouraged him to 
make a decision on the subject of moving. He 
moved in 1980 and his family resettled in 
Hamilton, Montana. After living in Montana, he 
then had everyone move to Huntington Beach, 
California to reunite with the rest of his family. 
This move inspired Vang to be active in what-
ever community he resided in. He was a 
member of the Lao Veterans of America; in-
corporated since 1989, and the Special Guer-
rilla Units (SGU) Veterans and Families, incor-
porated since 2009. 
Even while Vang worked alongside the late 
General Vang Pao to ensure equality, social 
justice and opportunities for Hmong families in 
America, he still enjoyed being around his 
family. In 1964 he married Mylee Vang, and in 
1968 he married Kao Lee. Throughout his life, 
he raised 10 children. 
Vang was well-respected in the Hmong 
community for his courage and leadership in 
protecting many people during the Secret War 
in Laos. Vang participated in numerous 
events. He participated in the Central Valley 
Veterans Day Parade in Fresno, California, 
where he settled for the remainder of his life. 
His love for his culture was evident and admi-
rable to many in the community. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the life of Colonel Vang Fong. 
His service and contributions to the Nation 
and State of California will not be forgotten. 
He will be fondly remembered in the Central 
Valley. I join his family and friends in cele-
brating Vang’s life.

istrative assistant. She has helped so many in 
the Mayfield community, going above and be-
yond to assist the less fortunate in their times 
of need. Those who are lucky enough to know 
Ann describe her as dependable, compas-
sionate, and sincere. 
Anyone who spends half a century with one 
organization is incredibly dedicated and genu-
inely loves what they do. Ann is loved by all 
of those in her community, and I am honored 
to represent her in Congress. 
Once again, I congratulate Ann on this 
achievement. I look forward to hearing about 
all the wonderful work she will continue to do 
in her role at the Annie Gardner Foundation 
and beyond.

IN HONOR OF RAYANN DIONNE 
HON. CHRIS PAPPAS 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 30, 2021 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Rayann Dionne, who is the 2021 re-
cipient 
of 
the 
NH 
Coastal 
Adaption 
Workgroup’s Climate Champion Award. The 
CAW Climate Champion Award is given to 
members of the Seacoast community who are 
powerful advocates for climate-related re-
search and adaptation work. For 12 years, 
Rayann served as the Conservation Coordi-
nator for the Town of Hampton where she 
championed climate adaptation efforts. In ad-
dition, Rayann also serves as Vice President 
and Treasurer of the Seabrook-Hampton Estu-
ary Alliance. 
Rayann has been an invaluable part of the 
Hampton community, overseeing complex 
issues 
including 
conservation 
efforts, 
stormwater management, and floodplain man-
agement. Hampton has several miles of coast-
line and an ecologically critical estuary, and 
Rayann was critical in working with FEMA to 
enroll the town of Hampton in FEMA’s Com-
munity Rating System. She has been able to 
engage all members of the community in her 
efforts including by working with local students 
on projects to maintain the health of the 
Hampton-Seabrook Estuary, as well as coordi-
nating an auction of rain barrels painted by 
local middle school and high school students. 
Throughout her career, Rayann has been a 
fierce advocate for climate resilience. A leader 
on environmental issues, she has overseen 
both the designing and running of workshops 
and community events for Hampton residents. 
From beach clean-ups to snowshoe tours and 
the installation of a rain garden at the local li-
brary, Rayann has dedicated herself to im-
proving the Seacoast community by always 
bringing others into her work. 
Rayann Dionne has made an immeasurable 
impact on her local community and the state 
of New Hampshire not only through her con-
crete actions but also through the energy and 
positivity she brings to all her endeavors. 
Foregrounding the importance of climate ac-
tion, Rayann has served her community in a 
way that warrants our recognition. Her contin-
ued involvement in her work puts her commu-
nity, and the entire state of New Hampshire, 
on a pathway towards a more climate-resilient 
future. 
On behalf of my constituents in New Hamp-
shire’s First Congressional District, I thank 
Rayann for her decades of enthusiastic dedi-
cation to our state. The Granite State is a bet-
ter place because of the public service of 
Rayann Dionne.

IN 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
ATLANTIS 
YACHT 
CLUB’S 
60TH 
COMMIS-
SIONING DAY 
HON. FRANK PALLONE, JR. 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 30, 2021 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Atlantis Yacht Club of Monmouth 
Beach, New Jersey on its 60th Commissioning 
Day. As its officers and members gather to 
celebrate this milestone, I would like to join 
with them in honoring its history and spirit. 
Upon returning from World War II, a group 
of veterans and their families from Barnegat 
Bay to Englewood would meet up with each 
other at various locations along the eastern 
shoreline from New Jersey to Connecticut. 
Boating became a relaxing pastime for these 
families and provided an outlet from their 
memories of the war. In 1961, the group 
founded the club to further the fellowship that 
their boating engagements had developed. 
Begun at rented docks and an old Victorian 
home converted into apartments in Sea Bright, 
New Jersey, the club outgrew its first location 
after just three years. Needing a larger loca-
tion, the group constructed its new home in 
Monmouth Beach, New Jersey. The area was 
marsh and needed dredging, fill, and construc-
tion to transform it into a beautiful club house, 
pool and docks. The extensive work was com-
pleted with each founding member contributing 
what he could in his area of expertise. The 
Atlantis Yacht Club welcomed its members to 
its current home in Monmouth Beach in 1968. 
Since then, its membership has continued to 
grow, but the kinship remains. The club 
worked together to rebuild after Superstorm 
Sandy and again to remain operational during 
the COVID–19 pandemic. Throughout its 60 
years, the Atlantis Yacht Club has provided a 
welcoming and inclusive club for families of all 
backgrounds to enjoy and share. 
Madam Speaker, I sincerely hope my col-
leagues will join me in honoring the rich his-
tory of the Atlantis Yacht Club and celebrating 
its 60th Commissioning Day.

REPLACEMENT 
OF 
BUST 
OF 
ROGER 
BROOKE 
TANEY 
WITH 
BUST OF THURGOOD MARSHALL 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 29, 2021 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, as a 
senior member of the Judiciary Committee, I 
rise in strong support of H.R. 3005, which di-
rects the Joint Committee on the Library to re-
place the bust of former Supreme Court Chief 
Justice Roger Brooke Taney in the Old Su-
preme Court Chamber of the Capitol with a 
bust of civil rights legend and former Supreme 
Court Associate Justice Thurgood Marshall. 
The legislation also directs the Joint Com-
mittee on the Library to remove statues of in-
dividuals who served voluntarily at any time as 
a member of the Armed Forces of the Confed-
erate States of America or of the military of a 
State while the State was in open rebellion 
against the United States, and any individual 
who served as an official of the Government 
of the Confederate States of America or as an 
official of a State while the State was in open 
rebellion against the United States, is deserv-
ing of a place of honor in the Capitol of the 
United States. 
Madam Speaker, it is long past time that 
Congress take this fitting and appropriate ac-
tion. 
Hallowed places in the Capitol should be re-
served for persons recognized for their con-
tributions to the defense, protection, and ad-
vancement of the American experiment in de-
mocracy—what President Lincoln called the 
‘testing of the proposition’ whether a nation 
conceived and dedicated to the principle of 
equality can long endure. 
Simply put, Roger Brooke Taney does not 
meet this test; Thurgood Marshall easily ex-
ceeds it. 
At a moment of crisis in challenge for our 
young nation, Chief Justice Roger Taney 
faced a critical decision and he chose poorly 
and to his everlasting shame. 
The decision in Dred Scott v. Sandford, 60 
U.S. 393 (1856), which he authored is per-
haps the most offensive, pessimistic, and rac-
ist decision ever handed down by the U.S. Su-
preme Court, far worse than the infamous de-
cisions in Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537 
(1896), and Korematsu v. United States, 323 
U.S. 214 (1944), and Shelby County v. Holder, 
570 U.S. 529 (2013). 
Dred Scott was a slave in Missouri, who 
from 1833 to 1843, resided in Illinois (a free 
state) and in the Louisiana Territory, where 
slavery was forbidden by the Missouri Com-
promise of 1820. 
After returning to Missouri, Dred Scott filed 
suit in Missouri court for his freedom, claiming 
that his residence in free territory made him a 
free man. 
Dred Scott’s master maintained that no 
‘‘negro’’ or descendant of slaves could be a 
citizen in the sense of Article III of the Con-
stitution. 
In ruling for the slave master, Roger Taney 
wrote to his eternal shame: ‘‘The [negroes] 
had for more than a century before been re-
garded as beings of an inferior order, and alto-
gether unfit to associate with the white race ei-
ther in social or political relations, and so far 
inferior that they had no rights which the white 
man was bound to respect, and that the negro 
might justly and lawfully be reduced to slavery 
for his benefit.’’ 
According to Chief Justice Taney, black per-
sons were not, and could not be made to be, 
citizens of the United States under the Con-
stitution. 
The decision in Dred Scott was a major fac-
tor leading to the Civil War because Chief Jus-
tice Taney’s opinion also held, obiter dicta, 
that Congress lacked the power under the 
Constitution to prohibit slavery in territorial 
areas of the United States, which vitiated the 
Missouri Compromise of 1820. 
Madam Speaker, to anyone who professes 
to doubt the existence of white supremacy or 
claims not to understand what it means, I 
would recommend they actually read Chief 
Justice Taney’s opinion in Dred Scott; they will 
be disabused of any pretension that the dan-
ger of white supremacy is a figment of the 
imagination. 
In contrast to Roger Taney, Thurgood Mar-
shall represents everything that is good and 
decent and optimistic about our country. 
Madam Speaker, in this nation’s new birth 
of freedom that was prophesied by President 
Abraham Lincoln, Thurgood Marshall was per-
haps the principal architect of equality, work-
ing through the judicial system to eradicate the 
legacy of slavery and destroy the segregation 
system of Jim Crow. 
Before Thurgood Marshall ascended to the 
federal bench as a Circuit Judge in 1961 and 
later to the Supreme Court as the nation’s first 
African American Associate Justice, he was 
Solicitor General of the United States and 
would argue 32 cases before the Supreme 
Court, winning 29 victories, more than any 
other individual in history. 
For more than a half century, Thurgood 
Marshall championed the cause of justice and 
equality in America, fighting valiantly and tire-
lessly on behalf of African-Americans and oth-
ers to secure their civil rights and liberties and 
the full measure of justice and equality for all. 
At a time when African-Americans were 
treated as second-class citizens and the 
scourge of slavery was still rampant, Thurgood 
Marshall worked against overwhelming odds 
to ensure that the rights, interests and voices 
of African-Americans did not go unheard. 
Thurgood Marshall is perhaps best known 
for the practice he pioneered with the leg-
endary Charles Hamilton Houston of ‘‘impact 
litigation,’’ the strategy of bringing carefully se-
lected cases to court to establish legal prece-
dents of beneficially affecting thousands, and 
frequently millions, of persons beyond the im-
mediate parties to the case. 
Among 
the 
historic 
victories 
won 
by 
Thurgood Marshall and his lawyer colleagues 
at the NAACP were: 
1. Chambers v. Florida, 309 U.S. 227 
(1940), which established that confessions ob-
tained as the result of police coercion are in-
admissible at trial; 
2. Smith v. Allwright, 321 U.S. 649 (1944), 
which outlawed the South’s ‘‘white primary’’; 
3. Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U.S. 1 (1948), 
which ruled racially restrictive covenants and 
unconstitutional and legally enforceable; 
4. Sweatt v. Painter 339 U.S. 629 (1950), 
and McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents, 
309 U.S. 637 (1950), which held that separate 
law and graduate schools are inherently un-
equal and thus constitutional; 
5. Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 
347 U.S. 483 (1954), the landmark case over-
ruling separate but equal doctrine of Plessy v. 
Ferguson; and 
6. Browder v. Gayle, 352 U.S. 903 (1956), 
which outlawed the practice of racial segrega-
tion on buses and led to the end of the Mont-
gomery Bus Boycott. 
As Chair for the Congressional Children’s 
Caucus, I am especially concerned with fair 
access to quality education for today’s youth 
and am personally grateful to Thurgood Mar-
shall and the NAACP for its leadership in win-
ning the greatest legal victory for civil rights in 
American history, the 1954 landmark decision 
in Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 
(1954), in which the Supreme Court struck 
down de jure segregation in elementary 
schools. 
NAACP General Counsel Thurgood Mar-
shall, who would later become the first African 
American Solicitor General and Associate Jus-
tice of the Supreme Court, forcefully argued 
and persuaded the Court to rule unanimously 
that in the field of public education, ‘‘separate 
but equal’’ was inherently unequal. 
That decision gave hope to millions of 
Americans that their children might enjoy the 
full promise of America that had been denied 
their forebears for more than three centuries. 
There is still a need for justice and equal 
treatment for African Americans and other vul-
nerable populations in our country, and thank-
fully, we still have leaders following in the foot-
steps of Thurgood Marshall as we make our 
way on the path to a more perfect union. 
It is therefore fitting that the bust of the 
great Thurgood Marshall adorns the Old Su-
preme Court Chambers in the U.S. Capitol as 
a rebuke to Roger Taney and a symbol of the 
commitment of the Constitution and of Amer-
ican democracy that in this country all persons 
are equal before the law and entitled to equal 
justice. 
Madam Speaker, Thurgood Marshall fa-
mously said: ‘‘I wish I could say that racism 
and prejudice were only distant memories. We 
must dissent from the indifference. We must 
dissent from the apathy. We must dissent from 
the fear, the hatred and the mistrust . . . We 
must dissent because America can do better, 
because America has no choice but to do bet-
ter.’’ 
The refusal to tolerate injustice is what led 
millions of persons of goodwill across the na-
tion to take to the streets in peaceful protest 
to demand equal justice for all and an active, 
engaged commitment to making the promise 
of America real for all Americans. 
Equality requires unity of purpose and unity 
requires reconciliation, which requires ac-
countability which requires truth. 
Thurgood Marshall recognized, as President 
Lincoln recognized, the truth is that slavery is 
America’s Original Sin, a crime against nature 
and humanity so horrific and understood that 
the Almighty gave to both North and South 
this terrible war and may will it continue ‘‘until 
all the wealth piled by the bondsman’s two 
hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall 
be sunk and until every drop of blood drawn 
with the lash shall be paid by another drawn 
with the sword.’’ 
And if that happened Lincoln told his coun-
trymen that ‘‘as was said three thousand years 
ago so still it must be said ‘the judgments of 
the Lord are true and righteous altogether.’ ’’

June 30, 2021 
That debt remains to be paid, which is why 
African Americans have always peacefully pe-
titioned the government for the redress of its 
grievances. 
Madam Speaker, Juneteenth celebrates Af-
rican American freedom while encouraging 
self-development and respect for all cultures. 
But it must always remain a reminder to us 
all that liberty and freedom are precious birth-
rights of all Americans, which must be jeal-
ously guarded and preserved for future gen-
erations. 
In 
1852, 
Frederick 
Douglass 
famously 
asked: ‘‘What to the slave is the 4th of July?’’ 
In 2021, we can reply that it is the beginning 
of the American Promise that would be fulfilled 
and made real for all Americans, including the 
descendants of slaves, on June 19, 1865, 
‘Juneteenth Day.’ 
The Bible teaches that ‘‘To every thing there 
is a season,’’ and to every generation there 
comes a day of reckoning for the original sin 
of American slavery. 
That is why I have introduced H.R. 40, 
which establishes a national commission to 
examine slavery and discrimination in the 
colonies and the United States from 1619 to 
the present and recommend appropriate rem-
edies. 
Among other requirements, the commission 
shall identify (1) the role of federal and state 
governments in supporting the institution of 
slavery; (2) forms of discrimination in the pub-
lic and private sectors against freed slaves 
and their descendants; and (3) lingering nega-
tive effects of slavery on living African-Ameri-
cans and society. 
‘‘Official slavery ended with the Civil War 
and ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment. 
But unofficial slavery was continued with the 
new institution of share-crop farming, a crimi-
nal justice system that would press convicts 
into work once done by slaves, and labor poli-
cies that dictated income for work done based 
upon skin color. 
And, of course, all of this was reinforced by 
the systematic disenfranchisement of black 
Americans, the ‘‘discrete and insular minority’’ 
excluded from ‘‘those political processes ordi-
narily to be relied upon to protect’’ them, to 
quote Chief Justice Hughes’ famous Footnote 
4 in United States v. Carolene Products, 304 
U.S. 144 (1938). 
The history of the United States is inter-
twined with the history of enslaved Africans in 
the Americas. 
There is blood and there are tears, but there 
is also redemption and reconciliation. 
But to get there, we must have the complete 
truth and lay our history bare. 
It is the light that sheds the way to the more 
perfect union all Americans want. 
Thurgood Marshall would want us to pass 
H.R. 40 and create the Commission it empow-
ers as a necessary first step in that effort to 
get to truth and reconciliation about the ‘Origi-
nal Sin of American Slavery’ that is necessary 
to light the way to the beloved community we 
all seek. 
Madam Speaker, I also support H.R. 3005 
because it puts Congress squarely on record 
behind the principle that no individual who 
served voluntarily at any time as a member of 
the Armed Forces of the Confederate States 
of America or of the military of a State while 
the State was in open rebellion against the 
United States, and no individual who served 
as an official of the Government of the Con-
federate States of America or as an official of 
a State while the State was in open rebellion 
against the United States, is deserving of a 
place of honor in the Capitol of the United 
States. 
I urge all Members to join me in voting for 
H.R. 3005, which replaces the bust of Chief 
Justice Roger Brooke Taney, a symbol of the 
dark days of the nation’s past, with a bust of 
Thurgood Marshall, the personification of our 
nation’s belief in a bright and shining future.

HONORING WALTER RADCLIFFE’S 
100TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. ANDY KIM 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 30, 2021 
Mr. KIM of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor Walter Radcliffe’s 100th 
birthday. 
Mr. Radcliffe embodies the resilience, for-
titude, and can-do-spirit of the ‘‘Greatest Gen-
eration.’’ In a time of crisis, he courageously 
volunteered to serve in the U.S. Navy during 
World War II, despite having a civilian job ex-
emption. Mr. Radcliffe fought in the Pacific 
Theatre aboard the U.S.S. Isherwood. We 
owe him a debt of gratitude for his combat 
record in the Battles of Leyte Gulf and serving 
at Subic Bay, as well as for the valor he dem-
onstrated during the Invasion of Lingayen Gulf 
and the Battle of Okinawa. 
Mr. Radcliffe is beloved by his family, in-
cluding his wife Dorothy of more than 38 
years, his children, and grandchildren, and by 
his community where he’s still an active mem-
ber of VFW Post 10092. It is clear to everyone 
who knows Mr. Radcliffe that he has made the 
most of each of his one-hundred years. 
I wish him the best on achieving this mile-
stone and hope he enjoys a wonderful cele-
bration.

IG INDEPENDENCE AND 
EMPOWERMENT ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. ED CASE 
OF HAWAII 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 29, 2021 
Mr. CASE. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
strong support of H.R. 2662, the IG Independ-
ence and Empowerment Act, of which I am a 
cosponsor. 
The work of our Inspectors General through-
out government in providing an independent, 
objective and professional review and assess-
ment of legal compliance and waste, fraud 
and abuse is critical to the overall functioning 
of government and to ensuring public trust and 
confidence in government. Equally, efforts to 
weaken, politicize, influence and cow our In-
spectors Generals are direct threats to smooth 
government functioning, efficient and effective 
use of taxpayer dollars and the public trust 
and cannot be tolerated. 
Chair MALONEY’s bill takes some of the best 
recommendations from the Council of the In-
spectors General on Integrity and Efficiency to 
ensure Inspectors General independence, in-
crease transparency and improve the effec-
tiveness of one of our government’s major 
checks mechanisms. This much-needed bill 
will improve the work of our Inspectors Gen-
eral community, which is even more critical 
now as we expend literally trillions of dollars in 
emergency COVID–19 relief. 
I especially appreciate that this bill includes 
elements of Congressman COOPER’s Inspec-
tors General Independence Act, which I also 
cosponsored and which was endorsed by my 
Blue Dog Coalition last Congress because of 
its focus on issues related to fiscal responsi-
bility, good governance and national security. 
I also appreciate the Committee’s support of 
the amendment submitted by Congresswoman 
BOURDEAUX, Chair of the Blue Dogs Task 
Force on Fiscal Responsibility and Govern-
ment Reform, which ensures that Inspectors 
General and their staffs receive sufficient train-
ing on the remedies available to them, specifi-
cally suspension or debarment, to fully ad-
dress identified private sector government 
contracting waste, fraud or abuse. 
This is a solid and much-needed improve-
ment for one of our federal government’s most 
valuable communities, and I urge its passage.

HONORING THE CAREER OF DAVID 
POMAVILLE 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 30, 2021 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize my dear friend, David Pomaville, on 
the occasion of his retirement from the posi-
tion of Director of Public Health for Fresno 
County. David has been a staple across the 
county and will be greatly missed. 
David is a 1986 public health alumnus of 
Fresno State. When David received his bach-
elor’s degree in Health Science with an em-
phasis in Environmental Health 36 years ago, 
he did not imagine where his profession would 
take him. He ended up leading the way for our 
county during these unprecedented times. He 
led a team of 380 employees in seven divi-
sions including emergency medical services, 
public health nursing, children’s services, 
health and wellness, environmental health, 
community health, and planning and commu-
nication. 
Along with his committed career, David has 
found time to give back to his community; es-
pecially to current Fresno State students. 
Many have interned at the Department of Pub-
lic Health and go on to have distinguished ca-
reers in the field. Some of the current health 
education interns have stayed on to work 
throughout the COVID–19 pandemic. His work 
has contributed to giving students an under-
standing of how to care for people and the 
extra needed attention during the pandemic. 
His ties to Fresno State have remained 
strong. His wife, Dr. Fran Pomaville, is a pro-
fessor of speech language pathology at Fres-
no State. David and Fran have a strong influ-
ence on their son, Matt, who also graduated 
from the University and is pursuing a Ph.D. in 
the health sciences field. 
David’s passion to help others in public 
health is evident and I greatly appreciate his 
endless hard work, our conversations per-
taining to the well-being of Fresno County, 
and his selfless compassion that has helped 
many.

JUNE VETERAN OF THE MONTH 
HON. KEVIN HERN 
OF OKLAHOMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 30, 2021 
Mr. HERN. Madam Speaker, I rise to honor 
the First District of Oklahoma’s June Veteran 
of the Month, Joshua Starks. 
Joshua Starks faithfully served our country 
in the United States Army and the Oklahoma 
National Guard. He was a Combat Outpost 
Commander in Afghanistan and an Infantry 
Officer in both the Army and National Guard. 
Mr. Starks has continued to help others in his 
community and assist his fellow veterans. His 
commitment and passion for service speaks 
volumes about his character. 
Mr. Stark’s dedication to service is evident 
through his work in our community. He is the 
former Post Commander and current Sr. Vice 
Commander of VFW Post 577. Mr. Starks is 
also the Tulsa Veteran’s Day Parade Chair-
man. He represents his fellow veterans as a 
member of the Tulsa Human Rights Commis-
sion. Joshua is also involved with the Tulsa 
Area United Way. In 2019, he was recognized 
as the 2019 Emerging Leaders Society Volun-
teer of the Year Award. 
He answered the call to defend freedom 
across the globe and sacrificed whatever was 
necessary in the name of that noble cause. It 
is my honor to recognize Joshua Starks as the 
1st Congressional District of Oklahoma’s June 
Veteran of the Month.

CONGRATULATING ELAINA KOENIG 
ON 
RECEIVING 
THE 
CONGRES-

HON. JAIME HERRERA BEUTLER 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 30, 2021 
Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize and congratulate 
Elaina Koenig, from Ethel, Washington for 
being awarded the Congressional Award Gold 
Medal. 
Every year, the Congressional Award Foun-
dation honors a select number of young Amer-
icans with Congress’ highest honor—The Con-
gressional Award Gold Medal. The award en-
courages our youth to set ambitious goals and 
put in the work and dedication to achieve 
them. 
Elaina completed 800 hours to hone her 
skills in four areas: Voluntary Public Service, 
Personal Development, Physical Fitness, and 
Expedition/Exploration activities. Her commit-
ment and dedication to her goals are exactly 
why Elaina is being recognized for this pres-
tigious award.

HON. VICKY HARTZLER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 30, 2021 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Madam Speaker, on 
Tuesday, June 29, 2021, I was unable to vote. 
Had I been present, I would have voted as fol-
lows: NAY on Roll Call No. 189, NAY on Roll 
Call No. 190, YEA on Roll Call No. 191, and 
YEA on Roll Call No. 192.

PIPELINE SAFETY STUDY ACT 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 30, 2021 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, today I 
introduce the ‘‘Pipeline Safety Study Act’’ to 
direct a National Academy of Sciences study 
and report to Congress on the vulnerabilities 
in our oil and natural gas pipeline infrastruc-
ture. This bill is based on legislation I cospon-
sored last Congress with former Congressman 
Harley Rouda (D–CA–48). I also want to thank 
the National Society of Professional Sur-
veyors, Subsurface Utility Engineering Asso-
ciation, and U.S. Geospatial Executives Orga-
nization for endorsing my bill. 
Specifically, the legislation I introduce today 
would 
direct 
the 
National 
Academy 
of 
Sciences to review current federal regulations 
for pipeline safety and identify risks to pipe-
lines from earthquakes and climate change-re-
lated weather events, whether by their design 
or their location. The federal guidelines for 
earthquake-resistant construction of gas and 
liquid fuel pipelines have not been meaning-
fully updated since 1992. 
Since then, the proliferation of hydraulic 
fracturing for natural gas has been linked to 
increasingly frequent earthquakes in states 
with virtually no prior history of naturally occur-
ring earthquakes. Because California is riddled 
with active fault lines and has experienced in-
creasingly regular and severe forest fires due 
to climate change, my home state’s energy in-
frastructure is particularly vulnerable to these 
threats. 
In 2010, eight people died in San Bruno, 
California when a defective pipeline exploded, 
but this tragedy was eminently avoidable. 
Residents had reported smelling a gas leak 
days ahead of the explosion, and investigators 
later found evidence of shoddy welds that had 
rendered the pipeline vulnerable to any num-
ber of potential disruptions. While this event 
was not directly linked to an earthquake and 
instead caused by shoddy maintenance and 
failure to replace an antiquated line, the fed-
eral government can and must do better to im-
prove pipeline safety. 
Madam Speaker, Congress cannot begin to 
strengthen the safety and resiliency require-
ments for federally regulated pipelines before 
we understand the gaps in the government’s 
own outdated regulations and industry prac-
tices. The National Academy of Sciences 
study authorized in my bill would do just that, 
so that Congress can understand the scope of 
the problem and begin to legislate the solu-
tion. 
I thank Chairman DEFAZIO (D–OR) for in-
cluding my bill in the hazmat title of the ‘‘In-
vesting in a New Vision for the Environment 
and Surface Transportation (INVEST) in Amer-
ica Act’’ (H.R. 3684).

REMEMBERING JOHN KLEIN 
HON. TIM RYAN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 30, 2021 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of John Klein, who passed on 
June 20, 2021 in Columbus, Ohio at the age 
of 72. 
John was a passionate family man who 
treasured his time coaching his two boys in 
basketball. He was the assistant basketball 
coach for Belpre High School from 1996 
through 2002. Throughout, he also coached all 
kinds of teams from junior high school to AAU. 
John would readily admit that his sons’ trips to 
the Ohio High School Athletic Association bas-
ketball state tournament were the highlights of 
his coaching career. 
Mr. Klein is a graduate of Aurora High 
School and Indiana State University. He re-
tired from AEP in 2019 having worked at Zim-
mer Power Plant, Muskingum River Power 
Plant, Pickaway Power Plant and the Darby 
Gas Plant. 
John was one of the most caring men you 
could ever meet with a quirky sense of humor 
that would have people in stitches. He loved 
going to the track and playing poker at the ca-
sinos. There wasn’t a Hallmark movie that 
John didn’t like. He was the ultimate Cincinnati 
Reds and Bengals fan. Always anticipating the 
upcoming season. 
He was predeceased by his parents, Gene 
and Lucille Klein, and his sister, Emily Klein. 
John is survived by his wife, Theresa, sons, 
Zach (Jennie) and Patrick (Whitney); grand-
children, Stella and Rocco; and brothers, Dave 
(Marcia) and Mike (Jill). John also had a myr-
iad of nieces, nephews, great nieces and 
great nephews. 
John’s love and dedication for his family and 
for life was something special. Not only did 
John serve as a devoted coach of basketball, 
but as a role model for all those he knew, 
touching many lives along the way. My deep-
est condolences go out to his dear family and 
friends.

HONORING THE LIFE OF LIEUTEN-
ANT COLONEL WANGYEE VANG 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 30, 2021 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Lieutenant Colonel Wangyee 
Vang. Wangyee passed away on January 18, 
2021 after many years of service as a Hmong- 
Laotian and American community leader. 
Wangyee was a son, a brother, a husband, a 
father and a friend. 
Wangyee was born on November 8, 1947 in 
Ban 
Phousabot, 
Tasseng 
Phouasabot, 
Muangkham, Province of Xiengkhouang, Laos. 
In December of 1960, Wangyee was sum-
moned in the army and sent to Hua Hin, Thai-
land for training as a field radio operator and

parachutist. In January 1963, he was released 
from the army where he continued to further 
his education to become a teacher. From 
1969 to 1970 Wangyee taught math and 
science at Samthong College. Later in the 
summer of 1970, Wangyee was transferred 
from the Ministry of Education to the Ministry 
of Defense as Captain for the Special Guerilla 
Force. He was appointed as the officer liaison 
and operation assistant with the American 
Special Officers, received leadership training, 
and graduated from the Lao National Army 
Staff School in Vientiane, Laos in 1972. 
Wangyee received the Medal of Honor for 
excellent citizenship from the Majesty of King 
of Lao, Sri Savang Vathana. In 1973, he re-
turned to the Second Military Region. He 
transitioned to Major General Yang Pao’s 
team and was appointed as Chief of Per-
sonnel Bureau of the First Strike Division In-
fantry. A year later, he was promoted to Lieu-
tenant Colonel by King Vathana and awarded 
the Medal of Honor for courage and nomi-
nated as the Chief of Staff for the military’s 
Second Brigade Infantry. 
After the fall of Laos in 1975, Wangyee and 
his family left to Nam Phong, Thailand for ref-
uge. Wangyee saw a need to become an ad-
vocate for his people and became the Hmong 
Refugee Representative from l977 to 1979. 
His top priorities were food, medical care, bet-
ter living conditions and education. He was re-
sponsible for the communication with the 
United Nations and the United States. His ad-
vocacy helped lead the United States to begin 
accepting 25,000 refugees a year starting in 
1978. 
In 1979, Wangyee and his family left for po-
litical refuge in the United States and settled 
in Huntington Beach, California, then moved to 
Fresno, California in 1989, where he estab-
lished the Lao Veterans of America. His many 
accomplishments include the establishment of 
the Lao Veterans Memorial in Arlington Na-
tional Cemetery to honor Hmong and Lao vet-
erans and their American advisors who served 
in defense of the Kingdom of Laos and U.S. 
National Security interests during the Vietnam 
War, and his advocacy of the Hmong Vet-
erans’ Naturalization Act of 2000. 
In the Central Valley, Wangyee was instru-
mental in the establishment of the Lao Hmong 
American War Memorial at the Fresno Supe-
rior Court. From 2000 to 2008, he was the 
‘‘Volunteer Expert Team’’ for former Fresno 
Mayor Alan Autry. From 2005 to 2012, he was 
appointed by the Govenor of California to be 
on the Board of Directors for the 21st District 
Agriculture of Fresno and the Big Fresno Fair. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the life of Lieutenant Colonel 
Wangyee Vang. Wangyee was a symbol of 
hard work, dedication and commitment. His in-
fluence will live on in the Lao and Hmong 
community for years to come.

HON. BOB GOOD 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 30, 2021 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I 
was unable to vote on June 30, 2021 due to 
travel arrangements. Had I been present, I 
would have voted as follows: NO on Roll Call 
No. 197; NO on Roll Call No. 198; NO on Roll 
Call No. 199; NO on Roll Call No. 200; NO on 
Roll Call No. 201; YES on Roll Call No. 202; 
NO on Roll Call No. 203; and YES on Roll 
Call No. 204. 
I oppose H. Res. 503, ‘‘Establishing a Se-
lect Committee to Investigate the January 6th 
Attack on the United States Capitol’’ because 
politicizing justice undermines trust in the rule 
of law. 
Since January 6th, I’ve called for the full 
prosecution of anyone who broke the law. The 
Department of Justice is already working on 
an investigation that has resulted in hundreds 
of arrests. In contrast Democrats have spent 
this time smearing elected Republicans, 74 
million Trump voters, and undermining the ef-
forts of our law enforcement. After one failed 
vote to create a similar commission, Speaker 
PELOSI is asking the House to vote for a par-
tisan select committee. I oppose this political 
theater.
