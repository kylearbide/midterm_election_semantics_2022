come near Your holy mountain? And 
yet, we dare approach You in this mo-

strength to live this day without 
blame, that we would do what is right; 
and in opening our hearts to Your 
truth, that we would speak it. 
May our words, our conversations, do 
no harm, neither to a stranger nor to 
friend or loved one. 
Call us out when our lives turn to-
ward wickedness, but we pray for Your 
approval when what we do, what we 
say, and how we live honors Your 
righteousness. 
May we keep the vows we have made 
to You, to our spouses, to our country. 
To each, may we give of ourselves 
without asking for more in return. And 
may we be faithful and merciful in our 
dealings with the innocent. 
In the living of our lives this day, 
cause not our feet to stumble. In Your 
most holy name we pray. 
Amen.

RECOGNIZING THE SOUTH IRON 
PANTHERS 
HON. JASON SMITH 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, April 30, 2021 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the South Iron Panthers of 
Annapolis who are the 2021 Missouri Class 1 
Boys Basketball Champions. 
The Panthers achieved a 25–4 record for 
their season and in the game for the top prize 
they beat Mound City 69–50. That gave South 
Iron their first state championship since 1965. 
Coach Dusty Dinkins praised his team for 
their hard work and passion to play their best. 
Indeed, that dedication to excellence paid off 
on the court. 
I offer my heartfelt congratulations to Coach 
Dinkins, Assistant Coaches Delbert Jackson, 
Jason McMurry and Jared Middleton, and their 
championship players Jermarco Burse, Jr., 
Jermarquis Burse, Drenin Dinkins, Kolton 
Dinkins, Jacob Leverett, Luke Lunyou, Champ 
McMurry, DJ Prater, Gabe Ruble, and Brock 
Wakefield. 
It is my great privilege to recognize the 
South Iron High School Panthers as the Class 
I Missouri State Championship Boys Basket-
ball team today before the United States 
House of Representatives.

THE

LAND 
PROCUREMENT 
REFORM 
ACT OF 2021 
HON. J. LUIS CORREA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, April 30, 2021 
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, I am proud 
to reintroduce this bipartisan legislation to re-
form the way the Department of Homeland 
Security procures uniforms and protective 
equipment for its personnel. The aim is to im-
prove the quality of uniforms and equipment 
issued to Department frontline personnel by 
encouraging the procurement of domestically 
sourced uniform items. 
Today, OHS has tens of thousands of uni-
formed officers, but not all of those uniforms 
are made here in the United States. Under 
this legislation, at least a third of OHS funds 
spent on uniforms are to be used to purchase 
goods manufactured by American small busi-
nesses. 
Madam Speaker, my bill is good for home-
land security, and it is good for small Amer-
ican businesses. 
Additionally, in response to concerns ex-
pressed by frontline personnel about how 
quickly they exhaust their annual uniform al-
lowances, my bill directs the Secretary of 
Homeland Security to take a hard look at the 
adequacy of the allowances. In studying the 
issue, the Secretary is required to determine 
what improvements can be made to the cur-
rent allowances and what impacts the current 
allowances have had on employee morale and 
retention

RECOGNITION OF HOPE OF 
DETROIT ACADEMY 
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, April 30, 2021 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the students at Hope of Detroit 
Academy for their outstanding achievement in 
STEM and being recognized as a Samsung 
Solve for Tomorrow competition semifinalist. 
Under the guidance of their teacher Ms. 
Allie Langwald, students Abrahan Salas, 
Yaritza Campos, and ltzel Martinez worked 
diligently to find innovative solutions to ad-
dress issues in their community in Southwest 
Detroit. I had the opportunity to meet with 
them earlier this year and was impressed with 
their dedication to addressing environmental 
issues, like illegal dumping and abandoned 
buildings open to trespass. 
Their hard work culminated in the creation 
of the Green Warrior app which utilizes tech-
nology to help residents quickly and easily re-
port illegal dumping sites in need of clean up 
and dangerous buildings. In partnership with 
the City of Detroit and other community-based 
organizations, their app will ensure that neigh-
borhood streets and parks are cleaned up and 
dangerous building boarded up so the commu-
nity can enjoy the use of public spaces. 
Please join me in recognizing the hard work 
of Hope of Detroit on behalf of the commu-
nities of Detroit, Wayne County, and Michi-
gan’s 13th Congressional District and con-
gratulate them on this well-deserved honor.

CABARRUS 
COUNTY 
LIBERTY BELL AWARD RECIPI-
ENT HOWARD IRVIN 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, April 30, 2021 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Howard Irvin on receiving the 
Cabarrus County Bar Association Liberty Bell 
Award. 
A native of North Carolina, Mr. Irvin grad-
uated from the University of North Carolina at 
Chapel Hill Law School before beginning his 
legal career in 1965 as a lieutenant in the 
Judge Advocate General’s Corps for the 
United States Navy. After his service to our 
nation, Mr. Irvin joined the law practice of his 
father, E. Johnston Irvin, before limiting his 
practice to real estate law in 1971. 
Mr. Irvin is a consummate professional and 
boasts over fifty years of legal service to his 
community and has continuously adapted to 
changes in real estate law to best protect his 
clients. He has handled over thirty-five thou-
sand real estate closings during his career. 
The Liberty Bell Award is presented to an 
individual that goes forth to educate on and 
upholds laws that support American freedom. 
Throughout his involvement in Cabarrus Coun-
ty, Mr. Irvin has helped many people regain 
their confidence in our judicial system by 
being a constant resource of knowledge. 
There is no doubt in my mind that Mr. Irvin will 
continue to help the people of Cabarrus Coun-
ty with his unwavering commitment to the law 
and serving others. 
Madam Speaker, please join me today in 
congratulating Howard Irvin as the Cabarrus 
County Bar Association Liberty Bell Award re-
cipient and wish him well as he continues to 
uphold our American freedom.

TRIBUTE TO SHELIA PAYTON 
HON. GWEN MOORE 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, April 30, 2021 
Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Shelia Payton 
who is retiring from my district office on April 
30, 2021, after 16 years of dedicated and dis-
tinguished service to my office and the con-
stituents of the 4th Congressional District. 
I have known Shelia for over 30 years. She 
joined my district office in 2005 immediately 
after I began my first term in the House of 
Representatives where she worked as a case-
worker on the following issues: small business 
and minority business matters, Internal Rev-
enue Service concerns and outreach to busi-
ness groups and faith-based organizations. 
She assisted constituents in obtaining their 
money on their federal returns and she cre-
ated awareness and shared resources to 
small businesses and minority businesses 
looking for opportunities. Over the years, she 
established and maintained strong working re-
lationships with many federal agencies, busi-
ness groups, business chambers, and commu-
nity based and faith-based organizations. 
Shelia took immense pride in her work product 
and throughout her tenure in my office en-
sured the constituents of the 4th Congres-
sional District were well served. 
I am happy that Shelia will start a new 
chapter in her life having had such an illus-
trious career as a journalist, business owner, 
marketing and copy freelance producer, au-
thor, playwright, and most recently as a public 
servant in my office. 
Shelia began her career by earning a bach-
elor’s degree in Journalism from Syracuse 
University and working for the Miami Herald. 
She also received a master’s degree in Urban 
Affairs from the University of Wisconsin-Mil-
waukee. She worked in public relations for Mil-
ler Brewing and went on to work for the Uni-
versity of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Minority Entre-
preneurship Program. She also held jobs as a

freelance producer for Milwaukee Profiles, a 
program on Milwaukee Public Television. She 
has owned the Wisconsin Black Pages for the 
last two decades, which not only serves as a 
directory for African-American owned busi-
nesses, but also provides resources to the 
community. 
Shelia’s belief in the power of education in-
spired her and her parents to create the 
Payton-Price Family Scholarship Fund. The 
scholarship helps African American students 
from the City of Milwaukee pursue higher edu-
cation at historically black colleges and univer-
sities. It is clear that Shelia has a passion for 
education, community, advancing the eco-
nomic power of African Americans and people 
of color. 
She also possesses a strong interest and 
numerous accomplishments in the creative 
arts. She authored two non-fiction books, Cul-
tures of America: African Americans and What 
Counts Most Is How You Finish: Thoughts on 
Living Life to the Fullest. As a playwright she 
wrote her first professionally produced play, 
Facing the Shadow, which was staged in 2012 
at the Black Rep in St. Louis. Shelia has also 
written a libretto for an African American 
themed opera, Black Caesar. 
Shelia is devoted to family, especially her 
mother, brother, sister-in-law, niece, nephew, 
and other extended family members. She was 
close to her late father and serves as a loving 
companion and sometimes caregiver to her el-
derly mother, Gertrude Payton. Shelia is very 
active in the community and her church. In ad-
dition to previously being an avid skier, Shelia 
loves writing, attending the theater, traveling, 
and other hobbies. 
Madam Speaker, after 16 years of dedi-
cated service on my staff, I wish Shelia well in 
her retirement and continued success in all 
her future endeavors. I am so proud to honor 
my dear friend and thank her for her service 
to the constituents of Wisconsin’s 4th Con-
gressional District. While she has closed this 
door, another one is opening for her so that 
she may pursue life at her own pace.

SUPPORTING H.R. 1996 
HON. STEVE STIVERS 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, April 30, 2021 
Mr. STIVERS. Madam Speaker, I include in 
the RECORD the following letters of endorse-
ment for H.R. 1996, the SAFE Banking Act of 
2021. 
DUE PROCESS INSTITUTE. 
Washington, DC. 
SUPPORT H.R. 1996—SAFE BANKING ACT 
Due Process Institute supports the SAFE 
Banking Act, H.R. 1996, and urges you to 
vote in support of this bipartisan bill when it 
comes to the House floor this evening. 
Nearly every state has legalized a form of 
marijuana, including medical marijuana or 
cannabidiol (CBD). Seventeen states and the 
District of Columbia have either decriminal-
ized marijuana or legalized recreational use 
for adults. The cannabis industry is growing. 
The American cannabis industry saw $17.5 
billion in sales in 2020, a 46 percent increase 
over the previous year. The industry, which 
already supports 250,000 jobs, is expected to 
continue to grow, particularly as more 
states legalize marijuana. 
Although nearly every state has taken 
some step to liberalize marijuana laws, Con-
gress has not yet taken action to support 
their self-governance, which creates a prob-
lem for businesses operating legally under 
state law. Because of the federal treatment 
of marijuana, the owners or employees of le-
gitimate cannabis-related state businesses 
are forced to make cash-only sales rather 
than doing business with federally regulated 
banks. Additionally, proceeds from any le-
gitimate state cannabis-related business can 
currently be considered unlawful ‘‘proceeds’’ 
from a crime and subject to federal anti- 
money laundering and forfeiture laws. 
The SAFE Banking Act provides safe har-
bor and other protections for financial insti-
tutions—banks 
and 
credit 
unions—that 
transact with legitimate cannabis-related 
and hemp-related businesses. (Hemp was fed-
erally legalized in 2018.) The bill also pro-
tects ancillary business entities that trans-
act with legitimate cannabis-related legiti-
mate businesses and creates a regulatory 
framework. 
The legislative history of the SAFE Bank-
ing Act shows broad bipartisan support. In 
the 116th Congress, the SAFE Banking Act 
passed with 229 Democrats and 91 Repub-
licans voting for the bill. The SAFE Banking 
Act the House will vote on this evening has 
168 co-sponsors, boasting diverse support 
from across the ideological spectrum. 
Due Process Institute encourages Members 
to vote YES on the SAFE Banking Act, 
H.R.1996. 
Due Process Institute is a bipartisan non-
profit that works to honor, preserve, and re-
store principles of fairness in the criminal 
legal system.

DEAR
REPRESENTATIVES
PERLMUTTER, 
VELAZQUEZ, STIVERS, AND DAVIDSON AND SEN-
ATORS MERKLEY AND DAINES: 
On behalf of the members of the Electronic 
Transactions Association (ETA), I am writ-
ing in support of the bipartisan Secure and 
Fair Enforcement Banking Act of 2021 (SAFE 
Banking Act). We appreciate your leadership 
on addressing the conflict between federal 
and state laws to allow states that have le-
galized medical or recreational use of can-
nabis to bring that commerce into the bank-
ing system. 
ETA is the leading trade association for 
the payments technology industry, rep-
resenting over 500 companies that offer elec-
tronic transaction processing products and 
services. ETA’s members include financial 
institutions, mobile payment service pro-
viders, payment processors, mobile wallet 
providers, and non-bank online lenders that 
make commercial loans, primarily to small 
businesses, either directly or in partnership 
with other lenders. ETA member companies 
are creating innovative offerings in financial 
services, revolutionizing the way commerce 
is conducted with secure, convenient, and re-
warding payment solutions and lending al-
ternatives—employing millions of Americans 
and enabling over $22 trillion in payments in 
2019. 
Forty-seven states, four U.S. territories, 
and the District of Columbia have legalized 
some form of recreational or medical can-
nabis, including CBD. Yet current law re-
stricts legitimate licensed cannabis busi-
nesses from accessing financial industry 
services and products, resulting in businesses 
operating in all cash—posing a serious public 
safety risk for communities. 
The conflict between state and federal laws 
forces businesses to operate on a cash-only 
basis and has created significant legal and 
compliance concerns for financial institu-
tions that wish to provide banking services 
to cannabis related businesses in states 
where it is currently legal. The SAFE Bank-
ing Act would allow legitimate cannabis 
businesses to access the safety and security 
of the banking ecosystem in states that have 
legalized cannabis. This legislation is an im-
portant step toward enabling financial serv-
ices for cannabis-related businesses. By di-
recting FinCEN and the federal banking reg-
ulators to issue for financial institutions 
doing business with cannabis-related legiti-
mate businesses. Having access to the bank-
ing system makes it easier for businesses to 
track revenues for taxation purposes, de-
creases a public safety threat as cash inten-
sive businesses are often targets for criminal 
activity, and allows proper tracking of fi-
nances for BSA/AML compliance. 
ETA takes no position on the legalization 
or decriminalizing cannabis at the state or 
federal level for medicinal or recreational 
uses. However, ETA does support legislation 
that would resolve the conflict between state 
and federal laws to allow financial institu-
tions to serve cannabis related businesses in 
states where these businesses are legal under 
state law. 
ETA is pleased to support the SAFE Bank-
ing and urges Congress to quickly consider 
this important issue. 
Sincerely, 
JEFF PATCHEN, 
Manager of Government Affairs. 
NATIONAL ARMORED CAR ASSOCIATION,

Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. KEVIN MCCARTHY, 
Minority Leader, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI AND MINORITY LEAD-
ER MCCARTHY: On behalf of the National Ar-
mored Car Association (NACA), I write to ex-
press our support for H.R. 1996, the Secure 
and Fair Enforcement (SAFE) Banking Act 
of 2021. While NACA’s members do not take 
a position in favor of or opposed to the legal-
ization of cannabis or marijuana, we support 
H.R. 1996 because it would address the exist-
ing conflict between federal and state law 
with respect to proceeds from marijuana-re-
lated businesses and allow for safer transpor-
tation, storage and oversite of such proceeds. 
Formed in 1929, NACA is a business asso-
ciation that brings together the three major 
companies of the armored car industry— 
Brink’s, GardaWorld, and Loomis—with a 
focus on protecting and promoting the com-
mon interests of the industry. These three 
organizations comprise approximately 90% 
of the armored car industry in the United 
States, and NACA members have handled 
virtually every dollar and coin in circula-
tion. They provide secure transportation and 
cash management services for the Federal 
Reserve, financial institutions, state and 
local governments, and private businesses 
and individuals across the United States and 
internationally. 
Currently thirty-six states and several ter-
ritories, including the District of Columbia, 
Guam, and Puerto Rico, have legalized the

use of cannabis to some extent. However, 
federal law prohibits cultivation, distribu-
tion, and possession of marijuana imposing 
significant legal risks to financial institu-
tions and ancillary businesses that might 
consider providing financial services to the 
marijuana industry. Consequently, hundreds 
of millions of dollars in cash are being trans-
ported and stored outside our banking sys-
tem and often without adequate security and 
oversight. The lack of available vendors to 
provide secure transport and storage of cash 
increases the risk of criminal activity that 
can pose a danger not only to those involved 
in the cannabis industry, but the general 
public. H.R. 1996 would provide NACA mem-
ber companies with the needed legal protec-
tion and clarity to safely and securely trans-
port cash in states that have legalized and 
regulated cannabis. 
We urge members of the House to support 
H.R. 1996.

DEAR REPRESENTATIVES PERLMUTTER, WAR-
REN, STIVERS, AND VELA´ ZQUEZ: On behalf of 
community banks across the country, with 
more than 52,000 locations, I write to thank 
you for introducing the Secure and Fair En-
forcement Banking Act of 2021 (SAFE Bank-
ing Act). In the last Congress, the SAFE 
Banking Act passed the House by a broad bi-
partisan vote. We are pleased to reiterate 
ICBA ’s strong support for this legislation, 
which is essential for the ongoing ability of 
community banks to effectively serve their 
communities. 
The 2020 election saw Arizona, Montana, 
New Jersey, and South Dakota join 12 states 
and the District of Columbia in fully legal-
izing adult recreational cannabis use. Vir-
ginia followed suit in 2021. Cannabis is legal 
for medical use in 36 states. As more states 
legalize cannabis for medical and/or rec-
reational use, it is critically important that 
cannabis-related businesses (CRBs) have ac-
cess to services provided by the traditional 
banking system. 
The current conflict between state and fed-
eral law with regard to cannabis has created 
increasingly significant legal and compli-
ance concerns for banks that wish to provide 
banking services to CRBs in jurisdictions 
where cannabis is legal. Legal and regu-
latory uncertainty has curtailed access to 
the traditional banking system for CRBs and 
forced them to operate mostly in cash. Cash- 
only businesses, especially those with a high 
volume of revenue, pose a significant risk to 
public safety. 
The SAFE Banking Act would create a safe 
harbor from federal sanctions for financial 
institutions that serve cannabis-related busi-
nesses (CRBs) in states and other jurisdic-
tions where cannabis is legal. Importantly, 
this safe harbor would extend to banks that 
serve the many ancillary businesses that 
serve CRBs such as landlords, accountants, 
utilities providers, and others that may be 
paid in funds ultimately derived from can-
nabis sales. These ancillary businesses may 
be difficult to identify in states that have le-
galized cannabis, and potentially create a 
legal and regulatory challenge for even those 
banks that choose not to serve CRBs di-
rectly. 
Thank you for introducing the SAFE 
Banking Act of 2021. We look forward to 
working with you to advance this important 
legislation. 
Sincerely, 
REBECA ROMERO RAINEY, 
President & CEO.

DEAR REPRESENTATIVES PERLMUTTER, STIV-
ERS, VELA´ ZQUEZ, AND DAVIDSON: The Insured 
Retirement Institute (IRI) writes to express 
our support for H.R. 1996, the Secure and 
Fair Enforcement (SAFE) Banking Act of 
2021. The bill would provide protection and 
insulation from liability for both partici-
pants and institutions offering and admin-
istering retirement plans or individual re-
tirement accounts for the employees of can-
nabis companies and associated businesses 
regulated and licensed by a state. 
Nearly all the states have enacted laws 
which have either legalized or decriminalized 
marijuana for medical and recreational use 
by individuals. As states continue to legalize 
cannabis and license and regulate associated 
industries, projections estimate the legal 
cannabis industry will reach a value of $100 
billion by 2030, a 63.9 percent increase over 
its 2020 estimated worth. With this projected 
financial growth, consequently the number 
of Americans employed in this field is also 
anticipated to rapidly increase. In their Jobs 
Report 2021, Leafy found that the legal mari-
juana industry supports 321,000 full-time 
equivalent jobs as of January 2021. In 2020 
and despite the impacts of the COVID–19 
pandemic, the legal cannabis industry saw a 
32 percent increase in year-over-year job 
growth or more than 77,000 jobs. As a result, 
more Americans are now employed in the 
legal cannabis industry than as electrical en-
gineers, Emergency Medical Technicians, or 
dentists. 
However, as marijuana remains a Schedule 
I Substance under the Controlled Substances 
Act and an illegal substance at the federal 
level, access to essential financial and bank-
ing services is essentially blocked for this 
growing workforce. The risk of running afoul 
of provisions contained in the Bank Secrecy 
Act and federal anti-money laundering laws 
has left many financial institutions unwill-
ing to provide their services to this industry 
including the offering of retirement savings 
plans as a benefit to the employees. 
In addition, we are witnessing a continuing 
shift away from employers providing de-
fined-benefit pensions as a benefit for their 
employees. As a result, the responsibility of 
preparing for retirement is being placed 
squarely on the shoulders of America’s work-
ers. However, recent research conducted by 
IRI has shown that savings rates among 
workers remain low. In fact, only 45 percent 
of Baby Boomers and 40 percent of Genera-
tion Xers have nothing saved for retirement 
and of the Millennials with retirement sav-
ings, half have saved less than $10,000. 
A significant factor contributing to the 
lack of savings is that most workers do not 
have access to an employment-based savings 
plan. Research conducted by the Bureau of 
Labor Statistics has shown that 60 percent of 
full-time workers at small and medium-sized 
businesses—of which many legal cannabis 
businesses would qualify as—do not have ac-
cess to one of the many types of employ-
ment-based retirement plans. 
By simply having access to workplace re-
tirement savings opportunities, workers are 
more likely to participate and save. Accord-
ing to a report by the PEW Charitable Trust, 
72 percent of all workers aged 22 and up who 
are eligible for participation will enroll in a 
workplace defined contribution plan when 
one is offered. Enrollment increases to 85 
percent of those 22 and older and eligible if 
an employer-matching contribution is avail-
able. Enabling workers at small and me-
dium-sized businesses—particularly those in 
an industry growing as rapidly as legal can-
nabis—will help put more of America’s work-
ers on the path toward a financially secured 
and dignified retirement and help alleviate 
the anxiety many are feeling about their fu-
ture financial security during their retire-
ment years. 
IRI has a long history of supporting and 
advocating for the enactment of bipartisan, 
common-sense solutions to help expand op-
portunities for workers to save for their re-
tirement. As such, providing clarity and cer-
tainty to better facilitate the offering of re-
tirement plans for the workers of legally li-
censed cannabis companies through the en-
actment of the SAFE Banking Act was in-
cluded in our 2021 Federal Retirement Secu-
rity Blueprint. As Congress considers this 
legislation to enable greater access to retire-
ment savings for Americans, we welcome the 
opportunity to work with you and your staff 
to advance this measure. 
We thank you for your leadership in pur-
suing this legislation. 
Sincerely, 
PAUL RICHMAN, 
Chief Government and 
Political Affairs Officer.

DEAR REPRESENTATIVES PERLMUTTER, STIV-
ERS, VELA´ ZQUEZ, AND DAVIDSON: We, the un-
dersigned U.S. trade associations, write to 
express support for the SAFE Banking Act of 
2021. Collectively, we represent a majority of 
the companies, agents, and brokers offering 
property-casualty, life, title, and reinsurance 
(collectively, ‘‘insurers’’) in the U.S. We ap-
preciate your leadership in seeking needed 
clarity for insurance transactions related to 
cannabis businesses that are otherwise per-
missible under state law. 
The insurance industry is potentially ex-
posed to liability arising from the dif-
ferences of the legal treatment of cannabis 
and cannabis products under federal and 
state law and regulation at the state level. 
However, with the inclusion of key language 
from the Clarifying Law Around Insurance of 
Marijuana Act, sponsored by Representatives 
Vela´zquez and Stivers and Senators Menen-
dez, Paul, and Merkley, the SAFE Banking 
Act’s safe harbor provisions would prevent 
federal criminal prosecution of and civil li-
ability for agents, brokers, and insurers, 
their officers, directors or employees when 
engaging in the business of insurance in 
states that have legalized cannabis in some 
form. 
By resolving the legal uncertainty pre-
sented by the dueling state and federal treat-
ment of cannabis, the insurance industry can 
serve both cannabis-related legitimate busi-
nesses (CRLBs) and other commercial and 
personal lines consumers who may have a di-
rect or indirect relationship to state-legal-
ized cannabis, and still be in compliance 
with the law. Insurers must also continue to

RECOGNITION OF G. WILLIAM 
WARD 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, April 30, 2021 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor G. William Ward as 
he celebrates his 90th birthday on May 6, 
2021. For decades, Mr. Ward has been a pil-
lar of our Blair County community. 
After serving in the U.S. Navy, Mr. Ward be-
came the President of Ward Transportation 
and Logistics Company in 1966. Within three 
years, Mr. Ward expanded the company to 
more than 500 employees. 
Under his leadership, Ward Transportation 
and Logistics flourished, expanding to new lo-
cations across the Mid-Atlantic region. Mr. 
Ward’s hard work to build his business has 
been invaluable to the growth and economic 
success of our community. 
Throughout his life, Mr. Ward has devoted 
his time and talents to serving his family, our 
nation, and our community. He married his 
wife Carolyn (Williams) in 1953, and they cele-
brated 64 years of marriage before her death 
in 2017. Mr. Ward has five children, 12 grand-
children, and two great-grandchildren. He has 
been a dedicated member of our community, 
serving on many statewide and local boards 
and civic organizations. 
On behalf of the 13th Congressional District 
of Pennsylvania, it is my privilege to recognize 
G. William Ward for his outstanding service to 
our neighbors and our nation. As he cele-
brates this milestone, I wish my friend a very 
happy 90th birthday, as well as continued 
health and happiness.

RECOGNIZING THE REMARKABLE 
LIFE OF DOROTHY M. SWEENY 
HON. SCOTT PERRY 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, April 30, 2021 
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, I’m honored 
and humbled to recognize the remarkable life 
of Mrs. Dorothy M. Sweeney, who left our 
earthly bounds on April 7, 2021. ‘‘Mother 
Sweeney,’’ as she affectionately was called, 
leaves behind an eternal and meaningful leg-
acy not only to her family and loved ones, but 
to the entire York County Community. 
Mother Sweeney’s life began on January 
16, 1934, born to Eddie and Rhoda Hawkins. 
She was the youngest child—and only girl—in 
a household of older brothers, Edward Jr., 
Clyde, and Herman. 
Mother Sweeney married Arthur Sweeney in 
1951, when they planted their roots in York. 
Together, they raised four wonderful chil-
dren—Takanii, Tomoa Tanya, Tanoue Onishi, 
and Arleta Maria—with a resilient sense of 
love and respect for their legacy. 
After a tragic work-related accident claimed 
the life of her beloved husband, Mother 
Sweeney was thrust into single parenthood. 
As obstacles were placed along her path, she 
persevered—like her mother, Rhoda Hawkins. 
Mother Sweeney would go on to graduate 
from York College with a degree in Nursing, 
all while managing a household of four beau-
tiful, albeit sometimes unruly, children. She 
raised her children with a strong and powerful 
image of womanhood. She served as the 
head nurse at York County Homes, and as a 
private duty nurse while also volunteering for 
the local PTA—later serving as its president 
for over six years. She would go on to accept 
a position with Lincoln Intermediate Unit No. 
12 as a teacher for special needs children. 
Mother Sweeney made sure that her chil-
dren knew their elders and family history, 
making sure to surround her daughters with 
family and love, as well as a connection to 
their roots. Her family soon began to grow, as 
her daughters welcomed children of their own. 
Her oldest, Takanii, had 11 children (Damaine, 
Tak, TakaKhan, Asaii, Ishni, Kiya, Azijah, 
Adonysha, Zebulon, Masata, and Amasa), 
Tomoa had four children (Angela, Yahselah, 
Nashon, and Ashir), Tanoue had one son 
(Emneko), and Arleta had five children (Tazaa, 
Taza Todd, Tyleta, T-Hara, and Tynaketa). 
When Mother Sweeney retired profes-
sionally, she certainly was kept busy with 21 
grandchildren—and all the birthdays, holidays, 
and celebrations a large family brings. When 
asked about the number of great-grand-
children she has, Dorothy’s response was, 
‘‘after 10, I stopped counting.’’ The branches 
of her great family tree have continued to 
grow with 45 great-grandchildren—and count-
ing. 
Mother Sweeney was always an energetic 
and active young lady, serving her family, 
church, and community. As a faithful and dedi-
cated member of Emmanuel COGIC in York— 
of which her mother was one of the founding 
members—she has served under founding 
pastor Elder Wise until his home going. Until 
now, Mother Sweeney was the only living 
founding member. Remaining steadfast under 
the leadership of Pastor Leighton McMillan, 
she held various leadership positions, includ-
ing Sunday school teacher, chair of the Pas-
tors Aide Committee, a member of the nurses 
unit, vice president of the Deaconesses, and 
was appointed as Mother of Grace. 
Civically, Mother Sweeney was an active 
member of the State Democratic Committee, 
president of the Democratic Club of York, vice 
president of Lincoln Charter School Board, 
Past Matron of the Queen Esther Temple 
IBPOE, positions in Eastern Stars PJA, 
Daughters of Isis—and numerous other com-
munity 
organizations. 
Whenever 
possible, 
Mother Sweeney loved traveling to Florida to 
be with her ‘‘Sunshine State’’ family—the Bur-
ton/Nealy family, Pastor & First Lady Speed, 
Elder & Mother Combs, Pastor & First Lady 
Mays, Bishop Theadore and First Lady Hall, 
BAM International Fellowship. During the 
COVID–19 pandemic, Mother Sweeney en-
joyed being a part of Hurst Chapel AME Park-
ing Lot Posse, enjoying Sunday morning serv-
ice in the church parking lot. 
Mother Sweeney was a matriarch, a pillar of 
truth, and a true shining light. With words of 
wisdom, her strong Christian values, and her 
loving heart, she guided and nurtured her fam-
ily and her community. She took pride in 
knowing that her beloved family remains 
strong and ever-growing, just as she and Ar-
thur had envisioned. Mother Sweeney was 
and will always be all that a virtuous woman 
should be, and truly sets the standard for all 
to follow. 
With great honor and thanks, I’m humbled 
to acknowledge the life and legacy of Mrs. 
Dorothy M. ‘‘Mother Sweeney’’ of York, Penn-
sylvania. I wish her Godspeed.

INTRODUCTION OF THE VA MEDIC-
INAL CANNABIS RESEARCH ACT 
HON. J. LUIS CORREA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, April 30, 2021 
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, I have met 
with multiple veterans in my congressional dis-
trict who attest to the therapeutic benefits of 
medical cannabis in managing their pain. 
According to the American Legion, a signifi-
cant number of veterans across the country— 
not just in my district—are currently using 
medical cannabis as an alternative treatment. 
With so many veterans using cannabis for 
therapeutic purposes, it is important that phy-
sicians have the information and research 
necessary to fully advice on the potential im-
pacts of medical cannabis usage on post-trau-
matic stress and chronic pain. The U.S. De-
partment of Veterans Affairs is uniquely posi-
tioned to pursue that vital research. 
To that end, I am introducing the bipartisan 
VA Medicinal Cannabis Research Act, which 
requires VA to conduct clinical research on the 
safety and effectiveness of medical cannabis, 
in varying forms and delivery methods, for 
treating veterans diagnosed with post-trau-
matic stress disorder (PTSD) and veterans 
with chronic pain. The legislation requires VA 
to submit annual reports to Congress on the 
implementation of this bill for five years. The 
VA Medicinal Cannabis Research Act is a 
pragmatic and sensible approach to the need 
for additional research and could potentially 
save veterans’ lives.

HONORING 
THE 
LIFE 
OF 
FIRE-
FIGHTER PEYTON MORSE OF LA 
FARGEVILLE, NY 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, April 30, 2021 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of Firefighter Peyton 
Morse of the Watertown Fire Department. On 
March 12, 2021, Peyton tragically passed 
away after suffering a medical emergency dur-
ing a training exercise at the New York State 
Academy of Fire Science. 
Peyton’s lifelong dream was to become a 
firefighter and help others in any way that he 
could. During his time at Siena College, he 
participated in the associate firefighter pro-
gram to gain hands-on experience training 
with the Shaker Road Loudonville Fire Depart-
ment. When he had the opportunity to attend 
the fire academy, Peyton took a leave of ab-
sence from his final semester to pursue his 
passion and eventually became a permanent 
member of the Watertown Fire Department. 
Peyton officially received his firefighter badge, 
Badge No. 94, while hospitalized in the Inten-
sive Care Unit as he fought to recover from 
his tragic accident. 
Peyton’s colleagues remember him as an 
exceptionally dedicated firefighter who was al-
ways enthusiastic in his role. He had a true 
servant’s heart and always put others above 
himself, even after he passed on as an organ 
donor. The recent celebrations of Peyton’s life 
are proof of the impact he made on those in 
his community. Hundreds of North Country 
firefighters, police and other emergency re-
sponders gathered to welcome Peyton’s mo-
torcade home. The community rallied together 
to pay their respects and show their support 
for Peyton’s family by placing yellow hearts in 
the windows of homes and businesses. Siena 
College will posthumously present Peyton’s 
family with his diploma at a ceremonial grad-
uation on May 1, 2021. 
On behalf of New York’s 21st district, I am 
honored to recognize Peyton for his selfless 
service to his community. It is my hope that 
his fearless spirit and positivity will be carried 
on by those who knew and loved him, and I 
ask this House to remember his sacrifice and 
legacy forever.

The 2020 Tiger Cross Country team is the

state title the Tigers were district champions 
with six girls being named all district including 
the

OF 
PRESIDENT 
BIDEN’S 
JOINT ADDRESS TO CONGRESS 
HON. ZOE LOFGREN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, April 30, 2021 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
today to recognize Desseray ‘‘Dez’’ Vega, a 
Program Manager at Alum Rock Counseling 
Center (ARCC) in my Congressional district. I 
was proud to invite Ms. Vega to be my virtual 
guest to President Biden ’s Joint Address to 
Congress on Wednesday, April 28, 2021. 
ARCC provides behavioral health and com-
munity support services for more than 10,000 
children and families in Santa Clara County 
each year. Before the Joint Address, I spoke 
to Ms. Vega about the effect the COVID relief 
bills have had on ARCC, the counselors she 
manages, her clients, and her family. I was 
glad to hear that the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram (PPP) kept ARCC from laying off around 
80 people, helping both the employees and 
their families as well as the children they 
serve. 
Ms. Vega works one-on-one with in-need 
children in San Jose and manages a team of 
15 counselors as part of ARCC’s Prevention 
and Early Intervention program. Ms. Vega 
said, ‘‘I was able to see firsthand how the PPP 
really made a difference. Having income and 
stability helps us [counselors] be more present 
and helps our clients and their families. During 
the pandemic, there has been trauma for the 
families we serve, and everything has been in-
consistent except for the therapy we provide. 
From my personal experience, I’m so grateful’’ 
for COVID relief legislation. 
Madam Speaker, the truth is, it is us who 
should be grateful for Ms. Vega, counselors 
like her. and organizations like ARCC that 
serve our communities. It is my pleasure to 
recognize Ms. Vega and her positive contribu-
tions to the lives of children and families in my 
Congressional district before, during, and after 
the pandemic. I also call on all my colleagues 
to join me in continuing to meet the needs of 
communities across the country during and 
after the COVID–19 pandemic.

HONORING FORT WAYNE WORLD 
WAR II VETERAN DON THEURER) 
HON. JIM BANKS 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, April 30, 2021 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the service of Mr. Don Theurer of Fort 
Wayne. 
Mr. Theurer just celebrated his 100th birth-
day on Monday, April 26. Congratulations on 
this wonderful occasion. I hope his heart is 
filled with joy knowing he has experienced our 
country’s greatest blessings, including the af-
fection of family and friends over a long, well- 
lived life. 
Our Nation owes Mr. Theurer a debt of grat-
itude for his dedicated service to our country. 
Serving in the United States Army during 
World War II, he landed at Normandy less 
than 20 days after D-Day, saw combat in Hol-
land and took part in the Allied liberation of 
Western Europe and occupation of Germany. 
After the war, Theurer returned home to 
northeast Indiana, where he attended college, 
married his sweetheart Thelma, and began 
work at Magnavox, for whom he would work 
the entirety of his career. A longtime, active 
member of Messiah Lutheran Church, Theurer 
today remains in good health, as he reads 
daily and drives frequently. 
As one of the oldest veterans in Indiana, I, 
and the entirety of Congress, send to him best 
wishes as he celebrates this historic mile-
stone. 
The story of Don Theurer is the story of 
American greatness. As a patriot who served 
his country in war and community in peace, 
this record is a testament to his commitment 
to the American people and ideals to which 
our Nation strive.

INTRODUCTION 
OF 
IMPROVING 
MENTAL HEALTH ACCESS FOR 
STUDENTS ACT OF 2021 
HON. J. LUIS CORREA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, April 30, 2021 
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, unfortu-
nately, in 2017, there were more than 47,000 
suicides nationwide, making it the tenth-lead-
ing cause of death. The COVID–19 pandemic 
has only worsened an already serious prob-
lem. 
Tragically, among teenagers and young 
adults, the suicide rate is particularly alarming, 
with suicide the second-leading cause of 
death for people between the ages of 15 and 
24. 
For people experiencing suicidal thoughts or 
emotional distress, the National Suicide Pre-
vention Lifeline and Crisis Text Line provide 
free and confidential round-the-clock support. 
Many colleges and universities also offer men-
tal health resources on campus. 
To raise awareness of these available re-
sources, the bill simply requires colleges and 
universities to provide the contact information 
for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline; 
Crisis Text Line; and a campus mental health 
center, if applicable, on student identification 
cards. For colleges and universities that do 
not provide identification cards to their stu-
dents, schools must ensure that the informa-
tion is available on their website. 
Suicide is a major public health problem. 
Providing information on existing suicide pre-
vention resources can help students experi-
encing suicidal thoughts or emotional distress 
and potentially save lives.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 100TH 
BIRTHDAY OF HELEN BANDYKE 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, April 30, 2021 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Helen Bandyke of Dear-
born on the occasion of her 100th birthday. 
Her contributions to our community as a Rosie 
the Riveter are worthy of commendation. 
Born in Detroit, Michigan on March 29, 
1921, Mrs. Bandyke attended Cass Technical 
High School, but moved to Dearborn in 1952 
with her young family to be closer to her sister 
May. During World War II she worked at the 
Chrysler DeSoto factory building warplanes 
while her husband Ted served in the war. 
Mrs. Bandyke recalls being told by her su-
pervisors to ‘‘slow down’’ as she was working 
too fast for the production line. To this day she 
objects to the request because she was deter-
mined to singlehandedly win the war and bring 
her husband home. Beyond her efficient riv-
eting of the plane wings, she frequently gave 
blood at the Red Cross. As a Rosie the Riv-
eter, Helen’s hard work, grit, and patriotism 
not only sustained the American war effort, but 
paved a path for the next generation of work-
ing women. After her time on the factory floor 
ended, she worked as an optician until the 
age of 81. 
An active member of her church, St. 
Anselm’s Parish in Dearborn Heights, Mr. and 
Mrs. Bandyke served as chaperones for the 
teen club. She is known for being a friendly 
face at the Arab American Museum and 
Wayne County Regional Library for the Blind 
and 
Physically 
Handicapped, 
where 
she 
served as a volunteer. Her lifelong commit-
ment to service reminds us all of the impact 
that the Rosies have had on our state and na-
tion. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me today in celebrating Helen Bandyke on her 
100th birthday. I join with her family—including 
her three children Sylvia, Mary, and Martin— 
and friends in extending my best and warmest 
wishes to her on this special day. I am proud 
to honor her life, her accomplishments, and 
her invaluable contributions to our nation.
