July 1, 2022 
IN HONOR OF WINSTON EYE AND 
VISION CENTER’S 80TH ANNIVER-
SARY 
HON. TIM BURCHETT 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 1, 2022 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
celebrate Winston Eye and Vision Center for 
its 80 years of business serving the wonderful 
people of the Knoxville community. 
In 1942, Dr. Harold J. Winston moved to 
Knoxville to start an optometry practice and 
create a good life for himself, his new wife, 
and the children they planned to have to-
gether. Decades later, the center enabled him 
to work alongside two of his sons, Jerry and 
Barry Winston, who followed in their father’s 
footsteps and joined his practice after receiv-
ing their doctorates in optometry. 
The practice expanded to three generations 
in 2011 when Harold’s grandson, Dr. Samuel 
A. Winston, joined the practice. A few short 
months later, in December 2011, Dr. Harold 
Winston passed away, but his legacy and 
practice are carried on by his sons and grand-
son who continue to run the business that 
brought him such great joy during his life. 
Congratulations to the Winston family, em-
ployees, and everyone involved in helping 
Winston Eye and Vision Center serve mem-
bers of our great community for the past 80 
years.

PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
HON. PETER WELCH 
OF VERMONT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 1, 2022 
Mr. WELCH. Madam Speaker, I was unable

THANKING VELMON WASHINGTON 
FOR HIS SERVICE TO THE U.S. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
HON. STENY H. HOYER 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 1, 2022 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
thank Velmon Washington for his twenty-two 
years of dedicated service as an employee of 
this House. Mr. Washington began his service 
with the Office of the Clerk in October 2000 as 
a Data Processing Specialist, and he was in 
that position for three years before being pro-
moted to an Assistant Requisitions and Print-
ing Clerk. Most recently, he was made Senior 
Requisitions and Printing Clerk. Mr. Washing-
ton’s service with the Office of the Clerk caps 
eighteen years of outstanding service. I con-
gratulate him on his retirement at the end of 
June. 
Mr. Washington’s many years of experience 
made him an expert in the inner workings of 
the Clerk’s Office and the operations it over-
sees. He has worked directly with customers 
from Member and House Committee offices, 
supplying them with official letterhead and 
other important materials needed to serve 
constituents effectively. Mr. Washington also 
provided valuable assistance to many of the 
divisions within the Clerk’s organization, in-
cluding the Office of Communications and the 
Clerk’s personal office in support of special 
projects. He was responsible for keeping track 
of dozens of requisitions every week using a 
unique requisitions website, and, for each new 
Congress, 
Mr. 
Washington 
prepared 
for 
months in advance to assemble—and often 
hand deliver—materials to all new Members 
on their first day in session. 
Madam Speaker, outside of work Mr. Wash-
ington is a dedicated husband and father. He 
inspired his two children with patriotism and 
public service, and both have served in our 
nation’s Armed Forces—something that makes 
him very, very proud. I thank Mr. Washington 
for his dedication, his love of country, and for 
his many years of service to the Clerk’s Office, 
and I wish him all the best in his retirement. 
I hope my colleagues will all join me in ex-
pressing the gratitude of this House and offer-
ing our congratulations.

COMMEMORATING THE LIFE OF 
THE REV. DR. B.R. DANIELS, SR. 
HON. MARC A. VEASEY 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 1, 2022 
Mr. VEASEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to commemorate the life of Reverend Dr. B. R. 
Daniels, Sr. Daniels was a loving husband, fa-
ther, grandfather, great-grandfather, pastor, 
and teacher best known for his service to the 
Beth-Eden Missionary Baptist Church commu-
nity. After spending almost four years at the 
Saint John Baptist Church in Avalon, Texas, 
Reverend Daniels started his pastorate at 
Beth-Eden in December of 1972, there were 
37 members on the roll and only 18 active 
members. Within a year, the church had 
grown to 196 congregants. After serving the 
church for a record-breaking 50 years, Beth- 
Eden Missionary Baptist Church included well 
over 400 members. The success of Beth-Eden 
Missionary Baptist Church testifies to the love 
Reverend Daniels poured into the community 
and the devotion with which they reciprocated. 
While he led the Church through years of 
prosperity, a 3.2 million dollar building pro-
gram was completed. This exemplifies the 
long-lasting legacies he will leave for decades 
to come. 
Not only was Reverend Daniels a man of 
love, but also a man of action. During his life, 
he held many positions on the local, state, and 
national levels. He served as Assistant Sec-
retary of the Evangelistic Department of the 
National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc. for four 
years, and for 15 years, he served as Moder-
ator of the Northwestern District Baptist Asso-
ciation where he recently served as Vice Mod-
erator. He also proudly served as President of 
the BM&E State Convention of Texas and re-
tired from it in March 2022. Additionally, Rev-
erend Daniels was Vice President-at-Large of 
the BM&E State Convention of Texas, a mem-
ber of the Board of Directors of Southern Bible 
Institute and served on the Zoning Commis-
sion of the City of Fort Worth. 
No one can truly know how many people’s 
lives he touched with his daily doses of wis-
dom. This week, my district not only lost an 
extraordinarily talented pastor but, more im-
portantly, we lost a truly good man who con-
tributed so much to our community.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
EXEMPLARY 
CONTRIBUTIONS 
OF 
JON 
J.P. 
FERNANDEZ TO THE COMMUNITY 
OF GUAM AS SUPERINTENDENT 
OF EDUCATION 
HON. MICHAEL F.Q. SAN NICOLAS 
OF GUAM 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 1, 2022 
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize an exemplary leader and 
public servant, Mr. Jon J.P. Fernandez, and 
congratulate him for over a decade of service 
to the People of Guam as Superintendent of 
Education. I would like to further commend 
him for his distinguished advocacy, commit-
ment to community, and investment in the fu-
ture of our island, region, nation, and world as 
demonstrated throughout his tenure at the 
helm of the Guam Department of Education 
(GDOE). 
In navigating a unique path to public serv-
ice, Superintendent Fernandez first earned a 
bachelor’s degree in philosophy from the Uni-
versity of Arkansas in 1995. He then went on 
to obtain his master’s in public policy from 
Harvard University and, by 2005, gained a 
Juris Doctor from Georgetown University. 
Building the foundations for an accomplished 
career, Superintendent Fernandez served as a 
Senior Analyst in Strategic Consulting for CB

first WASC school district to gain accreditation 
for all its schools, achieved nine consecutive 
clean financial and compliance audits, re-
moved four of its seven special compliance 
conditions imposed by the USDOE, founded 
its first K–5 CHamoru language immersion 
program, created vital credit recovery pro-
grams for Guam’s two success academies, 
established a new Tiyan High School, ex-
panded Okkodo High School, and renovated 
Untalan Middle School. Outside of improved 
standards and instruction, he has also spear-
headed the integration of technology and 
STEM in the classroom, expansion of pro-
grams that promote college and career readi-
ness, and a bolstered school-based behavioral 
health support system while securing acco-
lades such as two MagPro Best Government 
Large Agency of the Year awards, three Pika’s 
Best Government Agency of the Year awards, 
and the 2019 Professor John M. Phillips Ex-
cellence in Government Accountability Award. 
Moreover, amid the unprecedented COVID–19 
pandemic, Superintendent Fernandez cata-
lyzed comprehensive community support to in-
clude launching school meal and community 
feeding sites, implementing distance learning, 
ensuring safe practices and protocols in all 
schools, mobilizing vaccination clinics for em-
ployees and students, and pushing for stu-
dents to return to the classroom. 
Beyond these organizational triumphs, Su-
perintendent Fernandez further realized his-
toric personal achievements. In addition to 
holding the titles as both GDOE’s longest- 
serving superintendent since World War II and 
the 
nation’s 
longest-tenured 
Chief 
State 
School Officer, he is the first superintendent 
from Guam to serve as Commissioner for the 
Accrediting Commission for Schools (WASC) 
and be elected to the Board of Directors of the 
Council of Chief State School Officers. 
Madam Speaker, I rise on behalf of the 
People of Guam, offering my greatest appre-
ciation to Superintendent Jon J. P. Fernandez 
for over ten years of invaluable service to gen-
erations of students and their families. His re-
solve to stand up quality education and youth 
support systems, advance departmental and 
interagency 
collaborations, 
and 
cultivate 
meaningful connections at the intersections of 
education, community, and civic involvement 
has transformed the foothold of our collective 
progress and continues to inspire many 
throughout our island, and I wish him and his 
family the best during the next chapter of their 
lives.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF CLELA ROREX 
HON. JOE NEGUSE 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 1, 2022 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in remembrance of a proud Coloradan, a 
champion for equality and a beacon of hope in 
our community, Clela Rorex, who passed 
away on June 19, 2022. 
Clela served her state honorably as the 
Clerk & Recorder for Boulder County from 
1975 to 1977. Early in her tenure, in 1975, 
she became the first county clerk in the nation 
to issue a marriage license to a same-sex 
couple. And in so doing, she changed the 
lives of countless families across the country. 
Clela firmly believed in equality under the law, 
and was a proud champion for justice and in-
clusion, believing that every American’s free-
dom to live without fear of discrimination must 
be protected. 
Clela was truly a pillar in our community and 
a symbol of hope for families across our coun-
try. My thoughts and prayers are with her fam-
ily and all those who knew and loved her. 
As we mourn her passing, we will remember 
her life and be inspired by her devotion to 
making this world a better place.

CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTEC-

HON. JOHN KATKO 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 1, 2022 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, the mission 
of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) 
is broad and diverse. The more than 60,000 
men and women of CBP protect our borders 
at and between our ports of entry. They pro-
tect Americans against terrorists and the in-
struments of terror. They enforce our laws and 
help boost our economic security and pros-
perity by facilitating trade and travel. While the 
roles they play each day may differ, the men 
and women of CBP share one common goal: 
to keep our country a safe, secure, and resil-
ient place where the American way of life can 
thrive. They provide selfless service to our 
country, and they do so with honor and dis-
tinction under an ever-present and evolving 
threat. I wish to pay tribute to the agents, offi-
cers and employees who have given the ulti-
mate sacrifice in the service of our Nation by 
honoring 37 courageous men and women of 
CBP who have died in the line of duty. Today 
we commemorate these brave men and 
women, celebrate their lives, and offer their 
families and loved ones our continued support. 
They have earned the respect and apprecia-
tion of a grateful nation. I include in the

Mr. WELCH. Madam Speaker, I rise today

impact of the Vermont Institute of Natural 
Science (VINS) in Quechee, VT. I would also 
like to congratulate them as they celebrate 
their 50 Year Anniversary. Since their opening

on the beautiful wildlife in our state and what 
we can do to conserve it. The organization 
and its staff have shown a remarkable com-
mitment to research, conservation and edu-
cation. 
The genesis of VINS can be traced back to 
David Laughlin, who spearheaded a study of 
the Ottauquechee River in central Vermont. 
The river was found to be badly polluted by 
waste and runoff. Joining Dr. Laughlin’s efforts 
were his wife Sally Laughlin, Rick Farrar, and 
June McKnight. The group’s efforts ultimately 
led to the first water quality litigation in the 
state of Vermont. The group built on the mo-
mentum from the victorious river cleanup, re-
maining vigilant in their commitment to pre-
serving the river’s future. Their brainstorming 
culminated into the idea to establish an envi-
ronmental organization aimed at educating 
young children. Thus, came the Vermont Insti-
tute of Natural Science in 1972. 
Since its founding, VINS’ mission has 
stressed education as a critical tool in chang-
ing perspectives and maintaining a healthy en-
vironment. Early on, Sally Laughlin led the 
charge to establish a bird-banding project with 
the help of her experienced colleague, Rick 
Farrar. The bird banding program, educational 
activities, and the river clean-up, established 
VINS as a critical Vermont institution. 
Today, VINS is defined by its environmental 
and education focus at the VINS Nature Cen-
ter, with 35 exhibit and education raptors uti-
lized in daily live education programs from a 
trained educator’s hand; the Forest Canopy 
Walk and Outdoor Classroom; the ADA trail 
network; VINS School Programs, which reach 
3,400 students and 600 teachers each year; 
the Adventure Playscape; and the Center for 
Wild Bird Rehabilitation. The rehabilitation 
center treats injured birds found throughout 
the state with the eventual goal of releasing 
them back into the wild. The center treated a 
record of 1,098 birds last year alone. Those 
birds which cannot be released safely are kept 
at VINS’ Nature Center as ‘‘ambassadors’’ for 
their species to help educate curious visitors. 
As Executive Director Charles Rattigan 
takes VINS into its next 50 years, the institute 
remains a sought-after destination for visitors 
and residents of Vermont and the Upper Val-
ley. This year alone, over 69,000 visitors 
passed through its gates to learn about 
raptors, native species and the environments 
in which they live. Curious people of all ages 
learned how to actively care for our natural 
world, helping to fulfill VINS’ crucial mission of 
motivating individuals and communities to care 
for their environment. I want to recognize 
VINS for its passionate commitment to edu-
cation, research and avian wildlife rehabilita-
tion. VINS continues to be an influential stew-
ard of the natural world, in Vermont and be-
yond.

INTRODUCTION OF H. RES. 1086 
HON. BRIAN HIGGINS 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 1, 2022 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to speak on the importance of 
commemorating the 50th anniversary of U.S.- 
Bangladesh relations. In my district, my home-
town of Buffalo, New York hosts a significant 
Bangladeshi population that contributes to Buf-
falo’s rich cultural diversity and helps the city 
live up to its moniker as the City of Good 
Neighbors. I am proud to be representing the 
more than 10,000 Bangladeshi constituents in 
my district, and recently introduced H. Res. 
1086 honoring the 50th anniversary of U.S.- 
Bangladesh relations. 
The United States recognized the independ-
ence of Bangladesh on April 4, 1972. Since 
then, our two nations have cooperated on a 
myriad of issues, including the protection of 
Rohingya refugees fleeing genocide, the fight 
against the COVID–19 pandemic, and the 
continuation of a peaceful and inclusive Indo- 
Pacific region. 
The past thirty-five years have witnessed an 
influx of Bangladeshi immigrants to the United 
States, making the group the fastest growing 
Asian-American population in the country. In 
Buffalo, these individuals have established vi-
brant communities all over the city, with a spe-
cific concentration on the East Side including 
the neighborhoods of Broadway-Fillmore, Gen-
esee Moselle, Fillmore-Leroy, and Kensington. 
Members of the Bangladeshi community have 
started businesses, are renovating vacant 
homes, and are enriching the fabric of our re-
gion through their cultural contributions. 
The Bangladeshi population has made it a 
priority to foster a sense of community and 
cultural identity among its members. It has 
founded organizations such as the Ban-
gladesh Society of Buffalo and the Buffalo 
Bangla Newspaper with this particular goal in 
mind. Furthermore, the ranks of Bengali- 
speaking students enrolled in Buffalo Public 
Schools have continued to swell, and I am 
grateful to see to this cross-cultural coopera-
tion in our city. 
I 
look 
forward 
to 
welcoming 
further 
Bangladeshi immigrants to the United States 
and continue to admire the unique perspec-
tives and experiences they bring to our nation. 
Madam Speaker, I am grateful to express my 
deep appreciation for the long-standing rela-
tionship and cooperation between the United 
States and Bangladesh.

HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 1, 2022 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. 
Madam Speaker, with the passage of the Bi-
partisan Safer Communities Act, Congress 
has come together to address the deadly gun 
violence epidemic that has plagued our com-
munities and the innocent children in them for 
far too long. The Act will finally codify en-
hanced background checks for individuals 
under 21, fund mental health and school safe-
ty, provide incentives for states to implement 
‘‘red flag’’ laws, limit the ‘‘boyfriend loophole’’ 
and prohibit the straw purchasing and traf-
ficking of firearms—a provision that I have 
worked on for over a decade. This legislation 
represents one of the most significant steps 
Congress has taken to reduce gun violence in 
nearly 30 years. The American public and its 
children will be safer because of the passage 
of this groundbreaking bipartisan bill and the 
legacy of this legislation will resonate for years 
to come.

IN RECOGNITION OF HELEN 
PRATHER 
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 1, 2022 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, today I want to 
recognize and celebrate Ms. Helen Prather, a 
long-time resident of Detroit in Michigan’s 13th 
Congressional District as she celebrates a 
milestone, her one hundred fifth birthday. 
Born in 1917, Ms. Prather was one of ten 
siblings in her close-knit family. She grew up 
in the heart of Detroit near Grand River. In her 
youth and throughout her life, Ms. Prather was 
a tireless fighter for advancement and protec-
tion of civil rights. She was also especially 
proud of her long career in social services, 
from which she retired at the age of eighty- 
eight. 
Ms. Prather has always valued her family 
life. She raised her children in Detroit along-
side her dear husband Joseph, to whom she 
was happily married for more than sixty years 
until his death in 2005. Ms. Prather has been 
an anchoring presence in her family, remain-
ing 
steadfast 
in 
her 
love 
for 
her 
multigenerational family, which includes her 
grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and great- 
great grandchild. 
Ms. Helen Prather is truly cherished by her 
family, friends, and neighbors. Please join me 
in wishing her a very happy birthday, sur-
rounded by love and light.

TRIBUTE TO THE 2022 STANLEY 
CUP WINNERS COLORADO AVA-
LANCHE 
HON. DIANA DeGETTE 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 1, 2022 
Ms. DEGETTE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today, along with my colleagues: Congress-
man ED
PERLMUTTER, Congressman KEN 
BUCK, Congressman JOE NEGUSE, Congress-
man JASON
CROW, and Congresswoman 
LAUREN BOEBERT, to recognize the best team 
in U.S. hockey, the Colorado Avalanche. We 
make this tribute after the Avalanche clinched 
the 2022 Stanley Cup with their Game 6 vic-
tory over the Tampa Bay Lightning on Sunday, 
June 26, 2022. 
For fans of the Colorado Avalanche, who 
have patiently waited for more than 20 years 
to see our favorite team triumphantly raise the 
Stanley Cup again, the journey to Sunday 
night’s victory has been long but worth the 
wait. We have watched this team battle 
through setbacks and injuries with admirable 
grit and determination, culminating this year in 
a 16–4 post-season record and a well-de-
served trophy. 
To secure their spot in the Stanley Cup 
Finals, the Avalanche overcame formidable 
teams, including their Western Conference 
challengers the Edmonton Oilers, who they 
swept in four games to advance to the Finals. 
There, they defeated the two-time defending

champions, the Lightning, in an exciting six- 
game series. The Avalanche took an early 2– 
0 lead in the series after notching wins in 
Games 1 and 2. Then, after suffering a loss in 
Game 3, a nail-biting overtime win in Game 4, 
and another loss in Game 5, the Avalanche 
emerged as victors in a well-played and hard- 
fought Game 6. 
Truly, the credit for this team’s incredible 
victory goes to the combined talent, drive, and 
sacrifice made by each player and member of 
the coaching staff and management. The im-
mense skill and leadership demonstrated by 
this special group of players and coaches, 
both on and off the ice, is extraordinary. 
On behalf of Avalanche fans everywhere, 
especially those in our home state of Colo-
rado, we are incredibly proud to celebrate this 
team’s tremendous victory; to have the Stan-
ley Cup back in Colorado—exactly where it 
belongs; and to cheer on the nation’s best 
hockey team to even more victories in the fu-
ture: Go Avs Go.

Friday, July 1, 2022 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the 165th anniversary of ‘‘The Old 
Cathedral,’’ SS. Peter & Paul Catholic Church, 
in Alton, Illinois. The church, completed in 
1857, remains a beautiful example of Gothic 
architecture in the Metro East region. On Jan-
uary 9, 1857, the Diocese Episcopal See was 
transferred to Alton from Quincy, and the Most 
Reverend Henry Damien Junker became Al-
ton’s first bishop. The Most Reverend Peter 
Baltes succeeded him in 1870, followed by the 
third and final Bishop of Alton, the Most Rev-
erend James Ryan, in 1886. Below the church 
are the tombs of the first two bishops of the 
Diocese of Alton. During its life as the Diocese 
Cathedral, our country was torn apart at the 
seams by Civil War, was reunited, and then 
grew into a global power. We celebrated the 
St. Louis World’s Fair, saw our dirt roads 
paved over, and had our lives changed by rev-
olutionary inventions. In 2015, the SS. Peter & 
Paul Parish had a beautiful carillon installed in 
the bell tower to beckon all to come and wor-
ship. Madam Speaker, please join me in rec-
ognizing the 165th anniversary of ‘‘The Old 
Cathedral,’’ SS. Peter & Paul Catholic Church, 
and celebrating its many contributions to Alton 
and the surrounding communities.

KEIRA NICOLE LIPP 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 1, 2022 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Keira Nicole Lipp for 
achieving the new world record for youngest 
person to ski on all seven continents. 
Keira first learned to ski in her home state 
of Colorado at just two years old. She began 
exploring the slopes of the Rocky Mountains 
and then went on to ski in Italy (Europe), Aus-
tralia, South Korea (Asia), Morocco (Africa), 
and Antarctica. To prepare for the toughest 
continent in the world, Antarctica, Keira need-
ed to ski at an expert-level and be comfortable 
skiing backcountry. She skied two different 
sides of a nunatak in Antarctica on February 
1, 2022. And with her father and brother by 
her side, Keira conquered the snowy slopes of 
Portillo, Chile, skiing her 7th continent at just 
ten years old and breaking the world record— 
a tremendous and inspiring feat! 
As a courageous elementary school student 
from Golden, Colorado, Keira has shown im-
mense perseverance and determination. She 
has put in countless hours of training even in 
the summer months when ski resorts were 
closed, skiing small glaciers and permanent 
snowfields. 
She is now currently working on her next 
goal of becoming a better skier than her father 
while she is still a kid. I cannot wait to see all 
of her future accomplishments and I wish her 
all the best.

IN HONOR OF THE LIFE OF MR. 
SEAN SANFORD SIMS 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 1, 2022 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in honor of the life of Sean Sanford 
Sims who passed away on June 19, 2022. His 
honorable service to our country, the state of 
Michigan, and to our local community is wor-
thy of commendation. 
Mr. Sims was born on December 28, 1970, 
to Shirley Ann and Walter Sims of Detroit, 
Michigan. He was the brother of Willie Erwin. 
In 1989, after graduating from Chadsey High 
School, he heard the call of his Nation and en-
listed in the United States Marine Corps. Dur-
ing his time of military duty, he courageously 
served in the Persian Gulf and Desert Storm 
Wars, rising to the rank of Lance Corporal at 
the time of his honorable discharge. After 
completing his military service, he returned 
home and went on to receive his higher edu-
cation degrees, earning a bachelor’s degree in 
Sociology and a master’s degree in Social 
Work, both from Wayne State University. 
A dedicated member of his community, Mr. 
Sims was employed by the State of Michigan 
after his time in the military. Since 2000, he 
worked as a Veteran Career Advisor within the 
Department of Labor and Economic Oppor-
tunity 
at 
Michigan 
Works! 
in 
Ypsilanti. 
Throughout his career, he touched the lives of 
many, changing their path for good. He pro-
vided training, counseling, and case manage-
ment to Michigan veterans in Washtenaw 
County and from around southeast Michigan. 
Mr. Sims was a reliable, kind man that 
cared deeply about his friends and family. He 
enjoyed meeting and talking to all kinds of 
people, was committed to public service, and 
always made sure to make time for those he 
cared about. Mr. Sims enjoyed the little things 
in life and always finding something to laugh 
about. He resided in Ann Arbor and was a fa-
ther figure to those who knew him, including 
Patrick. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the life of Mr. Sean Sanford 
Sims. He was a dedicated veteran, a true pub-
lic servant, and most importantly—a friend to 
all. He will be deeply missed, and our 
thoughts are with his family and friends at this 
time.

HONORING MATTHEW SMITH 
HON. DONALD S. BEYER, JR. 
OF VIRGINIA

Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I am pleased 
to rise today, and I ask my Colleagues to join 
me in paying tribute to Matthew Smith for 
more than 35 years of dedicated service to the 
United States House of Representatives. 
Mr. Smith began his service with the Office 
of the Clerk in December 1986 as an Office 
Supply Clerk where he served in that position 
for 2 years. Matthew was subsequently pro-
moted to the Records and Registration sec-
tion, still within the Clerk’s organization, where 
for the next 5 years he served in three dif-
ferent capacities which included the following 
positions, Processing Clerk, Microfilmer Clerk

In July of 1995, Matthew transitioned to the 
Clerk’s Legislative Resource Center where he 
served as General Clerk, an Assistant Reg-
istration and Compliance Clerk, and in his 
most recent capacity, as a Public Information 
Specialist, where he has served for the last 19

an important asset to the House Document

Digibinder. Over the years, Matt’s patience

molding him into an excellent coach to the 
new employees on all relevant processes; and 
Matt has helped considerably by drafting and 
sharing step-by-step instructions on many of 
these processes. 
Matthew is a dedicated husband and father. 
He frequently speaks fondly of his daughter 
who is the joy of his life. Matthew is very pas-
sionate about his own physical fitness, and he 
enjoys playing basketball; and over the years, 
Matthew has participated in several mara-
thons. 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased for this op-
portunity to acknowledge Matthew Smith for 
his outstanding service to the United States

This District of Columbia tradition takes 
place during the first full week of summer 
each year and brings together tens of thou-
sands D.C. area families and visitors to the 
nation’s capital in the spirit of unity, community 
and celebration. 
After two years of virtual events, the Giant 
National Capital Barbecue Battle returned to 
Pennsylvania Avenue on June 25, 2022, fea-

has raised millions of dollars for D.C. charities 
and USO-Metro over the past 30 years and 
donated food to food banks. 
This event draws some of D.C.’s and the 
nation’s best barbecue talent, and the partici-
pants represent D.C. wherever state barbecue 
cooking championship winners are welcomed. 
Madam Speaker, again, I ask the House of 
Representatives to join me in recognizing the 
aims and goals of the Giant National Capital 
Barbecue Battle.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
RETIREMENT 
OF MONSIGNOR JOHN CISEWSKI 
PASTOR 
HON. TROY A. CARTER 
OF LOUISIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 1, 2022 
Mr. CARTER of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize Monsignor John 
Cisewski, from the Archdiocese of New Orle-
ans after 51 years of leading God’s people as 
a priest of Jesus Christ. 
Monsignor Cisewski was born in the Upper 
Peninsula of Iron Wood, Michigan to late Wal-
ter and Sophia Jean Cisewski. He will be join-
ing the ranks of retirement along-side all his 
living siblings, Wally, Jim ‘‘Choo’’, Kay and 
Judy, all who have been retired in various 
fields for many years. 
Monsignor Cisewski pronounced first vows 
and was ordained to the priesthood on Octo-
ber 16, 1971, at St. Philip the Apostle Catholic 
Church located in the Ninth Ward, Desire area 
in New Orleans. He studied at Notre Dame 
Seminary in New Orleans after completing 
graduate work with degrees in Master of Arts 
Theology and Master of Divinity. He then be-
came the Associate Pastor of St. Philip the 
Apostle, followed by St. Gabriel the Archangel 
Catholic Church in Pontchartrain Park. 
Forty-two years ago, Monsignor Cisewski 
rose to the ranks of pastor on March 17, 1980, 
at St. Monica Catholic Church. He later contin-
ued his ministry as pastor serving many par-
ishes including St. Matthias Catholic Church; 
Our Lady of Lourdes (serving as dual pastor 
of two churches); St. Leo the Great Catholic 
Church, subsequently serving a pastor of the 
merged St. Raymond St. Leo the Great Catho-
lic Church because of Hurricane Katrina; and 
his final assignment at St. Katharine Drexel 
Catholic Church in 2008, also created in the 
aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, merging Holy 
Ghost Catholic Church and St. Francis 
DeSales Catholic Church. 
Recognizing the great impact Monsignor 
Cisewski has on the many parishioners 
throughout Orleans Parish, he was selected to 
serve on Priests Council for three terms, the 
Priests Personnel Committee for seven years, 
over twenty years appointed by then tenured 
Archbishops as Dean in the Inner-City Dean-
ery, City Park/Gentilly Deanery and twice for 
the University Deanery. 
During the 1970’s, Monsignor Cisewski 
taught Theology at St. Augustine High School 
and as Chaplain at Xavier University Pre-
paratory High School, serving the youth in our 
community. 
Monsignor Cisewski went beyond his spir-
itual calling to leave his footprint on this city 
on community growth. He completed a grad-
uate degree with a master’s degree in urban 
studies at the University of New Orleans. He 
worked closely with the parishioners of St. 
Philip the Apostle Catholic Church to establish 
the Desire Social Center in the Desire Hous-
ing Development area. He later worked closely 
with the parishioners and residents in Pont-
chartrain Park and Gentilly Woods creating the 
Pontilly Neighborhood Association, one of the 
most active neighborhood groups still in exist-
ence to this day. 
And if you thought his plate was full, his 
service furthered having served as an active 
member over fifty years of the Knights of 
Peter Claver; the Faith Friar to E.O. Moss 
Grand Assembly No. 4 and also to M.L. 
Lunnon Grand Chapter No. 4. His tenure in-
cludes serving on the National Committee fa-
cilitating the establishment of the Fourth De-
gree for the Gracious Ladies of the Knights of 
Peter Claver, Inc. (Auxiliary). 
A huge Congratulations and Best Wishes to 
Louisiana’s adopted Son as he begins a 
much-deserved retirement effective the first 
day of July, in the year two thousand twenty- 
two.

HON. PETER WELCH

Mr. WELCH. Madam Speaker, I was unable

IN RECOGNITION OF CURTIS PAUL 
RAMSEY 
HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 1, 2022 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the memory of Curtis Paul 
Ramsey. A lifelong educator, Ramsey, spent 
every chance he had sharing his wisdom with 
others. 
On November 24, 1926, Curtis was born in 
Denton, Texas. In his early years, he became 
a member of Boy Scout Troop 65. He then 
earned the ranking Eagle Scout and later at-
tended the Troops 100th celebration in 2018. 
Curtis also was a member of the First United 
Methodist Church. He spent his time teaching 
adult Sunday school and serving as a youth 
counselor. 
Ramsey graduated from Denton Senior High 
School. He attended North Texas State Col-
lege, now known as the University of North 
Texas (UNT), where he was elected the 1950 
Senior Class President. He earned a bach-
elor’s degree in Biology and Psychology, and 
completed a master’s degree in Curriculum 
and Guidance at the same campus. His pur-
suit of education didn’t stop as he then earned 
his Ph.D. in Education at George Peabody 
College for Teachers in Nashville. During his 
time at Peabody, Curtis conducted research 
with the hopes of improving educational out-
comes. 
Curtis served in World War II as a company 
clerk in Japan, later returning with a great ap-
preciation for the Japanese people, their art 
and their culture. 
His passion for education followed once he 
returned to the states. After the Brown vs. 
Board of Education decision, a Peabody Grant 
allowed Curtis to aid de-segregated school 
districts. Dr. Ramsey served as Chairman of 
the Elementary Education Department at Kent 
State University and in the Bridgeport and 
Stamford schools while advocating for Cleve-
land area schools. He then served as the 
Dean of the College of Education at the Uni-
versity of Bridgeport in Connecticut. His pas-
sion took him overseas as he taught at the Bir 
Zeit University as a Distinguished Visiting Pro-
fessor in Education and Psychology. 
Upon his return to Denton, he taught at 
Texas Women’s University while serving on 
Denton’s ISD School Board. His passion for 
education was demonstrated on the state and 
national level as he served on the Leadership 
TASB (Texas Association of School Boards) 
and with the Texas Legislative Taskforce lob-
bying in D.C. 
Curtis treated the students of Denton ISD as 
his own. He was a beloved father to Rebecca 
Ramsey Lindrose, Cynthia Ramsey Despot, 
Dawn Ramsey, and Victoria Ramsey, and a 
devoted husband to Virginia Mary Ramsey. He 
was a proud grandfather of four grandchildren 
and a great-grandfather to six great-grand-
children. 
Curtis Ramsey’s positive impact spread be-
yond the city of Denton and Denton ISD. Ev-
erywhere he went, he shared himself person-
ally and professionally. He was a father, a 
husband, a grandfather, a friend, a son, a 
Denton native, and most of all, a respected 
and dedicated educator.

IN SPECIAL RECOGNITION OF 
ANDREW KALMAR’S RETIREMENT 
HON. ROBERT E. LATTA 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 1, 2022 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
celebrate Andrew Kalmar’s retirement as 
Wood County Administrator and recognize his 
outstanding career. Andrew has been adminis-
trator for twenty-two years and has proven 
himself to be a leader for both his department 
and county. 
Andrew, originally from Troy, Ohio, grad-
uated from Bowling Green State University 
with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Edu-
cation. He also received a Master of Public 
Administration degree. Andrew began his ca-
reer with the Wood County Commissioners in 
January 2000 after serving as the director of 
the Wood County Park District. 
Over the span of Andrew’s tenure as admin-
istrator, Wood County has built a strong finan-
cial position, experienced economic growth 
and development, made improvements to 
county facilities, and increased efficiency of 
departmental operations. Also, Andrew played 
a key role in the construction of the Alvin L. 
Perkins Atrium at the Wood County Court-
house and office complex. During the last two 
years, Andrew has been instrumental in guid-
ing Wood County through the COVID–19 pan-
demic 
while 
still 
maintaining 
productivity 
throughout all aspects of county work. An-
drew’s character and leadership have contrib-
uted to the success of Wood County, making 
it a remarkable place to live and work. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in paying special tribute to Andrew Kalmar 
in recognition of his service to Wood County. 
On behalf of the people of the Fifth District of 
Ohio, I wish Andrew all the best in his future 
endeavors and thank him for his many years 
of service.

HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF 
SCOTT BROWN 
HON. PRAMILA JAYAPAL 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 1, 2022 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor my constituent, Scott Brown from Se-
attle, Washington who is retiring from Roo-
sevelt High School as the director of bands 
after 38 years of dedicated service. 
Over his distinguished career, Mr. Brown 
has inspired and empowered thousands of 
students in Washington’s 7th Congressional 
District. Mr. Brown was committed to ensuring 
his students had the resources they needed to 
succeed and had an expectation of excel-
lence, holding his students to the highest 
standards. His dedication helped lead the 
Roosevelt High School Jazz Band to four first 
place wins at the Essentially Ellington Festival 
and between 1999 and 2022, the band made 
it to the finals of the competition an unprece-
dented 22 times. Mr. Brown’s efforts and pas-
sion for teaching have not gone unrecognized. 
In 2004, Mr. Brown was named Jazz Educator 
of the Year by DownBeat magazine and both 
the Washington Music Educators Association 
and Seattle’s Earshot Jazz have inducted him 
into their halls of fame. 
Now, as he enters retirement, I ask my col-
leagues to join me in celebrating Mr. Brown’s 
accomplishments and service to his students. 
Through his students, Mr. Brown’s legacy will 
continue to grow and touch the lives of those 
in the Seattle metropolitan area and beyond.
