HONORING KATIE DORSETT AND 
MARY MCALLISTER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. ADAMS) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I rise this 
morning to honor two exceptional 
North Carolina women who left us this 
year, former Senator Dr. Katie Dorsett 
and 
former 
Representative 
Mary 
McAllister. I admired and was friends 
with both of them. 
They were both educators who went 
into public service, proud products of 
historically Black colleges and univer-
sities. Both advocates on behalf of Afri-
can Americans, they founded and led 
organizations to combat sickle cell 
anemia. 
They both knew the highs of winning 
elected office and doing exceptional 
work for their constituents and the 
lows of personal tragedy. Both women 
were predeceased by a child they loved 
like a best friend. 
They were both county commis-
sioners and State legislators and, most 
of all, trailblazers. 
Katie Dorsett was the first Black 
woman on the Greensboro City Coun-
cil, and I was proud to follow in her 
footsteps. After serving on the city 
council, she was elected to the county 
board of commissioners and went on to 
serve in Governor Hunt’s administra-
tion and the North Carolina State Sen-
ate. We served together in the General 
Assembly, and Katie was a longtime 
friend and mentor whose friendship I 
cherished. 
When 
the 
Greensboro 
News 
and 
RECORD remembered her in July, they 
wrote: ‘‘She carried herself with dig-
nity and always spoke her mind.’’ 
That was Katie. She was a great lead-
er and a strong advocate for her com-
munity, and the State of North Caro-
lina is poorer without her. 
Mary McAllister was also a legis-
lator, a county commissioner who 
broke barriers for Black women. She 
was the first Black woman to win a 
countywide election in Cumberland 
County, North Carolina. She changed 
the way the county commission elected 
commissioners so she wouldn’t be the 
last. 
A fountain of confidence, Mary had a 
sense of humor, and she could build re-
lationships with anyone. She wasn’t 
afraid to stand up to the good ol’ boys 
club in the legislature, and we became 
fast friends. It is no surprise that her 
first campaign slogan was ‘‘Mary Has 
Moxie.’’ 
I am humbled to have the oppor-
tunity to honor these strong, phe-
nomenal women on the floor today. 
Thank you, Mary, and thank you, 
Katie, for opening doors for the next 
generation of Black women leaders. I 
am here on the floor of the U.S. House 
today because you crossed the thresh-
old first. 
f 
COUNTERING THREAT OF CHINESE 
COMMUNIST PARTY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. JOYCE) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, after months of hard work 
and collaboration, the China Task 
Force has released our final report, 
which includes more than 400 solutions 
to counter the growing threat of the 
Chinese Communist Party. This report 
is the framework for combating the ag-
gressive Chinese Communist regime. 
After meeting with more than 130 ex-
perts, 
we 
developed 
realistic 
and 
achievable solutions that take a com-
prehensive approach to strengthening 
America’s national security and hold-
ing the Chinese Government account-
able. 
We realized that out of our 400 rec-
ommendations, 180 are legislative solu-
tions, of which 64 percent are bipar-
tisan and one-third have already passed 
either the House or the Senate. 
Mr. Speaker, these are commonsense 
solutions that we can vote on today to 
strengthen our strategic position for 
tomorrow. 
As the only physician serving on the 
China Task Force, it was my privilege 
to delve into opportunities to strength-
en our supply chains and ensure that 
Americans are never again beholden to 
the Chinese Government for key medi-
cines or healthcare supplies. 
On the Health and Technology Sub-
committee, I led efforts to strengthen

the supply chains for medicines, semi-
conductors, and other vital materials. 
Congress has passed several provi-
sions aimed at advancing research and 
the manufacturing of critical medical 
supplies here in the United States. We 
also created new reporting require-
ments to help us better understand 
international 
supply 
chains 
and 
counter vulnerabilities in the system. 
To bolster our technology supply 
chain, I cosponsored H.R. 7178, the 
CHIPS Act, to increase domestic pro-
duction of advanced semiconductors, 
which will help Americans to develop 
next-generation telecom technology, 
fully automated systems, and, impor-
tantly, new weapons systems. 
I also introduced the ORE Act, H.R. 
7812, to incentivize the domestic pro-
duction of rare earth materials, which 
is key to breaking the Chinese monop-
oly on critical supply chains. 
America cannot allow China to win 
the 
race 
to 
next-generation 
tech-
nology. We want innovative break-
throughs to happen here in this coun-
try, and the China Task Force is mak-
ing progress through the legislative 
process. 
As a leader on the competitiveness 
committee, I focused on issues ranging 
from combating Chinese Communist- 
sponsored theft of intellectual property 
to exposing the influence of the Chi-
nese in U.S. research institutions and 
countering the importation of illicit 
fentanyl. 
Too often, American companies are 
being coerced to surrender intellectual 
property to the Chinese Government in 
order to gain entry into the Chinese 
marketplace. In extreme cases, we hear 
of outright theft by Chinese hackers 
and agents. The China Task Force has 
produced recommendations that direct 
the Federal Government to ramp up in-
vestigations of individuals acting as 
pawns of the Chinese Communist Party 
and enforce antitheft laws. 
Our Nation has also seen wholesale 
efforts of the Chinese Government to 
steal research and gain influence at 
United States universities. In my own 
backyard, the FBI arrested a former 
Penn State researcher suspected of es-
pionage. The task force has compiled 
provisions to increase transparency 
and accountability in the higher edu-
cation system, and I introduced legisla-
tion to close loopholes and force the 
disclosure of all foreign money in our 
research systems. 
Finally, we must stop illicit fentanyl 
from reaching our communities and 
killing our neighbors. The China Task 
Force has produced recommendations 
to stop the importation of these dev-
astating analogues from China. 
In the House, I cosponsored legisla-
tion to hold foreign nations, including 
China, accountable if they fail to co-
operate with U.S. narcotics control ef-
forts and prosecute the production of 
fentanyl in their countries. I thank 
Senator TOOMEY for championing this 
provision in the Senate. 
By implementing these solutions, we 
can make America safer, stronger, and 
better equipped to lead in the 21st cen-
tury. 
The China Task Force final report is 
a framework. It is our playbook to 
make a difference. While our work on 
this report has finished, our commit-
ment to this cause must and will con-
tinue. Phase two starts today. 
f 
RETIRING WILLIE O’REE’S NO. 22 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. QUIGLEY) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, in sports 
there are many ways to honor great 
players. Most sports have all-stars, 
MVP honors, and halls of fame. 
In some cases, teams choose to retire 
the number of their biggest stars to 
recognize their careers and legacies. 
But in a few rare cases, a league can 
choose to retire a player’s number for 
every team. 
That is how Major League Baseball 
chose 
to 
honor 
the 
monumental 
achievements and impact of Jackie 
Robinson’s iconic No. 42. And that is 
why the NHL should retire Willie 
O’Ree’s No. 22. 
Willie is recognized as both an am-
bassador and a pioneer of the sport. 
O’Ree broke the NHL’s color barrier 
and helped end segregation in profes-
sional hockey. He changed the game 
for the better, and he deserves this dis-
tinguished honor. 
He made his debut in the NHL in 1958. 
His groundbreaking journey through 
the NHL inspired hundreds of other 
players, both men and women, and laid 
the groundwork for Hispanic, indige-
nous, and Asian players in the NHL, as 
well as the growth of the women’s 
game. 
But what makes Willie O’Ree’s im-
pact more impressive is the global im-
pact he has made in the sport of ice 
hockey. There is no better way to say 
this: If Willie O’Ree had not broken the 
color barrier when he did, thousands of 
young hockey players would not be ex-
posed to this sport. 
Hundreds of organizations that pro-
vide inner-city youth opportunities to 
develop and expand social skills would 
not be here today. Athletic skills and 
professional skills through the sport of 
ice hockey would be drastically re-
duced, and the hockey community in 
the United States would remain far too 
homogenous. 
In short, without Willie O’Ree, there 
is no American hockey culture that 
embodies 
and 
reflects 
the 
diverse 
makeup of our country. That is why I 
was proud to introduce the Willie 
O’Ree Congressional Gold Medal Act in 
this Congress to celebrate this man of 
profound strength who pushed the 
sport to embrace diversity and promote 
inclusion for all. 
I hope you will join me in cospon-
soring this resolution that highlights 
Willie’s incredible moral character, im-
peccable hockey skills, and contribu-
tions to American history and culture. 
Mr. Speaker, I look forward to seeing 
Willie’s jersey retired in the near fu-
ture, and for Willie to celebrate this 
special moment with his family. 
f 
RECOGNIZING CASEWORKERS IN 
ILLINOIS’ 15TH DISTRICT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. SHIMKUS) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to continue to thank my staff for 
excellent service to the constituents of 
my district and sometimes to those 
even outside my district. 
In our organization, caseworkers live 
and work in Illinois. They work out of 
my district offices, which I have his-
torically spread out throughout my 
large, mainly rural district. During 
this Congress, my offices have been in 
Maryville, Effingham, Harrisburg, and 
Danville. 
My caseworkers are my representa-
tives to that region. They also welcome 
visitors and forward legislative con-
cerns to my legislative assistant, but 
their primary job is that of casework. 
What is a case? A case is a concern, 
request, or correction by my constitu-
ents who feel that they are not receiv-
ing due benefits or having trouble just 
getting answers from the Federal Gov-
ernment. Our job is to get them an an-
swer. I was always careful never to 
promise that I could solve their prob-
lem; I only promise that we would try. 
My caseworkers did all the work. 
Mr. Speaker, those district case-
workers are: 
Ballard, Mary; Buettner, Ruth; Bugger, 
Doug; Carlson, Brad; Davis, Rodney; Detmers, 
Deb (Fansler); Dillman, Jen; Flanigan, Matt; 
Graham, Donna; Hall, Mike; Hamilton, Daniel; 
Hanson, John; Hantz, Chuck; Healy, Holly 
(Linder); Hoffman, Doug. 
Jamison, Reno; Madigan Andrea; Maxwell, 
Mary Ellen/Maria (Madonia); Merriman, Angie; 
Nelson, Jed; Newcomb, Nate; Holloway, Kay 
D.; Pickett, Matt; Pruitt, Jen; Rice, Matt; 
Rohan, Dora; Shull, Kristen; Tomaszewski, 
Steve; Von Burg, Peggy; Weber, Amy. 
Mr. Speaker, over the years, my of-
fice has been able to assist literally 
thousands of people with their prob-
lems with the Federal Government. 
Here are just a few examples of things 
that they have been able to accom-
plish. 
One of my constituents was born in 
Mississippi in the 1930s at home with a 
midwife. In her seventies, she tried to 
get a passport for a once-in-a-lifetime 
trip to Spain, but her birth was never 
recorded, and her parents were de-
ceased. 
My office assisted her in obtaining 
school records, baptismal certificates, 
marriage license, children’s birth cer-
tificates, and certified letters from old 
friends. These documents, combined 
with a Census search showing her liv-
ing with her grandmother in Mis-
sissippi in the 1940s, finally was ample 
information for her to obtain a pass-
port. 
Mr. Speaker, I have been able to 
present medals to deserving veterans 
across my district. Often the veterans

do not want to talk about their experi-
ence, but their awards are important to 
their children and their grandchildren. 
One of these veterans was the uncle of 
my veterans affairs caseworker, Doug 
Bugger. Another is a veteran from Rob-
inson, Illinois, who had been shot and 
taken prisoner by the Germans during 
the Battle of the Bulge. After receiving 
the awards, he gave an interview to the 
Robinson Daily News and used a photo-
graph of him with his medals, includ-
ing his Purple Heart. Helping in the re-
covery of these military awards helps 
these veterans relay their experiences 
to family and friends. 
Social Security disability is a long 
and frustrating process. One gentleman 
had been approved but had waited near-
ly a year for his backpay when he came 
to my Harrisburg office. It turned out 
it was coded incorrectly in the Social 
Security system. Within 2 weeks, my 
office got the situation corrected, and 
he received his backpay. 
Some of our happiest casework is to 
help families with overseas adoptions, 
like the family that was in the process 
of adopting a child from Haiti just as 
the pandemic was shutting everything 
down. My office was able to work with 
the Embassy to get child humanitarian 
parole to come to the United States of 
America. 
b 0915 
Mr. Speaker, I can go on and on like 
most offices could talking about the 
work that their caseworkers do. I don’t 
have time to do that, so I will include 
these additional stories in the RECORD. 
A veteran came to one of my Traveling Help 
Desks. He had recently undergone a partial 
amputation of his foot. The VA doctor missed 
the diagnosis, so a private doctor performed 
the procedure. The VA was refusing to pay for 
the surgery, but after our inquiry, the VA 
agreed the surgery was necessary and it was 
their mistake in missing the diagnosis and 
paid the bill for $1,712.76. 
A veteran had fallen off a crane during his 
time in the military. This resulted in a 3-inch 
gash to the head and subsequent severe sei-
zures. He had been trying to get disability 
from the VA for 10 years. After our inquiry, he 
was granted a 100% service-connected dis-
ability and approved retroactively for 10 years 
(estimated 
$227,440) 
and 
now 
receives 
$1,940 per month. 
A veteran requested our assistance in ob-
taining his father’s silver star from WWI. We 
were able to obtain this, as well as his other 
medals and I presented them to the family at 
a family reunion. The family made a box for 
the medals and gave them to the American 
Legion to display. The family was very happy. 
A constituent contacted our office on behalf 
of her husband. Medicare was denying his 
claims because there was an error in the pa-
perwork that showed her husband had em-
ployer-provided insurance, when in fact he 
had been retired since 1986. Her husband 
was terminally ill, and she was spending a lot 
of time trying to resolve this situation. She had 
called more than 50 places before she called 
our office. After contacting our office, we were 
able to have the problem fixed and have the 
claims reprocessed and paid. 
A union contacted our office on the issue of 
wage differentiation concerning government 
employees in Illinois. After our inquiry, it was 
determined there was an error when the wage 
differentiation was made, and a salary adjust-
ment was made. 
The local FSA was not allowing some con-
stituents to mow their property that was en-
rolled in the CRP program. Not mowing the 
land would result in trees growing on the prop-
erty, which would defeat the purpose of having 
the land in CRP. After an inquiry from our of-
fice, the state revised their rules. 
A constituent came to us because Social 
Security was showing him as deceased, when 
in fact it was his wife who had passed away 
on May 20 of this year. We were able to expe-
dite a correction of his records and have his 
retirement benefits reinstated. This was a So-
cial Security Administration error. 
A constituent received a notice from the IRS 
that after paying her debt of $2,400 from her 
quarterly taxes of 9/87 and 12/87 on her pre-
vious business, she now owed $3,184 in inter-
est and penalties. She was never aware of the 
interest and penalties as she had repeatedly 
asked for a statement from the IRS for her 
$100.00 payments and federal tax returns they 
had also been keeping. Also, she had never 
received the original bills because her busi-
ness closed in 1990, and they had been send-
ing these notices to that address. We ended 
up going with her to an IRS problem solving 
day and staying with her through several 
hours of negotiations. Eventually, her balance 
was zeroed. She was very grateful and ended 
up testifying at our IRS hearings. 
A constituent was applying for a teaching 
position at one of the local schools. He need-
ed transcripts from his alma mater in Okla-
homa to obtain his provisional teaching certifi-
cate. The school was telling him they could 
not provide this because they did not keep 
records prior to 1985. We were able to inter-
vene with the school, and obtain a letter 
verifying his completion of a 72-hour course 
from a former instructor. This worked for the 
teaching certificate and he received the job. 
A constituent contacted our office regarding 
his request to help him obtain an answer from 
AT&T Broadband Services concerning the free 
internet service for schools that they have ad-
vertised. He contacted AT&T several times but 
never felt he got a straight answer as to when 
the service was going to be available to the 
school. I met with AT&T representatives and 
told them of this situation. AT&T got in touch 
with him and the school was hooked up. I was 
able to visit the school and see the technology 
area. The kids all sent me a thank you note. 
A constituent worked at a small local news-
paper. She had contacted us for assistance 
with child support enforcement. Her ex was in 
the Navy and then became a pilot. According 
to the law, he could lose his passport for 
being over $5,000 in arrears. He owed 
$10,330 and we were able to work with the 
appropriate enforcement agencies and he 
ended up paying $5,500 of his debt and his 
monthly payment increased from $200 a 
month to $1,000 a month. She was very grate-
ful to our office. 
The Edwards County Coroner informed my 
office that the remains of a Sgt. Kenneth 
Cunningham of Albion had been identified 45 
years after his plane went down over the Kon 
Tum Province in Vietnam. The coroner and 
family were working to bring the remains 
home for a burial and were having some dif-
ficulty with the bureaucracy. We were able to 
talk to the Defense Department and help with 
the arrangements the family wanted. The fam-
ily was able to be at the airport in Louisville, 
Kentucky when he arrived, and the Patriot 
Guard accompanied Sgt. Cunningham back to 
Albion where citizens lined up along the route 
to pay their respects. The VFW distributed 500 
flags along the route and more than 200 local 
volunteers lined the route from the town to the 
cemetery with over 2,400 flags. 
A constituent sought my help in March of 
this year during the COVID–19 pandemic to 
bring his daughter and his grandson back to 
the United States on the repatriation flights the 
Department of State offered. Working with the 
father and the State Department they both 
made it back to the United States two and half 
weeks after contacting us. 
Also, in March we assisted 5 constituents 
stranded in Honduras after the border had 
been closed. They had problems receiving 
their transit letters from the U.S. Embassy so 
they could travel to the airport. We were able 
to assist, and they were able to get seats on 
a plane chartered by a church out of Lincoln, 
Nebraska. 
The Sny Island Levee Drainage District pro-
tects 110,000 acres of prime farmland in west 
central Illinois. Due to the change in flow of 
the Mississippi, this privately owned and main-
tained levee was threatened with failing. We 
helped coordinate emergency repairs by the 
Corp of Engineers to protect the navigation 
channel at that location. This also protected 
the farmland. 
‘‘Lights On for Route 20’’ was a movement 
for a four-lane road between Springfield and 
Taylorville. Lobbied intensely by the local com-
munities and concerned parents we were able 
to designate one million dollars for engineer-
ing. This was a small investment versus the 
total costs. This investment did get the atten-
tion of the state representative and the state 
senator who requested that this project be in-
cluded in the governor’s Build Illinois project 
list. We now have a four-lane road between 
Springfield and Taylorville. 
Mr. Speaker, some cases resolve 
quickly. Many cases take months and 
even years to resolve. My caseworkers 
always show compassion and concern 
to my constituents. They answer their 
calls; they return their calls; and for 
that, I say thanks. I am very proud of 
the service that they have given to the 
people of southern Illinois.

Texas (Mr. GREEN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
and still I rise in the name of liberty

Mr. Speaker, there is something hap-
pening in our country. It appears to me 
that the inescapable, irreversible winds 
of change are sweeping across our land. 
It seems to me that the people in this 
country have seen things that they did 
not anticipate they would see. They

Breonna Taylor. And the people in this 
country seem to want to see change 
take place. 
I am amazed at how one question by 
a moderator at an event has made a 
significant impact. The simple ques-
tion was, and I am paraphrasing: Would 
you denounce white supremacy? 
It was a simple question. It did not 
get the appropriate answer. As a result, 
people are starting to believe that we 
ought not allow an answer that is inap-
propriate to be acceptable. 
I am just amazed at how persons 
across the aisle—and I am grateful to 
them—persons across the aisle have 
said that there should have been the 
appropriate answer given, which is: I 
condemn white supremacy; I condemn 
the supremacist. 
That is the answer, simple, easy an-
swer. 
And persons across the aisle are send-
ing a clear and perspicuous message to 
the Chief Executive Officer: He needs 
to change that response—walk it back; 
talk it back; crawl it back; just take it 
back. 
I don’t know that he will, but I do 
know this: When we have my friends 
across the aisle making it clear that 
this was wrong, something is hap-
pening here, and I am grateful to my 
friends. I thank you for taking the bold 
position that you are taking, not al-
lowing this to be just another one of 
the many episodes wherein inappro-
priate statements have been made and 
not challenged. I thank you for what 
you have done, all of you, those who 
have said you need to condemn white 
supremacy. 
Something 
strange 
is 
happening. 
There is a change taking place, and I 
am grateful to have lived long enough 
to see this change occur.

RECOGNIZING LAKE COUNTY 
MANAGER JEFF COLE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. SPANO) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. SPANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Mr. Jeff Cole for his 
30 years of distinguished service to the 
citizens of Florida, culminating this 
year with his retirement as the Lake 
County manager. 
Mr. Cole began his public service ca-
reer in 1990, supporting the Brevard 
County Board of County Commis-
sioners. In 1994, he embarked on a 21- 
year journey with the St. Johns River 
Water 
Management 
District, 
over-
seeing intergovernmental affairs and 
public and media outreach. 
His long record of accomplishments 
brought him to Lake County in 2016, 
where he took on heightened respon-
sibilities and focused on enhancing 
government efficiencies and account-
ability, while improving the quality of 
life in Lake County. 
Through challenges ranging from 
Hurricane Irma to COVID–19, Mr. Cole 
remained accessible and demonstrated 
unwavering leadership and dedication 
to our community. 
Mr. Speaker, I wish Jeff and his wife, 
Audrey, the very best in the next chap-
ter of their lives together. From the 
bottom of my heart, I thank Jeff for 
his commitment to our citizens and the 
legacy that he is leaving behind. He 
will be missed. 
REMEMBERING SPECIALIST ALEXANDER J. 
MILLER 
Mr. SPANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to remember Specialist Alex-
ander J. Miller, a young soldier who 
served our Nation in the Armed Forces 
and was, sadly, killed in combat in 
Nuristan province, Afghanistan, on 
July 31, 2009. 
Alex 
attended 
East 
Ridge 
High 
School in Clermont, Florida and, soon 
after graduation, enlisted in the U.S. 
Army, being assigned to the 1st Bat-
talion, 32nd Infantry Regiment, 3rd 
Brigade Combat Team, 10th Mountain 
Division, Light Infantry, based in Fort 
Drum, New York. 
Alex hoped to attend the University 
of Central Florida after completing his 
tour of duty, but that dream vanished 
when insurgents attacked his unit. 
Miller was awarded two medals post-
humously: the Purple Heart and the 
Bronze Star. 
May his memory and sacrifices be a 
reminder to all of us of his service and 
love of country. 
Our thoughts and prayers remain 
with the entirety of the Miller family 
and his community these many years 
later. 
REMEMBERING FIRST LIEUTENANT IVAN D. 
LECHOWICH 
Mr. SPANO. Mr. Speaker, today I 
rise to celebrate the legacy of a local 
resident and hero of Florida’s 15th Dis-
trict, 
First 
Lieutenant 
Ivan 
Lechowich. 
Lieutenant Lechowich was a devoted 
husband and loving father who served 
his country in uniform and was, sadly, 
killed in Ghazni province, Afghanistan, 
on September 28, 2011. 
Lieutenant 
Lechowich 
graduated 
from the International Baccalaureate 
Program at King High School, earned 
his undergraduate degree from the Uni-
versity of Florida in 2007, and, after 
joining the U.S. Army in 2009, deployed 
to Afghanistan 2 years later. 
Ivan was serving as a Sapper Platoon 
leader for the 515th Sapper Company 
out of Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, 
when an improvised explosive device 
took his life. 
Ivan was awarded the Purple Heart, 
Bronze 
Star, 
Army 
Commendation 
Medal, and NATO Medal. 
To his beloved wife, Jenn; daughter, 
Natalie Marie; and the rest of the 
Lechowich family, our district and 
community still mourns the loss of 
Ivan these many years later. May his 
memory and many sacrifices be a re-
minder of his love for his family and 
his Nation. 
REMEMBERING SERGEANT DANIEL MCKINNON 
ANGUS 
Mr. SPANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in memory of Sergeant Daniel 
McKinnon Angus, a local hero in Flor-
ida’s 15th District, who was killed in 
action in Afghanistan on January 24, 
2010. 
Daniel 
graduated 
from 
Armwood 
High School in 2000 and, in 2003, joined 
the U.S. Marine Corps where he knew 
he belonged and hoped to make a ca-
reer of serving his community and 
country. 
Daniel stood out among his peers and 
received the Combat Action Ribbon, 
two Good Conduct Medals, the Afghani-
stan and Iraq Campaign Medals, the 
Global 
War 
on 
Terrorism 
Service 
Medal, and a number of service decora-
tions. 
Daniel loved spending time with his 
wife, Bonnie, and his 1-year-old daugh-
ter. Now 11 years old, may she always 
know and treasure the knowledge of 
her father’s heroism. 
Men and women like Daniel who are 
willing to lay down their lives in de-
fense of our country and in support of 
others many miles away are what 
make our Nation the greatest on 
Earth. Let us never take their sacrifice 
or that of their surviving families in 
vain.

HONORING DR. GOVINDAPPA 
VENKATASWAMY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speak-
er, today, on the 102nd anniversary of 
his 
birth, 
I 
rise 
to 
honor 
Dr. 
Govindappa Venkataswamy, an Indian 
ophthalmologist who devoted his life to 
preventing 
blindness 
in 
India 
and 
across the world. 
Dr. Venkataswamy’s work preserved 
the vision of millions of men, women, 
and children, allowing them the bless-
ing of sight and the opportunity to 
enjoy independent, productive lives. 
Though Dr. V suffered from a severe 
form of rheumatoid arthritis that left 
his hands permanently disfigured, he 
defied all odds to become an expert 
ophthalmologist and mastered the art 
of cataract surgery. 
Having witnessed the terrible impact 
of blindness on those without the 
means to pay for their own care, Dr. V 
pursued an extraordinarily ambitious 
program to end preventable blindness 
in India. 
In 1976, Dr. V and members of his 
family founded the first of what would 
later become a network of Aravind Eye 
Hospitals in Madurai, India. 
The Aravind Eye Care System has 
been acclaimed by Harvard Business 
School and is the focus of an HBS case 
study. It has also been recognized for 
excellence in publications, including 
Fast Company, Forbes, and The Wall 
Street Journal, and it has inspired 
healthcare organizations throughout 
the developing world. 
From 
its 
humble 
beginning 
in 
Madurai, the Aravind Eye Care System 
now provides care to over 4 million pa-
tients and performs over 500,000 sur-
geries each year in hospitals and clin-
ics throughout south India.

October 1, 2020 
Dr. V passed away in 2006, but his leg-
acy continues to give eyesight to those 
who otherwise would be blind, and his 
story continues to inspire millions. 
His life is best celebrated by his own 
words: 
When we identify ourselves with all that is 
in the world, there is no exploitation. It is 
ourselves we are helping. It is ourselves we 
are healing. 
f 
RECOGNIZING FIRE PREVENTION 
WEEK 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise as a former State 
certified firefighter one from Pennsyl-
vania. As we kick off the month of Oc-
tober, I mention that next week is Fire 
Prevention Week. 
In 1925, President Calvin Coolidge es-
tablished Fire Prevention Week, and 
today it is the longest running public 
health observance in the Nation. It is 
celebrated each year during the week 
of October 9 to commemorate the dev-
astating Great Chicago Fire. 
This is an opportunity to educate one 
another on simple measures we can all 
take to prevent fires at home. You can 
bolster your family’s safety by testing 
your fire alarms monthly, giving home 
heaters appropriate space, and having 
an escape plan if, God forbid, your 
home does catch fire. 
We must also do more to prevent 
wildfires. As former chairman of the 
Subcommittee on Conservation and 
Forestry, I have been a part of many 
conversations, meetings, and hearings 
about how we can better prevent forest 
devastation as a result of wildfires. 
We 
continue 
to 
see 
devastating 
wildfires on the West Coast. Homes, 
businesses, and forests are burning to 
the ground. The air quality is dan-
gerous, and millions of Americans are 
at risk. 
For decades, the health and resil-
iency of our national forests have been 
in decline due to a lack of management 
and, more recently, extreme environ-
mental policies. 
With nearly 90 million acres of 
forestland in need of urgent treatment, 
Congress needs to finally act and pro-
vide the tools and authorities to enable 
the Forest Service to proactively man-
age. Doing so will directly help prevent 
wildfire outbreaks, support our local 
communities, and restore the health of 
our Nation’s forests. And a healthy for-
est is one of the largest carbon sinks in 
the world. 
The 2018 House-passed farm bill con-
tained bipartisan, commonsense forest 
management provisions to help prevent 
loss of life and property from these 
fires. These bipartisan authorities were 
created with input from the U.S. For-
est Service under both the Obama and 
Trump administrations. These were 
ideas that were well vetted through 
hearings and markups and supported 
by the House Agriculture Committee 
and on the floor. 
However, Senate Democrats have re-
fused to even discuss these needed re-
forms. Since these provisions were re-
jected, 3.5 million acres of Forest Serv-
ice land have burned. 
Wildfire response and recovery ef-
forts should not be a partisan issue. We 
are blessed as a nation to have hun-
dreds of millions of acres of beautiful 
forestlands, and the best way to pre-
vent forest fires is through a well-man-
aged forest. 
Mr. Speaker, well-managed forests, 
again, are the largest carbon sinks in 
the world and the greatest filters for 
our watersheds that originate in those 
forests. Our forests provide great op-
portunities for outdoor recreation, but 
they are also unparalleled environ-
mental tools. Our national forests 
serve as some of the Nation’s largest 
carbon sinks. 
This Fire Prevention Week, I would 
like to encourage everyone to brush up 
on their fire safety measures, and I re-
iterate just how crucial healthy forests 
are in preventing wildfires. 
I thank the brave men and women 
who are on the front lines fighting 
those devastating fires out West. 
f 
MORE COVID RELIEF IS NEEDED 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Connecticut (Mr. COURTNEY) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, as we 
stand here on October 1, a few hours 
ago the leadership of airline industries 
all across America announced very sad 
news for their workforce. The fact of 
the matter is that, with CARES Act 
money expiring at midnight last night, 
massive layoffs are now going to be im-
plemented over the next few days and 
weeks. 
American Airlines and United Air-
lines, together, about 32,000 workers 
are going to be laid off today, this 
morning. Again, other airlines are 
doing exactly the same thing. 
The impact, the ripple effect in terms 
of the collapse of consumer demand be-
cause international air travel is vir-
tually nonexistent, domestic air travel 
is way down and it is going to stay 
down for months to come, has resulted, 
again, in a ripple effect in the aero-
space industry. 
b 0930 
Raytheon Technologies up in New 
England, which is the parent company 
of Pratt & Whitney, announced 16,000 
layoffs, again, because the commercial 
airline industry’s demand is basically 
drying up. 
Boeing industry announced 16,000 
layoffs also because of the same reason. 
The commercial sector in terms of air-
line orders, again, has completely dried 
up. 
They are not the only sector that are 
still struggling in this COVID reces-
sion. Talk to any restaurant owner in 
any district all across America, talk to 
anyone who is involved in the tourism 
destination. 
Disney announced 23,000 layoffs on 
Monday, again, because of the collapse 
in visits because of the COVID pan-
demic. 
In Connecticut, we have two large, 
Native-American 
casinos, 
Foxwoods 
and Mohegan. They have started par-
tial operations, but still, half their 
workforce, again, has not been re-
called, again, because it is just not safe 
for people to have gatherings in large 
density. 
Tuesday night, the President of the 
United States, before the American 
people, made the claim that: nothing 
to worry about; we are in a V-shaped 
recovery. 
Well, tell that to the airline workers. 
Tell that to the people in the res-
taurant and hospitality sector. Tell 
that to the people in the tourism sec-
tor. 
Again, all across America, 780,000 
new unemployment claims yesterday 
across this country. 
We are not in a V-shaped recovery. 
We have got a lot of businesses out 
there working their tails off to get 
back to work and to get normalcy 
back. But the fact of the matter is, as 
Jerome Powell, President Trump’s own 
chairman 
of 
the 
Federal 
Reserve 
Board, has said repeatedly: Until we 
get control of COVID, we are not going 
to have a sustained economic recovery 
that is going to bring back the jobs 
that, again, we have lost in the mil-
lions. 
So here we are. We are on the verge, 
again, of another wave of job losses in 
this country. And the question of the 
day is whether Congress is going to 
step up like it did four times pre-
viously on a bipartisan basis to pass 
COVID relief? The CARES Act being, 
obviously, the biggest one back in 
March, which, again, the American 
people are desperate for us to move out 
on. 
A couple of days ago, the Speaker re-
leased a package, which for the first 
time included a COVID relief extension 
for 
airline 
workers, 
which, 
again, 
would avoid the bloodbath that is 
going to happen in terms of jobs in the 
next few hours in this country. 
Finally, we have seen the Secretary 
of the Treasury show up here at the 
building 130 days after we passed the 
Heroes Act to have a serious conversa-
tion about getting some COVID relief 
out there to, again, stabilize this econ-
omy. 
We can do this. And I say that be-
cause we have done it four times al-
ready acting on a bipartisan basis. 
What we have to do, though, is just 
sort of drop the happy talk about the 
fact that this virus, we are on the other 
side of it, nothing to worry about, V- 
shaped recovery. 
It is really just almost insulting to 
the American people to spin that kind 
of message out there when people are 
struggling, having their unemployment

benefits run out, their economic im-
pact payments have long since been 
spent, they have got rent due, they 
have got utility bills due. They want to 
go back to work, but the fact of the 
matter is, we are still not there yet 
where we can have a sustained eco-
nomic recovery. 
Mr. Speaker, I plead with my col-
leagues on the other side, who, again, 
have whip notices going out to oppose 
any Heroes 2.0 or anything like it, to 
please just think about the success 
that we did back in March when we 
passed the CARES package, which to 
this day is still providing some benefit. 
Those new rapid tests that the Presi-
dent announced a couple of days ago, 
which is a wonderful development, was 
paid for by the CARES Act, but we 
need more. 
And Jerome Powell has warned us re-
peatedly since May that the CARES 
Act was a great achievement by Con-
gress, but we need to have more fiscal 
stimulus until we get past this pan-
demic. 
Again, the clock is now ticking. 
And, again, Mr. Speaker, for the sake 
of all of us and our fellow citizens, 
please let’s come together and get a 
COVID relief bill passed this week.

RECOGNIZING MEMBERS OF THE 
ARMED FORCES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, in November, thousands of 
marines will graduate from Marine 
Corps 
Infantry 
Training 
Battalion. 
These brave men and women will go on 
to serve and protect the United States 
and our allies across the world. 
One such marine is Rece T. Rader 
from Winston-Salem. His mother, An-
gela, recently wrote to me about his 
graduation from boot camp at Parris 
Island and his subsequent move to 
Camp Geiger. 
In her letter, she spoke passionately 
about how COVID–19 has made it in-
credibly hard for military families to 
celebrate alongside their loved ones 
who have completed their program re-
quirements. 
Her story applies to so many fami-
lies, and it highlights the importance 
of recognizing the many accomplish-
ments of these airmen, marines, sol-
diers, sailors, and guardsmen. 
COVID–19 has disrupted the lives of 
all Americans in many ways. 
It is, however, very unfortunate that 
COVID–19 has deprived the service-
members of the physical and moral 
support that comes with the attend-
ance of their families at graduation 
ceremonies. 
To all servicemembers who are cur-
rently preparing for duty: We are in-
credibly proud of you. Your hard work 
and dedication have not gone unno-
ticed, and you serve as the role models 
that young people look to for inspira-
tion. 
Today and every day, we should cele-
brate your accomplishments and the 
strides you continue to make. 
Though we may not be able to con-
gratulate you all in person, please 
know we will always celebrate you no 
matter how close or how far away you 
may be. 
May God bless you, your families, 
and the United States of America. 
LIFE IS WINNING 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, life is winning. 
Recently, a great new book by Mar-
jorie Dannenfelser, President of the 
Susan B. Anthony List, has been pub-
lished that is entitled, ‘‘Life Is Win-
ning.’’ 
Currently, I am halfway through the 
book, but can wholeheartedly rec-
ommend it to anyone who is interested 
in learning about the fight for life in 
our country and to learn more about 
the role of elected officials in this 
fight. 
Many people, publicly known and un-
known, have been working diligently 
to preserve what our Declaration of 
Independence says we are guaranteed: 
life, liberty, and the pursuit of happi-
ness. 
Mr. Speaker, without question, life is 
the fundamental component to liberty 
and the pursuit of happiness. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Marjorie, all 
the staff at Susan B. Anthony, the staff 
at National Right to Life, and the won-
derful people at the State and local 
levels who pray diligently and work 
every day to promote the culture of 
life, which we know is supported by a 
majority of Americans. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank 
President 
Trump and Vice-President PENCE for 
their steadfast support of life. They un-
derstand that life must be protected 
and fought for at every turn. 
f 
CONTRACT DAY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
the Virgin Islands (Ms. PLASKETT) for 5 
minutes. 
Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, today 
we have been asked to wear white to 
honor Ruth Bader Ginsburg. She rep-
resents the tremendous struggle and 
fight for women’s equality. 
In the Virgin Islands, today, October 
1, is formally known as Contract Day. 
It honors and celebrates four women, 
our four queens, that led the St. Croix 
Labor Rebellion of 1878, also known to 
us as Fireburn. 
After slaves in the Danish West In-
dies organized, fought, and took their 
freedom from chattel slavery in 1848, a 
new type of slavery was formed in a 
labor bill in the following year to regu-
late the conditions of the now free 
workers. 
The law stipulated a day wage, and 
confined workers to one plantation 
each year that could only change on 
Contract Day, October 1. 
Former slaves worked on the same 
plantations as before, with little to no 
improvement in their living condi-
tions, healthcare, education, income, 
and their movement was restricted. I 
am sure many of my African-American 
brothers and sisters recall this hap-
pening in the United States after the 
Civil War. 
The newly freed workers found that 
the low wages and new restrictions 
made living impossible. It was freedom 
in name only. 
These conditions, along with the in-
ability to vote, to participate in any 
aspect of the Danish Government at 
the time, created an incredibly unten-
able life. 
Before October 1 of 1878, rumors cir-
culated that the law was going to im-
prove. When the workers realized on 
October 1 that those rumors were false, 
the frustration and anger from the past 
30 years of unfair treatment and harsh 
labor practices after obtaining freedom 
ignited a protest that led to a rebellion 
in Frederiksted on the Island of St. 
Croix. 
That rebellion, that uprising, was led 
by four women, our Virgin Island 
Queens: 
Mary 
Thomas, 
Mathilda 
Macbean, 
Susanna 
‘‘Bottom 
Belly’’ 
Abrahamson, 
and 
Axeline 
‘‘Queen 
Agnes’’ Salomon demanded all planta-
tions improve workers’ wages and re-
peal the Labor Act of 1849 that kept 
workers in serf-like conditions. More 
than half of the city of Frederiksted 
burned, along with the estates, the 
plantations across the western and 
northern part of the island. 
The Danish Crown jailed about 400 
and executed more than 100 people. 
Women were burned at the stake after 
molasses was poured on them, but their 
heroic and sacrificial acts, like those 
who earned our freedom 30 years prior, 
inspired change. 
My ancestors, men and women, were 
willing not only to fight, but to die for 
the cause of equality and the dignity of 
a living wage and fair working condi-
tions. 
That 
fight, 
of 
course, 
continues 
today, not just for Virgin Islanders, but 
for indigenous people throughout our 
Nation and territories. 
October is part of Indigenous Peoples 
Day, 
honoring 
the 
centuries-long 
struggle of people against the horrors 
of genocide, colonialism, imperialism, 
and the present conditions of unfair 
labor laws, discrimination, and unequal 
voting rights. 
From Carib Indians fighting off Co-
lumbus on the island of Ay Ay—what is 
now the island of St. Croix in the Vir-
gin Islands, the first place of armed re-
sistance to Columbus in the New 
World—to the four queens, as I men-
tioned, of Fireburn; D. Hamilton Jack-
son, honored in November, fighting the 
Danish Crown for freedom of speech, 
people on my island and all over the 
world continue to demand and fight for 
freedom, equality, and fairness. 
Much like the atmosphere of the 
Danish West Indies, our Nation is in a 
tumultuous but necessary time of 
change.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5115 
October 1, 2020 
Let us heed that change. Let us do it 
peacefully, organized, with leaders. 
The attention drawn to practices of 
systemic racism and police brutality 
against people of color has sparked a 
collective worldwide cry for justice, 
not just in this country, but govern-
ments around the world. 
Protests, removal of statues of op-
pressors of people of color are taking 
place in this Nation and throughout 
the world. 
What will this body do? What will 
this Congress do? How long will this 
Congress, this body, be part of the in-
equality of 4 million people living in 
the territories? Telling us, as I hear 
often from my colleagues, ‘‘It is so un-
fair. I wish it were different.’’ But not 
doing anything to change those laws, 
the systemic laws that were written 
over 100 years ago that makes it so 
continually without end for us. 
I pray that the spirit of those queens 
charge me with renewed conviction to 
keep pushing. 
I pray that there is no Fireburn here, 
but what comes must come.

THREE PIECES OF GOOD NEWS, 
ONE PIECE OF BAD NEWS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Wisconsin (Mr. GROTHMAN) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, nor-
mally, or frequently, people use this 
microphone to give negative news, and 
I would like to lead off with three little 
positive stories that I don’t think have 
been in the news enough, and then we 
will talk about a story—I don’t know if 
it is true or not—but we are going to 
ask for a committee hearing. 
First of all, I was at a committee 
about 10 days ago in which we had a 
hearing on Afghanistan. So many of us 
back home have heard stories, attended 
funerals of people, people frequently in 
the National Guard, who have died 
fighting in Afghanistan. 
We have now gone 7 months without 
any combat deaths in Afghanistan. I 
don’t think that story has been told 
enough. I am kind of really surprised it 
hasn’t been told a lot during this cam-
paign season, but it hasn’t. 
So let’s celebrate the fact that we 
have gone 7 months, hard to believe, 
without a combat casualty in Afghani-
stan. 
Now, the second piece of good news. I 
was talking to the head of the border 
patrol, and it was not long ago, about 
15, 16 months ago, when 90,000 people a 
month were apprehended at the south-
ern border and allowed in the United 
States, frequently given a hearing, an 
asylum hearing. But they were allowed 
in the United States, frequently lost 
track of, and people who we weren’t ap-
propriately vetting becoming a perma-
nent part of our American fabric. 
b 0945 
In the last month, in part due to 
three different things—a negotiation 
that President Trump had with Mexico, 
where when we apprehend people, we 
send them back to Mexico, pending the 
asylum hearing; secondly, negotiations 
with Central America, where people 
walking 
through 
Central 
America 
headed to the United States are kept in 
Central America; and third, a directive 
that if people try to come into this 
country because of fears of COVID–19, 
they 
are 
also 
immediately 
turned 
around and led back—we now have 
gone from about 90,000 people to under 
2,000, as a matter of fact, he told me 
under 1,000 people a month being let in 
this country who are apprehended or 
talked to by the Border Patrol. 
There are still people who sneak 
across the border who are not appre-
hended by the Border Patrol. But 
among these people who they touch, we 
have gone from 90,000 to under 1,000. 
That is good news, and I am surprised 
how many people, even on the floor of 
this institution, do not know what an 
improvement we have had at the bor-
der. 
The third piece of good news I am 
going to give a tip of the hat to, when 
I drove in 2 weeks ago, I took an Uber 
from the airport. I talked to the Uber 
driver, who not only was driving for 
Uber, but he also had a job, I believe he 
told me, with CVS, and he was living 
the American Dream. 
When I asked him what was great 
about America, he said anybody can 
make it in America, the land of oppor-
tunity. 
Here you have an Afghan Uber driver. 
He wasn’t of European heritage. I don’t 
believe he was Christian. I don’t be-
lieve in the family growing up he could 
speak English. But despite all these 
disadvantages, he is living the Amer-
ican Dream—and it wasn’t rocket 
science—driving an Uber, working at 
CVS. 
I hope we remember him as other 
Congressmen, for whatever political 
reason, want to tear down America and 
say you can’t make it in America. I 
will tell you, if that Afghan Uber driv-
er can make it in America and live the 
American Dream, anybody can live the 
American Dream. 
But now I would like to ask for a 
hearing because I had some, perhaps, 
bad news back home. I talked to a 
woman who had two children. One is 
$30,000 in debt, one is $40,000 in debt, 
from taking out student loans. She 
told me that she felt that if she and her 
husband weren’t married, there would 
have been government programs, and 
her children wouldn’t be so in debt. 
She has raised good kids. Those kids 
are going to pay off their loans, even if 
they were discriminated against be-
cause their parents were married, or 
not. 
But it occurred to me, at a time 
when so much of the rhetoric in this 
institution is about discrimination, we 
ought to have a hearing on the Edu-
cation and Labor Committee: Is it real-
ly true that we have government pro-
grams out here penalizing people for 
getting married? 
I would ask, again, that my wonder-
ful chairman of the Education and 
Labor Committee have a hearing on 
this topic. We can find out whether it 
is the official policy of the United 
States, when determining government 
grants 
helping 
people 
go 
through 
school, that we discriminate against 
children of married couples. And they 
have to delay having children, delay 
buying a house, as they have to pay off 
their student loans. 
So I would like to have a hearing. I 
hope what my constituent told me is 
not true, that it is the official policy of 
the United States Government to dis-
criminate against people who decide to 
get married. But I am afraid it might 
be, and that is why I would like to have 
a hearing.

RECOGNIZING SERVICE OF CAROL 
BRICK-TURIN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ) for 5 
minutes. 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. 
Speaker, it is with great pleasure that 
I rise to recognize the remarkable ca-
reer of Carol Brick-Turin. 
After 12 years, Ms. Brick-Turin is re-
tiring as the executive director of the 
Greater Miami Jewish Federation’s 
Jewish Community Relations Council. 
Carol originally moved to Wash-
ington, D.C., to join the U.S. Depart-
ment of Agriculture, where she worked 
on public policy issues for more than a 
decade. A graduate of Cornell Univer-
sity with a bachelor of science degree 
in agricultural economics, she was re-
cruited to join the Foreign Agricul-
tural Service and served as a diplomat 
in Brussels, Belgium, in the U.S. Mis-
sion to the European Community. 
She was the first married female to 
serve as an agricultural attache in the 
history of the FAS. 
Carol attended the Foreign Service 
Institute, completed a study program 
taught by faculty of the Jewish Theo-
logical Seminary, and attended the 
University of Tel Aviv in 1973, both be-
fore and after the Yom Kippur War. 
Having raised her children as Zion-
ists, she now has three grandchildren 
who were born in Jerusalem, in addi-
tion to her two granddaughters in 
Miami. 
As the JCRC’s executive director, 
Carol has adroitly mobilized and ener-
gized Miami’s Jewish community on 
many levels. She has led our citizen ac-
tivists in building relationships with 
Members of Congress on both sides of 
the aisle, key to the success of the pro- 
Israel movement and the national 
agenda supported by the Jewish Coun-
cil for Public Affairs. 
We have worked together to address 
a multitude of issues facing our com-
munity, from the surge of anti-Semi-
tism and senseless gun violence plagu-
ing our schools and places of worship 
to ensuring we maintain our strong 
U.S.-Israel relationship.

RECOGNIZING SWISHER 
ACQUISITION, INC. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Missouri (Mrs. HARTZLER) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Swisher Acquisi-
tion, Inc., of Warrensburg, Missouri, on 
their 
success 
producing 
American- 
made products. 
Swisher-branded products were cho-
sen to participate in the White House’s 
fourth annual Made in America Prod-
uct Showcase on October 5. This event 
celebrates the hard work and dedica-
tion of American workers, businesses, 
and their products. Businesses from 
each of the 50 States have been invited 
to display their American-made prod-
ucts at the White House. 
It is an honor and achievement for 
Swisher Acquisition, Inc. to be selected 
to represent the great State of Mis-
souri, and I am proud to represent 
them in Congress. 
Swisher Acquisition, Inc. is an out-
door power equipment manufacturer 
dating back to 1945. All products are 
American-made 
and 
commercially 
graded and carried in stores around the 
world, such as Home Depot, Cabela’s, 
Atwoods, and more. 
At the showcase, the Swisher Brand 
Outdoor Power Equipment; ESP Brand-
ed Safe Rooms, Tornado, and Storm 
Shelters; Swisher Branded Agricultural 
Products; 
and 
the 
new 
2021 
Huckleberry’s Hammers and LogOX 
Brand Products will be on display. 
I encourage all to take the oppor-
tunity to view all displayed American- 
made products and see the outcome of 
American ingenuity. 
Please join me in congratulating 
Swisher Acquisition, Inc. on this tre-
mendous accomplishment. 
RECOGNIZING ALL SAINTS’ CHURCH 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the All Saints’ 
Church in Nevada, Missouri, and to cel-
ebrate its 150th year of incorporation 
as a parish on All Saints Day, which 
will be recognized on November 1. 
In November 1870, the All Saints’ 
Church in Nevada was officially orga-
nized, and their church building was 
completed. The parish began making 
positive impacts in their local commu-
nity that continue today. 
The All Saints’ parish expresses their 
love for their fellow neighbors through 
supporting the community outreach 
food pantry with donations of food and 
volunteering. 
All Saints’ also has been a pivotal 
supporting figure through their care 
for domestic violence victims and their 
selfless service to their neighbors and 
strangers alike. 
I want to congratulate the All 
Saints’ Church in Nevada, Missouri, for 
150 years of service to the Lord and to 
the community. I wish them God’s con-
tinued blessings in the coming year. 
May your next 150 years be just as 
impactful as your first 150 years. 
HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE OF WILLIAM 
LANE 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, last 
June marks the 70th anniversary of the 
beginning of the Korean war. I rise 
today to honor a selfless hero of that 
war, William Lane. He is a resident of 
Lebanon, Missouri, and a veteran of 
both the Korean and Vietnam conflicts. 
Sergeant First Class Lane was a 
medic in the 24th Infantry Division, 
among the first contingent of U.S. sol-
diers sent to Korea in 1950. He fre-
quently risked his life to render med-
ical assistance and evacuate wounded 
soldiers in the Battles of Chonan, 
Taejon, and the Pusan Perimeter. 
Assigned to the 3rd Infantry Regi-
ment, his unit sustained a casualty 
rate of 39 percent by mid-August. By 
the end of the month, there were only 
184 men of the original 1,898. This cas-
ualty rate is equivalent to some of the 
bloodiest battles of World War II. 
Without the efforts of men like Ser-
geant Lane and his fellow soldiers, the 
outcome of the war may have been de-
cisively different. Sergeant Lane would 
later go on to serve his country for 21 
years in the United States Army. 
From the frozen tundra of Korea to 
the jungles of Vietnam, Sergeant Lane 
went wherever his Nation called him. I 
commend him for his service, and I 
thank him for his commitment to de-
fending our Nation and the freedom- 
loving people of Korea and Vietnam. 
RECOGNIZING BATES COUNTY MEMORIAL 
HOSPITAL 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the Bates County 
Memorial Hospital and their contin-
uous community service over the last 
60 years. 
In 1926, a dedicated community serv-
ant, Mrs. S.C. Stayton, saw a need for 
a local rural hospital in the growing 
city of Butler, Missouri. After renting 
a two-story house, she furnished the 
five rooms upstairs for patients, and 
the first patient was admitted shortly 
after, on June 17, 1926. 
In 1932, during the Great Depression, 
Stayton convinced the city to purchase 
property for a new hospital. On Sep-
tember 16, 1960, Bates County Memorial 
Hospital officially opened. In its first 5 
months, 564 patients were admitted, 
and 87 babies were born. 
Over the years, Bates County Memo-
rial has gone through many additions, 
improvements, 
and 
regulation 
de-
mands. However, Stayton’s original vi-
sion remains, a vision of keeping a 
healthy hospital presence in rural com-
munities. 
Please join me in congratulating 
Bates County Memorial Hospital on 60 
years of service and giving a huge 
thank-you to all the staff for con-
tinuing to serve during these uncertain 
times. 
f 
SPEAKING TO THE SOULS OF 
AMERICA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
am so glad that my colleague invoked 
God’s name on the floor of the House. 
As I stand here, I can read the words 
‘‘In God We Trust.’’ 
We are blessed by a Nation that has 
the right and the protections to ex-
press our faith, our love of the God we 
love. And so I thought this morning I 
was compelled to come to the floor be-
cause I believe in a God of love, and my 
Christian faith believes in the sacrifice 
He made so that we might live and, as 
well, to recognize that He protects us 
all. 
As we go through this road of trepi-
dation with COVID–19, as I mourn for 
more than 200,000 Americans, many of 
whom lost their lives because of ill- 
fated policies by the administration, I 
thought it was imperative that I speak 
to the souls of America because, as my 
predecessor, the Honorable Barbara 
Jordan, I have faith in this Nation. She 
was a good mentor for me and many 
others. She was a patriot, and I have 
tried to be every day of my life. 
I honor the men and women who put 
on the uniform, young boys and girls 
almost, 
young 
men 
and 
women 
throughout the ages. I acknowledge the 
fact that, even with bondage in their 
DNA, slaves volunteered, ex-slaves, to 
fight in the Civil War, but they fought 
in wars before, including the Revolu-
tionary War. 
The heritage of African Americans 
and Black Americans in this country is 
wrapped in the love of the Nation. The 
times that we have stepped out to be 
able to demand justice for our Nation 
and for everyone, it has not been 
against the flag; it has been to em-
power the flag to symbolize the right 
thing. 
How many people realize the number 
of African Americans who died during 
the civil rights movement? I didn’t say 
the Civil War. We lost many in the 
civil rights movement. 
b 1000 
Yes, we know, tragically, brave men 
and women who were not Black who 
came to help lost their lives. The three 
Mississippi boys, Viola Liuzzo, and oth-
ers lost their lives because they be-
lieved in a better America. 
Then I am reminded of the begin-
nings of the takeover of a beautiful 
country called Germany by Nazism. 
The words that I remember in a histor-
ical perspective is: It was the silence 
that killed us. 
Dr. King said that it is not the good 
people who fail, but it is those who

October 1, 2020 
stand by silently and say nothing—so, 
too, the head of this Nation. 
It might have been a lot of bickering 
on Tuesday night in your mind, Mr. 
Speaker, but I can say to you that it 
was a painful experience for so many 
when we could not hear the simple 
words of condemnation of white su-
premacy, even when, as the senior 
member of the Homeland Security 
Committee, I have heard over and over 
again, a member of the Judiciary Com-
mittee, Director Wray of the FBI that 
the most dangerous domestic terrorist 
threat in the United States—not my 
words, his words—is white supremacy, 
or those words coming, as well, from 
the head of the Homeland Security De-
partment, the Secretary. 
I offered an amendment to the Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act that 
was adopted that directs the Secretary 
of Defense to report to Congress the ex-
tent, if any, of the threat to national 
security posed by domestic terrorist 
groups and organizations motivated by 
a belief system of white supremacy 
such as boogaloo boys and proud boys 
extremists. I am proud of the House. 
Obviously, it was adopted in a bipar-
tisan commitment. I am proud that 
Members joined in by their acquies-
cence and affirmation that this is not 
America. 
But over these last couple of days, 
social media is raging. When that ques-
tion was posed to the existing and sit-
ting President of the United States, we 
heard these words when they asked 
would you condemn the proud boys’ vi-
olence, ‘‘stand back and stand by.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, as I close, let me say 
that white supremacy is going to 
strangle us and our values. I beg of this 
leadership and I beg of all of us to 
stand against it, to fight against it, 
and to save lives, because those lives 
are precious American lives, and we are 
not that way. We are better than this, 
Mr. Speaker. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to efforts to 
legitimize violent White Nationalists groups. 
Over the last several months, I have raised 
concerns over the role that Boogaloo and 
Proud Boys have played in bringing an ele-
ment of violence into the otherwise peaceful 
protests following the death of George Floyd. 
During the House Consideration of the 
NOAA, I offered an amendment that was 
adopted to directs the Secretary of Defense to 
report to Congress the extent, if any, of the 
threat to national security posed by domestic 
terrorist groups and organizations motivated 
by a belief system of white supremacy, such 
as the Boogaloo and Proud Boys extremists. 
During the first Presidential debate the 
President had the opportunity to condemn 
Proud Boys, which he could not or would not 
do. 
In the light of day, he claims ignorance of 
who or what Proud Boys is—which sounds 
like the same words he used about not know-
ing David Duke—a former Grand Wizard of 
the KKK who endorsed him during his first 
Presidential Election. 
The President in the interviews with Robert 
Woodward has proven himself to be anything 
but ignorant or uninformed. 
He has shown his willingness to use his 
knowledge for his benefit while keeping his 
knowledge hidden from others at their ex-
pense. 
What I know is that Congress has been 
briefed on the national security threat posed 
by Proud Boys and Boogaloo Boys, which 
means the President has also been briefed. 
On May 30, 2019, the FBI issued an Intel-
ligence Bulletin on Anti-Government, Identity 
Based, and Fringe Political Conspiracy Theo-
ries Very Likely Motivate Some Domestic Ex-
tremists to Commit Criminal, Sometimes Vio-
lent Activity, which includes the activities asso-
ciated with Proud Boys and Boogaloo Boys. 
Proud Boys is described by the Southern 
Poverty Law Center as a hate group. 
The ADL describes Proud Boys as: 
Ideology: Primarily alt lite: Misogynistic, 
Islamophobic, transphobic and anti-immi-
gration. Some members espouse white su-
premacist and anti-Semitic ideologies and/or 
engage with white supremacist groups. 
In sum, the Proud Boys is a far-right neo- 
fascist organization that admits only men as 
members and promotes political violence. 
The group believes men—especially white 
men—and Western culture are under siege; 
their views have elements of white genocide 
conspiracy theory. 
While the group claims it does not support 
white supremacist views, its members often 
participate in racist rallies, events, and organi-
zations. 
The organization glorifies violence, and 
members engage in violence at events they 
attend; the Southern Poverty Law Center has 
called it an ‘‘altright fight club’’. 
The President’s message when asked about 
condemning the White Supremist Group— 
Proud Boys, was to say to them ‘‘Stand Back 
and Stand By.’’ 
It surprises absolutely no one that ‘‘Stand 
Back and Stand By,’’ means to be ready . 
Ready for what? 
The intelligence community has been send-
ing warnings to the White House and Con-
gress that groups like Proud Boys are a threat 
to our national security and have been waiting 
for someone like the President to incite others 
to join them in order to grow their numbers to 
spread violence. 
As I speak, the Internet is ablaze with activ-
ity from the Proud Boys in celebration and ela-
tion of their favorable recognition of the Presi-
dent. 
Proud Boys created a new image to signify 
the President’s message to them, ‘‘Stand Back 
and Stand By.’’ 
We know from experience how people like 
members of Proud Boys react when they be-
lieve they have legitimacy from the President; 
they take it as a license to continue their vio-
lent activities as we said four years ago, cul-
minating in Charlottesville, Virginia. 
Proud Boys may use the phrase ‘‘Stand 
Back and Stand By’’ to describe the over-
whelming majority of white Americans who are 
not aware of or interested in the activities of 
the group or any white supremist group, but 
may intend to support this President in No-
vember despite his obvious flaws. 
The unfortunate truth for voters who think 
their vote this November is not at risk of send-
ing an affirming nod to Proud Boys or groups 
like them—then they should think again. 
President’s own acts makes this election no 
longer about Red or Blue States, Democrats 
and Republicans, but about whether you con-
done racism, misogyny, or political and elec-
tion violence. 
White Nationalists will interpret every white 
voter’s vote for Trump as a vindication of their 
hate, misogyny, and rage against non-whites 
and independent women. 
Let us not be fooled, these groups hate a lot 
of things—and the color of a person’s skin is 
just one of those things—they also hate 
women who are educated, who are leaders, 
who dare to think for themselves; they hate 
white men who form families with persons of 
other races, and they hate white men who will 
hire, promote, and support persons of color 
and women in employment; they hate edu-
cation, public order, peace and justice that ad-
here to equality for all. 
They do love one thing—violence. 
Our role as Members of Congress is to de-
fend and protect the American people, no mat-
ter their race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orienta-
tion, or country of origin. 
White Nationalists have been busy looking 
for fights and igniting violence at peaceful 
street protests. 
We saw them in Charlottesville, Virginia and 
have seen them trying to end state and local 
measures to slow the spread of COVID–19 
and carrying out violence at George Floyd pro-
tests. 
Now the President is inviting Proud Boys to 
polling locations during ballot casting. 
COVID–19 is presenting a heightened bar-
rier and challenge to voting in the November 
3rd election. 
The validity of the American vote and the 
ability for Americans to exercise their vote is 
in jeopardy from a President who seems to be 
at war with the free and fair election process. 
Over the years, it has become increasingly 
hard for citizens to realize their voting rights— 
particularly for African Americans and other 
minorities, as well as for students, the elderly, 
and individuals with disabilities. 
Voter suppression measures across the 
country in the past included: new voter ID 
laws, reductions and cuts to polling places and 
early voting, and purging of voter rolls, but 
today there are challenges being made to 
mail-in voting during a time of COVID–19 
when in-person voting would pose health risks 
to many voters. 
The doubts the President is seeking to cre-
ate around mail-in voting are resulting in sig-
nificant burdens for individuals seeking to ex-
ercise their most fundamental constitutional 
right. 
With varied systems of election administra-
tion and technology, polling place practices, 
and inexperienced poll workers, there is a real 
and dangerous threat that White Nationalists 
may take this opening provided by the Presi-
dent to compromise our nation’s electoral 
process. 
During a time when the voting rights of mi-
norities and all Americans are under the great-
est attack since the passage of the Voting 
Rights Act, it is imperative that the federal 
government take all necessary steps to ensure 
that the right to vote and the entire electoral 
process is fully protected and upheld. 
It is important to know and understand that 
the Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act 
never mention color, ethnicity, or race. 
Both of these laws are to preserve and pro-
tect basic human rights and dignity owed to 
each person.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5118 
October 1, 2020 
This may be the election year when the vot-
ing rights of a majority of Americans may need 
both of these laws. 
That is why I am asking the Department of 
Justice, pursuant to its statutory authority and 
consistent with its historic role as a guardian 
of civil rights and liberties, to take immediate 
action and investigate the full scope of 
vulnerabilities, security threats and breaches 
to our electoral and voting process posed by 
groups like Proud Boys. 
This President finds it too difficult to call out 
those among us who are the truly abhorrent 
and objectionable because they are at the 
heart of his political base. 
The violence seen during the recent national 
movement to end the deaths of unarmed black 
men while in police custody is not the start of 
the events that have led to the Boogaloo 
movement or Proud Boys activity. 
Groups like these have been around for 
over a century, most notable is the KKK, 
which is why they should not be invited to visit 
polling locations during a public election. 
According to the Southern Poverty Law 
Center (SPLC), in the immediate aftermath of 
Election Day, a wave of hate crimes and less-
er hate incidents swept the country with 1,094 
bias incidents recorded in the first 34 days fol-
lowing Trump’s Election on November 8, 
2016. 
Of these incidents, the SPLC reports that 
anti-immigrant incidents (315) remain the most 
reported, followed by antiblack (221), anti- 
Muslim (112), and anti-LGBT (109). 
Anti-Trump incidents numbered 26 (6 of 
which were also anti-white in nature, with 2 
non-Trump related anti-white incidents re-
ported). 
The threats from White Nationalist groups 
range from decentralized and leaderless 
accelerationist networks using social media 
platforms, such as the Boogaloo movement, to 
more structured, far-right militia extremist 
groups. 
The ideologies undergirding these move-
ments or groups have some similarities to 
other anti-government and white supremacist 
beliefs but are often not tied to a single, mon-
olithic ideology. 
In addition, in many cases, their adherents’ 
decentralized, and coded use of digital tools 
poses unique challenges for law enforcement 
and government officials to identify and track 
their activity. 
These developments in domestic terrorism, 
as reported in the media and government in-
telligence reports—coupled with recent arrests 
and successful violent attacks carried out by 
‘‘Boogaloo boys’’ and militia extremists—are 
troubling. 
My concern is that as the nation moves to-
wards a historic national election, the activity 
of violence instigators like Boogaloo Boys or 
Proud Boys will increase and lead to attacks 
becoming more frequent. 
This view is heightened given the Presi-
dent’s instructions to Proud Boys to ‘‘Stand 
Back’’ and ‘‘Stand By.’’ 
The domestic terrorism issues of greatest 
concern to me are: 
The number of incidents, although small in 
number, that have involved government em-
ployees, contractors or military personnel; 
The targeting of places of worship; 
Politically motivated attacks or attempted at-
tacks; and 
Use of Social media for domestic and inter-
national hate groups to collaborate and stoke 
hate. 
Icreasingly everyday the President confirms 
his candidacy as candidate of white suprem-
acy. 
A quote from Lincoln’s address to Congress 
in December 1862 come to mind, when he 
said to this body: 
‘‘Fellow-citizens, we cannot escape history. 
We of this Congress and this administration, 
will be remembered in spite of ourselves. No 
personal significance, or insignificance, can 
spare one or another of us. The fiery trial 
through which we pass, will light us down, in 
honor or dishonor, to the latest generation. We 
say we are for the Union. The world will not 
forget that we say this. We know how to save 
the Union. The world knows we do know how 
to save it. We—even we here—hold the power 
and bear the responsibility.’’ 
Due to the rise in online activity of these 
groups spurred by the President’s comments 
many law enforcement jurisdictions around the 
nation must prepare for the violence that may 
come as these groups seek to act out in ad-
vance of the election. 
This will put additional strain on the budgets 
of local and state law enforcement agencies 
already burdened with COVID–19 emergency 
measures and tight budgets caused by the 
economic collapse due to this Administration’s 
mismanagement of COVID–19. 
Congress must send a unified message that 
there is no place in the body politic for these 
groups or these views. 
I invite my colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle to do what the President did not do by 
joining me and Vice President Biden and mil-

f 
OPPOSITION TO DEFUNDING 
POLICE DEPARTMENTS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Indiana (Mr. BAIRD) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the heroic efforts of West 
Lafayette 
Police 
Officer 
Brian 
Danosky. 
On the morning of August 27, Officer 
Danosky 
found 
22-year-old 
Troy 
Moffitt, who was bleeding from a gun-
shot wound. Not knowing if the shooter 
was still in the area, Officer Danosky 
ignored the danger to his life and 
rushed to save Mr. Moffitt. Officer 
Danosky 
applied 
a 
tourniquet 
to 
Moffitt’s leg, an act that saved Mr. 
Moffitt’s life. 
Officer Danosky went above and be-
yond the call of duty and risked his 
own safety to save the life of a citizen 
he swore to protect and serve. For that, 
Officer Danosky will be the third offi-
cer in the last 10 years to receive the 
Silver Merit Award. 
I commend Officer Danosky for his 
act of bravery, and on behalf of all 
Hoosiers in the Fourth District, I 
thank him for his service. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
offer 
Officer 
Danosky’s story to my colleagues not 
only to highlight his heroic actions, 
but to remind them that our police of-
ficers are dedicated public servants 
who want to protect their commu-
nities. 
Unfortunately, there is a growing 
movement to disparage and defund our 
law enforcement officers. There are 
even some in this Congress who advo-
cate defunding police departments. We 
are already seeing the disastrous ef-
fects happening over our country in 
cities where they slice police budgets. 
New York City took $1 billion from 
their police budget amid rising crime. 
In July, the city saw a 59 percent in-
crease in murders compared to last 
year. 
The city of Minneapolis is pushing to 
eliminate their police department at a 
time when they are seeing a spike in 
murders. 
What makes this rise in crime even 
more tragic is that the victims are 
often from underserved communities, 
the same communities, we are told, 
that will benefit from fewer police offi-
cers in their neighborhoods. 
These communities are no different 
from the communities in my district. 
They want the same thing: good jobs, 
good schools, safe communities, and a 
place to raise their families. 
I will continue to support our police 
officers and oppose any efforts to 
defund them. 
SUPPORTING THE SECOND AMENDMENT 
Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to support the millions of Americans 
who 
are 
exercising 
their 
Second 
Amendment right and becoming law- 
abiding gun owners. 
As people across our Nation and 
across our country watch riots and 
crime consume our cities and the elect-
ed leaders in those cities do little or 
nothing to stop it, people will ensure 
they have the means to defend them-
selves and their family. These millions 
of Americans who are purchasing these 
firearms are exercising their God-given 
and constitutional right to self-de-
fense. 
Since March of this year, at least 1.5 
million firearms have been sold every 
month. I pledge to these new gun own-
ers that I will not only work to restore 
law and order to our communities, but 
also protect the Second Amendment 
and make certain every American has 
the right to protect themselves and 
their families. 
E PLURIBUS UNUM 
Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to remind my fellow citizens that, de-
spite our differences and beliefs and 
our deep divisions, we can still come 
together as one nation under one flag. 
We remember the words stitched on 
our Nation’s first seal, ‘‘e pluribus 
unum,’’ ‘‘out of many, one.’’ No matter 
where you came from, what creed you 
follow, or the color of your skin, we are 
one nation united under the banner of 
freedom. 
This great experiment in self-govern-
ment that we call the United States of 
America has been able to achieve great 
things like defeating Nazi Germany 
and landing a man on the Moon be-
cause we came together as one. When 
we stand shoulder to shoulder, there is 
no obstacle our country can’t over-
come. 
I ask every American to reflect and 
remember the bonds that unite us and

CELEBRATING INDEPENDENT 
RESTAURANTS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Oregon (Mr. BLUMENAUER) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to celebrate the Independent 
Restaurant Coalition who have been 
my partners on the RESTAURANTS 
Act that is currently being negotiated 
between the Speaker and the White 
House. This coalition has willed this 
legislation into effect. 
It is comprised of chefs Jose Andres, 
Nina Compton, Andrew Zimmern, Tom 
Colicchio, Naomi Pomeroy, Gregory 
Gourdet, 
Erika 
Polmar, 
Bobbie 
Stuckey, Robert St. John, and Will 
Guidara. 
Mr. Speaker, these key leaders have 
represented 500,000 independent res-
taurants across America and their 11 
million workers. They are sort of the 
point of the spear for the 180-member 
steering committee who have extended 
themselves in an extraordinary fashion 
in helping craft targeted legislation. 
They make the case to the American 
public that restaurants—independent 
restaurants—are the cornerstone and 
the very fabric of our communities. 
It is hard to imagine your city or 
mine, Mr. Speaker, without these inde-
pendent restaurants. For many people 
it is the first job that they get. They 
are representative of minorities, and 
they are disproportionately women- 
owned. They have an energy and a vi-
tality. They provide an area for Ameri-
cans to come together. In the time of 
COVID–19, we miss that opportunity to 
gather, and we need to take action to 
make sure that they remain in busi-
ness. 
That is what the coalition has done. 
Uniting behind the RESTAURANTS 
Act, they have made the case to people 
all across the country. They have driv-
en Members in the House and the Sen-
ate to cosponsor legislation—well over 
200 in the House and 40 companion bills 
in the Senate—making the case that 
there is something that we can do. 
The need here is to have a tailored 
approach. Without something specific 
for independent restaurants, we face 85 
percent of them closing their doors per-
manently by the end of the year. The 
restaurant industry of these inde-
pendent restaurants are the hardest hit 
segment of the American economy. In 
April alone they accounted for half the 
unemployed. 
We have united behind a proposal of 
$120 billion in direct grants to res-
taurants. The PPP simply isn’t work-
ing for them. It is too cumbersome; the 
time constraints don’t work; and, as a 
practical matter, we don’t need to 
change the format that we have devel-
oped. We have extensive research that 
documents if we are able to extend this 
$120 billion lifeline to the independent 
restaurants, then we will avoid over 
$183 billion of costs for unemployment 
and having these institutions file bank-
ruptcy rather than paying their taxes. 
They support the supply chains in 
every community. That includes not 
just the restaurant workers and owners 
but deals with the people who supply 
them with the linens, the fruits, the 
vegetables, and the wine. This is an ex-
tensive supply chain that stretches 
throughout the local economy. 
The good news is that we have 
progress. The Heroes Act includes the 
RESTAURANTS Act in its entirety 
with the full $120 billion. Yesterday 
there was extensive discussion with our 
leadership and the White House. We 
had earlier conversations in the White 
House with leaders from the Inde-
pendent Restaurant Coalition. I heard 
from Will Guidara from New York City 
about the interaction he had with Sec-
retary Mnuchin, and President Trump 
was there as a part of it. 
This is something that we can do. We 
can come together, support this provi-
sion in the Heroes Act, and negotiate 
out in terms of the final package to 
make sure that we protect this lifeline 
for these vital institutions for all our 
communities. 
I deeply appreciate the interest and 
momentum that has been developed in 
both the House and Senate; the people 
who are stepping forward to help their 
independent restaurants and the mem-
bers of the coalition; and, most of all, 
I want to thank the members of the co-
alition who represent this critical in-
dustry and a potential solution to 
those problems. 
f 
BREAST CANCER AWARENESS 
MONTH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Indiana (Mrs. BROOKS) for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speak-
er, October is Breast Cancer Awareness 
Month, so it is fitting that I rise today 
in support of H.R. 4078, the EARLY Act 
Reauthorization, 
which 
passed 
the 
House earlier this week. I am honored 
to have co-led this bipartisan legisla-
tion with my good friend, colleague, 
and breast cancer survivor, Represent-
ative DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. 
This is an important public health 
bill to ensure that young women 
throughout the United States under-
stand the importance of breast health 
and the value of regular breast cancer 
screenings. 
This bipartisan bill raises public 
awareness about breast health and edu-
cates healthcare providers to encour-
age early detection of breast cancer. It 
also supports initiatives and research 
to help identify high-risk women by 
collecting family histories and edu-
cating patients about early warning 
signs. 
These programs are vitally impor-
tant. We all know the statistics. One in 
eight women in the United States will 
be diagnosed with breast cancer over 
her lifetime, and many women with 
breast cancer typically have no symp-
toms. 
This disease has taken far too many 
of our loved ones. In 2017, breast cancer 
was the number one most diagnosed 
cancer type in the United States and 
the number two most deadly. 
Earlier this year, I lost a very dear 
friend to this terrible disease, Judy 
Christofilis. She and I had volunteered 
in the Junior League in Indianapolis 
over 20 years ago. She was a successful 
accountant, a pillar of the Indianapolis 
community, and, above all, a dedicated 
philanthropist. 
She was on the board of the Indianap-
olis Day Nursery, Indiana’s oldest and 
largest early childhood education non-
profit. She was extremely active in the 
Junior League of Indianapolis and the 
Indianapolis Art Center. 
But in the last decade of her life, 
when she was battling breast cancer, 
she was a founding member of the Indi-
anapolis 
American 
Cancer 
Society 
Guild and served as its treasurer. The 
guild’s mission is to support the cen-
tral Indiana office of the American 
Cancer Society by generating aware-
ness, raising funds, and providing sup-
port for community outreach programs 
to achieve the shared goal of savings 
lives by helping people stay well, get 
well, find cures, and fight back. 
b 1015 
This mission epitomizes Judy’s fight 
against breast cancer. She battled 
metastatic breast cancer for more than 
a decade. Her resilience, and spirit, 
served as an inspiration to me and so 
many others in our community. 
Her story is just a reminder of why 
breast cancer screening is vitally im-
portant, and it is often the best and 
only way to identify this cancer in its 
earliest stages. Women—even young 
women—are susceptible to this deadly 
disease, which is why regular breast 
screenings are so crucially important. 
Our bill reauthorizes the program 
through fiscal year 2024, and it funds 
CDC programs to identify gaps in edu-
cation 
and 
awareness, 
particularly 
among young women and healthcare 
providers. It supports young survivors 
through grants to organizations fo-
cused on helping them cope with the 
many unique challenges they face as 
young women and in implementing a 
targeted media campaign to reach 
young and higher-risk women. 
The science is clear: Early detection 
is the single most effective way to stop 
these cancers before they become dead-
ly. 
In my very last conversation with 
Judy before she passed away in March 
of this year, she asked me to keep up 
the fight for all people battling cancer. 
This bill, in large part, for me, is dedi-
cated to my very dear, close friend 
Judy Christofolis. She truly is one of 
my heroes. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge our Senate col-
leagues to pass this important bill this 
month during Breast Cancer Awareness 
Month.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5120 
October 1, 2020 
U.S. CENTER FOR SAFESPORT 
Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speak-
er, I urge my colleagues to pass S. 2330, 
the Empowering Olympic Paralympic 
and Amateur Athletes Act of 2020. 
This bill is the result of several years 
of work that began in 2016. Indiana’s 
very own Indianapolis Star broke the 
story about former USA Gymnastics’ 
team doctor, Larry Nassar’s abuse of 
athletes under his care. Several years 
have passed since Dr. Nassar went to 
prison, but Congress has continued to 
work to ensure this kind of abuse never 
happens again. 
In 2017, I led the charge in the House 
to address the horrible situation by in-
troducing the Protecting Young Vic-
tims from Sexual Abuse Act. I was 
grateful to see it pass the House and 
see it get signed into law. 
That law established the U.S. Center 
for SafeSport as the entity responsible 
for developing policies that all U.S. 
Olympic governing bodies must imple-
ment to better protect their athletes 
and, most critically, the center was 
charged with investigating claims of 
abuse against amateur U.S. athletes. 
The center has received hundreds of 
claims they are responsible for inves-
tigating. And, today, with the passage 
of this bill later today, we will help en-
sure they will be able to fulfill that 
mandate. 
When it was originally conceived, the 
center was not provided a steady rev-
enue stream, but today S. 2330 will re-
quire the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic 
Committee to provide direct funding to 
the U.S. Center for SafeSport to guar-
antee it stays committed to protecting 
athletes. 
This reform, along with many others 
included 
in 
Empowering 
Olympic, 
Paralympic, 
and 
Amateur 
Athletes 
Act, will bring much-needed further re-
form to ensure our young athletes will 
not have to suffer at the hands of an-
other in their quest for gold. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues 
to support this measure.

RECESS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair

Accordingly (at 10 o’clock and 18 
minutes a.m.), the House stood in re-
cess.

AFTER RECESS 
The recess having expired, the House 
was called to order by the Speaker pro

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick 
J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: 
Loving God, we give You thanks for 
giving us another day. 
Send us Your spirit of peace. Inspire 
the Members of the people’s House this 
day with Your spirit of wisdom, pa-
tience, and understanding in the work 
they do. 
Throughout our country, the effects 
of the coronavirus plague continue. 
Keep safe those who are in harm’s way: 
healthcare professionals, those engaged 
in delivering goods and services to our 
communities, and teachers at all lev-
els. 
Comfort and send Your spirit of heal-
ing to those who suffer from illness and 
those who mourn those who have died. 
Lord God, have mercy on us. 
May all that is done this day be for 
Your greater honor and glory. 
Amen.

Mr. SCHIFF led the Pledge of Alle-

I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair will entertain up to 15 requests 
for 1-minute speeches on each side of

EVERY AMERICAN DESERVES 
QUALITY HEALTHCARE 
(Mr. SCHIFF asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, Martin 
Luther King, Jr. once said: ‘‘Of all the 
forms of inequality, injustice in health 
is the most shocking and the most in-
human because it often results in phys-
ical death.’’ 
As our Nation confronts the crisis of 
coronavirus, we must also confront the 
crisis of systemic racism in our soci-
ety. Nowhere is the fight for racial jus-
tice more urgent than in the field of 
health. 
The legislation I introduced this 
week would create a clear and forcible 
standard for equal healthcare, treating 
it as a civil rights issue, as it is, and 
provide strong tools to identify inequi-
table care and correct it wherever it is 
found. 
I acknowledge and thank Dwayne 
Hall, whose own family experience with 
bias in healthcare was a driving force 
behind this legislation and without 
whose leadership this bill would not 
have been possible. 
Every 
American 
deserves 
quality 
care and every American deserves 
equal care. I look forward to working 
with my colleagues on this bill to 
make health equity a reality in this 
country. 
f 
HONORING BLAKE HURST 
(Mrs. WAGNER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mrs. WAGNER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the tremendous 
service of a leader in Missouri agri-
culture, Mr. Blake Hurst. 
Starting out as a young farmer in 
northwest 
Missouri, 
Blake 
rose 
through the ranks of the Missouri 
Farm Bureau to become a statewide 
board member, vice president, and, fi-
nally, president in 2010. Over his ten-
ure, Blake brought the organization to 
new heights and developed a national 
reputation for his expertise in agri-
culture policy. 
After decades of service, Blake plans 
to retire this year and spend more time 
on his farm with his loving wife, Julie, 
and their beautiful family. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Blake for 
his unwavering support for Missouri 
farmers and wish him the very best as 
he begins this new chapter in his life. 
f 
AMERICA CAN AGAIN BE A 
WELCOMING NATION 
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam 
Speaker, one of the first actions of this 
administration was to shut down our 
Nation’s doors to families, women, and 
children around the world fleeing vio-
lence and seeking refuge within our 
borders. 
These bans showed a lack of decency 
and empathy, and they ignored the les-
sons 
of 
history. 
Immigrants 
built 
America, and they helped sustain and 
expand all that is good in a just and 
free society. 
The President’s ignorance of this his-
tory is perhaps the point of his policy, 
one that he uses to exploit and divide. 
Reports now show that the country in-
tends to admit only 15,000 refugees this 
year, down from nearly 100,000 4 years 
ago. 
The refugee community in western 
New York has helped revitalize entire 
neighborhoods, bringing diversity, cul-
ture, and new economic opportunity. 
The organizations that support refu-
gees, like the International Institute of 
Buffalo, Journey’s End, Jewish Family 
Services, and others, continue to do 
their work with dwindling Federal sup-
port, but still they continue to do their 
good work. 
I believe that we can once again be a 
generous and welcoming nation to the 
world’s most vulnerable. It is impera-
tive for our future that we do so. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the 
President.

October 1, 2020 
COMMEMORATING THE LIFE OF 
WINSTON GROOM 
(Mr. BYRNE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. BYRNE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to commemorate the life of a 
man I was proud to call a constituent 
and a friend, the great author Winston 
Groom. 
Winston passed away recently in 
Fairhope, Alabama, after a long and vi-
brant life whose words touched untold 
millions around the globe. Most of 
America knows Winston is the author 
of ‘‘Forrest Gump,’’ the timeless Amer-
ican novel adapted into the classic film 
of the same name. 
Winston and I share a hometown, Mo-
bile, and, as adults, lived near each 
other in Fairhope. I was blessed to be 
able to develop a friendship with Win-
ston over the past several decades. 
Our State of Alabama, particularly 
southwest Alabama, is renowned for 
the quality of writers we have pro-
duced. We are also renowned for the 
colorful qualities of many of those 
writers. 
Winston was not only an incredible 
talent who will leave a lasting impact 
on the literary world, but one of the 
most colorful characters to ever call 
Alabama 
home. 
As 
Forrest 
Gump 
would say: ‘‘That’s all I have to say 
about that.’’ 
I wish Winston’s family all the best, 
and I thank them for sharing Winston 
with the world. 
f 
DEMOCRATS ARE FIGHTING FOR 
ALL AMERICANS 
(Mr. HOYER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, since 
the beginning of this Congress, House 
Democrats have fought for the people. 
From lowering healthcare costs to rais-
ing wages by rebuilding America, to 
cleaning up corruption and strength-
ening democracy, House Democrats 
have passed major legislation and 
shown the American people what our 
priorities are. 
At the same time, sadly, Republicans 
have also made clear what their prior-
ities are, priorities the American peo-
ple, in my view, do not share, for exam-
ple, and particularly, on healthcare. 
For years, Madam Speaker, President 
Trump and Republicans have been tell-
ing the American people that they 
have a plan that is better than the Af-
fordable Care Act which will cover 
more Americans. As a matter of fact, 
the President said he would cover ev-
erybody at a lower cost and higher 
quality. Not a single Member of this 
House can rise and say, ‘‘I know what 
the President’s bill is,’’ because they 
have never seen it after 3 years and 8 
months. 
But after years with no plan being 
put forward, it is clear exactly what 
their plan really is: Eliminate the Af-
fordable Care Act and offer nothing in 
return. They continue to tell the 
American people, ‘‘You are on your 
own.’’ 
They tried to repeal or undermine 
the Affordable Care Act more than 65 
times in Congress and failed. Now they 
are trying to overturn the law in court, 
and they are attempting to ram a Su-
preme Court nominee through in order 
to do what they failed to do through 
the legislative process, of course, after 
saying that we ought not to consider a 
Supreme Court nominee in an election 
year because we ought to let the people 
speak. 
In fact, the people spoke in 2016 and 
voted for Hillary Clinton by over a 3 
million disparity. Republicans didn’t 
care. They wanted to know what the 
electoral college said. And, of course, 
that is our Constitution, but it is not 
the people speaking. 
The fight over this nominee is very 
much about the ability of Americans to 
access quality, affordable healthcare. 
When Democrats came into the ma-
jority, we took immediate action, 
Madam Speaker, to defend the Afford-
able Care Act in court and stand up for 
its protections for more than 130 mil-
lion Americans with preexisting condi-
tions. 
What can we expect if Republicans 
succeed in ending the Affordable Care 
Act? 
Free 
preventative 
screenings 
and 
services, gone. 
The guarantee of coverage for those 
with preexisting conditions without 
higher premiums, gone. 
The ability to get covered under your 
parents’ plans if you are younger than 
26, gone. 
The ban on lifetime and annual lim-
its of coverage, gone. 
That is what we are defending for the 
people and what we will continue to 
protect. 
Madam Speaker, we also took real 
action to lower prescription drug costs 
with the passage of H.R. 3 and other 
legislation—not a gimmick like Presi-
dent Trump’s meaningless executive 
orders or his illegal coupon cards that 
endanger the future of Medicare, but 
real action to benefit those who need 
more affordable prescription drugs. 
And when an unprecedented, deadly 
pandemic swept across the globe and 
on to our shores, House Democrats led 
the way with swift action, enacting 
four bipartisan laws and passing a fifth 
bill, the Heroes Act, 41⁄2 months ago. 
No action in the United States Senate 
for 31⁄2 months, and then a lame effort, 
which was not supported by Repub-
licans in the Senate and certainly no 
Democrats in the Senate. 
President Trump and the Republican 
Senate, however, have blocked the He-
roes Act so necessary for those on un-
employment, so necessary for those 
who are trying to feed their families, 
so necessary for family support, so nec-
essary for small businesses, so nec-
essary for hospital workers and those 
who are administering testing, and so 
necessary for the States and localities 
that are hiring police, firefighters, 
sanitation workers—the critical per-
sonnel necessary to help confront this 
virus. 
Where Democrats have said we are in 
this together, President Trump has 
said it is what it is. 
Let me say to the American people: 
What it is does not have to be. 
House Democrats have shown that 
there is a better way to lead and a 
more responsible way to govern in this 
crisis. 
Democrats have also been fighting to 
make 
our 
economy 
work, 
Madam 
Speaker, for the people while Repub-
licans fight to make our economy work 
for the wealthy. That is why they are 
fighting about the tax provision that 
they put into the CARES Act, which 
we think ought to be deleted because it 
is for the wealthy, not for those who 
are struggling. 
In 2017, President Trump and Repub-
licans enacted an unpaid-for $1.5 tril-
lion tax cut where 83 percent, more 
than 8 out of 10 Americans who got re-
lief in that tax act were some of the 
wealthiest people in America, the top 1 
percent. That bill also raised taxes on 
86 million middle-class households. 
In contrast, Madam Speaker, House 
Democrats have used our majority to 
benefit working families and grow our 
economy. We voted to raise the min-
imum wage and ensure equal pay for 
equal work for women. It lies unat-
tended in the United States Senate. 
Senator MCCONNELL will not bring it 
up. 
We invested in new infrastructure 
and 
clean 
energy 
innovation 
that 
drives growth of new, high-paying 
American jobs. It sits untended in the 
United States Senate. 
b 1115 
House Democrats have been working 
to make government more transparent 
and accountable to the people. 
Our majority moved swiftly, Madam 
Speaker, to pass the strongest and 
most comprehensive government re-
form legislation in decades, the For the 
People Act. 
That bill will hold government offi-
cials more accountable, increase trans-
parency and ethical standards, and in-
crease voter protections while insti-
tuting national redistricting reforms. 
Where is it? In the Senate left 
untended, unconsidered by the United 
States Senate, because it is on MCCON-
NELL’s desk and he will not move it. 
While this President and Republicans 
continue to make it harder for Ameri-
cans to vote, and sow confusion and un-
certainty 
about 
balloting, 
House 
Democrats passed H.R. 4 to restore the 
John Lewis Act, to restore the protec-
tions in the Voting Rights Act that so 
many fought for, demonstrated for, and 
died for. 
But unfortunately, too many in this 
country are trying to make it more dif-
ficult, not easier, to cast that central 
facet of being a citizen in a democracy, 
the right to vote.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5122 
October 1, 2020 
That is one of the 340 bipartisan bills 
that 
are 
languishing 
on 
Senator 
MCCONNELL’s desk. He will not call 
them up before the Senate for a vote, 
muzzling democracy. 
That is 340 important bipartisan bills 
blocked, stalled, or ignored. 
Madam Speaker, let’s not forget that 
we began our majority in the middle of 
a damaging and irresponsible govern-
ment shutdown, the longest shutdown 
that I have experienced in the 40 years 
I have been here. 
We moved swiftly to end that shut-
down and prioritize the passage of 
funding bills last year and this year be-
fore the end of July in order to prevent 
another shutdown of our government. 
So last year we passed 8 of the 10 ap-
propriation bills by June 26. This year, 
we passed 8 of those 10, notwith-
standing COVID, by July 26. 
The Senate has not passed out of 
committee a single appropriation bill, 
not one, Madam Speaker. 
What have they been doing? Judge 
after judge after judge after judge. 
That is what they are doing, to serve 
their ideological agenda, hoping that 
they can control through the courts 
that which they cannot control in the 
democratic process. 
We have shown, Madam Speaker, 
what it means to govern for the people, 
and over the next few weeks, Ameri-
cans will have a chance to choose the 
direction our country follows in the 
years ahead. They know that Repub-
licans have failed them: no healthcare 
bill, no infrastructure bill that the 
President talked about in the cam-
paign, ‘‘I am going to invest in infra-
structure.’’ No bill has been presented 
by the President to do that, no 
healthcare bill. 
They know that our Republican col-
leagues have failed them through their 
inaction and irresponsibility. 
And they know, Madam Speaker, 
that Democrats have offered a serious 
agenda 
of 
leadership, 
have 
dem-
onstrated the capacity to govern re-
sponsibly, and have shown ourselves al-
ways to be for the people. 
Madam Speaker, today we will be 
considering a bill. We are in negotia-
tions. I hope those negotiations work. 
Frankly, Speaker PELOSI
and Sec-
retary Mnuchin reached four bipartisan 
deals. Mr. MEADOWS was not chief of 
staff, of course, at that point in time. 
Let us hope that we can reach a bipar-
tisan deal. 
We were supposed to consider our He-
roes 2 bill, our offer, our proffer, our 
statement of what we think is nec-
essary to uplift the American people, 
to let them know they are not on their 
own, we are with them, we are to-
gether. 
We will consider that bill today if 
there is not an agreement. I hope there 
is an agreement. I hope we have a bi-
partisan piece of legislation that we 
can pass in the near future, because the 
American people need it, and that is 
what we have done in the past. Let’s 
hope we can do it today. 
BREAST CANCER AWARENESS 
MONTH 
(Mr. GUEST asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. GUEST. Madam Speaker, Octo-
ber is Breast Cancer Awareness Month, 
a time to call attention to this deadly 
disease, to recognize the advancement 
our Nation has made in the battle 
against breast cancer, and to spread in-
formation about the fight to save the 
lives of those impacted. 
It is estimated that more than 275,000 
new cases of breast cancer will be diag-
nosed this year. For this reason, it is 
vital that those at risk take proper 
steps to reduce their risk for this dis-
ease. 
Our medical personnel have made 
great progress in our fight to cure 
breast cancer, but we must continue to 
do more. 
Madam Speaker, I hope everybody 
will join me this month in spreading 
awareness about breast cancer, com-
forting those who have been impacted 
or are fighting cancer right now, and 
thanking our medical personnel for 
their dedication to treat and cure this 
deadly disease. 
f 
DON’T TAKE THE RIGHT TO VOTE 
FOR GRANTED 
(Ms. SCANLON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, our 
elections are foundational to our de-
mocracy, the pulse of our Nation, and 
the most sacred form of protest that 
we as Americans have at our disposal. 
We, the people, have a right to vote 
without 
obstruction, 
without 
fear, 
without intimidation, and with the as-
surance that every vote will be count-
ed. 
Madam Speaker, I want to take a 
minute to assure the American people 
who are receiving mail-in ballots for 
the first time, making a plan to vote 
on election day, looking for locations 
where early voting is taking place, 
signing up to volunteer, or feeling a 
sense of uncertainty as we participate 
in one of the most important elections 
of our lifetime: your vote is safe, your 
vote is secure, and your vote matters. 
And, Madam Speaker, to the young 
people who will be casting their votes 
for the first time: you are the future of 
this country, and we need you to par-
ticipate in our government now more 
than ever. 
To those who have lost faith in our 
government: we, the people, are the 
gatekeepers of our democracy, and our 
participation has never been more im-
portant. 
There is far too much on the line for 
us to take voting for granted. 
f 
THE GIFT OF ADOPTION 
(Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to reach 
out today to the thousands of Ameri-
cans who have opened their homes to 
the gift of adoption. Giving a child a 
home and a better life is one of the 
greatest gifts we can give. 
I especially want to applaud Judge 
Amy Coney Barrett’s effort to help 
bring two children from Haiti out of 
the depths of despair to a better life 
here in America. 
I was doing medical relief work in 
Haiti after the 2010 earthquake, which 
made 80,000 children orphans instantly. 
Children who would literally be 10 feet 
apart from their parents would be sepa-
rated in the chaos, never to see them 
again. 
The Barrett family did a beautiful 
thing by adopting an orphaned child in 
the aftermath of this horrible disaster. 
Her family gave a toddler a new life 
after one of the worst earthquakes in 
recorded history. 
Unfortunately, some misguided souls 
in this country have turned that beau-
tiful act of kindness into one of cre-
ating racial division rather than unity. 
They purport evil motives in a selfless 
act of sacrifice just to create further 
division in our Nation. 
Judge Coney Barrett is now a Su-
preme Court nominee. Let her example 
of knocking down racial barriers and 
creating unity rather than division be 
an example for all of us to follow. 
I look forward to her successful 
placement on the Nation’s highest 
court. 
f 
WE ARE A NATION IN CRISIS 
(Ms. DEAN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. DEAN. Madam Speaker, more 
than 207,000 Americans are dead, and 
there is no end in sight. One in six 
Americans is jobless. 
These are not just numbers. These 
are people. They have lost their liveli-
hoods, their health, their 
careers. 
Many have lost everything. It did not 
have to be this way. 
Our Nation had its first confirmed 
COVID case in January, and yet 9 
months later, there is no national test-
ing strategy, no leadership from the 
White House. 
We have a President who would rath-
er save face, save power to himself, 
than save lives, who corrosively con-
tinues to play politics as people die. 
We are a Nation in crisis. People are 
in despair. 
Government has a role to play. We 
must act with urgency and decency as 
we support one another with direct 
cash relief, funds for State and local 
governments, widespread testing, and 
the guarantee of free COVID treatment 
and vaccines for all. 
Let us live up to Elijah Cummings’ 
command: ‘‘We are better than this.’’

THE UNITED STATES SUPPORTS 
INDIA 
(Mr. BURCHETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, it 
is in the best interests of the United 
States of America to build and main-
tain strong partnerships with our allies 
across the globe. 
In that spirit, I rise today in recogni-
tion of our important relationship with 
one of those allies, the Republic of 
India. 
India, the world’s largest democracy, 
is under constant threat from the Chi-
nese Communist Party. The Chinese 
Communist Party has been acting ag-
gressively towards India in recent 
years and infringing on Indian terri-
tory. 
India is an effective counterweight to 
the Chinese Communist Party’s desire 
for 
dominance 
in 
southeast 
Asia, 
Madam Speaker, and a strong India is 
critical to preventing expansion of the 
Chinese Communist Party’s global in-
fluence. 
I am proud to stand on the floor of 
the House of Representatives today 
with a strong, clear message for our 
friends in India: The United States sup-
ports you in your struggle against Chi-
nese aggressors. Together, our two 
democratic, free nations will stand 
against the communism that only 
seeks to rob citizens of their individ-
uality and beliefs. 
f 
HONORING JONATHAN ‘‘J.T.’’ 
TENNANT 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor 20-year 
veteran harbor pilot Jonathan ‘‘J.T.’’ 
Tennant of Brunswick, Georgia, who 
played a pivotal role in ensuring the 
safety of all crew members aboard the 
Golden Ray carrier when it ship-
wrecked over a year ago on September 
8, 2019. 
If you visit St. Simons Island in 
Georgia’s First Congressional District, 
it is hard to miss the Golden Ray, 
which is a 656-foot-long car carrier that 
remains capsized in the St. Simons 
Sound. 
As the investigation into the inci-
dent by the U.S. Coast Guard and the 
National Transportation Safety Board 
continues, we have been able to gain 
valuable insight from crew members 
and others involved. 
Although he had steered a city-block- 
sized cargo ship from the Brunswick 
River to the St. Simons Sound several 
thousand times, nothing could have 
prepared J.T. for what happened the 
morning of September 8. 
The Golden Ray was sailing nor-
mally, but the rudder and the propeller 
came up out of the water to where J.T. 
had no operational control of the ves-
sel, and it started capsizing rapidly. 
He endured flames melting the steel 
and smoke emanating from airboxes 
the entire length of the ship. 
As testament to his extensive experi-
ence piloting more than 5,000 ships in 
and out of the Port of Brunswick, J.T. 
drove the Golden Ray as far up on the 
Sound as possible that day to ensure 
all 23 mariners aboard were safe and 
rescued. 
When you see the giant cargo ship in 
the Sound and realize there was no loss 
of life, it is nothing short of a miracle 
and a testament to the hardworking 
crew, including J.T. 
Although it is an unfortunate situa-
tion, I am thankful for the courage and 
determination J.T. and the entire crew 
displayed that day. 
f 
A 
DOMESTIC 
MINERAL 
SUPPLY 
CHAIN IS ESSENTIAL FOR OUR 
NATIONAL SECURITY 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, for 
decades, America’s mining industry 
has suffered at the hands of foreign 
competition from China. 
Yesterday, President Trump signed 
an executive order to expand the do-
mestic mining industry, supporting 
thousands of American mining jobs and 
reducing our dependence on China for 
critical minerals. 
A domestic mineral supply chain is 
essential for our national security, be-
cause they are used for military, infra-
structure, and energy projects. 
America certainly should not be de-
pending on China for precious mate-
rials that are critical to our national 
defense. This should rest solely in our 
hands. 
By streamlining development of crit-
ical minerals at home and creating 
jobs for American workers along the 
way, this executive order is a win-win. 
With all the push for renewable en-
ergy in this country and electric vehi-
cles, we certainly need to have this 
supply chain come from our country 
and not somewhere else. 
Madam Speaker, I am grateful for 
President Trump’s bold action to con-
tinue our economic growth while also 
taking bold action against a foreign ad-
versary.

CHILDHOOD CANCER HEARING 
LOSS 
(Mr. BUDD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BUDD. Madam Speaker, over 
15,000 American children are diagnosed 
with cancer every year. Having the 
most innocent among us receive such a 
gut-wrenching diagnosis is devastating. 
Thankfully, incredible progress has 
been made in treating cancer among 
children. As more kids become sur-
vivors, we need to make a concerted ef-
fort to improve their lives and to strive 
to develop treatments that do not 
carry permanent side effects. 
For example, I have constituents 
whose children have experienced per-
manent hearing loss, which can occur 
when young patients undergo chemo-
therapy. That is why I recently sent a 
letter to the Agency for Healthcare Re-
search and Quality asking them to 
identify any research efforts to reverse 
this loss of hearing. 
We owe it to our young survivors to 
help them thrive and maintain a high 
quality of life. I encourage Federal re-
searchers to keep producing the med-
ical miracles that will help our kids 
prevail in the fight against cancer.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5124 
October 1, 2020 
call up House Resolution 1164 and ask 
for its immediate consideration. 
The Clerk read the resolution, as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 1164 
Resolved, That upon adoption of this reso-
lution it shall be in order without interven-
tion of any point of order to consider in the 
House the resolution (H. Res. 1153) con-
demning unwanted, unnecessary medical 
procedures on individuals without their full, 
informed consent. The amendment to the 
resolution printed in the report of the Com-
mittee on Rules accompanying this resolu-
tion shall be considered as adopted. The reso-
lution, as amended, shall be considered as 
read. The previous question shall be consid-
ered as ordered on the resolution and pre-
amble, as amended, to adoption without in-
tervening motion or demand for division of 
the question except one hour of debate equal-
ly divided and controlled by the chair and 
ranking minority member of the Committee 
on the Judiciary. 
SEC. 2. Upon adoption of this resolution it 
shall be in order without intervention of any 
point of order to consider in the House the 
resolution (H. Res. 1154) condemning QAnon 
and rejecting the conspiracy theories it pro-
motes. The resolution shall be considered as 
read. The previous question shall be consid-
ered as ordered on the resolution and pre-
amble to adoption without intervening mo-
tion or demand for division of the question 
except one hour of debate equally divided 
and controlled by the chair and ranking mi-
nority member of the Committee on the Ju-
diciary. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Pennsylvania is recog-
nized for 1 hour. 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, for 
the purpose of debate only, I yield the 
customary 30 minutes to the gentle-
woman from Arizona (Mrs. LESKO), 
pending which I yield myself such time 
as I may consume. During consider-
ation of this resolution, all time yield-
ed is for the purpose of debate only. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers be given 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, on 
Wednesday, the Rules Committee met 
and reported a rule, House Resolution 
1164, providing for consideration of H. 
Res. 1153, condemning unwanted, un-
necessary medical procedures on indi-
viduals without their full, informed 
consent, under a closed rule. 
The rule self-executes a manager’s 
amendment offered by Chairman NAD-
LER, which clarifies the last statement 
in the resolved clause. The rule pro-
vides 1 hour of debate, equally divided 
and controlled by the chair and rank-
ing minority member of the Judiciary 
Committee. 
The rule also provides for consider-
ation of H. Res. 1154, condemning 
QAnon and rejecting the conspiracy 
theories it promotes, under a closed 
rule. The rule provides 1 hour of de-
bate, equally divided and controlled by 
the chair and ranking minority mem-
ber of the Judiciary Committee. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to offer 
the rule for two timely and necessary 
resolutions, one that addresses allega-
tions of gross human rights violations 
conducted under the watch of the 
United States Government and the 
other a long-overdue resolution that 
forcefully condemns QAnon, an anti- 
Semitic, racist, and, frankly, unhinged 
conspiracy theory that has infiltrated 
the internet and infected the rightwing 
of our Nation’s politics. 
Let’s start with H. Res. 1153, offered 
by 
my 
colleague, 
Congresswoman 
JAYAPAL of the House Judiciary Com-
mittee, in response to some of most re-
pulsive and inhumane allegations ever 
directed at a U.S. Federal agency. 
In mid-September, just a couple of 
weeks ago, a whistleblower came for-
ward to disclose that women who have 
been detained for immigration offenses 
at Irwin County Detention Center in 
Georgia, operated by a private prison 
company, LaSalle Corrections, have 
been subjected to a pattern of non-
consensual and inappropriate medical 
treatment, including forced partial and 
full sterilization. 
This complaint was submitted to the 
Office of Inspector General at the De-
partment of Homeland Security and 
outlined concerns raised by a nurse at 
the facility and numerous immigrant 
detainees at the facility. 
While the IG’s investigation is just 
beginning, many of the central allega-
tions in the complaint have already 
been confirmed in reporting by The 
New York Times and by a delegation of 
a dozen of my colleagues who visited 
the detention center last weekend, 
interviewed women who had suffered 
through these procedures, and con-
sulted with medical professionals who 
have reviewed the women’s medical 
records relating to those incidents. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD The New York Times article 
from yesterday entitled ‘‘Immigrants 
Say 
They 
Were 
Pressured 
Into 
Unneeded Surgeries.’’ 
[From the New York Times, Sept. 29, 2020] 
IMMIGRANTS SAY THEY WERE PRESSURED INTO 
UNNEEDED SURGERIES 
(By Caitlin Dickerson, Seth Freed Wessler, 
and Miriam Jordan) 
IMMIGRANTS DETAINED AT AN ICE-CONTRACTED 
CENTER IN GEORGIA SAID THEY HAD INVASIVE 
GYNECOLOGY PROCEDURES THAT THEY LATER 
LEARNED MIGHT HAVE BEEN UNNECESSARY 
Wendy Dowe was startled awake early one 
morning in January 2019, when guards called 
her out of her cellblock in the Irwin County 
immigration detention center in rural Geor-
gia, where she had been held for four months. 
She would be having surgery that day, they 
said. 
Still groggy, the 48-year-old immigrant 
from Jamaica, who had been living without 
legal status in the United States for two dec-
ades before she was picked up by immigra-
tion authorities, felt a swell of dread come 
over her. An outside gynecologist who saw 
patients in immigration custody told her 
that the menstrual cramping she had was 
caused by large cysts and masses that needed 
to be removed, but she was skeptical. The 
doctor insisted, she said, and as a detainee— 
brought to the hospital in handcuffs and 
shackles—she felt pressured to consent. 
It was only after she was deported to Ja-
maica and had her medical files reviewed by 
several other doctors that she knew she had 
been right to raise questions. 
A radiologist’s report, based on images of 
her internal organs from her time at Irwin, 
described her uterus as being a healthy size, 
not swollen with enlarged masses and cysts, 
as the doctor had written in his notes. The 
cysts she had were small, and the kind that 
occur naturally and do not usually require 
surgical intervention. 
‘‘I didn’t have to do any of it,’’ Ms. Dowe 
said. 
The Irwin County Detention Center in 
Ocilla, Ga., drew national attention this 
month after a nurse, Dawn Wooten, filed a 
whistle-blower complaint claiming that de-
tainees had told her they had had their 
uteruses removed without their full under-
standing or consent. 
Since then, both ICE and the hospital in 
Irwin County have released data that show 
that two full hysterectomies have been per-
formed on women detained at Irwin in the 
past three years. But firsthand accounts are 
now emerging from detainees, including Ms. 
Dowe, who underwent other invasive gyneco-
logical procedures that they did not fully un-
derstand and, in some cases, may not have 
been medically necessary. 
At least one lawyer brought the com-
plaints about gynecological care to the at-
tention of the center’s top officials in 2018, 
according to emails obtained by The New 
York Times, but the outside referrals contin-
ued. 
The Times interviewed 16 women who were 
concerned about the gynecological care they 
received while at the center, and conducted a 
detailed review of the medical files of seven 
women who were able to obtain their 
records. All 16 were treated by Dr. Mahendra 
Amin, who practices gynecology in the near-
by town of Douglas and has been described 
by ICE officials as the detention center’s 
‘‘primary gynecologist.’’ 
The cases were reviewed by five gyne-
cologists—four of them board-certified and 
all with medical school affiliations—who 
found that Dr. Amin consistently overstated 
the size or risks associated with cysts or 
masses attached to his patients’ reproduc-
tive organs. Small or benign cysts do not 
typically call for surgical intervention, 
where large or otherwise troubling ones 
sometimes do, the experts said. 
The doctors stressed that in some cases the 
medical files might not have been complete 
and that additional information could poten-
tially shift their analyses. But they noted 
that Dr. Amin seemed to consistently rec-
ommend surgical intervention, even when it 
did not seem medically necessary at the 
time and nonsurgical treatment options were 
available. 
In almost every woman’s chart, Dr. Amin 
listed symptoms such as heavy bleeding with 
clots and chronic pelvic pain, which could 
justify surgery. But some of the women said 
they never experienced or reported those 
symptoms to him. 
Both the reviewing doctors and all of the 
women interviewed by The Times raised con-
cerns about whether Dr. Amin had ade-
quately explained the procedures he per-
formed or provided his patients with less 
invasive 
alternatives. 
Spanish-speaking 
women said a nurse who spoke Spanish was 
only 
sporadically 
present 
during 
their 
exams. 
The diagnoses and procedures are ‘‘poorly 
supported’’ and ‘‘not well documented,’’ said 
Dr. Sara Imershein, a clinical professor at 
George 
Washington 
University 
and 
the 
Washington, D.C., chair of the American Col-
lege of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. 
Even if the patients had reported the 
symptoms recorded by Dr. Amin, ‘‘there

would have been many avenues to pursue be-
fore rushing to surgery,’’ she said. ‘‘Advil for 
one.’’ 
‘‘He is overly aggressive in his treatment 
and does not explore appropriate medical 
management before turning to procedures or 
surgical intervention,’’ said Dr. Deborah 
Ottenheimer, a forensic evaluator and in-
structor at the Weill Cornell Medical School 
Human Rights Clinic. 
But the doctors who reviewed the cases 
noted that aggressive overtreatment is all 
too common among doctors—especially with 
patients who do not have the resources to 
seek a second opinion. 
Dr. Ada Rivera, medical director of the ICE 
Health Service Corps, said in a statement 
that the whistle-blower’s allegations ‘‘raise 
some very serious concerns that deserve to 
be investigated quickly and thoroughly.’’ 
She added, ‘‘If there is any truth to these al-
legations, it is my commitment to make the 
corrections necessary to ensure we continue 
to prioritize the health, welfare and safety of 
ICE detainees.’’ 
Dr. Amin’s lawyer, Scott Grubman, said in 
a statement that the physician ‘‘strongly 
disputes any allegations that he treated any 
patient with anything other than the utmost 
care and respect.’’ 
‘‘Dr. Amin also strongly disputes that any 
patient was treated without full informed 
consent,’’ the statement continued. Mr. 
Grubman said that patient privacy laws pre-
vented him from discussing any specific pa-
tient’s treatment, but in each case it ‘‘was 
medically necessary, performed within the 
standard of care, and done only after obtain-
ing full informed consent.’’ 
The statement added that Dr. Amin always 
uses an interpreter when treating patients 
who do not speak English and ‘‘always at-
tempts to treat his patients with more con-
servative treatment, including medicine and 
less invasive procedures, before even recom-
mending surgery,’’ which he views as a last 
resort. 
Independent doctors that provide treat-
ment for ICE detainees are paid for the pro-
cedures they perform with Department of 
Homeland Security funds. Procedures like 
the ones that Dr. Amin performed are nor-
mally billed at thousands of dollars each. 
Dr. Amin’s billings had previously come to 
the attention of federal authorities. In 2013, 
the Justice Department named him in a civil 
case alleging that he and several other doc-
tors had overbilled Medicare and Medicaid 
by, among other things, performing unneces-
sary procedures on terminal patients and 
leaving the emergency room staffed by 
nurses while billing for diagnoses and treat-
ments as if they had been performed by doc-
tors. The case was settled for $520,000 with no 
admission of fault on the part of the defend-
ants. 
I COULD NOT ASK ANY QUESTIONS 
In many cases, Dr. Amin’s patients said 
they were confused about why they ended up 
being sent to his office in the first place— 
some after raising medical issues that had 
nothing to do with gynecology. 
Yuridia, a 36-year-old immigrant from 
Mexico, sought out a nurse at the center 
soon after she arrived because she was hav-
ing pain in her rib after a fight with her abu-
sive ex-partner just before she was picked up 
by ICE. She asked to be identified by her 
first name because she feared for her safety. 
She was sent for a medical exam at Dr. 
Amin’s office, where she said he began to 
prepare an ultrasound machine. ‘‘I was as-
suming they were going to check my rib,’’ 
she said. ‘‘The next thing I know, he’s doing 
a vaginal exam.’’ 
Dr. Amin recorded in his notes that 
Yuridia had cysts in her ovaries and sched-
uled a surgery to remove them. He also 
wrote that she had complained of heavy 
menstruation and pelvic pain. She said that 
she never experienced or reported those con-
ditions and that she had not asked to see a 
gynecologist. 
Weeks later, she underwent surgery. Pa-
thology reports show that she did not have 
dangerous cysts, but small ones of the kind 
that occur naturally in most women and do 
not call for surgical intervention. 
Yuridia said she had expected only a minor 
procedure 
that 
would 
be 
performed 
vaginally, but she was surprised when she 
woke up to find three incisions on her abdo-
men and a piece of skin missing from her 
genital area. 
‘‘I woke up and I was alone, and I was in 
pain and everyone spoke English so I could 
not ask any questions,’’ Yuridia said. Three 
days later, still sore and recovering, she was 
deported. 
Yuridia’s case bears striking similarities 
to others that the panel of doctors reviewed. 
Many of them led to two surgical procedures 
performed simultaneously: ‘‘dilation and 
curettage,’’ often referred to as a ‘‘D & C,’’ 
which involves inserting tools into a wom-
an’s vagina and scraping tissue from the 
uterus, and laparoscopy, in which three inci-
sions are made to insert a camera into the 
abdominal cavity to examine or perform pro-
cedures on the reproductive organs. 
The cases suggest a pattern of ‘‘excessively 
aggressive 
surgical 
intervention 
without 
adequate trial of medical remedies,’’ Dr. 
Ottenheimer said. 
A REPORT REVEALS LONGSTANDING COMPLAINTS 
It was the Irwin County center’s handling 
of the coronavirus pandemic that inspired 
Ms. Wooten, the nurse whose whistle-blower 
complaint was first reported by The Inter-
cept, to come forward about another issue 
that troubled her: Dr. Amin’s surgeries. She 
said in an interview that she had for years 
noticed that an inordinate number of women 
were being referred to Dr. Amin. She said she 
would hear reports that they had undergone 
surgeries but that they had no idea why the 
surgeries were performed. 
‘‘After they get up from general anes-
thesia,’’ Ms. Wooten said, the women would 
ask, ‘‘Why’d I have this surgery?’’ 
‘‘And I don’t have an answer for why,’’ she 
said. ‘‘I am just as shocked as they are. No-
body explained it to them.’’ 
Data from ICE inspection reports show 
that the center, which is operated by a pri-
vate prison company, Lasalle Corrections, 
refers more than 1,000 detainees a year for 
outside medical care, far more than most 
other immigration detention centers of the 
same size. It is not clear how many of these 
referrals are for gynecological care. Lasalle 
Corrections did not respond to requests for 
comment. 
Concerns from women detained at Irwin 
emerged long before Ms. Wooten came for-
ward. 
Ms. Dowe, after being told by Dr. Amin 
that she had a mass the size of a ‘‘canta-
loupe’’ on her uterus, had reached out in 
early 2019 to Donald Anthonyson, an immi-
grant advocate she had met through a fellow 
detainee. She was asking for help, Mr. 
Anthonyson said. 
‘‘She expressed real concerns about going 
to that doctor,’’ he said. ‘‘She was concerned 
about what was happening to her and what 
she was hearing from other women.’’ 
Unlike some of the women who had no gyn-
ecological complaints, Ms. Dowe was experi-
encing intense menstrual cramping, which 
the doctors who reviewed her case said could 
sometimes justify the procedure she under-
went—but only if the patient understands 
the options and elects to move forward. Even 
then, the doctors raised questions about sev-
eral seemingly healthy and naturally occur-
ring cysts that Dr. Amin might have re-
moved unnecessarily while he was operating 
on her. 
After the procedure, Dr. Amin wrote in his 
notes that Ms. Dowe requested a second sur-
gery—a full abdominal hysterectomy and re-
moval of her ovaries. 
But Ms. Dowe insists she never made any 
such request. A note in her medical records 
from the detention center appears to cor-
roborate her denial. ‘‘Detainee is requesting 
a second opinion to have a hysterectomy,’’ it 
reads, ‘‘OB/GYN scheduled hysterectomy and 
patient refused.’’ 
Complaints about Dr. Amin had also been 
raised with senior officials long before Ms. 
Dowe’s case. 
In November 2018, a woman named Nancy 
Gonzalez Hidalgo was left shaken after sev-
eral visits with the physician, during which 
she 
said 
he 
performed 
rough 
vaginal 
ultrasounds and ignored her when she cried 
out in pain. Ms. Gonzalez Hidalgo’s lawyers 
sent an email to the warden of the center, 
David Paulk. 
In the email, Erin Argueta, a lawyer at the 
Southern Poverty Law Center, explained 
that Ms. Gonzalez Hidalgo’s health was wors-
ening because of complications she was expe-
riencing from an earlier miscarriage. 
‘‘Nancy hesitated to seek medical atten-
tion because her last experience with Dr. 
Amin was so painful and traumatic that she 
did not want to be sent back to him,’’ Ms. 
Argueta wrote. 
She referred in her email to several pre-
vious verbal complaints about Dr. Amin that 
lawyers had taken to the center’s inmates 
services director, Marteka George. ‘‘Ms. 
George stated that this was not the first 
time someone complained about Dr. Amin, 
and she said that she would look into wheth-
er Nancy could see a different provider,’’ the 
lawyer wrote. 
The warden responded twice, stating on 
Nov. 30 that Ms. Gonzalez Hidalgo had been 
scheduled for an appointment with an out-
side provider ‘‘that is unassociated with Dr. 
Amin.’’ The other doctor, Warden Paulk 
said, was ‘‘reportedly well thought of by his 
patients.’’ 
Warden Paulk did not respond to requests 
for comment. 
Other women who questioned Dr. Amin’s 
care in the past said they had also faced 
challenges when they tried to seek answers. 
On the morning of Aug. 14, Mileidy 
Cardentey Fernandez said, there was no in-
terpreter present at the Irwin County Hos-
pital when she was presented with consent 
forms in English to sign for a procedure she 
was undergoing that day. 
She 
asked 
the 
technician, 
‘‘Spanish, 
please? Little English.’’ The woman urged 
her to sign the forms—and so she did. 
Afterward, she said, she filled out a form 
on numerous occasions at the detention cen-
ter requesting her medical records but got no 
response. 
‘‘I wanted to know everything they had 
done,’’ she said. ‘‘I made requests for the bi-
opsy, analyses, and they don’t want to give 
them to me. They said they don’t have the 
results. How can they not have the results?’’ 
When she was released from detention on 
Sept. 21, she called her daughter in Virginia 
and then headed straight to Dr. Amin’s clin-
ic with her lawyer to demand her records, 
which she received. 
Some women said they had managed to 
avoid surgeries by Dr. Amin but not without 
facing resistance. 
Enna Perez Santos said she objected when 
Dr. Amin suggested that she undergo a pro-
cedure similar to the ones that other women 
had complained about. Dr. Amin, she said,

counseled her that it was a mistake to forgo 
the treatment and he wrote in his notes that 
she had asked to speak to a mental health 
care provider. 
Back at the detention center on the same 
day, Ms. Perez Santos was given a psy-
chiatric evaluation. ‘‘I am nervous about my 
upcoming procedure,’’ Ms. Perez Santos told 
the examiner, according to the practitioner’s 
notes. ‘‘I am worried because I saw someone 
else after they had surgery, and what I saw 
scared me.’’ 
Ms. Perez Santos was brought three more 
times to Dr. Amin’s office over the next sev-
eral months, she recalled. Each time, she 
said, Dr. Amin raised the prospect of a sur-
gery. She felt ‘‘pressured’’ to agree, she said, 
but each time she told him she did not con-
sent. 
Three board certified gynecologists who re-
viewed Ms. Perez Santos’s medical files say 
that her instincts appear to have been cor-
rect. ‘‘Based on what I see here, Amin was 
inappropriately suggesting a D & C scope,’’ 
Dr. Ottenheimer said. ‘‘There is nothing at 
all there to support the procedure.’’ 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, the 
whistleblower complaint raises mul-
tiple serious questions which should 
concern every Member of this body and 
the administration. 
First, these women were apparently 
subjected to unnecessary and inappro-
priate medical care without their con-
sent, which, in many cases, has ren-
dered them unable to have children, 
one of the most precious decisions a 
family can make. 
Second, 
think 
about 
the 
cir-
cumstances. Many of these women did 
not speak English and had no access to 
interpreters to explain the procedures 
to which they were subjected. They 
were being held in detention, awaiting 
adjudication of their legal applications 
to stay in this country, not for any 
crime. But they had no access to fam-
ily members, their family doctors, or 
legal counsel. 
Many report that they went to the 
doctor for unrelated medical condi-
tions and only learned that they had 
been subjected to surgery after the 
fact. 
Finally, we must determine how such 
outrageous and inhumane treatment of 
human beings in the custody of a U.S. 
agency could be allowed to occur, and 
we must hold that agency, as well as 
the detention center, the facility, the 
private prison operator, and the med-
ical personnel, accountable. 
I cannot even begin to express how 
appalling these allegations are and the 
stain that, if found to be accurate in 
their entirety, they will leave on this 
country. 
I am sure there is not a single Mem-
ber of this body who doesn’t want to 
see a full independent investigation 
into these claims, and that is exactly 
why we are offering this resolution 
today. 
This resolution expresses the sense of 
Congress that this investigation must 
begin immediately. Any delay is sim-
ply unacceptable. 
Members of this body have already 
been forced to intervene in ICE’s at-
tempts to deport witnesses central to 
the investigation since the complaint 
was filed. This further affirms the ne-
cessity for the investigation and that 
the very nature of how Federal agen-
cies like ICE and DHS are operating 
under this administration, in violation 
of the rule of law and without account-
ability, that this is unacceptable. 
Our current administration is aware 
of the structural flaws in our immigra-
tion system and exploits them to great 
political effect. What we are left with 
is a leader and a party that vilify im-
migrants as a tool for political gain. 
Then they systematically round up and 
detain immigrants in some of the most 
horrific ways possible, using private 
detention centers, separating children 
from their parents, denying basic med-
ical treatment such as flu shots or 
COVID prevention, and inflicting life-
long trauma on our fellow humans, 
creatures of God. 
The allegations from the Irwin Coun-
ty detention facility are repugnant, 
but they are consistent with a pattern 
of inhumane and similar injustices 
that have been perpetrated by this ad-
ministration. ICE and DHS operate 
with impunity under a President who 
is using them as a secret police force. 
I hope all of my colleagues will join 
me in passing this necessary resolu-
tion, but more than that, I hope that 
we can come together to reform our 
broken immigration system. 
Our current system harms signifi-
cantly more than it helps, inflicting 
physical and emotional pain without 
protecting our borders. We are long 
overdue for serious changes that will 
better reflect our values and interests 
as a country. 
Next, Madam Speaker, we have H. 
Res. 1154, a resolution condemning the 
rightwing conspiracy theory QAnon. 
I am not entirely sure where to start 
with QAnon, but basic research tells us 
it is a rightwing conspiracy theory 
concocted in some of the darkest cor-
ners of the internet that purports to 
hail President Trump as a savior of the 
country by combating shadowy mem-
bers of a deep state who kidnap chil-
dren in order to drink their blood. 
This is a theory so ludicrous that it 
could be considered absurd if not for 
the thousands of Americans who have 
fully bought into these premises and 
the rash of violence, hatred, and crimi-
nal activity that these wild theories 
have encouraged. 
In August 2020, a woman in Colorado 
was arrested and charged with at-
tempted kidnapping of her daughter, 
who had been placed in foster care as 
her mother was deemed unfit to care 
for her. The woman is a fervent QAnon 
follower and was even found to have 
consulted other QAnon believers in a 
plot to kidnap her son, also in the fos-
ter care system. 
Then there is the case of an Arizona 
man who was a QAnon follower. He was 
charged with aggravated assault and 
making terroristic threats after he was 
inspired by QAnon theories to use an 
armored van to block a bridge over the 
Hoover Dam and demand release of a 
report he believed existed that would 
expose the deep state, whatever that is. 
The court ultimately blocked his 
guilty plea as the judge determined 
that the sentencing would have been 
too lenient for the crimes he had com-
mitted. 
One of the most high-profile QAnon 
incidents came after an alleged leader 
of the Gambino crime family in New 
York was murdered by a QAnon sup-
porter who, according to his testimony, 
believed that the murder would assist 
President Trump. 
While my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle continue to flirt with 
these fringe conspiracy theories, in-
cluding riling up their base with alle-
gations of invasions by antifa, which 
have been debunked by the administra-
tion’s own FBI, QAnon and those who 
have bought into it are genuine threats 
to our democracy. 
We are talking about a coordinated, 
sophisticated cult that is poisoning the 
brains of more and more Americans 
each day. 
In our Rules Committee meeting last 
night, many of my colleagues claim to 
have never even heard of this deadly 
cult. I cannot possibly believe that 
these skilled political operatives are so 
clueless, but that is beside the point. 
President Trump is certainly aware, 
and his tacit support and encourage-
ment of these dangerous narratives are 
a threat to the law and order he so 
noisily embraces. 
I hope that every single one of my 
Republican colleagues joins us in con-
demning QAnon today for the sanity of 
this country. It is particularly impor-
tant that we do so now because the Re-
publican Caucus may not be united on 
this front in the next Congress. 
Madam Speaker, with more than 15 
QAnon believers on the ballot this No-
vember across the country, it appears 
likely that at least one or two of them 
may be taking seats in Congress next 
term. 
In the meantime, every single Mem-
ber on both sides of the aisle must take 
their share of blame if these Hallowed 
Halls are going to be contaminated by 
Representatives of a deranged con-
spiracy theory. 
In any case, I look forward to seeing 
how Minority Leader MCCARTHY will 
find a spot for this kind of expertise 
next Congress. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
b 1145 
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume, 
and I thank Representative SCANLON 
for yielding me the customary 30 min-
utes. 
Madam Speaker, this rule consists of 
two nonbinding resolutions, H. Res. 
1153, 
regarding 
allegations 
made 
against the Irwin County Detention 
Center, and H. Res. 1154, condemning 
QAnon and rejecting the conspiracy 
theories it promotes. 
First, H. Res. 1153 is a complete dis-
regard to our Nation’s due process sys-
tem. If the accusations from the

H5127 
October 1, 2020 
women at Irwin County Detention Cen-
ter are true, they are obviously hor-
rific, and this resolution would be, ob-
viously, an appropriate response. 
However, we don’t know anything for 
certain yet. In fact, the Office of the 
Inspector General and the Department 
of Homeland Security are currently 
conducting investigations. 
We could open up a committee inves-
tigation, too. We could go through a 
normal committee oversight process 
where we have a hearing and bring in 
witnesses to get to the truth. That 
would be appropriate, not this. 
Guess what. ICE agrees with us. Act-
ing ICE Director Tony Pham issued a 
statement on September 18, 2020, say-
ing: ‘‘The recent allegations by the 
independent contracted employee raise 
some very serious concerns that de-
serve to be investigated quickly and 
thoroughly. ICE welcomes the efforts 
of both the Office of the Inspector Gen-
eral as well as the Department of 
Homeland Security’s parallel review. 
‘‘As a former prosecutor, individuals 
found to have violated our policies and 
procedures should be held accountable. 
If there is any truth to these allega-
tions, it is my commitment to make 
the corrections necessary to ensure we 
continue to prioritize the health, wel-
fare, and safety of ICE detainees.’’ 
In fact, I, along with my colleague 
from New Jersey, Representative CHRIS 
SMITH, sent a letter to DHS last week 
to state that the allegations are alarm-
ing and must be investigated thor-
oughly. 
It also said in our letter that these 
accounts don’t comport with the state-
ment of Dr. Ada Rivera, the medical di-
rector of the ICE Health Services 
Corps, who stated that, since 2018, only 
two individuals at Irwin County Deten-
tion Center were referred to certified, 
credentialed medical professionals at 
gynecological healthcare facilities for 
hysterectomies. Dr. Rivera also said 
that detainees are afforded informed 
consent, and a medical procedure like a 
hysterectomy would never be per-
formed against a detainee’s will. 
On September 18, the Associated 
Press published an article citing the re-
sults of its own internal investigation. 
It stated that the AP’s review did not 
find evidence of mass hysterectomies 
as alleged in a widely shared complaint 
filed by a nurse at the detention cen-
ter. 
The AP also noted that one attorney 
investigating the case had found that 
Dr. Amin has performed surgery or 
other gynecological treatment on at 
least eight women detained at Irwin 
County Detention Center since 2017, in-
cluding one hysterectomy. 
As a member of the Homeland Secu-
rity Committee and the co-chair of the 
Bipartisan Women’s Caucus, I am very 
concerned about these accusations in 
this situation. However, what happened 
in this body to due process? 
The way the House is moving forward 
today on this resolution sets a very 
dangerous precedent. For instance, in 
the resolution itself, it states: ‘‘Where-
as these allegations indicate a failure 
by U.S. Immigration and Customs En-
forcement to conduct rigorous over-
sight to protect the health and safety 
of people in its custody.’’ 
However, we do not even know if the 
allegations are true. It should, instead, 
read: ‘‘If true, these actions indicate a 
failure.’’ 
We can’t just base it on allegations. 
This is an example of my Democratic 
colleagues’ acting first and learning 
later. 
Right now, we need to investigate, 
not bring a resolution condemning ICE 
to the floor. This is backwards, and it 
is just wrong. America needs to see us 
together on this issue. Unfortunately, 
my Democratic colleagues clearly do 
not want to work with Republicans to 
make that a reality. 
Madam Speaker, this rule also con-
tains H. Res. 1154. 
At the outset, let me be clear, Repub-
licans are concerned with and do not 
embrace QAnon. 
I have to admit, although I must con-
fess I know little to nothing about this 
idea, organization, whatever it is, if 
what they say on Wikipedia is true, 
then, of course, we oppose it. In fact, 
on August 20, the House Republican 
leader, Mr. MCCARTHY, stated very 
clearly that there is no place for 
QAnon in the Republican Party. 
It is a serious issue, and Republicans 
don’t discriminate on which dangerous 
organizations or groups we take seri-
ously. We don’t just condemn groups 
because it is politically convenient. Be-
cause, unlike many of our colleagues 
across the aisle, we also take the 
threat of antifa seriously. 
It is clear, unfortunately, that many 
of my Democratic colleagues refuse to 
condemn antifa. Chairman NADLER said 
here right on the floor of the U.S. 
House of Representatives something to 
the effect that antifa was a myth, a 
fantasy. Just the other night, Vice 
President Biden refused to condemn 
antifa at the debate. 
That is why, last night, I offered an 
amendment to this resolution in the 
Rules 
Committee 
to 
include 
con-
demning antifa, so we, as a governing 
body, could unite against at least two 
threatening groups and ideologies, not 
just one. 
Unfortunately, all of my Rules Com-
mittee Democratic colleagues voted 
against my commonsense amendment, 
even though FBI Director Wray, him-
self, testified recently in Judiciary 
Committee: ‘‘Antifa is a real thing. It 
is not fiction.’’ In other words, antifa is 
not a myth as some on the other side 
believe. According to the FBI and the 
Department of Justice, antifa is in-
volved in the rioting and looting across 
our Nation. 
So while I do wish that the majority 
would have included a resolution con-
demning antifa in this rule for floor 
consideration today, I am glad Repub-
licans can put country first and agree 
when a group poses a threat. 
Madam Speaker, I urge opposition to 
the rule, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I am so pleased to 
hear that we should all be working to-
gether to get to the bottom of this, be-
cause that is exactly what the resolu-
tion puts forward. It says that these 
are allegations. It doesn’t say that 
they are conclusively proved. But the 
resolution asks for an investigation, 
and it asks our government to pull out 
all the stops to do that. 
The reason we need a resolution and 
a sense of Congress about this is be-
cause we see ICE and the Department 
of Homeland Security undermining 
this investigation already. When the 
news broke 2 weeks ago, they promptly 
moved to deport one of the central wit-
nesses. One of our colleagues, SHEILA 
JACKSON LEE, had to get that witness 
removed from a plane. She was on the 
tarmac ready to be sent overseas, 
where she then would not be available 
to testify. 
That same person was given humani-
tarian relief. She is allowed to stay in 
the country. Today, this morning, as 
we speak here, she reported to check in 
to ICE, as she was required to and as 
most immigrants do in our system, and 
when she reported, they tried to arrest 
her and deport her again. 
As we speak, Members of this body 
are having to work to keep ICE from 
undermining this investigation. So, 
yes, we need this resolution to move 
forward. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 31⁄2 minutes 
to the gentleman from Massachusetts 
(Mr. MCGOVERN), who is the distin-
guished chairman of the Committee on 
Rules. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
want to thank the distinguished mem-
ber of the Rules Committee, Ms. SCAN-
LON, for yielding me the time. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of this rule and the underlying 
resolutions. We must pass the resolu-
tion from Congresswoman JAYAPAL. 
Medical procedures being done on im-
migrants without their consent hark-
ens back to a dark time in our Nation’s 
history when medical abuse against the 
poor and people of color happened 
again and again and again. 
I rise today, though, to discuss the 
bipartisan resolution condemning the 
collective delusion known as QAnon. I 
don’t say that description lightly, 
Madam Speaker, but we all must call it 
what it is: a sick cult. 
We are not talking about a group of 
people with just some differing polit-
ical views. Americans respect political 
disagreement. But what we do not re-
spect and what this House should not 
tolerate are people using conspiracy 
theories from the darkest corners of 
the internet to spread hate and lies. 
QAnon isn’t some harmless distrac-
tion. It is an extremist ideology that 
exploits children and opens the door to

real-life violence. That is what we are 
talking about here: reality versus delu-
sion; political discussion versus polit-
ical violence. 
Just ask the sponsor of this resolu-
tion, Congressman MALINOWSKI. In an 
interview that was published yester-
day, he talked about the death threats 
and hundreds of hate-filled attacks 
sent to him from QAnon supporters 
after introducing this bill. 
He is not the only Member of Con-
gress who has been targeted. Sadly, 
there are candidates across the country 
running to serve in Congress who ped-
dle this trash. 
It is sick; it is wrong; and it is dan-
gerous. 
It is frustrating that the President 
wouldn’t condemn QAnon. He says they 
like him. But, then again, I never 
thought I would see the day when a 
President of the United States would 
tell a white supremacist group to stand 
down and stand by in a national de-
bate. He didn’t use a dog whistle; he 
used a blow horn. 
Extreme views like these are dan-
gerous. 
Are we really going to stand by and 
do nothing, Madam Speaker? 
That is not who we are as a nation. 
All of us, especially my Republican col-
leagues, must condemn QAnon or risk 
being complicit in their dangerous hate 
peddling. 
So let’s make it crystal clear: This is 
a sick and a twisted ideology. 
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, let’s be clear: I al-
ready said it, but we agree. We con-
demn QAnon, but we also ask the ma-
jority to condemn antifa. 
Why is the majority condemning one 
group and not the other group? That is 
the point. 
But let me go on to what my col-
league, Representative SCANLON, said 
on H. Res. 1153. This was said in the 
Rules Committee last night, too, that 
all this resolution does is call for an in-
vestigation. 
That is inaccurate. This resolution 
goes beyond that. In fact, it says it 
right here, and I said it last night. It 
says: ‘‘Whereas these allegations indi-
cate a failure by U.S. Immigration and 
Customs Enforcement.’’ 
So, if all it did was call for an inves-
tigation, fine, but that is not what it 
all does. It says: Whereas these allega-
tions indicate a failure by ICE. 
Madam Speaker, you saw in the com-
ments that Representative SCANLON 
gave that she was going after ICE. 
That is what this is about. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to 
the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. AUS-
TIN SCOTT). 
b 1200 
Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague 
for yielding, and I thank all of my col-
leagues for their comments. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to focus 
my comments on the attacks on the 
Irwin County Hospital and the staff at 
the Irwin County Hospital. And one of 
the things that I would like to make 
very clear is: While I was not invited to 
the event at the Irwin County Deten-
tion Center that my colleagues had— 
even though it is in my district—I was 
on the telephone with people who were 
there at the time, including our local 
hospital administrator. I have been to 
that facility, and one of the things I 
want everybody in this Congress to un-
derstand is, surgical procedures are not 
done at the Irwin County Detention fa-
cility. They are not. They are done at 
the Irwin County Hospital. 
So when you talk about procedures 
being done at the Irwin County Deten-
tion facility, it is just false. They are 
done at the Irwin County Hospital. The 
detention facility is not set up to do 
surgical procedures. 
So the question is: How do we get 
here? 
Well, there was a whistleblower com-
plaint filed by a group named Project 
South on September 14, 2020. I have a 
copy of the complaint. The complaint 
focuses on COVID and the challenges 
that the facility may or may not have 
had with COVID. And every facility in 
the United States, including this Con-
gress, had challenges with personal 
protective equipment and COVID, and 
how we were handling those issues. 
Now, in this complaint, which fo-
cuses predominantly on COVID, they 
make an allegation of hysterectomies. 
And I read to you from one of the AP 
articles: ‘‘But a lawyer who helped 
filed the complaint said she never 
spoke 
to 
any 
women 
who 
had 
hysterectomies. Priyanka Bhatt, staff 
attorney at the advocacy group Project 
South, told The Washington Post that 
she included the hysterectomy allega-
tions because she wanted to trigger an 
investigation to determine if they were 
true.’’ 
And the investigation has been trig-
gered. And we all want the investiga-
tion to go forward, and we want the 
facts to come out. And nobody wants 
the facts to come out more than those 
of us who live in that area. Nobody 
wants the facts to come out more than 
the doctor and the hospital and the 
staff at that hospital and the people 
who work at the detention facility. 
Madam Speaker, I share with you a 
couple of quotes from some other AP 
articles. This is from The Washington 
Post: ‘‘The advocacy group that filed 
the complaint, Project South, did not 
make the hysterectomy allegations the 
focus of its September 14 complaint to 
DHS, a complaint that alleged there is 
poor 
medical 
care 
and 
novel 
coronavirus risks at the ICE facility.’’ 
The attorney at Project South who 
was the lead investigator for the com-
plaint said in an interview with The 
Washington Post that she did not 
speak to or identify any women who 
had undergone a hysterectomy. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD the Washington Post article. 
[From the Washington Post, Sept. 22, 2020] 
HOSPITAL WHERE ACTIVISTS SAY ICE DETAIN-
EES WERE SUBJECTED TO HYSTERECTOMIES 
SAYS JUST TWO WERE PERFORMED THERE 
(By Nick Miroff) 
A hospital in rural Georgia where a physi-
cian has been accused of performing a large 
number of hysterectomies on immigrant de-
tainees said its records show that just two 
women in immigration custody have been re-
ferred to the hospital for the procedure since 
2017. 
Heath 
Clark, 
an 
attorney 
for 
ERH 
Healthcare, which operates the Irwin County 
Hospital, said both of the procedures were 
performed by Mahendra Amin, the physician 
whom activists have accused of carrying out 
forced sterilizations on immigrant women in 
U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement 
custody. 
According to a complaint filed last week 
by immigrant advocates and attorneys, a 
former nurse who worked at the Irwin Coun-
ty Detention Center, Dawn Wooten, claimed 
that a doctor known as ‘‘the uterus col-
lector’’ was subjecting female ICE detainees 
to unwanted hysterectomies. The doctor was 
later identified in news reports as Amin. 
Through attorneys, he has denied the accu-
sations, and calls to his office were not an-
swered Tuesday. 
Clark said hospital records show that 
Wooten’s claims are ‘‘demonstrably false.’’ 
‘‘These allegations are disturbing and sen-
sational, but they are not supported by re-
ality,’’ said Clark, speaking by phone from 
Nashville. ‘‘Dr. Amin is a longtime member 
of the Irwin County Hospital medical staff 
and has been in good standing for the en-
tirety of his service to the Irwin County 
community.’’ 
The allegations of forced sterilizations re-
ceived significant attention from lawmakers, 
news organizations and human rights groups 
last week. Attorneys who represent several 
women have come forward to say that their 
clients received gynecological treatments 
from Amin that they did not agree to or 
fully understand, including one former Irwin 
detainee, Pauline Binam. Binam said that 
one of her fallopian tubes was removed with-
out consent. 
Binam’s deportation to Cameroon was 
halted last week at the behest of Rep. Sheila 
Jackson Lee (D–Tex.). 
Amin has a private clinic near the deten-
tion facility, but the hospital is the only 
place where such a procedure would be per-
formed in small Irwin County, Clark said. 
Amin does not have an ownership stake in 
the hospital, contrary to some news reports, 
Clark said. 
Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D–N.J.), one 
of the lawmakers who participated in a vir-
tual hearing Monday to discuss the ICE re-
port, called Wooten’s allegations of steriliza-
tion procedures on ICE detainees ‘‘one of the 
most inhumane things I have ever heard.’’ 
Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D–Wash.) wrote a 
letter signed by 173 lawmakers demanding a 
DHS inspector general investigation. 
‘‘There may be at minimum 17 to 18 women 
who were subjected to unnecessary medical 
gynecological procedures from just this one 
doctor, often without appropriate consent or 
knowledge, and with the clear intention of 
sterilization,’’ Jayapal said. 
In a subsequent interview, Jayapal ac-
knowledged that she did not know the de-
tails of each of those cases, but the number 
she cited referred to the clients of attorneys 
with whom she had spoken. 
The advocacy group that filed the com-
plaint, Project South, did not make the 
hysterectomy allegations the focus of its 
Sept. 14 complaint to DHS, a complaint that 
alleged there is poor medical care and novel

coronavirus risks at the ICE facility. But it 
was the allegations of forced sterilizations 
that triggered a firestorm. 
‘‘The rate at which the hysterectomies 
have occurred have been a red flag for Ms. 
Wooten and other nurses at ICDC,’’ the 
Project South complaint said, without iden-
tifying other nurses. 
According to Project South, ‘‘Ms. Wooten 
explained: ‘We’ve questioned among our-
selves like goodness he’s taking everybody’s 
stuff out . . . . That’s his specialty, he’s the 
uterus collector. I know that’s ugly . . . is he 
collecting these things or something . . . . 
Everybody he sees, he’s taking all their 
uteruses out or he’s taken their tubes out.’ ’’ 
Priyanka Bhatt, the attorney at Project 
South who was the lead investigator for the 
complaint, said in an interview with The 
Washington Post that she did not speak to or 
identify any women who had undergone a 
hysterectomy. Bhatt said she included the 
allegations to spark an investigation into 
their validity. 
The legal director at Project South, 
Azadeh Shahshahani, said by email Tuesday: 
‘‘We have already heard from multiple attor-
neys representing numerous women who 
have 
suffered 
abuses 
reflected 
by 
Ms. 
Wooten’s whistleblowing disclosures. Some 
of these women are considering speaking up 
because Ms. Wooten courageously stepped 
forward. There has been a troubling pattern 
of misreporting on the health and welfare of 
detained immigrants held inside ICE facili-
ties, and we look forward to Congress, the 
Inspector General, and all other relevant of-
fices conducting a full investigation and ap-
plying immediate, necessary, corrective ac-
tions.’’ 
ICE said its own records show that two fe-
male detainees at Irwin have been referred 
for hysterectomies since 2018. Officials at 
ICE said the agency would have records of 
such procedures, which would require the ap-
proval of a supervising medical officer at the 
agency. ICE officials say they are cooper-
ating with investigators. 
Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. 
Madam Speaker, here is another arti-
cle from Reuters: ‘‘Mexican Foreign 
Minister Marcelo Ebrard said on Thurs-
day that the government has not yet 
found any proof of forced sterilization 
of Mexican women being held at mi-
grant detention facilities in the United 
States.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD this article. 
[From Reuters, Sept. 24, 2020] 
NO EVIDENCE OF STERILIZATION OF MIGRANT 
MEXICAN WOMEN, SAYS FOREIGN MINISTER 
(By Reuters Staff) 
MEXICO CITY (Reuters).—Mexican Foreign 
Minister Marcelo Ebrard said on Thursday 
that the government has not yet found any 
proof of forced sterilization of Mexican 
women being held in migrant detention fa-
cilities in the United States. 
The comments came after U.S. immigra-
tion officials earlier this month said a fed-
eral watchdog would investigate complaints 
made by a whistleblower nurse in a Georgia 
immigration detention facility who alleged 
detainees 
had 
improperly 
received 
hysterectomies and other gynecological pro-
cedures. 
Ebrard told reporters that 20 of 24 female 
Mexican nationals being held at detention 
centers in the U.S. states of Georgia and 
Texas had been interviewed and none of 
them had been subjected to such procedures. 
He added, however, that an investigation 
was ongoing as more women still needed to 
be interviewed. 
Ebrard at the time described such poten-
tial abuse as ‘‘unacceptable’’ and said that if 
the procedures were confirmed, measures 
would have to be taken, without giving de-
tails. 
Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. 
Madam Speaker, now somewhere be-
tween September 14 and September 25, 
H. Res. 1153 was drafted. And I think 
that that date is extremely important 
because the resolution was drafted be-
fore you even went to the ICE deten-
tion facility in Irwin County. It was 
drafted before you even got on the site 
to see what was actually happening. 
The hospital administrator was there 
at the facility on the 26th. And there 
are a couple of things I want to point 
out: 
One, the hospital administrator is a 
lady. She is a good lady and she is a 
good hospital administrator. And the 
doctor is an immigrant. 
Now, everyone who came to that fa-
cility had the opportunity to meet 
with the hospital administrator, and 
every single one of you refused the op-
portunity to get the facts from the hos-
pital administrator. 
Never mind the facts. And you won-
der why people hate us up here. 
Madam Speaker, I have a statement I 
would read from the Irwin County Hos-
pital, who wants a complete and thor-
ough investigation: ‘‘Irwin County Hos-
pital is aware of various allegations of 
misconduct against individuals being 
detained at the Irwin County Deten-
tion Center. 
‘‘Irwin County Hospital is committed 
to the safety and welfare of everyone in 
our care, including patients referred 
for care from the Irwin County Deten-
tion Center. From 2017 to the present, 
two individuals in detention at the 
Irwin County Detention Center were 
referred to Irwin County Hospital for 
hysterectomies.’’ 
You have made accusations of mass 
sterilization. You should be embar-
rassed by your conduct. 
You don’t want an investigation be-
cause you don’t want the facts. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I yield 
an additional 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Georgia. 
Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. 
Madam Speaker, ‘‘From 2017 to the 
present, two individuals in detention at 
the Irwin County Detention Center 
were referred to Irwin County Hospital 
for hysterectomies. Mahendra Amin, 
MD, performed these two procedures. 
Dr. Amin is a long-time member of the 
Irwin County Hospital medical staff 
and has been in good standing for the 
entirety of his service to the Irwin 
County community. 
‘‘Irwin County Hospital is and will 
continue to cooperate with any and all 
regulatory investigations related to 
healthcare services provided at Irwin 
County Hospital.’’ 
Dr. Amin has only performed two 
hysterectomies in 3.5 years on detain-
ees at Irwin County Hospital. This has 
been acknowledged by independent re-
views by ICH, ICDC, ICE, and even the 
Associated Press. 
Independent peer review has con-
firmed those cases were medically nec-
essary. 
Irwin County Hospital is the closest 
hospital facility to the Irwin County 
Detention Center. 
The CEO of Irwin County Hospital 
was available to the Hispanic Caucus 
during their visit to the detention cen-
ter. The warden made the Caucus 
aware of her presence at the facility 
and availability and no questions nor 
interaction was made by the Caucus. 
You absolutely refused to even speak 
to the lady that runs the local hospital 
because you don’t want the facts. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD this statement released by the 
hospital. 
Irwin County Hospital is aware of various 
allegations of misconduct against individ-
uals being detained at the Irwin County De-
tention Center. 
Irwin County Hospital is committed to the 
safety and welfare of everyone in our care, 
including patients referred for care from the 
Irwin County Detention Center. From 2017 to 
the present, two individuals in detention at 
the Irwin County Detention Center were re-
ferred 
to 
Irwin 
County 
Hospital 
for 
hysterectomies. Mahendra Amin, MD per-
formed these two procedures. Dr. Amin is a 
long-time member of the Irwin County Hos-
pital medical staff and has been in good 
standing for the entirety of his service to the 
Irwin County community. 
Irwin County Hospital is and will continue 
to cooperate with any and all regulatory in-
vestigations related to healthcare care serv-
ices provided at Irwin County Hospital. 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. CORREA). 
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Ms. SCANLON for yielding, and I 
rise in support of H. Res. 1153. 
First of all, let me say to my col-
league from Georgia, I was there on 
that trip and I was not aware that the 
hospital administrator was offering to 
meet with us. I was meeting with the 
people that would want to meet with 
me and would want to talk to me. As a 
matter of fact, I had a lot of discus-
sions with a lot of members of ICE 
while I was there. 
As a member of the Committee on 
Homeland Security, I have visited a 
number of ICE detention centers, espe-
cially in the State of California. But I 
must say nothing has prepared me or 
had prepared me for what I had found, 
what I saw and what I heard at the 
Irwin Detention Center. 
This was the first time that I have 
heard individuals in ICE custody des-
perate to be let out—anywhere—to get 
out. Women crying, asking not to be 
left alone. They cried that we—please 
not forget us—don’t forget them. 
And yet, their stories had one very 
common theme. When asking for med-
ical care, when asking for gyneco-
logical care, the care they received was 
without their consent and they had no 
idea what was going on, what they 
were doing to them.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5130 
October 1, 2020 
The medical doctor that was deliv-
ering the healthcare—and I believe my 
colleague from Georgia mentioned his 
name—is a doctor that has allegedly 
been fined half a million dollars. He 
and his medical practice paid half a 
million dollars in fines. 
So I would ask, why does the U.S. 
Government, why would ICE, contract 
with a healthcare provider that has 
been fined half a million dollars? 
And 
if 
these 
women 
complained 
about their medical problems, they 
were placed in what was called isola-
tion for observation. Many of them de-
scribed it as solitary confinement for 
days. Solitary confinement that caused 
psychological pain. These women were 
scared. They were traumatized, they 
were scared to ask for further medical 
treatment and they wanted to be sent 
home. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentleman from California. 
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, first, 
we had child separations. Now we have 
mistreatment of women. This has to 
stop. 
We need investigations. We need 
oversight. 
We 
need 
accountability. 
This is not going away. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my col-
league, Ms. JAYAPAL, for bringing this 
resolution forward, and I ask all the 
Members of this body to support this 
resolution. 
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Again, we are all for investigations. 
Two investigations are already going 
on; one by the office of Inspector Gen-
eral; one by DHS. I wrote a letter, 
along 
with 
Representative 
CHRIS 
SMITH, to the DHS Secretary Chad Wolf 
last week, saying: Please investigate 
this, get back to us. 
The problem that I have with this 
resolution is that it also condemns 
ICE, just based on allegations that 
haven’t even been investigated. The 
findings haven’t been done yet. So how 
can you condemn an agency based on 
allegations that haven’t even been 
proven yet? That is the point. 
That is what Mr. SCOTT was trying to 
say. There are opposing viewpoints. 
One side said this happened, another 
said it didn’t. 
So last night, in addition, in Rules 
Committee, I said: Why don’t we post-
pone this resolution until October 9? 
Give it a week. Let’s go through com-
mittee and find out what is exactly 
going on. Let’s have DHS come in. But, 
no, they opposed that, too. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to 
the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. COL-
LINS), my good friend. 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, it is not a surprise why we are 
here. To the gentlewoman from Ari-
zona, it is not a surprise. They have 
nothing else to put on the floor except 
political statements a month before an 
election and to further an agenda that 
they don’t like with ICE and the immi-
gration process, which we have heard 
now in the Committee on the Judiciary 
for well over 2 years. Again, there are 
no actionable items that actually can 
fix them but a lot of talk. 
So let’s continue with this just amaz-
ing reason we are here on the floor. Be-
cause the majority has embraced this 
absurd and baseless accusation that 
employees and doctors at the Irwin 
County Detention Facility in my State 
of Georgia are engaged in a con-
spiracy—this is amazing—with local 
doctors to systematically sterilize ille-
gal aliens. 
They have proven to the American 
people that no story is too outlandish 
to use in furtherance of their radical 
agenda. 
It would be a completely different 
situation if we were standing here 
today to take action on substantiated 
claims of mistreatment, but we are 
not. 
We are here today so that the major-
ity can attempt to squeeze one last bit 
of value out of the false claims propa-
gated by Project South’s complaint 
about the Irwin County Detention Cen-
ter in Ocilla, Georgia. The left knows 
these complaints are not true, but they 
are hoping we will ignore the mountain 
of 
evidence 
contradicting 
them— 
Madam Speaker, I have news for 
them—we are not. 
If claims of mass hysterectomies 
were true, or even if they were substan-
tiated by the smallest amount of evi-
dence, then there would be swift ac-
tion. But to the contrary—and to the 
dismay of my Democrat colleagues— 
the claims of mass hysterectomies 
were quickly proven false mere days 
after the complaint was released. In 
fact, as Mr. SCOTT said, just days later, 
both the hospital and the detention 
center 
confirmed 
only 
two 
such 
hysterectomies were performed since 
2017. 
Madam Speaker, that didn’t stop the 
whistleblower. That didn’t stop Project 
South. That didn’t stop us from bring-
ing this show to the floor of the House. 
In fact, in the complaint Ms. Wooten 
called the doctor at the center a uterus 
collector. Where does he go to get his 
reputation back from somebody who in 
a group who makes basic claims? 
I need to remind Project South; they 
don’t have speech and debate privileges 
like we do. They ought to be careful 
about who they are slandering and how 
they are doing it. 
Ms. Wooten said she has spoken out 
about several inmates who have had 
hysterectomies. 
Even 
more 
sensa-
tionalized, Ms. Wooten stated that: Ev-
erybody he sees has a hysterectomy— 
just about everybody. This is what she 
is saying about the doctor. 
Project South alleges that a detainee 
at the facility had talked to five dif-
ferent women detained between Octo-
ber 
and 
December 
2019 
who 
had 
hysterectomies done. But both the de-
tention facility and the local hospital 
have clear evidence directly contra-
dicting this hearsay: records showing 
that only two detainees have had 
hysterectomies since 2017. Let that 
sink in: Only two since 2017. 
How 
can 
they 
claim 
mass 
hysterectomies performed by the uter-
us collector are true? The simple an-
swer is they are not. 
In fact, Project South’s attorneys 
and lead investigator admitted to The 
Washington Post that she had not even 
spoken to or identified a detainee 
claiming 
to 
have 
undergone 
a 
hysterectomy. The group providing 
these claims has no evidence to back 
them up, but nonetheless, we are here 
embracing them and continuing to per-
petrate a falsehood. Sounds like a lit-
tle bit of another resolution that we 
are dealing with here today. 
As the facts have come out to dis-
prove these absurd claims, did the 
Democrats 
acknowledge 
they 
were 
wrong? No. There has been no acknowl-
edgment of their wrong. They conven-
iently shifted their argument to unin-
formed consent and expanded the alle-
gation to medical procedures generally 
and the lack of adequate translation 
services to strengthen their faulty ar-
guments. But even those failed. 
According to the employees at the fa-
cility, the center has 24-hour access to 
interpreters for virtually every lan-
guage, which they consistently utilize. 
In fact, they even have several remote 
interpreters who specialize in relaying 
medical terms and advice to non- 
English speakers. 
Clearly, the majority does not care 
about the credibility of their witnesses 
and their whistleblowers. They want 
the publicity. They want the political 
aspect of this because we are coming to 
the real reason. As long as they 
espouse these claims, it allows them to 
continue their attack on two places: 
The President and law enforcement. We 
have seen this during the sham im-
peachment, and we are seeing it here 
again today. 
The Democrats have already ex-
pended a lot of time and effort trying 
to make the claim in this complaint 
true by writing letters to DHS IG and 
traveling to Ocilla. In fact, just 2 days 
after the release of Project South’s 
complaint, 173 Democrats wrote DHS 
IG urging an investigation centering 
their call almost entirely on Ms. 
Wooten’s debunked claims of mass 
hysterectomies. 
Madam Speaker, now that is a mass 
progression to something—173 on a de-
bunked complaint that has already 
been done. They have conveniently 
failed to update the DHS IG and the 
American public that their claims of a 
eugenics conspiracy in south Georgia 
have been proven false. 
They have also conveniently failed to 
mention that, according to its website, 
Project South is committed to ending 
the use of local police to enforce what 
they characterize as the Federal Gov-
ernment’s draconian and racist immi-
gration policies. Further, the group

October 1, 2020 
boasts a goal of shutting down immi-
gration centers and is a frequent user 
of the hashtag, #abolishICE. 
To set the record straight, Rep-
resentative AUSTIN SCOTT and I wrote a 
letter to the DHS IG to shed light on 
the developments that followed Project 
South’s complaint and the group’s 
anti-law 
enforcement, 
anti-Trump 
agenda. 
b 1215 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I yield 
an additional 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Georgia. 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, in the quest of their further 
radical agenda, the left has cast a shad-
ow over an entire town in Georgia. 
This is more than just political fod-
der here for this floor when the major-
ity has nothing else to put on this floor 
and is wasting the American people’s 
time here. This goes back to dispar-
aging a respected doctor in the commu-
nity, an Indian-American immigrant, 
who provides free medical services to 
low-income patients simply for polit-
ical gain. The doctor has been viciously 
slandered by the left’s accusation that 
he carried out mass hysterectomies. 
Frankly, he should sue these organi-
zations. 
It is truly sad to see the lengths that 
the majority is willing to go to ad-
vance their own misguided policies, 
and they should apologize to the doctor 
and to the center. 
It is clear to me that Project South 
has ulterior motives, and it is dan-
gerous that the majority is permitting 
the group’s complaint to serve as the 
foundation of a resolution when so 
many of the claims have already failed 
under scrutiny, and the credibility of 
the entire complaint is shattered by 
Project South’s anti-ICE motives. 
Despite 
Democrats’ 
wishes, 
the 
American people deserve to know the 
truth, and they deserve to see the mo-
tives behind the claim. An investiga-
tion is always there; an investigation 
can start. But it is pretty amazing that 
the investigation—173 of my majority 
colleagues rushed to sign a letter with-
out even knowing the facts, and espe-
cially because it has salacious details 
that they could get at ICE and to get 
at a system that they don’t like, actu-
ally protecting the American public, 
enforcing our immigration laws. 
Project South is an anti-law enforce-
ment organization that has a stated 
mission of shutting down detention fa-
cilities. They included patently false 
claims in a complaint to the DHS IG. 
Detention facilities like the Irwin 
County Detention Center serve an im-
portant purpose in upholding our Na-
tion’s immigration laws, and efforts 
like this one to disparage them and 
shut them down by choosing to ignore 
facts in favor of fiction is disgraceful, 
not even meeting with the hospital ad-
ministrator. 
Again, what are we here for? This is 
shown to be exactly what it is. This 
train is on the tracks. We are putting 
this up here for political purposes be-
cause, frankly, Madam Speaker, the 
majority has nothing else to put up, so 
let’s get a last couple of days in to 
throw at our favorite targets: ICE and 
this administration. And who cares 
who we hurt, a hospital, a community, 
and a doctor who simply was doing his 
job. 
This is an investigation that needs to 
happen, and the smear needs to stop 
now. 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Wow, that was hard to follow. Just to 
take a couple pieces there. 
There is no allegation here of mass 
hysterectomies. What there are allega-
tions of, which have been strengthened 
over the intervening 2 weeks, are alle-
gations that numerous women were 
subjected 
to 
inappropriate 
medical 
care. And their medical records, as we 
begin to receive them, are starting to 
confirm that there were a variety of 
procedures that were committed upon 
these people without their consent, in-
cluding total and partial sterilization, 
but a range of procedures. 
You know, Madam Speaker and I 
both come from Pennsylvania. We have 
seen this kind of corruption before in 
our prison systems, where you have a 
private prison system that gets in-
volved in providing care—in Pennsyl-
vania, it was called the ‘‘kids for cash’’ 
scandal, where public officials were 
being given kickbacks for interning 
children. 
Now, is that what is going on here? 
The investigation may substantiate 
that or it may not, but there is a lot 
that needs to be dug into: the appro-
priateness of the medical care, whether 
someone was profiting off what hap-
pened there, the humanity of what hap-
pened to these women. All of that 
needs to be looked into. 
That is what the resolution is asking 
for, that this be investigated, because 
the allegations are so serious, and ev-
erything we have seen so far has sup-
ported them. 
Now, the IG is moving to investigate, 
and Congress has started to inves-
tigate. While there was a general invi-
tation to folks to attend the codel that 
went down there last week, nearly a 
dozen of our colleagues did go. They 
met with people down there. 
This is just a first step. There will be 
hearings. We will get to talk to the 
professionals from the community. 
No one is saying that the investiga-
tion is complete, and no one is saying 
that it is completely proven, but it is 
absolutely something this body must 
do: to act, to make sure that our gov-
ernment agencies are not participating 
in a scheme that deprives people of 
their basic human rights. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from New Hampshire 
(Ms. KUSTER). 
Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania for the time 
to speak as colead on this important 
resolution, to establish a thorough in-
vestigation. I know that we have col-
leagues across the aisle who want this 
investigation, and I ask them to join us 
today. 
Before having the privilege to serve 
in Congress, I was an adoption attorney 
for 25 years. I sat with 300 birth moth-
ers as they make the most profound, 
private, and consequential decision of 
their lifetime. 
In America, the government should 
not interfere in this most personal and 
intimate decision. Any type of steri-
lization, without consent, is a shocking 
and wrong interference. 
I ask my colleagues: How many 
hysterectomies would be sufficient for 
a 
resolution? 
Would 
a 
partial 
hysterectomy 
without 
consent, 
for 
those who hold themselves out to be 
pro-life? These are women who want to 
have children. We can find common 
ground. 
In America, the government should 
not interfere, and that is why I and so 
many Members of this Congress were 
shocked and horrified, first, to read 
about the whistleblower complaint; 
then the expose in The New York 
Times, with even more detail; and, fi-
nally, to speak with our colleagues, the 
codel that took the time to go to Irwin, 
Georgia, over the weekend and to sit 
and speak with the women who have 
had unspeakable surgery on them with-
out their consent or understanding. 
This chilling report outlines invasive 
gynecological procedures, ranging from 
full abdominal hysterectomy to the re-
moval of ovaries and fallopian tubes. 
We will acknowledge, not every sur-
gery was a full hysterectomy, but that 
should not keep us from helping these 
women who have come forward detail-
ing the pain and the trauma that these 
procedures have inflicted with life- 
changing consequences. 
These procedures, performed without 
consent, in some cases result in the 
woman’s inability to ever have a child, 
to ever bear a life. We have removed 
that life choice without her consent. 
And women who want to bear a child 
should have that right. 
In America, the decision of whether 
to have a child rests squarely with 
women and is protected by the United 
States Constitution and 50 years of 
precedent under the law; yet we find 
ourselves amidst a renewed national 
conversation about whether women can 
make healthcare decisions about their 
own bodies and whether they can have 
the choice to bear a child. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
New 
Hampshire 
(Ms. KUSTER). 
Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. 
Madam Speaker, these are the most 
difficult and private decisions that 
women will make, and the government 
should never have a role in that deci-
sion.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5132 
October 1, 2020 
So make no mistake about it: Wom-
en’s reproductive health and well-being 
is under attack in America, and wheth-
er that battleground may be a deten-
tion facility in Georgia or the highest 
court in the land, we must speak out, 
in unequivocal terms, to condemn ef-
forts that take away a woman’s ability 
to make her own healthcare decisions, 
including when and whether to bear a 
child. 
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
If we defeat the previous question, I 
will offer an amendment to the rule to 
immediately consider Small Business 
Committee Ranking Member STEVE 
CHABOT’s H.R. 8265, to reopen the Pay-
check Protection Program to Amer-
ica’s 30 million small businesses. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to insert the text of my 
amendment in the RECORD, along with 
extraneous 
material, 
immediately 
prior to the vote on the previous ques-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Arizona? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. LESKO. This amendment would 
ensure our Nation’s smallest and most 
vulnerable firms get the support they 
need by allowing an opportunity for a 
second PPP loan with specific funds set 
aside for small businesses with 10 or 
fewer employees, expand the list of eli-
gible covered expenses, simplify the 
loan forgiveness process, and extend 
PPP through the end of 2020. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from Texas (Mr. ROY). 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, to this 
body, I say enough, enough of the 
swamp games. 
The House needn’t wait for the pow-
ers that be to meet in a dark room and 
come out and tell us what so-called 
deal has been cut, whether it is the 
Speaker, the Treasury Secretary, or 
anybody else. And I shouldn’t have to 
learn what is in the bill from K Street 
on Twitter. 
Nor should the House take up a par-
tisan $2 trillion bill with no chance of 
becoming law, and you know exactly 
that is what it is. 
This is the people’s House. We should 
act like it. We should debate. We 
should vote. We should actually do our 
job and amend. 
To my House Democratic freshman 
colleagues: Your Speaker is playing po-
litical games with people’s lives. 
We are used to it. We are used to the 
Speaker playing games: 
With immigrant’s lives, shouting: 
kids in cages, for Obama policies rath-
er than supporting security; 
Refusing to call out antifa, or refus-
ing to come to this floor and have this 
body stand with our law enforcement 
officers—not once; 
Supporting Iran over Israel; 
Refusing to stand against the exter-
mination of babies born alive; 
Seeking to destroy American oil and 
gas and energy freedom and cheap en-
ergy in favor of radical Green New Deal 
policies; 
Working to take away your private 
doctors, taking away your private in-
surance; and 
Killing 6 months of this body’s time 
with 
partisan 
impeachment 
pro-
ceedings. 
But this is a whole other level. 
In June, the Heroes Act, $3 trillion in 
partisan hackery with no chance of 
passage. 
But in June, I, along with freshman 
Democrats, led by my friend DEAN 
PHILLIPS, worked together and passed 
the PPP Flexibility Act. We saved jobs. 
We now know that, according to the 
S&P, 13.6 million jobs have been saved 
nationally; in the district I represent, 
90,000 jobs, 18,500 businesses, $633 mil-
lion. 
But small businesses are still strug-
gling. Forty-seven percent of PPP bor-
rowers say they need additional sup-
port to survive. 
Right now, we have a bipartisan 
piece of legislation specifically de-
signed and ready to help small busi-
nesses, but we are not debating or vot-
ing on it. Instead, the Speaker chooses 
what? Political messaging resolutions 
that won’t do a darn thing. 
Worse yet, the Speaker is again pur-
posely choosing legislation that is de-
signed to fail: a tax cut that will go ex-
clusively to the wealthy; banking for 
marijuana businesses; PPP loans to 
Planned Parenthood; billions to bail 
out State and local governments; envi-
ronmental justice grants; weed diver-
sity studies; soil health studies; stim-
ulus checks for illegal immigrants; 
bailouts for Amtrak; and bailouts for 
the National Endowment for the Arts. 
And the kicker? Refusing to call out 
antifa. 
And the one thing cut from the first 
Heroes Act? Law enforcement funding: 
$300 million for COPS grants, $300 mil-
lion for State and local law enforce-
ment officers. 
Why won’t the Speaker—why won’t 
Democrats—stand with our law en-
forcement? Why won’t they stand for 
small businesses instead of playing 
games on the floor of this House, the 
people’s House? It is an absolute 
abomination. 
I urge my colleagues to reject the 
ways of the swamp. Let’s unite to-
gether and vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous 
question and work to help small busi-
nesses right now. 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, of 
course, I look forward to joining my 
colleagues in passing another round of 
coronavirus relief, as we did unani-
mously or near unanimously the first 
four times, because we know our com-
munities, our colleges, our schools, our 
State and local governments, our law 
enforcement officers, our healthcare 
systems all need that relief that has 
been held up by the Senate and the 
White House since May. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. 
COHEN). 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I came 
here for the purpose of commending 
Representatives 
MALINOWSKI
and 
RIGGLEMAN for bringing the resolution 
condemning QAnon and its baseless, 
racist theories. But having heard some 
of the remarks today, I have to tell 
you: Speaker PELOSI is standing up for 
American values and standing up for 
the least of us, while the Republicans 
are standing for the most of us. 
The Republicans passed a $150 billion 
tax break for the richest Americans, 
people like Donald Trump who don’t 
pay taxes. They get a 4-year backlog to 
file losses in real estate deals to cut 
out their taxes. 
They won’t do anything for children 
in a child tax credit, but they think 
that that policy of giving people, on 
average, a $1.6 million tax benefit to 
the richest 1 percent is good values. 
That is not good values. That is bad 
values. 
That is not good values; that is bad 
values. And the Republicans ought to 
object to that because it is making 
them the party of greed and tax 
weaselers and the bad people in Amer-
ica and not caring about the least of 
these.

Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I yield 
to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
CLOUD) for the purpose of a unanimous

Mr. CLOUD. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent to call up H.R. 8265 
to extend the Paycheck Protection

I do not yield for that purpose, and I 
have no intention of doing so during 
this debate.

Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
let me thank the gentlewoman from 
Pennsylvania and thank my colleagues 
for this vigorous discussion and the 
unanimous consent. 
I want to give them comfort. Tomor-
row, we will be able to vote on the He-
roes bill that we ask each and every 
one of them to support to provide mon-
eys not only for small businesses but 
nonprofits and faith institutions be-
cause we believe in the American peo-
ple, and we are going to keep them 
working. 
I look forward to them joining this 
bipartisan effort, supporting the He-
roes bill that we have offered under the 
leadership of Speaker PELOSI. 
b 1245 
I rise today to support both H. Res. 
1153 and H. Res. 1154. 
I traveled to Irwin County this past 
weekend, but my exposure to this trag-
edy was not just that day; just last 
week, with butterflies in my stomach, 
if you will, and concern for a young 
woman, 29 years old, about to enter 
onto a plane that she obviously was di-
rected to go to a place that she had 
never been, or had not been since she 
was 2 years old, a young woman from 
Cameroon who did have, who admits 
that her fallopian tube was removed 
without her consent. 
So people of color are not unused to 
having medical procedures without our 
consent. Women are not unused to and 
unfamiliar with having medical proce-
dures without their consent. 
Think about these women, speaking 
mostly a different language, detained 
for civil matters, and that is, not being 
statused. Young women, women intimi-
dated in the midst of COVID–19 in a fa-
cility where there is one physician who 
is supposed to be an OB/GYN, and you 
are carted off like cattle in a bus with 
one diagnosis: Oh, you need a fallopian 
tube removed. 
Let my friends on the other side of 
the aisle be reminded that they have 
been throwing the word ‘‘uterus’’ and 
other words around the floor of the 
House. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I 
yield the gentlewoman from Texas an 
additional 30 seconds. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
this is not a condemnation of ICE. 
Read the language. It just says that 
they should engage in more vigorous 
oversight, and they are doing that with 
an inspector general’s investigation. 
Look at this. This is from one of the 
women: 
Liberty, we are daughters and we are 
mothers, but you are stopping us from 
doing that. 
And H. Res. 1154 that I join in sup-
porting, as well, condemning QAnon, 
talks about a better America, that we 
are not the way it is described in this 
resolution. 
I ask my colleagues to support this 
rule and the underlying bills because 
we are daughters and we are mothers, 
and what is going on there is an atro-
cious condition that should not exist. 
I ask my colleagues to join me, and I 
thank my good friend from Pennsyl-
vania for yielding. 
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I yield 
to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. 
CHABOT) for the purpose of a unani-
mous consent request. 
Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent to call up H.R. 8265 
to extend the Paycheck Protection 
Program bill that I introduced to keep 
millions of employees on the payroll of 
America’s small businesses. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair would advise that all time has 
been yielded for the purpose of debate 
only. 
Does the gentlewoman from Pennsyl-
vania yield for the purpose of this 
unanimous consent request? 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I do 
not yield. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Pennsylvania does not 
yield; therefore, the unanimous con-
sent request cannot be entertained.

Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, in closing, we need 
to help the American people. The 
House should be considering a bipar-
tisan COVID–19 relief package right 
now, not binding resolutions that sim-
ply have the purpose of making polit-
ical points. 
Our constituents need us, so let’s get 
to work on a bipartisan package that 
could actually be signed into law be-
cause, let’s face it, anything else is 
worthless to the American people. 
Madam Speaker, I urge ‘‘no’’ on the 
previous question, ‘‘no’’ on the under-
lying measure, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
We are in trying times. We have an 
erratic administration that operates 
with the primary, if not exclusive, goal 
of winning reelection at any cost and a 
Republican Party willing to do any-
thing necessary to aid in that goal. 
We are in the midst of a global pan-
demic that has already upended vir-
tually every facet of our lives. Millions 
of people are unemployed or facing un-
employment, and over 207,000 of our 
friends and neighbors have died. 
Many of my constituents are facing 
eviction or are struggling to find food 
for their families. 
The fact that much of this suffering 
could be alleviated if not for the apa-
thy of Senate Republicans is tough to 
reckon with, but the American people 
know who is on their side. 
This Congress has passed more than 
600 bills, and a quarter of them have 
become law. Over 350 bipartisan bills 
lie untouched on MITCH MCCONNELL’s 
desk while he focuses all of his energy 
on 
confirming 
as 
many 
rightwing 
judges as he can. 
We stand ready to negotiate, and we 
will pass a COVID relief bill every day 
and twice on Sundays if that is what 
we have to do to get MITCH MCCON-
NELL’s attention. And we will do it 
while passing other legislation that is 
for the benefit of all the American peo-
ple—not just a select few, not just for 
those who dodge taxes—because that is 
what governing is, and that is what we 
will continue to do. 
We have a duty to provide an equal 
opportunity for all Americans to live, 
work, and thrive in this country, and 
that is a responsibility the administra-
tion and Senate majority leader have 
abdicated. 
So for all of the criticism lobbed 
from the other side of the aisle for tak-
ing up important resolutions like the 
ones we do today while a COVID pack-
age still hasn’t been signed into law, 
your words are misplaced and you 
know exactly who to blame. 
We were elected to govern, and that 
is exactly what we are going to do. You 
are more than welcome to join us, but 
we are not going to let you stand in our 
way while we move to protect human

rights and advance the best interests of 
the American people. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support the rule and under-
lying legislation. 
The text of the material previously 
referred to by Mrs. LESKO is as follows: 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 1164 
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 3. Immediately upon adoption of this 
resolution, the House shall proceed to the 
consideration in the House of the bill (H.R. 
8265) to amend the Small Business Act and 
the CARES Act to establish a program for 
second draw loans and make other modifica-
tions to the paycheck protection program, 
and for other purposes. All points of order 
against consideration of the bill are waived. 
The bill shall be considered as read. All 
points of order against provisions in the bill 
are waived. The previous question shall be 
considered as ordered on the bill and on any 
amendment thereto to final passage without 
intervening motion except: (1) one hour of 
debate equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of the 
Committee on Small Business; and (2) one 
motion to recommit. 
SEC. 4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not 
apply to the consideration of H.R. 8265. 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time, and 
I move the previous question on the 
resolution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on ordering the previous 
question. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3 of House Resolution 
965, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this question are 
postponed. 
f 
QUESTION OF PERSONAL 
PRIVILEGE 
Mr. KING of Iowa. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to raise a question of personal 
privilege. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair has been made aware of a valid 
basis for the gentleman’s point of per-
sonal privilege. 
The gentleman from Iowa is recog-
nized for 1 hour. 
Mr. KING of Iowa. Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate being recognized here on the 
floor of the United States House of 
Representatives, and throughout the 
years I have had the privilege to serve 
Iowans and Americans here. This is a 
great 
deliberative 
body, 
although 
sometimes we miss the facts. 
And I know that there is a phrase 
that I heard back in a political era, 
which is, whenever you lose a vote, you 
can sometimes use this analysis: 
Nor is the people’s judgment always 
true: the most can err as grossly as the 
few. 
And that has happened a number of 
times in my 18 years that I have served 
in this Congress. This is the 116th Con-
gress, and if someone were to ask me, 
well, what was your favorite session of 
Congress, I don’t have to worry about 
the 116th being on that list. 
b 1300 
But I rise to focus on a specific cir-
cumstance here, and that is a misquote 
of me that was driven into just a na-
tional feeding frenzy. It was validated 
by this Congress, this misquote. 
And when I stood on the floor of this 
Congress and made a statement to de-
scribe what likely happened in an 
interview with The New York Times 
that took place in early January of 
2019, I made the point on what that 
statement was, and the statement was 
regarding white nationalists, white su-
premacists. There always was a pause 
between those two odious ideologies 
and the term ‘‘western civilization.’’ 
I advised Congress that there would 
be a distinct pause to demonstrate a 
new thought started rather than jam-
ming those three ideologies together. 
Who would compare white nation-
alism and white supremacy, those odi-
ous ideologies, who would compare 
them to western civilization, the very 
foundation of American civilization, 
the foundation of the First World, and 
here, America, the flagship of western 
civilization today? There is no com-
parison and should never be equated 
between the two. 
Yet, I didn’t tie that thought to-
gether, but the stenographers did. 
And I am not here to be a critic, be-
cause they have done terrific work for 
me over the years, and their skill set, 
and their professionalism are second to 
none. They are the best in the world, as 
far as I am concerned, but if they can 
make a mistake, so can The New York 
Times, which is my point. 
So in this narrative, Madam Speaker, 
I will take you back a little way. And 
I want the Congress to know what all 
has transpired here that brought us to 
the point of the feeding frenzy and the 
political lynch mob that was here that 
day on about January 12 or so, or Janu-
ary 13, and it was this: that during my 
election in the year 2018, November of 
2018, there was a national media focus 
on attacking me. That happens in 
other races, but I don’t know that it 
ever happened as intensively as it did 
in my race. 
In any case, we came through that 
with a 3.4 percent victory, and I 
thought that was the end of it. I ex-
pected that I would come back. You 
know, even your political opposition 
needs a rest from time to time, and so 
after the election is when they take a 
deep breath, retool, and get ready for 
the legislative session. 
But I sat down with a political opera-
tive, who was one of the top political 
campaign managers at the presidential 
level in the Nation, and a successful 
one at that. He came in to give me a 
little bit of his advice, and as I am lis-
tening to that, he said: They are going 
to try again. They are going to try 
again to drive you out of office with a 
national media assault on you, and 
they are going to attack you with ev-
erything. They will throw everything 
at you. He didn’t say but the kitchen 
sink, but I got the message. 
And when he first brought that up, 
Madam Speaker, I passed it off, be-
cause I didn’t take it seriously. Noth-
ing like that had ever happened before 
in the history of this country that I 
knew. 
And he brought it up a second time, 
and I passed it off again, because I 
didn’t take it seriously. But the third 
time, he got my attention. 
And the third time he brought it up, 
he said: They are going to make an-
other run at you. 
This was the day before Thanks-
giving of 2018, by the way. He said: 
They are going to make another run at 
you, and they believe that they were— 
this meaning Democrats, yes, but also 
Republicans, establishment, the swamp 
creatures, the elitists, those folks, and 
also the media. They are going to make 
another run, because they believe that 
the midterm elections of 2018 were a bit 
distracting, they had other races to be 
concerned about, and so, therefore, 
they couldn’t bring all their guns to 
bear on this Member of Congress from 
the Fourth District of Iowa. 
So he did have my attention by then. 
And as much as it didn’t seem plau-
sible, his advice to me was this: They 
have a messenger that they will send 
to the President, a messenger whom 
the President trusts and who has his 
ear, who is going to be directed to con-
vince the President to send out a nega-
tive tweet on Congressman KING, and 
that negative tweet will be the trigger 
that launches another media assault, 
all the broadsides that they can get on 
this Member of Congress. And he used 
these words: And they believe they can 
force you to resign. 
Now, that is a hard concept to get 
into your head when nothing like that 
had ever happened before and there was 
no substance for that to be based upon, 
but he did convince me. 
So I set about preempting this, at his 
advice, and I did, to the extent I could, 
preempted it at the White House. And 
I think history proves that that has 
been successful. President Trump has 
not taken a shot at me, even though 
there were many others who couldn’t 
resist the press’s temptation to take a 
cheap shot, but the President did not. 
So I take it that the effort to preempt 
it at the White House was at least par-
tially successful. 
Yet, I couldn’t get a meeting with 
the messenger until January 8, 2019. So 
on January 8, I had that meeting with 
the person that was at least named as 
the potential messenger, and in that 
conversation, I was assured: I would 
never do that to you, STEVE. Be as-
sured that that won’t happen. 
Well, I was fairly confident that 
those words were honest, and actually 
felt pretty happy about it when I 
walked out of that meeting. But I also 
suspected that the people that were

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5137 
October 1, 2020 
around that individual might find out 
about the meeting that I had just fin-
ished and might know that I under-
stood the gambit that was going to be 
run against me. That was January 8. 
January 9, amazingly, I have a pri-
mary opponent that announced on 
Twitter at 11:23 a.m.—He might have 
announced earlier than that, except he 
was busy deleting all of his tweets for 
the previous 10 years, and then once 
the tweets were deleted—He announced 
on Twitter that he was going to chal-
lenge me in a primary. He didn’t have 
a website, didn’t have a roll-out plan, 
didn’t have a media plan, didn’t have 
an interview set up. He just sent out a 
tweet. 
So that seems to me that he hadn’t 
been planning that very long. I think 
he got a phone call the night before 
that morning that said: You are going 
to have to announce now. That was 
January 9. 
January 10, The New York Times 
story came out. And The New York 
Times story that has been the subject 
of this turmoil here on the floor of the 
House that had the whole Nation fix-
ated on a few words, it actually turned 
out to be about 13 words. 
It is still pretty stunning to think 
how you can mobilize the United 
States Congress over whether or not 
there is a hyphen or a period where it 
ought to be. 
But here is what we have, Madam 
Speaker. We have to protect the Con-
stitution of the United States, and the 
First Amendment of the Constitution 
is freedom of speech, religion, press, 
and peaceable assembly. 
And freedom of speech, whatever our 
speech is—I know that I was sitting in 
a meeting with some folks in Europe 
about 2 or 3 years ago, and they are 
prosecuting people for what they call 
hate speech and for asking a rhetorical 
question. I have a couple of friends 
over there that I happen to know that 
have been persecuted, prosecuted, and 
convicted for hate speech that was ac-
tually just a rhetorical question. 
I was making the case to them, I 
said: You need American-style con-
stitutional protection for freedom of 
speech. You don’t have freedom of 
speech here in Europe, and you are 
going to be a lot more robust society, 
you can address your problems and 
have open discussion, but you shut 
down any dialogue by hate speech pros-
ecutions. 
And they said: We have more freedom 
of speech than you have in America. 
Now, that will bring a person up 
short, Madam Speaker. And so I asked: 
Why? 
And his answer was: In America you 
can start a corporation, you can be a 
CEO, you can write a check to an 
unfavored not-for-profit group—or a 
profit group, excuse me—and once the 
public finds out about that, then they 
put that out all over the internet and 
they just—they named the people that 
had lost their companies because of a 
tweet or because of a donation to an 
unpreferred entity. 
And as they made their case, I real-
ized they kind of stumped me a little 
bit. We have freedom of speech in the 
Constitution. But they said they don’t 
lock people up for hate speech, they 
just prosecute them, convict them, 
turn them loose, and they generally 
learn their lesson. But here, we have 
watched since that time, since that 
time back in—this conversation took 
place in August 2018, freedom of speech 
has been diminished in this country in-
crementally. And it is a tragedy that 
we are going down that path. 
But here in this Congress, here is 
what happened: from the meeting that 
took place on January 8, the announce-
ment of one primary opponent on Jan-
uary 9, The New York Times story on 
January 10, and after that, there was 
nothing I could have said or done that 
was going to change the inertia that 
was created. 
They actually carried out what they 
had given me the heads-up they were 
going to do. They actually brought all 
media broadsides against me. And it 
didn’t matter what was fact and what 
was fiction. It mattered that they had 
mobilized all those forces because they 
thought that they could force me to re-
sign. 
And for what purpose? I can give you 
a lot of reasons, Madam Speaker, but I 
think what is better to do at this point 
is to examine The New York Times. 
The New York Times interview took 
place on January 5 of 2019 on a phone 
call that I received from the reporter 
Trip Gabriel right about 8:30 in the 
morning. 
I had advised him that he should go 
through my communications director, 
but I also had told him that I thought 
I would be open at about 8:30 until 10:30 
that day. 
So he called me directly. And I had 
just gotten out of the shower to get 
ready to come down here and go to 
work. I didn’t get a chance to check 
the email from my communications di-
rector first. That came in at 7:48 a.m., 
and it said: Don’t do the interview. It 
is a trap. I have been trying to shut 
this reporter down. I know he is com-
ing at you with a trap. Don’t do the 
interview. 
I didn’t see that until much, much 
later. Had I seen that, there wouldn’t 
have been an interview. 
But it was 56 minutes long. And there 
is no tape. And as far as I can deter-
mine, there aren’t even any notes that 
are available to the public. 
And we have asked him: What was 
the question that you asked? What was 
the leading question? What was the 
context of the answer that I gave? 
And KEVIN MCCARTHY is critical of 
me, because he says that he can re-
member every word that he has used in 
the last 6 months in an interview, and 
that includes also the punctuation, be-
cause that is the topic we were talking 
about. 
I don’t think that is even humanly 
possible. I don’t think anybody can do 
that. 
And Trip Gabriel says: Don’t worry 
about whether I am accurate or not, 
because I can type as fast as anybody 
can talk. 
Well, I have asked our wonderful ste-
nographers down here how fast they 
can type, and what I learned was at 
about 130 words on a conventional key-
board is just about the limit to be cer-
tified, but maybe 150 or 160 on the 
magic keyboard that is going right 
down there right now. 
And I say: Can you keep up with me 
when I am talking at a fast pace? 
And they say: No. I have to listen to 
the tape. 
But I respect the professionalism we 
have here. Anybody can make a mis-
take. 
And then I asked about the precision 
of punctuation when you are doing a 
transcript on the keyboards even that 
we have here, let alone the conven-
tional one that Trip Gabriel was using. 
And they say: Well, we will get the 
words right if you talk at a pace that 
we can keep up, but we can’t guarantee 
the punctuation. 
So there is a great big difference in 
whether— there is a great big dif-
ference in whether the meaning of a 
phrase has got a hyphen in it or wheth-
er it has a comma in it. 
Trip Gabriel put in a comma, and he 
insists he is right. And I would ask, 
how could he know? How could he 
know whether he is right or not, be-
cause his memory is not any better 
than KEVIN MCCARTHY, not as good as 
KEVIN MCCARTHY says it is. 
So I want to go through this. So what 
happened shortly after that, this thing 
all hit, and on Monday early in the 
month of January, I had a meeting 
with our leader here, and it lasted 
about an hour. And it wasn’t a happy 
meeting for either one of us, but he was 
determined, he was determined that I 
am wrong, The New York Times is 
right. 
And I don’t know how our leader can 
defend President Trump against The 
New York Times and attack me for the 
opposite. 
If you just Google, lying New York 
Times, you get hundreds of hits on a 
Google of lying New York Times. Their 
credibility has been essentially de-
stroyed. 
And this little piece, I would say 
this: 18 years in this Congress, 45 years 
in the construction business, 6 years in 
the Iowa Senate, our family goes back 
three generations on the dirt that we 
are on right now where we live, and 
throughout all that time, The New 
York Times and others have sent re-
porters into my neighborhood to try to 
find somebody that has got something 
derogatory to say about me or some in-
sult to my character, and they have 
failed every time; The New York 
Times, The Washington Post, Huff-
ington Post, you can name all of them. 
It used to be The Weekly Standard, and 
they rightfully are defunct now be-
cause of their overreach and their po-
litical bias that they rolled out. But in

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5138 
October 1, 2020 
all that time, they have never found a 
single person. 
And no one has gone on record in this 
Congress in 18 years, serving on the Ju-
diciary Committee for 16 of those 
years, the most polarized committee on 
the Hill and the most racially diverse 
committee on the Hill, and not one of 
those folks, and many of them trade in 
the race issue, has ever made a state-
ment that I had been disrespectful or 
disparaging in any way whatsoever. 
b 1315 
And so there is no substance. I have 
no accusers, no individual accusers 
that have stood up. But this whole 
mass of people in this place were accus-
ers on that day in early January of 
2019. 
So I am here to assert that—I am 
asking this Congress and this CONGRES-
SIONAL RECORD to correct the RECORD 
and to place a hyphen in the terms 
from that day where I said I was going 
to pause—I did pause; I have watched 
the videotape of it since then several 
times—that the language be: white na-
tionalist, white supremacist, hyphen. 
That is a pause, and it is a new 
thought, and the new thought then be-
came: Western civilization, now how 
did that language become offensive? 
Why did I sit in classes teaching me 
about the merits of our history and our 
civilization just to watch Western civ-
ilization become a derogatory term in 
political discourse today? 
The very statement itself refutes The 
New York Times’ characterization. It 
refutes the characterization that was 
delivered at me by KEVIN MCCARTHY 
and others. It refutes the characteriza-
tion that was the presumption of this 
Congress. But the presumption of this 
Congress didn’t look at the evidence. 
They didn’t look at the facts. They just 
got swept up in the herd mentality and 
went ahead and did what they did. 
And by the way, the resolution that 
was brought, I believe, by Mr. CLYBURN 
that day, the resolution was actually 
honest because it said: whereas Con-
gressman KING has been quoted as say-
ing. 
And that was the qualifier, and then 
they put the quote in out of The New 
York Times. Well, I was quoted as say-
ing that. That was an honest state-
ment. It was a misquote. They didn’t 
bother saying that. But I was mis-
quoted in The New York Times, but the 
way it was printed in the resolution 
was 
accurate. 
And 
all 
the 
other 
whereases that rejected the odious 
ideologies were all accurate. 
My own rejection of it in the pre-
vious week was stronger than the reso-
lution itself. I wish they had used my 
language. Mine was stronger, and mine 
was better, but I agreed with all the 
words that were in that. And I asked 
this body, vote ‘‘yes’’ on this resolu-
tion. 
I had, I will say, dozens of friends 
here that were prepared to come to this 
floor and vote against that resolution 
in order to guard my back, just on the 
principle that they knew I am not the 
person that that resolution implied 
that I am. 
But, instead, rather than divide our 
conference, rather than divide this 
Congress, rather than ask them to vote 
against a resolution that happened to 
be technically true, I asked them all, 
instead, vote for this resolution be-
cause it is technically true, and that is 
not the argument. 
Now, only one person voted against 
it; that was the gentleman from Illi-
nois, Chicago. BOBBY
RUSH, former 
Black Panther, voted against the reso-
lution because he thought I should 
have been sanctioned or censured even 
more. 
Well, aren’t we supposed to look at 
evidence in this place? Do facts mat-
ter? Does reason matter? Or are we just 
caught up in the political inertia of 
what goes on, and we try to fit our-
selves into the stream so that we don’t 
stand out very much? 
So I have given you some of that, but 
none of the context of my quote was in-
cluded in The New York Times story. 
We called up Trip Gabriel and said: 
What question did you ask me? 
He—first, I asked him: Do you have a 
tape? He would not even answer the 
question of whether he had a tape. 
Then we asked him: What question 
did you ask Congressman KING that 
brought forth this answer that is only 
about just a handful of words, 13 words 
altogether, and what is the context of 
that? What was the question? What was 
the answer? Did you feed those words 
to him, and did he repeat them back to 
you? 
And he wouldn’t answer that ques-
tion either. It took two phone calls to 
squeeze some out. 
But what we learned was he didn’t 
expect that that would be the quote 
that would do it. That is almost an 
exact quote out of him. He didn’t think 
that that would be the quote. He 
thought it would be something else in 
the article. 
So that indicates to me he knew it 
was a hit job when he did the inter-
view, and that is also what Mark Steyn 
says. He says that is not a good faith 
interview request, and this is said just 
the day after this incident. 
And Mark Steyn went on to say—he 
said: He made a mistake, STEVE KING. 
He agreed to give an interview on na-
tional immigration policy to The New 
York Times. That is not a good faith 
interview request. They are only ask-
ing you, and he should know this, they 
are only asking you to stitch you up, 
to talk to you for 3 hours and get you 
to use one phrase in there that they 
can lift out and kill you with. 
Well, I think Mark Steyn had that 
figured out, and I think he is really ac-
curate. He went on to say: This guy, 
STEVE KING, was trapped. Trapped. The 
words he said about when did that be-
come 
controversial, 
he 
meant 
the 
phrase, Western civilization. 
How come Mark Steyn knows this 
the day after and this Congress can’t 
understand this 2 years after? 
And he went on to say: He is not a 
white supremacist. He is not a white 
nationalist. It is all stupid talk. 
So you have just surrendered the 
phrase, Western civilization. I don’t get 
that, said Mark Steyn. I don’t see what 
is in it for conservatism in surren-
dering that phrase and accepting the 
left’s view that the term, Western civ-
ilization, is beyond the pale. 
He also said that conservatives, Re-
publicans, have trouble finding a hill 
that they believe is worth dying on. 
But when you sacrifice this issue and 
that issue and another issue, and you 
get to Western civilization and you 
sacrifice the hill of the very foundation 
of the First World, our country, and 
the founding of our country, the found-
ing documents, the ideology that I 
would trace you all the way back to 
Moses and bring through the Greeks 
and the Romans in Western Europe and 
the rule of law and free enterprise cap-
italism and the industrial revolution 
and God-given liberty and natural law 
and 
the 
deep 
reading 
and 
under-
standing that was done by our Found-
ers who shaped this country, who found 
America to be and shaped America to 
be a giant petri dish for God-given lib-
erty. 
Think of what it was like. Here is 
this land, this huge Western Hemi-
sphere that hadn’t seen any aspect of 
what we consider to be modern life. 
And on this land, here came, at the 
dawn of the industrial revolution, the 
idea—it will be Adam Smith, he wrote 
‘‘Wealth of Nations’’, published 1776, 
the same year the Declaration was pub-
lished. And this petri dish, this giant 
petri dish of freedom and liberty and 
rule of law and unlimited natural re-
sources—so we thought at the time— 
and the concept of manifest destiny 
and the wars that were fought to se-
cure those things, all of that, all of 
that that is so rich in America’s his-
tory and makes us the greatest Nation 
the world has seen, but we can’t defend 
Western civilization? 
And I will say, 2 years ago, when this 
came down, people didn’t understand 
what is happening. But today, Western 
civilization is under assault, and I have 
been 100 percent correct on this. I have 
been more correct on this than I 
thought I was going to be, Mr. Speaker. 
But I would just want to add that no-
body in America ever sat in the class 
to learn about the merits of white na-
tionalism or white supremacism, and 
the content of that quote makes it 
clear. All the contemporaneous evi-
dence supports what I have been say-
ing. 
In fact, all of the things that I have 
said since then, no one has found a hole 
in any of them. No one has said this is 
marginally untrue or untrue. No one 
has ever looked at the language that I 
have used and said that it isn’t accu-
rate. 
In fact, what I have done is I intro-
duced a fact-check document, and that 
fact-check document was first pub-
lished March 6, 2019. KEVIN MCCARTHY

October 1, 2020 
gave me 24 hours to prove a negative— 
24 hours. Well, he didn’t actually. I 
asked for 24 hours. He gave me 1 hour. 
Now, philosophers have—and every-
where from philosophers to barflies 
have argued for centuries that it is im-
possible to prove a negative. Well, no, 
it is logically possible to prove a nega-
tive, and I did that. And I did it in a 
fact-check document filed in this Con-
gress and published on my website Feb-
ruary 3—excuse me—March 6 of 2019. 
And then some other facts came to 
bear, and I published a follow-up of 
that. 
I deleted nothing from this. I just 
added some more facts. And that was 
published February 3 of this year, 2020. 
So some of the things that I want 
people to think about is, I had done— 
we had done the LexisNexis search and 
asked it: Had STEVE KING ever said 
white nationalist anywhere in history? 
We went back to the year 2000. That is 
about as far as we can trust the 
records, I think. And at no time, I had 
never, ever been quoted as ever even 
uttering the words that identify that 
odious ideology. 
And so when I was asked: What is a 
white nationalist by DAVE PRICE on a 
television station in Des Moines, Iowa, 
it caught me off guard because I hadn’t 
been ever asked to define it before. I 
had never said the term before. In fact, 
I didn’t use that term when I answered 
the question. 
But I did say it is a derogatory term. 
It might have meant something dif-
ferent 1, 2, or 3 years ago, but today it 
means racist. That was my definition 
off the cuff from a question that I 
didn’t anticipate. Maybe it could have 
been a little more artful, but it is true, 
and it is true because the term has 
been weaponized and essentially un-
used. 
And so, we looked through the record 
of LexisNexis and said: Where is the 
first documented instance of where I 
ever used the phrase white nationalist? 
And that turns out to be in an inter-
view that was done right before Christ-
mas of 2018 with the Christian Science 
Monitor. And there, I was making the 
case that some of this language has 
been weaponized. And did I use the 
terms—I said, I used the terms—if I can 
find it here, I added a couple of other 
terms that were part of that, such as, 
well, racist is weaponized; Nazi is 
weaponized; 
fascist 
is 
weaponized; 
white nationalism is weaponized; and 
white supremacy is weaponized. Now 
they are trying to weaponize Western 
civilization. When that happens, our 
civilization will be on its way out the 
door. 
But I was clearly making a state-
ment, defending Western civilization 
and rejecting the odious ideologies. 
So we looked it up, and I asked the 
question—just a minute. This, Mr. 
Speaker, is a chart of LexisNexis that 
charts the frequency of the utilization 
of the term, white nationalist or white 
nationalism, a derivative of that. So it 
goes back to the year 2000, and you can 
see all the way up till 2015, it is vir-
tually unused. It wasn’t in our Amer-
ican vernacular. No one could be ex-
pected to have the precise and perfect 
definition for that in their head from 
a—I will say—a quick response type of 
a question if we are not using it in our 
language. 
It wasn’t in our political discourse. It 
may be in academia. That is probably 
where—one to 200 times a year is about 
what that is down on the bottom. 
And then you see that 2015, it picked 
up just a little bit. But 2016, it went 
from virtually unused to 10,000 times a 
year. And then, in 2017, it went to 30,000 
times a year. 2018, it is still up there at 
20,000 times a year. 
This term, white nationalism, was 
weaponized, and it was used against 
conservatives. They knew they had 
worn out the term racism, so they had 
to come up with some new terms, and 
that was one of them. 
Here is another example. This is the 
year. This is the year 2016. It was, I 
could say, almost virtually unused up 
until November of 2016. And what hap-
pened in November of 2016? Oh, Donald 
Trump was elected President wasn’t 
he, on about November 8. 
And the following Sunday, about the 
12th or 13th of November, the top peo-
ple in the Democratic Party met at the 
Mandarin Hotel here in Washington, 
D.C. The articles that I read about it 
are articles that were written around 
their star person there, George Soros, 
who was in that hotel and presumably 
led some of the discussions that were 
there and contributed, likely, to the 
cause. 
And so from the moment that they 
went into that hotel, that Sunday, it 
doesn’t really show very much utiliza-
tion of it. But on the following day, 
Monday, it shoots off the charts. There 
is no question that this synchronizes 
almost exactly with the meeting in the 
Mandarin Hotel, which, I believe, stra-
tegically decided: We are going to 
launch white nationalism and white su-
premacy as weaponized terms, and we 
are going to use them against Repub-
licans. 
So this is actually, Mr. Speaker, the 
picture of November itself and broken 
down day by day. And so you can see, 
the 11th, the 12th, here is the 13th. 
That was Monday. They called into the 
hotel. Thirteen is Sunday, excuse me. 
And so they were checking in. 
But on Monday, here we go. Tuesday, 
that 
is 
how 
they 
triggered 
the 
weaponization of language, and that is 
what I was describing in that inter-
view, although I thought I was right 
because my guts were speaking to me. 
My instincts were speaking to me. I 
didn’t have the data, but it is pretty 
clear that I was more right than I 
imagined that I would be. 
That is the circumstances that we 
are dealing with here, and the hyper-
activity of a planned ambush of a Mem-
ber of Congress in an effort to try to 
drive him out of office and force him to 
resign, based upon false stories and 
false allegations without substance. 
b 1330 
So I will take you to this, Mr. Speak-
er. We went to Congressional Research 
Services, CRS, and asked them: Who 
has been removed from all of their 
committees presumably for discipli-
nary reasons? And what do you know 
about as far as you can go back in the 
search engine or into modern history? 
We found out that James Traficant 
was removed from all of his commit-
tees. He was subsequently convicted of 
a Federal felony and went to prison— 
several Federal felonies, as a matter of 
fact. 
Then we have had, I can think of two, 
three cases since that time, fairly con-
temporary. I don’t want to say their 
names because I remain a person who— 
well, I regret what they were convicted 
of, but, nonetheless, it is this. 
There have been five Members of 
Congress who were removed from their 
committees for disciplinary reasons in 
all of modern history according to 
CRS. One of them is fairly recent down 
in Kansas. The other two, in addition 
to James Traficant, were subsequently 
convicted of Federal felonies. So the 
charges on the Kansas issue are Fed-
eral felonies. 
So here I stand, the sole person in 233 
years of the American Republic who 
has been denied a full-throated rep-
resentation of his 750,000 constituents 
by an arbitrary decision of the leader 
of the Republican Party, who had no 
evidence except his faith that the dis-
honest reporter of The New York 
Times was more honest than a very 
honest Member of Congress standing 
before him. 
No one in this Congress has ever as-
serted that I misinformed them will-
fully. Maybe I made a couple of mis-
takes on data, and if I caught them, I 
went back and fixed it as quickly as I 
could. But that assertion has never 
been made. There has never been made 
of any personal disparagement, as I 
said earlier. All of that holds together. 
No one in this body has ever heard 
me utter even a swearword under my 
breath. Yet this is what happens to the 
freedom of speech and representation. 
I would add this. I had more votes for 
me in the previous election in Novem-
ber of 2018 than either the current lead-
er of the Republican Party or the Con-
ference chair, yet they have got a sanc-
timonious attitude about what is right 
and what is wrong. 
So I would assert, Mr. Speaker, that 
the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD did err. It 
is easy to determine that because there 
is a C–SPAN tape. We have a tape of 
one thing, and that was there is a dis-
tinct difference between the two odious 
ideologies and Western civilization. I 
made the point. I did the pause. It is 
natural for me to talk and think that 
way. It is not natural for me to advo-
cate for something that I disagree 
with. 
Further, this fact-checked document 
makes it real clear that of all of the 
time that it has been out here, a year 
and a half or better, not a soul has

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5140 
October 1, 2020 
found anything false in it, anything 
mischaracterized, anything biased, or 
any hole in the logic that says that 
could not have happened with The New 
York Times. It is a false and erroneous 
misquote is the nicest way that I can 
put that. 
Mr. Speaker, I have gone through a 
number of these things that are the 
factual components of it, but here is 
another piece: How often was white na-
tionalist used in this Congress? I said 
it was virtually unused for all those 
years on up until 2018. We went back 
through the CONGRESSIONAL
RECORD 
and did a search, too. I will just read 
you the text of this fact-checked docu-
ment, Mr. Speaker, to give you some of 
the flavor of it. 
It says: Another indicator of the re-
cent 
weaponization 
of 
the 
phrase 
‘‘white nationalism’’ can be found in a 
study of the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. 
According to the CRS, no Member of 
Congress has ever said, in their origi-
nal words, the term ‘‘white nation-
alist’’ on the House floor prior to Presi-
dent Donald Trump being elected. 
That is out of a CRS report. 
So how could it be that, oh, that is 
attributed to me, and there is a 
thought process that is attributed to 
me? 
But it says that KEVIN MCCARTHY’s 
decision to remove KING from all three 
of his committees for a misquote of 
The New York Times is unprecedented 
with no analogous case to mine. Apart 
from party switches/level of party sup-
port, KING is only the fourth Member of 
Congress’ history—that is this report 
prior to the Kansas incident I men-
tioned—according to the CRS to be 
stripped of all committee assignments, 
and he is the only one who was re-
moved from committees for a reason 
that has no basis—no basis in history, 
in House or Conference rules or Federal 
law. Or, I will say, no basis in truth ei-
ther. 
So one has to come to a conclusion 
here as to what actually happened. 
Mr. Speaker, you can believe the 
version of events that are relied upon 
by KEVIN MCCARTHY to strip KING of 
committee assignments, but if that is 
so, one must believe that an unreason-
able but sensational interpretation for 
which no evidence exists is more likely 
to be accurate than a reasonable, non-
controversial interpretation which is 
internally supported by context clues 
and externally supported by data and 
other contemporaneous published ac-
counts. 
One must also believe that The New 
York Times, which is a hostile, liberal 
paper, which has had other articles 
about me, STEVE KING, written by the 
same author thoroughly debunked as 
completely bogus, set aside its animus 
in this particular case and wrote an ob-
jective article for the first time on me. 
This document that I am speaking 
from contains hyperlinks to source ma-
terial. Parties interested in reviewing 
this 
can 
go 
to 
my 
website 
steveking.house.gov and pull one of 
these documents down. 
Mr. Speaker, another piece of this 
was Brit Hume, a legendary journalist 
and reporter. Brit Hume is publicly no 
fan of STEVE KING. He read through an 
article that was written by Trip Ga-
briel just about on January 15 of 2019, 
and Trip Gabriel brought up a whole 
series of quotes that proves that I am a 
racist. Brit Hume read down through 
that and said that it is completely 
bogus. Most of the articles and most of 
the quotes don’t have anything to do 
with race whatsoever, and none of the 
comments were racist. That is Brit 
Hume. 
Between Brit Hume, Mark Steyn, and 
multiple others who are objective, I 
think we get the idea of what happened 
here. 
Going home to spend time with my 
grandchildren is not what I regret, Mr. 
Speaker, but what I regret is the prece-
dent that is established here that there 
is no place to appeal. 
I recall when I was first elected to 
the Iowa Senate, I had what turned out 
to be a future constituent who found 
himself in an administrative law judge 
position where the administrative law 
judges had ruled against him. It was a 
domestic issue. I knew that he was 
honest; I knew that he was the target; 
and I knew he was the victim of stack 
of lies. So I set about trying to get him 
an appeal so that his case could be 
heard. 
As I checked the fences, so to speak, 
as we say in Iowa, or perhaps Texas as 
well, as we checked the fences, it al-
ways will go under the next one, the 
next one, the next one. But once you 
went around, it was a corral, and there 
was no way for him. He is back appeal-
ing to the very person who ruled 
against him in the first place. 
So, Mr. Speaker, what you are really 
down to is you can go through some 
motions, but you have to ask the de-
cider to change their mind. That is the 
only appeal. When you have got the 
pressure of a nation, the media pres-
sure and the political politics that go 
on here, then they are not going to 
change their mind. There is too much 
narcissism involved for that. 
By the way, there is a significant 
amount of mendacity, while we are 
talking about personal characteristics, 
because KEVIN MCCARTHY promised me 
that he would go to the Steering Com-
mittee and ask them to restore me to 
all of my committees. That happened 
April 19 of this year. I have the tran-
script of that phone call. Yet, when 
McCarthy was asked about that in a 
press conference, he denied it and made 
me out to be the liar. That is another 
piece that has got to be changed in the 
history of all of this. 
What I regret is, if there is a due 
process, then there needs to be a place 
where there can be an appeal. There 
needs to be a place to roll the facts out 
and there needs to be a way that you 
can put people who sit in judgment, 
who actually have to evaluate the facts 
and be subjected to criticism for their 
decision that they would make. None 
of that exists in this Congress. It may 
exist over on the other side of the aisle, 
but it doesn’t exist on this side of the 
aisle. 
So I have my obligations here, and 
one of the obligations is to deliver the 
truth. I am confident everything I have 
said here today is objectively true. I 
have dug through this for a good, long 
period of time. 
After the primary election, I sat 
down on my deck out on the east side 
before the Sun came up in the morning 
and took my keyboard and began to 
type. After a few weeks, I had 60,000- 
some words, and that is a book. That 
will be in print real soon. The title of 
that is ‘‘Walking Through the Fire.’’ 
I was able to call Andrew Breitbart, a 
close, personal friend. When he trag-
ically passed away at age 43 several 
years ago, I was given the honor to 
give the eulogy for him at the national 
memorial here in Washington, D.C., for 
Andrew Breitbart, whose imprint is on 
our society to this day. 
Andrew would say to us: Walk to-
wards the fire. Walk towards the fire. 
Their bullets aren’t real. They just 
want to scare you. They want to shut 
you up. They don’t like your ideology, 
so they will attack you personally, and 
they will call you a whole series of 
names. 
He was more eloquent about that 
than I. 
I started out the book that way, 
‘‘Walk towards the fire,’’ but the title 
of my book is ‘‘Walking Through the 
Fire’’ because, once that fire was lit in 
front of me, I could have either turned 
and run or walked through it. I said: If 
you are going to do this to me, you are 
going to have to shoot me down in the 
middle of Main Street at high noon 
with everybody watching. 
That is pretty much what happened. 
They mounted that kind of effort and 
did everything they could to destroy 
my reputation. 
But the facts stand the same. I have 
no accusers. All of the logic of this 
fact-checked document supports what I 
have told you here today, Mr. Speaker, 
all of it. There is not a hole in it. No 
one has found a hole in it, even when it 
would behoove them to find a hole in it 
or several holes in it. 
I think that my reputation here 
among the people who know me is 
solid. But, also, I will have a shorter 
list of friends maintenance after this 
last experience over these 2 years. 
I don’t regret going home. I don’t re-
gret spending more time with my 
grandchildren. 
I got a phone call from one of our 
county chairs here a month and a half 
or so ago. He said: I am calling to tell 
you that God is showing you how much 
He loves you because He is guaran-
teeing you more time. He is sending 
you home to spend more time with 
your grandchildren. 
That is as good a way to put that as 
you can. 
I have made good friends here in this 
place, but the list of them is shorter

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE

October 1, 2020 
than I thought it was. So I think it is 
very important that people coming 
into this Congress, the freshmen whom 
I have never gotten a chance to know 
over a 2-year period of time because, if 
they are seen talking to STEVE KING, 
the leader might not give them the 
committee assignment that they want, 
I didn’t get to know them. That is too 
bad. I am sure there are good people 
there. But that list is shorter than I 
thought it would be. 
We need more and deeper character 
in this Congress, and we need to tie 
back to facts and policy. What I have 
seen happen here in the time that I 
have been in this Congress is, when 
young Members come in, they come in 
pretty strong ideologically, for the 
most part. They want to make a dif-
ference, and they want to pass legisla-
tion. They are policy people, and they 
are ideological people. 
And I meet them and I like them and 
I like the spark that is in their eyes, 
but pretty quickly, sometimes there 
are even one or two or three, even on 
the first day, who decide: Mine is going 
to be a political equation. Over time, 
they give up on the policy. They give 
up on the ideology. They find out that 
their job is to either work for this 
team or work for this team over here. 
They slowly become a political barom-
eter. And when an issue comes up in 
front of them and they have to make a 
decision, the question will be: How does 
this help me? If it doesn’t help them, 
then that question is: How do I avoid 
dealing with this issue? 
I came here to correct the wrongs 
that I had seen in life and to fix the in-
justices. I didn’t anticipate I would see 
them so starkly in front of me, but I 
have. So I wanted to come to the floor 
here today, Mr. Speaker, and let you 
know some of these things that I am 
thinking about. Hopefully, this body 
will learn from the experiences that we 
have all been part of here. The fresh-
men need to be thinking about this and 
have an independent voice. 
Mr. Speaker, I have said that one of 
the ways that you can have an inde-
pendent voice here in this Congress— 
and perhaps the only way you can have 
an independent voice—is you have to 
have constituents who will support 
you; you have to have a fundraising 
network that is independent from the 
people who can take it away from you; 
and you have to have a national media 
voice so that the truth restrains the 
people who want to undercut you. 
There is a major component that I 
left out of my presentation here, Mr. 
Speaker, and that is I am a Member of 
Congress from Iowa. I am the dean of 
the Iowa congressional delegation. 
I have been engaged in the first-in- 
the-Nation Iowa caucus for a long 
time, and I am the only Member that I 
know of at this elected level who has 
ever made an endorsement of a Presi-
dential candidate and taken all the 
heat from the other candidates that 
comes from that, but I think it is im-
portant to do that. 
I have had, along with just a handful 
of other people, an extraordinary op-
portunity to get to know these Presi-
dential candidates one on one, 17 of 
them the last time. I brought 12 of 
them into a Freedom Summit down in 
Des Moines to launch the national 
Presidential race. I put 1,250 people in 
the seats and standing room only. They 
were rock-ribbed, principled, full-spec-
trum, constitutional Christian conserv-
atives. 
b 1345 
And when they heard something they 
liked, they stood, stomped their feet, 
and applauded and cheered. 
When they heard something they 
didn’t like, they might look at their 
watch, boo, hiss, or walk away. 
They were sorting these candidates 
and batching up with what they be-
lieved in. The conservatives did well 
that day, but the moderates didn’t do 
so well. And a couple of moderates 
didn’t show up. So when I see that, 
when the moderates don’t show up and 
the conservatives do show up, and— 
let’s see, Walker got a big bounce out 
of that that day, Donald Trump got a 
big bounce, TED CRUZ got a big bounce, 
Ben Carson got a big bounce that day. 
They all spoke at the Freedom Sum-
mit. And that helped launch them into 
a very competitive Presidential cam-
paign. 
I did everything I could to provide 
access to the candidates so that they 
could be in Iowa and meeting these 
caucus-goers and shaking hands and 
doing the things necessary to have a 
chance at the nomination. That func-
tions really well. But what we did, we 
built the platform around that. And 
the platform for the Presidential can-
didates was actually built in Iowa. And 
then we put three or four of those can-
didates on that platform, once they 
come out of the Iowa Caucus, and we 
send them off to New Hampshire. New 
Hampshire does pretty good, but some-
times they will pull a nail or two out. 
And then they will take that platform 
and send those candidates down to 
South Carolina and, thankfully, they 
put a lot of those nails back in. 
So by the time you are done with 
South Carolina, the platform for the 
nominees is settled. And that is the 
platform that makes it to the national 
convention. That is the platform that 
arrives in the Oval Office. That is the 
platform that exists there today. 
When I walk into the Oval Office, and 
I look around, I think, My gosh, we 
really did accomplish this. We accom-
plished the agenda on immigration, for 
example, and we accomplished the 
agenda to repeal ObamaCare. We didn’t 
get it all done, but it is on there. 
I have in my pocket a picture of all 
the promises that Donald Trump made, 
there are a lot of checkmarks behind 
the ones that have been accomplished. 
Those promises, many of them were 
made in Iowa at the launch of this. 
And that is one of the things that has 
brought out the opposition, the estab-
lishment people in this country don’t 
want conservatives to have a loud 
voice on who the nominees are going to 
be. But I say, the heart of the heart-
land is where the families are. It is 
where the small businesses are. Where 
we are the farthest away from the big 
businesses, we are insulated from that. 
So our ideology—Democrat and Repub-
lican—is closer to the real people than 
you might find if you go someplace 
where there is an expensive media mar-
ket. 
In launching Democrat and Repub-
lican candidates, we must have that 
hands-on where they have to meet peo-
ple and get to know the American peo-
ple. We want real candidates out there 
on that stage. And the folks that had 
the money—for example, Jeb Bush 
spent $139 million, and he got some-
thing like three or five delegates. He is 
not very happy with how that oppor-
tunity didn’t exist for him in a way 
that it might have for a TED CRUZ or a 
Ben Carson or a Donald Trump or a 
Scott Walker. So they decided that 
they don’t want to have that voice in 
northwest Iowa. And that is a big piece 
of this as well. 
Mr. Speaker, the forces behind this, 
the forces of the swamp that have mo-
bilized themselves like never before 
and pulled off something that had 
never been accomplished before and 
done with—I will say a strategy and 
millions of dollars, and a network of 
media that was coordinated across this 
country is all part of this. It is all part 
of my book. I can’t begin to express it 
all here in the time that I have, but I 
do appreciate the time that I have been 
allowed here on the floor of the House 
of Representatives. 
Mr. Speaker, I want you to know 
that I appreciate serving with you, a 
man of a happy attitude that expresses 
it across the aisles in a bipartisan way. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge this Congress to 
take a look at the C–SPAN tape, cor-
rect the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, put 
the hyphen in where it belongs, and 
recognize that I have been right on this 
all along. No one has found a hole in 
anything that I have said. You can 
look through every word put out the 
last 2 years. Everything I have said 
stands up. It doesn’t stand up with the 
New York Times. It doesn’t stand up 
with KEVIN MCCARTHY. It stands up 
when I say it. 
I make that point as I step aside here 
because it is a challenge. Show me 
where I am wrong. Show me where I 
have 
been—I 
should 
say—where 
I 
haven’t been factual. No one has been 
able to do that. They won’t be able to 
do that. The fact-checked document 
stands on its own. It is completely log-
ical, and it proves a negative, even 
though philosophers have long said 
that is not possible to do. 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate being rec-
ognized here to address you on the 
floor of the House of Representatives, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time.

The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 8124 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-

ment motions in that case, including but not 
limited to petitions for writs of habeas cor-
pus, writs of coram nobis, motions to vacate 
a sentence under section 2255 of title 28, and

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. GARCIA) and the gentleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER) each will control 20 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Texas. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days to revise 
and extend their remarks and include 
extraneous material on the bill under 
consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Texas? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 8124, the Criminal 
Judicial Administration Act of 2020 is a 
bipartisan piece of legislation that 
makes two very modest but important 
amendments to current law, promoting 
the efficient, effective, and fair admin-
istration of justice. 
The first part of this bill concerns 
out-of-custody 
criminal 
defendants, 
particularly those who are released 
pending trial to live in communities 
that are located far from the court-
house where their cases are being 
heard. 
The majority of Federal criminal de-
fendants are detained pending trial, 
and the United States Marshals Service 
is responsible for housing and trans-
porting them to court hearings, includ-
ing trial. In addition, under current 
law, the court may order the U.S. mar-
shals to provide funds for a criminal 
defendant who is released pending trial 
but cannot afford the cost of travel to 
cover the defendant’s travel to the lo-
cation of the courthouse for hearings 
or trial. 
However, the defendant must fund 
their own way back home, and a de-
fendant in this position would not be 
able to receive financial support from 
the U.S. marshals for subsistence, such 
as lodging and meals. For an indigent 
defendant, these costs are sometimes 
insurmountable. 
For instance, a defendant from Ha-
waii who must attend their 2-week 
trial in the Southern District of New 
York, would have to figure out how to 
pay for 2 weeks of lodging in New York 
City, or a defendant released to live at 
home on the Navajo Reservation, who 
has a pretrial hearing at the Federal 
courthouse in Phoenix, Arizona, may 
not be able to afford gas for the 6-hour 
ride back home. 
For years, our Federal courts have 
struggled with how to assist indigent 
defendants when they find themselves 
in these difficult situations. But unfor-
tunately, the courts’ efforts have come 
up against the text of the statute. This 
bill would authorize courts in the in-
terest of justice to order the U.S. mar-
shals to cover roundtrip travel and sub-
sistence for defendants who must at-
tend court hearings but cannot afford 
to pay this on their own. The Judicial 
Conference of the United States has 
urged us to correct this grave unfair-
ness. I am pleased to see that we are fi-
nally doing that with this bill. 
The second part of this bill con-
cerning Federal magistrate judges is 
also supported by the Judicial Con-
ference. Magistrate judges have trial 
jurisdiction 
over 
certain 
mis-
demeanors, except for class A mis-
demeanors, for which the maximum 
sentence is up to 1 year in custody. 
With a defendant’s consent, however, a 
magistrate judge may exercise trial ju-
risdiction over a case involving a class 
A misdemeanor. 
Magistrate judges frequently do so 
and often hear class A misdemeanor 
cases all the way through judgment 
and sentencing. Under current law, a 
magistrate’s jurisdiction ends after 
judgment is entered in a misdemeanor 
case and post-judgment jurisdiction re-
verts to the district court. 
Indeed, magistrate judges are not au-
thorized to hear post-judgment mo-
tions, such as motions to vacate a sen-
tence, even though they are the ones 
that handled the entire matter at the 
trial level and are best equipped to 
hear such post-judgment motions. 
Among other things, this bill would 
authorize a magistrate judge to hear 
post-judgment 
motions 
in 
mis-
demeanor cases in which she or he ex-
ercised trial jurisdiction. This amend-
ment clearly improves judicial econ-
omy. It makes perfect sense. This is a 
straightforward and bipartisan meas-
ure that will help our criminal justice 
system in a more effective and fair 
manner. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
8124, the Criminal Judicial Administra-
tion Act of 2020. 
This bill strengthens existing laws 
about transportation and subsistence 
for indigent criminal defendants. It 
does this when they are brought to 
court proceedings. 
H.R. 8124 allows a magistrate judge 
to decide post-judgment motions in a 
misdemeanor case where the mag-
istrate judge was the judge who han-
dled the underlying misdemeanor case.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5143 
October 1, 2020 
This bill will also improve the effi-
ciency of our court systems by allow-
ing our courts to manage caseloads in 
a more efficient and economic manner. 
I thank the bipartisan effort of my 
colleagues, the sponsors of this legisla-
tion, Representatives JEFFRIES
and 
ROBY. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in supporting this bill, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. JEFFRIES). 
Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the distinguished gentlewoman from 
Texas for her leadership and for yield-
ing. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
8124, the Criminal Judicial Administra-
tion Act of 2020. 
This bipartisan bill will bring more 
efficiency and fairness to the criminal 
justice system by making two com-
monsense improvements to the admin-
istration of justice in America. 
First, the bill would authorize courts 
to direct the U.S. Marshals Service to 
provide subsistence and return trans-
portation to the very small group of 
noncustodial defendants who are re-
quired to travel to court proceedings 
but are financially unable to cover the 
costs of doing so. While current law 
provides subsistence and travel to pro-
ceedings, there is a gap in the statute. 
H.R. 8124 will expand the statute to 
cover transportation, lodging, and food 
for defendants who are innocent until 
proven guilty, as they return home 
from these proceedings. 
Second, the bill will authorize mag-
istrate judges to decide post-judgment 
motions in misdemeanor cases in which 
they have already exercised trial juris-
diction. Magistrate judges try and sen-
tence 
individuals 
in 
misdemeanor 
cases, but to consider a post-judgment 
motion, current law requires a referral 
by a district judge or the party’s con-
sent. 
This provision in H.R. 8124 will facili-
tate judicial economy and help reduce 
the caseloads of Article III district 
court judges by removing this require-
ment. The more efficient we can make 
our court system, the more effective 
and just it will be. These two non-
controversial changes would meaning-
fully improve the ability of our Federal 
courts to deliver equity and justice to 
the people that they serve. 
The 
Judicial 
Conference 
of 
the 
United States, the national policy-
making body for our Federal court sys-
tem, supports this important and nec-
essary legislation. 
I thank the Committee on the Judici-
ary, and both sides of the aisle, for ap-
proving this bill by voice vote last 
month. 
I would also like to thank my col-
league 
and 
partner, 
Representative 
MARTHA ROBY, the ranking member of 
the Subcommittee on Courts, Intellec-
tual Property, and the Internet, for 
partnering with me on this effort. 
I urge all of my colleagues to vote 
‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 8124. 
b 1400 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
the Criminal Judicial Administration 
Act of 2020 is a modest but important 
bill. I commend our colleagues, Rep-
resentatives JEFFRIES
and ROBY, for 
their leadership in bringing these im-
portant issues to our attention. 
I strongly urge my colleagues to join 
me in supporting this bipartisan bill, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I just want to say that, once again, 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on 
H.R. 8124, the Criminal Judicial Admin-
istration Act of 2020, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. GAR-
CIA) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, H.R. 8124, as amend-
ed. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. BASS) and the gen-
tleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr.

minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unani-
mous consent that all Members may 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the bill 
under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I worked with Rep-
resentatives 
KATHERINE
CLARK
and 
BRENDA LAWRENCE, along with my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle, 
GUY
RESCHENTHALER
and 
DEBBIE 
LESKO, to introduce the bipartisan H.R. 
7718, 
Protecting 
the 
Health 
and 
Wellness 
of 
Babies 
and 
Pregnant 
Women in Custody Act, which will im-
prove the prenatal and postpartum 
care women receive while in BOP cus-
tody and provides additional funding 
for States to do the same. 
Since the early 1980s, the number of 
women in Federal and State custody 
has increased by 700 percent. Women 
are the fastest growing segment of the 
incarcerated population, and women 
are incarcerated mainly for nonviolent 
offenses. Over 60 percent of women in 
prison are mothers with children under 
the age of 18. 
The purpose of this bill is to take a 
comprehensive look at how women are 
cared for while in custody. This bill ad-
dresses a series of health-related con-
cerns raised by women in custody as 
well as the American College of Obste-
tricians and Gynecologists. 
This bill would require that once a 
determination that a woman is preg-
nant is made, that her doctor devise a 
plan that would allow for reasonable 
accommodations for her care while in 
custody. This plan would be provided 
to the warden of each prison. 
The plan would take into account a 
woman’s individual healthcare needs 
during 
pregnancy 
and 
postpartum, 
which includes access to healthcare 
professionals, such as OB/GYNs, nurses, 
doulas, and midwives, to address the 
conditions in prison that, if modified, 
would 
significantly 
improve 
her 
chances of having a healthy pregnancy. 
Reasonable accommodations include 
food and nutrition and access to nutri-
tious food. According to healthcare 
professionals, good maternal nutrition 
can contribute positively to the deliv-
ery of a healthy newborn of an appro-
priate weight. 
We have heard stories of women who 
are incarcerated given an additional 
peanut butter and jelly sandwich to ad-
dress their nutritional needs. This is 
obviously not adequate for a woman 
who is pregnant. 
Another accommodation is transfer-
ring a woman from a top bunk to a 
lower bunk, as pregnant women are at 
high risk for falls, and falls are dan-
gerous for pregnancies. In addition, 
women who are pregnant need access 
to bathrooms and water for the dura-
tion of their pregnancy. I know it 
sounds strange, but in some prisons, 
this is actually an issue. 
Meeting the healthcare needs of 
women has a positive impact on the 
pregnancy and allowing women access 
to OB/GYNs as their primary caregiver 
is vital. 
Birth by caesarean section, on aver-
age, can cost $7,000 to $10,000 more than 
a natural birth, and dealing with 
women appropriately during pregnancy 
reduces the number of caesarean sec-
tions. 
For women who are determined to 
have pregnancies that are considered 
at high risk by their doctor, it might 
be appropriate to say incarceration in 
a prison is not the best way and maybe 
women could be housed closer to home 
in halfway houses. 
After a baby is born, birth mothers 
will be provided with postpartum care 
and also will receive information re-
garding family preservation and their 
parental rights. 
So this is a comprehensive bill, and I 
advise all of my colleagues to support 
the bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5148 
October 1, 2020 
Mr. Speaker, the bipartisan Pro-
tecting the Health and Wellness of Ba-
bies and Pregnant Women in Custody 
Act will improve care and outcomes for 
pregnant women in prison as well as 
for their children. 
I was proud to introduce this impor-
tant legislation with Representatives 
BASS, LESKO, and CLARK. I just want to 
say that Chairwoman BASS was incred-
ible to work with. In particular, we did 
one virtual meeting, which consisted of 
tear-jerking stories that really ad-
dressed the need for change in this 
area. 
Mr. Speaker, women are the fastest 
growing population in Federal prisons, 
yet the system was designed with just 
men in mind. 
In 
2018, 
Congress 
and 
President 
Trump took action to address these in-
equities with the FIRST STEP Act. 
H.R. 7718 will build upon that critical 
work 
by 
addressing 
the 
unique 
healthcare 
needs 
of 
incarcerated 
women who are pregnant, as well as 
those of their babies, which will ensure 
positive outcomes for their families. 
H.R. 7718 establishes minimum stand-
ards of care for pregnant women, un-
born children, and newborns in Federal 
custody. Further, the bill limits the 
use of restraints and restrictive hous-
ing 
for 
pregnant 
women 
and 
postpartum prisoners. 
By providing incarcerated women 
with 
access 
to 
pregnancy-related 
healthcare and services, we can ensure 
better outcomes for mothers and ba-
bies. 
Again, I want to thank Chairwoman 
BASS, Representative LESKO, and Rep-
resentative CLARK for working with me 
on this important piece of legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge the House to sup-
port this important legislation, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. To 
date, the United States incarcerates 
more women than any other country in 
the world. However, Federal, State, 
and local facilities have not fully met 
the needs of pregnant women in their 
care. I would like to share a few stories 
with you. 
Last Congress, Pamela Winn, while 
she sat in the Chamber during the pas-
sage of the FIRST STEP Act, was a 
registered nurse who specialized in ob-
stetrics. She knew her pregnancy was 
in distress after she fell while her 
wrists and ankles were shackled in her 
20th week of pregnancy. 
For weeks after the fall, Ms. Winn 
asked for medical help, which she did 
not receive. She began bleeding in her 
cell and was brought to the hospital in 
shackles. While still in the hospital, 
Ms. Winn asked the guard what hap-
pened to her baby, and he told her that 
her baby was thrown in the trash. That 
is how Ms. Winn discovered she mis-
carried. 
No one should experience what she 
had to endure. 
Andrea 
Circle 
Bear 
is 
the 
first 
woman to die in custody as a result of 
COVID–19. Ms. Circle Bear entered cus-
tody while pregnant and contracted 
COVID–19 while in BOP’s care. She 
later gave birth on a ventilator by cae-
sarean and died without meeting her 
child. 
Ms. Circle Bear, the mother of five 
children, was a high-risk pregnancy 
and could have easily been released. 
She was in on a drug charge. Instead, 
she now leaves behind six children. 
Recently, I spoke with Nicole Ben-
nett, who lives in Los Angeles. Nicole 
is the mother of four and shared her ex-
perience being pregnant with her sec-
ond child while in custody. Ms. Bennett 
did not receive proper prenatal care or 
nutrition. She was shackled during 
labor and immediately after. 
Ms. Bennett, like most women in cus-
tody, was not a violent offender. Yet, 
she was not allowed to hold her infant 
daughter when she was born. It would 
be 6 months before Ms. Bennett saw her 
daughter again. 
Today, her daughter is 8 years old, 
and Ms. Bennett still carries a lot of 
guilt and pain for being shackled, not 
having access to proper prenatal care, 
and having her child in custody with-
out friends or family. Ms. Bennett 
firmly believes this impacted her abil-
ity to bond with her child. 
Tammy Jackson is a woman strug-
gling with mental illness. She was 
brought into custody while in her final 
trimester. Ms. Jackson informed the 
officers that she was in labor, and it 
took 6 hours for her to receive medical 
help. Ms. Jackson gave birth to her 
child in her cell, alone. 
Diana Sanchez could not pay for her 
bond for a traffic violation while in her 
final trimester of pregnancy. Ms. San-
chez requested medical help after she 
began experiencing severe cramps. She 
informed the on-duty nurse, as well as 
the officers on duty, yet Ms. Sanchez 
was left alone in her cell for 5 hours 
and gave birth alone in her cell. The 
entire nightmare was caught on video. 
You can see Ms. Sanchez screaming. 
She should not have been left alone in 
her cell in her third trimester, and she 
should have received medical care from 
an obstetrician. 
This is a comprehensive and strong 
bipartisan bill, and I urge all of my col-
leagues to support H.R. 7718. Support 
pregnant women in custody. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I, again, want to urge my colleagues 
to vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 7718, the Pro-
tecting the Health and Wellness of Ba-
bies and Pregnant Women in Custody 
Act. 
Again, I reiterate that it was an ab-
solute honor to work with Chairwoman 
BASS on this important piece of legisla-
tion. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, one day I hope that 
these mothers mentioned here earlier 
are the last to have experienced not re-
ceiving appropriate care while in cus-
tody and pregnant. 
As we begin to institute criminal jus-
tice reform to stem the increase of peo-
ple entering the system, we must im-
prove the resources provided to those 
who are currently in custody. Support 
H.R. 7718. Support pregnant women in 
custody. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a sen-
ior member of the Committee on the Judiciary 
and Co-Chair of the Congressional Children’s 
Caucus, I rise in strong support of H.R. 7718, 
the ‘‘Protecting the Health and Wellness of 
Babies and Pregnant Women in Custody Act,’’ 
introduced by our colleague Congresswoman 
BASS of California. 
This legislation requires the Bureau of Jus-
tice Statistics to collect and report data relat-
ing to the demographics and physical and 
mental health needs of incarcerated women 
who are pregnant, in labor, or in post-partum 
recovery, at the Federal, State, tribal, and 
local levels. 
In addition, the bill will help ensure that ap-
propriate medical services and programs re-
lated to pregnancy and childbirth are provided 
in the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) and made 
available to women in custody. 
The bill also prohibits the use of restraints 
or restrictive housing, while in BOP or U.S. 
Marshals Service custody, during the period of 
pregnancy, labor, and postpartum recovery, 
unless these measures are necessary. 
Over the past four decades, the total U.S. 
prison population has skyrocketed. 
There are almost 2.3 million people cur-
rently in our nation’s prisons and jails, 36 
which represents a more than 500 percent in-
crease over the last 40 years. 
During the period from 1980 to the present, 
the federal prison population has grown from 
approximately 25,000 to 180,000—an increase 
of over 600 percent. 
A topic that is not as widely discussed is the 
fact that women are the fastest-growing seg-
ment of the incarcerated population. 
In the same time period, the number of 
women in the state prison population has 
grown by 834 percent, at more than double 
the pace of men. 
Today, the overall incarcerated population 
has begun to decrease slightly, although al-
most all of the reduction has been among 
men, and the proportion of incarcerated 
women remains on the rise. 
Since 2000, the jail incarceration rate for 
women has risen 26 percent while the rate for 
men has fallen by 5 percent. 
In addition, at the present time, there are 
more women in prison than at any point in 
U.S. history. 
Nationally, 64 out of every 100,000 women 
were in prison in 2016. 
Since 2013, the percentage of women pros-
ecuted federally has consistently hovered 
around 13 percent. 
At the state level, the rate at which women 
are incarcerated varies greatly; the state with 
the highest rate of female imprisonment is 
Oklahoma and the states with the lowest in-
carceration rates for women are Rhode Island 
and Massachusetts.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5149 
October 1, 2020 
In 35 states, women’s incarceration num-
bers have been higher than men’s, and in a 
few states, the growth of women’s prison pop-
ulations have counteracted any reductions in 
men’s incarceration numbers. 
Further, women in jail are the fastest grow-
ing correctional population in the country, in-
creasing 14-fold between 1970 and 2014. 
This trend is even greater in small counties, 
where there has been a 31-fold increase be-
tween 1970 and 2014. 
Significantly, nearly half of all incarcerated 
women are held in jails. 
Mr. Speaker, somewhere between 3 percent 
and 6 percent of women entering the prison 
system are pregnant, with the highest rates of 
pregnancies being in local jails. 
Statistics from the Bureau of Prisons show 
that there were 171 pregnancies in federal 
prison in 2018. 
While the prison health care system is bare-
ly adequate for men, it fails to meet incarcer-
ated women’s basic needs. 
The situation is even more dire for pregnant 
women in prison who have additional and 
unique health needs. 
A significant portion of women come into the 
prison system with a history of poverty, sub-
stance abuse, and trauma and abuse. 
Women who enter prison are also less likely 
to have had access to regular health care be-
fore their incarceration, especially appropriate 
prenatal care. 
Moreover, women in prison are more likely 
to suffer from undiagnosed chronic illnesses, 
such as diabetes and high blood pressure, 
that can cause a high-risk pregnancy. 
Another salutary aspect of H.R. 7718 is that 
provides education and technical assistance 
by the National Institute of Corrections to state 
and local corrections facilities on appropriate 
medical care for pregnant women and to en-
sure training of BOP correctional officers at fa-
cilities housing women and of deputy U.S. 
Marshals, on the requirements of the bill. 
Finally, the legislation directs GAO to study 
and report to Congress the services and pro-
tections provided for pregnant incarcerated 
women in local and State correctional settings 
and in Federal pretrial detention facilities and 
authorizes the Attorney General to make 
grants to State, tribal, and local governments, 
to promote and support the health needs of in-
carcerated pregnant women. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 7718 complements and 
expands on the SIMARRA Act I introduced in 
the 114th and 115th Congress (i.e., H.R. 
5130, H.R. 3410) and incorporated in the Vio-
lence Against Women Reauthorization Act, 
legislation which directs the Bureau of Prisons 
to establish a pilot program to allow incarcer-
ated women who give birth and children born 
during such incarceration to reside together in 
a separate prison housing unit. 
I strongly support this legislation and urge 
all Members to join me in voting to pass H.R. 
7718, the ‘‘Protecting the Health and Wellness 
of Babies and Pregnant Women in Custody 
Act.’’ 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
BASS) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, H.R. 7718, as amend-
ed. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

FIGHT NOTARIO FRAUD ACT OF 
2020 
Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 8225) to amend title 18, United

of fraud in the provision of immigra-
tion services, and for other purposes, as

SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EF-
FECTS. 
The budgetary effects of this Act, for the 
purpose of complying with the Statutory 
Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be deter-
mined by reference to the latest statement 
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in 
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. BASS) and the gen-
tleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER) each will control 20 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unani-
mous consent that all Members have 5 
legislative days to revise and extend 
their remarks and include extraneous 
material on the bill under consider-
ation. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 8225, the Fight 
Notario Fraud Act of 2020, would ad-
dress notario fraud, the practice of the 
provision of unauthorized immigration 
legal services, which has not been ef-
fectively curbed by existing Federal, 
State, and local efforts. 
The practice continues to cause ir-
reparable harm to immigrant commu-
nities. Notario fraud proliferates all 
over the United States because there is 
an overwhelming need for representa-
tion in immigration proceedings. 
In any given year, United States Citi-
zenship and Immigration Services re-
ceives approximately 6 million applica-
tions from individuals and businesses 
seeking an immigration benefit, hu-
manitarian relief, or naturalization. 
Immigration proceedings are notori-
ously and unusually complex, as one 
editorial described them, dizzyingly 
Byzantine. The high demand for assist-
ance with this complex set of laws at-
tracts 
charlatans 
who 
prey 
on 
unsuspecting victims. 
Unfortunately, 
efforts 
to 
curb 
notario fraud for the past several dec-
ades have fallen short. Education cam-
paigns by local governments, bar asso-
ciations, and grassroots organizations 
have raised public awareness and have 
stemmed notario fraud somewhat. 
While 34 States and the District of 
Columbia have some type of statute 
outlawing the unauthorized practice of 
immigration law, only a handful have 
more comprehensive laws, like Cali-
fornia, Illinois, New York, and Wash-
ington. Most jurisdictions address the 
issue by limiting the activities of li-
censed notaries public. But this is rare-
ly effective, and even where laws have 
been enacted at the State level, these 
efforts have done little to meaningfully 
rein in notario fraud. 
Leadership from the Department of 
Justice is needed. The Federal Govern-
ment plays a singular role in immigra-
tion proceedings, so it must also under-
take efforts to protect the integrity of 
the immigration process and to protect 
vulnerable victims from fraud and ille-
gal deceit. 
We must strengthen the ability of 
Federal prosecutors to hold notarios 
accountable for their malfeasance. 
Congress must act carefully when 
creating new crimes. There must be 
strong need and justification for them, 
but this is one instance where State 
and local efforts have fallen short, and 
Federal enforcement has been almost 
nonexistent. 
This bill’s comprehensive approach 
would not only criminalize notario 
fraud at the Federal level and in 16 
States that have yet to enact such leg-
islation, but it would also establish an 
enforcement apparatus within the De-
partment of Justice to combat fraudu-
lent notario schemes nationwide. 
Importantly, this bill requires the 
Department of Justice to post informa-
tion on the internet aimed at pro-
tecting consumers from fraud, includ-
ing maintaining a public list of individ-
uals who have been convicted of unlaw-
ful conduct under this bill or have been 
found by the State or Federal agency 
to have unlawfully provided immigra-
tion services. 
The Fight Notario Fraud Act will 
help prevent fraud and protect vulner-
able victims. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of 
my colleagues to support this legisla-
tion, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 8225, the Fight 
Notario Fraud Act of 2020, addresses a 
problem that already has a remedy in 
current law. 
The U.S. Department of Justice and 
State and local officials fight against 
fraud every day, including fraud re-
lated to immigration laws. In addition, 
the Executive Office for Immigration 
Review maintains a Fraud and Abuse 
Prevention Program as a centralized 
place for anyone to make complaints 
about issues of fraud, immigration 
scams, and the unauthorized practice 
of immigration law. 
These existing efforts to fight immi-
gration fraud are working. For exam-
ple, in San Antonio, Texas, the DOJ 
charged Eric Jon Alva and his wife, 
Jessica Rivas Alva, in a scheme to de-
fraud undocumented immigrants by 
falsely claiming to work on behalf of 
two San Antonio attorneys. Although 
they pled guilty and were sentenced to 
6 months in Federal prison, they could 
have been sentenced up to 5 years, and 
that is 5 years under current law. 
By contrast, the bill before us today 
would impose only a 1-year sentence 
for 
similar 
crimes. 
In 
rare 
cir-
cumstances, the defendant may receive 
a 3-year sentence. 
So the Democrats’ response to a 
problem in the immigrant community 
is apparently to go soft on crime and 
reduce the penalties for immigration 
fraud. That doesn’t make sense. 
We also should not be in the business 
of complicating the immigration sys-
tem, but this bill does just that. 
This bill prohibits the unauthorized 
practice of law specific to immigration, 
but the unauthorized practice of law, 
no matter the type, is already illegal. 
Additionally, by dedicating prosecu-
tors specifically to notario fraud and 
creating burdensome requirements for 
prosecuting this fraud, H.R. 8225 could 
leave 
other 
types 
of 
immigration 
crimes understaffed and unaddressed. 
Mr. Speaker, I truly appreciate the 
sentiment behind this bill, I truly do, 
but if we are going to create a new cat-
egory of immigration fraud, we should 
make it as strong as existing law and 
work to simplify, not to complicate, 
the current system. Immigrants fol-
lowing the legal system deserve as 
much. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. GARCIA). 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today on the House floor to express 
my strong and unwavering support for 
the Fight Notario Fraud Act of 2020. 
This bill would hold public notaries 
accountable that abuse their power to 
take advantage of vulnerable commu-
nities with language barriers or who 
cannot read or who cannot fully under-
stand the legal system. 
Many Spanish-speaking immigrants, 
for example, turn to notaries because 
in their home countries a notario 
publico refers to a lawyer. 
H.R. 8225 criminalizes notario fraud 
schemes to ensure that no one can take 
advantage 
of 
the 
literal-sounding 
translation of notario publico. 
Significantly, 
some 
grifters 
have 
fraudulently used the notary public 
title to hold themselves out as author-
ized to provide advice and services. 
When I was a legal aid lawyer, I re-
member seeing firsthand many deceit-
ful practices at the expense of poor

people due to the language barrier, due 
to the immigration status, or due to 
the fact that people could not read the 
papers that they brought to the notario 
publicos. That was wrong then, and it 
is still wrong today. 
As Members of Congress, we have a 
responsibility to protect the well-being 
and livelihoods of the most vulnerable 
among us, including American families 
across the country. Certainly, courts 
have recognized the widespread preva-
lence of notario fraud, and the negative 
impact on immigrants and their fami-
lies is clear. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my 
comadre and good friend, Congress-
woman DEBBIE
MUCARSEL-POWELL
of 
south Florida, for exemplary leadership 
on this issue and for sponsoring this 
bill. I urge all of my colleagues to vote 
in favor of this very important legisla-
tion. Let’s put an end to these fraudu-
lent schemes. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-

Mr. Speaker, I have concerns that 
H.R. 8225 will only further complicate 
the immigration system and hurt rath-
er than help the very people it is meant 
to protect. So with immigrants in 
mind, I have concerns with this bill as 
written. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, the harms brought by 
notario schemes can be devastating. 
This bill’s combination of enforcement 
and public education is critically need-
ed 
to 
protect 
some of the most 
unsuspecting and vulnerable victims of 
fraud. 
The Department of Justice must 
refocus its efforts to target notario 
fraud, and we are enabling them to do 
so with this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative 
MUCARSEL-POWELL
for 
championing 
this issue, and I urge my colleagues to 
join me in supporting this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a sen-
ior member of the Committee on the Judiciary, 
I rise in strong support of H.R. 8225, the 
‘‘Fight Notario Fraud Act,’’ introduced by the 
gentlelady 
from 
Florida, 
Congresswoman 
Murcasel-Powell. 
I support this legislation because it protects 
persons who are the most vulnerable in soci-
ety against unconscionable predatory conduct 
from fraudulent ‘‘notarios pu´blicos’’ who use 
the ‘‘notary public’’ title to hold themselves out 
as authorized to provide immigration legal ad-
vice and services. 
Specifically, H.R. 8225 would criminalize the 
provision of fraudulent legal services, certain 
misrepresentations by individuals who claim to 
be authorized to practice immigration law, and 
threats and retaliation associated with the pro-
vision of fraudulent legal services. 
Additionally, the bill would require the Attor-
ney General to create no fewer than 15 Spe-
cial United States Attorney positions to pros-
ecute notario fraud crimes. 
Mr. Speaker, the roots of modern ‘‘notario 
fraud’’ in the United States stem from a prac-
tice in parts of Latin America where ‘‘notarios 
pu´blicos,’’ (which could be literally translated 
to ‘‘notaries public’’) are lawyers and, as such, 
are authorized to provide legal services. 
Unlike in the United States, because 
‘‘notario pblicos’’ in Latin America have a law 
license and can represent others in court, 
many Spanish-speaking immigrants in the 
United States turn to notaries thinking they are 
attorneys able to represent them in legal pro-
ceedings, especially cases involving immigra-
tion claims. 
On account of linguistic and cultural dif-
ferences in meaning, notario fraud dispropor-
tionately targets immigrants from Latin Amer-
ica who are not fluent English speakers or fa-
miliar with the difference between the Latin 
American and American legal systems. 
Notarios often gain the trust of the immi-
grant families they defraud, making extrava-
gant promises and preying on the desperation 
of families. 
The effect of the breach of trust can often 
be dire and multifaceted. Notarios often make 
mistakes in these filings and proceedings, 
which can result in irreversibly negative immi-
gration consequences for their clients. 
A notario’s legal errors can lead to an unfa-
vorable review in immigration courts and may 
prejudice the immigrant-appellant on appeal. 
Fly-by-night notarios may skip town with im-
portant documentation immigrants need to file 
for immigration relief or they may apply for re-
lief without the immigrant-applicant’s knowl-
edge. 
A notario’s advice to a parent may impact 
the separate and independent relief a child ap-
plicant may have. 
Currently, equitable relief for this malfea-
sance is not available in the immigration pro-
ceedings and, even worse, defrauded immi-
grants can be charged with filing false claims. 
Immigrants have been defrauded of hun-
dreds or even thousands of dollars by unscru-
pulous notarios only to find out they will not 
receive the services they were promised and, 
in some cases, these individuals find them-
selves in worse conditions than when they 
originally sought help with their immigration 
matters. 
After they discover that they have been 
bilked, many immigrants are afraid to report 
notaries; by some estimates, only one in every 
hundred cases are reported. 
In one civil action initiated by the Federal 
Trade Commission in 2011, investigators re-
covered evidence of 2,785 defrauded immi-
grants, but only 99 consumer complaints asso-
ciated with the notario grifter—a reporting rate 
of 3.55 percent. 
Because many of the victims of notarios 
also do not have legal immigration status, they 
fear negative immigration outcomes if they at-
tempt to bring a complaint. 
Courts across the country have recognized 
the widespread prevalence of notario fraud. 
The proposed explicit criminalization of 
notario fraud is necessary to focus criminal 
fraud prosecution on widespread scams that 
target some of the least sophisticated and 
most vulnerable individuals in our society. 
I strongly support this legislation and urge 
all Members to join me in voting for its pas-
sage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
BASS) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, H.R. 8225, as amend-
ed. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
EMPOWERING 
OLYMPIC, 
PARALYMPIC, 
AND 
AMATEUR 
ATHLETES ACT OF 2020 
Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 
2330) to amend the Ted Stevens Olym-
pic and Amateur Sports Act to provide 
for 
congressional 
oversight 
of 
the 
board of directors of the United States 
Olympic and Paralympic Committee 
and to protect amateur athletes from 
emotional, physical, and sexual abuse, 
and for other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 2330 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Empowering 
Olympic, Paralympic, and Amateur Athletes 
Act of 2020’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress makes the following findings: 
(1) The courageous voice of survivors is a 
call to action to end emotional, physical, 
and sexual abuse in the Olympic and 
Paralympic movement. 
(2) Larry Nassar, the former national team 
doctor for USA Gymnastics, sexually abused 
over 300 athletes for over two decades be-
cause of ineffective oversight by USA Gym-
nastics and the United States Olympic Com-
mittee. 
(3) While the case of Larry Nassar is un-
precedented in scale, the case is hardly the 
only recent incident of sexual abuse in ama-
teur sports. 
(4) Survivors of Larry Nassar’s abuse and 
all survivors of abuse in the Olympic and 
Paralympic movement deserve justice and 
redress for the wrongs the survivors have 
suffered. 
(5) After a comprehensive congressional in-
vestigation, including interviews and state-
ments from survivors, former and current or-
ganization officials, law enforcement, and 
advocates, Congress found that the United 
States Olympic Committee and USA Gym-
nastics fundamentally failed to uphold their 
existing statutory purposes and duty to pro-
tect amateur athletes from sexual, emo-
tional, or physical abuse. 
(6) USA Gymnastics and the United States 
Olympic Committee knowingly concealed 
abuse by Larry Nassar, leading to the abuse 
of dozens of additional amateur athletes dur-
ing the period beginning in the summer of 
2015 and ending in September 2016. 
(7) Ending abuse in the Olympic and 
Paralympic movement requires enhanced 
oversight to ensure that the Olympic and 
Paralympic movement does more to serve 
athletes and protect their voice and safety.

visions of this Act and the amendments 
made by this Act shall not be affected. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. BASS) and the gen-
tleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER) each will control 20 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unani-
mous consent that all Members have 5 
legislative days to revise and extend 
their remarks and include extraneous 
material on the bill under consider-
ation. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of S. 2330, the Empowering Olympic, 
Paralympic, and Amateur Athletes Act 
of 2020, a bipartisan bill that restores 
integrity to the Olympic movement 
and provides much-needed protections 
to our country’s amateur athletes in 
the wake of the Larry Nassar sexual 
abuse scandal. 
S. 2330 was introduced after bipar-
tisan investigations, launched in both 
the House and the Senate, revealed sys-
temic failures within the Olympic com-
munity that contributed to widespread 
instances of sexual abuse of athletes, 
including minors. 
b 1430 
These include a lack of effective 
oversight of the U.S. Olympic and 
Paralympic Committee and amateur 
sports national governing bodies, the 
failure of these organizations to uphold 
their duty to protect athletes from 
abuse by failing to report allegations of 
wrongdoings to appropriate law en-
forcement authorities, and concealing 
these failures and neglecting to enact 
serious reforms. 
S. 2330 addresses these issues through 
a series of governance and oversight re-
forms, including increasing the liabil-
ity of the USOPC and NGB for failing 
to take appropriate action in response 
to allegations of abuse, providing con-
gressional authority to dissolve the 
USOPC board and decertified NGBs, in-
creasing the level of amateur athletes’ 
representations on the USOPC board 
and NGB governing structures, and re-
quiring the USOPC to establish clear 
procedures and reporting requirements 
to protect athletes. 
Importantly, the bill also strength-
ens the work and independence of the 
Center for SafeSport, the nonprofit or-
ganization that is responsible for inves-
tigating allegations of sexual abuse 
against athletes. The bill requires 
USOPC to provide the Center for 
SafeSport $20 million in funding each 
year to cover its operating costs. 
The bill also prevents potential con-
flicts of interest by prohibiting individ-
uals who are employed by the USOPC 
or an NGB from serving the Center for 
SafeSport and limiting the ability of 
former employers and board members 
from serving. 
S. 2330 is supported by the USOPC, 
the Center for SafeSport, and a coali-
tion 
of 
hundreds 
of 
Olympic 
and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5160 
October 1, 2020 
Paralympic athletes, coaches, sports 
leaders, and sexual abuse survivors. 
The bill passed by the Senate by 
unanimous consent on August 4, 2020, 
and its companion bill, H.R. 7881, has 
bipartisan support here in the House as 
well. 
I commend the work of Senators 
BLUMENTHAL and MORAN, as well as 
Representatives TED LIEU, JOHN CUR-
TIS, DIANA
DEGETTE, SUSAN BROOKS, 
ANN KUSTER, and MICHAEL BURGESS for 
their tireless work on this bill. 
I urge all of my colleagues to vote in 
favor of this bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 
2330, 
the 
Empowering 
Olympic, 
Paralympic, and Amateur Athletes Act 
of 2020. 
In 2016, we were shaken by the rev-
elations of abuse that permeated USA 
Gymnastics and the Olympic commu-
nity. While the blame for this abuse 
falls squarely at the feet of the pred-
ator, USA Gymnastics and the U.S. 
Olympic & Paralympic Committee also 
failed the victims. 
In 2017, the U.S. Olympic Committee 
created the U.S. Center for SafeSport. 
SafeSport is an independent organiza-
tion entrusted with responding to re-
ports of abuse and misconduct within 
the Olympic Committee. 
S. 
2330 
supports 
the 
work 
that 
SafeSport is doing and helps address 
the shortcomings in the committee 
that allowed the abuse to occur. One of 
the most important reforms in this bill 
is a requirement that athletes serve on 
the governing bodies that oversee their 
sports, ensuring that athletes finally 
get a seat at the table. 
I thank Senator MORAN and the other 
Senators who investigated these issues 
and developed these important reforms. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
important piece of legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I have no further speak-
ers, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I again ac-
knowledge the leadership and commit-
ment of so many of my colleagues who 
worked in a bipartisan fashion on this 
important bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I support S. 2330, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. DEGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in 
support 
of 
the 
Empowering 
Olympic, 
Paralympic and Amateur Athletes Act. 
The Olympics are meant to be a celebra-
tion. A coming together of our Nation’s finest, 
who have given their all to represent us on the 
world’s stage. 
And yet, over the past several years, abuse 
allegations have filtered into every corner of 
the Olympic sports. 
USOP—the very body that was created to 
care for our athletes—became more con-
cerned about protecting its brand than the ath-
letes themselves. We know now that USOPC 
and USA Gymnastics officials knew about the 
horrific sexual assault allegations brought 
against Larry Nassar, and still chose to ignore 
them. 
It is long past time for a change. 
Our Olympic athletes devote their entire 
lives to representing the United States of 
America. Today, Congress is making good on 
our promise to represent them. 
This legislation includes my bill to form an 
independent, blue-ribbon commission to study 
and reform the Nation’s top sport’s governing 
body. 
The 16-member independent commission 
would be made up of, at least, eight Olympic 
or Paralympic athletes and will be tasked with 
studying 
how 
the 
U.S. 
Olympic 
and 
Paralympic Committee operates, and provide 
Congress a list of recommendations to better 
protect the nation’s top athletes. 
A gold medal is not worth the lives that 
have been torn apart because of this. 
I’m thrilled that we’re passing this bill, but 
today’s victory is only the first step towards 
much needed reform of the U.S. Olympic and 
Paralympic Committee. 
I look forward to continuing to work with the 
USOPC, National Governing Bodies, and ath-
letes across the nation so that we may strive 
towards a more resilient Team USA. 
We must continue to find ways to give our 
athletes a voice in the process—and to ensure 
that it’s putting their well-being above all else. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
BASS) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, S. 2330. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
CORRECTING THE ENROLLMENT 
OF S. 2330 
Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unani-
mous consent to take from the Speak-
er’s table the concurrent resolution (S. 
Con. Res. 46) to correct the enrollment 
of S. 2330, and ask for its immediate 
consideration in the House.

woman from California?

GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unani-
mous consent that all Members have 5 
legislative days to revise and extend 
their remarks and include extraneous 
material on the bill under consider-
ation. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of 
H.R. 
6813, 
the 
Promoting 
Alz-
heimer’s Awareness to Prevent Elder 
Abuse Act. This bill requires the Jus-
tice Department’s training materials 
to address treating, protecting, and 
caring for people living with Alz-
heimer’s and related dementias. 
More than 5 million Americans are 
currently living with Alzheimer’s or 
dementia. One study estimates that 
over 50 percent of these individuals 
may experience some type of elder 
abuse. Neglect is the most often re-
ported type of abuse, followed by finan-
cial exploitation. 
Building upon the Elder Abuse Pre-
vention and Prosecution Act of 2017, 
H.R. 6813 addresses the need for better 
training of law enforcement officers, 
first responders, social workers, pros-
ecutors, and judges. This legislation 
would strengthen the best practices 
and training materials available to 
medical professionals and financial 
services personnel who interact with 
this special population. 
Significantly, the bill would also es-
tablish a new requirement to address 
situations in which individuals living 
with Alzheimer’s or dementia may be 
involved in a criminal case as a victim 
or a witness. 
In addition, the bill requires greater 
collaboration and consultation between 
government agencies at the Federal, 
State, and local levels, as well as with 
nationally recognized nonprofit asso-
ciations with relevant expertise. 
According 
to 
one 
recent 
report, 
deaths attributed to Alzheimer’s dis-
ease and dementia rose to more than 20 
percent above normal this summer. In 
June alone, there were more than 61,000 
dementia-related deaths, 10,000 more 
than the same period last year. In-
creased isolation, stress, and staff 
shortages at nursing homes are all 
likely contributing factors to the high-
er-than-normal death toll. 
Our seniors living in long-term care 
facilities are particularly vulnerable 
and isolated given current physical 
distancing measures that limit contact 
with family members and other visits. 
Most of these residents have some form 
of cognitive impairment and are at an 
even greater risk of mistreatment or 
exploitation. This legislation would ex-
pand the quality and scope of demen-
tia-specific training materials, leading 
to improved practices and processes to 
combat elder abuse and exploitation. 
As this public health crisis con-
tinues, our senior citizens face even 
greater risk. This legislation addresses 
an important and timely need for this 
uniquely vulnerable population. 
I thank Representative DEUTCH for 
introducing this legislation that has 
strong bipartisan support and for his 
leadership in expanding protections for 
our vulnerable citizens living with Alz-
heimer’s and dementia. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to 
join me in supporting this important 
bill, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I am glad that today 
the House is considering the Promoting 
Alzheimer’s 
Awareness 
to 
Prevent 
Elder Abuse Act, which I introduced 
with fellow Judiciary Committee mem-
ber Representative TED DEUTCH. 
Elder abuse, which includes financial 
fraud, physical abuse, and neglect af-
fects at least 10 percent of senior citi-
zens each year. Seniors living with Alz-
heimer’s and other forms of dementia 
are 
especially 
vulnerable 
to 
elder 
abuse. 
It is estimated that up to 50 percent 
of these individuals fall prey to fraud, 
exploitation, and other harm. Often 
seniors suffering from these conditions 
have a harder time communicating 
with first responders and other profes-
sionals, which, in turn, makes it harder 
to provide help. 
H.R. 6813 will help Americans strug-
gling with Alzheimer’s and dementia 
by equipping first responders and care-
givers with essential tools to prevent 
and respond to incidents of elder abuse. 
Specifically, this legislation directs 
the Department of Justice to develop 
best practices for assisting profes-
sionals, including law enforcement, 
emergency personnel, and medical pro-
fessionals who encounter and support 
people living with Alzheimer’s and 
other forms of dementia. 
I continue to hear from seniors in 
southwestern Pennsylvania about the 
strain COVID–19 has placed on their 
lives and the prevalence of virus-re-
lated scams. I hope this bill will allevi-
ate some of those burdens. 
Again, I thank my colleague, Rep-
resentative TED DEUTCH, for working 
with me to help stop elder abuse and to 
protect our Nation’s seniors. I urge my 
colleagues to support this legislation. 
I reserve the balance of my time, Mr. 
Speaker. 
Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 
minutes to the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. DEUTCH). 
Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my friend from California for yielding. 
I stand in strong support of H.R. 6813, 
the Promoting Alzheimer’s Awareness 
to Prevent Elder Abuse Act. This bill is 
as simple as it is bipartisan. 
Too many of the folks who are 
charged with protecting older Ameri-
cans don’t have the specialized knowl-
edge and training needed to assist peo-
ple with Alzheimer’s and other forms of 
dementia. This knowledge gap will be a 
growing problem as our Nation’s popu-
lation continues to age. 
In 2019, there were about 5.8 million 
people in the United States who were 
living with Alzheimer’s. By 2050, the 
population is estimated to grow to 
close to 14 million people. And while 
not all of those with dementia are sen-
iors, 81 percent of people living with 
Alzheimer’s in the United States are 75 
years of age or older. 
People living with Alzheimer’s and 
other forms of dementia are especially 
vulnerable to the ongoing coronavirus 
pandemic, and they are frequent tar-
gets for fraud and other scams. This 
means more interactions between peo-
ple with Alzheimer’s and first respond-
ers, 
adult 
protective 
services, 
the 
courts, and others in the community. 
Families and other caregivers know 
the challenges of dementia. These dis-
eases steal so much from their loved 
ones, but caregivers step up every day 
to help people with dementia stay safe 
and stay healthy. Unfortunately, the 
strategies 
and 
caregiving 
practices 
that they use aren’t known by others 
who are charged with preventing elder 
abuse and fraud.

This bill will close that gap in knowl-
edge. 
The 
bipartisan 
Promoting 
Alz-
heimer’s Awareness to Prevent Elder 
Abuse Act will ensure that first re-
sponders, court officers, and other so-
cial services personnel have access to 
the best practices and necessary train-
ing to assist people with Alzheimer’s. 
This bill will bring everyone to-
gether—the Department of Justice; De-
partment of Health and Human Serv-
ices; State, local, and Tribal adult pro-
tective 
services; 
law 
enforcement, 
aging, social, and human services agen-
cies; and nonprofit associations—to de-
velop best practices and training mate-
rials to get everyone on the same page 
to help. 
By ensuring that everyone knows 
how 
to 
support 
people 
with 
Alz-
heimer’s, we can better protect against 
fraud and abuse. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague 
from 
Pennsylvania, 
Congressman 
RESCHENTHALER, for his strong work 
and strong support of this bill. We have 
built a strong, bipartisan coalition 
that supports this legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I also want to extend 
appreciation to the Alzheimer’s Asso-
ciation for their expertise and for their 
advocacy. They have done so much to 
support people with Alzheimer’s and 
their caregivers. This bill will put Fed-
eral Government support behind their 
important work. It will help to support 
people with Alzheimer’s and other 
forms of dementia. It will help their 
caregivers who look out for this vul-
nerable population. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge passage 
of this bill. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. BASS) for yielding me the 
time. 
I hope my time has not started run-
ning. We are trying to be COVID–19 
safe. 
Mr. Speaker, let me thank the spon-
sor of this bill, Mr. DEUTCH, and his bi-
partisan cosponsors, and indicate my 
strong support for H.R. 6813, Promoting 
Alzheimer’s 
Awareness 
to 
Prevent 
Elder Abuse, and to let him know that 
this is something that I think is enor-
mously important and is seen through-
out our districts. 
As I talk about this legislation, how-
ever, let me say what a pleasure it was 
for me to do a video to celebrate our 
virtual walk right in Houston, Texas, 
2020 Walk to End Alzheimer’s, where 
thousands will be walking in their 
front yards, they will be walking in 
backyards, they will be walking on 
trails, they will be walking in parks. 
They will be committed to ending Alz-
heimer’s through the Houston Alz-
heimer’s Association and the region. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank them 
for their great leadership. I have joined 
them every year at the University of 
Houston. These are committed and 
dedicated caretakers and others who 
want to make sure that they keep sen-
iors safe. 
This bipartisan legislation strength-
ens the Elder Abuse Prevention and 
Prosecution Act passed by Congress in 
2017 by providing for better collection 
and use of data on elder abuse and re-
quiring the Department of Justice’s 
Elder Justice coordinator to develop 
best practices and training materials 
for professionals treating, protecting, 
and caring for people living with Alz-
heimer’s and related dementia. 
This is an important initiative with a 
companion bill. 
According to the National Council on 
Aging, seniors who have been abused 
have a 300 percent higher risk of death 
when compared to those who have not 
been mistreated. Combine that with 
COVID–19 
and 
caretakers 
getting 
COVID–19 and sometimes strange per-
sons coming in to take care of your 
loved one. This is an important initia-
tive. 
During the current pandemic, the 
health and safety of people living with 
Alzheimer’s and other forms of demen-
tia are at an even greater risk. Ap-
proximately 7 out of 10 residents in 
long-term facilities have some form of 
cognitive impairment, with 29 percent 
having mild impairment, 23 percent 
moderate impairment, and 19 percent 
severe impairment. 
We know when the misguided rec-
ommendations came from the Federal 
Government that it was only elders 
that got COVID–19, we understood that, 
of course, that was not true, but we 
know COVID–19 was in nursing homes. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I yield an 
additional 15 seconds to the gentle-
woman from Texas. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, so 
this is, of course, a very important ini-
tiative for helping to safeguard our 
elder population. 
But more importantly, I want to say 
that we need to end Alzheimer’s, or de-
mentia, as we know it, and I join my 
colleagues in supporting this very im-
portant legislation. 
I know Mr. DEUTCH’s commitment to 
fighting Alzheimer’s, ending it in our 
lifetime, providing a cure, and also to 
end elder abuse. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask everyone to sup-
port H.R. 6813. 
Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the 
Committee on the Judiciary and as a cospon-
sor, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6813, the 
‘‘Promoting Alzheimer’s Awareness to Prevent 
Elder Abuse Act,’’ introduced by Congressman 
DEUTCH of Florida. 
This bipartisan legislation strengthens the 
Elder Abuse Prevention and Prosecution Act 
passed by Congress in 2017, by providing for 
better collection and use of data on elder 
abuse and requiring the Department of Jus-
tice’s Elder Justice Coordinator to develop 
best practices and training materials for pro-
fessionals treating, protecting, and caring for 
people living with Alzheimer’s and related de-
mentias. 
Companion legislation (S. 3703) passed the 
Senate on August 6, 2020. 
Mr. Speaker, according to the National 
Council on Aging, seniors who have been 
abused have a 300 percent higher risk of 
death when compared to those who have not 
been mistreated. 
During the current pandemic, the health and 
safety of people living with Alzheimer’s and 
other forms of dementia are at even greater 
risk. 
Approximately seven out of ten residents in 
long-term care facilities have some form of 
cognitive impairment, with 29 percent having 
mild impairment, 23 percent moderate impair-
ment, and 19 percent severe impairment. 
According to one study, over 50 percent of 
nursing home staff admitted to mistreating 
(e.g. physical violence, mental abuse, neglect) 
older patients within the prior year. 
With current social isolation measures lim-
iting contact with family members and other 
visitors, these individuals are at even greater 
risk of abuse and exploitation. 
Several federal agencies currently collect 
elder abuse data on an ongoing basis. Two 
distinct data sets include the National Adult 
Mistreatment Report System (NAMRS) (which 
collects state-level adult protective services 
data) and the Financial Crimes Enforcement 
Network (FinCEN) (which collects data on sus-
pected elder financial exploitation submitted by 
financial institutions). 
Although many cases may go unreported, 
the National Adult Mistreatment Report Sys-
tem (NAMRS) (which collects state-level adult 
protective services data) reflects data on elder 
abuse cases reported to state and local au-
thorities. 
Based on the most currently reported data, 
neglect comprised the highest percentage 
across types of elder abuse, followed by finan-
cial exploitation. 
Financial exploitation causes large eco-
nomic losses for elders, families, businesses, 
and government programs, and one of the key 
factors that makes the elderly more suscep-
tible to financial exploitation is cognitive de-
cline. 
According to data collected by the Financial 
Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), finan-
cial exploitation lasts longer than average in 
cases where the targeted person has a dimin-
ished cognitive capacity. 
Such person are particularly vulnerable to 
scams as their condition makes it more dif-
ficult for them to communicate the crimes to 
law enforcement or to seek critical assistance 
from first responders or other social services 
personnel. 
People living with Alzheimer’s or dementia 
often have difficulty understanding or explain-
ing situations; and their behaviors may be mis-
understood as uncooperative, disruptive or 
combative. 
The Elder Abuse Prevention and Prosecu-
tion Act required the Justice Department to 
create training materials to help criminal jus-
tice, health care, and social services per-
sonnel assess and respond to elder abuse 
cases. 
Under the Act, the Elder Justice Coordinator 
is responsible for evaluating training models to 
determine best practices and creating or com-
piling and making publicly available replication 
guides and training materials for law enforce-
ment officers, first responders, social workers,

prosecutors, judges, individuals working in vic-
tim services, adult protective services, medical 
personnel, mental health personnel, financial 
services personnel, and any other individuals 
that encounter and support people living with 
Alzheimer’s and other types of dementia. 
The legislation before us builds upon exist-
ing requirements for training materials by re-
quiring the Elder Justice Coordinator to en-
gage in greater consultation with relevant enti-
ties and stakeholders. 
H.R. 6813 would also require further training 
materials relating to victims and witnesses 
who have Alzheimer’s disease and related de-
mentias. 
One study determined that a significant sub-
set of individuals with dementia illnesses could 
reliably report on emotional events and were 
even able to report details of the event accu-
rately and to recall the same event with the 
same accuracy after a short time delay. 
Crime victims with dementia should be eval-
uated for their ability to remember emotional 
events in order to determine whether they can 
provide testimony about the criminal events. 
This legislation would require the Elder Jus-
tice Coordinator to develop specific training 
materials for these types of cases. 
The bill also aligns with the latest rec-
ommendations from the National Plan to Ad-
dress Alzheimer’s Disease, which includes dis-
seminating information on abuse of this vul-
nerable population and educating law enforce-
ment about interacting with these individuals. 
Mr. Speaker, dementia-specific training ma-
terials will improve the quality of professionals’ 
interactions with individuals living with Alz-
heimer’s and other dementia, and will also 
help protect them from elder abuse and ex-
ploitation. 
Mr. Speaker, in this time when the nation is 
being ravaged by the coronavirus pandemic, 
greater dissemination of best practices and 
improved training materials will help first re-
sponders, law enforcement, medical profes-
sionals and other individuals effectively inter-
act with people living with Alzheimer’s and 
other dementia who are targeted by fraud and 
in need. 
I strongly support this legislation and urge 
all Members to join me in voting for its pas-
sage. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, in closing, I just wanted to again re-
iterate what an honor it was to work 
with my friend and colleague, Rep-
resentative TED DEUTCH, on this impor-
tant piece of legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my 
colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 6813, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, this issue touches mil-
lions of families across America who 
have a loved one living with Alz-
heimer’s or dementia. 
For this vulnerable population, there 
is far too great a risk of elder abuse, 
neglect, or financial exploitation, and 
the current pandemic has taken a tre-
mendous toll. Across the country, resi-
dents of long-term care facilities are 
facing increased risk around COVID–19, 
as well as greater mortality rates. 
Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I ask my col-
leagues to join me in supporting pas-
sage of H.R. 6813 today, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
BASS) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, H.R. 6813. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

SEC. 303. USE OF VALUE OF LAND FOR COST 
SHARING. 
The Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restora-
tion Act (16 U.S.C. 669 et seq.) is amended— 
(1) by redesignating section 13 as section 
14; and 
(2) by inserting after section 12 the fol-
lowing: 
‘‘SEC. 13. VALUE OF LAND. 
‘‘Notwithstanding any other provision of 
law, any institution eligible to receive Fed-
eral funds under the Agricultural Research, 
Extension, and Education Reform Act of 1998 
(7 U.S.C. 7601 et seq.) shall be allowed to use 
the value of any land owned by the institu-
tion as an in-kind match to satisfy any cost 
sharing requirement under this Act.’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Mrs. DINGELL) and the gen-
tleman from Virginia (Mr. WITTMAN) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Michigan. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Michigan? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 
3051, America’s Conservation Enhance-
ment Act. 
This bill is an example of Democrats 
and Republicans coming together to 
pass legislation to benefit nature, fish-
ermen, hunters, and nature enthusiasts 
of all kinds. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank and commend 
my colleagues from both sides of the 
aisle and the Hill for their hard work 
on this very important piece of legisla-
tion. 
I am greatly appreciative of Rep-
resentative MIKE
THOMPSON
for his 
leadership in the House and for Sen-
ators BARRASSO and CARPER for getting 
this package through the Senate. 
Mr. Speaker, I also commend the nu-
merous bipartisan Members of Con-
gress for their critical contributions to 
this legislation. 
The ACE Act could not come at a 
more necessary time, as we are reck-
oning with the tragic and dangerous 
impacts of the climate crisis. Sci-
entists around the world are sounding 
the alarm that we are on the cusp of an 
extinction crisis caused by human im-
pacts. The ACE Act protects and en-
hances wildlife and habitat throughout 
the country, and reduces conflicts be-
tween wildlife, humans, and livestock. 
According to the Intergovernmental 
Science-Policy Platform on Biodiver-
sity and Ecosystem Services, three- 
quarters of the terrestrial environment 
and about two-thirds of the marine en-
vironment have been significantly al-
tered by human actions. 
Protecting habitat is one of the most 
important things we can do for bio-
diversity and climate resiliency, and 
this bill accomplishes that in several 
ways. 
It conserves wetlands by reauthor-
izing the popular and successful North 
American Wetlands Conservation Act. 
It protects the largest estuary in the 
country, the Chesapeake Bay, by cre-
ating and reauthorizing several pro-
grams that restore the Bay and pro-
mote its resilience to climate change. 
It also authorizes an innovative pro-
gram called the National Fish Habitat 
Partnership, which leverages public- 
private partnerships to enhance fish 
habitat across the country, benefiting 
not only the fish, but the strong tradi-
tion of angling in this country. 
Hunters, who are some of our best 
conservationists in this country, will 
be pleased to hear that this legislation 
contains provisions to combat chronic 
wasting disease, or CWD, a fatal dis-
ease that impacts animals like deer, 
elk, and moose, and which is spreading 
and has now been found in 26 States 
across this country. 
Invasive species are also a growing 
threat to biodiversity throughout the 
United States, and they are managed 
by a multitude of agencies. Crucially, 
this bill addresses this issue by requir-
ing Federal agencies to consult with 
one another and with stakeholders 
when developing strategic plans for 
invasive species. 
The ACE Act also contains a bipar-
tisan provision that I worked on with 
my 
colleague, 
Congressman 
DON 
YOUNG, for a long-term reauthorization 
of the National Fish and Wildlife Foun-
dation. This strong, bipartisan pro-
gram has a track record of success, and 
will continue to play a vital role in 
safeguarding our environmental leg-
acy. 
Finally, the ACE Act addresses con-
flicts between wildlife, livestock, and 
humans. The legislation creates a prize 
competition to spur innovations that 
reduce conflicts between humans and 
predator species. It also addresses 
losses of livestock due to depredation 
by federally-protected species. 
With the ever-encroaching human 
footprint, there will inevitably be more 
conflicts between us and wildlife, and 
these provisions offer a responsible 
pathway forward. 
During the pandemic, so many Amer-
icans have found respite in nature. 
Whether you are a hiker, an angler, a 
hunter, a bird-watcher, or just a wild-
life enthusiast, it is so important that 
we protect the iconic wildlife and habi-
tat across our Nation. Particularly in 
the face of the climate crisis, the time 
to act is now. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes’’ on this legislation to pro-
tect species and habitat. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong 
support of S. 3051, America’s Conserva-
tion Enhancement Act. 
It is an incredible honor to manage 
this suspension debate for the ACE 
Act, arguably one of the most impor-
tant pieces of environmental legisla-
tion for the Chesapeake Bay, national 
wetlands, and fish habitat in years. 
This bipartisan package of conserva-
tion and resource protection policies 
will have tremendous benefits for both 
our environment and individuals for 
years to come. 
The ACE Act is a once-in-a-genera-
tion advancement to clean up the 
Chesapeake Bay and protect and con-
serve natural resources across Amer-
ica. The Chesapeake Bay is a national 
treasure, and the ACE Act provides ad-
ditional resources and extends critical 
conservation programs that preserve 
wetlands, reduce pollution, and in-
crease recreational opportunities both 
in the Commonwealth of Virginia and 
across our great United States.

October 1, 2020 
the North American Wetlands Con-
servation Act, the National Fish and 
Wildlife 
Foundation 
Establishment 
Act, the Chesapeake Bay Program, the 
Chesapeake Bay Initiative Act of 1998. 
These are all very important pro-
grams, not only to the folks back home 
in my district, but to all Americans 
who wish to have clean air to breathe, 
clean water to drink, and an overall 
healthier environment where our fish 
and wildlife populations are sustain-
able and thriving. 
This bill also includes initiatives im-
portant to sportsmen, such as the es-
tablishment of a chronic wasting dis-
ease task force with the goal of re-
searching this dangerous threat to 
white-tailed deer, mule deer, elk popu-
lations, and moose populations. 
This bill also has some practical so-
lutions to offer farmers and ranchers 
vital tools to help manage their herds 
and protect them from predation. 
Title II is a provision I am especially 
proud of and glad that we are advanc-
ing through the House and on to the 
President’s desk for his signature. This 
includes the National Fish Habitat 
Conservation 
Through 
Partnerships 
provision, a bill that I championed. 
This title establishes a national fish 
habitat board that supports a success-
ful public-private partnership to re-
store fish habitat. 
I would like to thank the ranking 
member of the Natural Resources Com-
mittee, ROB BISHOP, and the ranking 
member 
of 
the 
Subcommittee 
on 
Water, 
Oceans, 
and 
Wildlife, 
TOM 
MCCLINTOCK. 
I would also like to thank all of my 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
for their ceaseless efforts and commit-
ment to making sure we do everything 
we can to conserve, protect, and en-
hance the resources that we are in 
charge of taking care of. 
I look forward to continuing to ad-
vance other important provisions, but 
this bill, hopefully, will be on its way 
to the President’s desk. 
As co-chair of the Chesapeake Bay 
Watershed Task Force, I would specifi-
cally like to acknowledge my friends 
and colleagues in the bay delegation 
who have labored so hard for so long to 
help clean up our great Chesapeake 
Bay. 
Representative BOBBY
SCOTT, Rep-
resentative JOHN SARBANES, and Rep-
resentative ANDY
HARRIS
and I are 
proud to see the passage of these im-
portant 
provisions 
to 
protect 
the 
Chesapeake Bay. 
Mr. Speaker, the American Conserva-
tion Enhancement Act does much to 
advance our bipartisan goals of con-
serving fish and wildlife populations 
and preserving the environment for the 
enjoyment of untold future generations 
of Americans. 
The ACE Act will also give Ameri-
cans increased opportunities to get out 
and enjoy the natural beauty and wild-
life in our country, from the Gulf Coast 
to the Great Lakes, from Puget Sound 
to the Chesapeake Bay. 
I urge adoption of the measure, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Virginia (Mrs. LURIA). 
Mrs. LURIA. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of America’s Con-
servation Enhancement Act and the in-
clusion of my bill, the Chesapeake Bay 
Program Reauthorization Act. 
As my colleague, Mrs. DINGELL, said, 
this is truly an example of a bipartisan 
bill where we have been able to work 
across the aisle and across the bay, and 
I would like to thank my colleague, 
Mr. WITTMAN from Virginia, as well for 
his strong cooperation on this pro-
gram. 
The Chesapeake Bay is a national 
treasure, and its health is critical to 
the environmental and economic well- 
being of coastal Virginia and beyond. 
The Chesapeake Bay generates $33 bil-
lion in economic value annually and is 
home to spectacular natural beauty 
and ecological diversity. 
The EPA’s Chesapeake Bay Program 
coordinates regional conservation ef-
forts and supports the work of States 
in meeting their restoration commit-
ments under the Chesapeake Bay Wa-
tershed Agreement. Funding for the 
bay program goes directly to localities 
to improve conservation efforts. How-
ever, Congress has not reauthorized 
this program since 2005. 
By passing the ACE Act and, simul-
taneously, my bill, Congress will reaf-
firm that all States in the watershed 
and the EPA must work together to 
achieve these restoration goals. This 
includes ensuring that all States have 
plans in place enabling them to achieve 
these goals. 
I want to thank my colleagues in the 
House and the Senate who worked hard 
to secure the passage of this bill. 
Again, I would like to thank Mr. 
WITTMAN, my colleague, Congressman 
BOBBY SCOTT from Virginia, as well as 
Mr. SARBANES from Maryland for being 
initial cosponsors on this bill. I urge 
all Members to support America’s Con-
servation Enhancement Act. 
Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I would like to reflect upon the words 
of Representative LURIA. This really is 
a true bipartisan bill. 
I would like to thank not just the 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
but those colleagues from all of our 
States, Representative LURIA, the rest 
of the Virginia delegation. As I talked 
about the folks from the Chesapeake 
Bay delegation, everybody has an in-
terest in this bill. It is an extraor-
dinary effort across many, many dif-
ferent areas where there is common in-
terest, and it is a great example of 
what we can get done when we are will-
ing to focus on things we have in com-
mon rather than those places where we 
have differences. 
The one thing we do have in common 
is the great treasures that have been 
bestowed upon us by our Creator and 
our obligation, as humanity, to protect 
and to enhance those resources, not 
only now, but for generations to come. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. SARBANES). 
Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of S. 3051, America’s 
Conservation Enhancement, or ACE, 
Act. 
I just want to thank Congressman 
WITTMAN for all his work. We partnered 
together, as he indicated, on the Chesa-
peake Bay Watershed Task Force with 
Congressman HARRIS and Congressman 
SCOTT. 
I want to salute the efforts of Con-
gresswoman LURIA in introducing and 
authoring the Chesapeake Bay Pro-
gram Reauthorization Act, which I was 
proud to cosponsor. 
This is an exciting day. This bill has 
taken a winding road, as these things 
do. But we are close to the finish line 
here, and we look forward to passage of 
the bill. It is bipartisan. It is bi-
cameral. 
We conserve and protect fish and 
wildlife habitat, support outdoor recre-
ation, and combat invasive species, as 
we have heard. It includes several bi-
partisan provisions that will protect 
the long-term health of the Chesapeake 
Bay, specifically, as I indicated, two 
bills: one, the Chesapeake Bay Pro-
gram Reauthorization Act, and another 
one, the Chesapeake Watershed Invest-
ments for Landscape Defense Act, or 
Chesapeake WILD Act, which would es-
tablish a grant program to bolster 
habitat 
restoration 
and 
protection 
throughout the watershed. 
It also includes a bill I was proud to 
introduce, the Chesapeake Bay Gate-
ways and Watertrails Network Reau-
thorization Act, which would expand 
recreational opportunities for millions 
of Marylanders and bay watershed resi-
dents across the region. 
It is comprehensive. It will signifi-
cantly boost the health of the bay and 
ensure that it remains an environ-
mental treasure and an economic driv-
er for years to come. 
As Congressman WITTMAN said, we 
have worked together on the Chesa-
peake Bay Watershed Task Force, and 
through that task force, we have pulled 
together real bipartisan support for 
this effort. 
As the largest estuary in the U.S., 
the Chesapeake Bay is an important 
ecosystem, a model for restoration ef-
forts throughout the country. That is, 
in large part, due to our successful bi-
partisan work at the Federal, State, 
and local levels. 
I would like to thank Chair GRI-
JALVA, our House leadership, and their 
staffs for their work to negotiate a bi-
partisan and bicameral environmental 
conservation package. 
I urge my colleagues to vote in favor 
of this important legislation so that 
our Nation’s natural habitats and sce-
nic landscapes, like the Chesapeake 
Bay, can be enjoyed for generations to

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5175 
October 1, 2020 
Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from South 
Carolina (Mr. CUNNINGHAM). 
Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Mr. Speaker, 
when I came to Washington, I promised 
that I would help to champion legisla-
tion that would make this planet a bet-
ter place for future generations, and 
that is why I am proud the ACE Act 
will be signed into law. 
The ACE Act is a bipartisan sports-
men’s package that ensures that we 
leave this planet in better shape than 
we found it. 
The ACE Act serves as a thank-you 
to the outdoor enthusiasts of South 
Carolina’s First District, and the mil-
lions like them across the United 
States, by providing reauthorizations 
for vital conservation programs. The 
Lowcountry’s hunters and anglers are 
some of the strongest stewards of our 
natural resources, and this bill is a 
promise that this partnership will con-
tinue for generations. 
I want to thank Representative MIKE 
THOMPSON for his leadership. I look for-
ward to working with my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle to get the ACE 
Act past the House and signed into law. 
Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time, and I 
will close quickly. 
I would like to thank my colleague, 
Representative DINGELL, for all of her 
efforts. 
Obviously, the Natural Resources 
Committee has a lot of input on this. 
But, again, this is a great example of 
what we can all do when we look at 
those things that we have in common. 
We have been bestowed these fan-
tastic natural resources, gifts from our 
Creator. We have an obligation to pro-
tect them. And what we see today is 
that common idea of that obligation 
and how we fulfill that obligation. 
Today really is one of those days where 
we should remember historically about 
all the different elements that have 
come together. 
We know it is an arduous path for 
many of these pieces of legislation, but 
today should really be a reminder of 
what we can do when we look at those 
things we have in common, when we 
look at our responsibilities and obliga-
tions to this Nation and to the treas-
ures that we have here before us. 
Today is indeed a great day. I urge 
my colleagues to support this bill. It 
truly is an indication of what makes 
this Nation great. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
The ACE Act is the culmination of 
months of bipartisan work between the 
House, the Senate, committee staff, 
and key stakeholders. 
I want to thank my colleague, Mr. 
WITTMAN, who is managing this bill 
today, and all of my colleagues on the 
Natural Resources Committee. But so 
many people have worked to get us 
here, and for me, it is almost a special 
moment because decades of work have 
resulted—today is the opening of the 
Detroit International Wildlife Refuge, 
which will benefit from this legisla-
tion. It makes me kind of emotional 
today. 
This passage will authorize critical 
funding for America’s fish and wildlife 
habitat. It is an example of what hap-
pens when we all come together to pro-
tect our natural resources. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
legislation, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today as a co-chair of the Chesapeake Water-
shed Task Force in support of the Chesa-
peake Bay Provisions within America’s Con-
servation Enhancement Act. I am proud to 
represent Virginia’s 3rd Congressional District, 
located near the mouth of the Chesapeake 
Bay which President Reagan declared a ‘‘na-
tional treasure’’ in 1984, a declaration Presi-
dent Obama echoed in 2009. Unfortunately, 
President Trump has not supported the bipar-
tisan effort to restore the Bay, proposing to 
slash funding for the Chesapeake Bay Pro-
gram, a misguided step that I am proud to 
have worked with my colleagues across the 
aisle to correct. 
America’s Conservation Enhancement Act 
represents a crucial opportunity to support the 
ongoing restoration of the Chesapeake Bay. 
Under the Environmental Protection Agency’s 
Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) mandate, 
some progress has been made in restoring 
the Bay. Current increases in underwater 
grasses and the blue crab population indicate 
these efforts are working, however, more re-
sources and continued partnership are nec-
essary to ensure that these gains are main-
tained and that the Chesapeake Bay is re-
stored. The Chesapeake Bay provisions in-
cluded in this bill would make significant 
progress, not just in improving the health of 
the Bay, but also in conserving habitat and in-
creasing access to restoration throughout its 
64,000 square-mile watershed. 
I am especially pleased the America’s Con-
servation Enhancement Act includes Chesa-
peake WILD, a bill I introduced with Reps. 
WITTMAN and SARBANES, fellow co-chairs of 
the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Taskforce, 
and Senator VAN HOLLEN. The Fish and Wild-
life Service (FWS) is well equipped to lever-
age their expertise in wildlife and habitat con-
servation beyond their reserves and through-
out the Chesapeake Bay Watershed. My bill 
fosters such partnerships by creating a grant 
program for on the ground restoration efforts 
to be carried out by the FWS. In addition to 
conserving fish and wildlife habitat; increasing 
access to recreation; mitigating flooding; and 
improving drinking water quality, the grant pro-
gram this bill creates will also contribute to the 
precedent-setting 
effort 
to 
conserve 
the 
Chesapeake Bay. 
America’s Conservation Enhancement Act 
also includes a bill led by Rep. SARBANES and 
Sen. CARDIN
that would reauthorize the 
Chesapeake Bay Gateways and Watertrails 
grant program. The pandemic has reminded 
many of the many benefits of outdoor recre-
ation yet, for far too many, parks, trails, 
beaches, and other recreational areas are 
largely inaccessible. The reauthorization of 
this grant program will help remedy that by in-
creasing access to recreation in the Bay Wa-
tershed and I am proud to be an original co-
sponsor of the bill. 
America’s Conservation Enhancement Act 
also includes critical legislation, led by my col-
leagues Rep. LURIA and Sen. CARDIN, to reau-
thorize the Chesapeake Bay Program. In 
1978, my first year as a member of the Vir-
ginia House of Delegates, I was part of a joint 
Virginia-Maryland legislative advisory commis-
sion focused on determining what actions 
were necessary to address Bay issues. We 
concluded that restoring the Bay would require 
more than just Virginia and Maryland, but rath-
er, the collaboration of the entire watershed. 
That remains true today and the level of col-
laboration required is made possible by the 
Chesapeake Bay Program. 
I am also proud to have introduced this leg-
islation with my colleagues which would also 
authorize an incremental increase in spending 
for the Bay Program, reaching $92 million an-
nually by 2025. Strong funding for the Bay 
Program leading up to 2025 is essential be-
cause that is the date by which the EPA, 
along with the six Bay watershed states and 
the District of Columbia have committed to 
making the Bay fishable and swimmable. 
Passage of America’s Conservation En-
hancement Act is a major step towards meet-
ing that agreement. As critical as these meas-
ures are to the ecological and economic 
health of the region, we also recognize that 
pollution knows no boundaries. As Wendell 
Berry, the great poet, philosopher, and farmer 
wrote, we all ought to ‘‘do unto those down-
stream as you would have those upstream do 
unto you.’’ The restoration this bill supports 
throughout the Chesapeake Bay Watershed 
does more than just improve the health of the 
Bay—it enhances carbon sequestration, pro-
tects wildlife, improves the quality of water en-
tering the Atlantic, and sets an important 
precedent for the restoration of other large wa-
tersheds and multi-jurisdictional cooperative 
environmental agreements. 
I thank the Committee on Natural Re-
sources and the Committee on Energy and 
Commerce for their work on this essential leg-
islation and urge my colleagues to support it. 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise in support of this bill and thank the 
Chairman for his tireless dedication to our nat-
ural resources and to supporting efforts to get 
folks outside to enjoy our National treasures. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has made it clear 
just how desperately our communities need 
access to the outdoors for their emotional and 
physical well-being. 
The provisions included in America’s Con-
servation Enhancement Act will do just that by 
increasing access to public lands and reau-
thorizing wildlife conservation programs, so 
our hunters, anglers, and birdwatchers can 
continue doing what they love. 
The ACE Act will create more opportunities 
for the people in America to enjoy the out-
doors, while providing critical financial relief to 
the businesses around these public lands. 
This legislation is a win for our environment, 
our economy, and for our sportsmen and 
women who will be able to access these lands 
for generations to come. 
As a longtime outdoorsman, I am proud of 
this legislation and urge my colleagues to vote 
yes.

Michigan 
(Mrs. 
DINGELL) that the 
House suspend the rules and pass the 
bill, S. 3051. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
DIRECT ENHANCEMENT OF SNAP-
PER 
CONSERVATION 
AND 
THE 
ECONOMY THROUGH NOVEL DE-
VICES ACT OF 2020 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 5126) to require individuals fish-
ing for Gulf reef fish to use certain de-
scending devices, and for other pur-
poses, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 5126 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

hancement of Snapper Conservation and the 
Economy through Novel Devices Act of 2020’’ 
or the ‘‘DESCEND Act of 2020’’. 
SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
It is the sense of Congress that commercial 
and recreational fishermen (which, for the 
purpose of this Act shall include charter 
fishing) for Gulf reef fish are expected to use 
a venting tool or a descending device re-
quired for possession under section 3 when 
releasing fish that are exhibiting signs of 
barotrauma. The Secretary of Commerce (re-
ferred to in this Act as the ‘‘Secretary’’), in 
coordination with the Gulf of Mexico Fishery 
Management Council, should develop and 
disseminate to fishermen education and out-
reach materials related to proper use of 
venting tools and descending devices, and 
strongly encourage their use by commercial 
and recreational fishermen when releasing 
fish that are exhibiting signs of barotrauma. 
SEC. 3. REQUIRED POSSESSION OF DESCENDING 
DEVICES. 
(a) REQUIRED GEAR IN THE GULF REEF FISH 
FISHERY.—Title III of the Magnuson-Stevens 
Fishery Conservation and Management Act

when fishing for reef fish, like the 
prized red snapper, in the Gulf of Mex-
ico EEZ. 
In addition, the bill requires the De-
partment of Commerce to contract 
with the National Academy of Sciences 
for a report on discard mortality in 
Gulf reef fish fisheries. 
The bill also requires Commerce and 
the Gulf Fishery Management Council 
to develop guidance for reporting dis-
cards and associated mortality and to 
develop a plan to assess the effective-
ness and usage of barotrauma-reducing 
devices. 
b 1515 
The United States has some of the 
most sustainable fisheries in the world, 
but the issue of bycatch is still a very 
serious concern. Anglers sometimes 
catch fish that they don’t want or are 
allowed to keep, so they need to be re-
turned to the ocean. According to some 
estimates, global bycatch may amount 
to 10 percent of the world’s total catch. 
However, deepwater reef fish like 
snapper and grouper experience pres-
sure changes when they are brought to 
the surface. This can damage the fish’s 
swim bladder and even cause death, 
and it can also leave injured fish ex-
posed to predators at the surface. If the 
fish are just thrown back, it is very 
likely that they will die, which is both 
a waste and unhelpful for promoting 
healthy fish populations. 
Fishers can help reduce this mor-
tality by using a venting tool or a de-
scending device, which is inexpensive, 
and ease the pressure changes in these 
fish. Similar requirements exist in 
other parts of the country but have 
been held up in the Gulf. 
The DESCEND Act would get around 
the bureaucratic roadblock and imple-
ment this commonsense, proconserva-
tion practice. This bill offers a simple 
path forward for reducing the mor-
tality of some of the most prized reef 
fish in this country, which will serve to 
create the more sustainable, profitable, 
and enjoyable fisheries for anglers in 
this Nation. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. 
GRAVES 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
I thank my friend from Michigan, 
and I want to thank Chairman GRI-
JALVA and Ranking Member BISHOP for 
their work on this legislation, the DE-
SCEND Act. 
Mr. Speaker, years ago, the Federal 
Government tried to tell our commu-
nities—all of us grew up fishing and, 
many, for sustenance and for recre-
ation. It is our outdoors. The Federal 
Government told us that we would only 
get 3 to 9 days to fish for red snapper. 
Mr. Speaker, when I was a kid, we did 
it year-round. That is our recreation. 
As much as I would love to have them, 
we don’t have mountains and the other 
recreational 
opportunities 
that 
go 
along with those types of elevation 
changes. 
I will say it again: Fishing is our out-
doors. It is what we do at home, and 
that was being taken away from us. 
Congressman HUFFMAN
from Cali-
fornia and I will tell you, Mr. Speaker, 
we totally disagreed on the solution 
there. He and I butted heads for years 
trying to work through a solution. On 
this bill, my most-of-the-time friend 
Mr. HUFFMAN and I are in lockstep. We 
are joined as cosponsors on this bill 
and are moving this one together be-
cause we believe this is the right solu-
tion, as you heard Mrs. DINGELL just 
explain. 
What happens is that we do have a 
season on red snapper. You can only 
fish for a certain number of days a 
year, yet you can’t tell which fish is 
going to bite your line when it is down 
under the water. 
Red snapper spend the majority of 
their life at 100 feet or below. They 
have a swim bladder, as was explained, 
that operates somewhat like a ballast 
and allows them to stay at certain 
depths. When they are caught and 
reeled in, they are brought up too fast. 
The ballast does not exhaust, and, 
therefore, you have a fish that cannot 
go back down. 
They have technologies, Mr. Speaker, 
as simple as ones like this, a descend-
ing device like this, where you can re-
lease the fish back down at the proper 
depth. They have venting tools that 
look like a fortified straw that also can 
help release the pressure. They are 
very easy tools to use. 
Mr. Speaker, we are talking about 21⁄2 
million fish every 5 years that are dis-
carded or lost. If we are having con-
flicts between recreational and com-
mercial fishers in terms of the access 
to the fisheries, the pounds, the days, 
and we are discarding 21⁄2 million fish 
every 5 years, it is a huge opportunity 
for us to actually grow the pie, and, as 
my friend from Michigan (Mrs. DIN-
GELL) stated, to actually ensure the 
sustainability of these fisheries not 
just for us, but for our children and 
grandchildren for generations to come. 
It is a better management tool, and it 
is successfully used in other areas. 
This legislation would provide for the 
use of descending and venting tools as 
well as freeing up additional research 
dollars associated with red snapper and 
descending tool use and the further 
management of the fisheries. 
So I want to thank, again, Chairman 
GRIJALVA and Ranking Member BISHOP 
for their work. I want to thank Bill 
Ball, Christine Sur, Lora Snyder, and 
all the staff that did a great job work-
ing on this, as well as Dustin Davidson 
in our office. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no further requests for time, and I 
would inquire whether my colleague 
has any remaining speakers. 
Mr. 
GRAVES 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. CARTER). 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues 
for allowing me the time to speak on 
an issue that is important to my dis-
trict and something I want other parts 
of the country to benefit from as well. 
As you can see, Mr. Speaker, I know 
a thing or two about fishing. In fact, 
Mr. Speaker, it has been said that fish 
tremble at the mention of my name. 
Mr. Speaker, it has been said that, if 
you put me in water, I will catch fish. 
This is a red snapper. This is a red 
snapper. It was not caught on the Gulf 
Coast; it was caught on the Atlantic 
Coast. You see, Mr. Speaker, I rep-
resent the best district in the Nation, 
the entire coast of Georgia, and this 
was caught off the coast of Georgia. 
But in our district fishing, is not just 
a hobby, it is a way of life. In fact, it 
is an essential part of coastal econo-
mies. That is why it is critical that we 
maintain and manage our fisheries in a 
sustainable way. 
This bill that we are discussing 
today, the DESCEND Act, would help 
do just that by expanding mandatory 
use of descending devices in the Gulf of 
Mexico when fishing for popular reef 
fish. We use these devices on the Atlan-
tic Coast now. In fact, I have used 
them before when I have fished. 
Reef fish, like red snapper that you 
see here, are very popular fish to fish 
for, but they are mostly caught, as was 
pointed out earlier, near the bottom of 
the ocean, and often they must be re-
leased because they are out of season 
or because of size restrictions. 
Unfortunately, though, when they 
are reeled to the surface, as Represent-
ative GRAVES so accurately described, 
when they are reeled to the surface, 
the decreased water pressure on the 
fish’s internal organs allow for gases to 
expands faster than their bodies can 
compensate. This makes it nearly im-
possible for the fish to return to the 
bottom, where their organs can func-
tion normally, resulting in the death of 
the fish that are caught and released. 
Descending devices like was shown 
earlier by Representative GRAVES fix 
this issue by releasing the fish into 
depths sufficient enough for the fish to 
be able to recover from these damaging 
effects. This is an effective conserva-
tion practice supported by fishermen 
and regulators alike, and it has been 
successful in places like my district 
along the coast of Georgia in the south 
Atlantic and the West Coast. 
I support this effort to bring this to 
the Gulf Coast, and I urge my col-
leagues to as well. It is a simple and ef-
fective approach to improve the sur-
vival of fish that are caught and re-
leased that will help maintain healthy 
populations going forward. 
Mr. Speaker, we want to help our 
partners in the Gulf Coast so that per-
haps, possibly, they could catch a fish 
this big, and certainly that is the in-
tent, and this will certainly help them. 
Mrs. DINGELL. I am prepared to 
close if the gentleman is, Mr. Speaker. 
Mr. 
GRAVES 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time.

October 1, 2020 
I want to thank my friend from Geor-
gia. I appreciate him bringing that 
cute little picture of the fish for us to 
see the size. Of course, that fish was ac-
tually born in Louisiana and swam 
over there. 
I did notice, Mr. Speaker, in the pic-
ture, my friend from Georgia appeared 
to be more slim than he is today, and 
so my explanation earlier of the swim 
bladder, perhaps my friend from Geor-
gia’s swim bladder is a little elevated 
right now from not being able to go to 
the gym. 
In any case, Mr. Speaker, I do seri-
ously want to thank my friend from 
Georgia, all the Republicans and Demo-
crats, and Mr. WITTMAN from Virginia, 
everyone, for coming together and 
working on this legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
a 
letter 
from 
the 
American 
Sportfishing Association, Angler Ac-
tion Association, BoatUS, Center for 
Sportfishing Policy, Coastal Conserva-
tion Association, Congressional Sports-
men’s Foundation, Guy Harvey Ocean 
Foundation, International Game Fish 
Association, Marine Retailers Associa-
tion of the Americas, National Marine

Roosevelt Conservation Partnership, 
and Wild Oceans that expresses support 
for the legislation. 
SEPTEMBER 29, 2020. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. KEVIN MCCARTHY, 
Republican Leader of the House, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR
SPEAKER
PELOSI
AND
REPUBLICAN 
LEADER MCCARTHY: On behalf of the nation’s 
recreational fishing and boating community, 
thank you for bringing H.R. 5126, Direct En-
hancement of Snapper Conservation and the 
Economy through Novel Devices Act of 2020 
(DESCEND Act), to the floor of the U.S. 
House of Representatives. The DESCEND 
Act unanimously passed the Committee on 
Natural Resources on March 11. We urge 
final passage of this bill sponsored by Con-
gressmen GARRET GRAVES (R–La.) and JARED 
HUFFMAN (D–Calif.) and thank them for their 
leadership in support of Gulf of Mexico reef 
fish conservation. 
The Gulf of Mexico’s recreational fisheries 
contribute $13.5 billion to the economy annu-
ally and support 138,817 jobs. The region’s 
recreational fishing community is comprised 
of 2.6 million saltwater anglers and thou-
sands of fishing-dependent businesses who 
strongly support healthy marine resources. 
Part of this commitment to conservation in-
cludes minimizing bycatch and maximizing 
survival of released fish to ensure the health 
of our fisheries for generations to come. 
Red snapper and other reef fish are often 
thrown overboard for a variety of reasons 
(e.g., being caught out of season or under-
sized). Due to the rapid change in pressure 
from being brought to the surface from depth 
many of these fish cannot swim back down 
and end up dying at the surface. As a result, 
hundreds of thousands of Gulf red snapper 
are wasted each year. This is an economic 
and conservation travesty. Unfortunately, a 
bureaucratic roadblock related to an impor-
tant oil spill recovery-funded project has 
prevented regulation from moving forward at 
the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management 
Council that would address this problem. 
For fisheries as important and valuable as 
Gulf reef fish, we should be doing everything 
we can to conserve these fish stocks. By re-
quiring reef fish fishermen in the Gulf of 
Mexico to possess devices that help fish 
avoid the fatal effects of barotrauma, and by 
clarifying that oil spill recovery funds can be 
used for related projects, the DESCEND Act 
would be a tremendous step toward reducing 
wasteful discard mortality and ensuring the 
sustainability of the iconic Gulf red snapper 
and other reef fish. Furthermore, it would 
align Gulf regulations with several West 
Coast states and South Atlantic federal 
waters where descending devices are required 
on board. 
We are grateful for the many victories dur-
ing this Congress benefiting natural resource 
conservation, and we hope you will add to 
that legacy by passing the science-based con-
servation measures included in the DE-
SCEND Act. 
Sincerely, 
American Sportfishing Association, Angler 
Action Foundation, BoatU.S., Center for 
Sportfishing Policy, Coastal Conservation 
Association, 
Congressional 
Sportsmen’s 
Foundation. 
Guy Harvey Ocean Foundation, Inter-
national Game Fish Association, Marine Re-
tailers Association of the Americas, National 
Marine Manufacturers Association, Theodore 
Roosevelt Conservation Partnership, Wild 
Oceans. 
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Lastly, 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank a number 
of people who were really instrumental 
in helping us to strike this bipartisan 
balance: Mike Leonard with the Amer-
ican Sportfishing Association; Cmac, 
with the Theodore Roosevelt Conserva-
tion Partnership; David Cresson and 
Rad Trascher with the Coastal Con-
servation Association; and Jeff Angers 
with the Center for Sportsfishing Pol-
icy. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the 
legislation, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
I want to thank my colleague, Mr. 
GRAVES, for all of the work that he has 
done. 
There was a lot of discussion that we 
had in committee on snapper. I want to 
thank both of my Republican col-
leagues and suggest that we go fishing, 
because there was a trip with several 
colleagues here who all thought I 
would catch nothing, and I caught 
more than they all caught together, so 
I think we need a bipartisan fishing 
trip. 
Having said that, Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to thank all of, again, the 
leadership of the Natural Resources 
Committee, the sportsmen’s groups, 
and everybody who worked on this to 
try to find consensus on something 
that does matter. 
The DESCEND Act will help safe-
guard our reef ecosystems and help 
eliminate bycatch in a sustainable 
way. 
I thank my colleagues for the good 
work. Some of it got tense. I also want 
to thank Representative HUFFMAN for 
his work on the bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this legislation, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. 
DINGELL) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5126, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Mrs. DINGELL) and the gen-
tleman from Virginia (Mr. WITTMAN) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Michigan. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Michigan? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of H.R. 5068, the Women Who Worked 
on the Home Front World War II Me-
morial Act, introduced by Representa-
tive ELEANOR
HOLMES
NORTON. H.R. 
5068 would authorize the establishment 
of a memorial to commemorate the 
nearly 19 million women who worked 
on the home front during World War II. 
With mass male enlistment leaving 
significant vacancies in the industrial 
and defense industries, women across 
the country filled thousands of jobs 
that were historically held by men to 
support the war effort and to keep 
America running. 
I am proud of the fact that my dis-
trict is home to Rosie the Riveters, 
which were a good example of women 
being able to do it. 
As the men fought abroad, these 
women worked in defense plants, flew 
military aircraft, delivered mail, and 
performed countless other duties nec-
essary to keep the home front running. 
In addition to the women working on 
the home front, nearly 350,000 women 
served in uniform, both at home and 
abroad, directly supporting the war ef-
fort as code breakers, as Air Force 
service pilots, and as volunteers for or-
ganizations such as the Army Nurse 
Corps. 
The work carried out by women on 
the home front during World War II 
opened the door for women to hold 
more types of jobs than ever before, 
and it is long past time that Congress 
recognized their contributions to our 
Nation. 
I would like to thank my colleague, 
Representative 
NORTON, 
for 
intro-
ducing this important legislation. I 
would also like to extend my gratitude 
to Ms. Raya Kenney, who developed the 
idea for this memorial when she was in 
fifth grade, for her tireless efforts to 
ensure that the millions of women who 
worked on the home front during World 
War II are recognized and celebrated. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 5068, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
b 1530 
Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of H.R. 5068, which would authorize the 
Women Who Worked on the Home 
Front Foundation to establish a com-
memorative work in Washington, D.C., 
to recognize the commitment and serv-
ice represented by women who worked 
on the home front during World War II. 
These 19 million American women 
stepped up to support their Nation dur-
ing America’s involvement in World 
War II. Women worked in a huge vari-
ety of critical professional roles, in-
cluding code breakers, aircraft testing 
pilots and trainers, welders, steam-
fitters, telegraph operators, radio and 
electrical engineers, crane operators, 
surveyors, assembly line workers, as 
they replaced men who were heading 
off to war. 
Some 300,000 Virginians served in 
uniform and more than 11,000 never re-
turned home. For many women, the 
war provided increased opportunities 
to serve their community, their Na-
tion, and to aid in the war effort. 
The work women did during World 
War II can never be fully measured, 
and their impact on our national wel-
fare for the decades that followed 
should forever be enshrined in our na-
tional story. 
The beneficial contribution women 
made during the war were felt locally 
here in Virginia, as well as across the 
Nation. 
For example, the Richmond Engi-
neering Company employed women 
welders who made bomb heads. At New-
port News shipyard, women worked as 
crane operators, electricians, mechan-
ics, and more, as critical members of 
the Defense production workforce. 
In recent years, Congress also has es-
tablished the Rosie the Riveter Na-
tional Historical Park in California to 
further highlight the work of these in-
credible patriots during the war. Au-
thorizing this commemorative work in 
our Nation’s capital is another fitting 
tribute to the brave, strong, multital-
ented, intelligent women who helped us 
win the war. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the 
measure, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
5 minutes to the gentlewoman from the 
District of Columbia. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my good friend for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Chair GRIJALVA 
for taking the Women Who Worked on 
the Home Front World War II Memo-
rial Act through committee and bring-
ing it to the floor. I appreciate that he 
allowed me to sit in and ask questions, 
and he conducted a hearing and pressed 
it forward quickly. 
Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan bill 
would authorize the establishment of a 
memorial on Federal land here in the 
District of Columbia commemorating 
the efforts of 18 million American 
women who kept the home front run-
ning during World War II. Women are 
dramatically underrepresented in our 
memorials. 
A 17-year-old constituent of mine, 
Raya Kenney, the founder of the 
Women Who Worked on the Home 
Front Foundation—yes, her own foun-
dation—came up with the idea to honor 
the women on the home front who sup-
ported the World War II effort. Raya 
wondered why the women on the home 
front, whose efforts were so instru-
mental in maintaining the stability of 
the country during World War II, have 
not received much recognition for their 
contributions compared to the men 
who fought bravely in World War II. 
This bill would authorize the Women 
Who Worked on the Home Front Foun-
dation to establish a memorial to 
honor these women. The memorial is 
designed to be interactive and to edu-
cate visitors on the important roles 
women played during World War II. No 
Federal funds would be required. 
Between 1940 and 1945, the percentage 
of women in the workforce increased 
from 27 percent to nearly 37 percent. 
And by 1945, one in four married 
women worked outside the home. The 
work done by women on the home front 
opened doors for women in the work-
place generally and had a profound ef-
fect on the job market going forward, 
and even up to today. 
As a result of their efforts, women on 
the home front redefined many occupa-
tions that were especially considered 
men’s work. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentle-
woman for yielding. 
Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no further speakers, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman 
and all the leadership on the Com-
mittee on Natural Resources, again, for 
making this a reality. I thank my col-
league, Ms. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON, 
for the work that she did. 
Mr. Speaker, as we are talking about 
this bill, several years ago with my 
then-Republican 
colleague, 
Candace 
Miller, we did the first honor flight of 
the Rosie the Riveters. We went to the 
World War II Memorial, and it was in-
credible. But to have a place to take 
them will be very special, and I hope 
we are able to do it while some of them 
can appreciate what we are doing. 
This bipartisan legislation will honor 
the 18 million American women who

played a key role in our Nation’s war 
effort during World War II through 
their efforts on the home front. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this legislation, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a co-
sponsor and a senior member of the House of 
Representatives, I rise in strong support of 
H.R. 5068, the ‘‘Women Who Worked on the 
Home Front World War II Memorial Act,’’ 
which would authorize the establishment of a 
memorial on federal land in the District of Co-
lumbia, commemorating the efforts of the 18 
million American women who kept the home 
front running during World War II. 
I would like to thank Congresswoman ELEA-
NOR HOLMES NORTON for introducing this im-
portant piece of legislation. 
It is no secret that women are dramatically 
underrepresented when it comes to our me-
morials. 
Despite being instrumental in maintaining 
the stability of the country during World War II, 
the women of World War II have not received 
much recognition for their contributions. 
This bill would change that by authorizing 
the Women Who Worked on the Home Front 
Foundation to establish a memorial to honor 
these women. 
The memorial is designed to be interactive 
and to educate visitors on the crucial roles 
women played during World War II. 
For instance, millions of American women 
took jobs to support their families and the 
country at large during World War II, forever 
redefining what ‘‘women’s work’’ looked like. 
In fact, more than 10,000 women served be-
hind 
the 
scenes 
of 
World 
War 
II 
as 
codebreakers. 
Women were also trained to fly military air-
craft so that male pilots could leave for com-
bat duty overseas. 
More than 1,100 female civilian volunteers 
flew nearly every type of military aircraft as 
part of the Women Airforce Service Pilots 
(WASP) program. 
WASPs flew planes from factories to bases, 
transported cargo and participated in simula-
tion strafing and target missions. 
Between 1940 and 1945, the percentage of 
women in the workforce increased from 27 
percent to nearly 37 percent, and, by 1945, 
one in four married women worked outside of 
the home. 
The work done by women on the home front 
had a profound effect on the job market going 
forward. 
As the nation continues to mourn the loss of 
the ‘Notorious RBG’, an unmatched constitu-
tional scholar and Supreme Court Justice who 
irrevocably advanced the women’s movement, 
I can think of no better way to honor her leg-
acy than by voting for this bill to commemo-
rate the women whose sacrifices and deci-
sions to enter the workforce during World War 
II also helped to change perceptions about 
gender roles in society. 
We, as Members of Congress, have a duty 
to recognize and celebrate these revolutionary 
patriots for their service to this country. 
As a proud leader of this bill, I encourage 
my fellow colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 
5068. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. 
DINGELL) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5068, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Michigan? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 
3758, which addresses two issues regard-
ing Bureau of Reclamation water and 
power management. 
First, the bill amends Klamath Basin 
Water Supply Enhancement Act of 2000 
to support water conservation and effi-
ciency measures in the Klamath Basin. 
This bill provides additional authoriza-
tion for Reclamation to work with 
Klamath Basin irrigators on activities 
that align water supplies and demand. 
Further, this legislation would ex-
tend the use of drought relief funding 
to certain conservation measures, land 
idling, and groundwater uses. 
Second, the bill also carries provi-
sions to make two irrigation districts 
in eastern Montana eligible to continue 
to receive project use power rates from 
the Bureau of Reclamation. 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the efforts 
from Senators MERKLEY and WYDEN to 
advance this bill, and I urge my col-
leagues to support its adoption. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in reluctant sup-
port of S. 3758. While this bill makes 
important technical corrections that 
will provide relief to the Klamath 
Basin irrigators which have been hard 
hit by drought, it also includes a provi-
sion that perpetuates a 75-year mis-
take. 
In 1946, the Bureau of Reclamation 
entered into contracts with two irriga-
tion entities in Montana to provide 
project use power, better known as 
PUP. 
Normally, these subsidized power 
rates are reserved for Federal projects. 
However, for reasons lost to history, 
these two entities—which are not part 
of any Federal project, and in fact, one 
is a private company—have been able 
to obtain and renew their project use 
power or PUP contracts.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5181 
October 1, 2020 
Recently, the Bureau of Reclamation 
realized it lacked the authority to pro-
vide these two entities PUP rates and 
has decided to let these contracts ex-
pire December 31, 2020. It is extremely 
concerning that it took the Bureau of 
Reclamation 75 years to realize it made 
a mistake, which makes this situation 
quite unique. This unfortunate mistake 
by bureaucrats left more than 130 fam-
ily farms in limbo, uncertain if they 
will be able to afford to maintain their 
farmland after January 1, 2021. 
While we are not opposing this fix 
today, the committee wants to be clear 
that this is a one-off, unique situation. 
We do not see this as a pathway or 
precedent for other irrigation districts 
to follow. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
two legal opinions from the Depart-
ment of the Interior, Office of the So-
licitor, which indicate that the depart-
ment did not have the legal authority 
to enter into PUP contracts with the 
two Pick-Sloan Missouri Basin Pro-
gram entities because there is no Fed-
eral nexus. 
U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, 
OFFICE OF THE SOLICITOR, 
Billings, MT, March 10, 2014. 
Memorandum 
To: Michael J. Ryan, Regional Director, Bu-
reau of Reclamation, Great Plains Re-
gion, 
Billings, 
Attn: 
GP–4100 
(Fern 
Thompson) 
From: Karan L. Dunnigan, Field Solicitor, 
Office of the Solicitor, Rocky Mountain 
Region (Billings) 
Subject: Authority to Enter Into a Pick- 
Sloan Missouri Basin Program (P–SMBP) 
Project Use Power (PUP) Contract with 
Kinsey Irrigation Company (Company) 
I. QUESTION 
In an October 31, 2013 memorandum, you 
asked: (1) whether the Bureau of Reclama-
tion (Reclamation) had or has the authority 
to enter into a PUP contract with the Com-
pany; (2) if not, whether Reclamation should 
continue to honor its current contract with 
the Company until the contract expires; and 
(3) if so, if Reclamation should approve the 
Company’s request for an increased contract 
rate of delivery. 
II. BRIEF ANSWER 
Reclamation does not and did not have the 
authority to enter into a PUP contract with 
the Company, because the United States has 
had no interest in the unit and there has 
been no federal nexus with the unit since the 
title transfer of the Kinsey facilities in the 
1940’s. Because Reclamation has no author-
ity to provide PUP to the Company, Rec-
lamation should seek to terminate the provi-
sion of PUP to Kinsey as soon as is practical. 
And any increased deliveries to the Company 
should not be at a PUP rate. 
III. BACKGROUND 
The Farm Security Administration con-
structed the Kinsey project in 1937. The 
project was referenced in Senate Document 
191, 78th Congress, 2nd Session, 1944, and thus 
appears to have been contemplated to be 
(and indeed was briefly) a P–SMBP unit. 
However, in 1945 the Company purchased the 
federally-owned 
Kinsey 
project 
facilities 
from the United States, rendering the Kinsey 
project entirely private. The Kinsey project 
has no other federal nexus. 
In 1946, Reclamation entered into a power 
contract with the Company, providing power 
at the PUP rate of 2.5 mills per kilowatt- 
hour. Reclamation’s regional office raised 
concerns about providing PUP power to a 
private district on several occasions, but for 
reasons lost to history, the Commissioner of 
Reclamation’s office instructed the region to 
continue providing PUP power to the dis-
trict, and at the original 2.5 mill rate. The 
contract has been renewed and extended over 
the years, and currently terminates on De-
cember 31, 2020. 
The Kinsey project does appear in the 1963 
‘‘Report on Financial Position, Missouri 
River Basin Project’’ (1963 Report) as a 
project entitled to PUP. 
IV. ANALYSIS 
Pursuant to Reclamation Law and Policy, 
PUP is available only where it has been spe-
cifically authorized by Congress and, unless 
Congress specifically provides otherwise, 
only to Reclamation projects. Here, while 
the Kinsey project was initially a federal 
project, and briefly an authorized unit of the 
P–SMBP, title transfer to the Company di-
vested the Kinsey project of its status as an 
authorized P–SMPB unit and rendered it en-
tirely private. Accordingly, the Company is 
not entitled to PUP. 
A. Project Pumping Power 
Authority to produce and supply PUP is 
implied in the Town Sites and Power Devel-
opment Act of 1906 (Act of April 16, 1906, ch. 
1631, 34 Stat. 116). PUP is further con-
templated under the Reclamation Project 
Act of 1939, at section 9(c), which provides 
that: 
Any sale of electric power . . . made by the 
Secretary in connection with the operation 
of any project or division of a project, shall 
be for such periods, not to exceed forty 
years, and at such rates as in his judgment 
will produce power revenues at least suffi-
cient to cover an appropriate share of the 
construction investment at not less than 3 
per center per annum . . . 
Thus, under the 1939 Act, PUP must also be 
‘‘in connection with the operation of any 
project or division of a project.’’ And under 
further Reclamation law and policy, PUP is 
only available to Reclamation projects for 
which PUP was explicitly authorized. The 
Reclamation Act of 1902 provides that ‘‘the 
title to and the management and operation 
of the reservoirs and the works necessary for 
their protection and operation shall remain 
in the Government until otherwise provided 
by Congress.’’ § 6. So, without further author-
ization from Congress, Reclamation projects 
must be owned by the United States. 
The Reclamation Manual at FAC 04–06 pro-
vides that ‘‘[p]roject use power is used to 
meet the electrical service requirements of a 
Reclamation project pursuant to congres-
sional authorization.’’ Further, the Reclama-
tion Manual defines Reclamation Project as 
‘‘those facilities or features of a project con-
structed/developed/or transferred to Rec-
lamation under the authority of Federal 
Reclamation law (or the Water Conservation 
and Utilization Act) for which ownership is 
retained by the United States, unless other-
wise authorized by Congress.’’ As with the 
1902 and 1939 Acts, under the Reclamation 
Manual project use power can only be pro-
vided to project facilities owned by the 
United States unless Congress authorizes 
otherwise. 
The Flood Control Act of 1944 authorized 
the P–SMBP. Subsection (a) of Section 9 of 
that Act approved the general comprehen-
sive plans set forth in H.D. 475 and S.D. 191, 
78th Congress 2nd Session. S.D. 191, at page 
22, provides: 
In the plan proposed, irrigation pumping 
with its incidental power requirements plays 
a large part. The cost of such power will be 
an important element in the irrigators’ an-
nual expenses, and must be low if success is 
to be achieved. Experience and study indi-
cate that the cost per kilowatt-hour should 
not exceed 21⁄2 mills for energy delivered to 
major project pumping plants. 
(The current PUP rate is of course much 
higher than the rate contemplated in 1944, 
but still a fraction of the market rate.) 
The Kinsey project was a federal irrigation 
project, transferred to Reclamation as a part 
of the Flood Control Act of 1944. Therefore, 
the Kinsey project was briefly a P-SMPB 
unit. However, the Kinsey project ceased to 
be a Reclamation project when the Company 
bought it two years later. Without specific 
Congressional authority, facilities trans-
ferred by title transfer are no longer able to 
receive PUP because they are no longer fed-
eral projects. 
B. The 1963 Report 
Although the 1963 Report indicates in its 
exhibits that the Kinsey project receives 
PUP, we interpret this inclusion as an over-
sight resulting from to the fact that the 
Kinsey project was initially a P–SMBP unit 
and had continued to receive PUP. 
Congress adopted the ‘‘1963 Report’’ by 
passing .the 1965 Garrison Diversion Unit 
legislation: 
In addition to reauthorizing the initial 
stage of the Garrison diversion unit, the ap-
proval of this legislation will indicate ac-
ceptance by the Congress of the Depart-
ment’s recommendations with respect to the 
overall financial position of the Missouri 
River Basin project. About 3 years ago, the 
committee requested the Department of the 
Interior to study ways and means of placing 
the Missouri River Basin project in a sound 
financial position and to report its findings 
and recommendations to the Congress. A 
‘‘sound financial position’’ was interpreted 
to mean that commercial power and munic-
ipal and industrial water investments would 
be repaid with interest in not to exceed 50 
years and that irrigation investments would 
be repaid within 50 years plus any authorized 
development period, including that portion 
to be repaid from power revenues. 
H.R. Rept. No. 282, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. 8 
(1965). Identical language appeared in the 
1964 report, H.R. Rept. No. 1606, 88th Cong., 
2d Sess. 8 (1964), and the Senate committee 
report contained a similar acknowledge-
ment, S. Rept. No. 470 (on S. 34). 89th Cong, 
1st Sess. 4 (1965). 
Thus, as with our recent memorandum on 
PUP at Frenchman-Cambridge Unit, we in-
terpret the presence or absence of a unit in 
the 1963 Report as evidence of Congress’s in-
tent for that unit. But even where the 
Kinsey project’s inclusion in the report is 
contrary evidence, it is not sufficient to indi-
cate clear Congressional intent to provide 
PUP to a project that is otherwise com-
pletely private and without a federal nexus . 
C. The Current Contract with the Company 
The provision of power to the Company at 
a PUP rate has never been authorized, so 
Reclamation should seek to raise the rate or 
terminate the current contract as soon as it 
is practical. The contract contains a ‘‘Modi-
fication of Rates’’ provision allowing for the 
United States to promulgate a new rate 
schedule for the contract (General Power 
Contract Provisions, T F). The provision sets 
forth the procedure by which the United 
States gives notice to the Company of a new 
rate schedule, and the Company has the op-
tion to terminate its contract instead of ac-
cepting the new rate. 
V. CONCLUSION 
Without clear Congressional intent to the 
contrary, privately owned facilities are not 
eligible to receive PUP. The Kinsey project 
was transferred to the Company in 1946, and 
has been private for 68 years. The project has

so as soon as it is practical.

Memorandum 
To: Michael J. Ryan, Regional Director, Bu-
reau of Reclamation Great Plains Re-
gion, Billings, Attn: GP-4100 (Margaret 
Ventling) 
From: Karen L. Dunnigan, Field Solicitor, 
Office of the Solicitor, Rocky Mountain 
Region (Billings) 
Subject: Authority to Enter Into a Pick- 
Sloan Missouri Basin Program (P–SMBP) 
Project Use Power (PUP) Contract with 
Sidney Water Users Irrigation District 
(Sidney) 
I. QUESTION 
In a November 9, 2017 memorandum, you 
asked if the Bureau of Reclamation (Rec-
lamation) is authorized to enter into a PUP 
contract with Sidney. 
II. BRIEF ANSWER 
Reclamation does not have and never had 
the authority to enter into a PUP contract 
with Sidney, because the United States 
never had an interest in Sidney’s project, 
there is no federal nexuswith Sidney, and no 
other authority exists to allow Reclamation 
to provide PUP to Sidney. This situation is 
similar to that of Kinsey Irrigation Com-
pany, addressed in our memorandum dated 
March 10, 2014, except that Kinsey was origi-
nally a Reclamation project. 
III. BACKGROUND 
The Sidney project was constructed by the 
State of Montana in 1938. Reclamation en-
tered into Contract No. L79R–449 with Sid-
ney’s predecessor-in-interest, the Montana 
State Water Conservation Board, on July 31, 
1946, for seasonal irrigation pumping power. 
Contract No. L79R–449 terminated and was 
replaced by Contract 14–06–600–9164 on May 
15, 1967. The latter contract was supple-
mented and extended, and ultimately was to 
expire on December 31, 2000. The State as-
signed the contract to Sidney on June 30, 
1997, and the Western Area Power Adminis-
tration extended the contract until Decem-
ber 31, 2020. 
IV. ANALYSIS 
Pursuant to Reclamation Law and Policy, 
PUP is available only where it has been spe-
cifically authorized by Congress and, unless 
Congress specifically provides otherwise, 
only to Reclamation projects. While the 
Kinsey project referenced above was initially 
a federal project, the Sidney project has 
never been federal or had a federal nexus. Ac-
cordingly, Sidney is not and never was enti-
tled to PUP. 
Authority to produce and supply PUP is 
implied in the Town Sites and Power Devel-
opment Act of 1906 (Act of April 16, 1906, ch. 
1631, 34 Stat. 116). PUP is further con-
templated under the Reclamation Project 
Act of 1939, at section 9(c), which provides 
that: 
Any sale of electric power . .
. made by 
the Secretary in connection with the oper-
ation of any project or division of a project, 
shall be for such periods, not to exceed forty 
years, and at such rates as in his judgment 
will produce power revenues at least suffi-
cient to cover an appropriate share of the 
construction investment at not less than 3 
per center per annum . . . 
Thus, under the 1939 Act, PUP must also be 
‘‘in connection with the operation of any 
project or division of a project.’’ And under 
further Reclamation law and policy, PUP is 
only available to Reclamation projects for 
which PUP was explicitly authorized. The 
Reclamation Act of 1902 provides that ‘‘the 
title to and the management and operation 
of the reservoirs and the works necessary for 
their protection and operation shall remain 
in the Government until otherwise provided 
by Congress.’’ § 6. So, without further author-
ization from Congress, Reclamation projects 
must be owned by the United States. 
The Reclamation Manual at FAC 04–06 pro-
vides that PUP ‘‘is used to meet the elec-
trical service requirements of a Reclamation 
project pursuant to congressional authoriza-
tion.’’ Further, the Reclamation Manual de-
fines a Reclamation project as ‘‘those facili-
ties or features of a project constructed/de-
veloped/or transferred to Reclamation under 
the authority of Federal Reclamation law (or 
the Water Conservation and Utilization Act) 
for which ownership is retained by the 
United States, unless otherwise authorized 
by Congress.’’ As with the 1902 and 1939 Acts, 
under the Reclamation Manual PUP can 
only be provided to project facilities owned 
by the United States unless Congress author-
izes otherwise. 
The Flood Control Act of 1944 authorized 
the P-SMBP. Subsection (a) of Section 9 of 
that Act approved the general comprehen-
sive plans set forth in H.D. 475 and S.D. 191, 
78th Congress 2nd Session. S.D. 191, at page 
22, provides: 
In the plan proposed, irrigation pumping 
with its incidental power requirements plays 
a large part. The cost of such power will be

cate that the cost per kilowatt-hour should 
not exceed 21⁄2 mills for energy delivered to 
major project pumping plants. 
(The current PUP rate is of course much 
higher than the rate contemplated in 1944, 
but still a fraction of the market rate.) 
Sidney was always a state project. and it is 
unclear why it was ever provided PUP. With-
out specific Congressional authority, non- 
federal projects are not eligible to receive 
PUP. 
V. CONCLUSION 
Without clear Congressional intent to the 
contrary, non-federal facilities are not eligi-
ble to receive PUP. Sidney is not and has 
never been federal, and has no federal nexus. 
Reclamation has no authority to provide 
power to Sidney at PUP rates. 
If you have any questions, please contact 
Bryan Wilson in this office. 
Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Oregon 
(Mr. WALDEN). 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my colleagues for bringing this legisla-
tion forward, and especially Chairman 
GRIJALVA and Ranking Member BISHOP. 
I also thank Oregon senators, MERKLEY 
and WYDEN, for their efforts on this, 
too. 
Irrigators in the Klamath Basin, 
which 
I 
represent, 
face 
another 
drought-stricken year. There have been 
a lot of things we have done to help 
them over time. I have been involved in 
these issues for more than 20 years 
now, and it is one of the most vexing 
water systems in the country when you 
try and parse it all together and make 
it all work, and couple that with Fed-
eral requirements and Tribal rights, 
and then get a drought year, we get in 
really bad shape. 
This year, I welcomed Secretary of 
Interior David Bernhardt and Bureau 
of Reclamation Commissioner Brenda 
Burman to the Klamath Basin. They 
got a firsthand look at what our farm-
ers were facing there. Secretary Bern-
hardt was the first Secretary of the In-
terior to visit the Klamath Basin in 
about 20 years, so we are really appre-
ciative that he took time personally to 
come out there. 
We are thankful to the Trump admin-
istration for listening to us. They have 
committed to provide funding to en-
sure we have the best science available 
to make better decisions by the Fed-
eral Government when it comes to the 
allocation of water. 
Today, in this legislation, we are pro-
viding yet another tool to help farm-
ers. This legislation will give the Bu-
reau of Reclamation the authority to 
spend $10 million each year over the 
next 4 years to implement measures in-
cluding 
groundwater 
pumping 
and 
water movement through the Bureau of 
Reclamation facilities. This is simply 
essential for the survival of irrigated 
agriculture in the Basin. 
Mr. Speaker, I look forward to con-
tinuing to work with Congress, the ad-
ministration, and local officials to find 
durable, lasting solutions for the farm-
ers, ranchers, fish, and Tribes in the 
Klamath Basin. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues 
for bringing this bill forward, and urge 
its passage. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no further requests for time, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I am 
prepared to close, and I yield myself 
such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I commend Congress-
man GREG WALDEN for his sponsorship 
of the House companion bill, H.R. 7116, 
that makes the needed noncontrover-
sial technical corrections to the Klam-
ath Basin Water Supply Act so that all 
the benefits can be accessed. 
Congressman GIANFORTE is also sup-
porting his constituents as the House 
sponsor of H.R. 3471, which mirrors 
Montana’s provisions that are con-
tained within S. 3758. 
Again, I thank all my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle who worked hard 
to resolve this issue so that folks in 
these regions can have certainty about 
the water that they so desperately 
need. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I, too, commend my col-
league, Mr. WALDEN, for his leadership 
and trying to bring this together with 
Mr. GIANFORTE and finding an answer. I 
am going to miss my friend deeply so 
he better stay engaged to make sure we 
do this right. 
I thank Mr. WITTMAN for working 
with him this afternoon on the passage 
of this and several other critical bills. 
And all the leadership of the Com-
mittee on Natural Resources. And, 
again, what happens when Republicans 
and Democrats work together, we can 
really get things done.

SEC. 14. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EF-
FECTS. 
The budgetary effects of this Act, for the 
purpose of complying with the Statutory 
Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be deter-
mined by reference to the latest statement 
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in 
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from Or-
egon (Mr. DEFAZIO) and the gentle-
woman from West Virginia (Mrs. MIL-
LER) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Oregon. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 5139, 
as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Oregon? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
5139, the Stop Sexual Assault and Har-
assment in Transportation Act, as 
amended. 
The number one goal in transpor-
tation of people, whether it is across 
town, across the ocean, in the air, on 
the ground, or on the sea, is that there 
should be comprehensive policies in 
place for those companies that are en-
trusted with their well-being. While it 
is estimated that 90 percent of U.S. 
companies have a sexual harassment 
policy on the books, one in five does 
not offer training to prevent such inci-
dents. This can leave passengers vul-
nerable and personnel unequipped to 
adequately 
address 
incidents 
when 
they occur. 
Some people may wonder whether 
this problem is as rampant as many 
may suggest and ask if there is enough 
robust, organized data out there that 
sheds light on this issue. Unfortu-
nately, I have to say no. That is ex-
actly the problem. 
There is no accumulated data. There 
is no Federal clearinghouse for trans-
portation-related sexual assault and 
harassment incidents. 
The lack of centralized data leaves 
the traveling public in the dark about 
the risk. But in reality, sexual assault 
and harassment constitute a growing 
problem in transportation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5187 
October 1, 2020 
For example, FBI investigations of 
in-flight sexual assaults in passenger 
airplanes rose from 38 in 2014 to 119 in 
2019. Those are only the ones that are 
reported. Many people don’t report. 
According to a 2018 national study, 17 
percent of all respondents experienced 
sexual harassment while using mass 
transportation. Since 2016, 260 sexual 
assaults aboard cruise ships have been 
reported to the DOT. It is by far the 
most frequently reported crime on 
cruise ships. 
In recent years, there may be no 
other industry that issue has plagued 
more 
than 
transportation 
network 
companies such as Uber and Lyft. 
In September 2019, 14 women sued 
Lyft, citing the company’s failure to 
address a sexual predator crisis among 
its drivers. Uber identified nearly 6,000 
sexual assaults and attempted sexual 
assaults on its platform in 2017 and 2018 
alone. 
Anecdotal evidence suggests that 
sexual assault is a big problem with 
transportation network companies and 
traditional taxis alike, but TNCs and 
taxi companies don’t share the data 
that would provide a complete picture 
of the problem. 
In my own hometown—I live in 
Springfield, Oregon, but in our urban 
area of Eugene-Springfield, we had one 
of the TNCs operating. All of their 
drivers had been through their inten-
sive background checks, which are 
laughable, but then the Eugene police 
insisted that they go through real 
background checks. They found 12 peo-
ple totally disqualified by the own 
standards of that company, Uber: one 
murderer, one rapist, and 10 serious fel-
ons. They were picking up women 
alone from bars at 1 o’clock in the 
morning, 
et 
cetera. 
The 
company 
didn’t know it. 
In 
fact, 
those 
companies 
have 
fought—we are the last State that isn’t 
bound by State law. They have been 
lobbying all the States to say you can’t 
keep track of this; you cannot require 
more vigorous background checks. Un-
fortunately, 49 of the States have caved 
in to them, under threat of losing their 
services. My State hasn’t. And, you 
know, this has to stop. 
That is why the Committee on Trans-
portation and Infrastructure passed my 
bill, H.R. 5139, the Stop Sexual Assault 
and Harassment in Transportation Act. 
This bill will: 
One, require transportation providers 
to establish formal policies addressing 
sexual assault and harassment; 
Two, direct employees to receive spe-
cific training for not just how to han-
dle sexual assault or harassment inci-
dents, but also how to recognize and re-
spond to potential human trafficking 
activities, something that has been 
identified numerous times by flight at-
tendants who have alerted authorities 
and other workers in transportation; 
and, 
Three, charge the DOT with estab-
lishing the first-ever Federal clearing-
house for transportation-related sexual 
assault, harassment, and child traf-
ficking, to allow the traveling public 
to fully understand the scope of the 
problem and spur further action. 
We can no longer allow sexual vio-
lence and abuse to persist on our roads, 
on our waters, or in our skies. We must 
be doing everything in our power to en-
sure our transportation system is safe 
for those who work in it and for every-
one who uses it. This bill, which will 
allow us to finally track, respond to, 
and ultimately prevent sexual assault 
and harassment within all areas of our 
transportation system, brings us one 
step closer to attaining that goal. 
I want to acknowledge and express 
my appreciation for the supporters of 
this bill. It has been endorsed by the 
American Association of Justice, the 
Association of Flight Attendants, the 
Air Line Pilots Association, the Asso-
ciation of Professional Flight Attend-
ants, the National Center on Sexual 
Exploitation, Rights4Girls, Survivors 
for Solutions, and the Transportation 
Trades Department. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
legislation, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY, 
Washington, DC, February 7, 2020. 
Hon. PETER DEFAZIO, 
Chairman, Committee on Transportation and 
Infrastructure, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN DEFAZIO: This is to advise 
you that the Committee on the Judiciary 
has now had an opportunity to review the 
provisions in H.R. 5139, the ‘‘Stop Sexual As-
sault and Harassment in Transportation 
Act,’’ that fall within our Rule X jurisdic-
tion. I appreciate your consulting with us on 
those provisions. The Judiciary Committee 
has no objection to your including them in 
the bill for consideration on the House floor, 
and to expedite that consideration is willing 
to forgo action on H.R. 5139, with the under-
standing that we do not thereby waive any 
future jurisdictional claim over those provi-
sions or their subject matters. 
In the event a House-Senate conference on 
this or similar legislation is convened, the 
Judiciary Committee reserves the right to 
request an appropriate number of conferees 
to address any concerns with these or simi-
lar provisions that may arise in conference. 
Please place this letter into the Congres-
sional Record during consideration of the 
measure on the House floor. Thank you for 
the cooperative spirit in which you have 
worked regarding this matter and others be-
tween our committees. 
Sincerely, 
JERROLD NADLER, 
Chairman. 
HOUSE
OF
REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITEE
ON
TRANSPORTATION 
AND INFRASTRUCTURE, 
Washington, DC, February 7, 2020. 
Hon. JERROLD NADLER, 
Chairman, Committee on Judiciary, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN NADLER: Thank you for 
your letter regarding H.R. 5139, the Stop Sex-
ual Assault and Harassment in Transpor-
tation Act, which was ordered to be reported 
out of the Committee on Transportation and 
Infrastructure on November 20, 2019. I appre-
ciate your willingness to work cooperatively 
on this legislation. 
I acknowledge that by foregoing formal 
consideration on H.R. 5139, the Committee 
on Judiciary does not waive any future juris-
dictional claims to provisions in this or 
similar legislation, and that your Committee 
will be consulted and involved on any mat-
ters in your Committee’s jurisdiction should 
this legislation move forward. In addition, 
should a conference on the bill be necessary, 
I would support your effort to seek appoint-
ment of an appropriate number of conferees 
to any House-Senate conference involving 
provisions within this legislation on which 
the Committee on Judiciary has a valid ju-
risdictional claim. 
I appreciate your cooperation regarding 
this legislation, and I will ensure that our 
exchange of letters is included in the Con-
gressional Record during floor consideration 
of H.R. 5139. 
Sincerely, 
PETER A. DEFAZIO, 
Chair. 
Mrs. MILLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the 
goal of H.R. 5139 to prevent incidents of 
sexual 
assault 
and 
harassment 
in 
transportation. 
Passengers should feel safe while 
traveling, and transportation workers 
should feel safe in their workplace. No 
one condones sexual misconduct in the 
transportation sector, or anywhere, for 
that matter. 
That is why the Transportation and 
Infrastructure Committee and Con-
gress took such a strong bipartisan 
stance against this type of behavior in 
air transportation in the FAA Reau-
thorization Act of 2018. 
I appreciate Chair DEFAZIO working 
with the minority to address technical 
concerns with the bill to avoid unin-
tended implementation issues. 
I urge support of this legislation, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentle-
woman for her support and the support 
of the other Republican members of the 
committee. There were some technical 
issues relating to particular modes of 
transportation, and the minority want-
ed to get this bill done, and we worked 
out those concerns. I think everybody 
should support this today. Hopefully, it 
will be unanimous. 
Mr. Speaker, there was a section that 
got left out of my opening remarks, 
and this is a stunning number. 
On U.S. airlines alone, 68 percent of 
flight attendants say they have experi-
enced sexual harassment during their 
careers. In fact, on November 8, 2019, a 
flight of a major airline diverted due to 
a passenger groping another passenger. 
The risk of an unwelcome and even 
threatening environment is real for 
both passengers and transportation 
workers alike. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. MILLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I don’t think there is 
any doubt that all Members support 
the intent of H.R. 5139. Like all of you, 
I want to help ensure that sexual mis-
conduct in transportation is elimi-
nated.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5188 
October 1, 2020 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this 
legislation, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Washington, D.C. (Ms. NORTON). 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I strong-
ly support the Stop Sexual Assault and 
Harassment in Transportation Act, 
which would institute reporting re-
quirements for incidents of sexual as-
sault and harassment in passenger 
transportation carriers including air-
lines, vessels, buses, commuter and 
intercity 
passenger 
railroads, 
and 
transportation network companies like 
Uber and Lyft. 
I am pleased that this bill includes 
provisions that direct the Department 
of Transportation to collect informa-
tion on the number of sexual assault 
and harassment incidents and to make 
that information publicly available, 
which Representative Rick Crawford 
and 
I 
included 
in 
our 
bipartisan 
AWARE Act. I believe that until we 
collect this information, the full mag-
nitude of the problem will not be un-
derstood. We have heard some of it re-
ported by my good friend just now from 
Oregon just now. 
In a 2018 survey of 2,000 flight attend-
ants, one in five said they had been 
harassed, witnessed a passenger being 
sexually assaulted, or received a report 
of passenger-on-passenger sexual as-
sault. Nearly 70 percent reported expe-
riencing sexual harassment, and al-
most one in five reported being sexu-
ally assaulted by passengers. 
In fiscal year 2014, 38 instances of in- 
flight sexual assault were reported to 
the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 
This number increased to 63 reported 
cases in 2017, but many instances of in- 
flight sexual assault remain unre-
ported, because victims are fearful of 
contacting the authorities. FBI statis-
tics indicate that as many as 75 per-
cent of incidents go unreported. 
On cruise ships, sex crimes outweigh 
any other major offense. A 2013 con-
gressional report found that minors 
were victims in one-third of reported 
sexual assaults. 
There was bipartisan support for a 
provision in the Federal Aviation Ad-
ministration Reauthorization Act of 
2018 to establish a sexual misconduct 
working group to develop best prac-
tices for addressing sexual misconduct 
on flights, employee training, and law 
enforcement notification. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
an additional 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from Washington, D.C. (Ms. 
NORTON). 
Ms. NORTON. This legislation builds 
upon that work, requiring passenger 
transportation carriers to establish 
formal policies, training, and reporting 
structures for sexual assault and har-
assment and adds penalties for individ-
uals who physically or sexually assault 
or threaten to assault transportation 
personnel. 
I support the passage of the Stop 
Sexual Assault and Harassment in 
Transportation Act so that every per-
son can feel safe from violence and har-
assment while traveling. 
b 1600 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I am pre-
pared to close, and I have no further 
speakers. I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a sen-
ior member of the House Judiciary Committee, 
I rise in strong support of H.R. 5139, the ‘‘Stop 
Sexual Assault and Harassment in Transpor-
tation Act,’’ which establishes formal sexual 
assault and harassment policies for the trans-
portation industry. 
I would like to thank Congressman DEFAZIO 
for his leadership on this vital piece of legisla-
tion. 
While the United States prides itself for 
being an innovator and leader in transpor-
tation, we are severely lacking in our protec-
tions of personnel and travelers from sexual 
assault and harassment. 
There have been too many accounts of 
women and children being sexually assaulted 
on airplanes and groped on crowded trains, as 
well as flight attendants being sexually har-
assed daily in their workplaces. 
According to a survey of students at San 
Jose´
State University conducted by Metro 
Magazine, almost two-thirds (63 percent) of 
respondents had experienced some form of 
harassment while using transit. 
Verbal harassment was the most common 
form of harassment, with 41 percent experi-
encing ‘‘obscene/harassing language’’ and 26 
percent being subjected to sexual comments. 
Among non-verbal types of harassment, 22 
percent had been stalked and 18 percent had 
been victims of indecent exposure. 
With respect to physical harassment, 11 
percent of students had experienced groping 
or inappropriate touching. 
These facts and figures are representative 
of a larger issue of sexual assault and harass-
ment in the public transportation industry 
across the country. 
Things must change. 
H.R. 5139 seeks to help prevent sexual as-
saults and sexual harassment on airplanes, 
buses, passenger vessels, commuter and 
intercity passenger railroads, and ridesharing 
vehicles by establishing formal policies to 
which transportation providers must adhere. 
For example, passenger transportation pro-
viders are required to facilitate the reporting of 
sexual harassment and assault incidents, de-
velop procedures that limit or prohibit future 
travel for individuals who perpetuate these in-
cidents, as well as train personnel to recog-
nize and respond to such incidents. 
The bill also establishes a maximum civil 
penalty of $35,000 for individuals who phys-
ically or sexually assault transportation per-
sonnel. 
Furthermore, H.R. 5139 not only establishes 
a data collection program within the Depart-
ment of Transportation regarding the number 
of incidents of sexual assault or harassment 
reported by transportation personnel and pas-
sengers each year, but it also streamlines the 
reporting process for individuals involved in an 
incident. 
By doing so, individuals will be able to re-
port allegations to law enforcement in a con-
fidential and separate manner from the report-
ing processes offered by the transportation 
provider. 
It is simply not enough to condemn sexual 
harassment and assault. 
It is time for actionable solutions that stop 
these incidents from occurring altogether, and 
this bill is a great step in that direction. 
I encourage my fellow colleagues to vote in 
favor of H.R. 5139. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DEFA-
ZIO) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, H.R. 5139, as amend-
ed. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
FRIENDLY AIRPORTS FOR

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5189 
October 1, 2020 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on S. 2638. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume, 
and I rise in support of S. 2638, the 
Friendly Airports for Mothers Improve-
ment Act. 
Introduced in the Senate by Senator 
TAMMY DUCKWORTH from Illinois, this 
is a commonsense bill that requires 
small hub airports to maintain lacta-
tion areas for nursing mothers and a 
baby-changing table in men’s and wom-
en’s restrooms. 
As a result of this legislation, small 
hub airports will begin to come in line 
with the medium and large hub air-
ports, which were charged with meet-
ing the same requirements as the re-
sult of the FAA Reauthorization Act of 
2018. 
Similar legislation was introduced in 
the House by Representative CAROL 
MILLER and passed in this Chamber De-
cember 2019. 
I 
want 
to 
thank 
both 
Senator 
DUCKWORTH and Representative MILLER 
for their leadership on this issue and 
urge my colleagues to vote in favor of 
S. 2638. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. MILLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of S. 2638, the Friendly Airports for 
Mothers Improvement Act. 
Traveling 
with 
infants 
is 
often 
stressful on new mothers and new fa-
thers. I think back to when I was a 
young mom traveling with my sons, 
Chris and Sam, and now traveling with 
their wives, who just blessed us with 
our sixth grandchild, and to all moms 
and dads across the country who face 
the distinct challenges of traveling 
with their babies, let alone babies plus 
a sibling who could be a toddler, which 
is often the case. 
This bill helps to lessen anxiety when 
traveling and allows mothers to have a 
quiet private space to care for their 
young ones. I introduced similar legis-
lation, H.R. 3362, earlier this year to 
help accomplish this goal, and I am 
pleased to see this issue brought to a 
vote today. 
As air travel continues to be one of 
the most preferred and popular means 
of transportation, we need to make 
sure that airport infrastructure is 
properly updated to fit the needs of 
American mothers and fathers and 
American families. 
S. 2638 would require small hub air-
ports to construct mothers’ rooms, 
which are areas where mothers can 
nurse their children in privacy, rather 
than a restroom. Think how disgusting 
that would be. Moms know that there 
is nothing comforting or nurturing 
about nursing a baby in an unsanitary 
condition of an airport bathroom. 
The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 
required all large and medium hub air-
ports to construct mothers’ rooms by 
2021. This bill would help fill the re-
maining gap and similarly require 
small hub airports to install mothers’ 
rooms, extending the coverage to 97 
percent of all travelers. 
With the pandemic, travel has be-
come even more difficult, so the timing 
of this bill couldn’t be more appro-
priate because it emphasizes the need 
for Congress to come together to pass 
bipartisan support in the COVID crisis, 
without which our airports may con-
tinue to be empty. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support S. 2638, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. MILLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Lou-
isiana (Mr. GRAVES), the ranking mem-
ber of the Aviation Subcommittee. 
Mr. 
GRAVES 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman 
from West Virginia. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chair-
man DEFAZIO
and Ranking Member 
SAM GRAVES for their work on this leg-
islation. 
Once again, Mr. Speaker, this is a 
demonstration of bipartisan coopera-
tion, what we were sent here to do, as 
opposed to the politics that we have all 
seen that have hijacked our govern-
ment in recent months. The reality is 
that they are real needs of the Amer-
ican public, and this is an example of 
that. 
This legislation is very simple. Air-
ports are not like traditional road-
ways. You have a runway that is usu-
ally, at most airports, one runway, and 
that is it. So when that runway goes 
down, that airport can’t function. You 
can’t have flights come in. You can’t 
have commercial or general aviation 
operations. So this legislation, very 
simply, allows for incentive-based con-
tracting, where you can reduce the 
amount of time that it takes you to do 
your construction project. It dimin-
ishes delays on vacations, family vis-
its, business travel, and all the impor-
tant things that are facilitated by our 
aviation infrastructure by airports. 
Again, it simply allows us to more 
quickly address safety issues, capacity 
issues, and expansion issues in air-
ports. The bottom line is this ulti-
mately is a saver for taxpayers, be-
cause if we can resume operations, it 
allows the traveling public to advance 
and the economy to flow, and it allows 
aviation taxes to also continue flowing. 
Mr. Speaker, again, I want to thank 
Mr. DEFAZIO, Congressman LARSEN, 
Congressman SAM
GRAVES, and all 
those who worked together on this im-
portant legislation, and I urge adop-
tion. 
Mrs. MILLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, as stated, the aim of 
this bill, ensuring that mothers and 
families with young children have 
proper facilities while traveling, is a 
need that is long overdue, and it is 
high time that we fix it. 
I have a personal story. In the 1980s, 
I was traveling with my husband and 
my two sons. One was in diapers, and 
one was a toddler. I handed the one in 
diapers to my husband when I realized 
that the baby needed to be changed. He 
took the baby and the paraphernalia 
with him to the men’s restroom to 
take care of the baby. 
When he comes back, he hands me a 
child who is crying, looks at his 
mommy, and reaches out. My husband 
goes: I did the best I could with what I 
had. 
Well, he went into a bathroom that 
had sinks lined up on the wall, so he 
had to place the baby on top of two 
sinks to take care of business. I will 
leave the rest up to you, but we did do 
the best we could. 
Thank the Lord, we are now going to 
be in modern times and take care of 
families the way they should be, hav-
ing the appropriate things in both 
bathrooms. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to 
support this bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, affording women lacta-
tion stations is something that I was 
very proud to have done, as we are now 
doing with small airports. We did it for 
all county facilities in county govern-
ment when I was a county supervisor. 
I am really glad to see this bipartisan 
bill is moving forward. Mr. Speaker, I 
urge my colleagues to support the leg-
islation, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
CARBAJAL) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, S. 2638. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
REINVIGORATING LENDING FOR 
THE FUTURE ACT 
Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(S. 4075) to amend the Public Works 
and Economic Development Act of 1965 
to provide for the release of certain 
Federal interests in connection with 
certain grants under that Act, and for 
other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 4075 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on S. 4075. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of S. 4075, the Reinvigorating Lending 
for the Future Act. 
This bipartisan legislation will help 
cut the red tape and allow greater lev-
els of local investment in economic de-
velopment projects by allowing the 
Economic 
Development 
Administra-
tion to waive Federal interest in cer-
tain revolving loan funds. 
The EDA supports economic develop-
ment by providing seed capital to re-
volving loan funds that offer low-inter-
est loans to help new businesses get off 
the ground. Those loans are repaid 
with interest to the RLF manager, 
which then loans the funds out again to 
other businesses. This strategy has 
been highly effective, and more than 
500 RLFs are in operation today. 
But unlike other EDA grants, the 
Federal interest in these funds remain 
in perpetuity. RLF managers must re-
port and the EDA must track these 
funds, no matter how many times they 
are lent out and repaid. The funds can 
never be repurposed for other economic 
development projects. 
The RLF Act fixes this bureaucratic 
nightmare by allowing the Secretary of 
Commerce to release the Federal inter-
est in these funds after 7 years, pro-
vided that the funds are used for other 
approved 
economic 
development 
projects like the development of public 
infrastructure or workforce training. 
This bill cuts through the red tape 
and allows for the local control our re-
gions need to invest in the most bene-
ficial economic development projects 
for their communities. 
This legislation has broad bipartisan 
support and is endorsed by the Na-
tional Association of Development Or-
ganizations and the International Eco-
nomic Development Council, two of the 
largest economic development advo-
cacy groups in the country. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my fellow col-
leagues to support this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
b 1615 
Mrs. MILLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
S. 4075, the RLF Act, would release 
the Federal interest in the Economic 
Development Administration’s revolv-
ing loan funds after 7 years if requested 
by the recipient. 
I thank Congressman KATKO, the 
ranking member of the Subcommittee 
on 
Economic 
Development, 
Public 
Buildings, and Emergency Manage-
ment, for his leadership and work on 
this issue. 
This fix to reduce the administrative 
burden of RLF funds was requested by 
the administration, as well as by State 
and local economic development offi-
cials. 
Even after the funds have turned 
over in these RLFs, local officials con-
tinue to be saddled with unnecessary 
paperwork. Releasing the Federal in-
terest when the government’s role is 
over will also release officials of the 
extra paperwork. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this 
legislation, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. MILLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, S. 4075 will cut red tape 
and reduce paperwork for the commu-
nities that receive EDA grants for re-
volving loan funds. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this 
important legislation, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
my colleagues to support this legisla-
tion, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
in support of the Senate companion to my bill, 
S. 4075 the Reinvigorating Lending for the Fu-
ture Act of 2020. The U.S. Economic Develop-
ment Administration and its Revolving Loan 
Fund program provide desperately needed 
loans to small businesses and local commu-
nity organizations across the United States. 
This funding is often a lifeline to rural com-
munities overlooked by traditional financing. 
However, under current burdensome regula-
tions, EDA RLF grantees must report on these 
funds ‘‘in perpetuity’’—even on loans made 
and paid back decades ago. I have heard 
from the Minnesota Association of Develop-
ment Organizations, 8 of the 10 organizations 
serve my district, that this requirement takes 
away valuable time from the work at hand 
which is providing access to capital and sup-
porting businesses. 
Now more than ever, as many Americans 
are struggling to stay afloat during the 
COVID–19 pandemic, the RLF Act is a vital 
sign of support to our small businesses back 
home. My bill would remove this unnecessary 
requirement and allow local communities the 
freedom they need to recover their economies. 
This bipartisan legislation requires no addi-
tional funding, and creates more flexibility for 
regional economic development. The RLF Act 
returns decision making to the local units of 
government, eliminates unnecessary reporting 
and is just good common sense. I urge my 
colleagues to support this important bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
CARBAJAL) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, S. 4075. 
The question was taken; and (two-

rules were suspended and the bill was

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on H.R. 5912, as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
5912, the Expedited Delivery of Airport 
Infrastructure Act of 2020, introduced 
by Representative SAM
GRAVES, the 
ranking member of the House Com-
mittee on Transportation and Infra-
structure. The bill incentivizes the 
early completion of airport projects 
funded by the Federal Aviation Admin-
istration’s Airport Improvement Pro-
gram, AIP. 
Although current airline passenger 
traffic has declined precipitously due 
to the coronavirus pandemic, there will 
come a time when domestic and global 
air 
travel 
will 
return 
to 
its 
prepandemic heights and continue to 
grow further. Airports will once again 
have to keep up with growing pas-
senger demand. This legislation will 
help to address this future need by al-
lowing airports to use their AIP fund-
ing to offer incentive payments to con-
tractors for early completion of airport 
development projects. 
Importantly, H.R. 5912 includes con-
ditions that ensure projects completed 
early do not have a negative impact on 
airport safety, efficiency, or capacity. 
I support this legislation and urge 
my colleagues to do the same. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 5912, the Expedited Delivery of 
Airport Infrastructure Act of 2020. 
This bill, which I am very proud to 
have introduced, gives airports the op-
tion to use some of their Airport Im-
provement Program, or AIP, money to 
expedite early completion of airport 
projects. 
Incentives such as these are com-
monly used in the surface transpor-
tation area, as encouraging early com-
pletion of road projects obviously can 
spare 
drivers 
additional 
weeks 
or 
months of congestion and sitting in 
traffic. 
An airfield is no different. Taking a 
runway or taxiway out of commission 
can impair airport efficiency and ca-
pacity, and it results in flight delays, 
upset travelers, you name it. 
Additionally, some airports, particu-
larly in cold weather States, are racing 
against the clock to complete projects 
during a limited construction season. 
Even if a project is on schedule, an 
early winter or late spring can grind 
construction to a halt, costing the air-
port time and money. 
This bill is going help ensure that 
airports have the tools necessary to 
avoid these situations and get runways 
back into service faster. 
This bill allows airports to achieve 
cost savings. Projects completed early 
means a greater chance of avoiding 
construction price increases due to in-
flation. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support H.R. 5912, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Speaker, I urge

United States Code, is amended by amending 
the item relating to section 110 to read as 
follows: 
‘‘110. Great Lakes St. Lawrence Seaway De-
velopment Corporation.’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. CARJABAL) and the gen-
tleman from Missouri (Mr. GRAVES) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on H.R. 4470, as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume, 
and rise in strong support of H.R. 4470. 
This legislation, introduced by the 
gentlewoman from Ohio, Representa-
tive MARCY KAPTUR, is simple in its in-
tent but strong in its meaning. H.R. 
4470 would rename the Saint Lawrence 
Seaway Development Corporation as 
the Great Lakes St. Lawrence Seaway 
Development Corporation. 
The binational Saint Lawrence Sea-
way is a 328-nautical-mile deep-draft 
waterway between the Port of Mon-
treal and Lake Erie. It connects the 
Great Lakes with the Atlantic Ocean 
through the Saint Lawrence River. The 
U.S. portion of the Seaway was author-
ized in 1954 and is operated by the 
Saint Lawrence Seaway Development 
Corporation within the United States 
Department of Transportation. 
This change would more accurately 
portray the geographical scope of the 
agency and would clarify the agency’s 
mission is of benefit to the Saint Law-
rence region, as well as the entire 
Great Lakes region. 
I thank Representative KAPTUR for 
her work on this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to 
support H.R. 4470, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 4470. 
By adding the words ‘‘Great Lakes’’ 
to the name of the Saint Lawrence 
Seaway Development Corporation, the 
corporation will better reflect its geo-
graphic location and its economic im-
portance to this significant region of 
the Nation. 
Located within the Department of 
Transportation, 
the 
corporation 
is 
charged with operating and maintain-
ing all U.S. infrastructure and waters 
of the Saint Lawrence Seaway. The 
corporation is also tasked with devel-
oping trade focused on driving eco-
nomic activity for the entire Great 
Lakes-Saint Lawrence Seaway system. 
I urge support of the bipartisan legis-
lation to better represent what this 
federally owned corporation means to 
the Great Lakes. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I don’t have any speakers. 
I urge support of H.R. 4470, and I 
yield back the balance of my time and. 
Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
my colleagues to support the legisla-
tion, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
CARBAJAL) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4470, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. CARBAJAL) and the gen-
tleman from Missouri (Mr. GRAVES) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on S. 1982, as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise in full support of S. 1982, impor-
tant bipartisan legislation to further 
improve our national capabilities to re-
spond to the global problem of marine 
debris, especially impacts caused by 
plastic waste on the ocean environ-
ment. 
Marine debris is essentially any trash 
or litter that ends up in the marine en-
vironment or the Great Lakes. It origi-
nates from a wide variety of locations 
and often travels great distances before 
ending up in the ocean. 
Marine debris is everywhere. It is 
found around every major body of 
water on the planet and along every 
shoreline in the world, no matter how 
remote. 
These materials pose a substantial 
threat to marine life that might ingest 
or get entangled in marine debris or 
have their habitats degraded. But 
equally 
important, 
marine 
debris 
threatens public health and safety in 
the form of degraded water quality, in-
creased exposure to pathogens and 
chemicals, and damage to vessels. 
The legislation before us this after-
noon incorporates the contributions of 
no less than six different committees 
that reviewed and offered several tar-
geted amendments to improve provi-
sions under each committee’s jurisdic-
tion. 
Of note, I want to thank Chair GRI-
JALVA, 
Chair 
ENGEL, 
Chairwoman 
JOHNSON, Chair PALLONE, Chair PETER-
SON, and their respective staffs for 
their cooperation in refining this non-
controversial legislation so that it 
could be considered today. 
As amended, this legislation will pro-
vide an increase in annual funding 
under the Marine Debris Act to $15 mil-
lion, a 50 percent increase over existing 
authorized funding levels. 
This funding increase should help to 
strengthen current programs adminis-
tered by NOAA and the U.S. Coast 
Guard and prioritize efforts to combat 
marine debris through innovation and 
entrepreneurship programs. 
Moreover, this legislation authorizes 
new approaches to address the inter-
national complexity of marine debris, 
most notably through the establish-
ment of a charitable nonprofit Marine 
Debris Foundation. 
It also provides specific direction to 
Federal agencies to maintain inter-
national leadership on marine debris 
and provides enhanced support for plas-
tic waste mitigation. 
Even though the bill is not perfect, 
on balance, it is a very positive addi-
tion to the legislation passed last Con-
gress to reauthorize the Marine Debris 
Act. 
b 1630 
And considering the scale of the ma-
rine debris challenge, it stands to rea-
son that this will not be the last bill 
Congress enacts to address this serious 
environmental problem. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague 
from Oregon, Congresswoman SUZANNE 
BONAMICI, for her leadership on this 
issue and tireless advocacy to get this 
bill through the House. 
In closing, Mr. Speaker, this is good, 
bipartisan legislation that deserves 
support from Members on both sides of 
the aisle, and I urge its passage today. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time.

Thank you again, and I look forward to

Sincerely, 
PETER A. DEFAZIO, 
Chair. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased today 
that S. 1982, the Save Our Seas 2.0, or 
SOS 2.0, Act is scheduled for consider-
ation today. 
Last Congress, we passed the Save 
Our Seas Act building upon the work of 
the Marine Debris Act, which combats 
ocean-based solid waste pollution. 
Save Our Seas 2.0 develops these ex-
isting programs by establishing a Ma-
rine Debris Foundation to enhance 
Federal and private efforts to combat 
marine debris and authorizing a genius 
award to promote improved ocean 
cleanup technology. 
The bill also authorizes studies, 
grant programs, and international ne-
gotiations to better understand the 
causes of ocean pollution and improve 
how we prevent and eliminate this pol-
lution. 
Mr. Speaker, I commend Representa-
tive DON YOUNG for his work and lead-
ership on the House companion to this 
bill. His district was hit particularly 
hard by marine debris arriving from 
Japan after the 2011 tsunami. 
That tsunami drove one ghost fishing 
boat all the way from the coast of 
Japan to the Gulf of Alaska before 
being sunk by the U.S. Coast Guard; 
just one example of how far debris can 
travel. 
Mr. Speaker, I also thank Chairman 
DEFAZIO for working with us on minor 
changes to this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this 
legislation, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Or-
egon (Ms. BONAMICI). 
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my colleague for yielding. I also thank 
Chairman DEFAZIO for his ongoing ef-
forts to help us bring this important 
bill to the floor today. 
As the co-chair of the House Oceans 
Caucus, I rise in strong support of Save 
Our Seas 2.0, a bill to clean up marine 
debris. 
Every minute, the equivalent of a 
garbage truck full of plastic is dumped 
into our ocean. According to the 
United Nations, that is more than 8 
million tons a year. Plastic bottles, 
straws, grocery bags, cigarette butts, 
fishing gear, and abandoned vessels lit-
ter the ocean. 
After the tsunami hit the coast of 
Japan in 2011, large materials, like 
docks and boats that carried invasive 
species, ended up on the shores of 
northwest Oregon. 
Tiny pieces of plastic also make their 
way into marine life, blocking diges-
tive tracts, altering growth, and in 
some cases killing marine mammals 
and fisheries. 
We still don’t know how long it takes 
for plastic to completely biodegrade. 
Estimates range from 450 years to 
never. A recent study from the Pew 
Charitable Trusts found that without 
action, by 2040, the annual flow of plas-
tic into the ocean could nearly triple 
to 29 million metric tons. 
Let me be clear: We need to fun-
damentally change our reliance on 
plastics. Plastics pollute our ocean and 
exacerbate the climate crisis. The fos-
sil fuel and plastics industries are deep-
ly connected, and plastics contribute a 
significant share of industrial emis-
sions in the United States. 
A problem this pervasive, a global 
problem of this magnitude, cannot be 
solved with a single bill. We cannot 
limit our action to removing existing 
plastic from the ocean, and we can also 
not recycle our way out of plastic 
waste that ends up on our shores. 
We need comprehensive action, but 
today we have the opportunity to build 
on our foundation, a bipartisan, bi-
cameral effort to strengthen the NOAA 
Marine Debris Program. 
Save Our Seas 2.0 will improve the 
domestic response to marine debris by 
creating a Marine Debris Foundation 
to support NOAA’s work, advance the 
removal and prevention of plastic 
waste, and establish a pilot program to 
provide incentives for the proper dis-
posal of marine debris collected at sea. 
The 
bill 
will 
incentivize 
inter-
national engagement to address marine 
debris by raising awareness about the 
sources of plastic waste and the effects 
of mismanaged waste and assess the 
potential 
for 
a 
new 
international 
agreement to address marine debris. 
Save Our Seas 2.0 will strengthen do-
mestic infrastructure to prevent the 
creation of new marine debris by estab-
lishing grant programs to assist States 
and localities in improving local waste 
management systems and review op-
portunities to minimize the production 
of new plastic waste. 
The ocean is resilient, and we can 
help it heal, but we cannot afford to 
wait. We have significant work ahead 
to prevent marine debris and Save Our 
Seas 2.0 continues to build on our bi-
partisan foundation to protect the 
ocean. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to close by 
thanking my colleague and co-chair of 
the House Oceans Caucus, Representa-
tive DON YOUNG from Alaska, for his 
partnership on this bill, and to our 
Senate colleagues, Senator DAN SUL-
LIVAN
and Senator SHELDON
WHITE-
HOUSE. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this bill to strength-
en the Federal response to marine de-
bris. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield such time as he may con-
sume to the gentleman from Alaska 
(Mr. YOUNG), the dean of the House. 
Mr. YOUNG. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman, Congressman GRAVES, 
for yielding to me. 
Again, I support this bill, S. 1982, 
Save Our Seas 2.0. This is a great bipar-
tisan bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate my col-
league, the caucus co-chair, Congress-
woman SUZANNE BONAMICI, for this bill. 
This is our bill. It is a Senate bill we 
are taking up, but we have been work-
ing on this bill. 
Again, it is an issue. I agree with ev-
erything that has been said about the 
pollution in our oceans. 
This is probably bigger than the oil 
spill of the Exxon Valdez, the plastics 
that are in our seas, and we have got to 
take up and address this issue. 
This is just the beginning. We need to 
do more, but we have to take the short 
step first, and then we will continue to 
do it. 
You know, in Alaska, the ocean is 
our highway. We need to clean it; we 
want to work on it. We have to address 
that issue at sea, too. 
You know, plastic is one of those 
things that really does not deteriorate 
very rapidly, but when it does, fish will 
eat it, and we get condemned and con-
taminated fish. We do not need that in 
Alaska. 
It will clean up our oceans, as I men-
tioned before, and asks for cooperation 
from other countries. 
America is not the worst polluter. 
There are other countries that pollute 
just as equally or more, and it all col-
lects in the middle of the Pacific 
Ocean. We have an area out there as 
big as the State of Texas full of pollu-
tion. We have to start cleaning it up 
and stop it if we can. 
Mr. Speaker, again, as has been men-
tioned, I thank Chairman PETER DEFA-
ZIO and Ranking Member GRAVES for 
their work, Chairman ENGEL for his 
work, and the staffs, especially John

Rayfield and Dave Jansen from the 
Transportation 
and 
Infrastructure 
Committee. I thank my personal staff, 
Kevin Swanson and Kayla Rillo. They 
worked very hard on this legislation, a 
lot of work. 
The bill is truly a bipartisan bill. 
What a way to finish up this session, 
with a bipartisan bill, working to-
gether to solve a universal problem: de-
bris in our oceans. It shows that we can 
work together, and I encourage con-
tinuation of this type of effort to make 
sure our oceans are clean forever. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support S. 1982. And remember, DAN 
SULLIVAN introduced it on the Senate 
side, that is why we are taking up the 
Senate bill, but it is really a House 
bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my ranking 
member and my chairman, though he 
is not here. 
Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Hawaii 
(Mr. CASE). 
Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, the air, land, 
and oceans of our Earth are in mortal 
danger and must be saved. But it is our 
oceans that are the most vast and un-
known of these and with the most com-
plex and extensive risk from climate 
change, to pollution, extraction, and 
marine debris. 
Debris is especially acute in my own 
Pacific and its epicenter, the 1,500- 
mile-long 
Hawaiian 
Islands 
chain, 
which acts as a giant comb for all man-
ner of marine trash. Fifty-two metric 
tons 
of 
debris 
clutter 
our 
Papahanaumokuakea Marine National 
Monument annually, with tons more 
on the shores of the main Hawaiian Is-
lands. 
The results are human health and 
safety problems, habitat destruction, 
wildlife entanglements, vessel dam-
ages, navigational hazards, invasive 
species transport, and beach and coast-
line destruction. 
The Save Our Seas 2.0 Act ups our na-
tional ante on this critical issue by 
bolstering and funding actions that can 
make a real difference. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge passage. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I don’t have anyone else to speak, 
so with that, I urge my colleagues to 
support the bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
my colleagues to support the legisla-
tion, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
CARBAJAL) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, S. 1982, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

COVID–19 
disinformation and misinformation content and 
the role social media platforms play in the orga-
nization of groups seeking to spread COVID–19 
disinformation; 
(4) the potential financial returns for creators 
or distributors of COVID–19 disinformation, and 
the role such financial incentives play in the 
propagation of COVID–19 disinformation; 
(5) potential strategies to mitigate the dissemi-
nation and negative impacts of COVID–19 
disinformation, including specifically, the dis-
semination of disinformation on social media, 
including through improved disclosures; and 
(6) an analysis of the limitations of these miti-
gation strategies, and an analysis of how these 
strategies can be implemented without infring-
ing on Americans’ Constitutional rights and 
civil liberties.

The Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment

et seq.) is amended by inserting after section 201 
the following: 
‘‘SEC. 202. REPORT AND GUIDANCE ON UNREGU-
LATED CUSTODY TRANSFERS. 
‘‘(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that: 
‘‘(1) Some adopted children may be at risk of 
experiencing an unregulated custody transfer 
because the challenges associated with adop-
tions (including the child’s mental health needs 
and the difficulties many families face in ac-
quiring support services) may lead families to 
seek out unregulated custody transfers. 
‘‘(2) Some adopted children experience trau-
ma, and the disruption and placement in an-
other home by unregulated custody transfer cre-
ates additional trauma and instability for chil-
dren. 
‘‘(3) Children who experience an unregulated 
custody transfer may be placed with families 
who have not completed required child welfare 
or criminal background checks or clearances. 
‘‘(4) Social services agencies and courts are 
often unaware of the placement of children 
through unregulated custody transfer and 
therefore do not conduct assessments on the 
child’s safety and well-being in such place-
ments. 
‘‘(5) Such lack of placement oversight places a 
child at risk for future abuse and increases the 
chance that the child may experience— 
‘‘(A) abuse or neglect; 
‘‘(B) contact with unsafe adults or youth; and 
‘‘(C) exposure to unsafe or isolated environ-
ments. 
‘‘(6) The caregivers with whom a child is 
placed through unregulated custody transfer 
often have no legal responsibility with respect to 
such child, placing the child at risk for addi-
tional unregulated custody transfers. 
‘‘(7) Such caregivers also may not have com-
plete records with respect to such child, includ-
ing the child’s birth, medical, or immigration 
records. 
‘‘(8) A child adopted through intercountry 
adoption may be at risk of not acquiring United 
States citizenship if an unregulated custody 
transfer occurs before the adoptive parents com-
plete all necessary steps to finalize the adoption 
of such child. 
‘‘(9) Engaging in, or offering to engage in, un-
regulated custody transfer places children at 
risk of harm.

‘‘(B) EFFECT OF CONVEYANCE.—The seed in-
vestment interest conveyed under paragraph (1) 
shall have all the rights and attributes of other 
investors with respect to the Program partici-
pant, but shall not assign control or voting 
rights to the Administrator. The seed investment 
interest shall entitle the Administrator to a pro 
rata portion of any distributions made by the 
Program participant equal to the percentage of 
capital in the Program participant that the seed 
investment comprises. The Administrator shall 
receive distributions from the Program partici-
pant at the same times and in the same amounts 
as any other investor in the Program partici-
pant with a similar interest. The Program par-
ticipant shall make allocations of income, gain, 
loss, deduction, and credit to the Administrator 
with respect to the seed investment interest as if 
the Administrator were an investor. 
‘‘(2) MANAGER PROFITS.—The manager profits 
interest payable to the managers of a Program 
participant shall not exceed 20 percent of prof-
its, exclusive of any profits that may accrue as 
a result of the capital contributions of any such 
managers with respect to such Program partici-
pant. Any excess of this amount, less taxes pay-
able thereon, shall be returned by the managers 
and paid to the investors and the Administrator 
in proportion to the capital contributions and 
seed investments paid in. No manager profits in-
terest (other than a tax distribution) shall be 
paid prior to the repayment to the investors and 
the Administrator of all contributed capital and 
seed investments made. A manager of a Program 
participant may charge reasonable and cus-
tomary management and organizational fees. 
‘‘(3) DISTRIBUTION
REQUIREMENTS.—A Pro-
gram participant that receives a seed investment 
under the Program shall make all distributions 
to all investors in cash and shall make distribu-
tions within a reasonable time after exiting in-
vestments, including following a public offering 
or market sale of underlying investments. 
‘‘(4) LIMITATION ON GRANT PROFITS.—Once the 
Administrator has received an amount equal to 
110 percent of the amount of the seed investment 
made to a Program participant, the requirement 
to convey seed investment interest under this 
subsection shall be terminated and no further 
distributions of profits shall be made to the Ad-
ministrator.

tent of a reduction in accordance with section 
305(e)(8) adopted prior to the plan’s application 
for partition under this section). 
‘‘(B) The funded percentage of the plan (dis-
regarding partitioned benefits) at the end of the 
30-year period is projected to be 80 percent.

year period described in subsection (g) has 
lapsed, in applying this paragraph, 5 years 
shall be substituted for 30 years.

require to determine the amount of the adjust-
ment under paragraph (1).

OF
ADJUSTMENTS.—Adjust-
ments under this subsection with respect to spe-
cial partition assistance for an eligible multiem-
ployer plan shall cease and the corporation

(subject to subsection (l)) beginning with the 
first plan year that the funded percentage of the 
eligible multiemployer plan (disregarding parti-
tioned benefits) is at least 80 percent and the

under this paragraph.

tion 305(b)(3) that the plan is or will be in crit-
ical status for the plan year in which such 
amendment would become effective or for any of

ant to paragraph (1) to incorporate the features

ment under which contributions to the multiem-
ployer plan are required, which shall occur on 
the first day of the first plan year beginning 
after the termination, or if earlier, the re-open-
ing, of each such agreement, or such earlier date

to; and

plan year beginning on or after the date of the 
adoption of the amendment;

is amended pursuant to paragraph (1)—

nent and the defined benefit plan component of 
the plan shall be held in a single trust forming 
part of the plan under which the trust instru-
ment expressly provides—

records) to be maintained to reflect the interest 
which each of the plan components has in the 
trust, including separate accounting for addi-
tions to the trust for the benefit of each plan 
component, disbursements made from each plan 
component’s account in the trust, investment ex-
perience of the trust allocable to that account,

penses or shared expenses allocated proportion-
ally), and permits, but does not require, the 
pooling of some or all of the assets of the two 
plan components for investment purposes; and 
‘‘(ii) that the assets of each of the two plan 
components shall be held, invested, reinvested, 
managed, administered and distributed for the 
exclusive benefit of the participants and bene-
ficiaries of each such plan component, and in 
no event shall the assets of one of the plan com-
ponents be available to pay benefits due under 
the other plan component.

A
TERMINATION
EVENT.—Notwith-
standing section 4041A, an amendment pursuant

‘‘(5) NOTICE TO THE SECRETARY.— 
‘‘(A) NOTICE.—The plan sponsor of a com-
posite plan shall provide notice to the Secretary 
of the intent to establish the composite plan (or,

plan’ includes a composite plan component 
added to a defined benefit plan pursuant to

plan sponsor of a multiemployer plan from 
adopting an amendment pursuant to paragraph 
(1) because some collective bargaining agree-
ments are amended to cease any covered em-
ployer’s obligation to contribute to the multiem-
ployer plan before or after the plan amendment 
is effective. Paragraph (2)(B) shall not be con-
strued as preventing the plan sponsor of a mul-
tiemployer plan from adopting an amendment 
pursuant to paragraph (1) because some partici-
pants cease to have contributions made to the 
multiemployer plan on their behalf before or 
after the plan amendment is effective. 
‘‘(c) COORDINATION WITH FUNDING RULES.— 
Except as otherwise provided in this title, sec-
tions 302, 304, and 305 shall not apply to a com-
posite plan. 
‘‘(d) TREATMENT OF A COMPOSITE PLAN.—For 
purposes of this Act (other than sections 302 and 
4245), a composite plan shall be treated as if it 
were a defined benefit plan unless a different

the current collective bargaining agreement and 
any agreed-to supplements, up to a maximum of 
2.5 percent per year, compounded annually, un-
less it would be unreasonable under the cir-
cumstances to assume that contributions would 
increase by that amount. 
‘‘(b) ACTUARIAL
ASSUMPTIONS
AND
METH-
ODS.—For purposes of this part: 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—All costs, liabilities, rates of 
interest and other factors under the plan shall 
be determined for a plan year on the basis of ac-
tuarial assumptions and methods— 
‘‘(A) each of which is reasonable (taking into 
account the experience of the plan and reason-
able expectations); 
‘‘(B) which, in combination, offer the actu-
ary’s best estimate of anticipated experience 
under the plan; and 
‘‘(C) with respect to which any change from 
the actuarial assumptions and methods used in 
the previous plan year shall be certified by the 
plan actuary and the actuarial rationale for 
such change provided in the annual report re-
quired by section 103. 
‘‘(2) FAIR
MARKET
VALUE
OF
ASSETS.—The 
value of the plan’s assets shall be taken into ac-
count on the basis of their fair market value. 
‘‘(3) DETERMINATION
OF
NORMAL
COST
AND 
PLAN LIABILITIES.—A plan’s normal cost and li-
abilities shall be based on the most recent actu-
arial 
valuation 
required 
under 
section 
801(a)(5)(A) and the unit credit funding method. 
‘‘(4) TIME
WHEN
CERTAIN
CONTRIBUTIONS 
DEEMED MADE.—Any contributions for a plan 
year made by an employer after the last day of 
such plan year, but not later than two and one- 
half months after such day, shall be deemed to 
have been made on such last day. For purposes 
of this paragraph, such two and one-half month 
period may be extended for not more than six 
months under regulations prescribed by the Sec-
retary of the Treasury. 
‘‘(5) ADDITIONAL
ACTUARIAL
ASSUMPTIONS.— 
Except where otherwise provided in this part, 
the provisions of section 305(b)(3)(B) shall apply 
to any determination or projection under this 
part. 
‘‘SEC. 803. REALIGNMENT PROGRAM. 
‘‘(a) REALIGNMENT PROGRAM.— 
‘‘(1) ADOPTION.—In any case in which the 
plan actuary certifies under section 802(a) that 
the plan’s projected funded ratio is below 120 
percent for the plan year, the plan sponsor shall 
adopt a realignment program under paragraph 
(2) not later than 210 days after the due date of 
the certification required under such section 
802(a). The plan sponsor shall adopt an updated 
realignment program for each succeeding plan 
year for which a certification described in the 
preceding sentence is made. 
‘‘(2) CONTENT OF REALIGNMENT PROGRAM.— 
‘‘(A) IN
GENERAL.—A realignment program 
adopted under this paragraph is a written pro-
gram which consists of all reasonable measures, 
including options or a range of options to be un-
dertaken by the plan sponsor or proposed to the 
bargaining parties, formulated, based on reason-
ably anticipated experience and reasonable ac-
tuarial assumptions, to enable the plan to 
achieve a projected funded ratio of at least 120 
percent for the following plan year. 
‘‘(B) INITIAL
PROGRAM
ELEMENTS.—Reason-
able measures under a realignment program de-
scribed in subparagraph (A) may include any of 
the following: 
‘‘(i) Proposed contribution increases. 
‘‘(ii) A reduction in the rate of future benefit 
accruals, so long as the resulting rate is not less 
than 1 percent of the contributions on which 
benefits are based as of the start of the plan 
year (or the equivalent standard accrual rate as 
described in section 305(e)(6)). 
‘‘(iii) A modification or elimination of adjust-
able benefits of participants that are not in pay 
status before the date of the notice required 
under subsection (b)(1). 
‘‘(iv) Any other lawfully available measures 
not specifically described in this subparagraph 
or subparagraph (C) or (D) that the plan spon-
sor determines are reasonable. 
‘‘(C) ADDITIONAL PROGRAM ELEMENTS.—If the 
plan sponsor has determined that all reasonable 
measures available under subparagraph (B) will 
not enable the plan to achieve a projected fund-
ed ratio of at least 120 percent for the following 
plan year, such reasonable measures may also 
include— 
‘‘(i) a reduction of accrued benefits that are 
not in pay status by the date of the notice re-
quired under subsection (b)(1); or 
‘‘(ii) a reduction of any benefits of partici-
pants that are in pay status before the date of 
the notice required under subsection (b)(1) other 
than core benefits as defined in paragraph (4). 
‘‘(D) ADDITIONAL REDUCTIONS.—In the case of 
a composite plan for which the plan sponsor has 
determined that all reasonable measures avail-
able under subparagraphs (B) and (C) will not 
enable the plan to achieve a projected funded 
ratio of at least 120 percent for the following 
plan year, such reasonable measures may also 
include— 
‘‘(i) a further reduction in the rate of future 
benefit accruals without regard to the limitation 
applicable under subparagraph (B)(ii); or 
‘‘(ii) a reduction of core benefits; 
provided that such reductions shall be equitably 
distributed across the participant and bene-
ficiary population, taking into account factors, 
with respect to participants and beneficiaries 
and their benefits, that may include one or more 
of the factors listed in subclauses (I) through 
(X) of section 305(e)(9)(D)(vi), to the extent nec-
essary to enable the plan to achieve a projected 
funded ratio of at least 120 percent for the fol-
lowing plan year, or at the election of the plan 
sponsor, a projected funded ratio of at least 100 
percent for the following plan year and a cur-
rent funded ratio of at least 90 percent. 
‘‘(3) ADJUSTABLE BENEFIT DEFINED.—For pur-
poses of this part, the term ‘adjustable benefit’ 
means— 
‘‘(A) benefits, rights, and features under the 
plan, including post-retirement death benefits, 
60-month guarantees, disability benefits not yet 
in pay status, and similar benefits; 
‘‘(B) any early retirement benefit or retire-
ment-type subsidy (within the meaning of sec-
tion 204(g)(2)(A)) and any benefit payment op-
tion (other than the qualified joint and survivor 
annuity); and 
‘‘(C) benefit increases that were adopted (or, 
if later, took effect) less than 60 months before 
the first day such realignment program took ef-
fect. 
‘‘(4) CORE BENEFIT DEFINED.—For purposes of 
this part, the term ‘core benefit’ means a partici-
pant’s accrued benefit payable in the normal 
form of an annuity commencing at normal re-
tirement age, determined without regard to— 
‘‘(A) any early retirement benefits, retirement- 
type subsidies, or other benefits, rights, or fea-
tures that may be associated with that benefit; 
and 
‘‘(B) any cost-of-living adjustments or benefit 
increases effective after the date of retirement. 
‘‘(5) COORDINATION
WITH
CONTRIBUTION
IN-
CREASES.— 
‘‘(A) IN
GENERAL.—A realignment program 
may provide that some or all of the benefit modi-
fications described in the program will only take 
effect if the bargaining parties fail to agree to 
specified levels of increases in contributions to 
the plan, effective as of specified dates. 
‘‘(B) INDEPENDENT BENEFIT MODIFICATIONS.— 
If a realignment program adopts any changes to 
the benefit formula that are independent of po-
tential contribution increases, such changes 
shall take effect not later than 180 days after 
the first day of the first plan year that begins 
following the adoption of the realignment pro-
gram. 
‘‘(C) CONDITIONAL BENEFIT MODIFICATIONS.— 
If a realignment program adopts any changes to 
the benefit formula that take effect only if the 
bargaining parties fail to agree to contribution 
increases, such changes shall take effect not 
later than the first day of the first plan year be-
ginning after the third anniversary of the date 
of adoption of the realignment program. 
‘‘(D) REVOCATION OF CERTAIN BENEFIT MODI-
FICATIONS.—Benefit modifications described in 
subparagraph (C) may be revoked, in whole or 
in part, and retroactively or prospectively, when 
contributions to the plan are increased, as speci-
fied in the realignment program, including any 
amendments thereto. The preceding sentence 
shall not apply unless the contribution increases 
are to be effective not later than the fifth anni-
versary of the first day of the first plan year 
that begins after the adoption of the realign-
ment program. 
‘‘(b) NOTICE.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—In any case in which it is 
certified under section 802(a) that the projected 
funded ratio is less than 120 percent, the plan 
sponsor shall, not later than 30 days after the 
date of the certification, provide notification of 
the current and projected funded ratios to the 
participants and beneficiaries, the bargaining 
parties, and the Secretary. Such notice shall in-
clude— 
‘‘(A) an explanation that contribution rate in-
creases or benefit reductions may be necessary; 
‘‘(B) a description of the types of benefits that 
might be reduced; and 
‘‘(C) an estimate of the contribution increases 
and benefit reductions that may be necessary to 
achieve a projected funded ratio of 120 percent. 
‘‘(2) NOTICE OF BENEFIT MODIFICATIONS.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—No modifications may be 
made that reduce the rate of future benefit ac-
crual or that reduce core benefits or adjustable 
benefits unless notice of such reduction has 
been given at least 180 days before the general 
effective date of such reduction for all partici-
pants and beneficiaries to— 
‘‘(i) plan participants and beneficiaries; 
‘‘(ii) each employer who has an obligation to 
contribute to the composite plan; and 
‘‘(iii) each employee organization which, for 
purposes of collective bargaining, represents 
plan participants employed by such employers. 
‘‘(B) CONTENT OF NOTICE.—The notice under 
subparagraph (A) shall contain— 
‘‘(i) sufficient information to enable partici-
pants and beneficiaries to understand the effect 
of any reduction on their benefits, including an 
illustration of any affected benefit or subsidy, 
on an annual or monthly basis that a partici-
pant or beneficiary would otherwise have been 
eligible for as of the general effective date de-
scribed in subparagraph (A); and 
‘‘(ii) information as to the rights and remedies 
of plan participants and beneficiaries as well as 
how to contact the Department of Labor for fur-
ther information and assistance, where appro-
priate.

subparagraph (A)— 
‘‘(i) shall be provided in a form and manner 
prescribed in regulations of the Secretary of 
Labor; 
‘‘(ii) shall be written in a manner so as to be 
understood by the average plan participant. 
‘‘(3) MODEL NOTICES.—The Secretary shall— 
‘‘(A) prescribe model notices that the plan 
sponsor of a composite plan may use to satisfy 
the notice requirements under this subsection; 
and 
‘‘(B) by regulation enumerate any details re-
lated to the elements listed in paragraph (1) that 
any notice under this subsection must include. 
‘‘(4) DELIVERY
METHOD.—Any notice under 
this part shall be provided in writing and may 
also be provided in electronic form to the extent 
that the form is reasonably accessible to persons 
to whom the notice is provided.

‘‘(1) the plan’s current funded ratio is at least 
110 percent (without regard to the benefit in-
crease or new benefits); 
‘‘(2) taking the benefit increase or new bene-
fits into account, the current funded ratio is at 
least 100 percent and the projected funded ratio 
for the current plan year is at least 120 percent; 
‘‘(3) in any case in which, after taking the 
benefit increase or new benefits into account, 
the current funded ratio is less than 140 percent 
and the projected funded ratio is less than 140 
percent, the benefit increase or new benefits are 
projected by the plan actuary to increase the 
present value of the plan’s liabilities for the 
plan year by not more than 3 percent; and 
‘‘(4) expected contributions for the current 
plan year are at least 120 percent of normal cost 
for the plan year, determined using the unit 
credit funding method and treating the benefit 
increase or new benefits as in effect for the en-
tire plan year. 
‘‘(b) ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS WHERE CORE 
BENEFITS REDUCED.—If a plan has been amend-
ed to reduce core benefits pursuant to a realign-
ment program under section 803(a)(2)(D), such 
plan may not be subsequently amended to in-
crease core benefits unless the amendment— 
‘‘(1) increases the level of future benefit pay-
ments only; and 
‘‘(2) provides for an equitable distribution of 
benefit increases across the participant and ben-
eficiary population, taking into account the ex-
tent to which the benefits of participants were 
previously reduced pursuant to such realign-
ment program. 
‘‘(c) EXCEPTION TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE 
LAW.—Subsection (a) shall not apply in connec-
tion with a plan amendment if the amendment 
is required as a condition of qualification under 
part I of subchapter D of chapter 1 of the Inter-
nal Revenue Code of 1986 or to comply with 
other applicable law. 
‘‘(d) EXCEPTION WHERE MAXIMUM DEDUCT-
IBLE LIMIT APPLIES.—Subsection (a) shall not 
apply in connection with a plan amendment if 
and to the extent that contributions to the com-
posite plan would not be deductible for the plan 
year under section 404(a)(1)(E) of the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986 if the plan amendment is 
not adopted. 
‘‘(e) EXCEPTION FOR CERTAIN BENEFIT MODI-
FICATIONS.—Subsection (a) shall not apply in 
connection with a plan amendment under sec-
tion 803(a)(5)(C), regarding conditional benefit 
modifications. 
‘‘(f) TREATMENT OF PLAN AMENDMENTS.—For 
purposes of this section— 
‘‘(1) if two or more plan amendments increas-
ing benefits or establishing new benefits are 
adopted in a plan year, such amendments shall 
be treated as a single amendment adopted on 
the last day of the plan year; 
‘‘(2) all benefit increases and new benefits 
adopted in a single amendment are treated as a 
single benefit increase, irrespective of whether 
the increases and new benefits take effect in 
more than one plan year; and 
‘‘(3) increases in contributions or decreases in 
plan liabilities which are scheduled to take ef-
fect in future plan years may be taken into ac-
count in connection with a plan amendment if 
they have been agreed to in writing or otherwise 
formalized by the date the plan amendment is 
adopted. 
‘‘SEC. 805. COMPOSITE PLAN RESTRICTIONS TO 
PRESERVE LEGACY PLAN FUNDING. 
‘‘(a) TREATMENT AS A LEGACY PLAN.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—For purposes of this part 
and parts 2 and 3, a defined benefit plan shall 
be treated as a legacy plan with respect to the 
composite plan under which the employees who 
were eligible to accrue a benefit under the de-
fined benefit plan become eligible to accrue a 
benefit under such composite plan. 
‘‘(2) COMPONENT
PLANS.—In any case in 
which a defined benefit plan is amended to add 
a composite plan component pursuant to section 
801(b), paragraph (1) shall be applied by sub-
stituting ‘defined benefit component’ for ‘de-
fined benefit plan’ and ‘composite plan compo-
nent’ for ‘composite plan’. 
‘‘(3) ELIGIBLE
TO
ACCRUE
A
BENEFIT.—For 
purposes of paragraph (1), an employee is con-
sidered eligible to accrue a benefit under a com-
posite plan as of the first day in which the em-
ployee completes an hour of service under a col-
lective bargaining agreement that provides for 
contributions to and accruals under the com-
posite plan in lieu of accruals under the legacy 
plan. 
‘‘(4) COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT.—As 
used in this part, the term ‘collective bargaining 
agreement’ includes any agreement under which 
an employer has an obligation to contribute to 
a plan. 
‘‘(5) OTHER
TERMS.—Any term used in this 
part which is not defined in this part and which 
is also used in section 305 shall have the same 
meaning provided such term in such section. 
‘‘(b) RESTRICTIONS ON ACCEPTANCE BY COM-
POSITE PLAN
OF AGREEMENTS
AND CONTRIBU-
TIONS.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—The plan sponsor of a com-
posite plan shall not accept or recognize a col-
lective bargaining agreement (or any modifica-
tion to such agreement), and no contributions 
may be accepted and no benefits may be accrued 
or otherwise earned under the agreement— 
‘‘(A) in any case in which the plan actuary of 
any defined benefit plan that would be treated 
as a legacy plan with respect to such composite 
plan has certified under section 305(b)(3) that 
such defined benefit plan is or will be in critical 
status for the plan year in which such agree-
ment would take effect or for any of the suc-
ceeding 5 plan years; and 
‘‘(B) unless the agreement requires each em-
ployer who is a party to such agreement, includ-
ing employers whose employees are not partici-
pants in the legacy plan, to provide contribu-
tions to the legacy plan with respect to such 
composite plan in a manner that satisfies the 
transition contribution requirements of sub-
section (d). 
‘‘(2) NOTICE.—Not later than 30 days after a 
determination by a plan sponsor of a composite 
plan that an agreement fails to satisfy the re-
quirements described in paragraph (1), the plan 
sponsor shall provide notification of such fail-
ure and the reasons for such determination— 
‘‘(A) to the parties to the agreement; 
‘‘(B) to active participants of the composite 
plan who have ceased to accrue or otherwise 
earn benefits with respect to service with an em-
ployer pursuant to paragraph (1); and 
‘‘(C) to the Secretary, the Secretary of the 
Treasury, and the Pension Benefit Guaranty 
Corporation. 
‘‘(3) LIMITATION
ON
RETROACTIVE
EFFECT.— 
This subsection shall not apply to benefits ac-
crued before the date on which notice is pro-
vided under paragraph (2). 
‘‘(c) RESTRICTION ON ACCRUAL OF BENEFITS 
UNDER A COMPOSITE PLAN.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—In any case in which an 
employer, under a collective bargaining agree-
ment entered into after the date of enactment of 
the Giving Retirement Options to Workers Act of 
2020, ceases to have an obligation to contribute 
to a multiemployer defined benefit plan, no em-
ployees employed by the employer may accrue or 
otherwise earn benefits under any composite 
plan, with respect to service with that employer, 
for a 60-month period beginning on the date on 
which the employer entered into such collective 
bargaining agreement. 
‘‘(2) NOTICE OF CESSATION OF OBLIGATION.— 
Within 30 days of determining that an employer 
has ceased to have an obligation to contribute to 
a legacy plan with respect to employees em-
ployed by an employer that is or will be contrib-
uting to a composite plan with respect to service 
of such employees, the plan sponsor of the leg-
acy plan shall notify the plan sponsor of the 
composite plan of that cessation. 
‘‘(3) NOTICE OF CESSATION OF ACCRUALS.—Not 
later than 30 days after determining that an em-
ployer has ceased to have an obligation to con-
tribute to a legacy plan, the plan sponsor of the 
composite plan shall notify the bargaining par-
ties, the active participants affected by the ces-
sation of accruals, the Secretary, the Secretary 
of the Treasury, and the Pension Benefit Guar-
anty Corporation of the cessation of accruals, 
the period during which such cessation is in ef-
fect, and the reasons therefor. 
‘‘(4) LIMITATION
ON
RETROACTIVE
EFFECT.— 
This subsection shall not apply to benefits ac-
crued before the date on which notice is pro-
vided under paragraph (3). 
‘‘(d) 
TRANSITION
CONTRIBUTION
REQUIRE-
MENTS.— 
‘‘(1) IN
GENERAL.—A collective bargaining 
agreement satisfies the transition contribution 
requirements of this subsection if the agree-
ment— 
‘‘(A) authorizes payment of contributions to a 
legacy plan at a rate or rates equal to or greater 
than the transition contribution rate established 
by the legacy plan under paragraph (2); and 
‘‘(B) does not provide for— 
‘‘(i) a suspension of contributions to the leg-
acy plan with respect to any period of service; 
or 
‘‘(ii) any new direct or indirect exclusion of 
younger or newly hired employees of the em-
ployer from being taken into account in deter-
mining contributions owed to the legacy plan. 
‘‘(2) TRANSITION CONTRIBUTION RATE.— 
‘‘(A) IN
GENERAL.—The transition contribu-
tion rate for a plan year is the contribution rate 
that, as certified by the actuary of the legacy 
plan in accordance with the principles in sec-
tion 305(b)(3)(B), is reasonably expected to be 
adequate— 
‘‘(i) to fund the normal cost for the plan year; 
‘‘(ii) to amortize the plan’s unfunded liabil-
ities in level annual installments over 25 years, 
beginning with the plan year in which the tran-
sition contribution rate is first established; and 
‘‘(iii) to amortize any subsequent changes in 
the legacy plan’s unfunded liability due to expe-
rience gains or losses (including investment 
gains or losses, gains or losses due to contribu-
tions greater or less than the contributions made 
under the prior transition contribution rate, and 
other actuarial gains or losses), changes in ac-
tuarial assumptions, changes to the legacy 
plan’s benefits, or changes in funding method 
over a period of 15 plan years beginning with 
the plan year in which such change in un-
funded liability is incurred. 
The transition contribution rate for any plan 
year may not be less than the transition con-
tribution rate for the plan year in which such 
rate is first established. 
‘‘(B) MULTIPLE RATES.—If different rates of 
contribution are payable to the legacy plan by 
different employers or for different classes of 
employees, the certification shall specify a tran-
sition contribution rate for each such employer. 
‘‘(C) RATE APPLICABLE TO EMPLOYER.— 
‘‘(i) IN
GENERAL.—Except as provided by 
clause (ii), the transition contribution rate ap-
plicable to an employer for a plan year is the 
rate in effect for the plan year of the legacy 
plan that commences on or after 180 days before 
the earlier of— 
‘‘(I) the effective date of the collective bar-
gaining agreement pursuant to which the em-
ployer contributes to the legacy plan; or 
‘‘(II) 5 years after the last plan year for which 
the transition contribution rate applicable to the 
employer was established or updated. 
‘‘(ii) EXCEPTION.—The transition contribution 
rate applicable to an employer for the first plan 
year beginning on or after the commencement of 
the employer’s obligation to contribute to the 
composite plan is the rate in effect for the plan 
year of the legacy plan that commences on or 
after 180 days before such first plan year. 
‘‘(D) EFFECT OF LEGACY PLAN FINANCIAL CIR-
CUMSTANCES.—If the plan actuary of the legacy 
plan has certified under section 305 that the 
plan is in endangered or critical status for a

plan year, the transition contribution rate for 
the following plan year is the rate determined 
with respect to the employer under the legacy 
plan’s funding improvement or rehabilitation 
plan under section 305, if greater than the rate 
otherwise determined, but in no event greater 
than 75 percent of the sum of the contribution 
rates applicable to the legacy plan and the com-
posite plan for the plan year. 
‘‘(E) OTHER
ACTUARIAL
ASSUMPTIONS
AND 
METHODS.—Except as provided in subparagraph 
(A), the determination of the transition con-
tribution rate for a plan year shall be based on 
actuarial assumptions and methods consistent 
with the minimum funding determinations made 
under section 304 (or, if applicable, section 305) 
with respect to the legacy plan for the plan 
year. 
‘‘(F) ADJUSTMENTS IN RATE.—The plan spon-
sor of a legacy plan from time to time may ad-
just the transition contribution rate or rates ap-
plicable to an employer under this paragraph by 
increasing some rates and decreasing others if 
the actuary certifies that such adjusted rates in 
combination will produce projected contribution 
income for the plan year beginning on or after 
the date of certification that is not less than 
would be produced by the transition contribu-
tion rates in effect at the time of the certifi-
cation. 
‘‘(G) NOTICE
OF
TRANSITION
CONTRIBUTION 
RATE.—The plan sponsor of a legacy plan shall 
provide notice to the parties to collective bar-
gaining agreements pursuant to which contribu-
tions are made to the legacy plan of changes to 
the transition contribution rate requirements at 
least 30 days before the beginning of the plan 
year for which the rate is effective. 
‘‘(H) NOTICE TO COMPOSITE PLAN SPONSOR.— 
Not later than 30 days after a determination by 
the plan sponsor of a legacy plan that a collec-
tive bargaining agreement provides for a rate of 
contributions that is below the transition con-
tribution rate applicable to one or more employ-
ers that are parties to the collective bargaining 
agreement, the plan sponsor of the legacy plan 
shall notify the plan sponsor of any composite 
plan under which employees of such employer 
would otherwise be eligible to accrue a benefit. 
‘‘(3) CORRECTION
PROCEDURES.—Pursuant to 
standards prescribed by the Secretary, the plan 
sponsor of a composite plan shall adopt rules 
and procedures that give the parties to the col-
lective bargaining agreement notice of the fail-
ure of such agreement to satisfy the transition 
contribution requirements of this subsection, 
and a reasonable opportunity to correct such 
failure, not to exceed 180 days from the date of 
notice given under subsection (b)(2). 
‘‘(4) SUPPLEMENTAL
CONTRIBUTIONS.—A col-
lective bargaining agreement may provide for 
supplemental contributions to the legacy plan 
for a plan year in excess of the transition con-
tribution rate determined under paragraph (2), 
regardless of whether the legacy plan is in en-
dangered or critical status for such plan year. 
‘‘(e) NONAPPLICATION OF COMPOSITE PLAN RE-
STRICTIONS.— 
‘‘(1) IN
GENERAL.—The provisions of sub-
sections (a), (b), and (c) shall not apply with re-
spect to a collective bargaining agreement, to 
the extent the agreement, or a predecessor 
agreement, provides or provided for contribu-
tions to a defined benefit plan that is a legacy 
plan, as of the first day of the first plan year 
following a plan year for which the plan actu-
ary certifies that the plan is fully funded, has 
been fully funded for at least three out of the 
immediately preceding 5 plan years, and is pro-
jected to remain fully funded for at least the fol-
lowing 4 plan years. 
‘‘(2) DETERMINATION
OF
FULLY
FUNDED.—A 
plan is fully funded for purposes of paragraph 
(1) if, as of the valuation date of the plan for a 
plan year, the value of the plan’s assets equals 
or exceeds the present value of the plan’s liabil-
ities, determined in accordance with the rules 
prescribed by the Pension Benefit Guaranty 
Corporation under sections 4219(c)(1)(D) and 
4281 for multiemployer plans terminating by 
mass withdrawal, as in effect for the date of the 
determination, except the plan’s reasonable as-
sumption regarding the starting date of benefits 
may be used. 
‘‘(3) OTHER
APPLICABLE
RULES.—Except as 
provided in paragraph (2), actuarial determina-
tions and projections under this section shall be 
based on the rules in section 305(b)(3) and sec-
tion 802(b). 
‘‘SEC. 806. MERGERS AND ASSET TRANSFERS OF 
COMPOSITE PLANS. 
‘‘(a) IN GENERAL.—Assets and liabilities of a 
composite plan may only be merged with, or 
transferred to, another plan if— 
‘‘(1) the other plan is a composite plan; 
‘‘(2) the plan or plans resulting from the merg-
er or transfer is a composite plan; 
‘‘(3) no participant’s accrued benefit or ad-
justable benefit is lower immediately after the 
transaction than it was immediately before the 
transaction; and 
‘‘(4) the value of the assets transferred in the 
case of a transfer reasonably reflects the value 
of the amounts contributed with respect to the 
participants whose benefits are being trans-
ferred, adjusted for allocable distributions, in-
vestment gains and losses, and administrative 
expenses. 
‘‘(b) LEGACY PLAN.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—After a merger or transfer 
involving a composite plan, the legacy plan with 
respect to an employer that is obligated to con-
tribute to the resulting composite plan is the leg-
acy plan that applied to that employer imme-
diately before the merger or transfer. 
‘‘(2) MULTIPLE LEGACY PLANS.—If an employer 
is obligated to contribute to more than one leg-
acy plan with respect to employees eligible to 
accrue benefits under more than one composite 
plan and there is a merger or transfer of such 
legacy plans, the transition contribution rate 
applicable to the legacy plan resulting from the 
merger or transfer with respect to that employer 
shall be determined in accordance with the pro-
visions of section 805(d)(2)(B).’’. 
(2) PENALTIES.— 
(A) CIVIL ENFORCEMENT OF FAILURE TO COM-
PLY

of the realignment program in accordance with 
the requirements of such section, 
by the Secretary, by an employer that has an

to adopt a realignment program, or to update or 
comply with the terms of the realignment pro-
gram, in accordance with the requirements of 
such section and the realignment program.’’. 
(B) CIVIL PENALTIES.—Section 502(c) of such

penalty of not more than $100 per day for each 
violation by such sponsor of the requirement 
under section 803(b) to provide notice as de-
scribed in such section, except that no penalty 
may be assessed in any case in which the plan 
sponsor exercised reasonable diligence to meet 
the requirements of such section and— 
‘‘(i) the plan sponsor did not know that the 
violation existed; or 
‘‘(ii) the plan sponsor provided such notice 
during the 30-day period beginning on the first 
date on which the plan sponsor knew, or in ex-
ercising reasonable due diligence should have 
known, that such violation existed. 
‘‘(B) In any case in which the plan sponsor 
exercised reasonable diligence to meet the re-
quirements of section 803(b)— 
‘‘(i) the total penalty assessed under this 
paragraph against such sponsor for a plan year

‘‘(b) TRANSITION FROM A MULTIEMPLOYER DE-
FINED BENEFIT PLAN.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—The plan sponsor of a de-
fined benefit plan that is a multiemployer plan 
may, subject to paragraph (2), amend the plan 
to incorporate the features of a composite plan 
as a component of the multiemployer plan sepa-
rate from the defined benefit plan component, 
except in the case of a defined benefit plan for 
which the plan actuary has certified under sec-
tion 432(b)(3) that the plan is or will be in crit-
ical status for the plan year in which such 
amendment would become effective or for any of 
the succeeding 5 plan years. 
‘‘(2) REQUIREMENTS.—Any amendment pursu-
ant to paragraph (1) to incorporate the features 
of a composite plan as a component of a multi-
employer plan shall— 
‘‘(A) apply with respect to all collective bar-
gaining agreements providing for contributions 
to the multiemployer plan on or after the effec-
tive date of the amendment, 
‘‘(B) apply with respect to all participants in

lowing the date of the adoption of the amend-
ment, except that the plan sponsor may alter-

with respect to each collective bargaining agree-
ment under which contributions to the multiem-
ployer plan are required, which shall occur on 
the first day of the first plan year beginning 
after the termination, or if earlier, the re-open-
ing, of each such agreement, or such earlier date 
as the parties to the agreement and the plan 
sponsor of the multiemployer plan shall agree 
to, and 
‘‘(ii) not later than the first day of the fifth 
plan year beginning on or after the date of the 
adoption of the amendment, 
‘‘(D) specify that, as of the amendment’s ef-

tive date, the plan sponsor of the multiemployer 
plan shall be the plan sponsor of both the com-
posite plan component and the defined benefit 
plan component of the plan.

is amended pursuant to paragraph (1)— 
‘‘(A) the requirements of this title shall be ap-
plied to the composite plan component and the 
defined benefit plan component of the multiem-
ployer plan as if each such component were 
maintained as a separate plan, and 
‘‘(B) the assets of the composite plan compo-
nent and the defined benefit plan component of 
the plan shall be held in a single trust forming 
part of the plan under which the trust instru-
ment expressly provides—

records) to be maintained to reflect the interest 
which each of the plan components has in the 
trust, including separate accounting for addi-
tions to the trust for the benefit of each plan 
component, disbursements made from each plan 
component’s account in the trust, investment ex-
perience of the trust allocable to that account, 
and administrative expenses (whether direct ex-
penses or shared expenses allocated proportion-
ally), and permits, but does not require, the 
pooling of some or all of the assets of the two 
plan components for investment purposes, and 
‘‘(ii) that the assets of each of the two plan 
components shall be held, invested, reinvested, 
managed, administered and distributed for the 
exclusive benefit of the participants and bene-
ficiaries of each such plan component, and in

ponents be available to pay benefits due under 
the other plan component.

A
TERMINATION
EVENT.—Notwith-
standing section 4041A of the Employee Retire-
ment Income Security Act of 1974, an amend-
ment pursuant to paragraph (1) to incorporate

of a multiemployer plan does not constitute ter-
mination of the multiemployer plan. 
‘‘(5) NOTICE TO THE SECRETARY.— 
‘‘(A) NOTICE.—The plan sponsor of a com-
posite plan shall provide notice to the Secretary 
of the intent to establish the composite plan (or, 
in the case of a composite plan incorporated as 
a component of a multiemployer plan as de-
scribed in paragraph (1), the intent to amend 
the multiemployer plan to incorporate such com-
posite plan) at least 30 days prior to the effec-
tive date of such establishment or amendment. 
‘‘(B) CERTIFICATION.—In the case of a com-
posite plan incorporated as a component of a 
multiemployer plan as described in paragraph 
(1), such notice shall include a certification by 
the plan actuary under section 432(b)(3) that 
the effective date of the amendment occurs in a 
plan year for which the multiemployer plan is 
not in critical status for that plan year and any 
of the succeeding 5 plan years. 
‘‘(6) REFERENCES TO COMPOSITE PLAN COMPO-
NENT.—As used in this subpart, the term ‘com-
posite plan’ includes a composite plan compo-
nent added to a defined benefit plan pursuant 
to paragraph (1). 
‘‘(7) 
RULE
OF
CONSTRUCTION.—Paragraph 
(2)(A) shall not be construed as preventing the 
plan sponsor of a multiemployer plan from 
adopting an amendment pursuant to paragraph 
(1) because some collective bargaining agree-
ments are amended to cease any covered em-
ployer’s obligation to contribute to the multiem-
ployer plan before or after the plan amendment 
is effective. Paragraph (2)(B) shall not be con-
strued as preventing the plan sponsor of a mul-
tiemployer plan from adopting an amendment 
pursuant to paragraph (1) because some partici-
pants cease to have contributions made to the 
multiemployer plan on their behalf before or 
after the plan amendment is effective. 
‘‘(c) COORDINATION WITH FUNDING RULES.— 
Except as otherwise provided in this title, sec-
tions 412, 431, and 432 shall not apply to a com-
posite plan. 
‘‘(d) TREATMENT OF A COMPOSITE PLAN.—For 
purposes of this title (other than sections 412 
and 418E), a composite plan shall be treated as 
if it were a defined benefit plan unless a dif-
ferent treatment is provided for under applicable 
law. 
‘‘SEC. 438. FUNDED RATIOS; ACTUARIAL ASSUMP-
TIONS. 
‘‘(a) CERTIFICATION OF FUNDED RATIOS.— 
‘‘(1) IN
GENERAL.—Not later than the one- 
hundred twentieth day of each plan year of a 
composite plan, the plan actuary of the com-
posite plan shall certify to the Secretary, the 
Secretary of Labor, and the plan sponsor the 
plan’s current funded ratio and projected fund-
ed ratio for the plan year. 
‘‘(2) DETERMINATION
OF
CURRENT
FUNDED 
RATIO AND PROJECTED FUNDED RATIO.—For pur-
poses of this section— 
‘‘(A) CURRENT
FUNDED
RATIO.—The current 
funded ratio is the ratio (expressed as a percent-
age) of— 
‘‘(i) the value of the plan’s assets as of the 
first day of the plan year, to 
‘‘(ii) the plan actuary’s best estimate of the 
present value of the plan liabilities as of the 
first day of the plan year. 
‘‘(B) PROJECTED
FUNDED
RATIO.—The pro-
jected funded ratio is the current funded ratio 
projected to the first day of the fifteenth plan 
year following the plan year for which the de-
termination is being made. 
‘‘(3) CONSIDERATION
OF
CONTRIBUTION
RATE 
INCREASES.—For purposes of projections under 
this subsection, the plan sponsor may anticipate 
contribution rate increases beyond the term of 
the current collective bargaining agreement and 
any agreed-to supplements, up to a maximum of 
2.5 percent per year, compounded annually, un-
less it would be unreasonable under the cir-
cumstances to assume that contributions would 
increase by that amount. 
‘‘(b) ACTUARIAL
ASSUMPTIONS
AND
METH-
ODS.—For purposes of this part— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—All costs, liabilities, rates of 
interest, and other factors under the plan shall 
be determined for a plan year on the basis of ac-
tuarial assumptions and methods— 
‘‘(A) each of which is reasonable (taking into 
account the experience of the plan and reason-
able expectations), 
‘‘(B) which, in combination, offer the actu-
ary’s best estimate of anticipated experience 
under the plan, and 
‘‘(C) with respect to which any change from 
the actuarial assumptions and methods used in 
the previous plan year shall be certified by the 
plan actuary and the actuarial rationale for 
such change provided in the annual report re-
quired by section 6058. 
‘‘(2) FAIR
MARKET
VALUE
OF
ASSETS.—The 
value of the plan’s assets shall be taken into ac-
count on the basis of their fair market value. 
‘‘(3) DETERMINATION
OF
NORMAL
COST
AND 
PLAN LIABILITIES.—A plan’s normal cost and li-
abilities shall be based on the most recent actu-
arial 
valuation 
required 
under 
section 
437(a)(5)(A) and the unit credit funding method. 
‘‘(4) TIME
WHEN
CERTAIN
CONTRIBUTIONS 
DEEMED MADE.—Any contributions for a plan 
year made by an employer after the last day of 
such plan year, but not later than two and one- 
half months after such day, shall be deemed to 
have been made on such last day. For purposes 
of this paragraph, such two and one-half month 
period may be extended for not more than six 
months under regulations prescribed by the Sec-
retary. 
‘‘(5) ADDITIONAL
ACTUARIAL
ASSUMPTIONS.— 
Except where otherwise provided in this sub-
part, the provisions of section 432(b)(3)(B) shall 
apply to any determination or projection under 
this subpart. 
‘‘SEC. 439. REALIGNMENT PROGRAM. 
‘‘(a) REALIGNMENT PROGRAM.— 
‘‘(1) ADOPTION.—In any case in which the 
plan actuary certifies under section 438(a) that 
the plan’s projected funded ratio is below 120 
percent for the plan year, the plan sponsor shall 
adopt a realignment program under paragraph 
(2) not later than 210 days after the due date of 
the certification required under section 438(a). 
The plan sponsor shall adopt an updated re-
alignment program for each succeeding plan

year for which a certification described in the 
preceding sentence is made. 
‘‘(2) CONTENT OF REALIGNMENT PROGRAM.— 
‘‘(A) IN
GENERAL.—A realignment program 
adopted under this paragraph is a written pro-
gram which consists of all reasonable measures, 
including options or a range of options to be un-
dertaken by the plan sponsor or proposed to the 
bargaining parties, formulated, based on reason-
ably anticipated experience and reasonable ac-
tuarial assumptions, to enable the plan to 
achieve a projected funded ratio of at least 120 
percent for the following plan year. 
‘‘(B) INITIAL
PROGRAM
ELEMENTS.—Reason-
able measures under a realignment program de-
scribed in subparagraph (A) may include any of 
the following: 
‘‘(i) Proposed contribution increases. 
‘‘(ii) A reduction in the rate of future benefit 
accruals, so long as the resulting rate shall not 
be less than 1 percent of the contributions on 
which benefits are based as of the start of the 
plan year (or the equivalent standard accrual 
rate as described in section 432(e)(6)). 
‘‘(iii) A modification or elimination of adjust-
able benefits of participants that are not in pay 
status before the date of the notice required 
under subsection (b)(1). 
‘‘(iv) Any other legally available measures not 
specifically described in this subparagraph or 
subparagraph (C) or (D) that the plan sponsor 
determines are reasonable. 
‘‘(C) ADDITIONAL PROGRAM ELEMENTS.—If the 
plan sponsor has determined that all reasonable 
measures available under subparagraph (B) will 
not enable the plan to achieve a projected fund-
ed ratio of at least 120 percent the following 
plan year, such reasonable measures may also 
include— 
‘‘(i) a reduction of accrued benefits that are 
not in pay status by the date of the notice re-
quired under subsection (b)(1), or 
‘‘(ii) a reduction of any benefits of partici-
pants that are in pay status before the date of 
the notice required under subsection (b)(1) other 
than core benefits as defined in paragraph (4). 
‘‘(D) ADDITIONAL REDUCTIONS.—In the case of 
a composite plan for which the plan sponsor has 
determined that all reasonable measures avail-
able under subparagraphs (B) and (C) will not 
enable the plan to achieve a projected funded 
ratio of at least 120 percent for the following 
plan year, such reasonable measures may also 
include— 
‘‘(i) a further reduction in the rate of future 
benefit accruals without regard to the limitation 
applicable under subparagraph (B)(ii), or 
‘‘(ii) a reduction of core benefits, 
provided that such reductions shall be equitably 
distributed across the participant and bene-
ficiary population, taking into account factors, 
with respect to participants and beneficiaries 
and their benefits, that may include one or more 
of the factors listed in subclauses (I) through 
(X) of section 432(e)(9)(D)(vi), to the extent nec-
essary to enable the plan to achieve a projected 
funded ratio of at least 120 percent for the fol-
lowing plan year, or at the election of the plan 
sponsor, a projected funded ratio of at least 100 
percent for the following plan year and a cur-
rent funded ratio of at least 90 percent. 
‘‘(3) ADJUSTABLE BENEFIT DEFINED.—For pur-
poses of this subpart, the term ‘adjustable ben-
efit’ means— 
‘‘(A) benefits, rights, and features under the 
plan, including post-retirement death benefits, 
60-month guarantees, disability benefits not yet 
in pay status, and similar benefits, 
‘‘(B) any early retirement benefit or retire-
ment-type subsidy (within the meaning of sec-
tion 411(d)(6)(B)(i)) and any benefit payment 
option (other than the qualified joint and sur-
vivor annuity), and 
‘‘(C) benefit increases that were adopted (or, 
if later, took effect) less than 60 months before 
the first day such realignment program took ef-
fect. 
‘‘(4) CORE BENEFIT DEFINED.—For purposes of 
this subpart, the term ‘core benefit’ means a 
participant’s accrued benefit payable in the nor-
mal form of an annuity commencing at normal 
retirement age, determined without regard to— 
‘‘(A) any early retirement benefits, retirement- 
type subsidies, or other benefits, rights, or fea-
tures that may be associated with that benefit, 
and 
‘‘(B) any cost-of-living adjustments or benefit 
increases effective after the date of retirement. 
‘‘(5) COORDINATION
WITH
CONTRIBUTION
IN-
CREASES.— 
‘‘(A) IN
GENERAL.—A realignment program 
may provide that some or all of the benefit modi-
fications described in the program will only take 
effect if the bargaining parties fail to agree to 
specified levels of increases in contributions to 
the plan, effective as of specified dates. 
‘‘(B) INDEPENDENT BENEFIT MODIFICATIONS.— 
If a realignment program adopts any changes to 
the benefit formula that are independent of po-
tential contribution increases, such changes 
shall take effect not later than 180 days fol-
lowing the first day of the first plan year that 
begins following the adoption of the realignment 
program. 
‘‘(C) CONDITIONAL BENEFIT MODIFICATIONS.— 
If a realignment program adopts any changes to 
the benefit formula that take effect only if the 
bargaining parties fail to agree to contribution 
increases, such changes shall take effect not 
later than the first day of the first plan year be-
ginning after the third anniversary of the date 
of adoption of the realignment program. 
‘‘(D) REVOCATION OF CERTAIN BENEFIT MODI-
FICATIONS.—Benefit modifications described in 
paragraph (3) may be revoked, in whole or in 
part, and retroactively or prospectively, when 
contributions to the plan are increased, as speci-
fied in the realignment program, including any 
amendments thereto. The preceding sentence 
shall not apply unless the contribution increases 
are to be effective not later than the fifth anni-
versary of the first day of the first plan year 
that begins after the adoption of the realign-
ment program. 
‘‘(b) NOTICE.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—In any case in which it is 
certified under section 438(a) that the projected 
funded ratio is less than 120 percent, the plan 
sponsor shall, not later than 30 days after the 
date of the certification, provide notification of 
the current and projected funded ratios to the 
participants and beneficiaries, the bargaining 
parties, and the Secretary. Such notice shall in-
clude— 
‘‘(A) an explanation that contribution rate in-
creases or benefit reductions may be necessary, 
‘‘(B) a description of the types of benefits that 
might be reduced, and 
‘‘(C) an estimate of the contribution increases 
and benefit reductions that may be necessary to 
achieve a projected funded ratio of 120 percent. 
‘‘(2) NOTICE OF BENEFIT MODIFICATIONS.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—No modifications may be 
made that reduce the rate of future benefit ac-
crual or that reduce core benefits or adjustable 
benefits unless notice of such reduction has 
been given at least 180 days before the general 
effective date of such reduction for all partici-
pants and beneficiaries to— 
‘‘(i) plan participants and beneficiaries, 
‘‘(ii) each employer who has an obligation to 
contribute to the composite plan, and 
‘‘(iii) each employee organization which, for 
purposes of collective bargaining, represents 
plan participants employed by such employers. 
‘‘(B) CONTENT OF NOTICE.—The notice under 
subparagraph (A) shall contain— 
‘‘(i) sufficient information to enable partici-
pants and beneficiaries to understand the effect 
of any reduction on their benefits, including an 
illustration of any affected benefit or subsidy, 
on an annual or monthly basis that a partici-
pant or beneficiary would otherwise have been 
eligible for as of the general effective date de-
scribed in subparagraph (A), and

cept as provided in subsections (c), (d), and (e), 
no plan amendment increasing benefits or estab-
lishing new benefits under a composite plan may 
be adopted for a plan year unless— 
‘‘(1) the plan’s current funded ratio is at least 
110 percent (without regard to the benefit in-
crease or new benefits), 
‘‘(2) taking the benefit increase or new bene-
fits into account, the current funded ratio is at 
least 100 percent and the projected funded ratio

benefit increase or new benefits into account, 
the current funded ratio is less than 140 percent 
or the projected funded ratio is less than 140 
percent, the benefit increase or new benefits are 
projected by the plan actuary to increase the 
present value of the plan’s liabilities for the

crease core benefits unless the amendment— 
‘‘(1) increases the level of future benefit pay-
ments only, and

‘‘SEC. 440A. COMPOSITE PLAN RESTRICTIONS TO 
PRESERVE LEGACY PLAN FUNDING. 
‘‘(a) TREATMENT AS A LEGACY PLAN.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—For purposes of this sub-
chapter, a defined benefit plan shall be treated 
as a legacy plan with respect to the composite 
plan under which the employees who were eligi-
ble to accrue a benefit under the defined benefit 
plan become eligible to accrue a benefit under 
such composite plan. 
‘‘(2) COMPONENT
PLANS.—In any case in 
which a defined benefit plan is amended to add 
a composite plan component pursuant to section 
437(b), paragraph (1) shall be applied by sub-
stituting ‘defined benefit component’ for ‘de-
fined benefit plan’ and ‘composite plan compo-
nent’ for ‘composite plan’. 
‘‘(3) ELIGIBLE
TO
ACCRUE
A
BENEFIT.—For 
purposes of paragraph (1), an employee is con-
sidered eligible to accrue a benefit under a com-
posite plan as of the first day in which the em-
ployee completes an hour of service under a col-
lective bargaining agreement that provides for 
contributions to and accruals under the com-
posite plan in lieu of accruals under the legacy 
plan. 
‘‘(4) COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT.—As 
used in this subpart, the term ‘collective bar-
gaining agreement’ includes any agreement 
under which an employer has an obligation to 
contribute to a plan. 
‘‘(5) OTHER
TERMS.—Any term used in this 
subpart which is not defined in this part and 
which is also used in section 432 shall have the 
same meaning provided such term in such sec-
tion. 
‘‘(b) RESTRICTIONS ON ACCEPTANCE BY COM-
POSITE PLAN
OF AGREEMENTS
AND CONTRIBU-
TIONS.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—The plan sponsor of a com-
posite plan shall not accept or recognize a col-
lective bargaining agreement (or any modifica-
tion to such agreement), and no contributions 
may be accepted and no benefits may be accrued 
or otherwise earned under the agreement— 
‘‘(A) in any case in which the plan actuary of 
any defined benefit plan that would be treated 
as a legacy plan with respect to such composite 
plan has certified under section 432(b)(3) that 
such defined benefit plan is or will be in critical 
status for the plan year in which such agree-
ment would take effect or for any of the suc-
ceeding 5 plan years, and 
‘‘(B) unless the agreement requires each em-
ployer who is a party to such agreement, includ-
ing employers whose employees are not partici-
pants in the legacy plan, to provide contribu-
tions to the legacy plan with respect to such 
composite plan in a manner that satisfies the 
transition contribution requirements of sub-
section (d). 
‘‘(2) NOTICE.—Not later than 30 days after a 
determination by a plan sponsor of a composite 
plan that an agreement fails to satisfy the re-
quirements described in paragraph (1), the plan 
sponsor shall provide notification of such fail-
ure and the reasons for such determination to— 
‘‘(A) the parties to the agreement, 
‘‘(B) active participants of the composite plan 
who have ceased to accrue or otherwise earn 
benefits with respect to service with an employer 
pursuant to paragraph (1), and 
‘‘(C) the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of 
the Treasury, and the Pension Benefit Guar-
anty Corporation. 
‘‘(3) LIMITATION
ON
RETROACTIVE
EFFECT.— 
This subsection shall not apply to benefits ac-
crued before the date on which notice is pro-
vided under paragraph (2). 
‘‘(c) RESTRICTION ON ACCRUAL OF BENEFITS 
UNDER A COMPOSITE PLAN.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—In any case in which an 
employer, under a collective bargaining agree-
ment entered into after the date of enactment of 
the Giving Retirement Options to Workers Act of 
2020, ceases to have an obligation to contribute 
to a multiemployer defined benefit plan, no em-
ployees employed by the employer may accrue or 
otherwise earn benefits under any composite 
plan, with respect to service with that employer, 
for a 60-month period beginning on the date on 
which the employer entered into such collective 
bargaining agreement. 
‘‘(2) NOTICE OF CESSATION OF OBLIGATION.— 
Within 30 days of determining that an employer 
has ceased to have an obligation to contribute to 
a legacy plan with respect to employees em-
ployed by an employer that is or will be contrib-
uting to a composite plan with respect to service 
of such employees, the plan sponsor of the leg-
acy plan shall notify the plan sponsor of the 
composite plan of that cessation. 
‘‘(3) NOTICE OF CESSATION OF ACCRUALS.—Not 
later than 30 days after determining that an em-
ployer has ceased to have an obligation to con-
tribute to a legacy plan, the plan sponsor of the 
composite plan shall notify the bargaining par-
ties, the active participants affected by the ces-
sation of accruals, the Secretary, the Secretary 
of Labor, and the Pension Benefit Guaranty 
Corporation of the cessation of accruals, the pe-
riod during which such cessation is in effect, 
and the reasons therefor. 
‘‘(4) LIMITATION
ON
RETROACTIVE
EFFECT.— 
This subsection shall not apply to benefits ac-
crued before the date on which notice is pro-
vided under paragraph (3). 
‘‘(d) 
TRANSITION
CONTRIBUTION
REQUIRE-
MENTS.— 
‘‘(1) IN
GENERAL.—A collective bargaining 
agreement satisfies the transition contribution 
requirements of this subsection if the agree-
ment— 
‘‘(A) authorizes for payment of contributions 
to a legacy plan at a rate or rates equal to or 
greater than the transition contribution rate es-
tablished under paragraph (2), and 
‘‘(B) does not provide for— 
‘‘(i) a suspension of contributions to the leg-
acy plan with respect to any period of service, 
or 
‘‘(ii) any new direct or indirect exclusion of 
younger or newly hired employees of the em-
ployer from being taken into account in deter-
mining contributions owed to the legacy plan. 
‘‘(2) TRANSITION CONTRIBUTION RATE.— 
‘‘(A) IN
GENERAL.—The transition contribu-
tion rate for a plan year is the contribution rate 
that, as certified by the actuary of the legacy 
plan in accordance with the principles in sec-
tion 432(b)(3)(B), is reasonably expected to be 
adequate— 
‘‘(i) to fund the normal cost for the plan year, 
‘‘(ii) to amortize the plan’s unfunded liabil-
ities in level annual installments over 25 years, 
beginning with the plan year in which the tran-
sition contribution rate is first established, and 
‘‘(iii) to amortize any subsequent changes in 
the legacy plan’s unfunded liability due to expe-
rience gains or losses (including investment 
gains or losses, gains or losses due to contribu-
tions greater or less than the contributions made 
under the prior transition contribution rate, and 
other actuarial gains or losses), changes in ac-
tuarial assumptions, changes to the legacy 
plan’s benefits, or changes in funding method 
over a period of 15 plan years beginning with 
the plan year in which such change in un-
funded liability is incurred. 
The transition contribution rate for any plan 
year may not be less than the transition con-
tribution rate for the plan year in which such 
rate is first established. 
‘‘(B) MULTIPLE RATES.—If different rates of 
contribution are payable to the legacy plan by 
different employers or for different classes of 
employees, the certification shall specify a tran-
sition contribution rate for each such employer. 
‘‘(C) RATE APPLICABLE TO EMPLOYER.— 
‘‘(i) IN
GENERAL.—Except as provided by 
clause (ii), the transition contribution rate ap-
plicable to an employer for a plan year is the 
rate in effect for the plan year of the legacy 
plan that commences on or after 180 days before 
the earlier of— 
‘‘(I) the effective date of the collective bar-
gaining agreement pursuant to which the em-
ployer contributes to the legacy plan, or 
‘‘(II) 5 years after the last plan year for which 
the transition contribution rate applicable to the 
employer was established or updated. 
‘‘(ii) EXCEPTION.—The transition contribution 
rate applicable to an employer for the first plan 
year beginning on or after the commencement of 
the employer’s obligation to contribute to the 
composite plan is the rate in effect for the plan 
year of the legacy plan that commences on or 
after 180 days before such first plan year. 
‘‘(D) EFFECT OF LEGACY PLAN FINANCIAL CIR-
CUMSTANCES.—If the plan actuary of the legacy 
plan has certified under section 432 that the 
plan is in endangered or critical status for a 
plan year, the transition contribution rate for 
the following plan year is the rate determined 
with respect to the employer under the legacy 
plan’s funding improvement or rehabilitation 
plan under section 432, if greater than the rate 
otherwise determined, but in no event greater 
than 75 percent of the sum of the contribution 
rates applicable to the legacy plan and the com-
posite plan for the plan year. 
‘‘(E) OTHER
ACTUARIAL
ASSUMPTIONS
AND 
METHODS.—Except as provided in subparagraph 
(A), the determination of the transition con-
tribution rate for a plan year shall be based on 
actuarial assumptions and methods consistent 
with the minimum funding determinations made 
under section 431 (or, if applicable, section 432) 
with respect to the legacy plan for the plan 
year. 
‘‘(F) ADJUSTMENTS IN RATE.—The plan spon-
sor of a legacy plan from time to time may ad-
just the transition contribution rate or rates ap-
plicable to an employer under this paragraph by 
increasing some rates and decreasing others if 
the actuary certifies that such adjusted rates in 
combination will produce projected contribution 
income for the plan year beginning on or after 
the date of certification that is not less than 
would be produced by the transition contribu-
tion rates in effect at the time of the certifi-
cation. 
‘‘(G) NOTICE
OF
TRANSITION
CONTRIBUTION 
RATE.—The plan sponsor of a legacy plan shall 
provide notice to the parties to collective bar-
gaining agreements pursuant to which contribu-
tions are made to the legacy plan of changes to 
the transition contribution rate requirements at 
least 30 days before the beginning of the plan 
year for which the rate is effective. 
‘‘(H) NOTICE TO COMPOSITE PLAN SPONSOR.— 
Not later than 30 days after a determination by 
the plan sponsor of a legacy plan that a collec-
tive bargaining agreement provides for a rate of 
contributions that is below the transition con-
tribution rate applicable to one or more employ-
ers that are parties to the collective bargaining 
agreement, the plan sponsor of the legacy plan 
shall notify the plan sponsor of any composite 
plan under which employees of such employer 
would otherwise be eligible to accrue a benefit. 
‘‘(3) CORRECTION
PROCEDURES.—Pursuant to 
standards prescribed by the Secretary of Labor, 
the plan sponsor of a composite plan shall adopt 
rules and procedures that give the parties to the 
collective bargaining agreement notice of the 
failure of such agreement to satisfy the transi-
tion contribution requirements of this sub-
section, and a reasonable opportunity to correct

date of notice given under subsection (b)(2). 
‘‘(4) SUPPLEMENTAL
CONTRIBUTIONS.—A col-
lective bargaining agreement may provide for 
supplemental contributions to the legacy plan 
for a plan year in excess of the transition con-
tribution rate determined under paragraph (2), 
regardless of whether the legacy plan is in en-
dangered or critical status for such plan year. 
‘‘(e) NONAPPLICATION OF COMPOSITE PLAN RE-
STRICTIONS.— 
‘‘(1) IN
GENERAL.—The provisions of sub-
sections (a), (b), and (c) shall not apply with re-
spect to a collective bargaining agreement, to 
the extent the agreement, or a predecessor 
agreement, provides or provided for contribu-
tions to a defined benefit plan that is a legacy 
plan, as of the first day of the first plan year 
following a plan year for which the plan actu-
ary certifies that the plan is fully funded, has 
been fully funded for at least three out of the 
immediately preceding 5 plan years, and is pro-
jected to remain fully funded for at least the fol-
lowing 4 plan years. 
‘‘(2) DETERMINATION
OF
FULLY
FUNDED.—A 
plan is fully funded for purposes of paragraph 
(1) if, as of the valuation date of the plan for a 
plan year, the value of the plan’s assets equals 
or exceeds the present value of the plan’s liabil-
ities, determined in accordance with the rules 
prescribed by the Pension Benefit Guaranty 
Corporation under sections 4219(c)(1)(D) and 
4281 of Employee Retirement Income and Secu-
rity Act for multiemployer plans terminating by 
mass withdrawal, as in effect for the date of the 
determination, except the plan’s reasonable as-
sumption regarding the starting date of benefits 
may be used. 
‘‘(3) OTHER
APPLICABLE
RULES.—Except as 
provided in paragraph (2), actuarial determina-
tions and projections under this section shall be 
based on the rules in section 432(b)(3) and sec-
tion 438(b).

er or transfer is a composite plan, 
‘‘(3) no participant’s accrued benefit or ad-
justable benefit is lower immediately after the 
transaction than it was immediately before the 
transaction, and 
‘‘(4) the value of the assets transferred in the 
case of a transfer reasonably reflects the value 
of the amounts contributed with respect to the 
participants whose benefits are being trans-
ferred, adjusted for allocable distributions, in-
vestment gains and losses, and administrative 
expenses. 
‘‘(b) LEGACY PLAN.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—After a merger or transfer 
involving a composite plan, the legacy plan with 
respect to an employer that is obligated to con-
tribute to the resulting composite plan is the leg-
acy plan that applied to that employer imme-
diately before the merger or transfer. 
‘‘(2) MULTIPLE LEGACY PLANS.—If an employer 
is obligated to contribute to more than one leg-
acy plan with respect to employees eligible to 
accrue benefits under more than one composite 
plan and there is a merger or transfer of such 
legacy plans, the transition contribution rate 
applicable to the legacy plan resulting from the 
merger or transfer with respect to that employer 
shall be determined in accordance with the pro-
visions of section 440A(d)(2)(B).’’.

manner such that the number of weeks (the 
maximum benefit entitlement), or the average 
weekly benefit amount, of regular compensation 
which will be payable during the period of the

TITLE VI—COVID–19 COMPASSION AND 
MARTHA WRIGHT PRISON PHONE JUSTICE 
SEC. 601. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Prison, jails, and other confinement facili-
ties in the United States have unique tele-
communications needs due to safety and secu-
rity concerns. 
(2) Unjust and unreasonable charges for tele-
phone and advanced communications services in 
confinement facilities negatively impact the 
safety and security of communities in the 
United States by damaging relationships be-
tween incarcerated persons and their support 
systems, thereby exacerbating recidivism. 
(3) The COVID–19 pandemic has greatly in-
tensified these concerns. Jails and prisons have 
become epicenters for the spread of the virus, 
with incarcerated persons concentrated in small, 
confined spaces and often without access to 
adequate health care. At Cook County jail 
alone, hundreds of incarcerated persons and jail 
staff have tested positive for the virus since its 
outbreak. 
(4) To prevent the spread of the virus, many 
jails and prisons across the country suspended 
public visitation, leaving confinement facility 
communications services as the only way that 
incarcerated persons can stay in touch with 
their families. 
(5) All people in the United States, including 
anyone who pays for confinement facility com-
munications services, should have access to com-
munications services at charges that are just 
and reasonable. 
(6) Unemployment has risen sharply as a re-
sult of the COVID–19 pandemic, straining the 
incomes of millions of Americans and making it 
even more difficult for families of incarcerated 
persons to pay the high costs of confinement fa-
cility communications services. 
(7) Certain markets for confinement facility 
communications services are distorted due to re-
verse competition, in which the financial inter-
ests of the entity making the buying decision 
(the confinement facility) are aligned with the 
seller (the provider of confinement facility com-
munications services) and not the consumer (the 
incarcerated person or a member of his or her 
family). This reverse competition occurs because 
site commission payments to the confinement fa-
cility from the provider of confinement facility 
communications services are the chief criterion 
many facilities use to select their provider of 
confinement facility communications services. 
(8) Charges for confinement facility commu-
nications services that have been shown to be 
unjust and unreasonable are often a result of 
site commission payments that far exceed the 
costs incurred by the confinement facility in ac-
commodating these services. 
(9) Unjust and unreasonable charges have 
been assessed for both audio and video services 
and for both intrastate and interstate commu-
nications from confinement facilities. 
(10) Though Congress enacted emergency leg-
islation to allow free communications in Federal 
prisons during the pandemic, it does not cover 
communications to or from anyone incarcerated 
in State and local prisons or jails. 
(11) Mrs. Martha Wright-Reed led a campaign 
for just communications rates for incarcerated 
people for over a decade. 
(12) Mrs. Wright-Reed was the lead plaintiff 
in Wright v. Corrections Corporation of Amer-
ica, CA No. 00–293 (GK) (D.D.C. 2001). 
(13) That case ultimately led to the Wright Pe-
tition at the Federal Communications Commis-
sion, CC Docket No. 96–128 (November 3, 2003). 
(14) As a grandmother, Mrs. Wright-Reed was 
forced to choose between purchasing medication 
and 
communicating 
with 
her 
incarcerated 
grandson. 
(15) Mrs. Wright-Reed passed away on Janu-
ary 18, 2015, before fully realizing her dream of 
just communications rates for all people.

bearance or that the borrower is no longer expe-
riencing a financial hardship that prevents the 
borrower from making timely mortgage pay-
ments due, directly or indirectly, to the COVID–

connection with a forbearance, provided that a 
servicer may offer the borrower a modification 
option at the end of a forbearance period grant-
ed hereunder that includes the capitalization of 
past due principal and interest and escrow pay-
ments as long as the principal and interest pay-
ment of the borrower under such modification 
remains at or below the contractual principal 
and interest payments owed under the terms of 
the mortgage contract before such forbearance 
period except as the result of a change in the 
index of an adjustable rate mortgage, or, in the

ant with applicable Federal Housing Adminis-
tration policies.

nancial hardship that prevents the borrower 
from making timely payments on the covered 
mortgage loan due, directly or indirectly, to the

bearance and oral affirmation of hardship by 
the borrower shall be sufficient for the borrower 
to obtain or extend a forbearance.’’.

mortgagee shall, as a precondition to sending a 
due and payable request to the Secretary or ini-
tiating or continuing a foreclosure process—

tention options to cure the property charge de-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5379 
October 1, 2020 
(f) DEFINITIONS.—In this section: 
(1) MINORITY.—The term ‘‘minority’’ has the 
meaning given the term in section 308(b) of the 
Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and 
Enforcement Act of 1989 and includes any indig-
enous person in the United States or the terri-
tories of the United States. 
(2) MINORITY BUSINESS ENTERPRISE.—The term 
‘‘minority business enterprise’’ means a for-prof-
it business enterprise— 
(A) that is not less than 51 percent-owned by 
1 or more minority individuals; and 
(B) the management and daily business oper-
ations of which are controlled by 1 or more mi-
nority individuals. 
(g) AUTHORIZATION
OF
APPROPRIATIONS.— 
There 
are 
authorized 
to 
be 
appropriated 
$3,000,000,000 to carry out this section. Such 
funds are authorized to be appropriated to re-
main available until expended. 
TITLE VII—PROMOTING AND ADVANCING 
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR THROUGH IN-
CLUSIVE LENDING 
SEC. 701. SHORT TITLE. 
This title may be cited as the ‘‘Promoting and 
Advancing Communities of Color through Inclu-
sive Lending Act’’. 
SEC. 702. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
(a) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds the fol-
lowing: 
(1) The Coronavirus 2019 (COVID–19) pan-
demic and the resulting recession have led to 
more than 4.8 million cases and at least 157,000 
deaths in the United States as of August 6, 2020; 
a 7.6 percent increase in the unemployment rate 
from February to June, or approximately 12 mil-
lion more persons who have lost their job; and 
an estimated 36 percent of renters and 4.1 mil-
lion homeowners who are struggling to pay their 
rent and mortgages. 
(2) According to the Centers for Disease Con-
trol, ‘‘long-standing systemic health and social 
inequities have put some members of racial and 
ethnic minority groups at increased risk of get-
ting COVID–19 or experiencing severe illness’’. 
(3) Minority-owned businesses are also facing 
more difficult economic circumstances than oth-
ers as a result of the COVID–19 pandemic. In 
April 2020, the Federal Reserve Bank of New 
York reported that minority- and women-owned 
businesses were not only more likely to show 
signs of limited financial health, but also twice 
as likely to be classified as ‘‘at risk’’ or ‘‘dis-
tressed’’ than their non-minority counterparts. 
(4) During the Coronavirus 2019 (COVID–19) 
pandemic, community development financial in-
stitutions (CDFIs) and minority depository in-
stitutions (MDIs) have delivered needed capital 
and relief to underserved communities, many of 
which have borne a disproportionate impact of 
the COVID–19 pandemic. Through August 8, 
2020, CDFIs and MDIs have provided more than 
$16.4 billion in Paycheck Protection Program 
(PPP) loans to small businesses with a smaller 
median loan size of about $74,000 compared to 
the overall program median loan size of $101,000. 
(5) In addition to establishing relief funds and 
services for local businesses and individuals ex-
periencing loss of income, CDFIs and MDIs 
have provided mortgage forbearances, loan 
deferments, and modifications to help address 
the needs of their borrowers. CDFIs and MDIs 
are reaching underserved communities and mi-
nority-owned businesses at a critical time. 
(6) The Community Development Financial 
Institutions Fund (CDFI Fund) is an agency of 
the U.S. Department of the Treasury and was 
established by the Riegle Community Develop-
ment and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994. 
The mission of the CDFI Fund is ‘‘to expand 
economic opportunity for underserved people 
and communities by supporting the growth and 
capacity of a national network of community 
development lenders, investors, and financial 
service providers’’. As of September 15, 2020, 
there were 1,137 certified CDFIs in all 50 States, 
District of Columbia, Guam, and Puerto Rico. 
(7) Following the 2008 financial crisis and the 
disproportionate impact the Great Recession had 
on minority communities, the number of MDI 
banks fell more than 30 percent over the fol-
lowing decade, to 143 as of the second quarter of 
2020. Meanwhile, MDI credit unions have seen 
similar declines, with more than one-third of 
such institutions disappearing since 2013. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—The following is the 
sense of the Congress: 
(1) The Department of the Treasury, Board of 
Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Small 
Business Administration (SBA), Office of the 
Comptroller of the Currency, Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation, National Credit Union 
Administration, and other Federal agencies 
should take steps to support, engage with, and 
utilize minority depository institutions and com-
munity development financial institutions in the 
near term, especially as they carry out programs 
to respond to the COVID–19 pandemic, and the 
long term. 
(2) The Board of Governors of the Federal Re-
serve System should, consistent with its man-
dates, work to increase lending by minority de-
pository institutions and community develop-
ment financial institutions to underserved com-
munities, and when appropriate, should work 
with the Department of the Treasury to increase 
lending by minority depository institutions and 
community development financial institutions to 
underserved communities. 
(3) The Department of the Treasury and pru-
dential regulators should establish a strategic 
plan identifying concrete steps that they can 
take to support existing minority depository in-
stitutions, as well as the formation of new mi-
nority depository institutions consistent with 
the goals established in the Financial Institu-
tions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 
1989 (FIRREA) to preserve and promote minority 
depository institutions. 
(4) Congress should increase funding and 
make other enhancements, including those pro-
vided by this legislation, to enhance the effec-
tiveness of the CDFI Fund, especially reforms to 
support minority-owned and minority led CDFIs 
in times of crisis and beyond. 
(5) Congress should conduct robust and ongo-
ing oversight of the Department of the Treasury, 
CDFI Fund, Federal prudential regulators, 
SBA, and other Federal agencies to ensure they 
fulfill their obligations under the law as well as 
implement this title and other laws in a manner 
that supports and fully utilizes minority deposi-
tory institutions and community development fi-
nancial intuitions, as appropriate. 
(6) The investments made by the Secretary of 
the Treasury under this title and the amend-
ments made by this title should be designed to 
maximize the benefit to low- and moderate-in-
come and minority communities and contemplate 
losses to capital of the Treasury. 
SEC. 703. PURPOSE. 
The purpose of this title is to— 
(1) establish programs to revitalize and pro-
vide long-term financial products and service 
availability for, and provide investments in, 
low- and moderate-income and minority commu-
nities; 
(2) respond to the unprecedented loss of 
Black-owned businesses and unemployment; 
and 
(3) otherwise enhance the stability, safety and

that support low- and moderate-income and mi-
nority communities.

under this title and the amendments made by 
this title, the Secretary of the Treasury shall

fected by the COVID–19 pandemic. 
(b) REQUIREMENT FOR CREDITORS.—Any cred-
itor participating in a program established

SEC. 707. ENSURING DIVERSITY IN COMMUNITY 
BANKING. 
(a) SENSE
OF
CONGRESS
ON
FUNDING
THE 
LOAN-LOSS RESERVE FUND FOR SMALL DOLLAR 
LOANS.—The sense of Congress is the following: 
(1) The Community Development Financial 
Institutions Fund (the ‘‘CDFI Fund’’) is an 
agency of the Department of the Treasury, and 
was established by the Riegle Community Devel-
opment and Regulatory Improvement Act of 
1994. The mission of the CDFI Fund is ‘‘to ex-
pand economic opportunity for underserved peo-
ple and communities by supporting the growth 
and capacity of a national network of commu-
nity development lenders, investors, and finan-
cial service providers’’. A community develop-
ment financial institution (a ‘‘CDFI’’) is a spe-
cialized financial institution serving low-income 
communities and a Community Development En-
tity (a ‘‘CDE’’) is a domestic corporation or 
partnership that is an intermediary vehicle for 
the provision of loans, investments, or financial 
counseling in low-income communities. The 
CDFI Fund certifies CDFIs and CDEs. Becom-
ing a certified CDFI or CDE allows organiza-
tions to participate in various CDFI Fund pro-
grams as follows: 
(A) The Bank Enterprise Award Program, 
which provides FDIC-insured depository institu-
tions awards for a demonstrated increase in 
lending and investments in distressed commu-
nities and CDFIs. 
(B) The CDFI Program, which provides Fi-
nancial and Technical Assistance awards to 
CDFIs to reinvest in the CDFI, and to build the 
capacity of the CDFI, including financing prod-
uct development and loan loss reserves. 
(C) The Native American CDFI Assistance 
Program, which provides CDFIs and sponsoring 
entities Financial and Technical Assistance 
awards to increase lending and grow the num-
ber of CDFIs owned by Native Americans to 
help build capacity of such CDFIs. 
(D) The New Market Tax Credit Program, 
which provides tax credits for making equity in-
vestments in CDEs that stimulate capital invest-
ments in low-income communities. 
(E) The Capital Magnet Fund, which provides 
awards to CDFIs and nonprofit affordable 
housing organizations to finance affordable 
housing solutions and related economic develop-
ment activities. 
(F) The Bond Guarantee Program, a source of 
long-term, patient capital for CDFIs to expand 
lending and investment capacity for community 
and economic development purposes. 
(2) The Department of the Treasury is author-
ized to create multi-year grant programs de-
signed to encourage low-to-moderate income in-
dividuals to establish accounts at federally in-
sured banks, and to improve low-to-moderate in-
come individuals’ access to such accounts on 
reasonable terms. 
(3) Under this authority, grants to partici-
pants in CDFI Fund programs may be used for 
loan-loss reserves and to establish small-dollar 
loan programs by subsidizing related losses. 
These grants also allow for the providing recipi-
ents with the financial counseling and edu-
cation necessary to conduct transactions and 
manage their accounts. These loans provide 
low-cost alternatives to payday loans and other 
nontraditional forms of financing that often im-
pose excessive interest rates and fees on bor-
rowers, and lead millions of Americans to fall 
into debt traps. Small-dollar loans can only be 
made pursuant to terms, conditions, and prac-
tices that are reasonable for the individual con-
sumer obtaining the loan. 
(4) Program participation is restricted to eligi-
ble institutions, which are limited to organiza-
tions listed in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal 
Revenue Code and exempt from tax under 501(a) 
of such Code, federally insured depository insti-
tutions, community development financial insti-
tutions and State, local, or Tribal government 
entities. 
(5) Since its founding, the CDFI Fund has 
awarded over $3,300,000,000 to CDFIs and CDEs, 
allocated $54,000,000,000 in tax credits, and 
$1,510,000,000 in bond guarantees. According to 
the CDFI Fund, some programs attract as much 
as $10 in private capital for every $1 invested by 
the CDFI Fund. The Administration and the 
Congress should prioritize appropriation of 
funds for the loan loss reserve fund and tech-
nical assistance programs administered by the 
Community Development Financial Institution 
Fund. 
(b) DEFINITIONS.—In this section: 
(1) COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FINANCIAL IN-
STITUTION.—The term ‘‘community development 
financial institution’’ has the meaning given 
under section 103 of the Riegle Community De-
velopment and Regulatory Improvement Act of 
1994 (12 U.S.C. 4702). 
(2) MINORITY DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION.—The 
term ‘‘minority depository institution’’ has the 
meaning given under section 308 of the Finan-
cial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforce-
ment Act of 1989 (12 U.S.C. 1463 note).

addition to such other methods as the State may 
establish for an individual to request an absen-
tee ballot, the State shall permit an individual 
to submit a request for an absentee ballot on-
line. The State shall be considered to meet the 
requirements of this paragraph if the website of 
the appropriate State or local election official 
allows an absentee ballot request application to 
be completed and submitted online and if the 
website permits the individual— 
‘‘(A) to print the application so that the indi-
vidual may complete the application and return 
it to the official; or

tion be transmitted to the individual by mail or

plete the application and return it to the offi-
cial. 
‘‘(2) ENSURING DELIVERY PRIOR TO ELECTION.— 
If an individual requests to vote by absentee 
ballot in an election for Federal office, the ap-
propriate State or local election official shall en-
sure that the ballot and relating voting mate-
rials are received by the individual prior to the 
date of the election so long as the individual’s 
request is received by the official not later than 
5 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and

local election official if— 
‘‘(A) the ballot is postmarked, signed, or oth-
erwise indicated by the United States Postal 
Service to have been mailed on or before the

election official prior to the expiration of the 10- 
day period which begins on the date of the elec-

delivering the ballot at such times and to such 
locations as the State may establish, including— 
‘‘(A) permitting the individual to deliver the 
ballot to a polling place on any date on which

place; and

‘‘(2) PERMITTING VOTERS TO DESIGNATE OTHER 
PERSON TO RETURN BALLOT.—The State— 
‘‘(A) shall permit a voter to designate any per-
son to return a voted and sealed absentee ballot 
to the post office, a ballot drop-off location, 
tribally designated building, or election office so 
long as the person designated to return the bal-
lot does not receive any form of compensation 
based on the number of ballots that the person 
has returned and no individual, group, or orga-
nization provides compensation on this basis; 
and 
‘‘(B) may not put any limit on how many 
voted and sealed absentee ballots any des-
ignated person can return to the post office, a 
ballot drop off location, tribally designated 
building, or election office.

QUIREMENTS.—

essing and scanning ballots cast by mail for tab-
ulation at least 14 days prior to the date of the

shall be construed to permit a State to tabulate 
ballots in an election before the closing of the 
polls on the date of the election.

section shall be construed to affect the authority 
of States to conduct elections for Federal office 
through the use of polling places at which indi-
viduals cast ballots. 
‘‘(i) NO EFFECT ON BALLOTS SUBMITTED BY 
ABSENT
MILITARY
AND
OVERSEAS
VOTERS.—

fect the treatment of any ballot submitted by an

TITLE II—GLOBAL HEALTH SECURITY ACT 
OF 2020 
SEC. 201. SHORT TITLE. 
This title may be cited as the ‘‘Global Health 
Security Act of 2020’’. 
SEC. 202. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) In December 2009, President Obama re-
leased the National Strategy for Countering Bio-
logical Threats, which listed as one of seven ob-
jectives ‘‘Promote global health security: In-
crease the availability of and access to knowl-
edge and products of the life sciences that can 
help reduce the impact from outbreaks of infec-
tious disease whether of natural, accidental, or 
deliberate origin’’. 
(2) In February 2014, the United States and 
nearly 30 other nations launched the Global 
Health Security Agenda (GHSA) to address sev-
eral high-priority, global infectious disease 
threats. The GHSA is a multi-faceted, multi- 
country initiative intended to accelerate partner 
countries’ measurable capabilities to achieve 
specific targets to prevent, detect, and respond 
to infectious disease threats, whether naturally 
occurring, deliberate, or accidental. 
(3) In 2015, the United Nations adopted the 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which 
include specific reference to the importance of 
global health security as part of SDG 3 ‘‘ensure 
healthy lives and promote well-being for all at 
all ages’’ as follows: ‘‘strengthen the capacity of 
all countries, in particular developing countries, 
for early warning, risk reduction and manage-
ment of national and global health risks’’. 
(4) On November 4, 2016, President Obama 
signed Executive Order 13747, ‘‘Advancing the 
Global Health Security Agenda to Achieve a 
World Safe and Secure from Infectious Disease 
Threats’’. 
(5) In October 2017 at the GHSA Ministerial 
Meeting in Uganda, the United States and more 
than 40 GHSA member countries supported the 
‘‘Kampala Declaration’’ to extend the GHSA for 
an additional 5 years to 2024. 
(6) In December 2017, President Trump re-
leased the National Security Strategy, which in-
cludes the priority action: ‘‘Detect and contain 
biothreats at their source: We will work with 
other countries to detect and mitigate outbreaks 
early to prevent the spread of disease. We will 
encourage other countries to invest in basic 
health care systems and to strengthen global 
health security across the intersection of human 
and animal health to prevent infectious disease 
outbreaks’’. 
(7) In September 2018, President Trump re-
leased the National Biodefense Strategy, which 
includes objectives to ‘‘strengthen global health 
security capacities to prevent local bioincidents 
from becoming epidemics’’, and ‘‘strengthen 
international preparedness to support inter-
national response and recovery capabilities’’. 
SEC. 203. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
It is the policy of the United States to— 
(1) promote global health security as a core 
national security interest; 
(2) advance the aims of the Global Health Se-
curity Agenda; 
(3) collaborate with other countries to detect 
and mitigate outbreaks early to prevent the 
spread of disease; 
(4) encourage other countries to invest in 
basic resilient and sustainable health care sys-
tems; and 
(5) strengthen global health security across 
the intersection of human and animal health to 
prevent infectious disease outbreaks and combat 
the growing threat of antimicrobial resistance.

AND 
ACCOUNT-
ABILITY ACT OF 2016. 
Section 2(3) of the Foreign Aid Transparency 
and Accountability Act of 2016 (Public Law 114– 
191; 22 U.S.C. 2394c note) is amended— 
(1) in subparagraph (C), by striking ‘‘and’’ at 
the end; 
(2) in subparagraph (D), by striking the pe-
riod at the end and inserting ‘‘; and’’; and

‘‘(E) the Global Health Security Act of 2020.’’. 
SEC. 209. DEFINITIONS. 
In this title: 
(1) APPROPRIATE
CONGRESSIONAL
COMMIT-
TEES.—The term ‘‘appropriate congressional 
committees’’ means— 
(A) the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the 
Committee on Appropriations of the House of 
Representatives; and 
(B) the Committee on Foreign Relations and 
the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate. 
(2) GLOBAL
HEALTH
SECURITY.—The term 
‘‘global health security’’ means activities sup-
porting epidemic and pandemic preparedness 
and capabilities at the country and global levels 
in order to minimize vulnerability to acute pub-
lic health events that can endanger the health 
of populations across geographical regions and 
international boundaries. 
SEC. 210. SUNSET. 
This title (other than section 205), and the 
amendments made by this title, shall cease to be 
effective on December 31, 2024. 
TITLE III—SECURING AMERICA FROM 
EPIDEMICS ACT 
SEC. 301. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Due to increasing population and popu-
lation density, human mobility, and ecological 
change, emerging infectious diseases pose a real 
and growing threat to global health security. 
(2) While vaccines can be the most effective 
tools to protect against infectious disease, the 
absence of vaccines for a new or emerging infec-
tious disease with epidemic potential is a major 
health security threat globally, posing cata-
strophic potential human and economic costs. 
(3) The 1918 influenza pandemic infected 
500,000,000 people, or about one-third of the 
world’s population at the time, and killed 
50,000,000 people—more than died in the First 
World War. 
(4) The economic cost of an outbreak can be 
devastating. The estimated global cost today, 
should an outbreak of the scale of the 1918 in-
fluenza pandemic strike, is 5 percent of global 
gross domestic product. 
(5) Even regional outbreaks can have enor-
mous human costs and substantially disrupt the 
global economy and cripple regional economies. 
The 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa killed 
more than 11,000 and cost $2,800,000,000 in losses 
in the affected countries alone. 
(6) The ongoing novel coronavirus outbreak 
reflects the pressing need for quick and effective 
vaccine and countermeasure development. 
(7) While the need for vaccines to address 
emerging epidemic threats is acute, markets to 
drive the necessary development of vaccines to 
address them—a complex and expensive under-
taking—are very often critically absent. Also ab-
sent are mechanisms to ensure access to those 
vaccines by those who need them when they 
need them. 
(8) To address this global vulnerability and 
the deficit of political commitment, institutional 
capacity, and funding, in 2017, several countries 
and private partners launched the Coalition for 
Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI).

October 1, 2020 
CEPI’s mission is to stimulate, finance, and co-
ordinate development of vaccines for high-pri-
ority, epidemic-potential threats in cases where 
traditional markets do not exist or cannot create 
sufficient demand. 
(9) Through funding of partnerships, CEPI 
seeks to bring priority vaccines candidates 
through the end of phase II clinical trials, as 
well as support vaccine platforms that can be 
rapidly deployed against emerging pathogens. 
(10) CEPI has funded multiple partners to de-
velop vaccine candidates against the novel 
coronavirus, responding to this urgent, global 
requirement. 
(11) Support for and participation in CEPI is 
an important part of the United States own 
health security and biodefense and is in the na-
tional interest, complementing the work of many 
Federal agencies and providing significant 
value through global partnership and burden- 
sharing.

October 1, 2020 
States holds approximately 21 percent of the 
world’s prisoners and leads the world in the 
number of individuals incarcerated, with nearly 
2,200,000 people incarcerated in State and Fed-
eral prisons and local jails. 
(4) Studies have shown that individuals age 
out of crime starting around 25 years of age, 
and released individuals over the age of 50 have 
a very low recidivism rate. 
(5) According to public health experts, incar-
cerated individuals are particularly vulnerable 
to being gravely impacted by the novel corona 
virus pandemic because— 
(A) they have higher rates of underlying 
health issues than members of the general pub-
lic, including higher rates of respiratory disease, 
heart disease, diabetes, obesity, HIV/AIDS, sub-
stance abuse, hepatitis, and other conditions 
that suppress immune response; and 
(B) the close conditions and lack of access to 
hygiene products in prisons make these institu-
tions unusually susceptible to viral pandemics. 
(6) The spread of communicable disease in the 
United States generally constitutes a serious, 
heightened threat to the safety of incarcerated 
individuals, and there is a serious threat to the 
general public that prisons may become incuba-
tors of community spread of communicable viral 
disease.

tional emergency relating to a communicable 
disease is declared and ending on the date that 
is 60 days after such national emergency expires

vincing evidence, taking into account the indi-
vidual’s offense of conviction, to be likely to 
pose a specific and substantial risk of causing

or 
(II) requiring a petition, motion, or other simi-
lar document to be filed; 
(ii) may not place in community supervision 
any individual if the court determines, after a 
hearing and the attorney for the Government 
shows by clear and convincing evidence based 
on individualized facts, that detention is nec-

a specific and substantial risk that the indi-
vidual will cause bodily injury or use violent 
force against the person of another and that no 
conditions of release will reasonably mitigate 
that risk; 
(iii) in carrying out clauses (i) and (ii), may— 
(I) rely on evidence presented in prior court 
proceedings; and 
(II) if the court determines it necessary, re-

lease, the judicial officer may not require pay-
ment of cash bail, proof of ability to pay an un-
secured bond, execution of a bail bond, a solvent 
surety to co-sign a secured or unsecured bond, 
or posting of real property. 
(2) LIMITATION.— 
(A) IN GENERAL.—Beginning on the date on 
which a national emergency relating to a com-
municable disease is declared and ending on the 
date that is 60 days after such national emer-
gency expires or is terminated, at any initial ap-
pearance hearing, detention hearing, hearing 
on a motion for pretrial release, or any other 
hearing where the attorney for the Government 
is seeking the detention or continued detention 
of any individual, the judicial officer shall order 
the pretrial release of the individual on personal 
recognizance or on a condition or combination 
of conditions under section 3142(c) of title 18, 
United States Code, unless the attorney for the 
Government shows by clear and convincing evi-
dence based on individualized facts that deten-
tion is necessary because the individual’s release 
will pose a specific and substantial risk that the 
individual will cause bodily injury or use violent 
force against the person of another and that no 
conditions of release will reasonably mitigate 
that risk. 
(B) REQUIRED
CONSIDERATION
OF
CERTAIN 
FACTORS.—If the judicial officer finds that the 
attorney for the Government has made the req-
uisite showing under subparagraph (A), the ju-
dicial officer shall take into consideration, in 
determining whether detention is necessary— 
(i) whether the individual’s age or medical 
condition renders them especially vulnerable; 
and 
(ii) whether detention will compromise the in-
dividual’s access to adequate medical treatment, 
access to medications, or ability to privately 
consult with counsel and meaningfully prepare 
a defense. 
(C) JUVENILES.— 
(i) IN
GENERAL.—Beginning on the date on

sponsible party (including the director of a shel-
ter-care facility) upon their promise to bring 
such juvenile before the appropriate court when 
requested by the judicial officer. 
(ii) EXCEPTION.—A juvenile alleged to have 
committed an act of juvenile delinquency may be 
detained pending trial only if, at a hearing at 
which the juvenile is represented by counsel, the 
attorney for the Government shows by clear and 
convincing evidence based on individualized 
facts that detention is necessary because the ju-
venile’s release will pose a specific and substan-
tial risk that the juvenile will use violent force 
against a reasonably identifiable person and 
that no conditions of release will reasonably 
mitigate that risk, except that in no case may a 
judicial officer order the detention of a juvenile 
if it will compromise the juvenile’s access to ade-
quate medical treatment, access to medications, 
or ability to privately consult with counsel and 
meaningfully prepare a defense. 
(iii) LEAST
RESTRICTIVE
DETENTION.—In the 
case that the judicial officer orders the deten-
tion of a juvenile under clause (ii), the judicial 
officer shall order the detention of the juvenile 
in the least restrictive and safest environment 
possible, taking the national emergency relating 
to a communicable disease into consideration. 
(iv) CONTENTS OF DETENTION ORDER.—In the 
case that the judicial officer orders the deten-
tion of a juvenile under clause (ii), the judicial 
officer shall issue a written detention order that 
includes— 
(I) findings of fact; 
(II) the reasons for the detention; 
(III) a description of the risk identified under 
clause (ii); 
(IV) an explanation of why no conditions will 
reasonably mitigate the risk identified under 
clause (ii); 
(V) a statement that detention will not com-
promise the juvenile’s access to adequate med-
ical treatment, access to medications, or ability 
to privately consult with counsel and meaning-
fully prepare a defense; and 
(VI) a statement establishing that the deten-
tion environment is the least restrictive and

‘‘PART OO—PANDEMIC CORRECTIONAL 
FACILITY EMERGENCY RESPONSE 
‘‘SEC. 3061. FINDINGS; PURPOSES. 
‘‘(a) IMMEDIATE RELEASE OF VULNERABLE AND 
LOW-RISK
INDIVIDUALS.—The purpose of the 
grant program under section 3062 is to provide 
for the testing, initiation and transfer to treat-
ment in the community, and provision of serv-
ices in the community, by States and units of 
local government as they relate to preventing, 
detecting, and stopping the spread of COVID–19 
in correctional facilities. 
‘‘(b) PRETRIAL CITATION AND RELEASE.— 
‘‘(1) FINDINGS.—Congress finds as follows: 
‘‘(A) With the dramatic growth in pretrial de-
tention resulting in county and city correctional 
facilities regularly exceeding capacity, such cor-
rectional facilities may serve to rapidly increase 
the spread of COVID–19, as facilities that hold 
large numbers of individuals in congregant liv-
ing situations may promote the spread of 
COVID–19. 
‘‘(B) While individuals arrested and processed 
at local correctional facilities may only be held 
for hours or days, exposure to large number of 
individuals in holding cells and courtrooms pro-
motes the spread of COVID–19. 
‘‘(C) Pretrial detainees and individuals in cor-
rectional facilities are then later released into 
the community having being exposed to COVID– 
19. 
‘‘(2) PURPOSE.—The purpose of the grant pro-
gram under section 3065 is to substantially in-
crease the use of risk-based citation release for 
all individuals who do not present a public safe-
ty risk. 
‘‘SEC. 3062. IMMEDIATE RELEASE OF VULNER-

ical manner as a way of achieving specific tar-
get capacities established under this paragraph. 
‘‘(2) CERTIFICATION.—An eligible applicant 
shall include in its application for a grant under 
this section a certification by a public health 
professional who is certified in epidemiology or 
infectious diseases that each correctional facil-
ity that will receive funds under this section in

Section 1402(b) of the Victims of Crime Act of 
1984 (34 U.S.C. 20101(b)) is amended— 
(1) in paragraph (4), by striking ‘‘and’’ at the

(a) IN GENERAL.—Notwithstanding any other

the 
Attorney

TITLE IV—JABARA-HEYER NO HATE ACT 
SEC. 401. SHORT TITLE. 
This title may be cited as the ‘‘Jabara-Heyer 
National Opposition to Hate, Assault, and 
Threats to Equality Act of 2020’’ or the ‘‘Jabara- 
Heyer NO HATE Act’’. 
SEC. 402. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) The incidence of violence known as hate 
crimes or crimes motivated by bias poses a seri-
ous national problem. 
(2) According to data obtained by the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation, the incidence of such 
violence increased in 2017, the most recent year 
for which data is available. 
(3) In 1990, Congress enacted the Hate Crime 
Statistics Act (Public Law 101–275; 28 U.S.C. 534 
note) to provide the Federal Government, law 
enforcement agencies, and the public with data 
regarding the incidence of hate crime. The Hate 
Crimes Statistics Act and the Matthew Shepard 
and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act 
(division E of Public Law 111–84; 123 Stat. 2835) 
have enabled Federal authorities to understand 
and, where appropriate, investigate and pros-
ecute hate crimes. 
(4) A more complete understanding of the na-
tional problem posed by hate crime is in the 
public interest and supports the Federal interest 
in 
eradicating 
bias-motivated 
violence 
ref-
erenced in section 249(b)(1)(C) of title 18, United 
States Code. 
(5) However, a complete understanding of the 
national problem posed by hate crimes is hin-
dered by incomplete data from Federal, State, 
and local jurisdictions through the Uniform 
Crime Reports program authorized under section 
534 of title 28, United States Code, and adminis-
tered by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 
(6) Multiple factors contribute to the provision 
of inaccurate and incomplete data regarding the 
incidence of hate crime through the Uniform 
Crime Reports program. A significant contrib-
uting factor is the quality and quantity of train-
ing that State and local law enforcement agen-
cies receive on the identification and reporting 
of suspected bias-motivated crimes. 
(7) The problem of crimes motivated by bias is 
sufficiently serious, widespread, and interstate 
in nature as to warrant Federal financial assist-
ance to States and local jurisdictions. 
(8) Federal financial assistance with regard to 
certain violent crimes motivated by bias enables 
Federal, State, and local authorities to work to-
gether as partners in the investigation and pros-
ecution of such crimes. 
SEC. 403. DEFINITIONS. 
In this title: 
(1) HATE
CRIME.—The term ‘‘hate crime’’ 
means an act described in section 245, 247, or 249 
of title 18, United States Code, or in section 901 
of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3631). 
(2) PRIORITY
AGENCY.—The term ‘‘priority

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5418 
October 1, 2020 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of this updated version of the Heroes 
Act. 
The health and economic catastrophe 
facing our country continues to cry out 
for urgent action. In May, a bipartisan 
majority in the House passed the He-
roes Act to provide critical support for 
our country to crush the coronavirus 
so that we can protect lives and reopen 
our economy. 
Unfortunately, that legislation has 
lingered for more than 4 months as 
President Trump continues to down-
play the severity of this pandemic. 
This updated version of the Heroes 
Act seeks to meet Republicans halfway 
while addressing needs that have grown 
since May. As Speaker PELOSI and Sec-
retary Mnuchin continue their negotia-
tions, the House’s consideration of this 
legislation formalizes this body’s prof-
fer in these negotiations. 
To that end, we have updated the 
earlier versions of the Heroes Act by 
including 
strengthened 
support 
for 
small businesses, additional assistance 
for airline industry workers, and more 
funds for the children, for schools, for 
postsecondary 
education, 
and 
for 
childcare. 
Near and dear to my heart, we have 
also added a substantial investment in 
global public health that will save lives 
at home and abroad. 
Moreover, House Democrats have 
maintained many of the earlier prior-
ities of the Heroes Act. That includes: 
$436 billion for State, local, territorial, 
and Tribal governments to pay vital 
frontline 
workers; 
$75 
billion 
for 
coronavirus testing, contact tracing, 
and isolation measures; and $28 billion 
for procurement, distribution, and edu-
cation campaigns for a safe and effec-
tive vaccine; additional direct pay-
ments to families; strong, enforceable 
workplace safety standards; changes to 
preserve healthcare for unemployed 
Americans; an extension of unemploy-
ment benefits; housing assistance so 
renters and homeowners can stay in 
their homes; food assistance so strug-
gling families can put food on the 
table; and protections for our democ-
racy, with funding for safe elections, 
an accurate Census, and the Postal 
Service. 
Mr. Speaker, this legislation rep-
resents a compromise that delivers for 
American families. Negotiations are 
continuing, and I ardently hope that 
we can soon return to this floor with a 
bipartisan agreement. 
In the meantime, a strong vote to-
night will show our will to act and 
bring us closer to delivering much- 
needed relief to American families. 
I urge support for this critical legis-
lation, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposi-
tion to this bill. 
Unfortunately, by considering this 
bill today, we are abandoning a spirit 
of bipartisanship that has allowed us to 
work across the aisle four times this 
year to pass critical coronavirus relief 
legislation. This bill was crafted with-
out input from Members on our side of 
the aisle, and it does not have the sup-
port needed to pass the Senate or be 
signed by the President. 
There are some things included that 
I support, such as helping small busi-
nesses that are desperate for a lifeline, 
enabling the airline industry to con-
tinue to pay its employees, providing 
additional assistance to help schools 
continue 
reopening, 
and 
increasing 
testing for the virus. 
Yet, I cannot overlook, nor can I 
overstate, the significant problems I 
have with this bill. 
First, it totals more than $2 trillion, 
which is more than we appropriate for 
an entire year. 
But what may be even more con-
cerning is that buried in the more than 
2,000 pages of text are partisan provi-
sions that are unrelated to the pan-
demic. These additions will not move 
us any closer to defeating this virus. In 
fact, they will only further divide us. 
For example, there is language in the 
bill that encourages State and local 
governments to release violent crimi-
nals in order to get more funding. It 
prohibits immigration laws from being 
carried out and enforcement actions to 
be taken. It enables illegal immigrants 
to receive direct payments. 
It stalls the Census that is required 
by the law to occur every 10 years. 
It imposes sweeping changes to elec-
tions and provides more than $3 billion 
in election assistance grants. 
Including so many unnecessary items 
just to cater to the demands of a few 
could result in gridlock at a time when 
compromise and real results are still in 
reach. 
After all the good work we have done 
together to provide relief and hope to 
the American people, I am very dis-
appointed that this is the bill that the 
majority has chosen to bring to the 
floor. 
I hope my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle will come back to the 
negotiating table and work with us to 
put the needs of the American people 
first, just as we have done four other 
times since the beginning of this dev-
astating pandemic. 
It is time for our leaders to come to-
gether rather than take a vote on this 
damaging partisan bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Illi-
nois (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS), the ranking 
member of the House Administration 
Committee. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, today we find ourselves in the 
exact same situation as we were 5 
months ago, voting on a so-called 
coronavirus relief bill filled with 71 
pages of Federal election mandates 
that have nothing to do with providing 
relief 
to 
those 
impacted 
by 
the 
coronavirus. It is yet another attempt 
by Democrats to federalize our elec-
tions. 
The bill mandates States provide 
same-day registration, 15 days of early 
voting. It requires specific rules for 
polling locations, no-excuse vote-by- 
mail for every person, nationalizes bal-
lot harvesting, and the list of Federal 
election mandates goes on and on. 
Unlike what my Democrat colleagues 
continue to tell the American people, 
these provisions have nothing to do 
with the pandemic because they were 
part of H.R. 1, which passed the House 
nearly a year before the pandemic 
began. 
That said, I have a bill, Mr. Speaker, 
that would address election issues 
caused by the pandemic. It is called the 
EASE Act, and I would welcome House 
Democrats bringing it up for a vote. 
Not only am I troubled by this at-
tempt to federalize our elections, but it 
would change the rules midgame. Many 
States are already voting, including 
my home State of Illinois. The U.S. 
Elections Project estimates that more 
than a million people have already 
voted, meaning some people would vote 
under one set of rules and, if this 
passed, others would vote under an-
other set of rules. This is not how fair 
elections are run in the United States. 
We have seen what happens when 
States 
have 
last-minute 
voting 
changes. It creates mass voter confu-
sion and leads to people being disen-
franchised. 
This bill becoming law would be a 
disaster for election administrators 
and lead to even more confusion sur-
rounding the 2020 election in 33 days, 
and, ultimately, more people would be 
disenfranchised. 
If this bill was a serious attempt at 
helping schools reopen safely, busi-
nesses keep their employees on payroll, 
or others impacted by the coronavirus, 
71 provisions aimed at federalizing our 
elections would not be included. 
My friends on the other side of the 
aisle should drop these provisions and 
offer a clean bill to help our constitu-
ents, the parents, business owners, 
workers, and others who have found 
their lives turned upside down because 
of this pandemic. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to yield 5 minutes to the dis-
tinguished gentleman from Virginia 
(Mr. SCOTT), the chairman of the Com-
mittee on Education and Labor. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise in support of the bill. And since 
House Democrats first passed the He-
roes Act in May, congressional Repub-
licans 
and 
administration 
officials 
have refused to advance any meaning-
ful COVID–19 relief plan that would 
help our community survive this pan-
demic. 
As a result, the American people are 
continuing to bear the brunt of an eco-
nomic and public health crisis that is 
needlessly dragging on and getting 
worse.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5419 
October 1, 2020 
State and local governments are still 
facing massive budget shortfalls. With-
out Federal support, these shortfalls 
will slash public education funding and 
other critical public services. 
School districts are starting the new 
academic year without resources they 
need to open safely, keep their staff on 
payroll, operate high-quality programs 
remotely, and other things that they 
need to make sure that our students 
can become the best that they can be. 
Millions of workers are still unem-
ployed and can no longer access the en-
hanced unemployment benefits that 
kept them afloat before they expired in 
July. Those working during the pan-
demic are suffering from unsafe work-
ing conditions with little protection 
from COVID–19 infections. 
Most significantly, more than 7 mil-
lion Americans have been infected, and 
over 200,000 have lost their lives due to 
the pandemic, and we still do not have 
a coherent strategy to deal with 
COVID–19. 
Moreover, far too many people still 
do 
not 
have 
access 
to 
affordable 
healthcare as the virus continues to ac-
celerate in 32 States and in Puerto 
Rico, according to ABC News. 
The updated Heroes Act offers us an-
other chance to get meaningful relief 
into the hands of students, educators, 
workers, and families. 
First, the updated Heroes Act dedi-
cates over $400 billion to help State and 
local governments avert massive budg-
et shortfalls. You cannot evaluate any 
relief package without first looking at 
what you are doing for State and local 
support. That is because if you don’t 
have State and local support, there will 
be massive cuts. 
For example, budget shortfalls pro-
jected right now for State and local 
governments suggest that education 
budgets for State and local govern-
ments will be cut by hundreds of bil-
lions of dollars. 
This package protects and expands 
student access to quality education by 
increasing the relief for students, K–12 
districts, and institutions of higher 
learning by more than $200 billion. 
b 1700 
The updated Heroes Act also ensures 
that no Federal student loan borrower 
has to worry about loan payments, in-
terest accrual, or collections through 
September of next year. 
This package also invests $58 billion 
to save our childcare industry from 
collapse and ensures essential workers 
will 
be 
able 
to 
access 
affordable 
childcare and early learning options. 
The estimates are that, if we don’t put 
$10 billion a month into the childcare 
industry, it will slowly dissolve. 
The updated Heroes Act supports in-
dividuals and families hit by the eco-
nomic downturn of this crisis by put-
ting money directly into their pockets. 
The legislation includes a second round 
of stimulus checks and extends the $600 
weekly enhanced unemployment bene-
fits through next January, and it also 
helps in the housing crisis. 
To protect workers who have to work 
during this pandemic, the legislation 
directs the Occupational Safety and 
Health Administration to finally issue 
enforceable Federal workplace stand-
ards that protect all workers from con-
tracting COVID–19. Presently, in spite 
of all the problems in the meatpacking 
industries, prisons, nursing homes, and 
healthcare, there is still no enforceable 
standard 
to 
protect 
workers 
from 
COVID–19. 
This legislation also puts the medical 
and family back into medical and fam-
ily leave, like expanding access to 
emergency paid FMLA, family leave 
protections that were passed in pre-
vious relief bills. 
The legislation also provides access 
to healthcare by creating a broad, open 
enrollment period so that individuals 
and 
families 
can 
obtain 
coverage 
through the Affordable Care Act mar-
ketplaces and offers enhanced subsidies 
for many workers who have lost their 
jobs. 
Regrettably, Mr. Speaker, in Amer-
ica, most workers who lose their jobs 
also lose their health insurance, and 
this is a safety net to help them main-
tain their health insurance coverage. 
Finally, the legislation provides ro-
bust investments in some of our vital 
community programs such as the Low 
Income Home Energy Assistance Pro-
gram, better known as LIHEAP, and 
the Older Americans Act programs like 
Meals on Wheels. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
the gentleman from Virginia an addi-
tional 1 minute. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. The House 
first passed the Heroes Act 4 months 
ago because we have a responsibility to 
help our constituents recover from this 
global health emergency. Since then, 
the need has only grown. 
Instead of denying the consequences 
of this pandemic, we must put politics 
aside and pass this Heroes Act. The 
economists have told us, if we don’t 
spend the money now, the economic 
downturn will be much worse in the fu-
ture, and so we have to pass this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support the legislation, and I urge the 
Senate to take it up immediately. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Flor-
ida (Mr. RUTHERFORD), who is a mem-
ber of the Appropriations Committee. 
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman from Texas for 
yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in dis-
belief—disbelief—that we are back here 
again wasting Americans’ time consid-
ering a stimulus package that has ab-
solutely no chance of ever becoming 
law. The first Heroes Act was bad 
enough, and this version may actually 
be worse. 
Unfortunately, the Speaker wrote 
this bill without any input from the 
rest of Congress. Americans want a bi-
partisan response, and we stand ready 
to deliver it, but that is impossible 
when the Speaker writes bills all on 
her own. 
Now, whether they will admit it or 
not, I know my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle are equally dis-
appointed with this partisan process. 
In fact, 21 Democrats signed on to a 
letter urging the Speaker to work with 
Republicans to find a compromise, and 
yet here we go again with a 2,000-page 
version of the Heroes Act filled with 
the same radical proposals and poison 
pills that, again, I cannot support. 
Here are the facts: The Heroes Act 
provides PPP loans to bail out Planned 
Parenthood, bans States from legis-
lating their own voter ID laws, releases 
illegal immigrants from prison and 
then allows them to receive stimulus 
checks from the government. Also, it 
releases thousands of Federal inmates 
back out onto the street. It even 
defunds police support that was in the 
previous bill. 
A Heroes Act? Hardly. These are just 
a few of the reasons why, as a former 
first responder, I could never support 
this legislation. 
There is a solution I support, and it 
is sitting right on the Speaker’s desk 
waiting to be brought to the floor. My 
colleagues introduced a simple, clean 
piece of legislation to make available 
another round of PPP loans with the 
$137 billion that is left in that program. 
Who in this Congress would not support 
that? 
Mr. Speaker, I urge Speaker PELOSI 
to bring a bipartisan bill to the floor so 
we can get assistance to those strug-
gling American families who deserve 
our support. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the distinguished gen-
tleman 
from 
Massachusetts 
(Mr. 
NEAL), who is from my class and is the 
chair of the Committee on Ways and 
Means. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I stand 
today in support of the updated Heroes 
Act. 
The 
previous 
gentleman 
was 
dismissive of the idea that there is 
some import to this moment in terms 
of getting a package done. 
So that means expanding unemploy-
ment insurance? That is not impor-
tant, unemployment insurance that we 
might consider now which is part of 
the need of the American family? 
A reminder: There are 26 million 
Americans right now collecting unem-
ployment insurance. 
Let me put this in terms of what an 
economist might say. If we don’t ex-
pand 
unemployment 
insurance 
and 
keep the $600 supplement, the chal-
lenges that people are going to have in 
terms of daily sustenance for food, pay-
ing the rent, and paying their utility 
bills is going to mean, eventually, that 
the landlord can’t collect rents that 
then, subsequently, are used to pay for 
property taxes and mortgage pay-
ments, which means then that they 
can’t make their payments to the cred-
it 
unions 
or 
community 
bankers,

October 1, 2020 
which, 
overwhelmingly, 
are 
the 
custodians of America’s origination in 
terms of the mortgage markets. 
So maybe we, as two parties, might 
agree on the following: If you don’t de-
feat the virus, Mr. Speaker, you are 
never going to expedite economic re-
covery. That is the real argument in 
front of this Chamber at this moment. 
Mr. Speaker, 200,000 Americans—ac-
tually, about 205,000 Americans as of 
today—have died from the pandemic. 
Every one of us at home are hearing 
the desperation of our constituents. 
Let me submit this as well: When the 
CARES Act came before this House, 
only five Members of this institution 
voted against the CARES Act. 
Mr. Speaker, do you know what else 
we can all agree on? The CARES Act 
saved the American economy. You hear 
that at home from conservatives, lib-
erals, 
moderates, 
Republicans, 
and 
Democrats. They all rally around that 
theme. 
The number of people who are still 
out of work is astounding. Family 
members are sick, they are having 
trouble paying for food, and Repub-
licans suggest somehow you can handle 
this on your own? 
This is about the national principle. 
We all come to the aid of the American 
family at moments like this. We don’t 
ask if you are a Democrat or a Repub-
lican, from a red State or a blue State, 
or how you voted in the last Presi-
dential election. We say that is the 
family, and we have to take care of 
them. They are looking to this institu-
tion today to help them survive this 
pandemic. 
The economic challenges that we 
have are not about corruption, and it is 
not about economic malfeasance. It is 
about the reality that the world is con-
fronting the worst pandemic since 1918. 
The American people are looking to us 
for leadership, and House Democrats 
have stepped up to the plate. 
Just think of it. May 15 we passed the 
Heroes Act. So when the other side 
says things like, ‘‘Well, if we just do 
something in a bipartisan fashion,’’ 
what, through this intervening period 
of time, did they offer? Not much. 
We have taken the affirmative posi-
tion here. The American people need 
help. The idea of the stimulus checks 
was, as I noted a moment ago, not just 
to provide sustenance, but most econo-
mists would say, well, also to help cre-
ate simultaneous demand. The speed 
with which we moved these payments 
along was extraordinary, even by con-
trast to how the institution usually re-
sponds. 
How about the jarring testimony of 
the Chairman of the Federal Reserve 
Board last week about what this econ-
omy needs? How unsettling was it to 
hear the testimony from the Fed about 
what we should be doing? 
I am really proud of the role the 
Ways and Means Committee played in 
developing the legislation and unem-
ployment insurance. 
How about expanding the retention 
tax credit? Everybody on the other side 
of the aisle supports expanding the re-
tention tax credit, but that will get in 
the way of the eventual vote here later 
on this evening because somehow it 
doesn’t square with their philosophic 
beliefs. 
This moment calls for leadership, and 
the chaos that this country has exhib-
ited as it relates to defeating the virus 
leaves a good deal to be desired. Lead-
ership doesn’t mean telling suffering 
Americans it is what it is. This is 
about the American family. Our front-
line workers need us now more than 
ever. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
the gentleman from Massachusetts an 
additional 1 minute. 
Mr. NEAL. Every person in this Na-
tion right now needs us more than 
ever. This is a crisis unlike any we 
have faced in our lifetimes. It calls for 
real solutions, and it puts the Amer-
ican family first. 
We need to get this done for the 
American people. Vote for this legisla-
tion. It is a good piece of constructive 
work on behalf of the American people. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
21⁄2 minutes to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. ZELDIN). 
Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, this is not 
a bill, a vote, and a debate that is 
about national principle. This is about 
politics; this is about grandstanding; 
this is about political calculations; and 
this is about the election. 
Mr. Speaker, do you want to talk 
about leadership? 
Right now, there is a real deal, a real 
counteroffer that is on the table: $150 
billion more for education, $75 billion 
more for testing and tracing, $250 bil-
lion more for State and local govern-
ment funding, $400 weekly enhanced 
unemployment insurance, $15 billion 
more in food assistance, and $60 billion 
more in rental and mortgage assist-
ance. It actually adds up to $1.6 tril-
lion, which is more than the House 
Democrats who are members of the 
Problem Solvers Caucus asked for. 
They asked for $1.5 trillion. This is a 
real counteroffer. 
Instead, what you are seeing, Mr. 
Speaker, is a political calculation that 
is getting made, and real lives are at 
stake. This is a serious offer that is on 
the table, and instead of sending this 
Chamber home and ending up with 
nothing, how about we do our jobs and 
cut a deal? 
This debate right now is exactly 
what the American public hates about 
Congress. They hate us for this kind of 
a debate. They want to see us working 
together, Republicans and Democrats, 
to cut a deal. 
We have a chair of the Appropria-
tions Committee from New York. I 
view this as a New Yorker. She is a 
New Yorker. We have an MTA that 
needs money. Our State needs money. 
New York City, the Port Authority, 
and our local governments on the east 
end of Long Island, hey, we should be 
working together to get something 
done. 
This bill has poison pills in it that 
make this bill dead on arrival. There 
are certain pieces in here where we 
know this is never going to become 
law: stimulus checks for people who 
are not in our country legally, nation-
wide cashless bail, nationwide ballot 
harvesting, prohibition on voter ID, 
and releasing criminals from prison. 
None of that will ever become law. 
Why are we doing that when we have 
real lives, real people? 
Go talk to that person who works for 
the airline and they are being fur-
loughed first thing this morning. They 
don’t have a job to go to. Go to talk to 
the MTA, the largest mass transit sys-
tem in the entire country. What they 
want us to do is to work together to 
get something done. 
The Speaker is staking her political 
capital on what benefits her the most 
politically, and what is crazy is that 
she benefits the most by having the 
highest death count. She is benefiting 
the most by having our economy suf-
fering as much as possible. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
the gentleman from New York an addi-
tional 1 minute. 
Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, this is the 
type of political calculation that my 
constituents 
absolutely 
hate. 
The 
Speaker’s biggest decision, when we all 
go home and we go home without a 
deal, is picking between which of her 
expensive flavors of gourmet ice cream 
to eat or which closed-down salon to 
get her next blowout at; but for that 
furloughed airline worker, they are ex-
pecting us to get the job done. 
I will tell you what, Mr. Speaker. 
There is a real deal on the table, and 
right now, before we leave, I beg my 
colleagues—I 
see 
Congressman 
ESPAILLAT here. He has been leading 
the charge on MTA funding. I thank 
the gentleman. 
We are all working together as Re-
publicans and Democrats to get the 
victory over the finish line. This Cham-
ber cannot leave without actually get-
ting this done. I tell my Republican 
colleagues and my Democratic col-
leagues in the House and in the Senate: 
Do not leave without getting a deal 
done. This Heroes Act is dead on ar-
rival, and we all know that. 
b 1715 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I would 
address my friend from New York. 
Thank you for expressing the real 
needs of New York, and I do hope you 
will vote for this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. 
CLYBURN), the majority whip. 
Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding me the 
time.

this pandemic is effective, efficient, 
and equitable. 
The Heroes Act will make this out-
come possible. The Select Committee 
has heard from public health experts 
that testing, tracing, and targeted con-
tainment are needed to safely reopen. 
This bill includes $75 billion for these 
public health measures. 
We heard from essential workers 
risking their lives, doing their jobs 
during this pandemic. Mayors of both 
political parties told us significant 
Federal assistance is needed to prevent 
sharp cuts to jobs and vital services. 
This bill includes $436 billion for 
State, local, territorial, and Tribal 
governments to support our heroes and 
those they serve. It protects workers 
by directing OSHA to issue an effective 
infection control standard. 
The Select Committee’s investiga-
tions have found that PPP and other 
relief programs need to be improved to 
reach the most vulnerable businesses. 
The Heroes Act sets aside funds for the 
smallest businesses, struggling non- 
profits, and second loans to the busi-
nesses that have suffered the most. The 
bill would assist restaurants and air-
port concessionaires who have been es-
pecially hard hit. 
Educators and public health experts 
advised 
us 
how 
to 
safely 
reopen 
schools. This legislation provides ro-
bust funding to enable schools to edu-
cate students while minimizing health 
risks. 
Mr. Speaker, the current Federal Re-
serve chair and his two immediate 
predecessors told us that Congress 
must provide additional fiscal support 
for a strong recovery. This bill extends 
enhanced unemployment benefits, pro-
vides additional direct payments, ex-
pands food assistance, and provides 
housing support. 
Finally, voting rights advocates and 
infectious disease doctors alike, told 
the Select Committee that to ensure a 
free, fair, and safe election, we must 
follow science-based recommendations 
for expanded mail-in voting, early vot-
ing, and polling places. The Heroes Act 
provides the funds for election admin-
istration and the Postal Service needed 
to safeguard our democracy. 
Mr. Speaker, I always say that if the 
difference between me and an opponent 
on any issue requires five steps, I don’t 
mind taking three of them. But I hope 
the other side will meet us by taking 
two. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. ALLEN). 
Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, here we 
are once again debating a partisan 
messaging bill that will never become 
law. The Heroes Act 2.0 is the Demo-
crat’s costly attempt to appease their 
far-left base, and it comes with a $2.2 
trillion price tag. 
To name just a few of the progressive 
provisions of this bill, their social wish 
list includes allowing illegal immi-
grants to receive direct stimulus pay-
ments, 
defunding 
the 
police, 
sub-
sidizing 
ObamaCare, 
and 
removing 
safeguards that would prevent tax-
payer money from bailing out Planned 
Parenthood. 
While American families, workers, 
and businesses are keeping their heads 
down working to revitalize our econ-
omy, Speaker PELOSI and the Demo-
cratic leadership are moving forward 
with a bill that largely has nothing to 
do in addressing the COVID–19 pan-
demic, and are ignoring moving for-
ward legislation that could imme-
diately support our small businesses. 
Thanks to the leadership of our Gov-
ernor in my home State of Georgia, we 
are open for business and leading the 
Nation in economic recovery. Our big-
gest problem is that we do still have 
businesses that need help. But I hear 
from business leaders every day that 
we must stop this expanded unemploy-
ment because, as their requirements 
grow, they need their employees to 
come back to work. 
Our COVID cases are down 28 percent. 
Hospitalizations are down 60 percent. 
But, yes, we still have businesses that 
need help. That is why I signed the dis-
charge petition, right down there, to 
bring legislation to the floor to extend 
the Paycheck Protection Program, and 
I urge my colleagues to sign that so 
that we can get meaningful help to 
those businesses that need it. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge the Speaker to 
stop holding hostage critical assistance 
for our small businesses and oppose 
this partisan power grab. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the distinguished gentle-
woman from Florida (Ms. WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ), the chairwoman of the Mili-
tary Construction, Veterans Affairs 
and Related Agencies Subcommittee. 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for 
yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, after four, long painful 
months, Senate Republicans continue 
to block the House-passed Heroes Act 
to provide coronavirus relief to the fed- 
up American people. Since May, thou-
sands more businesses have folded, mil-
lions remain jobless, and U.S. deaths 
doubled to 200,000. 
Democrats have been negotiating in 
good faith. We were at $3 trillion for 
our original Heroes Act. We have asked 
the Republicans who were at $1 trillion 
to meet us halfway, and here we are, 
with them still stuck in the mud, re-
fusing to do what the American people 
need us to do, to help make sure they 
can recover from this deadly viral pan-
demic. 
Sadly, Republicans think we are 
being too generous with the American 
people, so many of whom are strug-
gling to stay healthy amid a global 
pandemic and pay their bills since the 
worst recession since the Great Depres-
sion. My Governor just let a morato-
rium on evictions expire. He just re-
opened the State to 100 percent capac-
ity, as if the virus is not still ram-
paging through our State. 
Democrats offered this updated He-
roes Act to defeat this virus and put 
money in the pockets of stressed Amer-
icans. It is way past time for Repub-
licans to meet us halfway. 
This bill improves the Paycheck Pro-
tection Program for small businesses 
and non-profits and provides billions to 
local governments and schools. 
This bill funds testing and tracing, 
provides $1,200 in direct payments to 
Americans, extends $600—not $400—of 
Federal unemployment payments, and 
extends the vital Payroll Support Pro-
gram for airline workers, thousands of 
whom were laid off starting today. 
It also funds daycare, spreads Afford-
able Care Act coverage, and bolsters 
housing and food assistance, while pro-
tecting our elections by strengthening 
the Census and the Postal Service. 
It does not go as far as Democrats 
would like—that is because we are here 
to compromise, because we know the 
American people need us to do that— 
but it goes a long way to offer what 
Americans desperately need right now. 
Republicans need to stop standing in 
the way of relief and come to the table 
so that we can send home a package 
that is going to take care of the Amer-
ican people in this dire time. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
3 minutes to the gentleman from Lou-
isiana (Mr. SCALISE), the Republican 
whip. 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in opposition to this partisan bill 
that is not focused on helping families 
and small businesses. Everybody in 
this Chamber knows that this bill is 
going nowhere because they didn’t even 
work with Republicans to try to draft a 
proposal that could actually address 
the needs of families who are strug-
gling. 
There is a bill already filed at the 
door right over there, a bill that would 
help every small business, renew the 
Paycheck Protection Program using 
existing money—there are $138 billion 
frozen in an account that we unlock 
with 
Chabot’s 
bill. 
Congressman 
CHABOT has a bill with a discharge peti-
tion that would actually, in a bipar-
tisan way, help small businesses go for 
a second round of Paycheck Protection 
funding. 
And what do we get? Do we get today 
a bill that was brought together by 
both sides to solve this problem? 
No, we don’t. 
We have a bill that was drawn up ba-
sically using the old-failed roadmap of 
the original Heroes Act. Now they had 
the Heroes Act passed in a partisan 
way—it was never going to go any-
where—months ago. 
Did they say, okay, let’s work with 
Republicans? 
Let’s 
work 
with 
the 
President? 
No, they didn’t. They said, Okay, we 
want to present a scaled-down bill. 
Mr. Speaker, when they scaled the 
bill down, did they cut the billions of 
dollars of funding to illegal immi-
grants that was in the original Heroes 
Act? 
No, they didn’t. 
Did they cut the hundreds of billions 
of dollars that go to failed States,

States that had billion-dollar deficits 
prior to COVID? 
No, they kept that money. 
And in fact, if you look at the things 
that had nothing to do with COVID— 
for example, mandating that States 
that currently require picture IDs have 
to remove that, ballot harvesting, 
which we have seen in so many States, 
leads to voter fraud. That is what is in 
the original Heroes Act. That still re-
mains in this bill. What does that have 
to do with COVID relief? 
And so if you look, take the original 
bill, the original Heroes Act had $600 
million for police funding, community 
policing, things that have been proven 
effective 
to 
make 
our 
community 
safer, that was in the original Heroes 
Act. When they decided to cut—again, 
they didn’t cut the billions for people 
here illegally, they still get cash pay-
ments if they are here illegally. They 
cut the police, zeroed out—$600 million 
defunding the police at a time when 
our communities need help. This was 
the original bill. The $600 million, it is 
gone. That is what they cut. They kept 
the illegal money, checks going to 
illegals. 
Everybody knows this bill is going 
nowhere because it is a partisan hack 
job. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
CARSON of Indiana). The time of the 
gentleman has expired. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
an additional 1 minute to the gen-
tleman. 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, 23 Demo-
crats, just a few days ago sent a letter 
to the Speaker saying, ‘‘Passing a bi-
partisan 
COVID–19 
relief 
package 
should be our number one priority in 
the coming days. It is our request that 
you continue to negotiate towards a bi-
partisan deal. Otherwise, a discharge 
petition is the only potential option for 
COVID–19 related action. . . . ’’ That 
was 23 Democrats. 
Mr. Speaker, that is enough people, if 
they go down, right over there and sign 
that discharge petition, it will bring 
that bipartisan relief package bill to 
the floor, helping small businesses. We 
already helped millions of small busi-
nesses stay afloat with the original 
Paycheck Protection Program, an in-
credibly bipartisan success story that 
we came together to pass. Over 50 mil-
lion jobs were saved by that. 
Mr. Speaker, we know now some of 
those businesses are doing better, but 
some of those businesses are still 
struggling, in fact, dying on the vine. 
And this bill will give them relief. 
They can go for a second round of relief 
requests, PPP funding with money that 
already exists, not $2.2 trillion bor-
rowed from China. 
Let’s pass a real bill, the Chabot bill. 
Let’s reject this partisan exercise. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the distinguished gen-
tleman 
from 
Rhode 
Island 
(Mr. 
CICILLINE). 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I am mindful today that 
the Major League Baseball playoffs are 
starting. While House Democrats are 
ready, once again, to step up to the 
plate and pass urgently needed relief 
for our constituents, Senate Repub-
licans and the White House refuse to 
play ball. But sadly, unlike a ball 
game, their refusal will have deadly 
consequences. 
This updated, much-needed bill ad-
dresses the seriousness of both the pub-
lic health crisis and the economic cri-
sis American families are dealing with. 
It provides strong support for small 
businesses, non-profits, and gives a life-
line to the struggling restaurant indus-
try and independent live-venue opera-
tors. 
It gives additional assistance for air-
line industry workers, extending the 
Payroll Support Program, and adds 
more funds to bolster education and 
childcare. 
Living up to its name, Heroes 2.0 
honors our heroes on the front line by 
providing assistance to State and local 
governments 
who 
desperately 
need 
funding to pay vital workers, like first 
responders and healthcare workers who 
are keeping us safe. It provides funds 
for coronavirus testing, tracing, and 
ensures every American can access free 
coronavirus treatment. 
These are not radical ideas. This is 
the basic responsibility to keep the 
American people healthy and safe. 
It provides additional direct pay-
ments with a more robust second round 
of economic stimulus checks of $1,200 
per taxpayer and $500 per dependent. 
It ensures worker safety by requiring 
OSHA to issue a strong, enforceable 
standard for all workplaces to develop 
and implement infection control plans. 
And it protects Americans from los-
ing their employer-provided health in-
surance by making unemployed Ameri-
cans automatically eligible to receive 
the maximum ACA subsidy on the ex-
changes. 
b 1730 
It restores the $600 weekly unemploy-
ment benefits through next January. 
It helps struggling families afford a 
safe place to live, assisting renters and 
homeowners make monthly rent, mort-
gage, and utility payments, preventing 
homelessness in the middle of a global 
health pandemic. 
It addresses rising hunger with an in-
crease in maximum SNAP benefits. 
Finally, it safeguards our democracy 
with new resources to ensure safe elec-
tions, an accurate Census, and pre-
serving the Postal Service. 
I have heard my Republican friends 
say these are radical, far-left ideas. 
These are core American responsibil-
ities that we should address in a bipar-
tisan way. 
We have met you halfway. That is 
the compromise. Your constituents are 
suffering. They need your help. Vote 
‘‘yes.’’ 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX), the ranking 
member of the Education and Labor 
Committee. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, our colleagues across the 
aisle try to convince Americans that 
this bill is a compromise and bipar-
tisan. That is a joke, Mr. Speaker. 
Compromise, to Democrats, means do 
it their way. 
When it comes to spending taxpayer 
dollars, hard-earned money, though, 
the Democrats just can’t seem to help 
themselves. The latest example is this 
$2.2 trillion socialist wish list, which is 
riddled with radical left priorities that 
are unrelated to the pandemic. 
For example, it props up failing pen-
sion plans for select community news-
papers. What does this have to do with 
the COVID–19 pandemic? The news-
paper industry has been in decline for 
decades, and these companies have had 
a longstanding inability to meet their 
pension obligations. 
The bill also forgives up to $10,000 of 
private student loan debt. Again, this 
does nothing to combat COVID–19. But 
massive loan forgiveness, despite the 
high cost to taxpayers, has long been a 
Democrat objective. 
So why are we considering this par-
tisan scheme? Because come election 
day, Democrats are hoping to cash in 
on this bill’s many empty promises. 
It is disingenuous and it is dis-
appointing. We all must vote ‘‘no.’’ 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. ESPAILLAT). 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, the 
Heroes Act is what America needs. It is 
what my State of New York needs. 
Nearly $7 billion for public transpor-
tation, that is a compromise. 
Aid to struggling small businesses, 
including restaurants, that is a com-
promise. 
Billions of dollars to help schools op-
erate safely and to help parents afford 
childcare and get back to work, that is 
a compromise. 
Another round of stimulus checks for 
the American people, that is a com-
promise, Mr. Speaker. 
Billions of dollars for emergency 
rental assistance as people face evic-
tions and people don’t know where 
they are going to get the money to pay 
their rent, they are backed up, that is 
a compromise. 
And, finally, Mr. Speaker, help for 
States and local government—not red 
States and blue States, all States. Last 
time I checked, it was all the United 
States of America. Let’s help all the 
States. They are not getting the rev-
enue that they need. That is a com-
promise. 
I said the last time we passed the He-
roes Act back in May that it was a 
good thing. I say today that this is a 
real good thing, and it is a com-
promise. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
3 minutes to the gentleman from South 
Carolina (Mr. RICE). 
Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, Democrats claim to be the

party of the little guy. It is easy to 
talk, but actions speak louder than 
words. 
Republicans have offered plan after 
plan to help ordinary people who need 
it and to help small businesses strug-
gling to survive, businesses like the 
1,700 restaurants along the Myrtle 
Beach Grand Strand back home that 
have been devastated by this pandemic. 
If Speaker PELOSI would allow a vote 
on any of these bills, they would pass 
the House and Senate easily, and folks 
back home would get the help they 
need. 
But Democrats have blocked every 
plan to help the little guy unless we 
also bail out broke blue States and re-
store the deduction for State and local 
taxes for millionaires and billionaires. 
You see, 90 percent of the benefit of the 
State tax deduction goes to earners in 
the top 10 percent. Over 50 percent of 
the benefit goes to millionaires and bil-
lionaires in the top 1 percent, who 
don’t need a bailout. 
Take Michael Bloomberg, for exam-
ple. He made over $3.5 billion last year. 
Mr. Bloomberg works in New York 
City, which has a combined State and 
local income tax rate of 12.5 percent. 
That means restoring the State and 
local tax deduction would reduce Mr. 
Bloomberg’s taxes by $160 million. 
That is right, Mr. Bloomberg would get 
a $160 million bailout. 
For months, the Democratic leader-
ship has held back help for the little 
guy who desperately needs it as ransom 
unless we agree to give a bailout to bil-
lionaires like Michael Bloomberg, who 
would get an extra $160 million. Why 
would they do that? 
Remember in the Presidential debate 
when Michael Bloomberg bragged that 
he spent $100 million to buy 21 new 
Democrat seats and put NANCY PELOSI 
in charge? Now we know why. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. GREEN). 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
how can one say you love the police 
but you won’t fund the municipality 
that pays the police? 
How can you say that you want your 
children to be taught well in a safe en-
vironment, but you won’t fund the bill 
that would fund the school system so 
that they can be taught well and be in 
a safe environment? 
How can you say you want your fires 
to be fought but you won’t protect fire-
fighters? This bill does that. 
Here is why you can’t say you pro-
tect firefighters and would fund the po-
lice: It is because Senator MCCONNELL 
has said, openly and notoriously, he 
would have the States go bankrupt. 
Bankruptcy is not the way to go for 
heroes, for firefighters, for police offi-
cers, for teachers. 
It is time to compromise. This is the 
bill to be voted on, not the one that is 
in your mind. Compromise, not the 
mind. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Wis-
consin (Mr. GROTHMAN). 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, there 
are a lot of provisions in this bill that 
are offensive. My colleague, Congress-
man RICE, just pointed out the tax cut 
aimed primarily at the very wealthy. 
But I am going to focus on the $1,200. 
In my prior life, I used to be an es-
tate planning attorney, and I would 
write out wills. People would come in 
to see me, and one of their goals was to 
leave a shot in the arm, leave some-
thing for the next generation, save up 
some money and give them part of a 
house, part of a bank account. 
In this bill, the $1,200 to everybody in 
the country, including people who do 
not need any extra assistance because 
of this, is a little bit offensive. 
I don’t know who put together this 
bill, but kind of unlike the Greatest 
Generation that always wanted to 
leave a little more assets to their chil-
dren and grandchildren, this bill lets 
everybody spend $1,200 so they can 
leave increased debt to their children 
and grandchildren. I think that is a lit-
tle bit embarrassing. 
The second thing that I would point 
out is that the $1,200 goes not just to 
American citizens but to illegal immi-
grants, and this is part of a scary trend 
around here. Whether you are talking 
about free medical care for illegal im-
migrants, welfare for illegal immi-
grants, or, now, $1,200 checks to illegal 
immigrants, it is just sending us down 
the wrong way and pretending we don’t 
even have a country here at all. 
Not to mention, at least, when I went 
to my local Walmart, he said the last 
time you sent out these checks, there 
were huge amounts of increase in 
spending in the electronics depart-
ment. So we are going to send the next 
generation further into debt so this 
generation can buy more, or at least 
part of this generation can buy more, 
electronic 
junk 
from 
China 
at 
Walmart. 
I just can’t imagine what went on in 
the room when they put together this 
deal, but I am voting ‘‘no’’ tomorrow 
or later tonight. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. LEE), a senior member of 
the Appropriations Committee. 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the Chair for her tremendous 
leadership and that of her staff for get-
ting us to this point on behalf of the 
American people and ensuring that we 
put forth a bill that will ensure that 
they know that we care about their 
health and economic security during 
this very serious moment. 
Also, I just want to thank Speaker 
PELOSI and Chairman PALLONE for in-
cluding language that will help reach 
communities 
disproportionately 
im-
pacted by this deadly virus, as in the 
African-American, indigenous, Black 
and Brown community, the AAPI com-
munities, and also treat them as part-
ners to defeat COVID. 
Now, it has been 41⁄2 months since the 
House passed the Heroes Act. Since 
January, over 200,000 people have died. 
People are terrified about keeping 
their families healthy and safe. They 
are terrified about keeping their jobs 
and their homes and their businesses. 
And, still, Republicans continue to 
block this critical relief from moving 
forward. 
Sadly, but not surprisingly, Black 
and Brown people are getting the worst 
of this. Forty thousand African Ameri-
cans have died from COVID, one out of 
every five COVID deaths in America. 
Indigenous and Latinx people are each 
50 percent more likely to die from 
COVID than White Americans. And 20 
percent of all deaths in my district are 
from the AAPI community. 
It is clear that the President has no 
plan. That is why Democrats are tak-
ing action, to be sure that we have the 
robust national testing, tracing, and 
treatment efforts to reduce the trans-
mission and the deaths that we are ex-
periencing every day. All of us know 
people who have died from this horrific 
pandemic. 
Also, we were able to include funding 
for SNAP benefits, unemployment pay-
ments, childcare, and education, in-
cluding funding for my own community 
in Alameda County. 
I am also pleased that the bill con-
tains necessary contributions to the 
global efforts to fight COVID. This pan-
demic does not respect borders. We 
need to work with partners around the 
globe if we are going to get COVID 
under control. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield an 
additional 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from California. 
Mr. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, 
let me also say how important it is 
that we really understand and recog-
nize that this is a global pandemic and 
it knows no borders. 
This bill will also ramp up testing, 
contact tracing, and outreach to en-
sure that those communities most im-
pacted are supported. It strengthens 
outreach 
to 
medically 
underserved 
communities. Again, Black and Brown 
and indigenous people have suffered the 
most from COVID. 
This bill will ensure that the testing 
and tracing efforts treat people of color 
as partners in engaging their commu-
nities. 
This is a health and economic pan-
demic of enormous proportions that we 
have never experienced in our lifetime. 
We must make sure that people have 
safe places to work and attend school. 
Their health and economic needs are 
addressed in this bill. We cannot have 
one without the other. 
So let’s pass this comprehensive re-
lief. Let’s begin to try to heal our 
country. Please support this bill, and I 
ask for an ‘‘aye’’ vote. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to gentleman from Colorado 
(Mr. NEGUSE). 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the updated Heroes 
Act.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5424 
October 1, 2020 
I want to thank House leadership 
and, of course, our distinguished chair 
of 
the 
Appropriations 
Committee, 
Chairwoman LOWEY, for introducing 
this vital update. 
First, let me just say, look, we are 
all entitled to our own views and opin-
ions in this Chamber, but we are not 
entitled to our own set of facts. 
As I have heard some of the com-
ments from my friends on the other 
side of the aisle, I have been a bit con-
fused because, as we all know, 4 
months ago, this Chamber passed, on a 
bipartisan basis, the Heroes Act, $3.4 
trillion, to provide an economic lifeline 
to small business and working families 
struggling across this country. 
The 
Senate 
declared 
a 
so-called 
pause, decided that they would do 
nothing, wouldn’t meet us halfway, 
wouldn’t come talk to the House 
Democrats to try to reach a com-
promise bill. So we continued to get to 
work, and we put together an updated 
Heroes Act that is now a $2 trillion bill 
that provides an economic lifeline to so 
many 
Americans 
across our great 
country. 
The fact that House Democrats con-
tinue to make every effort to work 
with anyone in good faith to deliver for 
the people of our country, in my view, 
is something that we should continue 
to pursue in this great Chamber. 
b 1745 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield an 
additional minute to the gentleman 
from Colorado (Mr. NEGUSE). 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
say one of the reasons I support this 
bill is because it includes significant 
relief for small businesses, which are 
the backbone of Colorado’s economy. 
My Republican colleague and I, JOHN 
CURTIS, introduced a bill just a few 
weeks ago to provide EIDL relief, es-
sentially ensuring that we would ex-
clude the EIDL advance when deter-
mining forgiveness for PPP loans. 
We have heard from countless busi-
ness owners in my district, in Fort Col-
lins and Loveland, who are struggling 
and who have told us that this provi-
sion would provide needed relief to en-
sure that they can continue to keep 
their businesses solvent, keep their 
doors open, serving the people of our 
great State of Colorado and, of course, 
my colleague, the State of Utah, and 
small business owners across the coun-
try. 
That provision is in this bill. It is in 
the updated Heroes Act, alongside so 
many other important provisions to 
help small businesses in our country 
recover. 
I say to my colleagues: Let’s get this 
done. Let’s pass this bill. Let’s provide 
the relief that the American people are 
counting on us to provide. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to yield 1 minute to the gentle-
woman 
from 
Washington 
(Ms. 
SCHRIER). 
Ms. SCHRIER. Mr. Speaker, the peo-
ple in my district continue to struggle 
with the economic effects of COVID–19. 
My constituents and small business 
owners will be so relieved to know that 
help that they need is one step closer 
to being here, including more assist-
ance to small businesses, funding for 
childcare and education, enhanced un-
employment benefits, and rental assist-
ance. 
Several of my bills to help children 
and families have been included in this 
package as well, including increasing 
funding for child abuse prevention and 
more help fighting hunger and boosting 
access to fresh fruits and vegetables. 
Finally, as a doctor, I am very happy 
that my legislation to improve edu-
cation about vaccines, including a fu-
ture or many future COVID–19 vac-
cines, is in this package. It is impor-
tant that the American people feel con-
fident that whatever vaccine does get 
approval, it is truly safe and effective, 
and that education begins now. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I am de-
lighted to yield 5 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
WATERS), the chair of the Committee 
on Financial Services. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of the House amend-
ment to H.R. 925, the updated version 
of the Heroes Act. 
Mr. Speaker, Democrats have been 
working every single day to respond to 
this pandemic and provide much-need-
ed relief and protection for families 
across the country. 139 days ago, House 
Democrats voted to pass the Heroes 
Act. Unfortunately, President Trump, 
MITCH MCCONNELL, and Senate Repub-
licans have blocked the bill and pre-
vented the essential relief the legisla-
tion provides from reaching our neigh-
borhoods and our communities. 
Meanwhile, the Nation continues to 
suffer during this crisis. Even before 
this pandemic, over half a million peo-
ple in the United States were experi-
encing homelessness, including more 
than 50,000 families with children. It is 
likely that this number has grown sig-
nificantly due to the pandemic. 
We also continue to head toward a 
catastrophic eviction crisis as families 
struggle to pay rent and months of un-
paid back rent pile up. Today, the rent 
is due, but an estimated 14.2 million 
renter households cannot pay it and 
are at risk of eviction and homeless-
ness. 
In my State of California, there are 
1.7 million renter households who are 
behind on rent and facing eviction. At 
the same time, more than 8 million 
homeowners, including almost 780,000 
homeowners in California, have al-
ready fallen behind on their mortgage 
payments. Making matters worse, over 
1 million small businesses have closed. 
To address the ongoing crisis, the up-
dated Heroes Act creates a $50 billion 
emergency rental assistance fund and a 
$21 billion homeowner assistance fund, 
and it provides $5 billion in funding for 
homeless services providers. 
Through no fault of their own, mil-
lions of people are also unable to make 
payments on credit cards, car loans, 
and their mortgages or rent. By sus-
pending negative credit reporting dur-
ing the COVID–19 period, the Heroes 
Act ensures that these innocent con-
sumers do not suffer further damage. 
The Heroes Act also suspends debt 
collection for consumers, small busi-
nesses, and nonprofits during this pan-
demic. Additionally, private student 
loan borrowers in economic distress, 
who are disproportionately people of 
color, will get up to $10,000 in debt re-
lief under the bill. 
The Nation continues to face short-
ages of essential medical supplies and 
equipment. For example, our heroic 
healthcare workers are still reusing 
N95 respirator masks at a time when 
cases of COVID–19 continue to rise. The 
Heroes Act strengthens the Defense 
Production Act to supercharge the pro-
duction of these supplies and works to 
ensure that funds are directed to al-
leviate those shortages. 
The updated Heroes Act also builds 
upon my efforts and those of members 
of my committee to remove barriers 
for Community Development Financial 
Institutions—that is, the CDFIs—and 
the minority depository institutions, 
better known as MDIs, trying to serve 
low-and moderate-income communities 
during the pandemic. 
For example, the bill provides $15 bil-
lion in capital and other assistance for 
CDFIs and MDIs to bolster financing 
activity 
in 
minority 
communities, 
which have been hardest hit by this 
pandemic. 
Mr. Speaker, I am so pleased that the 
bill provides another round of stimulus 
payments for families and additional 
funding for small business, including 
$120 billion for restaurants and airport 
concessionaires. 
Importantly, the bill directs the 
Treasury Secretary to work with the 
global community to immediately pro-
vide $2 trillion in relief through the 
International Monetary Fund, which 
will immediately support developing 
countries that are experiencing some of 
the worst effects of COVID–19. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill isn’t every-
thing that is needed, but it is a good 
faith effort to bridge the gap in nego-
tiations 
with 
our 
Republican 
col-
leagues. It is time for Republicans to 
stop blocking coronavirus relief and 
support this legislation. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Texas 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, the 
American people cannot wait. Help is 
on the way, and the only thing I can 
ask from my Republican friends is to

take a walk in neighborhoods in their 
districts around the Nation where 
mothers and fathers are waiting on a 
disbursement needed to put food on 
their table. 
This $2.2 trillion bill is going to help 
businesses, nonprofits, and faith insti-
tutions with the PPP. It is going to 
give us protective equipment. Yes, the 
engine of our communities, small inde-
pendent restaurants, are getting close 
to $120 billion; more funds to bolster 
education and childcare; schools that 
cannot open because they do not have 
the resources; money for testing—I 
have opened 33 testing sites in our 
neighborhoods; 
contact 
tracing, 
of 
course; making sure the cities’ and 
counties’ essential workers and hazard 
pay is paid. 
Is anyone asking the American peo-
ple if they are suffering and need this 
resource 
to 
help 
them? 
To 
fight 
COVID–19, we have to stop the evic-
tions; 
stop 
the 
foreclosures; 
give 
healthcare, clothes, food, and security; 
make sure we take care of small busi-
nesses, education; and give our people a 
lifeline. 
The American people can’t wait. Now 
is the time to help them. Vote on the 
Heroes Act for this money and this re-
lief. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I am de-
lighted to yield 1 minute to the gentle-
men from Illinois (Mr. GARCI´A). 
Mr. GARCI´A of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, 
I want to thank Representative LOWEY 
for this minute. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of the revised Heroes Act because my 
community cannot wait. 
Schoolteachers, 
flight 
attendants, 
and working families are facing lay-
offs, and they need our help now. 
Tenants and homeowners facing evic-
tions and homelessness need our sup-
port now. 
Immigrants with U.S.-born children 
and U.S. citizens who never received 
the stimulus check need our support 
now. 
We passed the Heroes Act 41⁄2 months 
ago. 
Republicans 
in 
the 
Senate 
wouldn’t even consider it. But this is a 
bill that we are offering as a com-
promise, and it is common ground be-
cause, just like my colleagues across 
the aisle, I am headed home to my con-
stituents, and I don’t want them to 
think that we failed them. 
House Democrats have done our jobs. 
We passed relief, and we are doing it 
again. It is the President and Senate 
Republicans who refuse to pass relief 
that have failed. 
Give the American people the relief 
that they need so urgently. I urge 
adoption. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I am de-
lighted to yield 1 minute to the distin-
guished gentlewoman from California 
(Ms. PELOSI), the Speaker of the House. 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I am hon-
ored to be on the floor today to support 
a bill brought to the floor by the dis-
tinguished chair of the Appropriations 
Committee, NITA
LOWEY
from New 
York. Her service on that committee 
for decades has been a blessing to our 
country. 
I have seen firsthand her leadership 
for America’s families, for our country, 
for our communities, and for our chil-
dren. We have worked together on 
women’s issues, HIV/AIDS, you name 
it, 
every 
subject, 
minority 
health 
issues and the rest. 
And here we are today with this leg-
islation that is so needed for our coun-
try. 
It is really hard to understand what 
it is that people would oppose in the 
legislation. The Appropriations Com-
mittee has done a masterful job. 
You have been a maestro, Madam 
Chair, as well as your staff, for putting 
this legislation together. 
I am in Congress because of children. 
I am always here for the children. I 
wanted to start my comments by say-
ing what this legislation would mean 
to a family of four. 
b 1800 
This is a lifeline for workers and fam-
ilies who are facing this coronavirus 
disaster. For a family of four earning 
$24,000, Heroes 2 would mean direct 
payments, a $3,400 direct payment; un-
employment benefits of $600 per week 
in enhanced UI benefits; tax credits up 
to $5,920 through the EITC, and a fully 
refundable $4,000 tax credit, equaling 
an additional $1,200 in refunds. 
I mention that because some have 
said: Why don’t you like this other bill 
and that bill? None of that that I just 
said, the tax credits, the earned income 
tax credit, the fully refundable child 
tax credit, none of that is in any of the 
Republican bills. None of the bills that 
you have seen other than this bill has 
that consideration for children. 
So when people say: Well, why don’t 
you take a half a loaf? Because the 
children need more than the heel of a 
loaf of bread. They need the best we 
can do for them. 
It has an increase in SNAP benefits, 
an increase of $100 a month in most 
States, plus rental assistance and the 
ACA premium subsidy. This gives im-
mediate eligibility for parents losing 
their jobs for the maximum health in-
surance premium subsidy under the Af-
fordable Care Act, a benefit worth 
$1,386 per month. 
Now, we can’t do everything in a bill 
that is coronavirus focused. We have 
challenges in our country that we must 
address in a bigger way. But what we 
have here is coronavirus-centric, and 
that is important to note because peo-
ple are suffering in a different way. 
Many of these families are food inse-
cure. Millions of children in our coun-
try are food insecure, and this Heroes 
Act addresses some of that. 
So in addition to thanking NITA 
LOWEY
for her leadership, I salute 
BOBBY SCOTT for our children and for 
our workers. We want our children to 
go back to school. We want them to do 
so in a way that is safe. And BOBBY 
SCOTT has provisions in here for that, 
whether it is actually in school, wheth-
er it is virtual, whether it is hybrid, or 
whether it calls for the ventilation 
that is needed. 
And, again, for their fathers and 
mothers to go to work in a safe atmos-
phere by having strong OSHA language 
in here to protect workers. That is not 
in the Republican bill. That is not in 
the Republican bill. 
We can come to terms on money, but 
the language is what is important. 
The Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee chairman, FRANK PALLONE, 41⁄2 
months ago, and even before that, pro-
posed a strategic plan that I am sure 
he will talk about, and I thank him for 
that, a strategic plan in order to crush 
the virus. 
The Republicans want to crush the 
Affordable Care Act in a time of a pan-
demic, going into the Supreme Court 
to crush the Affordable Care Act. Why 
don’t we just come together, crush the 
virus? We can open our economy and 
our schools in a safe way. 
And I thank you, Chairman PALLONE, 
for your leadership. 
The Natural Resources Committee, 
Chairman RAU´ L GRIJALVA, what he has 
in the legislation is so important, espe-
cially addressing the needs of our Trib-
al communities in our country, which 
are so disproportionately affected by 
the coronavirus. I thank him for his 
leadership that in so many ways is in 
the legislation, but that being such an 
essential piece. 
I thank the Oversight Committee 
chairwoman, CAROLYN
MALONEY, for 
her leadership for the Postal Service, 
and I think we have finally gotten the 
message across on the Postal Service. 
Hopefully, we will get some coopera-
tion there. 
But not yet on the Census. The Cen-
sus is so important. It is the life blood 
of who we are, the DNA of America, the 
people, and we are having a problem 
with that. It is not even about money. 
It is about policy. So I thank Rep-
resentative MALONEY for her ongoing 
leadership, 4 years culminating in this 
legislation now. 
Small Business Committee Chair-
woman NYDIA VELA´ ZQUEZ, so knowl-
edgeable, for decades the chair or rank-
ing member of the Small Business 
Committee. She knows about women 
and minority-owned businesses, and 
the most optimistic thing a person can 
do is to, I say, plant a flag for a small 
business. 
How more optimistic can you be than 
to start a business? Perhaps, get mar-
ried, but you kind of know what your 
risks are there. 
But a small business, so needed the 
help in here for PPP, other help for 
hospitals—excuse me, for restaurants. 
Hospitals are in Mr. PALLONE’s section 
of the bill and the language for the 
healthcare providers is there. 
But back to NYDIA VELA´ ZQUEZ. This 
is a big piece of the bill.

So what do we do for PPP? What do 
we do for restaurants? What do we do 
for arenas, small spaces around the 
country for entertainment and bring-
ing 
people 
together—spatially 
distanced, of course. How do we bal-
ance all of this? 
That is language that we are trying 
to resolve in our negotiations. I am op-
timistic that we can get there, but we 
couldn’t do the best job possible with-
out the leadership of NYDIA VELA´ ZQUEZ. 
The Veterans’ Affairs Committee, I 
thank MARK TAKANO for his important 
work for our veterans and the re-
sources we have in the bill for our vet-
erans. 
Ways and Means Committee Chair-
man RICHIE NEAL just has been bril-
liant in how we put money in people’s 
pockets with direct payments and some 
of the other tax provisions that I 
talked about earlier for children that 
have no reference in the Republican 
bill as far as the children are con-
cerned. And, again, my top priority is 
the children. 
I thank PETER DEFAZIO, the chair of 
the Transportation and Infrastructure 
Committee for his leadership and hav-
ing the language in here, not just for 
the airlines, which is very, very impor-
tant, and that is important because it 
is an essential—it is important, but 
people should know, when they say, 
‘‘Well, why should we help airline em-
ployees?’’ well, we do because they 
have to have special certifications and 
special security clearances and the 
rest. If they lose a job and come back, 
it is months before they can come 
back, not like any other industry. So 
that is important. 
But Mr. DEFAZIO also has an impor-
tant chunk of money in the bill for 
transportation, writ large and some 
other 
ways, 
that 
is 
urgent 
and 
coronavirus connected. And that is 
very important, as well, and I thank 
him for his leadership in that regard. 
But read the bill. I salute the chairs. 
This is about having scientific, institu-
tional, academic bases for the amount 
of money that we are asking for. 
We had a bigger bill, 3.4. The other 
side said: We are not going there. 
So we came down a trillion dollars. 
No, not yet. 
We came down another $200 billion, 
not by violating any of our priorities, 
but by shortening the time, just short-
ening the timeframe and moving some 
issues to the other arena that Madam 
Chair works in and that are in our reg-
ular appropriations bills as we go for-
ward. 
So this is really important. One bill 
is not as good as another. 
Why not take something instead of 
nothing? 
Why should that be the standard for 
America’s children? We have to fight 
for the best that we can get for them, 
and I feel certain that we will have a 
level of success. People have to know. 
One of the problems that I have, the 
difference between the Democrats and 
the Republicans on this issue is, in the 
Republican bill, they have a $150 billion 
benefit for some of the wealthiest peo-
ple in our country—$150 billion. 
In our bill, we strive to have $149 bil-
lion for our children for the earned in-
come tax credit, for full refundability 
and the rest. 
No. 
So we took it down to $54 billion, and 
it was still waiting to see if we get ac-
ceptance of that. 
$150 billion for the wealthiest people 
in America, tax, net operating loss. 
149 for America’s working families, 
no. We took it down to 54. We took off 
$100 billion to gain agreement. 
This is not just a money debate and 
a language debate; it is a values de-
bate. It is important for people to 
know what this fight is about. 
So it is called the Heroes Act, and it 
is called the Heroes Act because we are 
honoring our heroes. Everybody wants 
to wave and have cutouts at the game 
and all that. Honor our heroes by mak-
ing sure they have their jobs. 
These are our healthcare workers, 
our police and fire first responders, our 
teachers, our transportation, our sani-
tation, our food workers and the rest 
who make our lives function. We 
couldn’t do what we do without them 
doing what they are doing. Many of 
them are risking their lives to save 
lives, and now they may lose their jobs. 
Why? 
Let the States go bankrupt. That is 
what MITCH MCCONNELL said. Let the 
States go bankrupt. 
And what did the President say? 
Well, those blue States, why should we 
send them any money? 
Because the people have needs, and 
we have to meet them. 
We lose all ability to thank them if 
we say: That is nice, but we don’t care 
if you lose your job. You can go on un-
employment insurance. 
What have we accomplished? We have 
diminished the services to people, prob-
ably raise taxes in some of these 
places, and people lose their jobs. Over 
a million, closer to a million and a half 
of State and locals have lost their jobs 
already, and it is predicted that 31⁄2 
million more will lose their jobs if we 
don’t act on this. 
So this is an important pillar of this 
bill, supporting State and local govern-
ment. That is one of the areas that we 
are, shall we say, negotiating. 
Next, crush the virus. Mr. PALLONE 
has a plan. Crush the virus so that we 
can again open our schools, our busi-
nesses, our economy. And we are long 
overdue. 
Well, this bill is 41⁄2 months old be-
cause, at the time we passed it, the 
leader in the Senate, Mr. MCCONNELL, 
pushed the pause button. He pushed the 
pause button. We have got to wait and 
see. 
Since that time, over 100,000 people 
have died. Hundreds of thousands have 
become infected because he pushed the 
pause button and said: Let the States 
go bankrupt. 
So this is why we come here today, 
to debate policy on how we think we 
can best meet the needs of the Amer-
ican people. And we think we can best 
meet the needs of the American people 
with the provisions in this bill. I 
thought it was really important for us 
to formally put forth the work of our 
chairs, which is excellent, which meets 
the needs of the people. 
Representative WATERS, you heard 
from her earlier. Families are on the 
verge of eviction. Families on the 
verge of eviction get support in this 
legislation. 
People who can’t pay their mort-
gages are helped in this legislation. I 
thank Chairwoman WATERS for that as 
well. It is her work on the restaurant 
legislation to help many more small 
businesses get help from this legisla-
tion. 
This is a tall order. 
People say, well, we should have a 
skinny package. No, we don’t have a 
skinny problem; we have got a massive 
problem. 
Now, you don’t believe so much more 
in the role of government than we do. 
Let’s come together, find our common 
ground, but let’s not just say let the 
children pay the price because we want 
to have a bipartisan bill. 
No, we don’t want the children to pay 
the price so we can have a bipartisan 
bill. We want to have a bipartisan bill 
that supports the children. I feel con-
fident that we can do that. 
But we can’t do that if we take the 
path of least resistance and just say 
let’s do whatever they put forth. That 
is doing their bill. That is not doing 
the people’s work. 
So, again, over 200,000 people, we 
know 207,000 people have already died, 
more than 7 million affected. A million 
people in the world have died. 
We have legislation because of Chair-
woman LOWEY’s expertise, respect in 
the world. We have provisions in the 
bill that affect our relationship in 
terms of how we fight the COVID virus 
globally, because none of us is safe un-
less we make sure that all of us are 
safe. 
So I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this legisla-
tion. It goes a long way to doing what 
we need to do. It sets an example that, 
as I say, we cut a lot out by just cut-
ting the time on it. Pretty soon, we 
will have to have legislation again. 
That will be probably next year. And 
this legislation goes to early next year 
rather than later next year, but the 
timing is really important to do it 
now. It is long overdue. It is what this 
country needs. 
And, again, I say thank you to our 
heroes. We thank you by making sure 
you have the job, the benefits, and the 
rest that you have earned, and by not 
just giving you empty gratitude but 
the gratitude of supporting you and the 
important roles that you play in our 
lives with assurance that you will have 
your job as you risk your lives to save 
lives.

school safely whether it is virtual, ac-
tual, or a hybrid, and when they do

that, they will do so in a way that we 
have enabled, because education has 
some funds in here, but without State 
and local, the education function can-
not be borne out to its fullest extent. 
Mr. Speaker, again, I thank the dis-
tinguished chairwoman for yielding me 
the time. I have great excitement be-
cause of the work of our chairs about 
the quality of this legislation and the 
necessity that we come as close to it in 
a negotiation for the children. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Con-
necticut (Ms. DELAURO), the chair of 
the Labor, Health and Human Services, 
Education, and Related Agencies Sub-
committee, and a hardworking, distin-
guished leader on all these issues. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, the peo-
ple of Connecticut and of the United 
States deserve no less than the full 
support of the Federal Government to 
get them to the dawn of a recovery. 
While the House passed a comprehen-
sive bill for the American people back 
in May, the Senate has failed to act. So 
we advanced this $2.2 trillion package 
that includes $2.7 billion for Con-
necticut to protect lives, livelihoods, 
and the life of our democracy. 
As chair of the Labor, Health and 
Human Services, Education, and Re-
lated Agencies Appropriations Sub-
committee, I am proud of the invest-
ments here for patients, working peo-
ple, children, seniors, and public edu-
cation. 
For health, we provide $75 billion for 
coronavirus testing, contact tracing, 
and isolation measures, and $28 billion 
for a safe and effective vaccine. 
For working people, we must save 
jobs, protect workers and their fami-
lies, so we strengthen, expand, and pro-
tect emergency paid leave. We restore 
the expanded $600 unemployment ben-
efit through the end of January. And 
we continue to support work share pro-
grams. 
For children and families, we must 
not allow a generation to be lost or to 
let their bright futures darken. We pro-
vide $182 billion for K–12 education, 
nearly $39 billion for post-secondary; 
along with the Child Care Is Essential 
Act, which I introduced with Chairman 
BOBBY SCOTT, for $15 billion to save the 
childcare industry; and then my legis-
lation to make the child tax credit 
fully refundable, to make it accessible 
to all, including the one-third pre-
viously excluded, including half of 
Black and Latinx children. 
I am proud of the provisions to in-
crease the maximum SNAP benefit by 
15 percent, to aid nutrition programs, 
food banks, farmers and producers, as 
well as small businesses and res-
taurants. 
Mr. Speaker, let us put politics sec-
ond and let us put people first. Let us 
vote ‘‘yes’’ on this relief bill for the 
people of this country, for the seniors, 
for the children, and those who every 
day are looking toward the Federal 
Government because they are in des-
perate shape and they need our help. 
They need this legislation. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. HOYER), the distinguished 
majority leader. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, we live in 
an interesting age. 
I rise in strong support of this legis-
lation. 
I have heard my Republican friends 
lament the fact that we have things in 
this bill that they don’t like and appar-
ently that the Senate doesn’t like. I 
have been here long enough to know 
and to serve when the Republicans 
were in charge. 
They passed bill after bill with par-
tisan provisions that they knew Presi-
dent Obama wouldn’t sign and that 
could not pass the United States Sen-
ate because they couldn’t get enough 
Democrats to get to 60 votes. They 
knew that. 
So both sides pass legislation that 
they think is good, notwithstanding 
the fact that the other side does not 
agree with some of the provisions in 
the bill. 
But, Mr. Speaker, this bill responds 
to the needs of the American people at 
a time of crisis. The House passed the 
Heroes Act more than 41⁄2 months ago. 
Normally what would happen is when 
a bill goes to the Senate, they would 
pass a bill of their own unless they be-
lieved: Ladies and gentlemen of Amer-
ica, you are on your own. And States, 
as Senator MCCONNELL said, you can go 
bankrupt. 
The minority leader of this House 
said: Let’s wait and see what happens. 
And we waited and we waited and we 
waited, and 120,000 additional Ameri-
cans have died since May 15. 
How long are we going to wait? 
The House did its job in May for the 
American people, yet the Republican 
Senate and President Trump have still 
not done theirs. 
They talk about compromise on that 
side of the aisle and working together. 
So what did the Republican leader of 
the Senate do? There was a trillion-dol-
lar offer on the table, so he came back 
with a compromise and cut it in half to 
$500 billion. And the only reason that 
bill got a majority of Republicans in 
the United States Senate—it didn’t get 
a majority of the United States Senate; 
it did, because there are enough Repub-
licans—is because they thought it 
wouldn’t go anywhere, it was a mes-
sage bill. That is the only reason it 
passed with 51. It didn’t pass, of course, 
because it needed 60. 
Now, let me tell you what John 
Boehner did and what Paul Ryan did 
when the Freedom Caucus wouldn’t 
give them the votes, Mr. Speaker, for 
the Republicans to pass legislation 
that they knew was needed, the debt 
limit, fiscal bills. They knew they were 
needed. So what did John Boehner do? 
He walked across the aisle, talked to 
the Speaker, talked to me, and said, 
‘‘We need some votes,’’ and we made a 
deal. 
The ranking member of the Appro-
priations Committee is one of those 
people who wants the House to work. I 
am a friend of hers and I respect her, 
because she is a Member that I have ex-
perienced who wants to make it work. 
But Senator MCCONNELL doesn’t walk 
across the aisle and say, Let’s make a 
compromise. 
So don’t preach at us, Mr. Speaker. 
Don’t preach at us about reaching 
across the aisle. We have seen tax bills 
that slam bam, there it goes, and so 
you come up with a bill. 
Negotiations are ongoing right now. 
And I want to congratulate the Speak-
er of the House. She has been in Wash-
ington more than any of the rest of us 
in the last 6 months—I know that, be-
cause I talk to her on a regular basis— 
trying to get this to work, trying to 
make a deal. 
Mr. Speaker, I applaud Secretary 
Mnuchin. There are some others who 
don’t make deals, and who have a his-
tory of not making deals and have a 
history of undermining deals that Paul 
Ryan wanted to make or that John 
Boehner wanted to make. Not Demo-
crats. 
But negotiations are continuing, and 
I hope we will reach a bipartisan agree-
ment. 
Frankly, if we had reached a bipar-
tisan agreement yesterday, we would 
not have this bill on the floor. If we 
had reached it the day before or the 
day before, we wouldn’t have this bill 
on the floor, because we know we want 
a bill signed. 
But we also know we want to let the 
American people know where we stand, 
not for just one bill that helps this 
group or that group or the other group, 
but all Americans who are suffering 
and are at risk. So we believe that this 
bill is a reasonable compromise. 
That is why today we will pass a bill 
that achieves the goals of the Heroes 
Act and represents a reasonable com-
promise. 
Some people, Mr. Speaker, are saying 
to themselves, This isn’t reasonable. 
Remember, McConnell goes from $1 
trillion down to half a trillion, which 
clearly did not cover the needs. Every 
economist tells us that. 
Notwithstanding the passage of this 
bill, House Democrats will continue to 
negotiate to reach the kind of bipar-
tisan agreement that we believe is nec-
essary to help Americans get through 
this crisis. The airlines need the money 
now, and we ought to be that close. 
But our position is clear. The Federal 
Government cannot shirk its respon-
sibilities to the people it serves, not 
just some of the people. 
We have in this bill the help for small 
businesses that people on that side of 
the aisle have been talking about. We 
are talking about it. They need it. 
It includes support for State, local, 
Tribal, and territorial governments. 
I have a letter here—and letters can 
be sent from the National Governors

Association only if they are unani-
mous—which says: ‘‘Every major econ-
omist, regardless of party or ideolog-
ical bent, came to the same conclusion 
after the 2007–2009 financial crisis: The 
lack of support for State and local gov-
ernments slowed the Nation’s economic 
growth for more than a decade. As we 
begin to recover and rebuild from the 
COVID–19 
crisis’’—unanimously, 
Re-
publican and Democratic Governors— 
‘‘we cannot afford to repeat the mis-
takes of the past,’’ i.e., not giving aid 
to State and local governments. 
That is what the Governors are say-
ing, all of them, Republican and Demo-
crat. 
My Governor is a Republican. His 
name is Hogan. His father served here 
in the House of Representatives. He is 
one of those who came up, with Mr. 
Cuomo, with the amount of money that 
was needed by State and local govern-
ments. 
Why do we aid State and local gov-
ernments? Because they hire police. We 
hear about defunding police. They are 
hemorrhaging revenues and they can-
not support the personnel they have, 
the police, fire, emergency medical re-
sponse 
teams, 
sanitation 
workers, 
nurses at public hospitals. All of these 
State and local governments are crit-
ical if we are going to solve the eco-
nomic problem and the COVID–19 prob-
lem. 
While the Heroes Act provided the 
level of fiscal support unanimously rec-
ommended by the National Governors 
Association—I want to repeat that. 
This is not a Democratic idea. Unani-
mously, the Governors of our States, 
red and blue States, said we need this 
money—this bill recognizes the reality 
that—faced with a Senate Republican 
leader who suggested that the States 
go bankrupt—that level might not be 
possible. 
So we reduced that sum in half, cut 
out $1 trillion of the proposal we 
thought had merit; actually, $1.2 tril-
lion. 
So we offer a compromise: 1 year of 
funding, cutting in half that which was 
in the Heroes Act, yet still sufficient to 
get us into next year. 
This legislation renews the expanded 
emergency unemployment insurance 
benefits that millions of people are re-
lying on. 
And by the way, it goes to them, but 
what do they do with it, Mr. Speaker? 
They spend it in the economy at those 
small businesses that Republicans are 
worried about, that all of us are wor-
ried about. 
When we give a family the suste-
nance that they need to support them-
selves and the family, they go spend it 
where? Small businesses and large 
businesses. 
We give that $600 a week through the 
end of January 2021, which will help 
small businesses and the general econ-
omy. 
It will provide another round of di-
rect payments to Americans of $1,200 
for each individual adult and $500 to el-
igible dependents to help families 
make ends meet. 
b 1830 
I think all of you have voted—it 
might have been a voice vote on the 
CARES Act, but everybody voted for it. 
And we are making sure college stu-
dents aren’t left out. 
Our bill offers a second round of the 
Paycheck Protection Program to help 
small businesses remain viable through 
the pandemic and includes additional 
support for workers in the airline, res-
taurant, and live-entertainment indus-
tries. It covers a whole lot of folks who 
need help. 
For 41⁄2 months after we passed the 
bill, the Senate has not sent us a single 
piece of legislation, not a single piece 
because Senator MCCONNELL will not 
compromise so he can get votes from 
the Democrats, which he needs to pass 
a bill, just as John Boehner and Paul 
Ryan crossed the aisle because they 
needed the votes for bills they thought 
were critically important for our coun-
try. 
To help reopen the economy safely, 
the bill also includes $75 billion for 
testing, contact tracing, and other pub-
lic health initiatives. 
And it provides a lifeline to the Post-
al Service. Now, I know that may be 
objectionable to some people because 
they may want to see the mail delayed, 
for whatever reasons. 
I want to thank Chairwoman LOWEY 
of the Appropriations Committee and 
all the other chairs and members of all 
of our committees who worked hard on 
this legislation. It includes input and 
contributions from many Members, in-
cluding many of our outstanding fresh-
men. 
This bill represents a substantial re-
duction, a 35 percent reduction. I tell 
my friends who served on the Appro-
priations Committee with me, if I was 
in charge and we wanted to make a 
deal and I said, ‘‘Well, I will come down 
35 percent,’’ they would have taken it 
like that. 
It is approximately the level of fund-
ing—somebody mentioned $2.2 trillion. 
The CARES Act was $2.2 trillion, and 
all of you voted for it. It was a voice 
vote, unanimous. I don’t know specifi-
cally whether you were here or wheth-
er you would say, ‘‘No, no. Silently, I 
voted no.’’ Nobody voted against it, 
$2.2 trillion. 
It is extraordinary the amount of 
money we are spending, Mr. Speaker. 
But then again, no one in this body, of 
whatever age, has experienced the cri-
sis that America has found itself in 
over the last 8 months—no one. 
Every economist said it required that 
kind of response, and that is why we 
voted for four bills in a bipartisan way. 
But then the leadership on the other 
side of the aisle, Mr. Speaker, said: 
Let’s wait and see what happens. 
And, as I said: 120,000 people have 
died. That is what happened. 
We passed an emergency supple-
mental appropriations bill, 415–2. We 
passed the Families First Act, 363–40. 
We passed the CARES Act by voice 
vote. Nobody voted against it, at least 
audibly. And the Paycheck Protection 
Program and Healthcare Enhancement 
Act was passed by the House on April 
23 by a vote of 383–5. 
What has changed? The politics have 
changed. 
The needs, Mr. Speaker, have not 
changed. All four of those bills passed 
the Senate and were signed into law. 
Some passed by unanimous consent by 
the United States Senate. 
I urge President Trump and Senate 
Republicans to work with us to reach 
bipartisan agreement without further 
delay. 
Yes, we have differences. But we have 
great needs, and I agree with those on 
the other side of the aisle and on this 
side of the aisle who said we must meet 
those needs if we are going to keep our 
economy going, keep our families in-
tact, and make sure that we have jobs 
for the future. 
Millions of American families, work-
ers, and small business owners are 
looking to Congress for help. 
Let us, Mr. Speaker, come together, 
as we have four times came together 
overwhelmingly and said—not this is a 
lot of money. It is a lot of money. I am 
boggled by the figures that we are deal-
ing with. But I am also boggled by the 
challenge that we confront. 
This bill represents a significant 
compromise, while addressing the pri-
orities we share. 
Mr. Speaker, I hope we can show the 
American people that we can come to-
gether to govern responsibly in this 
crisis and provide much-needed relief 
to the people we serve. 
People pick out individual items in 
this bill and, unfortunately, deeply 
mischaracterize some of them. Fake 
facts are being debated on this floor, 
Mr. Speaker. I don’t have the time to 
go into all those fake facts. 
One of them, though, was that we are 
defunding the police. There was $600 
million in the COPS program in the 
Heroes bill. Then, subsequently, we 
passed an appropriations bill at $343 
million. 
By the way, the Senate hasn’t passed 
a single bill to fund anything—any-
thing—Mr. Speaker. 
What did the President do? The 
President 
zero-funded—if 
you 
will 
check your budget—zero-funded the 
COPS program. Zero-funded it. Check 
it out. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote for this bill, and I guarantee you 
that we are going to continue tomor-
row and tomorrow and tomorrow to try 
to get an agreement that we can pass 
in the House and the Senate, and that 
the President will sign, because we un-
derstand the American people are in 
need. That is what this bill does, re-
sponds to them. 
If the Senate doesn’t like it, have 
them pass a bill. Let us go to con-
ference. Let’s get it done. We will be 
here to do it every day.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5429 
October 1, 2020 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. GONZALEZ). 
Mr. GONZALEZ of Ohio. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise in opposition to the legisla-
tion before us today. 
The gentleman was referencing the 
budget. We are still waiting for his 
budget. We will take it whenever he is 
ready. 
Let’s be clear about what we are 
doing today. We are going to be voting 
on a piece of legislation that was not 
negotiated, will be dead on arrival in 
the Senate, and will do nothing for the 
millions of Americans who are relying 
on this body to find a solution. 
This bill before us today is about 
wanting the politics of the issue more 
than results. This is a bill that rejects 
$1.7 trillion in bipartisan COVID aid 
that will help families navigate some 
of the most difficult moments of their 
lives in favor of zero dollars that will 
help absolutely no one except for a 
handful of politicians who want the 
message more than the result. What a 
disgrace. 
The sad truth is my colleagues know 
exactly what they are doing. How, in 
good faith, could they say that this 
legislation, which takes steps to fed-
eralize U.S. elections, that provides a 
tax break for millionaires and billion-
aires in blue States—that is right—and 
directs ICE to release individuals in 
custody, is an attempt to help their 
constituents, knowing full well that 
these provisions will not be signed into 
law? 
Just this morning, the Speaker of the 
House said that we are not only having 
a dollars debate, but we are having a 
values debate. Well, I have heard from 
the people of Ohio’s 16th District and 
many around the country about what 
they value since this pandemic broke 
out. 
My constituents value a Congress 
that puts the people over the politics. 
They value a Congress that could care 
less about which party wins or loses an 
election, so long as, in their greatest 
moment of need, their government is 
there for them. 
The people are sick and tired of 
watching this town fight like cats and 
dogs over who ‘‘wins’’ the day. They 
want to win, and they win when we do 
our job. That is not what is happening 
today, and the American people are 
rightly disgusted. 
Just 2 weeks ago, my colleagues from 
the Problem Solvers Caucus, with 25 
members from each side of the aisle, 
put forward a proposal that showed 
that we can and should work together 
on a proposal that keeps our small 
businesses open, protects our children 
and schools, helps those who are still 
unemployed, and offers additional aid 
to States and localities. 
I heard from people across all sides of 
the political spectrum that this caucus 
and our package gave them hope that 
Congress could actually do something 
for a change. Yet, here we are. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
the gentleman from Ohio an additional 
1 minute. 
Mr. GONZALEZ of Ohio. Yet, here we 
are, ready to let down the people we 
serve yet again. 
Despite all of this, there remains a 
path forward to a solution, but it will 
take leadership on both sides of the 
aisle to cast aside their partisan hats 
and negotiate in good faith. 
Let me be clear in saying that leader-
ship doesn’t need to just come from our 
elected party leaders. Each Member of 
the House has a say in how they choose 
to vote today. A ‘‘yes’’ vote is for the 
status quo, political messaging, and 
nothing for the American people. A 
‘‘no’’ vote is a recognition that there is 
more work to be done and that there is 
still an opportunity for us to act in the 
best interest of our constituents. 
We have to deliver. It is time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I am very 
pleased to yield 5 minutes to the dis-
tinguished gentleman from New Jersey 
(Mr. PALLONE), the chairman of the 
Committee on Energy and Commerce, 
a member of my class in the Congress. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I want 
to thank the chairwoman and com-
mend her for putting together a bill 
which, while it reduces the amount of 
money from the original Heroes Act, in 
my opinion, because of the lessons we 
have learned in the last few weeks, im-
proves the Heroes Act because of what 
we have learned. 
I know that is not an easy task, 
Madam Chair. I know that is not an 
easy task, what you have accomplished 
here today, so I want to congratulate 
you. 
I also want to say, in response to my 
colleague on the other side from Ohio, 
this is a serious attempt to put some-
thing forward that we believe that the 
Republicans can support. Now, maybe 
they are not going to do it today. 
But I just want to say that our 
Speaker—when I say ‘‘our,’’ I mean the 
Speaker, because she is, you know, the 
Speaker for the entire House and the 
entire country—has worked so hard 
over the last few weeks and months to 
try to come together with the Repub-
licans. She just met yesterday, and 
maybe even today again, with Mr. 
Mnuchin from the White House. 
To suggest in any way that this is 
anything other than a serious attempt 
by Democrats to put forward some-
thing that we think the Republicans 
can ultimately adopt, or come close to 
what they would ultimately support, I 
think is unfortunate because that is 
what we are doing here today. 
I want to go back to what Speaker 
PELOSI said earlier when she said that 
what we are really trying to do is crush 
the virus, and I want to talk about that 
because much of that language that 
would accomplish that comes from the 
Energy and Commerce Committee that 
I chair. 
This is the United States of America. 
I know we are elected from individual 
districts, but we come here to rep-
resent the whole country. The fact of 
the matter is the only way that we can 
crush this virus and end this pandemic 
is if we work together on a national 
level to accomplish it. 
So what we say in the Heroes Act, 
both the old one and the new one, is 
that we need a national plan, and we 
need a way to bring forth that national 
plan. 
What is happening now is every State 
competes. I get so mad when I watch 
the TV and they say Ohio is doing bet-
ter this week, or New Jersey is doing 
worse this week. That is not what this 
is about. 
This has to be a united effort. It is 
the United States of America. And that 
is not what we have right now because 
each State is competing, competing for 
testing, competing for medical sup-
plies, deciding on an individual basis. 
The hospitals even compete between 
themselves, and that is not the way it 
should be. 
What we say in the Heroes Act, and it 
is carried forth again in this legislation 
today, is a national plan, someone in 
charge at a national level—I will call it 
a supply czar for the supply chain— 
that sets parameters, if you will, for 
how to crush the virus, guidelines for 
the schools, for how you should wear a 
mask, not necessarily all the details, 
but essentially a national plan, and 
then delivers the testing supplies, the 
medical supplies, and, ultimately, the 
vaccine. 
One of the things that is such an im-
provement in this bill is not only do we 
continue the $75 billion for testing and 
contact tracing and quarantine, but we 
also provide another $25 or $26 billion 
for 
distribution, 
development, 
and 
awareness of the vaccine when it is 
eventually developed because, again, 
this has to be done equitably. It has to 
be done nationally. That is what I real-
ly want to stress today. 
I don’t necessarily need to use all my 
time, Madam Speaker, because I want 
to stress that we have to do this to-
gether, and that is what this bill puts 
forward. 
Let me just say, in addition to that, 
because I do want to mention a few 
other things, we have $2 billion in new 
funding to get essential workers their 
protective personal and work equip-
ment that they need. 
We also have new provisions to ad-
dress insurance companies declining to 
cover COVID testing. In the CARES 
Act, we said that everyone should be 
able to get a test for free, no out-of- 
pocket expense. 
The bill extends that to the treat-
ment, to the drugs and the vaccine. 
But the insurance companies, in many 
cases, are not doing that. So we want 
to make it quite clear that they have 
to cover it free, and there is no out-of- 
pocket expense. And that would be true 
for the treatment; that would be true 
for the vaccination as well. 
Again, we are one country. I can’t 
stress that enough. 
Now, the other thing that is a major 
problem, and I want to mention it

briefly, is the ability to connect to the 
internet because the bottom line right 
now is if you are not in school and you 
are learning remotely, or you are 
working remotely, you need to have an 
internet connection. 
b 1845 
There is a lot of inequality with that 
around the country, too, so the legisla-
tion addresses the digital divide by pro-
viding $12 billion to schools and librar-
ies for distance learning, for remote 
learning. 
We also continue to help low-income 
households afford internet service by 
saying they have to have a discount for 
service by $50 a month. We have to con-
tinue and enhance the lifeline program, 
which helps people of low income pay 
the bills for those internet connec-
tions. 
The last thing I want to mention also 
is that, finally, we also prevent the 
shutoffs for any kind of utilities, water 
service, and other shutoffs, because 
that is important as well. 
So I thank the chair again for the 
time. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. MCCARTHY), who is the Re-
publican leader. 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
I just listened to the last speaker, 
Mr. Speaker. He said that he had a bill 
that he thought and hoped maybe the 
Republicans could support, and he used 
the word, ‘‘united.’’ 
Do you know the easiest way to know 
if the Republicans support it? Ask 
them. Let them in the room. Actually 
work with them. That is probably a 
quicker way. The united part is a little 
difficult if you want to unite people 
and you leave them out. 
So let me recap. Having been the 
leader on this side of the aisle and hav-
ing worked on numerous COVID relief 
bills, let’s recap what we have gone 
through each and every time we try to 
bring America relief. 
Mr. Speaker, do you know what? 
Let’s not take my word for it. Let’s 
just read the headlines. I think that 
will work best. 
March 22, The New York Times: 
‘‘Emergency Economic Rescue Plan in 
Limbo as Democrats Block Action.’’ 
Yes, that was The New York Times. 
That was March 22. 
So let’s go to April 9. Let’s go to the 
NPR: ‘‘Senate Democrats Block GOP 
Effort to Boost Small Business Aid.’’ 
A week later, we watched the Speak-
er of this House appear on ‘‘The Late 
Show,’’ bragging about blocking the re-
lief while eating high-end ice cream. 
For reference, there were 22 million un-
employed Americans at that time. 
August 3, CBS News said: Democrats 
Reject White House Offer for Short- 
Term Extension of Unemployment Ben-
efits.’’ 
Let’s go to September 10, Politico: 
‘‘Senate Democrats Block Republican 
COVID Relief Proposal.’’ 
That is weird. All those headlines, 
and I never heard ‘‘united.’’ I did hear 
‘‘blocking.’’ I did see the Speaker. 
Now, Mr. Speaker, let me tell you a 
little bit of my personal experience. 
When we wanted to do the CARES Act, 
the Senate worked with Republicans 
and Democrats by committee. They 
put the bill together. You listened to 
Leader SCHUMER, that night, say: Yes, 
we are ready to go. The bill is prepared. 
I took the red-eye and flew back. The 
Speaker did, too. We went into the 
meeting together. And do you know 
what, Mr. Speaker? Just read one of 
these headlines. The Speaker was able 
to stop it for another whole week. 
How many people were laid off that 
week? 
But do you know what? There was 
change in the bill. The John F. Ken-
nedy Center for the Performing Arts 
got a little more, but that was the only 
thing, and then we were able to pass it. 
In there, we were able to produce the 
PPP for small businesses. It allows you 
to pay your rent and your utilities. But 
you took that money and you paid 
your employees. 
Why were you paying your employ-
ees? Because government shut down 
your business. 
Was it successful? Whoa, was it suc-
cessful. 
Did it go to the owner? No. It went to 
the people. It went to the workers. 
Fifty million workers were saved. It 
was so powerful and so successful that 
the money was running out. 
So do you know what, Mr. Speaker? 
The Treasury Secretary sent a letter to 
us and said: You don’t need to change 
anything. Just add a little more money 
because it is so successful at saving so 
many jobs. 
Well, we got our answer. One person 
stopped it all, and she did it on ‘‘The 
Late Show’’ for all of America to see. 
Mr. Speaker, do you remember her 
smiling as she opened that refrigerator 
and denied those 22 million people, that 
they were going to join those unem-
ployment lines, and she was going to 
smile about it because she had her ice 
cream. 
Do you know what happened, Mr. 
Speaker? I listened to the Speaker’s 
words. She said: Do you know what? 
We are going to get this done. We are 
not going to leave. 
Because she has all the power of 
whether we stay in here and do our job 
or not. It doesn’t matter if one-third on 
the other side stays home and votes by 
proxy and still gets their paycheck. 
She had everybody leave. 
But then I had hope. I had hope for 
those who were unemployed. I had hope 
for those who wanted to go back to 
school and needed the money, because 
the Speaker called an emergency meet-
ing and forced us to come back here. So 
I thought maybe she changed, maybe 
actually what she said she meant this 
time. So she was going to force Con-
gress back, and she did. 
Do you know what? One-third on 
other side didn’t show because they 
didn’t think it was an emergency. 
Was it about COVID relief? Was it 
about the American people who were 
hurting? No. No. No. No. No. No. It was 
about the post office. It was political. 
So we should have everybody come 
back. 
When you are in the minority, there 
are only certain rules you have and 
certain options to put something on 
the floor. So do you know what the Re-
publicans chose to do that day, Mr. 
Speaker, when the Democrats chose to 
talk about the post office? We put 
COVID relief on the floor. So there was 
an option. There was an opportunity. 
The power of the Speaker rose again. 
She put her thumb down and everybody 
else on the other side followed. 
So do you know what, Mr. Speaker? 
The American public lost that day, too. 
They lost one more time. 
The facts speak for themselves. The 
common denominator in holding up re-
lief for the American people is very 
simple: Speaker PELOSI. She spent the 
last several months stonewalling nego-
tiations instead of working to solve 
problems. 
You know why we are here today, Mr. 
Speaker? It is because Republicans put 
a discharge petition on the floor. 
I wonder why we got out early last 
Friday. Hmm. The discharge petition 
must have become ripe where people 
could sign it. 
When her Members revolted, she re-
sponded by recycling an old, unrelated 
liberal wish list from her first bill. 
Now, at a time when 837 more Ameri-
cans are filing for unemployment and 
small businesses are closing perma-
nently, she is wasting Americans’ time 
on yet another multitrillion-dollar spe-
cial interest bailout that rewards K 
Street and not Main Street. 
Today’s so-called compromise isn’t 
realistic or responsible. It is the Pelosi 
pipe dream 2.0, and it is filled with the 
same radical, reckless, and ridiculous 
ideas as the first bill. 
Instead of prioritizing new money for 
small businesses through the Paycheck 
Protection Program, it provides a mas-
sive tax break to the millionaires and 
billionaires who are totally unrelated 
to the coronavirus. 
Now, let me give you an example. 
Let’s take one person in America who 
is going to benefit from this. Mr. 
Speaker, you actually ought to rename 
this bill the Mike Bloomberg bill. 
Mike Bloomberg is reported to have 
made $3.5 billion last year. He lives in 
New York. So if you take the State and 
local taxes and you combine it, it is 
12.5 percent. So that would mean, if 
this bill passes, you just gave him $160 
million in his pocket. 
That is an interesting number, 160 
million. I wonder if $160 million is how 
much he would save. How would that 
affect him? 
Well, I just read a couple reports, Mr. 
Speaker. 
Do 
you 
know 
Michael 
Bloomberg just put $100 million into 
Florida to win it for Joe Biden? 
In another interesting report, he had 
given the Democrats $60 million to help

them try to keep the majority this 
year. 
What is even more interesting, Mi-
chael Bloomberg ran for President, and 
when he was on stage, do you know 
what he said? He said he bought the 
Democrats the majority. He said he 
spent $100 million. He bragged about 
the individuals that he was able to 
spend that money on. 
Hmm. Some people would wonder if 
that was money well spent. Some peo-
ple might wonder if they read that bill: 
Hmm, $160 million. 
What does that mean to the person 
who is unemployed? I don’t think Mike 
Bloomberg needs that. 
I know a lot of small businesses and 
I know a lot of unemployed workers 
who need the money, but you chose 
somebody else to respond to. You chose 
somebody else to reward. Shame on 
you. 
Instead of guaranteeing common-
sense protections against frivolous law-
suits for schools, for small businesses, 
for childcare, and for churches, it gives 
amnesty, work visas, and taxpayer- 
funded stimulus checks to illegal im-
migrants. 
Lots of times when you read a bill, 
you see what you prioritize. 
Instead of boosting jobs, it bails out 
the cannabis industry. 
Mr. Speaker, have you read your own 
bill? In fact, it mentions cannabis more 
than it mentions jobs. Did you read the 
bill? It mentions cannabis more than it 
mentions jobs. 
I would challenge anybody in this 
body to name me one time in their dis-
trict in one meeting that it mentioned 
cannabis more than it mentioned jobs 
with what you are going through right 
now. Our districts may be different, 
but I don’t believe anybody has that. 
Instead of reopening the economy, it 
releases criminals to our communities. 
Democrats think the economy should 
be locked down, but they don’t think 
serial killers should be locked up. 
But the Speaker’s latest bill does 
have a noteworthy difference from the 
original. 
At a time when the leftwing mobs are 
creating chaos in our cities, the bill 
unequivocally 
embraces 
the 
left’s 
defund the police agenda. In fact, it re-
moves $600 million of the emergency 
funding for State and local enforce-
ment and community-oriented policing 
that was in the first bill. That is where 
they cut. Democrats actually believe 
the top priority of Congress is fewer 
cops and more criminals. 
Again, sometimes when you read the 
bills, it lets people know their prior-
ities. 
I listened to the Speaker before. She 
always told me that bills show your 
values. I heard the Speaker recently 
say that the Democrats’ values are dif-
ferent from Republicans’. 
These are your values. Yes, they are. 
Yes, they are. 
Another striking difference is the 
tens of billions of dollars for public 
education to combat misinformation 
about the coronavirus vaccine. 
Mr. Speaker, I was happy to hear my 
colleague on the other side speak a lit-
tle earlier about the vaccine. I was ex-
cited because the Democrat nominee 
for President and the person he choose 
to be his running mate don’t think that 
people should take the vaccine even 
though it is going to be safe and effec-
tive and save people’s lives. 
It is interesting. The individual who 
is running for President on the Demo-
crat side said that he is the Democratic 
Party. 
Joe Biden, KAMALA
HARRIS, and 
Speaker PELOSI actively spread in pub-
lic, over the last few weeks, misin-
formation about an ability to save 
lives. American families, workers, and 
small businesses will continue to pay 
the price for Democrats’ refusal to 
take this crisis seriously. 
It doesn’t have to be this way. That 
is the worst part of all of this. It 
doesn’t have to be this way. As the past 
several months have proven, targeted 
and timely relief related to COVID 
hardship actually works. 
Fifty million people are without a 
paycheck because of PPP. 
I can’t tell you how many people got 
laid off for every time Speaker PELOSI 
has delayed our bills. 
I can’t tell you how many households 
and how many businesses have gone 
bankrupt because she didn’t keep her 
word and say that we would stay here 
and do it. 
I can’t tell you how many more peo-
ple wonder if their kids can go to col-
lege because NANCY PELOSI, our Speak-
er, called us back for an emergency, 
but it wasn’t about COVID. 
b 1900 
Instead of using American’s suffering 
as leverage to pass a socialist agenda, 
Congress should be working on getting 
the American people back to work safe-
ly and back to school safely. 
Republicans have spent months using 
every tool available to the minority to 
build on the CARES Act and get sup-
port to Main Street. The American 
public actually ought to see how people 
vote here, because just yesterday we 
put on the floor a vote for PPP. Every 
single Democrat voted ‘‘no.’’ Every sin-
gle one. It is something they have al-
ready supported before. Money is al-
ready sitting there—more than $130 bil-
lion. 
This month, our efforts culminated 
in a discharge petition to reopen the 
Paycheck Protection Program, which I 
have said, has already saved 51 million 
jobs. 
Mr. Speaker, to the American public, 
what does a discharge petition mean? 
You see, the Speaker, whoever he or 
she is, has all the power. They can de-
termine what comes to the floor. But a 
discharge petition gives the power to 
the Members. All it takes is 218 Mem-
bers to sign it. The public knows what 
it is. All it would do is take the money 
that is there for the Paycheck Protec-
tion Program and make sure the bill 
comes to the floor and could be voted 
on. It will be really telling to know 
how many people back home say they 
support it and how many times they 
come here and are fearful, fearful if 
there are threats if they sign the dis-
charge petition. 
The petition is being led by Ranking 
Member STEVE CHABOT, and JAIME HER-
RERA BEUTLER. I thank both of them. 
Because you know what they have 
done? They put the American people 
first. 
STEVE CHABOT, ranking member of 
Committee on Small Business, when we 
were crafting the CARES bill, where 
the PPP was created—yes, it was him 
who worked so hard to make sure the 
small businesses, those who are em-
ployed by them, got resources. He did 
an amazing job. 
JAIME HERRERA BEUTLER is probably 
one of the most bipartisan Members in 
this body. They didn’t do it for polit-
ical gain. They did it because they lis-
tened to their district. 
As of Friday, this commonsense solu-
tion officially became open for signa-
tures—just 218 to earn a vote on the 
floor. I think it deserves a vote. I think 
if you took it to the public, they would 
pick that a lot sooner than they would 
pick what this bill is doing. 
Mr. Speaker, every Member of this 
body must make a choice tonight. 
Members who endorse the Speaker’s 
reckless actions can vote ‘‘yes’’ on this 
recycled liberal wish list. Then they 
can go home and explain to small busi-
nesses in their district why they 
prioritized politics over people. 
They could stand up and say, No, we 
worked hard for cannabis, a lot harder 
than we worked for jobs. We made sure 
the police got cut, and we made sure 
Mike Bloomberg got paid back. Now 
that $160 million that he is spending in 
the campaign today, he will get it all 
back because the taxpayers will pay 
him for it. That is exactly what this 
bill does. It could be the Michael 
Bloomberg, 
Cannabis, 
Cut-the-Cops 
bill. That is power. That is real power. 
You can make sure Michael Bloomberg 
does not lose $1 of the $160 million he 
has invested to make sure that Joe 
Biden and the Democrats stay in 
power. 
If you are that proud of this bill, why 
don’t you name what it does? It makes 
sure all Americans know that cannabis 
is your number one priority, not jobs. 
It makes sure that you take care of 
those who take care of you in a cam-
paign—Michael Bloomberg. 
And it makes sure everybody knows 
you do not care about the safety of our 
streets, that you are going to cut the 
police by $600 million. 
That is one heck of a campaign. That 
is amazing. What is interesting, so 
many times the leaders, people have 
said here, the Speaker of the House, 
she is the Speaker for all of America. 
And she always tells us, This will tell 
you what your values are. And I re-
member what she recently said, That 
our values are different. 
I want to agree with the Speaker. 
Our values are different. On this side of

the aisle, we believe in a commitment 
to America. We believe that we will de-
feat this virus because we will create a 
safe and secure vaccine. The other dif-
ference in our values? Our commitment 
to America. You can read it. You can 
go 
to 
CommitmentToAmerica.com. 
And we actually reject defunding the 
police. We say we will spend $1.75 bil-
lion more on the police, not cut by $600 
million. You know what we will do 
with the money? Community policing, 
more training, and 500,000 body cam-
eras. 
We also have a plan. We can tell you 
how many jobs we are going to create. 
We are going to create 10 million new 
jobs. I don’t know how big you will ex-
pand the marijuana business, but in 
here, it mentions that more than jobs. 
We are going to end the dependency 
on China. We don’t just say it, we actu-
ally do it. We just came out with a 
task force that not only shows you the 
problem, it shows you the solution. 
Mr. Speaker, you know what we did 
different than what you did with this 
bill? We didn’t produce something and 
say, Well, we think the Democrats 
might like some of this. We actually 
invited you to join us. 
Mr. Speaker, a year ago, I went to 
the Speaker, and I asked her if we 
could create a bipartisan committee 
dealing with China. China is rep-
resenting its 71st anniversary. There is 
no more freedom in China today than 
there was 31 years ago in Tiananmen 
Square. 
It took me 8 months of negotiation 
with the Democrat leadership until 
they finally said, yes. We actually 
picked the people who were going to be 
on it. And right before we went to 
name it, they decided no. They didn’t 
want to be a part of it. This was before 
COVID. I just don’t understand it. I 
just don’t understand why our values 
are that different. 
Members who want to bring an end to 
the Speaker’s excuses, who believe this 
is a moment to work for Main Street 
not K Street should vote ‘‘no’’ and sign 
the Herrera Beutler-Chabot discharge 
petition. By adding your name, you 
will be advancing a fair process to-
wards making bipartisan law for Amer-
ican families. That is what our neigh-
borhoods need. They need us to legis-
late for them, not posture for Novem-
ber. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all my Democrat 
colleagues to join us. Make a commit-
ment to America, not to Michael 
Bloomberg, not to cannabis. Focus on 
who actually voted for you to get here. 
Do not be so intimidated because some-
body supplied so many millions of dol-
lars to try to persuade people to vote a 
certain way. Listen to those who have 
been laid off. 
I know what it is like to have a 
dream to open a small business. I know 
what the hardships are like, but I have 
not witnessed personally the hardship 
of what the virus has done when they 
have been shut down. The least I would 
expect is this body would act, would 
put people before politics. But, unfor-
tunately, yes, the values of one side are 
different than ours. 
Every chance we have we have put 
forth relief for the American public, 
and the only opportunity we have now 
is the discharge petition, because no 
one definitely can vote for this. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. BISHOP), the distinguished 
chair of the Subcommittee on Agri-
culture, Rural Development, Food and 
Drug 
Administration, 
and 
Related 
Agencies. 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, 
I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this 
updated Heroes Act. This bill is about 
people and not about politics. 
As chairman of the Subcommittee on 
Agriculture, Rural Development, Food 
and Drug Administration, and Related 
Agencies, I will highlight the impor-
tant provisions of this bill from my 
section, which touches the lives of 
every American in some way. 
It provides a total of $15.4 billion to 
help Americans put food on the table, 
to keep their homes, protect agricul-
tural products from pests and diseases, 
deliver stress assistance to our farmers 
and 
producers, 
and 
evaluate 
coronavirus vaccine applications. 
We provide $10 billion to SNAP, an 
additional $400 million for WIC, for 
working families who have lost their 
jobs and are laid off due to the COVID– 
19 emergency. We included $450 million 
for TEFAP food banks, and $1.2 billion 
for nutrition assistance for the terri-
tories. All of these programs will in-
crease food security during this crisis. 
To keep our food supply safe and 
thriving during the COVID–19 pan-
demic, we provided $350 million for the 
Agricultural 
Quarantine 
Inspection 
Program. We included $2.5 million for 
the USDA Office of Inspector General 
to increase their monitoring and over-
sight activities. 
For our farmers and producers who 
are under increased pressure in an al-
ready difficult environment, we pro-
vided $20 million to activities and serv-
ices to provide stress assistance re-
sources. 
For our rural Americans, we included 
$10 million to address the increased 
workload for the Rural Development 
program employees; $2.6 billion for 
grants to our rural electric co-ops so 
the lights can stay on; and $309 million 
to the Rural Housing Service to assist 
rural tenants who have lost their jobs 
in this pandemic. 
Finally, so we can begin to see light 
at the end of this COVID–19 tunnel, we 
provided $1.5 million to the Food and 
Drug Administration to support their 
safety evaluations of the coronavirus 
vaccine applications going forward. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill. This is a good bill. It 
is long overdue. The American people 
need it and deserve it, and I urge my 
colleagues to pass it. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I urge a 
‘‘no’’ vote, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I urge a 
‘‘yes’’ vote, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a sen-
ior member of the Committees on the Judici-
ary and on Homeland Security, I rise in strong 
support of Senate amendments to H.R. 925— 
America’s Conservation Enhancement Act (an 
update of The Heroes Act), a much needed in-
stallment of the necessary assistance and re-
lief provided by Congress to address the ad-
verse health and economic impacts of the 
COVID–19 pandemic. 
To date, there are more than 7,213,419 
confirmed cases, over 206,402 dead, including 
748,967 cases and 15,711 deaths in my home 
state of Texas. 
I want to thank our frontline healthcare 
workers and essential workers for their sac-
rifice and commitment during this crisis. 
I have worked along side medical profes-
sionals and public health experts in my city of 
Houston to open 33 remote testing sites. 
This update of the HEROES Act provides 
an additional $2.2 trillion for protects lives, 
livelihoods and the life of our democracy. 
This update to the HEROES Act is needed 
in order to have the economic vitality to re-
open that allows a science-based path to safe-
ly reopen our country and helping ensure that 
every American can access free coronavirus 
treatment. 
In support this legislation also because it 
provides strong support for our heroes fighting 
the pandemic on the front lines with nearly $1 
trillion for state, local, territorial and tribal gov-
ernments who desperately need funds to pay 
the health care workers, police, fire, transpor-
tation, and EMS personnel, along with teach-
ers and other vital workers who keep us safe 
and are in danger of losing their jobs. 
The Heroes Act update provides for: small 
businesses, by improving the Paycheck Pro-
tection Program to serve the smallest busi-
nesses and struggling nonprofits, hard-hit 
businesses with second loans, and targeted 
assistance for the struggling restaurant indus-
try and independent live venue operators. 
The bill also provides additional assistance 
for airline industry workers, extending the 
highly successful Payroll Support Program to 
keep airline industry workers paid. 
There are more funds to bolster education 
and childcare, with $225 billion for education— 
including $182 billion for K–12 schools and 
nearly $39 billion for postsecondary edu-
cation—and $57 billion to support child care 
for families. 
Another reason to support this bill is that it 
puts money in the pockets of workers with a 
second round of direct payments to families of 
$1,200 for adults and $500 for each child, new 
payroll protection measures to keep 60 million 
workers connected with their jobs, and re-
stores the weekly $600 federal unemployment 
payments through January 2021. 
On top of that, by taking the necessary 
measures to slow the pandemic and ‘flatten 
the curve’ so as not to overwhelm the nation’s 
health care system, economic activity in the 
United States has experienced a severe shock 
to the system. 
There have been more than 36 million initial 
unemployment claims in the past month alone. 
In addition, on March 23, 2020, the Dow 
Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dipped to 
18,321.62, which is even lower than it was on 
Election Night 2016, and far below the 19,827 
mark where it stood on January 20, 2017.

In other words, Mr. Speaker, all the gains 
that were made to the stock market and her-
alded by this Administration as evidence of its 
genius have been wiped out, depleting the re-
tirement savings and 401(k) fund of millions of 
ordinary Americans. 
The situation is so dire that Federal Reserve 
Chair Jerome Powell, appointed by the current 
President, stressed the importance of Con-
gress providing further fiscal relief, stating this 
week: 
‘‘While the economic response has been 
both timely and appropriately large, it may not 
be the final chapter, given that the path ahead 
is both highly uncertain and subject to signifi-
cant downside risks. Additional fiscal support 
could be costly, but worth it if it helps avoid 
long-term economic damage and leaves us 
with a stronger recovery.’’ 
The U.S. economy lost over 20 million jobs 
in April with the unemployment rate spiking to 
14.7 percent, the worst since the Great De-
pression, but actual job losses were near 20 
percent according to some estimates. 
And in addition to the highly inequitable 
gender and racial impacts, this economic 
downturn reveals a strong class dimension to 
the unemployment wave, with 18.1 million of 
the 19.5 million jobs lost in the private sector 
last month classified as production and non-
supervisory workers as opposed to managers. 
So, we have simultaneously a public health 
emergency and an economic calamity, both of 
which are addressed in the legislation before 
us. 
But before we can get back on our feet eco-
nomically and restore the booming economy 
inherited by the current Administration, Ameri-
cans must be assured and confident that there 
is a plan and strategy to combat COVID–19; 
and the resources and commitment needed to 
implement the plan and execute the strategy. 
And that means testing, testing, and more 
testing, along with contact tracing. 
Mr. Speaker, the occasion demands that we 
rise, and I urge all Members to join me in vot-
ing to pass H.R. 925—America’s Conservation 
Enhancement Act (an update of The Heroes 
Act). 
Ms. DEGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in 
strong support of the Heroes Act. 
Our country has weathered almost seven 
months of unrelenting tragedy. 
200,000 Americans have died. Millions are 
out of work and millions more are struggling to 
get by. Families and businesses across the 
country need our help and they need it now. 
As lawmakers, we have a responsibility to 
ensure we’re doing everything in our power to 
respond to a crisis of this magnitude. The bill 
we have before us today is exactly the type of 
bold response that our country desperately 
needs. 
We know that we can’t fix our economic cri-
sis without first addressing our public health 
crisis. The Heroes Act relies on a science- 
based approach to safely reopening our coun-
try, which is essential to ensuring the long- 
term success of rebuilding our communities. 
Until we have a safe plan for vaccine devel-
opment and distribution, Americans will not 
feel comfortable returning to work, schools, 
restaurants, or businesses at pre-pandemic 
levels. 
And until we have a robust national testing 
and contact tracing system in place, we can-
not begin to fully stem this pandemic. 
The Heroes Act commits another $75 billion 
for testing, tracing and treatment. 
It also commits another $20 billion to pro-
cure vaccine testing and vaccine candidates to 
prevent the spread of COVID–19, including a 
bill I authored that requires the Department of 
Health and Human Services to create a plan 
to distribute and administer vaccines to stop 
the spread of COVID–19 once such vaccines 
are developed and authorized. 
We can’t just work to prevent the spread of 
the disease, though. We must also find cre-
ative ways to ensure health care is accessible 
for every American who might need it. 
No family should have to choose between 
putting food on the table or accessing COVID- 
19 treatment. It’s not just wrong, it’s dan-
gerous. 
I’m proud to say that our bill will require cov-
erage of items and services related to the 
treatment of COVID–19, ensuring all Ameri-
cans can seek treatment for COVID–19 with-
out concern for how they’re going to pay for it. 
It will also provide a 12 month ban on evic-
tions and foreclosures alongside $50 billion in 
emergency rental assistance and $21 billion in 
emergency homeowner assistance. On top of 
everything else they are going through, Ameri-
cans do not need to worry about being thrown 
out of their home. 
Additionally, the legislation includes my bill 
to make state and local governments eligible 
for paid leave payroll tax credits for workers 
affected by the coronavirus. Without these tax 
credits, the costs of providing paid leave could 
undermine successful local coronavirus re-
sponses at a time when budgets are already 
strained due to reduced tax revenues caused 
by the economic fallout of the pandemic. 
Tens of millions of families and small busi-
nesses are becoming increasingly desperate 
amid the ongoing pandemic. House Demo-
crats have been advocating for more money to 
be put directly into the pockets of these work-
ers and families for months. The Heroes Act 
would provide a second round of direct pay-
ments to families, new payroll protection 
measures, and extended unemployment pay-
ments. 
We cannot sit and wait for a solution—we 
must take bold legislative steps to protect our 
communities, and to prevent any more tragedy 
and loss. 
The answer is clear: we have before us a 
bill that will help struggling families. A bill that 
will reinvigorate our economy, and take con-
crete steps to limit the spread of the virus. 
This is the second time that we’ve had to 
vote to approve a version of the Heroes Act. 
The American people are depending on us. 
Let’s do what we were elected to do, and pass 
it on behalf of all of them. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong 
support of the updated Heroes Act (H.R. 925), 
a stimulus package that rises to the serious-
ness of the crisis that our Nation is facing. 
I am pleased that this legislation once again 
provides economic relief for American families 
by providing stimulus checks, restoring and 
expanding the weekly $600 federal unemploy-
ment payments through next January, improv-
ing unemployment benefits for contract and 
mixed income workers, bolstering housing as-
sistance 
through 
direct 
rent 
relief, 
and 
strengthening food access for families dis-
proportionately impacted by the pandemic 
through a 15 percent increase in SNAP bene-
fits. The updated Heroes Act also includes ro-
bust support for small businesses by improv-
ing the Paycheck Protection Program and pro-
viding the hardest-hit small businesses, non- 
profits, and entrepreneurs with second loans. 
I am incredibly proud that this package con-
tains two pieces of legislation that I cospon-
sored to provide additional targeted assistance 
for struggling restaurants and live venues—the 
Restaurants Act and the Save Our Stages Act 
New York City independent restaurants and 
live entertainment venues and theaters have 
been devastated by the economic impacts of 
the pandemic, and this bill will provide the im-
mediate relief they need to ensure they can 
survive as the lifeblood of our city and our 
neighborhoods. After leading the call for ro-
bust funding for our public transit agencies, I 
am pleased that this package contains sub-
stantial assistance for the MTA, which will 
allow it to continue operations into 2021. The 
economic relief in the updated Heroes Act is 
vital to New York City’s ability to rebuild and 
restore its economy. 
In addition to economic relief, the updated 
Heroes Act invests in the health and safety of 
the American people by providing an addi-
tional $75 billion for testing and tracing, an ad-
ditional $28 billion to procure a safe and effec-
tive vaccine and strengthening worker safety 
protections. The package also includes provi-
sions that will protect unemployed Americans 
losing their employer-provided health insur-
ance by ensuring they receive the maximum 
ACA subsidy on the healthcare exchanges. 
The updated Heroes Act provides additional 
support by creating a special enrollment pe-
riod in the ACA exchanges for unemployed 
Americans. 
After fighting for urgently needed funding for 
New York City’s schools, I am proud that this 
package includes $182 billion for K–12 
schools, $39 billion to higher education institu-
tions, and $57 billion to support childcare for 
families. The package also includes des-
perately needed funding for museums and li-
braries and targeted funding to support re-
search universities that are leading clinical re-
search into improving COVID–19 manage-
ment. 
Finally, I am proud that this legislation in-
vests in safeguarding our democracy by fully 
funding the Postal Service, providing states 
with new resources to safeguard the safety 
and security of our elections, and ensuring the 
integrity of the 2020 Census. 
It’s been more than four months since 
House Democrats gathered on this floor to 
pass a $3.4 trillion COVID–19 relief package 
that included urgent funding to protect the 
lives and livelihoods of American families. Un-
fortunately, MITCH MCCONNELL and Senate 
Republicans failed to pass that bill and chose 
instead to ‘‘wait and see’’ how much worse the 
pandemic could get. Well they waited and they 
saw, and they still did nothing, even as the 
pandemic spread and millions of Americans 
remained out of work. Since House Democrats 
passed the stimulus package in May, the U.S. 
COVID–19 death toll has more than doubled 
to top 200,000. The American people are de-
manding relief, and it is long past time for 
Congress to assist them. I urge my colleagues 
across this aisle to stop playing politics and 
accept this robust and reasonable compromise 
for the good of the American people. 
I urge my colleagues to vote Yay. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of the updated Heroes Act 
we are considering on the floor today. We 
must recognize that the Nation is in great

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5434 
October 1, 2020 
need of continued emergency assistance— 
and this legislation, though not a total solution, 
is a step in the right direction. It prioritizes the 
needs of the Americans so that they are better 
prepared to endure the pandemic, as we con-
tinue to work together towards a long-term so-
lution. 
This updated bill includes several provisions 
from the original Heroes Act, which passed in 
the House of Representatives back in May. It 
also includes much-needed funding for hos-
pitals, community health centers, testing, vac-
cine research, and related items that would 
ensure that our country can make a healthy 
recovery from the pandemic. 
To address the economic impact of COVID– 
19, this bill assists millions of Americans by 
reinstating the Pandemic Unemployment As-
sistance, providing a special enrollment period 
for the health care marketplace, and creating 
additional tax credits for plans offered that are 
affordable for everyone. 
I am pleased that this bill also addresses 
the priorities for my district, including emer-
gency funding to resources for affordable 
housing and homelessness prevention. As co- 
chair of the Congressional Homelessness 
Caucus, I have been adamant that any stim-
ulus package must include emergency rental 
assistance, which is included at $50 billion to 
help low-income renters avoid eviction due to 
our Nation’s recent economic turmoil. This up-
dated bill also includes $5 billion for Emer-
gency Solutions Grants, which is critical to ad-
dress the impact of coronavirus on individuals 
who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. 
For the millions of small businesses across 
the country affected by the pandemic, this bill 
enhances the Paycheck Protection Program 
and allows for businesses to apply and re-
ceive a second PPP loan. It also helps res-
taurants struggling to survive the pandemic by 
creating a $120 billion grant program specifi-
cally for their industry. Finally, it eases the 
process for businesses to get their PPP loans 
forgiven by simplifying loan forgiveness for 
loans less than $150,000. 
Additionally, this legislation provides assist-
ance to state and local governments across 
the country, many of which have felt first-hand 
the adverse impacts COVID–19. This assist-
ance would ensure that first responders and 
health professionals, who have been on the 
front lines keeping us safe during the pan-
demic, would no longer be faced with the pos-
sibility of losing their jobs. It would also help 
these governments continue to provide en-
hanced services during this time of crisis. 
Unlike the CARES Act, this updated version 
of the Heroes Act would provide funding that 
would also go to smaller local governments 
with populations smaller than 50,000. I have 
heard from local government officials in my 
district, in cities like Cedar Hill and Lancaster, 
on how this additional funding would greatly 
impact the level of service they would be able 
to provide to their residents. 
Over the past few months, I have heard 
from many constituents in my district em-
ployed by businesses in the transportation in-
dustry about the adverse effects of COVID–19 
on their work. Workers in the aviation industry, 
who were at risk of being furloughed if Con-
gress failed to act on updated relief legislation, 
will be provided with job security and addi-
tional benefits through the Payroll Support 
Program. The bill also includes $32 billion in 
funding for transit-related relief, which will help 
transit agencies retain employees and con-
tinue maintaining regular service. 
One of the more important discussions we 
have had during the pandemic is how to safely 
reopen schools so that parents, students, 
teachers, administrators, and other school 
staff can remain safe and healthy. That is why 
I was glad to see that this bill provides $225 
billion for education—including $182 billion for 
primary and secondary schools alone—and al-
most $39 billion for institutions for higher 
learning. This critical funding will help schools 
purchase the personal protective equipment 
necessary to protect the wellbeing of school 
officials and their students. 
In the event of a second COVID–19 wave, 
schools may be forced to transition to hybrid 
or remote learning. Therefore, this bill takes a 
proactive approach to this possibility by pro-
viding $12 billion in funding for students to 
stay connected with mobile hotspots and de-
vices like laptops and tablets. This funding 
stream would go a long way in helping close 
the homework gap and allowing internet ac-
cess to rural and underserved communities 
across the country. 
I am heartened that the Heroes Act also in-
cludes provisions to start to address the dev-
astating impacts that the pandemic has had 
on university research as well as on our fed-
eral research agencies. Federally funded re-
search, particularly research carried out at our 
universities, has long been a critical enabler of 
U.S. leadership in science and innovation, 
which in turn will play an important role in as-
suring our future competitiveness and eco-
nomic well being. In addition, university re-
search also plays a key role in preparing the 
next generation of STEM professionals. 
The ongoing pandemic has put that re-
search enterprise in serious jeopardy. Without 
assistance from the federal government, I am 
deeply concerned that many institutions may 
not survive, that years of important research 
will be lost, and that we will suffer irreparable 
harm to our talent pipeline. I am especially 
concerned that the fallout from this pandemic 
will undercut the gains we have made in diver-
sifying our STEM pipeline, including the geo-
graphic diversity that will help communities 
across the Nation revitalize their economies in 
the coming years. To help deal with the dis-
ruptions to university research caused by the 
pandemic, this legislation provides almost $2.9 
billion to the National Science Foundation 
(NSF), funding that will allow extensions of ex-
isting research grants, cooperative agree-
ments, scholarships, fellowships, and appren-
ticeships. The Heroes Act also contains fund-
ing for NOAA, DOE, and NIST to help address 
the impact of the pandemic on those agencies 
operations and capabilities. 
Taken together, these funding provisions 
are an important first step, but more needs to 
be done to mitigate the harmful impact of the 
pandemic on America’s research enterprise 
and on the students and early-career re-
searchers whose activities have been dis-
rupted. I will continue to advocate for such 
measures in future legislation. 
Finally, this bill provides a second round of 
direct cash assistance to qualifying Americans 
in the form of Economic Impact Payments. 
This new round of cash assistance would ex-
tend to mixed families and to students attend-
ing college up to the age of 24. 
Mr. Speaker, overall, this bill takes great 
strides to help Americans suffering because of 
the pandemic, including those with COVID–19, 
those left unemployed, those on the front 
lines, and many others. I urge my colleagues 
to support it. 
Mr. HORSFORD. Mr. Speaker, I am thank-
ful for this bill being brought forward on 
COVID relief before the House goes out of 
session. 
It is important to demonstrate to the Amer-
ican People that we are leading and willing to 
negotiate to provide real relief. 
Unfortunately, this bill does not include a 
pivotal provision—the Worker that would pro-
vide federal assistance to cover the full cost of 
COBRA premiums for laid off and furloughed 
workers. 
That policy is the only one that would pro-
tect the hard-earned benefits that union mem-
bers and working families have fought for. 
So while this bill takes many important steps 
to protect Medicaid and private coverage, it 
provides premium tax credits for unemployed 
Americans—I am concerned that protections 
for employer-sponsored plans were not in-
cluded. 
I urge this body to include all coverage 
measures in our relief package—including 
COBRA coverage for workers who have come 
to rely on their employer-sponsored plans. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1161, the pre-
vious question is ordered. 
The question is on the motion offered 
by the gentlewoman from New York

REQUEST TO CONSIDER S. 886, IN-
DIAN WATER RIGHTS SETTLE-
MENT EXTENSION ACT 
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent to take from 
the Speaker’s desk S. 886 entitled the 
Indian Water Rights Settlement Exten-
sion Act, and ask for its immediate 
consideration in the House. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
guidelines consistently issued by suc-
cessive Speakers, as recorded in sec-
tion 956 of the House Rules and Man-
ual, the Chair is constrained not to en-
tertain the request unless it has been 
cleared by the bipartisan floor and 
committee leaderships. 
PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRIES 
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Parliamentary 
inquiry, Mr. Speaker. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman will state his parliamentary in-
quiry. 
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, 
since the minority leader is supportive, 
or I wouldn’t be here, and I am the 
ranking member and I am supportive of 
it, and the Navajo Nation has been 
told. The chairman of the committee is 
in support of it, does that not con-
stitute the clearance guidelines that 
would allow the Speaker to entertain 
the motion? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. A unani-
mous consent request for consideration 
of that measure would have to receive 
clearance by the majority and minor-
ity floor and committee leaderships. 
The Chair is unaware of such clear-
ance; therefore, the Chair cannot en-
tertain that request at this time. 
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, 
further parliamentary inquiry. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman will state his parliamentary in-
quiry. 
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, 
does that clearance have to be in the 
form of a written statement to the 
Chair? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. As the 
Chair previously advised, that request 
cannot be entertained absent the ap-
propriate clearance, which has not 
been received by the Chair. 
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, 
one final parliamentary inquiry. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman will state his parliamentary in-
quiry. 
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, is 
the Speaker telling me that if the Re-
publicans have cleared this bill and are 
in favor of it, it has to have a written 
clearance from the Democrat side more 
than simply verbal commitment to the 
Tribes? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair has previously stated the clear-
ance is required and has not been re-
ceived by the Chair. 
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, 
did you tell me the form the clearance 
has to have? In what form must it be? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair has advised only that appro-
priate clearance must be provided. It 
has not been so provided, and so the 
Chair cannot entertain the gentleman’s 
request. 
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, 
thank you for your enlightenment. 
f 
REPLACING JUSTICE RUTH BADER 
GINSBURG 
(Ms. ADAMS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg was the conscience of 
the Court and one of the greatest fight-
ers American women have ever had. 
Justice Ginsburg’s dissents spoke for 
all of us—with a righteous anger, a 
moral clarity, and an eye to equality. 
Her lifetime of advocacy for women 
extended far beyond her service on the 
bench. 
Though she is irreplaceable, Justice 
Ginsburg will have a successor. But 
Americans deserve better than an im-
peached President’s last-minute nomi-
nation just weeks before the election. 
We must honor Justice Ginsburg’s 
dying wish that she not be replaced 
until the next President is installed. 
This nominee will shape the future of 
our country, and the American people 
deserve a say. 
f 
SUPPORT NOMINATION OF JUDGE 
AMY CONEY BARRETT 
(Mrs. WALORSKI asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today along with members of the Indi-
ana delegation in support of the nomi-
nation of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to 
the U.S. Supreme Court. We can think 
of no one better qualified to serve on 
the Nation’s highest court than our fel-
low Hoosier, Judge Barrett. 
Her record as a law professor and ap-
pellate judge demonstrates her first- 
rate legal mind and her unwavering 
commitment to constitutional prin-
ciples. She graduated summa cum 
laude and first in her class at Notre 
Dame Law School, clerked for Judge 
Antonin Scalia, and returned to her 
alma mater as a highly respected pro-
fessor. 
In 2017, she was confirmed by the 
Senate on a bipartisan vote as judge on 
the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, 
where she currently serves. 
Finally, Judge Barrett is a woman of 
faith and a dedicated mother of seven. 
Given her impeccable credentials, she 
should be qualified and confirmed with-
out delay. 
Mr. Speaker, we applaud President 
Trump for fulfilling his promise to ap-
point judges who will faithfully uphold 
the rule of law, defend the Constitu-
tion, and protect the life and liberty of 
every American.

b 2130 
IN PRAISE OF THE HEROIC 
ACTIONS OF HEIDI DREES 
(Mr. CUNNINGHAM asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to praise the heroic actions 
of Heidi Drees, a Jefferson Award win-
ner. 
On July 1, 2020, Heidi saved the life of 
a wounded Charleston County deputy, 
Mike Costanzo, after deciding to stop 
when she saw a crumbled human on the 
ground. Not only did she pull over to 
report and update details of the acci-
dent to 911, Heidi did what any coura-
geous and kindhearted person would 
do; she comforted Deputy Costanzo in 
his dire time of need. Heidi held his 
hand, kept him alert, and she did not 
leave his side until medical profes-
sionals arrived on the scene. 
Heidi and Mike have mutually agreed 
that they are connected for the rest of 
their lives, and Heidi knows that it was 
a higher power that put her there on 
that day. 
I rise today to honor Heidi with the 
hope that she may be an inspiration to 
us all if we find ourselves in similar 
situations. 
f 
CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF 
BLAKE LOVETTE 
(Ms. FOXX of North Carolina asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.) 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, on Tuesday, Blake Lovette, a 
true giant not only in the North Caro-
lina agriculture community, but in the 
civic community, passed away unex-
pectedly. 
Blake was a good friend, and to say 
he made a profound impact on the 
Wilkes County community would be an 
understatement. 
From his time on the Wilkes Board of 
Education to his role as the president 
of ConAgra Poultry, Blake was never 
satisfied with the status quo and be-
lieved that complacency was never an 
option. As chairman of the Wilkes 
County Republican Party, Blake exer-
cised a level of diligence and grace that 
was second to none. 
To Blake’s family, I pray that God 
will continue to bless you and give you 
comfort during this difficult time.

HONORING JUSTICE RUTH BADER 
GINSBURG 
(Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ asked 
and was given permission to address

Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to honor a fearless vi-
sionary woman who has transcended

generations with her legal mind, com-
passion, and wit. 
As a Jewish woman, she was a per-
sonal inspiration to me, my daughters, 
and millions of others who follow in 
her footsteps and are guided by the 
same values of justice and tikkun 
olam. 
In Hebrew, there is a saying: ‘‘May 
your memory be for a revolution.’’ And 
that aim is our promise to Justice 
Ginsburg. 
Around this country, access to vital 
reproductive healthcare is hanging on 
by a thread. 
Yesterday marked the 44th anniver-
sary of the Hyde Amendment. 
Low-income women and women of 
color are forced to make tough eco-
nomic decisions every day that often 
put their own lives and that of their 
families at risk because of their inabil-
ity to access critical family planning. 
Just 
Ginsburg 
fought 
for 
these 
women. For all women. She was a tire-
less defender of our Nation’s promise of 
freedom, justice, and equality for all. 
Yet with her passing, we find our-
selves in a push to subvert reproduc-
tive rights and dismantle healthcare 
protections that 135 million people, in-
cluding me, with a preexisting condi-
tion, rely upon. 
Justice Ginsburg passed on Erev 
Rosh Hashanah, the start to the Jewish 
new year. They say that those who die 
on this day are a tzadik, or a person of 
righteousness. Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
was certainly that and more. 
May Justice Ginsburg’s memory be a 
blessing and her example a righteous 
inspiration for us all.

CELEBRATING HISPANIC 
HERITAGE MONTH 
(Mr. NEWHOUSE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, today 
I rise in celebration of Hispanic Herit-
age Month. 
In my home district of central Wash-
ington, the history and the culture of 
Hispanic Americans is woven into the 
fabric of our communities. From small 
businesses in manufacturing to agri-
culture and artistry, the success of our 
communities is dependent on the suc-
cess of our diverse and vibrant His-
panic populations. 
Earlier this year, the House passed 
legislation to finally establish the Na-
tional Museum of the American Latino 
in our Nation’s Capital. It is my hope 
that this museum will empower all of 
us to learn about and engage with the 
history of Hispanic Americans and 
their contributions to our history and 
our culture. 
In central Washington and across the 
country, we are proud of our Hispanic 
friends and neighbors who prove that 
the American Dream is alive and well. 
Because of them, we are a stronger, 
more diverse, more prosperous society, 
and I urge my colleagues to join me in 
celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month. 
FORT BEND COUNTY ROCKS ON 
(Mr. OLSON asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, COVID–19 
hit Fort Bend County hard in March. 
Our local concert venue, the Smart Fi-
nancial Centre, has not rocked since, 
yet Fort Bend County has rocked on. 
The Fort Bend Hope Clubhouse kept 
rocking—proof: ROCKS I received from 
the director, Kerry Beth Cottingham. 
We met Monday back home. She gave 
me these two rocks with a common 
message, #clubhouserocksTexas. 
They rock because they are giving 
people with mental conditions the 
skills they need to build confidence 
and 
independence. 
Members 
choose 
every day where they want to work: 
work in the kitchen, go to class, cler-
ical work, technical work, or just out-
reach about the magic happening at 
the clubhouse. 
Keep rocking, Fort Bend Hope Club-
house. Let’s rock into Mental Health 
Awareness Week that starts next week. 
Mahalo.

PAY TRIBUTE TO JUSTICE RUTH 
BADER GINSBURG BY VOTING 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
take this time to not only speak to the 
American people about voting, but also 
just take a brief moment to pay a be-
ginning tribute to Justice Ruth Bader 
Ginsburg. She deserves a much longer 
period of acknowledgment, and I am 
going to do so as we return back to 
Washington in the coming days and 
weeks. In fact, I believe that we should 
dedicate weeks and days of honoring 
Justice Ginsburg, even in the midst of 
this potential nomination to replace 
her. 
I want to speak to the American peo-
ple as we begin our journey toward No-
vember 3 and let them know of the pre-
cious right to vote, that citizenship 
gives them that very precious right to 
make their own decision. I have no 
right to tell them that, but as a Mem-
ber of the United States Congress, I 
have an obligation to ensure that their 
vote is protected, however they vote. 
I must ensure that there is a truthful 
understanding of mail ballots. Some 
States have been voting with mail bal-
lots for decades. I must ensure that the 
mail ballots are protected, the early 
vote is protected, and, as well, it is pro-
tected on November 3. 
I just want to indicate, Justice Gins-
burg said in the Shelby case that the 
majority’s logic was akin to ‘‘throwing 
away your umbrella in a rainstorm be-
cause you are not getting wet.’’ 
Justice Ginsburg believed in voting 
and voting protection. Let’s pay trib-
ute to her and vote. 
Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor Supreme 
Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died 
on Friday, September 18, 2020 at the age of 
87 years old. 
As a direct beneficiary of her advancement 
of women’s rights and a long-time admirer of 
her vigorous defense of the Constitution, I am 
honored but heartbroken to pay tribute to Jus-
tice Ginsburg, an American hero, feminist 
icon, and role model to millions. 
Today, tomorrow, and forever, the American 
people mourn the loss of a true titan, an 
American legend, and an inspiration. 
Our thoughts and prayers are with Ruth’s 
family, friends, and loved ones. 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg dedicated her life to 
defending the Constitution and protecting the 
sanctity of America’s democratic ideals, and 
we will forever be indebted to her service to 
this country. 
Joan Ruth Bader, fondly nicknamed Kiki, 
was born on March 15, 1933 to an immigrant 
family and grew up in Brooklyn’s Flatbush 
neighborhood. 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg often spoke of her 
mother’s large ambitions for her, and how the 
devastating loss of her mother’s death at an 
early age instilled in her the determination to 
live a life that her mother would have been 
proud of. 
And so, she did. 
Ruth Bader attended Cornell University 
where she met Martin D. Ginsburg, her future 
husband and love of her life to whom she was 
married for 54 years. 
At the age of 21, Ruth Bader graduated Phi 
Beta Kappa from Cornell with a Bachelor of 
Arts degree in Government on June 23, 1954, 
and was the highest-ranking female student in 
her graduating class. 
A month after graduating from Cornell, Ruth 
and Martin were married and moved to Fort 
Sill, Oklahoma, where Martin was stationed as 
a Reserve Officers’ Training Corps officer in 
the U.S. Army Reserve after his call-up to ac-
tive duty. 
To help support the family, Ruth Bader 
Ginsburg worked for the Social Security Ad-
ministration office in Oklahoma, where she 
was demoted after becoming pregnant with 
her first child, Jane, who was born in 1955. 
In the fall of 1956, Ruth Bader Ginsburg en-
rolled at Harvard Law School, where she was 
one of only 9 women in a class of about 500 
men. 
Harvard Law Dean Erwin Griswold report-
edly invited all the female law students to din-
ner at his family home and asked the female 
law students, including Ginsburg, ‘‘Why are 
you at Harvard Law School, taking the place 
of a man?’’ 
When her husband took a job in New York 
City, Ruth Bader Ginsburg transferred to Co-
lumbia Law School and became the first 
woman to be on two major law reviews: Har-
vard Law Review and Columbia Law Review. 
In 1959, she earned her law degree at Co-
lumbia and tied for first in her class but de-
spite these enviable credentials and distin-
guished record of excellence, no law firm in 
New York City would hire her as a lawyer be-
cause she was a woman. 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg became a crusader for 
women’s rights and an unstoppable force who 
transformed the law and defied social conven-
tion. 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg, later affectionately 
known as the ‘Notorious RBG,’ was as instru-
mental and historically significant to the cause 
of women’s rights as was Thurgood Marshall

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5439 
October 1, 2020 
to the cause of civil rights for African Ameri-
cans. 
As a young lawyer and Director of the 
Women’s Rights Project of the American Civil 
Liberties Union, Ruth Bader Ginsburg litigated 
six landmark cases before the Supreme Court, 
winning five out of the six cases. 
Like Justice Marshall, Ruth Bader Gins-
burg’s uncanny strategic instincts and careful 
selection of cases were vital in her persuasion 
of the all-male Supreme Court to start disman-
tling the legal institution of sex discrimination 
one case at a time. 
In 1975, Ruth Bader Ginsburg litigated and 
won Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, which would 
become a landmark case in antidiscrimination 
jurisprudence. 
In this case, the widower had been denied 
survivor benefits, which would allow him to 
stay at home and raise his son, based on a 
Social Security provision that assumed only 
women were secondary providers with unim-
portant incomes. 
While some questioned Ginsburg’s choice to 
challenge instances of sex discrimination by 
representing a male plaintiff, Ruth Bader Gins-
burg saw it as an opportunity to show the 
court that childcare was not a sex-determined 
role to be performed only by women. 
As with many of her cases, her goal was to 
free both sexes, men as well as women, from 
the roles that society had assigned them and 
to harness the Constitution to break down the 
structures by which the state maintained and 
enforced those separate spheres. 
As Ruth Bader Ginsburg continued to chal-
lenge the stereotypical assumptions of what 
was considered to be women’s work and 
men’s work, she was able to persuade the 
Court and the nation that discriminating on the 
basis of sex was not only wrong but also a 
violation of the 14th Amendment of the Con-
stitution, which guarantees equal protection to 
all citizens under the law. 
As the courts began to recognize the chang-
ing roles of men and women, Ruth Bader 
Ginsburg was able to advance gender equality 
with the understanding that women are capa-
ble of being heads of households or sole pro-
viders for their family. 
In 1993, President Bill Clinton appointed 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the Supreme Court, 
making her the second woman to fill this posi-
tion. 
This historic appointment further symbolized 
the principle that women were equal to men in 
every respect, that they could have successful 
careers and also could, if they chose, be de-
voted wives or mothers, thereby breaking bar-
riers for generations of women to follow in her 
footsteps. 
In fact, many of Ginsburg’s opinions helped 
solidify the constitutional protections she had 
fought so hard to establish decades earlier. 
While we commemorate Justice Ginsburg’s 
work for advancing the women’s movement 
both as a Justice and as a lawyer, all are in 
her debt who cherish the progress made in 
the areas of LGBTQ+ equality, immigration re-
form, environmental justice, voting rights, pro-
tections for people with disabilities, and so 
much more. 
Throughout her life, Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
worked to make the law work so that America 
would be more just, equitable, fairer, and bet-
ter for all. 
Whether it be in her legendary dissenting 
opinions or as leader when in the majority, 
Justice Ginsburg continued to advocate for the 
marginalized and most vulnerable. 
In recent years, she may not have been 
able to control the outcome of the rulings, but 
she grew bolder in her dissents, often stating 
what should have been the outcome. 
Throughout her tenure on the bench, Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg displayed her rigorous and in-
cisive legal mind and employed her formidable 
skills as a consensus builder, but she could be 
tough and forceful when the moment de-
manded. 
Nothing illustrates this better than her fa-
mous dissent in Shelby County v. Holder, in 
which the 5-to-4 majority negated the Voting 
Rights Act of 1965 by invalidating section 4 of 
the law, which neutralized section 5, the provi-
sion of the act that required jurisdictions with 
a history of racial and ethnic discrimination in 
voting to obtain preclearance from the federal 
government before any changes in voting pro-
cedures, from polling stations to voter photo 
IDs could go into effect. 
It was in her scathing dissent Justice Gins-
burg stated, ‘‘Hubris is a fit word for today’s 
demolition of the VRA’’ and that the majority’s 
logic was akin to ‘‘throwing away your um-
brella in a rainstorm because you are not get-
ting wet.’’ 
Unlike the others, Justice Ginsburg was 
able to see the ramifications of the ruling and 
its allowances for reinvigorated efforts of voter 
suppression. 
Today, I join millions of individuals who are 
mourning the loss of this legal giant, feminist, 
and trailblazer. 
Justice Ginsburg loved this country, so 
much so that she served the nation while en-
during illnesses and undergoing treatments 
that would have incapacitated lesser mortals. 
She inspired generations of women then 
and now to shatter glass ceilings, and her leg-
acy will inspire new generations of women in 
the years to come. 
As the news of her passing continues to re-
verberate across the country and around the 
world, it is important that we remember and 
honor what she stood for and continue fighting 
to realize the goal of equal justice under law. 
I am honored to be able to pay tribute to the 
memory of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader 
Ginsburg, the ‘Notorious RBG,’ one of the 
greatest jurists in our nation’s history, a tire-
less and unyielding champion for equal justice, 
and a fierce defender of the Constitution.

ABANDONED WELLS MUST BE 
PLUGGED 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, last week, I introduced 
H.R. 8332, the Plugging Orphan Wells 
and Environmental Restoration Act, or 
the POWER Act. This bill would au-
thorize the Federal orphan well reme-
diation program under the Energy Pol-
icy of 2005 for 5 years at $50 million per 
year. 
The POWER Act would also establish 
a grant program for environmental res-
toration and reclamation of orphaned 
wells on State as well as private and 
Tribal lands, authorized at $400 million 
per year for 5 years. 
It is estimated that Pennsylvania has 
more orphaned wells than any other 
State. Pennsylvania is the birthplace 
of the modern petroleum industry, and 
the Commonwealth’s oil and gas indus-
try has helped lead America to energy 
independence. 
We have both an economic and envi-
ronmental 
responsibility 
to 
ensure 
abandoned wells are plugged, and the 
POWER Act would ensure these legacy 
sites are appropriately handled to pro-
tect the environment, while also stim-
ulating jobs in the oil and gas sector. 
This will be a win-win for America and 
a win-win, certainly, for Pennsylvania. 
I thank GUY RESCHENTHALER, my col-
league from Pennsylvania, for joining 
me on this legislation, and I urge my 
colleagues to support oil and gas well 
remediation through the POWER Act.

Approval of this prospectus constitutes au-
thority to execute an interim lease for all

apply an overall utilization rate of 187 square 
feet or less per person, except that, if the Ad-
ministrator determines that the overall uti-
lization rate cannot be achieved, the Admin-
istrator shall provide an explanatory state-
ment to the Committee on Transportation 
and Infrastructure of the House of Rep-
resentatives prior to exercising any lease au-
thority provided in this resolution. 
Provided that, except for interim leases as 
described above, the Administrator may not 
enter into any leases that are below pro-
spectus level for the purposes of meeting any 
of the requirements, or portions thereof, in-
cluded in the prospectus that would result in 
an overall utilization rate of 187 square feet 
or higher per person. 
Provided that, to the maximum extent 
practicable, the Administrator shall include 
in the lease contract(s) a purchase option 
that can be exercised at the conclusion of 
the firm term of the lease. 
Provided further, that the General Services 
Administration shall not delegate to any 
other agency the authority granted by this 
resolution. 
Provided further, that the Administrator

procurement is identical to the delineated 
area included in the prospectus, except that, 
if the Administrator determines that the de-
lineated area of the procurement should not

provide an explanatory statement to the 
Committee on Transportation and Infra-
structure of the House of Representatives

ber a response in writing that provides any 
information requested regarding the project. 
Provided further, the Administrator of Gen-

individual holding a Federally-elected office, 
regardless of whether such individual took 
office before or after execution of this lease, 
to directly participate in, or benefit from or 
under this lease or any part thereof and that 
such provision provide that if this lease is 
found to have been made in violation of the 
foregoing prohibition or it is found that this 
prohibition has been violated during the 
term of the lease, the lease shall be void, ex-
cept that the foregoing limitation shall not 
apply if the lease is entered into with a pub-
licly-held corporation or publicly-held entity 
for the general benefit of such corporation or 
entity. 
Provided further, prior to entering into this 
lease or approving a novation agreement in-
volving a change of ownership under this

a foreign-owned entity; provided further, in 
such an instance, the Administrator of Gen-
eral Services shall notify the occupant agen-
cy(ies) in writing, and consult with such oc-
cupant agency(ies) regarding security con-
cerns and necessary mitigation measures (if 
any) prior to award of the lease or approval 
of the novation agreement. 
Provided that, to the maximum extent 
practicable, the Administrator of General 
Services shall require that the lease procure-
ment consider the availability of public 
transportation consistent with agency mis-
sion requirements and that the space to be

provements, including renewable energy up-

COMMITTEE RESOLUTION 
ALTERATION—ANTHONY J. CELEBREZZE 
FEDERAL BUILDING, CLEVELAND, OH 
Resolved by the Committee on Transportation 
and Infrastructure of the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives, that pursuant to 40 U.S.C. § 3307,

The project will renovate and provide con-
solidated space in the Celebrezze Building for

cost of $71,763,000, a prospectus for which is

The approval requested in the FY 2020 
amended prospectus reflects a reduction of

amends the authorization of the Committee 
on June 27, 2018 of Prospectus No. POH–0192– 
CL18. 
Provided, that the General Services Admin-
istration shall not delegate to any other 
agency the authority granted by this resolu-

ber a response in writing that provides any

ment to the Committee on Transportation

thority provided in this resolution. 
Provided that, except for interim leases as 
described above, the Administrator may not

spectus level for the purposes of meeting any 
of the requirements, or portions thereof, in-
cluded in the prospectus that would result in 
an overall utilization rate of 175 square feet

Provided that, to the maximum extent 
practicable, the Administrator shall include 
in the lease contract(s) a purchase option 
that can be exercised at the conclusion of

other agency the authority granted by this 
resolution. 
Provided further, that the Administrator

if the Administrator determines that the de-
lineated area of the procurement should not 
be identical to the delineated area included 
in the prospectus, the Administrator shall 
provide an explanatory statement to the 
Committee on Transportation and Infra-
structure of the House of Representatives 
prior to exercising any lease authority pro-
vided in this resolution. 
Provided further, not later than 30 calendar 
days after the date on which a request from

Provided further, the Administrator of Gen-
eral Services may not enter into this lease if 
it does not contain a provision barring any 
individual holding a Federally-elected office, 
regardless of whether such individual took 
office before or after execution of this lease, 
to directly participate in, or benefit from or 
under this lease or any part thereof and that 
such provision provide that if this lease is 
found to have been made in violation of the 
foregoing prohibition or it is found that this 
prohibition has been violated during the 
term of the lease, the lease shall be void, ex-
cept that the foregoing limitation shall not 
apply if the lease is entered into with a pub-
licly-held corporation or publicly-held entity 
for the general benefit of such corporation or 
entity. 
Provided further, prior to entering into this 
lease or approving a novation agreement in-
volving a change of ownership under this 
lease, the Administrator of General Services 
shall require the offeror or the parties re-
questing the novation, as applicable, to iden-
tify and disclose whether the owner of the 
leased space, including an entity involved in 
the financing thereof, is a foreign person or 
a foreign-owned entity; provided further, in 
such an instance, the Administrator of Gen-
eral Services shall notify the occupant agen-
cy(ies) in writing, and consult with such oc-
cupant agency(ies) regarding security con-
cerns and necessary mitigation measures (if 
any) prior to award of the lease or approval 
of the novation agreement. 
Provided that, to the maximum extent 
practicable, the Administrator of General 
Services shall require that the lease procure-
ment consider the availability of public 
transportation consistent with agency mis-
sion requirements and that the space to be 
leased be renovated for all cost effective im-
provements, including renewable energy up-
grades, water efficiency improvements, and 
indoor air quality optimization, that reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions.

total annual cost of $10,292,000 for a lease 
term of up to 20 years, a prospectus for which 
is attached to and included in this resolu-

Approval of this prospectus constitutes au-
thority to execute an interim lease for all

of the new lease. 
Provided that, the Administrator of General

istrator shall provide an explanatory state-
ment to the Committee on Transportation

resentatives prior to exercising any lease au-
thority provided in this resolution. 
Provided that, except for interim leases as 
described above, the Administrator may not 
enter into any leases that are below pro-
spectus level for the purposes of meeting any 
of the requirements, or portions thereof, in-
cluded in the prospectus that would result in 
an overall utilization rate of 345 square feet 
or higher per person. 
Provided that, to the maximum extent 
practicable, the Administrator shall include 
in the lease contract(s) a purchase option 
that can be exercised at the conclusion of 
the firm term of the lease. 
Provided further, that the General Services 
Administration shall not delegate to any 
other agency the authority granted by this 
resolution. 
Provided further, that the Administrator 
shall require that the delineated area of the 
procurement is identical to the delineated 
area included in the prospectus, except that, 
if the Administrator determines that the de-
lineated area of the procurement should not 
be identical to the delineated area included 
in the prospectus, the Administrator shall 
provide an explanatory statement to the 
Committee on Transportation and Infra-
structure of the House of Representatives 
prior to exercising any lease authority pro-
vided in this resolution. 
Provided further, not later than 30 calendar 
days after the date on which a request from 
the Chair or Ranking Member of the Com-
mittee on Transportation and Infrastructure 
of the House of Representatives is received 
by the Administrator of General Services, 
the Administrator shall provide such Mem-
ber a response in writing that provides any 
information requested regarding the project. 
Provided further, the Administrator of Gen-
eral Services may not enter into this lease if 
it does not contain a provision barring any 
individual holding a Federally-elected office, 
regardless of whether such individual took 
office before or after execution of this lease, 
to directly participate in, or benefit from or 
under this lease or any part thereof and that 
such provision provide that if this lease is 
found to have been made in violation of the 
foregoing prohibition or it is found that this 
prohibition has been violated during the 
term of the lease, the lease shall be void, ex-
cept that the foregoing limitation shall not 
apply if the lease is entered into with a pub-
licly-held corporation or publicly-held entity 
for the general benefit of such corporation or 
entity. 
Provided further, prior to entering into this 
lease or approving a novation agreement in-
volving a change of ownership under this 
lease, the Administrator of General Services 
shall require the offeror or the parties re-
questing the novation, as applicable, to iden-
tify and disclose whether the owner of the 
leased space, including an entity involved in 
the financing thereof, is a foreign person or 
a foreign-owned entity; provided further, in 
such an instance, the Administrator of Gen-
eral Services shall notify the occupant agen-
cy(ies) in writing, and consult with such oc-
cupant agency(ies) regarding security con-
cerns and necessary mitigation measures (if 
any) prior to award of the lease or approval 
of the novation agreement. 
Provided that, to the maximum extent 
practicable, the Administrator of General 
Services shall require that the lease procure-
ment consider the availability of public 
transportation consistent with agency mis-
sion requirements and that the space to be 
leased be renovated for all cost effective im-
provements, including renewable energy up-

such provision provide that if this lease is 
found to have been made in violation of the 
foregoing prohibition or it is found that this 
prohibition has been violated during the 
term of the lease, the lease shall be void, ex-
cept that the foregoing limitation shall not 
apply if the lease is entered into with a pub-
licly-held corporation or publicly-held entity 
for the general benefit of such corporation or 
entity. 
Provided further, prior to entering into this 
lease or approving a novation agreement in-
volving a change of ownership under this 
lease, the Administrator of General Services 
shall require the offeror or the parties re-
questing the novation, as applicable, to iden-
tify and disclose whether the owner of the

such an instance, the Administrator of Gen-
eral Services shall notify the occupant agen-
cy(ies) in writing, and consult with such oc-
cupant agency(ies) regarding security con-
cerns and necessary mitigation measures (if 
any) prior to award of the lease or approval 
of the novation agreement. 
Provided that, to the maximum extent 
practicable, the Administrator of General 
Services shall require that the lease procure-
ment consider the availability of public 
transportation consistent with agency mis-
sion requirements and that the space to be

FIRE FACTS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman 
from 
Arkansas 
(Mr. 
WESTERMAN) until 10 p.m. as the des-
ignee of the minority leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on the topic of this Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Arkansas? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, fires 
are ravaging the West. I want to talk a 
little bit about what is going on with 
the fires, and I want to talk about what 
is not going on here in Congress. 
To start with, I just want to take a 
quick look at the science of fire. 
This fire triangle shows that three 
things are required to have a fire. You 
have to have fuel, heat, and oxygen. 
There is a lot of talk about the role 
climate change is playing in these 
fires. Climate increasing temperatures 
can draw fuel. If it gets windy, you can 
have more oxygen. Lightning can be 
one of the things to ignite fires, but a 
lot of fires obviously are ignited by 
man-made ways. 
When we talk about putting out fire, 
the first thing we do is try to get the 
fuel out of the way, or we use water to 
cool the fire and remove the oxygen. 
But we have to spend way too much 
time working on extinguishing fires 
when we can take the actions to reduce 
the fuel to reduce the fires. 
Any time I talk about forest manage-
ment, I get accused of wanting to 
clear-cut the national forests, and I 
can promise you the last thing I want 
to do is clear-cut the national forests. 
I want to use good management on the 
national forests. That is what we 
should be doing. But I often wonder if 
those people who talk about clear-cut-
ting even have any idea of what a 
clear-cut is. 
I have put this chart together that 
shows a comparison between a clear- 
cut and a catastrophic wildfire, and I 
will go on the record and say that cata-
strophic wildfires are worse than clear- 
cuts. 
Look at the data. 
During a clear-cut, the trees are 
killed. During a catastrophic wildfire, 
the trees are killed. 
During a clear-cut, the trees are re-
moved. During a catastrophic wildfire, 
you are left with dead snags that can 
be fuel for additional wildfires. All 
vegetation is killed. That is what hap-
pens in a catastrophic wildfire. At least 
in a clear-cut you leave the residual 
grasses and the shrubs. 
b 2145 
Stream zones are protected when a 
clear-cut is done. You leave vegetation 
around the stream. Catastrophic wild-
fire burns to the edge of the water. 
Soil and organic materials are all 
burned up in a catastrophic wildfire. 
Special care is taken to protect the soil 
in a clear-cut. 
When a clear-cut is planned, a plan 
for reforestation is also in place. Often 
on catastrophic wildfire, there is no re-
forestation. 
As far as planting goes, it is exten-
sive with a clear-cut. It is unplanned 
and uncontrolled in a catastrophic 
wildfire. 
The size of a clear-cut, in California, 
it is less than 20 acres. Wildfires are 
huge, burning millions of acres. We 
have almost burned 8 million acres to 
date in the wildfire season this year in 
the U.S. 
We can continue going down the list, 
but you can see, even talking about 
carbon, at least with a clear-cut, you 
are putting the wood into material 
that stores carbon. With a wildfire, you 
are releasing the carbon into the air. 
And these dead snags eventually rot. 
And they are not just releasing carbon 
dioxide like the fire does; they are re-
leasing methane, which is a worse 
greenhouse gas. 
Clear-cutting is not something that 
we want to do in a national forest, but 
people who are not allowing good forest 
management—and 
that 
is 
Congress 
with the rules that we have—are doing 
something 
much 
more 
devastating 
than clear-cutting by allowing these 
catastrophic 
wildfires 
to 
continue 
unabated. 
Just as an example, this is the An-
gora fire. That is a natural clear-cut. 
That is a stand replacing fire. 
This is 12 years later, where you have 
no regrowth on the site. 
On top of that, according to the 
USGS, in 2018, the carbon emissions 
from 
wildfires 
released 
the 
same 
amount of carbon as the emissions that 
would 
be 
produced 
by 
generating 
enough electricity to power California 
for a whole year. 
Mr. Speaker, we need to take action. 
It is not that the Forest Service 
doesn’t know how to manage the land, 
it is that we have tied their hands and 
we have allowed activists and lawyers 
to manage the forests rather than the 
professionals in the Forest Service. 
If we don’t want to see the same 
things repeating over and over, with 
loss of life, loss of property, loss of a 
resource that actually pulls carbon di-
oxide out of the air and could be used 
to reduce the effects of climate change, 
we should do something proactive and 
actually start managing these forests. 
It is time to act, and unfortunately, 
Congress has sat on their hands while 
we continue to watch the West burn. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Arizona (Mr. GOSAR). 
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Speaker, first of all, 
I thank the gentleman from Arkansas 
(Mr. WESTERMAN), my friend, for orga-
nizing this Special Order and for his 
leadership and expertise on forestry 
issues. 
The events of the last month and the 
last decade plus show how poorly our 
current forest management policies are 
and that they are broken and in drastic 
need of reform. 
Nearly every corner of the West has 
been touched by catastrophic wildfire. 
My district has been home to several 
major fires this year, including the 
Bush fire that burned over 193,000 
acres. 700,000 acres of land has been 
burned across my State. 
Even before this year’s fire season, 
the evidence of our forest management 
practices being broken are clear. In the 
last 10 years alone, wildfires have 
burned over 74 million acres of land in 
the West, and our Federal Govern-
ment’s reaction to this has been ex-
tremely lacking. 
These catastrophic fires have dev-
astating impacts on the environment 
and human health. For example, one 
large wildfire is roughly the equivalent 
of a major volcanic eruption, releasing 
large amounts of dangerous particles 
into the air. This increase of air pollu-
tion exacerbates respiratory illnesses, 
such as COVID–19. 
Because of this, earlier this year, I 
wrote a letter to Agriculture Secretary 
Perdue and Interior Secretary Bern-
hardt. This letter urged them to act 
quickly to secure contracts with pri-
vate businesses to ensure that fire-
fighters could be properly protected 
from COVID–19 and that the aerial sup-
port they needed to adequately fight 
catastrophic fires was there. 
Recent studies conducted at George 
Mason University showed that on aver-
age, a fire stands a higher probability 
of being contained within 24 hours if 
air tankers are deployed on that fire 
within the first few hours. Fires that 
do not receive air tanker support for a 
period of 13 hours or more are likely to 
take days or weeks to achieve contain-
ment. 
I also wrote a letter to Attorney Gen-
eral Barr that urged him to ensure that 
the Justice Department’s Natural Re-
sources 
Division 
was 
adequately 
resourced to fight frivolous lawsuits 
from radical leftwing environmental 
organizations. 
Lawsuits 
from 
radical 
environ-
mentalists are nothing new. We have 
seen this already in Arizona with the 
disastrous WildEarth Guardians law-
suit regarding the Mexican Spotted 
Owl. In that case, a U.S. District Court 
judge in Tucson issued a ruling based 
on bad and debunked science that 
stopped active forest management ac-
tivities in six national forests, includ-
ing the Tonto National Forest in Ari-
zona, which was the home of the Bush 
fire. 
This decision was a massive setback, 
and it is directly contributing to the 
enhanced fire risk that threatens our 
communities that we are seeing across 
the West. 
A devastating wildfire season is not 
inevitable. It isn’t something that we 
must just accept. There are steps that 
can be taken now to ensure that our 
communities are protected.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5635 
October 1, 2020 
I will continue to urge the Federal 
agencies tasked with managing our for-
ests and fighting catastrophic fires 
that bold action is necessary. Lives de-
pend on it. 
Just last year, as chairman of the 
Congressional Western Caucus, I had 
the opportunity to visit the district of 
my friend from California, Mr. MCCLIN-
TOCK, where aggressive forest manage-
ment practices in the Lake Tahoe 
Basin have prevented catastrophic fire. 
This active management was made pos-
sible by getting unnecessary red tape 
out of the way and putting what is 
most important first: protecting our 
communities from the destruction of 
wildfire. 
Just in the last 2 years, this adminis-
tration has taken steps to manage 
vegetation 
inside 
utility 
corridors, 
build additional firebreaks, and reform 
the NEPA process within the Forest 
Service. However, after so many years 
of inaction, there is a long road to hoe 
to where we have to get, which is why 
I am so pleased we are here tonight 
calling for serious action by this 
House. 
There are a few pieces of legislation 
that have been introduced. Just to 
name a few: H.R. 7978, a bipartisan, 
comprehensive forestry reform bill led 
by the gentleman from California (Mr. 
LAMALFA), as well as H.R. 2607, the Re-
silient Federal Forests Act, by Mr. 
WESTERMAN, both of which I am proud 
to support. 
The Democratic leadership in this 
House has been transparent about the 
fact that they do not view forest man-
agement to prevent wildfires as a legis-
lative priority, and that has deadly 
consequences. 
Again, Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
friend from Arkansas for holding this 
Special Order and for his leadership 
and expertise on this issue. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Arizona 
(Mr. GOSAR) for being here tonight. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Washington (Mr. NEWHOUSE). 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Arkansas 
(Mr. WESTERMAN), my good friend, for 
yielding. 
As we all know, the West has been on 
fire. 
In my home State of Washington, 
over 700,000 acres have burned, causing 
thousands of families to evacuate, 
leaving their homes, their businesses, 
and their farms behind. Whole towns 
have essentially been wiped off the 
map. 
Smoke 
blanketed 
central 
Wash-
ington, with fires raging up and down 
the West Coast. The air quality of our 
cities and our rural areas ranked the 
worst in the world. 
As the people of central Washington 
and many of my colleagues in Congress 
understand, healthy, resilient forests 
are the key to wildfire prevention. We 
have made significant progress, but 
there is still much work to be done. 
Without our leadership in Congress, 
families will continue to lose their 
homes and their businesses, and jobs 
will continue to be lost, and our public 
health will continue to be threatened. 
While a loss of homes and livelihoods 
is heartbreaking, there is nothing more 
tragic than the loss of life. 
Today, I join the people of central 
Washington in mourning the loss of 1- 
year-old Baby Hyland, whose life was 
tragically cut short as his parents fled 
to escape the Cold Springs fire that 
was raging across Okanogan County. 
The Hyland family has suffered im-
measurable loss with the deaths of 
both their toddler as well as the death 
of their unborn child. My heart aches 
and my prayers go out for the Hylands 
as they recover from their own wounds 
in this unimaginable heartbreak. 
These tragic circumstances fall on 
us, Mr. Speaker. We are responsible, as 
the Federal Government, for failing to 
deliver a management strategy that 
enables us to prevent these cata-
strophic events. 
We cannot continue to sit idly by. 
We have to responsibly log our for-
ests and graze our lands, or we will 
watch them burn. 
These wildfires and this year have 
truly tested our resilience, but of this 
I am certain: in the face of catas-
trophe, central Washington will re-
cover. 
Now it is the Federal Government’s 
responsibility to do everything in its 
power to prevent another disaster like 
this again. 
For years, extreme environmentalist groups 
have insisted that we leave our forests and 
natural lands alone, leaving them in their 
quote ‘‘natural state.’’ But as we witness, year- 
after-year, that strategy simply does not work. 
Many point to climate change as a contrib-
uting factor; I am not here to refute that. At the 
end of the day though, the facts remain: our 
land management—or lack thereof—is a seri-
ous problem. 
Decades of mismanagement, misguided en-
vironmental policies, and lackluster forestry 
and grazing practices have led to forests and 
grasslands that act as tinder for wildfires, just 
waiting to be set ablaze each summer. 
We cannot continue to sit idly by. We have 
to responsibly log our forests and graze our 
lands, or we will watch them burn. 
As I have stated all along throughout the 
many challenges this year has presented: 
Central Washington’s communities are resil-
ient. 
Wildfire recovery is no easy feat, but I have 
seen firsthand how citizens, volunteers, local 
organizations, and government entities work 
together to revive our communities, rebuild our 
fallen structures, and actively work to prevent 
future devastation. 
I have heard stories of students and volun-
teers jumping into action, working to clear 
burnt areas, making way for new structures. 
Fairgrounds and community groups opened to 
help house and treat evacuated or injured live-
stock and animals. Donations continue to pour 
in from across the state, region, and country 
to families and firefighters in need. 
I am working closely with FEMA and USDA 
to ensure our communities receive the federal 
assistance they need, and I stand ready to 
help the people of our district in any way I 
can. 
These wildfires—and this year—have tested 
our resilience, but of this I am certain: In the 
face of catastrophe, Central Washington will 
recover. Now it is the federal government’s re-
sponsibility to do everything in its power to 
prevent another disaster like this again. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Washington 
(Mr. NEWHOUSE) for his comments to-
night. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Alabama (Mr. PALMER). 
Mr. PALMER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. 
WESTERMAN) for holding this discussion 
about forest management. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today because 
‘‘California’s forests suffer from ne-
glect and mismanagement, resulting in 
overcrowding that leaves them suscep-
tible to disease, insects and wildfire.’’ 
These are not my words. They are the 
words of the Little Hoover Commis-
sion, an independent State oversight 
agency in California. 
In their 2018 report entitled ‘‘Fire on 
the Mountain,’’ the Little Hoover Com-
mission called for a transformational 
change in California forest manage-
ment practices after ‘‘A century of 
mismanaging Sierra Nevada forests has 
bought 
an 
unprecedented 
environ-
mental catastrophe that impacts all 
Californians.’’ That is a direct quote 
from the report. 
California’s own Legislative Ana-
lyst’s Office agreed and found that lim-
itations on timber harvests and empha-
sis on fire suppression and an increas-
ing number of environmental permit-
ting 
requirements 
have 
led 
to 
unhealthily dense forests. 
Thankfully, both groups recognize 
that commonsense forest management 
practices could not only help prevent 
wildfires, but also reduce carbon emis-
sions. Properly managed and healthy 
forests are more resilient and sequester 
more carbon than overgrown forests. 
Simple recommendations like shift-
ing from fire suppression to using fire 
as a tool and setting up long-term for-
est management strategies are just a 
couple of the low-cost solutions that 
can help us achieve healthier forests. 
Unlike policies such as the Green 
New Deal, these practices would actu-
ally help address wildfires and would 
not cost trillions of dollars to imple-
ment. Furthermore, these actions can 
all be taken today, and they fall in line 
with some of the things that my Re-
publican colleagues and I have been 
suggesting on the Select Committee on 
the Climate Crisis: that if we take ac-
tion to mitigate and adapt to the cli-
mate change that we know is going to 
occur, we could avoid some of the ca-
tastrophes that we are seeing play out 
in California right now and in other 
places in the West. 
If you care about protecting our citi-
zens from wildfires and reducing car-
bon emissions, then you should support 
responsible forest management. In-
stead of wasting time on unrealistic so-
lutions, we should take serious action 
to prevent unnecessary wildfires and

from Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON). 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman 
from Arkansas (Mr. WESTERMAN) for 
hosting this Special Order on wildfire. 
Mr. Speaker, over the past decade, 
there has been an average of 64,100 
wildfires and 6.8 million acres burned 
every year. 
With over 10 million acres burned, we 
saw the highest number of Federal 
acres burned in 2015—and nearly that 
amount in 2017. 
But this year, it has been even worse. 
2020 has been an extremely difficult 
wildfire year for our firefighters, our 
responders, and many rural commu-
nities in and near the forests. 
As of today, October 1, over 44,000 
wildfires have burned nearly 7.7 million 
acres this year alone. 
In addition to the destruction of 
these forests, homes, and property, we 
sadly continue to see lost lives. 
Over the past 25 years, active man-
agement has plummeted across the na-
tional forest system; consequently, it 
is no coincidence that the larger, more 
intense fires are happening on Federal 
lands, where there is less management, 
versus State and private lands. 
More individual fires occur in the 
East, but the wildfires in the West are 
larger and burn more acres. Wildfires 
also have significant impacts on east-
ern forests because of the budgetary ef-
fects on the Forest Service’s ability to 
manage and personnel. 
We must be encouraging more active 
forest management across the National 
Forest system. This includes thinning, 
prescribed fires, and hazardous fuels re-
duction, especially in the roughly 19 
million acres of Federal lands that are 
already known to be at high risk. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, 
Mr. WESTERMAN, for his great work 
during the last farm bill and his leader-
ship with the Resilient Federal Forests 
Act and the Trillion Trees Act. 
Through the next farm bill, I am 
hopeful that we can continue to build 
on those commonsense reforms, and we 
will provide more authorities to help 
the Forest Service better manage and 
encourage more partnerships. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Pennsyl-
vania (Mr. THOMPSON) for being here 
tonight. 
Mr. Speaker, I just want to illustrate 
here that this isn’t difficult. It is not 
rocket science. 
This is a control in the first picture. 
You see all the underbrush, the ladder 
fuels. This is on Federal land as well. 
You see the forest management in 
the middle where you thin it out, you 
do controlled burns. You do those 
every few years, and you get a resilient 
forest that looks like this. 
California and Oregon and Arizona 
and Washington State, Nevada, they 
could have forests that look like this. 
Now, it would be those species that are 
out there, and the management would 
be done accordingly, but there is no 
reason we can’t do this. 
It is Speaker PELOSI’s State that is 
on fire. It is Chairman GRIJALVA’s 
State that is on fire. It is Chairman 
DEFAZIO’s State that is on fire. 
I wish that Democrats would take 
time to do what is right, to address 
these fires, to quit playing politics 
with relief bills that are going nowhere 
and do something that could really 
help the people and their States. 
We want to help, but we can’t do it 
on our own. We are in the minority. 
We will work together and offer sug-
gestions, but it is going to take a bi-
partisan effort to change these rules so 
that management can take place. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor 
our firefighters who put their lives on the line 
to keep our communities safe every day. As 
new wildfires start every week, these brave 
men and women selflessly join the fight to pro-
tect life and property, while their families must 
live with the uncertainty of the threats they 
face on the frontlines. I commend these indi-
viduals, and Congress must provide all the 
support necessary to ensure our firefighters 
can return safely to their families. 
I also commend the heroes joining the fight 
from across the country. California’s fire-
fighting resources are strained by the sheer 
number and size of the fires we face, and it 
is a testament to our nation’s highest ideals 
that firefighters from across the West have 
come to our aid as these historic fires rage in 
every corner of our state. 
Riverside County has already faced four dis-
tinct fires this wildfire season, burning over 
60,000 acres in and around my district. In 
these fires alone, 17 individuals have been in-
jured, and one firefighter lost his life trying to 
put out the El Dorado fire. Charlie Morton was 
a 14-year veteran of the Forest Service, and 
I send my deepest condolences to Charlie’s 
family for their terrible loss. 
Nearly every year California seems to break 
some record during the fire season. 
It doesn’t have to be this way. 
For years, top congressional Democrats 
have rejected bipartisan proposals to reform 
our nation’s forest management practices. 
Many Democrats have outright rejected the 
idea that how we manage our National For-
ests has anything to do with the increasing 
frequency and intensity of wildfires in the 
West. 
Well, here are some of the facts: 
Since 2010, approximately 150 million trees 
have died across federal, state, and private 
lands in California. 
It is estimated that over 2 million properties 
are at extreme risk of wildfire due to high fuel 
loads nearby. 
Between 60 and 80 million acres of national 
forest are at high- to very-high risk of cata-
strophic wildfire, but the Forest Service treats 
between just 1 and 2 percent of high risk 
acres each year. 
In January, a study in Nature found that 
California needs to treat approximately 20 mil-
lion acres to meaningfully impact wildfire risk. 
We treat closer to 13,000 acres annually. 
Bureaucratic delays and frivolous lawsuits 
have halted much of this proactive work. The 
town of Berry Creek, received a grant to re-
move hazardous fuels, but it took the state 
nearly two years to review the project and 
allow it to proceed. By the time they did, it 
was too late, and the North Complex fire was 
already raging, destroying more than 50 
homes in this community. 
Salvage logging is another example of a 
win-win solution where companies still have 
an economic incentive to harvest the timber 
while helping prevent the next catastrophic 
wildfire. Charred trees left in the wake of 
wildfires are extremely flammable and haz-
ardous fuels. Salvage operations must be con-
ducted quickly or the economic value is lost, 
and extreme environmental groups frequently 
file lawsuits to halt these efforts. 
In 2018 when I served as Chairman of the 
Interior 
Appropriations 
Subcommittee, 
I 
worked in a bipartisan fashion with Congress-
woman MCCOLLUM to prioritize forest manage-
ment and fuel reduction on our federal lands. 
We worked in good faith to achieve some 
meaningful reforms including a funding fix for 
the Forest Service and some limited regulatory 
reforms. Still, much more needs to be done to 
protect our communities. 
We need to eliminate the red-tape that pre-
vents these common-sense management ef-
forts. We must take forest management deci-
sions out of the courts and put the forest man-
agers back in the driver’s seat. Fortunately, 
House Republicans have solutions. 
Congressman MCCLINTOCK’s Proven Forest 
Management Act takes lessons learned from a 
pilot program in Lake Tahoe National Forest. 
Land managers were able to approve the first 
forest management project in under four 
months in a 16-page report, compared to an 
average of 4.5 years and 500 pages. We 
should pass this bill and expand this success-
ful program nationwide. 
Congressman WESTERMAN’s Resilient Fed-
eral Forests Act is another example. This leg-
islation has passed the House twice with over-
whelming bipartisan support but was never 
considered by the Senate. This bill would 
streamline permitting for a wide array of forest 
management projects. When it comes to forest 
management, time is of the essence, and this 
legislation would dramatically increase our na-
tional capability to reduce the frequency and 
severity of catastrophic fires across the West. 
I call on Speaker PELOSI to take up these 
bills and pass meaningful, comprehensive for-
estry reform. More bureaucracy is not the an-
swer to our wildfire crisis, and we in Congress 
must act like there are lives at stake, because 
that is the reality of the threat we face.

S6009 
Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 1, 2020 
No. 171 
Senate 
The Senate met at 12 noon and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal God, our heavenly Father, we 
cry to You, but sometimes You seem so 
far away. In our despair, You some-
times seem distant, and we are tempt-
ed to surmise that we are all alone. 
When we shout, we seem to hear the 
echoes of our anguish. Nonetheless, we 
know that You are holy, mighty, and 
good. We have trusted You too long to 
let go. 
Empower our Senators for these chal-
lenging times. Remove from their 
minds all bitterness and contempt for 
one another. Keep their hearts clean, 
their spirits courageous, and their 
minds clear as they face these daunting 
times. 
We pray in Your omnipotent Name. 
Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
FISCHER). Under the previous order, the 
leadership time is reserved. 
The President pro tempore. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 
minute in morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
ELECTION SECURITY 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
President Trump was rightly criticized 
for dodging a question about the peace-
ful transfer of power. Instead, Trump 
criticized mail-in ballots and rejected 
the premise that he will lose. 
No, that doesn’t mean that he is 
planning some sort of coup, but it is 
important for any President to choose 
their words very carefully. 
The same is true for partisans on the 
other side whipping up fear that our 
democracy is in jeopardy or that the 
ballots will not be counted. Even worse 
is the rhetoric setting the stage to 
delegitimize any future Trump victory. 
We now hear full-blown conspiracy 
theories. Let me mention a few. A 
group of Biden supporters conducted a 
war game speculating that the Presi-
dent will not leave office without a 
Biden landslide, questioning what the 
military would do. 
The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff stepped in with a simple civics 
lesson. The U.S. military has no role in 
the elections, he said. 
Democrats have doubled down on this 
debunked theory that the Postal Serv-
ice is plotting with Trump to disrupt 
the election mail. The Postal Service 
does not answer to the President of the 
United States. It has plenty of capacity 
to deliver election mail. Plus, the Fed-
eral Government doesn’t run elections; 
the 50 States run those elections. 
A key goal of Russian ‘‘active meas-
ures,’’ dating back to the Cold War, has 
been to get Americans to doubt their 
government, its leaders, and demo-
cratic institutions. Let’s not do Rus-
sia’s dirty work for them. No American 
should be questioning our free and fair 
elections. 
Now to my State of Iowa. Our people 
who have requested absentee ballots 
will have ballots mailed to them start-
ing on October 5. Remember to fill it 
out completely, including your driver’s 
license or voter PIN number, and mail 
them to your county auditor well be-
fore election day but not later than the 
day before. 
Your ballot can be tracked on the 
secretary of state’s website. Check out 
where your ballot is. 
I have great faith in Iowa’s election 
officials 
and 
our 
postal 
workers. 
Iowans who vote in person or absentee 
can be assured that your vote will 
count—the same as any election. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
NOMINATION OF AMY CONEY 
BARRETT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
at this time last week, the Nation did 
not 
know 
whom 
President 
Trump 
would be nominating to the Supreme 
Court, but, amazingly, we did know 
what kinds of false attacks the far left 
would deploy against whoever it was. 
Democrats and special interests have 
been telling the country for 45 years— 
45 years—that every Supreme Court va-
cancy under a Republican President 
was going to bring about the apoca-
lypse. John Paul Stevens, they said, 
was anti-woman. David Souter, they 
said, wanted to hurt vulnerable people. 
John Roberts was out to get health in-
surance. 
And wouldn’t you know, the Presi-
dent had barely finished saying Judge 
Amy Coney Barrett’s name before the 
same old attacks began rolling in. Our 
77-year-old male former Vice President 
and our 69-year-old male Senate Demo-
cratic leader have tried to inform

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6010 
October 1, 2020 
American women that this 48-year-old 
working mom wants to roll back her 
own rights as a woman—roll back her 
own rights as a woman. 
Democrats have tried to fearmonger 
around a 4-year-old academic paper 
that reinforced one unfair penalty in 
ObamaCare, which Congress, by the 
way, already eliminated 3 years ago. 
As an aside, if the American people 
are interested in which Senators are 
serious about protecting Americans 
with preexisting conditions, they can 
simply look up the vote Senators took 
last night—just last night. Every sin-
gle Democrat voted against legislation 
from Senator TILLIS that would have 
cemented protections for these vulner-
able Americans. 
Democrats voted to block protections 
for preexisting conditions just like 
they voted to block hundreds of bil-
lions of dollars for coronavirus relief 
and just like they voted to block police 
reform—and a thousand other things 
they tell Americans they support but 
vote 
against 
to 
block 
bipartisan 
progress. 
So here is another one of the made- 
up attacks: Democrats are demanding 
that Judge Barrett commit in ad-
vance—in advance—to recuse herself 
from entire categories of cases for no 
reason. This is another totally in-
vented standard. Nobody has ever sug-
gested that Supreme Court Justices 
should categorically sit on the side-
lines until the President who nomi-
nated them has left office. What an ab-
surd suggestion. 
Justices Ginsburg and Breyer were 
confirmed during President Clinton’s 
very first term. Justices Sotomayor 
and Kagan were confirmed during 
President Obama’s first term. All four 
of these Justices went on to participate 
in election-related proceedings while 
the President who had nominated them 
was on the ballot. 
Justices Breyer and Ginsburg partici-
pated actively in Clinton v. Jones and 
other matters connected to President 
Clinton’s eventual impeachment. In 
fact, they urged and attempted to get 
the Supreme Court even more involved. 
This is a sideshow—a sideshow. If 
Judge Barrett is confirmed, she will 
swear an oath. She will have a lifetime 
appointment. Nobody seriously is sug-
gesting she lacks any bit of the integ-
rity which everyone trusted Justice 
Ginsburg, 
Justice 
Breyer, 
Justice 
Sotomayor, Justice Kagan, and count-
less others to exercise. In fact, her in-
tegrity and independence are precisely 
what Judge Barrett’s peers across the 
political spectrum go out of their way 
to applaud. 
Judge Barrett has no obligation to 
make any of the bizarre—bizarre—pre-
judgments that our Democratic col-
leagues are demanding. Like I said, 
much of the script has been entirely 
predictable. 
I will tell you one thing I did not pre-
dict. I honestly did not expect the 
Democratic leader to come to the Sen-
ate floor and say that concerns about 
anti-religious 
discrimination 
are 
‘‘manufactured hysterics.’’ I didn’t ex-
pect that. 
I do not expect we will hear the lead-
er of the Democratic conference stand 
on the Senate floor and say that Amer-
ica’s freedom of religion is ‘‘an imagi-
nary issue.’’ 
The Democratic leader claimed indig-
nantly 
that 
his 
fellow 
Democrats 
would never—never—make an issue out 
of a nominee’s personal religious be-
liefs. He took great offense that such a 
thing would even be suggested. 
But the whole country knows that, 3 
years ago, when the Judiciary Com-
mittee was considering this very nomi-
nee—this one—for her current position, 
Senate Democrats did precisely that, 
exactly that. The senior Senator from 
California literally implied in front of 
the entire country that Judge Barrett 
was too Catholic—too Catholic—to be a 
judge. Here was the quote: ‘‘The dogma 
lives loudly within you,’’ she said. 
‘‘And that’s of concern.’’ 
The senior Senator from Illinois 
asked Judge Barrett in the official 
record—listen to this—‘‘Do you con-
sider yourself an ‘orthodox Catholic?’ ’’ 
The junior Senator from Hawaii felt 
compelled to tell the nominee—listen 
to this—‘‘You would be a Catholic 
judge.’’ ‘‘You would be a Catholic 
judge.’’ 
No one imagined these exchanges, 
but they happened on video before the 
entire Nation. Multiple sitting Sen-
ators fretted in an open hearing that 
Judge Barrett’s religious views created 
doubts about her fitness to serve. 
Outside the Senate, it was not imagi-
nary when one faith group in which 
Judge Barrett and her family partici-
pate reportedly came under cyber at-
tack a few days ago. Their membership 
directory was reportedly hacked, just 
as 
Judge 
Barrett 
emerged 
as 
a 
frontrunner. 
Nobody had to imagine the ominous 
articles from AP, Reuters, the Wash-
ington Post, and POLITICO, all imply-
ing there was something questionable— 
questionable—or 
problematic 
about 
Judge Barrett’s faith practices. 
Nobody had to imagine POLITICO 
sending a contributing editor to snoop 
around the church buildings and report 
what a youth group had written on 
their whiteboard. 
So, no, Americans don’t have to 
imagine this elite disdain. All they 
have to do is read it. 
It is not just this one nominee. No-
body imagined it when the junior Sen-
ator from Vermont accused a different 
nominee of hatred and Islamophobia 
because he had previously expressed a 
personal view that Christianity gets 
things right, which Islam gets wrong. 
It is not imaginary when the junior 
Senator from California cast aspersions 
on yet another nominee for—listen to 
this—belonging to the Knights of Co-
lumbus. And another Democrat implied 
he should quit this mainstream Catho-
lic group if he wanted to hold public of-
fice. Quit the Knights of Columbus if 
you want to hold public office? In 
America? 
The Democratic leader says these are 
manufactured hysterics. He says people 
who call this out are hysterical. Frank-
ly, it would be better for our country if 
that were true, but that is not the case. 
Just yesterday, 24 hours after the 
Democratic leader swore that Demo-
crats would not make this an issue, the 
junior Senator from Hawaii tried to 
say Judge Barrett’s faith is ‘‘irrele-
vant’’ but immediately proceeded to 
question ‘‘whether her closely held 
views can be separated from her ability 
to make objective, fair decisions.’’ No 
one—no one—should be deceived by 
these thinly veiled euphemisms. 
This is the exact form that religious 
discrimination had taken in America 
for 
decades—for 
decades—especially 
when it comes to public service. 
We do not often hear people say they 
simply dislike a particular religion al-
together. Thank goodness we are most-
ly past that kind of bigotry. No, going 
all the way back to Jack Kennedy, the 
more common accusation has been 
something a little more subtle—that 
people of deep faith or certain faiths 
are incapable of being fair or objective; 
that they are incapable of doing cer-
tain jobs well; that such Americans are 
torn between divided loyalties and not 
to be trusted. 
Here is what the left is trying to say: 
Oh, we have no problems—no prob-
lems—with Judge Barrett’s faith in an 
abstract sense. We just think it dis-
qualifies her from this promotion. 
Madam President, that is the defini-
tion of discrimination. 
About a century ago, openly anti- 
Catholic political cartoons pictured 
the Pope or the Catholic Church as an 
octopus wrapping its tentacles around 
the institutions of American Govern-
ment. Thankfully those displays are 
long gone, but the core attitude clearly 
is not. 
Americans of faith are not imagining 
the increasingly hostile climate that 
the political left and the media have 
spent literally years sowing. And, no, 
there is no free pass, as some com-
mentators 
have 
suggested, 
because 
many 
prominent 
liberal 
voices 
or 
prominent Democrats themselves iden-
tify as Catholic. You don’t get a free 
pass just by calling yourself a Catholic. 
More than one-fifth of our country 
belongs to the same church as Judge 
Barrett—one-fifth of our country. Tens 
and tens of millions of Americans—all 
of them—like all Americans, must be 
free to live their faiths in diverse and 
different ways without being barred— 
without 
being 
barred—from 
public 
service. These kinds of aspersions do 
not become any more acceptable if the 
call is coming from inside the house. 
Sadly, none of these problems are 
imaginary. The American people’s con-
cerns are not manufactured. 
The Little Sisters of the Poor did not 
wake up thinking it would be good fun 
if 
the 
Obama-Biden 
administration 
tried to force them to violate their own

consciences. These nuns did not manu-
facture their lengthy legal battle for 
the fun of it. It was the secularizing 
left that went on offense. 
Churches all across America did not 
go looking for one of this cycle’s 
Democratic Presidential contenders to 
suggest places of workshop should lose 
their tax exempt status if they preach 
or practice traditional teaching. It was 
the secularizing left that went on of-
fense. 
If parts of the elite American left 
have become this out of touch with 
mainstream religious beliefs held by 
millions and millions of their fellow 
citizens, it will take more than victim 
blaming to dig out of it. They could 
start this week. They could start 
today. 
They could commit to evaluating 
Judge Barrett on her credentials and 
her qualifications, and they could stop 
gawking at deeply religious Americans 
like they have encountered extra-
terrestrial life or bought a ticket for a 
safari.

MEASURES PLACED ON THE 
CALENDAR—S. 4773, S. 4774, S. 4775 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I understand there are three bills at 
the desk due for a second reading, en 
bloc. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The lead-
er is correct. 
The clerk will read the bills by title 
for the second time. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A bill (S. 4773) to establish the Paycheck 
Protection Program Second Draw Loan, and 
for other purposes. 
A bill (S. 4774) to provide support for air 
carrier workers, and for other purposes. 
A bill (S. 4775) to provide continued emer-
gency assistance, educational support, and 
health care response for individuals, fami-
lies, and businesses affected by the 2020 
coronavirus pandemic. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. In order to place 
the bills on the calendar under the pro-
visions of rule XIV, I would object to 
further proceedings, en bloc. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion being heard, the measures will be 
placed on the calendar, en bloc. 
f 
PROTECT ACT—MOTION TO 
PROCEED 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I move to proceed to Calendar No. 554, 
S. 4675. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the motion to pro-
ceed. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
Motion to proceed to S. 4675, a bill to 
amend the Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The as-
sistant Democratic leader. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—H.R. 5602 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I 
come to the floor today to speak to one 
of the most significant issues facing 
the security of our Nation. It is a ques-
tion of domestic terrorism, specifically 
the threat of violent White suprema-
cists. 
In Tuesday’s Presidential debate, 
moderator Chris Wallace asked Presi-
dent Trump to condemn White su-
premacists 
and 
rightwing 
militia. 
President Trump refused. Instead, he 
replied—and I quote—‘‘Proud Boys, 
stand back and stand by.’’ 
The Proud Boys, a far-right group 
that promotes and engages in violence, 
viewed President Trump’s words as a 
call to action. The group’s leader Joe 
Biggs said he took the President’s 
words as a directive to ‘‘[F] . . . them 
up.’’ 
I was appalled, but not surprised, by 
the President’s words. He has a long 
history of inflammatory, racist re-
marks. Now, President Trump claims 
that violence is a ‘‘left-wing problem, 
not a right-wing problem’’—his words. 
Let me be clear. I join Vice President 
Biden in condemning all violence, but 
we know that White supremacists pose 
a great threat. An unclassified May 
2017 FBI-DHS joint intelligence bul-
letin found that ‘‘white supremacist 
extremism poses [a] persistent threat 
of lethal violence.’’ This was a finding 
by the lead law enforcement agencies 
of the Trump administration. They 
went on to say that White suprema-
cists were responsible for more homi-
cides from 2000 to 2016 than any other 
domestic extremist movement. The di-
rector of the FBI, Christopher Wray, in 
response to a question I posed in the 
Senate Judiciary Committee last year, 
said that the majority of domestic ter-
rorism arrests involved White suprema-
cists. 
Now, for years, I have urged the 
Trump administration to respond to 
the ongoing threat of violent White su-
premacists and other far-rightwing ex-
tremists. Instead, they have repeatedly 
downplayed this very lethal and real 
threat. 
Attorney General Barr has never re-
sponded to the multiple letters I have 
sent, asking what the Department of 
Justice was doing to combat White su-
premacist violence. 
Unfortunately, as we have learned 
from former Trump administration of-
ficials themselves, the Trump adminis-
tration has downplayed the threat of 
violent White supremacists. POLITICO 
recently reported that a draft home-
land threat assessment report from 
DHS was edited to weaken language on 
the threat posed by violent White su-
premacists. And a DHS whistleblower 
alleged that DHS officials, including 
Ken Cuccinelli, requested the modifica-
tion of the report to make the threat of 
White supremacists ‘‘appear less se-
vere’’ and add information on violent 
leftwing groups. 
It is not enough to just stand here 
and condemn the President’s remarks 
at the infamous debate. The American 
people sent us to Congress to act. 
There is something we can do now. 
There is something that we can do that 
will show we are prepared to respond to 
this threat to law and order, to this 
threat of violent White supremacists. 
I am the lead sponsor of the Domes-
tic Terrorism Prevention Act, bipar-
tisan legislation that would address 
the threat of violent White suprema-
cists and other domestic terrorists. 
Our bill would establish offices to 
combat domestic terrorism at the De-
partment of Justice, the FBI, and the 
Department of Homeland Security. It 
would require these offices to regularly 
assess the domestic terrorism threat 
and focus their limited resources on 
the most significant threats. Criti-
cally, they would provide training re-
sources to assist State, local, and Trib-
al law enforcement in addressing the 
domestic terrorism threat. The House 
companion to my bill was introduced 
by my colleague and friend Congress-
man BRAD SCHNEIDER of Illinois. 
Just last week, the House of Rep-
resentatives passed our bill on a unani-
mous voice vote. The Senate should 
pass it today. 
In a few moments, staff will provide 
me with the language to ask for a 
unanimous consent. I am waiting so 
there is an opportunity for both sides 
to discuss the procedure moving for-
ward. In the meantime, several of my 
colleagues have asked to come to the 
floor and address the issue. I would 
yield to them for comment or question, 
through the Chair, with the hopes that 
when the procedural language arrives, I 
might be able to make the unanimous 
consent request. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam Presi-
dent, we are here today on probably 
one of the most serious national secu-
rity issues that we will confront. I say 
that as a member of the Armed Serv-
ices Committee, having received a vari-
ety of classified briefings on threats to 
this country. Some of them regarding 
ongoing foreign interference in our 
election are truly chilling. But the 
threat to our national security from 
White supremacists, now operating so 
openly that the Director of the FBI has 
said they are one of the paramount 
threats and an ongoing security threat 
to our Nation, demands that there 
should be action now. 
The bill that my colleague Senator 
DURBIN is offering passed unanimously 
by the House of Representatives within 
recent days. Let me repeat. It passed 
unanimously by the House of Rep-
resentatives. It reflects the real and ur-
gent danger of this threat. 
The President has refused to de-
nounce White supremacists. The Presi-
dent has told one of the most promi-
nent of those groups to stand by. That 
failure—an abject failure on the part of 
the Commander in Chief—to respond to 
an ongoing security threat demands 
this action now. We must stand up for 
the integrity of our elections, the secu-
rity of our Nation, and the funda-
mental freedoms that we prize as 
American people.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6012 
October 1, 2020 
We will not allow this cancer to me-
tastasize in this country and thwart 
the will of Americans who are going to 
the polls, in effect, right now. The bal-
lots are being cast. The threat to our 
electoral will is ongoing. 
I am proud to join my colleagues who 
are here on the floor who represent an 
ideological spectrum, as did the House 
of Representatives in unanimously ap-
proving 
this 
bill. 
The 
paramount 
threat to our Nation and the integrity 
of our elections is White supremacy, 
violent extremism, and nationalism 
that potentially jeopardize the very 
pillars of our democracy. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from Vir-
ginia. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia. 
Mr. KAINE. Madam President, I rise 
to support the efforts of my colleagues 
to bring the unanimous House bill es-
tablishing legal procedures for dealing 
with White supremacy to the floor of 
the Senate. I do so in honor of four Vir-
ginians. 
In August of 2017, a group called 
Unite the Right held a White suprema-
cist rally in Charlottesville, VA. They 
started on a Friday evening, when Jew-
ish residents of Charlottesville were 
gathering in synagogues and when stu-
dents were coming to the University of 
Virginia to start their academic ca-
reers. They rampaged through the cam-
pus and community chanting slogans 
from Nazi rallies like ‘‘Jews will not 
replace us’’ or ‘‘Blood and soil.’’ 
As if that were not terrorizing 
enough, on the next day, they esca-
lated physical attacks against many. 
Heather Heyer was a Charlottesville 
resident and paralegal with an amazing 
background and story who was peace-
fully protesting that day, and a White 
supremacist from another State revved 
his car up, hit her and killed her. 
DeAndre Harris was a special edu-
cation instructional aide in Charlottes-
ville, and he was set upon by a number 
of White supremacists and beaten se-
verely with objects. 
There were two Virginia State Troop-
ers, Jay Cullen and Berke Bates, both 
of whom I knew. Jay Cullen often flew 
me in a helicopter when I was Gov-
ernor, and I met Berke Bates, the 
trooper, because he was part of Gov-
ernor McCullough’s security detail. 
They were called out on that day, 
which would have been a day off. They 
were called out on that day because 
they needed to provide extra security 
as this White supremacist rally ran 
amuck in Charlottesville. On that day, 
both of them lost their lives as their 
helicopter malfunctioned. 
I stand on the floor of the Senate 
thinking of these four Virginians—two 
of whom I knew, three of whom lost 
their lives, and one who was injured se-
verely in this Unite the Right rally—to 
say that it is time we have laws in this 
country that would enable us to appro-
priately deal with the chief source of 
domestic terrorism. For that, I thank 
my colleague. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alabama. 
Mr. JONES. Thank you, Senator 
DURBIN for this bill. Thank you for the 
colleagues who are on here. 
I was struck when Senator KAINE 
rose in honor of those who died in Vir-
ginia. The list goes on and on. You can 
go to Emmett Till. You can go to the 
four girls, Addie Mae Collins, Carole 
Robertson, Denise McNair, and Cynthia 
Wesley. You can go to those who lost 
their lives in a church in Charleston, 
SC. The thing that connects them all is 
not just that they died because of the 
color of their skin, not just because of 
the White supremacists who were try-
ing to change the political dynamic in 
this country. It is an unbroken stream 
that goes back decades and genera-
tions. It goes back to the time of the 
great original sin of slavery, when 
White supremacy tried to dominate 
this country, and it goes back to a 
string of unbroken deaths that are oc-
curring even as we speak. 
Hate crimes across this country have 
proliferated, whether it is not just 
White on Black or it is the Tree of Life 
synagogue. It is so many things that 
we have to stop. 
The interesting thing to me of what 
happened this week is that the day 
after the Presidential debates when the 
President of the United States refused 
to condemn White supremacy, the Gov-
ernor of the State of Alabama, my 
friend Kay Ivey—Republican Governor 
of the State of Alabama—apologized to 
the victims of the 16th Street Baptist 
Church bombing that occurred 57 years 
ago. It was an implicit acknowledge-
ment that words matter, that state-
ments of public officials have an effect 
on people. They give a green light to 
violence, often even unintended. 
This bill Senator DURBIN has pro-
posed 
that 
passed, 
as 
Senator 
BLUMENTHAL and others said, unani-
mously is a statement that we cannot 
allow this to continue. It is a state-
ment that we will—as law enforcement, 
as citizens, as people in a free coun-
try—we will put an end to this kind of 
rhetoric and this kind of hate. 
Folks, we cannot let this moment 
pass in this body. The House passed 
this bill unanimously and so should the 
U.S. Senate. We should make a stand 
with our colleagues in the House—Re-
publican and Democrat—that this is an 
important statement right now be-
cause what is unsaid so much right now 
is that we see this playing out in this 
country. We see it playing out in the 
streets. And we can talk about it from 
the right or the left, and we can talk 
about it from Republicans or Demo-
crats, but the fact is, we need to be 
talking about it in terms of people and 
victims—innocent 
victims. 
That 
is 
what this bill is about—protecting the 
lives of all Americans, regardless of the 
color of their skin, regardless of their 
religion, regardless of their political 
persuasion. This bill will do that. 
Give the FBI the tools necessary. 
Give the statement from the U.S. Sen-
ate that we will not stand for this. Sup-
port this bill. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
Mr. BOOKER. I am really grateful, 
Madam President. 
It has been said, and it is quite true, 
that the only thing necessary for evil 
to be triumphant is for good people to 
do nothing. 
Here we are at a time where we know 
our history. Since 9/11, the greatest 
terrorism we have seen in our country, 
actions from a church in South Caro-
lina to a synagogue in Pittsburgh, to a 
Walmart in El Paso, time and time 
again, the violence that we have seen 
and the greatest terrorist activities 
since 9/11 have been domestic ter-
rorism—rightwing extremists, the ma-
jority of them White supremacists. 
The warnings we are now getting 
from our intelligence officials, accord-
ing to one Judiciary hearing from the 
Department of Homeland Security, are 
that the most significant threat right 
now to the security of our country is 
White supremacy and violent White su-
premacy. 
The FBI has given a number of warn-
ings. We now are heading toward an 
election where we are seeing signs of 
increased activity, increased hate, in-
creased focus. This body—this good 
body, friends on both sides of the 
aisle—this is not a time where we can 
do nothing. We must act. We must take 
measures and steps to end this kind of 
violent scourge in our country. 
Obviously, this will not accomplish 
everything. But in a time like this, we 
must do something. I join my col-
leagues in support of this legislation. I 
want to, again, affirm the fact, quite 
encouraging, that it passed in a bipar-
tisan manner in the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives. That is so encouraging. 
We should do the same here. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The as-
sistant Democratic leader. 
ADDITIONAL COSPONSOR 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous 
consent 
that 
Senator 
MANCHIN’s name be added as a cospon-
sor to S. 3190. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, we 
are asking for unanimous consent to 
pass a bill that has passed the House of 
Representatives 
unanimously 
by 
a 
voice vote—unanimously—to empower 
and direct the law enforcement agen-
cies of the United States to use their 
talents and resources to stop domestic 
terrorism, to stop the killing. We are 
identifying, in the course of it, the 
White supremacy and far-right extre-
mism as one of the sources. 
Listen to what a Trump administra-
tion Department of Justice official 
wrote last year in the New York Times: 
White supremacy and far-right extremism 
are among the greatest domestic-security 
threats facing the United States. Regret-
tably, over the past 25 years, law enforce-
ment at the Federal and State levels have 
been slow to respond.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6013 
October 1, 2020 
Killings committed by individuals in 
groups associated with far-right ex-
tremist groups have risen significantly. 
We are not manufacturing a crisis. The 
Trump administration Department of 
Justice official concurs with our ac-
tions that they are needed. 
How did I get involved in this? It 
goes back to 2012. As chairman of a 
Senate Judiciary subcommittee, I held 
a hearing on the threat of violent 
rightwing extremism after a White su-
premacist murdered six worshippers at 
a Sikh gurdwara in Oak Creek, WI. Of-
ficials from the Department of Justice, 
Homeland Security, and FBI—even at 
that time—testified about the threat 
posed by violent domestic extremists. 
When President Trump was asked 
and challenged to condemn this vio-
lence, he refused. 
The question is whether the U.S. 
Senate, now given the same oppor-
tunity, will stand as the House of Rep-
resentatives has on a unanimous, bi-
partisan basis to say ‘‘enough’’ when it 
comes to domestic terrorism inspired 
by White supremacy and rightwing ex-
tremism. 
Let me add that there is nothing in 
this bill to stop the efforts of those 
same agencies to police and stop left-
wing extremism—all extremism. I have 
no problem in condemning all of it, but 
we are focusing on the one that is the 
most significant in the words of the 
Department of Justice. 
I ask unanimous consent that the 
Committee on the Judiciary be dis-
charged from further consideration of 
H.R. 5602 and that the Senate proceed 
to its immediate consideration; fur-
ther, that the bill be considered read a 
third time and passed; and that the 
motion to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table with no 
intervening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Wisconsin. 
Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object, I just found 
out about this bill a couple of hours 
ago. I have been busy. I haven’t really 
been able to really research it, and 
that is part of the problem with what 
our Democratic colleagues are trying 
to do here in just quickly rushing it 
through the U.S. Senate. Maybe this 
has had a full vetting in the House of 
Representatives, but here, in the U.S. 
Senate, it hasn’t gone through any 
committee process whatsoever. 
Unfortunately, I also have to make 
the point—because I am sure they are 
trying to make a political point as op-
posed to trying to make law today— 
that I am opposed to all forms of do-
mestic terrorism, including White su-
premacists. I think I speak for all of 
my Republican colleagues, and I think 
I speak for every U.S. Senator: We all 
abhor domestic violence and terror, in-
cluding White supremacists. 
Again, I don’t have much knowledge 
about this even though I am chairman 
of the committee of jurisdiction of one 
of the Departments that would be sub-
ject to this piece of legislation. I know 
that the Department was not consulted 
on this piece of legislation. I have been 
given notice here that the Department 
of Justice does not support this piece 
of legislation because it says it would 
seriously impede its ability to work in 
the domestic terrorism space. Again, I 
am not exactly sure why the Depart-
ment of Justice does not like this piece 
of legislation. Suffice it to say that it 
doesn’t. The Department of Homeland 
Security was not even consulted on 
this. As chairman of the Homeland Se-
curity Committee, I don’t know any-
thing about this bill. 
This is not the way to pass a serious 
piece of legislation that deals with a 
serious issue. If it is a good piece of 
legislation, the sponsors should have 
no problem running it through the nor-
mal committee of jurisdiction process. 
In this case, apparently, it is with the 
Judiciary Committee, but I would 
think my committee would also have 
some pretty strong equities in this 
space, not to mention the fact that I 
have been working with my ranking 
member on precisely these types of 
issues. 
Instead of just trying to make a po-
litical point, what I have always tried 
to do is get a result and make law, but 
that has to go through a thoughtful 
process that uses the full committee 
process, which is not the case here. 
So I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, yes, 
I am trying to make a political point, 
and it should be a bipartisan political 
point. It should be Republicans and 
Democrats in the Senate, as there was 
a unanimous voice vote in the House of 
Representatives on that same measure, 
and I am sorry my colleague from Wis-
consin has left. 
The Senate’s version of this bill has 
been pending for 9 months—for 9 
months. The House has moved its 
version of it. It is a timely issue. Why 
waste a day in making America safer? 
Why not tell our law enforcement 
agencies: Now, roll up your sleeves. Go 
to work. Find the most dangerous 
things happening in this country, and 
stop them. 
We know one of them is White su-
premacists and their rightwing extre-
mism. The President fumbled and 
couldn’t come up with an answer 2 days 
ago. Today, sadly, from the Republican 
side, we get an objection to coming to-
gether on a bipartisan basis, as they 
did in the House, to address this very 
real issue. I am troubled by this. It is 
a sad moment. 
I do believe the Senator from Wis-
consin and many others will say they 
are against extremism. They had a 
chance to prove it by passing a meas-
ure here and refused. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alabama. 
Mr. JONES. Madam President, I am 
compelled to talk about this process 
that I just heard about. 
There is no process, folks. Let’s just 
be candid. This Senate is not the delib-
erative process body that the Senator 
from Wisconsin talked about. We don’t 
have that. This bill has been pending 
for 9 months. But we don’t have that. 
This is not the Senate in which I 
worked in 1979, where there was a de-
liberative attempt. There were debates 
on the floor, and there were debates in 
committee. This is not a process. 
Whether it is on the floor of this Sen-
ate or whether it is in the media or 
wherever else, when someone says that 
this should go through the normal 
process, those processes were killed a 
long time ago. I have been in this body 
for almost 3 years, and we have had 
only a relatively handful of amend-
ments on any bill that has come here. 
We have had virtually no markups and 
debates in committees. Those don’t 
exist. This bill has been pending for 9 
months, which is more than adequate 
time for the Homeland Security Com-
mittee to have taken a look at it, more 
than enough time for the Committee 
on the Judiciary to have taken a look 
at it, and more than enough time to 
have had a hearing on it. 
Apparently, our colleagues in the 
House felt it was OK, but this body has 
gotten to be so dysfunctional that, to 
send a statement, we will not allow a 
unanimously passed bill that has been 
pending in the Senate of the United 
States for 9 months to be passed. 
There is one thing with which I 
might disagree a little bit with Senator 
DURBIN. For me, this is not a political 
statement. This is a statement about 
law enforcement and increasing the 
ability of law enforcement. It is a 
statement to protect victims of crime. 
That is what this bill is about for me. 
I have seen it all too often in my State 
and throughout the South. Again, that 
unbroken string—that is what I see 
this bill as. 
So I don’t need lectures about proc-
ess when I see a Senate that does not 
function but that leapfrogs substantive 
legislation simply to ram a Supreme 
Court 
nominee 
through—one 
that 
hasn’t been pending for very long, ei-
ther. This is the kind of thing the Sen-
ate needs to be doing and passing, and 
we should be ashamed of ourselves for 
not doing it. Hopefully, that will 
change. 
I yield the floor. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader is recognized. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
before I get into the subject of this 
pending vote, I do want to thank my 
colleagues 
from 
Illinois 
and 
Con-
necticut for bringing this important 
topic before the Senate. 
President Trump’s refusal to con-
demn violent White supremacist groups 
in the Presidential debate has been 
around for several days. We have hard-
ly heard anything out of most of our 
colleagues, and no one—no one, no 
one—is going to buy the argument that 
it came too suddenly. White supremacy

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6014 
October 1, 2020 
hasn’t come too suddenly. The Presi-
dent’s remarks have been out there for 
several days. It is the flimsiest of ex-
cuses to avoid criticizing the President 
even when every American of de-
cency—the overwhelming majority of 
all Americans—would know he should 
be condemned. 
They don’t care if you are a Demo-
crat or a Republican or are liberal or 
conservative. You never know how low 
President Trump can go, but his re-
fusal to condemn White supremacy is 
among the lowest things he has done, 
and—boy, oh, boy—there are lots of 
them lined up. I am ashamed of my Re-
publican colleagues and ashamed—for 
America, for decency—that they have 
chosen to block this. 
S. 4653 
Madam President, now, on another 
issue of great importance to America, 
the nomination of Judge Amy Coney 
Barrett to the Supreme Court has 
thrust the issue of healthcare back 
into the spotlight. Her confirmation to 
the highest Court in the land could put 
healthcare for hundreds of millions of 
Americans at risk. 
As you would imagine, taking away 
healthcare is deeply unpopular with 
the American people. So it seems the 
strategy from the Republican majority 
is to invent some new distraction—a 
fresh outrage—to talk about. My col-
leagues on the other side would rather 
talk about anything besides the fact 
that their President, their party, and 
their Supreme Court nominee pose a 
dire threat to Americans’ healthcare. 
The outrage from the Republican 
leader was directed today, once again, 
at the idea that the Democrats would 
attack a nominee’s religious beliefs, 
but of course, in their zeal to manufac-
ture this issue, the Republican Sen-
ators began telegraphing this line of 
attack even before the nominee had 
been named. One Republican Senator 
wrote me a letter to warn against anti- 
Catholic attacks that hadn’t happened 
yet against a nominee who had not 
been named. That is how transparent 
this Republican diversion—ruse—is. 
It appears the Republican majority 
will crank up the outrage machine to 
any level of absurdity to avoid talking 
about 
America’s 
healthcare—the 
healthcare that so many Americans 
desperately want and need. In fact, all 
week, 
the 
Republican 
leader 
has 
mocked the idea that a far-right Su-
preme Court majority might strike 
down the Affordable Care Act and that 
Judge Barrett might play a decisive 
role. Of course, President Trump prom-
ised to nominate Supreme Court Jus-
tices who would terminate the Afford-
able Care Act, and he picked Judge 
Barrett. Those are the President’s 
words. He is only going to pick Jus-
tices who would terminate the Afford-
able Care Act, and it is no mystery why 
he picked Judge Barrett. 
In both major cases brought against 
the ACA, Judge Barrett twice sided 
against the law. She publicly criticized 
Justice Roberts for upholding the law 
and said that, if the Supreme Court 
were to read the statute the way she 
does, they would have to ‘‘invalidate 
it.’’ President Trump: ‘‘terminate it.’’ 
Judge Barrett: ‘‘invalidate it.’’ Guess 
what. President Trump and Republican 
attorneys general are in court right 
now, suing to do just that—invalidate 
our healthcare law in a case that will 
be heard 1 week after the election. 
The threat to Americans’ healthcare 
is very, very real, and Senate Repub-
licans are tying themselves in knots in 
trying to explain how it is not. Leader 
MCCONNELL, from the floor of the Sen-
ate, called it a joke—a joke—that 
Judge Barrett and the far-right major-
ity of the Court might vote to take 
away healthcare or to turn back the 
clock on women’s rights. 
Maybe he didn’t get that message 
around to his conference, because the 
Republican Senator from Utah, only a 
few days earlier, claimed that the Af-
fordable Care Act was unconstitutional 
and that striking it down shouldn’t 
tarnish Judge Barrett if that is what 
she chooses to do. 
Another Republican Senator said he 
wanted to see evidence that the nomi-
nee understood that Roe was wrongly 
decided, that Roe was an act of judicial 
imperialism, and I do believe Amy 
Coney Barrett’s record bears that out. 
That was his quote. 
The junior Senator from Missouri ex-
pressed confidence that Judge Barrett 
believes Roe v. Wade was wrongly de-
cided. On the Supreme Court, a Justice 
Barrett could enforce that view. 
So which is it, Republican leader? Is 
it absurd to think that Judge Barrett 
might strike down the Affordable Care 
Act, or is it a good thing that shouldn’t 
tarnish her reputation? 
Is it a joke that Judge Barrett could 
curtail women’s fundamental rights, or 
are Republican Senators relieved to 
think that she thinks Roe v. Wade is 
judicial imperialism? 
Americans are starting to get pretty 
sick of these double standards and 
mealy-mouthed talking points—pretty 
sick of politicians who, just 4 years 
ago, declared they couldn’t possibly 
confirm a Democratic nominee to the 
Supreme Court in the early months of 
an election year but are now rushing to 
confirm a Republican nominee in the 
middle of an election that is already 
underway. Most of all, pretty sick are 
Republicans claiming they support pro-
tections 
for 
Americans 
with 
pre-
existing conditions while, at the same 
time, they support a lawsuit that 
would eliminate them. 
Well, we are about to put a few of 
these 
Senate 
Republicans 
on 
the 
record. Soon, the Senate will vote on a 
bill that, if passed, would protect the 
healthcare of hundreds of millions of 
Americans and prevent efforts by the 
Department of Justice to advocate that 
courts strike down the Affordable Care 
Act. I was able to move this measure to 
the floor despite the fact that Repub-
licans didn’t want it, and now we will 
have a vote. 
Will Republican Senators vote to 
stop President Trump’s Justice Depart-
ment from spending taxpayer dollars 
trying to eliminate the taxpayers’ 
healthcare? We will see very shortly. 
If Senators truly want to support 
protections for Americans with pre-
existing conditions, they would vote to 
damage President Trump’s legal effort 
to eliminate them. It is as simple as 
that. 
No amount of sophistry or expla-
nation is needed. Yes or no? 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent that I be given a chance to fin-
ish my remarks in the next few min-
utes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you, Madam 
President. 
It is as simple as that. Are they with 
the people who want protection or not, 
or are they standing with President 
Trump, who wants to destroy it? It is 
that 
simple, 
because 
if 
President 
Trump and the Republican lawsuit are 
successful, 
every 
single 
American 
stands to lose vital healthcare protec-
tions or access to care. Millions of 
Americans would see drug costs sky-
rocket. Tens of millions of families 
would lose healthcare coverage during 
the worst health crisis in a century. 
More than 130 million Americans with 
preexisting conditions would lose vital 
protections, including every American 
who contracted COVID, which would be 
treated as a preexisting condition. 
Women would see their country hurtle 
backward to a time when they could be 
charged more than men for insurance 
simply because they are women. 
This vote, which I was fortunate 
enough to obtain, will show America 
which party stands with protecting 
Americans’ healthcare and protections 
for preexisting conditions and which 
party opposes it. 
It is plain and simple. Are you with 
Leader MCCONNELL, who wants to rip 
away people’s protections? Are you 
with President Trump, who wants to 
wound our American healthcare by 
eliminating ACA? Are you with the 
American people, who desperately need 
these protections? Are you with the 
mother or father whose son or daugh-
ter has cancer and the insurance com-
pany says ‘‘You are not getting any in-
surance,’’ or are you going to require 
that company to give them the insur-
ance that family so desperately needs? 
The eyes of America are on this body 
and on Republican Senators right now. 
Whose 
side 
are 
you 
on—President 
Trump’s or the American people who 
want healthcare? 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The senior assistant legislative clerk

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 4756 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want 
to talk just for a few moments about 
the internet and social media, and I 
want to make it clear, first, that I be-
lieve firmly in free will and responsi-
bility. I believe that no matter what 
kind of day you are having or what is 
going on in your life, that you are re-
sponsible for your actions. 
But I think we all know, as a matter 
of experience and common sense, that 
there are things in this world that can 
influence our actions. Social media, 
which I consider to be an American in-
vention, has many virtues and many 
advantages, and we know that. I think 
it has brought the world closer today. I 
think it has given many people a voice. 
I think it is an extraordinary source of 
knowledge. 
But like other innovations in this 
world, it has a downside. And one of 
those downsides is the fact that, too 
often, social media becomes an endless 
electronic 
brawl, 
and 
rather 
than 
bringing us together and exposing us to 
other points of view and causing us to 
test our assumptions against the argu-
ments of others, it brings us apart. I 
think social media is, in part, respon-
sible for that. 
We all know that many social media 
platforms 
are 
free. 
Let’s 
take 
Facebook, for example. Facebook is a 
free service. You open an account; you 
go on Facebook; and you can find out 
what your high school friends had for 
dinner Saturday night. Now, we give up 
a lot from that privilege of watching 
what our high school friends had for 
dinner Saturday night. Facebook col-
lects an enormous amount of informa-
tion about us. And, once again, I am 
not just picking on Facebook. I am 
using them as an example because it is 
such a popular platform that we all 
know about. Facebook uses that infor-
mation in a number of ways. 
First, Facebook uses it to make 
money. They know a lot of stuff about 
us from collecting information about 
us so they can sell advertisers’ ads, and 
they can tailor those ads to the indi-
viduals who are on Facebook according 
to the information that the social 
media 
platform—in 
this 
case, 
Facebook—has about them. You can 
even sell more ads if you can keep peo-
ple who are on Facebook coming back 
and coming back and coming back. 
So this is what happens. Some see 
this as a virtue, and some see it as a 
vice. A social media platform like 
Facebook gathers an enormous amount 
of information about us, and they 
learn, in intricate detail, what moti-
vates us and what our interests are. 
Another way of saying that would be 
they learn what our hot buttons are. 
And they continually show us—what is 
the word I am looking for—advertise-
ments, information, and postings of 
other people on Facebook that rein-
force our beliefs, and, in some cases, 
they show us very radical bits of infor-
mation that really push our hot but-
tons. 
Now, why do they do that? Well, No. 
1, it will keep us coming back to 
Facebook, and it will keep us on 
Facebook longer, which means that ad-
vertisers like us better because we are 
seeing their ads, and it means that 
Facebook can sell more ads at a higher 
price. I am not criticizing them. That 
is just the way the business works. 
But the downside of it is that we only 
see one point of view. Our point of view 
is reaffirmed. We never see other 
points of view. We are never encour-
aged to question our assumptions or to 
test our assumptions against the argu-
ments of others. 
Now, how does Facebook do this? 
And, again, I don’t mean to just pick 
on Facebook, but it is an example we 
are all aware of. They use algorithms. 
I am not going to try to explain algo-
rithms, but that is how they show us 
information that pushes our hot but-
tons. 
The social media platforms contend 
that they are not involved in content 
and that they are just publishers. So 
when somebody pushes your hot button 
and you get angry and you say some-
thing that you probably shouldn’t 
say—that is why Facebook has turned 
into an endless electronic brawl— 
Facebook says: Hey, it is not our fault. 
We are just a publisher. That is why, 
under the law, Facebook enjoys what 
we call section 230 liability. 
But as long as these algorithms are 
used to push our hot buttons, to reaf-
firm our points of view, to not show us

October 1, 2020 
other points of view—one point of view 
is that Facebook and other social 
media platforms are not just pub-
lishers. They are clearly content pro-
viders, and they are having an impact 
on our behavior. 
My bill is very simple. It just says 
that if you are a social media platform 
and you use algorithms based on the 
information you, the social media pro-
vider, have collected about us, if you 
use that information to push our hot 
buttons by continuously showing us in-
formation that just reaffirms our point 
of view without showing us other 
points of view, that is fine. That is per-
fectly legal. That is your business 
model. But in return, you are no longer 
going to enjoy section 230 liability. 
This would not eliminate section 230 
liability in a pervasive manner, but it 
would say that if you are going to use 
algorithms to push hot buttons and to 
keep other points of view away from us 
and monetize that practice, then you 
shouldn’t enjoy section 230 liability. 
That is all my bill does. 
For that reason, as if in legislative 
session, I ask unanimous consent that 
the Committee on Commerce be dis-
charged from further consideration of 
S. 4756, which is my Don’t Push My 
Buttons Act, to which I just referred, 
and the Senate proceed to its imme-
diate consideration. I further ask unan-
imous consent that the bill be consid-
ered read a third time and passed and 
that the motion to reconsider be con-
sidered made and laid upon the table, 
all in the vein of, we have talked now 
for years about section 230 liability, 
and I think we ought to actually try to 
do something about it. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. WYDEN. Reserving the right to 
object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, this bill 
is, on its surface, a privacy bill. It ap-
pears to have been introduced 2 days 
ago, and the sponsor has arrived on the 
floor of the Senate and says that this 
bill ought to be passed immediately 
and without debate. 
My guess is that a small circle of 
beltway insiders have seen the text, 
but I just want the Senator to know 
that passing this bill this way would 
just make a mockery of the proposition 
that we ought to have open, public de-
bate on significant laws. We are deal-
ing with a rush job here. 
I will just tell you that based on 
what we have picked up, the legislation 
certainly leaves more questions than 
answers. 
First, who does the Senator from 
Louisiana intend to target with the 
bill? On a first reading, it could apply 
to anybody, from Glassdoor, to Spotify, 
to Cloudflare, to my neighbor’s blog, to 
local media outlets. 
At a higher level, if my colleague 
wants to protect Americans’ data from 
collection and abuse, this bill certainly 
doesn’t do that. On the contrary, his 
legislation would push the platforms to 
simply force users to consent to their 
data being collected and used as a con-
dition of using their service. That is al-
ready being done now, and this bill 
wouldn’t change a thing for Americans’ 
privacy. 
Very significantly, our reading is 
that the Kennedy bill only requires 
consent if user data is both collected 
and used by the same company, and it 
has a massive loophole for data brokers 
and other shady middlemen who are al-
ready compiling dossiers of Americans’ 
sensitive data and selling it to just 
about anybody with a credit card. 
For the last several years, I have 
been blowing the whistle on these data 
brokers and these shady middlemen. 
We have investigated sector after sec-
tor where we are seeing these people 
who really adhere to some of the slea-
ziest business practices engaging in 
these tactics where they can get their 
hands on Americans’ sensitive data and 
basically just sell it to anybody with a 
credit card. 
I guarantee you, there is not a Sen-
ator in this body who is going to go 
home this weekend and tell their con-
stituents: Gee, I want those data bro-
kers and those middlemen to be able to 
sell my sensitive data to hither and 
yon, 
whatever 
nefarious 
purposes 
somebody might want to buy it for. 
The Facebooks, the Googles, and the 
Twitters of the world have all the re-
sources to pay these guys to outsource 
their data collection and be A-OK. Yet 
again, as I have said for some time, it 
is the startups and the little guys who 
are going to be left behind. 
I have been working on these issues 
since I came to the Senate, and the 
only person here, really, who knew how 
to use the computer was the wonderful 
Senator from Vermont, Senator LEAHY. 
So as we began to write these forma-
tive laws, I said that my interest is the 
startup and the little guy because the 
big guys always do great. 
That is why, when we were on the 
floor talking about the change to 230 
before, who sold out the little guys? 
Facebook. And all that happened was 
the bad guys went off to the dark web. 
So this is another bill where the 
Facebooks and the Googles all have the 
resources to pay the guys to outsource 
data collection, as I have been talking 
about, and the little guy is going to be 
left behind. 
This bill does not require consent to 
collect your data. It doesn’t require 
consent to use it and follow you around 
the internet. It wouldn’t stop Chinese 
companies from harvesting American 
data and selling it to the Chinese Gov-
ernment. 
If the Senator from Louisiana wants 
to protect Americans’ sensitive data, I 
have a bill for doing that. I have com-
prehensive privacy legislation. It is 
called the Mind Your Own Business 
Act. We have been soliciting input on 
it literally for years. It is the toughest 
bill in terms of holding the executives 
actually accountable, for example, if 
they lie about their privacy policy, if 
an executive of one of the major com-
panies, generating billions in revenue, 
lies about their privacy policy. 
The Mind Your Own Business Act is 
the bill that is the toughest in terms of 
protecting the consumer. It sets tough 
privacy and cyber security standards 
for companies that collect Americans’ 
private data, gives the Federal Trade 
Commission more authority to issue 
serious fines, and it is backed up with 
the strongest enforcement provisions 
on offer if a CEO lies to the govern-
ment. 
It is not as if you can’t write tough 
privacy proposals. It certainly can be 
done, and others have ideas on how to 
do it. But based on everything I have 
read, and particularly this provision 
that is going to be a holiday for data 
brokers and shady middlemen to be 
able to get people’s sensitive data, for 
all of those reasons and, frankly, oth-
ers that are too numerous to mention, 
I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Massachusetts. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—H.R. 451 
Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I rise 
today on behalf of the first responders 
in our country. Every day, brave 
women and men on the frontlines of 
the COVID–19 pandemic rely on T- 
Band, a spectrum that makes it pos-
sible for them to communicate with 
each other. 
T-Band is the radio frequency that is 
set aside for these public safety offi-
cials so that they can talk to each 
other to keep all of us safe, all of us 
healthy. In 11 metropolitan areas, the 
T-Band system enables our courageous 
public safety personnel to work quick-
ly and effectively during life-and-death 
situations. 
T-Band allows emergency medical 
service teams to relay important infor-
mation about patients’ conditions. T- 
Band permits 9–1–1 dispatchers to send 
first responders to emergency scenes. 
Firefighters use T-Band to quickly co-
ordinate strategy. 
After the Boston bombing, after the 
marathon bombing, first responders 
used T-Band to communicate with each 
other during the ensuing manhunt. 
This resource is nothing short of a 
lifesaver. T-Band really stands for 
‘‘trusted band.’’ It is the resource pub-
lic safety can rely upon. 
Unfortunately, the Middle Class Tax 
Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 re-
quired the Federal Communications 
Commission to begin to auction off the 
T-Band, the trusted band, by February 
of 2021, but it would cost between $5 
billion and $6 billion for first respond-
ers—police and fire—to relocate from 
the T-Band. That is much more money 
than an auction of that spectrum 
would ever generate. 
Plus, for many first responders, there 
is simply no alternative to the T-Band; 
this is their only option. That is why 
this body must pass the Don’t Break

Up the T-Band Act, which repeals the 
requirement that public safety stop 
using this spectrum. 
The heroes who jump into action 
when we need them shouldn’t have to 
scramble to figure out how they will 
communicate with each other. They 
shouldn’t be left in limbo. 
My legislation has support from an 
inspiring coalition of advocates and 
public safety groups. The International 
Association of Fire Chiefs, the Inter-
national Association of Chiefs of Po-
lice, the National Sheriffs’ Association, 
the National League of Cities, the 
United States Conference of Mayors, 
the National Association of Counties, 
the Association of Public-Safety Com-
munications Officials, the National 
Public 
Safety 
Telecommunications 
Council, and many others are demand-
ing that we preserve the T-Band. 
These groups and the people they 
represent are not asking for a favor; 
they are just asking to be allowed to do 
their jobs effectively. 
I thank Leader SCHUMER for his part-
nership on this issue and his long-
standing commitment to the public 
safety community. I also want to 
thank Ranking Member CANTWELL and 
Ranking Member SCHATZ
for their 
work and dedication to this effort. 
But don’t just take our word for it. 
Listen to what the current Republican 
chairman of the Federal Communica-
tions Commission recently said about 
T-Band. Earlier this year, Chairman 
Ajit Pai stated: ‘‘An FCC auction of 
the T-Band is a bad idea.’’ 
This is not a partisan issue. It is a 
public safety imperative. There is no 
cost associated with stopping the T- 
Band auction, and Congress must en-
sure that the people who step up to 
keep us safe are taken care of. 
If we fail to act, the FCC will have no 
choice but to move forward and strip 
this resource from our first responders. 
To allow that to happen during a pub-
lic health crisis like the one we face 
today would be reckless. 
First responders already face enor-
mous strain economically and enor-
mous pressure to address the pandemic, 
as well as deadly natural disasters 
across the country. The last thing we 
should be doing is saddling them with 
millions or billions of dollars in costs 
to needlessly alter their critical com-
munications system. 
Congress can no longer drag its feet. 
We have run out of time. The FCC has 
called on this body to stop the T-Band 
auction, but the Commission has no 
choice but to start laying the ground-
work to auction the T-Band. We can 
and we must resolve this problem 
today. Today is the day to do it. 
Mr. President, as in legislative ses-
sion, I ask unanimous consent that the 
Committee on Commerce, Science, and 
Transportation be discharged from fur-
ther consideration of H.R. 451 and that 
the Senate proceed to its immediate 
consideration. I further ask that the 
bill be read a third time and passed and 
that the motion to reconsider be con-
sidered made and laid upon the table 
with no intervening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Wyoming. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, re-
serving the right to object, I am here 
today to object to this unanimous con-
sent request on behalf of the junior 
Senator from Texas, Senator CRUZ. 
As the Senator from Massachusetts 
knows, Senator CRUZ is also deeply in-
terested in this issue. Both Senators 
have complementary pieces of legisla-
tion. They have had the language of 
their 
legislation 
agreed 
to 
unani-
mously by both the majority and the 
minority of the Commerce Committee. 
So I would ask the Senator from 
Massachusetts to reach out to the Sen-
ator from Texas, and I understand he is 
fully willing to work with the Senator 
from Massachusetts on amending the 
House bill to ensure that it passes the 
Senate with the Cruz amendment that 
would not be objectionable to sup-
porters of this bill. 
As a result, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I just 
think that we are missing an enormous 
opportunity here. It is a shame the 
Senate is not acting with the urgency 
it needs in order to help our brave men 
and women who are first responders in 
our country. 
We can work on issues of spectrum 
going to the private sector. We can do 
that in a separate bill, and we can do it 
together. But, here, we have an oppor-
tunity to help our first responders, the 
brave men and women who every day 
risk their lives, and we have to make 
sure they have the spectrum they need 
to communicate. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nebraska. 
Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
REMEMBERING LAURIE SMITH CAMP 
Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, less 
than 2 weeks ago, this country lost one 
of its most brilliant legal minds—Jus-
tice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Her passing 
has left a void that can be felt all 
across our Nation from Nebraska to 
Washington. 
Sadly, Nebraska recently lost an-
other great jurist—Judge Laurie Smith 
Camp. Judge Smith Camp was the first 
woman to serve my State as a Federal 
judge, a position she had held since 
2001. This body voted 100 to 0 to con-
firm her just 6 weeks after President 
George W. Bush nominated her. That 
doesn’t happen very often anymore, 
and her unanimous approval was a tes-
tament to her incredible talent. 
Judge 
Smith 
Camp 
grew 
up 
in 
Omaha, but she left Nebraska to attend 
college at Stanford University. She 
graduated with distinction. And I am 
glad to say that she came back home 
to attend the University of Nebraska 
Law School where she distinguished 
herself again as editor-in-chief of the 
Nebraska Law Review. 
Before becoming a Federal judge, she 
served her State through a series of 
jobs that spanned the legal profession. 
She began her career in private prac-
tice but soon moved on to become gen-
eral counsel for the Nebraska Depart-
ment of Correctional Services, the 
head of the Nebraska attorney gen-
eral’s civil rights section, and then the 
chief 
deputy 
attorney 
general 
for 
criminal matters for the Nebraska at-
torney general. These wide-ranging ex-
periences were part of what made her 
an exceptional Federal judge. 
Another part was her love for the law 
and the compassion that flowed from 
it. She was well known for her dedica-
tion to equal treatment for all, regard-
less of background, and for a sen-
tencing philosophy that preferred reha-
bilitation to punishment. 
She also understood that success 
isn’t just about achieving your profes-
sional goals. She was profoundly gen-
erous with her time and, when she 
wasn’t 
leading 
Nebraska’s 
district 
court, she could be found promoting 
women’s participation in the legal pro-
fession or mentoring young Nebraska 
attorneys. This was in addition to re-
cently being elected president of the 
Omaha Bar Association—a job that she 
had held since June. 
Laurie was also my friend. She spoke 
at an event I held in 2016 called Bridg-
ing the Gap, which aims to encourage 
women to engage in their communities 
at the local, State, and Federal level. I 
am lucky to have known her personally 
and to have seen up close the wise ad-
vice and the quick wit that made her 
famous among her colleagues and those 
she mentored. 
Through her example, she inspired a 
generation of young women in Ne-
braska and beyond to pursue careers as 
attorneys, advocates, and community 
leaders, just as Justice Ginsburg did. 
Both of these extraordinary women 
blazed a trail that today’s young 
women and girls can follow. I join with 
both their families in mourning their 
passing and celebrating their lives. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The senior assistant legislative clerk

ANNIVERSARY OF THE ROUTE 91 HARVEST 
FESTIVAL SHOOTING 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President,

up each day and feel the full force of it

October 1, 2020 
again. The shock, sorrow, and anger 
can hit us so strongly, it is hard to 
breathe, and that is the first part of 
mourning. 
Eventually, the darkest times in our 
lives start to feel more familiar. They 
still hurt as much as ever, but they 
don’t surprise us, and they become part 
of us. 
Three years ago tonight, bullets split 
the air at the Route 91 Harvest Music 
Festival in my hometown of Las Vegas, 
NV. They sounded like fireworks, like 
a celebration, but these were the first 
shots in the worst mass shooting in 
modern American history. 
Within minutes, those present at the 
outdoor festival understood at least 
some of what was happening. A gun-
man, high up in a hotel room, had 
taken aim at the people blow. Hun-
dreds of people were shot, and hundreds 
more wounded trying to get to safety. 
Fifty-eight people lost their lives that 
night and 2 more have passed from 
grievous wounds since. 
Within 
minutes, 
Nevadans 
began 
working together to save lives and help 
those in need. From those with years of 
training as first responders to just by-
standers whose only qualification to 
help was a car at the ready, Las Vegans 
pulled together. Nurses and doctors 
rushed to hospitals, and ordinary Ne-
vadans stood in line to give blood. Indi-
viduals and corporations donated their 
time and energy, as well as blankets, 
food, and other support. 
In the 3 years since, many all over 
the State of Nevada have worked to 
mark what happened through memo-
rial crosses, sculpture, a commemora-
tive community center, and many 
scholarships honoring the memory of 
those who lost their lives. 
Those 3 years have not erased the 
loss of the victims, the pain of the sur-
vivors, or the scars of the first respond-
ers who rushed into danger to save 
lives. If anything, the legacy of the 
Route 91 shooting has expanded during 
that time, not contracted. 
Like ripples on a pond, the impacts 
of this shooting linger. It affects dif-
ferent people in different ways. For 
many, fireworks on the Fourth of July 
are a reminder of what they went 
through that day. Geena Marano has 
learned to prepare herself for Independ-
ence Day and New Year’s Eve, but if a 
car backfires unexpectedly, she has to 
start the process of reminding herself: 
You are safe. It is OK. 
Her sister Marisa, who was also at 
the festival with her, says that her own 
daughter has picked up the habit of re-
acting to loud noises. She says: ‘‘It 
breaks my heart because my trauma 
has passed to her.’’ 
The fear resurfaces for these sisters 
in so many situations—on anniver-
saries, including of all the shootings 
since then; at high schools where 
Geena was doing outreach to students 
and feared that she was putting herself 
at risk of another shooting; passing the 
Strip, eerily empty during the pan-
demic like it was on the days after the 
festival; anywhere where there is dark-
ness and music, even on an evening 
out. 
The Marano sisters are not alone. 
While the tragedy of the Route 91 
shooting may be 3 years behind us, for 
many survivors, a moment can bring it 
all roaring back. This is one of the rea-
sons I am so committed to getting 
more funding and support for mental 
health and substance abuse treatment 
in this country. Just because you can’t 
see many of the scars from the Route 
91 festival, it doesn’t mean they are 
not there. That is true for mental 
health in general. So many Americans 
deal, on a daily basis, with challenges 
that even their closest loved ones can 
struggle to understand. 
Many first responders, for instance, 
carry the trauma they see at scenes of 
crime, disaster, and tragedy with them. 
I introduced legislation to provide con-
fidentiality to Federal law enforce-
ment who use peer counseling services 
and to track law enforcement suicides 
in order to develop more effective pre-
vention programs for our first respond-
ers. 
For everyone struggling with mental 
health concerns, peer support can be 
key, which is why I have introduced 
the Virtual Peer Support Act to help 
these key behavioral health programs 
move online to meet huge community 
needs during this pandemic because it 
really does take a community of sup-
port to help people through tough 
times. 
Treating the wounds, visible and in-
visible, from the Route 91 Harvest Fes-
tival shooting is only one part of what 
we owe the survivors. The other part is 
to take more action at the Federal 
level, to prevent attacks likes this in 
the first place, to reduce the gun vio-
lence that we have become far too ac-
customed to. 
Overwhelming majorities of Ameri-
cans want commonsense gun reform, 
including many responsible gun owners 
like those in my own family. We can do 
this here in Congress. Nevada has done 
it. At the State level, we have banned 
the bump stocks used in the Route 91 
shooting; we have closed the loophole 
that lets private sellers sell guns with-
out background checks. 
We can and should do all of these 
things at the Federal level. I have 
pushed for all of these things during 
my time here in the Senate because no 
family should have to go through what 
I saw that Monday night at the Reuni-
fication Center in Las Vegas when fam-
ilies were waiting to hear what hap-
pened to their loved ones the night be-
fore at that concert. No one should 
have to struggle for years with chronic 
pain, physical or mental, when we can 
take sensible measures to prevent it. 
To all of the families I met who have 
been touched by this tragedy and for 
the hundreds more that I have spoken 
with, I want you to know that Nevad-
ans haven’t forgotten you. We are all 
still Vegas Strong. We are all still here 
with you. We are still working together 
to get you what you need in the wake 
of a tragedy whose impact has not 
faded over time; it has just changed 
and shifted. 
Tonight, at home, let us all remem-
ber those who felt the impact of the 
Route 91 shooting, from survivors, to 
families, to firefighters, nurses, and 
volunteers. Let us move toward an 
America that protects its communities 
from violence and that helps those who 
lived through it heal. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nevada. 
Ms. ROSEN. Mr. President, 3 years 
ago on this very date, in my hometown 
of Las Vegas, a gunman opened fire 
from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay 
Bay Hotel onto the unsuspecting crowd 
below. This horrific attack lasted just 
over 10 minutes, but in that brief win-
dow of time, 58 innocent lives were 
taken and over 400 were injured. It was 
the worst mass shooting in American 
history. I stand here today to recognize 
the third anniversary of this act of ter-
ror. 
I want to speak today about how that 
October 1 shooting changed Nevada. 
This mass shooting irrevocably altered 
the lives of countless families in Las 
Vegas, NV, and across the country for-
ever. 
Many of that night’s victims are still 
dealing with the injuries, visible and 
not visible. Many are still grieving and 
working through the effects of this 
devastating trauma. All of them have 
suffered through a pain that no family, 
no friend, no spouse, no child should 
ever, ever have to endure. 
In the 3 years since the shooting, two 
more victims have passed away due to 
injuries they sustained that night—1 in 
2019 and 1 earlier this year—bringing 
the number of lives lost up to 60—sons, 
daughters, parents, friends, neighbors— 
people who were loved, people who were 
part of our community, people who 
were taken from us far too soon, 60 
families who will forever have an 
empty chair at their Thanksgiving 
table. 
Amidst the violence and the terror, 
there were also heroes who made the 
choice to run toward danger and help 
others, like the courageous first re-
sponders who risked their lives to pro-
vide aid and everyday citizens who 
helped others escape in their cars. 
Nevada remembers October 1 because 
it showed us the darkest side of hu-
manity, but in the aftermath, it also 
showed us the brightest and best of 
who we are. 
Today we commemorate the 60 lives 
that were lost. Today we recognize 
those who were injured and are still 
struggling. Today we celebrate. We cel-
ebrate the heroism of our community— 
not just in the immediate aftermath of 
that attack but in the days, weeks, 
months, and years since. We saw heroes 
spring into action that night and the 
following days to save lives. In the fol-
lowing days, we saw so many members 
of our community display incredible

heroism. Our community lined up to 
donate blood. They helped to reunite 
friends and family in the aftermath, 
and they helped to financially support 
victims and their families. 
The phrase ‘‘Vegas Strong’’ came 
into being after that time, and let me 
assure you, it is a phrase that could 
not be more true. The strength of our 
city is simply astounding. We work to 
build ourselves back up from crisis, 
side by side, arm in arm. It has taken 
time. It hasn’t been easy. Even now, we 
are still not all the way there, but 
every day, the people of Las Vegas 
show unparalleled resilience. Nevadans 
carried that resilience with them. They 
carry it in every challenge and in every 
crisis that we face. 
I stand here today to honor the men 
and women who lost their lives on Oc-
tober 1, those who were injured in the 
attack, and the heroes who helped 
bring our city back. 
I also call on Congress to show the 
same kind of strength that the people 
of Las Vegas have shown. Our Nation 
currently faces many challenges. How-
ever, my colleagues must recognize the 
threat that gun violence poses to our 
communities. 
We 
must 
honor 
the 
memories of those who were lost. We 
must take commonsense action to re-
duce gun violence and ensure that 
more lives aren’t lost. 
As a legislative body, we must act. 
The Bipartisan Background Checks 
Act—a bill passed by the House 582 
days ago—has been waiting for a vote 
here in the Senate. Today, in honor of 
the memories of the lives that were 
lost, I request that the Senate bring 
this bill, this important bill, for a vote. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF AMY CONEY BARRETT 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, yester-
day I had the pleasure of meeting—or 
should I say re-meeting—Judge Amy 
Coney Barrett, who has been nomi-
nated, as we all know, to the U.S. Su-
preme Court, to the vacancy left by the 
death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. 
Over 
the 
last 
few 
days, 
Judge 
Barrett’s nomination has been ap-
plauded by people across the political 
spectrum—and for good reason. Her 
background in practicing law and aca-
demia and on the Federal bench has 
provided her with an unquestionable 
knowledge of the law. Much of the 
praise has come from her colleagues 
who worked closely with her over the 
years. 
Marcus Cole, who is dean of the Uni-
versity of Notre Dame Law School, 
where she teaches, said: 
Judge Amy Coney Barrett is an absolutely 
brilliant legal scholar and jurist. She is also 
one of the most popular teachers we have 
ever had here at Notre Dame Law School. 
A group of her former students have 
published a piece recently that said: 
While we hold a variety of views regarding 
how best to interpret statutes in the Con-
stitution, we all agree on this: The nation 
could not ask for a more qualified candidate 
than the professor we have come to know 
and revere. 
We have also seen support for Judge 
Barrett from unlikely sources. Harvard 
University Law Professor Noah Feld-
man clerked with Judge Barrett at the 
Supreme Court more than 20 years ago. 
He was also a prominent witness for 
Democrats during the impeachment 
process earlier this year. But he has 
written an opinion piece titled ‘‘Amy 
Coney Barrett Deserves to Be on the 
Supreme Court.’’ He wrote that he 
knows her to be a ‘‘brilliant and con-
scientious lawyer who will analyze and 
decide cases in good faith, applying the 
jurisprudential principles to which she 
is committed. Those are the basic cri-
teria for being a good justice. Barrett 
meets them and exceeds them.’’ 
There is really no question that 
Judge Barrett has a brilliant legal 
mind and deep respect for the Constitu-
tion and an unwavering commitment 
to the law, but these qualities alone 
are not what set this exceptional judge 
apart. Both Republicans and Demo-
crats who have worked with Judge Bar-
rett throughout her career have spoken 
about her personal qualities, like hu-
mility and integrity. These make her 
an ideal candidate for this influential 
position. 
A group of her former students wrote 
about the kindness that she has shown 
to them, both in the classroom and 
during meals they shared at her home. 
They said: 
Her genuine interest in the personal lives 
of her students outside the classroom, and 
the seamless way that she modeled for all of 
us the integration of her professional and 
family life, reinforces that there is more to 
life than the pursuit of professional acco-
lades. 
She has certainly proven that to be 
the case. In addition to rising to the 
very top of her field, Judge Barrett is a 
mother of seven children ranging from 
the age of 8 to 19. Following her nomi-
nation on Saturday, Judge Barrett 
credited her family’s ability to balance 
her and her husband’s successful ca-
reers with the needs of their children 
to the unwavering support of her hus-
band Jesse, who is also an accom-
plished attorney. 
In every respect, Judge Barrett is an 
inspiring role model for young people 
and I could say as the father of two 
daughters, of young women in par-
ticular, who are pursuing their profes-
sional and personal ambitions with 
equal vigor. 
If confirmed, Judge Barrett—soon-to- 
be Justice Barrett—would become the 
first mother of school-age children to 
serve as a Justice and only the fifth 
woman throughout American history 
to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court. 
Considering the woman whose seat she 
will fill if confirmed, the significance 
of that fact cannot be overstated. 
She would be the only current Jus-
tice with a degree from a law school 
other than Harvard or Yale and bring 
much needed educational diversity to 
the Bench. 
I have always thought it bizarre that, 
among all the highly qualified lawyers 
and judges in America, for some rea-
son, it is overly populated with people 
educated in the Northeast, on the 
coast. 
On top of that, she would join Justice 
Thomas as the only Justice born in the 
South and bring another perspective to 
the Court, whose members largely hail 
from the coast. 
If confirmed, Judge Barrett would 
bring an underrepresented view to the 
Supreme Court. I know we would all be 
proud to have somebody like her—a 
woman of such strong character—serv-
ing our Nation in this very important 
capacity. 
I want to commend President Trump 
for selecting this outstanding nominee. 
I was glad to spend some time with her 
yesterday. She has an unquestionable 
character, a brilliant mind, and the 
kind of temperament needed to serve 
on the Court. I am eager for the Amer-
ican people to see that for themselves 
as we begin the public confirmation 
process. 
As we know, this is the second time 
Judge Barrett has appeared before the 
Judiciary Committee in the last few 
years. It was 3 years ago when the com-
mittee and the Senate confirmed her to 
her current position on the Seventh 
Circuit Court of Appeals. However, 
there were some warning flags. 
During 
her 
confirmation 
hearing 
back then, 3 years ago, the Democrats 
on the committee raised questions over 
Judge Barrett’s strong Catholic faith 
and questioned whether it would some-
how disqualify her or impair her abil-
ity to discharge her responsibilities. 
One Senator went so far as to say: 
‘‘The dogma lives loudly within you, 
and that’s of concern.’’ Another asked 
her whether she was an ‘‘orthodox 
Catholic.’’ Well, this statement and 
that insinuation were discriminatory 
at best and unconstitutional at worst. 
The Constitution itself includes that 
there is no religious test. Article VI 
reads: ‘‘No religious Test shall ever be 
required as a Qualification to any Of-
fice or public Trust under the United 
States.’’ 
This is not the first time somebody 
has been targeted for one’s Catholic 
faith. I was reminded of the speech 
that John Fitzgerald Kennedy gave in 
1960 in Houston, TX, to the Greater 
Houston Ministerial Association. In ad-
dressing some of the explicit and im-
plicit arguments that somehow he 
would be beholden to the Vatican rath-
er than be able to discharge his respon-
sibilities as President of the United 
States, he pointed out, as a Catholic, it 
was not the only concern because, if 
people would do that to a Catholic, 
why not do it to a Baptist or a Muslim 
or a Jew?

S6020 
October 1, 2020 
He said: 
For while this year it may be a Catholic 
against whom the finger of suspicion is 
pointed, in other years it has been, and may 
someday be again, a Jew—or a Quaker or a 
Unitarian or a Baptist. It was Virginia’s har-
assment of Baptist preachers, for example, 
that helped lead to Jefferson’s statute of re-
ligious freedom. Today I may be the victim, 
but tomorrow it may be you—until the 
whole fabric of our harmonious society is 
ripped at a time of great national peril. 
He made the important point that 
seems so obvious that he shouldn’t 
have had to make. 
He said: 
I am not the Catholic candidate for presi-
dent. I am the Democratic Party’s candidate 
for president, who happens also to be a 
Catholic. 
Finally, he said: 
But if this election is decided on the basis 
that 40 million Americans lost their chance 
of being president on the day they were bap-
tized, then it is the whole nation that will be 
the loser—in the eyes of Catholics and non- 
Catholics around the world, in the eyes of 
history, and in the eyes of our own people. 
Throughout her career, Judge Bar-
rett has impressed the brightest legal 
minds with her deep understanding of 
the law and commitment to judicial 
independence. She made it clear at her 
hearing 3 years ago that she would be 
loyal to her oath, and that is to uphold 
and defend the Constitution and laws 
of the United States. 
It is clear, under the appropriate can-
ons of judicial ethics, that if for some 
reason a judge can’t apply the law be-
cause of some personal opinion or con-
viction, then one needs to disqualify 
oneself. President Kennedy said that, if 
it violates your conscience and your 
faith and you can’t reconcile the two, 
you should resign. 
Well, there is just no legitimate rea-
son 
to 
question 
whether 
Judge 
Barrett’s religious beliefs would make 
her unfit to serve on the Supreme 
Court, and I hope our colleagues on the 
other side will refrain from, once 
again, imposing a religious test on 
Judge Barrett as we consider her nomi-
nation. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. President, on another matter, 
with the school year well underway, I, 
like, I am sure, many of my colleagues, 
am continuing to listen to and learn 
from our teachers and administrators 
about how this unprecedented school 
year is unfolding. Whether kicking off 
the year in person or online or with 
some hybrid model, educators are fac-
ing a whole new range of challenges 
that have made the past several weeks 
anything but ordinary. 
Over August, I spent some time talk-
ing to kindergarten through 12th grade 
teachers and students to learn how 
they were preparing to overcome the 
hurdles brought on by this pandemic. I 
also visited our colleges and univer-
sities to see how they were handling 
the start of the new year, and since 
then, I have stayed in close contact 
with all of them to learn more about 
how it is proceeding. 
Our college campuses, for example, in 
most cases, are home to more than just 
classrooms and libraries. They are 
whole communities unto themselves 
with student housing, offices, dining 
facilities, gyms, convenience stores, 
and with, in some cases, full-service 
utility companies. 
Lee Tyner, who serves as general 
counsel for Texas Christian University 
in Fort Worth, testified before the Ju-
diciary Committee earlier this year 
and compared running a campus to 
leading a small city. You have a vast 
set of responsibilities that extend far 
beyond the education you are providing 
to your students, and those responsibil-
ities have only grown more challenging 
during the pandemic. 
Back in July, I spoke with some of 
the chancellors of our public colleges 
and universities to learn more about 
how they were preparing to deal with 
the immense challenges higher edu-
cation was facing, and last Friday, I 
was able to catch up and see how 
things had gone—whether they had 
gone according to plan or whether they 
had encountered problems they had not 
been able to anticipate. 
I learned about the University of 
Texas System’s comprehensive plan to 
keep students and staff safe at each of 
their campuses across the State, which 
involves a serious testing infrastruc-
ture. Four institutions have built labs 
on their own campuses to conduct the 
testing that is necessary, and each has 
the capacity to test between 500 and 
2,000 people each day. Other campuses 
are partnering with the UT Health 
Science Center institutions for their 
own testing, and these are providing a 
no-out-of-pocket cost testing oppor-
tunity for students, faculty, and staff. 
The University of North Texas Sys-
tem has reopened campuses with a mix 
of in-person, online, and hybrid in-
struction, and it has been very effec-
tive at stopping the transmission of 
the virus. If a student or any close rel-
ative tests positive, there are clear 
guidelines for isolating and then con-
tact tracing to minimize the spread. 
When I spoke last week with the 
chancellors, UNT had only 27 active 
cases on campus, and it has seen no 
evidence of COVID–19 transmission in 
the classrooms or buildings where they 
conduct face-to-face activities. 
This is the trend most campuses are 
seeing. There is a low to zero trans-
mission rate in classrooms, thanks to 
these 
preparations 
and 
these 
pre-
cautions. The biggest risk to students, 
staff, and the surrounding communities 
actually comes from off-campus activi-
ties or people who bring it onto the 
campus who are not part of that stu-
dent body or administration. 
In Texas and States across the coun-
try, we have seen news articles about 
how off-campus parties and gatherings 
have been linked to clusters of these 
new cases. Appropriately, the univer-
sities have cracked down on these cam-
pus groups or individuals hosting those 
events, and they are trying to do what 
they can to identify them and then 
stop the spread. 
John Sharp, who is the chancellor of 
the Texas A&M University System, 
talked about one unconventional way 
that A&M is trying to pinpoint poten-
tial outbreaks as soon as possible. 
A&M has adopted the practice of 
wastewater surveillance, which has 
been used for years as a way to detect 
viruses or diseases within a commu-
nity. Now it is being used to find the 
source of individual COVID–19 cases or 
clusters of cases in student housing, 
particularly dormitories. The univer-
sity takes wastewater samples from 
sewage systems on campus, and a posi-
tive test allows them to then go back 
and target individuals for testing. 
Obviously, if there is no virus de-
tected, they know there is no need for 
that conditional testing, at least at 
this time. This practice can help to de-
tect an outbreak at a dorm that can 
otherwise go unnoticed for several days 
and, thus, be spread far and wide. 
Our colleges and universities across 
the State have gone to great lengths to 
manage the crisis that did not come 
with a manual. They have implemented 
the best practices to protect the health 
and safety of students and staff mem-
bers and to ensure that their students 
have access to a quality education, 
which is the very purpose for which 
they exist. 
In our conversation last week, these 
chancellors told me how helpful the 
CARES Act funding has been over the 
last several months, and they reiter-
ated that they need more help. They 
need Congress to come together and 
provide more help. It is not just col-
leges and universities. It is also our el-
ementary, middle, and high schools. 
Congress has already provided more 
than $30 billion in emergency relief for 
education, including $2.6 billion in 
Texas alone. This funding has gone a 
long way to prepare for this school 
year and to allow these leaders to man-
age the risks associated with the 
spread of the virus. 
They say they need more help, and it 
is incredibly frustrating that, despite 
this being a bipartisan goal and some-
thing we were able to do together in 
four separate bills, we have now been 
unable to pass another relief bill to 
give our schools and our children the 
resources they need in order to be safe. 
You would think this would be a pri-
ority. 
The two House proposals we have 
seen—one of which passed the House 
earlier this year and the other of which 
was introduced last week—did include 
additional funding for education, and a 
bill we proposed over the summer in-
cluded another $105 billion for edu-
cation—more than tripling the invest-
ment that has already been made in 
the CARES Act. 
History has proven that legislation 
gets harder to do the closer we get to 
an election, and perhaps nothing is bet-
ter evidence of that than where we find

tional help should transcend those par-
tisan differences. 
I spoke to Secretary Mnuchin less 
than an hour ago, and he continues 
talking to Speaker PELOSI, but at some 
point, while talking is good—it is bet-
ter than not talking—sometimes it is 
important not just to talk but to actu-
ally do something. In this case, that 
would mean the House and the Senate 
working with the President to agree on 
another bill. So I hope we are at a 
point at which we can see some relief 
soon. 
I am thinking about the airline in-
dustry and the tens of thousands of air-
line employees who are being fur-
loughed, 
actually, 
starting 
today. 
American Airlines and Southwest Air-
lines are headquartered in my State. I 
know, through no fault of their own, 
the airlines are struggling. We have 
tried to help them, and we have helped 
them, but we need to help the airlines’ 
employees by providing them with 
more 
assistance 
during 
this 
chal-
lenging time. We can do that if we 
would get off of dead center and work 
out some mutually agreeable com-
promise. 
Nobody is going to get everything 
one wants. It is not the nature of life or 
the nature of this business, but the 
American people are depending on us

was comforting to have this sermon to

There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From the Jerusalem Post, Sept. 24, 2020] 
THE ECHOES OF YOM KIPPUR 
(By Rabbi Michael M. Cohen) 
When the gates of heaven close during the 
Ne’ila service of Yom Kippur, many of us put 
the avodah, the work, of Yom Kippur behind 
us. But that is an illusion. As the expression 
goes, when one door closes, another opens. 
Commentating on the Kol Nidre service at 
the beginning of Yom Kippur, when the gates 
are open wide, Rabbi Max Arzt teaches the 
goal of Yom Kippur is, ‘‘to lessen the dis-
tance between what we are and what we 
ought to be.’’ 
If the long day of introspection has 
worked, then at Ne’ila those gates close on 
who we were and open to a lighter, better 
and more refined version of who we are. 
But that too is an illusion. It is a fleeting 
moment of personal triumph. Like the sun-
set that gives way to the night, the dawn to 
the morning, the moon and its phases, the 
high tide and the low tide; stasis is not 
derech haolam, the way of the world. 
Each morning the siddur, the prayer book, 
reminds us, ‘‘Day after day You renew cre-
ation.’’ In that unfolding story we are, truth 
be told, composed of stardust. Most of the 
elements of our bodies originated in stars 
and the Big Bang. 
Like the rest of the universe, our course is 
one of continual renewal. Yom Kippur high-
lights that awareness and the work we began 
on Rosh Hodesh Elul, the beginning of the 
month of Elul, 40 days earlier. Our work 
reaches a higher level on Rosh Hashanah and 
the Ten Days of Repentance, aseret yomei 
teshuva, culminating with Yom Kippur. 
Those 40 days parallel the period when 
Moses returned to Mount Sinai to receive 
the second set of tablets following the inci-
dent of the Golden Calf. Moses, Moshe 
rabbeinu, Moses our teacher, literally mod-
els teshuva, repentance, return, when after 
the first tablets lay shattered at his feet he 
turned around and returned to once again 
climb Mount Sinai. 
We are no different, as the echo of Yom 
Kippur is always with us, pushing us to 
climb the mountain all year long. Yom 
Kippur Katan, the small Yom Kippur, ob-
served by some in most months on the day 
preceding Rosh Hodesh, is one of those 
echoes. It includes a daylight-hours’ fast and 
special liturgy. 
Rabbi Shefa Gold elucidates the origins of 
Yom Kippur Katan, teaching, ‘‘Kabbalists 
were moon watchers. The lenses through 
which they gazed were intensely focused on 
issues of exile and redemption. And so as the 
moon waned, the exile of the Shechina (the 
Divine Presence) was noted and mourned. 
With the moon’s return came the celebra-
tion of the miracle of redemption, a redemp-
tion that could be tasted and known but 
briefly before the cycle of exile continued. 
They based their custom on a legend that 
was recorded in the Babylonian Talmud in 
which God says to Israel, ‘‘Bring atonement 
upon me for making the moon smaller.’’ 
(Hullin 60b) THAT EPISODE in the Talmud 
is fascinating in and of itself. There God ad-
mits after God made the moon smaller than 
the sun that God had wronged the moon, and 
because of that God needed to do teshuva! 
Implied within that radical text: If God can 
admit to wrongdoing and address trans-
gression, who are we not to? 
In addition to Yom Kippur Katan, another 
echo of Yom Kippur is the sixth paragraph of 
the weekday Amidah prayer. There we say 
the confessional selach lanu, forgive us, in 
the same manner that we say the confes-
sional prayers ashamnu and al chet of Yom 
Kippur. Interspersed within the al chet Yom 
Kippur liturgy itself we also say selach lanu 
as we do during the rest of the year: ‘‘Ve’al 
kulam eloha selichot selach lanu. Mechal 
lanu. Kaper lanu,’’ And for them all, God of 
forgiveness, please forgive, pardon us, help 
us atone.’’ The selach lanu paragraph follows 
the fourth and fifth paragraphs of the 
Amidah. We first ask for binah, under-
standing, including self-understanding, so we 
can ask in the next prayer for help with 
teshuvah, repentance. There is a logic within 
the order of the Amidah: first self-under-
standing followed by repentance, and only 
then forgiveness. 
Three times a day the weekday Amidah is 
said. This means three times a day—evening, 
morning, and afternoon—we ask for forgive-
ness. In Judaism there is the concept of not 
saying a bracha levatala, a blessing whose 
purpose is not going to be fulfilled. This 
means that when we ask for forgiveness 
throughout the day there is the implied un-
derstanding, since we can’t say the bracha in 
vain, that we did something wrong in the 
morning, afternoon and evening. 
For some this is proof Judaism is a reli-
gion of guilt. Rabbi Art Green teaches the 
opposite when he says that Judaism is actu-
ally about guilt relief. This system provides 
us precious moments throughout the day to 
check in with ourselves and recalibrate as 
needed. 
Elaborating, Rabbi Daniel Kamesar, z’’l (of 
blessed memory), looks to the past daily sac-
rificial system of the Temple in Jerusalem 
as a model for that guilt relief when we 
would bring a chatat or an asham offering as 
expiation for our wrong choices, for missing 
the mark. Watching the smoke rise heavenly 
could be a cathartic, like watching the 
breadcrumbs of the Tashlich service float 
downstream away from us. 
‘‘Burn it up and let it go,’’ Daniel points 
out. ‘‘Most therapists are trying desperately 
to help us achieve that.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6022 
October 1, 2020 
While we are talking about the echoes of 
Yom Kippur throughout the year, we also 
note on Yom Kippur itself we have echoes of 
the Temple service. The chatat offering be-
came the al chet prayer, and the asham of-
fering became the ashamnu of the Yom 
Kippur liturgy. 
One of the most profound moments in our 
daily prayer life emanates from the Ne’ila 
service. The Talmud (Yoma 87b) discusses 
the wording for the service. Shmuel and Ulla 
bar Rav suggest we say, ‘‘What are we? What 
is our life? What is our kindness? What is our 
righteousness? What is our salvation? What 
is our power? What is our might?’’ THOSE 
QUESTIONS eventually migrated into the 
daily morning prayers of the siddur. In the 
context of the Talmud and the siddur they 
are traditionally understood as questions 
arising from a sense of ‘‘our iniquities too 
many to count,’’ as Rav Judah states. 
However, they can also be read as seven ex-
istential questions addressing the essence of 
our lives. We start by asking, ‘‘What are 
we?’’ The ultimate question, but in some 
ways too immense to answer, and so we fine 
tune and arrive at, ‘‘What is our life?’’ That 
is to say, what do we do with our lives, this 
precious gift? We want to define who we are. 
To answer that question, we realize our lives 
are measured by how we treat others, and so 
we ask, ‘‘What is our kindness?’’ and ‘‘What 
is our righteousness?’’ In other words, what 
care and consideration do we bring to others, 
and in a broader social reach, how do we 
strengthen justice in our communities and 
the world? 
Our lives are also measured and grounded 
by our inner spiritual lives, and so we ask, 
‘‘What is our salvation?’’ Answering and liv-
ing by the answers to these questions takes 
energy, and so we conclude by asking, ‘‘What 
is our power? What is our might?’’ 
While they are the final questions, they 
are both cautionary, giving us pause to 
think how we use our strength and efficacy 
while at the same time reminding us that we 
have agency. 
There is another lesson with these ques-
tions. Only the first two actually appear in 
the Talmud. As the scholar of Jewish liturgy 
Lawrence Hoffman points out, ‘‘Frequently, 
prayers were ad libbed. They began with a 
starting point, like Mah anu? Mah chayeinu? 
What are we? What is our life? But they then 
moved in whatever direction the prayer lead-
er preferred. It could be made up on the spot. 
What was done one year would not have been 
the same as in later years. There were no 
‘‘right’’ and ‘‘wrong’’ as we think of them. 
‘‘Right’’ was just making up the prayer 
and delivering it on the proper theme, with, 
ideally, some biblical texts to support the 
idea. Congregants would recognize the bib-
lical support and nod in recognition. So the 
Talmudic writer of this section might have 
had his own practice in mind, or no practice 
in mind at all, other than the idea that we 
start with the citation in question, and then 
develop the theme in a way that makes sense 
at the time. 
Such a process invites us to go deeper than 
the printed words on the page of the siddur. 
It asks us to drink from the essence of its 
message. What a liberating, creative, em-
powering approach; an approach with im-
mense responsibility as well. 
Ne’ila metaphorically suggests the gates of 
heaven close at the end of Yom Kippur, while 
at the same time we remember those daily 
Yom Kippur touch points and messages 
throughout 
the 
year. 
They 
remind 
us 
throughout the year that we always have the 
gift and opportunity to improve who we are, 
as well as to repair our shared world.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION 
Egypt—Maritime Domain Awareness System 
The Government of Egypt has requested a 
possible sale of a Maritime Domain Aware-
ness (MDA) system that includes multi-site 
Acquisition Radars (fixed and mobile) with 
supporting facilities, Electro-Optical/Infra-
red Sensors (fixed, mobile, airborne), Radio 
Communications suites, Hybrid Power Gen-
eration Systems, Closed Circuit Television, 
Power and Data Distribution Units, Auto-
matic Identification System, and various 
other surveillance and communications sys-
tems; 
and 
other 
related 
elements 
of 
logistical and program support. Equipment 
includes: thirty-four (34) Integrated Fixed 
Towers with supporting equipment; twenty- 
eight (28) Communication Towers with sup-
porting equipment; twelve (12) Relay Towers 
with supporting equipment; six (6) Naval 
Base Operations Rooms, two (2) regional Op-
erations Centers, and one (1) Strategic Oper-
ation Center all with supporting equipment; 
six (6) Harbor Protection Systems with sup-
porting equipment; Intelligent Fiber Intru-
sion Detection System; twelve (12) Vertical 
Take Off and Landing UAV with six (6) 
Ground Stations; fourteen (14) Mobile Mari-
time Surveillance Vehicles; and, three (3) 
Aerostat ISR Integrated Platform with sup-
porting equipment. The estimated total pro-
gram cost is $417 million. 
This proposed sale will support the foreign 
policy and national security of the United 
States by helping to improve the security of 
a Major Non-NATO Ally country that con-
tinues to be an important strategic partner 
in the Middle East. 
Egypt intends to use this Maritime Do-
main Awareness system to provide the Egyp-
tian Armed Forces with a maritime surveil-
lance capability with real-time situational 
awareness in the defense of Egypt maritime 
boundary, natural resources, and ports. 
Egypt will have no difficulty absorbing this 
equipment into its armed forces. 
The proposed sale of this equipment and 
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region. 
The prime contractor will be the Advanced 
Technology 
Systems 
Company 
(ATSC), 
McLean, VA. There are no known offset 
agreements proposed in connection with this 
potential sale. 
Implementation of this proposed sale will 
require annual trips to Egypt involving U.S. 
Government and contractor representatives 
for technical reviews, support, and oversight 
for approximately five years. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION 
Korea—AIM–9X Block II Tactical Sidewinder 
Missiles 
The Republic of Korea has requested to 
buy one hundred fifteen (115) AIM–9X Block 
II Tactical Sidewinder missiles; fifty (50) 
AIM–9X Block II Captive Air Training Mis-
siles (CATM): twenty (20) AIM–9X Block II 
Tactical Missile Guidance Units; and twenty 
(20) AIM–9X Block II CATM Guidance Units. 
Also included are containers, weapon system 
support, software, surface transportation, 
missile technical assistance, and other tech-
nical assistance: and other related elements 
of program support. The estimated total cost 
is $158.1 million. 
This proposed sale will support the foreign 
policy goals and national security objectives 
of the United States by helping to improve 
the security of a treaty ally that continues 
to be an important force for political sta-
bility, peace, and economic progress in North 
East Asia. 
The proposed sale will assist the Republic 
of Korea in developing and maintaining a 
strong and ready self-defense capability. The 
Republic of Korea will have no difficulty ab-
sorbing these missiles into its armed forces. 
The proposed sale of this equipment and 
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region. 
The principal contractor will be Raytheon 
Corporation, Tucson, AZ. There are no 
known offset agreements proposed in connec-
tion with this potential sale. 
Implementation of this proposed sale will 
not require the assignment of any additional 
U.S. Government or contractor representa-
tives to the Republic of Korea. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale. 
TRANSMITTAL NO. 20–60

Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b)(1) of the 
Arms Export Control Act 
Annex Item No. vii 
(vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 
1. The AIM–9X Block II SIDEWINDER Mis-
sile is a short-range, air-to-air missile. The 
AIM–9X Block II SIDEWINDER Missile pro-
vides a high off-boresight seeker, enhanced 
countermeasure rejection capability, low 
drag/high angle of attack airframe and the 
ability to integrate the Helmet Mounted 
Cueing System. The software algorithms are 
the most sensitive portion of the AIM–9X 
missile. The software continues to be modi-
fied via a pre-planned product improvement 
(P3I) program in order to improve its 
counter-countermeasure 
capabilities. 
No 
software source code or algorithms will be 
released. 
2. The highest level of classification of de-
fense articles, components, and services in-
cluded in this potential sale is SECRET. 
3. If a technologically advanced adversary 
were to obtain knowledge of the specific 
hardware and software elements, the infor-
mation could be used to develop counter-
measures that might reduce weapon system 
effectiveness or be used in the development 
of a system with similar or advanced capa-
bilities. 
4. A determination has been made that the 
Republic of Korea can provide substantially 
the same degree of protection for the sen-
sitive technology being released as the US. 
Government. This sale is necessary in fur-
therance of the U.S. foreign policy and na-
tional security objectives outlined in the 
Policy Justification. 
5. All defense articles and services listed in 
this transmittal have been authorized for re-
lease and export to the Republic of Korea. 
NOMINATION OF AMY CONEY 
BARRETT 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I 
don’t think I am overstating the sever-
ity of the situation when I say that 
this past week has been one of the 
most chaotic and divisive in our Na-
tion’s history. The American people 
met the news of Supreme Court Justice 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s death with an 
outpouring of sympathy; but, of course, 
rather than let an opportunity go to 
waste, radicals and activists, fueled by 
the same hatred that still fills our 
streets with violence, emerged from 
the shadows and exploited a nation’s 
grief. 
Rarely—or perhaps, never before—in 
the history of this country have the so- 
called progressive movement, the ac-
tivist left, and even some members of 
the Senate minority worked so tire-
lessly to scare the American people 
into submission. 
Their willingness to use differences 
in family, religion, and personal moral-
ity to impugn the integrity and com-
petence of Supreme Court Associate 
Justice nominee Judge Amy Coney 
Barrett without giving her the benefit 
of even a single conversation shocks 
the conscience. It is a scandal beneath 
the dignity of this body. 
In the coming weeks, I would encour-
age my colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle to meet with Judge Barrett, as I 
did today. I think you will find that 
she is not trying to get off easy. As a 
fellow conservative woman who cher-
ishes a deep faith and commitment to 
family, I can assure you, she has al-
ready been tested by fire and passed 
with flying colors. 
f 
ONLINE FREEDOM AND VIEWPOINT 
DIVERSITY ACT 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, 
this week, the Senate Committee on 
Commerce, 
Science, 
and 
Transpor-
tation subpoenaed testimony from Mr. 
Jack Dorsey of Twitter, Mr. Sundar 
Pichai of Alphabet, Inc., and Mr. Mark 
Zuckerberg of Facebook. 
I supported the issuance of these sub-
poenas, and I look forward to hearing 
testimony on the content moderation 
policies used by their respective plat-
forms. 
Over the past few months, I have 
worked with many members of this 
body on a statutory fix to section 230 of 
the Communications Decency Act, spe-
cifically to the ingrained liability 
shield that platforms like Facebook 
use to defend their content moderation 
policies. Over the years, we have seen 
Big Tech’s biggest players stretch this 
shield beyond all recognition, far be-
yond the limits Congress envisioned 
when they passed the original act in 
1996. 
Now, content moderators wield their 
power with abandon, banning and de-
leting content they disagree with right 
alongside content of the most vile, uni-
versally repulsive nature. Last month,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6024 
October 1, 2020 
in response to growing outcries over 
censorship, I introduced the Online 
Freedom and Viewpoint Diversity Act 
with Chairman LINDSEY GRAHAM and 
Chairman ROGER WICKER to introduce 
accountability into our dealings with 
digital platforms and services. 
This bill is unique because it doesn’t 
do specifically what so many here in 
Washington would like it to do: It 
doesn’t delete section 230 from the U.S. 
Code, nor does it put the power to de-
cide what information should and 
should not be available online in 
Congress’s or regulators’ hands. All it 
does is remove ambiguities from the 
original statutory language to help 
companies and consumers better under-
stand when that liability shield is and 
is not applicable. 
Still, as we move forward with legis-
lation, it is important to remember 
that we are creating policy for the 
internet we have now and will have in 
the future and not the internet we had 
back in 1996, hence the reason for the 
subpoenas we are sending to those 
three Silicon Valley executives. They 
are the ones who created the internet 
we have today, and their justifications 
and perspectives regarding the future 
of content moderation could prove use-
ful. Subpoenas do change the tone of 
the conversation, but we view this as a 
rare opportunity to glean both insight 
and accountability from the tech in-
dustry. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO FRANK CALVELLI 
Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise 
today to recognize and celebrate the 
career of an outstanding civil servant, 
Mr. Frank Calvelli, who is one of my 
constituents. Mr. Calvelli recently an-
nounced his plan to retire after 34 
years of government service, most re-
cently as the Principal Deputy Direc-
tor for the National Reconnaissance 
Office, where he has provided com-
mendable leadership and operational 
management for the past 8 years. Mr. 
Calvelli will complete his government 
service at the end of this year. 
During Frank’s 30-year tenure at the 
NRO, he has been responsible for lead-
ing various internal organizations and 
overseeing the acquisition and oper-
ation of many of our Nation’s most 
vital overhead reconnaissance assets. 
These platforms perform essential in-
telligence collection roles to better in-
form U.S. Government and allied part-
ner nation defense policies and deter 
potential aggressors. Frank contrib-
uted to 11-plus-years of consecutive 
clean financial audits, an unequaled 
record within the U.S. intelligence 
community. Mr. Calvelli has played an 
important role developing a permanent 
employee cadre and leading the more 
than 3,000 people who work at the NRO. 
When called upon in 2019 to take on the 
responsibility of acting in the capacity 
of the Director, he often testified on 
behalf of the NRO before Congress and 
specifically the Senate Select Com-
mittee on Intelligence. 
While Mr. Calvelli has shouldered the 
responsibility of overseeing large, com-
plex government acquisition programs, 
his fondest memories will be of the 
NRO’s people. Like any successful or-
ganization, the NRO relies on its tal-
ented and skilled workforce to accom-
plish its national security mission. 
Their wellbeing and success have al-
ways been a top priority for him, and it 
is especially important that the women 
and men of the NRO have leadership 
that backs them in their primary im-
perative as intelligence professionals: 
to speak truth to power. 
I also understand that Frank’s love 
of NASCAR is well known at the NRO. 
I, 
too, 
share 
an 
appreciation 
of 
NASCAR and hope he has greater op-
portunities to enjoy racing and more 
time with his family. On behalf of a 
grateful nation, as he transitions to fu-
ture opportunities, I would like to pub-
licly thank Mr. Calvelli for his valu-
able contributions to the Nation and 
our national security, and I personally 
thank the Calvelli family for their crit-
ical role in supporting him throughout 
his service to the Nation.

TRIBUTE TO ROBINSON 
DESROCHES 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor one of Louisville’s fin-
est, Louisville Metro Police Officer 
Robinson Desroches. Police work is an 
unquestionably difficult and dangerous 
job, but it is among the noblest 
callings. Each and every day, officers 
risk their lives to keep our commu-
nities safe. Officers such as Louisville 
Metro 
Police 
Officer 
Robinson 
Desroches meet the challenges they en-
counter 
every 
day 
with 
profes-
sionalism, class, and courage. Officer 
Desroches joined the LMPD in 2019. 
Serving to keep the peace in Louisville 
during a time of uncertainty, Officer 
Desroches has served his community 
with class and courage during this dif-
ficult time. Dedicated service from of-
ficers like Officer Desroches during 
times of protest is important to keep 
protests peaceful instead of a riot. Offi-
cer Desroches and his fellow officers 
deserve and have our respect and admi-
ration. Officer Desroches was shot on 
Wednesday night during the protest in 
Louisville. Fortunately, he is expected 
to make a full recovery. I join my fel-
low Kentuckians in wishing Officer 
Desroches a speedy recovery. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO AUBREY GREGORY 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor one of Louisville’s fin-
est, Louisville Metro Police Major Au-
brey Gregory. Police work is an un-
questionably difficult and dangerous 
job, but it is among the noblest 
callings. Each and every day, officers 
risk their lives to keep our commu-
nities safe. Officers such as Louisville 
Metro Police Major Aubrey Gregory 
meet the challenges they encounter 
every day with professionalism, class, 
and courage. Major Gregory joined the 
LMPD in 1999 and leads Louisville 
Metro Police Special Operations Unit. 
Serving to keep the peace in Louisville 
during a time of uncertainty, Major 
Gregory has led his fellow officers with 
class and courage during this difficult 
time. Dedicated service from officers 
like Major Gregory during times of 
protest is important to keep protests 
peaceful instead of a riot. Major Greg-
ory and his fellow officers deserve and 
have our respect and admiration. Major 
Gregory was shot on Wednesday night 
during the protest in Louisville. Fortu-
nately, Major Gregory is expected to 
make a full recovery. I join my fellow 
Kentuckians in wishing Major Gregory 
a speedy recovery.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
THE MAGIC CITY DISCOVERY 
CENTER 
∑ Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, I rec-
ognize today the city of Minot, the 
Minot Air Force Base, and other com-
munity members who have come to-
gether to present their youngest citi-
zens a gift they will enjoy for genera-
tions to come. 
Groundbreaking will be held on Octo-
ber 7 for the Magic City Discovery Cen-
ter, a children’s museum that will de-
velop 12 interactive galleries on math, 
engineering, technology, science, and 
art for children up to 14 years old. The 
musuem will encourage children of all 
ages to learn both independently and in 
groups as they invent, play, discover, 
and create. 
Making this center a reality has been 
a significant challenge to its sup-
porters, and only with many partners 
could the nearly $14 million in con-
struction costs be met. A large boost 
came from the Minot Air Force Base, 
which worked with the community to 
secure a $6.3 million grant from the De-
fense Community Infrastructure Pilot 
Program. This Department of Defense 
program 
helps 
fund 
projects 
that 
prioritize quality of life for Active 
military families. The commanders of 
the Minot Air Force Base supported 
this grant so their more than 1,300 chil-
dren of military families from kinder-
garten through fifth grade have year- 
round learning opportunities. 
I congratulate the city of Minot and 
Minot Air Force Base on another suc-
cessful community partnership. The 
men and women stationed at the base 
perform exemplary work every day 
critical to the safety of our Nation. We 
must do all we can to support them and 
their families during their time as 
North Dakota residents. 
North Dakota’s quality of life is con-
sistently ranked as one of the best in 
the Nation. An excellent example of 
why we have this high ranking is the 
dedication of the citizens of Minot to 
give their children a Magic City Dis-
covery Center.∑

representing significant improvement from 
previous decades; 
Whereas 2⁄3 of children who survive cancer 
will develop at least 1 chronic health condi-
tion, and 1⁄4 of all survivors will face a late- 
effect from treatment that could be consid-
ered severe or life-threatening; 
Whereas cancer patients face a higher risk 
of contracting the Coronavirus Disease 2019 
(COVID–19) due to a weakened immune sys-
tem; and 
Whereas cancer occurs regularly and ran-
domly and spares no racial or ethnic group,

Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates September 2020 as ‘‘National 
Childhood Cancer Awareness Month’’; 
(2) requests that the Federal Government, 
States, localities, and nonprofit organiza-
tions observe the month with appropriate 
programs and activities, with the goal of in-
creasing public knowledge of the risks of 
cancer; 
(3) encourages survivors of childhood can-
cer to continue to receive ongoing moni-

(4) recognizes the human toll of cancer and 
pledges to make the prevention and cure of 
cancer a public health priority; and

Mr. ENZI (for himself, Mr. CARDIN, 
Ms. COLLINS, Mr. YOUNG, Mr. ALEX-
ANDER, Mrs. MURRAY, Ms. HASSAN, and 
Mr. BARRASSO) submitted the following 
resolution; which was considered and 
agreed to: 
S. RES. 743 
Whereas people in the United States are 
living longer, and the cost of retirement is 
increasing significantly; 
Whereas Social Security remains the bed-
rock of retirement income for the great ma-
jority of the people of the United States but 
was never intended by Congress to be the 
sole source of retirement income for fami-
lies; 
Whereas data from the Employee Benefit 
Research Institute indicates that, in the 
United States— 
(1) up to 40 percent of households in which 
the head of household is between the ages of 
35 and 64 are likely to run out of money in 
retirement; and 
(2) the amount that workers have saved for 
retirement is much less than the amount 
those workers need to adequately fund their 
retirement years; 
Whereas the financial literacy of workers 
in the United States is important so that 
those workers understand the need to save 
for retirement; 
Whereas saving for retirement is a key 
component of overall financial health and se-
curity during retirement years, and the im-
portance of financial literacy in planning for 
retirement must be advocated; 
Whereas many workers may not— 
(1) be aware of their various options in sav-
ing for retirement; or 
(2) have focused on the importance of, and 
need for, saving for retirement and success-
fully achieving retirement security; 
Whereas, although many employees have 
access to defined benefit and defined con-
tribution plans through their employers to 
assist such employees in preparing for retire-
ment, many of those employees may not be 
taking advantage of those plans at all or to 
the full extent allowed by Federal law; 
Whereas saving for retirement is necessary 
even during economic downturns or market 
declines, underscoring the importance of 
continued contributions; 
Whereas all workers, including public and 
private sector employees, employees of tax- 
exempt organizations, and self-employed in-
dividuals, can benefit from developing per-
sonal budgets and financial plans that in-
clude retirement savings strategies that 
take advantage of tax-preferred retirement 
savings vehicles; 
Whereas effectively and sustainably with-
drawing retirement resources throughout an 
individual’s retirement years is as important 
and crucial as saving and accumulating 
funds for retirement; and 
Whereas the month of October 2020, has 
been designated as ‘‘National Retirement Se-
curity Month’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the goals and ideals of Na-
tional Retirement Security Month, including 
raising public awareness of the importance 
of saving adequately for retirement; 
(2) acknowledges the need to raise public 
awareness of the variety of tax-preferred re-
tirement vehicles that are used by many peo-
ple in the United States, but remain under-
utilized; and 
(3) calls on States, localities, schools, uni-
versities, 
nonprofit 
organizations, 
busi-
nesses, other entities, and the people of the 
United States to observe National Retire-
ment Security Month with appropriate pro-
grams and activities, with the goal of in-
creasing the retirement savings and personal 
financial literacy of all people in the United 
States and enhancing the retirement secu-
rity of the people of the United States.

Mr. VAN HOLLEN (for himself and 
Mr. CARDIN) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee on Homeland Security and 
Governmental Affairs: 
S. RES. 744 
Whereas the National Federation of Fed-
eral Employees (referred to in this preamble 
as the ‘‘NFFE’’) was created in 1917 as the 
first union in the United States to exclu-
sively represent civil service Federal em-
ployees; 
Whereas the NFFE preserves, promotes, 
and improves the rights and working condi-
tions of Federal employees and other profes-
sionals through all lawful means, including 
collective bargaining, legislative activities, 
and contributing to civic and charitable or-
ganizations; 
Whereas the contributions of the NFFE are 
noted in history through a century of 
achievements for the Federal labor move-
ment, including numerous reforms to work-
force policies and working conditions; 
Whereas members of the NFFE serve the 
United States by performing critical func-
tions throughout Federal agencies, including 
the Department of Defense, the Department 
of Housing and Urban Development, the De-
partment of Veterans Affairs, the Bureau of 
Land Management, the Forest Service, the 
National Park Service, the Federal Aviation 
Administration, the General Services Ad-
ministration, the Indian Health Service, the 
Passport Service of the Bureau of Consular 
Affairs, and the Corps of Engineers; 
Whereas, through a partnership with the 
International Association of Machinists and 
Aerospace Workers and the American Fed-
eration of Labor and Congress of Industrial 
Organizations, the NFFE promotes better 
working conditions and an improved quality 
of life for working families across the United 
States; 
Whereas the NFFE represents more than 
110,000 Federal employees; and 
Whereas the NFFE continues to ensure 
that the voices of Federal civil servants are 
properly represented: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) congratulates and honors the National 
Federation of Federal Employees on the 
celebration of its 51st Convention; and 
(2) recognizes the vital contributions of the 
members of the National Federal of Federal 
Employees to the United States during the 
103-year period since the founding of the Na-
tional Federation of Federal Employees.

Mr. 
PORTMAN, Mr. LEAHY, Mrs. CAPITO, Mr. 
MURPHY, Ms. COLLINS, Mrs. FEINSTEIN, 
Mr. CRAMER, and Mr. KAINE) submitted 
the following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on Foreign 
Relations: 
S. RES. 745 
Whereas Yitzhak Rabin was born March 1, 
1922, in Jerusalem; 
Whereas Yitzhak Rabin served as Ambas-
sador to the United States from 1968 to 1973, 
Minister of Defense from 1984 to 1990, and 
Prime Minister from 1974 to 1977 and from 
1992 until his assassination in 1995; 
Whereas, in 1975, Prime Minister Yitzhak 
Rabin signed the interim agreement with 
Egypt which laid the groundwork for the 1979 
Camp David Peace Treaty between Israel and 
Egypt; 
Whereas, on September 13, 1993, in Wash-
ington, D.C., Yitzhak Rabin signed the Dec-
laration of Principles framework agreement

known as the Oslo Accords; 
Whereas 
Yitzhak 
Rabin, 
along 
with 
Shimon Peres and Yasser Arafat, received 
the 1994 Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts to 
create peace in the Middle East;

because the alternative is grim for us all. 
And we will prevail. We will prevail because 
we regard the building of peace as a great 
blessing for us, and for our children after 
us.’’; 
Whereas, on October 26, 1994, Yitzhak 
Rabin and King Hussein of Jordan signed a 
peace treaty between Israel and Jordan, say-
ing at the time: ‘‘There is only one radical 
means of sanctifying human lives. Not ar-
mored plating, or tanks, or planes, or con-
crete fortifications. The one radical solution 
is peace.’’; 
Whereas, on November 4, 1995, Yitzhak 
Rabin was assassinated after attending a 
peace rally in Tel Aviv, where his last words 
were, ‘‘I have always believed that the ma-
jority of the people want peace, are prepared 
to take risks for peace . . . Peace is what the 
Jewish People aspire to.’’; 
Whereas Yitzhak Rabin dedicated his life 
to the cause of peace and security for the 
State of Israel by defending his nation 
against all threats, including terrorism and 
invasion, and undertaking courageous risks 
in the pursuit of peace; 
Whereas, in the years following Yitzhak 
Rabin’s 
assassination, 
successive 
United 
States administrations have sought to help 
Israel and the Palestinians achieve a nego-
tiated two-state solution that ends their 
conflict; and 
Whereas, twenty-five years later, the lead-
ership of Yitzhak Rabin can be a model for 
securing peace during a time of conflict: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) honors the historic role of Yitzhak 
Rabin for his distinguished service to the 
Israeli people and extends its deepest sym-
pathy and condolences to the family of 
Yitzhak Rabin and the people of Israel on 
the 25th anniversary of his death; 
(2) recognizes and reiterates its continued 
support for the close ties and special rela-
tionship between the United States and 
Israel; 
(3) expresses support and admiration for 
community leaders and government officials 
who work tirelessly to encourage co-exist-
ence and cooperation between the Israelis 
and Palestinians; and 
(4) reaffirms its strong support for a nego-
tiated solution to the Israeli-Palestinian 
conflict resulting in two states—a demo-
cratic Jewish State of Israel, and a viable, 
democratic Palestinian state—living side-by- 
side in peace, security, and mutual recogni-
tion.

IN RECOGNITION OF MARK 
ANTHONY 
HON. LAUREN UNDERWOOD 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 1, 2020 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to recognize Mark Anthony for his service in 
my office in Washington, D.C. 
Mark joined our office as a legislative fellow 
and served as an advisor for my work on the 
House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, in ad-
dition to handling a policy portfolio that in-
cluded defense, foreign affairs, agriculture, 
and trade. Among other accomplishments, he 
coordinated legislation to improve mental 
health care delivery at the VA and worked with 
our agricultural community to navigate the 
challenges of COVID–19 and ongoing trade 
tensions. Mark was instrumental in the devel-
opment and introduction of the Lethal Means 
Safety Training Act, the Veterans in STEM 
Act, and the No Coronavirus Copays for Vet-
erans Act. 
Mark’s professionalism, work ethic, and 
dedication were invaluable assets throughout 
his time in my office. I commend his drive to 
advance mental health and suicide prevention 
services for veterans and to improve out-
comes for women veterans and younger vet-
erans. Although Mark may be leaving our of-
fice, our veterans in northern Illinois and our 
community members who support and honor 
them will continue to benefit from the results 
of his hard work and expertise. 
Prior to joining my staff, Mark earned a 
Bachelor of Science from George Mason Uni-
versity and served our country as an officer in 
the United States Marine Corps, where he de-
ployed twice in support of Operation Enduring 
Freedom. I am grateful he chose to continue 
his career in public service by joining my of-
fice. Our office will miss his kindness, dili-
gence, and friendship. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to formally 
thank Mark Anthony for his service to my of-
fice, to lllinois’ 14th Congressional District, and 
to our country.

UYGHUR FORCED LABOR 
DISCLOSURE ACT OF 2020 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 30, 2020 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a co-
sponsor and a senior member of the Commit-
tees on the Judiciary and Homeland Security, 
I rise in strong support of H.R. 6270, the 
‘‘Uyghur Forced Labor Disclosure Act of 
2020’’, which directs the Securities and Ex-
change Commission to issue rules requiring 
U.S. publicly traded companies to disclose im-
ports of manufactured goods and materials 
that originate in or are sourced in part from 
the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region 
(XUAR) on an annual basis. 
With this bill, companies would also be re-
quired to disclose that the goods and mate-
rials did not originate from forced labor as well 
as describe the nature and extent of commer-
cial activity related to the products. 
Furthermore, companies must also provide 
the gross revenue and net profits attributable 
to the good. 
The legislation also stipulates that compa-
nies must say whether they intend to continue 
importing from that entity. 
H.R. 6270 ensures that both the SEC and 
GAO would be required to report to Congress 
on compliance, oversight, and effectiveness. 
For years, the Chinese government has en-
gaged in a systematic campaign of repression 
targeting Uyghurs and other Muslim groups. 
Chinese authorities have used the pretext of 
terrorism to suspend the Uyghurs’ civil and po-
litical rights and pursue the internment of 
Uyghurs in ‘‘educational training centers’’ 
where they are forbidden from practicing their 
religious and cultural beliefs. 
These same education centers are forced 
labor camps. 
According to the BBC, approximately one 
million Uyghurs have been detained without 
trial, forced into mass internment camps, and 
subjected to forced labor, torture, political in-
doctrination, forced renunciations of faith, and 
other severe human rights abuses. 
The U.S. Holocaust Museum’s Simon-Skjodt 
Center for the Prevention of Genocide recently 
determined that there is reasonable basis to 
believe crimes against humanity are being 
committed in the XUAR. 
Furthermore, satellite imagery, leaked offi-
cial documents from the Chinese government, 
and the testimony of camp survivors have 
confirmed a widespread and pervasive forced 
labor system that exists inside the mass in-
ternment camps. 
This is a systematic, widespread, and 
shocking violation of basic human rights for 
which the Government of China must be held 
accountable. 
The United States cannot and should not sit 
idly by while these gross injustices are hap-
pening. 
According to numerous reports, forced labor 
by the Uyghur detainees in labor camps and 
factories feed into the supply chains of more 
than 80 well-known global brands. 
In its 2019 Annual Report, the Congres-
sional-Executive Commission on China found 
that goods produced with forced labor in-
cluded textiles, electronics, food products, 
shoes, tea, and handicrafts. 
Mr. Speaker, companies have a moral duty 
to ensure the goods they purchase are made 
using free workers who are paid a fair wage, 
and the transparency measures in this bill are 
key to ending the persistence of modern-day 
slavery in supply chains. 
Importing products made wholly or in part 
from forced or prison labor is not only against 
U.S. law but also international human rights 
standards. 
However, audits and due diligence efforts to 
ensure clean supply chains are nearly impos-
sible due to government surveillance and the 
pervasiveness of forced labor in the regional 
economy. 
Time and time again, the United States has 
been the beacon of freedom in the world and 
a fierce defender of human rights. 
Today, we, as Members of Congress, have 
a duty to continue that legacy by condemning 
the heinous human rights violations against 
the Uyghur people in the XUAR. 
By passing H.R. 6270, our actions send a 
message to China that Congress not only 
stands in solidarity with the Uyghur people but 
also that we will always speak up for the vul-
nerable and the voiceless whether that is in 
the Xinjiang region of China or anywhere else 
in the world. 
Lastly, Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank Con-
gresswoman WEXTON for introducing this vital 
piece of legislation, and I am proud to do my 
part in leading this bill through the House. 
I urge my colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle to join me in voting for H.R. 6270.

HONORING THE LIFE OF JUDY 
CHRISTOFOLIS 
HON. SUSAN W. BROOKS 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 1, 2020 
Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor the life and legacy of my 
dear friend, Judy Christofolis. Not only was 
she my close friend, she was also a commu-
nity leader and a successful businesswoman. 
Over the last ten plus years of her life, she ex-
hibited her incredible spirit and determination 
as she bravely fought metastatic breast can-
cer. Sadly, she lost her battle on March 12, 
2020. I will forever cherish my memories of 
her. 
Judy was born on January 19, 1962, in Indi-
anapolis, Indiana, to Gerald and Martha 
Morford. She proudly attended school in War-
ren Township in Indianapolis at Moorehead El-
ementary, Woodview Junior High, and grad-
uated from Warren Central High School in 
1980. Judy attended Butler University, grad-
uating in 1984 with a Bachelor of Science in 
accounting and finance. 
Judy began her career as a CPA with Geo. 
S. Olive, a regional accounting firm. There she 
met her future husband, Ted, whom she mar-
ried in 1986. Judy later was controller at Baker 
& Daniels law firm but eventually founded her 
own accounting business, Windsor Accounting 
Services, which later became Redwood Ac-
counting Services. In 1998, she and Ted start-
ed Redwood Investment Advisors, an inde-
pendent fee-only investment advisory firm. In 
2011, Judy joined my campaign team, and 
served as my treasurer since 2012. 
Judy and I met as members of the Junior 
League of Indianapolis, an organization of 
women committed to promoting voluntarism,

developing the potential of women and im-
proving the community through the effective 
action and leadership of trained volunteers. 
Judy was an exemplary and active member, 
serving as treasurer twice and was a board 
member for multiple years. She used her fi-
nancial skills in the volunteer world, devel-
oping the investment strategy for the Junior 
League’s endowment, making the Indianapolis 
chapter one of the most successful chapters in 
the country. The Indianapolis Art Center (IAC) 
benefitted from her accounting, financial and 
investment skills during her tenure on its 
board. Ted and Judy enjoyed taking clients 
and friends to ArtSparkle, the summer party 
supporting IAC. In addition, Judy was on the 
board of Indianapolis Day Nursery, Indiana’s 
oldest and largest early childhood education 
non-profit. 
In the last decade of Judy’s life, while she 
battled breast cancer, she was a founding 
member of the Indianapolis American Cancer 
Society Guild and served as its treasurer. The 
Guild’s mission is to support the Central Indi-
ana office of the American Cancer Society by 
generating awareness, raising funds and pro-
viding support for community outreach pro-
grams to achieve the shared goal of saving 
lives by helping people stay well, get well, find 
cures and fight back. This mission epitomized 
Judy’s fight against breast cancer. 
Judy was known for her compassion and 
friendship and lived her life with passion. She 
was cherished by many, including her dear 
friends in her book club as well as the ‘‘Kool 
Kat’’ Club, made up of long-time high school 
girlfriends. Every Christmas, she entertained 
clients and friends at a much anticipated and 
beloved party, exclusively catered by Judy. 
She learned her skills from studying at the 
Culinary Institute of America in New York. The 
cookies and dog treats were especially prized 
by those fortunate enough to attend! 
Judy had a love for animals that was un-
matched. Often times, Judy found dogs but 
sometimes they found her as was the case 
with Jasmine, one of her favorite strays. Ted 
and Judy’s beautiful homes were always full of 
dogs adored by them both. 
Judy spent summers at Lake Wawasee in 
Syracuse, Indiana as a child, and later she 
and Ted built a beautiful home on Syracuse 
Lake which was always full of family, friends 
and fun. I was pleased to be a guest there 
several times. 
She was a loving wife, sister, daughter, aunt 
and friend who will be missed deeply by so 
many people. She was strong and courageous 
throughout her entire fight with breast cancer, 
never lost her positivity and fought hard until 
the very end. 
I stand today in honor of the wonderful life 
my friend Judy lived. I know so many will miss 
her and remember her as a shining light in 
their lives. I send my sincerest condolences to 
her husband Ted, her fur babies Jasmine, Big 
Boy Joe, J.B., Josie and the late Brady, her 
brother Richard and his family and all who 
were fortunate enough to know her. 
CELEBRATING FILIPINO AMERICAN 
HISTORY MONTH 
HON. BEN McADAMS 
OF UTAH 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 1, 2020 
Mr. MCADAMS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in celebration of Filipino American His-
tory Month which commemorates the arrival of 
the first Filipinos, or ‘‘Luzones Indios,’’ landing 
in what is now known as Morro Bay, California 
on October 18, 1587. For over 400 years, Fili-
pino Americans have been key participants in 
the American experiment, striving towards 
equality and justice for all. 
This continues today. As our nation battles 
the COVID–19 pandemic, Filipino American 
healthcare workers have been essential in our 
response 
to 
the 
virus. 
Nearly 
150,000 
healthcare workers across the country are 
second or third-generation Filipino American. I 
deeply appreciate the hard work and sacrifice 
of these heroes who fight every day to protect 
and heal their fellow Americans. 
Since 1900, Filipino Americans have en-
riched the fabric of Utah as artists, farmers, 
educators, healthcare workers, and activists. 
Over 15,000 Filipino Americans call Utah 
home and are one of our state’s fastest grow-
ing communities. As we commemorate Filipino 
American History Month, I am so grateful for 
the contributions that have been made to our 
great state and Nation by Filipino Americans.

JUDGE RICHARD E. FIELDS 100TH 
BIRTHDAY 
HON. JOE CUNNINGHAM 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 1, 2020 
Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the 100th birthday of Judge 
Richard E. Fields of Charleston, South Caro-
lina. I am in awe of his continued public serv-
ice to the Lowcountry and his trailblazing leg-
acy for the African American community of our 
state. 
After graduating from Howard University 
School of Law in 1947, Judge Fields was the 
first black attorney to open a law firm in 
Charleston. He found success after success 
an serve honorably as a South Carolina Cir-
cuit Court judge until his retirement in 1992. 
Judge Fields is a proud worshiper at the 
historic Centenary Methodist Church, where 
he was elected as Treasurer in 1950 and still 
holds that position to this date. For more than 
50 years, he served as the delegate to the 
South Carolina Annual Conference and was a 
member of the Merger Committee that deseg-
regated the white and Black conferences of 
the United Methodist Church during the late 
1960s and early 1970s. A voting rights ‘‘cham-
pion, Judge Fields helped form the Charleston 
County Political Action Committee where he 
organized black voters and helped elect Black 
South Carolinians to office. 
Anyone who knows Judge Fields can attest 
that he is a friend who quickly becomes fam-
ily. He is more than willing to offer legal advice 
or spiritual affirmations and he does so with 
integrity and kindness. Not many people can 
say they have a U.S. Post Office named after 
them like Judge Fields; even less can say 
they have lived such a fulfilling and philan-
thropic life like Judge Fields. I thank Judge 
Fields for an incredible century of service to 
South Carolina.

CAREER 
PROGRAM ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 30, 2020 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of H.R. 5822, the ‘‘Homeland Security 
Acquisition Professional Career Program Act,’’ 
which would authorize an acquisition profes-
sional career program (APCP) within DHS. 
This program, which DHS established in 
2008, is a pipeline for a cadre of acquisition 
professionals to support the Department’s 
multi-billion dollar investments in goods and 
services. 
Under APCP, DHS hires individuals, many 
of which are new to the Federal government 
or recent college graduates, at the GS–7 
grade level to work in one of six acquisition 
positions. 
Upon successful completion of the three- 
year program, participants are placed into per-
manent full-time positions at the GS–12 grade 
level. 
The bill outlines the requirements for the 
program, which includes acquisition training, 
on-the-job experience, Department-wide rota-
tions, mentorship, shadowing, and other ca-
reer development opportunities for partici-
pants. 
The bill also requires the Secretary of 
Homeland Security to report annually to Con-
gress through fiscal year 2026 on various as-
pects of the program, including the DHS com-
ponents and offices that participated, attrition 
and retention rates, and the Department’s re-
cruiting efforts for the program. 
The Department of Homeland Security is 
the third largest Department of the U.S. gov-
ernment, with a workforce of 229,000 employ-
ees and 22 components including TSA, Cus-
toms and Border Protection, Immigration and

RECOGNIZING THE ACHIEVEMENTS 
OF LIEUTENANT GENERAL ASH-
LEY 
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 1, 2020 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Lieutenant General Robert Ash-
ley on the eve of his retirement, after over 35 
years of service to his nation as an Army intel-
ligence officer. 
As testament to his competence and char-
acter, on two-separate occasions, the Nation 
entrusted General Ashley with the responsi-
bility to lead different elements of our Intel-
ligence Community. 
The congressional intelligence committees 
are unique as they must truly partner with the 
organizations they are charged to oversee. 
In my time on the Intelligence Committee, 
and his time leading military intelligence orga-
nizations, I have appreciated General Ashley’s 
candor and ability to think strategically. 
As the Army’s Intelligence Chief, he imple-
mented reforms that saved struggling acquisi-
tion programs and delivered tools directly to 
warfighters. 
Most recently, in his tenure as Director of 
DIA, General Ashley led key initiatives that en-
sured continuing the transformation of the DIA. 
Perhaps most importantly, and in the best 
tradition of service, General Ashley took time 
out of his busy schedule to mentor junior intel-
ligence officers. I am confident that this next 
generation of intelligence professionals will be 
his most significant and lasting legacy. 
General Ashley has done his part to leave 
the Army, the Department of Defense, the De-
fense Intelligence Agency, and the Intelligence 
Community in a stronger position for his suc-
cessors and the Nation. We wish him well.

HONORING WILLIAM LANSON FOR 
HIS UNIQUE AND INVALUABLE 
CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE CITY OF 
NEW HAVEN 
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 1, 2020 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I am hon-
ored to rise today to join the Amistad Com-
mittee, the City of New Haven, and all of 
those gathered today in paying tribute to a 
pioneering African American who quite literally 
changed the landscape of the City of New 
Haven, William Lanson, and who ultimately 
faced defamation and destitution from a white 
Majority that used its levers of state power to 
put him into ruin. But, today, we return him to 
his rightful and honorable place in the history 
of our town as a bronze statue is dedicated in 
his honor. 
According to a Hartford Courant piece in 
2001, quote, ‘‘William Lanson was an extraor-
dinary figure in early 19th-century New Haven. 
Almost certainly an escaped slave, Lanson 
overcame incredible odds to become a highly 
successful businessman, one of the earliest 
black entrepreneurs in Connecticut.’’ William 
Lanson was a man ahead of his time in many 
ways, none more so than in the innovative en-
gineering concepts that he brought to his suc-
cessful projects in the City of New Haven. 
Though little is known about his earliest years, 
we do know that Lanson and his family moved 
to New Haven around 1803 and within just 
seven years he became the city’s principal 
wharf builder. 
In 1810, he was the only contractor able to 
complete the complicated 1,350-foot extension 
to the city’s Long Wharf, enabling larger boats 
to dock in the city’s port and allowing the city 
to compete with nearby ports including New 
York. The extension was only possible be-
cause he employed specially designed scows, 
carefully designed by Lanson himself, capable 
of carrying twenty-five tons of stone at a time. 
The stone was quarried by him and his labor-
ers, from nearby East Rock, floated on the 
scows to the harbor where they were installed 
to stabilize the pilings for the wharf’s exten-
sion. Following his success at Long Wharf, 
Lanson was contracted to build the retaining 
wall for the newly planned Farmington Canal 
where it flowed into the harbor basin. These 
two projects changed the very character of 
New Haven Harbor and the City itself, further 
allowing both to thrive and prosper—a feat 
which would have not been accomplished 
without William Lanson’s invaluable contribu-
tions. 
It was more than the architecture of the city 
to which he contributed. It was its business 
landscape, its civic culture, and its moral fiber, 
as an African American leader who fought 
their disenfranchisement. He was a successful 
businessman, operating a hotel, grocery, and 
livery service, as well as a founding member 
of the Temple Street Church, which later be-
came the Dixwell Avenue Congregational 
United Church of Christ. He was a fierce aboli-
tionist and advocate for voting rights. 
According to research by Yale, in 1811, the 
Reverend Timothy Dwight, President of Yale 
College, praised William Lanson, as quote, 
‘‘honourable proof of the character which they 
sustain, both for capacity, and integrity, in the 
view of respectable men.’’ But, as the Yale re-
search said, quote, ‘‘By the end of the 1820s 
such praise had all but vanished . . . . and 
Lanson found himself beset financially and at-
tacked and ridiculed.’’ According to Amy L. 
Trout, curator at the New Haven Colony His-
torical Society, quote, ‘‘he was constantly har-
assed by the police. The minute he was re-
leased from the police station and got home, 
he would be arrested for something else.’’ 
Late in life, Lanson wrote that he was jailed 
five times in six years for a total of 450 days, 
for selling liquor at his hotel, the Liberian, a 
very common practice. The pressure contin-
ued until he died forgotten, defamed, and des-
titute. So, we right that wrong. And, we must. 
Lanson was an unbelievably important and im-
pressive man, an African American who re-
shaped, reformed, and re-invigorated. Doing 
so as an African American in the 19th century. 
He was a force. 
William Lanson left an indelible mark on the 
City of New Haven and I am glad to be able 
to witness our community coming together to 
recognize, celebrate, and preserve his story. 
My deepest thanks to the dedicated members 
of the Amistad Committee and the City of New 
Haven 
who 
have 
ensured 
that 
William 
Lanson’s contributions to our community will 
always be remembered.

Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as the 
Founding Chair of the Coronavirus Task Force 
and a senior member of the Judiciary and 
Homeland Committees, I rise in strong support 
of H.R. 7496, the ‘‘COVID PREPARE Act,’’ 
which requires every federal agency to submit 
a report to Congress on the steps they are 
taking to respond to a potential resurgence of 
COVID–19, including measurable goals, antici-
pated challenges, and how they will consult 
with Congress. 
I would like to thank Representatives BRAD 
SCHNEIDER and JOHN KATKO for introducing 
and leading this important piece of legislation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E912 
October 1, 2020 
By passing this bipartisan bill today, Con-
gress has taken it upon itself to ensure that all 
federal agencies are aware of the risks associ-
ated with any resurgence in coronavirus cases 
and are prepared to address them efficiently. 
This legislation stipulates that Congress will 
receive regular updates from these agencies 
until the President ends the emergency dec-
laration related to the coronavirus pandemic. 
At the beginning of this pandemic, the fed-
eral government’s response to COVID–19 was 
delayed, disorganized, and haphazard. 
It is because of these inefficiencies that the 
United States currently has over 7 million 
cases of the coronavirus and over 205,000 re-
lated deaths. 
In the state of Texas alone, there are cur-
rently 761,332 cases of the virus and approxi-
mately 15,820 deaths. 
We must not make the same mistakes 
again. 
As the COVID–19 pandemic continues to 
wreak havoc on American communities and 
take thousands of American lives, experts 
have warned that things might get even worse 
in the fall, especially as schools, businesses, 
and communities continue to reopen. 
Over the last six months, federal agencies 
have learned many hard lessons, and they 
have crafted new, effective strategies that will 
protect families and communities across the 
country fight against a possible resurgence of 
coronavirus cases this fall. 
We must put our faith in science and con-
tinue to invest in testing, contact tracing, as 
well as vaccine development. 
In my own district, I have facilitated the 
opening of 32 testing sites since the beginning 
of the pandemic in an effort to curb the spread 
of the virus. 
Mr. Speaker, Congress has a duty to assure 
the American people that the federal govern-
ment is doing everything in its power to beat 
back the dual health and economic crises of 
this pandemic. 
H.R. 7496 honors that responsibility en-
trusted to us by the American people, and I 
urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle 
to come together and vote for this important 
legislation.

COMMEMORATING 
THE 
VICTIMS 
OF 
THE 
NAZI 
MASSACRE 
AT 
BABYN 
YAR 
IN 
UKRAINE 
BE-
TWEEN 29–30 SEPTEMBER 1941 
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 1, 2020 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
commemorate all those who lost their lives in 
the Holocaust and honor the memory of those 
who were so brutally murdered in the atroc-
ities that took place between 29–30 Sep-
tember 1941 at Babyn Yar in Ukraine. 
It is of great importance to me to bring this 
issue to the attention of the United States 
Congress because of my Jewish heritage and 
family ties to Ukraine, but also to shine a light 
on one of the darkest chapters in our shared 
history. The past must never be forgotten, and 
the lessons we learn, especially the painful 
ones, should guide us to a better future. 
As we see a resurgence of antisemitism and 
Holocaust denial across the world, and when 
there are fewer and fewer living survivors to 
tell the story first hand, it is essential that we 
learn the tragedies of the past and educate fu-
ture generations so we can prevent these 
events from never happening again. 
Today, it is critically important to remember 
one of the Holocaust’s most oft-forgotten hor-
rors—the massacre that took place at Babyn 
Yar in Ukraine and in other Eastern Europe 
countries, silenced for so long by the former 
Soviet Union. 
The massacre of Kyiv’s Jews at Babyn Yar 
was one of the largest mass killings by the 
Nazi regime at a single location during World 
War II. It is incumbent upon us to remember 
the sorrow and grief of the victims and their 
families of the Babyn Yar massacre, and I 
commend the Ukrainian people for coming to-
gether to deal with this tragedy and com-
memorate the horrific atrocity at Babyn Yar. 
In honor of the 79th anniversary of the horri-
fying massacres at Babyn Yar, where it was 
officially estimated that up to 100,000 people 
were murdered during the Nazi occupation of 
Kyiv from 1941 to 1943, I rise today to honor 
all those who lost their lives, remind our col-
leagues and the world of the tremendous evil 
that took place at Babyn Yar, and commend 
the people of Ukraine for their commitment to 
remembering these horrific events. We must 
continue to stand up and say, ‘‘never again.’’ 
A review of the timeline of events sur-
rounding the Babyn Yar tragedy are an impor-
tant part of our solemn duty to ensure that ter-
rible events like these can never happen 
again: 
On September 19, 1941, Axis forces occu-
pied Kyiv. A week later, the Nazi occupational 
government and SS leadership convened at 
Rear Headquarters Army Group South and 
made the decision to exterminate the Jews of 
Kyiv. 
On September 28, 1941, the Nazi occupiers 
of Kyiv posted the following notice: ‘‘All [Jews] 
living in the city of Kiev and its vicinity are to 
report by 8 o’clock on the morning of Monday, 
September 29, 1941, at the corner of 
Melnykova and Dokterivska Streets (near the 
cemeteries). They are to take with them docu-
ments, money, valuables, as well as warm 
clothes, underwear, etc. Any [Jew] not car-
rying out this instruction and who is found 
elsewhere will be shot. Any civilian entering 
homes vacated by [Jews] and stealing prop-
erty will be shot’’. 
On September 29–30, 1941, the eve of Yom 
Kippur, the holiest day of the year in Judaism, 
33,771 Jewish civilians were shot and killed by 
machine-gun fire at Babyn Yar, a ravine north-
west of Kyiv. Between September and early 
October 1941, about 38,000 Jews were mur-
dered at or near Babyn Yar; and the total Jew-
ish death toll there until the Nazi retreat was 
around 40,000. 
When Nazi forces retreated from the Soviet 
Union, they attempted to hide evidence of the 
massacres at Babyn Yar by exhuming the 
bodies and burning them, but in 1991, the 
government of independent Ukraine erected a 
monument in the shape of a menorah dedi-
cated to the Jewish victims at Babyn Yar. 
Sadly, the names of many of these civilians 
who perished have been lost forever. 
IN RECOGNITION OF ADAM GROGG 
HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 1, 2020 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to take this op-
portunity to recognize the extraordinary serv-
ice of Adam Grogg, who served in the 
House’s Office of General Counsel as an As-
sociate General Counsel. During his tenure, 
Mr. Grogg played an integral role in safe-
guarding the legal interests of the House of 
Representatives and its Members, Officers, 
and employees in connection with federal 
court litigation involving issues of the highest 
institutional 
importance. 
Specifically, 
Mr. 
Grogg provided invaluable legal counsel and 
representation to numerous Committees of the 
House, greatly assisting them both in fulfilling 
their constitutionally authorized oversight func-
tions and defending those prerogatives in liti-
gation. In particular, Mr. Grogg’s legal work 
has significantly contributed to the Committee 
on Oversight and Reform’s investigation and 
litigation related to the 2020 decennial census. 
Additionally, Mr. Grogg has provided vital 
legal counsel to the House regarding the pres-
idential impeachment, as well as with respect 
to the defense of long-standing institutional 
powers, including the House’s constitutional 
authority to adopt rules permitting its Members 
to participate in the legislative process re-
motely by proxy during an unprecedented 
global pandemic. 
Mr. Grogg’s work on behalf of the House 
has been of the highest caliber and I have no 
doubt that his next employer will benefit from 
his exceptional legal counsel. On behalf of the 
entire House community, I thank Mr. Grogg for 
his dedicated service to the House, and I wish 
for him the very best in all of his future en-
deavors.

five major campaigns as a member of the 14th 
Marine Regiment, 4th Marine Division. He not 
only survived the combat rigors and horrors of 
Iwo Jima, but also assaults on the Marshall Is-
lands, Saipan, Tinian, and Okinawa. All of 
these battles were some of the heaviest bat-
tles fought in the Pacific theater during World 
War II. 
The Secretary of the Navy when recom-
mending 
this 
honorary 
promotion 
said, 
‘‘Littrell’s extraordinary service to the Marine 
Corps is noteworthy and rises to the service 
that warrants favorable consideration for this 
unique honor. The recommendation to concur 
with the request is a testament to his enduring 
selflessness and sacrifice.’’ 
In addition to his service during the war, 
PFC Littrell has long served his community. 
The Marine Corps League Coquille River De-
tachment recognized PFC Littrell as their 2016 
Marine of the Year. In 2019, he was awarded 
with a Marine Corps League Distinguished 
Service Award and was also recognized as 
the Marine Corps League Marine of the Year 
for the Department of Oregon. 
PFC Littrell reliably and honorably per-
formed his duties in the Marine Corps through-
out his period of active service. PFC Littrell is 
worthy of an honorary promotion to Corporal. 
By passing this legislation, we have the oppor-
tunity to honor the notable service of this out-
standing veteran. 
This honorary promotion is championed by 
the Navy and Marine Corp and I strongly urge 
my colleagues to support this bill’s swift pas-
sage.

IN REMEMBRANCE OF GERRY 
LYNN 
HON. BRETT GUTHRIE 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 1, 2020 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in remembrance of Gerald Allen ‘‘Gerry’’ Lynn 
of Brandenburg, Kentucky. Gerry passed away 
on September 6, 2020, and I will miss him 
deeply. 
Gerry was a passionate servant of his com-
munity. He always tried to bring people to-
gether. I first met him when he served in the 
Kentucky State House of Representatives. He 
then went on to serve as the Meade County 
Judge Executive, a role in which he worked 
tirelessly to better Meade County and the re-
gion. I always enjoyed spending time with him 
because he was interested in everything—and 
he could do anything. Whether it was 
paragliding, wiring his own home, or working 
hard to help Meade County, he accomplished 
anything he put his mind to. In addition to 
serving his community, Gerry also served our 
Nation in the Army. 
Of all of Gerry’s accomplishments, he was 
proudest of his family. My prayers are with his 
wife Nancye, his children, and his grand-
children. Gerry was an honorable man and a 
pillar in our community who will be missed by 
all. 
HONORING SHELBY HAMLETT 
HON. H. MORGAN GRIFFITH 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 1, 2020 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
honor of Shelby Paisley Hamlett, who passed 
away on September 14, 2020 at the age of 
82. Shelby was dedicated to helping others in 
an array of volunteer and charitable organiza-
tions. 
Shelby was born in Wytheville, Virginia on 
August 20, 1938, to Alton and Rachael Pais-
ley. She grew up in the town and then at-
tended Hollins University, which took her to 
the Roanoke area where she would spend 
much of the rest of her life. 
Shelby was deeply devoted to several 
causes and organizations that sought to im-
prove lives in her community and around the 
world. At the age of 18, she became involved 
in the General Federation of Women’s Clubs 
(GFWC), starting with the Brambleton Jr. 
Woman’s Club in Blue Ridge District, GFWC 
Virginia. The organization became a lifelong 
commitment, and Shelby went on to serve in 
post after post, including Virginia President 
1980 to 1982 and ultimately International 
President 2000 to 2002. In this role, she 
helped develop the GFWC Leadership Edu-
cation and Development Seminar, attended 
the Women’s World Vision Conference in 
China, and participated in an Operation Smile 
Medical mission. 
Her passion for helping others extended to 
other causes. I met Shelby when I served on 
the board of Easter Seals Virginia, an organi-
zation devoted to helping Americans living 
with disabilities, which she assisted in creating 
and longed served as a member of the Board 
of Directors. She was also on the national 
Board of Directors. As the local level, she was 
part of the Roanoke County PTA Association, 
helped develop special education classes for 
the county’s schools, and was a longtime ac-
tive member and deacon at Heights Commu-
nity Church in Roanoke. 
Shelby is survived by her son David, broth-
ers Monte and Randal Paisley, and several 
nieces and nephews. I would like to extend 
my condolences to them on their loss.

STATE AND LOCAL CYBERSECU-
RITY IMPROVEMENT ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 30, 2020 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of H.R. 5823, the State and Local Cy-
bersecurity Improvement Act, which authorizes 
a new DHS grant program to address cyber-
security vulnerabilities on State and local gov-
ernment networks. 
The new grant program would be authorized 
at $400 million with a graduating cost-share 
that incentivizes States to increase funding for 
cybersecurity in their budgets. 
Under the bill, State, tribal, and territorial 
governments would be required to develop 
comprehensive cybersecurity plans to guide 
the use of grant funds. 
This bill tasks the Cybersecurity and Infra-
structure Security Agency (CISA), the Nation’s 
cyber risk advisor, that works with partners to 
defend against today’s threats and collabo-
rating to build more secure and resilient infra-
structure for the future to provide support to 
state and local governments. 
The bill also requires CISA to develop a 
strategy to improve the cybersecurity of State, 
local, 
tribal, 
and 
territorial 
governments, 
among other things, identify Federal resources 
that could be made available to State and 
local governments for cybersecurity purposes, 
and set baseline objectives for State and local 
cybersecurity efforts. 
CISA would also be required to assess the 
feasibility of implementing a short-term rota-
tional program for the detail of approved State, 
local, Tribal, and territorial government em-
ployees in cyber workforce positions at CISA. 
Lastly, the bill establishes a State and Local 
Cybersecurity 
Resiliency 
Committee 
com-
prised of representatives from State, local, 
tribal, and territorial governments to advise 
and provide situational awareness to CISA re-
garding the cybersecurity needs of such gov-
ernments. 
As a member of the House Committee on 
Homeland Security since its establishment, 
and current Ranking Member of the Judiciary 
Subcommittee 
on 
Crime, 
Terrorism 
and 
Homeland Security. This bill is of importance 
to me. 
The threats we face—digital and physical, 
man-made, technological, and natural—are 
more complex, and the threat actors more di-
verse, than at any point in our history. CISA 
is at the heart of mobilizing a collective de-
fense as we lead the Nation’s efforts to under-
stand and manage risk to our critical infra-
structure. 
I am a cosponsor of H.R. 5823, and ask my 
colleagues to join me in supporting this impor-
tant step to improving cybersecurity of state 
and local governments.

HONORING SENATOR BILL 
MONNING 
HON. JIMMY PANETTA

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 1, 2020 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I ride 
today to honor Bill Monning, the retiring Sen-
ator representing the 17th Senate District of 
California, for his career in advocacy and pub-
lic service and his commitment to serving the 
people of the central coast of California. His 
leadership has improved the lives of many, 
and I am honored to acknowledge this legacy 
today. 
Senator Monning was born in Culver City, 
California, in 1951 and raised in Pasadena. 
After finishing high school at Flintridge Pre-
paratory School, where he excelled as an ath-
lete, Monning attended college at the Univer-
sity of California, Berkeley. Following his grad-
uation, he attained his Juris Doctorate from 
the University of San Francisco. His time 
spent in the Bay Area in the 1970s led him to 
commit himself to a career of advocating for 
and serving others. 
After passing the California Bar Examina-
tion, Senator Monning worked as an attorney 
protecting the rights of migrant farm workers

at the United Farm Workers of America and 
the Migrant Farm Worker Project at California 
Rural Legal Assistance. Monning served as 
the Director of the Salvadoran Medical Relief 
Fund from 1982 through 1987 and was the 
Executive Director of the Nobel Peace Prize 
winning organization International Physicians 
for the Prevention of Nuclear War from 1987 
through 1991. Monning then went on to serve 
as a professor at the Monterey College of Law 
and Monterey Institute of International Studies 
and president and co-founder of Global Major-
ity, Inc., an organization committed to edu-
cation, training and advocacy in the field of 
non-violent conflict resolution. 
Senator Monning’s service in the California 
State Legislature began with his election as 
Assemblymember for the 27th Assembly Dis-
trict, representing parts of Monterey, Santa 
Cruz, and Santa Clara counties from 2008 to 
2012. In 2012, he was elected Senator of the 
17th Senate District, which includes all of San 
Luis Obispo and Santa Cruz counties and por-
tions of Monterey and Santa Clara counties. 
He was reelected in 2016 and served as Sen-
ate Majority Leader from 2015 through 2018. 
Currently, Monning serves as Vice Chair of 
the Joint Committee on Rules and is a mem-
ber of the Joint Legislative Audit Committee 
and the Senate Committees on Budget, 
Health, Judiciary, Natural Resources and 
Water, and Rules. He also represents the 
Senate on the California Air Resources Board. 
Throughout his time as a legislator, he has 
been a leader in protecting natural resources 
and the environment, improving the health of 
all Californians, and serving veterans. 
As Senator Monning prepares to celebrate 
his retirement, I am proud to commend him on 
his lifetime of serving others. I have no doubt 
he will enjoy spending this time with his wife, 
Dr. Dana T. Kent, his two children, and three 
grandchildren. On behalf of Central Coast resi-
dents, I ask my colleagues to join me in thank-
ing Senator Bill Monning for his public service 
and wishing him a long and healthy retire-
ment.

HONORING FRANK VARDEMAN, JR. 
HON. LUCY McBATH 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 1, 2020 
Mrs. MCBATH. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in honor of the life of Frank Burton ‘‘Burt’’ 
Vardeman, Jr., a life built on faith, service, and 
family. Mr. Vardeman passed away peacefully 
on September 13, 2020 at the age of 95. He 
is survived by his wife Martha Frances Hay 
Vardeman, their four children Frances, Frank, 
Cile, and Marty; nine grandchildren; and seven 
great-grandchildren. 
The first of four brothers, Burt was born in 
Columbus, Georgia and grew up in Covington. 
He attended public schools and graduated 
from Covington High School in 1942. During 
his freshman year at North Georgia College, 
Burt was drafted into the United States Army 
Air Corps. He served his country during World 
War II as a Flight Radio Operator on B–24 
Liberator bombers with the 15th Air Force, 
surviving 31 combat missions over Nazi-occu-
pied Europe. During one mission, Nazis de-
stroyed three of the engines on Burt’s plane, 
and he and his crewmates considered jumping 
into the Aegean Sea. Fortunately, they spotted 
an airstrip in the distance, where they landed 
and were housed by the Tuskegee Airmen, 
who frequently escorted his Bomb Group, 
while waiting for another plane. Burt frequently 
said throughout his life, ‘‘I owe my life to the 
Red Tails.’’ 
After the war, Burt came home and studied 
at Auburn University using the GI Bill, where 
he met Martha, his ‘‘Sweetie Pie.’’ Graduating 
in 1949 with a B.S. in Building Construction, 
Burt and Martha moved to Tuscaloosa, Ala-
bama to join Martha’s father, a Presbyterian 
minister who had just been named president 
of Stillman College, a historically black col-
lege. Serving as Business and Property Man-
ager at Stillman College, Burt helped the 
school become an accredited four-year institu-
tion by overseeing the construction and man-
agement of IO major campus buildings, a con-
siderable achievement during the Civil Rights 
Movement. 
Burt, Martha, and their four children moved 
to Atlanta in 1965, where Burt worked until his 
retirement in 1989. His accomplishments dur-
ing that career included overseeing the con-
struction and administration of the Pres-
byterian Church USA headquarters. In retire-
ment, he spoke of a deep gratitude for the 
heroism of the Tuskegee Airmen and was 
made an honorary Tuskegee Airman himself. 
Burt volunteered for numerous organizations, 
including North Decatur Presbyterian Church 
and Kiwanis, enjoyed golfing and fishing, and 
was an avid bowtie enthusiast. More than any-
thing, however, he cherished his family. 
Burt and Martha built a family rooted in love 
and support. He selflessly served his Amer-
ican family overseas by defending democracy 
and at home by building the foundation for a 
more just and equal future. Through his chil-
dren, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren, 
Burt’s legacy of faith, service, and family is 
destined to live on for generations. 
It is my distinct privilege to help honor and 
celebrate the storied life of Burt Vardeman. As 
his family continues to grieve this profound 
loss, I offer my deepest condolences. On be-
half of myself, the Sixth Congressional District, 
and the United States House of Representa-
tives, I am eternally grateful to Burt for his 
unbounded dedication to the betterment of hu-
manity and the overflowing passion with which 
he lived.

HONORING THE LIFE AND MIN-
ISTRY 
OF 
PASTOR 
DAVID 
E. 
KELLER OF FORT WAYNE, INDI-
ANA 
HON. JIM BANKS 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 1, 2020 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life and ministry or Pastor David E. 
Keller of Fort Wayne, Indiana, After 34 years 
of service to the Greater Fort Wayne commu-
nity, Pastor Keller is retiring from his role as 
Senior Pastor or Abundant Lire Church. 
In June of 1986, Pastor Keller began his 
ministry at a small church just across the 
street from Saint Francis College in Fort 
Wayne. Through the help of God, he sought to 
grow his church to include every culture, every 
tongue, and every nationality. After a signifi-
cant investment of his own finance and will, 
what started as an 1,800 square fool facility 
has grown to a massive 98,000 square fool fa-
cility that is completely debt free. 
Pastor Keller has established a diverse out-
reach that now ministers to 3 major ethnic 
groups: Asian, Hispanic, and African. This is in 
addition to a ministry dedicated to the deaf 
and hard of hearing, and the main weekend 
congregation. He has also helped sponsor and 
establish a Bible school and Christian orphan-
age in India, and fostered a multi-campus min-
istry in Ghana, Africa. 
Today, Pastor Keller is leaving behind a 
thriving, dynamic, and diverse congregation 
that ministers to hundreds of people each 
week. Under his leadership, the Abundant Life 
congregation has truly become a multi-cultural, 
multi-ethnic and multigenerational assembly 
who understand that ‘‘we are all level, at the 
foot or the cross.’’ 
I wish Pastor Keller, his wife Marta, and 
their children and grandchildren the very best 
as he moves on to the next chapter of his life. 
While we will sorely miss his leadership, there 
can be no doubt that many in the community 
are better off today because of his great work.

THE NOMINATION OF JUDGE AMY 
CONEY 
BARRETT 
TO 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES 
SUPREME 
COURT 
HON. LARRY BUCSHON 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 1, 2020 
Mr. BUCSHON. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to thank President Trump for nominating 
Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the United States 
Supreme Court, and urge her immediate con-
firmation. 
Currently serving on the Seventh Circuit of 
the United States Court of Appeals in South 
Bend, Indiana, Judge Barrett has shown 
throughout her highly-successful legal career 
that she has an outstanding legal mind and 
that she is more than qualified to serve on the 
Supreme Court. 
As a fellow Hoosier, I have the utmost con-
fidence that Judge Barrett would honorably 
carry out the duties of a Supreme Court Jus-
tice and would help defend the constitutional 
rights of all Americans. 
I also believe that she appropriately under-
stands the role of the Federal Judiciary in our 
Republic is to rule on the law—not to make it 
up from the bench. 
I thank Indiana’s Senators for indicating 
their support of Judge Barrett’s nomination, 
and urge the rest of the United States Senate 
to follow suit and quickly confirm this highly- 
qualified Hoosier to the bench.

friends, the co-chairs of the Democratic Wom-
en’s 
Caucus, 
Representatives 
SPEIER, 
FRANKEL, LAWRENCE, HAALAND, and ESCOBAR, 
for organizing and convening this fitting tribute 
to a trailblazing American heroine. 
As a lawyer with the ACLU and as the sec-
ond woman on the Supreme Court, Justice 
Ginsburg was a pioneer for reproductive 
rights, civil rights, and equal protection under 
the law. Without her leadership and conviction, 
the world would be a different place for 
women, people of color, the LGBTQI commu-
nity, and others who have not been afforded 
equity and justice under the law. Her tena-
cious fight for gender equality in the face of 
powerful opposition, and her historic opinions 
and dissents on the bench, bent the arc of his-
tory towards justice. 
Her legal brilliance, bravery, and her com-
mitment to a democracy that serves all, make 
her a model for the next Supreme Court Asso-
ciate Justice and for all justices who follow. 
When Justice Ginsburg wrote decisions, she 
wrote with a clarity that helped the broader 
public understand the moral and legal issues 
at stake. She also had an empathy for the ex-
periences of others. When I had the chance to 
meet and have dinner with her, I felt that she 
understood the particular challenges that 
Black women and women of color faced. And 
she was a powerful ally for justice movements 
whether they sought to dismantle unjust sys-
tems built along lines of race, ethnicity, gen-
der, class, sexual orientation or gender iden-
tity. 
We mourn the loss of such a brilliant, bold 
and visionary woman whose legacy will con-
tinue to live. We have a responsibility to con-
tinue her fight for equality and justice. 
My thoughts are with her children, grand-
children and loved ones during this difficult 
time. 
SUPPORTING AMY CONEY 
BARRETT 
HON. JAMES R. BAIRD 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 1, 2020 
Mr. BAIRD. Madam Speaker, today I rise in 
support of fellow Hoosier Amy Coney Barrett 
to be confirmed to the Supreme Court. 
Barrett is immensely qualified to serve as a 
Supreme Court justice. 
She clerked for Justice Antonin Scalia be-
fore teaching law school in Indiana at the Uni-
versity of Notre Dame, where she received the 
‘‘Distinguished Professor of the Year’’ award 
three times. 
Three years ago, she was confirmed with bi-
partisan support to the Seventh Circuit of the 
Court of Appeals. There she developed a rep-
utation of being an exemplary jurist who fol-
lows and upholds the Constitution. 
In addition to her distinguished record and 
qualifications, Mrs. Barrett is a role model for 
women. She is a devoted wife and a loving 
mother to seven children, while still effectively 
performing her responsibilities as a justice. 
Judge Barrett will be an excellent addition to 
the United States Supreme Court, and I look 
forward to her confirmation without delay.

HONORING SUPERVISOR JANE 
PARKER 
HON. JIMMY PANETTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 1, 2020 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Jane Parker, the retiring County Su-
pervisor for the Fourth District of Monterey 
County, for her commitment to serving the 
people of the central coast of California. 
Supervisor Parker was raised on the Mon-
terey Peninsula and graduated from Monterey 
High School. After studying at the Monterey 
Institute 
for 
International 
Studies 
and 
LaVarenne Cooking School and traveling 
across Europe, Parker made a name for her-
self as a chef in southern California, where 
she lived for 15 years. After travelling through 
Asia and Africa, Parker felt it was time to re-
turn home and settled in Monterey once again 
in 1991. There, she established a healthy 
meal preparation service for working families 
and homebound seniors. 
Back at home on the Central Coast, Super-
visor Parker felt a responsibility to give back to 
her community. In 1995, she began working 
for Planned Parenthood Mar Monte, eventually 
serving as vice president of development until 
2005. As part of the organization’s executive 
leadership team, Parker helped Planned Par-
enthood Mar Monte serve a record number of 
patients and earn it the title of most successful 
Planned Parenthood in the nation. During this 
time, Parker ran for and was elected to serve 
on the Monterey Peninsula College (MPC) 
Board of Trustees from 1999 to 2003. As a 
Trustee, she effectively advocatd for policies 
to protect MPC’s reputation for providing out-
standing and affordable education and student 
services. From 2005 to 2009, Parker was As-
sociate Director of the ACTION Council of 
Monterey County, where she helped address 
unmet needs in the county and improve the 
quality of life for residents through the pursuit 
of economic and social justice. 
Supervisor Parker was first elected as 
County Supervisor for the Fourth District of 
Monterey County in 2008 and reelected in 
2012 to 2016. As a County Supervisor, Parker 
has prioritized delivering responsible land-use 
policies, equitable healthcare access and high- 
quality healthcare services, water and mass 
transit solutions, increased accountability and 
customer service for County services, and pre-
vention-based law enforcement strategies. As 
a result of efforts she has led, the Board now 
posts Agenda packets online for the public to 
view and conducts performance evaluations of 
the Chief Administrative Officer and other di-
rect reports. 
As she begins her retirement, I have no 
doubt that Jane will continue to serve her 
community. We, on the Central Coast, are 
grateful for her contributions to our community 
and celebrate her successful career.
