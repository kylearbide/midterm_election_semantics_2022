Let us pray. 
God of our forebears, author of lib-
erty, we lift our hearts in praise. 
Thank You for the opportunity to wit-
ness a renewal of democracy and an or-
derly transition of power. Lord, we 
know this orderly transition was not 
inevitable, for only Your grace saved 
us. 
Mighty God, let the healing begin; 
bless our incoming Senators. Give wis-
dom and courage to President Joseph 
R. Biden and Vice President KAMALA 
HARRIS for the living of these days. 
And, Lord, long may our land be bright

by Your might, great God our King. 
We pray in Your sovereign Name. 
Amen.

f 
MAIDEN SPEECH 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I need 
to catch my breath, so much has hap-
pened. 
A few hours ago, on the West Front 
of this citadel of democracy, Joe Biden 
and KAMALA HARRIS were administered 
the oaths of Office to the Presidency 
and Vice Presidency of the United 
States. We have turned the page to a 
new chapter in the history of our de-
mocracy, and I am full of hope. 
I would challenge anyone not to feel 
hopeful today after listening to Aman-
da Gorman, the amazing 22–year-old 
poet, wise far beyond her years, who 
told us that: 
Somehow we’ve weathered and witnessed 
a nation that isn’t broken 
but simply unfinished 
The 
hope 
she 
spoke 
about—the 
strong and happy hope—the hope we 
feel today, is a hope, of course, that is 
tempered by reality. This was an inau-
guration 
unlike 
most 
others. 
The 
crowds that customarily line the Na-
tional Mall were absent, a reminder 
that our Nation is still in the throes of 
a deadly pandemic. 
The presence of thousands of Na-
tional Guardsmen, police, and Secret 
Service was a reminder that 2 weeks 
ago, in this very room and on those 
very steps where President Biden took 
the oath, a mob of violent criminals 
tried to dismantle our democracy—our 
sacred democracy—brick by brick and 
would try again if they could. 
But, as President Biden said a few 
hours ago, today, democracy has pre-
vailed, the will of the people was heed-
ed, and the peaceful transfer of power 
fulfilled. It takes a lot more than a 
band of hooligans to bring our grand 
democracy down. 
Let it be a message to our friends and 
adversaries around the world that our 
democracy, though it has been tried 
and been tested, shall long endure. And 
let it be a message to those terrorists 
who desecrated this temple of democ-
racy that they will never prevail. 
Joe Biden is now the 46th President 
of the United States. KAMALA HARRIS is 
now the 49th Vice President of the 
United States. But, of course, in more 
ways than one, she is not the 49th but 
the first—the first African-American 
woman, 
the 
first 
Asian-American 
woman, and the first woman, period, to 
hold the Office of Vice Presidency in 
our Nation’s history. 
Today, the threat to our democracy 
from the Presidency itself has ended, 
but the challenges we face as a nation 
remain. In the wake of violence and di-
vision, hatred and mistruth, in the 
shadow of disease and economic hard-
ship, a warming planet and unequal so-
ciety, we begin the work of the 117th 
Congress. 
In his inaugural address, President 
Biden spoke to this moment—a mo-
ment of great challenge—and told us 
two simple truths: One, that our re-
sponsibilities are numerous, and, two, 
it will take unity—unity of spirit, 
unity of purpose—to fulfill them. 
President Biden, we heard you loud 
and clear. We have a lengthy agenda, 
and we need to get it done together. 
President Biden pointed the way to 
our Nation’s recovery and renewal. He 
reminded us of who we are and where 
we need to go, but we must now turn 
the spirit of his words into action. 
The Senate must immediately set to 
work on the mission President Biden 
described—restoring the greatness and 
goodness of America. This will be an 
exceptionally busy and consequential 
period for the U.S. Senate. There is 
much to do, and we are ready to get to 
work. 
Now, not to upstage our new Presi-
dent and Vice President, but theirs has 
not been the only swearing in today. A 
few moments ago, the Senate wel-
comed three new Members to this 
Chamber. I can now happily and proud-
ly call them Senator PADILLA, Senator 
OSSOFF, and Senator WARNOCK. They 
join Senators KELLY, HICKENLOOPER, 
and LUJA´ N as part of a six-Member 
class of Democratic Senators and a new 
Democratic Senate majority. 
I mention the historic nature of Vice 
President HARRIS’ ascendance, but let’s 
not forget that her successor, ALEX 
PADILLA, is the first Latino Senator to 
represent 
California; 
that 
RAFAEL 
WARNOCK, born while Georgia was rep-
resented in this Chamber by two 
staunch segregationists, is now the 
first African-American Senator Geor-
gia has ever elected; and that JOHN 
OSSOFF
is the first Jewish Senator 
from his State, sworn in today on a 
book of Hebrew Scripture once owned 
by the rabbi, who, decades ago, formed 
a bond between the Jewish and Afri-
can-American communities of Georgia. 
As President Biden said in his inau-
gural address, ‘‘don’t tell me things 
can’t change.’’ With the swearing in of 
these three Senators, the Senate will 
turn to Democratic control, for which I 
deeply thank my colleagues. We will 
return to Democratic control under the 
first New York-born majority leader in 
American history—a kid from Brook-
lyn, the son of an exterminator and a 
housewife, and a descendant of victims 
of the Holocaust. 
That I should be the leader of this 
new Senate majority is an awesome re-
sponsibility—awesome in the Biblical 
sense, as the angels that tremble in 
awe before God. Today, I feel the full 
weight of that responsibility, a sense of 
reverence and of awe at the trust 
placed in me. I intend to honor that 
trust with all of my energy and with 
joy. 
And as the majority changes in the 
Senate, the Senate will do business dif-
ferently. The Senate will address the 
challenges our country faces head on 
and without delay, not with timid solu-
tions but with boldness and with cour-
age. The Senate will tackle the perils 
of the moment, a once-in-a-generation 
health and economic crisis, and it will 
strive to make progress on genera-
tions-long struggle for racial justice, 
economic justice, equality of oppor-
tunity, and equality under the law. 
And make no mistake, the Senate 
will forcefully, consistently, and ur-
gently address the greatest threat to 
this country and to our planet: climate 
change. 
This Senate will legislate. It will be 
active, responsive, energetic, and bold. 
And to my Republican colleagues, 
when and where we can, the Demo-
cratic majority will strive to make this 
important work bipartisan. The Senate 
works best when we work together. We 
have no choice. 
The challenges we face are great. The 
divisions in the country are real. We 
have no choice but to try to work to-
gether every day to reward the faith 
the American people have placed in us. 
So let us begin. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Republican leader.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S66 
January 20, 2021 
59TH INAUGURATION CEREMONIES 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
today, before the American people and 
the world, the peaceful transfer of 
power that has helped define our Na-
tion for more than 230 years was car-
ried out. We swore in the 46th Presi-
dent and the 49th Vice President of the 
United States. 
President Biden and Vice President 
HARRIS are both alumni of the U.S. 
Senate. They are well known to us in 
this Chamber. They begin their terms 
with both challenges and opportunities 
before them, and with the prayers of 
our whole Nation at their backs. 
President Biden made unity the 
major theme of his inaugural address. 
He pledged to be a President for all 
Americans, to work as hard for the 
many millions of Americans who did 
not support his candidacy as he will for 
the millions who did. So I congratulate 
my friend from Delaware. I look for-
ward to working with him as our new 
President wherever possible. 
Our country deserves for both sides, 
both parties, to find common ground 
for the common good everywhere that 
we can and disagree respectfully where 
we must. Last fall, the American peo-
ple chose to elect a narrowly divided 
House of Representatives, a 50–50 Sen-
ate, and a President who promised 
unity. The people intentionally en-
trusted both political parties with sig-
nificant power to shape our Nation’s 
direction. May we work together to 
honor that trust. 
Earlier today, I was honored to 
present our former colleague, Vice 
President HARRIS, with a flag that flew 
over her historic swearing in as our Na-
tion’s first woman Vice President. This 
groundbreaking 
achievement 
elicits 
national pride that transcends politics. 
All citizens can applaud the fact that 
this new three-word phrase, ‘‘Madam 
Vice President,’’ is now a part of our 
American lexicon. So, once again, our 
sincere congratulations to our former 
colleague from California on this day. 
I also join my colleagues in warmly 
welcoming our three newest Senators. 
Senator PADILLA of California and Sen-
ators OSSOFF and WARNOCK of Georgia 
have been sent to this Chamber by 
their home States to represent their 
neighbors and to serve our Nation. We 
have plenty of Senate business to dis-
cuss at length in the days ahead, but, 
for now, I just want to congratulate 
each of our new colleagues. I look for-
ward to working alongside them. 
f 
RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under 
the previous order, the leadership time 
is reserved. 
f 
MORNING BUSINESS 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under 
the previous order, the Senate will be 
in a period of morning business, with 
Senators permitted to speak therein 
for up to 10 minutes each. 
The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, 2 
minutes to speak, please, for two pur-
poses. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Iowa is recognized. 
f 
59TH INAUGURATION CEREMONIES 
Mr. GRASSLEY. One, I congratulate 
my friend, PATRICK
LEAHY
for once 
again assuming the position of Presi-
dent pro tempore after 6 years of ab-
sence, I believe, and also to express my 
working relationship with him in the 
40 years that he and I have served to-
gether in the U.S. Senate. 
But also to the fourth estate, because 
we always read about rancor on tele-
vision, radio, and print—they never 
speak about how Senators get along. 
We have seen a peaceful transfer of 
leadership position in the U.S. Senate, 
from a Senator from Kentucky to a 
Senator from New York. 
Now, for the first purpose of rising, 
because most of my colleagues don’t 
know, when there is nobody on the 
Senate and I open the Senate up for 
prayer and for the Pledge of Alle-
giance, I usually give a 1-minute 
speech. And I would like to give my 
last 1-minute speech as President pro 
tempore. I am not saying that I won’t 
take advantage of that opportunity 
when nobody else is around, as well. 
Four years ago, our Nation’s Capital 
was full of people who had come to cel-
ebrate a new President’s inauguration, 
and it was full of people who came to 
protest the winner of that election. 
This Biden inauguration was dif-
ferent in that respect. But this year, 
just like 4 years ago, there are Ameri-
cans who question the election out-
come and did not want the inaugura-
tion to proceed. Since election day, I 
have urged Americans to have faith in 
our constitutional system and let the 
Constitution work the way it has for 
240 years—work its course. Today was 
the culmination of that process. 
Like 4 years ago, I know that many 
Americans are not happy with how it 
turned out. That is absolutely fine, 
just like 4 years ago was fine for those 
people that resisted. 
In our country, nobody is obliged to 
like or support a President, but, hope-
fully, people will really respect the Of-
fice of the Presidency, regardless who 
holds it. 
However, 
while 
the 
Presidency 
changed hands, I hope we can retire, 
hashtag ‘‘resist.’’ 
You wouldn’t know it listening to 
partisan commentators from the right 
or left, but you do not have to make a 
choice between giving your President 
unqualified support or total opposition 
to the President. 
As a legislator, I would be doing a 
disservice to those I represent if I did 
either unqualified support for a Repub-
lican President or total opposition to a 
Democratic President. In my work on 
behalf of Iowans, I have to engage with 
the administration of the day if I want 
to be a responsible Senator. 
As I have with every President, I will 
seek to find common ground with 
President Biden wherever possible, but 
I will strongly oppose policies that I 
think are not good for Iowa and all 
Americans. That will be on input that 
I receive from my fellow Iowans. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I sug-
gest the absence of a quorum. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded.

DREAM ACT 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, earlier 
today I was proud to join my col-
leagues in witnessing the inauguration 
of President Joe Biden and Vice Presi-
dent KAMALA HARRIS on the west front 
of the U.S. Capitol. 
I remembered, as I walked away from 
that inauguration ceremony, the expe-
rience I had 4 years ago. There was a 
luncheon. Traditionally there is a 
luncheon given for the new President 
and Vice President. That luncheon was 
my first opportunity to meet President 
Donald Trump. I had never met him be-
fore. 
I went up to him at the head table, 
and I introduced myself and said: I just 
want to tell you that I am working in 
the U.S. Senate for the DREAM Act. I 
believe that these Dreamers deserve a 
chance to become part of America’s fu-
ture. 
President Donald Trump, minutes 
after having taken the oath of office, 
said: Senator, don’t worry about those 
young people. We will take care of 
them. 
That was my first conversation with 
President 
Trump. 
What 
transpired 
afterwards is a matter of record in the 
history of this country. We know also 
what happened in this Capitol Building 
just 2 weeks ago. 
That is why this inauguration was so 
different. We were battling a deadly 
virus and possibly a deadly attack by 
American terrorists. The U.S. Capitol 
was as closely guarded as I have ever 
seen it. We estimate that 25,000 sol-
diers—National Guard and Active-Duty 
soldiers—were in town to protect us 
from all around the United States, in-
cluding 260 from the State of Illinois, I 
am very proud to announce. They did 
their job and did it well. I thank them 
for their service and sacrifice and sepa-
ration from their families. But at the 
same time, we are facing a deadly 
virus. In the midst of a global pan-
demic, today’s celebration had to be 
tempered so that people were safe from 
wherever they sat and from wherever 
they gathered.

faces a unique set of circumstances. 
They also understand that we are a 
unique nation. What makes us special 
is that people from all over the world 
come to our shores to become Ameri-
cans, not because of their race or eth-
nicity but because they embrace Amer-
ica’s values. 
Never before in American history 
have those ideals been tested as they 
have been in the last 4 years. A hall-
mark of the former administration was 
a relentless attack on immigrants. One 
of the main targets were the very 
Dreamers whom I spoke to President 
Trump about, young immigrants who 
came to the United States as children. 
It was 11 years ago that I joined with 
then-Senator Dick Lugar of Indiana on 
a bipartisan basis to call on President 
Obama to use his legal authority to 
protect Dreamers from deportation. 
Our argument was simple: These young 
people were brought to the United 
States as children. Their parents made 
the decision to come here. They grew 
up here, went to school here, pledged 
allegiance to that very flag every day 
in their classrooms, and believed they 
were part of this country. 
Usually sometime in their teenage 
years, their parents sat down with 
them and told them the grim reality: 
They have no country—not the one 
they left nor the one they currently 
live in. 
So I introduced legislation 20 years 
ago, the DREAM Act, in an effort to 
give them a chance, a chance to earn 
their way to legal status and citizen-
ship, but I have been unable to enact 
that into law in both the House and the 
Senate in any given year. I have been 
stymied and stopped by the filibuster 
too many times. 
President Obama knew that. When he 
was a Senator here before being elected 
to be President, he was a cosponsor of 
my DREAM Act, so I knew where his 
heart was and I appealed to him—could 
he do something. And he did. He cre-
ated DACA. 
DACA, by Executive order, provided 
temporary protection from deportation 
to Dreamers. If they register with the 
government, pay a fee, and pass a 
criminal and national security back-
ground check, they could have a tem-
porary right to work here in the United 
States and be free from deportation. 
More than 800,000 Dreamers came for-
ward with President Obama’s DACA. 
DACA unleashed the full potential of 
these Dreamers, who are contributing 
to our country this very day as sol-
diers, teachers, and business owners. In 
the midst of the COVID–19 pandemic, 
more than 200,000 DACA recipients 
have been characterized as ‘‘essential 
critical infrastructure workers’’ during 
this pandemic. That wasn’t my des-
ignation; it was the designation of the 
Trump administration. Among those 
essential workers are 41,700 DACA re-
cipients in the healthcare industry— 
doctors, intensive care nurses, para-
medics, and respiratory therapists. 
Well, on September 5, 2017, former 
President Trump repealed DACA. Hun-
dreds of thousands of Dreamers faced 
losing their work permits and being de-
ported to countries they barely remem-
bered, if they remembered them at all. 
Last summer, the Supreme Court re-
jected President Trump’s effort to end 
deportation protection for Dreamers. 
In an opinion by Chief Justice John 
Roberts, the Court held that the Presi-
dent’s attempt to rescind DACA was 
‘‘arbitrary and capricious.’’ 
Today, in one of his first official acts, 
President Joseph Biden signed an Exec-
utive order to restore DACA. I am eter-
nally grateful for President Biden’s 
courage and commitment in keeping 
his word. Without DACA, hundreds of 
thousands of talented young people 
who have grown up in our country can-
not continue their work and risk de-
portation every single day. 
But the resumption of DACA is just 
the first step toward long-overdue jus-
tice for Dreamers. Only legislation 
passed by Congress can provide a path 
to citizenship to the Dreamers. I first 
introduced the bipartisan DREAM Act 
20 years ago, as I mentioned, and I will 
continue to do so until it becomes the 
law of the land. 
I am honored that I have a chance to 
serve as chairman of the Senate Judici-
ary Committee in the 117th Congress. 
As a child of an immigrant myself, I 
never dreamed that I would be blessed 
with the opportunity to lead the com-
mittee that writes our Nation’s immi-
gration laws. 
To all of the Dreamers out there, I 
have told you many times: I have never 
given up on you; don’t give up on me. 
I am going to pass the DREAM Act. 
Over the years, I have come to the 
floor with the most persuasive ap-
proach I can think of to pass the 
DREAM Act and make it the law of the 
land. I tell their stories. These stories 
show what is at stake when we consider 
DACA and the DREAM Act. It is not a 
theory. It is not just a law. These are 
real, human lives. 
Today I want to tell you about Hina 
Naveed. She is the 127th Dreamer 
whose story I have told on the floor of 
the Senate. 
Hina was born in Pakistan and came 
to the United States from Dubai when 
she was 10 years old. She grew up in 
Fall River, MA. 
She sent me a letter, and here is 
what she said about growing up: 
I had a pretty typical experience navi-
gating a new country and new school system. 
It wasn’t until I turned 16 and my peers were 
getting their permits and their first jobs 
that I really felt the impact of being undocu-
mented. 
Hina was an excellent student. In 
high school, she was president of the 
National Honor Society and Key Club. 
She graduated as the salutatorian of 
her class, ranked second out of 350 stu-
dents with a 4.0 GPA. She received the 
Outstanding Vocational Student for 
Health Careers Award and Overall Out-
standing Vocational Student Award. 
She went to the City University of 
New York College of Staten Island, 
where she earned associate’s degrees in 
liberal arts and nursing and a bachelor 
of science in nursing. She studied at 
CUNY Law School, where she grad-
uated with a law degree. 
Thanks to DACA, Hina became a reg-
istered nurse. She worked as director 
of health services for a nonprofit, com-
munity-based 
organization 
in 
New 
York. 
Her 
department 
provides 
healthcare services for children in fos-
ter care, many of whom are victims of 
medical neglect. She is also a member 
of the New York City Medical Reserve 
Corps. At the height of the pandemic, 
she volunteered on weekends at a hos-
pital and at a residential facility with 
COVID–19 patients. 
Hina wrote to me about her plans: 
I want to work on health policy reform at 
a local and state level in an effort to achieve 
health equity for all. This pandemic has 
highlighted health disparities that have long 
existed, and I want to be part of making the 
change I want to see and experience. 
Here is what Hina said about DACA 
and what it meant to her: 
DACA has been life-changing. It has al-
lowed me to drive, work, achieve fiscal inde-
pendence, continue higher education, and 
contribute to my community more than I 
would have been able to otherwise. However, 
it is temporary, and with the benefits it pro-
vides, it has also cast a shadow over my life, 
forcing me to plan my life in 2–year incre-
ments. 
Well, let me start by saying thank 
you to her, to Hina Naveed, for her 
service 
on 
the 
frontlines 
of 
the 
coronavirus pandemic. All of us are in 
awe of our healthcare heroes. She is an 
immigrant healthcare hero. She is a 
DACA healthcare hero. She has put 
herself and her family at risk to pro-
tect others. She also shouldn’t have to 
worry about being deported tomorrow 
and her family facing division. 
Will America be a stronger country if 
we just up and deport her or if she be-
came an American citizen? I think the 
choice is clear. 
Hina and hundreds of thousands of 
other Dreamers are counting on those 
of us who serve in the Senate. So here 
is where we stand. The Senate Judici-
ary Committee will soon organize—I 
hope very soon—and I will have an op-
portunity to appeal to my colleagues 
on both sides of the table to join me in 
a bipartisan effort to pass the DREAM 
Act. 
President Biden has made it his clear 
priority, and I share it. I want this to 
be the first measure that we consider 
in the area of immigration. But I know 
we live in a 50–50 Senate, and it is pos-
sible that once again I will need to 
muster 60 votes to pass this on the 
floor. So, whatever we do, it has to be 
bipartisan. That means it won’t have 
everything in it that I want or every-
thing that maybe Hina or the advo-
cates want, but we have to take a step 
forward once and for all to help these 
young people. 
As long as I am a Senator, I will con-
tinue to fight for Hina Naveed and for 
people who have come to this country 
just to make it better. It would be an

American tragedy to deport this brave 
and talented healthcare professional in 
the midst of a pandemic. We must en-
sure that she and hundreds of thou-
sands of our essential workforce are 
not forced to stop contributing when 
the need for their service has never 
been greater, and we must give them 
the chance they deserve to become 
American citizens. 
I 
cannot 
express 
my 
gratitude 
enough for President Biden, in the first 
hours that he was in office, recognizing 
the needs of the DACA recipients and 
the Dreamers. I want to work with him 
and work with both parties across the 
aisle to make this dream come true for 
so many who deserve it. They have 
waited long enough. 
I yield the floor.

f 
NOMINATION OF AVRIL HAINES 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, for the 
information of other Senators who 
want to know if we have a vote tonight 
specifically on the nomination of Avril 
Haines to be Director of National Intel-
ligence, I was the last person to object 
to holding that vote. I no longer object. 
I wanted to have a question for the 
record answered. Miss Haines, thank-
fully, responded to my question yester-
day. I want to thank Senator RUBIO 
and Senator WARNER for helping us get 
that answer. 
Specifically, in her open session yes-
terday, she gave an answer to Senator 
WYDEN that suggested the intelligence 
community might reopen investiga-
tions into detention interrogation pro-
grams from 2001 to 2006. She clarified, 
in the private setting that we had, that 
she had no intention to open up those 
investigations and expose operations 
officers inside the CIA to criminal 
prosecution or adverse employment ac-
tion or even holding it against them in 
potential 
future 
promotions 
or 
placements. 
She has confirmed that in the writ-
ten record. I am glad to see that we are 
not going to reopen that period. 
I want to thank Ms. Haines for pro-
viding the answer. 
Most importantly, I want to thank 
our brave operations and paramilitary 
operations officers in the CIA for what 
they do, always, to keep this country 
safe. I am ready to vote on this nomi-
nation. I believe the rest of the Senate 
is as well. 
I yield back the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, at noon 
today, Joe Biden was sworn in as our 
new President. I never served with 
President Biden when he was a Sen-
ator, but I can tell you, from direct and 
firsthand experience, that he is a man 
of tremendous empathy. I have wit-
nessed it. And so I pray that God will 
bless him with strength, with health, 
and with wisdom, because I don’t need 
to tell anyone that we, in our Nation, 
are living in troubled times. 
President Trump was elected and 
then, in this last cycle, received 75 mil-
lion votes, in part because he spoke to 
and was brutally honest about some of 
the grievances and the fears that are 
now dividing our country. It is impor-
tant to understand that he didn’t cre-
ate them, and that is why his exit 
alone is not going to make America 
normal again. 
The troubles we face and the things 
that now divide us really aren’t so 
much about politics or about ideology. 
If you look into them, they are really 
more about the things that are at the 
core of our identity as a nation and as 
a people. 
Our people want a country where ev-
erybody has the opportunity to find a 
good job, to get married, to live in a 
safe neighborhood, to not go into debt 
because they have a baby, to send their 
kids to a good school, and one day to 
retire with dignity and security. But 
we have millions of Americans who in-
creasingly feel that that kind of life 
and those kinds of things are out of 
reach for them, and they are really 
frustrated that neither those in gov-
ernment or either political party seem 
to be doing much about them. 
The people need a sense of belonging 
and purpose, but the places that we 
used to get that from—our families, 
the community groups we joined, the 
synagogues, the churches—many of 
them are in collapse. So now you have 
millions of people who feel isolated or 
alienated and some who are turning to 
hyperpartisan politics and even online 
conspiracy cults to fill the void that 
those institutions once filled. 
The overwhelming majority of Amer-
icans reject racism and bigotry and dis-
crimination. But they also reject iden-
tity politics, which constantly seems 
to want to divide us against and apart 
from each other on the basis of race 
and ethnicity and gender. 
We are a nation that is proud of our 
heritage as a nation of immigrants, but 
millions of Americans—I would say the 
majority—also believe we are a nation 
that has to have immigration laws. 
They need to be followed, and they 
need to be enforced. 
Most Americans accept that our 
country, our society is changing, and 
they understand that there are people 
with different views and different ways 
of life. What they do resent is efforts to 
demonize and to persecute those who 
hold the traditional values that are in-
herited from our Judeo-Christian herit-
age. 
Most Americans believe decency and 
morality require that everyone is enti-
tled to dignity and to respect. But 
there are also many growing increas-
ingly tired of walking on eggshells of 
political correctness and forced to un-
dergo sensitivity training because ev-
eryone seems to be so easily offended 
these days by everything. 
People understand that we have to do 
something. It is a problem. We have do 
something about people who use social 
media to spread dangerous lies, to in-
stigate violence. But I think they also 
have a right to be very troubled that 
five CEOs of technology companies— 
five people in five companies, elected 
by no one, accountable to no one—have 
the power, if they so choose, to wipe 
out, to silence anyone—even a Presi-
dent. 
And I would tell you that, almost 
without exception, they were horri-
fied—horrified—about what happened 
here 2 weeks ago today. They want 
those people in jail. But they also won-
der: Where was that outrage when this 
summer, in multiple cities, across a 
number of months, there were people 
setting fire to police cars and breaking 
into police stations and attacking 
courthouses and looting private prop-
erty? 
I will tell you that they see firsthand 
every day the extraordinary damage 
being done by this terrible pandemic 
and the damage being done by our bit-
ter divisions, which, frankly, I think 
most Americans will never understand 
why the first thing we are going to do 
here, potentially, is an impeachment 
trial of a President who isn’t even in 
office anymore. 
What happened today was incredibly 
important. The pageantry, the rituals 
behind it—it matters. And for the 59th 
time in our history, we peacefully 
transferred power from one leader to 
the next. I think the fact that that 
happened on the very steps of this Cap-
itol, where just 2 weeks ago on this day 
we saw an unimaginable attack on de-
mocracy, that should serve as a re-
minder to all of us in this country and 
a powerful message to the world that 
our Republic remains resilient. 
But now the hard work of self-gov-
ernment begins, and these anxieties I 
have just described—the tens of mil-
lions of Americans—need to be ac-
knowledged, and they need to be ad-
dressed. If they are ignored, if they are 
allowed to fester, what it will do is it 
will leave us not just a nation that is 
paralyzed and can’t take action on im-
portant issues; we are going to be left 
a nation that remains vulnerable to 
those who are willing to exploit and 
stir the most destructive impulses. 
Today, President Biden struck im-
portant tones of national unity, and I 
believe they were sincere. But pursuing 
a radical agenda in a country so di-
vided does not serve the cause of unity. 
It will only serve cynicism that de-
stroys trust. 
By the same token, continuing to fan 
the flames of grievances or, in the al-
ternative, 
pursuing 
vengeance 
dis-
guised as accountability will not serve 
the cause of unity either. That is noth-
ing but the politics of resentment and

retribution, which only leads to a frac-
tured nation of people who literally 
come to hate each other. 
Demanding that the other side in a 
debate on a topic, on a principle, agree 
with you on everything isn’t unity. 
That is the arrogance of believing that 
any of us—that we are the sole holders 
of the truth: Anyone who agrees with 
us is good, and anyone who disagrees 
with us is wrong—not just wrong but, 
actually, evil. 
The truth is that real unity isn’t ev-
eryone having the same ideology or the 
same views or the same ideas. The 
unity we need actually comes from re-
membering—remembering who we ac-
tually are. 
We Americans are not a racist or na-
tivist people. We are a good and com-
passionate people who—in an over-
whelming majority, they do not ask 
about race when they donate un-
wrapped toys so that no child has to 
wake up on Christmas morning with no 
present under the tree. They don’t ask 
where a soldier’s or sailor’s or airman’s 
or airwoman’s parents came from when 
they put together and send care pack-
ages to them halfway around the world 
that they defend. We Americans are a 
bold people. In our veins literally runs 
the blood of pilgrims, of settlers, of ex-
iles, of immigrants, of people who over-
came slavery and segregation. We are 
the descendants of people who refused 
to surrender to fear and to abandon the 
hope of a better life. 
We Americans are not the inheritors 
of an American dream that is some 
prize that we have to fight against one 
another for in some winner-take-all 
competition. We are the inheritors of 
an American dream that anyone can 
achieve without it being denied to 
someone else. 
This is who we were when this coun-
try inspired and changed the world, 
and I hope this is who we will be again: 
a people who disagree over principles, 
who argue over policies—that has to 
happen because our Republic depends 
on every view having a voice and every 
voice having a place to be heard—but 
also a people who now understand that 
the choice before us is, we will either 
find a way to share a nation and a fu-
ture, or we will all share the con-
demnation of history and the rebuke of 
Americans yet to come. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sen-
ior Senator from Oregon. 
f 
NOMINATION OF AVRIL DANICA 
HAINES 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise to 
discuss the nomination of Avril Danica 
Haines to be Director of National Intel-
ligence. I think my colleagues know 
that in a few minutes, the Senate will 
be voting on her nomination for this 
key position. 
I briefly intend to outline where I 
think things stand on several sensitive 
issues with the 18 agencies that make 
up the intelligence community. 
The Biden administration and Ms. 
Haines have an opportunity and a duty 
to turn the page on the coverups and 
lawlessness of the outgoing administra-
tion. That is why I asked Ms. Haines at 
her confirmation hearing whether she 
would abide by a law that I authored 
requiring an unclassified report on who 
was responsible for the killing of Wash-
ington 
Post 
journalist 
Jamal 
Khashoggi. 
Jamal Khashoggi was a U.S. resident 
who was lured to the Saudi consulate 
in Istanbul and brutally murdered. De-
spite press stories that the Saudi Ara-
bian leader was responsible for the kill-
ing, the Trump administration stayed 
mum, just stonewalled. For a whole 
year, the Trump administration just 
ignored the law that I wrote. So I 
asked Ms. Haines at our hearing wheth-
er she would follow the law and provide 
that unclassified report on who was re-
sponsible for Jamal Khashoggi’s mur-
der. Ms. Haines’ response was straight-
forward. She said she would provide the 
report and comply with the law. 
That statement, frankly, as modest 
as it was, was a sea change, colleagues, 
from 
the 
obstructionism 
and 
stonewalling of the Trump administra-
tion. The Trump administration had 
basically taken the position on laws 
like this transparency measure that it 
was kind of optional for the executive 
branch to comply. 
So Ms. Haines’ direct commitment to 
making that key report on the role the 
Saudi leaders in the murder of Jamal 
Khashoggi, in my view, was a real step 
forward for the rule of law, for ac-
countability, and for human rights. 
And I will say as a journalist’s kid that 
it was a real step forward for the free-
dom of the press everywhere. 
The second subject I discussed with 
Ms. Haines was a particularly trou-
bling aspect of the CIA’s recent his-
tory. The CIA spied on the staff of the 
Senate Intelligence Committee when 
the staff was writing the torture re-
port. As Deputy Director, Ms. Haines 
didn’t hold anyone accountable. In my 
view, this abuse, this spying on the 
Senate Select Committee on Intel-
ligence, basically, colleagues, turns the 
whole concept of oversight on its head. 
The U.S. Congress is supposed to do 
oversight on the executive branch and 
not visa-versa. 
In response to my questions at the 
hearing, Ms. Haines admitted that the 
spying on the committee was wrong. 
She also agreed that she supported rec-
ommendations 
to 
expand 
account-
ability and would apply that expanded 
accountability to the intelligence com-
munity at large. And when she was 
asked about the CIA’s baseless efforts 
to have committee staff prosecuted, 
she agreed that there ought to be 
guardrails 
against 
that 
happening 
again. 
The third area I explored with the 
nominee was the need to rebuild trust 
in the intelligence community, which, 
in my view, requires a new focus on 
transparency and openness. For exam-
ple, there ought to be transparency so 
that the American people know what 
kind of surveillance is being conducted 
on them. The President of the Senate 
knows about the important vote we 
had on that amendment that I offered, 
the bipartisan amendment with Sen-
ator DAINES, because we ought to get 
transparency on whether the govern-
ment is spying on the browsing history 
of the American people. 
So this is really a critical and grow-
ing concern because we are all seeing 
data brokers and others selling people’s 
data, and it is especially important 
that the American people are told if 
the government is using a legal loop-
hole in the law in the warrant require-
ment of the Fourth Amendment. So I 
asked Ms. Haines about circumstances 
in which the government, instead of 
getting an order, just goes out and pur-
chases the private records of Ameri-
cans from these sleazy and unregulated 
commercial data brokers who are sim-
ply above the law—literally above the 
law. I believe this practice is unaccept-
able, and soon I will be introducing leg-
islation to make it clear that the 
Fourth Amendment is not for sale. 
Now, for Congress to tackle the 
topic, it is vitally important that there 
be an informed public debate about 
what the government is collecting 
right now and what it believes is a 
legal basis for the collection. And I was 
encouraged by how Ms. Haines re-
sponded to that question I asked. She 
said it was critical that the American 
people have an understanding of when 
and under what authorities the govern-
ment is buying their private data. 
Now, Ms. Haines made a number of 
other commitments related to trans-
parency issues, many of which relate to 
a problem that I have come to describe 
as ‘‘secret law.’’ 
To my colleagues—I see our new 
Members here—people think when a 
law is written, they go to a coffee shop 
in Atlanta or Athens or Tucson, and 
they read about a law, and they think 
that is what the public law says. But 
secret law is based on the proposition 
that after the public law is put in 
place, the government often reinter-
prets the public law in secret and keeps 
the new interpretation secret under the 
pretext that this secrecy is just so key 
to keeping Americans safe. 
The reality is that the interpretation 
of public law ought to be transparent 
and public as well, and it comes down 
to a very straightforward principle. I 
am a strong opponent of secret law. I 
am a strong supporter of transparency. 
And I intend to remind Director Haines 
what she told me just a few days ago 
about transparency and to push hard 
for the public release of as much infor-
mation as possible when Americans de-
serve to see it, and they can see it 
when it is consistent with the safety 
and well-being of their households and 
their loved ones. 
I also intend to push the Director of 
National Intelligence to fix a broken 
declassification system. For years, a

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S70 
January 20, 2021 
flood of new, digitally classified infor-
mation has overwhelmed the obsolete, 
paper-based 
declassification 
system. 
This system is so out of whack that in 
order to get a document declassified, 
government officials actually have to 
walk the document around Washington 
from agency to agency. I actually said 
at our open hearing that I wonder if it 
is getting to the point that to get a 
document declassified, someone who 
works for the government has to pack 
a lunch, put the document in a big 
black briefcase, and then make their 
way all over the Nation’s Capital. 
So I have introduced with Senator 
MORAN
bipartisan legislation to au-
thorize the Director of National Intel-
ligence to fix the problem. Ms. Haines 
has acknowledged the seriousness of 
the problem and the DNI’s role in fix-
ing it. It is my intent to make sure 
that this also is not allowed to just 
continue as business as usual. 
Some of the starkest differences be-
tween the actions of the outgoing ad-
ministration and the positions taken 
by Ms. Haines here a couple days ago 
relate to the crucial area of whistle-
blowers. 
The outgoing administration broke 
the law when it withheld from Con-
gress the complaint of the Ukraine 
whistleblower, the whistleblower who 
identified abuses that resulted in the 
first impeachment of Donald Trump. 
This lawlessness undermined both the 
whistleblower system and the inde-
pendence of the Intelligence Commu-
nity Inspector General, who had deter-
mined that the complaint ought to be 
submitted to Congress. Ms. Haines has 
been clear—the law requires that when 
the inspector general determines that a 
whistleblower complaint is urgent, the 
Director of National Intelligence can-
not keep it from the Congress. 
She made other commitments to 
whistleblowers. 
There 
are 
whistle-
blower 
protection 
laws—including 
some that have been approved by the 
Senate Intelligence Committee—that 
need to be enacted. There are proce-
dures already required by law that the 
outgoing administration just didn’t 
issue. They just stonewalled. 
After all the damage done by the 
Trump administration with respect to 
trampling on the public’s right to 
know and transparency where the in-
formation can be made public to the 
American 
people 
without 
compro-
mising sources and methods, I will 
state that the Biden administration 
has a lot of work to do to repair and 
improve 
whistleblower 
protections. 
They are going to have a lot on their 
plate. The country has massive cyber 
vulnerabilities that we saw just a cou-
ple of weeks ago. There is more to do in 
terms of preventing foreign inter-
ference in our elections. We have to en-
sure that other surveillance programs 
provide security without sacrificing 
our constitutional rights. 
I am going to close by way of saying 
I don’t assume that I will always agree 
with 
the 
incoming 
administration. 
That has been true for me with Demo-
crats and Republicans on these issues. 
When we disagree, we will have a vig-
orous debate—as vigorous as when I 
disagreed with the Trump administra-
tion. 
Ms. Haines as DNI and Ambassador 
Burns as CIA Director are beginning to 
shape up as a team that will be more 
open with the public, respect the law, 
and work with the Congress to repair 
the vast damage of the outgoing ad-
ministration and respect what Ben 
Franklin talked about so many years 
ago. Liberty and security are not mu-
tually exclusive. Smart policies get 
you both. Not-so-smart policies get you 
less of both. And that is our challenge. 
So tonight, because of her answers to 
me at the open Intelligence hearing a 
couple of days ago, I want to say I am 
going to be supporting Ms. Haines’ 
nomination to be Director of National 
Intelligence. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia.

EXECUTIVE SESSION 
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to executive session and the 
Intelligence Committee be discharged 
from further consideration of PN 78–10, 
the nomination of Avril Haines to be 
Director of National Intelligence; that 
the Senate proceed to its consider-
ation; that there be 10 minutes of de-
bate on the nomination equally divided 
in the usual form; that upon the use or 
yielding back of time, the Senate vote 
without intervening action or debate; 
and that, if confirmed, the motion to 
reconsider be considered made and laid 
upon the table and the President be im-
mediately notified of the Senate’s ac-
tion. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The clerk will read the nomination. 
The legislative clerk read the nomi-
nation of Avril Danica Haines, of New 
York, to be Director of National Intel-
ligence. 
There being no objection, the com-
mittee was discharged and the Senate 
proceeded to consider the nomination. 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I 
rise to support the nomination of Avril 
Haines to be the Director of National 
Intelligence. Ms. Haines is a historic 
nominee and would be the first woman 
to lead our intelligence community in 
this critical role. With a background at 
the Central Intelligence Agency and 
National Security Council, she under-
stands the work of our intelligence pro-
fessionals and the need to ensure a 
frank and nonpartisan process to de-
liver the information that underpins 
national security and foreign policy de-
cisions. 
Ms. Haines has applied her keen in-
tellect to a number of pursuits, even 
including running a bookstore in Balti-
more and serving as a senior fellow at 
the Johns Hopkins University Applied 
Physics Laboratory. She has a firm 
commitment to her country and to en-
couraging others to serve, including as 
a member of the National Commission 
on Military, National, and Public Serv-
ice. 
After a tumultuous 4 years and a 
President who routinely scorned the 
work of our intelligence community, it 
is critical to restore professional lead-
ership who will work with the adminis-
tration and Congress, deliver honest 
assessments, and speak truth to power. 
Ms. Haines is the right woman for the 
job. 
Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise 
in strong support of the nomination of 
Avril Haines to be Director of National 
Intelligence. 
Let me speak for a few moments, but 
I want to first of all thank members of 
particularly 
the 
Intelligence 
Com-
mittee on both sides of the aisle. My 
good friend, the Senator from Oregon, 
the Finance Committee chair, is some-
one who has deep and passionate con-
cerns about the civil libertarian issues 
in our country. He is part of the yin; 
there is some yang on that committee. 
He raised I think important questions 
with the nominee, and I appreciate his 
courtesy in allowing this to move for-
ward. 
But I also want to thank, at least 
until tomorrow, the chairman of the 
committee, Senator RUBIO, and my Re-
publican colleagues as well. When we 
discussed moving on this nomination 
in a very timely manner, the good 
Chairman RUBIO
and Senator BURR 
worked with all the members of the 
committee. I thank my friend, the Sen-
ator from Idaho, for his courtesy as 
well. 
I am very proud of the fact that the 
first nomination to be considered under 
the Biden administration is going to be 
Ms. Haines. I think that reflects the 
approach of the Intelligence Com-
mittee, and again, I see the chair of the 
committee on the floor now, and I want 
to 
thank 
him 
personally—Senator 
RUBIO—while he is on the floor for that 
courtesy. 
I think part of the reason we were 
able to move so quickly is because this 
position is of such critical importance 
to the country that it is only appro-
priate that it be the first nomination 
to be confirmed by the Senate. 
Avril is extraordinarily qualified for 
the role, having worked in national se-
curity for most of the last two decades. 
After working for several years at the 
State Department, Ms. Haines came 
here to the Senate, where she worked 
on the Foreign Relations Committee as 
a deputy chief counsel. Following an-
other stint at State, Ms. Haines moved 
to the White House, where she served 3 
years as a Deputy Assistant to the 
President and Deputy Counsel for Na-
tional Security. 
In June of 2013, President Obama 
chose Ms. Haines to serve as the Dep-
uty Director of the CIA, making her

January 20, 2021 
the first woman to hold that office. Ms. 
Haines served with the Agency until 
2015, at which point she moved to aca-
demia and the private sector. She was 
a senior researcher at Columbia Uni-
versity, a senior fellow at Johns Hop-
kins Applied Physics Lab, and a mem-
ber of the National Commission on 
Military, National, and Public Service. 
Avril Haines has all the qualifica-
tions we would want for a DNI. But 
more than that, I believe she is firmly 
committed to rebuilding the office of 
the Director of National Intelligence 
and reestablishing the role of that of-
fice as not only the coordinator of our 
Nation’s intelligence community but 
as an adviser to the President and Con-
gress that will not shy away from tell-
ing the hard truths. 
Since Ms. Haines was nominated for 
this role by President Biden, I spent a 
fair amount of time talking to her 
about her future as the Director of Na-
tional Intelligence and the enormous 
job that she will be taking on. 
In our conversations and in her con-
firmation hearings, Ms. Haines was 
strong and thoughtful about the future 
challenges our country will face. My 
first question to her was about China. 
Her answer was equally clear-eyed, 
pointing out the many ways in which 
China is an adversary to our Nation by 
stealing IP or hacking our systems and 
undermining our security, while also 
pointing out that there are many 
places where we will have to engage 
with China as a partner, like on tack-
ling climate change. 
She had equally focused answers 
about the role of Iran as a state spon-
sor of terror and the need to prevent 
Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. 
For every question she was asked by 
my colleagues on the committee, she 
demonstrated that she understood not 
only the challenges of the coming fu-
ture but the IC’s role in understanding 
those issues and meeting them head on. 
I have also been impressed from the 
beginning—and continue to be im-
pressed—by her understanding of the 
important role of the DNI and the IC 
and her commitment to making sure 
that the IC tells policymakers what 
they need to hear, not only what they 
want to hear. 
The last 4 years have been hard on 
the intelligence community. You only 
have to read a newspaper or turn on a 
TV at some point to know that. Since 
the 2016 election, the IC has faced false 
accusations of trying to undermine the 
then-President and seen many of their 
leaders fired for simply doing the right 
thing, speaking truth to power. It 
should surprise no one that all of this 
has led to some damage within the IC, 
particularly to morale. 
I believe that Avril Haines is the 
right nominee to repair this damage. 
She will support the men and women of 
the IC and protect them from political 
pressure. She will insist that they tell 
us their best analysis and not shy away 
from telling decision makers that their 
cherished beliefs are wrong. She will 
insist on telling truth to power. 
Ultimately, this is why I urge my 
colleagues to send a strong message of 
support for the men and women of the 
IC and to support Avril Haines for DNI. 
She is capable, qualified, and will un-
dertake the serious responsibilities 
with a clear-eyed sense of promise. 
I yield the floor.

unanimous consent to yield back all

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on 
January 11, I had the honor of admin-
istering the oath of office to Iowa’s 
speaker of the house, Patrick Grassley, 
who also happens to be my grandson. It 
was a privilege for me and my family 
to participate in the opening day of the 
Iowa Legislature’s 89th General Assem-
bly. Pat has represented the people of 
house district 50 since 2007. He is in his 
second year serving his caucus as 
speaker. 
In addition to celebrating Pat’s pro-
fessional accomplishments, we were 
also moved by the prayer that was 
written and shared by our great grand-
daughter Reagan, alongside her sib-
lings Indee and Chance, as the legisla-
ture convened. 
I ask unanimous consent that a copy 
of Reagan’s prayer be printed in the

She is 11 years old. Barbara and I are 
truly blessed to spend memorable days 
like this one together as a family.
