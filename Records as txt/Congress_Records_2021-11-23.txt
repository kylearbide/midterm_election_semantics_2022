From the beginning, O God, in Your 
divine grace, You have bestowed on us 
the rewards of Your marvelous cre-

Your awe-inspiring handiwork that 
You have shared with us for our enjoy-
ment: the constellations of the stars, 
the majesty of the mountains, the 
peace of a river, the abundant harvest 
of the land. 
The Earth is Yours, O Lord, and the 
fullness thereof, and on this Thanks-
giving week, we take time to give 
honor to You for the incredible privi-
lege we have together to tend this vast 
garden. May we reflect with gratitude 
on the tasks You have entrusted us: to 
sow and to harvest the bounty of the 
Earth, to tend to the health of all that 
lives in this world, to plant and to 
yield goodwill among those who labor 
alongside us. 
We give thanks to You for all these 
blessings as we gather around tables 
this week. Be among us that we may 
experience the generosity of Your abid-
ing presence. Shed Your grace on the 
fruit of fellowship wherever it is found. 
Nourish our souls with mutual respect 
and equip us to carry out the respon-
sibilities You have bestowed on us. 
In all the gifts for which we give 
thanks, may we be ever mindful of the 
gifts of Your love and faithfulness. 
In Your generous name we pray. 
Amen.

E1261 
November 23, 2021 
IN HONOR OF RITA SEMEL’S 100TH 
BIRTHDAY 
HON. NANCY PELOSI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 23, 2021 
Ms. PELOSI. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize a visionary and inspiring leader, 
my longtime friend Rita Semel, as she recently 
celebrated her 100th birthday. Beloved in the 
Bay Area and beyond, Rita has torn down bar-
riers to peace and brought communities to-
gether—here at home and around the world. 
Personally, it has been a great privilege to 
have had a front row seat to Rita’s greatness 
for many decades. Deeply committed to her 
faith and driven by her values, every day she 
lives out the spirit of tikkun olam, ‘to heal the 
world’—which she teaches us is not just a 
gentle phrase, but a clarion call to action. 
Born a New Yorker, but forged into a true 
San Franciscan by more than eight decades in 
the Bay Area, Rita has long seen the world 
not as it is but as it could be—and has la-
bored tirelessly to make real her inspiring vi-
sion. At a time when few women could be 
found in the workplace, she helped break bar-
riers by serving as a reporter at the San Fran-
cisco Chronicle during World War II and free-
lancing for nonprofits as a working mother. 
San Franciscans are especially grateful for 
her decades of leadership of the San Fran-
cisco Interfaith Council, which she helped es-
tablish in the wake of the devastating Loma 
Prieta earthquake to bring our community to-
gether. Under her leadership, the Council has 
been a force for justice and opportunity and 
has improved countless lives: from offering 
emergency shelter in the winter for people ex-
periencing homelessness to fostering interreli-
gious understanding to creating a chaplaincy 
program at the Youth Guidance Center, and 
so much more. 
That this revered Bay Area institution, three 
decades later, continues to unite San Francis-
cans across races, religions and economic 
backgrounds is a testament to her unyielding 
belief that we are always more powerful to-
gether than we could ever be alone. 
As she advanced justice at home, Rita has 
also brought boundless energy and a fierce 
spirit to her work building a world without pov-
erty, violence or discrimination. All Americans 
can be proud of her service representing our 
nation to the world as a delegate to two 
United 
Nations 
World 
Conferences 
on 
Women. And as a longtime Jewish activist, 
she was an early and vocal supporter of the 
state in Israel—and has been an essential 
force in advancing a safer, fairer future for 
Jewish people around the world. 
All who have had the high honor of working 
alongside Rita know that she never takes no 
for an answer—and it is best to save time and 
just agree with her right from the start. For her 
relentless work, she has been recognized with 
many accolades, including Woman of the Year 
by the California State Assembly, the San 
Francisco Foundation’s Community Leader-
ship Award and the Rosa Parks Award from 
Women in Community Service. Most impor-
tantly, however, her impact is measured by 
the indelible mark she leaves on the lives of 
her loved ones, her many friends and all fortu-
nate enough to know her. 
On behalf of the United States House of 
Representatives, I extend the warm greetings 
of the Congress to the extraordinary Rita 
Semel as she and her loved ones celebrate 
her century on this earth—and offer best wish-
es for happy and healthy years to come.

IN HONOR OF HEALTHCARE 
WORKERS 
HON. ROBERT B. ADERHOLT 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 23, 2021 
Mr. ADERHOLT. Madam Speaker, I would 
like to offer my sincere gratitude and admira-
tion for the healthcare workers in Alabama’s 
4th Congressional District, Northern Alabama, 
and our entire state. We have all heard stories 
about individuals in the healthcare field who 
have gone beyond the call of duty during the 
Coronavirus pandemic. From all across my 
district, and throughout our state, constituents 
have nominated some amazing medical work-
ers, and it is my privilege to honor three of 
these individuals today. 
Throughout the COVID–19 pandemic, we 
have seen heroic work done to fight the virus 
on the front lines. Doctors, nurses, first re-
sponders, and everyone who has worked tire-
lessly in the medical field during this past year 
deserve all the thanks we can give them. They 
have kept us safe and healthy in a time when 
we needed it most. 
Over the past two years I have visited hos-
pitals, talked with those on the front lines of 
the fight, and visited vaccine clinics. I have 
been overwhelmed by the outstanding work 
being done each and every day. It has been 
a constant battle for these healthcare heroes, 
but they have risen to the task every step of 
the way. I have no doubt in my mind that 
these amazing men and women have made a 
big difference in Alabama’s bout with COVID– 
19. 
It is for those reasons, and so many more, 
that I want to honor the healthcare heroes. 
They deserve nothing less. Thanks to the sub-
missions from my constituents in my district, I 
include in the RECORD the names of three 
healthcare heroes. When history looks upon 
this trying time in our country, they will find the 
names of these Alabamians who courageously 
took on the fight to keep the rest of us safe. 
With my utmost gratitude, may the legacy of 
these three healthcare heroes live on well into 
the future. 
Dr. Heather L. Haley, who for more than 
seventeen years has served the Huntsville 
community by providing a personal touch to 
her patients and never stopped caring for 
them despite the personal risk caused by 
COVID–19. 
Dr. Joe T. Sharp, who for over forty-three 
years has selflessly cared for others and ex-
celled at communicating medical matters to 
each of his patients. 
Dr. Michael Cantrell, an orthopedic surgeon 
in Huntsville who serves both his community 
and his country at the highest levels of med-
ical excellence.

HONORING 
THE 
75TH 
ANNIVER-
SARY OF LE MOYNE COLLEGE 
HON. JOHN KATKO 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 23, 2021 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Le Moyne College in Syracuse, New 
York as the college celebrates its 75th Anni-
versary. Since its founding, Le Moyne College 
has provided students with a renowned Jesuit 
education, preparing thousands of young men 
and women to reach great successes and live 
generously. 
True to the intellectual and religious tradition 
it was founded on, for over seven decades Le 
Moyne has provided its undergraduate stu-
dents and graduate students with a well- 
rounded, liberal arts education. Equipped with 
a Le Moyne education, alumni from the col-
lege have become leaders across a wide 
range of sectors including business, medicine, 
government, and the arts and sciences. 
Today, Le Moyne has grown dramatically. It 
greatly expanded its academic programs and 
has a sprawling campus that boasts five aca-
demic buildings and 15 residential buildings, 
as well as a chapel, library, performing arts 
center, Jesuit residence, plaza and athletic fa-
cilities. 
While the school has remained committed to 
its core values, Le Moyne has always prided 
itself on being a trailblazer for progress. At the 
time of its founding in 1946, Le Moyne was 
the first Jesuit college in the United States to 
open as a coeducational institutional. And in 
2014, Linda LeMura was named the college’s 
14th president, making her the first female 
layperson to lead a Jesuit institution in the 
United States. Under her leadership, President 
LeMura has raised the college’s profile, 
prioritized inclusivity, and worked to foster an 
environment where Le Moyne students and 
faculty can learn and grow. Notably, during the 
pandemic, President LeMura took an unusual 
step to limit the spread of COVID–19 amongst 
the school’s population and highlight the im-
portance of being a thoughtful steward of the 
community by moving into a neighborhood 
popular with students living off-campus. For 
several months, LeMura became a friendly 
face in the neighborhood. She greeted stu-
dents living nearby on her daily walks, helped 
them keep their lawns free of trash and debris, 
and reprimanded those holding gatherings that 
could spread the virus.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks

November 23, 2021 
In 2016, the college adopted the slogan 
‘Greatness Meets Goodness’ to highlight the 
college’s lasting commitment to helping stu-
dents reach heights in their career, while em-
phasizing the importance of integrity and com-
passion for all people. Le Moyne consistently 
encourages students to put Jesuit values in 
action by providing volunteer opportunities 
within Central New York and around the world, 
and harboring extensive networks at local non-
profits, shelters, kitchens, and schools. In 
2020, Le Moyne launched its Erie 21 program, 
which helps veterans, immigrants, refugees, 
the underemployed and unemployed obtain in-
ternships and software development jobs with 
local employers by providing students with 
technical and computer coding skills. The im-
pact Le Moyne students have had in our Cen-
tral New York community and around the 
world is both far-reaching and impactful. It is 
exemplified by alumni like Jeanette Epps, the 
first Black female astronaut to serve as a 
crewmember on the International Space Sta-
tion, who is conducting research that will ben-
efit all of mankind. And Andrew Lunetta, who 
found his passion helping homeless individ-
uals and families in Central New York while at 
Le Moyne, and has since founded Tiny Home 
For Good, a nonprofit that builds safe and af-
fordable housing for those less fortunate. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues 
in the House join me in honoring the 75th An-
niversary of Le Moyne College. Over the past 
75 years, the College has prepared thousands 
of students to become successful leaders in 
their careers and carry themselves with integ-
rity. Le Moyne has been a cherished part of 
our community and I’m excited to see what 
the future holds for the college.

IN RECOGNITION OF UNCLE MIKE’S 
BAKE SHOPPE 20TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. MIKE GALLAGHER 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 23, 2021 
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise to recognize the 20th anniversary of the 
Grand Opening of Uncle Mike’s Bake Shoppe. 
For over 20 years, Mike and Mary Vande 
Walle and the Uncle Mike’s Bake Shoppe 
team have provided exceptional service and 
award-winning 
baked 
goods 
for 
people 
throughout the State of Wisconsin. 
Starting from humble beginnings, Uncle 
Mike’s opened their first store location in the 
City of De Pere on October 5 of 2001 and 
after three years of operation they quickly ran 
out of space. This gave the Vande Walle’s the 
opportunity to open their second location in 
the Village of Suamico in 2004. As business 
continued to boom, Uncle Mike’s opened a 
third location in the City of Green Bay in 2018 
and purchased a production facility in North-
east Wisconsin that produces baked goods for 
each of their locations. Given the Uncle Mike’s 
team’s commitment to providing exceptional 
customer service and the high demand for 
their products, pop-up shops in Appleton and 
Milwaukee were constructed for customers to 
purchase some of the most popular items on 
the menu. I commend the dedication and hard 
work that has resulted in Uncle Mike’s contin-
ued growth and success for over 20 years. 
Uncle Mike’s Bake Shoppe has been the re-
cipient of over 100 awards in the baking in-
dustry for its excellence in baking and cake 
decorating. Most notability in 2014, Uncle 
Mike’s won Best Kringle in North America for 
their world-famous sea salt caramel pecan 
kringle. Uncle Mike’s Bake Shoppe has grown 
to be one of the most popular and recogniz-
able bakeries in Wisconsin due to its excep-
tional customer service, friendly staff, and 
high-quality products. Uncle Mike’s is also 
known for their unwavering support of the sur-
rounding communities through offering fund-
raisers to local school districts and supplying 
fresh-baked cream puffs for the Denmark FFA 
booth at the Brown County Fair. Since the 
loss of Uncle Mike in 2020, his spirit has con-
tinued to live on through his family where they 
have carried on his love for baking. As third- 
generation bakers, Mike and Mary Vande 
Walle made it their mission to provide quality 
products through old-fashioned baking meth-
ods with high-quality ingredients. Throughout 
the years, Mike and Mary passed down their 
expertise in old-fashioned baking to their chil-
dren, Brittni and Nathan, so that they could 
continue the exceptional baking traditions that 
began in 1974 with Don and Norma Vande 
Walle at Mehlberg’s Bakery in Shawano. 
I Invite all members of this body to join me 
in celebrating the 20th Anniversary of Uncle 
Mike’s Bake Shoppe. I extend my sincerest 
congratulations to the Uncle Mike’s team on 
this remarkable milestone and wish them suc-
cess for many more years to follow. Uncle 
Mike’s Bake Shoppe is a wonderful business 
in Northeast Wisconsin and is deserving of the 
highest degree of recognition.

CONGRATULATING MIKE HOFFMAN 
ON HIS RETIREMENT AFTER 27 
YEARS AT WNDU 
HON. JACKIE WALORSKI 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 23, 2021 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Mike Hoffman and con-
gratulate him on a remarkable 27-year career 
at WNDU and 40 years in the meteorology 
field. As he prepares to retire, it is my privilege 
to honor Mike’s steadfast dedication to his 
work and thank him for his decades of service 
to Michiana communities. 
A lifelong Hoosier, Mike has been a con-
stant and trusted presence as the WNDU me-
teorologist. Every day, Indiana families tune in 
for Mike’s thoughtful analysis and reporting on 
our region’s constantly evolving weather. For 
more than 20 years in our truly four-season 
climate, our community has trusted Mike to 
shoot straight and let us know what to expect 
from snow to rain to ice and extreme tempera-
tures. 
Generations of WNDU viewers have gotten 
to know Mike as he delivers the local weather 
report each night, as well as the AgDay and 
US Farm Report weather segments that are 
crucial for our hardworking Hoosier farmers. 
Local families count on Mike to keep them up-
dated on dangerous storms, and Hoosier kids 
always tune into Mike’s reports as they ea-
gerly anticipate snow days. 
For those who know Mike, it is obvious that 
both his Indiana roots and his commitment to 
our community run deep. Mike’s journalism ca-
reer commenced in his hometown of Delphi, 
and although he will soon give his final WNDU 
weather report, his retirement is far from the 
end of this story. 
On and off the air, Mike has made northern 
Indiana safer, better informed, and more resil-
ient. As an active community member, he al-
ways finds ways to serve his neighbors and 
give back to the region he proudly calls home. 
As Mike prepares to sign off and begin a 
new chapter, I am grateful to this outstanding 
Hoosier for his work as a meteorologist, as 
well as for the example he has modeled for 
aspiring journalists and every young Hoosier 
learning to give back and build a brighter fu-
ture. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring WNDU’s Mike Hoffman for his 
exceptional character, guidance, and kindness 
that has made an indelible legacy in our com-
munity and beyond.

CONGRATULATING THE ZUNI 
CROSS COUNTRY GIRLS TEAM 
HON. TERESA LEGER FERNANDEZ 
OF NEW MEXICO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 23, 2021 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam Speak-
er, I am pleased to congratulate the Zuni 
Cross-Country Girls Team for winning the Dis-
trict Championships in 2021. Looking through 
all of the school’s running records, it’s clearly 
an amazing community. These runners con-
tinue to be a shining example of what we 
women are capable of. 
It is even more remarkable that their suc-
cess happened during a pandemic that has 
devastated our indigenous communities. They 
still delivered and lived up to expectations 
making their village proud. The team is a gift 
to the community. 
I extend my warmest wishes for the future 
of the village. If it’s in this team’s hands, I’m 
sure Zuni will continue to thrive.

HONORING THE CAREER OF MS. 
BETH SHERMAN 
HON. JIM BANKS 
OF INDIANA– 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 23, 2021 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Ms. Beth Sherman for her dedicated 
service to LaGrange County, Indiana. Resi-
dents of LaGrange County owe a debt grati-
tude to Beth for her leadership at the La-
Grange County Chamber of Commerce. 
Beth joined the chamber in 2006, and soon 
after became its executive director, a position 
in which she served for 12 years. Under her 
leadership, the chamber’s membership dou-
bled, and business in the county blossomed. 
The chamber’s membership stands at more 
than 400 businesses today, up from the 146 
members in 2006 when Beth started. The 
county’s unemployment rate is roughly half 
that of the national average, and future job 
growth over the next ten years is predicted to 
be 47.4 percent, considerably higher than the 
US average of 33.5 percent. These bench-
marks, and others, can be attributed in large 
measure to Beth.

Her commitment to helping local businesses 
grow was palpable, as she advocated tire-
lessly for its members, brought members of 
the Chamber together through events, helped 
to transform the Chamber’s marketing and 
outreach efforts, and more. Aside from her 
work in the chamber, Beth is a beloved mem-
ber of the LaGrange County community and 
intends to remain active in retirement. 
I am proud to include in the RECORD this 
document as a testament to Beth’s work and 
legacy. Because of her, more Hoosiers in La-
Grange County have good jobs, can support 
their families, and enjoy a higher quality of life. 
Although she will no longer lead Chamber, her 
legacy will endure, and her commitment to the 
community and state will serve as a proud ex-
ample for others in the years to come.

RECOGNIZING RICHARD WILSON’S 
SERVICE 
AS 
A 
FEDERAL 
EM-
PLOYEE 
HON. ADAM SMITH 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 23, 2021 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, 
I rise to recognize Richard Wilson on his many 
years of service in the Federal Government 
and then as a board member for the National 
Active and Retired Federal Employees Asso-
ciation (NARFE). 
Richard was an experienced and accom-
plished public servant. With 38 years at the 
U.S. Postal Service and 26 years of service 
with the Naval Reserve, he exemplified his 
dedication to serving his community and his 
country. 
Richard Wilson was dedicated to his work 
with NARFE. After spending time representing 
his State as president of the Washington Fed-
eration, he became a member of the associa-
tion’s National Executive Board. 
My office and I were pleased to have 
worked with Richard in his capacity at NARFE 
and are saddened to hear of his passing. He 
and his contributions to our community will be 
sorely missed. 
Madam Speaker, it is my privilege and 
honor to remember Richard Wilson for the 
achievements he made during his lifetime.

RECOGNIZING MR. KEVIN BELL ON 
HIS RETIREMENT 
HON. MIKE QUIGLEY 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 23, 2021 
Mr. QUIGLEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to join the Lincoln Park Zoo colleagues in hon-
oring Mr. Kevin J. Bell. Kevin recently retired 
as the zoo’s President and CEO after 26 
years of dedicated service. Kevin’s retirement 
marks the end of a long career as a leader in 
the wildlife Conservation and Zoo world. Since 
he was a young boy, Kevin growing up on the 
grounds of the Bronx Zoo, where his father 
worked, had a passion for animals. 
Kevin has been with Lincoln Park Zoo for 45 
years, starting as a volunteer at the age of 10, 
he became a part-time animal caretaker at 17, 
and a keeper at 20. After earning his degrees, 
he was hired in 1976 as the curator of birds 
at Lincoln Park Zoo, promoted in 1992 to as-
sistant director, and appointed in 1993 to di-
rector. After the zoo privatized in 1995, Kevin 
was named president and CEO of the Lincoln 
Park Zoological Society, which manages and 
operates Lincoln Park Zoo. 
Kevin joined the American Zoo and Aquar-
ium Association in 1976, and 20 years later 
would become the chair of the Privatization 
Task Force. A well-respected expert, he has 
published numerous articles in zoo-related 
publications. In 2011, he was selected as one 
of the three U.S. delegates to serve on the 
board of the World Association of Zoos and 
Aquariums (WAZA). Madam Speaker, please 
join me and all our colleagues in the House of 
Representatives in recognizing Mr. Bell’s 
years of service and congratulating him on his 
retirement.

IN HONOR OF HEALTHCARE 
WORKERS 
HON. ROBERT B. ADERHOLT 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 23, 2021 
Mr. ADERHOLT. Madam Speaker, I would 
like to offer my sincere gratitude and admira-
tion for the healthcare workers in Alabama’s 
4th Congressional District, Northern Alabama, 
and our entire state. We have all heard stories 
about individuals in the healthcare field who 
have gone beyond the call of duty during the 
Coronavirus pandemic. From all across my 
district, and throughout our state, constituents 
have nominated some amazing medical work-
ers, and it is my privilege to honor 519 of 
these individuals today in the CONGRESSIONAL 
RECORD. 
Throughout the COVID–19 pandemic, we 
have seen heroic work done to fight the virus 
on the front lines. Doctors, nurses, first re-
sponders, and everyone who has worked tire-
lessly in the medical field during this past year 
deserve all the thanks we can give them. They 
have kept us safe and healthy in a time when 
we needed it most. 
Over the past 15 months I have visited hos-
pitals, talked with those on the front lines of 
the fight, and visited vaccine clinics throughout 
my district. I have been overwhelmed by the 
outstanding work being done each and every 
day. It has been a constant battle for these 
healthcare heroes, but they have risen to the 
task every step of the way. I have no doubt in 
my mind that these amazing men and women 
have made a big difference in Alabama’s bout 
with COVID–19. 
It is for those reasons, and so many more, 
that I want to honor the healthcare heroes of 
Northern Alabama. They deserve nothing less. 
Thanks to the submissions from my constitu-
ents in Alabama’s 4th Congressional District, I 
include in the RECORD 519 healthcare heroes 
from Dekalb Regional Medical Center. When 
history looks upon this trying time in our coun-
try, they will find the names of the men and 
women of Alabama who courageously took on 
the fight to keep the rest of us safe. 
With my utmost gratitude, may the legacy of 
these 519 healthcare heroes live on well into 
the future.

HONORING 
THE 
100TH 
ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE VILLAGE OF OR-
CHARD PARK, NEW YORK 
HON. CHRIS JACOBS 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 23, 2021 
Mr. JACOBS of New York. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize the Village of Orchard 
Park, New York, on its centennial anniversary. 
The Village of Orchard Park is a beautiful, 
tranquil village that lies in western New York, 
and I am honored to call it my home. The Vil-
lage of Orchard Park was founded in 1921. 
The area of present-day Orchard Park was 
historically referred to as an ‘‘uncultivated part 
of nature’s garden’’ and was said to resemble 
a ‘‘park of orchards.’’ The early pioneers of 
Orchard Park worked to transform a forest into 
the beautiful community it is today. They built 
residences, churches, and public places which 
remain important parts of the culture and val-
ues of today’s Orchard Park. 
Many great businesses and businesspeople 
have hailed from the Village of Orchard Park, 
including Harry Yates. Mr. Yates moved from 
Buffalo to Orchard Park and purchased mul-
tiple farms, including roughly 3,500 acres of 
land. Mr. Yates created and donated Green 
Lake to the Orchard Park community, which is 
still enjoyed today by residents and visitors. 
Mr. Yates also donated the land for the con-
struction of two churches, Nativity of Our Lord

CELEBRATING 
100 
YEARS 
OF 
FRIENDLY HOUSE AND 85 YEARS 
OF TAMALE DINNERS 
HON. RUBEN GALLEGO 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 23, 2021 
Mr. GALLEGO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in celebration of Friendly House, which 
turned 100 years old in 2020. 
Friendly House first started in 1920 as part 
of a local initiative to help immigrants in Ari-
zona obtain citizenship and adjust to the 
United States. Today, Friendly House’s serv-
ices have expanded to include youth and adult 
education, family and emergency services, 
and workforce development, while still main-
taining their original commitment to providing 
immigration and citizenship services. For the 
past 100 years, Friendly House has advanced 
America’s identity as a nation of opportunity 
by helping individuals and families fully partici-
pate in American life. 
After being delayed by a year due to 
COVID–19, Friendly House will celebrate its 
100th anniversary at its 85th signature Tamale 
Dinner on December 3. For many, tamales 
represent coming together with loved ones, 
especially 
around 
the 
holidays. 
Friendly 
House’s annual Tamale Dinner has been 
bringing together the Phoenix community for 
over eight decades, making it the longest 
standing fundraiser in the State. 
I would like to thank Friendly House for 100 
years of service to the Phoenix community 
and wish them the best as they continue to 
grow their impact over the next 100 years.

recognize and celebrate Ms. Riemer as an ex-
ceptional attorney who has provided out-
standing legal support to the benefit of our na-
tion’s armed forces. Ms. Riemer retires as the

port, where she is widely respected for her ac-
curate, strategic, and creative legal advice. 
She is recognized and respected as an expert 
in all areas of federal acquisition, whether it be

logistics contracting. She has demonstrated an 
extraordinary ability to overcome complex 
challenges, including those innumerable legal 
challenges that have arisen because of the 
COVID–19 pandemic. Ms. Riemer’s expert 
guidance and creative leadership have helped 
her clients face challenges and overcome ad-
versity. Her dedicated and diligent work has 
contributed to keeping our fleet mission-ready. 
We are incredibly grateful for the positive 
impact Ms. Riemer has had through her long 
career of public service, and we wish Ms. 
Riemer countless blessings during her retire-
ment.

HONORING THE SEMINOLE TRIBE 
OF FLORIDA FOR NATIONAL NA-
TIVE 
AMERICAN 
HERITAGE 
MONTH 
HON. DARREN SOTO 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 23, 2021 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, Seminoles 
have called Florida home for thousands of 
years. Their ancestors met the Spanish when 
they touched down on Florida’s shores in 
1510 and created a refuge for those who 
sought to escape slavery and oppression. In 
1830, when President Andrew Jackson broke 
the treaties he signed with native peoples and 
ordered those east of the Mississippi River be 
‘‘removed’’ west, the Seminoles resisted and 
fought for their freedom alongside their neigh-
bors. They kept their ways and traditions alive 
in the Everglades of Florida, where they re-
main free and unconquered to this day. 
Facing the threat of the termination of serv-
ices and Federal assistance in the 1950’s the 
Seminole Tribe of Florida organized to de-
velop a constitution, advanced through meet-
ings under the old Council Oak Tree on the 
Hollywood Reservation. Federal recognition in 
1957 reinforced the inherent sovereignty and 
necessitated a new form of self-governance 
for the newly organized Tribe. As more out-
siders came to Florida, the Tribe adapted and 
developed new economic opportunities, includ-
ing tourism enterprises and cattle operations. 
Today, the Tribe counts over 4,000 mem-
bers. They are a sovereign government, with 
their own schools, police, and courts. Mem-
bers continue their traditions of sewing, patch-
work, chickee building, and alligator wrestling 
but the Seminole Tribe also adapted to a 
changing world. Today, they run one of the 
largest cattle operations in the United States 
and own the Hard Rock Hotel & Casinos, an 
international business with locations in 74 
countries. 
The Seminole Tribe also gives back to its 
community and is actively helping to protect 
the Everglades they call home. The Seminole 
Tribe has been actively involved in the Ever-
glades restoration effort since its inception and 
has contributed significant resources to ensure 
that the overall restoration effort is successful, 
while protecting its sovereignty and unique 
way of life. For all this and more, we honor 
The Seminole Tribe of Florida for National Na-
tive American Heritage Month.

HON. MIKE BOST 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 23, 2021 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize Du Quoin High School’s Family Ca-
reer and Community Leaders of America 
(FCCLA) club for their generosity on World 
Kindness Day. After a good fundraising year, 
the students used their leftover club funds to 
purchase gift cards to distribute to community 
members outside their local grocery store. 
This act of kindness helped ensure that sev-
eral local families were able to put food on the 
dinner table that evening. World Kindness Day 
is a wonderful opportunity to take a moment to 
give back to our communities. It serves as a 
reminder that even a gesture as simple as a 
smile or a helping hand can make someone’s 
day. I am proud of each member and leader 
of Du Quoin High School’s Family Career and 
Community Leaders of America club for their 
hard work and generosity during a time when 
many are struggling to make ends meet. On 
behalf of southern Illinois, thank you for giving 
back to our Du Quoin community.

IN MEMORY OF THE HONORABLE 
LARRY HOPKINS 
HON. ANDY BARR 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 23, 2021 
Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of a true American patriot, 
former Congressman Larry Hopkins, who 
served in this body from 1979–1993 and 
passed away on November 15. Throughout 
his extraordinary career in public service, 
Larry served in the Kentucky State legislature 
and for over a decade in Congress in the seat 
I now hold. Larry’s career in public service 
began as a U.S. Marine in 1954. It was that 
love for the military that Larry would bring with 
him to Congress, where he rose to become 
the top Republican on the Armed Services 
Committee. 
Larry’s humor was famous with both his 
constituents and his colleagues—always offer-
ing a disarming joke to lighten the mood or 
evoking a good laugh. Above all, madam 
Speaker, Congressman Hopkins was proud of 
his work across the aisle and the relationships 
he had with all of his colleagues, Republicans 
and Democrats alike. 
In these divided times, let us be inspired by 
the legacy of Congressman Hopkins to come 
together and solve the problems of our day, 
not as Republicans and Democrats, but as 
Americans who all love our country. On behalf 
of a grateful nation, God bless Congressman 
Larry Hopkins. To my colleagues in the 
House, join me in praying for his wife, Caro-
lyn, and three children, Shae, Tara, and Josh.

IN MEMORY OF LEO A. HUPPE 
HON. CHRIS PAPPAS 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 23, 2021 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Leo A. Huppe, a World War II hero 
and active member of the seacoast community 
who passed away in late October at the age 
of 96. Born on February 25, 1925, in Laconia 
and residing in Rochester for more than 75 
years, Leo was a long-time New Hampshire 
resident and an honorable member of our 
community. At the time of his passing, Leo 
was a beloved husband, father, grandfather, 
great-grandfather, and great-great grandfather. 
As a young patriot, Leo went above and be-
yond the call of duty in his service to his coun-
try. Among the many medals, ribbons, and 
badges he received for his heroic actions 
throughout World War II in the Asiatic Pacific, 
Leo was awarded the Silver Star and the 
World War II Victory Medal, as well as the Asi-
atic Pacific Theatre Medal and the Philippine 
Liberation Ribbon. 
After his service, Leo worked diligently as a 
self-employed carpenter before entering a 
well-deserved retirement in 1987 with his wife, 
Evelyn, with whom he shared over 75 anniver-
saries before passing. 
On behalf of my constituents in New Hamp-
shire’s First Congressional District, I share my 
condolences to Leo’s daughter, four grand-
children, eight great-grandchild, and great- 
great grandson. As we recognize Mr. Huppe, 
I ask my colleagues in the House of Rep-
resentatives to join me in honoring his rich life 
and legacy.

IN HONOR OF THE RETIREMENT 
OF FIRE ENGINEER RADOSLAV 
MARINKOVICH 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 23, 2021 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Fire Engineer Radoslav 
Marinkovich of the Dearborn Fire Department. 
His honorable years of service to our commu-
nity is worthy of commendation. 
Fire Engineer Marinkovich retired on No-
vember 23, 2021, after serving over two dec-
ades with the Dearborn Fire Department. He 
has been a trusted member of the department 
since July 1998, when he began his career as 
a Firefighter I. He rose to level of Firefighter 
II in March 2005. Assigned to Fire Station 3 
on Wyoming Avenue, he was promoted to po-
sition of Fire Engineer in December 2007. 
The recipient of numerous awards, Fire En-
gineer Marinkovich is an example to his peers. 
He is a three-time recipient of the Meritorious 
Company Commendation and a nine-time win-
ner of the Safe Driving Award. He earned the 
Unit Commendation Award For June 25, 2021, 
Catastrophic Flooding, and was a part of the

invaluable team that assisted the citizens of 
Dearborn in a time of crisis and need. To top 
off an award-winning career, he was given the 
2021 Meritorious Service Award For Over 20 
Years of Exceptional Service. When faced 
with a challenge, he does not faulter. Fire En-
gineer Marinkovich has been a stellar member 
of the department for the past twenty-three 
years and his lasting commitment to serving 
others has made him stand out among his fel-
low firefighters. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Fire Engineer Radoslav 
Marinkovich for a career of exemplary service 
to the Dearborn Fire Department. I join with 
Fire Engineer Marinkovich’s family, friends, 
and colleagues in extending my gratitude to 
him for his honorable service in protecting our 
community and thank him for his role in serv-
ing the people of the City of Dearborn for the 
past two decades.

IN HONOR OF HEALTHCARE 
WORKERS 
HON. ROBERT B. ADERHOLT 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 23, 2021 
Mr. ADERHOLT. Madam Speaker, I would 
like to offer my sincere gratitude and admira-
tion for the healthcare workers in Alabama’s 
4th Congressional District, Northern Alabama, 
and our entire state. We have all heard stories 
about individuals in the healthcare field who 
have gone beyond the call of duty during the 
Coronavirus pandemic. From all across my 
district, and throughout our state, constituents 
have nominated some amazing medical work-
ers, and it is my privilege to honor 307 of 
these individuals today. 
Throughout the COVID–19 pandemic, we 
have seen heroic work done to fight the virus 
on the front lines. Doctors, nurses, first re-
sponders, and everyone who has worked tire-
lessly in the medical field during this past year 
deserve all the thanks we can give them. They 
have kept us safe and healthy in a time when 
we needed it most. 
Over the past two years I have visited hos-
pitals, talked with those on the front lines of 
the fight, and visited vaccine clinics throughout 
my district. I have been overwhelmed by the 
outstanding work being done each and every 
day. It has been a constant battle for these 
healthcare heroes, but they have risen to the 
task every step of the way. I have no doubt in 
my mind that these amazing men and women 
have made a big difference in Alabama’s bout 
with COVID–19. 
It is for those reasons, and so many more, 
that I want to honor the healthcare heroes of 
Northern Alabama. They deserve nothing less. 
Thanks to the submissions from my constitu-
ents in Alabama’s 4th Congressional District, I 
include in the RECORD the names of 307 
healthcare heroes. When history looks upon 
this trying time in our country, they will find the 
names of the men and women of Alabama 
who courageously took on the fight to keep 
the rest of us safe. 
With my utmost gratitude, may the legacy of 
these 307 healthcare heroes live on well into 
the future.

named the County an ‘‘Employer of Choice.’’ 
In 2019, he was the first county manager to 
receive the ‘‘County Manager of the Year’’ 
award from the Colorado City and County 
Management Association. 
Mr. Gonzales has dutifully implemented the 
policies and priorities of the Board of County 
Commissioners and expertly overseen the

his tenure. Mr. Gonzalez managed many ini-
tiatives that positively impacted the residents

tablishment of a new animal shelter, the com-
pletion of the state-of-the-art human services 
building, and a new Veterans memorial dedi-
cated to Adams County Veterans who served 
and sacrificed for their country. 
We thank Mr. Gonzales for his years of 
service to Adams County, and we are pleased 
he will be taking the next step in his career as 
the President of the Metro Denver Economic 
Development Corporation (MDEDC) and Exec-
utive Vice President of the Denver Metro 
Chamber of Commerce. We look forward to 
the incredible things he will do for the State of 
Colorado.

IN RECOGNITION OF WORLD DAY 
OF 
REMEMBRANCE 
FOR 
ROAD 
TRAFFIC VICTIMS 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 23, 2021 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise, along 
with 
my 
colleague, 
Congressman 
STEVE 
COHEN, fellow co-chair of the Congressional 
Caucus on Global Road Safety, to mark the 
26th World Day of Remembrance for Road 
Traffic Victims (World Day) on Sunday, No-
vember 21, 2021. 
On this solemn event, families, advocates, 
and leaders around the world gather to re-
member the tens of millions of lives impacted 
by road crashes and the bravery of the first re-
sponders and health care workers who work 
valiantly to save as many lives as possible. 
World Day of Remembrance was initiated in 
1995 as the European Day of Remembrance 
and quickly spread around the globe. In 2005 
the United Nations General Assembly adopted 
Resolution 60/2, recognizing the third Sunday 
in November as the World Day of Remem-
brance for Road Traffic Victims. 
Every year, the goals of the World Day of 
Remembrance are to remember all people 
killed and seriously injured on the roads; ac-
knowledge the crucial work of the emergency 
services; advocate for better support to road 
traffic victims and their families; and promote 
evidence-based actions to prevent and even-
tually stop further road traffic deaths and inju-
ries. 
More than one mill ion people die from road 
crashes every year, and tens of millions are 
seriously injured. Road traffic crashes are the 
number one killer of young people aged 15– 
29, the third leading killer of Americans 
abroad, and the eighth leading cause of death 
among all people worldwide. Despite these fig-
ures, our understanding of the full scope of 
the problem is still lacking, and additional data 
collection is imperative. 
World Day of Remembrance 2021 also fo-
cuses on reduction of traffic speeds. Studies 
have 
shown 
unequivocally 
that 
lowering 
speeds has the potential to prevent many 
deaths and serious injuries, in particular those 
of pedestrians and all other vulnerable road 
users like children, people with disabilities, 
and the elderly. 
This year also marks the beginning of the 
second global Decade of Action for Road 
Safety 2021–2030, which has a primary goal 
of reducing the number of deaths and serious 
injuries caused by road traffic accidents by at 
least 50 percent by 2030. Additionally, in Oc-
tober 2021, Congressman COHEN and I offi-
cially relaunched the Congressional Caucus 
on Global Road Safety, working closely with 
the Association for Safe International Road 
Travel (ASIRT), the leading U.S. nonprofit ad-
vocating for safe travel on the world’s roads. 
Rochelle Sobel founded ASIRT in response 
to the death of her son Aron, a 22-year-old 
medical student who was killed in a bus crash 
in Turkey along with 23 other passengers. 
ASIRT works to improve the safety of travelers 
through education and advocacy and was in-
strumental in encouraging the establishment of 
the Caucus in 2004. 
Looking ahead to what we must accomplish 
in this second Decade of Action, it is crucial 
that we collaborate to enact common sense 
solutions to meaningfully reduce the terrible 
toll of road crashes. We know how to save 
lives, now we must muster the will and cour-
age to act with conviction. 
As Co-Chairs of the Congressional Caucus 
on Global Road Safety, we implore our col-
leagues, partners, stakeholders, industry lead-
ers and decision-makers worldwide to heed 
the message of World Day to ‘‘remember, 
support, and act’’ to improve road safety and 
prevent avoidable tragedies. We look forward 
to welcoming more of our colleagues to the 
Caucus and working in earnest to provide 
leadership and make tangible advances to re-
duce road deaths.

HONORING THE LIFE OF GORDON 
‘‘MACK’’ MCKINLEY, JR. 
HON. BRIAN BABIN 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 23, 2021 
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of my friend, Gordon ‘‘Mack’’ 
McKinley, Jr., who passed away on Wednes-
day, November 10, 2021, at the age of 72. 
Mack and I grew up together in Beaumont, 
Texas, survived high school together and were 
roommates and fraternity brothers during col-
lege at the University of Texas. 
Mack was a guy you could count on in good 
times and bad times to always have a positive 
outlook. He learned it through an adversity 
that terrified the mothers of our generation and 
left its mark on those who survived it. But 
Mack was strong and resilient, and he never 
let polio define him. 
He was born on November 14, 1948, in Gal-
veston, Texas, and named after his dad, Gor-
don McKinley, Sr. He was an only child, but a 
friend to many. 
Like many students at the University of 
Texas in Austin, Mack fell in love with the city 
and stayed on after graduation. In 1974, he 
opened a club called The Common Interest 
which quickly became a popular hangout and 
has been an Austin institution for the last 47 
years. The Common Interest provided a great 
gathering place where sports games could be 
enjoyed with friends, songs could be sung and 
fun could be had by all, especially Mack, a 
huge 
fan 
of 
the 
University 
of 
Texas 
Longhorns. 
Mack also fell in love with a girl he met in 
the Common Interest, named Shannon Wil-
son, with whom he shared a happy married 
life for 45 years. Mack and Shannon began 
their lives together in Austin, Texas in 1976 
and were blessed with three sons Michael, 
Kevin and Brandon. Shannon was the love of 
his life. He considered her and their family his 
greatest blessing and his greatest accomplish-
ment throughout his life being a father. He 
was an enthusiastic fan and supporter of his 
three boys in the various sports they played. 
To this day, his son’s jerseys still hang with 
pride on the walls of The Common Interest. 
Mack was an avid golfer all his life. A spe-
cial gift from his sons a few years ago was a 
trip to the Master’s Tournament in Augusta, 
Georgia. 
Mack never quit doing things on his own 
terms, overcoming physical limitations that 
may have caused others to give up. He ac-
cepted life’s challenges, he worked hard, he 
was a loving son, husband, father and grand-
father or ‘‘Pops’’ as he was known, and he 
was my lifelong friend and inspiration. 
I will miss him. 
Mack is survived by his wife, Shannon 
McKinley, his son Michael McKinley, wife Brie, 
kids Bodie and Kai, his son Kevin McKinley, 
wife Candace, kids Kaylee, Kenna, Kensi and 
Kason, and son Brandon McKinley, wife 
Amber, kids Dakota and Merritt. Mack is also 
survived by numerous cousins close to Dallas, 
Chicago and Nashville. 
Madam Speaker, today I honor my close 
friend and college roommate Mack McKinley. 
His example of fortitude and strength to over-
come obstacles will not be forgotten, and my 
heartfelt prayers remain with his family and 
friends during this difficult time.

served communities and voting accessibility as

CELEBRATING 
THE 
100TH 
ANNI-
VERSARY OF AMERICA LODGE 
NO. 77 
HON. JENNIFFER GONZA´LEZ-COLO´ N 
OF PUERTO RICO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 23, 2021 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N. Madam Speaker, 
I rise to recognize the work of the America 
Lodge No. 77 on its centennial celebration. 
The America Lodge No. 77 was founded 
100 years ago and continues to exercise its 
work ascribed to the Great Sovereign Lodge 
of Free and Accepted Freemasons of Puerto 
Rico. On June 19th of 1921, a group of eight 
distinguished masons celebrated a meeting 
presided over by the honorable Pedro Del 
Valle Atiles. In this meeting the new lodge was 
constituted with the name of Americas. 
The Grand Master William E. Lippitt pre-
sided over the ceremony when the Great 
Lodge of Free and Accepted Freemason of 
Puerto Rico granted the Founding Charter to 
the America Lodge. With this the number 77 
was assigned to the America Lodge and the 
new Officialdom was installed. 
It is motive of pride for the America Lodge 
No. 77, the fact that their members are not 
limited to their masonic activities for the ben-
efit of their lodge only. A great number of 
them have rendered valuable services to hu-
manity like educational conferences about the 
Masonic history and providing resources to as-
sist the victims of Hurricane Maria. Addition-
ally, members of the Lodge have held posi-
tions of importance in different industries 
throughout the history of the Lodge having a 
great impact in their communities. 
I’m honored to celebrate the 100th anniver-
sary of the America Lodge No. 77, recognizing 
the uninterrupted work that their members 
continue to perform.

HONORING THE MEMORY OF THE 
HONORABLE 
RICHARD 
ALBERT 
ST. JOHN 
HON. NORMA J. TORRES 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 23, 2021 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor my constituent from 
Pomona, the Honorable Richard Albert St. 
John. It is with more than a heavy heart that 
I share that Richard Albert St. John passed 
away on November 4, 2021. 
From the young age of 16, Richard served 
his country first with the merchant marines on 
the Great Lakes steamers. One year later, 
Richard enlisted into the Army where he 
served as a marine engine mechanic. After 
leaving the Army and working in a car factory, 
Richard re-enlisted and served in the Korean 
War. He was seriously wounded during the 
war, and was awarded the Purple Heart. 
After being discharged as a Sergeant First 
Class, Richard relocated to Los Angeles in 
1953 and entered public service with the Sher-
iffs Department and then as an investigator 
with the District Attorney’s office. He attended 
law school at night at Pacific Coast University 
while working in law enforcement during the 
day. Upon passing the bar, he worked as the 
Assistant County Counsel for Butte County. 
He later returned to Los Angeles where he 
met Judith Wallingford and married her in 
1970. 
Richard’s experience and success as a trial 
lawyer led him to be recruited to the District 
Attorney’s office. From 1975 to 1998, Richard 
served as a Juvenile Court Referee and then 
as a Superior Court Judge on the Santa Bar-
bara County Superior Court. 
In retirement, Richard dedicated his time to 
his art, family, and traveling with his beloved 
wife. Richard was a dedicated husband, loyal 
friend, and selfless public servant. He will be 
fondly remembered by his loved ones, friends, 
colleagues, and community. 
Today, Madam Speaker, it is my honor to 
recognize the Honorable Richard Albert St. 
John on the House floor to the State of Cali-
fornia. May he rest in peace.

158TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 
GETTYSBURG ADDRESS 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 23, 2021 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, in recognition of the 158th anniver-
sary of President Lincoln’s famous Civil War 
speech in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. I believe 
it is appropriate that we take the time to re-
member these meaningful words. 
GETTYSBURG ADDRESS 
PRESIDENT ABRAHAM LINCOLN—NOVEMBER 19, 
1863 
‘‘Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers 
brought forth, on this continent, a new na-
tion, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to 
the proposition that all men are created 
equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil 
war, testing whether that nation, or any na-
tion so conceived, and so dedicated, can long 
endure. We are met on a great battlefield of 
that war. We have come to dedicate a por-
tion of that field, as a final resting place for 
those who here gave their lives, that that na-
tion might live. It is altogether fitting and 
proper that we should do this. But, in a larg-
er sense, we cannot dedicate, we cannot con-
secrate—we cannot hallow—this ground. The 
brave men, living and dead, who struggled 
here, have consecrated it far above our poor 
power to add or detract. The world will little 
note, nor long remember what we say here, 
but it can never forget what they did here. It 
is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated 
here to the unfinished work which they who 
fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. 
It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the 
great task remaining before us—that from 
these honored dead we take increased devo-
tion to that cause for which they here gave 
the last full measure of devotion—that we 
here highly resolve that these dead shall not 
have died in vain—that this nation, under 
God, shall have a new birth of freedom, and 
that government of the people, by the peo-
ple, for the people, shall not perish from the 
earth.’’

IN HONOR OF HEALTHCARE 
WORKERS 
HON. ROBERT B. ADERHOLT 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 23, 2021 
Mr. ADERHOLT. Madam Speaker, I would 
like to offer my sincere gratitude and admira-
tion for the healthcare workers in Alabama’s 
4th Congressional District, Northern Alabama, 
and our entire state: We have all heard stories 
about individuals in the healthcare field who 
have gone beyond the call of duty during the 
Coronavirus pandemic. From all across my 
district, and throughout our state, constituents 
have nominated some amazing medical work-
ers, and it is my privilege to honor 63 of these 
individuals today. 
Throughout the COVID–19 pandemic, we 
have seen heroic work done to fight the virus 
on the front lines. Doctors, nurses, first re-
sponders, and everyone who has worked tire-
lessly in the medical field during this past year 
deserve all the thanks we can give them. They 
have kept us safe and healthy in a time when 
we needed it most. 
Over the past two years I have visited hos-
pitals, talked with those on the front lines of 
the fight, and visited vaccine clinics throughout 
my district. I have been overwhelmed by the 
outstanding work being done each and every 
day. It has been a constant battle for these 
healthcare heroes, but they have risen to the 
task every step of the way. I have no doubt in 
my mind that these amazing men and women 
have made a big difference in Alabama’s bout 
with COVID–19. 
It is for those reasons, and so many more, 
that I want to honor the healthcare heroes of 
Northern Alabama. They deserve nothing less. 
Thanks to the submissions from my constitu-
ents in Alabama’s 4th Congressional District, I 
include in the RECORD
the names of 63 
healthcare heroes. When history looks upon 
this trying time in our country, they will find the 
names of the men and women of Alabama 
who courageously took on the fight to keep 
the rest of us safe. 
With my utmost gratitude, may the legacy of 
these 63 healthcare heroes live on well into 
the future.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
SERVICE 
OF 
MASTER 
SERGEANT 
HAROLD 
SHOEPFLIN 
HON. RALPH NORMAN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 23, 2021 
Mr. NORMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor and recognize the service of Master 
Sergeant Harold Shoepflin of South Carolina. 
A true American hero, Harold bravely 
served our country throughout World War II, 
the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. In 
1943, he enlisted in the Navy and was sent to 
Camp Perry, Virginia where he was assigned 
to a newly commissioned 72nd Construction 
Battalion. The battalion soon boarded a ship in 
Norfolk before heading to Pearl Harbor. In Ha-
waii, 
the 
battalion 
constructed 
runways, 
Quonset Huts, and a fuel tank field for the 
Navy and Marine Corps. Harold lost several 
close friends during the attack on Pearl Har-
bor. He also lost his brother, Bob, who was 
killed in action in Guam. 
Despite these losses, following World War 
II, Harold enlisted in the Marine Corps. From 
there, he went through Parris Island, Camp 
Lejeune, and Camp Pendleton. When the Ko-
rean War erupted, Harold endured Marine 
Corps Cold Weather Mountain training and 
then traveled to Japan with the 1st Armored 
Amphibious Battalion. 
After serving in Inchon during the Korean 
War, Harold returned to California where he 
spent several years at Camp Pendleton with 
the 7th Marine Engineers, attending various 
Leadership Schools. 
Following the outbreak of the Vietnam War, 
Harold’s battalion shipped out on a landing 
ship tank heading for Da Nang. During his 
time in Vietnam, Harold was assigned to Iron 
Mountain, and was also in charge of Base 
Services Recovery in Chu Lai. 
After these many dangerous tours, Harold 
retired as a Master Sergeant in 1971. As a 
testament to his exemplary military career, 
Harold amassed many notable honors and ac-
colades, including the World War II Navy Oc-
cupation Service Medal, the World War II Vic-
tory Medal, the Navy Commendation Medal 
with Combat ‘‘V,’’ the Presidential Unit Cita-
tion, the American Campaign Medal, and nu-
merous others. Following his military service, 
Harold and his family retired to Charleston, 
South Carolina where he maintained a suc-
cessful career in the insurance and real estate 
industry. He also owned and operated a 
shrimp boat. Harold enjoyed 49 years of bliss-
ful marriage to his beautiful wife Ruth until her 
passing in 1996. Together, the couple raised 
four wonderful children: Debra, Nancy, Joy, 
and Harold Jr. Their son Harold followed in his 
father’s footsteps and went on to serve as a 
major in the Marine Corps. 
On behalf of the 5th District of South Caro-
lina, I thank Harold for his outstanding service. 
He has created a lasting legacy of duty, 
honor, and courage, and our nation is better 
for his sacrifice.

HONORING THE LIFE OF JOSEPH J. 
QUINN, JR. 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 23, 2021 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to mourn and observe the passing of a 
diligent public servant and a passionate com-
munity member, Joseph ‘‘Jack’’ Quinn, Jr. of 
Suffield, Connecticut. A dedicated member in 
local politics and a loving family man, Jack 
passed away on November 7, 2021, sur-
rounded by his loved ones, after 85 years on 
this Earth. 
Born to Joseph J. and Mary Mae Quinn in 
Hartford, 
Connecticut, 
Jack 
demonstrated 
fierce loyalty to our State from the get-go. 
Jack’s life-long intention was to improve what 
our region had to offer his fellow neighbors by 
way of hard work and civic engagement. This 
intention extended through every aspect of his 
life—even for his professional career, Jack 
chose to serve an impressive 37-years with 
the Connecticut Department of Transportation 
before moving on to a rightfully deserved re-
tirement. 
Of course, Jack’s personal commitment to 
improving his own community went far deeper 
than just an occupation with the State. His in-
trinsic community-oriented perspective encour-
aged his involvement within state and local 
politics throughout the entirety of his life. He 
was an ardent member of the local Demo-
cratic Town Committee, leading to various 
roles of service with the Town of Suffield, in-
cluding a stint in leadership as a selectman. In 
his tenure with the municipal government, Jo-
seph helped the town oversee several prior-
ities from managing operations of the Suffield 
Police Department, to uplifting and preserving 
Suffield’s 350 years of history, to improving 
proper traffic safety and the town’s infrastruc-
ture. Beyond his time as selectman, it is worth 
noting Jack maintained his ability to advocate 
for the interests of the Suffield community 
through an innumerable amount of settings— 
acting as a traditional participant in state con-
ventions, serving as a commissioner for the 
Suffield Police Commission, a member for the 
Pedestrian and Traffic Safety and Infrastruc-
ture Committee, serving on Suffield’s Water 
Pollution Control Authority and additionally the 
Vice Chairman of the Heritage Committee. 
Throughout his impassioned involvement 
with the town, Joseph unwaveringly prioritized 
Suffield’s best interests and sought to leave 
the town and its government even better than 
when he began his work. Armed with the vital-
ity brought by his own sense of dedication, 
Jack kept a busy, local presence even into his 
latest years, working at Vinnie’s Little Acre in 
Windsor Locks over the holidays, utilizing his 
younger experience as a florist to produce ar-
rangements for and share stories with fellow 
community members. 
Madam Speaker, Joseph Quinn, Jr. was a 
diligent civil servant who deeply and consist-
ently enriched the lives of those within the 
community. I have had the honor to represent 
the Town of Suffield for many years in Con-
gress and have seen Jack’s dedicated work 
firsthand. He epitomized what it meant to be 
a loyal public servant and a passionate com-
munity member. In his passing, Joseph leaves 
behind his loving wife, Corrine, three children: 
Katherine, Lisa, and Joseph Quinn III, as well 
as several grand and great-grandchildren. He 
loved spending time with them and will be re-
membered as a passionate family member. 
His memory will undoubtedly live on through 
his family as well as within the Suffield com-
munity which he served. To that end, I ask 
that my colleagues and this Chamber join me 
in remembering Joseph’s legacy and express-
ing our deepest respect for Joseph’s work and 
life.

HONORING THE 15TH 
ANNIVERSARY OF SRCTEC 
HON. JOHN KATKO 
OF NEW YORK

Tuesday, November 23, 2021 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the 15th Anniversary of SRCTec, a 
manufacturing and lifecycle management firm 
in Central New York that has developed and 
built some of the most groundbreaking tech-
nologies to solve defense, environmental, and

In its 15 years of operation, SRCTec has

award-winning electromechanical products that 
have strengthened our nation’s defense. The

supplier to the U.S. Army and has received 
the Army’s Top Ten Inventions Award for its 
stellar work to develop the CREW Duke sys-
tem, which prevents remote detonation of im-
provised explosive devices. SRCTec also re-
ceived the Army’s Top Ten Inventions Award 
for its Lightweight Counter-Mortar Radio, 
which provides continuous surveillance of 
rocket, artillery, and mortar threats to Amer-
ican troops. 
Aside from SRCTec’s commitment to quality 
manufacturing, the firm is also an active part

tions to Central New York and worked to im-

IN RECOGNITION OF NORTHEAST 
WISCONSIN’S 2021 VETERAN OF 
THE YEAR, RYAN LONERGAN 
HON. MIKE GALLAGHER 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 23, 2021 
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, it is my 
honor to recognize Northeast Wisconsin’s 
2021 Veteran of the Year, Ryan Lonergan. His 
service on and off the battlefield, his dedica-
tion to fellow veterans, and his devotion to 
Wisconsin’s 8th Congressional District makes 
him well-deserving of this recognition. 
The Northeast Wisconsin Veteran of the 
Year is chosen annually by a selection com-
mittee consisting of members from the veteran 
and civilian community. It recognizes veterans 
in Northeast Wisconsin who continue to dem-
onstrate service, excellence, and dedication in 
all that they do. 
A native of Southeastern Wisconsin, Ryan 
served 6 years in the Army National Guard in-
cluding a 2009 deployment to Iraq. During 
Ryan’s service he received numerous medals 
and achievements, including but not limited to, 
the Army Achievement Medal, Army Good 
Conduct Medal, National Defense Service Rib-
bon, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, 
and Iraq Campaign Medal with Campaign 
Star. 
Ryan’s service to his fellow veterans and 
dedication to our country did not stop upon re-
turning home. Ryan has been a tireless advo-
cate and ally for veterans in the Fox Valley 
and Northeast Wisconsin. Every day he helps 
veterans transition to civilian life by providing 
crucial job and career preparation. Two incred-
ible examples of Ryan’s continued support of 
the veteran community include working with 
the Outagamie County Veteran Service Officer 
to find a home for a World War II veteran’s 
Purple Heart and connecting the next of kin of 
a local Navy Seal with his ribbons and medals 
which included a Silver Star with Valor and 
Navy Seal Trident. 
Ryan has remained dedicated to creating 
and cultivating a strong veteran community in 
the Fox Valley. He plays a key role in orga-
nizing an annual archery event and has 
partnered with numerous local businesses to 
coordinate extraordinary experiences for our 
veterans. From his help with Wheels for War-
riors to his Fragout Podcast, Ryan continues 
to advocate for his fellow veterans. 
Madam Speaker, I once again congratulate 
Ryan Lonergan for his service to Northeast 
Wisconsin and the veteran community, and on 
being the 2021 Northeast Wisconsin Veteran 
of the Year. Northeast Wisconsin can be 
proud of the many great veterans who call the 
8th Congressional District home, and I urge all 
colleagues to join me in recognizing these out-
standing men and women.

HONORING JAN FAKER FOR HER 
SERVICE TO HOOSIERS 
HON. JACKIE WALORSKI 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 23, 2021 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Jan Faker for her service 
to Indiana’s 2nd District as Constituent Liaison 
in my Rochester, Indiana, office and congratu-
late her on a remarkable 27-year career in 
service to Hoosiers. As Jan retires and begins 
the next chapter in her life, it is my great privi-
lege to honor her many achievements and to 
express my sincerest appreciation for all she 
has done for our community, our State, and 
our country. 
Jan specializes in senior issues and has 
helped more than 1,500 individual constituents 
throughout her time as a congressional staffer. 
Her career began in 1994 as Staff Assistant 
for Rep. Steve Buyer (IN–04), and she has 
proved to be an invaluable asset in every role 
since. When Rep. Buyer retired in 2011, she 
took her talents to the Senate where she 
served as Sen. Dan Coats’ Director of Con-
stituent Services for Indiana until becoming 
Constituent Liaison in my office in 2015. 
I cannot thank Jan enough for going above 
and beyond for 2nd District Hoosiers. Her vast 
knowledge of bureaucracy and her ample net-
work of contacts equipped her to answer al-
most any question, cut through miles of red 
tape, and provide solutions to individuals and 
families who felt boxed into a corner. For 
Members of Congress, our caseworkers are 
often considered our miracle workers. Jan’s 
compassion, dedication, and tenacity make 
her one of the best, and I could always count 
on her to take on challenges and be prag-
matic, effective, and supportive. 
Jan’s expertise and dedication will surely be 
missed. I’m certain Hoosiers across the State 
are grateful for her help in stewarding them 
through the complexities of Medicare enroll-
ment during her 15 years of teaching ‘‘Medi-
care 101’’ in partnership with the Indiana State 
Health Insurance Assistance Program. From 
healthcare to Social Security and pensions, 
Jan has helped so many Indiana families navi-
gate complex challenges with grace and 
poise. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in congratulating Jan Faker on her retire-
ment and thanking her for her decades of 
service to the 2nd District and the United 
States of America.

CONGRATULATING THE ZUNI 
CROSS-COUNTRY BOYS TEAM 
HON. TERESA LEGER FERNANDEZ 
OF NEW MEXICO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 23, 2021 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam Speak-
er, I am pleased to send my congratulations to 
the Zuni Cross-Country Boys Team who won 
the New Mexico State Cross Country Cham-
pionships for 2021. Their win is even more im-
pressive during a pandemic that made it im-
possible to train last year. They make us all 
proud. 
Zuni’s cross-country program is in a class of 
its own. I am so impressed with its leadership 
in the running world especially in hosting one 
of the largest meets with more than 30 
schools in attendance. It is an honor to rep-
resent a community where the running culture 
is so strong. 
I extend my warmest wishes for the future. 
I have no doubt Zuni will continue to impress 
us all through the ages.

HONORING THE CAREER OF MR. 
BILL BRADLEY 
HON. JIM BANKS 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 23, 2021 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Mr. Bill Bradley for his service to La-
Grange County, Indiana. Residents of La-
Grange County owe Bill a debt of gratitude for 
his role in making the region a better place to 
live and do business. 
The LaGrange County EDC works to attract 
new investment to, and strengthen local busi-
ness in, the county. They do so quite success-
fully. LaGrange County’s unemployment rate 
is roughly half that of the national average, 
and future job growth over the next ten years 
is predicted to be 47.4 percent, considerably 
higher than the U.S. average of 33.5 percent. 
At the helm of the LaGrange County EDC 
for the last three years has been Bill, a stal-
wart champion of business in northern Indiana 
for nearly three decades. He also led the Jay 
County Development Corporation; helped in 
the creation of the New Allen Alliance, the 
Adams County Economic Development Cor-
poration, and the Economic Development Cor-
poration of Elkhart County; and served the Lo-
gansport-Cass County Economic Development 
Foundation and the Wabash Economic Devel-
opment Corporation. Additionally, he has 
served as a board member of the Indiana 
Economic Development Association, several 
workforce developments boards, and has 
been an active Rotarian most of his career. 
His career is remarkable, and our region is 
more prosperous because of him. 
As Bill prepares to retire, let this document 
serve as a testament to Bill and his life’s work, 
for which LaGrange County, and the whole of 
northeast Indiana, is grateful.

OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 23, 2021

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E1271 
November 23, 2021 
Mr. Pearce was born in Pecos County, 
Texas and moved to Alabama when he was 
only 14 years old. From a very young age he 
had a strong interest in the weather and 
began taking and observing daily temperate 
readings in November of 1961. 
Since then, his passion and dedication has 
led him to aiding the daily operations of mete-
orologists across the state. His expertise in to-
pography has proven essential to under-
standing and communicating to the public the 
importance of elevation temperature changes 
on our climate in Alabama. 
During his time observing the weather in 
Hamilton, he saw the many ways our weather 
can reach the extremes. Back in January of 
1966, he recorded his record low temperature 
of ¥19 degrees. This was the same day the 
state of Alabama set its record low tempera-
ture of ¥27 degrees recorded at New Market 
in Madison County. On the other end of the 
meteorological spectrum, Mr. Pearce recorded 
his record high temperature in August of 2007. 
His recording station hit 109 degrees during a 
record setting heat and drought that impacted 
all of Alabama. 
The National Weather Service is honored to 
have an observer such as Mr. Pearce on their 
side and presented him with the Lifetime 
Achievement Award on November 2, 2021. 
Mr. Pearce was married to Rosemary Ritchie 
Pearce for more than six decades. She 
passed away in 2019. 
They had two children, son Eddie Pearce III 
and daughter Shawn Armstrong. 
I want to congratulate Mr. Pearce on this 
well-deserved achievement as he portrays a 
great example of the genuine, hard-working 
people who make up Alabama’s 4th District. I 
want to wish him all the best and thank him 
for his service to his community, Marion Coun-
ty, and all of Alabama.
