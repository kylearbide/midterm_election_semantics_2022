CRISES ON PRESIDENT BIDEN’S 
WATCH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. JOYCE) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, since President Biden took of-
fice, more than 2 million illegal immi-
grants have been apprehended at our 
southern border. 
Now, Title 42, a key portion of our 
border security, is set to expire at the 
same time that our Border Patrol 
agents are preparing for a record surge 
of illegal border crossings. 
The American people cannot afford 
President Biden’s and proclaimed bor-
der czar Vice President HARRIS’ failed 
border policies. 
On President Biden’s watch, we have 
seen record-high levels of cocaine, 
methamphetamine, and fentanyl being 
trafficked into our communities from 
across our open southern border. These 
drugs are deadly, and over 93,000 Amer-
icans have died of overdoses just in the 
past year. These policies have made 
Americans less safe, and they have 
made our communities less secure. 
In his fiscal year 2023 budget, Presi-
dent Biden failed to even mention our 
border security crisis, a border security 
crisis that affects each and every 
American community. The truth of the 
matter is, President Biden has no plan 
to secure our border. President Biden 
has no plan to secure our communities. 
Without the proper funding for our 
Border Patrol agents, this surge in ille-
gal border crossings will lead to a hu-
manitarian crisis, a drug crisis, and a 
national security disaster. 
President Biden has failed to address 
the challenges that we are facing today 
on our southern border. It is time to 
keep our communities safe. It is time 
to fund our border security. It is time 
to reauthorize Title 42, and it is time 
to secure our southern border. Today, 
the actions must occur. 
f 
UKRAINE MUST BE THE CENTER 
OF THE UNIVERSE AT THIS TIME 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Pennsylvania (Ms. WILD) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. WILD. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today not just as the Representative 
for Pennsylvania’s Seventh District, 
but also as the Representative of one of 
the largest Ukrainian-American com-
munities in our entire country. 
Today, my constituents are gutted. 
These horrific images of Bucha are 
seared into their hearts and minds for-
ever. When they see these images, they 
are thinking of their sons and daugh-
ters, brothers and sisters, mothers and 
fathers, and aunts and uncles who have 
gone from living peaceful lives to being 
martyrs in an unprovoked war of 
choice that had absolutely no reason 
for occurring. 
When we see these images, we need to 
think of an average suburban neighbor-
hood here in the United States and try 
to imagine what it would be like to 
have our homes, our families, our 
neighbors destroyed without provo-
cation, without any cause whatsoever. 
I look at this photo of a woman with 
freshly manicured nails, and as any 
woman viewing this knows, when she 
had her nails done, perhaps in anticipa-
tion of an evening out with friends, 
this victim of slaughter wasn’t imag-
ining that her beautiful bright red 
nails were going to be displayed around 
the world as evidence of carnage. 
There is enormous grief in my com-
munity, and there is enormous right-
eous anger and indignation. I am here 
to echo that anger and that indigna-
tion and to say that we will not accept 
this. We will stand up against it. 
The United Nations Security Council 
must authorize an independent inves-
tigation into the crimes that were 
committed in Bucha. Since Russia will 
almost certainly veto, it is crucial that 
we immediately find another path to 
move forward with such an investiga-
tion. This is not up to Vladimir Putin. 
His crimes are now for the world to 
judge and for history to record. Now is 
not the time for messaging resolutions 
by the United Nations and others. It is 
time for action by every democratic 
country in the world. We cannot stand 
back. 
As the Nobel Laureate and Holocaust 
survivor Elie Wiesel said, ‘‘Sometimes 
we must interfere. When human lives 
are endangered, when human dignity is 
in jeopardy, national borders and sen-
sitivities become irrelevant. Wherever

April 4, 2022 
men or women are persecuted because 
of their race, religion, or political 
views, that place must—at that mo-
ment—become the center of the uni-
verse.’’ 
Ukraine must be the center of the 
universe right now, for as long as it 
takes. The Grammy Awards, the NCAA 
tournaments, and our favorite tele-
vision shows are a welcome diversion, 
but let that diversion be short. Don’t 
lose focus of the center of the universe, 
which right now must be Ukraine. 
The work of delivering justice can 
start here. Every democratic country 
must investigate and ensure that im-
plicated Russian officials, oligarchs, 
and their families are barred from en-
tering their borders. Together, the 
international community must come 
together to send the message that no 
country can commit war crimes and 
see them go unpunished. 
I urge President Biden to take the 
step I called on him to take back in the 
first week of March. Work with our Eu-
ropean allies to take all Russian finan-
cial institutions, not just some, off the 
SWIFT system. The cost of this inva-
sion must be beyond unsustainable for 
Putin and the oligarchs around him. It 
must become literally unbearable. 
But we must do more. We must pro-
vide the Ukrainian people with the full 
range of military aid that they need— 
drones, 
armored 
vehicles, 
machine 
guns, planes, night vision devices, 
every single weapon of war that they 
need for their defense. And time is of 
the essence. 
It goes without saying that contin-
ued humanitarian assistance must be 
provided on an ongoing basis. The fact 
that we have private American citi-
zens—and I know some of them—who 
are delivering medical supplies and 
other necessities into Ukraine more 
quickly than we or our NATO allies are 
is incomprehensible. But I also laud 
those citizens. 
The extraordinary courage and resil-
ience of the Ukrainian people is a chal-
lenge to us all. How much will they 
have to bear? How long will we let 
these 
crimes 
continue? 
Enough 
is 
enough. 
We will never forget. We will never 
lose sight of the fact that our shared 
humanity is at stake in this barbaric 
invasion. The Ukrainian people and 
justice and democracy will prevail. The 
Ukrainians will come out as the heroes 
of this story when it is told in the his-
tory books. But let us, too, come out as 
the helpers, the ones who did every-
thing we possibly could to help them 
achieve victory and restore their coun-
try.

THE LEFT IS LIVING A LIE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. CAWTHORN) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. CAWTHORN. Madam Speaker, 
the left has ripped away the pen of 
truth from the author of life. They 
have exchanged natural science for a 
party platform and declared war on bi-
ology. Your leftwing movement is forc-
ing children to endure radical expres-
sions of sexuality, and yet, you can’t 
even define what a woman is. 
You might amend a bill, but you will 
never amend biology. Science is not 
Burger King. You can’t just have it 
your way. 
I am the youngest member of the 
House of Representatives, and I never 
imagined that one of my sacred duties 
in this hallowed Chamber would be ex-
plaining to the House Speaker the dif-
ference between a man and woman. 
Take notes, Madam Speaker, I am 
about to define what a woman is for 
you: 
XX 
chromosomes, 
no 
tallywhacker. It is so simple. 
And yet today, this proclamation of 
fundamental scientific fact will cause 
the woke liberals in Silicon Valley to 
strip you of your voice and ban you 
until you bow at their altar of false-
hoods. Patriots like Charlie Kirk and 
Tucker Carlson have been muzzled on 
Twitter for promoting the dangerous 
and bigoted ideology called science. 
Madam Speaker, you and your party 
are living a lie. The Babylon Bee is a 
more reliable source of fact than you. 
Perhaps it will click when you hand 
the gavel to Republicans and realize 
that truth is king. It reigns with the 
American people; and you, Madam 
Speaker, never will again. 
f 
ACCESS TO LIFESAVING 
MEDICATION 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Mrs. CHERFILUS-MCCORMICK) 
for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. 
CHERFILUS-MCCORMICK. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to applaud my 
colleagues for passing the Affordable 
Insulin Now Act, which will lower costs 
for hardworking families by capping 
the out-of-pocket costs for insulin at 
$35 per month. This legislation is about 
putting the health of our citizens be-
fore profit. 
Rising by 54 percent from 2014 to 2019, 
the cost of insulin has created an af-
fordability crisis for the 9.8 percent of 
Floridians living with diabetes, which 
is roughly 2.8 million residents. 
Nobody should be forced to choose 
between paying for rent and protecting 
their health. More than half of Ameri-
cans have less than 3 months’ worth of 
expenses covered in an emergency fund. 
That total includes one in four Ameri-
cans who indicate having no emergency 
fund at all, up from 21 percent in 2020, 
let alone to have the ability to pay 
more than $300 for a single vial for 
those without adequate insurance. 
While the Affordable Care Act has en-
sured access to healthcare for Ameri-
cans, the cost of healthcare remains far 
too high. 
This legislation will ensure that Flo-
ridians with diabetes pay no more than 
$35 for their lifesaving insulin each 
month. My constituents in Florida’s 
20th Congressional District feel the ef-
fects of rising out-of-pocket costs for 
their insulin. This bill provides them 
with appropriate relief at a time when 
families are struggling to make ends 
meet. 
Americans currently face an average 
price of $98.70 for a unit of insulin; 10 
times higher than in other wealthy na-
tions. One in four Americans who rely 
on insulin have been forced to ration 
doses due to high prices, a last resort 
with potentially fatal consequences. 
Uninsured 
people 
in 
the 
United 
States 
are 
disproportionately 
from 
Black, indigenous, and other commu-
nities of color. For those who do not 
qualify 
for 
Medicaid, 
high 
insulin 
prices can be devastating, forcing them 
to make impossible choices between 
covering different basic needs. 
Unfortunately, 
throughout 
the 
United States, diabetes prevalence has 
increased over the past two decades, 
disproportionately 
affecting 
low-in-
come populations. Even with health in-
surance, particularly high-deductible 
health plans, people can face exorbi-
tant copays and fees that make their 
medicine unaffordable. 
Once the Senate votes in favor of this 
bill, beginning in 2023, private health 
plans shall cover at least one of each 
type of dosage form of insulin and cap 
cost-sharing for a 30-day supply at the 
lesser of $35 or 25 percent of a plan’s ne-
gotiated price. 
Among individuals with private in-
surance, half would save at least $19 
per month, and a quarter would save at 
least $42 per month. Individuals who 
buy their own insurance will experi-
ence the most savings. 
This legislation comes as House 
Democrats continue working to ad-
vance comprehensive reform address-
ing the high cost of prescription drugs. 
I am committed to ensuring that we 
continue to protect the health of all 
Americans. 
Madam Speaker, I strongly urge my 
colleagues in the Senate to pass this 
critical bill.

CELEBRATING THE LIGHTHOUSE 
ON WECC-FM 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. CARTER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 
20th anniversary of 89.3 The Lighthouse 
on WECC-FM. 
Founded in 2002 by husband-and-wife 
duo Paul and Vickie Hafer, The Light-
house has been spreading the Word of 
God 24 hours a day for 20 years. 
Founding Lighthouse Ministry in 
1998, Paul and Vickie selflessly spread 
the holy Word of God to as many peo-
ple as they can. Their radio show on 
WECC-FM now reaches southeast Geor-
gia, northeast Florida, and a worldwide 
online audience. 
Their ministry also provides other 
opportunities for their community, 
such as a ladies’ Bible study group and

Vickie and Paul have dedicated their 
lives to spreading the Word of the Lord 
and ministering to others, and our 
communities are better for it. Their 
tireless work has reached the ears of 
thousands of listeners and will con-
tinue to be heard around the world. 
This 20th anniversary milestone is 
nothing short of remarkable. Thank 
you for what you are doing, and keep 
shining His light.

HONORING THE LIFE OF ISAAC LAROCHE 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize and 
honor the life of Isaac ‘‘Ike’’ LaRoche. 
Ike was born in Darien, Georgia, in 
1942 to the late Lawrence ‘‘Junior’’ 
Edison LaRoche, Sr., and Ethel Ward 
LaRoche. 
He would go on to serve his country 
in the United States Army. Following 
his service, he owned and operated Ike 
LaRoche & Associates. 
Ike selflessly served his community 
by being on the boards of foundations 
such as the Camp Kicklighter Founda-
tion, the YMCA, the Rape Crisis Cen-
ter, and the West Chatham Rotary 
Club. 
His work led to the creation of the 
Pooler Fitness Center, as well as the 
founding of several YMCAs across the 
State of Georgia. This work and dedi-
cation to his community led him to re-
ceive the Robert H. Demere Volunteer 
Award in 2013, the highest volunteer 
award given out by the YMCA, having 
only been presented three times since 
2004. 
Ike’s wife of 56 years, his three chil-
dren, and the whole community will 
miss his presence in their lives, but his 
legacy will live on in the work he ac-
complished. 
HONORING THE SERVICE OF BILL FALLON 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to thank a good 
friend, Deputy Director Bill Fallon, of 
the Federal Law Enforcement Training 
Center in Brunswick, Georgia, for his 
great service to our district. 
Deputy Director Fallon received his 
bachelor of science degree from West-
field State University and his master’s 
degree in national security and stra-
tegic studies from the U.S. Naval War 
College. 
He joined the United States Marshals 
Service in 1988 as a deputy U.S. mar-
shal for the State of Massachusetts. 
In the summer of 2008, Bill was as-
signed as the commander of Operation 
FALCON 2008, which resulted in the ar-
rest of over 19,300 dangerous felons and 
the seizure of 418 firearms. He was 
named The Washington Post’s Federal 
employee of the week for his efforts. 
Bill has also served as the assistant 
director for the United States Marshals 
Service Training Division. At FLETC, 
Bill has been integral in overseeing all 
operations related to the development 
and delivery of collaborative law en-
forcement training for more than 95 
FLETC partner organizations. 
Bill has more than earned his retire-
ment. After his retirement, he will go 
on to be the new county manager for 
the Glynn County Board of Commis-
sioners, where I look forward to con-
tinuing to work with him. 
Congratulations on your retirement, 
Bill, and thanks for all that you have 
done and will continue to do. 
RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE OF COACH JESSE 
CREWS 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
service 
of 
Coach 
Jesse 
Crews 
at 
Charlton County High School. 
Coach Crews has long been a titan in 
Georgia high school athletics. Even be-
fore he was a coach, he was a Charlton 
County High School athlete himself. 
Jesse was born in Folkston, Georgia, 
in 1953. He attended Georgia Southern 
University, receiving a bachelor of 
science in education, and Valdosta 
State University, where he received his 
master’s in education. 
His life of service earned him a well- 
deserved induction into the Georgia 
Athletic Directors Association Hall of 
Fame, class of 2022, and the Dr. Lucia 
B. Norwood award for athletic director 
of the year for all classifications in 
2021. 
Jesse has also been selected to re-
ceive the Georgia Athletic Coaches As-
sociation Dwight Keith State Service 
Award this year. 
When you dedicate your life to the 
betterment of others, it is hard to 
avoid these amazing recognitions. 
Jesse has served on the Charlton 
County Board of Commissioners, as 
well as the Georgia High School Asso-
ciation Board of Trustees Executive 
Committee and Reclassification Com-
mittee. 
His passion for education, athletics, 
and his community has changed the 
lives of many students that he has 
mentored over the years. 
Jesse, we can’t thank you enough for 
what you have done and what you have 
accomplished, and I am proud to be a 
member of the J-Rock Express.

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
O Lord, our Lord, how majestic is 
Your name. All the Earth is filled with 
its praise as the seasons change and 
the winds rise up from the plains to 
proclaim Your glory. Plants emerge 
from the silence of the soil and bloom 
in celebration of Your creative word. 
Animals roam the forests and the 
deserts. Their variety and vulnerabil-
ity, strength and symbiosis testify to 
the eternal balance on which You have 
placed all living things. The driest of 
riverbeds flood when You open the 
heavens, and the oceans retreat at the 
pull of Your power. 
O Lord, our Lord, may we, too, mag-
nify Your name. May our lives respond 
to Your dominion over all. May we re-
flect Your gracious presence, that ev-
eryone we encounter this day would 
feel the warmth of Your fellowship. 
May our words speak the mercy of 
Your truth, that those whom we en-
gage in debate and discussion would 
hear what You would have us each un-
derstand: Your perfect will. 
And may our deeds serve as instru-
ments of Your divine love for the world 
and all who dwell therein. 
In our life, in our speech, in our love, 
we pray that we praise Your name this 
day. By the grace of that majestic 
name, we pray. 
Amen.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair will entertain up to 15 requests 
for 1-minute speeches on each side of 
the aisle. 
f 
RECOGNIZING THE LEGACY OF 
FREDERICK ‘‘DUKE’’ SLATER 
(Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize the memory 
and legacy of a glass-shattering athlete 
from Iowa’s Second Congressional Dis-
trict. 
Frederick ‘‘Duke’’ Slater’s passion 
for football began when his family 
moved to Clinton, Iowa, where Duke 
started playing football at Clinton 
High. 
Duke went on to receive his edu-
cation at the University of Iowa, where 
he won a national championship in 1921 
and was named an All-American. An 
incredible athlete, Duke also competed 
for the Hawkeyes’ track and field 
team, placing third in the hammer 
throw and fourth in the discus while 
helping Iowa win the 1921 national 
title. 
When Duke joined the NFL’s Rock Is-
land Independents, he became the first 
Black lineman in NFL history. He went 
on to become a five-time first-team 
All-Pro selection, retiring after 10 
great years. 
Following his retirement, Duke was 
inducted into the College Football Hall 
of Fame in 1951 and was posthumously 
selected to the Pro Football Hall of 
Fame in 2020. Last year, the University 
of Iowa announced that the field at 
Kinnick Stadium would now be known 
as Slater Field in honor of Duke. 
I am pleased to hear that the local 
community is planning to erect a stat-
ue of Duke at Clinton High School. 
Duke is the embodiment of hard work 
and overcoming obstacles, and I cannot 
wait to see that statue in person. 
f 
BIDEN BUDGET BUST 
(Ms. FOXX asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, President 
Biden’s recently submitted budget for 
fiscal year 2023 is a literal dumpster 
fire. 
His budget confirms what we have 
known all along: He does not have the 
slightest clue what fiscal responsibility 
means. 
Right now, families are facing a 
$3,500 yearly inflation tax, but Presi-
dent Biden wants to spend a whopping 
$73 trillion over the next decade, a 66 
percent increase over the previous 10 
years. Over the next 5 years, inflation 
rates would increase by 2.8 percent. 
In fact, this scheme would be the 
highest sustained government spending 
endeavor in American history. 
Mr. Speaker, President Biden has 
failed to read the room yet again. The 
American people do not want another 
Biden budget bust. 
f 
HELP UKRAINE ACHIEVE VICTORY 
NOW 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, on Friday, The Wall Street 
Journal editorialized: ‘‘Let Ukraine Go 
on Offense Against Russia.’’ 
‘‘As Russia’s war on Ukraine enters 
its sixth week, the script has flipped. 
Russia’s 
advance 
has 
stalled, 
and 
Ukraine now wants to go on offense to 
push back Russian forces from the land 
they have taken. But the country 
needs U.S. and NATO help to do it.’’ 
‘‘Now is the time to help Ukraine 
take the offensive. Reports of demor-
alized Russian forces are more fre-
quent, including defectors who have 
taken equipment with them.’’ 
‘‘Throughout this conflict, the Biden 
administration has been slow. . . . ‘’ 
Now ‘‘is the time to keep the pressure 
on to truly achieve a strategic victory 
for Ukraine and NATO.’’ 
I have faith in the Russian people, a 
great culture betrayed by war criminal 
Putin. There is legislation for defect-
ing Russian troops, diplomats, and 
Duma members to be provided imme-
diate refugee status in America and up 
to $100,000 for any Russian military

CELEBRATING APRIL AS FAITH 
MONTH 
(Mrs. MILLER of Illinois asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Mr. Speak-
er, this month, Americans all over the 
country are celebrating April as Faith 
Month. I rise in support of this effort 
and call on all people of faith to join in 
prayer and celebration. 
As a Member of Congress, I am happy 
to reaffirm my commitment to our 
Judeo-Christian values and freedom of 
religion for all that this country was 
founded on. 
Religious organizations in America 
have a rich history of charitable en-
gagement, helping the sick, poor, and 
afflicted. They should be celebrated for 
their contributions to our way of life.

HONORING THE SALEM LAKES 
FIRE DEPARTMENT 
(Mr. STEIL asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. STEIL. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise 
to honor the men and women of the 
Salem Lakes Fire Department. 
As war has ravaged Ukraine, the fire-
fighters in Salem Lakes, Wisconsin, 
took action. Led by volunteer fire-
fighter Art Stypula, the Salem Lakes 
Fire Department organized a massive 
equipment drive. The effort involved 
fire departments throughout southeast 
Wisconsin and even the Chicago area. 
Turnout gear and other locally col-
lected 
lifesaving 
equipment 
was 
shipped to Poland to help Ukrainian 
firefighters do their job and keep peo-
ple safe. 
I am extremely proud of the Salem 
Lakes Fire Department and the fire-
fighters 
for 
organizing 
desperately 
needed aid to the Ukrainian people. 
I know that Wisconsinites and Amer-
icans across our country will join me 
in thanking them for their efforts. 
They came up with a creative way to 
help Ukraine in its fight for freedom. 
Ukraine’s firefighters and its people 
will be given important resources be-
cause of their charity and their com-
passion. 
Thank you again to the men and 
women of the Salem Lakes Fire De-
partment for their lifesaving work each 
and every day.

VOTE AGAINST JUDGE KETANJI 
BROWN JACKSON 
(Mr. CLYDE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CLYDE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to continue to highlight the ab-
horrent record of President Biden’s 
U.S. Supreme Court nominee, Ketanji 
Brown Jackson, commonly known as 
KBJ. 
In a posthearing written question 
and answer from members of the Sen-
ate Judiciary Committee, KBJ refused 
to comment on whether she believes an 
individual possesses natural rights. 
This is unacceptable. The Declara-
tion of Independence is crystal clear. 
‘‘We hold these truths to be self-evi-
dent, that all men are created equal, 
that they are endowed by their creator 
with certain unalienable rights, that 
among these are life, liberty, and the 
pursuit of happiness.’’ 
Yet, Ketanji Brown Jackson does not 
hold a position on whether individuals 
possess natural rights. This is disquali-
fying, plain and simple. 
Any Senator, Republican or Demo-
crat, that votes to confirm KBJ later 
this week isn’t just voting for a soft- 
on-crime, woke judge. They are also 
voting for a judge who does not recog-
nize the natural rights, or civil rights 
which come from the natural rights, 
given to us by our heavenly creator, 
dangerously ignoring the fundamental 
foundation of our American values.

DATA MAPPING TO SAVE MOMS’ 
LIVES ACT 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 1218) to require the Federal 
Communications Commission to incor-
porate data on maternal health out-
comes into its broadband health maps, 
as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1218 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Data Mapping 
to Save Moms’ Lives Act’’. 
SEC. 2. MAPPING BROADBAND CONNECTIVITY 
AND MATERNAL HEALTH OUTCOMES. 
(a) INCORPORATION OF MATERNAL MORTALITY 
AND SEVERE MATERNAL MORBIDITY DATA.—Not 
later than 180 days after the date of the enact-
ment of this Act, the Federal Communications 
Commission shall incorporate publicly available 
data on maternal mortality and severe maternal 
morbidity, including for not less than 1 year 
postpartum, 
into 
the 
Mapping 
Broadband 
Health in America platform of the Commission. 
(b) CONSULTATION WITH CDC.—The Federal 
Communications Commission shall consult with 
the Director of the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention regarding the maternal mor-
tality and severe maternal morbidity data that 
should be incorporated under subsection (a). 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Ohio (Mr. LATTA) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on H.R. 1218. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of H.R. 1218, the Data Mapping to 
Save Moms’ Lives Act. 
Tragically, the United States has the 
highest rate of maternal mortality 
across developed nations. While mater-
nal mortality and morbidity are prob-
lems that affect women across the 
country, these concerns are especially 
pronounced in Black and Native Amer-
ican communities. Maternal mortality 
rates for Black women are three times 
higher than those of White women, and 
the rate of death for American Indian 
and Alaska Native women is two times 
higher. 
This legislation seeks to provide a 
visualization for the public on how 
connectivity and these health data 
intersect. It will help guide policy-
makers on how to target telehealth 
services to vulnerable populations and 
communities at risk in an effort to re-
duce maternal mortality and morbidity 
in this country. 
For pregnant women, access to tele-
health services like routine checkups, 
health monitoring, and updated pre-
scriptions can go a long way in ensur-
ing the health and safety of both the 
mother and child. 
Specifically, under this legislation, 
the FCC is required to integrate pub-
licly available data related to maternal 
health, including mortality and severe 
morbidity, into its Mapping Broadband 
Health in America platform. The FCC 
will be required to consult with the 
Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention to determine the right data to 
include for this effort. 
I 
commend 
Representatives 
BUTTERFIELD, BILIRAKIS, and BLUNT 
ROCHESTER for their bipartisan efforts 
on this legislation. I also thank Sub-
committee Chairman DOYLE for work-
ing to get this legislation through the 
Communications and Technology Sub-
committee. 
I also commend you, Madam Speak-
er, as the vice chair of the Energy and 
Commerce Committee, because you 
have spent quite a bit of time dealing 
with these maternal mortality issues. 
This initiative, combined with other 
good work we and the executive branch 
have done, will help us better under-
stand 
the 
communications 
barriers 
some pregnant women face so that we 
can then explore connectivity policies 
that help keep these women safe and 
healthy. 
I know the Senate has passed a com-
panion bill recently, led by Senators 
ROSEN and FISCHER. Although there are 
some technical differences between the 
two bills, my hope is that we can get 
those worked out as quickly as possible 
and get this legislation to the Presi-
dent’s desk. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support the Data Mapping to 
Save Moms’ Lives Act in a bipartisan 
manner, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 1218, the Data Mapping to Save 
Moms’ Lives Act, which was introduced 
by Representatives BUTTERFIELD
and 
BILIRAKIS. 
Maternal mortality continues to af-
fect mothers and children across the 
United States, particularly in rural 
areas. The Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee has worked to address this pre-
ventable issue, but unfortunately, chal-
lenges remain. 
Congress has previously taken steps 
to understand which communities are 
most affected and what we can do to 
reverse this alarming trend. 
Today’s legislation will build on ex-
isting tools of the Federal Communica-
tions Commission by incorporating 
publicly available data on maternal 
health outcomes into its Mapping 
Broadband Health in America tool. The 
FCC would be required to work with 
the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention to determine which mater-
nal health outcomes to include. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from Florida (Mr. BILI-
RAKIS), the cosponsor of this legisla-
tion. 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, we 
know that maternal mortality has 
been increasing in the U.S. while de-
clining in other countries, unfortu-
nately. We know these rates are even 
worse for Black women, Madam Speak-
er. 
We also know that lack of broadband 
in today’s society can lead to isolation, 
poorer education outcomes, and fewer 
work opportunities. What we don’t 
know is how broadband access impacts 
maternal health outcomes. Finding 
this out is our goal. 
At the end of the day, we all want to 
lower maternal mortality rates and en-
sure that babies are both healthy and 
grow up with the love and support of 
their mothers. 
I am proud to co-lead this legislation, 
a bipartisan piece of legislation, with 
my good friend, Mr. BUTTERFIELD, who 
we are going to miss because he is re-
tiring after this term, and Ms. BLUNT 
ROCHESTER, another fellow member of 
the Energy and Commerce Committee. 
Madam Speaker, I urge passage of 
this great bill. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from Ohio (Mr. BALDERSON). 
Mr. BALDERSON. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of the Data Map-
ping to Save Moms’ Lives Act. 
The United States is one of the few 
Nations in the world experiencing a 
rise 
in 
pregnancy-related 
deaths, 
claiming the lives of hundreds of moms 
each year. Behind each of these cases 
are stories of heartbreak and devasta-
tion for families and communities. 
We must do more to improve health 
outcomes for moms and babies across 
this country, and telehealth services 
will play a critical role in doing so.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4134 
April 4, 2022 
This bill would instruct the FCC to 
work with the CDC to incorporate pub-
licly available data on severe maternal 
morbidity and mortality into its Map-
ping Broadband Health in America 
platform. 
Using this data, we can more accu-
rately identify the communities with 
high maternal morbidity and mortality 
rates 
that 
lack 
broadband 
connectivity. This will allow for the 
government to better target areas with 
critical telehealth services and, ulti-
mately, pave the way for better health 
outcomes for new and expecting moth-
ers. 
Madam Speaker, I strongly urge all 
of my colleagues to support this bill. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, again, 
I rise in support of H.R. 1218, the Data 
Mapping to Save Moms’ Lives Act, and 
I urge all Members to support this leg-
islation. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
urge bipartisan support for this bill as 
part of our continued effort to address 
maternal mortality, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of H.R. 1218, the ‘‘Data 
Mapping to Save Moms’ Lives Act’’ which di-
rects the Federal Communications Commis-
sion to identify areas of the country where 
poor maternal health rates overlap with defi-
ciencies in broadband access that are needed 
to effectively deploy telehealth services. 
In the United States, black women are 2 to 
6 times more likely to die from complications 
of pregnancy than white women, depending 
on where they live. 
Dating back to maternity mortality analysis 
from 1979 to 1992, the overall pregnancy-re-
lated mortality ratio was 25.1 deaths per 
100,000 for black women, 10.3 for Hispanic 
women, and 6.0 for non-Hispanic white 
women. 
During 2011–2015, the pregnancy-related 
mortality ratios were— 
42.8 deaths per 100,000 live births for black 
non-Hispanic women; 
32.5 deaths per 100,000 live births for 
American Indian/Alaskan Native non-Hispanic 
women; 
14.2 deaths per 100,000 live births for 
Asian/Pacific Islander non-Hispanic women; 
13.0 deaths per 100,000 live births for white 
non-Hispanic women; and 
11.4 deaths per 100,000 live births for His-
panic women. 
Madam Speaker, Black women in the 
United States experience unacceptably poor 
maternal health outcomes, including dispropor-
tionately high rates of death related to preg-
nancy or childbirth. 
Both societal and health system factors con-
tribute to high rates of poor health outcomes 
and maternal mortality for Black women, who 
are more likely to experience barriers to ob-
taining quality care and often face racial dis-
crimination throughout their lives. 
Health inequity stems from economic in-
equality and its contributing factors including 
sexism and racism. To that point, Black 
women are typically paid just 63 cents for 
every dollar paid to white, non-Hispanic men. 
Median wages for Black women in the 
United States are $36,227 per year, which is 
$21,698 less than the median wages for white, 
non-Hispanic men. 
These lost wages mean Black women and 
their families have less money to support 
themselves and their families and may have to 
choose between essential resources like hous-
ing, childcare, food, and health care. 
These trade-offs are evident in Black wom-
en’s health outcomes and use of medical care. 
Compared to white women, Black women 
are more likely to be uninsured, face greater 
financial barriers to care when they need it 
and are less likely to access prenatal care. 
Black women experience higher rates of 
many preventable disease and chronic health 
conditions including diabetes, hypertension, 
and cardiovascular disease. 
When Black women choose to become 
pregnant, these health conditions influence 
both maternal and infant health outcomes. 
To improve Black women’s maternal health, 
we need a multi-faceted approach that ad-
dresses Black women’s health across the life-
span, improves access to quality care, ad-
dresses social determinants of health and pro-
vides greater economic security. Comprehen-
sive data on maternal health is certainly a part 
of that approach. 
Black women are three to four times more 
likely to experience a pregnancy-related death 
than white women. 
Black women are more likely to experience 
preventable maternal death compared with 
white women. 
Black women’s heightened risk of preg-
nancy-related death spans income and edu-
cation levels. 
Black women experience more maternal 
health complications than white women. Black 
women are more likely to experience com-
plications throughout the course of their preg-
nancies than white women. 
Black women are three times more likely to 
have fibroids (benign tumors that grow in the 
uterus and can cause postpartum hem-
orrhaging) than white women, and the fibroids 
occur at younger ages and grow more quickly 
for Black women. 
Black women display signs of preeclampsia 
earlier in pregnancy than white women. This 
condition, which involves high blood pressure 
during pregnancy, can lead to severe com-
plications including death if improperly treated. 
Black women experience physical ‘‘weath-
ering,’’ meaning their bodies age faster than 
white women’s due to exposure to chronic 
stress linked to socioeconomic disadvantage 
and discrimination over the life course, thus 
making pregnancy riskier at an earlier age. 
Primarily Black-serving hospitals provide 
lower quality maternity care, where seventy- 
five percent of Black women give birth. 
Those same hospitals also have higher 
rates of maternal complications than other 
hospitals. They also perform worse on 12 of 
15 birth outcomes, including elective deliv-
eries, non-elective cesarean births and mater-
nal mortality. 
Many Black women have a difficult time ac-
cessing the reproductive health care that 
meets their needs. Access to reproductive 
health care, which helps women plan their 
families, improves health outcomes for women 
and children. 
Black women experience higher rates of un-
intended pregnancies than all other racial 
groups, in part because of disparities in ac-
cess to quality contraceptive care and coun-
seling. 
Many Black women lack access to quality 
contraceptive care and counseling. 
For example, in a recent analysis of Cali-
fornia women enrolled in Medicaid, Black 
women were less likely than white or Latina 
women to receive postpartum contraception, 
and when they did receive it, they were less 
likely to receive a highly effective method. 
Black women’s access to abortion is limited, 
and they may be more likely to experience the 
ill effects of abortion restrictions—such as de-
layed care, increased costs or lack of access 
to care. 
Black and Hispanic adults in the United 
States remain less likely than White adults to 
say they own a traditional computer or have 
high-speed internet at home, according to a 
Pew Research Center survey conducted Jan. 
25 to Feb. 8, 2021. 
In addition, only 40 percent of Black adults 
report having broadband access in their 
homes. This figure is another testament to the 
inhibitions black women face in getting the 
care they need, which this act aims to resolve. 
It is for that reason Madam Speaker I sup-
port the ‘‘Data Mapping to Save Moms’ Lives 
Act.’’ 
Comprehensive data on maternal health will 
play a role in saving the lives of pregnant 
black women, so I am proud to support this 
Act. 
Though there is still much work to be done, 
this bill is a good first step in the right direc-
tion. I urge my colleagues to support this po-
tentially life-saving piece of legislation. 
For far too long black women have dis-
proportionately suffered lower maternal health 
rates and outcomes. The passage of this Act 
finally provides us a route to remediation. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1218, as

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4135 
April 4, 2022 
SEC. 2. UPDATE OF MEMORANDUM OF UNDER-
STANDING ON SPECTRUM COORDI-
NATION BETWEEN NTIA AND FCC. 
Not later than December 31, 2022, the National 
Telecommunications and Information Adminis-
tration and the Federal Communications Com-
mission shall update the Memorandum of Un-
derstanding on Spectrum Coordination entered 
into in January 2003, to— 
(1) improve upon the process for resolving fre-
quency allocation disputes in shared or adjacent 
allocations between the National Telecommuni-
cations and Information Administration and the 
Federal Communications Commission to ensure 
that such disputes are definitively resolved in 
an efficient and timely manner; 
(2) ensure that spectrum is used efficiently; 
and 
(3) establish reasonable timelines for the ex-
change of information between the National 
Telecommunications and Information Adminis-
tration and the Federal Communications Com-
mission in order to maintain effective spectrum 
coordination and collaboration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Ohio (Mr. LATTA) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on H.R. 2501. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of H.R. 2501, the Spectrum Coordi-
nation Act. 
Our 
country’s 
airways 
are 
foundational to next-generation wire-
less networks. These networks offer so 
much promise to better our lives, as 
they can promote enhanced telehealth 
services and educational opportunities 
and offer new ways of engaging in en-
tertainment and e-commerce. These 
networks can also help propel advance-
ments in manufacturing and enhance 
critical public safety communications 
to save lives. 
b 1715 
But to achieve these important ob-
jectives, our airwaves must be man-
aged competently and correctly. Unfor-
tunately, in recent years, our country 
has not hit this mark. Instead, the two 
agencies charged by Congress to man-
age the public’s airwaves, the FCC and 
the National Telecommunications and 
Information Administration, or NTIA, 
have often bickered and refused to co-
ordinate their efforts. 
I am pleased to see that with new 
leadership over the last year, the FCC 
and NTIA have begun to make some 
headway towards ensuring the Federal 
Government once again speaks with 
one voice in overseeing our airwaves. 
H.R. 2501 helps advance the ball even 
further. This legislation requires the 
FCC and NTIA to update their memo-
randum of understanding on spectrum 
coordination by the end of this year. 
The last time this MOU was updated 
was in 2003, and much has changed 
since then. An updated MOU will reaf-
firm the commitment of these two 
agencies to provide and allocate our 
airwaves in a way that best serves con-
sumers, commercial carriers, and Fed-
eral agencies in the days and months 
to come. 
Over the past several years, the En-
ergy and Commerce Committee has 
worked on a bipartisan basis on several 
important telecommunications mat-
ters. I want to commend Subcommittee 
Chairman DOYLE
and Representative 
BILIRAKIS for continuing this tradition 
through their leadership and bipartisan 
work in advancing this bill out of the 
committee. I hope the Senate can fol-
low suit soon. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to likewise support the Spec-
trum Coordination Act in a bipartisan 
manner, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 2501, the Spectrum Coordi-
nation Act, which was introduced by 
Representative BILIRAKIS. 
For decades, the United States has 
led the world in wireless innovation. 
That leadership was built on effective 
spectrum management. As we look to 
beat China and usher in the next wave 
of wireless technology, we must con-
tinue to make more spectrum avail-
able, both for commercial and govern-
ment uses. 
As the demand for more wireless 
technology grows, spectrum manage-
ment decisions, like balancing com-
mercial and government uses, have be-
come more complex. 
For nearly a century, the Federal 
Communications Commission has ef-
fectively managed commercial spec-
trum use. As the expert technical agen-
cy on spectrum matters, the FCC must 
continue to rely on science and engi-
neering as its guide. 
Just as the demand for commercial 
spectrum continues to grow, so does 
demand for government spectrum, spe-
cifically for use by Federal agencies. 
Access to spectrum is an important in-
gredient to the missions of many Fed-
eral 
agencies. 
The 
National 
Tele-
communications and Information Ad-
ministration, the NTIA, is also respon-
sible for managing Federal spectrum 
uses. 
The NTIA and the FCC must work to-
gether to maintain the United States’ 
wireless leadership, and it is essential 
that the NTIA continues to lead the ex-
ecutive branch’s spectrum coordination 
efforts. 
To help formalize these coordination 
efforts, in 2003 the FCC and the NTIA 
signed 
a 
memorandum 
of 
under-
standing to coordinate Federal and 
non-Federal spectrum matters to en-
sure our spectrum is put to its highest 
and best use. This interagency agree-
ment has not been updated in nearly 20 
years. 
Today’s legislation requires the FCC 
and the NTIA to update their MOU to 
reflect the new spectrum management 
landscape so the United States will re-
tain its wireless leadership for years to 
come. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
have no additional speakers, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from Florida (Mr. BILI-
RAKIS), the co-lead on this legislation. 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Subcommittee Chair DOYLE, the 
ranking member of the subcommittee, 
and the chairman of the full committee 
as well for their support. 
The spectrum landscape has changed 
dramatically since 2003, Madam Speak-
er, with increased demand for wireless 
spectrum, fueling new technologies and 
possibilities. 
While spectrum auctions have oc-
curred over the years, the memo-
randum 
of 
understanding 
between 
NTIA and the FCC has not been up-
dated to reflect the ever-changing 
landscape. 
While these agencies have recently 
made strides to update the MOU since 
I introduced this bill last Congress, 
codifying this action will ensure that 
these agencies are held accountable to 
get the job done. 
After hearing from both the NTIA 
and the FCC leadership over the last 
several weeks, I am glad to see this leg-
islation move forward in the House and 
encourage the Senate to also see its 
importance 
in 
preventing 
agency 
miscommunication as we manage the 
Nation’s spectrum. 
Madam Speaker, we need to get this 
through. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
continue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from Ohio (Mr. BALDERSON). 
Mr. BALDERSON. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of H.R. 2501, the 
Spectrum Coordination Act. 
Spectrum is a finite and high-demand 
resource that, when allocated cor-
rectly, fuels innovation. The industries 
that use spectrum are rapidly evolving, 
and Federal coordination of spectrum 
should evolve with it. 
That is why I am proud to support 
the Spectrum Coordination Act, spon-
sored by my friend, Congressman BILI-
RAKIS. While the industries that use 
spectrum continue to modernize at an 
accelerating pace, the memorandum of 
understanding between the NTIA and 
the FCC on spectrum coordination has 
not been updated since 2003. 
This commonsense bill would in-
struct the NTIA and FCC to update 
their nearly 20-year-old MOU, ensuring

that they work together seamlessly to 
resolve disputes while ensuring spec-
trum is allocated as efficiently as pos-
sible. I strongly urge all my colleagues 
to support the Spectrum Coordination 
Act. 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume to 
close. 
First, I thank the chairman of our 
Energy and Commerce Committee for 
helping get this bill to the floor. I 
greatly appreciate his work and leader-
ship, and also for the members’ work 
on this, and also the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE), 
as the chair of the Communications 
and Technology Subcommittee. 
As we have heard today, the United 
States has to retain its leadership in 
wireless for the years to come, and it 
really requires the FCC and the NTIA 
to work together, especially on this 
MOU, because of the new spectrum 
management that we have to have out 
there and the landscape that we have. 
Madam Speaker, I urge passage of 
the legislation, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
would ask bipartisan support for this 
bill, which will continue the objective 
of trying to coordinate better between 
the two agencies, the FCC and the 
NTIA. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of H.R. 2501, the ‘‘Spectrum 
Coordination Act’’ which requires the National 
Telecommunications and Information Adminis-
tration and the Federal Communications Com-
mission to update the Memorandum of Under-
standing on Spectrum Coordination to improve 
the process for resolving frequency allocation 
disputes in shared or adjacent spectrum 
bands and ensure the efficient use or sharing 
of spectrum. 
The memorandum of understanding formal-
izes the cooperative relationship between the 
two agencies to ensure that spectrum policy 
decisions promote efficient use of spectrum 
consistent with both the economic interests 
and national security of the Nation. 
Spectrum encompasses a variety of com-
munications, from extremely low frequencies 
which are used by military submarines to com-
municate with one another, to extremely high 
frequencies which allow all of us to use Wi-Fi 
in our homes and at work. 
Spectrum is also critical for air travel, one of 
the most important industries in the United 
States and the world. It provides pilots and air 
traffic controllers the ability to communicate 
from surface to air, ensuring passenger safety 
and scheduled arrival at their destinations. 
In terms of domestic national security, spec-
trum is crucial in saving lives. Due to the dev-
astating effects of climate change, we are see-
ing natural disasters that are more devastating 
than ever before. The effects of these disas-
ters demand an equally significant response 
from our first responders, from local police all 
the way to FEMA. 
Thanks to the manipulability of spectrum, 
we have created dedicated interoperable fre-
quencies for first responders, allowing them to 
effectively communicate with their counterparts 
and save more lives. 
Madam Speaker, properly designating juris-
diction of spectrum or radio wave oversight is 
critical in maintaining this country’s economic 
prosperity and national security. 
Our society is increasingly relying on tech-
nology, and therefore spectrum, every day. 
We must update this memorandum to accu-
rately assess and subsequently assign juris-
diction based on the technological advances 
we have made since the memorandum’s last 
update in 2003. 
Since 2003, the Internet has transitioned 
from a luxury to a commodity, smart phones 
are mandatory to be able to fully participate in 
society, and threats to national security have 
evolved in ways we never thought possible. 
In addition, spectrum allocation will even be 
increasingly important in the distant future. 
Astronomers use specialized devices to 
read radio waves emitted from outer space, al-
lowing us to learn more about the universe 
and its origins. Just last week The South Afri-
can Radio Astronomy Observatory released a 
new image of what it called astronomy’s new-
est mystery: the Odd Radio Circle or ORC. 
Astronomers have spotted only a handful of 
ORCs. They’re huge, about a million light- 
years across which is 16 times bigger than our 
Milky Way galaxy. Despite this, the ORCs are 
hard to see. They’re visible only at radio 
wavelengths. 
Right now, we don’t know what ORCs are 
or what causes them, but one day we will. The 
case could be made that when we do know 
more, it will be objectively critical knowledge 
because humans are explorers, and space is 
our next frontier. 
Space is the next place we will go, and 
maybe not in this generation nor the one after 
that, but one day we will go. Humans will need 
all the information they can get while exploring 
the unknown, and all of it will be thanks to 
radio waves and those who read them and un-
derstood them. Their importance truly cannot 
be understated. 
Madam Speaker, I firmly believe these fac-
tors make updating this memorandum of the 
utmost necessity, so I am proud to support the 
‘‘Spectrum Coordination Act’’ and urge my col-
leagues to as well. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2501, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Madam Speak-
er, on that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

ices may not— 
(1) reinstate the Public Health Service 
interdisciplinary review process described in 
the guidance entitled ‘‘Guidance on Proce-
dures for the Provision of Marijuana for 
Medical Research’’ (issued on May 21, 1999); 
or 
(2) create an additional review of scientific 
protocols that is only conducted for research 
on marijuana other than the review of re-
search protocols performed at the request of 
a qualified marijuana researcher conducting 
nonhuman research that is not federally 
funded, 
in 
accordance 
with 
section 
303(f)(3)(A) of the Controlled Substances Act,

into consideration the factors listed in sec-
tion 201(c) of the Controlled Substances Act 
(21 U.S.C. 811(c)), as well as any potential for 
medical benefits, any gaps in research, and 
any impacts of Federal restrictions and pol-
icy on research, marijuana should be trans-
ferred to a schedule other than schedule I (if 
marijuana has not been so transferred al-
ready).

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Virginia (Mr. GRIFFITH) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on H.R. 5657. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 5657, the Medical Marijuana Re-
search Act. 
Last week, Congress considered and 
passed the MORE Act, which effec-
tively removes marijuana from the 
strictest category of regulation under 
the Controlled Substances Act. Today, 
medical marijuana is approved and reg-
ulated in 37 States, the District of Co-
lumbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the 
U.S. Virgin Islands. These actions 
highlight the need for increased re-
search about safety and efficacy of the 
marijuana products being consumed by 
millions of Americans. 
Unfortunately, 
comprehensive 
re-
search on marijuana has been regu-
lated in a restrictive, time-consuming 
way, and the current body of research 
is not representative of the products 
available to the average American 
adult consumer. 
H.R. 5657 is a bipartisan bill that 
streamlines the registration process for 
scientists seeking to engage in can-
nabis research. It also maintains the 
appropriate oversight and control by 
the Department of Health and Human 
Services and the Drug Enforcement Ad-
ministration. 
The bill requires HHS and DEA to re-
spond to registration applicants in a 
timely manner and expands the num-
ber of federally approved manufactur-
ers and distributors that can supply 
marijuana products for research pur-
poses. 
The bill also creates a special process 
to allow State-authorized marijuana to 
be used for research purposes. This is 
an 
important 
step 
toward 
under-
standing the positive and negative 
health effects of the products being fre-
quently consumed by people across our 
country. 
The House passed this bill by a voice 
vote in the 116th Congress. The Senate 
also passed a similar measure last Con-
gress and did so again by unanimous 
consent last month. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank 
Representatives BLUMENAUER, HARRIS, 
HOLMES
NORTON, 
DINGELL, 
COHEN, 
GRIFFITH, LEE, and CASE for their lead-
ership on this issue. I look forward to 
working with them and our colleagues 
in the Senate to expand comprehensive 
cannabis research and protect the 
health of our constituents. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
strong support of H.R. 5657, the Medical 
Marijuana Research Act. 
I first thank Mr. BLUMENAUER, Mr. 
HARRIS, and, of course, the chairman of 
the committee, but Mr. HARRIS and Mr. 
BLUMENAUER are the lead sponsors of 
this legislation. 
Though our long-term goals for mari-
juana regulation may differ, the three 
of us share a strong conviction that 
scientific data should form the basis 
for policymaking whenever possible. 
For four Congresses now, we have 
joined forces to advocate for more re-
search on the use of cannabis products 
to treat medical conditions. 
My belief that medical marijuana 
probably can be beneficial when used in 
the proper setting for treatment of cer-
tain medical conditions is based large-
ly on anecdotal evidence from con-
stituents and citizens. 
Despite the increasing use of can-
nabis products around the country, 
there have been very few legitimate, 
peer-reviewed studies to determine the 
effects of cannabis on the body, par-
ticularly over a long period of time. 
This lack of research is due, in large 
part, to the Federal Government stand-
ing in the way. Marijuana’s schedule I 
status makes it extremely difficult for 
scientists to, one, obtain approval to 
conduct cannabis research; and, two, 
obtain a quality product of marijuana 
to use for that research.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4139 
April 4, 2022 
H.R. 5657 addresses both of these 
issues. It encourages medical mari-
juana research by establishing a new 
set of research standards that are spe-
cific to cannabis. This will allow can-
nabis to remain classified as a schedule 
I substance while increasing access for 
those who wish to study it. 
It also ensures the availability of 
verified cannabis products necessary 
for legitimate research by establishing 
a new registration process. Entities 
who choose to register and are ap-
proved will be able to legally manufac-
ture and distribute marijuana for the 
purpose of conducting such research. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as she may consume to 
the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. 
DINGELL), who is one of the sponsors of 
this legislation. 
b 1730 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support of the Medical Mari-
juana Research Act, legislation that 
would modernize Federal rules and pro-
cedures to facilitate additional medical 
research into the impacts of medical 
marijuana. 
We have seen dramatic changes in 
the legal status of marijuana at the 
State level, my State included. Sales of 
recreational marijuana began in my 
home State of Michigan in 2019, and 
medical marijuana is now legal in 37 
States. However, the Federal frame-
work for conducting marijuana re-
search is decades old and has not kept 
pace with these changes. 
Currently, scientists in the United 
States looking to conduct research on 
marijuana must contend with a heavy- 
handed, duplicative registration and li-
censure 
process. 
Additionally, 
re-
searchers are limited to using mari-
juana grown at a single location over-
seen by the National Institute on Drug 
Abuse at the University of Mississippi. 
Collectively, these outdated, bureau-
cratic barriers and Federal roadblocks 
greatly limit our understanding of the 
health impacts of marijuana and pre-
vent qualified researchers from engag-
ing in further study. 
The Medical Marijuana Research Act 
will modernize the cumbersome process 
by streamlining marijuana research 
registration applications. It will also 
direct FDA to issue guidelines on the 
production of marijuana and ensure 
that adequate amounts are available 
for research. 
The legislation also mandates a com-
prehensive review of the available body 
of research on marijuana by the Sec-
retary of Health and Human Services 5 
years after enactment. 
I thank my colleagues, Representa-
tives BLUMENAUER, HARRIS, NORTON, 
COHEN, GRIFFITH, BARBARA
LEE, and 
CASE, who led this with me to get this 
legislation passed. 
Additionally, I recognize Chairman 
PALLONE and Ranking Member ROD-
GERS of Washington, as well as the En-
ergy and Commerce Committee staff, 
for their very thoughtful input and ef-
forts. 
Madam Speaker, it is high time we 
modernize our Nation’s Federal regula-
tions to facilitate legitimate medical 
research into the impacts of mari-
juana, and I urge my colleagues to sup-
port this legislation. 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to gentleman from Maryland (Mr. 
HARRIS) as much time as he may con-
sume. 
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Virginia for 
yielding me time. 
Mr. BLUMENAUER and I have jointly 
led and sponsored this bill for four Con-
gresses. Although we disagree about 
recreational marijuana—he supports it; 
I oppose it—as a physician, I realize 
that if we are going to have medical 
marijuana legal, as the gentlewoman 
from Michigan says, in over three 
dozen States, we really ought to do re-
search on it to see what it is used for 
and what it can’t be used for because, 
Madam Speaker, many claims are 
made about it. Some are legitimate; 
some are illegitimate. 
The American public, if we are to 
have this product legal in 37 States 
now, they deserve to know whether it 
works for what the claims are made. 
What this bill does is simple. It 
makes it easier to do rigorous medical 
research, the same type of research we 
expect to be done on any of the drugs 
that are sold as medicines in this coun-
try. That is what this bill does. 
It has been a long time coming. I 
thank the chairman for bringing this 
bill out. Hopefully, it gets across the 
finish line in both Houses and goes to 
the President’s desk for signature. 
Madam Speaker, the American public 
deserves to know what medical mari-
juana is useful for because, again, for 
anyone who has one of the conditions 
that it might be useful for, this could 
be a godsend. For other conditions 
where it is claimed, it will be found to 
be not effective, but the American pub-
lic needs to know. 
The Medical Marijuana Research Act 
is the way to get this done. Modernize 
our research methods. Bring them up 
to the scientific standards we use for 
every other type of medication in this 
country that is sold as a drug. 
Madam Speaker, I support H.R. 5657. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I would say, Madam Chair, you have 
heard the comments from both sides of 
the aisle. We need the research. It is 
good for the American public to know 
whether or not this stuff works. 
But you hear accounts from citizens 
that they are having to buy marijuana 
on the street. Maybe they can get it in 
some of these States now. But when 
you are dealing with epilepsy, for ex-
ample, they have to boil up a tincture 
to make sure that it has the CBD and 
some level of THC, but nobody really 
knows what level of THC is necessary 
to help with juvenile epilepsy. We just 
don’t know. We have no research. 
Parents out there, concerned about 
the well-being of their children, have 
turned their children into guinea pigs. 
Yet, because in many States it is still 
illegal, and was illegal until just a few 
years ago, they haven’t been able to re-
port their findings to anybody who is 
working on this in an official sense. 
It is time that ends. Let’s do research 
on cannabis. I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Let me agree with my Republican 
colleague that this is very important 
because 
there 
really 
hasn’t 
been 
enough research done on marijuana 
and the impacts of it. 
That is why this bill really needs to 
pass, and I urge my colleagues, on a bi-
partisan basis, to support it. I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of H.R. 5657, the Medical 
Marijuana Research Act. 
The purpose of this bill is to amend the 
Controlled Substances Act to make marijuana 
accessible for use by qualified marijuana re-
searchers for medical purposes, and for other 
purposes. 
This bill establishes new, separate registra-
tion requirements to facilitate medical mari-
juana research. 
It will remove the barriers on conducting 
cannabis research, by allowing scientists to 
access products from dispensaries that are le-
gally authorized by state law. 
Current barriers include the burdensome 
registration process, redundant protocol re-
views, lack of adequate research material, and 
unnecessarily onerous security requirements. 
The act will speed up the process for re-
searchers to apply and get approved to study 
cannabis. 
It will also set clear deadlines on federal 
agencies to act on their registration applica-
tions. 
The bill also makes it easier for scientists to 
modify their research protocols without having 
to seek federal approval. 
It would additionally require that the Drug 
Enforcement Administration (DEA) license 
more growers. 
With this requirement there would be no 
limit on the number of additional entities that 
can be registered to cultivate marijuana for re-
search purposes. 
For half a century, researchers have only 
been able to study marijuana grown at the 
University of Mississippi, because it is the only 
federally approved facility. 
These researchers have complained that it 
is difficult to obtain the medical marijuana at 
the facility, and when they do obtain it, it is 
low quality. 
The medical marijuana that researchers at 
the University of Mississippi have access to is 
often compared to industrial hemp, a botanical 
class of Cannabis sativa that is grown specifi-
cally for industrial and medical use. 
There are many differences between hemp 
and marijuana such as:

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4140 
April 4, 2022 
Hemp is specifically bred to produce plants 
because of its strong durable fibers, whereas 
marijuana is bred specifically for its resin prop-
erties, which is used for recreational purposes. 
Hemp is bred to have less than .03 percent 
THC. THC is the mood-altering compound in 
marijuana. Regular marijuana has 1 percent to 
30 percent of THC. 
The hemp plant produces a high level of 
CBD oil and low levels of THC resin. Mari-
juana has a low level of CBD oil, and high lev-
els of THC resin. 
In humans, the CBD oil produced by the 
hemp plant works on the inflammatory sys-
tems of the brain which is why some patients 
say they get relief after using it. Marijuana 
works on the part of the brain that regulates 
mood and hunger. 
The cannabis that government-authorized 
institutions typically access is more like hemp 
than marijuana, and marijuana is what con-
sumers use in the real world. 
These researchers need to have access to 
marijuana and not facility-grown hemp to fur-
ther our education around the drug. 
With this bill, the U.S. Department of Health 
and Human Services (HHS) and the U.S. at-
torney general would be required to create a 
process for marijuana manufacturers and dis-
tributors to supply researchers with cannabis 
from dispensaries. 
This will allow researchers to be able to 
study the recreational marijuana that is being 
used and sold from state-legal businesses, in-
stead of having to use only government grown 
cannabis. 
Ninety-nine percent of Americans live in a 
state that has legalized some form of can-
nabis, yet the federal law is still hindering re-
searchers’ ability to study all the full range of 
health benefits. 
Providing researchers with the actual mari-
juana that consumers are purchasing is the 
only way to provide the most efficient and rel-
evant results. 
We need to stop making researchers jump 
through regulatory hoops in their efforts to 
study the medical potential of the plant. 
Expanding the marijuana studies will help 
ensure that Americans have adequate access 
to these potentially life changing medicines 
and treatments. 
There are about 4 million registered can-
nabis patients in the United States, and likely 
millions more are self-medicating. 
The United States leads the world in bio-
medical research yet research on cannabis, a 
drug that many of our citizens benefit from 
and are already using, lags far behind. 
Limiting the resources for this research will 
leave patients, health care professionals, and 
policy makers without the evidence needed to 
make sound decisions about the use of mari-
juana. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in voting for 
H.R. 5657 because providing the resources for 
this research could make the difference in mil-
lions of lives. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5657, as

mined by reference to the latest statement 
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-

the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. ESHOO) and the gen-
tleman from Virginia (Mr. GRIFFITH) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 1916. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in full support 
of H.R. 1916, the Ensuring Lasting 
Smiles Act. On behalf of the 4 percent 
of American children born annually 
with congenital anomalies or birth de-
fects, I am very proud to sponsor this 
much-needed legislation. 
This bill will ensure that health 
plans do not deny or delay medically 
necessary 
treatment 
of 
congenital 
anomalies. In many cases, coverage for 
well-known anomalies, like heart de-
fects or spina bifida, is already the 
standard. But for babies who have oral 
defects such as cleft palates, skeletal 
defects, congenital cataracts, or hear-
ing defects, insurance companies have 
systematically denied or delayed medi-
cally necessary treatments. 
I became a sponsor of this legislation 
after Kevin Koser testified at our 
Health Subcommittee, which you are a 
member of, Madam Speaker, about his 
beautiful son, Kannon. He shared with 
the subcommittee how Kannon asked 
Santa Claus for teeth so he could 
‘‘chomp big bites’’ of food. 
I was really shaken by that and by 
the fact that in our country, such a 
rich and great country as America, we 
would put treatment that allows a 
child to eat out of reach because of in-
surance red tape. 
A baby named Rosie in my congres-
sional district is one of the 1,300 babies 
born in the United States each year 
with congenital cataracts. In just a few 
months, her family spent over $4,000 
out of pocket on contact lenses for her. 
Without these lenses, babies like Rosie 
are blind, and they have no chance of 
ever developing normal vision. 
These stories are repeated across our 
country every single day, but today is 
the day that we can begin to change 
that. This legislation is one of the 
most popular bills in the House, with 
316 bipartisan cosponsors, including 
more than half of the Republican Con-
ference. 
The time has come for this impor-
tant, popular, and much-needed bill to 
finally pass the House of Representa-
tives. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I am disappointed 
that all Members could not reach an 
agreement on this bill. I have an

H4142 
April 4, 2022 
amendment that would specify the 
types of conditions required to be ad-
dressed by this bill, which would help 
clarify its intent for the implementing 
agencies. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD
the 
text 
of 
my 
proposed 
amendment. 
In the heading of section 2, strike ‘‘CON-
GENITAL ANOMALY OR BIRTH DEFECT’’ and in-
sert ‘‘CRANIOFACIAL, ORAL, OR MAXILLOFACIAL 
CONGENITAL ANOMALY OR BIRTH DEFECT’’. 
In section 2799A–11 of the Public Health 
Service Act, section 726 of the Employee Re-
tirement Income Security Act of 1974, and 
section 9826 of the Internal Revenue Code of 
1986, as proposed to be added by section 2— 
(1) in the heading, strike ‘‘CONGENITAL 
ANOMALY
OR
BIRTH
DEFECT’’ 
and 
insert 
‘‘CRANIOFACIAL, ORAL, OR MAXILLOFACIAL CON-
GENITAL ANOMALY OR BIRTH DEFECT’’; and 
(2) in subsection (a), strike the term ‘‘con-
genital anomaly or birth defect’’ and insert 
‘‘craniofacial, oral, or maxillofacial con-
genital anomaly or birth defect’’ each place 
such term appears. 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, the 
stated goal of the bill is a good one, 
making sure those who, through no 
fault of their own, are born with a con-
dition requiring extensive medical care 
can eat, drink, and thrive. 
I would love to be able to tell fami-
lies like the one in my district with 
two children experiencing ectodermal 
dysplasia that insurance would pay for 
the hundreds of thousands of dollars of 
surgery necessary to allow their teeth 
and mouths to function properly. But 
this bill needs more work, and my 
amendment could have addressed its 
most significant flaw. 
Had the bill gone through regular 
order, I would have offered this correc-
tive amendment. 
The biggest problem here is that not 
one person can articulate which med-
ical procedures or treatments would be 
required to be covered by insurance. 
The bill is titled healthy smiles, ref-
erencing cleft palate, ectodermal dys-
plasia, et cetera, but not one person 
can articulate which medical proce-
dures or treatments would be required 
to be covered by insurance. This is, in 
part, because the FDA has no statutory 
or regulatory definition of what a con-
genital anomaly or birth defect is. 
Further, one part of the bill requires 
insurers to ‘‘include any medically nec-
essary item or service to . . . restore 
any body part to achieve normal body 
functioning or appearance,’’ while an-
other part provides that ‘‘’treatment’ 
shall not include cosmetic surgery.’’ 
Technical comments from the De-
partment of Labor support my belief 
that these two provisions ‘‘seem to be 
in tension.’’ There is a tension between 
the two sections. 
Because the language is so vague, 
CBO found it difficult to estimate the 
cost. 
They 
expressed 
uncertainty 
around identifying the procedures and 
services 
that 
would 
be 
considered 
medically necessary. Nonetheless, they 
took a stab at it and guessed it would 
cost around $1.8 billion. 
My amendment would resolve these 
concerns by replacing the phrase ‘‘con-
genital anomaly or birth defect’’ with 
‘‘craniofacial, oral, or maxillofacial 
congenital anomaly or birth defect’’ to 
specify the types of conditions advo-
cates of this bill have been discussing 
for months. Most of the people who 
signed on as cosponsors thought that 
was just what they were doing. They 
didn’t know they were going to cover, 
as the gentlewoman has said, the 4 per-
cent of children born with any kind of 
a birth defect. 
Given that my amendment cannot be 
considered today, I will be voting ‘‘no.’’ 
Now, you may wonder, how did I 
come to this conclusion? When my old-
est son was born 16 years ago, when I 
called my wife’s father, his first ques-
tion was, ‘‘Does he have all his finger-
nails?’’ because my wife was born with 
a congenital birth defect. She doesn’t 
have fingernails on her index fingers. 
This has caused them to be injured nu-
merous times over the years. 
There is no question it qualifies 
under this bill for some kind of treat-
ment, whether it be an implant to re-
place those nails—if this bill passes, we 
will be doing everything from the 
healthy smiles that the bill purports to 
do all the way down to fingernails. 
Now, she is fine. She has grown up. 
She has adjusted. Everything is good. 
But the first question my father-in-law 
asked was, ‘‘Does he have all his finger-
nails?’’ because, for years, it was a con-
cern to him as a father, as a parent. 
This bill would deal with that, and 
that is why it is hard to say what it is 
going to cost because a lot of smaller 
defects like my wife’s fingernails would 
be covered under this. 
b 1745 
And if it is covered, by golly, you 
know they are going to fix it. The 
worst thing she has to do now is wear 
gloves when we take out the Christmas 
tree and try to be careful. But as a 
child, it was a bigger issue, and like I 
said, the tips of her index fingers are a 
little bulbous. She might be offended 
by this, but if you look closely, it looks 
a little bit like E.T.’s finger, though it 
is not quite as long and it doesn’t light 
up. But it is a birth defect that this bill 
would cover at huge cost to the Amer-
ican public and to the American tax-
payers. 
This bill goes too far. I wish we had 
the opportunity to accept my amend-
ment, which we can’t do on a bill that 
is on suspension, because then we could 
make sure it dealt with the big items 
that only affect a much smaller part of 
the population and that truly do need 
to be dealt with. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, the bill 
that we are taking up today was passed 
by the Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee. It hasn’t changed. The gen-
tleman, Mr. GRIFFITH, had an amend-
ment. He withdrew it. He had the op-
portunity, but he withdrew it. 
Madam Speaker, I yield such time as 
he may consume to the gentleman 
from New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE), the 
chairman of the Energy and Commerce 
Committee. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Chairwoman ESHOO for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of H.R. 1916, the Ensuring Lasting 
Smiles Act, a bipartisan bill that will 
help patients with congenital anoma-
lies and birth defects get the necessary 
treatment that they deserve. 
Three percent of American children 
are born with congenital anomalies or 
birth defects that affect the way they 
look, develop, or function, often for the 
rest of their lives. These children re-
quire serious medical treatment. But 
for far too long, insurance companies 
have been unfairly denying treatment, 
despite an official medical diagnosis, 
by deeming it cosmetic or because the 
treatment involves dental services. 
This is unacceptable. This treatment is 
critically 
important 
and 
medically 
necessary, particularly for children 
with serious dental anomalies. 
During our legislative hearing on 
this bill in committee, we heard from 
Kevin Koser about his family’s long-
standing struggles to get his son 
Kannon’s medical treatment covered. 
Kannon was diagnosed with ectodermal 
dysplasia when he was 1 year old, and 
this had a drastic impact on his health 
and quality of life. Ectodermal dys-
plasia is a congenital anomaly that af-
fects the development of the hair, skin, 
teeth, and other body parts. Kannon 
sprouted his first tooth at the age of 4, 
and this has severely restricted his diet 
and impacted his ability to speak. 
In accordance with the treatment 
plan established by his doctor, his fam-
ily 
began 
pursuing 
dentures 
for 
Kannon; however, their family health 
plan denied the medically necessary 
treatment for Kannon and deemed it as 
not a covered benefit. The Koser family 
is not alone. 
Madam Speaker, there are countless 
children across the country whose 
medically necessary treatments are un-
fairly denied by insurance companies. 
These children may have to forego the 
care they need to live healthy and ful-
filling lives because their families sim-
ply cannot afford the treatment. Too 
often, their families are stuck with the 
financial burden of paying out of pock-
et for medically necessary treatment 
despite having health insurance, and 
children like Kannon are forced to 
delay necessary care that is meant to 
restore bodily function. 
The National Foundation for Ecto-
dermal Dysplasias estimates that some 
families will pay upwards of $150,000 
out of pocket in their lifetime for 
medically necessary treatments. This 
is for medical care that should be 
rightfully covered by insurance. 
The Ensuring Lasting Smiles Act 
will require all individual and group 
market health plans to cover medically 
necessary treatment resulting from 
congenital anomalies and ensure that 
children like Kannon get the treatment 
they need. This is important, common-
sense legislation that 
has—as

April 4, 2022 
ESHOO said—310 bipartisan cosponsors. 
I commend Ms. ESHOO for her leader-
ship on this legislation as the prime 
sponsor of the bill. 
This important bill will improve the 
health and well-being of countless 
Americans and ensure that individuals 
born with congenital anomalies have 
the opportunity to live a healthy life. 
Children like Kannon and his family 
should have the peace of mind to know 
that medically necessary treatment 
will be covered. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this bill. 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, I will submit that 
my amendment was not offered at the 
full committee. Two years ago, when 
we were taking this bill through reg-
ular order, at that time it was dis-
cussed that we would try to work on 
language that would narrow the scope 
before it came to the floor. I assumed 
that that would be done before this bill 
was brought up on a suspension; that 
has not happened. I would be more 
than happy, if we have to come to log-
gerheads over it, that we have that dis-
cussion where we can discuss all the 
potential costs, all the potential birth 
defects that might be covered, includ-
ing the minor ones, the ones that don’t 
have an effect on lasting smiles, which 
is also included in this. 
Now, the gentlewoman’s heart is in 
the right place, and I have great re-
spect for her, and understand what she 
is trying to do. I just think that there 
is so much unknown cost for so many 
minor birth defects and small incon-
veniences that might be cosmetic or 
might not be, depending on which doc-
tor makes that decision, because we 
don’t have a good definition either in 
the bill or in the standard lingo of the 
FDA, et cetera. 
I think we are buying a whole lot 
more expense, both to the American 
taxpayer, and, I believe, this is going 
to push up the cost of health insurance 
on families that are already having dif-
ficulties making those health insur-
ance payments. All of that is correct. 
And the chairman of the committee— 
also his heart is in the right place— 
mentioned 
ectodermal 
dysplasia. 
I 
have no problem with us treating that. 
It affects a small number of people. It 
is a huge cost on a handful of families 
out there—maybe a few more than a 
handful—but it does affect people dis-
proportionately who cannot afford to 
have that fixed, and it does create huge 
problems on eating, on talking, et 
cetera. Those are the things we want to 
go after. 
What I want to make sure we are not 
doing is spending billions of dollars of 
American taxpayer dollars or raising 
the cost of health insurance because we 
are going to take care of everything 
down to two index finger fingernails 
missing, et cetera. That is my concern. 
Madam Speaker, as you can tell, I 
feel passionately about this, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
I thank the gentleman for his kind 
comments about me. I think that there 
are a couple of important points to be 
made. And that is that CBO estimates 
that insurers will respond to this bill 
by raising premiums by less than 0.1 
percent. What CBO does not score are 
the savings from providing this needed 
medical care because that medical care 
goes on and on and on. And the costs to 
families are exorbitant. 
As I said earlier today, I think this is 
a very good bill. I acknowledge all the 
advocates from all over the country 
that worked so hard to bring us to this 
moment. 
Madam Speaker, I look forward to 
the vote today on this bill that has 
been with us since 2020, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of H.R. 1916, the Ensuring 
Lasting Smiles Act. 
The purpose of this bill is to provide health 
insurance benefits for outpatient and inpatient 
items and services related to the diagnosis 
and treatment of congenital anomalies and 
birth defects. 
This bill requires private health insurance 
plans to cover the diagnosis and treatment of 
birth defects, congenital disorders, or con-
genital malformations, conditions developed 
prenatally and may be identified before or at 
birth, or later in life. 
The coverage must include services and 
items that functionally improve, repair, or re-
store any body part that is medically nec-
essary for normal bodily functions or appear-
ance, as determined by the treating physician. 
This bill protects patients against increased 
insurance premiums by clearly specifying that 
coverage for these treatments may be sub-
jected only to the same limits that apply to 
other injuries or sicknesses without imposing 
any greater financial responsibilities on the pa-
tient or family. 
This legislation would also close an insur-
ance coverage loophole for people born with 
congenital anomalies who need complex oral 
restorative care. 
It would ensure that health plans cover 
medically necessary services related to a pa-
tient’s anomaly or birth defect, including any 
serious dental and oral-related procedures that 
are necessary to maintaining health and over-
all function. 
Insurance companies usually cover the pre-
liminary procedures to treat congenital anoma-
lies, but often deny and delay follow-up recon-
structive procedures. 
Denial or delay of these reconstructive pro-
cedures could lead to long-term physical and 
psychological injuries. 
Insurance companies claim these follow up 
procedures are only cosmetic in nature, which 
then places a significant burden on patients 
and their families. 
It is relatively rare for a child with a con-
genital deformity or developmental anomaly to 
undergo just one procedure that corrects all 
the associated health implications the first 
time. 
On average, these children can expect any-
where from three to five surgical procedures 
and many more treatments before achieving 
structural normalcy and function in the af-
fected body parts. 
These families are then forced to pay huge 
out-of-pocket costs for treatment coverage or, 
in worst case scenarios, terminate treatment. 
For example, people born with ectodermal 
dysplasia’s are often unable to properly de-
velop teeth. 
Their teeth may be missing, completely ab-
sent, have defective enamel or be shaped dif-
ferently. 
If the teeth are not repaired or replaced, 
these individuals could have chewing, swal-
lowing, digestive, speech and self-esteem 
issues. 
Someone born with ectodermal dysplasia 
spends a significant amount of money on nec-
essary medical and dental care throughout 
their lifetime. 
This amount of money can become so ex-
cessive that families may have no option other 
than selling their cars, remortgaging their 
homes, and foregoing a college education to 
afford medically necessary dental care. 
Far more families simply go without care be-
cause they can’t afford it. 
Dental care is also subject to a double- 
standard, while some individuals who lose 
their teeth due to an accident receive dental 
benefits under the existing statutes, those who 
are 
missing 
teeth 
due 
to 
ectodermal 
dysplasias, a medical condition they were born 
with, do not receive these same dental bene-
fits. 
The Ensuring Lasting Smiles Act would fix 
this. 
This bill would help more families than those 
affected by the ectodermal dysplasias. It 
would cover a broad range of congenital 
anomalies. 
Many people born with congenital anomalies 
suffer from severe oral defects such as: 
Cleft lip or palate 
Hypodontia 
Enamel hypoplasia 
Skeletal defects like craniosynostosis 
Vision defects like congenital cataracts or 
aphakia 
Hearing defects like microtia 
Other loss of bodily functions 
According to the Center for Disease Control 
and Prevention (CDC), one in 33 babies in the 
United States is born with a congenital anom-
aly. 
Of those 120,000 children born annually 
with birth defects, approximately 40,000 re-
quire reconstructive surgery. 
Medical professionals and surgeons are for-
tunately able to correct many of these prob-
lems, however some insurance companies 
deny access to care by labeling the proce-
dures as ‘‘cosmetic’’ or ‘‘non-functional’’ in na-
ture. 
Too many children born with congenital 
anomalies are denied coverage despite the 
long-term harm of such conditions. 
The Ensuring Lasting Smiles Act would ad-
dress delays and denials in coverage and 
guarantee that children suffering from birth de-
fects and anomalies get the treatment they 
need. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in voting for 
H.R. 1916 because this law guarantees the 
payment of health insurance benefits for nec-
essary medical care and treatment due to any 
congenital anomaly. 
These families deserve to see the day when 
they no longer have to fight for coverage of 
medically necessary treatments and their chil-
dren and loved ones receive the treatments 
they desperately need and deserve.

f 
MOMENT OF SILENCE IN REMEM-
BRANCE 
OF 
THE 
VICTIMS 
OF 
THE 
SACRAMENTO 
GUN 
VIO-
LENCE 
(Ms. MATSUI asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today heartbroken, full of pain and 
sadness for my district, my hometown 
of Sacramento. 
Very early yesterday morning, I got 
an alert that there was a mass shoot-
ing; and I wondered, ‘‘Now where?’’ 
Then I read the words: Sacramento. 
This terrible violence has come home 
to my home in Sacramento. 
Sacramento experienced the dead-
liest mass shooting in the city’s his-
tory. Six members of our community 
were killed and 12 were sent to local 
hospitals. 
Our Sacramento community is hurt-
ing. This tragedy has touched every 
single one of us, and I really deeply ap-
preciate the outpouring of support for 
the lives lost from all of you and across 
the Nation. 
Sacramento is truly a special place. 
We deeply care for each other; we work 
together; we are resilient; and we show 
compassion when our neighbors are in 
pain. Our entire community has come 
together in the wake of this tragedy to 
pray for the victims and their loved 
ones and to support the efforts of our 
community responders and law en-
forcement officers who are still hard at 
work. 
As Sacramentans, we are still in the 
early hours and first day of our grief. 
These were our neighbors, our friends, 
and our family members. While we will 
never be able to fill the space of a lost 
loved one, we can all reach out, em-
brace them, and make sure that the 
love they hold for those lost endures in 
us all. 
I want to name the ones we lost: 
Sergio Harris, 38 years old; 
Melinda Davis, 57 years old; 
Yamile Martinez-Andrade, 21 years 
old; 
Johntaya Alexander, 21 years old; 
Devazia Turner, 29 years old; and 
Joshua Hoye-Lucchesi, 32 years old. 
Right now we are bound in grief and 
love, but also in our resolve to do bet-
ter. We cannot go on accepting that 
shootings like this are inevitable. If we 
can prevent even one more tragedy like 
this, spare other families and commu-
nities from feeling this pain, then we 
have to come together and act. We can-
not and will not be passive in the face 
of such senseless violence. 
I now ask my colleagues and all 
Americans to join me in a moment of 
silence for the victims of this terrible 
tragedy, for their loved ones, for those 
still fighting to recover, and for our en-
tire Sacramento community. Let us to-
gether mourn and pray for them during 
this difficult time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
BERA). The Chair asks that all Mem-
bers in the Chamber, as well as Mem-
bers and staff throughout the Capitol, 
rise for a moment of silence in remem-
brance of the victims of the recent 
shooting in Sacramento, California. 
f 
ENSURING LASTING SMILES ACT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
NEGUSE). Pursuant to clause 8 of rule 
XX, the unfinished business is the vote

health 
insurance 
benefits

out-
patient and inpatient items and serv-
ices related to the diagnosis and treat-
ment of a congenital anomaly or birth 
defect, as amended, on which the yeas 
and nays were ordered. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill.

I would like to share the story of one 
of my constituents, Caleb Locke, a 
young man from Ashaway, Rhode Is-
land, who was born with ectodermal 
dysplasia. As a result of his condition, 
Caleb’s lower jaw is both thin and 
short with no ridge, and his posterior 
upper jaw lacks sufficient bone struc-
ture. 
Caleb is missing teeth, and he needs 
dental implants, but this process will 
require multiple surgeries, including 
bone grafts from his hip to reconstruct 
his jaw and sinuses. 
Unfortunately, 
and 
unbelievably, 
Caleb’s health insurance has deemed 
these procedures as ‘‘cosmetic’’ and has 
consequently denied coverage. 
Madam Speaker, Caleb needs these 
surgeries, and they are clearly not cos-
metic. It is wholly unacceptable that 
coverage 
can 
be 
denied 
on 
those 
grounds. 
Caleb, and anyone else with a con-
genital anomaly, should never be de-
nied coverage for medically necessary 
services related to their conditions. 
That is why I was proud to support 
the passage of H.R. 1916 this evening, 
and I urge our colleagues in the Senate 
to promptly do the same.

REDUCING POVERTY ACROSS THE 
NATION 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to an-
nounce we are one step closer to reduc-
ing poverty across the Nation. 
In March, the House Committee on 
Education and Labor passed H.R. 5129, 
the Community Services Block Grant 
Modernization Act, on a bipartisan 
vote. 
I was proud to introduce this bill 
with the gentlewoman from Oregon 
(Ms. BONAMICI). The bill would fund the 
community action agencies that help 
address the root causes of poverty in 
our communities. 
These agencies are largely comprised 
of business and industry leaders. They 
provide a safety net for low-income 
families and individuals, but even more 
importantly, they help create opportu-
nities for people to move from poverty 
to independence. 
Despite the good these agencies do 
for our communities, the Community 
Services Block Grant program has not 
been reauthorized for 25 years. My bill 
will modernize CSBG to provide agen-
cies the ability to tap their full poten-
tial. 
Madam Speaker, this program has a 
long history of bipartisan support due 
to the great work it enables. It is my 
hope that this righteous bill is brought 
to the floor in a timely manner. 
It is time for Congress to renew our 
Nation’s commitment and further re-
duce poverty by reauthorizing CSBG.

STANDING FOR JUDGE KETANJI 
BROWN JACKSON 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
today, I sat in the Senate Judiciary 
Committee as a historic vote was 
taken. 
Since the appointment of Sandra Day 
O’Connor, only four women have as-
cended to the United States Supreme 
Court. 
In particular, longer than any other 
demographic group, African-American 
women have been subjected to coercive 
laws, yet they have been excluded from 
the political and judicial positions to 
impact those laws. 
I am glad that President Biden saw 
fit to nominate one of the most—and 
probably 
the 
most—qualified 
judge 
ever to be nominated to the United 
States Supreme Court—not my words; 
the words of many others. 
So this day that Dr. King died, we 
know that the dreamer may have been 
killed, but the dream still lives. 
They voted today. Eleven Democrats 
voted yes. Unfortunately, 11 Repub-
licans voted no. 
I hope, as this goes to the floor, we 
will stand as Americans, and Demo-
crats and Republicans will ascend to 
the United States Supreme Court this 
African-American woman, more quali-
fied than ever, again, to take a rightful 
place on the United States Supreme 
Court. I pray that that will happen.

REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF 
LIEUTENANT WILLIAM LEBO 
(Mr. MEUSER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of Lieutenant 
William Lebo of the Lebanon City, 
Pennsylvania, 
Police 
Department. 
Lieutenant Lebo was shot and killed in 
the line of duty last week. 
Lieutenant Lebo was a dedicated, 40- 
year veteran of the Lebanon City Po-
lice Department and planned to retire 
on May 1 of this year. 
Lieutenant Lebo and two other offi-
cers, 
Ryan 
Adams 
and 
Derek 
Underkoffler, were responding to a do-
mestic disturbance last Thursday when 
the offender immediately opened fire 
on them. All three officers were shot, 
and tragically, Lieutenant Lebo was fa-
tally wounded. 
Lieutenant Lebo has been remem-
bered by his colleagues and those he 
served as a calm, kind, and ethical po-
lice officer who was deeply devoted to 
protecting the Lebanon community. 
This tragedy serves as a devastating 
reminder that every day law enforce-
ment officers put on their uniforms and 
go to work, as my father did, to protect 
and serve, always knowing full well 
that they may not return home. 
Today and always, we owe our con-
tinued support to our police officers 
and their families in Pennsylvania and 
across America. 
We all send our deepest condolences 
to Lieutenant Lebo’s wife, Lora; his 
daughter, Corrine; and his entire fam-
ily, as well as the Lebanon City Police

ADDRESSING THE DIABETES 
CRISIS 
(Mrs. 
CHERFILUS-MCCORMICK 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. 
CHERFILUS-MCCORMICK. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to address the 
diabetes crisis in the United States and 
its effects on our Nation’s children. 
In 2018, about 210,000 of children and 
adolescents under the age of 20 were di-
agnosed with diabetes. As the numbers 
regarding childhood diabetes climb, 
more families are struggling to provide 
the medication their children need to 
survive. 
The pressure of dealing with such a 
life-threatening illness at a young age 
is extreme and can leave lasting im-
pacts on our youth, as their childhood 
is such a formative time. Statistics for 
their condition can seem bleak; dia-
betic children can expect a life expect-
ancy to be shortened by up to 20 years 
due to their condition. 
I thank my colleagues for passing the 
Affordable Insulin Now Act to address 
this issue in the United States. 
f 
THE CRISIS ON THE SOUTHERN 
BORDER CONTINUES TO WORSEN 
(Mr. ROSE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, the cri-
sis on our southern border continues to 
worsen with each passing day. 
Just last month, Customs and Border 
Protection released their latest figures 
that showed immigrant encounters at 
the southern border have increased 61 
percent over the last year to 164,973. 
That is more than double the popu-
lation of Cookeville, Crossville, and 
Lebanon, Tennessee, combined. 
President Biden and his administra-
tion have caused this crisis and should 
be held responsible. On his first day in 
office, he halted construction on the 
southern border wall. A month later he 
signed multiple executive orders re-
scinding President Trump’s immigra-
tion policies. In June of last year, he 
ended the remain in Mexico policy. 
Now, the Biden administration has an-
nounced they are ending the Title 42 
policy that allows for quick expulsion 
of illegal immigrants. 
Rescinding Title 42 will encourage 
another surge of illegal immigrants at 
our southern border and put even more 
strain on Customs and Border Protec-
tion having trouble keeping up already 
with the record levels of illegal immi-
grant encounters. 
f 
LAW 
ENFORCEMENT 
NEED 
THE 
TOOLS 
TO 
DETECT 
IMPAIRED 
DRIVERS 
(Mr. GOTTHEIMER asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to highlight the crucial in-
vestment my bipartisan amendment to 
the MORE Act will make to support 
local law enforcement and to protect 
our children, families, and commu-
nities. 
My provision, which passed with a 
strong bipartisan majority, will invest 
$10 million for the National Highway 
Traffic Safety Administration to study 
technologies and methods that law en-
forcement 
may 
use 
to 
determine 
whether a driver is impaired by mari-
juana in their system. 
We know that marijuana signifi-
cantly impairs judgment, motor co-
ordination, and reaction time. Studies 
have found a direct relationship be-
tween blood THC concentration and 
impaired driving ability. In fact, driv-
ers under the influence of marijuana 
regularly cause traffic collisions. 
We must give our law enforcement 
officers the tools to detect impaired 
drivers and get them off the road—and 
to always have their backs. 
Safety is always my top priority, and 
I am proud to lead efforts that invest 
in our law enforcement and protect our 
families. 
I strongly urge my colleagues in the 
Senate to pass my critically important 
provision, to ensure that law enforce-
ment has the tools necessary to keep 
roads safe for our families. 
This investment is crucial to pro-
tecting our families from the dangers 
of impaired driving. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE AND 
MEMORY OF DANNY BURGESS 
(Mr. COMER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and memory of 
my good friend Danny ‘‘Flapper’’ Bur-
gess from my home area of Monroe 
County, Kentucky. 
Flapper was a larger-than-life figure. 
If you ever met Flapper Burgess, you 
left with a positive and memorable im-
pression. He was an effective, old- 
school, local politician, who owned a 
little country store called Flapper’s 
Market in Fountain Run, Kentucky. If 
you were a candidate for local office 
and wanted to carry the Fountain Run 
precinct, you had to have Flapper’s 
support. 
Here is the last picture I have of 
Flapper and I in his store eating one of 
his signature baloney sandwiches. 
Flapper served many years on the 
Monroe 
County 
Fiscal 
Court 
rep-
resenting the Gamaliel, White Oak 
Ridge, and Fountain Run precincts. 
Flapper truly was a man of the people. 
On behalf of the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives and all the people of south 
central Kentucky, I extend my deepest 
sympathies to the family of Danny 
‘‘Flapper’’ Burgess. 
THE FREE WORLD MUST 
IMMEDIATELY RISE UP TOGETHER 
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, the 
unspeakable carnage Vladimir Putin 
and his war machine are unleashing 
across Ukraine is barbaric. 
The images from Bucha are almost 
too 
horrific 
to 
comprehend. 
Men, 
women, children, and the elderly are 
bound and thrown on the streets as if 
they were garbage. The world is deal-
ing with a tyrant who counts victory 
with body bags. 
Every nation must arm Ukraine with 
the weaponry and defenses it needs. 
Every nation must end their imports of 
Russian coal, oil, and gas. Every nation 
must twist the screws of sanctions 
tighter and tighter until Putin and his 
enablers choke. 
The hundreds of thousands of Amer-
ican and Allied servicemembers who 
gave their lives across European na-
tions in the 20th century did not do so 
only for the cause of liberty to go 
unaided in the modern era. 
The free world must immediately rise 
up together. Fend off evil. End the 
bloodshed. Lead Ukraine to restore its 
liberty.

REMOVAL OF NAME OF MEMBER 
AS COSPONSOR OF H.R. 3807

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-

f 
AMERICANS NEED TO WAKE UP 
(Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, 
America has to realize we are on the 
precipice of making one of the most 
significant 
precedential 
determina-
tions in recent memory, and that is the 
removal of Title 42 affecting American 
immigration law. 
Already we are allowing—depending 
on the month—between 80,000 and 
100,000 people to cross our border who 
are not appropriately vetted. 
However, due to a title put in effect 
by President Trump, we are keeping 
another 
perhaps 
400,000 
people 
a 
month—we are told 18,000 a day—south 
of the border out of concern that they 
will bring the virus in this country. 
If this title is removed, we will go— 
according 
to 
current 
estimates—to 
18,000 people a day: a half a million 
people a month coming in this country. 
That is an intolerable amount. They 
are people we cannot support. They are 
people who have not been appropriately 
vetted. And, obviously, there will be a 
massive increase in illegal drugs cross-
ing our southern border. 
I beg the American public to wake up 
and do what you can to make it clear

INSULIN IS TOO EXPENSIVE 
(Ms. BROWN of Ohio asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. BROWN of Ohio. Madam Speak-
er, put simply: insulin is too expensive 
for millions of Americans. 
Here are the facts: From 2014 to 2019, 
the average retail price of insulin rose 
by 54 percent. And in America, people 
pay more than 10 times the price of in-
sulin compared to other countries. 
What is the result of these high 
prices? Around one in four Americans 
who rely on insulin have cut back or 
skipped doses due to costs. 
No person should have to choose be-
tween paying rent or buying the insu-
lin they need to survive. And no person 
should be forced to skip or ration 
doses. 
Last week, the House passed the Af-
fordable Insulin Now Act to cap the 
cost of insulin at $35 per month. Insu-
lin is a lifesaving drug, but it must 
never be a wallet-wrecking drug. 
We must continue to work to lower 
costs for families everywhere from the 
pharmacy counter to the gas pump.

RECOGNIZING THE ANNIVERSARY 
OF THE DEATH OF MARTIN LU-
THER KING, JR. 
(Mr. COHEN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, 54 
years ago tonight one of the great trag-
edies in our Nation’s history occurred 
in my hometown of Memphis, Ten-
nessee. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was 
assassinated. 
In Memphis, there is great love for 
Dr. King and his dream. He had given 
the ‘‘I’ve Been to the Mountaintop’’ 
speech the night before in Memphis. 
And tonight, at this hour there is a me-
morial service at the National Civil 
Rights Museum, which was constructed 
at the Lorraine Motel where he was 
staying and where he was slain. 
In Memphis, a phoenix has risen from 
the ashes. The National Civil Rights 
Museum celebrates Dr. King’s life and 
all the pioneers that preceded him and 
were after him in fighting for civil 
rights and civil justice in this Nation. 
I share with all in mourning the 
death of Dr. King 54 years ago but take 
great pride in Memphis having the Na-
tional Civil Rights Museum and en-
courage people to visit.

HONORING LAW ENFORCEMENT 
OFFICERS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Wash-
ington (Mr. NEWHOUSE) is recognized 
for 60 minutes as the designee of the 
minority leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on the topic of my Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Washington? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, 
today I rise in honor of the brave men 
and women in blue who serve and pro-
tect us each and every day. I am proud 
to be able to be part of this Special 
Order remembering Washington State 
law enforcement, and I am proud to 
share this Special Order with most all 
of the delegation of the great State of 
Washington. 
According to statistics released by 
the FBI, intentional killings of law en-
forcement in the year 2021 were the 
highest in 20 years. Already this year— 
and we are only in April—there have 
been more officers shot and killed than 
all of last year. 
Every day, police officers across cen-
tral Washington, across my State, and 
across the United States put on a 
badge and go to work knowing they 
face extremely dangerous situations 
exacerbated by significant economic 
uncertainties, open border policies, and 
the raging opioid crisis. 
Let me be clear: Nothing justifies the 
targeting and the murdering of law en-
forcement. Whether on regularly sched-
uled patrol duty or answering an ur-
gent call for help, law enforcement of-
ficers put on their uniforms every day 
with no guarantee they will return 
home safely. 
Just 3 weeks ago, Madam Speaker, 
Pierce 
County 
Sheriff’s 
Deputy 
Dominique ‘‘Dom’’ Calata, a 35-year- 
old Army veteran, who had been with 
the force for the past 61⁄2 years, made 
the ultimate sacrifice while protecting 
his community. While assisting the 
South Sound Gang Task Force and 
serving a warrant for second degree as-
sault, Deputy Calata was shot and 
killed. The deputy leaves behind his 
wife and a 4-year-old son. 
Tragically, during his memorial serv-
ice 2 weeks ago, Everett police officer 
Dan Rocha was killed during a run-in 
with a suspect who shot and killed him 
before running over his body while flee-
ing the scene. His memorial service 
took place just this afternoon. Officer 
Rocha leaves behind his wife, as well as 
two children. 
Madam Speaker, I would ask for a 
moment of silence for both of these 
brave officers. 
b 1945 
We all owe a debt of gratitude to 
these individuals who risk their lives 
to enforce the law and to protect our 
communities. 
Law enforcement officers take time 
away from their families, their loved 
ones, often without the thanks that 
they deserve, and often, putting them-
selves in harm’s way. Our men and 
women in law enforcement deserve 
nothing less than our full support. 
I am deeply concerned, frankly, with 
the anti-police policies that our State 
has implemented and continues to con-
sider. While there may have been posi-
tive steps taken to roll back this legis-
lation this past session, there is still 
much progress to be made, both in 
Washington, and at the Federal level. 
We have to fully fund our police de-
partments. We have to provide them 
with the necessary resources to do 
their important jobs. 
Over the past several years, I have 
had many opportunities to meet with 
police officers, with sheriffs, first re-
sponders, all across Central Wash-
ington in my district. I participated in 
ride-alongs with officers, from Pasco 
and from Sunnyside to see firsthand 
how they interact with their neighbors 
and local businesses. 
And I regularly meet with law en-
forcement officers in each of our coun-
ties to learn how I can help them in 
Congress to make their policing efforts 
much more effective. 
I am constantly in awe of the great 
work that these officers are doing to 
engage with families that are in need, 
or at-risk children, as well as students, 
and individuals who may be in danger. 
They do all of this with the goal of 
making our Central Washington com-
munities a better, safer place to live 
and work; and for that I am truly 
grateful. 
Police officers around the country 
are dedicated to protecting us and de-
fending the liberties that we hold dear. 
Law enforcement officers selflessly put 
themselves in harm’s way to protect 
Americans, preserve the peace, and 
maintain law and order. They are truly 
heroes in blue, and we owe them our re-
spect and our support. 
Today, I remember Deputy Calata 
and Officer Rocha, and offer my sincere 
condolences to their family, their 
friends, and the departments that they 
left behind all too soon. 
I commit to continuing to fight for 
the men and women in law enforce-
ment and their families who sacrifice 
so much to keep our communities safe. 
Today, as well as every day, we offer 
our appreciation and our respect for 
law enforcement officers across this 
great Nation. 
Madam Speaker, as I said, I am hon-
ored and delighted that we have many 
members of the Washington State dele-
gation to share in this Special Order 
this evening, to share their thoughts 
and their observations about what is 
going on, not only in our State, but 
States across the country. 
I first want to turn to my neigh-
boring district, to my east and thank 
her for being part of this Special Order. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Spokane, Washington, 
(Mrs. RODGERS).

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4149 
April 4, 2022 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman for bringing us together this 
evening to honor some of the finest 
that serve our communities to protect 
our communities day in and day out. 
And today, I rise with a broken heart 
to honor two of Washington State’s fin-
est: Pierce County Sheriff’s Deputy 
Dom Calata, and Everett Police Officer 
Dan Rocha, both tragically shot and 
killed in the line of duty, protecting 
and serving the communities that they 
called home. 
For years, these 2 men, like so many 
others, put on the uniform each day, 
hugged their kids and kissed their 
wives and went to work to keep us safe; 
not knowing if they would ever walk 
back through the door at the end of the 
night. 
Deputy Calata and Officer Rocha 
made the ultimate sacrifice and my 
heart breaks for their grieving families 
and the families of the other 685 offi-
cers killed in the line of duty since 
2021. 
Madam Speaker, we must do better. 
This is the United States of America 
and we cannot allow these assaults on 
our law enforcement to continue. We 
must fund the police and give them the 
resources they need to keep us safe, 
and make sure they make it home safe 
at the end of the day. 
All around our communities, we see a 
surge of violent crime. We see heart-
breaking drug abuse, violence in our 
schools, homelessness; and law enforce-
ment is fighting an uphill battle, and 
they are on the front lines day in and 
day out. They need our support. Now, 
more than ever, we need them to do 
their jobs to address all of these issues. 
The anti-police rhetoric only makes 
things worse, and it has infected too 
many hearts and minds. These individ-
uals are our heroes. 
Dom Calata was a hero. Dan Rocha 
was a hero. Each and every selfless 
man and woman in blue who gave their 
last breath in service to our commu-
nity was a hero. And today, their fami-
lies are without them. We must never 
forget their sacrifice and always back 
the blue. 
I am encouraged tonight so many of 
my colleagues are joining together as 
Americans to recognize the fallen, and 
to remember them for who they are, 
heroes. 
My heart goes out to those who are 
grieving this tragic loss, and I pray 
that God keeps watch over all those 
still serving. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for her re-
marks; heroes, I couldn’t say it better. 
Now I yield to the gentlewoman from 
the west side of my district in Wash-
ington (Ms. HERRERA
BEUTLER), my 
good colleague and friend. 
Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Madam 
Speaker, it is a privilege to get to be 
here sharing this Special Hour with my 
colleagues. I wish it was about some-
thing else, quite frankly. 
I am very, very honored to get to 
stand here and share the names of 
some of these officers to whom we owe 
an unimaginable debt of gratitude. So 
it is a privilege to join the gentleman 
as we honor the officers who have laid 
down their lives for our safety, for our 
security, for our families, for our 
homes, for our businesses, for our com-
munities. 
And to the families and the col-
leagues of our fallen heroes, I know 
words will never be enough. But please, 
please know that we stand alongside 
you in your grief, and we pledge to al-
ways remember their names and to 
honor their service and their sacrifice. 
In just the past couple of weeks, we 
have tragically lost two brave Wash-
ington State police officers: Pierce 
County 
Sheriff’s 
Deputy 
Dominic 
‘‘Dom’’ Calata, and Everett Police De-
partment Officer Dan Rocha. My heart 
breaks for the families and the col-
leagues of these brave officers as they 
grapple with this devastating loss. 
And I have had the privilege, in this 
body, of representing my hometown in 
Congress, 
Southwest 
Washington 
State, which boasts some amazing and 
outstanding police forces and officers, 
many of whom I have come to know 
over the last several years. 
Sadly, we too have had multiple offi-
cers lost in the line of duty in the last 
few years. And I want to take this mo-
ment to recognize and honor those offi-
cers here today. I am just going to read 
their names.

are going to go from here across.

And then Clark County Sheriff’s Ser-
geant Jeremy Brown. His end of watch

And again, to the families and to the 
colleagues of these officers, my heart 
breaks for you, and we are so proud of 
these officers and what they have 
given. We pledge to you to always re-
member their bravery and their sac-
rifice and to honor their memory by 
standing up for and supporting the law 
enforcement that support our commu-
nities. 
I want to take a moment to say to 
our men and women in blue, we stand 
in solidarity with you; and I will al-
ways, always, always, support your ef-
forts to keep our communities safe. 
I recognize it is no easy feat to get up 
every morning, put on your uniform, 
kiss your loved ones goodbye and not 
know the dangers that could lie ahead, 
just in that day. I know this because 
you have told me how disheartening it 
is when people call to abolish or to 
defund law enforcement, or when poli-
ticians who have no clue what it is like 
to walk in your shoes, pass laws that 
make it more difficult for you to do 
your job, which is to protect us, our 
families, and our communities. 
But because of your bravery and 
commitment to public safety, we are 
able to safely live our lives. It is an 
amazing gift that you give us and, for 
that, I humbly thank you. 
We are forever grateful for your will-
ingness to serve and protect our com-
munities, and I look forward to hearing 
the comments from some of my other 
colleagues tonight as we honor your 
sacrifice and remember your service. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate the gentlewoman’s com-
ments. I thank her for adding to the 
list. The list is far too long for us to 
list everyone, unfortunately. And it is 
like the gentlewoman said: I wish we 
were here for a happier occasion, but 
this is an important one and I thank 
the gentlewoman for her contributions. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from the Eighth Congres-
sional District of Washington (Ms. 
SCHRIER), another neighbor. I am sur-
rounded with good Members of Con-
gress. I believe she lives in the town of 
Sammamish. 
Ms. SCHRIER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Representative NEWHOUSE, my 
friend, for gathering us together here 
to honor law enforcement and to 
mourn several recently fallen police of-
ficers. 
Whenever a police officers is killed in 
the line of duty it is a tragedy, for the 
officer, for the family, and for the en-
tire community. Even one such death 
is too many. And in the last several 
weeks in Washington State, there have 
been several, and we have mourned to-
gether. 
As I speak, the funeral is underway 
for Officer Dan Rocha, killed in the 
line of duty in Everett on March 25. 
Just 2 weeks ago, I attended the fu-
neral for Pierce County Sheriff’s Dep-
uty Dom Calata, who leaves behind his 
wife, Erin, his darling preschooler, 
Dylan, family, and friends. 
Dom’s friend and partner in duty, Of-
ficer Rich Scaniffe, spoke at the fu-
neral. And he was critically injured at 
the same time but, thankfully, sur-
vived and will make a full recovery. 
Back in 2019, when I was first sworn 
into office, Kittitas County Deputy 
Sheriff Ryan Thompson was also killed 
while serving his community. 
Every day, police officers put them-
selves in danger to keep our commu-
nities safe, and every day, they and 
their families face the risk that they 
might not make it home to their loved 
ones. This is why it has been such a 
priority of mine to meet with police of-
ficers and police chiefs to thank them 
for their work and to learn how I can 
help support them and keep them and 
their communities safe. 
I have heard from many of my con-
stituents about rising crime rates in 
our district, including these hostilities 
toward police officers. Everyone, ev-
eryone deserves to feel safe in their 
communities. That is why I voted to 
increase funding for local law enforce-
ment a few weeks ago, and why I will 
continue to push for funding to make

sure law enforcement have the tools 
they need to protect themselves and 
our communities. 
I am deeply grateful to police officers 
for their service. I understand the wor-
ries that their families face daily, and 
mourn together with families and com-
munities for those who have been 
killed in the line of duty. 
May their memories be a blessing. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate the gentlewoman’s remarks 
for a very special occasion here. 
I yield to the gentlewoman from Me-
dina, Washington, (Ms. DELBENE), my 
friend. We used to work together in 
Olympia, serving as cabinet members 
together. 
Ms. DELBENE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for pulling every-
one together. 
Earlier today, family, friends, col-
leagues, loved ones, and the commu-
nity of Snohomish County gathered to 
honor the life and sacrifice of Everett 
Police Officer Dan Rocha. 
Officer Rocha was fatally shot while 
protecting and serving our community. 
He is survived by his wife and his two 
sons. Our hearts are with his family 
and his loved ones. 
Officer Rocha served with the depart-
ment since 2017, and lived in the com-
munity for more than a decade. He 
worked his way up the ranks after 
starting in parking enforcement, before 
becoming a fully commissioned officer 
with the department. 
Police officers and first responders 
put their lives on the line every day to 
keep our communities safe and, sadly, 
our State has lost far too many offi-
cers. 
b 2000 
There is more we must do to support 
police and first responders across the 
country. We often ask police to do too 
much for our communities when other 
proven alternatives exist. 
We need to invest in mental health 
services so those suffering behavioral 
issues get the appropriate care that 
they need. We need to invest in gun vi-
olence prevention to limit risk to offi-
cers and families. We need to invest in 
community-based 
policing 
to 
build 
trust between law enforcement and the 
communities that they serve. 
Congress has a role here, and I will 
continue to work with my colleagues 
to be part of the solution to protect 
those who put their lives on the line 
and the communities that they serve. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Ms. DELBENE
for those great 
words. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Washington (Mr. LARSEN), 
from the city of Everett, one of our 
longer-serving colleagues and a very 
well-respected Member of Congress. 
Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Madam 
Speaker, Everett, Washington, suffered 
a tragic loss 2 weeks ago. On Friday, 
March 25, Everett Police Officer Dan 
Rocha was killed in the line of duty 
while responding to a call near Everett 
Community College. 
Today, the city of Everett celebrated 
Officer Rocha’s life at a memorial serv-
ice attended by many family members, 
his friends, law enforcement, other 
first responders, and, of course, com-
munity members. 
My thoughts and prayers are with 
the Rocha family during this very dif-
ficult time, Dan’s wife, Kelli; his two 
sons, Thomas and Harrison; and his 
very large extended family. 
As a citizen of Everett, I myself have 
called upon the Everett Police Depart-
ment a few times in my neighborhood 
for help, for assistance, and just for 
presence. They have always responded 
without question. 
Officer Rocha made an incredible im-
pact in a short time at the Everett PD, 
serving as an officer for the last 4 
years. Two years ago, he landed his 
dream assignment as a day-shift patrol 
officer in north Everett. On the day he 
passed, Officer Rocha was doing the job 
he loved, serving and protecting the 
community. 
Sadly, the Everett PD has experi-
enced tragedy before. In 1999, Officer 
Brian DiBucci was killed while pur-
suing a suspect near the U.S. 2 trestle. 
Law enforcement officers like Offi-
cers Rocha and DiBucci have dedicated 
their careers to keeping northwest 
Washington communities and residents 
safe. 
I know that the women and men of 
the Everett Police Department will 
continue to go out into the community 
every day and carry on Officer Rocha’s 
legacy by upholding that department’s 
commitment to service, integrity, pro-
fessionalism, and honor. 
Today, I stand with my hometown of 
Everett to honor Officer Rocha and his 
service to our community. 
I thank Representative NEWHOUSE for 
this opportunity to participate in the 
Special Order tonight. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Congressman LARSEN for person-
alizing this. This is your hometown, 
and this is real stuff. Like Ms. HER-
RERA BEUTLER said, I wish we were here 
for a more celebratory cause, but this 
is very important. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for his comments. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Washington 
(Ms. 
STRICKLAND), from the city of Tacoma, 
one of our newest colleagues in the 
House of Representatives. 
Ms. STRICKLAND. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentleman for yielding and 
for his leadership in holding this Spe-
cial Order on such an important issue. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to rec-
ognize our law enforcement officers 
across Washington State and to honor 
those killed in the line of duty. 
I want to personally thank our law 
enforcement officers who work tire-
lessly to keep our community safe de-
spite staffing shortages and, increas-
ingly too often, at the expense of their 
own safety. 
We live in challenging times. We are 
coming out of a pandemic. Our social 
safety net has been frayed. People are 
anxious. Mental and behavioral health 
issues are prevalent. Gun violence is on 
the rise. 
As my colleagues and I gather here 
to thank and acknowledge the con-
tributions of law enforcement across 
our State, I also stand here in honor of 
those officers and deputies injured and 
killed in recent weeks in the South 
Puget Sound. 
For those not familiar with our com-
munity, it is a special place, a tight- 
knit community of veterans, seniors, 
military families, educators, and, yes, 
law 
enforcement 
professionals 
who 
come together to serve and help each 
other every single day. 
The past 3 weeks have been rough in 
our community. We lost one officer and 
have had at least three more officers 
and deputies injured. Just this past 
Thursday evening, two Olympia police 
officers were stabbed after pursuing a 
suspect. Thankfully, both are recov-
ering and will be okay. 
Nearly 3 weeks ago, in Spanaway, our 
community was shaken as our Pierce 
County Sheriff’s Department officers 
put their lives on the line in service. 
Sergeant Rich Scaniffe was seriously 
injured and survived the incident, but 
tragically, we lost a young hero who 
served alongside him, Pierce County 
Sheriff’s Deputy Dom Calata, whose 
photo you see over there. 
Deputy Calata’s heroism and his 
commitment to protect his community 
will 
always 
be 
remembered. 
Our 
thoughts are with his family and loved 
ones during this difficult time. I am 
grateful for their service and hope we 
can all stop for a moment to reflect on 
their sacrifices to serve our State. 
I hope all of us in this House will 
take a moment to remember Deputy 
Calata and our fallen law enforcement 
officers in Washington State. 
Before I close, I want to reiterate my 
support for and appreciation of law en-
forcement serving South Sound and the 
State of Washington, doing their part 
during these challenging times. From 
Mason County Sheriff’s Department to 
Lakewood Police Department, Tacoma 
Police Department, Olympia Police De-
partment, and Pierce County Sheriff’s 
Department, please know that we ap-
preciate your service. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Representa-
tive NEWHOUSE for calling this Special 
Order. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Ms. STRICKLAND for making this 
very special. Pierce County is a huge 
and important part of our State. Unfor-
tunately, one of the most recent trage-
dies was in Pierce County, and I thank 
the gentlewoman for being part of this 
Special Order and recognizing that. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Washington (Mr. KILMER), 
my final speaker today. He may be the 
last but certainly one of the best, and 
he is a good friend, who I served with 
in the State legislature, from Gig Har-
bor. 
Mr. KILMER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding, for

April 4, 2022 
organizing this Special Order, and for 
his extraordinary leadership. 
Madam Speaker, I join him in rising 
today in support of Washington State’s 
law enforcement community. 
Each and every day, law enforcement 
officers in every corner of the district I 
have the honor of representing—and 
the communities all around our State 
and all around our country—go to work 
with one goal in mind: to serve and to 
protect. That includes officers like 
Pierce County Sheriff Deputy Dom 
Calata, who tragically gave his life 
serving his community last month. 
Deputy Calata admirably served his 
country and our community. I had the 
honor of attending his celebration of 
life in Tacoma. It was clear from the 
hundreds of emergency vehicles and 
the thousands of Washingtonians who 
showed up, first, that he was just a 
really good person; second, that our 
communities value the work of our law 
enforcement officers. 
Hearing the stories about how he 
supported other people, how he encour-
aged others, how he brought smiles to 
people’s faces, how he had just a zeal 
for service, it was a reminder of the 
best of us. 
Our communities enjoy safety and se-
curity because of the commitment of 
our law enforcement officers and our 
first responders. That is a commitment 
that we should return as we continue 
to support and ensure the safety of 
those who have dedicated their lives to 
serve and protect. 
The Federal Government has to have 
their backs. That certainly means 
what we are doing here, offering our 
words of support. It means our prayers. 
It means our gratitude. But it has to 
mean more than that. 
Having their backs means making 
sure they have the tools and the train-
ing that they need to keep us safe and 
to strengthen the bonds of trust with 
the communities in which they serve. 
Having their backs means giving 
communities the resources they need 
to hire and train new officers. It means 
that when we had a pandemic that led 
to the cratering of local government 
revenues, Congress passed the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan because none of us 
wanted to see cities, counties, and 
Tribes issue a bunch of pink slips to 
law enforcement officers. 
Having their backs means funding for 
the COPS Hiring Program and funding 
for effective, accountable community 
policing and programs that build trust, 
save lives, and reduce crime. 
Having their backs means dealing 
with some of the underlying problems 
that make their lives more difficult. I 
can’t tell you how many law enforce-
ment officers I have spoken to in re-
cent years who have bemoaned the fact 
that the largest provider of mental 
health services in nearly every county 
I represent is the county jail. 
If we can address the challenges 
posed by mental health, posed by ad-
diction, we can help better people’s 
lives, but we can also help our law en-
forcement officers by getting at some 
of the root causes of crime in our com-
munities. 
Our Nation asks a lot of our first re-
sponders. In return, we have to keep 
working to ensure Congress and the 
Federal Government do all they can to 
help these men and women do their 
jobs to ensure the safety of all Ameri-
cans and ensure their safety while they 
are doing those jobs. 
Former President Obama wrote a let-
ter to the law enforcement community 
following some tragic events nearly 6 
years ago. In it, he spoke of the impor-
tance of being united and not divided. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman for organizing this Special 
Order because you saw Democrats and 
Republicans united tonight in the im-
portance of celebrating and thanking 
our law enforcement officers. 
President Obama also spoke of ac-
knowledging that any violence against 
law enforcement officers is an unjusti-
fied attack on all of us as a commu-
nity. Perhaps, most importantly, he 
said thank you. He said, ‘‘Every day, 
you confront danger so it does not find 
our families, carry burdens so they do 
not fall to us, and courageously meet 
test after test to keep us safe. . . . We 
recognize it; we respect it; we appre-
ciate it; and we depend on you.’’ 
That is why tonight’s discussion 
matters, and it is why the work of 
every person in law enforcement mat-
ters. It is why I am grateful to my 
friend, Mr. NEWHOUSE, for organizing 
tonight’s discussion. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Mr. KILMER for his great words 
and for putting some specifics around 
what we can do to help the men and 
women in blue and green and brown 
keep our communities safe. 
Madam Speaker, the cost, as you 
know, of keeping our communities 
safe, keeping us safe, is great. The peo-
ple who pay the price of that cost are 
very dedicated, special people. It truly 
is a solemn honor for all of us to be 
able to pay tribute to, and to thank, 
the men and women who work every 
day to do just that, keep us safe. 
As Mr. KILMER just said, we should be 
committed to doing all we can to pro-
vide all they need for them to be able 
to do their jobs. 
Madam Speaker, I thank all of my 
colleagues from the State of Wash-
ington, and I thank the men and 
women who do their jobs without 
thinking twice, who are dedicated to 
protecting us, to keeping our families 
and communities safe. We owe them a 
great deal. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal God, our light and salvation, 
You have invited us in Psalm 50:15 to 
call You in the day of trouble, and so 
we are here. We thank You that prayer 
is a key to unlock the arsenal of Your 
power, mercy, and grace. Because of 
prayer, we remain confident that You 
are still in control of our troubled 
world. 
As we see a nightmare unfolding in 
Ukraine, we ask You to deliver the 
Ukrainian people from this season of 
despotism, 
desperation, 
destruction, 
and death. 
Lord, continue to use our Senators to 
accomplish Your purposes on Earth. 
We pray in Your majestic Name. 
Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under 
the previous order, the leadership time 
is reserved. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The

The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER

KING). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The majority leader is recognized. 
NOMINATION OF KETANJI BROWN JACKSON 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, this 
week, the U.S. Senate will commence 
the final stage—the final stage—of con-
firming Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson 
as the 116th Justice of the U.S. Su-
preme Court. 
It is a joyous and history-making 
moment for the Senate as 115 individ-
uals have come before this Chamber for 
consideration to the highest Court in 
the land, but none—none—were like 
Judge Jackson. Like many before her, 
she is brilliant; she is esteemed and 
highly accomplished, but never—never 
before—has the Supreme Court had a 
Black woman bear the title of ‘‘Jus-
tice,’’ and she will pave the way for 
others to follow in her example. 
Not long from now, the Senate Judi-
ciary Committee will conclude their 
markup of Judge Jackson’s nomination 
by voting to report her out of com-
mittee. Chairman DURBIN has adjusted 
the schedule to make sure all members 
are able to vote, but the process is 
moving forward. There is no question— 
no question—that Judge Jackson de-
serves a strong bipartisan vote in com-
mittee; but, sadly, despite the judge’s 
qualifications, the Republicans on the 
committee have made clear that not 
one of them will vote to report her out 
of committee. 
If the Judiciary Committee does 
reach a deadlocked vote later today, I 
will move as soon as I can to have the 
Senate hold a discharge vote so that 
her nomination can be considered by 
the full Senate. 
It is obvious, in listening to Repub-
licans, that their objections are en-
tirely unserious. Many who label Judge 
Jackson as ‘‘radical’’ and ‘‘far left’’ 
today conveniently ignore that she re-
ceived bipartisan support not once, not 
twice, but three times in this Chamber, 
including by voice vote. They also fail 
to mention that Judge Jackson com-
mands strong support from across the 
political spectrum, from conservative 
judges to the Nation’s largest police 
unions to a long list of former col-
leagues who say she is nothing short of 
the best of the best. 
Republicans in committee have ig-
nored, in other words, the plain facts of 
Judge Jackson’s record, and that is 
deeply disappointing. Judge Jackson is 
a brilliant and historic nominee, and 
her elevation as the first Black woman 
to the U.S. Supreme Court should bring 
the Senate together. 
Let’s be clear: Despite Republican op-
position, Judge Jackson has enough 
votes to get confirmed to the Supreme 
Court on a bipartisan basis. The Senate 
is going to keep working until she is 
confirmed. 
Once Judge Jackson is out of com-
mittee, I will file cloture on her nomi-
nation as quickly as possible and, in 
doing so, set in motion a process that 
will set up a final confirmation vote by 
the end of this week. I hope both sides 
can work together to advance her all- 
but-certain confirmation through the 
Senate without delay. 
Once again, I want to finish by com-
mending Judge Jackson for conducting 
herself brilliantly and unassailably 
during the entire confirmation process. 
It is not easy to be thrown suddenly 
and abruptly into the national spot-
light and have every detail of your life 
scrutinized. It is even harder to then

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1922 
April 4, 2022 
engage in marathon sitdowns with 
nearly every Senator in this body in 
just a few weeks, and it is nothing 
short of herculean to endure 3 days of 
lengthy and, at times, deeply unfair 
and mendacious questioning before the 
Judiciary Committee—with the eyes of 
the Nation upon you. 
But 6 weeks after her nomination 
was announced, Judge Jackson has 
proven that she is up to the task before 
her. She has shown that she merits the 
title of ‘‘Justice,’’ and from this mo-
ment on, the Senate will not stop 
working until we finish the work of 
confirming Judge Jackson to the U.S. 
Supreme Court. 
BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Now, Mr. President, on other Senate 
business, this week, the confirmation 
of Judge Jackson to the Supreme Court 
remains the highest Senate priority by 
far, but Senate Democrats will con-
tinue our work to lower costs for the 
American people. 
Last week—little noticed but quite 
important—the Senate passed bipar-
tisan ocean shipping reform, spear-
headed by Senators KLOBUCHAR
and 
THUNE and CANTWELL. This is very sig-
nificant and much-needed legislation 
that will reduce costs for the American 
people by unclogging our ports from 
Los Angeles to New York to Savannah 
to Seattle. These backlogs have caused 
not only great harm for American ex-
porters trying to send their products 
out in the world; it has also sky-
rocketed the price of goods coming 
into the country, and, ultimately, 
American consumers pay that price. I 
commend my colleagues for getting 
this important bill done. 
This week, the Senate is also close to 
entering a conference committee with 
the House to finalize our jobs and com-
petitiveness act; and tomorrow, Chair 
CANTWELL will turn the focus of the 
Commerce Committee to an urgent 
matter for the American people: ensur-
ing transparency in petroleum mar-
kets. 
We all know that big oil companies 
are dramatically expanding corporate 
stock buybacks and reporting record 
profits while Americans struggle with 
higher gas prices. Just today—this is 
so 
confounding, 
so 
upsetting— 
ExxonMobil indicated that its profits 
this quarter will be its highest since 
2008. And what are they going to do 
with this surplus cash? They an-
nounced, in the coming months, they 
will spend $10 billion on corporate 
stock 
buybacks. 
According 
to 
Bloomberg, oil and gas companies’ 
stock buybacks were up 2,000 percent in 
the fourth quarter of last year. Using 
that to enhance worker productivity? 
Nope. Using that to do something some 
people might object to, increasing ex-
ploration for oil and gas? Nope. Lining 
the pockets of their shareholders and 
their corporate executives in stock 
buybacks, 
which 
do 
nothing—abso-
lutely nothing—to advance the Amer-
ican economy or to deal with the oil 
prices. 
Maybe they should think instead of 
giving the money to shareholders, they 
should give money to their customers, 
give it back, by lowering the price. 
It is the latest reminder of a dis-
turbing trend with the oil and gas com-
panies. As the price of gas goes up and 
as Americans are struggling more and 
more to keep up, the Nation’s largest 
oil companies are up to their eyeballs 
in massive profits and then use that 
money 
for 
unproductive 
stock 
buybacks, which, if anything, increase 
income inequality at a time when the 
country needs to decrease it. 
There is something deeply incon-
gruous and wrong about seeing the 
largest oil companies and gas compa-
nies in the world drench top executives 
and wealthy shareholders in cash while 
Americans are struggling at the pump. 
I thank Chair CANTWELL for holding to-
morrow’s hearing so we can provide ac-
countability, transparency, and relief, 
hopefully, for the American people. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. President, finally, on COVID. 
Very briefly, over the last few days, my 
Democratic colleagues and I continue 
talks with Senator ROMNEY and Repub-
licans, working all hours of the night 
and into the weekend. I will have more 
to say on this matter shortly. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
LABOR MOVEMENT 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, let me 
begin by congratulating the workers at 
Amazon in Staten Island, NY, who, for 
the very first time, were able to win a 
union organizing campaign against 
that giant corporation, which is owned 
by Jeff Bezos, the second wealthiest 
person in America. 
Amazon spent over $4 million in try-
ing to defeat the union organizing 
drive in Staten Island and in Bessemer. 
The independent union, the Amazon 
Labor Union, had almost no money at 
all for their grassroots campaign but 
ended up with 55 percent of the vote. 
Congratulations, 
Amazon 
Labor 
Union, for your extraordinary and im-
portant victory. 
(Ms. 
DUCKWORTH 
assumed 
the 
Chair.) 
Madam President, I also want to con-
gratulate the workers at Starbucks for 
their incredible union organizing ef-
forts. 
Starbucks has coffee shops in some 
15,000 locations all across America, and 
until a few months ago, none of them 
were organized. Then, in December, 
workers in two shops in Buffalo, NY, 
voted to join a union, and that union 
organizing 
effort 
at 
Starbucks 
is 
spreading like wildfire all across the 
country. In fact, last Friday, workers 
in New York City successfully voted to 
form 
the 
first 
Starbucks 
union 
roastery and 10th union Starbucks cof-
fee shop in the country. And in the 
coming weeks and months, Starbucks 
workers in some 170 other coffee shops 
in 27 States will be holding union elec-
tions. 
What makes these union victories so 
impressive is that from start to finish, 
they were accomplished by a grassroots 
movement with very little financial re-
sources. 
Now, why is it important that we 
support these union organizing efforts 
at Starbucks and in other companies 
throughout the country? The answer is 
pretty simple. We live in a time of 
massive income and wealth inequality, 
where CEOs make 350 times more than 
the average worker, where two people— 
two people—own more wealth than the 
bottom 42 percent of Americans. 
We live in a time where the billion-
aire class is becoming much, much 
wealthier, while real weekly wages for 
American workers are $40 lower today 
than they were 49 years ago. In fact, we 
are seeing more income and wealth dis-
parity now than we have seen in 100 
years. And what we are witnessing is a 
massive, massive transfer of wealth 
from working families and the middle 
class to the top 1 percent—people on 
top doing phenomenally well, while 
millions and millions of working-class 
families are falling behind. And that 
has been going on for almost 50 years. 
According to the RAND Institute, 
since 1975, 50—5-0—trillion dollars in 
wealth has been redistributed from the 
bottom 90 percent to the top 1 percent. 
Now, I know we don’t talk about it too 
much in corporate media; we don’t talk 
about it too much on the floor of the 
Senate, but that is an astounding re-
ality, and that is a reality that we have 
got to address. It is not acceptable that 
since 1975, $50 trillion in wealth has 
been redistributed from the bottom 90 
percent to the top 1 percent. 
Listen to this, which really says it 
all. During this terrible pandemic, 
where we have lost almost a million 
American lives, when thousands of es-
sential workers died—people going to 
work and had no choice about it—dur-
ing that entire period, some 700 billion-
aires in America became nearly $2 tril-
lion richer. 
Today, multibillionaires like Elon 
Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Richard Branson 
are off taking joyrides on rocket ships 
to outer space, buying $500 million 
superyachts, and living in mansions 
with 25 bathrooms. That is what is 
going on with the people on top. But 
for working families, there is a contin-
uous struggle to pay the rent, to pro-
vide healthcare, and to make sure their 
kids are able to get a decent education. 
Let us be very clear. It is not just in-
come and wealth inequality that we 
are talking about; it is economic and 
political power—power—power. 
In America today, just three Wall 
Street 
firms—Black 
Rock, 
State 
Street, and Vanguard—control assets 
of over $21 trillion, which is essentially 
the GDP of the United States, the larg-
est economy on Earth. Can you imag-
ine that? 
Now, I know we don’t talk about it, 
but you have got three Wall Street 
firms that control assets equivalent to 
the GDP of the United States, the larg-
est economy on Earth. That is power.

S1923 
April 4, 2022 
And these firms have power over hun-
dreds and hundreds of corporations in 
every sector of our society and many 
millions of workers. 
So why do we want to see the trade 
union movement grow? Why do we 
want to see more and more workers en-
titled to negotiate decent contracts? 
The answer is pretty obvious, and it is 
because unions provide better wages, 
benefits, and working conditions for 
their members. That is what unions 
do—not complicated. 
In fact, union workers make, on aver-
age, wages that are about 20 percent 
higher than their nonunion counter-
parts. They also have much better 
healthcare benefits and far better pen-
sion plans than nonunion employees. 
That is why it makes sense to join a 
union and why it makes sense for us to 
do everything that we can to grow the 
trade union movement in this country. 
I know there are some folks out there 
who are not union members, and they 
are saying: Well, it doesn’t really im-
pact me. 
You are wrong. It does—because 
when unions gain better wages and bet-
ter benefits, it means that companies 
in the nonunion sector have got to 
begin to some degree to match them. 
So when wages go up for union work-
ers, they go up for all workers in this 
country. 
Further, unions give workers some 
degree of control over their work lives 
and make them more than just cogs in 
a machine. Today, millions and mil-
lions of people go to work, and they 
have no power whatsoever about what 
happens to them on the job. They can 
be fired arbitrarily. They can learn 
that they have to come to work the 
next day, when they thought they had 
that day off, and they have no say in 
any of that. So what unions do is end 
the ability of companies being able to 
arbitrarily fire workers for any reason 
and to impose any schedule that they 
want on their employees. In other 
words, unions give workers some de-
gree—some 
degree—of 
control 
over 
their work lives. 
Similarly, when large corporations 
have enormous political power through 
the many billions of dollars they spend 
on lobbying, on campaign contribu-
tions to both political parties, and on 
advertising, unions have the capa-
bility—because there are many mil-
lions and millions of people involved— 
to fight back and create a legislative 
agenda here in Washington and in 
State capitals that work for all Ameri-
cans and not just the few. 
What these recent union victories 
tell me is that working people all over 
this country are sick and tired of being 
exploited by corporations that, today, 
are making recordbreaking profits. 
They are sick and tired of billionaires 
like Jeff Bezos and Howard Schultz— 
the founder of Starbucks—becoming 
obscenely richer during the pandemic 
while they, the workers, put their lives 
on the line working for inadequate 
wages, inadequate benefits, and unfair 
working conditions and schedules. 
Let us be clear. If you think that the 
union victories—recent victories—at 
Amazon and Starbucks are an aberra-
tion, you would be sorely mistaken. 
During the last year, I have been proud 
to work with and stand in solidarity 
with courageous workers all across this 
country who have been on strike or 
who are engaged in union organizing 
efforts. I am talking about the United 
Auto Workers which went on strike at 
John Deere in Iowa, Illinois, and Kan-
sas to protest against massive cut-
backs to retirement benefits and to-
tally inadequate pay raises. I am talk-
ing about the United Steelworkers that 
went on strike at Special Metals in 
West Virginia—a company owned by 
Warren Buffett, worth $127 billion. 
They were on strike to fight for decent 
wages and decent benefits. 
I am talking about bakery workers 
who went on strike at Kellogg’s, Na-
bisco, and the Jon Donaire ice cream 
cake factory in California, fighting for 
justice, dignity, and respect. 
I am talking about the United Mine 
Workers who are still on strike at War-
rior Met in Alabama, a company owned 
by BlackRock, the largest Wall Street 
investment firm in this country, man-
aging $10 trillion in assets. 
I am talking about United Food and 
Commercial Workers who went on 
strike at the King Soopers grocery 
store chain owned by Kroger’s in Colo-
rado. 
I am talking about graduate students 
and adjunct professors at MIT who are 
waging a strong union organizing effort 
on that campus. 
Today, I want to continue to express 
my support and admiration for these 
workers who are not only organizing 
for themselves and for their coworkers 
but, in fact, are organizing for all of us, 
because when you have a strong union 
movement in this country, you stand 
the possibility of having a strong mid-
dle class. 
While we may not hear much talk 
about the struggles of the working 
class in communities all across this 
country, what we should be clear on is 
that these struggles are real and are 
gaining momentum. 
The union struggles that we are wit-
nessing have taken place against cor-
porate greed, which determine whether 
or not workers in our country have de-
cent wages, decent benefits, and decent 
working conditions. It really is, I have 
to say, a bit obscene to take a look at 
these companies, owned by some of the 
wealthiest people in this country, who 
are becoming much, much richer, and 
all the while, they are trying to lower 
wages and take back benefits. It really 
is absolutely disgraceful. 
So, Madam President, as a strong de-
fender of the trade union movement, 
what I understand is that when union-
ized workers do well in raising the bar 
for economic and social justice, we all 
do well. Their success is our shared 
success. And, as I said a moment ago, 
make no mistake about it, we will 
never have a strong middle class in this 
country, with decent wages and decent 
benefits, where workers can afford to 
pay the rent and send their kids to col-
lege and take a few weeks off with paid 
vacation—that is not going to happen 
unless and until we have a strong labor 
movement in this country. 
This is the bottom line: In the year 
2022, the United States and, in fact, the 
rest of the world face two very distinct 
political paths. 
On one hand, there is a growing 
movement toward oligarchy, in which 
a small number of incredibly wealthy 
and powerful billionaires own and con-
trol a very significant part of the econ-
omy and exert enormous influence over 
the political life of our country, and 
that is precisely what we are seeing 
today. The rich get richer, and with 
their wealth, they buy and sell politi-
cians, put huge amounts of money into 
the political process, huge amounts of 
money into lobbying, huge amounts of 
money into TV ads and other ways to 
influence people. 
So that is one direction that this 
country can continue to move in, but 
there is another direction. That other 
direction is opposition to oligarchy and 
corporate greed, and it is the creation 
of a movement of working people and 
young people who are today, in ever in-
creasing numbers, fighting for justice— 
economic justice, racial justice, social 
justice, 
environmental 
justice—and 
they are fighting for justice in a way 
that we have not seen in years. It is 
that growing trade union movement 
that makes me so very hopeful for the 
future of this country, and it is a 
movement that I hope all of us will 
strongly support. 
I yield the floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1924 
April 4, 2022 
our committee, a committee that the 
Presiding Officer serves on, and the im-
portance of passing toxic exposure leg-
islation to deliver the right care and 
the right benefits to the right veterans 
in the most veteran-friendly way pos-
sible—to deliver the right benefits to 
the right veterans in the most veteran- 
friendly way possible. 
Our military men and women are 
willing to sacrifice much for our coun-
try. We must match that level of com-
mitment by crafting thoughtful and ef-
fective solutions to make certain we 
provide the best outcomes, care and 
treatment, and benefits for those who 
have served our Nation. 
In the past 2 years, I have heard tes-
timony from nearly every veteran serv-
ice organization emphasizing the im-
portance of fixing the process the VA 
uses to provide healthcare and benefits 
to toxic-exposed veterans and the need 
to grow our knowledge to help care for 
the toxic wounds of war. 
There have been calls for Congress to 
act more quickly, and I respect those 
calls. Our committee hears those calls. 
We are in lockstep on the challenge 
here and the need for a solution that is 
veteran centric. There is bipartisan 
consensus on the Committee on Vet-
erans’ Affairs that a phased approach— 
delivering healthcare now and reform-
ing the benefits system next, in fact, as 
we go now—is the most effective path-
way forward. 
The Senate has already acted on the 
first step, and we are actively partici-
pating and partnering with the Depart-
ment of Veterans Affairs on the second. 
Senator TESTER, the chair of the Sen-
ate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, 
and I have been working together to 
craft a fair and transparent process for 
toxic-exposed veterans, beginning with 
the Health Care for Burn Pit Veterans 
Act, which unanimously passed the 
Senate and was sent to the House in 
February. 
This 
bill 
remains 
the 
quickest way to make certain that sick 
veterans who are suffering from the ef-
fects of exposure to toxic substances 
are immediately eligible for lifesaving 
healthcare. 
For 6 weeks—for 6 weeks—this bill 
has sat in the House of Representatives 
rather than being sent to the Presi-
dent’s desk to start making an impact 
on those sick and ailing veterans. 
President 
Biden 
has 
called 
in 
March—I think it is March 12—called 
for the House to pass this legislation 
and is committed to signing it into 
law. 
This legislation was cosponsored by 
every single member of the Senate 
Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, and 
each of my Senate colleagues showed 
their support of this legislation by vot-
ing yes. This legislation was crafted by 
the efforts between Senator TESTER 
and I and members of the Senate Com-
mittee on Veterans’ Affairs. The VA 
Secretary has stated this bill would de-
liver outcomes that he cannot achieve 
without congressional action. 
Again, the President called for this 
bill to be sent to his desk, so he can 
sign it, and last week, at a hearing be-
fore 
our 
committee, 
Secretary 
McDonough reiterated both of these 
facts, underscoring the need for action. 
However, the House has yet to take up 
this important piece of legislation and, 
rather, sent us the PACT Act. While 
the PACT Act includes the critical 
Health Care for Burn Pit Veterans Act, 
signaling broad support—again, sig-
naling broad support in the House for 
this legislation, it also includes late 
additions that lack adequate review 
and provisions that will stretch the VA 
beyond its operational capacity, mak-
ing it uncertain that veterans will be 
able to quickly access the benefits. 
The PACT Act needs to be amended. 
Secretary McDonough said as much be-
fore our committee last week. During 
that testimony, I learned about ways 
the PACT Act needed to be amended, 
and I heard about the importance of in-
corporating the results of the VA’s on-
going pilot model, designed to deter-
mine 
how 
to 
better 
address 
the 
healthcare needs and benefits of our 
veterans. 
If Congress acts too hastily and legis-
lates prematurely—again, it is hard to 
envision a Congress ever acting too 
hastily. We are slow in what we do, and 
I again understand the need for quick 
action, but if we do legislate pre-
maturely, we could end up with a situ-
ation similar to what veteran care-
givers are now experiencing. 
In the MISSION Act, we passed legis-
lation giving veteran caregivers great-
er opportunities to care for those fam-
ily members, but that system, as we 
saw in a hearing just a few weeks ago, 
is not working for veterans, and wit-
ness testimony before our committee is 
among the most compelling that we 
have ever had about the faults of the 
way that legislation is being imple-
mented by the Department of Veterans 
Affairs. 
A caregiver of a post-9/11 Army vet 
stated about the Comprehensive Assist-
ance for Family Caregivers program. 
The program should have been a blessing. 
However, the program has become unpredict-
able, stressful, and, frankly, dehumanizing. 
I invite those who did not view this 
hearing to find it and watch to see a 
glimpse of the future we are seeking to 
avoid by making certain we get this 
right. 
The VA developed its pilot model last 
year to evaluate and implement pre-
sumptions for service-connection re-
sulting in the establishment of 12 pre-
sumptions 
for 
respiratory 
ailments 
thus far. The Secretary has cited the 
collaboration among the best scientists 
to devise and execute this model. 
Its potential has been demonstrated, 
and we should continue to review it in 
its entirety and allow for the process 
to conclude, which is to happen very 
shortly. The legislation we pass should 
not fail to take into account the work 
that is going on at the Department of 
Veterans Affairs utilizing input from 
veterans and the science and medical 
expertise of others. 
The VA concluded this pilot last 
week, and I look forward to examining 
this pilot in depth to help improve leg-
islation while mitigating disruptions 
to the VA’s work in caring for all of 
our veterans. Whether statutory or 
regulatory, reform must establish a 
consistent threshold of scientific evi-
dence, and the decision-making process 
must be transparent for all who were 
involved in the care of veterans. 
Veterans who are sick and suffering 
have waited long enough, and they 
should be able to access healthcare 
without further delay. And when the 
Department 
completes 
its 
ongoing 
work, Congress can then meet the 
needs of veterans with the benefits 
they deserve. 
When our men and women suffer the 
consequences of military service, it is 
our responsibility—it is our responsi-
bility—to see that they receive the 
healthcare and benefits they earned. It 
is the right thing to do, and it is the 
cost of going to war. We have no op-
tion. 
I highlight this for my colleagues, 
ask the House to proceed in passage of 
the legislation we sent them with 
unanimous consent, and I look forward 
to an expeditious resolution of the 
process the Department of Veterans Af-
fairs is going through to make sure we 
know all the facts so that the legisla-
tion is right and we avoid pitfalls we 
have seen in other circumstances. 
And with that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
UKRAINE 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, over 
this last weekend, the world saw a 
much clearer picture about the atroc-
ities 
being 
committed 
by 
Russian 
forces in Ukraine. 
As Russian troops withdrew from cer-
tain areas in the north, around Kyiv, 
Ukrainian forces are moving into these 
cities for the first time in weeks. 
In Bucha, a city just north of Kyiv, 
devastating images showed the carnage 
from the Russian occupation. Photos 
showed burned-out apartment build-
ings, bodies lining the streets, and 
mass graves. It appears that some of 
the victims died execution style, with 
their hands tied behind their backs. 
The world can be under no illusion 
about Putin’s barbarity. Russian forces 
have targeted residential neighbor-
hoods, 
humanitarian 
evacuation 
routes, and even a bread line. The dis-
covery of hundreds of dead civilians in 
Bucha underscores the urgent need to 
hold Putin accountable for his crimes 
and to help the Ukrainians defend their 
country. 
Of course, people around the world 
have united in condemnation of Putin’s 
heinous actions, but those statements 
must be accompanied by further ac-
tion. Putin really doesn’t care whether 
we like him or not. He has his own 
plans and his own aims. 
We need to take additional actions 
that impose even greater costs on Rus-
sia. Following Russia’s unprovoked in-
vasion, the United States and our allies

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1925 
April 4, 2022 
imposed powerful sanctions on Russian 
businesses and oligarchs and cut off 
Russian banks from the global finan-
cial system. 
The goal, of course, is to make it im-
possible for Putin to fund his war ma-
chine. And in the beginning, the results 
were encouraging. In the immediate 
aftermath of the invasion, the ruble 
plummeted to a record low, but, unfor-
tunately, in the last few weeks, it has 
slowly rebounded. 
One of the biggest drivers of that sta-
bilization is Russia’s sale of oil and 
gas. Fortunately, the United States is 
no longer one of its customers, and I 
hope we never will be again. 
Our European allies depend on Rus-
sian energy to keep the lights on, but 
even they are reevaluating their en-
ergy dependency and looking for alter-
native energy producers. Poland has 
committed to ending its import of Rus-
sian energy by the end of this year, and 
I hope more countries will follow suit. 
But we can’t sit around and just wait 
for that to happen. We need to do more 
to raise the cost of this war, this 
unprovoked invasion on Ukraine. 
Every day Putin persists, more inno-
cents die. It appears Russia has found a 
loophole in some of our current sanc-
tions. The Russian Federation is buy-
ing gold to offset the devaluation of 
the ruble and then selling gold on the 
international markets in exchange for 
high-value currency. In short, Russia is 
laundering money through the inter-
national gold markets, and we need to 
stop it. 
That is why a bipartisan group of 
Senators, including myself, have intro-
duced the Stop Russian GOLD Act that 
would bring an end to this circumven-
tion of our sanctions. This legislation 
would apply sanctions to parties who 
help Russia finance their war by buy-
ing and selling this blood gold. 
That means anyone who buys or 
transports gold from Russia’s central 
bank holdings would themselves be the 
target of sanctions—a big deterrent for 
anyone considering doing business with 
Russia. 
We need to take every measure pos-
sible to cut the financing of Putin’s 
war machine, and this is one important 
way to do so. 
This is not just a matter of coun-
tering Russia or supporting Ukraine, 
we must remain clear-eyed in our ef-
forts to do both. We have to do both. Of 
course, the ultimate goal is to help 
Ukraine vanquish Russian forces en-
tirely. The United States and our allies 
have already provided a large quantity 
of military assets to Ukraine. And 
there is no question: These resources 
have been critical in the Ukrainians 
success so far. 
But there is no substitution for the 
will to fight and the leadership being 
provided by President Zelenskyy. That, 
I believe, has been the difference—and 
certainly not what Vladimir Putin an-
ticipated. 
But as we continue to hear from 
President Zelenskyy and our partners 
in Europe, we know we need to do 
more, and we need to do it faster. I 
know it is easy to think, well, we will 
just let the supply chains and the logis-
tic systems work as they always have, 
but we are not being bombarded by 
Russian artillery or being attacked by 
cruise missiles, as are the Ukrainians. 
Last month, I traveled to Poland and 
Germany with Senator ERNST and a bi-
partisan group of Senate colleagues to 
hear directly from those who are most 
in harm’s way. 
The primary message we heard was: 
We need more. We need more humani-
tarian aid; we need more weapons; and 
we need it faster—more Stingers, more 
Javelins, more air defenses, more le-
thal aid, including the need for air-
craft. 
I remain somewhat confused and dis-
appointed that the Biden administra-
tion still publicly refuses to transfer 
MiG–29 aircraft to Ukraine so that 
they can use them. 
I know it is easy for us to sit back 
and say, Well, they really don’t know 
how to use them, or they don’t need 
them, but the fact is Ukrainian pilots 
are trained to fly these Russian air-
craft—and who are we to deny Presi-
dent 
Zelenskyy 
and 
the 
valiant 
Ukrainians whatever they think they 
need in order to do the job? 
President Biden explicitly said Putin 
‘‘can’t remain in power.’’ But then his 
administration seems to blame some-
thing like a simple transfer of aircraft 
as too provocative. 
This doesn’t make any sense. We 
can’t play into Putin’s hand by with-
holding needed or desired military as-
sets to Ukraine. We in Congress need to 
play our part as well to make sure that 
anything and everything we can do to 
help the brave Ukrainians, we are 
doing. And we can’t move at the speed 
of the normal bureaucracy. 
Every day, Ukrainians are being 
killed—both the military and civilians 
alike—by Putin’s war machine. They 
need help now, not after the Senate’s 
next work period, not after the Biden 
administration succumbs to a public 
pressure campaign. They need help 
now. 
Unfortunately, Congress doesn’t have 
the authority to insist upon the trans-
fer of the Polish MiGs, but we can re-
move some of the redtape that prevents 
the timely transfer of other defense ar-
ticles Ukraine needs. Mr. CARDIN, the 
senior Senator from Maryland, and I 
have introduced bipartisan legislation 
called 
Ukraine 
Democracy 
Defense 
Lend-Lease Act to ensure that Ukrain-
ian forces have the resources they need 
to win this fight. 
Our bill is rooted in the same prin-
ciples as the original Lend-Lease Act 
in World War II that was largely re-
sponsible for supplying Britain and our 
other allies the planes, the ammuni-
tion, and the weapons they needed in 
order to defeat Nazi Germany. Presi-
dent Roosevelt, at the time, vowed to 
transform the United States into the 
arsenal of democracy, and the Lend- 
Lease Act was one way we did that. 
I think it is important, particularly 
at this perilous time, for us to send an-
other strong bipartisan message that 
we are not just in this for the short 
haul, we are in this for the long haul, 
for however long it lasts, for however 
long the Ukrainians are willing to fight 
to defend their country against this in-
vasion, and this is one way we can do 
it. 
This legislation authorizes the Presi-
dent to enter into lend-lease agree-
ments directly with Ukraine and pro-
vide Ukrainian forces with the lethal 
weapons needed to defend their sov-
ereignty. 
Part of the difficulty of transferring 
these weapons is the supply chains and 
production lines for the weapons that 
are being used at a high rate. 
What the Lend-Lease Act would do 
would be to send the message that, 
again, we are in this for the long haul, 
and the manufacturers of these weap-
ons can be assured that if they are will-
ing to be part of that arsenal of democ-
racy, they won’t be left hanging or left 
high and dry. 
In short, this will also allow us to an-
swer Ukraine’s call to provide more of 
what they need and get it to them as 
quickly as possible. 
So far, more than 20 Senators from 
both sides of the aisle have cosponsored 
this legislation, and I hope we can pass 
it and pass it soon. This is an emer-
gency. We don’t have time to dither, 
and Congress has the opportunity right 
now to do more to provide support to 
Ukraine. 
So I say, let’s pass this legislation 
and ensure Ukrainians have what they 
need when they need it. It is absolutely 
critical for the Senate to pass this leg-
islation, and it doesn’t matter which 
route they take to the President’s 
desk. They could move as stand-alone 
bills or as part of a larger package of 
bills or as amendments to a bipartisan 
piece of legislation that passed the 
House last month. The actual vehicle 
isn’t important. What matters is that 
we get these bills to the President’s 
desk as soon as possible. Every day 
that goes by without action on our part 
is a day wasted and another day that 
innocent Ukrainians are being killed. 
To have the best shot at winning this 
conflict, Ukraine needs two things: a 
strong defense and a weak opponent. 
This week, the Senate has an oppor-
tunity to pass two bipartisan bills that 
address both of those efforts, and I 
hope we will do so this week. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

OFFICER. 
The

The senior assistant legislative clerk

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1926 
April 4, 2022 
just broke in the last couple of days— 
that corporate profits are at the high-
est they have been since 1950. In other 
words, corporations are making more 
money in the calendar year 2021 than 
any year since 1950. That is 70-plus 
years. Corporate profits are through 
the roof. 
We also know—and that came out 
today—the Wall Street Journal, a very 
pro-business, 
pro-corporate 
America 
newspaper, pointed out that CEO com-
pensation 
has 
gone 
up 
stratospherically. 
We know, as the Presiding Officer 
from Illinois has pointed out in the 
past, too, that corporate profits have 
continued to go up, that CEO pay has 
been stratospheric, and that workers’ 
wages have essentially been flat. 
We also know that corporations—es-
pecially oil companies, shipping com-
panies, meatpacking companies, and 
drug 
companies—have 
raised 
their 
prices dramatically higher than infla-
tion. 
So what we are seeing is that cor-
porate profits are the highest in 70 
years; CEO compensation is the highest 
ever—big raises last year; and prices 
have gone up, especially in those four 
industries, because they have essen-
tially taken advantage of the pan-
demic, the opportunity during the pan-
demic for them to raise prices. 
So one of the biggest reasons we have 
inflation is not because we invested in 
the American people with the Recovery 
Act and the bipartisan infrastructure 
bill; one of the biggest reasons for in-
flation is corporate executives saw an 
opportunity during the pandemic. All 
these supply chain issues, all these 
problems 
of 
outsourcing 
jobs 
to 
China—in the meatpacking industry 
and the oil industry and the prescrip-
tion drug industry, in industry after in-
dustry—the shipping industry—these 
CEOs are thinking they can raise their 
prices more. So they have raised their 
prices more, their profits have gone up, 
executive compensation continues to 
go up dramatically, and then they 
blame inflation on the President or 
blame inflation on the Congress or 
whatever. 
The fact is that these companies 
have abused the public trust, as we 
know, by dramatically raising prices in 
one of the most difficult times in our 
Nation’s history, during this pandemic. 
They should be ashamed of themselves, 
but many of them brag to stockholders 
‘‘Look how well we are doing,’’ and 
that is a serious problem. 
In fact, there is a company in Ohio 
that not too long ago announced—a 
big, storied U.S. company, Goodyear— 
that they were going to expand manu-
facturing in the United States. Do you 
know what happened? Their stock price 
went down because these companies de-
cided that maybe that is not such a 
good thing. The stockholders decided 
it. 
Starbucks’ CEO has come back—the 
CEO and the founder—and he an-
nounced that his company was going to 
cut back or eliminate some of the exec-
utive compensation, some of the stock 
buybacks. His stock price went down. 
So investors are saying: Yeah, we 
love our country, but if it is going to 
help workers, maybe we are not so ex-
cited, or if it is going to help commu-
nities, maybe we are not so excited. 
It is sort of capitalism upside down. 
We know from this President and from 
what we are doing, our economy is 
growing faster than China’s—first time 
in 20 years. We know that the Presi-
dent and the Senate and the House are 
putting workers in the center of our 
economic policy. But we know CEOs 
aren’t following that playbook. They 
are squeezing workers as hard as they 
can. They are paying themselves more 
in stock buybacks. Their profits are up. 
Their stock prices, when they talk—we 
know all those things. Yet CEO behav-
ior simply hasn’t changed. 
Our mission as Members of this body 
is to continue to invest in workers, to 
continue to invest in the middle class, 
to continue to advocate for the dignity 
of work, and continue to put workers 
in the center of our economy. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
BORDER SECURITY 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, last week, the Biden administra-
tion announced their truly incompre-
hensible decision to suspend the use of 
title 42 authority along the southern 
border. Now, this is just the last in a 
long line of decisions that this White 
House has made that defy both reason 
and a mountain of evidence suggesting 
they are about to make a deadly mis-
take. 
Even with those title 42 protections 
in place, this February was the worst 
February for illegal immigration and 
border crossings in almost 20 years. 
The past year was the worst year for il-
legal border crossings since at least 
1960, and according to public reports, 
the Department of Homeland Security 
predicts that it is only going to get 
worse. We will soon see the crossings 
increase. 
They are preparing for up to 18,000 at-
tempted border crossings per day. That 
is right—18,000 attempted crossings per 
day. Now, I want to put this in perspec-
tive for you. About 90 percent of the 345 
towns in my State of Tennessee have a 
population smaller than 18,000 people— 
smaller than the number of people DHS 
expects are going to try to enter the 
country illegally every single day. This 
is chaos. This is border chaos. Think 
about this: That is like a small Ten-
nessee town every single day of the 
week, of the month, of the year. 
So we have to ask ourselves, how 
long can we sustain this? And when we 
look at this border that is in chaos and 
18,000 a day—a small town a day com-
ing into the country, trying to claim 
asylum, illegally entering the country. 
And we have evidence that this is going 
to escalate sooner rather than later. 
And this is the moment that the Biden 
administration chooses to strip away 
one of the most important and effec-
tive border control tools that we have 
at our disposal—take it away just as 
we know that people are coming to the 
border in record numbers. 
And how do we know this? We know 
that the cartels are now working in 
countries all across the globe. They are 
doing this because they are saying: 
Hey, now you are really going to get 
in. Pay up. Make the cartels richer be-
cause you know this, President Biden— 
he is all for doing away with the bor-
der. He is all for opening that border up 
and saying: Come on. Come on. 
I think that we have to keep in mind 
a few things. Now, when you keep that 
in mind—those 18,000 people a day— 
think about the new set of statistics 
that we have coming from Border Pa-
trol this month. So far this year, CBP 
officers in Memphis have seized more 
than 2,500 pounds of drugs. You know, I 
had a sheriff tell me: We used to look 
at drugs in grams and ounces. Now it is 
all in pounds because of the quantities 
coming across this border because of 
Joe Biden’s policies. 
During the last 2 weeks of March, of-
ficials in El Paso seized more than 100 
pounds of drugs and arrested 37 fugi-
tives. Those fugitives weren’t petty 
criminals. Among them were a mur-
derer, a pedophile, a fraudster, a coun-
terfeiter, and multiple drug dealers. 
Yes, that was 2 weeks, and that is what 
they had right there in El Paso. These 
are the ones they could identify. And, 
in addition to the drugs, 37 fugitives 
from justice were trying to enter our 
country and escape justice in their 
country. It is an open door. This is dan-
gerous—very dangerous. 
On March 29, in a separate drug bust, 
Border Patrol seized more than $400,000 
worth of meth, fentanyl, and heroin. 
That is right. That was 1 day, one drug 
bust. And over the course of a 24-hour 
period ending on March 30, Border Pa-
trol stopped five migrant smuggling 
events and arrested 140 people. 
Now, I thought it was interesting 
that CBP chose to use the term ‘‘mi-
grant smuggling’’ for that one, but I 
think we should call it what it is: It is 
human 
trafficking—5 
human 
traf-
ficking events, 1 day, 140 people. 
You know, I just have to say, what in 
the world does this administration 
think is going on at that border? Why 
will the President not go down there? 
Why will he not empower people to do 
their job? Why will he not build a wall, 
put surveillance, apprehend people, 
turn them back? But to knowingly let 
them come into this country, to know 
that cartels are working around the 
globe, that they are going to get rich 
on this—it is kind of like the Biden 
bonus for the cartels. The doors are 
open; bring them. 
This is unbelievable—absolutely un-
believable. These drug dealers and 
human traffickers spend their days 
running back and forth across that bor-
der under the watchful eye of the car-
tels. The cartels are in control on the

Mexico side of this border. You do not 
come across unless you have paid the 
cartel. 
And those cartels are going to use 
those 18,000 people, the equivalent of a 
Tennessee 
town—90-percent 
of 
our 
towns are 18,000 people or less—coming 
across, being used by the cartels as 
human shields. What kind of compas-
sion is this? What kind of protection 
for the American people is this? It is 
disgusting. 
We know that these cartels are going 
to be able to push these people into the 
interior, and then those people are 
going to lose themselves in this wave 
of humanity, because that is what they 
have been doing for the past 15 months. 
Meanwhile, 
here 
in 
Washington, 
Democrats have spent 15 months at-
tacking border security as a racist bar-
rier to their open borders agenda. Their 
spin isn’t rooted in reality, but neither 
is their current ambition to throw open 
the border in the name of optics. I 
want to be clear here. If the Democrats 
indeed abandon title 42, they might 
bump up their approval numbers with 
the liberal base, but they are also in-
viting a humanitarian catastrophe on a 
massive scale. 
Yes, indeed, as I was out in East Ten-
nessee, up on the Upper Cumberland 
Plateau, this Friday, what I heard from 
every single law enforcement officer, 
every county mayor was that, now, be-
cause of the human trafficking, the 
gangs, drug trafficking, sex trafficking, 
every single town is a border town. 
Every State is a border State, because 
all these people coming across the bor-
der are coming to your community 
with their drugs, with their gangs. And 
if we empower the cartels and open the 
floodgates to drug dealers and human 
traffickers, we are not just putting our 
own communities at risk, we are en-
dangering the thousands of women and 
children that these criminals are hid-
ing behind because they are trafficking 
them. So much for their optics. 
I think it is clear by now that the 
Biden administration is almost en-
tirely controlled by the activists who 
helped him gain power. When people 
back home ask me to describe what it 
is like working in the Senate these 
days, I tell them it feels like a food 
fight between liberal special interest 
groups. The Democrats are just throw-
ing spaghetti against the wall, waiting 
to see what sticks. 
Now, they have made a real mess, but 
they can’t seem to gain traction on 
anything. So why is that? Well, be-
cause the reality of the situation in 
New York and California and Illinois 
tells the people all they need to know 
about what is in store for the country 
if the Democrats get what they want. 
They are working with a truly miser-
able track record. Take a look at it: 7.9 
percent inflation. The prices are going 
up, whether it is at the gas pump or the 
grocery store. Zero commitment to 
border security—we are seeing that 
played out in realtime. Embassies in 
Afghanistan and Ukraine are left to 
rot. That is right. He pulled people out. 
He pulled people out and left a lot of 
our people behind—and a nominee for 
the Supreme Court who is proudly 
untethered to the Constitution. 
Joe Biden really has earned that 55 
percent disapproval rating; hasn’t he? 
Unlike our friends in the mainstream 
media who think this is all a joke, the 
American people are taking this very 
seriously. For them, common sense 
isn’t political. It is practical, and it is 
necessary. They don’t need an activist 
or a journalist or a comedian to tell 
them what they believe. They know ev-
erything that Joe Biden and his admin-
istration and the Democrat control of 
the House and Senate—everything they 
have touched has turned to dust, is on 
a downward slide—everything. Just 
look at this. Look at what they have 
done in a very short period of time. 
They also know, when it comes to 
our Supreme Court Justice nominee— 
people in Tennessee know what a 
woman is. They don’t need a biologist 
to tell them. They know that reckless 
government spending is making their 
life more expensive every day and, in 
some cases, unaffordable. And they 
know full well because many of them 
have worked, been a part of our mili-
tary, volunteered to serve. They are 
people who have come home, and they 
are working in law enforcement. They 
know and will tell you that peace 
comes through strength, not through 
surrender, and they are not going to 
tolerate a government that claims ig-
norance of all this, that wants to do 
happy talk and say: Everything is 
going to be just fine. Don’t believe 
your eyes. Don’t believe your eyes. 
Don’t believe that price at the gas 
pump. Oh, the grocery store shelves, 
they are full—even though the produce 
aisles may be mostly empty. 
They know that the woke mob is 
knocking at their door, and they know 
the consequences and what it means to 
them. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to

Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF KETANJI BROWN JACKSON 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, it 
was just a short time ago in the Senate 
Judiciary Committee that we voted to 
advance 
the 
nomination 
of 
Judge 
Ketanji Brown Jackson to serve as the 
next Associate Justice on the United 
States Supreme Court. 
In the coming days, Judge Jackson’s 
nomination will come before the full 
Senate. We are on track to confirm her 
this week. 
Judge Jackson is an outstanding 
nominee. 
She 
has 
earned 
support 
across the political and ideological 
spectrums, and her qualifications are 
second to none. Most importantly, 
Judge Jackson’s record on the bench is 
one of evenhandedness, impartiality, 
and independence. 
Despite this, not a single Republican 
on the Judiciary Committee would 
vote in favor of her nomination. I am 
disappointed—not surprised, but dis-
appointed. As a result, Judge Jackson 
will be the first Supreme Court nomi-
nee in the modern era to require a dis-
charge from the Judiciary Committee. 
It is unfortunate, in one respect, given 
that she is more prepared to serve on 
the High Court than, perhaps, any 
nominee in living memory, even by the 
standards of our Republican colleagues. 
During the Trump administration, 
Senate Republicans laid out what they 
viewed as being the standards for sup-
porting a Supreme Court nominee. In 
their own words, a nominee to the High 
Court should be confirmed if they meet 
three criteria. Let’s take a look at 
those criteria. 
First, Republicans have argued that 
you must have mainstream, bipartisan 
support for a nominee. For instance, in 
speaking 
out 
about 
then-Judge 
Gorsuch, 
the 
senior 
Senator 
from 
Texas said that Gorsuch was ‘‘a main-
stream 
nominee 
unanimously 
sup-
ported by Democrats in the past.’’ 
Well, lucky for them, Judge Jackson 
is well within that judicial main-
stream, and she has the receipts to 
show it. 
Judge Jackson is supported by mul-
tiple Federal judges appointed by Re-
publican Presidents, including Judge 
Thomas 
Griffith, 
Judge 
Michael 
Luttig, and Judge Bruce Selya. She is 
supported by dozens of conservative 
lawyers, including former Secretary of 
Homeland Security Michael Chertoff, 
former Deputy Attorney General Don-
ald Ayer, and former Solicitor General 
Charles Fried. She has broad support 
from law enforcement organizations 
and former prosecutors. 
They keep saying: Oh, she is soft on 
crime. She has the endorsement of the 
largest police organization in Amer-
ica—the Fraternal Order of Police—and 
the International Association of Chiefs 
of Police and 87 former assistant U.S. 
attorneys who have prosecuted a range 
of criminal offenses here in the Dis-
trict of Columbia. Soft on crime? The 
prosecutors don’t think so. 
And, 
like 
Judge 
Gorsuch, 
Judge 
Jackson has been unanimously sup-
ported by Senate Republicans, espe-
cially since she was confirmed unani-
mously by the Senate not once but 
twice to be a member of the U.S. Sen-
tencing Commission and a district 
court judge. 
In short, Judge Jackson has had 
mainstream, bipartisan support right 
here in the Senate over and over again. 
The second standard laid out by Re-
publicans during the Trump adminis-
tration was that a Supreme Court 
nominee must have exceptional legal 
credentials. 
We went for 4 straight days. She 
faced 24 hours of questioning—24 hours

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1928 
April 4, 2022 
of question after question after ques-
tion, written questions, oral ques-
tions—over and over. How many ques-
tioned her qualifications to be on the 
Supreme Court? None. Not one. 
In 2018, for instance, the Republican 
leader called then-Judge Kavanaugh an 
‘‘absolute all-star,’’ specifically men-
tioning he was a Yale undergrad, Yale 
Law, and had impeccable credentials. 
Judge Jackson passes that same test. 
She clerked at every level of the Fed-
eral judiciary. I can tell you, as a law-
yer, that to be a clerk for any judge 
has great honor and distinction. To be 
a clerk on all three levels of the Fed-
eral court, including the Supreme 
Court, is extraordinary. It just hardly 
ever occurs. It did for Judge Jackson. 
She served as a Federal public de-
fender, a staff attorney, a commis-
sioner on the Sentencing Commission, 
and as a lawyer in private practice. Her 
resume is absolutely star-studded in 
terms of legal experience. For almost a 
decade, she served on the Federal 
bench, handling some 1,100 matters, 
issuing 600 written opinions. Do you 
want to know what she thinks about an 
issue? how she thinks about an issue? 
Just read the written opinions on every 
type of legal issue imaginable that 
came before her. 
Altogether, Judge Jackson meets, if 
not exceeds, the qualifications of pre-
vious nominees, and the Senate Repub-
licans have enthusiastically supported 
them. They should support her. 
The third and final standard Repub-
licans have articulated for supporting a 
Supreme Court nominee is they must 
have a judicial record and a reputation 
of evenhandedness. 
In 2020, for instance, the Republican 
leader highlighted then-Judge Amy 
Coney Barrett’s ‘‘openminded judicial 
temperament,’’ Amy Coney Barrett. 
Well, by the very same metric, Judge 
Jackson easily passes muster. Her 
record on the bench is clearly one of 
impartiality and independence. She has 
ruled for and against the Presidents of 
both political parties. She has ruled for 
prosecutors and ruled for criminal de-
fendants. She has ruled for employers 
and employees. In her nearly 10 years 
on the bench, Judge Jackson has dis-
played no political or ideological favor-
itism. 
Some people on the far left are upset 
that she isn’t more of an advocate for 
their point of view. She takes a bal-
anced approach to it. She has never al-
lowed her personal views to influence 
any outcome, and she has been a model 
of judicial restraint. She has been guid-
ed by precedent, by fidelity to the rule 
of law, and by an unyielding belief that 
the Constitution must work for all 
Americans. 
I was listening when Senator MCCON-
NELL came to the floor and announced 
that he would not vote for her. The No. 
1 reason: She wouldn’t take a position 
on packing the Court—packing the 
Court. That is a question of changing 
the composition of the Supreme Court, 
the number of Supreme Court Justices. 
There has only been one elected official 
in recent memory who has changed the 
composition 
of 
the 
Court—Senator 
McConnell. You will remember, with 
the Scalia vacancy, he kept it vacant 
for more than 8 months and denied 
President Obama the opportunity to 
fill it. 
What about the issue of the future 
composition of the Court? Is that a re-
quirement for someone to be supported 
by the Senator from Kentucky? Obvi-
ously not. Amy Coney Barrett wouldn’t 
answer the question. She wouldn’t give 
an opinion. She, like Judge Jackson, 
said: That is a matter of policy. That is 
for Congress to decide—and it is. 
Judge Jackson easily passed the 
three tests the Senate Republicans es-
tablished for supporting a Supreme 
Court nominee, and she passed the 
tests with flying colors. She is, simply 
put, one of the Nation’s brightest legal 
minds. She has outstanding creden-
tials, an unimpeachable character, and 
an unwavering dedication to the rule of 
law. She is smart, and it shows. 
Judge Jackson also has the tempera-
ment. I can’t tell you how many times 
during the course of the 24 hours of 
questioning she faced last week in the 
Senate Judiciary Committee that I 
thought: That is it. I am going to look 
up at that table, and she is going to 
stand up and say, ‘‘Enough. My family, 
we are going home. We have had it.’’ 
She never did—cool under attack, calm 
under pressure, solid as a pillar. 
She has the acumen, the skill—the 
kind of attributes we demand from a 
Supreme Court nominee—and she has 
devoted her life to serving her country, 
always working to uphold and honor 
the Constitution. She is dedicated to 
protecting judicial independence, ad-
vancing freedom and liberty, and to 
making the Court, its work, and its de-
cisions accessible to all Americans. 
She told that story of when she was 
up for the circuit court—that her opin-
ions were long, she said, because she 
wanted everyone to understand her 
thinking from start to finish—no mys-
tery here—and that she wanted the 
people appearing before her to under-
stand what just happened in that 
courtroom. Why did they win? Why did 
they lose? What were the issues that 
were at stake? What did she think 
about? She takes the time to explain it 
because she believes in the law, and she 
wants all of us to understand and be-
lieve it as well. 
I am going to proudly cast my vote 
to discharge Judge Jackson from the 
Judiciary Committee. Later this week, 
I am going to proudly cast my vote to 
confirm Judge Jackson as the first 
Black woman to sit on the U.S. Su-
preme Court. 
Let’s not hurry to leave for an Easter 
recess—and I am as anxious as every-
one to be with our families—and over-
look the obvious. This is a seminal mo-
ment in American history. We are 
breaking down a wall that has been 
standing for too long. There have been 
115 Supreme Court Justices in our his-
tory, and 108 look like me: a White 
guy. 
The 
others 
are 
representing 
women, representing Latinas, and oth-
ers. They are, of course, very impor-
tant in history. This is too. 
Judge Jackson is going to be an im-
portant part of America, and she is 
going to inspire a lot of people, par-
ticularly young women, to aspire to 
greatness. 
She was discouraged, if you will re-
member her testimony. She went up to 
Harvard and toured it during a na-
tional debate team appearance. She 
liked it so much that she went back to 
her high school counselor in Florida 
and said: I think I want to apply to 
Harvard. 
The counselor said: Listen, honey. 
Don’t do that. You are going to be so 
disappointed. Let’s think about some 
other choices for you. 
She did it anyway. She was accepted 
and went up there, knees shaking, won-
dering if she could cut it. She not only 
cut it; she set records in terms of 
achievement, particularly for a person 
with her background. Her dad worked 
as a schoolteacher, went to law school, 
and convinced her that law was the fu-
ture for her as well. 
She has told so many wonderful sto-
ries about her family. This is an excep-
tional woman. She has lived an ex-
traordinary life. She has a beautiful 
family. She has written a record we 
can all be proud of. Let’s discharge this 
nomination from the Judiciary Com-
mittee and bring it to the floor this 
week. Let’s make history—the right 
kind of history for America. 
I yield the floor.

UKRAINE 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
it hardly seemed possible that the re-
ports and images from Ukraine could 
grow even more horrifying, but they 
actually have. 
In recent days, Ukrainian troops 
have reclaimed the town of Bucha from 
the illegal and illegitimate Russian in-
vasion. And in the wake of the retreat-
ing Russians, the Ukrainians and the 
press have reported evidence of evil, 
wanton torture, rape, and murder of ci-
vilians. There are reports of mass 
graves, of people executed with their 
hands bound behind their backs. The 
photographs and reports are sickening 
and appalling. 
Since before Putin even began his es-
calation, I have spent months pushing 
the Biden administration and our allies 
and partners to get as much lethal as-
sistance possible to the Ukrainians as 
quickly as possible. I have supported

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1929 
April 4, 2022 
many of the steps our President has 
gotten around to taking, but in almost 
every case, I wish he had acted sooner 
and more boldly. 
We know of the horrors committed 
by Russian forces in Bucha because the 
Ukrainian military reclaimed the town 
after pushing back the Russians. These 
latest revelations must only strength-
en and intensify our resolve to get the 
Ukrainians what they need, on the 
timeframe they need, to liberate more 
towns currently under Russian control, 
to prevent Russia from committing 
new atrocities, to fight and to actually 
win this war. 
This also further reinforces what I 
wish more of our European friends real-
ize: This is a time for choosing. This is 
not a time for business as usual, and 
there can be no return to business as 
usual whenever and however the dust 
settles. 
Europe must move more urgently to 
decouple from Russia. Yes, this will en-
tail some short-term economic pain. 
Yes, their own shortsighted energy 
policies have left their countries en-
tirely too dependent. But there are 
times when geopolitical realities and 
moral 
imperatives 
must 
outweigh 
short-term financial costs. Our part-
ners should recognize that such a time 
is staring them right in the face, so 
should our own American private sec-
tor. 
Internationally, I am sure there will 
be much virtue-signaling rhetoric over 
the atrocities committed on Ukrainian 
soil by Russia. Let us be honest that 
referrals to the International Criminal 
Court or invocations of the U.N. 
Human Rights Council may make peo-
ple’s consciences feel better but will 
not curtail the atrocities or stop the 
violence. Only victory in Ukraine can 
do that. 
Finally, the outpouring of outrage at 
these atrocities should prompt a sec-
ond look at other terrible actions that 
the world has come to simply shrug 
and accept. 
The Biden administration is right to 
ask the U.N. to expel Russia from the 
Human 
Rights 
Council, 
but 
they 
shouldn’t stop there. The world that 
rightly recoils in horror at the photo-
graphs from Ukraine should not look 
the other way past Xi’s concentration 
camps for the Uighur people. The mod-
ern totalitarianism of the People’s Re-
public of China is no less abhorrent be-
cause it is sanitized and it is organized. 
The world’s worst abusers of human 
rights do not deserve to sit on such a 
Council. 
BORDER SECURITY 
Madam President, now on another 
matter, our southern border is already 
in crisis on Democrats’ watch. And on 
Friday, the Biden administration an-
nounced they are going to throw open 
the floodgates even wider. 
In December 2020, right before Presi-
dent Biden took office, he said it would 
be ‘‘the last thing we need’’ if we were 
to ‘‘end up with two million people on 
our border.’’ But in 2021, on his watch, 
under his policies, that is exactly what 
America got. 
Last year saw a record-shattering 2 
million arrests on our southern border; 
2 million people—more than the popu-
lation of 13 whole States—from at least 
160 different countries. And those are 
just the people who actually got 
caught. And 2022 is already on track to 
be even worse. As we speak, border offi-
cials are encountering roughly 7,000 
persons each day, and the Department 
of Homeland Security predicts this 
pace could more than double. 
The Biden administration’s own offi-
cials say they are contingency plan-
ning for 18,000 encounters every single 
day. For perspective, that pace would 
be equivalent to 6.6 million—6.6 mil-
lion—per year, a population larger 
than all but 17 of our States. 
Now, thus far, the Biden administra-
tion kept using a legal tool called title 
42, which they inherited from the prior 
administration because of the COVID 
pandemic. 
Title 42 provides a shortcut for swift 
border enforcement. It has given the 
administration a fast track to turn 
people around as they arrive. 
In February, more than 91,000 people 
were immediately turned around under 
title 42. Another 73,000 were allowed to 
stay and navigate our system. 
So, without title 42, instead of adding 
73,000 illegal immigrants to our system 
alone, we would have added more than 
double that—160,000—in just 1 month. 
But, on Friday, the Biden administra-
tion announced an unbelievably bad de-
cision. They are going to further cave 
to the far left that wants open borders. 
They are going to cancel title 42 this 
spring with no real border security 
plan to replace it. 
This is such an absurd decision, such 
an unforced gaffe, that even some of 
our Senate Democratic colleagues have 
come out swinging. Our colleague from 
West Virginia correctly described this 
as ‘‘a frightening decision’’ to abandon 
‘‘an essential tool’’ when ‘‘we are al-
ready facing an unprecedented increase 
in migrants.’’ Another Senate Demo-
crat said, ‘‘This is the wrong decision.’’ 
A third said it ‘‘shows a lack of under-
standing about the crisis at our bor-
der.’’ A fourth said the move ‘‘will like-
ly lead to a migrant surge that the ad-
ministration does not appear to be 
ready for.’’ 
The problem is that these same Sen-
ate Democrats have backed this far- 
left administration over and over again 
on immigration. Every single Demo-
cratic Senator supported both Secre-
taries Mayorkas and Becerra. Every 
single Democrat Senator voted against 
preserving ‘‘Remain in Mexico,’’ voted 
against defunding sanctuary cities, and 
voted against an amendment that 
would have funded the full enforcement 
of all immigration laws. 
Later this week, we expect every 
Democratic Senator to vote to confirm 
a Supreme Court nominee who is a 
proven judicial activist on this very 
issue. Judge Jackson has gone beyond 
the judicial role to rewrite immigra-
tion policy from the bench and make it 
even more liberal. In one case, she ig-
nored the plain text of the law to reach 
a more liberal outcome. She even tried 
to force a nationwide injunction on the 
entire country. Judge Jackson went so 
far beyond the law to remake immigra-
tion policy that even the liberal DC 
Circuit had to overturn her mistaken 
ruling. An Obama appointee wrote the 
decision that overturned Judge Jack-
son. 
So I am glad to see our Democratic 
colleagues belatedly waking up to the 
border crisis and beginning to pressure 
the administration. Fourteen months 
late is better than never. But votes 
speak louder than press releases. The 
measure of a Senator’s position isn’t 
our rhetoric; it is actually our votes. 
If our colleagues who have stood in 
lockstep with President Biden’s border 
crisis thus far are serious about turn-
ing over a new leaf, they can start with 
the Supreme Court vote later this 
week. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
HEINRICH). The majority leader. 
NOMINATION OF KETANJI BROWN JACKSON 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, in a 
few moments, the Senate will begin to 
make history this week by voting to 
discharge the nomination of Judge 
Ketanji Brown Jackson out of the Judi-
ciary Committee so we can confirm her 
as the next Associate Justice of the Su-
preme Court. 
This procedural step should be en-
tirely unnecessary. There is no ques-
tion—no question—that Judge Jackson 
deserves a strong bipartisan vote in 
committee, 
but 
sadly, 
despite 
the 
judge’s qualifications, not a single Re-
publican on the committee voted to re-
port her out of committee. 
So we shouldn’t have to be taking 
this step, but we are moving forward 
all the same without delay. Despite Re-
publicans opposing her in committee 
and despite this procedural vote to-
night, the end result will remain un-
changed: Judge Jackson ultimately has 
enough support to get confirmed on a 
bipartisan basis, and the Senate is 
going to keep working until this nomi-
nation is complete. 
In closing, I want to emphasize some-
thing I said earlier today. This is a joy-
ous and history-making moment for 
the Senate—a historic one. One hun-
dred fifteen individuals have come be-
fore this Chamber for consideration to 
the highest Court in the land, but 
none—none—were like Judge Jackson. 
Like many before her, Judge Jackson 
is brilliant. She is esteemed. She is 
highly accomplished. But never, never 
has the Supreme Court had a Black 
woman bear the title of ‘‘Justice.’’ 
Imagine the impact this will have on 
our democracy. Imagine what it will 
mean for young people across the coun-
try to look at our courts and see them 
better reflect our Nation’s makeup. 
Judge Jackson’s brilliant record will 
surely light a fire of inspiration for 
others to follow in her footsteps, and 
our country will be all the better for it.

tem that provides the following: accelera-
tion, velocity, position, attitude, platform 
azimuth, magnetic and true heading, alti-
tude, body angular rates, time tags, and co-
ordinated universal time (UTC) synchronized 
time. SAASM enables the GPS receiver ac-
cess to the encrypted P(Y) signal providing 
protection against active spoofing attacks. 
7. The LAU–129 Guided Missile Launcher is 
capable of launching a single AIM–9 (Side-
winder) family of missiles or AIM–120 Ad-
vanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile

mechanical and electrical interface between 
missile and aircraft. 
8. The M61A1 Vulcan Cannon is a six-bar-
reled 
automatic 
cannon 
chambered 
in 
20x120mm with a cyclic rate of fire from 
2,500–6,000 shots per minute. This weapon is a 
hydraulically powered air cooled Gatling gun 
used to damage/destroy aerial targets, sup-
press/incapacitate 
personnel 
targets 
and 
damage or destroy moving and stationary 
light material targets. 
9. The AN/AAQ–33 Sniper Advanced Tar-
geting Pod (ATP) is a single, lightweight tar-
geting pod for military aircraft that provides 
positive target identification, autonomous 
tracking, Global Positioning System (GPS) 
coordinate generation, and precise weapons 
guidance from extended standoff ranges. It 
incorporates a high definition mid-wave For-
ward-looking infrared (FLIR), dual-mode 
laser, visible-light High Definition television 
(HDTV), laser spot tracker, video data link 
(VDL), and a digital data recorder. 
10. The Multifunctional Information Dis-
tribution System Joint Tactical Radio Sys-
tems (MIDS-JTRS) Link–16 is an advanced 
command, control, communications, and in-
telligence (C3I) system incorporating high 
capacity, jam-resistant, digital communica-
tion links for exchange of near real-time tac-
tical information, including both data and 
voice, among air, ground, and sea elements. 
It provides the warfighter key theater func-
tions such as surveillance, identification, air 
control, weapons engagement coordination, 
and direction for all services and allied 
forces. With modernized cryptography, Link 
16 will ensure interoperability into the fu-
ture. 
11. AN/ARC–238 radio with HAVE QUICK II 
is a voice communications radio system that 
is equipped with HAVE QUICK II, which em-
ploys cryptographic technology. Other wave-
forms may be included as needed. 
12. The AN/APX–126 or equivalent Ad-
vanced Identification Friend or Foe (AIFF) 
Combined Interrogator Transponder (CIT) is 
a system capable of transmitting and inter-
rogating Mode V. Mode IV and Mode V anti- 
jam performance specifications/data, soft-
ware source code, algorithms, and tempest 
plans or reports will not be offered, released 
discussed, or demonstrated. 
13. The Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing Sys-
tem II (JHMCS II) or Scorpion Hybrid Opti-
cal-based Inertial Tracker (HObIT) is a de-
vice used in aircraft to project information 
to the pilot’s eyes and aids in tasks such as 
cueing weapons and aircraft sensors to air 
and ground targets. This system projects vis-
ual targeting and aircraft performance infor-
mation on the back of the helmet’s visor, en-
abling the pilot to monitor this information 
without 
interrupting 
his 
field 
of 
view 
through the cockpit canopy. This provides 
improvement for close combat targeting and 
engagement. 
14. The AN/ALQ–254 Viper Shield or equiva-
lent Integrated Electronic Warfare (EW) 
Suite provides passive radar warning, wide 
spectrum Radio Frequency (RF) jamming,

certain 
cir-
cumstances. 
15. The AN/ALE–47 Countermeasure Dis-
penser Set (CMDS) provides an integrated 
threat-adaptive, computer controlled capa-
bility for dispensing chaff, flares, and active 
radio frequency expendables. The system is 
internally mounted and may be operated as 
a stand-alone system or may be integrated 
with other on-board Electronic Warfare (EW) 
and avionics systems. The AN/ALE–47 uses 
threat data received over the aircraft inter-
faces to assess the threat situation and de-
termine a response. Expendable routines tai-
lored to the immediate aircraft and threat 
environment may be dispensed using one of 
four operational modes. 
16. The KY–58M is a lightweight terminal 
for secure voice and data communications.

The AIM–9X Block II SIDEWINDER Missile 
provides a high off-boresight seeker, en-
hanced countermeasure rejection capability, 
low drag/high angle of attack airframe and 
the ability to integrate the Helmet Mounted 
Cueing System. This potential sale includes 
Tactical Guidance Unit Spares. 
22. The AIM–9X Block II Captive Air Train-
ing Missile (CATM) is a flight certified inert 
mass simulator with a functioning Guidance 
Unit (GU). The CATM is the primary aircrew 
training device providing all pre-launch 
functions as well as realistic aerodynamic 
performance that equate to carrying a tac-
tical missile. The CATM provides pilot train-
ing in aerial target acquisition and use of 
aircraft controls/displays. This potential sale 
includes CATM Guidance Unit Spares. 
23. The Joint Programmable Fuze FMU–139 
or FMU–152 fuzes are multi-delay sensors 
compatible with weapon guidance kits, tail 
kits, high-explosive bombs, and reduced col-
lateral damage weapons which provide all 
arming and detonation event functions com-
bined in a single fuze system. 
24. Laser JDAM (Joint Direct Attack Mu-
nitions) (GBU–54) converts existing unguided 
free-fall bombs into precision guided smart 
munitions by adding a new tail section con-
taining Inertial Navigation System (INS) 
guidance/Global Positioning System (GPS) 
guidance and adds a Semi-active laser seek-
er. This allows the weapon to strike targets 
moving at up to 70 mph. The LJDAM weapon 
consists of a DSU–38 sensor, a JDAM guid-
ance set installed on bomb body and a fuze. 
The DSU–38 consists of a laser spot tracker 
(same size and shape as a DSU–33 proximity 
fuze), a cable connecting the DSU–38 to the 
basic JDAM guidance set, a cable cover, 
cable cover tie down straps, modified tail kit 
door and wiring harness, and associated 
modified JDAM software that incorporates 
navigation and guidance flight software to 
support both LJDAM and standard JDAM 
missions. 
The KMU–572 is the tail kit for a GBU–54, 
500LB Laser JDAM. 
25. The Enhanced Paveway II (EP II) Laser 
Guided Bomb (LGB) is a maneuverable, all- 
weather, free-fall weapon that guides to a 
spot of laser energy reflected off the target. 
The ‘‘enhanced’’ component is the addition 
of GPS-aided Inertial Navigation Systems 
(GAINS) guidance to the laser seeker. Laser 
designation for the LGB can be provided by 
a variety of laser target markers or designa-
tors. The EP II consists of an MAU–210 En-
hanced Computer Control Group (ECCG) that

NOMINATION OF ERIK 
KRISTOPHER RAVEN 
Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the fol-
lowing statement be printed in the 
RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
INTRODUCTORY REMARKS FOR ERIK RAVEN (AS 
DELIVERED) 
U.S. SENATOR JON TESTER—SENATE COMMITTEE 
ON ARMED SERVICES 
(March 22, 2022) 
It is truly an honor to be introducing Erik 
Raven today at his nomination hearing to be 
Undersecretary for the Navy. 
It is an honor because there is no one more 
qualified or capable than Erik is to serve the 
women and men of our Navy. 
I know firsthand, because Erik is the 
Democratic Staff Director for the Sub-
committee on Defense of the Senate Com-
mittee on Appropriations, and for the last 
year, I have worked very, very closely with 
him in my role as Chairman on that Com-
mittee. In that time, we’ve spoken every 
day—something I know Erik has enjoyed 
very much. 
Erik is a true professional. He is dedicated, 
he is whip-smart, and he knows the defense 
budget better than anybody. 
But that’s only part of what makes Erik 
qualified and deserving of being confirmed 
for this position at the Department of De-
fense. 
What makes Erik exceptional is that he 
deeply understands the challenges and the 
threats we face, and he has dedicated his life 
to our military, our national security, and to 
our country. 
For the last 24 years, Erik has served as a 
staff member for some of the Giants of the 
Senate: Sen. Dianne Feinstein, Sen. Ted 
Kennedy, and Sen. Robert Byrd—you may 
have heard of them. 
Erik served as Senator Byrd’s Military and 
Foreign Affairs Advisor from 2000 to 2007, and 
as his Legislative Director from 2006–2007. He 
also served as a speechwriter for Senator 
Byrd on national security matters. 
Some of you may not know this, but my of-
fice in Hart is Senator Byrd’s old office. And 
welcoming Erik back into that office after I 
became SAC–D Chairman is a fitting sym-
metry to the end of his Hill career before he 
sails off to the Pentagon. 
But I’m not the only SAC–D Chairman who 
has benefitted from Erik’s wisdom and lead-
ership. 
For the past 15 years—7 as a Professional 
Staff Member and 8 as Staff Director—Erik 
has served Senators, the Senate, and our na-
tion. 
As the Staff Director, he is the principal 
advisor to the Committee on budgetary mat-
ters relating to the Department of Defense 
and the national intelligence community. 
And during his time on the Committee, 
Erik has been responsible for the oversight 
of national intelligence programs, national 
security space programs, Special Operations 
procurement, Army aviation, and Navy re-
search and development matters, as well as 
staff lead on wartime intelligence, surveil-
lance, and reconnaissance initiatives. 
Erik is as credentialed as he is experi-
enced: he has completed a master’s thesis on 
the origins of China’s nuclear weapons pro-
gram at the London School of Economics 
and Political Science as well as an under-
graduate honors thesis on the international 
narcotics trade at Connecticut College. 
This dude is a smart guy. 
And he has good people in his corner: I 
want to recognize his wife, Ann, who is here 
today—and thank you, Ann, for sharing Erik 
with the Senate, and soon, I hope, with the 
Department of Defense. The gratitude our 
country owes Erik for his service, we also 
owe to you. 
The bottom line is this: Erik Raven will 
serve as Undersecretary for the Navy honor-
ably and well. He is exceptionally qualified 
and deserving of this Committee’s favorable 
endorsement, and I’m sure that the distin-
guished members of this Committee will 
agree after getting a chance to question him. 
Erik, I just want to congratulate you on 
your nomination, and get in there and give 
’em hell, okay? 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
f 
RECOGNIZING THE NATIONAL AS-
SOCIATION FOR HOME CARE AND 
HOSPICE 
Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I 
rise today to celebrate the 40th anni-
versary of one of the leading voices in 
healthcare, the National Association 
for Home Care and Hospice. Estab-
lished on April 2, 1982, from three sepa-
rate organizations, for four decades, it 
has been a voice for the essential and 
dedicated organizations that provide 
healthcare services to over 12 million 
patients annually in their own homes. 
NAHC has provided valuable and 
trusted information that has helped 
guide Congress, the administration, 
Federal agencies, and many other 
health policy planners as we support 
the ability of patients to receive high 
quality healthcare at home. 
From the beginning, NAHC has rec-
ognized that complex health policy 
issues require a unified voice. NAHC 
has brought together providers rep-
resenting a wide range of home services 
including home health, hospice care, 
home and community-based services, 
home infusion therapy, private duty 
nursing for pediatric and adult pa-
tients, personal care services, home- 
based palliative care, and more. These 
providers are big and small, free-
standing and part of larger institu-
tions, nonprofit and commercial, rural 
and urban. 
Healthcare continues to shift to care 
provided in the home—and with good 
reason. Providing expanded, holistic 
care in one’s own home when clinically 
appropriate can improve the lives of 
patients while increasing quality and 
efficiency. 
I pay tribute today to NAHC’s dec-
ades of work to expand access to 
healthcare at home, and I look forward 
to partnering with NAHC members and 
staff for many more years to come.

FAITH MONTH 
Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Madam Presi-
dent, Americans across the country, 
led by Concerned Women for America, 
the Nation’s largest public policy orga-
nization for women, and other faith- 
based organizations are celebrating 
April as Faith Month. I commend this 
noble effort calling all people of faith 
to join in prayer, thanksgiving, and 
celebration of their faith. 
The United States of America was 
born of the unanimous declaration that 
we are ‘‘endowed by [our] Creator with 
certain unalienable Rights,’’ based on 
‘‘the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s 
God,’’ 
‘‘appealing 
to 
the 
Supreme 
Judge of the world,’’ and acknowl-
edging our ‘‘reliance on the protection 
of divine Providence.’’ We are a people

of faith, which is why religious freedom 
is known as America’s first freedom, as 
laid out in the Establishment and the 
Free Exercise clauses of the First 
Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. 
The freedom of speech is guaranteed by 
the First Amendment and also sup-
ports America’s unique focus on free-
dom of expression, including in matters 
of faith. 
America’s Judeo-Christian founding 
promotes religious diversity and toler-
ance. Our motto, ‘‘In God We Trust,’’ 
further emphasizes the importance of 
faith in our Nation’s founding. From 
our first President to the last, we have 
always acknowledged America’s faith. 
President George Washington recog-
nized ‘‘it is the duty of all Nations to 
acknowledge the providence of Al-
mighty God, to obey His will, to be 
grateful for His benefits, and humbly 
to implore His protection and favor.’’ 
More recently, President Joe Biden ac-
knowledged Thanksgiving as a ‘‘time 
to reflect on our many blessings—from 
God, this Nation, and each other.’’ 
Religious liberty serves to strength-
en our country’s appreciation of all 
peoples, regardless of faith. But eternal 
diligence is needed to preserve reli-
gious freedom. Attacks on religious 
liberty and people of faith continue to 
plague our Nation with some religious 
charities even being forced to betray 
the tenets of their faith in order to par-
ticipate in certain government pro-
grams. We must actively reject all ef-
forts to criminalize or cancel religious 
beliefs as somehow incompatible with 
our democracy. 
Religious organizations in America 
have a rich history of charitable en-
gagement by helping the sick, poor, 
and afflicted. They should be cele-
brated, not maligned for their con-
tributions to improving our way of life. 
According to the Pew Research Center, 
more than 75 percent of Americans 
practice some type of religious faith. 
This rich, diverse religious heritage is 
to our credit and should be encouraged. 
Therefore, I join millions of Ameri-
cans during this Faith Month in cele-
brating their personal faiths freely and 
openly, with public displays and cele-
brations, including prayer and expres-
sions of thanksgiving. In this manner, 
we can strongly reaffirm our commit-
ment to the religious liberty principles 
of our founding.

TRIBUTE TO JACK LESLIE 
Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the following 
letter honoring Jack Leslie, be printed 
in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
TRIBUTE TO JACK LESLIE 
DEAR JACK, Congratulations on your re-
tirement. It’s hard to think of you as retired. 
In the decades since you got your career 
start in the United States Senate, working 
for Ted Kennedy, you have made a lasting 
difference throughout the world: in leading 
Sawyer Miller; in your very long and incred-
ibly 
successful 
run 
heading 
Weber 
Shandwick; in communications in the United 
States and around the world; and in your 
countless contributions to international or-
ganizations, to boards, and to leadership and 
development. 
I thank Caroline, Web, and Finn, for shar-
ing you with so many of us over so many 
years. I know you’re excited to have more 
time to spend with the family, but I know 
you will continue your service to our nation 
as well. 
Jack, you’ve been a leader on more boards 
than I can name, among them, Water.org, 
the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Founda-
tion, the UNHCR American Advisory Com-
mittee, and of course, most importantly, in 
my view, the United States African Develop-
ment Foundation. You’ve been appointed and 
reappointed by Senates with both Repub-
lican and Democrat majorities; by presi-
dents, 
both 
Democrat 
and 
Republican. 
You’ve made an indelible mark here and 
around the world. 
Thank you for your friendship, your ad-
vice, and your encouragement in my dozen 
years here in the Senate. And thank you for 
the incredible difference you’ve made with 
your heart, with your service, and with your 
charm, wit, and insights. 
Sincerely, 
CHRIS COONS.

These invasions hit close to home for 
Leo. When Leo was younger, his family 
had to make the hard decision to relo-
cate from Belarus for a better life. He 
lived in refugee camps in Austria and 
Italy for five months prior to arriving 
in Kansas City in 1989. Leo is now an 
entrepreneur in Overland Park, which 
gave him connections to multiple dif-
ferent businesses in the Kansas City 
area. When Russia invaded in late Feb-
ruary, Leo gathered his resources from 
these leaders andorganizations making 
his efforts to help possible. 
Thus far, Leo has been successful in 
helping 2,000 Ukrainians flee to safety 
in Moldova. In an effort to continue 
helping victims of the war in Ukraine, 
Leo is planning on hosting another 
Zoom call and inviting more prominent 
business leaders in the area to gather 
and keep providing this humanitarian 
aid. It is truly honorable what he is 
doing to help the people of Ukraine. 
Leo said it best: ‘‘In this case, this has 
really brought out the best of the com-
munity here in Kansas. They’re ready 
to save people who they have no clue 
who they are, that live thousands of 
miles away, they don’t even share a 
common language with them, besides 
the fact that we’re human beings and I 
think that is amazing.’’ It truly is 
amazing to see what one man’s ambi-
tion and determination can do to bring 
a community together and help those 
in need. I ask my colleagues to join me 
in recognizing the noble act of Leo 
Khayet and thank him for his dedica-
tion to help Ukraine.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mr. REED (for himself and 
Mr. MENENDEZ): 
S. 3990. A bill to amend the Securi-
ties Exchange Act of 1934 to prohibit 
certain securities trading and related 
communications by those who possess 
material, nonpublic information, and 
for other purposes; to the Committee 
on Banking, Housing, and Urban Af-
fairs. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, today, I 
am joined by Senator MENENDEZ in in-
troducing the Insider Trading Prohibi-
tion Act, a bill that will finally define 
the offense of insider trading. This leg-
islation is desperately needed because, 
in the absence of a statutory defini-
tion, the courts have cobbled together 
a dizzying array of interpretations of 
anti-fraud statutes, creating what is an 
inconsistent and complicated body of 
common law for deciding insider trad-
ing cases. What should be simple has 
become unnecessarily complex. 
Indeed, Judge Jed Rakoff, who has 
presided over many insider trading 
cases before the Southern District of 
New York, wrote in a recent opinion 
that ‘‘the crime of insider trading is a 
straightforward 
concept 
that 
some 
courts have somehow managed to com-
plicate.’’ 
Consider the following hypothetical 
example. A financial analyst receives 
information about XYZ Corporation’s 
earnings from a company insider, like 
an executive or board member, before 
this information is publicly released. 
The analyst then shares this inside in-
formation with her portfolio manager 
who subsequently trades in XYZ stock. 
I suspect most Americans would agree 
that the portfolio manager was given 
an unfair advantage. But the courts are 
not so sure. They have left an open 
question whether this very trade would 
constitute illegal insider trading. Ex-
perts agree that this kind of judicial 
uncertainty is one reason among many 
of why Congress must clarify the law of 
insider trading. 
Former SEC Commissioner Robert J. 
Jackson and former U.S. Attorney 
Preet Bharara have written that ‘‘[t]he 
shoddy state of American insider-trad-
ing law affects everyone. Prosecutors

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1938 
April 4, 2022 
and regulators are stuck enforcing laws 
that are ill-suited to 21st-century mis-
conduct. Lawyers struggle to tell their 
clients what they can and cannot do 
within the bounds of the law. And ordi-
nary Americans are left asking wheth-
er financial markets are stacked in 
favor of those who skirt the rules.’’ 
Columbia Law School Professor John 
C. Coffee, Jr., noted that ‘‘[t]here is 
general agreement today that the law 
of insider trading has grown overly 
complex and technical. As a result, it 
is hard for the public to understand its 
logic or for practitioners to give advice 
with respect to the scope of the prohi-
bition. Moreover, to the extent that in-
sider trading is judge-made law, dis-
parities and inconsistencies among the 
U.S. circuit courts becomes inevitable 
because there is little in the way of a 
definitive statutory text to provide 
precise guidance.’’ 
State regulators agree, too. For ex-
ample, Maryland Commissioner of Se-
curities Melanie Senter Lubin recently 
stated on behalf of the North American 
Securities Administrators Association 
that ‘‘[d]efining the standards for in-
sider trading liability by statute would 
add greater clarity and consistency to 
this important area of the law.’’ 
This 
is 
precisely 
what 
Senator 
MENENDEZ and I are doing in our bill. 
We are seeking to finally distill the of-
fense of insider trading to clear bright 
line rules. Simply put, if a person 
trades a security on the basis of infor-
mation that the person is aware is ma-
terial and nonpublic and is aware was 
wrongfully obtained, then that person 
has engaged in unlawful insider trad-
ing. 
Under our legislation, insider trading 
would be prohibited if a trader knows 
or has reason to know that her infor-
mation was wrongfully obtained, for 
example, through theft, bribery, hack-
ing, misappropriation, or a breach of a 
fiduciary duty for a personal benefit. 
We do not intend to restrict those who 
take the time to independently develop 
their own information from publicly 
available sources from trading on the 
independently developed information. 
By cracking down on those who rig 
securities markets to favor the well 
connected, our legislation provides ev-
eryday investors with a fair shot at 
seeing some returns after investing 
their hard-earned savings. Incidents of 
insider trading, and the perceived per-
vasiveness of the practice, have for 
years served to validate the public’s 
worst assumptions about Wall Street 
culture. It is time we clearly define 
what is appropriate under the law and 
take this meaningful step towards im-
proving the integrity of our securities 
markets for professional traders and 
retail investors alike. 
I 
would 
like 
to 
thank 
Senator 
MENENDEZ for working with me on this 
legislation, and I urge our colleagues 
to join us in supporting the Insider 
Trading Prohibition Act.

clearance 
of 
unexploded ordnance enables displaced peo-
ple to return to their homes and has a direct 
impact on development outcomes such as 
food security, school attendance, and eco-
nomic development; 
Whereas people in at least 60 countries and 
other areas are at risk from mines and 
unexploded ordnance in their communities; 
Whereas more than 125,000 deaths and inju-
ries resulting from anti-personnel or anti-ve-
hicle mines and other explosive remnants of 
war have been recorded in the Landmine 
Monitor database since 2001, and thousands 
more individuals around the world are killed 
and injured by such mines and remnants 
each year; 
Whereas, over the past 3 decades, the 
United States has been the global leader in 
supporting efforts to clear mine-contami-
nated areas around the world, dedicating 
more than $4,000,000,000 for demining and re-
lated programs since 1993 and helping to 
eliminate more than 90,000 tons of ordnance 
in nearly 40 countries; 
Whereas, since 1989, the United States 
Agency for International Development has 
allocated more than $324,000,000 through the 
Leahy War Victims Fund in more than 50 
countries to provide artificial limbs, wheel-
chairs, rehabilitation, vocational training, 
and other assistance to survivors of acci-
dents caused by landmines and unexploded 
ordnance; 
Whereas landmines contaminate countries 
in which the United States Armed Forces 
have been engaged in combat or stabilization 
operations, including Iraq, Syria, Kosovo, 
and Somalia, posing a significant risk to 
United States military personnel; 
Whereas the United States Government ex-
pressed its support for the Maputo +15 dec-
laration of June 27, 2014, which established 
the goal ‘‘to destroy all stockpiled anti-per-
sonnel mines and clear all mined areas as 
soon as possible,’’ and ‘‘to the fullest extent 
possible by 2025’’; 
Whereas there are 164 States Parties to the 
Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, 
Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of 
Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruc-
tion, done at Oslo September 18, 1997, al-
though the United States is not yet among 
them; 
Whereas the recent use of landmines, clus-
ter bombs, and other munitions, particularly 
in 
the 
Middle 
East, 
Afghanistan, 
and 
Ukraine, has created new humanitarian pri-
orities 
and 
funding 
requirements 
for 
demining, while legacy mine contamination 
remains an urgent challenge impacting mil-
lions of people globally; 
Whereas additional resources for demining 
will be needed to achieve a world free of the 
threat of landmines and other explosive haz-
ards; and 
Whereas, on December 8, 2005, the United 
Nations General Assembly declared that 
April 4th of each year shall be observed as 
the International Day for Mine Awareness 
and Assistance in Mine Action: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) reaffirms the commitment of the 
United States to support international hu-
manitarian efforts to eliminate landmines 
and unexploded ordnance; 
(2) recognizes those individuals in numer-
ous countries who, at great risk to their per-
sonal safety, work to locate and remove 
anti-personnel landmines and unexploded 
ordnance; 
(3) affirms its support for the goal, as ex-
pressed by the Maputo +15 declaration of 
June 27, 2014, to intensify efforts to clear 
mined areas to the fullest extent possible by 
2025; 
(4) calls upon the United States Govern-
ment— 
(A) to continue providing the funding nec-
essary to support international humani-
tarian demining activities; 
(B) to maintain its international leader-
ship role in seeking to rid the world of areas 
contaminated by landmines and unexploded 
ordnance; and 
(C) to rededicate itself to addressing legacy 
mine contamination as an urgent humani-
tarian priority; and 
(5) reaffirms the goals of the International 
Day for Mine Awareness and Assistance in 
Mine Action. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, 16 years 
ago the United Nations General Assem-
bly designated April 4 as the Inter-
national Day for Mine Awareness and 
Assistance in Mine Action. Today, I am 
introducing a Senate resolution recog-
nizing that designation and reaffirming 
United States leadership in elimi-
nating landmines and unexploded ord-
nance. 
As we read the reports of with-
drawing Russian troops leaving land-
mines to terrorize, maim, and kill 
Ukrainian civilians, we are reminded of 
the necessity to redouble our efforts to 
ban these insidious weapons once and 
for all. The mines in Ukraine will re-
main a deadly hazard there long after 
the fighting ends, whenever that time 
comes. 
Landmines and other unexploded ord-
nance cause death and terrible injuries 
to people in dozens of countries, mostly 
places where the ability to provide life-
saving medical care and long-term re-
habilitation and vocational support is 
lacking or far from adequate. 
The United States continues to pro-
vide the largest share of demining as-
sistance, and we spend many millions 
of dollars annually helping the sur-
vivors. That is something we can be 
proud of. 
But in some countries, like Laos, the 
millions of cluster munitions that 
failed to detonate on contact were 
manufactured in the United States and 
dropped by American aircraft. Fifty 
years later they continue to destroy in-
nocent lives. 
So while the number of landmine and 
UXO casualties has fallen significantly 
since I and others first took on this 
issue in the late 1980s and early 1990s,

we are not where we hoped to be back 
then. 
First, 
the 
Biden 
Administration 
needs to restore the policy on land-
mines that was put in place during the 
Obama 
Administration. 
The 
White 
House said they would but it has not 
happened yet. There is no excuse for 
delaying. 
Second, we need to continue to pro-
vide the funding for humanitarian 
demining 
and 
survivors 
assistance. 
Fortunately, this is not a partisan 
issue. It is simply a matter of con-
tinuing to treat it as a priority. 
And third, this is my last year in the 
Senate and while I will do everything I 
can while I am here, we need others to 
continue to advocate for the United 
States to sign the international trea-
ties banning anti-personnel landmines 
and cluster munitions. It should have 
happened already, and we have to keep 
working until it does. 
I have seen first-hand the effects of 
landmines and other unexploded muni-
tions. It is horrific, especially when it’s 
a young child with a leg or an arm 
missing. Or a parent blinded and crip-
pled by a landmine, being led around 
by a child. 
We should be the country that leads 
the world in ending not only the car-
nage of landmines and UXO left behind, 
but the production, export, use and 
stockpiling 
of 
these 
indiscriminate 
weapons that don’t belong in the arse-
nals of civilized nations.

RESOLUTION 
576—SUP-
PORTING 
THE 
GOALS 
AND 
IDEALS 
OF 
NATIONAL 
PUBLIC 
HEALTH WEEK 
Mr. 
LUJA´ N 
(for 
himself, 
Mr. 
BLUMENTHAL, Mr. BROWN, Mr. HEIN-
RICH, Mr. KING, Ms. KLOBUCHAR, Mr. 
MARKEY, Mr. PADILLA, Ms. SMITH, and 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN) submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was referred 
to the Committee on Health, Edu-
cation, Labor, and Pensions: 
S. RES. 576 
Whereas the week of April 4, 2022, is des-
ignated as National Public Health Week by 
the American Public Health Association; 
Whereas the theme for National Public 
Health Week in 2022 is ‘‘Public Health is 
Where You Are’’; 
Whereas the goal of National Public Health 
Week in 2022 is to recognize the contribu-
tions of public health in— 
(1) improving the health of the people of 
the United States; and 
(2) achieving health equity; 
Whereas, as of the date of introduction of 
this resolution, the United States and the 
global community are responding to the 
COVID–19 pandemic, which requires support 
for— 
(1) a robust public health infrastructure 
and workforce; 
(2) State, territorial, local, and Tribal 
health departments, health care workers, 
public health laboratories, and first respond-
ers; 
(3) diagnostic testing of new and potential 
COVID–19 cases and activities related to epi-
demiology and public health data; 
(4) 
complying 
with 
appropriate 
social 
distancing and quarantine recommendations; 
(5) relieving financial burdens for individ-
uals in the United States hurt by the 
COVID–19 pandemic, including through pub-
lic health emergency leave; 
(6) the Medicaid programs and community 
health centers of States to ensure care for 
vulnerable populations; 
(7) collaboration among the Federal Gov-
ernment, 
State 
and 
local 
governments, 
schools, businesses, and employers to sup-
port public health measures to decrease com-
munity spread of COVID–19; 
(8) investments in the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention that support infec-
tious disease outbreak preparedness and crit-
ical public health infrastructure for State 
and local health departments and public 
health laboratories; 
(9) a comprehensive effort to ensure a suc-
cessful COVID–19 vaccination campaign that 
boosts access to vaccines for vulnerable pop-
ulations and trust in vaccine safety and ef-
fectiveness; and 
(10) efforts to address racism as a public 
health crisis and reduce racial and ethnic 
health 
disparities 
related 
to 
COVID–19 
deaths, vaccine access and testing, and im-
portant health outcomes outside of the pan-
demic such as maternal mortality; 
Whereas, in 2020, the life expectancy at 
birth for the population of the United States 
declined by 1.5 years, which is the largest 
drop in life expectancy since 1943; 
Whereas many of the leading causes of 
death for individuals in the United States re-
sult from chronic conditions, which are 
among the most common, costly, and pre-
ventable of all health challenges; 
Whereas there are significant differences 
in the health status of individuals living in 
the healthiest States and those living in the 
least healthy States, including differences in 
obesity rates, the prevalence of chronic dis-
ease, and the prevalence of infectious dis-
ease; 
Whereas racial and ethnic minority popu-
lations in the United States continue to ex-
perience disparities in the burden of illness 
and death, as compared to the entire popu-
lation of the United States; 
Whereas violence is a leading cause of pre-
mature death, and it is estimated that more 
than 7 individuals per hour die a violent 
death in the United States; 
Whereas deaths from homicides cost the 
economy of the United States billions of dol-
lars, and the violence of homicides can cause 
social and emotional distress, community 
trauma, injury, disability, depression, anx-
iety, and post-traumatic stress disorder; 
Whereas more than 47,500 lives were lost 
due to suicide in 2019, and in May 2020, dur-
ing the COVID–19 pandemic, emergency de-
partment visits for suspected suicide at-
tempts began to increase among adolescents 
aged 12 to 17 years, especially among girls; 
Whereas an estimated 1 in 7 children in the 
United States experience child abuse and ne-
glect, and 1,840 children died of abuse and ne-
glect in 2019; 
Whereas, despite significant progress in re-
ducing the infant mortality rate in the 
United States to a historic low of 5.6 infant 
deaths per 1,000 live births in 2019, the infant 
mortality rate in the United States still 
greatly varies among States; 
Whereas women die from pregnancy-re-
lated complications in the United States at a 
higher rate than in many other developed 
countries, and an estimated 60 percent of 
maternal deaths in the United States are 
preventable; 
Whereas Black mothers experience a ma-
ternal mortality rate 3 to 4 times higher 
than White mothers; 
Whereas there were an estimated 100,306 
drug overdose deaths in the United States 
during the 12-month period ending in April 
2021, the highest level ever recorded during a 
12-month period and an increase of 28.5 per-
cent from the 78,056 deaths during the same 
period the prior year; 
Whereas cigarette smoking is the leading 
cause of preventable disease and death in the 
United States, accounting for more than 
480,000 deaths each year, including more than 
41,000 deaths resulting from secondhand 
smoke; 
Whereas the percentage of adults in the 
United States who smoke cigarettes has de-
creased from 20.9 percent in 2005 to 13.7 per-
cent in 2018; 
Whereas, in 2020, according to data from 
the National Youth Tobacco Survey, 19.6 per-
cent of high school students (3,020,000 stu-
dents) and 4.7 percent of middle school stu-
dents (550,000 students) reported current e- 
cigarette use; 
Whereas data from the National Youth To-
bacco Survey showed that in 2020 approxi-
mately 40 percent of high school e-cigarette 
users were using an e-cigarette on 20 or more 
days of the month, and approximately 1⁄4 of 
high school e-cigarette users were using e- 
cigarettes every day, indicating a strong de-
pendence on nicotine among youth; 
Whereas, in the past 2 decades, heat-re-
lated mortality for older individuals has al-
most doubled, reaching a record high of ap-
proximately 19,000 deaths in 2018; 
Whereas, from 2018 to 2019, the United 
States spent approximately $13 per person on 
climate change adaptation in the health sec-
tor, far less than what is needed to prevent 
the growing health impacts of climate 
change; 
Whereas, in 2016, fine particulate air pollu-
tion led to more than 64,000 premature 
deaths in the United States, and Black and 
Hispanic individuals in the United States 
were disproportionately impacted; 
Whereas voting helps shape the conditions 
in which people can be healthy, and good 
health is consistently positively associated 
with higher likelihood of voter participation; 
Whereas public health organizations use 
National Public Health Week to educate pub-
lic policymakers and public health profes-
sionals on issues that are important to im-
proving the health of the people of the 
United States; 
Whereas studies show that small strategic 
investments in disease prevention can result 
in significant savings in health care costs; 
Whereas vaccination is one of the most sig-
nificant public health achievements in his-
tory and has resulted in substantial de-
creases in— 
(1) the number of cases, hospitalizations, 
and deaths associated with vaccine-prevent-
able diseases; and 
(2) health care costs associated with vac-
cine-preventable diseases; 
Whereas each 10 percent increase in local 
public health spending contributes to— 
(1) a 6.9 percent decrease in infant deaths; 
(2) a 3.2 percent decrease in deaths related 
to cardiovascular disease; 
(3) a 1.4 percent decrease in deaths due to 
diabetes; and 
(4) a 1.1 percent decrease in cancer-related 
deaths; 
Whereas public health professionals help 
communities prevent, prepare for, mitigate, 
and recover from the impact of a full range 
of health threats, including— 
(1) disease outbreaks, such as the COVID– 
19 pandemic; 
(2) natural disasters, such as wildfires, 
flooding, and severe storms; and 
(3) other disasters, including disasters 
caused by human activity and public health 
emergencies;

sector, including city planners, transpor-
tation officials, education officials, and pri-
vate sector businesses, recognizing that 
other sectors can influence health outcomes; 
Whereas, in communities across the United 
States, individuals are changing the way 
they care for their health by avoiding to-
bacco use, eating healthier, increasing phys-
ical activity, and preventing unintentional 
injuries at home and in the workplace; and 
Whereas efforts to adequately support pub-

injury can continue to transform a health 
system focused on treating illness into a 
health system focused on preventing disease 
and injury and promoting wellness: Now, 
therefore, be it

(1) supports the goals and ideals of Na-
tional Public Health Week; 
(2) recognizes the efforts of public health 
professionals, 
the 
Federal 
Government, 
States, Tribes, municipalities, local commu-

and injury; 
(3) recognizes the role of public health in— 
(A) preventing and responding to infectious 
disease outbreaks, such as the COVID–19 
pandemic; 
(B) mitigating short-term and long-term 
impacts of infectious disease outbreaks on 
the health and wellness of individuals in the 
United States; 
(C) addressing social and other deter-
minants of health, including health dispari-
ties experienced by minority populations; 
and 
(D) improving the overall health of individ-

(A) to improve the health of individuals in 
the United States; and 
(B) to make the United States, in 1 genera-
tion, the healthiest country in the world 
by— 
(i) providing greater opportunities to im-
prove community health and prevent disease 
and injury; and 
(ii) strengthening the public health system 
and workforce in the United States; and 
(5) encourages the people of the United 
States to learn about the role of the public

the 
remarks 
of 
Senator 
PORTMAN. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
f 
UKRAINE 
Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I 
come to the Senate floor again today 
to stand in solidarity with the people 
of Ukraine. This is the eighth week in 
a row that I have come to the floor to 
talk 
about 
the 
illegal, 
totally 
unprovoked, and brutal Russian inva-
sion of a sovereign country—their 
neighbor Ukraine—that only wants to 
live in peace. 
Over the weekend, all of us saw the 
brutality of what Russia is doing. We 
saw it up close through shocking vid-
eos and photographs of more than 100 
civilians—not soldiers but civilians— 
lying in mass graves in Bucha, a sub-
urb of Kyiv. 
Yesterday, Human Rights Watch re-
leased a report documenting specific 
atrocities, including rapes and execu-
tions. 
President Zelenskyy painted a vivid, 
heartbreaking picture this weekend 
when he spoke of ‘‘civilians left on the 
streets with their hands tied behind 
their backs—killed execution style.’’ 
Here is one photograph of the shock-
ing scenes that we saw over the week-
end of civilians left in the streets as 
the Russians pulled out of Bucha, but 
it is happening all over Ukraine, these 
kinds of human rights abuses and war 
crimes. 
The 
administration, 
on 
Sunday, 
called for an investigation into the war 
crimes. That is good. Of course, these 
are war crimes. The United States 
must press other countries and must be 
persistent to ensure that a tribunal is 
established; that these war crimes are 
prosecuted; and that people are held 
accountable. 
Last week, Senator DICK DURBIN and 
I, as cochairs of the Senate Ukraine 
Caucus, organized a meeting with four 
members of the Rada, which is the Par-
liament in Ukraine. We were also 
joined by the Ukrainian Ambassador to 
the United States, Oksana Markarova. 
These women told us of the human toll 
in this fight, which they described as a 
fight between good and evil, between 
tyranny and democracy. They talked 
about the fact that Ukraine can be a 
symbol for victory of the West if we 
support them more and if we help them 
win. 
One of the members of Parliament 
described 
for 
us 
the 
scenes 
from 
Mariupol—of the massive shelling and 
of the bodies lying in the streets there, 
too, because it is too dangerous to go 
out to recover them. 
One parliamentarian told us of being 
separated and of often being out of 
touch with her husband, who is in 
harm’s way with the Ukrainian mili-
tary, while she is here telling us these 
stories to encourage us to do more. 
One said that there are 30 Russian 
soldiers living in her grandmother’s 
house. They forced her out into the bit-
ter cold. 
They all told us, with anguish and ur-
gency, of what needs to happen: more 
sanctions, more military assistance, 
more equipment. 
One of them said—and I thought this 
was well put—freedom has to be armed. 
Freedom has to be armed. 
I agree. I believe Ukraine can be vic-
torious if the United States and our al-
lies, especially the Europeans, help 
them to be victorious, and that means 
helping them more. 
They are fighting with heart, and al-
though badly outnumbered, are making 
progress in key parts of the country. 
We have seen this in the region around 
Kyiv, where they are pushing the Rus-
sians out. This is the time to redouble 
our efforts to help ensure victory. It 
has now been 38 days since Russia’s as-
sault began. 
Russia is also now trying to redefine 
their objectives, saying that it was 
never their intention to seize Kyiv and 
the other major urban centers. Of 
course, we know that that is a lie. 
They tried very hard to seize Kyiv. 
They just weren’t successful because 
the Ukrainians fought back so val-
iantly. 
So we need to watch the Russians’ 
actions, not their words. Their actions 
in the south and in the eastern part of 
the country are that they continue to 
bomb, bomb, and bomb civilian targets. 
The most important reason Ukraine 
is winning these battles is, of course, 
the fighting spirit of the men and 
women of Ukraine—the patriots who 
are taking the fight to the Russians on 
the battlefield. They are well trained, 
and we in the West are part of that.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1941 
April 4, 2022 
For the last 4 years, this body, the U.S. 
Senate, has provided funding to help 
train Ukrainians, and it has been very 
helpful. They are also motivated to de-
fend freedom, to defend their home-
land, to protect their families. There is 
no substitute for that kind of fighting 
spirit, and that is what the Russians 
are finding. 
We can also see the complete dis-
regard for the rules of war by the Rus-
sian forces, including, most recently, 
through their actions in Mariupol. The 
words ‘‘children,’’ in Russian, were 
clearly emblazoned on a theater where 
young people took shelter. The letters 
were large enough to be seen from the 
sky to deter bombs. You probably saw 
that. They had the theater and then, 
on the outside, these huge words, say-
ing ‘‘children’’ in Russian. Yet the Rus-
sians bombed this theater. We have 
now learned, sadly, that there were 
more than 300 people killed, mostly 
women 
and 
children. 
They 
were 
trapped in that rubble and killed when 
the theater was hit by a Russian bomb. 
They continue to violate the terms of 
a negotiated humanitarian corridor to 
help civilians flee Mariupol by shelling 
these corridors with artillery as people 
attempt to flee. For the fourth straight 
day, Russia continues to block the Red 
Cross from reaching Mariupol to de-
liver much needed humanitarian aid to 
the city. We know the innocent people 
who are trapped there are dying of 
starvation and dehydration. 
As Russia escalates, civilian targets 
are being hit, in various cities, with 
cluster bombs, with vacuum bombs, 
even with the first-ever use of a super-
sonic weapon. 
Thousands of civilians have need-
lessly died in this senseless war. More 
than 10 million people have been dis-
placed from their homes, and over 4 
million refugees—almost all women 
and children and the elderly—have fled 
the country they love while their men 
have stayed behind to fight the invad-
ers. 
Meeting with refugees a few weeks 
ago as they crossed the Polish-Ukrain-
ian border and hearing their stories 
was heartbreaking. They told stories of 
their trauma through their tears. Al-
though it was heartbreaking for us to 
hear it, they didn’t want our sym-
pathy; they wanted our protection. 
They wanted us to help stop the bomb-
ing. 
The United States must stand with 
our allies against these atrocities. The 
President’s recent speech in Poland un-
derscored the stakes of this conflict if 
Russia wins. Frankly, it will mean the 
international order has failed, and 
more conflict, death, and destruction 
will follow. So this is a war in Ukraine, 
but the implications go well beyond 
the borders of Ukraine. 
Tonight, I, once again, offer some 
ideas about where we can go from here. 
Last week, I talked a lot about our top 
priority on the sanctions front needed 
to be cutting off Russia’s No. 1 source 
of revenue that fuels the war machine, 
and that is the revenue that comes 
from Russia’s energy sales. 
Energy is, by far, Russia’s biggest ex-
port. It accounts for almost half of 
Russia’s entire Federal budget. The 
revenues from oil account for between 
40 and 50 percent of Russia’s budget. 
Over the past year, the average oil rev-
enues going back to Russia from their 
exports to the United States alone, just 
to the United States—and we imported 
relatively little compared to other 
countries in Europe, for instance, but 
it was $50 million a day we were send-
ing to Russia. 
Under pressure from Congress, the 
administration reversed course and 
supported blocking Russian oil, natural 
gas, and even coal imports into the 
United States, thank goodness. It made 
no sense for us to be helping fund the 
Russian war effort, especially when we 
have our own resources here that are 
actually cleaner resources that we need 
to provide access to. 
I welcome the President’s announce-
ment in Poland last week of the cre-
ation of a joint U.S.-European Union 
task force to reduce Europe’s depend-
ency on Russian energy and strengthen 
Europe’s energy security. That agree-
ment is a good step forward. I am glad 
that we agreed to do that and got the 
Europeans to sign on to this agree-
ment, but to make it work, to make it 
actually happen, we have got to sup-
port domestic energy producers here as 
a means of supporting our national se-
curity. 
Especially with this Russian inva-
sion, the importance of the United 
States having an ‘‘all of the above,’’ ro-
bust approach to power our Nation, 
which includes fossil fuels, carbon cap-
ture technologies, hydrogen renew-
ables, and nuclear power, cannot be 
overstated. As a practical matter, if we 
want to stop the revenues going from 
Europe—the billions of dollars—to Rus-
sia to fund this war machine, we are 
going to have to change our policies 
here in America to provide more Amer-
ican liquefied natural gas to go to Eu-
rope. That is what the agreement calls 
for. But we are going to have to change 
policies to make that happen so that 
American energy can substitute for 
Russian 
energy. 
Unfortunately, 
we 
aren’t off to a really good start of late. 
The President just sent his fiscal 
year 2023 budget request to Congress, 
and among the proposals are the elimi-
nation of important tax provisions 
used by our domestic producers, includ-
ing oil and gas, like the deduction for 
intangible 
drilling 
costs, 
or 
IDCs, 
which allow natural gas and oil pro-
ducers to deduct costs that are nec-
essary for the drilling and preparation 
of wells. Taxpayers deduct their costs 
of doing business. IDCs are one such 
cost for energy companies. Short-
sighted proposals like these will serve 
to discourage domestic energy produc-
tion at a time when we need to encour-
age it to help in this war effort. 
Unfortunately, 
the 
administration 
has consistently sent a message to 
American energy producers that one of 
their goals is to phase out the use of 
fossil fuels and make it more difficult 
even now by stifling production. This 
rhetoric, combined with actions like 
canceling the Keystone XL Pipeline— 
billions of dollars have been invested in 
it; suspending new leases on Federal 
lands and waters; and redefining things 
like the waters of the United States, or 
WOTUS, to make energy permitting 
harder—these things have led to uncer-
tainty and less investment in the oil 
and gas industry. We need to reverse 
that, again, along with renewables. 
There is room for all. 
An important initiative to build our 
domestic energy infrastructure is also 
part of the answer. We need more pipe-
lines and we need more LNG export fa-
cilities, and that requires streamlining 
the Federal permitting process. His-
torically, it can take a decade or more 
for the Federal Government to issue 
permits to build pipelines. We have a 
law called FAST–41, which improves 
the permitting process for big projects 
by requiring Agencies in the Federal 
Government to work together to set 
out a plan and a timeline for permit-
ting projects. It also creates what is 
called the Federal Permitting Improve-
ment Steering Council, which can re-
solve disputes over the permitting 
process and get a green light on a 
project much more quickly, whether it 
is oil and gas or whether it is renew-
ables, solar, or wind. Let’s use that 
process to provide this alternative to 
Russian energy. This doesn’t mean not 
following the environmental rules. You 
follow them, but you get the permit far 
more quickly and with much less ex-
pense. 
We have to step forward and lead our 
European allies in doing all they can to 
provide substitutes to Russia’s energy 
sector. 
Yesterday, the country of Lithuania 
became the first EU country to com-
pletely cut itself off from Russian nat-
ural gas. I applaud them for taking this 
strong action and hope other countries 
will quickly follow suit. Lithuania gets 
it. They know that as a country that is 
part of the Baltics in the region, they 
could be next. 
If we don’t do this, we are not going 
to be able to tighten the sanctions on 
Russia because we will continue to 
send, again, billions of dollars to sup-
port the war machine. 
The ruble has recovered its value in 
part because Russia is bringing in rev-
enue from its sale of energy. Shares on 
Russia’s stock market are trading 
again. And Russia’s VTB Bank remains 
open for business in Europe, where it 
has gathered billions of euros in depos-
its, mainly from German savers. 
Our sanctions have left Russia’s big-
gest 
economic 
lifeline 
largely 
un-
touched, and that is energy sales to 
Europe. I know it is harder for them. 
They are much more dependent. That 
is why we need to help more. Since 
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, it is esti-
mated that billions have gone back to

the Kremlin in energy resources and 
revenues from Europe. 
In addition to cutting off the natural 
gas and the revenue that fuels the Rus-
sian war machine, we need to tighten 
up bank sanctions as they relate to en-
ergy. Sanctions for energy transactions 
don’t go into effect against Russia’s 
biggest banks, including VTB Bank, 
until June 24. That is simply too late. 
President Biden must lead the alliance 
to do what it takes to help Ukraine 
win, and the administration needs to 
make clear their objective is for 
Ukraine to win. Things like a June 24 
date for energy transactions are not 
acceptable. 
We need to close the loopholes in the 
sanctions and, of course, provide more 
lethal aid to Ukraine. We need block-
ing sanctions on all of Russia’s finance 
and defense industry. We should expand 
full blocking sanctions on all the 
banks. I continue to call for revoking 
international tax and trade agreements 
that give Russia privileges not appro-
priate for a pariah country. Let’s pass 
the end of PNTR—most favored nation 
treatment—for Russia here on the floor 
of the Senate this week. Let’s get it 
done. Most Russian banks still have ac-
cess to SWIFT when it comes to inter-
national energy transactions. That is 
not acceptable. This is a massive loop-
hole that is sending blood money to 
kill innocent Ukrainians. 
This week, I will introduce legisla-
tion with Senator RON WYDEN of Or-
egon to disallow foreign tax credits for 
companies that pay taxes to the Rus-
sian Government. We have bipartisan 
agreement on policies to ensure Amer-
ican taxpayers are not subsidizing the 
Russian war machine. 
I believe we should seize, not just 
freeze, assets of Kremlin supporters. 
Last week, I introduced, with Senator 
BENNET of Colorado, the Repurposing 
Elite 
Luxuries 
Into 
Emergency 
Funds—RELIEF—for Ukraine Act to 
require the Department of Justice to 
direct any funds resulting from the dis-
posal of seized Russian assets to sup-
port Ukrainian refugees and recon-
struction. So let’s seize these assets, 
like the yachts owned by the Kremlin 
supporters or by President Putin him-
self, and then take those funds and use 
them immediately to help with the hu-
manitarian effort. 
Regarding military assistance, the 
Ukrainians have made it clear they 
desperately 
need 
more 
equipment, 
more munitions, and they need it now. 
In our meeting last week, the members 
of Parliament from Ukraine detailed 
what they need from us, and their list 
is not new. They said they need fighter 
jets. They need these MiGs. They ap-
preciate the Stinger missiles that have 
been effective for lower altitude planes 
and helicopters, but they don’t under-
stand why NATO and the United States 
are blocking other Soviet-era military 
equipment to be able to help them. 
They want these surface-to-air mis-
siles to be able to strike long-range 
Russian artillery rockets and high-alti-
tude rockets that are raining down on 
their cities and killing civilians with 
impunity. This is not too much to ask. 
We have to find ways to send them 
these long-range air defense systems. 
Our 
Eastern 
European 
neighbors 
have S–300s and other systems the 
Ukrainians know how to operate. We 
may have some ourselves. Let’s reposi-
tion our Patriot missiles in those coun-
tries in Eastern Europe so that they 
can then send their old Soviet-style 
systems to Ukraine that the Ukrain-
ians know how to operate. 
It has now been weeks since our Sec-
retary of Defense stood with our NATO 
ally Slovakia and the Slovakian De-
fense Minister said Slovakia was ready 
to transfer S–300 missile defense sys-
tems, which the Ukrainians can oper-
ate, ‘‘immediately.’’ Let’s do it. Com-
pared to what the Ukrainian forces 
have now, more S–300s could cover 
more ground and intercept incoming 
aircraft and missiles. The bureaucratic 
redtape delaying the S–300 transfer is 
costing innocent lives every day. 
We must also find ways to quickly 
provide Ukraine with more armed 
drones, such as the Turkish TB2 and 
one-use loitering munitions, which the 
Ukrainians know how to use and have 
been effective on this battlefield. 
Three weeks ago, it was announced 
that we were sending 100 so-called 
Switchblade loitering munitions. These 
are so-called suicide drones, one-use 
drones, but they can be used to destroy 
an armored vehicle or another target. 
One hundred will go very quickly. We 
should send more, and we should send 
bigger drones, which we have in our in-
ventory. 
They 
could 
be 
effective 
against tanks and effective against 
ships. 
They have been asking for help 
across the board that is not yet deliv-
ered. They have been asking for tanks, 
more anti-ship systems to fend off mis-
siles from the Black Sea, and more 
equipment to clear Russian mines. 
On tanks, they know how to operate 
the Soviet-era T–72 tanks that are in 
the inventory of many Eastern Euro-
pean countries. Let’s facilitate those 
transfers. 
We can do more, and we should do 
more—not weeks from now but now. 
They are not asking for us to fight for 
them, but they are asking for us to pro-
vide them the tools to be able to defend 
themselves. There should be no gap in 
our weapons transfers, and we should 
continue to lead. We need not just or-
ganize our NATO allies, which we have 
done a good job at, in my view, but now 
help to lead our NATO allies in pro-
viding more support and coordinating 
the support from those countries. 
I also believe that both Ukraine and 
Georgia should be given what is called 
a membership action plan, which is the 
next step toward NATO membership. It 
doesn’t make them parts of NATO, but, 
based on the actions of the Russians 
and the fighting spirit of the Ukrain-
ians, I believe more strongly than ever 
that it would put Russia on notice that 
these countries are on the road to fast-
er membership because of what Russia 
has done. 
Some may ask why a Senator from 
Ohio would care about what is going on 
in Ukraine. Well, we should all care. 
This is about the fight for freedom. 
This is where it is being engaged in our 
generation, in our time. 
I also happen to have tens of thou-
sands of Ukrainians who call Ohio their 
home. These Ukrainian Americans are 
friends of mine. They are constituents 
of mine. They have been keeping me 
informed over the years. They have 
helped me to get more engaged in this 
issue. I have been to Ukraine six or 
seven times since 2014, when Ukraine 
made a decision to turn to us, to turn 
to democracy and freedom and free en-
terprise. But even if I had no constitu-
ents who were of Ukrainian descent, I 
would be standing here because this is 
the fight for freedom. This is our test. 
Are we going to stand against tyranny 
and for freedom at a time when these 
terrible 
atrocities 
are 
being 
com-
mitted? 
When I was on the Polish-Ukrainian 
border, I talked to a lot of these refu-
gees, as I said, and through their tears, 
they talked about what was going on. 
They talked about their homes being 
destroyed, their apartments being de-
stroyed, their friends or family mem-
bers being hurt, some killed, the pain 
of being separated from their husbands 
and fathers, not knowing their fate 
back home. By the way, they all want 
to go home. They all want to go home 
desperately. They pleaded for us to do 
more to stop the missiles, and they all 
said: Please, protect the skies. 
They told us of this atrocity up close. 
In the midst of this atrocity, there are 
so many heroes in Ukraine who are 
stepping forward: the soldiers—profes-
sionals and civilians who have taken 
up arms—the doctors and the nurses, 
the firefighters, the volunteers who are 
providing food and water and blankets 
just to keep people alive. We pray for 
all of them. We pray for their families. 
Godspeed to them in their very simple 
quest: a battle for a free and inde-
pendent country. They just want to 
live in peace. 
I will close with this thought. The 
Ukrainians can be victorious but only 
if we help organize other freedom-lov-
ing countries all around the world to 
support them. We must lead. 
One of the members of Parliament 
said it best, I think, when she said she 
hears all the time ‘‘We are all Ukrain-
ians. We are all Ukrainians.’’ 
I think that is a good sentiment. But 
she said: If that is so, then we must be 
like Ukrainians, meaning we must be 
brave, creative, and fast. Her point 
was: We need help; we need it now. Be 
creative. Figure out a way to get those 
tanks there, to get those more power-
ful drones there, to get the planes 
there that they need, to get the hu-
manitarian assistance that they need 
desperately in Ukraine into these cit-
ies. Be brave. Be creative. Be fast.

HONORING THE CITY OF 
AMERICAN CANYON 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 4, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the City of 
American Canyon as it celebrates its 30th an-
niversary this year. 
Nestled between Solano and Napa counties, 
the City of American Canyon, formerly known 
as ‘‘Napa Junction,’’ was incorporated on Jan-
uary 1, 1992. Since then, the small city has 
proved itself to be a vital part of the North Bay 
Area, earning the nickname ‘‘The Gateway to 
the Napa Valley.’’ According to the late John 
Mikolajcik, often called the ‘‘Father of Amer-
ican Canyon,’’ the city is named after the Na-
tive American, Hispanic, and Caucasian com-
munities that lived in the area together as one 
people: Americans. 
Since its incorporation, American Canyon 
and its people have made many contributions 
to the nearby Napa and Solano communities, 
including the construction of a water reclama-
tion facility, senior center, Boys and Girls club, 
community center, public library, high school, 
and middle and elementary schools. The city 
also has a 640-acre open space preserve do-
nated by residents Jack and Bernice Newell, 
where people can enjoy the beautiful nature of 
Wine Country. Further, American Canyon has 
acquired its own zip code, 94503, and a post 
office. 
The people of American Canyon are the 
backbone of this thriving city. From amateur 
sports leagues to religious congregations to 
Girl Scout and Boy Scout chapters, the resi-
dents of American Canyon have created a 
strong, interconnected community. 
American Canyon’s convenient geographical 
location, steady growth, and vibrant commu-
nity culture has earned its status as a premier 
city in Northern California. Over the past three 
decades, the city’s population has grown to 
21,000 residents and is now the gateway for 
travelers from all over the world who seek to 
experience our famous winegrowing region. 
Madam Speaker, it is fitting and proper that 
we honor the City of American Canyon here 
today to celebrate its 30 years of prosperity.

ATRE COMPANY 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 4, 2022 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
ask the House of Representatives to join me 
in celebrating Constellation Theatre Company 
on its 15th anniversary, which is today, April 4, 
2022. 
Constellation Theatre Company was created 
to tell big, powerful stories in intimate spaces. 
Constellation Theatre Company showcases di-
verse stories that reflect the vast range of 
human experience using visual spectacle, dy-
namic movement, live music and passionate 
acting ensembles. These plays and musicals 
spark the curiosity and imagination of audi-
ences in the District of Columbia metropolitan 
area. 
Constellation Theatre Company believes 
that the communal experience of live theater 
promotes compassion, understanding, healing 
and connection—and that we need it now 
more than ever. Constellation Theatre Com-
pany ‘‘brings a global perspective different 
from what every other theatre company in the 
DMV explores.’’ Constellation Theatre Com-
pany has brought to life 45 diverse stories 
from 16 countries. Many of these stories high-
light philosophies of religions that are under-
represented in the Western theatrical canon. 
Constellation Theatre Company has re-
ceived some of the top theater awards in the 
Mid-Atlantic region, including winning 17 Helen 
Hayes Awards and receiving 81 nominations. 
Constellation Theatre Company was voted 
‘‘Best Small Theatre Company’’ by The Wash-

the District of Columbia. Ninety-three percent 
of Constellation Theatre Company shows have 
been directed by women, and many of the ac-
tors and artists have come from diverse back-
grounds. 
Constellation 
Theatre 
Company

gional groups to engage audiences and to cre-
ate change. These groups include: American

nian Journeys and Thornton Wilder Society.

ticing law. In addition to these career accom-

HONORING MARYLOU HERNANDEZ 
ARMER 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 4, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today along with my colleague, 
Congressman 
JARED
HUFFMAN, 
to 
honor 
Marylou Hernandez Armer in recognition of 
her service to the Santa Rosa Police Depart-
ment. 
Born in 1977, Mrs. Armer grew up in Na-
tional City, California, and attended Morse 
High School. Her aspirations to be a police of-
ficer began early when she enlisted in the Na-
tional City Police Department’s Explorer Post 
2859. 
Mrs. Armer dedicated her career to pro-
tecting her community. Mrs. Armer served with 
the Santa Rosa Police Department for over 20 
years. She joined the Santa Rosa Police De-
partment as a field evidence technician in 
1999. Nine years of civilian service later, she 
was sworn in as an officer. Mrs. Armer be-
came a detective in 2016 and was an investi-
gator in the Sexual Assault and Domestic Vio-
lence Unit. She was a person of deep empa-
thy and compassion and always showed kind-
ness to survivors for whom she pursued jus-
tice. 
On March 31, 2020, our community and our 
Nation lost an outstanding citizen when Mrs. 
Armer passed. She was the first peace officer 
in the state of California taken by the COVID– 
19 pandemic. Mrs. Armer leaves behind her 
husband, Mark Armer, and their daughter. Our 
community and state continue to mourn her 
loss. 
Madam Speaker, it is evident that Mrs. 
Armer dedicated her life to the people of 
Sonoma County through her service to the 
Santa Rosa Police Department and the victims 
of domestic and sexual violence. Therefore, it 
is fitting and proper that we honor her here 
today.

REMEMBERING JERRY THORNE 
HON. ERIC SWALWELL 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 4, 2022 
Mr. SWALWELL. Madam Speaker, today I 
along with Congressman JERRY MCNERNEY 
and Congressman MARK DESAULNIER, ask our 
colleagues to join us to remember Jerry 
Thorne, who passed away on March 27, 2022. 
Mr. Jerry Thorne spent his career serving 
the Pleasanton community, first as a council-
man for more than seven years and then as 
the mayor for eight years. Throughout his ten-
ure, Jerry oversaw Pleasanton’s city park im-
provements, Highway 84 widening and safety 
projects between Livermore and Sunol, and 
strengthened the relationship among the five 
Tri-Valley municipalities to achieve regional 
goals. 
Jerry was raised in Tennessee and earned 
a degree in chemical engineering from the 
University of Tennessee at Memphis, before 
serving in the U.S. Army. He then had an es-
teemed professional career, including nearly 
30 years with Hewlett-Packard and its affili-
ated company Agilent Technologies. 
Moving to Pleasanton in his 20s, Jerry first 
got involved in politics as a volunteer with the 
Pleasanton Seahawks advocating for swim-
ming facilities. He then served on the 
Pleasanton Parks and Recreation Commis-
sion. 
Jerry was a devoted public servant who im-
proved the quality of life and city services in 
Pleasanton. He not only served in leadership 
for the city of Pleasanton, but also rep-
resented the Tri-Valley statewide and nation-
ally through the League of California Cities 
and the U.S. Conference of Mayors. 
Our deepest condolences go out to his wife, 
Kalee Thorne, daughter Keri Thorne Gough 
and two grandchildren. He will be missed by 
the entire Pleasanton community.

HONORING THE LIFE OF 
AGAMYRAT AGAMBAYEV 
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 4, 2022 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to remember and honor the life of Dr. 
Agamyrat Agambayev. This man, still in the 
prime of his life, was ruthlessly murdered in 
broad daylight in Tempe, Arizona. The killer 
took the life of a husband, a father, and an in-
credible immigrant to this country who was all 
set to start his new career working at Intel. 
This young man was loved by many and led 
an impressive life that will not go unnoticed. 
Dr. Agamyrat Agambayev was an impres-
sive scholar receiving his second Ph.D. at Ari-
zona State University. He had also recently 
accepted an engineering job at Intel that he 
worked so diligently to get. But most impor-
tantly, Dr. Agamyrat Agambayev was a friend 
to many, an extraordinary husband and a 
dedicated father to his two year old son. Dr. 
Agamyrat’s wife, Sumeyra Agambayev states, 
‘‘He had a real bright future . . . he was dedi-
cated, smart, and studied tirelessly for years 
at universities to start giving back to the com-
munity here and abroad in Turkmenistan.’’ 
I condemn the crime here, and the loss to 
humanity. I am appalled at the growing crime 
and homeless problems in Tempe and Phoe-
nix. Our people need to be assured they can 
live and work in a community without fear of 
a murderous car jacker lurking to take one’s 
life and property. 
I mourn for his young family. His son will be 
left with little memory of his father. But I hope 
one day his son will read these words, and the 
words of others, and know that his father was 
a bright star in the sky and made the world a 
better place. He lived and died with honor. 
My thoughts and prayers are with his loved 
ones and shall Dr. Agamyrat Agambayev 
never be forgotten.

HONORING BETTY LABASTIDA AS 
WOMAN OF THE YEAR 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 4, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Betty Labastida, 
whom I have named the 2022 Woman of the 
Year in Napa County, California. Woman of 
the Year recognizes women who have made 
important contributions to California’s 5th Con-
gressional District in Arts and Culture, Profes-
sional Achievement, Entrepreneurship and In-
novation or Community Service. 
Ms. Labastida was born in El Centro, Cali-
fornia, to Rosa and Leopoldo Labastida. She 
graduated from California State University, Los 
Angeles in 1968 with a degree in nursing. Ms. 
Labastida began her professional career in 
hospital nursing, and then worked in public 
health nursing. After earning her master’s de-
gree in health service and family nurse prac-
tice from the University of California, Davis in 
1973, she worked for county medical services 
and community clinics for 43 years. During her 
nursing career, she also spent 20 years work-
ing with the Department of State Foreign Serv-
ice. 
After retiring from nursing in 2014, Ms. 
Labastida became dedicated to community 
service. She is best known for her work as a 
volunteer at COVID vaccination sites in Napa 
County, where she utilizes her family nurse 
practitioner 
experience 
and 
her 
bilingual 
speaking skills to help people register for vac-
cinations 
and 
infection 
screenings. 
Ms. 
Labastida has volunteered at approximately 55 
vaccination clinics, primarily through Ole 
Health. 
Ms. Labastida has been a devoted volunteer 
with the non-profit Napa Valley CanDo, which 
creates and collects donations for food banks. 
She has volunteered in CanDo’s community 
garden for four years and has served as a 
Food Project Neighborhood Coordinator for 
five years. 
Ms. Labastida is known throughout her com-
munity for her humble demeanor, dedication to 
others, cheery disposition, and bright smile. 
When she is not serving her community, she 
is having adventures abroad. She is also a de-
voted mother and grandmother to her daugh-
ter, Alisa, and her grandson, Sebastian. 
Madam Speaker, it is evident that Betty 
Labastida has dedicated her life to the people 
of Napa County through her community serv-
ice and nursing career. Therefore, it is fitting 
and proper that we honor her here today.

Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, I want to 
honor Gerald Thornton, also known as Gerry, 
who started his career in 1974 as a District 
Committeeman in Lower Township, Cape May 
County. He was then appointed to Cape May 
County Freeholder in 1976. Later on, Gerry 
became the Chairman of the Board of Elec-
tions for six years and eventually was ap-
pointed as the Director of the Board. He was 
placed in the New Jersey Association of 
Counties Hall of Fame and was recognized as 
Freeholder of the Year for all 21 counties in 
New Jersey. Over the years, Gerry has di-
rectly participated in developing many South 
Jersey projects including building the Cape 
May County Special Services School, building 
the Gerald M. Thornton Veterans Cemetery, 
and helped to bring a Veterans Clinic to Cape 
May County. After 44 years serving Cape May 
County, he has decided to retire. Gerry should 
be very proud of his lifelong service in South 
Jersey, and it was my honor to have had the 
opportunity to recognize him for all his accom-
plishments. God Bless Gerry, and God Bless

INTRODUCTION OF A BILL TO PER-
MIT COMMERCIAL FILMING AND 
PHOTOGRAPHY 
ON 
THE 
GROUNDS OF THE U.S. CAPITOL 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 4, 2022 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce a bill that would permit commercial 
filming and photography on the grounds of the 
U.S. Capitol Complex, beyond east of Union 
Square, the only area where such filming and 
photography is currently authorized. This bill 
would allow commercial filming and photog-
raphy outside of the Capitol and congressional 
office buildings by permit, so long as neither 
the House nor Senate is in session. In many 
countries, freedom of expression is limited, 
and while the January 6th insurrection was 
one of the greatest threats to American de-
mocracy in history, the Capitol and the United 
States remain beacons of democracy for the 
world. We should encourage commercial film-
ing and photography at the Capitol to share 
this symbol of democracy with the world. Mov-
ies and television shows that involve the Cap-
itol should not have to go to other cities or use 
fake capitol buildings for filming. 
The current policy allowing commercial film-
ing and photography near the U.S. Botanic 
Garden shows that the Capitol Police can han-
dle commercial filming and photography at the 
Capitol Complex, especially when Congress is 
not in session. However, that vantage point 
captures the least familiar view of the Capitol. 
Preventing commercial filmmakers and pho-
tographers from shooting in front of the Capitol 
is neither business-friendly nor true to the na-
tion’s democratic traditions. Encouraging com-
mercial filming and photography at the Capitol 
would help spread the story of our national 
legislature around the world. 
There is no good reason why commercial 
filming and photography should be confined to 
Union Square. Specifically, my bill would give 
the Capitol Police complete discretion to issue 
a permit for commercial filming and photog-
raphy at the Capitol Complex under the same 
terms and conditions as those for commercial 
filming and photography in Union Square. No 
policy or security reasons exist to justify lim-
iting commercial filming and photography at 
the Capitol Complex to only one location, 
Union Square, especially considering that per-
mits are necessary. Visitors are regularly seen 
on East Capitol Street (east of 2nd Street) tak-
ing pictures, where they get a full view of the 
Capitol, demonstrating the arbitrary nature of 
limiting commercial filming and photography to 
Union Square. 
This bill would provide the Capitol Police au-
thority to charge fees to cover any costs in-
curred by the Architect of the Capitol from per-
mit approval. The fees would be deposited 
into the Capitol Trust Account, which was es-
tablished to accept fees collected for commer-
cial filming and photography permits for Union 
Square. Amounts in the Capitol Trust Account 
would be available without fiscal year limitation 
for maintenance, improvements and projects 
the Architect of the Capitol considers appro-
priate, subject to the approval of the Appro-
priations Committees. 
Views of the Capitol are among America’s 
most iconic. Limiting commercial filming and 
photography of the Capitol, an important vehi-
cle for telling the nation’s story, does not serve 
the American people. Indeed, most of the 
world reveres our system of government large-
ly through commercial films and photos of the 
Capitol, a symbol of our democracy at work. 
Commercial films and photographs of the Cap-
itol, the seat of our democracy, are perhaps 
the best modem vehicles for telling the na-
tion’s story and showcasing its democratic 
system of government. Republicans and 
Democrats alike revere the image of the Cap-
itol as a symbol of democracy. My bill would 
enable appropriate, permitted commercial film-
ing and photography of the Capitol, and would 
create economic benefits for the nation, the 
District of Columbia and private businesses. 
I strongly urge my colleagues to support this 
bill.

HONORING BONNIE SUE GRAHAM 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 4, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today along with Congressman 
JARED HUFFMAN, to honor Bonnie Sue Graham 
for her outstanding career at the U.S. Vet-
erans Affairs Department, helping our veterans 
secure the proper care they need and de-
serve. 
Mrs. Graham was born in Boston, Massa-
chusetts, and grew up in the nearby suburb of 
Winthrop, where she attended public school. 
She then graduated from Tufts University, 
where she earned a bachelor’s degree in oc-
cupational therapy. Following her graduation, 
Mrs. Graham spent years in the private sector, 
working at medical centers in Connecticut and 
New Mexico. Eventually, she became the vice 
president of the Lovelace Health System, the 
largest healthcare provider in New Mexico. 
After her service at Lovelace Health Sys-
tem, Mrs. Graham became a senior adminis-
trator at Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Al-
buquerque. In 2007, Mrs. Graham became As-
sociate Director of the U.S. Department of 
Veterans Affairs. Later, in 2013, Mrs. Graham 
became the director of the Veterans Affairs 
Medical Center in San Francisco, where she 
cultivated a culture of support, openness, and 
a commitment to excellence. 
As Director, Mrs. Graham has served on nu-
merous national Veterans Affairs committees 
and mentored several Veterans Affairs execu-
tives and administrators. In 2000, she began a 
trailblazing program to educate Veterans Af-
fairs workers on how to address matters of di-
versity and equity, an effort that has achieved 
widespread recognition today. 
As Mrs. Graham prepares to retire from her 
excellent service at the end of this month, she 
looks forward to spending more time with her 
husband, Glenn, and their son, Garrett. 
Madam Speaker, it is evident that Bonnie 
Sue Graham has spent her life serving and 
supporting our brave service members. There-
fore, it is fitting and proper that we honor her 
here today.

In his retirement, SPC MacMurray is a 
member of the American Legion and a part of 
the American Legion Post 17’s ‘‘Thank a Vet’’ 
program, providing any veteran an opportunity 
to have a cup of coffee and a donut with other 
veterans.

members of our community with intellectual 
and/or developmental disabilities (I/DD) the 
care they deserve. She has gone to great 
lengths to ensure the safety, wellness, and in-
clusion of patients in her care. This not only 
makes her an exceptional DSP but also a 
leader. This recognition is well-deserved, and 
I look forward to hearing about all that she will 
accomplish for our community. 
Madam Speaker, I stand here today to cele-
brate the countless achievements and suc-
cesses of Ms. Isabel Diaz, who has devoted 
her life to providing the highest quality care to 
South Texans with I/DD. For that and much 
more, South Texas will be forever grateful.

HONORING ELIZABETH QUIROZ AS 
WOMAN OF THE YEAR 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 4, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Elizabeth 
Quiroz, whom I have named the 2022 Woman 
of the Year in Sonoma County, California. 
Woman of the Year recognizes women who 
have made important contributions to Califor-
nia’s 5th Congressional District in Arts and 
Culture, Professional Achievement, Entrepre-
neurship and Innovation or Community Serv-
ice. 
Mrs. Quiroz was born in San Francisco, 
California. At a young age, she became a vic-
tim of human trafficking. After escaping traf-
ficking, she pursued an education with the 
hope of learning how to help other victims of 
human trafficking recover and move forward. 
In 2014, Mrs. Quiroz began attending Santa 
Rosa Junior College, where she volunteered 
for the Bear Cub Scholar Program, which pro-
vides academic counseling for foster youth. 
She graduated from Santa Rosa Junior Col-
lege with highest honors in three associate de-
grees: social advocacy, behavioral science 
and human services. In 2021, shegraduated 
from Sonoma State University with a bach-
elor’s degree in sociology with distinction. 
While in school, Mrs. Quiroz worked as a 
substance use disorder counselor and co- 
founded the nonprofit Redemption House of 
The Bay Area, which helps victims of human 
trafficking reclaim their lives. Mrs. Quiroz re-
ceived many awards recognizing her incred-
ible work, including the 2019 American Red 
Cross Humanitarian Hero Award, the 2019 
Achievement and Community Service Award 
from the Sonoma County Lowrider Council, 
and the 2021 Inaugural Spirit of Sonoma 
County Award. She also received the Uncon-
ditional Governor’s Pardon from Governor 
Jerry Brown in 2018. 
Mrs. Quiroz currently serves as a substance 
use disorder counselor at Athena House Resi-
dential Treatment Center for women in Santa 
Rosa, while pursuing a master’s degree in So-
cial Justice and Human Rights from Arizona 
State University. 
Outside of her community work and her 
education, Mrs. Quiroz finds joy in her family, 
including her husband, Jose, their five children 
and one grandson. She is also looking forward 
to publishing her memoir, Purified in the 
Flame, on March 31st of this year. 
Madam Speaker, it is evident that Elizabeth 
Quiroz has devoted her life to helping and 
supporting vulnerable individuals in our com-
munity. Therefore, it is fitting and proper that 
we honor her here today.

CELEBRATING APRIL AS FAITH 
MONTH 
HON. MARY E. MILLER 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 4, 2022 
Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Madam Speaker, 
this April Americans all over the country, led 
by Concerned Women for America, the Na-
tion’s largest public policy organization for 
women, and other faith-based organizations 
are celebrating April as Faith Month. I rise to 
join and commend this noble effort calling all 
people of faith to join in prayer, thanksgiving, 
and celebration of their faith. 
The United States of America was born of 
the unanimous Declaration that we are ‘‘en-
dowed 
by 
[our] 
Creator 
with 
certain 
unalienable Rights,’’ based on ‘‘the Laws of 
Nature and of Nature’s God,’’ ‘‘appealing to 
the Supreme Judge of the world,’’ and ac-
knowledging our ‘‘reliance on the protection of 
divine Providence.’’ We are a people of faith. 
That is why religious freedom is known as 
America’s first freedom, as laid out in the Es-
tablishment and the Free Exercise clauses of 
the First Amendment to the United States 
Constitution. The freedom of speech guaran-
teed by the First Amendment also supports 
America’s unique focus on freedom of expres-
sion, including in matters of faith. 
America’s Judeo-Christian founding pro-
motes religious diversity and tolerance. Our 
motto, ‘‘In God We Trust,’’ further emphasizes 
the importance of faith in our nation’s found-
ing. From our first president to the last, we 
have always acknowledged America’s faith. 
President George Washington recognized ‘‘it 
is the duty of all Nations to acknowledge the 
providence of Almighty God, to obey His will, 
to be grateful for His benefits, and humbly to 
implore His protection and favor; and Presi-
dent Joe Biden, most recently acknowledged 
Thanksgiving as a ‘‘time to reflect on our 
many blessings—from God, this Nation, and 
each other.’’ 
Religious liberty serves to strengthen our 
country’s appreciation of all peoples, regard-
less of faith. But eternal diligence is needed to 
preserve religious freedom. Attacks on reli-
gious liberty and people of faith continue to 
plague our nation with some religious charities 
even being forced to betray the tenets of their 
faith in order to participate in certain govern-
ment programs. We must actively reject all ef-
forts to criminalize or cancel religious beliefs in 
certain controversial areas as somehow in-
compatible with our democracy. 
Religious organizations in America have a 
rich history of charitable engagement helping 
the sick, poor, and afflicted, and they should 
be celebrated, not maligned for their contribu-
tions to our way of life. According to the Pew 
Research Center, more than 75 percent of 
Americans practice some type of religious 
faith. This rich, diverse religious heritage is to 
our credit and should be commended. 
Therefore, I join millions of Americans cele-
brating their personal faiths freely and openly, 
with public displays and celebrations, including 
prayer and expressions of thanksgiving, during 
the month of April, also known as ‘‘Faith 
Month,’’ as a way to reaffirm our commitment 
to the religious liberty principles of our found-
ing.

BRAEDEN DIFRANCEISCO 
HON. JEFFERSON VAN DREW 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 4, 2022 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, this 
month, I had the pleasure of presenting 
Braeden DiFranceisco with his Eagle Scout 
Court of Honor. Braeden is originally from 
Mullica Hill, South Jersey and is currently a 
senior at St. Augustine Prep School in Rich-
land, New Jersey. He started his journey to-
wards becoming an Eagle Scout in 2012 and 
has risen through the ranks from being a Bear 
in the third grade to Eagle his senior year of 
high school. For his Eagle Scout project, 
Braeden installed an orienteering course at 
Grenloch Lake Park in Washington Township. 
The course can be utilized by all Scout troops 
in South Jersey by helping them understand 
navigation and complete rank requirements. 
The orienteering course can also be used as 
a tool to help other scouts earn their 
orienteering merit badge. Braeden should be 
proud of his accomplishments, and it was my 
honor to have had the opportunity to recog-
nize him for his service to the South Jersey 
community. God Bless Braeden, and God 
Bless America.

HONORING POLICE CHIEF MANJIT 
SAPPAL 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 4, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Chief Manjit 
Sappal as he retires from his outstanding, six- 
year service as the Chief of Police for the city 
of Martinez, California. 
Born in the United Kingdom, Chief Sappal 
and his family immigrated to the United States 
in 1981 and settled in the Bay Area, where he 
has lived ever since. In the late 1990s, Chief 
Sappal began his 26–year-long career in law 
enforcement as a police officer in Pittsburg, 
California. Later, he moved to the Richmond 
Police Department, where he worked for 18 
years and became a captain. While working 
as a police officer, Mr. Sappal graduated from 
Golden Gate University with highest honors, 
earning a master’s degree in public adminis-
tration. He also graduated from the prestigious 
FBI National Academy and the Police Execu-
tive Research Forum’s Senior Management In-
stitute for Police. 
Chief Sappal’s rigorous work ethic and im-
pressive credentials propelled him to the office 
of Chief of Police of Martinez in 2015, a posi-
tion from which he retired from on March 17, 
2022. Throughout his career in law enforce-
ment, Chief Sappal has worked in several po-
sitions. From Homicide Investigator to Guns 
and Gang Detective, he has always put him-
self on the line to make his community safer. 
While these experiences were memorable, 
Chief Sappal considers his time as Chief of 
Police, working with an amazing, high-per-
forming team, to be the highlight of his career. 
Chief Sappal’s service extends beyond law 
enforcement. As a member of the Contra 
Costa Council for Homelessness and the Mar-
tinez Rotary and Kiwanis, Chief Sappal has 
worked hard to maintain trust with the commu-
nity and keep the public safe. 
After retirement, Chief Sappal looks forward 
to spending more time with his wife, Tina, and 
their two teenage children, Alexis Lily and An-
drew Tyler. While the people of Martinez will 
miss his excellent police work and leadership, 
the sense of empathy and compassion he es-
tablished in the community will last a lifetime. 
Madam Speaker, it is evident that Chief 
Manjit Sappal has served our community 
through his exceptional career in law enforce-
ment. Therefore, it is fitting and proper that we 
honor him here today.

PAYING TRIBUTE TO THE HONOR-
ABLE DONALD EDWIN YOUNG 
SPEECH OF 
HON. GARRET GRAVES 
OF LOUISIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 29, 2022 
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, 
I include in the RECORD additional tributes 
from staff and friends of the late Rep. Don 
Young. 
MICHAEL SONGER 
DY Senior Legislative Assistant & Defense 
Policy Advisor (2017–2022) 
When it comes to the job, Congressman 
Young was the best there ever was. I remem-
ber we were going to an event on Joint Base 
Elmendorf-Richardson (JBER) and due to a 
miscommunication, there was no memo for 
the Boss. So, there I was, hand writing a 
memo on the hood of a pickup truck, in a 
JBER parking lot. If I am honest, when I fin-
ished the memo, I was quite proud of myself. 
However, because of how good he was at 
doing the job, he didn’t even need to refer to 
the memo. Without looking at that piece of 
paper, he conveyed a hopeful message full of 
jokes, pride, and an eye toward the future. 
His off the cuff remarks to that audience of 
servicemembers were better than anything I 
could have written. 
When you ask anyone who worked for Con-
gressman Young about their time working 
for ‘‘The Boss,’’ they will all have numerous 
stories and experiences they will happily 
share. But one thing they will all say is he 
was the best boss ever. When I came on 
board, little did I know what the office and 
the Boss would come to mean to me. Over 49 
years, Team DY has formed a family that 
has each other’s backs. The Boss took a 
chance on me and allowed me to join this 
family and I will forever be grateful for the 
opportunity. I will miss him greatly. But I 
know that when I look up at the sky and see 
a raven flying, he’s out there, watching over 
his family. 
NAHALI (HOLLY) R. CROFT 
Team DY—Personal Staff (2008–2011) 
A lot has been said in the days since Con-
gressman Young’s passing about how he was 
a tough, gruff fighter for Alaska. I’m grate-
ful to Congressman Garret Graves for allow-
ing me to share a memory that reinforces 
how important his constituents always were. 
When I’d been newly promoted to Legisla-
tive Correspondent—a position in the Young 
office that handled a small portfolio as 
training for taking on bigger issues once pro-
moted to Legislative Assistant—I turned in 
my first memo on legislation in my purview 
being considered on the Floor that day. To 
be honest, I was pretty proud of it. After all, 
I’d read the information on the bill from our 
Whip’s office, and I’d consulted a few con-
servative think tanks for their assessments 
as well. I handed the memo to the Legisla-
tive Director, who approved it, and into the 
Congressman’s office I went, ready to give 
my vote recommendation. I handed Con-
gressman Young a copy of the memo, and he 
listened as I went through the high points. 
Then, he sat back in his chair, crossed his 
arms, and said, ‘‘Okay, Miss Holly, now 
argue it from the other side.’’ 
I must have given a shocked look because 
he chuckled, ‘‘It’s important to know both 
sides. Just because we’re recommended to 
vote a certain way from our leadership 
doesn’t mean that we should.’’ I think I must 
have continued to look surprised, or perhaps 
confused, because I don’t remember respond-
ing before he continued, ‘‘We need to choose 
what’s best for Alaska. That’s not always 
what’s best for the Lower 48. It makes me 
very unpopular at times with my colleagues, 
and that’s okay because I’m not here to rep-
resent them, am I?’’ 
‘‘No,’’ I admitted. At this point, I was 
again directed to consider the Democrats’ ar-
guments on the issue, and on that vote—my 
very first vote recommendation—he voted 
against my original recommendation and 
with the Democrats because it would better 
serve Alaskans. This was a valuable re-
minder that constituents should come before 
party affiliation, and it was something I car-
ried with me well past my time in Congress-
man Young’s office. It also was a good re-
minder that knowing a range of opinions is 
important for making informed decisions. 
I worked for Congressman Young during 
this third decade of service. At his funeral, I 
met some of the staff who were working for 
him at his death. It was good to know that 
nothing had changed since that day back in 
2008. Alaskans were always first with him, 
even until his last day. 
DRUE PEARCE, FORMER ALASKA STATE SENATE 
PRESIDENT 
From our first meeting in 1977 until our 
last, just days before his death, Don Young 
was a mentor and friend for whom I have the 
utmost respect. He was the only Alaska Con-
gressman I’ve ever known and he provided 
sage advice and counsel, peppered with his 
unique exhortations to ‘‘Think Big’’ and 
‘‘Work with everyone to get things done’’, 
sometimes uttered with some salty phrases 
included. Alaska and Alaskans could not 
have asked for a better advocate and more 
forceful singular voice in Congress—working 
for us 24/7/365 with a laser focus on building 
the infrastructure necessary for our future. 
Don Young will forever live in my heart and 
I will forever be a ‘‘Young Woman’’.

interview and I was hired in 1978 as a legisla-
tive assistant. (I used to tell people that 
Alaskans were Alaskans for a reason and 
were typically uninterested in living in 
Washington, unlike folks from some other 
parts of the country.) I had some Hill experi-
ence but this was my first full-time job. I 
was put to work on a lot of interesting 
issues, such as ‘‘Is a hovercraft REALLY a 
‘‘vessel’’ for the purposes of the Jones Act? Is 
there something we can do to make them 
more available in the Bush?’’ 
Don was sympathetic to the Air Line Pi-
lots Association, an AFL-CIO union that was 
on strike against the then-dominant intra- 
state carrier Wien Air Alaska over the issue 
of whether there should be a third pilot in a 
Boeing 737. This issue was critical to the 
union as a whole and the Wien pilots were 
getting significant strike pay from the 
union, but it was really costing the mem-
bers. Because the rest of the employees of 
the airline were organized by the (then-non- 
AFL-CIO) Teamsters who did not respect the 
pilots’ picket lines, the airline had broken 
the strike and it was unclear how it could be 
settled. President Carter refused to inter-
vene under the Railway Labor Act (yes, air-
lines are ‘‘railways’’). Don had me work on a 
‘‘little amendment’’ to the Airline Deregula-
tion Act that **required** the President to 
set up a board to try to settle it—because, we 
explained, ‘‘Alaska was different.’’ It had 
nothing to do with airline deregulation, of 
course, but Don made things happen. The 
amendment was enacted, a Presidential 
Emergency Board was appointed, and even-
tually the pilots went back to work. (Unfor-
tunately for the union, the 3-pilot rule 
ended.) 
Aside from Don’s many kindnesses to me 
both when I was working and as we encoun-
tered one another through my own long ca-
reer on the Hill, what truly set him apart 
was his devotion to his family. I had been ex-
posed to a fair number of members and the 
Hill culture, and I knew that many members 
either enjoyed (or felt that they had to at-
tend) the many receptions and dinners that 
were available to them. They could be enter-
taining and politically helpful. They were 
not for Don. 
The minute he possibly could, he was out 
of the office and on his way to his place in 
Virginia to be with his family. His values 
and his priorities were obviously in the right 
place. He was devoted to his family in a 
truly exemplary way, as we have heard in 
the tributes that have been paid to him over 
the years and since his passing. That was the 
real Don Young. 
BOB HERRON 
State Staffer, Station Bethel Delegation Of-
fice 
If Don gave you his word, even if it proved 
painful in the future, his word was gold. A 
few quotes from Don Young: 
‘‘If I tell you the sky is blue, it’s blue, and 
if the sun is up, it’s up, and there is no in-be-
tween.’’ 
‘‘Some other members of Congress put 
their fingers up to see which way the wind is 
blowing.’’ 
CONGRESSIONAL SPORTSMEN’S FOUNDATION 
‘‘On behalf of the Board of Directors and 
staff of the Congressional Sportsmen’s Foun-
dation (CSF), we mourn the passing of Con-
gressman Don Young; a lifelong outdoors-
man and tireless champion for hunting and 
angling. Representative Young was a found-
er, past Chairman and active Member of the 
bipartisan Congressional Sportsmen’s Cau-
cus, and was a conservation giant, whose leg-
acy will benefit future generations of Ameri-
cans. Our thoughts and prayers are with fam-
ily and friends, and the halls of Congress will 
miss his larger than life personality,’’ said 
CSF President & CEO Jeff Crane.

INTRODUCTION OF THE SERVICE 
ACADEMIES 
DISTRICT 
OF 
CO-
LUMBIA EQUALITY ACT 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 4, 2022 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise to in-
troduce the Service Academies District of Co-
lumbia Equality Act, which would give the Dis-
trict of Columbia the same number of appoint-
ments and nominations to the U.S. service 
academies as states. Currently, each Member 
of the House and each senator is allocated 
five appointments to each service academy— 
the U.S. Military Academy, the U.S. Naval 
Academy and the U.S. Air Force Academy— 
and each Member of the House and each 
senator is allowed 10 nominations for each 
appointment. Therefore, since D.C. has no 
senators, D.C. is deprived of 10 appointments 
and, assuming all appointments are vacant, 
100 nominations to each service academy. 
This bill would provide equality for D.C. resi-
dents who choose to serve their country by 
applying to a service academy. It is remark-
able that D.C. residents volunteer to serve a 
country that denies them statehood, congres-
sional voting rights and full home rule. District 
residents have fought in every American war, 
and our residents, who pay all federal taxes, 
including paying more federal taxes per capita 
than the residents of any state, deserve to 
have the same opportunity to attend our pres-
tigious service academies as residents of the 
states. 
The District’s population (690,000) is larger 
than that of two states and is in line with the 
six states that have a population under one 
million. D.C. servicemembers have helped se-
cure voting rights for people throughout the 
world, yet have always been denied those 
same rights when they returned home. District 
residents deserve equality at the service acad-
emies. 
I urge my colleagues to support this impor-
tant bill.

HONORING TINA WONG AS WOMAN 
OF THE YEAR 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 4, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Tina Wong, 
whom I have named the 2022 Woman of the 
Year in Contra Costa County, California. 
Woman of the Year recognizes women who 
have made important contributions to Califor-
nia’s 5th Congressional District in Arts and 
Culture, Professional Achievement, Entrepre-
neurship and Innovation or Community Serv-
ice. 
Ms. Wong was born in San Francisco, Cali-
fornia, to Darlene Roth and Marvin Wong. She 
graduated from the University of California, 
Davis with a bachelor’s degree in English and 
earned two teaching credentials for Single 
Subject Teaching in English and Multiple Sub-
ject Teaching Credential. 
Ms. Wong began working in the Elk Grove 
Unified School District at the Union House El-
ementary School in 1993. Then, in 1995, she 
began teaching in public schools in Martinez, 
California, including Martinez Junior High 
School. The year after, she became the As-
sistant to the Upper Head of School and Aca-
demic Dean at The Athenian School. During 
her time at The Athenian School, Ms. Wong 
volunteered to mentor students in areas of so-
cial justice, equity and diversity as a board 
member of the Bay Area People of Color in 
Independent Schools, an organization that 
represents people of color in the Bay Area 
education system. 
Additionally, Ms. Wong volunteers with orga-
nizations that aim to empower and support

provides learning and leadership opportunities 
for students, educators, and community part-
ners in areas of science, nature, and ecologi-
cal literacy.

for her passion for learning, communication 
skills, planning expertise, and commitment to 
collaboration. She has been married to Robert 
DiBetta for over 20 years, and they have two 
children, Sam and Kate. 
Madam Speaker, it is evident that Tina 
Wong has dedicated her life to educating and 
supporting the students in our district. There-
fore, it is fitting and proper that we honor her 
here today.

HONORING THE LIFE OF ARTIE 
WALKER 
HON. JERRY McNERNEY 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 4, 2022 
Mr. MCNERNEY. Madam Speaker, I ask my 
colleagues to join me in honoring the life of 
Artie Walker. 
Artie Walker was born in Stallo, Mississippi, 
on April 3, 1930 and moved to Stockton in 
1948 after graduating from high school. In 
1957, Artie was the first African-American 
woman to be hired by the San Joaquin County 
Sheriff’s Office. During her 25-year career in 
law enforcement she worked in several capac-
ities including in the patrol section, in court 
services and the youth services section of the 
detective division, and at the men’s and wom-
en’s jails. She was instrumental in imple-
menting rehabilitation programs at the wom-
en’s jail and began a project in the Sherriff’s 
Department to make Christmas gifts available 
for residents of Children’s Home of Stockton. 
Artie was an advocate for women’s rights 
and was honored by the local chapter of the 
National Organization for Women with the 
‘‘Diana Award’’ for her contributions to helping 
women gain equality. Artie also showed devo-
tion to her community through her service at 
Christ Temple Church of Stockton. She served 
as Secretary of the Crist Temple Church of 
Stockton’s Board of Directors and as an Asso-
ciate Minister. Her dedication, enthusiasm, 
spirit, and commitment to others is inspiring. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring 
the memory of Artie Walker and her lifetime of 
service.

MILITARY VEHICLE FLEET 
ELECTRIFICATION ACT 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 4, 2022 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, today I 
introduce the ‘‘Military Vehicle Fleet Electrifica-
tion Act.’’ Among other things, this trans-
formative legislation would require the U.S. 
Department of Defense (DOD) to replace its 
fleet of nontactical vehicles with at least 75 
percent electric or zero-emission vehicles. 
The DOD remains the single largest institu-
tional consumer of petroleum in the world. As 
chairman 
of 
the 
Armed 
Services 
Sub-
committee on Readiness, I am deeply com-
mitted to getting the American military to do its 
part to combat the climate crisis by reducing 
fossil fuel use and transitioning our nation to 
a clean energy economy. As the Pentagon 
turns over its fleet of nontactical vehicles, it 
only makes sense that those replacements be 
electric or zero-emission vehicles to the great-
est extent practicable. 
According to the General Services Adminis-
tration (GSA), the DOD currently has more 
than 174,000 nontactical vehicles across the 
service branches, including the Coast Guard, 
and the various defense agencies. That is the 
second largest share of the overall federal ve-
hicle fleet, after the U.S. Postal Service at 
more than 225,000 vehicles. In December 
2021, the Biden Administration published its 
Federal Sustainability Plan, indicating that the 
DOD is responsible for 56 percent of the fed-
eral government’s overall greenhouse gas 
emissions. 
My legislation would apply to all future non- 
tactical vehicles, such as passenger cars, 
vans, or light-duty trucks, purchased or leased 
for the military. It would not apply to vehicles 
used in combat or warzones like Humvees. 
My legislation includes the strongest possible 
‘‘Buy American’’ requirements, ensuring that 
electric vehicle components like batteries are 
not sourced from hostile foreign countries like 
the People’s Republic of China or Russian 
Federation. Importantly, my legislation would 
apply to both direct procurement by the DOD 
itself and any non-tactical vehicles for which 
the GSA acts as the procurement or leasing 
agent on behalf of the service branches or de-
fense agencies. 
As a nation and within our military, we have 
a responsibility to make thoughtful purchases 
with taxpayer funds to combat the climate cri-
sis. Transitioning the military’s enormous fleet 
of passenger cars, light-duty trucks, and vans 
with internal combustion engines to American- 
made electric and zero-emission vehicles is a 
commonsense way to further reduce our na-
tion’s greenhouse gas emissions. I plan to 
make this critical legislation a top priority in 
the Readiness mark of the forthcoming Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all Members of the 
House to join me in cosponsoring the ‘‘Military 
Vehicle Fleet Electrification Act.’’

HONORING JENNIFER STRONG AS 
WOMAN OF THE YEAR 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 4, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Jennifer Strong, 
whom I have named the 2022 Woman of the 
Year in Lake County, California. Woman of the 
Year recognizes women who have made im-
portant contributions to California’s 5th Con-
gressional District in Arts and Culture, Profes-
sional Achievement, Entrepreneurship and In-
novation or Community Service. 
Jennifer Strong was born in Davis, Cali-
fornia, and is a sixth-generation Lake County 
resident. She graduated from California State 
University, Chico in 1993 with a bachelor’s de-
gree in agricultural business. Ms. Strong start-
ed her career as a branch manager for Tri 
Counties Bank. She quickly developed a pas-
sion for helping her customers feel com-
fortable with their finances. In 1998, she ex-
panded this passion and founded Strong Fi-
nancial Network as a Certified Financial Plan-
ner. Her firm is built upon the principle of ho-
listic financial planning with a focus on helping 
her clients maneuver through all aspects of 
life. Ms. Strong provides hours of free financial 
planning to all ages, including young people, 
regardless of the size of their assets. She is 
often found at a career day event at a local 
school and meeting individually with young 
people about the importance of a healthy rela-
tionship with money. Additionally, she has 
hosted countless student interns in her office 
over the years. 
Ms. Strong is also a member and supporter 
of many non-profit organization in Lake Coun-
ty. She donates countless hours of service to 
local non-profits in financial planning, as well 
as providing MC services for annual charity 
fundraisers. Ms. Strong is a long-time member 
of the Lakeport Rotary Club. She is known for 
her 15-year service as Ride Director for the 
annual cycling event, Konocti Challenge, 
bringing in millions of dollars in economic ben-
efit to Lake County. She also founded the Ro-
tary Fire Relief Fund, which was established 
during the Valley Fire in 2015, and raised over 
$1 million that year. All of the fund was used 
to support fire survivors. 
Ms. Strong’s passion for her community is 
described by loved ones as ‘‘infectious and al-
ways at the forefront of her decisions.’’ She is 
known for her dedicated passion in helping 
others believe in their own ability to effect 
change in the world. Outside of her career and 
community work, Ms. Strong is passionate 
about outdoor activities, such as scuba diving, 
gardening, travelling, and is also a licensed 
private pilot. 
Madam Speaker, it is evident that Jennifer 
Strong has dedicated her life to the people of 
Lake County through her career in financial 
services and her community work. Therefore, 
it is fitting and proper that we honor her here 
today.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 4, 2022 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, I recently 
had the pleasure of attending Pat Witt’s 95th 
birthday celebration in Vineland, South Jersey. 
As a lifelong native of Millville, Pat has played 
an integral role in encouraging the apprecia-
tion and participation of the fine arts through-
out the South Jersey community. Pat’s artistic 
talents have been honored through private 
and public collections across the globe. The 
Barn Studio of Art, founded by Pat in 1962, is 
one of her largest accomplishments. Through-
out the years, The Barn has been a hub for 
the New Jersey Art community. Through Pat’s 
work at the Barn Studio, she has taught and 
inspired thousands of students with her enthu-
siasm for the arts. Pat should be proud of her 
hard work and dedication, which has truly 
touched the lives of many, and it was an

HONORING BETTY RHODES AS 
WOMAN OF THE YEAR 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 4, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Betty Rhodes, 
whom I have named the 2022 Woman of the 
Year in Napa County, California. Woman of 
the Year recognizes women who have made 
important contributions to California’s 5th Con-
gressional District in Arts and Culture, Profes-
sional Achievement, Entrepreneurship and In-
novation or Community Service. 
Mrs. Rhodes was born in Taft, California, in 
1927. She graduated from Fairfax High School 
in Los Angeles and then attended Los Ange-
les City College and Ventura Junior College. 
She married her husband, Tom, in 1950, and 
they moved to Ventura County. The couple re-
located to Napa in the 1980s to be closer to 
one of their daughters Judy. 
After Tom Rhodes passed away in 1990, 
Mrs. Rhodes became greatly involved in the 
Napa County community, joining the Napa 
County Commission on Aging, where she has 
served for 15 years. She used her experience 
with the agency to spearhead the Napa Coun-
ty Caregiver Ordinance, which requires inde-
pendent caregivers and home care aides to 
complete a background check and register 
through the state. The Ordinance, which was 
adopted by the Napa County Board of Super-
visors, is nicknamed ‘‘Betty’s Law’’ in honor of 
her tireless, seven-year advocacy for the Ordi-
nance. 
Additionally, Mrs. Rhodes has been a voice 
for seniors by serving on the Napa County 
Paratransit Coordinating Council, Napa and 
Solano Area Agency on Aging, and Molly’s 
Angels Board of Directors. She also writes a 
weekly column for the Napa Valley Register 
about issues that are important to seniors. 
As a member of the California Senior Lead-
ership Alliance, Mrs. Rhodes has advocated 
for seniors at the state level by meeting with 
State Senators and Assembly Members to dis-
cuss matters that affect seniors. In 2008, the 
Napa Valley Chamber of Commerce named 
Mrs. Rhodes the Community Booster of the 
Year, honoring her distinguished record of 
leadership. 
Mrs. Rhodes has four children, Greg, 
Susan, Steven, and Judy, seven grand-
children, twelve greatgrandchildren and one 
great-great grandchild. 
Madam Speaker, it is evident that Betty 
Rhodes has dedicated her life to advocating 
for the senior citizens of Napa County. There-
fore, it is fitting and proper that we honor her 
here today.

SUPPORTING JUSTICE CLARENCE 
THOMAS 
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 4, 2022 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise to ad-
dress the efforts to unfairly attack one of the 
best Supreme Court Justices in our history— 
Justice Clarence Thomas. 
Democrats in Congress have engaged in a 
smear campaign against this most distin-
guished jurist. And why? Because they are 
upset that his wife texted the President’s Chief 
of Staff. The attack on this great Justice is not 
based on any decision he made. It is not 
based on anything he said or did. Rather, he 
is being held to account for his wife’s expres-
sion of free speech. 
Let me be clear, Ginni Thomas, the Jus-
tice’s wife, has every right to share her polit-
ical views and express her views. Merely be-
cause her husband is a judicial officer does 
not mean she loses all of her constitutional 
rights. 
The real reason radical Democrats want 
Justice Thomas to be impeached, or to ‘‘re-
sign’’ or to recuse himself from cases unnec-
essarily, is because they don’t like his close 
adherence to the Constitution. Justice Thom-
as’ legal decisions read like poetry. He clearly 
and easily eviscerates strange constitutional 
interpretations by the Leftists on the Court. He 
forcefully and unabashedly explains true Con-
stitutional law and sticks to the document as 
it was intended. This makes him a threat to 
the Left. 
The Democrats in Congress belittle and be-
smirch the impeachment process. It is now in-
voked against their political enemies with as 
much thought as what they want for lunch. 
They cry ‘‘impeachment’’ in unison against all 
of their political enemies, like a socialist collec-
tive. The hive mind of the Left seeks destruc-
tion of the Constitution and it hates, with preju-
dice aforethought, those who believe in the 
Constitution as a fixed star in the constellation 
guiding our nation instead of the loopy ‘‘it’s a 
living document so it means whatever I say it 
means.’’ 
I stand with Justice Thomas and his wife. 
Stay strong for the sake of America. America 
needs his voice on the Court, and he should 
not let the vitriolic, shrill, and hysterical Left 
wing mob in Congress deter him from his right 
to free speech for Ginni and his duty to our 
Constitution. 
SENATE COMMITTEE MEETINGS 
Title IV of Senate Resolution 4,
