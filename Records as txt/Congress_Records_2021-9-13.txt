BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
first, I want to welcome back all of my 
colleagues from the August work pe-
riod. As we return to Washington, as 
everyone knows, the Senate has a very 
busy schedule ahead of it. 
On the nominations front, we will 
begin this week by holding a cloture 
vote on James Kvaal to be the Under 
Secretary of Education. Tomorrow, we 
will move the nominations of David 
Estudillo to be district judge of the 
Western District of Washington, Angel 
Kelly to serve as district judge for the 
District of Massachusetts, and the Sen-
ate will also begin consideration of 
Veronica Rossman to be the circuit 
judge for the Tenth Circuit. 
On the legislative front, the Senate 
will pick up exactly where we left off 
last month. We will continue our fight 
to preserve voting rights for millions of 
Americans, and, of course, we will con-
tinue 
working 
to 
pass 
President 
Biden’s Build Back Better agenda and 
set our country on a path to prosperity 
for decades to come. 
At the end of last work period, the 
Senate took two important steps to 
achieving that goal. First, we passed 
the bipartisan $1 trillion infrastructure 
bill that will make historic invest-
ments in our Nation’s physical infra-
structure. 
Second, Senate Democrats came to-
gether to pass a budget resolution with 
reconciliation instructions that will 
clear the way to pass a reconciliation 
bill with historic and transformative 
investments in American jobs, Amer-
ican families, and the fight against cli-
mate change. 
Over the August State work period, I 
remained in constant communication 
with the chairs of the Senate’s relevant 
committees, as well as with the Speak-
er and the White House, including the 
President. I am pleased to say we have 
made substantial progress in trans-
lating provisions of the budget resolu-
tion into policies we can pass into law. 
As we continue our work over the 
next few weeks, I want to take a step 
back and explain why this legislation 
is so important.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6440 
September 13, 2021 
For far too long, millions of Amer-
ican families have worried that the 
American dream has increasingly fall-
en out of reach. Too many in the mid-
dle class are just struggling to stay 
there. Too many who are trying to get 
to the middle class find the ladder up 
steeper and steeper. 
Today, the cost of raising a family, 
saving for college and retirement, get-
ting a good-paying job and affording 
healthcare have become very, very 
hard. As a result, that sunny American 
optimism, so key to our national iden-
tity, has been replaced by a growing 
sourness and divisiveness in the land. 
We have to do better, and we will do 
better. 
With this legislation, we have a once- 
in-a-generation opportunity to rebuild 
our economy and rekindle faith in 
America’s future. It will include the 
largest tax cut for the middle class in 
a generation. It will include provisions 
that are both critically important and 
overwhelmingly 
popular 
with 
the 
American people, from strengthening 
childcare and education to making 
healthcare more affordable for mil-
lions. And, crucially, it will include un-
precedented steps to fight the climate 
crisis and preserve our planet for the 
next generation. 
After yet another summer marked by 
hurricanes, floods, and wildfires, we 
cannot hold off on taking action any 
longer. The world is looking to us for 
leadership 
on 
climate 
change. 
By 
achieving the emissions goals Demo-
crats are laying out, we can reassert 
America’s leadership. 
And through it all, we are going to 
make sure that this bill is paid for and 
that those at the very top finally pay 
their fair share. 
When this Senate majority began its 
work many months ago, our original 
task was to pass legislation that would 
get our country out of the depths of the 
COVID pandemic. Now, the legislation 
we will work on over the next 2 weeks 
will lay a new foundation for the future 
of our economy. It will restore the mid-
dle class in the 21st century and give 
many more Americans the opportunity 
to get there. Building ladders to middle 
class—that is what this is about, and 
that is what we are going to do. 
The next few weeks will be crucial to 
achieving this goal, and I look forward 
to working with my colleagues to con-
tinue to deliver on our promise of big, 
bold change for the American people. 
Of course, even as we work to deliver 
on our Build Back Better agenda, the 
House and Senate will also work on 
other important priorities that demand 
immediate attention, including passing 
a continuing resolution before the Sep-
tember 30 expiration of government 
funding, providing emergency funding 
to help those devastated by recent nat-
ural disasters, and helping resettle our 
Afghan allies and partners. I expect all 
of this to be done in a bipartisan and 
timely way. 
Of course, over the next few weeks, 
the House and Senate must also come 
together to address the debt ceiling. In 
America, when it is time to pay the 
bills, we follow through on our obliga-
tions, without exception. For a long 
time, addressing the debt ceiling was 
considered a routine and responsible 
step that both sides worked together to 
achieve. Even when President Trump 
was in office, Democrats worked three 
times with Republicans to suspend the 
debt ceiling because it was the right 
and obvious thing to do. We didn’t pick 
excuses and say: Here is why we don’t 
want to do it. We knew it was impor-
tant and it was time to lay aside dif-
ferences and move it forward. 
But now, unfortunately, some of our 
Republican 
colleagues—even 
though 
they were eager to have Democrats 
support them when President Trump 
was President—now some of our Repub-
lican colleagues are reportedly contem-
plating a reckless idea, spearheaded by 
the Republican Senator from Wis-
consin, to oppose any effort to raise 
the debt ceiling whatsoever. And, un-
fortunately and sadly, the Republican 
leader seems to be going along. 
Let me be clear: taking the debt hos-
tage and playing games with the full 
faith and credit of the United States is 
reckless, irresponsible, and will harm 
every single American. It is a complete 
nonstarter. 
This is not just another political de-
bate. It is about honoring our unbroken 
commitment to pay our debts and 
avoid another financial crisis at a cru-
cial moment for our country. 
Now it is important to remember 
that this is not about green-lighting 
future spending. This is about paying 
debt from past spending, which was in-
curred during the Trump administra-
tion and which received favorable votes 
from the majority of Republicans and 
Democrats. 
Indeed, it is a new study that came 
out. According to the nonpartisan Con-
gressional 
Research 
Service, 
the 
Trump administration incurred $5.4 
trillion in new debt after the debt ceil-
ing was raised in 2019, up through his 
last day of office. So all of the new $5 
trillion in debt, bottom line, was 
caused under the Trump administra-
tion, not by Democratic spending— 
under the Trump administration, $5.4 
trillion from the last day the debt ceil-
ing was raised in 2019 to the last day of 
Trump being in office. 
Another report by the Treasury De-
partment further states that, over the 
entirety of the Trump administration, 
that figure rose to as high as $8 tril-
lion. 
Again, let me repeat this so my Re-
publican colleagues hear it loud and 
clear. This is not about the Democrats 
incurring debt. Between the last time 
that the debt ceiling was raised in 2019 
and the final day of the Trump admin-
istration—nothing to do with Biden or 
Democrats or anything in 2021—his ad-
ministration added more than $5 tril-
lion to the national debt; and over the 
4 years of Donald Trump, new debt to-
taled as much as $8 trillion. 
So both sides—both sides—have a re-
sponsibility to pay our bills. Both 
sides, led by the Republican Senate, in-
curred much of this new debt. Senators 
from both parties voted overwhelm-
ingly in support of the many laws that 
contributed to this obligation. 
In the middle of the COVID pan-
demic, the Congress came together 
under Donald Trump, when Donald 
Trump was President, to pass succes-
sive COVID relief laws, like the CARES 
Act, the PPP extension, and the ‘‘908 
COVID deal’’ in December. Democrats 
and Republicans voted in huge numbers 
in support of these laws. Republicans 
voted to make these expenditures. 
Now we must come together to do 
the responsible thing and pay those 
bills. Leader MCCONNELL assured the 
country in 2019, when Donald Trump 
was President, that we would ‘‘no 
doubt [raise the debt ceiling] on a bi-
partisan basis.’’ Again, that is what 
McConnell said when Trump was Presi-
dent: We will ‘‘no doubt [raise the debt 
ceiling] on a bipartisan basis.’’ He said, 
when Trump was President, failure to 
do so would be a ‘‘disaster.’’ 
Failure to do so now, Leader MCCON-
NELL, is an equal disaster. It doesn’t 
matter who is President. We still in-
curred the bills. So I believe it should 
be no different this time around. 
The United States has never, ever, 
defaulted on its debt. I can’t imagine 
Republicans would want to be respon-
sible for the first-ever default. We need 
to work together to raise the debt ceil-
ing and avoid causing irreparable harm 
to our economy, still recovering from 
the devastation of the pandemic. 
I would say to the business commu-
nity and the financial community, let 
Leader MCCONNELL know, stop playing 
games with the debt ceiling. 
f 
VOTING RIGHTS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
now on one final issue, on voting. Be-
fore the Senate concluded the previous 
work period, Republicans blocked mul-
tiple efforts to even debate voting 
rights legislation in the U.S. Senate. 
Let me be clear: Republicans refusing 
to support anything on voting rights is 
not an excuse for Democrats to do 
nothing. 
Over the recess, a number of my col-
leagues and I, including Senators KLO-
BUCHAR, MERKLEY, WARNOCK, MANCHIN, 
PADILLA, KAINE, KING, and TESTER, 
worked diligently to craft a revised 
voting rights piece of legislation. 
This compromise proposal would pro-
tect the freedom to vote, end partisan 
gerrymandering, stop the scourge of 
dark money in our politics, among 
many other good things. 
I applaud my colleagues for their 
hard work and their progress to come 
together with a very strong voting 
rights bill that all Democrats can sup-
port, while respecting the role of 
States and promoting greater con-
fidence in our democracy. 
Now Senator MANCHIN has been hav-
ing discussions with our Republican

colleagues to try and garner support 
for this important legislation. This is a 
good proposal and I encourage all my 
Senate colleagues to support it. 
That said, we must be honest about 
the facts. The Republican-led war on 
democracy has only worsened in the 
last few weeks. Most notably, the Gov-
ernor of Texas recently signed into law 
a vile new voter suppression bill that 
ranks as one of the most draconian and 
undemocratic in living memory. Mean-
while, partisans across the country are 
sharpening their knives for a coming 
spate of vicious gerrymandering, which 
further threatens to divide our politics. 
This is unacceptable. So the Senate 
much must act. I intend to hold a vote 
in the Senate as early as next week on 
voting rights legislation. Time—time— 
is of the essence. 
I yield the floor.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY 
LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican leader is recog-
nized. 
f 
AFGHANISTAN 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
over the State work period, as Sen-
ators attended business back home, the 
Biden administration’s reckless deci-
sion to retreat from Afghanistan was 
carried through to a damaging and 
deadly end. 
The consequences of its hasty retreat 
were not just foreseeable; they were ac-
tually foreseen. And yet, against the 
advice of Members from both parties 
and even its own national security ex-
perts, the administration plowed right 
ahead. 
Just weeks after abandoning our 
strategic airbase in the dead of night, 
the Biden administration told Ameri-
cans and vulnerable Afghan partners 
they were largely on their own to make 
it to the commercial airport in Kabul if 
they wanted out of Afghanistan. 
And by the White House’s own admis-
sion, some of the Americans who want-
ed to come home were left behind. So 
let’s let that sink in. President Biden 
left Americans who wanted to escape 
behind, in the clutches of the Taliban. 
Of course, Americans aren’t the only 
people we left behind. In order to meet 
an arbitrary political deadline, the 
Biden administration also pulled out 
before we helped all the brave Afghans 
who stuck their necks out to assist 
American servicemembers and build a 
better future for their country. 
Our Nation made a promise of aid 
and safety in exchange for their serv-
ice; and on this President’s watch, we 
actually failed to keep the promise. We 
left Americans and vulnerable Afghans 
behind. 
The administration naively expected 
the Taliban to behave like any law- 
abiding member of the so-called inter-
national community, supposedly sub-
ject to tremendous leverage for rec-
ognition and for funding. 
Well, our adversaries are sending em-
issaries to the Taliban, and the terror-
ists in Kabul seem unconcerned with 
diplomacy. Trust in the Taliban to en-
sure safe passage to the airport for 
evacuees was fatally misplaced. Any-
one who expected the group to become 
‘‘inclusive’’ should now rightly expect 
to literally be laughed out of the room. 
The administration confidently in-
sisted it would own the consequences of 
its withdrawal efforts; but as soon as 
their lack of planning bore real, deadly 
consequences, it pointed the blame at 
everyone but the reflection in the mir-
ror. 
Now, in a bizarre twist of narcissism, 
the White House is now holding up its 
belated and frantic evacuations as wor-
thy of praise and credit. 
So where are we now? 
A wall outside the compound that, 
until recently, housed the U.S. Em-
bassy in Kabul now bears a mural of 
the Taliban flag. Four terrorists once 
detained at Guantanamo Bay now hold 
senior positions in the Taliban regime. 
And in the void left by our coalition’s 
withdrawal, we are less able to collect 
intelligence and fight terrorists on 
their own soil. 
This failure was entirely avoidable; 
the consequences were totally foresee-
able; and the stain on our retreat has 
left America more endangered, less 
credible, and with fewer capabilities in 
the face of real and growing terrorist 
threats. 
f 
THE ECONOMY 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
on another matter, the international 
stage isn’t the only area where the 
Biden administration’s policies have 
caused damage that was both foresee-
able and foreseen. 
Back in the springtime, Washington 
Democrats dumped trillions of dollars 
in liberal borrowing and spending onto 
the American people. They pretended it 
was a COVID relief bill. What it was, 
was a recipe for rampant inflation, a si-
lent tax hike on American families. 
It was clear what would happen. Even 
liberal economists warned this was a 
bad idea that would cause inflation. 
But just like in Afghanistan, Demo-
crats had made up their minds long ago 
and were certainly not going to be de-
terred. 
Now working Americans are paying 
the price. Annual inflation is up 5.4 
percent, tied for the worst inflation in 
over a decade. It has more than 
swamped 
American 
workers’ 
wage 
gains over the last year. The Demo-
crats’ inflation is turning American 
workers’ pay raises into effective pay 
cuts, essentially pick-pocketing Amer-
ican families. 
You might think this would give our 
Democratic friends some pause and en-
courage them to deal in reality; but, 
alas, that is not what is happening. In-
stead, they are eager to jam through 
yet another massive multitrillion-dol-
lar reckless taxing-and-spending spree 
in an effort to move our country to the 
left, literally, forever. 
Massive new government intrusion 
into 
Americans’ 
childcare 
arrange-
ments, into Americans’ medical pre-
scriptions, into the power grid; new 
welfare spending that hands out cash 
with zero—zero—work requirements; 
socialist price setting that would leave 
our medical system with fewer new 
cures; and a thousand more awful, far- 
left policies just like these, all accom-
panied by a suite of staggering—lit-
erally 
staggering—tax 
hikes 
that 
would kill jobs, hurt families, and 
crush our competitiveness with the 
Chinese. 
Details are already emerging about 
the seismic tax hikes that Democrats 
are cooking up: more higher taxes on 
employers and job creators, targeted 
tax hikes to hit small businesses and 
family farms, pulling more Americans 
into the death tax. 
This tax-hiking wish list would add 
up to one of the biggest tax hikes in 
American history at exactly the time 
their liberal policies already have our 
economy sputtering. So it is the very 
last thing American workers need. It is 
the last thing American families can 
afford, and Republicans are going to 
fight these terrible, painful policies 
tooth and nail.

Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I 
rise to speak to 9/11, the 20th anniver-
sary, but before that, I would like to 
address some of the remarks made by 
the minority leader just a few mo-
ments ago. 
He discussed, in the context of the 
Biden Presidency, what he called a 
‘‘reckless decision to retreat from Af-
ghanistan with an arbitrary deadline.’’ 
What the Senator failed to include was 
the efforts made last year, before Joe 
Biden was elected President, by the 
previous President, Republican Donald 
Trump, through his Secretary of State, 
Pompeo, in direct negotiation with the 
Taliban, to establish the deadlines for 
the evacuation of Afghanistan. The 
idea didn’t come with the new Presi-
dent, Joe Biden; the idea started under

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6442 
September 13, 2021 
the 
previous 
Republican 
President, 
Donald Trump, who sent our Secretary 
of State to directly negotiate with the 
Taliban leaders. 
One of the things that they nego-
tiated, incidentally—I want to make a 
record of it—was the release of 5,000 
prisoners by the Afghan Government 
the Taliban wanted released, and Presi-
dent Trump negotiated their release. 
Now, the Republican leader in the 
Senate comes and notes the fact that 
four Guantanamo prisoners are now in 
positions of power in the Taliban ad-
ministration. Well, of course, that 
speaks for itself. But honesty would re-
quire us to note the fact that they were 
among the very same Taliban team 
President Trump negotiated with last 
year and now have positions of author-
ity. There is no blame for President 
Biden in that score. 
To say that we were naive toward the 
Taliban is to ignore the obvious. Presi-
dent Trump negotiated an agreement 
with them. If we would hold to a dead-
line for leaving Afghanistan, they 
would make certain that American 
forces were spared attacks during that 
period of time. That was part of the 
conversation. That was part of the ne-
gotiation. That in and of itself was a 
positive thing, but it also held us to a 
deadline to keep our troops safe. 
The notion of working with and nego-
tiating with the Taliban started with 
President Trump and Secretary of 
State Pompeo under the President. 
As to whether the situation in the 
evacuation was entirely avoidable, I 
am not certain there was a playbook 
left by President Trump when he left 
office as to how he would have handled 
that evacuation. 
I will say this for President Biden: I 
believe, as he did, that it was time for 
this war to come to an end. There were 
2,461 American body bags—American 
lives lost in the war in Afghanistan. 
More than 20,000 of our troops were se-
riously injured during the course of 
that war. There was $2 trillion spent in 
20 years on a war that seemed like it 
would never end. And we spent most of 
that money in an effort to build up an 
Afghan security force that would take 
care of itself so America could come 
home. And what happened? As soon as 
the United States said there would be 
an end to this, sadly, many of these Af-
ghan soldiers—uniformed, paid for, and 
equipped by the U.S. taxpayers—threw 
their guns down and surrendered, and 
then, of course, the administration of 
the Government in Afghanistan left 
the scene completely. 
So I am one who voted for the inva-
sion of Afghanistan for obvious rea-
sons. That is where Osama bin Laden 
was supposedly hiding out with al- 
Qaida, responsible for the 9/11 atrocity, 
which we have noted the 20th anniver-
sary of this week. But I don’t believe 
anyone on the floor in this Senate en-
visioned a war that would go on to be 
the longest war in American history. 
That is what happened. 
The second issue raised by the Re-
publican leader notes that the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan was a recipe for infla-
tion, and he called it a ‘‘tax hike upon 
working families.’’ Let’s clear up that 
record. 
The American Rescue Plan was sug-
gested by President Biden. The goals of 
that plan were several. The goals in-
cluded 
the 
administration 
of 
coronavirus vaccines across America, 
which has taken place in one of the 
most effective efforts ever to make it 
available. I am sorry that some 30 per-
cent of Americans refuse to be vac-
cinated, but it has nothing to do with 
the availability of the vaccine. Presi-
dent Biden kept his word to bring that 
vaccine to the American people, and 
that was part of the American Rescue 
Plan. I don’t know if the Senator from 
Kentucky is questioning the wisdom of 
that, but it is a fact. 
The second thing it did was to pro-
vide a $1,400 payment, if you will re-
member, that had been promised by 
President Trump, and we completed 
and kept that promise with the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan, so dollar assistance 
for families across America, including 
working families, let me add. And also 
then came the child tax credits. It was 
the most extraordinary effort made by 
our government to help families rais-
ing children—cash payments through 
the end of this year. To argue that this 
is somehow a tax on working families 
is to ignore the fact that it is the big-
gest tax break in the history of this 
country for working families. 
How many Republicans supported us 
for the $1,400 cash payment to families, 
for the plan to administer the vaccine 
across America, for the help for fami-
lies with children, for more assistance 
for businesses? Not one. Not one Re-
publican vote in support of the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan. 
To hear the theory that was given 
just a few moments ago by the Repub-
lican leader is to ignore the obvious: 
That plan was essential to this country 
coming to grips with this pandemic and 
starting to get this economy back on 
its feet. 
The Senator from Kentucky has 
characterized our reconciliation bill as 
reckless, and he talks about the mas-
sive tax increases. He forgets one par-
ticular element. What we are doing is 
reversing the tax breaks given by the 
Trump administration 4 years ago to 
the wealthiest people in America. Yes, 
their taxes will go up. But President 
Biden has made it clear that there will 
be no tax increases for anyone making 
less than $400,000 a year. So if we are 
talking about a new tax burden, it is 
on people who can certainly afford to 
pay, and it reverses the tax cut which 
many of the Republicans—I think vir-
tually all of them—at the time voted 
for. 
SEPTEMBER 11 
Madam President, I want to tell you 
about an extraordinary person from my 
State. Dan Shanower grew up in 
Naperville, just outside of Chicago— 
one of five kids in his family. In col-
lege, he spent a semester at Wash-
ington, DC, as part of American Uni-
versity’s Washington Semester Pro-
gram. He managed to become an intern 
here on Capitol Hill for U.S. Senator 
Charles Percy from Illinois. 
An opportunity like that can change 
your outlook on life. I know it changed 
mine when I was an intern for Senator 
Paul 
Douglas. 
It 
changed 
Dan 
Shanower’s mind, and he started think-
ing about what he could do by way of 
public service. 
He wasn’t interested in politics, 
though. So after college, he enlisted in 
the Navy. He became an intelligence 
officer. He served in the Persian Gulf 
war and in assignments around the 
globe. 
On September 11, 2001, Dan Shanower 
was on duty at the Pentagon. He was 
hurriedly gathering papers to brief his 
superiors on the attack on the World 
Trade Center, when American Flight 77 
crashed into the Pentagon and took his 
life. 
Navy CDR Dan Shanower was one of 
125 servicemembers and civilians who 
lost their lives in the Pentagon on 9/11; 
one of the 2,977 Americans lost to the 
terrorist attacks that fatal day. He was 
40 years old. Two years later, the peo-
ple of Naperville, IL, dedicated a me-
morial to his honor on the Riverwalk, 
on the banks of the DuPage River. It 
was one of America’s first 9/11 memo-
rials. This past Saturday, the victims 
and heroes of 9/11 were remembered at 
the memorial in Naperville. 
Twenty years after the attacks, the 
remembrances of that year seem to 
contain a new kind of sadness, not only 
for those who perished—rest their 
souls—but for all we have lost in the 
years since. Amid our shock and grief 
following 9/11, Americans were sus-
tained by acts of heroism, sacrifice, 
compassion, and a deep sense of na-
tional unity. 
I watch ‘‘60 Minutes’’ every week. 
Last night, I saw the program that 
they dedicated to the New York Fire 
Department and 9/11. It was touching, 
emotional, and heartbreaking. I had 
tears in my eyes as they told the sto-
ries of the 343 firemen who went into 
those buildings to rescue the people 
who were there. They told their stories 
even with their voices from radio 
transmissions and the voices of those 
victims in the building praying that 
someone would rescue them. It was a 
touching moment and a reminder of 
what true courage looks like. 
We have a responsibility now to ask 
a basic question about our responsi-
bility when it comes to the people in 
this country. Do you remember the na-
tional unity that we felt after 9/11? 
That tragedy brought us together. 
Imagine then—fast-forward, if you will, 
to January 6, 2021, when the insurrec-
tionist mob overran this Capitol. 
I was in this Capitol on 9/11, meeting 
just off the floor. We heard that the 
first plane had crashed into the World 
Trade Center, and we went and turned 
on the television to see if there was 
any further news and saw in real time

the second plane crash into the other 
tower. 
Then a third plane flew into the Pen-
tagon, taking CDR Dan Shanower’s 
life. We only knew from the black, bil-
lowing smoke across the Mall that 
something terrible had happened, and 
we didn’t know what was next. Some-
one came in and said: We are evacu-
ating the building. 
Everybody went pouring out on the 
east side of the Capitol in front of the 
Supreme Court building. 
Tourists came up to me and said: You 
work here? 
I said: Sure. 
Where are we supposed to go? Where 
is it safe? 
I didn’t know what to tell them. 
There was no Capitol Visitor Center or 
anyplace. I directed them to the train 
station, the Metro station blocks away. 
In the days that followed 9/11, we 
learned about the heroes of Flight 93. 
While we were standing on that lawn, 
thank goodness those passengers stood 
up and made a difference. They sac-
rificed their lives to stop that plane 
from crashing into the Capitol or the 
White House or whatever its final des-
tination might have been. 
Lynn Sweet of the Chicago Sun- 
Times did a special column, ‘‘Remem-
bering 9–11’’ and particularly Todd 
Beamer. Todd Beamer was a Wheaton 
College grad who was a passenger on 
Flight 93. He managed to get in touch, 
using an Airfone, with Lisa Jefferson, 
and they spoke for about 15 minutes as 
Todd described what was going on in 
that airplane, and she told him what 
had happened at the Trade Center and 
the Pentagon. It was Todd Beamer who 
made 
that 
memorable 
statement 
‘‘Let’s roll’’ when they tried to take 
over the plane and gave up their lives 
in the process. Those were the true he-
roes. 
It is heartbreaking that 20 years 
later, the gravest threat to America is 
not just the international terrorism 
but some terrorism that comes from 
within. Al-Qaida did not succeed in at-
tacking this Capitol, but 9 months ago, 
homegrown American terrorists did. 
As we speak, workers are preparing 
to reinstall a security fence around the 
Capitol to protect it from another 
gathering of violent White nationalists 
expected in Washington this weekend. 
Former President George W. Bush 
spoke for many of us on Saturday when 
he said that the terrorists of 9/11 and 
the violent extremists at home may 
come from different cultures—these 
are his words: ‘‘But in their disdain for 
pluralism, in their disregard for human 
life, in their determination to defile 
national symbols, they are children of 
the same foul spirit, and it is our duty 
to confront them.’’ 
We have work of great importance 
before us. In the next few weeks, the 
Congress needs to find a plan to fund 
the government, protect our economy, 
protect the full faith and credit of the 
United States, make sure we pay our 
bills on time as promised. And isn’t it 
ironic that there is resistance to in-
creasing the debt ceiling from the Re-
publican side of the aisle when the in-
crease in the debt ceiling is to pay for 
the debts incurred under President 
Donald Trump? It is his administration 
we are paying for with this vote. And 
the Republicans, many of whom sup-
ported him and continue to, don’t want 
to balance the books and accept that 
responsibility. 
AFGHANISTAN 
Madam President, on a different mat-
ter, I will just close by saying that the 
Afghanistan situation should be put in 
the context of 13 brave Americans who 
lost their lives during that evacuation, 
but the fact of the matter is that 
124,000 people, including 80,000 Afghans 
and 6,000 Americans, were airlifted to 
safety. They and the brave service-
members and diplomats involved in the 
evacuation deserve our thanks and re-
spect. 
The missteps in Afghanistan began 
long ago. The U.S. first began peace 
talks with the Taliban more than a 
decade ago. Last year’s Doha agree-
ment was negotiated by the Trump ad-
ministration. H.R. McMaster, Donald 
Trump’s second National Security Ad-
visor, recently called the deal ‘‘a sur-
render agreement with the Taliban.’’ 
That is what Joe Biden inherited when 
he became President. And when it 
came time to face that responsibility, 
that is exactly what he said: I accept 
the responsibility for my decision. 
What a contrast with the previous 
President who accepted responsibility 
for nothing. This President said: I will 
make the decision. I will stand by it. It 
was time for America to end our long-
est war. It is time now for us to try to 
find a way to bring this Nation back 
together. 
I yield the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Alabama. 
SEPTEMBER 11 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Madam Presi-
dent, 20 years ago, September 11, 2001, 
Americans watched in horror as two 
planes struck the World Trade Center 
in New York City. We watched as an-
other plane slammed into the Pen-
tagon, and yet another bound for this 
very city crashed in Pennsylvania. 
That day was the worst attack on 
American soil in our history. Amer-
ica’s death toll surpassed Pearl Harbor 
in December 1941. That day, children 
came home from school without their 
parents; calls from family members 
went unreturned; lives were changed 
forever. 
Yet instead of tearing us apart, in-
stead of frightening Americans off the 
world stage, the cowardly attacks on 
September 11 brought our Nation to-
gether. 
But just remember, we were at war 
with al-Qaida prior to 9/11/2001. In the 
1990s, between 10,000 and 20,000 people 
went to Afghanistan to train to be ter-
rorists. Insurgencies sprang to life in 
Algeria, Indonesia, Philippines, Soma-
lia, and Yemen. 
The World Trade Center was bombed 
the first time in 1993 by Ramzi Yousef, 
who spent time in a terrorist camp in 
Afghanistan. In 1998, al-Qaida bombed 
two U.S. Embassies in Africa. In 2000, 
al-Qaida bombed a U.S. warship, the 
U.S.S. Cole, killing 17 Americans. 
The 9/11 Commission would later 
write: ‘‘The 9/11 attacks were a shock, 
but they should not have come as a 
surprise.’’ That came from the Com-
mission. But they were a surprise to 
most Americans because our leaders 
simply ignored the threat, issued a 
weak diplomatic scold, and promised 
‘‘over the horizon’’ missiles and sur-
veillance could solve the problem. 
What solved the problem was Amer-
ican resolve and American might. That 
fighting spirit began on the bright blue 
morning of September 11, when a 32- 
year-old 
software 
salesman 
named 
Todd Beamer boarded United Airlines 
Flight 93. 
Todd knew his plane was likely 
bound for another mishap or catas-
trophe after hearing it on the tele-
phone just after takeoff. He knew that 
this plane was either headed for the 
Capitol or the White House. He knew 
what happened to the other flights be-
cause of conversations. But instead of 
being fearful, Todd Beamer rallied his 
other passengers. 
The former college athlete stayed 
calm and prayed the Lord’s Prayer. 
Then he and his fellow passengers un-
leashed hell on the hijackers of their 
plane. The moment Todd Beamer said 
‘‘Let’s roll’’ is the moment America 
began to fight back against radical Is-
lamic terrorism. That is when the war 
started. 
The whole country took up Todd’s 
battle cry of ‘‘Let’s roll.’’ Over the 
next 20 years, 800,000 Americans rolled 
into 
Afghanistan—800,000. 
Of 
them, 
2,461 were killed in action, including 
the 13 brave men and women we just 
lost a few weeks ago; 20,961 soldiers 
were wounded. 
Their sacrifices were great, but so 
were their accomplishments. With 48 
partnered nations, America smashed 
the Taliban and sent al-Qaida running 
for their caves in Pakistan. We killed 
Osama bin Laden and crushed ter-
rorism networks around the world. 
Over the past 20 years, the death toll 
from 
terrorists 
inside 
the 
United 
States was 107 because of our brave 
military that took the fight to the 
enemy overseas. One hundred 
and 
seven souls are still far too many in 
this country. But the Nation has been 
spared another catastrophic attack, 
while our All-Volunteer Force stood 
the watch in Afghanistan. 
But here on the 20th anniversary of 9/ 
11, what should be a resounding victory 
and success of American values and re-
solve is, instead, a defeat. And it is an 
especially bitter defeat to Americans 
all across this country. It is bitter be-
cause Americans surrendered 20 years 
of blood, sweat, and tears to the 
enemy. 
The Taliban now controls more of Af-
ghanistan than they did in 2001, and

they are better armed with American 
guns, vehicles, and aircraft. 
It is bitter because it was entirely 
preventable. It is bitter because those 
who work in national security know in 
their hearts that the President is 
wrong when he says the ‘‘war is over.’’ 
Mr. President, the war is not over. 
The war is over when your enemy ac-
cepts defeat. Our enemy, the Taliban, 
are not defeated; they are emboldened. 
President Biden has handed them the 
greatest victory of their pitiful, pitiful 
history, a victory greater than they 
could have ever dreamed. 
Using this victory as propaganda 
against the United States will be re-
cruiting gold for the Taliban. Make no 
mistake, now that they have sent 
America running for the exits in Af-
ghanistan, they intend to bring the ter-
ror we saw at Kabul’s airport home to 
us right here in the United States of 
America. 
We cannot allow that to happen be-
cause now, after our Commander in 
Chief decided to leave behind—let me 
repeat that—leave behind American 
taxpayer-funded 
equipment, 
the 
Taliban is one of the top 10 best 
equipped militaries in the world. 
Over 44,000 military vehicles were left 
behind, nearly a half a million guns 
left behind, 33 Black Hawk helicopters 
left behind. All are now in the hands of 
our enemy. And we are fooling our-
selves if we think they are not going to 
use this equipment against us. 
Early last week, 10 of my colleagues 
on the Senate Armed Services Com-
mittee joined me in calling for hear-
ings on the Biden administration’s cha-
otic withdrawal from Afghanistan. 
As members of the committee that 
overseas our Nation’s Armed Forces, 
we bear a particular responsibility to 
seek—I mean seek—true and correct 
answers. We asked to hear from the 
Secretary of Defense, Lloyd Austin; the 
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 
General Milley; the commander of U.S. 
Central Command, General McKenzie; 
and the last commander of U.S. Forces 
in Afghanistan, General Miller. 
These are our top military leaders 
who need to be asked the hard ques-
tions, and that is what I and my col-
leagues intend to do, starting with why 
did we give up the most strategic air 
base in the middle of Asia, Bagram Air-
field? Why did we do that? It makes no 
sense. 
We owe it to our Nation, those who 
served, their families, and our allies to 
preserve the records of how our time in 
Afghanistan ended. For every people 
we and members of the Armed Services 
Committee represent here in Congress, 
this is the biggest issue facing our 
military since Vietnam. Those who 
have given so much to this cause are 
demoralized and disheartened. I have 
talked to hundreds of them in the last 
couple of weeks. 
Al-Qaida didn’t defeat our military. 
The Taliban didn’t defeat our military. 
The complexities of rebuilding a coun-
try did not beat our military. This ad-
ministration in Washington, DC, de-
feated our troops. 
Never in American history have we 
seen a Commander in Chief leave 
Americans behind enemy lines. It is 
unheard of, unheard of in the history of 
this country. I cannot think of a single 
fighting man or woman who would 
leave an American behind. It does not 
make sense. That is why they fight. 
That is why our military fight. We do 
not leave people behind. But they were 
ordered to leave by our Commander in 
Chief. 
To those soldiers, sailors, marines, 
airmen, guardsmen who served in Af-
ghanistan, I promise you this: We will 
get answers from this administration. 
If you are a member of the military 
or you have served our Nation and you 
have questions, I hope you will reach 
out to my office. I am ready to be your 
voice. I am ready to fight with you for 
your answers and accountability. I 
want to thank Chairman REED
and 
Ranking Member INHOFE for scheduling 
hearings so that we can do just that in 
the next few weeks. 
On 
September 
11, 
America 
said: 
‘‘Never forget.’’ Thousands upon thou-
sands of Americans have taken that 
rally cry to the enemy. To them I say: 
America has not forgotten. We will 
never forget. We will answer the fight, 
and we will fight for these answers. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
DUCKWORTH). The clerk will call the 
roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
HONORING LANCE CORPORAL RYLEE MCCOLLUM 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
come to the floor today to pay tribute 
to the life and service of LCpl Rylee 
McCollum. He was from Bondurant, 
WY. 
On Thursday, August 26, the United 
States lost 13 men and women in uni-
form: 11 marines, an Army soldier, and 
a Navy corpsman. They were killed by 
a terrorist attack in Kabul, Afghani-
stan. At least 20 additional marines 
were wounded. It was the deadliest day 
for our Nation’s military in more than 
a decade. 
One of those fallen heroes was LCpl 
Rylee McCollum. He was just 20 years 
old. 
Rylee 
McCollum’s 
life 
dem-
onstrated the best of our Nation. His 
dad Jim told me that Rylee was full- 
blooded red, white, and blue—and from 
the very beginning. 
Rylee’s dad Jim wanted to serve in 
the military, but he couldn’t because of 
a medical issue. Well, his son Rylee 
grew up with that same great desire to 
serve our Nation. Rylee’s family said 
he wanted to be a marine from the very 
beginning. His sister Royce said that 
he ran around in his diapers and cow-
boy boots with his rifle. 
He 
attended 
Jackson 
Hole 
High 
School. He graduated from Summit In-
novations High School in Wyoming. 
And he made a real name for himself 
all around the State as a champion 
wrestler. 
Now, he had the kind of talents and 
abilities with which he could have done 
anything and everything. He wanted to 
serve America. He joined the Marines 
literally as soon as he could. He signed 
up on his 18th birthday. His plan was to 
serve in uniform and then come home 
to Wyoming. His goal was to teach his-
tory and coach wrestling. 
On August 26, on his first deploy-
ment, he stood guard at the Hamid 
Karzai Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan. 
He protected the airport as Americans 
and our allies escaped to safety. His 
mission saved thousands of lives. While 
Rylee was protecting others, he was 
killed by a terrorist bomb. 
Now, Rylee had just been married in 
February. His wife Gigi was expecting 
their first child, and he was excited to 
become a father. His child will never 
know Rylee. Yet his child will always 
know that Rylee McCollum, her father, 
was a hero. 
On Friday, I stood side by side with 
Rylee’s family and his pregnant wife 
Gigi at the airport in Jackson, WY, as 
Rylee’s flag-draped casket was brought 
home for his very last trip to Wyo-
ming. And today I got a text from Gigi 
with this magnificent picture. The text 
came within the last hour or so, and we 
were able to do a blowup of the text 
picture: Naval Hospital, Camp Pen-
dleton, WY, welcomes baby girl Levi 
Rylee Rose, 8 pounds, 10 ounces, Sep-
tember 13—today—at 2 a.m. There is 
the baby, and there is the cutout of her 
father, Rylee McCollum. 
Madam President, people in Wyo-
ming and all across America have 
shown their love and respect and appre-
ciation and admiration for Rylee and 
his family. People have already do-
nated close to a million dollars to help 
Gigi and the baby. They donated these 
funds through a GoFundMe page on the 
internet, and it is a testament to the 
gratitude of the American people for 
the life and service of Rylee McCollum. 
After Rylee’s passing, a family friend 
in Jackson named Regi Stone told a 
story on Facebook. The story is about 
a conversation he once had with Rylee 
and with Regi’s son Eli. Eli also serves 
in uniform. Regi says Eli and Rylee 
once said: If anything ever happened to 
us, just know we were doing what we 
loved. 
What Rylee McCollum loved was pro-
tecting others. What Rylee McCollum 
loved was service. What Rylee McCol-
lum loved was America. 
And as Jim McCollum told me, he 
said: Rylee is standing guard tonight 
at the gates of Heaven. 
Madam President, Rylee McCollum is 
an American hero. His name will al-
ways be held in honor throughout Wyo-
ming. For the half-million people of 
our State, we all think of Rylee and 
Gigi and now the baby as part of our 
family. 
May God comfort his family, and 
may God continue to bless this great

country for which Rylee McCollum 
gave his life. 
AFGHANISTAN 
Madam President, now I want to talk 
about the fall of Afghanistan. It is the 
thing that people in Wyoming want to 
talk about. They want to talk about 
Rylee, and they want to talk about 
what happened in Afghanistan. 
Over the last 20 years, nearly 2,500 
Americans gave their lives in Afghani-
stan. Our mission in Afghanistan was 
twofold: first, to kill the terrorists who 
attacked us on 9/11/2001, and, second, to 
take away the safe haven where terror-
ists planned attacks on America. 
For the last 20 years, both missions 
were a success. Yet, in a matter of just 
weeks, everything changed, and they 
changed because of the complete in-
competence of President Joe Biden. Be-
cause 
of 
that 
incompetence, 
the 
Taliban are stronger today than they 
were 20 years ago. They are stronger 
than ever. Afghanistan is now a safe 
haven for terrorists, and America is 
more at risk to terrorists today than it 
has been in two decades. 
Afghanistan fell because President 
Biden paid exclusive attention to the 
calendar on the wall instead of the con-
ditions on the ground. Joe Biden set an 
arbitrary political deadline of August 
31. 
The President wanted symbolism for 
September 11. Well, he got symbolism, 
but it wasn’t what he wanted. It was 
the kind of symbolism that terrorists 
wanted. 
Now, in April, when President Biden 
announced his deadline, I warned this 
would happen. I said, if we pulled out, 
the Taliban would take over. Leader 
MCCONNELL and other Senate Repub-
licans came and warned the President 
as well. Some of the top generals in our 
military warned the President also. 
Yet President Biden stubbornly refused 
to listen. He refused to listen to his 
military and refused to listen to his na-
tional security advisers. 
Our enemies knew we were leaving, 
and so they were on the offense. In a 
matter of weeks, Afghanistan fell to 
the Taliban. It was predictable, and it 
was preventable. 
When Kabul fell, President Biden was 
on vacation. So were the Secretary of 
State and the White House Press Sec-
retary. When British Prime Minister 
Boris Johnson tried to reach President 
Biden, he had to wait 36 hours. When 
the Canadian Prime Minister wanted to 
discuss Afghanistan, he couldn’t get 
through to President Biden, but he got 
through to Hillary Clinton. The White 
House was asleep at the switch, and the 
White House switchboard was turned 
off to our closest allies. 
Even after Kabul fell, President 
Biden stuck with his reckless and dan-
gerous deadline, and as a result, Presi-
dent Biden has abandoned hundreds of 
Americans behind enemy lines. Many 
are still trapped there right now. I 
can’t imagine any other President in 
the history of our country doing that, 
abandoning Americans behind enemy 
lines. 
He also abandoned thousands of Af-
ghan people who have helped us over 
the years. They helped our troops. 
That even includes an interpreter who 
helped save the President’s life when 
he visited Afghanistan as a Senator. 
Many of these people are going to be 
killed by terrorists. President Biden 
signed their death warrants. 
This is worse than Benghazi. This is 
worse than the Iranian hostage crisis. 
This is worse than the withdrawal from 
Vietnam. To me, this is America’s 
worst national humiliation in more 
than 50 years. Simply stated, the fall of 
Afghanistan is a dereliction of duty—a 
dereliction of duty—by the Commander 
in Chief. 
Joe Biden ran for President on two 
things. One, he raced on competence, 
and on foreign policy expertise. He has 
failed this entire Nation on both. 
Nearly every prediction that Presi-
dent Biden made about Afghanistan 
has proven to be wrong. 
On July 8, President Biden said there 
would be ‘‘no circumstance’’—no cir-
cumstance—‘‘where you [would] see 
people being lifted off the roof of the 
embassy of the United States from Af-
ghanistan.’’ Just 5 weeks later, that is 
exactly the video of what the world 
saw. 
President Biden claimed al-Qaida is 
gone from Afghanistan. Just hours 
later, the Pentagon had to admit that 
what the President said was not true. 
The President had lied to the American 
people. ISIS fighters are also in Af-
ghanistan. They are the ones who 
killed the 13 servicemembers. Russians 
and Iranians are also in Afghanistan. 
The President’s hasty withdrawal 
left behind billions of dollars’ worth of 
American weapons. Now it is all prop-
erty of the terrorists. Joe Biden armed 
the terrorists beyond their wildest 
dreams. In total, the Taliban has seized 
more than 600,000 American weapons; 
2,000 
armored 
vehicles—humvees, 
American tanks; and 40 aircraft, in-
cluding Black Hawk helicopters. Be-
cause of the incompetence of President 
Biden, the Taliban is now the best 
armed terrorist group in history. Presi-
dent Biden surrendered to the terror-
ists, and now the terrorists will be 
coming for us. 
I join with my fellow Republicans in 
demanding a full accounting of Amer-
ican military equipment in Afghani-
stan. President Biden has absolutely no 
plan to either get the weapons back or 
to destroy them where they are. In-
stead, President Biden is making ex-
cuses. He claims he had to follow Presi-
dent Trump’s withdrawal agreement. 
Well, that is not true, and we know it. 
President Trump’s plan was condi-
tioned on successful peace talks with 
the Afghan Government. Those talks 
are still unsuccessful. 
President Biden has overturned doz-
ens of policies from the previous ad-
ministration. Let’s look at a few of the 
Trump policies that President Biden 
reversed. 
Well, he reversed the very successful 
‘‘Remain in Mexico’’ policy, which has 
resulted in a complete collapse of our 
border security. He tried to bring back 
the Iran deal. He put us back in the 
Paris accord. He rejoined the World 
Health Organization. So why didn’t, 
then, President Biden either enforce 
the 
original 
withdrawal 
agreement 
from Afghanistan or renegotiate that 
agreement? He never even tried. 
President Biden even chose to give up 
Bagram Air Force Base, north of 
Kabul. It is a strategic military loca-
tion that military leaders will tell you 
should never have been abandoned 
under any circumstances. It is prob-
ably the only facility big enough to get 
every American out quickly. We left 
there in the middle of the night with-
out even telling our allies on the 
ground. The U.S. Senate must inves-
tigate why the President ordered the 
military to abandon it. 
The United States, I believe, has a 
sacred duty to finish the job of safely 
evacuating every American civilian in 
Afghanistan. 
The President said on national tele-
vision just a few weeks before the col-
lapse that he would not leave Afghani-
stan and would not follow the directive 
that he had placed, the August 31 dead-
line, until every American was out. 
Yet, on August 30, he had every Amer-
ican servicemember out, and his own 
Secretary of State said there were still 
up to 200 American citizens trapped be-
hind enemy lines. I believe we also 
have to evacuate the Afghans who 
risked their lives by providing us with 
assistance. 
I believe the United States must 
never recognize the Taliban as a legiti-
mate government. The Biden adminis-
tration claimed they would not recog-
nize any government which came to 
power by force in Afghanistan. I find it 
very hard to trust anything that Presi-
dent Biden says anymore. 
Let me conclude with a word about 
our heroes who served our country in 
Afghanistan. Over my time in the Sen-
ate, I visited Afghanistan nine times. 
Each time I go, it is to say ‘‘thank 
you’’ to the men and women in uniform 
who are there. I visit with Wyoming 
National Guard. I visit with Wyoming 
regular military. Our National Guard, 
our Cowboy Cannoneers, have been de-
ployed to Bagram Air Force Base, and 
I visited with them numerous times 
over a number of years. To them and to 
all Americans, I say, no matter how 
disgraceful this withdrawal, no matter 
how incompetent our Commander in 
Chief, no matter the failures of this ad-
ministration, the truth remains: Our 
soldiers served with honor, they fought 
with valor, and they have kept us safe 
and free for the last 20 years. They are 
all heroes. We will always—always— 
hold them in high honor. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maine. 
Mr. KING. Madam President, I have 
comments today about an extraor-
dinary member of the Federal work-
force, but before I do, I would like to

S6446 
September 13, 2021 
respond to a few of the comments that 
I heard as I entered the Chamber with 
regard to Afghanistan. 
The first is, nobody I know of in any 
way is denigrating the service of the 
men and women who served in Afghani-
stan for 20 years. They served honor-
ably. They served well. They served 
bravely. They made great sacrifices, 
and some of them made the ultimate 
sacrifice. There is no dispute about 
that. But I think the question of the 
leaving of Afghanistan is worth a little 
bit of a broader discussion than what 
we just heard. 
No. 1, the decision to leave Afghani-
stan was made by the Trump adminis-
tration. Then-President Trump entered 
into an agreement in February of 2020 
with the Taliban that we would leave 
by May 1 of 2021; all troops would be 
gone. I have read the agreement. In re-
turn, the Taliban said that they would 
not attack our troops. They also said 
they would enter into discussions with 
the Government of Afghanistan and try 
to effect a peaceful transfer of power. 
Of course, that didn’t happen. 
But I think it is very important for 
the American people to realize that the 
fundamental decision to leave Afghani-
stan was made almost a year before 
Joe Biden entered the Presidency. 
When Joe Biden entered the Presi-
dency, he had a decision to make, and 
the decision was a very straightforward 
and very profound one. It was whether 
to honor the agreement that his prede-
cessor had made and keep the word of 
the United States or whether to stay in 
Afghanistan, tear up that agreement, 
subject our people there to attacks by 
the Taliban, and then almost inevi-
tably reescalate the conflict. 
We were down—at the time of the 
agreement in February of 2020, there 
were something like 15,000 American 
troops. By the time President Biden 
came into office, there were only 2,500 
American troops. If he had decided to 
stay, it wasn’t a question of, we will 
just stay with our 2,500 troops; we 
would have been at war with the 
Taliban, and we would have inevi-
tably—he, the President, Biden, would 
have inevitably been in a situation to 
increase our presence in Afghanistan 
once again after 20 years. 
President Biden decided that our 
mission there was complete. The origi-
nal mission, of course, was about 
Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida. And he 
decided that the American people were 
not prepared to commit to a war that 
essentially had no end. So that is point 
one. 
Point two: There is no question that 
the leaving was chaotic and difficult 
and dangerous, but I think it is impor-
tant to understand some of the sur-
rounding circumstances. For example, 
I was one who stood on this floor in 
June and berated the administration 
for not moving aggressively enough to 
get those who helped our troops out. 
The Presiding Officer, I think, took 
that position. Many of us took that po-
sition. We were hammering the admin-
istration. But then the President met 
with President Ghani on June 25 in per-
son, and Ghani specifically said: Please 
don’t start that evacuation in a major 
way because that in itself will lead to 
the collapse of our government; it will 
lead to a loss of confidence. So please 
don’t do that. 
So then the question became, when, 
if we withdrew our troops, would the 
Afghan Government fail? And we are 
going to be having hearings here this 
week, next week, the week after, to 
discuss that very question: What was 
the intelligence? I am a member of the 
Select Committee on Intelligence, and 
I can’t talk about what I learned from 
the intelligence officials leading up to 
August of 2021. But the question is, Did 
the administration expect the Afghan 
Government to fall in a matter of 
days—8 days, I believe? I think clearly 
they did not. Should they? Was it a 
failure of intelligence? I don’t believe 
so. 
Intelligence is about data. It is about 
how many troops, how many guns? 
Who has the arms? Who holds what ter-
ritory? The most difficult intelligence 
questions are psychological: Will the 
Afghan Army fight? Will they have the 
will to fight? Indeed, the Afghan secu-
rity forces have fought for years and 
lost thousands. But when President 
Ghani fled the country, the govern-
ment simply collapsed, and the Afghan 
security forces essentially said: Why 
should we fight if the government has 
gone? 
I have heard it said that we left—I 
think my colleague from Wyoming said 
we left over 200 Americans or 150 
trapped. A hundred or so have left in 
the last few days, left on a charter 
flight a couple of days ago. Yes, it is 
more difficult for them to get out, but 
the administration is working to get 
them out. The question is, Should the 
administration have stayed and trig-
gered a possible conflict with the 
Taliban and attacks by terrorists, 
which did occur at the gate of the air-
port, versus the evacuation of every-
one? And it was very difficult to deter-
mine, A, who these people were, and B, 
whether or not some of them wanted to 
leave. They were dual citizens. So that 
was a difficult decision. 
My understanding is that the mili-
tary advice to the President was that 
it was in America’s interest to abide by 
the August 31 deadline and continue to 
work diplomatically to enable Amer-
ican citizens to leave. In fact, my un-
derstanding from public reports is the 
Taliban has essentially said: If you are 
an American citizen, if you have the 
paperwork, we will let you leave. So 
those people weren’t trapped. 
What bothers me about this con-
versation is the ignoring of the fact 
that 124,000 people were evacuated in 18 
days, the largest airlift in history— 
124,000 people, including about 6,000 
Americans, people from NATO, our 
NATO allies, and thousands of Afghans 
who were those people who assisted us. 
Did we get them all out? I doubt it. 
But I can remember, as I am sure the 
Presiding Officer can, earlier this year, 
we were talking about 18,000 of those 
SIVs. We got out 124,000 people. It was 
a 
logistical—it 
was 
an 
incredible 
logistical and diplomatic achievement. 
There are plenty of questions left. 
There are questions to be answered. My 
problem is concluding that it was a dis-
aster, concluding that the President 
did it all wrong, concluding and reach-
ing conclusions without the facts. Let’s 
have our hearings. Let’s find out what 
actually happened. What was the intel-
ligence? What did the administration 
know? What was the basis of the mili-
tary advice to leave on August 31? 
But also, part of the facts is what 
was achieved: 124,000 people who are 
now being housed and fed and vetted 
and treated for, examined for medical 
conditions. It is an amazing logistical 
achievement. 
If you are talking about the armed 
services, let’s talk about ready, aim, 
fire, not ready, fire, aim. Let’s hold our 
fire until we understand what actually 
happened. I believe that is what we 
should do in this country responsibly 
rather than immediately going on the 
offensive and declaring the President 
incompetent and a disaster and should 
resign and all of those things. 
We ought to understand what actu-
ally happened, and we will. That is our 
role. We should work through the proc-
ess of gaining the facts before we draw 
the conclusions that I have heard 
drawn over the last week. 
TRIBUTE TO TIM HUDSON 
Madam President, let me change the 
subject. We have, throughout the Fed-
eral 
Government, 
wonderful 
people 
working for us. We have people work-
ing in all the Agencies. They work dili-
gently; they work for many years; they 
work under difficult conditions; and 
they serve the American people. We 
speak of ourselves as public servants, 
but there are also public servants who 
are out there every day answering 
phone calls, doing the work of the gov-
ernment in whatever Agency, wherever 
they are, and they are doing important 
work. 
I want to talk about one of them 
today just for a couple of minutes, a 
guy named Tim Hudson. Tim’s mus-
tache is a lot better than mine. Tim 
Hudson is retiring this week after 54 
years with the National Park Service— 
54 years with the National Park Serv-
ice. That is dedication to the public 
service. He has served in Alaska. He 
has served at Yellowstone. He came 
East after Superstorm Sandy to super-
vise the reconstruction and mainte-
nance of national parks in the East. He 
is an expert on maintenance, on keep-
ing these places up to speed, up to 
snuff, so that our citizens can enjoy 
them. 
He came out of retirement or he 
slowed his retirement to do his last 5 
years in the State of Maine. President 
Obama created Katahdin Woods and 
Waters National Monument, a spectac-
ular spot in the middle of the North 
Woods of Maine. It was somewhat con-
troversial at the time. I spent days up

there in public meetings and took a lot 
of flak and listened to a lot of contrary 
opinions, some much positive, some 
negative. 
When he created the national monu-
ment, the question was, OK, who is 
going to get it going? Who is going to 
make it happen? And Tim Hudson an-
swered the call. He spent the last 5 
years up there working with the local 
community. 
He 
has 
done 
a 
huge 
amount of work with the local commu-
nity to give them confidence in what 
the Park Service is doing. He has 
worked with the people, the Friends of 
Katahdin Woods and Waters. He has 
worked with the people who are help-
ing to develop this wonderful facility 
for more and more people every year. I 
think this year, the visitation will be 
35, 40, or 55,000 people. It is a spectac-
ular spot. 
Tim Hudson started from scratch. I 
just want to recognize Tim and the 
thousands like him throughout this 
country who work on our behalf quiet-
ly every day without a Senator making 
a speech about them, but they go about 
their work on behalf of the American 
people. I just didn’t want Tim Hudson’s 
retirement to go unremarked because 
not only does he deserve recognition, 
so many of his colleagues, whether it is 
in the Park Service, the Department of 
Agricultural, the Department of De-
fense, the Department of Commerce, 
the Internal Revenue Service, all the 
people who work on behalf of this coun-
try, the brave men and women in the 
Department of State who work around 
the world, often in dangerous situa-
tions—we need to recognize them. We 
need to support them. We need to let 
them know that we know what they 
are doing and that we care what they 
are doing. 
That is why I am here today to talk 
about Tim Hudson, a guy who has made 
a difference for this country for 54 
years, and he has made a huge dif-
ference for the people of Maine over 
the past 5 years. 
I want to say thanks to Tim and his 
wife Mary and wish him the best in his 
retirement. He is the best of what 
America is all about. He has served us 
well and he has served the people of 
Maine well and I appreciate it and 
thank him for it. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
AFGHANISTAN 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, September 11, 2001, is a date that 
is seared in the memories of those of us 
who lived through that day and experi-
enced the trauma and the fear of that 
day. 
What has always struck me about 
that day and the days following, even 
standing here 20 years later, is how the 
entire free world stood united against 
what we saw as a common threat. It 
came to us as naturally as breathing. 
We understood that as witnesses to 
mass murder, we shared a duty to 
avenge those who had died. It may 
have been fear that forced us together, 
but in the days that followed the at-
tacks, we, as Americans, rediscovered 
the ties that have bound us for cen-
turies and solidified our faith in the 
common cause of freedom. 
But the more time that passes be-
tween each September 11 and the Sep-
tember 11 attacks, the more obvious it 
becomes that history slips away from 
those who fail to heed its lessons. The 
defensive action we took as a nation in 
the wake of the attacks was among the 
most forceful and effective the world 
had ever seen, but still, even 20 years 
later, it is obvious that our work in Af-
ghanistan and the Middle East is far 
from over. 
My colleague from Maine talked 
about the withdrawal from Afghani-
stan. I would say, as I talk to Ten-
nesseans, it is not withdrawing from 
Afghanistan; it was the manner in 
which the Biden administration chose 
to end the military mission in Afghani-
stan that didn’t seem to reflect the re-
ality of what was going on on the 
ground. 
Last week, I sent a letter to Chair-
man REED, with several of my col-
leagues on the Armed Services Com-
mittee, asking for formal hearings on 
the withdrawal. We need to know ex-
actly what happened, how they were 
advised. Without sworn testimony from 
Secretary Austin, General Milley, Gen-
eral McKenzie, and General Miller, we 
will never be able to untangle the cha-
otic course of events that led to the 
deaths of 13 servicemembers in Kabul 
and the abandonment of an unknown 
number of American citizens and our 
Afghan partners. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent that the letter be printed in 
the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD as follows: 
U.S. SENATE, 
September 8, 2021. 
Senator JACK REED, 
Chairman, Senate Armed Services Committee, 
Washington, DC. 
CHAIRMAN REED: It is necessary and appro-
priate for Congress to examine the manner 
in which our military mission ended in Af-
ghanistan. We should do so with trans-
parency, 
candor, 
and 
a 
dedication 
to 
ascertaining the facts without regard to poli-
tics. 
We understand that in the coming months, 
many committees will claim the authority 
to ask questions regarding our military’s 
withdrawal. Yet, because our committee 
bears the special responsibility of author-
izing and overseeing America’s armed forces, 
we acutely feel the obligation to seek an-
swers. The American people. and in par-
ticular many of those who serve our country 
in uniform, are hurting, angry, and dis-
appointed. We owe them a clear and com-
prehensive understanding of what happened, 
why, and how best to learn from these events 
for the future. Time is of the essence. These 
hearings should be our top priority when the 
Senate reconvenes. 
We write to formally request that the Sen-
ate Armed Services Committee fully exercise 
its oversight authority by holding both 
opened and closed hearings on this matter 
and that our committee ask the Department 
of Defense to preserve any and all records 
pertaining to the conclusion of our oper-
ations in Afghanistan. In particular, we seek 
sworn testimony from Secretary Lloyd Aus-
tin, General Mark Milley, General Frank 
McKenzie, Jr., and General A. Scott Miller. 
We owe it to our nation, those who served, 
their families, and our allies and partners 
who fought alongside us, to preserve the 
records of how our fight in Afghanistan con-
cluded. The insights we gather will help pre-
vent future loss of American blood and treas-
ure, a solemn responsibility and sacred trust 
we believe all members of our committee 
will seek to uphold. 
Sincerely, 
Tommy Tuberville, Roger Wicker, Tom 
Cotton, Joni K. Ernst, Thom Tillis, 
Dan Sullivan, Kevin Cramer, Rick 
Scott, 
Marsha 
Blackburn, 
Josh 
Hawley, U.S. Senators. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Beyond the fact- 
finding mission, I plan to use these 
hearings to impress upon my Demo-
cratic colleagues the importance of the 
words that we use to describe our en-
emies, how we talk about them, how 
we frame their actions. 
Since day one—since day one of this 
administration—the Biden administra-
tion has used their words to rehabili-
tate the Taliban in the eyes of their 
radical base. The problem, of course, is 
that 
their 
diplomatic 
calls 
for 
inclusivity and equality, this supports 
a lie about who the Taliban actually is. 
The Taliban—like ISIS, like al-Qaida— 
is a terrorist organization. They rule 
by fear. They rule through public be-
headings, rape, forced marriage, bru-
tality against anyone who questions 
their regime, against anyone who dis-
agrees with them. Look at the way 
women and children are treated. 
Now, in my opinion and from a lot of 
Tennesseans whom I have talked with 
as I have been home, they feel that ex-
pecting terrorists to behave like nor-
mal people is reckless and stupid. And 
they feel that some of the actions that 
have come from this administration 
and comments that they would have 
that expectation would reflect that 
reckless stupidity. These are terrorist 
organizations. 
If you need another example of this, 
just look at their approach to border 
security. Even before the transfer of 
power, massive migrant caravans had 
begun moving out of Central America 
and toward the southern border. They 
were eager to take advantage of then- 
Candidate Biden’s promises of open 
borders and amnesty for all. 
Where did that get us? Well, this is 
what we have learned. The CBP reports 
that migrant encounters along the 
U.S.-Mexico border reached a 20-year 
high in July. That is right, massive 
numbers. They heard those promises. 
So what did they do? They got to work 
contacting a cartel, and they made this 
journey after, of course, they paid the 
cartel. Most of the nearly 200,000 people 
our Border Patrol caught in July were 
traveling alone. Families might be 
holding back, but the international 
traffickers certainly are not holding 
back. 
On August 29, CBP officers in Mem-
phis 
found 
three 
kilograms

ketamine in a shipment of furniture 
from France coming in because of the 
cartels. 
In the first week of September, CBP 
officers in Texas seized two separate 
stashes of cocaine with a combined 
street value of almost $300,000. In the 
month of July alone, cocaine seizures 
increased 91 percent, and meth seizures 
increased 20 percent. Why are they 
doing this? They know that the border 
is open. 
On September 8, Texas State Troop-
ers and CBP officers stopped two 
human smuggling attempts running 
just hours apart from each other. Our 
CBP officers have made it standard 
procedure to scour remote terrain for 
migrants who have been abandoned and 
left to die by their cartel transporters. 
Why is this happening? Because it is 
obvious to everyone, from the mi-
grants, the cartels to the foreign offi-
cials who refuse to police their own 
borders, that the Biden administration 
won’t do anything to stop it. Ten-
nesseans see this as reckless. It makes 
no sense. 
I talked to some local law enforce-
ment officers this week. They are see-
ing an uptick in meth, fentanyl, and 
heroin on the streets—all coming out 
of Mexico. They repeatedly say: Secure 
the border. 
We live in the greatest Nation on 
Earth. We are still the world’s best ex-
ample for freedom, and we are the last 
hope for millions of people suffering 
under authoritarian rule. It is impor-
tant to understand that it doesn’t have 
to be the way it has been when you 
look at this withdrawal from Afghani-
stan, when you look at this open bor-
der, when you look at the fact that, 
yes, this year, the border patrol has ap-
prehended terrorists at the southern 
border. That is right. It doesn’t have to 
be that way, but when you have weak 
leadership—leadership that is not fo-
cused, leadership that says ‘‘it is my 
way or the highway’’—and when you 
have that reckless disregard for the 
truth, that can and will destroy us. 
The actions of the Biden administra-
tion have already emboldened our en-
emies. They have made our allies doubt 
our commitment to them and to the 
work that they are trying to do to ad-
vance 
freedom 
for 
themselves—the 
work that we are doing to advance 
freedom here in this country and 
abroad. 
So I would encourage my Democratic 
colleagues to resist the urge to fall in 
line with the White House on the issue 
of the Afghanistan withdrawal and to, 
instead, join me in demanding as many 
hearings as it takes to restore account-
ability and transparency and to find 
out exactly what happened. 
What were our military advisers say-
ing to President Biden? To Vice Presi-
dent HARRIS? To Jake Sullivan? To 
Susan Rice? To Antony Blinken? What 
were they telling them? What was the 
expectation? Did they have a plan? Did 
they plan to leave Americans behind 
enemy lines? Did they plan to give up 
Bagram Airfield? Did they plan to 
leave all of the equipment for the 
Taliban to use? Did they plan on that? 
Was it intentional that they made 
those decisions or was it reckless stu-
pidity that got us here? 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
REMEMBERING RICHARD KINKOFF III 
Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, last 
weekend, we lost a truly selfless public 
servant when Richard Kinkoff III, from 
my office, passed away. 
He joined our office as an intern in 
2013, and he literally never left. He 
kept showing up after his internship 
had ended until we finally had to hire 
him full time to work with us because 
he kept showing up every single day. 
And he kept at it because he wanted to 
serve. He wanted to serve the people of 
Florida. That is exactly what Rich did 
for the past 8 years in leading our team 
and graciously responding to hundreds 
of thousands of constituents’ inquiries. 
I think it is important to note that it 
is tedious work, but, for him, it was 
not a formula or an exercise in check-
ing boxes. He was passionate about 
that kind of work. He took time to lis-
ten to the callers who would call. He 
would read the emails. He sat down and 
talked to constituents, and then he 
worked with others on our team to get 
them answers. He believed in his work. 
He never let the process take the pur-
pose out of the work that he did or that 
the team was doing. 
Two years ago, his work was recog-
nized when our office received the De-
mocracy Foundation’s award for con-
stituent service, an award that we 
would not have received had he not 
been part of our team. But for Rich, 
honestly, it wasn’t about recognition; 
it was about service. 
It is no surprise that he took a par-
ticular interest in veterans’ issues. He 
treated every constituent case with the 
respect it deserved, but he had a spe-
cial passion for making sure our self-
less veterans were not left behind or 
forgotten in the bureaucracy. That is 
the one word that, I think, keeps com-
ing back as we talk in our office with 
the staff, and it keeps coming back as 
we have reflected on his life over the 
past week—selfless. 
Rich had a pickup truck, a big pickup 
truck, which made him pretty popular 
with colleagues, with friends, with 
friends of friends. People need to move, 
and if you have a truck, you know ev-
erybody always wants to borrow it. 
Rich being Rich, he was always there 
for them. If your car broke down, Rich 
was there. If you were an intern in 
need of career advice, Rich was there. 
If you needed a ride from the airport, 
Rich was there. He would even pull 
himself away from a Tampa Bay Light-
ning game to lend a helping hand. 
Now, look. I have no doubt that Rich 
would be embarrassed by all of this be-
cause it was never about him or for 
him. 
In a letter to the Christian church in 
Philippi, Paul and Timothy wrote: 
Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain 
conceit. Rather, in humility, value others 
above yourselves. 
Those who knew him can say that 
Rich answered that call time and 
again. 
And now, for reasons that we cannot 
explain or know or understand, he has 
answered a different call, but I do know 
that we are all better for knowing him, 
and so are countless others who never 
knew his name. He was selfless. He was 
noble. He was a decent man. And as we 
honor and celebrate his life, let us hope 
to follow in his example in all that we 
do here. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, 
first, I ask unanimous consent that I 
be permitted to complete my remarks 
before the scheduled 5:30 p.m. vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATIONS 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, 
prior to the August recess, I, along 
with Senator MURPHY, asked unani-
mous consent to confirm almost 30— 
30—highly qualified Foreign Affairs 
and Development nominees who were 
languishing on the Senate floor. I 
noted then the danger of leaving these 
posts unfilled at a time that we were 
facing such a confluence of global chal-
lenges. 
Two 
Republican 
Senators 
blocked each one of our requests. Days 
later, Haiti was hit with a devastating 
earthquake, and Afghanistan imploded. 
While I continue to believe it is es-
sential that this body swiftly confirm 
every single foreign affairs and devel-
opment professional whose nomination 
is pending on the Senate floor, I rise 
again today to seek unanimous consent 
to confirm four nominees who are crit-
ical to addressing the crisis in Afghani-
stan and Haiti. 
Ambassador Donald Lu, a career For-
eign Service Officer, is the President’s 
nominee to serve as Assistant Sec-
retary for the Bureau of South and 
Central Asian Affairs. 
The last Assistant Secretary for this 
Bureau 
was 
confirmed 
during 
the 
Obama administration. To say that 
this nomination is long overdue is an 
understatement, 
particularly 
now, 
given the incredibly dangerous situa-
tion in Afghanistan. 
Post-withdrawal of U.S. troops from 
Afghanistan, the State Department is 
the main implementer of U.S. policy in 
the country. And given the regional 
implications of Afghanistan policy, it 
is essential that this role be filled with 
a seasoned and experienced diplomat 
like Ambassador Lu. 
The region is also home to several 
other countries critical to U.S. inter-
ests. From Pakistan to India, to the 
countries of central Asia, the United 
States must be present in order to ad-
vance those interests and counter the 
malign influence of both Russia and 
China.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6449 
September 13, 2021 
So I hope that my colleagues will not 
continue to play games and will sup-
port Ambassador Lu’s confirmation 
this evening. 
Similarly, it is unthinkable that the 
State Department’s intelligence office, 
the Bureau of Intelligence and Re-
search, or as we know it as INR, re-
mains without senior leadership. 
INR is an invaluable resource for the 
Secretary of State’s senior officials 
and, indeed, all of the dedicated foreign 
policy professionals who serve our Na-
tion so well and so tirelessly. It needs 
a confirmed leader in place that can 
help the Department understand the 
intelligence information that is out 
there that helps us instruct, in terms 
of foreign policy choices. So I am ask-
ing my Republican colleagues to per-
mit confirming Brett Holmgren today. 
Shifting to Haiti, last month I came 
to the floor to highlight the challenges 
that we face in our own hemisphere 
and the impact of regional instability 
on U.S. national security and our citi-
zens’ safety. 
Already, the situation is more urgent 
than when I raised it. In August, a 
massive earthquake in Haiti killed 
more than 2,200 people, injured 12,000 
more, destroyed tens of thousands of 
buildings. A coordinated international 
response is urgently needed. 
This new emergency follows the as-
sassination of Haiti’s President and 
mounting crises in the region, unprece-
dented protests, and widespread repres-
sion in Cuba, a brutal regime crack-
down in Nicaragua, and an expansive 
political and humanitarian refugee cri-
sis in Venezuela. 
COVID–19 continues to inflict severe 
social and economic consequences on 
countries across the region, and there 
are the enduring security and govern-
ance challenges in Central America 
that fuel irregular migration. 
We need urgently qualified nominees 
in leadership positions to address these 
crises. 
With an extensive experience in the 
Americas, Ambassador Brian Nichols, a 
career Foreign Service Officer, will 
skillfully advance U.S. national inter-
ests as the Assistant Secretary for 
Western Hemisphere Affairs. 
Similarly, Marcela Escobari, who 
served as Assistant Administrator for 
Latin America’s USAID in the Obama 
administration, will bring unique ex-
pertise to the position if confirmed 
again today. In 2016, the Senate con-
firmed her by voice vote—voice vote. 
We need her in place and should move 
her again today. 
It is scandalous that these nominees 
and many others are being held up for 
reasons completely unrelated to them 
and the positions they will hold. Such 
irresponsible behavior jeopardizes our 
national security, and we must act 
today. 
So let me start by asking, first, 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the consideration—Madam 
President, I will reserve the opportuni-
ties to ask for these consents and wait 
for one of our colleagues to appear on 
the floor. 
At this time, I suggest the absence of 
a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, 
pursuant to the comments I was just 
making a few minutes ago, let me 
move directly to my request. I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the consideration of Cal-
endar No. 335, Donald Lu to be Assist-
ant Secretary of State for South Asian 
Affairs, and that the Senate vote on 
the nomination without intervening 
action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. CRUZ. Madam President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, reserv-
ing the right to object, I want to make 
a few remarks on Senator MENENDEZ’s 
request for unanimous consent on the 
nomination of Donald Lu to be Assist-
ant Secretary of State for the Bureau 
of South and Central Asian Affairs and 
also 
on 
the 
nomination 
of 
Brett 
Holmgren to be the Assistant Sec-
retary of State for Intelligence and Re-
search. 
The reality is that had these nomi-
nees been confirmed in August, they 
would have done nothing to stop the 
administration’s disastrous withdrawal 
from Afghanistan. 
President Biden bears responsibility 
for the catastrophe that has unfolded 
in Afghanistan. President Biden re-
peatedly ignored reasonable advice and 
the intelligence on what was happening 
on the ground in the runup to the dis-
astrous withdrawal. 
He abandoned the Bagram Airfield 
well before August, setting the stage 
for the chaos at the Kabul airport. He 
wasn’t even listening to his staff on 
what needed to be done on Afghani-
stan. 
Instead, he imposed an arbitrary 
deadline for political purposes, with 
disastrous results. 
I am not going to object to consent 
on this individual, Mr. Lu, and on Mr. 
Holmgren, in a moment, that Senator 
MENENDEZ will ask for, but let’s be 
clear. The administration has tried to 
play a blame game to deflect blame for 
their absolute failure to conduct a rea-
sonable and rational drawdown, to de-
flect blame for President Biden’s deci-
sion 
to 
abandon 
Bagram 
to 
the 
Taliban, to deflect blame for President 
Biden’s indefensible decision to give 
the Taliban a list of names of Ameri-
cans and Afghans who are now very 
much in harm’s way and in jeopardy 
because of the foolishness and the 
manifest incompetence of this adminis-
tration. 
None of the nominees I have holds on 
would have made one difference in 
what happened in Afghanistan. And it 
is difficult to believe that even my 
Democratic colleagues believe, polit-
ical talking points notwithstanding, 
how, for instance, the Assistant Sec-
retary for Educational and Cultural Af-
fairs could have stopped President 
Biden from gift-wrapping Bagram Air-
field and giving it to the Taliban. 
It is also important to provide a lit-
tle bit of background on why these 
holds are in place in the first place. 
President Biden is not following the 
law. He is refusing to follow the law 
which mandates the imposition of 
sanctions on Nord Stream 2. Those 
sanctions had succeeded, had halted 
Nord Stream 2 in its place, and Presi-
dent Biden transformed an incredible 
foreign policy victory into an incred-
ible foreign policy defeat. 
When President Biden came into of-
fice, he willfully and brazenly dis-
regarded the law, and he allowed Nord 
Stream 2 to continue on its road to 
completion, which was, in effect, a 
multibillion-dollar gift to Vladimir 
Putin at the expense of Europe’s secu-
rity and at the expense of American 
national security. 
However, there is still time to stop 
Nord Stream 2 if we act quickly. A 
pipeline that isn’t 100 percent complete 
is effectively zero percent complete. 
And I am not going to stop working to 
halt Nord Stream 2 to stop Russia and 
to prevent Vladimir Putin from eco-
nomically blackmailing our European 
allies and threatening American jobs. 
These consents—and, more broadly, 
what the administration is engaged 
in—is a blame game trying to distract 
blame from their own actions. But it is 
worth noting that I have offered to lift 
my holds from the beginning. And, in-
deed, over a month ago, I extended the 
offer to Treasury Secretary Yellen, to 
the National Security Advisor in the 
White House, and to Senator MENENDEZ 
that I would lift these holds—lift the 
holds on Treasury nominees and lift 
the holds on State Department career 
nominees if the administration either 
imposed sanctions under CAATSA, the 
Countering 
American 
Adversaries 
Through Sanctions Act, or if they 
waived those sanctions in such a way 
that it would trigger Congress having 
an override vote. 
On August 5, I extended that offer di-
rectly to Secretary Yellen. Unfortu-
nately, the administration hasn’t acted 
on it. They have decided that their pol-
icy of gift-wrapping a multibillion-dol-
lar pipeline for Vladimir Putin and 
Russia was so important that they 
wanted to deny Congress even a vote 
on it under CAATSA. 
CAATSA was passed for precisely 
these circumstances—for an adminis-
tration that refused to follow U.S. law

and refused to comply with tough sanc-
tions on Russia. That is what the advo-
cates of CAATSA argued. This is a 
mechanism to force an administration 
to obey U.S. law and stand up to Rus-
sia. 
Now, at the time, the Democrats be-
lieved they were speaking about the 
Trump administration, but the prin-
ciples behind CAATSA apply equally to 
Joe Biden’s defying the law and giving 
this gift to Vladimir Putin at the ex-
pense of U.S. national security inter-
ests. 
This administration has had a path 
for months to clear these nominees. It 
has declined to exercise that path. 
That path remains before it, nonethe-
less, because this nominee and the next 
one are directly relevant to cleaning up 
the mess that the Biden administration 
has made in Afghanistan. 
I do not object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
The clerk will report the nomination. 
The legislative clerk read the nomi-
nation of Donald Lu, of California, a

Service, Class of Minister-Counselor, to 
be Assistant Secretary of State for

Mr. MENENDEZ. I ask unanimous 
consent that the Senate proceed to the 
consideration of Calendar No. 150, 
Brett M. Holmgren to be an Assistant

the nomination without any inter-
vening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection?

Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, reserv-

reasons I just articulated—that this 
position, as with the previous one, is 
directly related to trying to clean up 
the mess, the disaster that the Biden 
administration has created in Afghani-
stan. 
I intend not to object to this nomina-
tion. 
The remaining holds remain in place, 
and the administration can lift the 
Treasury hold and the career state 
holds anytime they want by following 
the law under CAATSA and either im-
posing sanctions or, if they don’t want 
to impose sanctions on Russia, trig-
gering a vote in Congress so that this 
body can decide whether or not sanc-
tions could be imposed on Russia. The 
administration has had that option in 
front of it for many weeks. It still has 
that option. 
I do not object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there 
any further objections? 
Without objection, it is so ordered.

vise and consent to the nomination of

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the Sen-
ate proceed to the consideration of Cal-
endar No. 323, Marcela Escobari to be 
Assistant Administrator of the United 
States Agency for International Devel-
opment, and that the Senate vote on 
the nomination without any inter-
vening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Texas. 
Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, reserv-
ing the right to be object, as I de-
scribed minutes ago, the Biden admin-
istration is in outright defiance of Fed-
eral law. An overwhelming bipartisan 
majority of the Senate and the House 
have passed tough sanctions on Rus-
sia—sanctions that work; sanctions 
that shut down the Nord Stream 2 pipe-
line for a year. But when President 
Biden came into office, he chose to 
override Federal law and instead to 
give a multibillion-dollar gift to Vladi-
mir Putin in Russia. That decision is a 
generational geopolitical mistake. It 
harms U.S. national security interests, 
it benefits Russia, and it hurts Europe. 
Moreover, my hold on these nomina-
tions, I have expressed to the adminis-
tration in writing and orally over a 
month ago. They have a path to lifting 
the hold on the Treasury Department 
nominees and the career State Depart-
ment nominees simply by either en-
forcing sanctions under CAATSA on 
Russia or overriding those sanctions 
and triggering a vote in this body 
where Members of this body can reg-
ister our views on whether Joe Biden is 
correct in giving this multibillion-dol-
lar gift to Vladimir Putin that under-
mines our national security. 
Accordingly, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, 
it is unfortunate that this last nominee 
is objected to. This particular posi-
tion—we are talking about Haiti. We 
are talking about having an Assistant 
Administrator that can help us restore 
the tragic situation in Haiti to a place 
in which people can live and won’t seek 
migration to the United States. 
When we are talking about what is 
happening in the Western Hemisphere, 
in Venezuela, where there is a huge hu-
manitarian set of refugees leaving; 
when we talk about what is happening

September 13, 2021 
in Cuba with reference to the move-
ments for democracy, this particular 
position would be dealing with all of 
that. 
I must say, I know that my colleague 
wants to say none of this would have 
changed anything. That is not the case. 
I am not saying that the ultimate re-
sult 
in 
Afghanistan 
would 
have 
changed, but certainly, when we do not 
have people in key positions advo-
cating for U.S. national security and 
policy, it exacerbates the set of cir-
cumstances because we don’t have the 
wherewithal to do what is necessary. 
There are many other key positions I 
will be coming to the Senate floor and 
highlighting how that has a risk to na-
tional security. 
Finally, I would just simply say 
CAATSA was violated by President 
Trump when he exercised no sanctions 
on the same issue that my colleague is 
concerned about. I happen to agree 
with him on the issue; I disagree with 
him in the process in which he is pur-
suing it. But that started with Presi-
dent Trump. 
By the way, President Trump started 
with a surrender agreement to the 
Taliban. He gave them everything, got 
nothing in return. He let them have 
5,000 prisoners, Taliban prisoners, who 
were returned to the Taliban—that 
added to the fighting force—and got 
none of the commitments that were 
necessary to deal with a negotiation or 
a peace deal with the Afghan Govern-
ment. He got nothing at all except a 
total surrender and then dramatically 
reduced the troop levels at that time. 
So there is a lot to talk about about 
Afghanistan, not only in the imme-
diate context but over what has hap-
pened over the last 20 years. The Sen-
ate Foreign Relations Committee in-
tends to do that extensive review 
through a series of hearings. 
Let’s put history exactly where it be-
longs—in the right context.

built this country and built our middle 
class. 
It 
recognizes 
all 
Americans 
working hard every day to support 
families who contribute to community 
and power our economy.

Presiding Officer has traveled to Ari-
zona, I have been all over my State of 
Ohio talking with those workers: steel-
workers in Toledo, busdrivers in Can-
ton, VA healthcare workers serving our 
veterans in Chillicothe, union mechan-
ics in Columbus. They live in different 
communities. They come from dif-
ferent backgrounds. But the dignity of 
work unites all of us. 
We take pride in hard work in this 
country, and we believe, as Dr. King 
said and Pope Leo XIII said, that all 
work has dignity, whether you punch a 
clock or swipe a badge, whether you 
work for tips, whether you take care of 
aging parents, whether you are raising 
children or whether you are a new 
grandparent—no matter who you are, 
where you live, or what kind of work 
you do. 
For far too many people, hard work 
isn’t paying off. Productivity has gone 
up. Stock prices have soared. Executive 
compensation 
is 
stratospheric. 
But 
wages have barely budged. This isn’t a 
coincidence. It is not an accident of the 
market. It is not an inevitable result of 
our system of capitalism. 
Wall Street has the power in this 
economy. They are obsessed with accu-
mulating more wealth for the people 
who already have it. The system we 
have, where most of the gains in the 
economy seem to go to those at the 
top, is by Wall Street’s explicit design, 
and it comes at the direct expense of 
American workers. 
We don’t always make the connec-
tion. People are rightfully angry, but 
they don’t think about how decisions 
in corporate boardrooms and on the 
floors of stock exchanges thousands of 
miles away affect their job opportuni-
ties and their wages. 
Corporations focus on their short- 
term performance on the stock market, 
not the long-term success of the com-
pany and its workers. Their main goal 
too often becomes increasing stock 
prices quarter to quarter. That is how 
CEO performance is evaluated. They 
are compensated in large part with 
company shares. Stocks can account 
for as much as half of an executive’s 
compensation package. 
Corporations, therefore, juice those 
stock prices by repurchasing their own 
stock, what we call stock buybacks. 
Here is how it works. There are a finite 
number of company shares at any 
given time. Purchasing shares will de-
crease the number of shares available 
to investors and therefore drive up the 
price and the value of the remaining 
shares. 
Existing shareholders will see their 
stock value increase. Lo and behold, 
often those existing shareholders are 
the executives of the company. This is 
often an even more attractive option to 
executives 
than 
dividends 
because 
buybacks are more flexible and, under 
current law, they aren’t taxed until the 
shares are sold. That is what we want 
to change. 
The economy hasn’t always worked 
this way. A few decades ago, most of 
Wall Street capital funded the real 
economy: wages, machinery, research, 
new construction, expansion of the

company. Stock buybacks used to be 
considered illegal market manipula-
tion. 
Think 
about 
that. 
Stock 
buybacks then used to be considered il-
legal market manipulation. 
Today, they have become routine. 
Now, only 15 percent of capital goes to 
the real economy while the amount 
corporations spend on buybacks has 
just exploded. Between 2004 and 2013, 
Home Depot, a great company by most 
measures, in that decade spent 99 per-
cent of its net income on stock 
buybacks—99 percent of its net income 
on stock buybacks. IBM spent 92 per-
cent. 
That is right. Some companies spend 
close to 100 percent of their profits on 
their own stocks rather than workers’ 
wages, rather than expanding the com-
pany, rather than investing in research 
and development. 
It has only gotten worse since Wash-
ington Republicans’ 2017 tax giveaway 
to these corporations. We all remem-
ber—and I have pointed this out be-
fore—the lobbyists down the hall in 
front of Senator MCCONNELL’s office, 
the corporate lobbyists that lined up 
one after another as Senator MCCON-
NELL decided, on behalf of his Members 
and with President Trump during the 
Trump-McConnell 
Presidency—how 
Senator MCCONNELL handed these com-
panies a windfall. 
Their executives turned around. I re-
member Senator MCCONNELL, when he 
walked down the hall here after doing 
his conversations—I will just leave it 
at that—with his lobbyist friends. He 
would walk down the hall, and he 
would stand at the majority leader’s— 
then the majority leader—and I think 
that tax giveaway is part of the reason 
he is no longer the majority leader. 
But he would say that that is going 
to trickle down and workers are going 
to get raises and companies are going 
to expand and benefits are going to go 
to the whole economy. Well, that is not 
exactly what happened. When he hand-
ed them that windfall, you know what 
the executives did—the executives who 
were lobbying him, the executives who 
were contributing to the campaigns, 
the executives who control the Wall 
Street Journal editorial board? Do you 
know what they did? They turned 
around; they plowed that money right 
back 
into 
stock 
buybacks, 
which 
meant, lo and behold, right into their 
own pockets. 
The largest U.S. companies—in 2018, 
right after the tax giveaway, over a 
trillion dollars, 70 percent, went to the 
richest 1 percent. Don’t forget that 
number. In 2018, the largest U.S. com-
panies spent more than $800 billion in 
stock buybacks, a 50-percent increase 
from the previous year, a 50-percent in-
crease because they got that largesse 
from the Federal Treasury. 
They spent more on stock buybacks 
than on debt payments, than on capital 
expenditures, than on research and de-
velopment, than on dividends—in other 
words, the real economy. 
Now, in 2021, as millions of families 
struggle to recover from this pandemic 
and get back on their feet, you might 
think things would change. We are 
hearing that a lot of companies—the 
Presiding Officer hears it in Arizona; I 
hear it in Ohio—a lot of companies 
complain about supposed labor short-
ages. You might think that these com-
panies that are sitting on cash, that it 
might cause companies to reassess. 
They need more workers. Maybe they 
should cut back on juicing their stock 
buybacks, and instead they could per-
manently raise pay or increase retire-
ment contributions or offer better 
healthcare plans or invest in new train-
ing programs—all of those to attract 
new, 
better 
paid, 
more 
satisfied, 
happier workers. But, no, this year cor-
porate stock buybacks are on track to 
approach or even surpass the 2018 
record. 
Proponents of stock buybacks argue 
that companies purchase their own 
shares only after considering other, 
value-creating investment options. In 
other words, companies are arguing: 
You know, we do stock buybacks. 
Yeah, you are right; it makes us a lit-
tle richer individually, and we can buy 
that third or fourth home in Florida or 
on the Cape or on Lake Erie or what-
ever, but also, we consider everything 
that would be good for the company. 
We funded all that; so then we do stock 
buybacks. 
That is a ridiculous argument. Talk 
to any family in Cleveland or Chil-
licothe or Mansfield or Marietta or 
Springfield, anywhere outside of Wall 
Street. Ask these families if they can 
think of a better investment for the 
trillions—trillions, thousands of bil-
lions—trillions of dollars in wealth 
American workers have created. 
But, of course, executives’ personal 
interests influence their decision mak-
ing. One study of 2,500 companies found 
that the greater the percentage stock 
options 
in 
executive 
compensation 
packages, the more likely a company 
was to make stock buybacks. That is 
fairly logical. The greater percentage 
of stock options in an executive com-
pensation package, the more likely a 
company was to make stock buybacks. 
So how do we stop this never-ending 
cycle of corporate greed and make sure 
that workers are sharing in the profits 
they create? We start with the new bill 
that Senator WYDEN, the chair of the 
Finance Committee, and I are intro-
ducing: the Stock Buyback Account-
ability Act. 
The Tax Code is one of the best tools 
we have to influence businesses. The 
idea is simple. If you want to buy back 
your own stock, you have to pay just a 
little bit—a 2-percent tax—on the 
money you make off of it. Two percent 
is pretty small. It is a hell of a lot less 
than the tax rate that workers at First 
Solar, which I am going to visit this 
week in Perrysburg, are paying or 
workers at Whirlpool or workers at the 
local corner store, at the local Dave’s 
supermarket in Garfield Heights, are 
paying. 
But that little tax will make compa-
nies think a little harder about wheth-
er stock buybacks are really the best 
use of their trillions in profits. I hope 
it will make it a little more likely that 
they will invest the money in some-
thing useful, something like a new fac-
tory or researching new products or 
training and apprenticeship programs 
or pay raises for the workers who are 
making these profits possible. 
It has to be the goal of any stock 
buyback plan. It is not about punishing 
executives. I am indifferent. I have al-
ways believed it is whom you fight for 
and what you fight against. I will al-
ways fight for workers in this job. I 
don’t have any interest in punishing 
executives. I just don’t want to unduly 
reward them at the expense of workers. 
It is about executives paying their 
fair share just like their workers do. It 
is about changing the incentives in our 
economy so that more of our country’s 
wealth gets invested back to the people 
who created it. 
We have known for years that stock 
buybacks are a problem. They distort 
the market. They lead to less long- 
term economic growth. They divert in-
vestment from workers. That is why it 
is on worker pay, not stock buybacks. 
We have a real chance to actually do 
something about it. After years of poli-
ticians talking about reining in Wall 
Street, now is our opportunity to do it, 
to show people we are listening and to 
take action. 
Worker pay, not stock buybacks. Cre-
ate a fairer tax system. Creating a fair-
er tax system is one of the simplest 
ways to change the Wall Street and 
corporations’ first system that Ameri-
cans are so tired of. 
We make this simple fix to finally, fi-
nally crack down on stock buybacks. 
We get rid of the tax breaks for cor-
porations that ship American jobs 
overseas. We make multinational cor-
porations pay their fair share instead 
of 
always, 
always, 
always 
forcing 
working families to foot the bill. We 
crack down on wealthy tax cheats that 
game the system. We give working 
families the largest tax cut ever. 
We did that in the bill we passed in 
March. We are going to do that in the 
bills we pass this fall. 
It comes back to the dignity of work. 
Wall Street simply doesn’t recognize 
that all work has dignity. They con-
sider shareholders’ equity in a com-
pany to be all that matters. But work-
ers have equity in a company too. It is 
called sweat equity. It is time they 
were rewarded for it. 
Worker pay, not stock buybacks. 
I yield the floor.

TRIBUTE TO DR. KAREN O’NEIL 
Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor Dr. Karen O’Neil and to 
thank her for her service as director of 
the Green Bank Observatory for the 
past 15 years. 
Dr. O’Neil received her Ph.D. from 
the University of Oregon in physics, 
with a specialty in astrophysics. In ad-
dition to her work at Green Bank, she 
has worked as a professor of physics at 
the University of Oregon. She was also 
a staff astronomer at the National 
Ionosphere and Astronomy Center’s 
Arecibo Observatory in Arecibo, PR, 
where she worked on the commis-
sioning and testing of a wide variety of 
instruments and software for the 300m 
telescope. I am proud to join all of 
West Virginia in thanking Dr. Karen 
O’Neil for bringing her vast expertise 
to the Mountain State. 
For more than 60 years, the National 
Science Foundation, Pocahontas Coun-
ty, and the State of West Virginia have 
supported the ability of innumerable 
national and international scientists to 
make discoveries about our universe 
using the capabilities located at the 
observatory within the National Quiet 
Zone. Scientists at the Green Bank Ob-
servatory have made significant dis-
coveries that have helped us better un-
derstand our universe. Among the 
many achievements during Dr. O’Neil’s 
tenure, researchers helped discover a 
massive star that strains the limits of 
physics, a discovery that wouldn’t have 
been possible without the research 
made possible at Green Bank. It is a 
testament to the tremendous amount 
of research and data the observatory 
provides to the global scientific com-
munity. 
For the past several years, I have 
been committed to ensuring Green 
Bank stays open for the next genera-
tion of young West Virginia scientists. 
Dr. Karen O’Neil has been a tremen-
dous part of this effort. Not long ago, 
we were fighting to keep the observ-
atory open, and thanks to Dr. O’Neil’s 
efforts, we are now discussing Green 
Bank’s integral role in the next genera-
tion of astrophysics. Once again, I am 
truly grateful for her service as direc-
tor. Fortunately, she is not going far, 
and will continue to be a vital part of 
the continued growth of the observ-
atory. I am also proud to join her in 
welcoming the incoming Green Bank 
Director, Dr. James M. Jackson, who 
recognizes the observatory’s role as an 
essential facility in the Nation’s astro-
physics portfolio, and I know he will 
continue this legacy of excellence. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO EUGENE P. BOYD 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I 
rise to thank my constituent, Congres-
sional Research Service analyst Eu-
gene P. Boyd, on his four decades of 
service to the U.S. Congress. Mr. Boyd 
retired in January 2020, but, as with 
many other milestones, recognition of 
his retirement was disrupted by the 
onset of the COVID–19 pandemic. 
Mr. Boyd, a resident of Clinton, MD, 
began his CRS career in 1979 as an ana-
lyst focusing on urban policy and fed-
eralism. Throughout his career, he pro-
vided expert advice to the House and 
Senate on topics that included eco-
nomic 
development, 
empowerment 
zones, gentrification, and intergovern-
mental relations. 
Mr. Boyd began his career as a relo-
cation 
specialist 
for 
the 
Prince 
George’s County Housing Authority. 
He earned a bachelor’s degree in urban 
planning from Virginia Commonwealth 
University and a master’s degree in 
urban planning from Howard Univer-
sity. 
Mr. Boyd is noted especially for his 
commitment to and expertise on the 
District of Columbia, including de-
tailed knowledge of the city’s policies 
and politics that helped Congress un-
derstand the effects of its lawmaking 
on the Nation’s Capital. He coordinated 
a CRS team that supported congres-
sional consideration of the 1997 Capital 
Revitalization and Government Reor-
ganization Act. He advised Congress 
throughout its oversight of D.C. revi-
talization during the 1990s. More re-
cently, his work focused on the Puerto 
Rico Financial Oversight and Manage-
ment Board—FOMB—and the Commu-
nity 
Development 
Block 
Grant— 
CDBG—Program’s role in disaster re-
covery. He also aided Congress in un-
derstanding challenges facing local 
governments that drew national atten-
tion, such as the Flint, MI, water sys-
tem. 
Mr. Boyd’s colleagues regard him as 
a leader, mentor, and friend. In addi-
tion to guiding his colleagues in their 
official duties, Mr. Boyd served in his 
personal capacity as an active member 
of the Congressional Research Employ-
ees Association—CREA—and as a direc-
tor and vice chairman of the Library of 
Congress Federal Credit Union. His col-
leagues always appreciated his kind-
ness, 
humor, 
impeccable 
sartorial 
style, and expert culinary contribu-
tions. Above all, they treasured him as 
a gentleman and a professional who 
made CRS a better place to work. 
Some of Mr. Boyd’s most important 
life’s work occurred outside of the of-
fice. He was a member of only the sec-
ond class to integrate the public high 
schools in Newport News, VA. He knew 
well the realities of segregation, which 
inspired his lifelong belief in the im-
portance of democratic participation. 
He is a committed mentor, especially 
to young Black men, individually and 
through the Concerned Black Men or-
ganization. And in a true act of self-
lessness, in 1992 Mr. Boyd helped save 
the life of a 13-year-old boy in Okla-
homa, whom he had never met, by serv-
ing as a bone marrow donor. Mr. Boyd 
is so humble that many of his longtime 
colleagues did not know about his per-
sonal sacrifice until after he retired. 
The U.S. Congress and our Nation are 
better informed because of Eugene 
Boyd’s 
service 
to 
the 
legislative 
branch. I ask my colleagues to join me 
in wishing Mr. Boyd and his beloved 
wife Sharon Butts, also a CRS retiree, 
and daughter Lauren, all the best as 
Mr. Boyd begins the next chapter of his 
life of service to his community and his 
country.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
REMEMBERING BOBBY BOWDEN 
∑ Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor the life and legacy of 
college football coaching legend and 
my very good longtime friend, Bobby 
Bowden. 
Gayle and I offer our deepest condo-
lences to the members of the Bowden 
family, as well as to the entire ex-
tended Bulldogs, Mountaineers, and 
Seminoles families. We have lost a 
shining star in the college athletics 
community, but everything he stood 
for and represented lives on in the 
hearts and minds of all who had the 
privilege of knowing him, myself in-
cluded. 
I will never forget the first time I 
met Bobby. It was 1966, and he and Ann 
pulled up in a station wagon with six 
kids in the back. He made an impres-
sion, to say the least. I have never met 
a more humble and kind person, and he 
was always such a positive influence in 
my life and the lives of all the players 
he coached. Bobby was also a deeply 
devoted man of faith. It didn’t matter 
what your faith was, as long as you be-
lieved in something greater than your-
self. 
He holds a special place in the hearts 
of West Virginians in particular be-
cause of his tribute to the Marshall 
University team who perished in a 
plane crash in 1970. Our entire state-
wide community felt this loss. Friendly 
rivalries were set aside, and Bobby, 
who was head coach, led the way to tell 
the Nation ‘‘We are Marshall.’’ West 
Virginia University players wore Mar-
shall’s initials on their helmets, and 
the next season, Bobby gave Marshall’s 
new 
coaches 
access 
to 
film 
and 
gamebooks to help them rebuild their 
program. His selflessness toward Mar-
shall during that devastating time has 
been cherished in the decades that have 
followed. He was really something spe-
cial. 
Bobby had a gift for teaching the 
game and motivating you to be the 
best you could be in all aspects of your 
life. And it wasn’t all for the athletes; 
he treated everyone the very same. No 
one was more important than anyone 
else. It didn’t matter who your family 
was or where you came from, what 
mattered is what you made of yourself 
with the circumstances the Lord gave

you. He earned the legacy we know him 
for and expected no less from anyone 
else. 
With 377 wins and two national titles 
during his 40 years as a major college 
coach, he was the winningest coach in 
Division One history. But when the 
game was over, no matter the score, 
Bobby showed us the man he has al-
ways been—a leader, a fierce compet-
itor, and despite his humility, a man 
completely deserving of the prestige 
his legacy brought to himself and to 
the teams he coached. 
Good coaches certainly win games, 
but great coaches, like Bobby, have a 
profound impact on your life. They are 
models for how to handle perseverance, 
leadership, success, and failure and 
how to take what you learn from ath-
letics and utilize it to build the rest of 
your life. He knew sports can make you 
into so much more than a good athlete 
if you have the right attitude, and I 
know there are many former student- 
athletes who have Coach Bowden to 
thank in great part for their success. I 
had the honor of knowing him not only 
as one of the greatest coaches but also 
as a true friend and a man I have the 
greatest respect for. 
The relationships he forged with the 
players, his colleagues, and the com-
munities he called home had a pro-
found impact, bringing both national 
attention and respect to the teams he 
coached. If he lost a game, he was the 
first to go congratulate his opponent. 
Put simply, even though he wasn’t 
born in the Mountain State, he rep-
resented the very best of West Vir-
ginia, which is saying quite a lot. 
Again, I extend my condolences to 
his loving wife Ann; their children, 
Terry, Tommy, Jeff, Steve, Robyn, and 
Ginger; and their many grandchildren. 
May God Bless you and your family, 
my dear friend.∑

RECOGNIZING DV8 KITCHEN 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, as ranking 
member of the Senate Committee on 
Small Business and Entrepreneurship, 
each week I recognize an outstanding 
Kentucky small business that exempli-
fies the American entrepreneurial spir-
it. This week, it is my privilege to rec-
ognize a family-owned small business 
and second-chance employment oppor-
tunity, DV8 Kitchen of Lexington, KY, 
as the Senate Small Business of the 
Week. 
In 2017, Rob and Diane Perez opened 
DV8 Kitchen in Lexington, KY. The 
couple, who met while working in the 
restaurant industry, ran a successful 
restaurant in town. In 2013, Rob and 
Diane were dismayed to discover that 
they had lost 13 employees to addiction 
over 10 years and that half the cases 
were related to opioid drugs. Rob, who 
had overcome alcoholism when he was 
young, understood firsthand the chal-
lenges of recovery. Together, Rob and 
Diane decided to pursue a business ven-
ture that would provide dignified work 
and validate those in recovery. After a 
2-year planning process, DV8 Kitchen 
came together in just 4 and half 
months. There was an outpouring of 
support from local families and busi-
nesses, ranging from monetary invest-
ments to local professionals donating 
their services to the project. In Sep-
tember 2017, DV8 Kitchen began touch-
ing lives in Lexington, one meal at a 
time. 
Today, DV8 Kitchen continues their 
transformative 
work 
as 
a 
second- 
chance employment opportunity. The 
restaurant 
provides 
hearty, 
home- 
cooked Southern fare and is known for 
its homemade baked goods and bread, 
which it sells wholesale to other res-
taurants. Rob and Diane partner with 
local organizations and treatment cen-
ters, like Shepard’s House, to identify 
and hire individuals in recovery. Be-
yond employment, DV8 Kitchen pro-
vides community, purpose, and job 
skills. Through volunteer-taught work-
shops and mentoring, employees are 
equipped to continue rebuilding their 
lives. Despite the challenges of the 
COVID–19 pandemic, Rob and Diane 
were able to keep DV8 Kitchen running 
and continue their critical mission of 
supporting individuals in recovery. Ad-
ditionally, in fall 2021, DV8 Kitchen 
opened a second location with a larger 
bakery, right on Lexington’s Third 
Street. 
Beyond DV8 Kitchen, Rob and Diane 
are committed enabling small busi-
nesses to support workers in recovery. 
Through 
Soulfull 
Enterprise, 
an 
immersive training experience, local 
nonprofits, small businesses, and cor-
porations are equipped to hire and inte-
grate second-chance employees into 
their organizations. Additionally, the 
DV8 
Kitchen 
Vocational 
Training 
Foundation, Inc., trains and equips in-
dividuals in recovery to work in the 
restaurant industry. DV8 Kitchen’s re-
markable mission and success has been 
recognized at the local, regional, and 
national level. Their work has been 
profiled by local media, including 
WTVQ, WKYT, and Lex 18, and in na-
tional outlets like the New York 
Times, NBC News, and Oprah Maga-
zine. In addition to its social impact, 
DV8 Kitchen has earned accolades for 
its food, including being recognized by 
Yelp as one of the Top 100 Places to 
Eat in the U.S. in 2019. 
DV8 Kitchen is a remarkable example 
of the critical role small businesses 
play in uplifting and building commu-
nity. Family-owned small businesses 
like DV8 Kitchen form the heart of 
towns across Kentucky, regularly step-
ping up to support their communities 
and transform lives. Congratulations 
to Rob, Diane, and the entire team at 
DV8 Kitchen. I wish them the best of 
luck and look forward to watching 
their continued growth and success in 
Kentucky.∑

cated in downtown Boise at the corner 
of 8th and Bannock in the historic Hoff 
Building. Its founder, the two-time 
mayor of Boise and the 11th Governor 
of Idaho, Moses Alexander, established 
the small business in 1891 as a ‘‘one 
price clothier’’ that catered to the 
area’s gold miners. Since opening its 
doors, Alexander Davis has developed a 
reputation as one of the State’s pre-
mier tailors and clothiers. Their lon-
gevity and successes have caught the 
attention of clothing industry media. 
MR Magazine, a menswear trade publi-
cation, featured Alexander Davis in an 
article honoring businesses operating 
for more than 100 years. The publica-
tion celebrated Alexander Davis being 
the 11th oldest men’s clothing store in 
the United States and one of the oldest 
stores of its kind west of the Mis-
sissippi River. The business has become 
a fixture in downtown Boise and cred-
its its success to developing long-
standing personal connections with 
their customers. 
Alexander Davis’s current owner and 
Grangeville native, David Graves, was 
a longtime employee of the store be-
fore starting the process to purchase 
the company with his wife, Kathleen, 
in 2006. Since taking the helm, David 
has made it a priority to build on the 
business’s rich and long history. When 
customers enter the shop, they are wel-
comed by professional staff who pro-
vide one-on-one, personal service to en-
sure every client’s individual needs are 
met. David looks forward to continuing 
his work at Alexander Davis and has 
positioned the store as the Treasure 
Valley’s premier high-end clothing re-
tailer. 
Congratulations to David, Kathleen, 
and all of Alexander Davis Men’s Cloth-
ing employees on being selected as the 
Idaho Small Business of the Month for 
September 2021. You make our great 
State proud, and I look forward to your 
continued growth and success.∑

By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, 
Mr. LEE, Mr. WHITEHOUSE, Mr. 
CRUZ, and Ms. COLLINS): 
S. 2718. A bill to clarify that an au-
thorization to use military force, a dec-
laration of war, or any similar author-
ity shall not authorize the detention 
without charge or trial of a citizen or 
lawful 
permanent 
resident 
of 
the 
United States, and for other purposes; 
to the Committee on the Judiciary. 
Mrs. 
FEINSTEIN. 
Mr. 
President, 
today, I am reintroducing legislation 
to ensure that no American Citizen or 
green card holder faces indefinite de-
tention without charge or trial. 
Indefinite detention is an unfortu-
nate legacy of America’s not-too-dis-
tant past. The internment of Japanese- 
Americans during World War II re-
mains a dark spot on our Nation’s leg-
acy, and it is something we should 
never repeat. 
To ensure that this reprehensible ex-
perience would never happen again, 
Congress passed, and President Nixon 
signed into law, the Non-Detention Act 
of 1971. The Act states that ‘‘no citizen 
shall be imprisoned or otherwise de-
tained by the United States except pur-
suant to an Act of Congress.’’ 
One would have hoped that this legis-
lation would have brought an end to 
the notion that Americans could ever 
again be imprisoned at the whim of the 
Executive. Yet, in 2002, Jose´ Padilla, a 
U.S. citizen, was arrested in Chicago. 
He was initially detained pursuant to a 
material witness warrant based on the 
9/11 terrorist attacks, but he was later 
designated as an ‘‘enemy combatant’’ 
who conspired with al-Qaeda to carry 
out terrorist attacks inside the United 
States. 
Padilla was transferred to the mili-
tary brig in South Carolina, where he 
was detained for three-and-a-half years 
while seeking habeas corpus relief. 
Padilla was never charged with at-
tempting to carry out a terrorist at-
tack. Instead, he was transferred to 
Federal civilian custody in Florida in 
November of 2005, where he was con-
victed of other charges related to ter-
rorist plots overseas. 
While he was detained by the mili-
tary, Padilla filed a habeas corpus peti-
tion, which was first litigated in the 
Second Circuit Court of Appeals. The 
Second Circuit rejected the argument, 
advanced by the Bush Administration, 
that Padilla’s detention was authorized

September 13, 2021 
by the Authorization for the Use of 
Military Force (AUMF) against al- 
Qaeda 
and 
its 
affiliated 
terrorist 
groups, concluding instead that ‘‘clear 
congressional authorization is required 
for detentions of American citizens on 
American soil’’ and the AUMF was 
‘‘not such an authorization.’’ Ulti-
mately, however, the Supreme Court 
reversed the Second Circuit’s decision 
on other grounds, leaving an open ques-
tion as to whether the AUMF or other 
military authorities can be used to in-
definitely 
detain 
Americans 
appre-
hended in the United States. 
It is past time for Congress to resolve 
this legal ambiguity, consistent with 
our values, by stating once and for all 
that the AUMF and similar authorities 
do not authorize the indefinite deten-
tion of Americans apprehended in the 
United States. The Due Process Guar-
antee Act would accomplish this by 
codifying the ‘‘clear statement’’ rule 
articulated by the Second Circuit in 
Jose´ Padilla’s case and clarifying that 
authorizations for the use of military 
force and similar authorizations can-
not be construed as acts of Congress 
that permit indefinite detention. 
There is no legitimate reason to de-
tain Americans without due process. 
We have a court system that is fully 
capable of trying and convicting ter-
rorism suspects using existing laws and 
processes. We made a serious mistake 
when we detained Japanese-Americans 
during World War II, and we must 
never repeat it. 
I thank the Senator from Utah for 
his long partnership with me on this 
issue as well as the Senators from 
Rhode Island, Texas, and Maine for 
their longstanding support. We were 
able to pass this bill in the Senate in 
2013, and I am confident we can do so 
again. 
I ask unanimous consent that a copy 
of the bill be included in the RECORD. 
S. 2718 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Due Process 
Guarantee Act’’. 
SEC. 2. PROHIBITION ON THE INDEFINITE DE-
TENTION OF CITIZENS AND LAWFUL 
PERMANENT RESIDENTS. 
(a) LIMITATION ON DETENTION.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—Section 4001(a) of title 18, 
United States Code, is amended— 
(A) by striking ‘‘No citizen’’ and inserting 
the following: 
‘‘(1) No citizen or lawful permanent resi-
dent of the United States’’; and 
(B) by adding at the end the following: 
‘‘(2) Any Act of Congress that authorizes 
an imprisonment or detention described in 
paragraph (1) shall be consistent with the 
Constitution and expressly authorize such 
imprisonment or detention.’’. 
(2) 
APPLICABILITY.—Nothing 
in 
section 
4001(a)(2) of title 18, United States Code, as 
added by paragraph (1)(B), may be construed 
to limit, narrow, abolish, or revoke any de-
tention authority conferred by statute, dec-
laration of war, authorization to use mili-
tary force, or similar authority effective 
prior to the date of the enactment of this 
Act. 
(b) RELATIONSHIP TO AN AUTHORIZATION TO 
USE MILITARY FORCE, DECLARATION OF WAR, 
OR SIMILAR AUTHORITY.—Section 4001 of title 
18, United States Code, as amended by sub-
section (a) is further amended— 
(1) by redesignating subsection (b) as sub-
section (c); and 
(2) by inserting after subsection (a) the fol-
lowing: 
‘‘(b)(1) No United States citizen or lawful 
permanent resident who is apprehended in 
the United States may be imprisoned or oth-
erwise detained without charge or trial un-
less such imprisonment or detention is ex-
pressly authorized by an Act of Congress. 
‘‘(2) A general authorization to use mili-
tary force, a declaration of war, or any simi-
lar authority, on its own, may not be con-
strued to authorize the imprisonment or de-
tention without charge or trial of a citizen 
or lawful permanent resident of the United 
States apprehended in the United States. 
‘‘(3) Paragraph (2) shall apply to an author-
ization to use military force, a declaration of 
war, or any similar authority enacted before, 
on, or after the date of the enactment of the 
Due Process Guarantee Act. 
‘‘(4) This section may not be construed to 
authorize the imprisonment or detention of a 
citizen of the United States, a lawful perma-
nent resident of the United States, or any 
other person who is apprehended in the 
United States.’’. 
By Mrs. FEINSTEIN: 
S. 2722. A bill for the relief of 
Esidronio 
Arreola-Saucedo, 
Maria 
Elena Cobian Arreola, Nayely Arreola 
Carlos, and Cindy Jael Arreola; to the 
Committee on the Judiciary. 
Mrs. 
FEINSTEIN. 
Mr. 
President, 
today, I offer private immigration re-
lief legislation to provide lawful per-
manent resident status to Esidronio 
Arreola-Saucedo, Maria Elena Cobian 
Arreola, Nayely Arreola Carlos, and 
Cindy Jael Arreola. The Arreolas are 
Mexican nationals living in the Fresno 
area of California. 
Esidronio and Maria Elena have lived 
in the United States for over 20 years. 
Two of their five children, Nayely and 
Cindy, also stand to benefit from this 
legislation. 
The other three Arreola children, Ro-
berto, age 29, Daniel, age 25, and Saray, 
age 24, are U.S. citizens. 
The story of the Arreola family is 
compelling, and I believe they merit 
Congress’s special consideration for 
such an extraordinary form of relief as 
a private bill. 
The Arreolas are facing deportation 
in part because of grievous errors com-
mitted by their previous counsel, who 
has since been disbarred. In fact, the 
attorney’s conduct was so egregious 
that it compelled an immigration 
judge to write to the Executive Office 
of Immigration Review seeking the at-
torney’s disbarment for his actions in 
his clients’ immigration cases. 
Esidronio came to the United States 
in 1986 and was an agricultural migrant 
worker in the fields of California for 
several years. As a migrant worker at 
that time, he would have been eligible 
for permanent residence through the 
Seasonal Agricultural Workers (SAW) 
program had he known about it. 
Maria Elena was living in the United 
States at the time she became preg-
nant with her daughter Cindy. She re-
turned to Mexico to give birth because 
she wanted to avoid any immigration 
issues. 
Because of the length of time that 
the Arreolas were in the United States, 
it is likely that they would have quali-
fied for suspension of deportation, 
which would have allowed them to re-
main in the United States legally. 
However, the poor legal representation 
they received foreclosed this oppor-
tunity. 
One of the most compelling reasons 
for my introduction of this private bill 
is the devastating impact that the de-
portation of Esidronio and Maria Elena 
would have on their children—three of 
whom are American citizens—and the 
other two who have lived in the United 
States since they were toddlers. Amer-
ica is the only country the Arreola 
children have ever known. 
Nayely, the oldest, was the first in 
her family to graduate from high 
school and the first to graduate col-
lege. She recently received her Mas-
ter’s degree in Business Administration 
from Fresno Pacific University and 
now works at Gap, Inc. Nayely is mar-
ried and has a young son named Elijah 
and a young daughter named Brooklyn. 
At a young age, Nayely demonstrated 
a strong commitment to the ideals of 
citizenship in her adopted country. She 
worked hard to achieve her full poten-
tial both through her academic endeav-
ors and community service. As the As-
sociate Dean of Enrollment Services at 
Fresno Pacific University states in a 
letter of support, ‘‘the leaders of Fres-
no Pacific University saw in Nayely[ ] a 
young person who will become exem-
plary of all that is good in the Amer-
ican dream.’’ 
In high school, Nayely was a member 
of Advancement Via Individual Deter-
mination, a college preparatory pro-
gram in which students commit to de-
termining their own futures by attain-
ing a college degree. Nayely was also 
President of the Key Club, a commu-
nity service organization. Perhaps the 
greatest hardship to Nayely’s U.S. cit-
izen husband and child, if she were 
forced to return to Mexico, would be 
her lost opportunity to realize her 
dreams and contribute further to her 
community and to this country. 
Nayely’s sister, Cindy, is also mar-
ried and has three children. Neither 
Nayely nor Cindy is eligible to auto-
matically adjust their status based on 
their marriages because of their initial 
unlawful entry. 
The Arreolas also have other family 
who are U.S. citizens or lawful perma-
nent residents. Maria Elena has three 
brothers who are American citizens, 
and Esidronio has a sister who is an 
American citizen. They have no imme-
diate family in Mexico. 
According to immigration authori-
ties, this family has never had any 
problems with law enforcement. I am 
told that they have filed their taxes for 
every year from 1990 to the present. 
They have always worked hard to sup-
port themselves.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6460 
September 13, 2021 
As I mentioned, Esidronio was pre-
viously employed as a farm worker, but 
now has his own business in California 
repairing electronics. His business has 
been successful enough to enable him 
to purchase a home for his family. He 
and his wife are active in their church 
community and in their children’s edu-
cation. 
It is clear to me that this family has 
embraced the American dream. Enact-
ment of the legislation I have reintro-
duced today will enable the Arreolas to 
continue to make significant contribu-
tions to their community as well as the 
United States. 
I ask my colleagues to support this 
private bill. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the text of the bill be printed 
in the RECORD. 
S. 2722 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in

SENATE 
RESOLUTION 
355—SUP-
PORTING THE RECOGNITION AND 
GOALS 
OF 
OVERDOSE 
AWARE-
NESS 
DAY 
IN 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES 
Mr. 
MARKEY 
(for 
himself, 
Mr. 
CASEY, Mr. BROWN, Ms. KLOBUCHAR, Ms. 
WARREN, Mr. WHITEHOUSE, Ms. HASSAN, 
Mr. MANCHIN, and Mr. BLUMENTHAL) 
submitted the following resolution; 
which was referred to the Committee 
on Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions: 
S. RES. 355 
Whereas more than 750,000 individuals in 
the United States have died from a drug 
overdose since 1999; 
Whereas substance use disorders and drug 
overdoses affect all socioeconomic groups, 
racial and ethnic groups, geographic regions, 
and ages; 
Whereas substance use disorders are a 
chronic disease, and recognizing those dis-
orders as such decreases stigma and ac-
knowledges that substance use may be be-
yond the control of an individual; 
Whereas overdose deaths are preventable, 
and lives can be saved through awareness, 
prevention, intervention, treatment, and re-
covery support; 
Whereas overdose deaths claimed more 
than 93,000 lives in the United States in 2020, 
and the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID–19) 
pandemic has contributed to the accelera-
tion of overdose deaths; 
Whereas communities across the United 
States have been pained by substance use 
disorders through the premature loss of lives 
and the stigma associated with drug-related 
fatalities; and 
Whereas 
numerous 
States 
across 
the 
United States have lowered their State flags 
in recognition of Overdose Awareness Day: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the recognition and goals of 
Overdose Awareness Day in the United 
States; and 
(2) encourages all Federal buildings in the 
United States to lower their flags to half- 
staff on August 31 of each year to support 
awareness of overdoses.

SENATE RESOLUTION 356—RECOG-
NIZING THE 500TH ANNIVERSARY 
OF THE FOUNDING OF THE CITY 
OF SAN JUAN, PUERTO RICO 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida (for himself 
and Mr. RUBIO) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee on Energy and Natural Re-
sources: 
S. RES. 356 
Whereas, since 1898, after the Spanish- 
American War and with the ratification of 
the Treaty of Paris, Puerto Rico has been a 
territory of the United States; 
Whereas the city of San Juan, the capital 
of Puerto Rico, is the oldest continuously in-
habited city established by Europeans within 
United States territory; 
Whereas, as reference, the city of Saint 
Augustine, in the State of Florida, was es-
tablished in 1565, which makes the city of 
San Juan about 44 years older; 
Whereas San Juan is also the third-oldest 
capital city established by Europeans in the 
Americas, after Santo Domingo, Dominican 
Republic (1496), and Panama City, Panama 
(1519); 
Whereas San Juan is home to the second- 
oldest church in the Americas, Iglesia San 
Jose´, which started construction in 1532 and 
has just reopened its doors after more than 2 
decades of restoration work; 
Whereas the Palacio de Santa Catalina, 
also known as La Fortaleza, initially con-
structed between 1533 and 1540, also located 
in San Juan, is the oldest executive mansion 
in continuous use in the Americas; 
Whereas, on March 4, 1513, Juan Ponce de 
Leo´n, Puerto Rico’s first Governor and con-
quistador, departed from Puerto Rico to lead 
the first known expedition to what is now 
the State of Florida; 
Whereas Juan Ponce de Leo´n was interred 
in San Juan in 1521 and his tomb is now lo-
cated in the Cathedral of San Juan Bautista; 
Whereas the architectural and cultural 
heritage of San Juan has been recognized by 
the United Nations as a World Heritage Site 
and by the United States National Park 
Service with the establishment of the San 
Juan National Historic Site; 
Whereas the architectural and cultural 
heritage of San Juan includes the fortifica-
tions built between the 1500s and 1700s to 
protect San Juan against invading forces, in-
cluding Castillo San Felipe del Morro, most 
of the city walls, the San Juan Gate, Fort 
San Juan de la Cruz, and Fort San Cristo´bal, 
considered the largest fortress built in the 
Americas; 
Whereas these fortifications remained ac-
tive defenses of the United States Armed 
Forces until World War II; 
Whereas, on March 21, 1915, Lieutenant 
Teo´filo Marxuach, officer at El Morro Castle, 
ordered fire upon the German armed supply 
ship Odenwald trying to force its way out of 
San Juan Bay to deliver supplies to German 
submarines in the Atlantic Ocean, in what is 
considered to be the first shot fired by the 
regular Armed Forces of the United States 
against any ship flying the colors of the Cen-
tral Powers of World War I; 
Whereas, in 1946, Felisa Rinco´n de Gautier 
was appointed mayor of San Juan, making 
her the first woman mayor of a capital city 
in the Americas; 
Whereas, in 1959, San Juan was awarded 
the All-America City Award, an award given 
by the National Civic League, which recog-
nizes communities that leverage civic en-
gagement, collaboration, inclusiveness, and 
innovation to successfully address local 
issues; 
Whereas the ‘‘Escuelas Maternales’’, estab-
lished in San Juan by mayor Rinco´n de 
Gautier would eventually become the model 
for the Head Start programs in the United 
States; 
Whereas San Juan has hosted several 
major sporting events, including the— 
(1) 1966 Central American and Caribbean 
Games; 
(2) 1979 Pan American Games; 
(3) Baseball Winter League Caribbean 
World Series in 1950, 1954, 1958, 1971, 1975, 
1979, 1984, 1995, 1999, 2015, and 2020; 
(4) World Baseball Classic in 2006, 2009, and 
2013; 
(5) 1974 FIBA World Championship;

(6) FIBA Americas Championship in 1980, 
1993, 1999, 2003, and 2009; and 
(7) 2010 Latin American Regional Special 
Olympics; 
Whereas the city of San Juan is now a 
main center of industry, commerce, and cul-
ture and a touchstone of the culture of the 
Puerto Rican community across the United 
States and the world; and 
Whereas the city of San Juan will cele-
brate the quincentennial anniversary of the 
city from September 2021 to May 2022: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes the 500th anniversary of the 
founding of the city of San Juan, Puerto 
Rico; 
(2) honors the history of the city of San 
Juan, Puerto Rico; and 
(3) encourages the people of the United
