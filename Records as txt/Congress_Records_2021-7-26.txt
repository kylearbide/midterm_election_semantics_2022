Vol. 167 
WASHINGTON, MONDAY, JULY 26, 2021 
No. 130 
House of Representatives 
The House met at noon and was 
called to order by the Speaker pro tem-
pore (Ms. BARRAGA´ N).

DESIGNATION OF SPEAKER PRO 
TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker: 
WASHINGTON, DC, 
July 26, 2021. 
I hereby appoint the Honorable NANETTE 
DIAZ BARRAGA´ N to act as Speaker pro tem-
pore on this day. 
NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House of Representatives.

MORNING-HOUR DEBATE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the order of the House of Janu-
ary 4, 2021, the Chair will now recog-
nize Members from lists submitted by 
the majority and minority leaders for 
morning-hour debate. 
The Chair will alternate recognition 
between the parties, with time equally 
allocated between the parties and each 
Member other than the majority and 
minority leaders and the minority 
whip limited to 5 minutes, but in no 
event shall debate continue beyond 1:50

NOW IS TIME TO BACK THE BLUE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. JOYCE) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, across our country, parents 
are facing a new and scary reality this 
summer. As soccer camps and Little 
League games get back underway, 
there is a new and growing crime crisis 
that is threatening our communities. 
Just last week, President Biden made 
the extraordinarily false comment that 
crime is down. President Biden is 
wrong. We are seeing a rise in crime 
throughout American cities. 
In Philadelphia, there have been 315 
homicides this year, an increase of over 
35 percent from last year. This is unac-
ceptable. 
The people living in our communities 
deserve to feel safe. While families 
worry about the growing crime crisis, 
liberal leaders have turned their backs 
and failed to protect our neighbor-
hoods. 
Across the country, mayors and com-
munity leaders have condemned the po-
lice officers and joined protests calling 
to defund law enforcement. They have 
failed to support our police officers as 
the police officers are battling, first-
hand, this crime wave. This dangerous 
rhetoric makes our communities less 
safe. Now is definitely not the time to 
defund the police. 
Tragically, ambush-style attacks on 
law enforcement have increased 91 per-
cent since last year. These attacks 
have been deadly, and unfortunately, 
155 police officers have given their lives 
in the line of duty. 
This is not the time to play games, 
and this is not the time to cut funding 
for body armor and safety equipment 
that protect our officers who are on the 
front lines. 
Now more than ever, we must stand 
with our law enforcement officers. We 
must stand with our heroes to keep us 
safe each and every day. We must en-
sure that they have the tools and the 
training to protect themselves from 
harm while they protect us and protect 
our communities. 
Now is the time to back the blue. 
Now is the time to support our law 
enforcement. 
Now is the time to speak out against 
the dangerous rhetoric that puts the 
lives of the men and women in blue in 
danger. 
A NATION IN FINANCIAL 
JEOPARDY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. MURPHY) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, we could talk about 
so many things today on how the 
Democrats are tearing this Nation 
apart: the immigration crisis, the at-
tack on the American family, the de-
struction 
of 
race 
relations, 
sky-
rocketing crime because of the defund 
the police movement. 
Madam Speaker, I could go on and 
on. But today, we will talk about the 
financial disaster that the Biden ad-
ministration is causing. 
There is no doubt that the Demo-
crats’ outrageous, reckless, and out-of- 
control spending is putting our Nation 
in financial jeopardy. However, I can-
not help but notice that Democrats in 
this Chamber systematically fail to ad-
dress the deeply personal and palpable 
impact of this administration’s finan-
cial irresponsibility. 
To my colleagues across the aisle, 
please understand that inflation is se-
verely hurting American families and 
their ability to create and sustain fi-
nancial security. 
Over the weekend, I spoke to a res-
taurant owner who told me that due to 
soaring costs of goods and services, he 
will have to raise prices to make ends 
meet. I have many constituents on 
fixed incomes who tell me that they 
are having to eliminate food off their 
grocery lists in order to afford family 
meals. 
Skyrocketing costs present a serious 
problem for American families and 
workers, and under this administra-
tion, costs do not seem to be going 
down anytime soon. 
In fact, inflation has increased every 
single month since Joe Biden took of-
fice. Gas prices are at their highest

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3850 
July 26, 2021 
level since 2014. Thirteen million indi-
viduals are still on some type of unem-
ployment, while over 9 million jobs re-
main unfilled. 
This type of scenario is essentially 
unheard of and totally artificially cre-
ated by the Biden administration. They 
failed to get the $15 minimum wage, so 
now they have artificially cut the 
American workforce in an attempt to 
force wages upward. Such a forced, 
quick increase in wages will undoubt-
edly be inflationary as small busi-
nesses, and even large fast food chains, 
will have to raise their prices just to 
maintain viability. 
Do they think the American people 
are that stupid? Endless borrowing has 
consequences. Republican lawmakers 
see this every day as ordinary Ameri-
cans are having to bear the cost of ex-
cessive Democrat spending. At the gas 
pump, in the grocery store, at the mall, 
and at the car dealership, my constitu-
ents are having to spend more of their 
hard-earned dollars just to get to work, 
feed their children, and care for loved 
ones. 
The numbers don’t lie. According to 
the Bureau of Labor Statistics, gas 
prices are up 45 percent from last year; 
used car prices are up 45 percent; air-
fare is up 24 percent; and hotel prices 
are up 16 percent. At the grocery store, 
bacon is up 8 percent; fruit prices are 
up 7 percent; fish prices are up 6 per-
cent; and milk is up 5 percent. Even to 
pour a cup of coffee, Americans are 
feeling the cost of the Democrats’ 
reckless spending spree. 
Unfortunately, under Biden’s leader-
ship, the situation looks bleak. House 
Democrats are well accustomed to 
spending beyond their means, but they 
routinely ignore its negative impact on 
the American people. 
What is worse is that experts agree 
the Democrats’ far-left proposals will 
undoubtedly lead to higher taxes on 
the 
vast 
majority 
of 
middle-class 
American families. 
Here is what we know. A recent re-
port from the Tax Policy Center found 
that Biden’s tax plan will increase 
taxes on an astounding 75 percent of 
middle-class Americans and raise taxes 
on 95 percent of Americans by 2031. 
This broken policy work has real con-
sequences 
that 
are 
completely 
unsustainable. 
Another 
study 
by 
the 
Wharton 
School of Business shows that Biden’s 
$6 trillion budget would slow economic 
growth, shrink the American economy, 
and cut workers’ hours and wages. In 
fact, annualized real wages are already 
down by 3.95 percent since 2020. 
Madam Speaker, I implore my col-
leagues across the aisle to listen to 
their constituents and sympathize with 
what they are going through. More 
than that, I urge them to recognize 
that we, as lawmakers, have a respon-
sibility to care for our citizens and en-
sure that Big Government policies do 
not squander American families and 
small businesses. 
Look, this should be simple. All 
Americans understand that to stay fi-
nancially viable and intact, they must 
stick to a budget and spend within 
their means. 
I encourage the Biden administration 
and its Democratic cohorts in the 
House to balance their own checkbooks 
immediately for the sake of the Amer-
ican people and to stop this reckless 
spending spree.

ant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
O Lord our God, as we set our sights 
on the week ahead, we do so with a cer-
tain degree of anticipation and anx-
iety. There is much to discuss, many 
concerns to address, and a wide array 
of perspectives to consider. 
By Your gracious guidance, as You 
lead us into these next couple days, 
call us to pay attention to Your inimi-
table wisdom, to turn our ears to Your 
words, that we would keep them within 
our hearts. 
Above all else, may each of us keep 
watch over our innermost souls, know-
ing that everything we do reflects its 
integrity. 
Keep our mouths from perversity and 
corrupt talk from our lips. 
But remind us to look straight ahead 
with purpose, fixing our gaze, today 
and throughout the week, on the goals 
You would have us reach. 
And may we be intent on taking heed 
of Your direction. 
May we be steadfast in all we do. 
May we be worthy of this place in 
time to serve You, this country, and 
our communities. 
In the strength of Your name we 
pray. 
Amen.

THE JOURNAL 
The SPEAKER. Pursuant to section 
11(a) of House Resolution 188, the Jour-
nal of the last day’s proceedings is ap-
proved.

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman 
from Michigan (Mr. LEVIN) come for-
ward and lead the House in the Pledge 
of Allegiance. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan led the 
Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
The SPEAKER. The Chair will enter-
tain up to 15 requests for 1-minute 
speeches on each side of the aisle. 
f 
IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CRISIS 
(Mrs. DINGELL asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I 
stood here nearly a month ago to de-
liver a very similar message: once-in-a- 
lifetime storms are becoming our re-
ality in Michigan. 
In the last month, southeast Michi-
gan has flooded three times in the city 
of Dearborn, nearly 20,000 homes have 
been impacted. My constituents can’t 
recover from one flood before it wors-
ens and another one hits and there is 
more damaged property, more lost 
valuables. 
People are angry. People are scared. 
And they have every right to be. That 
is because we have known the solution 
to these disasters for a while. The time 
for climate action is now. This starts 
with investing in resilient infrastruc-
ture to protect our communities from 
the impacts of climate crisis. 
We need to invest in infrastructure 
that can withstand natural disasters 
and make it easier on the American 
people to recover. We can’t continue to 
have these floods couched as once-in-a- 
lifetime, if you call them that, when 
people are dealing with unimaginable 
damages in my city for the third time 
in 4 weeks. 
We need a strong infrastructure 
package that takes bold action and ad-
dresses change head-on. 
f 
BIDEN BORDER CRISIS 
(Mr. NEHLS asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. NEHLS. Mr. Speaker, it is nearly 
August, a full 7 months since the Biden 
administration assumed control of the 
White House, and still there is no end 
in sight for the Biden border crisis. 
It has been a month since Biden bor-
der czar, KAMALA HARRIS, hopped off of 
her jet for 90 minutes for a photo shoot 
near the border, which she dubbed as a 
southern border visit, and still nothing 
has changed. 
March was the highest month on 
record for illegal crossings until April. 
April was the highest month on record 
for illegal crossings until May. May 
was the highest month on record for il-
legal crossings until June. And we are 
on pace to set another record in July. 
How many records must be broken, 
crimes committed, victims trafficked 
before the Biden administration wakes

up to the roaring crisis at our southern 
border? 
The American people are sick and 
tired of the talk. They are sick and 
tired of excuses. They are sick and 
tired of the political games. Enough is 
enough. Secure the southern border. 
f 
D.C. STATEHOOD 
(Ms. NORTON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, with a 
detailed poll showing that 54 percent of 
the 
American 
people 
now 
support 
statehood for our Nation’s capital, the 
District of Columbia, we are optimistic 
about passage in the Senate of H.R. 51. 
I thank the House for passage of our 
statehood bill, for that passage has 
spurred the American majority that 
now supports D.C. statehood. The re-
cent hearing in the Senate helped fur-
ther educate Americans about our 
statehood bill, noting that our country 
is the only democratic country that de-
nies equal representation for the people 
of its capital. 
With continuing success with our 
D.C. statehood bill, we look forward to 
reporting progress on our bill on be-
coming the State of Washington, Doug-
lass Commonwealth. 
f 
RECOGNIZING ERIN KERKHOFF 
(Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize a young 
woman in my district who has become 
an inspiration to women and athletes 
everywhere. 
Erin Kerkhoff, a University of North-
ern Iowa sophomore and track star 
from Solon High School, earned a posi-
tion on Team USA for the Paralympics 
in Tokyo. 
Kerkhoff, who has 20/400 vision due to 
optic nerve degeneration in both eyes 
is ranked fifth in the world in the 400- 
meter dash after achieving a personal 
record of 58.23 seconds in the qualifying 
trials earlier this month, finishing sec-
ond overall in both the 400- and 100- 
meter dashes. 
The Second District and the State of 
Iowa are lucky to be represented by 
stellar athletes like Erin, Thomas Gil-
man, and Kenny Bednarek competing 
in this year’s summer Olympics. 
I could not be prouder to represent 
these three in Congress. Good luck 
Erin, Thomas, and Kenny, and bring 
home the gold. 
Last week, I wished my sister Mari- 
Eleanor Martino a happy birthday, and 
this week I would like to extend a 
happy birthday to her husband, Ralph 
Martino. Happy birthday, Ralph, and 
we are delighted to have you in the 
family. 
RACIAL EQUITY IN AMERICA JOBS 
AND FAMILY PLAN 
(Ms. PLASKETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, the 
Biden administration’s proposed $2.65 
trillion American Jobs Plan contains a 
commitment of resources and invest-
ments to overcome structural eco-
nomic inequity, driven by decades of 
racial and gender discrimination and 
exclusion. 
In addition to being undercapitalized 
by the PPP in the midst of the COVID– 
19 pandemic, Black business owners ex-
perienced an acute decline of 41 percent 
in their numbers; Latinx businesses fell 
by 32 percent; Asian businesses, 26 per-
cent. Compounding these inequities, 
Black, Indigenous, and people of color, 
particularly, women of color, have been 
hardest hit by unemployment and job 
losses. 
These groups have been left behind 
and held back for far too long, result-
ing 
in 
multigenerational 
poverty, 
wage, and wealth gaps. To meet the 
moment, House Democrats are pro-
posing systemic solutions rooted in eq-
uity to ensure prosperity for all Ameri-
cans. These solutions are driven by tar-
geted, long-term investments to im-
prove our infrastructure by igniting 
our economy for equity, baking in ac-
countability to equitable practices and 
outcomes and fostering an ecosystem 
where the safety, health, and well- 
being of the people are a priority. 
f 
DOOR-TO-DOOR IN ORWELLIAN 
FASHION 
(Mr. BIGGS asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, Biden’s 
team of neighborhood, basically, dis-
turbers, showed up at a constituent’s 
house this past weekend demanding 
that they reveal their vaccine status, 
after asking for them by name. 
Our agents on the border cannot test 
the tens of thousands that are being re-
leased into the country on a monthly 
basis, and tens of thousands are going 
in without COVID testing and without 
vaccines. But Biden-Harris, the first 
President with a hyphenated named, is 
going door-to-door in an Orwellian 
fashion to pester Americans about vac-
cines. 
Welcome to the authoritarian turn of 
the new Democrat party. 
f 
2020 ELECTION 
(Mr. JEFFRIES asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, is any-
one else tired of hearing the insurrec-
tionist in Chief continue to lie about 
the 2020 election? 
Over the weekend, once again, the 
former, twice-impeached, disgraced, so- 
called President of the United States of 
America, falsely claimed that he actu-
ally won the election, and that it was 
stolen from him by Joe Biden. 
Something is really wrong with this 
guy. And I need some help in trying to 
figure it out. 
Is Donald Trump, A, a pathological 
liar; 
B, a sociopath; 
C, a malignant narcissist; or 
D, all of the above? 
I will be around all week. Look for-
ward to hearing from you.

SIONS.— 
‘‘(A) REQUEST TO RECONSIDER.—In any case 
where the Secretary has determined that a 
recipient of a grant under this subpart has 
failed or refused to comply with the service 
obligation in the agreement under sub-
section (b) and has converted the grant into 
a Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan 
under part D in accordance with paragraph 
(1), (including a TEACH Grant converted to a 
loan prior to the date of enactment of the 
Consider Teachers Act of 2021 and including 
cases where such loans have been fully or 
partially paid), the recipient may request 
that the Secretary reconsider such initial de-
termination and may submit additional in-
formation to demonstrate satisfaction of the 
service obligation. Upon receipt of such a re-
quest, the Secretary shall reconsider the de-
termination in accordance with this para-
graph not later than 90 days after the date 
that such request was received. 
‘‘(B) RECONSIDERATION.—If, in reconsid-
ering an initial determination under sub-
paragraph (A) (including reconsideration re-
lated to a TEACH Grant that was converted 
to a loan prior to the date of enactment of 
the Consider Teachers Act of 2021 and includ-
ing cases where such loans were fully or par-
tially paid), the Secretary determines that 
the reason for such determination was the 
recipient’s failure to timely submit a certifi-
cation required under subsection (b)(1)(D) (as 
in effect on the day before the date of enact-
ment of the Consider Teachers Act of 2021), 
an error or processing delay by the Sec-
retary, a change to the fields considered eli-
gible for fulfillment of the service obligation 
(as described in subsection (b)(1)(C)), a re-
cipient having previously requested to have 
the TEACH Grant converted to a loan, or an-
other valid reason determined by the Sec-
retary, and that the recipient has, as of the 
date of the reconsideration, demonstrated 
that the recipient did meet, or is meeting 
the service obligation in the agreement 
under subsection (b), the Secretary shall— 
‘‘(i) discharge the Federal Direct Unsub-
sidized Stafford Loan under part D, and rein-
state the recipient’s grant under this sub-
part; 
‘‘(ii) discharge any interest or fees that 
may have accumulated during the period 
that the grant was converted to a Federal 
Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan under 
part D; 
‘‘(iii) if the recipient has other loans under 
part D, apply any payments made for the 
Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan 
under part D during such period to those 
other loans under part D; 
‘‘(iv) if the recipient does not have other 
loans under part D, reimburse the recipient 
for any amounts paid on the Federal Direct 
Unsubsidized Stafford Loan under part D 
during such period; 
‘‘(v) request that consumer reporting agen-
cies remove any negative credit reporting 
due to the conversion of the TEACH Grant to 
a loan; and 
‘‘(vi) use the additional information pro-
vided under subparagraph (A) to determine 
the progress the recipient has made in meet-
ing the service obligation. 
‘‘(C) EXTENSION OF TIME TO COMPLETE SERV-
ICE OBLIGATION.—In the case of a recipient 
whose TEACH Grant was reinstated in ac-
cordance with subparagraph (B), the Sec-
retary shall, upon such reinstatement— 
‘‘(i) extend the time remaining for the re-
cipient to fulfill the service obligation de-
scribed in subsection (b)(1) to a period of 
time equal to— 
‘‘(I) 8 years; minus 
‘‘(II) the number of full academic years of 
teaching that the recipient completed prior 
to the reconversion of the loan to a TEACH 
Grant under subparagraph (B), including any 
years of qualifying teaching completed dur-
ing the period when the TEACH Grant was in 
loan status; and 
‘‘(ii) treat any full academic years of 
teaching described in clause (i)(II) as years 
that count toward the individual’s service 
obligation (regardless of whether the TEACH 
Grant funds were in grant or loan status) if 
that time otherwise meets the requirements 
of this section.’’; and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3853 
July 26, 2021 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on S. 848, 
the Consider Teachers Act of 2021. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Virginia? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of S. 848, the Consider Teachers Act, in-
troduced 
by 
Senators 
BRAUN
and 
SINEMA in the Senate, and led by Dele-
gate HOLMES NORTON and Representa-
tive SPARTZ in the House. 
High quality teachers are the back-
bone of our Nation’s education system. 
Yet, since even before the COVID–19 
pandemic, 
communities 
across 
the 
country, particularly low-income com-
munities, have faced a growing short-
age of educators. 
b 1415 
To address this shortage, the Teacher 
Education Assistance for College and 
Higher Education grant program, or 
the TEACH grant program, offers up-
front grant aid to incentivize individ-
uals to pursue teaching and serve in 
low-income communities. 
Since 2007 these grants have helped 
people across the country become high- 
quality teachers in the communities 
where they are needed most. However, 
administrative issues with the program 
have inadvertently converted thou-
sands of these grants into loans which 
must be paid back with interest. Ac-
cording to an investigative report in 
2016, upwards of 63 percent of TEACH 
grants had been converted to loans, 
leaving badly needed teachers with 
burdensome debt. 
The bipartisan bill we are consid-
ering today addresses these issues in 
two key ways: First, it implements a 
reconsideration 
process 
to 
ensure 
TEACH grant recipients do not see 
their grants converted into loans by 
mistake; and, second, the bill creates 
flexibility so that teachers can still 
fulfill the grant’s requirements in light 
of school closures and disruptions 
caused by the pandemic. 
Simply put, the Consider Teachers 
Act is a bipartisan legislative fix which 
will ensure TEACH grants can continue 
to strengthen and expand our Nation’s 
teacher workforce. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support the bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. SPARTZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the 
Consider Teachers Act. When created, 
the TEACH grant program was to sup-
port students interested in becoming 
teachers. Unfortunately, the grant pro-
gram has run into administrative chal-
lenges brought on by clerical and pa-
perwork issues. Because of these issues, 
approximately two-thirds of all TEACH 
grants are converting into Federal stu-
dent loans. 
To address these inadvertent errors, 
the Consider Teachers Act reforms the 
program to ensure that teachers are 
not indebted due to simple mistakes. 
First, the legislation gives grant re-
cipients the ability to reverse a conver-
sion and eases the timeline for when 
the grant recipients must certify their 
employment with the Department of 
Education. 
Second, the bill also extends the time 
grant recipients have to fulfill their 
service obligation in response to the 
challenges posed by the pandemic. The 
pandemic upended all of our lives, and 
teachers who lost their job shouldn’t be 
unfairly punished for circumstances 
outside of their control. 
Mr. Speaker, with the TEACH grant 
program, 
the 
Federal 
Government 
made a commitment to future teach-
ers, and the Consider Teachers Act ful-
fills the original promise of the pro-
gram. I urge all Members to support 
this bill, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield such time as she may consume 
to the gentlewoman from the District 
of Columbia (Ms. NORTON). 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my good friend for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of S. 848, the Consider Teachers Act of 
2021. I introduced the companion bill 
with Congresswoman VICTORIA SPARTZ. 
I would like to thank Senators MIKE 
BRAUN and KYRSTEN SINEMA also for 
their leadership on this bill, and my 
good friend, Chairman BOBBY SCOTT, 
for bringing this bill to the floor today. 
This bill would improve the service 
obligation verification process for the 
Teacher Education Assistance for Col-
lege and Higher Education Grant Pro-
gram, or TEACH grant program, as it 
is called. The TEACH grant program 
was created to attract the best and 
brightest to the teaching profession in 
underserved communities. The TEACH 
grant program provides up to $4,000 a 
year in grants to students who agree to 
serve for at least 4 years as full-time 
teachers in a high-need field in a public 
or private elementary or secondary 
school that serves low-income families. 
The obligation to teach 4 years must be 
completed within an 8-year period. 
Those who do not fulfill their service 
requirement have their grants con-
verted into Federal direct unsubsidized 
Stafford loans which must be paid back 
with interest. These loans cannot re-
vert to grants. 
According to the Office of Manage-
ment and Budget, 66 percent of the 
grants 
are 
converted 
into 
loans. 
Though 21,000 grant recipients have 
completed the program without con-
version, 94,000 recipients have had their 
grants converted to loans. Those con-
versions are often triggered by small 
paperwork issues, such as submitting 
the annual form 1 day late or missing 
a date or signature. 
In 2018, the U.S. Department of Edu-
cation released a reconsideration proc-
ess for recipients who had their grants 
converted into loans but had either ful-
filled, or could still fulfill, their service 
obligations. 
The 
department 
also 
turned back the clock to allow teach-
ers who had left the TEACH grant pro-
gram once their grants were converted 
to loans to give them more time to 
complete 
their 
service 
obligations. 
These changes allowed the department 
to lift the debt of 2,300 recipients. 
I am pleased that the department 
made additional improvements to the 
program on July 1, 2021, including 
opening the reconsideration process to 
all TEACH grant program recipients. 
This bill would codify some of these 
changes, creating a safeguard from 
changes in department leadership. 
This bill would also outline yearly 
deadlines 
and 
notification 
require-
ments to rectify some of the TEACH 
grant program’s previous administra-
tive mishaps. Furthermore, with the 
onset of the coronavirus pandemic, 
many recipients have had trouble find-
ing qualifying work. This bill would 
create a grace period for those individ-
uals by extending the service obliga-
tion fulfillment period by 3 years for 
anyone who was fulfilling their obliga-
tions when the coronavirus pandemic 
began. 
This past year has given us all a hard 
lesson in the invaluable service that 
teachers and educators provide to our 
society. As many young students have 
turned to homeschooling and remote 
learning, we have all come to appre-
ciate the hard work and incredible tal-
ent of our teachers who foster the men-
tal, physical, and emotional growth of 
our children every day. This bill en-
sures that that pipeline of talent for 
the teaching profession remains strong 
and that we do not unduly burden 
TEACH grant program recipients who 
have dedicated themselves to serving 
our most vulnerable communities. 
I understand what that means be-
cause my own mother, Vela Holmes, 
was a teacher in the D.C. Public 
Schools. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my col-
leagues to support this bipartisan bill. 
Mrs. SPARTZ. In closing, Mr. Speak-
er, the TEACH grant program fails too 
many of our teachers, and it needs to 
be fixed. It is important that our Fed-
eral Government honors its promises. 
The Consider Teachers Act creates 
flexibility and streamlines processes. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to 
vote in favor of this bill. Strong teach-
ers are essential for high-quality learn-
ing. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to reiterate 
again my thanks to Representative 
SPARTZ and Delegate NORTON for work-
ing across the aisle on this bipartisan 
priority in the House. 
As my colleagues have reiterated, the 
TEACH grant program is supposed to

help prepare high quality and diverse 
educators for our Nation’s underserved 
students. Today it is critical that the 
TEACH grant program actually works 
as intended as we recover from a global 
health emergency that cost education 
jobs, exacerbated achievement gaps, 
and worsened the teacher shortage in 
many States and districts. That is why 
we must ensure that Federal initia-
tives to strengthen the teacher work-
force make it easier, not harder, for in-
dividuals to enter the teaching profes-
sion. 
The Consider Teaching Act would 
help achieve this goal by ensuring that 
TEACH grants do not have the unin-
tended effect of leaving educators with 
burdensome loans. This simple yet ur-
gent step will allow prospective teach-
ers across the country to continue ac-
cessing the resources they need to pur-
sue careers in teaching. 
Importantly, this bill is an oppor-
tunity to demonstrate that regardless 
of party affiliation, each of us in Con-
gress shares a commitment to improv-
ing the quality of education by invest-
ing in well-prepared teachers. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues, 
again, to support the bill and vote for 
the Consider Teachers Act. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance

question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. 
SCOTT) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, S. 848. 
The question was taken.

opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, on that I

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. CASTRO) and the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL) each will 
control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. CASTRO). 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on S. 1828. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Texas? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of S. 1828, the HAVANA Act of 2021, and 
I urge my colleagues to support its pas-
sage. 
America’s diplomats and intelligence 
professionals are the best in the world, 
dedicating their lives to public service 
to protect the American people and 
promote the interests of the United 
States. 
As citizens, we are in their debt. As 
lawmakers, we also have a responsi-
bility to protect their health and safe-
ty, making sure that they have the re-
sources they need to do their jobs effec-
tively and providing them with the 
necessary support if they are harmed 
in the line of duty. 
That is why the HAVANA Act is such 
a critical piece of legislation. The inci-
dents behind the so-called Havana syn-
drome are still under investigation and 
have affected American personnel at 
U.S. missions around the world, from 
Cuba, where the incidents first sur-
faced, and then reportedly to China, 
Europe, Central Asia, and even poten-
tially here in Washington, D.C. It is 
imperative that the State Department, 
working in conjunction with the intel-
ligence community, the Department of 
Defense, and other interagency part-
ners and allies, get to the bottom of 
what caused these events, how best to 
deter them from happening in the fu-
ture, and how best to protect our peo-
ple. 
While I am confident that the Biden 
administration is working hard to ad-
vance these investigations, Congress 
must also do its part, especially when 
it comes to helping those who have 
been directly impacted. 
The HAVANA Act ensures that the 
United States’ diplomats and intel-
ligence professionals are appropriately 
taken care of and compensated for in-
juries they incurred in connection with 
these events, fixing an important gap 
in existing law. I am very glad this im-
portant legislation will provide nec-
essary supplemental funds to those 
who have been affected while in no way 
touching on any other benefits that 
come with Federal employment. This 
is a good, bipartisan measure, and I 
commend our Senate colleagues, espe-
cially Senators Collins and MARK WAR-
NER, for sending it over to us in the 
House today. 
The HAVANA Act, which the Senate 
unanimously passed, is the companion 
to legislation that Chairman ADAM 
SCHIFF introduced alongside Chairman 
GREGORY MEEKS. As the only Demo-
cratic Member who serves on both the

July 26, 2021 
Permanent Select Committee on Intel-
ligence and the Committee on Foreign 
Affairs, I deeply appreciate the con-
tributions and sacrifices of our dip-
lomats and intelligence professionals 
who are working hard to defend our na-
tional security. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support the HAVANA Act, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
b 1430 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
around 
the 
world, 
America and American personnel are 
being attacked in their homes, in ho-
tels, and even on public streets. For 
most, it starts with what seems like a 
loud noise that is followed by pain or a 
sense of pressure in the head. Many are 
left with chronic damage, including 
hearing loss, vertigo, cognitive and 
motor impairment, severe headaches, 
and inability to sleep. 
In the words of a recent press report, 
our diplomats are suffering a ‘‘concus-
sion without a concussion.’’ 
The Senate-passed bill before us 
today provides important authority to 
assist these brain injury victims, and it 
deserves our unanimous support. But 
we all must do more. 
Unfortunately, these attacks have 
continued and spread. First, it started 
in Havana in late 2016 and spread to 
China in 2017. Two months ago, press 
reports described more than 130 pos-
sible cases all over the world, including 
right here in Washington, D.C. Just 
last week, two dozen new cases among 
U.S. personnel in Vienna were revealed. 
Simply put, this is kind of scary stuff. 
The people who serve our Nation 
overseas are generally worried for 
themselves and their families, and they 
need to know that we have their backs. 
When the prior administration pulled 
our personnel out of Havana 4 years 
ago, they said: ‘‘Numerous Embassy 
Havana employees have been targeted 
in specific attacks. These employees 
have suffered significant injuries as a 
consequence of these attacks.’’ 
In contrast, President Biden has re-
fused to call these what they are, at-
tacks on U.S. personnel. Secretary of 
State Tony Blinken publicly said per-
haps no one is responsible for causing 
these injuries. 
I will tell you, from my briefings and 
briefings in another annex, that is ab-
solutely incorrect. We may not be able 
to fill in all the blanks yet, but we 
know too much to dismiss these at-
tacks as unexplained health incidents. 
Four years ago, medical experts con-
vened by the State Department agreed 
victims were likely dealing with brain 
trauma from a nonnatural source, and 
the evidence has only grown more con-
clusive since then. Last year, the Na-
tional Academy of Sciences said that 
directed, pulsed radio frequency energy 
is most likely the cause. According to 
the NAS, the situation raises grave 
concerns about bad actors who may 
have weapons. 
While we must assist victims with to-
day’s bill, we must do more. We must 
call these heinous attacks what they 
are. They are attacks, and the people 
attacking us need to know the con-
sequences will be severe when we find 
out who they are and when we get the 
attribution. Otherwise, we aren’t doing 
what we can do to deter future attacks. 
The men and women who serve our Na-
tion overseas deserve no less. 
I have prepared a bill to do just that, 
which I will be introducing this week. 
I thank Chairman MEEKS and our In-
telligence Committee colleagues for 
their bipartisan work on the HAVANA 
Act, which I strongly support. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. SCHIFF), the chairman 
of the House Permanent Select Com-
mittee on Intelligence. 
(Mr. SCHIFF asked and was given 
permission to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of the HAVANA Act. 
I was proud to introduce this legisla-
tion in the House, and I appreciate the 
continued support from Ranking Mem-
ber 
NUNES, 
Chairman 
MEEKS, 
and 
Ranking Member MCCAUL in moving 
this legislation through the House and 
to the President’s desk. 
Every day, thousands of patriotic 
Americans serve our country abroad, 
representing our values and interests 
across the globe. They are diplomats, 
soldiers, 
intelligence 
officers, 
and 
more. But we must never forget they 
are also mothers and fathers, sisters 
and brothers, and sons and daughters 
who routinely make tremendous per-
sonal sacrifices in service of their 
country. 
In return for their service to our Na-
tion, we have a sacred responsibility to 
make sure that we take care of them. 
That is what this bill does. 
Over the past several years, public 
servants from the intelligence commu-
nity and elsewhere have experienced 
symptoms of unknown origins. These 
cases, which have been described as Ha-
vana syndrome or anomalous health in-
cidents, named for the cohort whose 
symptoms onset in Havana, remain a 
mystery. 
But two things are clear. First, we 
must spare no effort to identify their 
source and to hold anyone responsible 
accountable. Second, we must ensure 
that those who are injured receive the 
highest quality of care and the benefits 
that they need as they recover. 
The HAVANA Act does just that. It 
would adjust and expand the authority 
we gave to the intelligence community 
and the State Department in 2019 to 
provide compensation for those experi-
encing these injuries to also include 
those suffering from traumatic brain 
injuries. Members of both parties have 
united behind this critical legislation 
to provide benefits to afflicted individ-
uals. 
Even as we pass this legislation, our 
work is not done. On a bipartisan basis, 
the Intelligence Committee has contin-
ued to provide vigorous oversight of 
how 
individuals 
experiencing 
these 
health incidents were treated and how 
they are being treated today. We will 
continue to prioritize this issue and 
put our people first. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues, 
Mr. CASTRO and Mr. MCCAUL, for their 
efforts. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
NUNES), the ranking member of the 
Permanent Select Committee on Intel-
ligence and the coauthor of the House 
version of this bill. 
Mr. NUNES. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Texas for his work 
on this bill and my colleagues on the 
Senate side and the House side. 
I rise in strong support of this legis-
lation. When intelligence community 
officers risk their health and safety in 
service of their country, they need to 
know they will receive the full support 
of the United States Government if 
they are injured. That assurance is cru-
cial for the officers’ ability to carry 
out their missions. 
As the public now knows, our officers 
have been the victims of targeted at-
tacks around the globe. I want to say 
upfront that these incidents are real, 
and the officers’ accounts are credible. 
Victims have described the sudden 
onset of symptoms, such as intense 
head pressure, dizziness, vertigo, and 
cognitive difficulties. Some incidents 
have resulted in traumatic brain inju-
ries, debilitating pain, and other seri-
ous health issues. Many victims con-
tinue to experience chronic health 
problems and require sustained treat-
ment. 
Over the past several months, we 
have been looking into these incidents. 
In my view, there are three objectives. 
The first is to determine the best way 
to help these officers and their fami-
lies. The second is to find out who is 
perpetrating these attacks. The third 
is to conduct strong oversight of our 
agencies 
and 
make 
the 
necessary 
changes to achieve the first two objec-
tives. That will require vigorous effort, 
but I am committed to uncovering the 
truth. 
The bill we are considering today 
takes important steps to assist the vic-
tims of these attacks and ensure that 
our people will be compensated for 
their brain injuries. It builds on legis-
lation we passed last Congress to im-
prove worker’s compensation for cer-
tain personnel and their dependents. 
Some have called the legislation 
technical, which it is, but it is, never-
theless, 
vital. 
Patriotic 
Americans 
serving to promote and protect our 
freedoms deserve our gratitude and full 
support. 
The Senate has already passed this 
bill by unanimous consent. I fully sup-
port it, and I urge my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle to do the same.

H3857 
July 26, 2021 
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
have no further requests at this time, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I am pre-
pared to close, and I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
First, I thank the chairman of the 
House Intelligence Committee and the 
ranking member, Mr. NUNES, for their 
strong support of this bill. It is very 
important. 
I will be introducing a bill next week 
on this, and I hope to work with the 
House Intelligence Committee on that 
as well. 
I am very concerned the administra-
tion may be planning to send U.S. per-
sonnel back to our Havana Embassy. I 
just got off of a big rally across the 
street from the White House with a lot 
of Cubans. They are searching for free-
dom and democracy over tyranny, op-
pression, and communism. 
But our personnel, we can’t send 
them back until we can say who or 
what caused these brain injuries that 
prompted the Trump administration to 
pull our people out of there for their 
own safety in 2017. 
Over these last few weeks, the world 
has watched Cuba’s brutal police state 
in action. The Venezuelan military is 
there as well, silencing people just for 
exercising freedom of speech, which 
they don’t have under a communist 
dictatorship. 
The same surveillance system that 
tracks dissidents and censors the inter-
net has been unwilling to share nec-
essary information about these attacks 
against Americans. I have no doubt 
that Cuban intelligence is involved in 
this. 
If the administration sends U.S. per-
sonnel back to Havana without holding 
the regime accountable, all American 
diplomats are at risk. 
Again, I support this bipartisan HA-
VANA Act. I urge my colleagues to 
support it as well. I think these men 
and women, both State Department 
diplomats and our intelligence officers, 
deserve better from our Nation. They 
need to receive the proper care that 
they deserve. 
Again, I thank Chairman MEEKS and 
the Intelligence Committee, and I look 
forward to its passage. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself as much time as I may 
consume for the purpose of closing. 
Mr. Speaker, I believe it is impera-
tive that we, as the elected representa-
tives of the American people, working 
with the executive branch, get to the 
bottom of exactly who is behind these 
events, why they are occurring, and 
how to stop them. 
But we must also make sure to do 
our part to take care of the public serv-
ants who put themselves on the line 
every day for our own interests. 
I want to say thank you to the Presi-
dent, to the Secretary of State, and to 
the State Department for taking these 
cases seriously, for listening to the 
families and all the trauma that they 
have gone through, and for showing 
them nothing but the utmost respect. 
This bill is an excellent contribution 
to this effort, and I look forward to 
working on a bipartisan basis on this 
critical issue going forward. 
I thank Chairman SCHIFF for his hard 
work, and I ask all of my colleagues to 
support this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Texas (Mr. CAS-
TRO) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, S. 1828. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

sites of the September 11 attack: the 
World Trade Center in New York; the 
Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia; and 
the 
Flight 
93 
Memorial 
near 
Shanksville, Pennsylvania. 
As we approach the 20th anniversary 
of this horrific act of terrorism, this 
bill would honor the memory of the 
nearly 3,000 Americans who lost their 
lives and would serve as a lasting re-
minder of the heroism and persever-
ance of our Nation’s first responders. 
I thank Representative CONNOLLY for 
introducing this important legislation, 
and I urge my colleagues to support 
this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
b 1445 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, this year, as the gentle-
woman pointed out, marks the 20th an-
niversary of the terrorist attacks of 
September 11. While almost two dec-
ades have passed since that tragic day, 
we will never forget the thousands of 
innocent people who lost their lives 
and the brave first responders who put 
their lives on the line in our country’s 
time of need. 
Memorials have been established na-
tionwide to honor the victims and first 
responders who were killed in the at-
tacks, including the National 9/11 Pen-
tagon Memorial in Virginia, the Flight 
93 National Memorial in Pennsylvania, 
and the National September 11 Memo-
rial & Museum in New York. 
H.R. 2278, offered by Congressman 
CONNOLLY, authorizes the Secretary of 
the Interior to designate a memorial 
trail, approximately 1,300 miles in 
length, to link the three existing Sep-
tember 11 memorials in Virginia, New 
York, and Pennsylvania. The tour 
route will intersect Delaware, Mary-
land, New Jersey, New York, Pennsyl-
vania, Virginia, and Washington, D.C., 
and will be administered by the Na-
tional Park Service. 
This bill will help preserve the mem-
ory of the 2,977 innocent people who 
lost their lives on 9/11 and ensure that 
we never forget the horrors of that 
fateful day. I hope it also serves as 
some solace to the families of the vic-
tims, who can use this trail to remem-
ber and honor their lost loved ones. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
5 minutes to the gentleman from Vir-
ginia (Mr. CONNOLLY), the author of 
this important piece of legislation. 
Mr. 
CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my dear friend, Congresswoman 
DINGELL, for her support, and the dis-
tinguished ranking member, the Re-
publican manager, for his support. 
In a troubled time, when we seem 
like we can’t get together, here is an 
opportunity to come together, as we 
did 20 years ago on September 11. 
I rise in support of H.R. 2278, desig-
nating the September 11th National 
Memorial Trail Route, a 1,300-mile sys-
tem of trails and roadways that con-
nect all three sites attacked on Sep-
tember 11, 2001: The World Trade Cen-
ter in New York, the Pentagon here in 
Washington, D.C., and the Flight 93 
Memorial near Shanksville, Pennsyl-
vania. 
As our Nation prepares for the 20th 
anniversary of September 11, we have 
an opportunity to create a lasting leg-
acy connecting all three sites. 
The trail provides trail-goers with a 
chance to reflect and learn about our 
Nation’s resilience and perseverance 
following that dreadful day. 
In addition to the three 9/11 memo-
rials anchoring this route, travelers 
can learn about our founding with 
stops at Valley Forge National Histor-
ical Park and Independence Hall in 
Philadelphia or visit the Antietam Na-
tional Battlefield or the Gettysburg 
National Military Park to remember 
some of the other darkest days in our 
Nation’s history. 
This trail route connects travelers 
with these points in our history and 
majestic landscapes, while driving fur-
ther tourism and recreation along its 
route. 
It starts at the Pentagon Memorial 
in Arlington and extends northwest to 
the Shanksville site in Pennsylvania. 
It continues east to New York City’s 
National September 11 Memorial & Mu-
seum. It then heads south, following 
the East Coast Greenway, connecting 
to the Garden of Reflection 9/11 Memo-
rial. It then connects to the National 
Mall here in Washington, D.C., and ul-
timately returns to the Pentagon Me-
morial, remembering that dreadful in-
cident at the Pentagon that cost so 
many lives. 
It extends through six States and the 
District of Columbia. It is a multiuse 
trail, with more than 50 percent of the 
route off road. The idea for the trail 
was born in the wake of September 11 
at the Mid-Atlantic Governors Con-
ference on Greenways, Blueways, and 
Green Infrastructure. 
Conference chair and then-director of 
the Virginia Department of Conserva-
tion and Recreation, David Brickley, 
presented the vision for a trail route 
connecting the Pentagon and the site 
of Flight 93 and the Twin Towers in 
New York City. David founded the Sep-
tember 11th National Memorial Trail 
Alliance in the following year to de-
velop the September 11th National Me-
morial Trail. 
This route would be administered by 
the Secretary of the Interior in con-
sultation with the affected landowners 
but would not be considered as a unit 
of the National Park System or as part 
of the National Trail System. 
The Secretary would be authorized to 
produce and disseminate educational 
materials and create an official symbol 
or trail marker to mark the trail 
routes. 
The bill authorizes the Secretary to 
enter into agreements with and provide 
technical and financial assistance to 
other Federal agencies, States, local-
ities, and private entities, as may be 
required. 
Designating the September 11th Na-
tional Memorial Trail route will serve 
as a natural embodiment of our pledge 
to never forget the heroes and the vic-
tims of that terrible day. 
It honors the memories of nearly 
3,000 family members and loved ones we 
lost on that day, and it is a tribute to 
the bravery of the heroes that re-
sponded. 
When I was a local board of super-
visors member, I was in a fire station, 
Fire Station 30, and I saw firsthand 
those first responders who went to the 
Pentagon to try to save lives, putting 
their own lives at risk. 
Mr. Speaker, I hope this bill gives 
anyone touched by the tragedy of 9/11 
an opportunity for reflection, comfort, 
and healing. It is also a moment for us 
to come together once again to remem-
ber the heroes and the victims of that 
day, to honor them, and to come to-
gether as Republicans and Democrats 
in that pursuit. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
my colleagues to support the legisla-
tion, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. 
DINGELL) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2278, as 
amended. 
The question was taken.

Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, on that I

ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from

tleman 
from 
Arkansas 
(Mr. 
WESTERMAN) each will control 20 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Michigan. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Michigan? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 1029, the Free Veterans from 
Fees Act, introduced by my colleague, 
Representative GREG STEUBE. 
This bill would honor the sacrifices 
made by our veterans and Gold Star 
families by waiving application fees for 
veterans’ special events at war memo-
rials on land administered by the Na-
tional Park Service in our Nation’s 
Capital. 
Although the National Park Service 
has a longstanding practice of waiving 
application fees for special use permits 
for most veterans’ events at war me-
morials, veterans’ organizations have 
often had to pay administrative fees 
and associated costs to obtain permits 
for events, such as honor buses. 
By codifying a version of this prac-
tice in law, we can ensure that vet-
erans and the Gold Star families are 
not required to pay when visiting the 
national war memorials that were built 
to commemorate their bravery and sac-
rifices and our country’s fallen heroes. 
I would like to thank Representative 
STEUBE for introducing this important 
legislation, and I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1029, offered by 
Congressman STEUBE of Florida, would 
waive the application fee associated 
with special use permits for any vet-
erans’ demonstrations or special events 
at war memorials located on Federal 
land. 
Each year, hundreds of veterans’ 
groups and Gold Star families visit our 
national war memorials in Washington, 
D.C. This is done through arranged vis-
its sponsored by veterans’ organiza-
tions. To obtain a permit for any spe-
cial events they hold, these veterans’ 
groups may be required to pay adminis-
trative fees and other processing costs 
to the National Park Service. The Free 
Veterans from Fees Act waives these 
special use permit fees for veterans’ 
groups so that they may hold their 
demonstrations and special events at 
war memorials administered by the Na-
tional Park Service in the District of 
Columbia free of charge. 
The last thing veterans and their 
families should worry about is paying 
administrative fees when visiting me-
morials and monuments built in their 
honor. These brave men and women 
fought to defend our Nation, and we 
should honor their sacrifices by mak-
ing it as simple as possible for them to 
visit these sites. 
I commend Congressman STEUBE for 
his work on this bill, I urge adoption of 
the measure, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
5 minutes to the gentleman from Wis-
consin (Mr. KIND). 
Mr. KIND. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentlewoman from Michigan for yield-
ing me this time. 
Mr. Speaker, I was an original co-
sponsor with my good friend and col-
league, Mr. STEUBE from Florida, of 
H.R. 1029, the Free Veterans from Fees 
Act. 
H.R. 1029 would waive application 
fees for special use permits for Honor 
Flights and Gold Star Family events 
and other veterans demonstrations and 
special events at our Nation’s war me-
morials. It is the right thing to do, to 
try to reduce the cost for a lot of these 
important commemorative occasions 
happening right here in our Nation’s 
Capital. 
Throughout the years, I have had the 
privilege of being able to attend many 
of the Freedom Honor Flights that 
emanated from my hometown in La 
Crosse, Wisconsin. They are joyous oc-
casions, with much celebration hon-
oring the service and sacrifice of our 
veterans, celebrating their achieve-
ments, but more importantly, allowing 
them, many for the very last time, to 
be able to hop on a plane, come to 
Washington, and pay their respects at 
the memorials of conflicts that they 
were involved in and for the fallen 
comrades who didn’t come home. 
Oftentimes, on the way home—I 
know this is true for our La Crosse 
Honor Flights—there is a mail call 
where the relatives of these veterans, 
family 
members, 
write 
letters 
of 
thanks to them as they are coming 
home. When they arrive, it is a huge 
celebration of music and thanking 
them for their service and sacrifice. It 
is a great thing to behold. 
The thought that the cost of this is 
compounded with unnecessary applica-
tion fees in order to attend these 
events at our war memorials is some-
thing we can rectify, and that is ex-
actly what we are doing under H.R. 
1029, along with Gold Star events that 
occur here and other veterans’ events. 
I also am the original author of the 
Veterans History Project, trying to 
record our veterans’ stories before they 
pass away, archiving it at the Library 
of Congress, so that we never forget the 
service and sacrifice that came before 
us. 
We are trying to capture many of 
these veterans coming to our Nation’s 
Capital—again, many for the very last 
time—to have them share their story 
of what it was like to serve our coun-
try during times of conflict and peace. 
So it has been a great avenue in order 
to reach out and expand the number of 
oral histories that we have collected at 
the Library of Congress, close to 120,000 
veterans’ stories so far and counting. 
So if this is a way for us to reduce 
cost, to ease the burden, to make it 
easier for veterans to come here, a 
chance for us to reach out to them, 
asking them to share their memories of 
what it was like to serve our Nation, 
then that is a good thing for us to do. 
I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 
1029, and I thank my colleague from 
Florida (Mr. STEUBE) for partnering 
with me on this legislation. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, this 
is a great bill to honor our heroes and 
to say thank you in another way. I 
urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
b 1500 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, we have 
heard all the reasons why this bill mat-
ters. We even did an Honor Flight with 
the Rosies from Michigan, which was 
memorable. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
legislation, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. 
DINGELL) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1029. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it.

The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1154 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Great Dis-

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Michigan? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
1154, the Great Dismal Swamp National 
Heritage Area Act, introduced by the 
gentleman 
from 
Virginia 
(Mr. 
MCEACHIN), 
my 
Natural 
Resources 
Committee colleague. 
This bill would direct the Secretary 
of the Interior to conduct a study as-
sessing the suitability and the feasi-
bility of designating the Great Dismal 
Swamp in the States of Virginia and 
North Carolina as a national heritage 
area. 
The Great Dismal Swamp is an area 
of great historical, cultural, and envi-
ronmental importance, and has been 
home to indigenous people since time 
immemorial. The swamp includes the 
ancestral lands of the Nansemond In-
dian Nation and the historic lands of 
the Haliwa-Saponi and Meherrin tribes. 
The swamp was also one of the only 
known water-based stops on the Under-
ground Railroad and home to a thriv-
ing community descending from early 
colonial free people of color whose fam-
ilies resisted American slavery by find-
ing refuge within the swamp. 
In 1974 the swamp was designated as 
a national wildlife refuge due to its ec-
ological significance, and today it 
holds the largest intact remnant of a 
vast forest that once covered more 
than a million acres. 
Designating the Great Dismal Swamp 
as a national heritage area will help 
share the often untold stories of some 
of our Nation’s underrepresented com-
munities. 
From the indigenous communities 
who first called the swamp home to the 
enslaved African Americans who en-
dured the swamp’s hardships in their 
fight for freedom, these are stories 
worth sharing with current and future 
generations. 
I would like to thank my friend and 
colleague, Representative MCEACHIN, 
for championing this important legis-
lation. I urge all my colleagues to sup-
port this bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
H.R. 1154, offered by Congressman 
MCEACHIN, requires the Secretary of 
the Interior to assess the suitability 
and feasibility of designating a na-
tional heritage area comprised of cities 
and counties in Virginia and counties 
in North Carolina to be known as the 
Great Dismal Swamp National Herit-
age Area. 
While many think of Washington, 
D.C. as a great dismal swamp, it is ac-
tually a marshy region on the coastal 
plain of southeastern Virginia and 
northeastern 
North 
Carolina 
that 
stretches roughly 37 miles north to 
south and covers an area approxi-
mately 750 square miles. The Great 
Dismal Swamp has a long history of 
Native American inhabitants and was a 
known route and destination for free-
dom seekers. 
This measure already passed the 
House as an amendment to H.R. 803, 
the Protecting America’s Wilderness 
and Public Lands Act earlier this Con-
gress. I did not support the measure 
then because it had not gone through 
regular order and was being added to a 
package that created 1.5 million acres 
of new wilderness. You could say this 
measure was bogged down here in the 
swamp. 
While this is not how the process 
should work, I am happy that this bill 
has now gone through regular order, 
and I would, therefore, urge adoption of 
the measure. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
my colleagues to support this legisla-
tion. I am glad that my colleague’s 
thoughts came through the swamp, and 
I urge my colleagues to support the 
legislation. 
I yield back the balance of my time.

SEC. 2. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EF-
FECTS. 
The budgetary effects of this Act, for the 
purpose of complying with the Statutory 
Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be deter-
mined by reference to the latest statement 
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in 
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Mrs. DINGELL) and the gen-
tleman 
from 
Arkansas 
(Mr. 
WESTERMAN) each will control 20 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Michigan. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Michigan? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1664, introduced by 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Texas 
(Mr. 
VEASEY), would authorize the National 
Medal of Honor Museum Foundation to 
establish a monument in the District 
of Columbia commemorating the ex-
traordinary acts of valor, selfless serv-
ice, and sacrifice displayed by the 
Medal of Honor recipients. 
The Medal of Honor is our country’s 
highest military decoration, and since 
its creation during the Civil War, the 
medal has been awarded to more than 
3,500 members of the armed services. 
This bill would honor the unparal-
leled bravery and sacrifices of Medal of 
Honor recipients and ensure that the 
medal’s values of courage, sacrifice, pa-
triotism, citizenship, integrity, and 
commitment are shared for generations 
to come. 
I would like to thank Representative 
VEASEY for his leadership on this im-
portant legislation and urge my col-
leagues to support this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
H.R. 1664, offered by Congressman 
VEASEY, would authorize the National 
Medal of Honor Museum Foundation to 
establish a commemorative work on 
Federal land in the D.C. area to recog-
nize Medal of Honor recipients. 
The Medal of Honor is our Nation’s 
highest medal for valor in combat 
awarded to members of the U.S. Armed 
Forces. The medal was first authorized 
in 1861 for U.S. Navy sailors and ma-
rines, and the following year for Army 
soldiers. Since then more than 3,500 
Medals of Honor have been awarded to 
members of all Department of Defense 
services and the Coast Guard. Medals 
of Honor are awarded sparingly and 
only bestowed on the bravest of the 
brave whose courage and valor in com-
bat is well documented. 
According 
to 
the 
Congressional 
Medal of Honor Society, at least 10 Ar-
kansans have been awarded the Medal 
of Honor since its inception. This in-
cludes John Henry Pruitt, an Arkansan 
who is one of only 19 soldiers to ever be 
awarded the Medal of Honor twice. Our 
State Capitol in Little Rock also 
boasts its own Medal of Honor Memo-
rial, which depicts a bronze eagle sur-
rounded by plaques honoring each indi-
vidual Medal of Honor recipient from 
Arkansas. 
I would like to thank Congressman 
VEASEY
and 
Congressman 
BLAKE 
MOORE of Utah, a freshman on our com-
mittee, for their leadership on this im-
portant bipartisan bill. I urge adoption 
of the measure, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. VEASEY). 
Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, today I 
rise to urge my colleagues to pass the 
National Medal of Honor Monument 
Act. This is bipartisan legislation, as 
was mentioned, that I introduced with 
Representative MOORE of Utah. 
This bill honors our Nation’s brave 
servicemembers by paving the way for 
the creation of a monument in our Na-
tion’s Capital recognizing the Medal of 
Honor and its more than 3,500 recipi-
ents. 
Our Nation’s Medal of Honor recipi-
ents are patriots. They have put their 
lives on the line to ensure we can live 
freely and prosperously in the greatest 
nation on Earth. That is why I am 
happy to have spearheaded this from 
the beginning and pay homage to the 
values the Medal of Honor represents— 
courage, patriotism, citizenship, integ-
rity, commitment, and sacrifice—and 
the brave individuals who earned it in 
service to our country. 
The National Medal of Honor Mu-
seum will actually open in my district 
in Arlington, Texas, in the next few 
years, and it will also serve as a beacon 
for these values. 
My hope is that we are able to pass 
this legislation to honor these individ-
uals because this is a very, very pres-
tigious award for our Nation’s veterans 
and for those that have sacrificed. We 
want to make sure that we do every-
thing we can to rally around this and 
honor the bravest individuals who 
serve in our country by having a monu-
ment here in Washington, D.C. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
urge adoption of this bill and strongly

GOLD STAR MOTHERS FAMILY 
MONUMENT EXTENSION ACT 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 2365) to extend the authority for 
the establishment of a commemorative 
work in honor of Gold Star Families, 
and for other purposes, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 2365 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Gold Star 
Mothers Family Monument Extension Act’’. 
SEC. 2. EXTENSION OF AUTHORITY FOR ESTAB-
LISHMENT 
OF 
COMMEMORATIVE 
WORK. 
Notwithstanding section 8903(e) of title 40, 
United Sates Code, the authority provided by 
section 2859 of the Military Construction Au-
thorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 (division 
B of Public Law 112–239; 126 Stat. 2164; 40 
U.S.C. 8903 note) shall continue to apply 
through January 2, 2027. 
SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EF-
FECTS. 
The budgetary effects of this Act, for the 
purpose of complying with the Statutory 
Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be deter-
mined by reference to the latest statement 
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in 
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Mrs. DINGELL) and the gen-
tleman 
from 
Arkansas 
(Mr. 
WESTERMAN) each will control 20 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Michigan. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Michigan? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2365, introduced by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
KIM), would extend the authorization 
for the establishment of a commemora-
tive work to Gold Star Mother Fami-
lies until January 2, 2027. 
The Gold Star Mothers Family Na-
tional Monument would honor the 
mothers and families of those who have 
paid the ultimate sacrifice in service of 
our Nation. 
The Gold Star is a widely recognized 
tradition that dates back to World War 
I when families would display service 
flags bearing a blue star for each fam-
ily member serving abroad and a gold 
star for each family member who had 
been lost in combat. 
Although this commemorative work 
was originally authorized in the Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act for 
fiscal year 2013, the authorization ex-
pired in January 2020. In November 
2015, the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts 
approved a location for the memorial 
on the National Park Service property 
west of the Arlington National Ceme-
tery visitor center. 
b 1515 
Following that approval, the Na-
tional Capital Memorial Advisory Com-
mission has engaged in consultation 
with the Gold Star Mothers National 
Monument Foundation regarding the 
memorial’s design. 
This bill would build on these efforts 
by extending the authorization needed 
to establish the monument. While we 
can never truly repay the debt that 
America owes to our Gold Star Moth-
ers and their families, H.R. 2365 would 
bring us closer toward fully honoring 
the sacrifices that they have made. 
I would like to thank Representative 
KIM for introducing this important leg-
islation, and I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2365, offered by 
Congressman KIM, would extend the 
authorization of the Gold Stars Moth-
ers National Monument Foundation to 
construct 
the 
Gold 
Star 
National 
Mothers Monument. Legislation signed 
into law during the 112th Congress au-
thorized the Gold Star Mothers Na-
tional Monument Foundation to erect 
a monument on Federal lands in Wash-
ington, D.C., that would honor mothers 
whose children gave the last full meas-
ure of devotion defending the United 
States as members of the Armed 
Forces. 
This bill would allow more time for 
the Foundation to ensure the monu-
ment’s construction and completion by 
extending the authorization until Jan-
uary 2, 2027. 
We can never fully understand the 
lifelong grief that these Gold Star 
Mothers must face, and I hope that this 
new memorial serves as a collective 
place for them to heal and remember 
their brave children who valiantly 
fought to defend our country. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this measure, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
my colleagues to support this legisla-
tion and the Gold Star families, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. 
DINGELL) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2365, as 
amended. 
The question was taken.

ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered.

ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from

tleman 
from

WESTERMAN) each will control 20 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Michigan. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Michigan? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 2497, the Amache National His-
toric Site Act, introduced by the chair 
of 
the 
Subcommittee 
on 
National 
Parks, Forests, and Public Lands, my 
colleague from Colorado, Representa-
tive JOE NEGUSE. 
H.R. 2497 would establish the Amache 
imprisonment site in southeast Colo-
rado as a national historic site to en-
sure permanent protections and pro-
vide for the interpretation of the 
Amache site of Japanese-American in-
carceration. 
Following the United States’ entry 
into World War II, President Franklin 
D. Roosevelt issued an executive order 
forcibly removing more than 120,000 
people, primarily of Japanese descent, 
to 10 remote military-style prisons 
across the Nation. 
The Granada Relocation Center, com-
monly known as Amache, was one of 
those 10 centers and was the only one 
located in the State of Colorado. Al-
though Amache was the smallest of the 
relocation centers, it became the tenth 
largest city in Colorado with more 
than 10,000 people passing through the 
camp between 1942 and 1945, nearly 
two-thirds of whom were American 
citizens. 
Most had never been to Japan and 
most were given a week or less to leave 
their homes and dispose of everything 
they 
owned, 
everything 
they 
had 
worked hard to build up for them-
selves. This unjustifiable, horrific, and 
unconstitutional incarceration of Japa-
nese Americans is, without doubt, one 
of the darkest chapters in our coun-
try’s history. 
And while these incarceration sites 
no longer hold prisoners, many of the 
wrongfully imprisoned are still with us 
today, even as anti-Asian rhetoric con-
tinues to permeate our country. As we 
continue to reckon with our Nation’s 
painful legacy of systemic racism, it is 
critical that we honor and share the 
stories of those who came before us. It 
is vital that we remember and learn 
from their fights against injustice and 
for equity. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ 
on H.R. 2497, and join me in working to 
ensure that we remember this dark 
time in our Nation’s history so we may 
honor those who lived it, share their 
stories, and continue to heal as a coun-
try. I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2497, offered by my 
friend, Representative NEGUSE
from 
Colorado, would establish the Amache 
National Historic Site in Colorado as a 
unit of the National Park System. 
In 1942, President Franklin Delano 
Roosevelt issued an executive order, 
later enforced by law, to forcibly re-
move tens of thousands of Japanese 
Americans, 
including 
nearly 
70,000 
American citizens, from the West Coast 
to internment centers further inland 
during World War II. The smallest in-
ternment camp was located a mile 
from Granada, Colorado, and was offi-
cially known as Amache. Over 7,000 
residents of Japanese ancestry, most of 
them American citizens, were impris-
oned at Amache from 1942 to 1945. The 
Amache site was added to the National 
Register of Historic Places in 1994 and 
designated a National Historic Land-
mark in 2005. 
Amache is currently owned by the 
town of Granada, Colorado, and main-
tained by a group of student volunteers 
who, led by their high school social 
studies teacher, are known as the 
Amache Preservation Society. 
During a hearing on the bill in the 
Natural Resources Committee earlier 
this year, we heard testimony from an 
Amache survivor, Mr. Bob Fuchigami. 
Mr. Fuchigami was just 11 when his 
family 
was 
forcibly 
relocated 
to 
Amache and during his powerful testi-
mony, he said the following about the 
bill: ‘‘Designating Amache a national 
park site would shine a light on our 
forgotten history and help tell a more 
complete story of America. Amache is 
our collective story. It is an American 
story.’’ 
Adding the Amache site to the Na-
tional Park System will help educate 
Americans about this dark chapter in

like Amache help to remind us of the 
challenges our Nation has faced and 
the mistakes we have made as we have

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I ask

have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Michigan? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
4300, the Alexander Lofgren Veterans 
in Parks (VIP) Act introduced by my 
colleague 
Representative 
MILLER- 
MEEKS from Iowa. 
This bill would provide free annual 
America the Beautiful Passes to cur-
rent military servicemembers and free 
lifetime America the Beautiful Passes 
to veterans and members of Gold Star 
families, ensuring that those who have 
sacrificed so much in the service of our 
Nation are able to access our national 
parks and public lands at no cost. 
Anyone who has visited America’s 
public lands understands the signifi-
cant mental and physical health bene-
fits of getting outside and connecting 
with nature. It is time that we ensure 
our military servicemembers, veterans, 
and Gold Star families are able to ac-
cess these beloved places at no cost. 
Although the annual America the 
Beautiful Pass became free for vet-
erans and Gold Star families in 2020, 
the change for veterans has never been 
codified in law. 
While we will never be able to repay 
the debt owed to them for their service 
and their sacrifice, H.R. 4300 will en-
sure that this benefit is protected in 
perpetuity and that all of our Amer-
ican heroes are able to recreate and 
find comfort and solace on the lands 
that they fought so hard to protect. 
I would like to thank Representative 
MILLER-MEEKS for her service and for 
her work on this important legislation, 
including working with Committee on 
Natural Resources chair, Mr. GRI-
JALVA, to rename the bill in honor of 
Alexander Lofgren. 
Alexander Lofgren served for 4 years 
in the U.S. Army as a combat engineer, 
including a deployment to Afghani-
stan. Afterwards, he served in Chair 
GRIJALVA’s office as part of the Wound-
ed Warrior Fellowship Program, han-
dling issues and constituent casework 
concerning veterans’ health and bene-
fits. 
As a congressional staffer and vet-
eran, Mr. Lofgren was a great pro-
ponent for his community, veterans, 
and our Nation’s public lands, often en-
couraging returning veterans to recon-
nect with nature to heal. 
Tragically, his life was lost during a 
recent outing in Death Valley National 
Park. Our hearts go out to his family. 
Renaming this legislation after Mr. 
Lofgren is a fitting tribute to his leg-
acy and service to our Nation. I urge 
my colleagues to support this bill, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to speak 
today in support of H.R. 4300, the Alex-
ander Lofgren Veterans in Parks Act, 
also known as the VIP Act, which is 
sponsored 
by 
Congresswoman 
MARIANNETTE
MILLER-MEEKS
from 
Iowa. 
This bipartisan bill, which currently 
has 150 cosponsors, would provide free 
annual passes to our national parks 
and public lands for current military 
servicemembers 
and 
free 
lifetime 
passes for veterans and members of 
Gold Star families. 
We can never fully repay the debt 
owed to our military servicemembers, 
veterans, and Gold Star families. How-
ever, as a small acknowledgment of 
their sacrifice, this bill will ensure 
that they can always access over 2,000 
Federal recreation areas across the 
country that they fought so hard to de-
fend free of charge. 
b 1530 
By codifying these passes under the 
Federal Lands Recreation Enhance-
ment Act, it guarantees this benefit 
can never be taken away from these 
brave men and women. 
This bill is important not only be-
cause it honors the sacrifice of the men 
and women of our military and Gold 
Star families but because our public 
lands hold a special value for veterans, 
particularly those wounded in combat. 
Captain John Paluska, a constituent 
of Representative MILLER-MEEKS and a 
Purple Heart recipient, summed up the 
purpose and meaning of this bill per-
fectly when he testified before our 
committee earlier this month: ‘‘I men-
tioned the word ‘freedom’ earlier. Is it 
a concept? Is it a place? Is it the result 
of an action? What does it mean for

each of you on this committee? For 
me, it is all of those, and I find this 
each and every time I am so very fortu-
nate to visit the outdoors and our na-
tional parks.’’ 
This bill would not only allow our 
veterans and Gold Star family mem-
bers to always enjoy the freedom of our 
national parks, but it will remove any 
financial barriers they may face to ac-
cessing places they use to heal the 
emotional and physical burdens they 
carry with them. 
In addition to the 150 bipartisan co-
sponsors of this bill, there are also 60 
organizations currently endorsing the 
measure. These organizations represent 
a diverse variety of interests, from the 
outdoor recreation industry to vet-
erans groups, and include The Amer-
ican Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, 
Paralyzed Veterans of America, Out-
door 
Recreation 
Roundtable, 
REI, 
Vista Outdoor, Audubon Society, and 
The Nature Conservancy. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
five letters in support of the bill from 
the Outdoor Industry Association, Si-
erra Club, Backcountry Hunters and 
Anglers, American Cultural Resources 
Association, and Evangelical Environ-
mental Network.

RANKING 
MEMBER
FULCHER, On behalf of our 1,200 
manufacturer, supplier, sales representative 
and retailer members, Outdoor Industry As-
sociation (OIA) is proud to support the ‘‘Vet-
erans in Parks (VIP) Act’’ to give veterans 
and members of the Armed Forces free ac-
cess to national parks and public lands. 
Spending time in nature can provide 
countless mental and physical health bene-
fits for everyone, including our nation’s 
servicemembers. Through studies and anec-
dotes, we know outdoor activities are linked 
to improved mental health and long-term 
psychological well-being. Additionally, in-
creasing access and opportunity to outdoor 
spaces is an important way to honor those 
who have risked their lives to protect us and 
this country. 
The outdoors can be a restorative force for 
all, helping individuals and communities 
thrive. We are pleased to see the commit-
ment to ensuring those who served our coun-
try have the resources they need to partici-
pate in outdoor activities and experience ev-
erything our beautiful national parks and 
public lands have to offer. OIA is committed 
to honoring and respecting servicemembers 
through access to the outdoors and outdoor 
recreation, and we look forward to seeing 
this bill become law. 
Sincerely, 
LISE AANGEENBRUG, 
Executive Director, Outdoor

DEAR CHAIRMAN NEGUSE, RANKING MEMBER

ON
NATURAL
RESOURCES
SUB-
COMMITTEE
ON
NATIONAL
PARKS, FORESTS, 
AND PUBLIC LANDS: On behalf of 3.8 million 
members and supporters, the Sierra Club 
urges you to support the Veterans in Parks 
(VIP) Act, H.R. 4300. This bipartisan legisla-
tion would help military service members, 
veterans, and Gold Star Families explore, 
enjoy, and heal on America’s public lands 
and waters by removing a financial barrier 
to access over 2,000 federal recreation areas. 
America’s public lands and waters provide 
unique opportunities for healing and respite 
for veterans upon returning home from serv-
ice. Unfortunately, these opportunities are 
not equally available to all. No one, espe-
cially veterans, active duty service mem-
bers, and Gold Star Families, should be de-
nied access to the benefits of nature because 
of a lack of funds. The Veterans in Parks Act 
will ensure that those who have served and 
sacrificed for our nation can enjoy a direct 
connection to the land they defend. 
Many veterans face considerable chal-
lenges upon returning home. Repeat expo-
sure to trauma and long deployments away 
from family and friends has resulted in a 
generation of veterans that have difficulty 
reintegrating into civilian life. In addition, 
some of the effects of war, such as traumatic 
brain injury and post-traumatic stress, leave 
no visible scars and can be equally or more 
disabling than an apparent physical injury, 
making it even harder to adjust to life at 
home. As a result, the demand for mental 
health services for veterans continues to 
grow. According to the U.S. Government Ac-
countability Office, the number of veterans 
receiving mental health care from the De-
partment of Veterans Affairs increased 90% 
from FY 2006–2019—more than three times 
the rate of increase for all VA health care 
services. During this time, VA’s mental 
health budget increased from $2.4 to $8.9 bil-
lion. 
Time spent outdoors is proven to promote 
mental and physical health and well-being. 
For veterans, these benefits can be excep-
tionally profound; research into the efficacy 
of outdoor recreation as therapy shows sig-
nificant improvements in mental and phys-
ical well-being, social function, and outlook 
on life with even moderate exposure to na-
ture. Research also indicates that these pro-
grams may be especially beneficial to vet-
erans most in need of help, supplemented by 
fewer stigmas being associated with outdoor 
recreation compared to clinical treatments. 
Expanding access to these benefits is a com-
mon-sense, cost-effective way to ease vet-
erans’ transition into civilian life and im-
prove the health and wellbeing of service 
members and Gold Star Families. 
Veterans are already relying on the heal-
ing power of the outdoors. Structured pro-
grams utilizing outdoor recreation on federal 
lands have become increasingly common 
within various Veterans Service Organiza-
tions. 
Last year, Congress passed the Accel-
erating Veterans Recovery Outdoors Act, 
which will create an interagency task force 
to identify veterans’ barriers to access and 
recommend how the Department of Veterans 
Affairs can utilize public lands as an adjunct 
therapy for veterans. This victory was a crit-
ical step to ensure veterans have ample op-
portunities to enjoy outdoor recreation on 
the land they served to protect. Similarly, 
the Veterans in Parks Act will be an impor-
tant part of fulfilling that mission and im-
proving the lives of veterans, service mem-
bers, and Gold Star Families. 
Thank you for your support for our na-
tion’s service members, veterans, and Gold 
Star Families. 
Sincerely, 
ROB VESSELS, 
Military Outdoors Campaign 
Manager, Sierra Club.

Hon. BRUCE WESTERMAN, 
Ranking Member, House Natural Resources 
Committee, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIR GRIJALVA AND RANKING MEM-
BER WESTERMAN: On behalf of Backcountry 
Hunters & Anglers (BHA), the voice for our 
wild public lands, waters and wildlife, we 
write in support of the bipartisan Veterans 
in Parks (VIP) Act (H.R. 4300) led by Rep-
resentatives 
Miller-Meeks 
(R-IA) 
and 
Gallego (D–AZ). This important legislation 
will provide free annual America the Beau-
tiful Passes to current military service 
members and free lifetime America the 
Beautiful Passes to veterans and members of 
Gold Star Families. 
We recognize that members of the armed 
forces are a critical constituency when it 
comes to the defense of our wild public lands. 
BHA’s Armed Forces Initiative focuses on 
connecting veterans to our public lands 
through lowering the barrier of entry of 
hunting and fishing for military members, 
engaging veterans through skill camps and 
leading restoration projects, and elevating 
the voices of veterans from town halls to the 
discussion of legislation at the congressional 
level. The benefits provided by the VIP Act 
would fit well within this mission. 
The VIP Act is supported by hunters and 
anglers who want to recognize the sacrifice 
made by service members, veterans and Gold 
Star Families. The debt to these individuals 
can never be repaid, but the VIP Act would 
give them access, at no cost, to over 2,000 
federal recreation areas including national 
parks, national forests and national wildlife 
refuges. This will eliminate barriers and in-
crease access to hunt, fish and recreate on 
our nation’s treasured public lands, an honor 
they deserve. 
Since 2020, the annual America the Beau-
tiful Pass has been free for veterans and Gold 
Star Families, however the VIP Act would 
change these to lifetime passes and codify 
this program to ensure it continues in the 
years to come. Passing this legislation would 
not only ensure this program continues for 
veterans and Gold Star Families, but it 
would also provide the much-needed inclu-
sion for current service members. 
We urge the Natural Resources Committee 
to pass the VIP Act and honor the service of 
our nation’s active-duty military, veterans 
and Gold Star Families by increasing their 
access to our public lands and waters. As the 
bill continues through the legislative proc-
ess, we look forward to working with you 
and your colleagues to see it across the fin-
ish line. 
Sincerely, 
MORGAN MASON, 
Armed Forces Initiative 
Coordinator, Backcountry Hunters & Anglers.

Hon. RUBEN GALLEGO, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVES MILLER-MEEKS AND 
GALLEGO: The American Cultural Resources 
Association (ACRA) strongly supports H.R. 
4300, the Veterans in Parks (VIP) Act, and 
commends you for introducing this worthy 
legislation. 
ACRA is the national trade association 
supporting the common interests of cultural 
resource management (CRM) firms of all 
sizes, types, and specialties. ACRA member 
firms undertake much of the legally man-
dated cultural resource studies and inves-
tigations in the United States. They employ 
thousands of professionals, including archae-
ologists, architectural historians, historians, 
ethnographers, and an increasingly diverse 
group of other specialists who work with 
communities in every state to help protect 
and record our nation’s historic and cultural 
heritage. 
Our nation’s public lands, monuments and 
parks help tell the story of America, from 
the battlefields of Yorktown to the Pacific 
coast and everything in between. These pub-
lic lands educate, entertain and inspire mil-
lions of Americans and visitors from around 
the world. They are integral to under-
standing America’s history and culture, 
while providing enormous ecological benefits 
to our nation’s ecosystem. 
As veterans, you both understand first- 
hand 
the 
enormous 
sacrifices 
that 
servicemembers and their families have 
made to protect our nation. Their contribu-
tions to our nation’s story are incalculable; 
they certainly should not have to pay to ac-
cess to our most treasured and beautiful pub-
lic lands. 
By giving active-duty servicemembers free 
annual passes, and veterans and Gold Star 
Families free lifetime passes, to our national 
parks and lands, the VIP Act honors both 
our nation’s historic and scenic heritage and 
the people who have sacrificed so much to 
protect it. 
We commend you for your leadership in in-
troducing this bipartisan bill, and we urge 
Congress to pass it as soon as possible.

Hon. JOE NEGUSE, Chair, 
Hon. RUSS FULCHER, Ranking Member, 
Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests, and 
Public Lands, Committee on Natural Re-
sources, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIR NEGUSE AND RANKING MEMBER 
FULCHER, Our National Parks and other pub-
lic lands are essential to our quality of life. 
They make God’s creation available to ev-
eryone. They reflect our ideals as a nation: 
that everyone is welcome because all indi-
viduals are created equal and endowed with 
the inalienable rights to life, liberty, and the 
pursuit of happiness. To step into a National 
Park and enjoy the beauty of God’s creation 
is to experience freedom and the richness of 
life as persons made in the image of God. 
That’s why over 400,000 pro-life Christians 
have joined with us to defend and protect 
these God-given National Treasurers. 
Most Christians have experienced God in 
our natural parks and public lands, but we 
also have the responsibility to care for them. 
We are commanded to tend the earth and 
steward all aspects of this wonderful cre-
ation given to us to sustain abundant phys-
ical life, enjoy, and even play in. Creation 
doesn’t belong to any one person or group to 
exploit, plunder, or be used selfishly. It’s a 
trust, given by God, for the benefit of hu-
manity and the glory of God. 
That is why The Evangelical Environ-
mental Network supports the efforts of Rep-
resentative Mariannette Miller-Meeks (R– 
IA), Representative Ruben Gallego (D–AZ), 
and the over 140 other cosponsors for intro-
ducing the Veterans in Park (VIP) Act! The 
VIP Act offers a small thank you to our 
military service members, veterans, and 
Gold Star Families for their patriotism and 
service to our nation, but it goes beyond say-
ing thanks, it offers an opportunity for heal-
ing. Medical research clearly proves the abil-
ity to find healing in our greatest outdoor 
treasurers, America’s National Parks. God’s 
marvelous creation provides perhaps the 
greatest healing place for many of our heroes 
and their families who suffer deep internal 
wounds. The VIP Act offers our heroes hope 
for healing, wholeness, restoration, and sim-
ply great fun! 
Our prayer is that the Subcommittee on 
National Parks, Forests, and Public Lands 
will quickly move this to the full committee 
and then onward to the House floor in quick 
order. 
Thank you for your service to our nation 
and know you are in our prayers. 
Sincerely, 
THE REV. MITCHELL C. HESCOX, 
President/C.E.O. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
also include in the RECORD
several 
news articles that speak to the impor-
tance of this bill that have appeared in 
papers all across the country. 
HONORING AMERICA’S REAL VIPS 
(By Reps. Bruce Westerman (R–ARK.) and 
Mariannette Miller-Meeks (R–IOWA), Opin-
ion Contributors) 
[From The Hill, July 4, 2021] 
This year, we celebrate the 245th birthday 
of the United States. Independence Day is a 
great day to picnic with friends, spend time 
outside, and enjoy a fireworks show, but it is 
also much more than that. It is our duty to 
honor the men and women who, for the past 
two and a half centuries, have kept our coun-
ty free. 
We owe a debt of gratitude to American 
military members and their families and we 
want to repay them in a very small way by 
giving them lifetime access to our national 
parks. 
There are few things that instill American 
pride quite like watching the sun set over 
the 
Grand 
Canyon, 
seeing 
bison 
roam 
through Yellowstone, or hiking through the 
forest in Acadia. From sea to shining sea, we 
are a nation of incredible beauty and bio-
diversity. Congress recognizes the mental 
and physical health benefits of outdoor 
recreation for current servicemembers and 
veterans. Last December Congress passed 
and President Trump signed legislation es-
tablishing an interagency task force to iden-
tify barriers and make recommendations to 
increase the use of public lands and other 
outdoor spaces for veteran medical treat-
ment. 
Removing barriers and increasing access to 
our public lands is exactly why we have in-
troduced the bipartisan Veterans in Parks 
(VIP) Act: to give servicemembers, veterans, 
and Gold Star families free passes to all na-
tional parks and federal recreational lands 
for life. It is the least we can do for those 
who gave so much for our country. Cur-
rently, active duty servicemembers and vet-
erans are able to receive a one-year free ac-
cess pass to all parks with entrance fees. 
With more than 135 co-sponsors, the VIP Act 
would codify the active duty and veterans 
passes, as well as make the pass for veterans 
a lifetime pass. It would also amend the pre-
viously codified Gold Star families annual 
pass and make it a lifetime pass. 
As a veteran of the U.S. Army who served 
for 24 years, Congresswoman Miller-Meeks is 
no stranger to the myriad hardships that 
come from being a member of the military. 
We both are also privileged to represent a 
host of servicemembers in Congress and want 
to make it even easier for them to enjoy 
time with family and friends in America’s 
most beautiful landscapes. 
Our national parks are for all of us. No one 
is more worthy of experiencing open access 
to these incredible places than the men and 
women who fought to keep us free and the 
families who made the ultimate sacrifice. 
Unfortunately, it is often all too easy to 
pay lip service to the military’s sacrifice but 
then not follow through with action to rec-
ognize their service. We aim to change that, 
one legislative recognition at a time. 
If you or a member of your family has been 
a member of the U.S. Armed Forces, we are 
grateful for your service, today and every 
day. We hope to see you in a national park 
soon.

Office) 
WASHINGTON, 
DC.—Congresswoman 
Uifa’atali Amata voted Wednesday for the 
Veterans in Parks (VIP) Act, H.R. 4300, 
which was passed by the full Committee on 
Natural Resources with bipartisan support. 
Amata cosponsored the legislation to honor 
Veterans with free lifetime access to all U.S. 
National Parks, and other National Forests 
and public lands. 
The Veterans in Parks (VIP) Act specifi-
cally honors the nation’s servicemembers, 
veterans, and Gold Star families as VIPs in 
over 2,000 federally protected places. Amata 
supported the bill from the start as an origi-
nal cosponsor upon introduction by Rep-
resentatives Mariannette Miller-Meeks (R– 
IA) and Ruben Gallego (D–AZ). 
Currently, the public can purchase annual 
‘‘America the Beautiful’’ passes that allow 
entry to all parks for one year. The VIP Act 
works by providing these annual America 
the Beautiful Passes for free to current mili-
tary service members, and free lifetime 
America the Beautiful Passes to veterans 
and members of Gold Star Families. 
‘‘This bill is a special statement of support 
for our Veterans and military families, and 
another way to say thank you,’’ said Con-
gresswoman Amata. ‘‘The VIP Act honors 
those serving, those who served, and Gold 
Star families who lost a loved one in service 
to the United States, by ensuring you are a 
VIP in the nation’s federally protected his-
toric and beautiful places.’’ 
The America the Beautiful pass is an ac-
cess ticket to over 2,000 places spanning Na-
tional Parks, National Forests and Wildlife 
Refuges, which fall under different federal 
agencies and departments. The National 
Parks system has 423 sites including 63 
Parks, along with trails, historical sites, 
monuments and memorials. These sites are 
preserved for national value based on sce-
nery, special geographic features, history, or 
plant and wildlife conservation. Some Parks, 
such as the National Park of American 
Samoa, are generally free to access, but 
many locations have fees, or passes applied 
per car or for parking. The America the 
Beautiful pass covers those entry expenses. 
In 2020, the administration made America 
the Beautiful yearly access free for Veterans

takes it a step further in three ways by ex-
tending it to lifetime passes, making the 
change permanent, and codifying it in law.

BOONE AND CROCKETT JOINS OVER 100 OTHERS 
ENDORSING VETERANS IN PARKS ACT 
The Boone and Crockett Club endorsed 
H.R. 4300, the Veterans In Parks Act, which 
was introduced earlier today (https://repub-
licans-naturalresources.house.gov/newsroom/ 
documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=409869) by 
Reps. Miller-Meeks and Gallego with an ad-
ditional 133 bipartisan original cosponsorsr. 
BACKGROUND 
The America the Beautiful Pass provides 
access to more than 2,000 federal recreation 
areas, including our national parks, national 
forests, and wildlife refuges. This includes 
some of the country’s most iconic treasures, 
ranging from the majestic Grand Canyon Na-
tional Park to the aweinspiring Redwood Na-
tional Forest. Although we can never fully 
repay 
the 
debt 
we 
owe 
to 
our 
servicemembers and veterans, the VIP Act 
would allow them, along with Gold Star 
Family members, to visit our national parks 
and public lands free of charge. In 2020, the 
America the Beautiful annual pass became 
free for veterans and Gold Star Families. 
However, this change for veterans has never 
been codified and could be undone in future 
years. The VIP Act protects these passes by 
codifying them and making them lifetime 
passes instead of annual passes. The VIP Act 
also creates annual passes for current service 
members, which can be converted into life-
time passes once they leave the military.

HOUSE INTRODUCES BILL TO GIVE MILITARY 
FAMILIES FREE LIFETIME ACCESS
TO NA-
TIONAL PARKS 
(By Zach Hester) 
(WHNT).—A new bill introduced in the U.S. 
House of Representatives could allow vet-
erans and Gold Star families free lifetime ac-
cess to national parks and public lands—and 
free annual passes to active-duty members of 
the military. 
The bipartisan bill, brought to the floor by 
Reps. Mariannette Miller-Meeks (R–Iowa) 
and Ruben Gallego (D–Ariz.), creates the 
‘‘America the Beautiful Pass’’ providing 
these services members and their families 
free access to more than 2,000 federal recre-
ation areas, ranging from Acadia National 
Park to Redwood National Forest. 
‘‘As a 24-year Army veteran, I understand 
the sacrifices made by our military and their 
loved ones,’’ said Miller-Meeks. ‘‘We owe so 
much to our amazing servicemembers, vet-
erans, and their families; my Veterans in 
Parks Act is the least we can do.’’ 
In addition to creating the passes for serv-
ices members and their families, it also codi-
fies them and makes them last a lifetime. 
Last year, a similar measure was passed, but 
never put into law. 
‘‘As a veteran, I know firsthand the impor-
tance of national parks as a place of connec-
tion and healing when dealing with the visi-
ble and invisible wounds of war,’’ Gallego 
said. ‘‘I am proud to co-lead this bill and I 
will continue to fight for veteran accessi-
bility and support on our nation’s public 
lands.’’ 
The bill lists over 100 co-sponsors, includ-
ing Alabama Reps. Mo Brooks, Barry Moore, 
and Jerry Carl.

PROPOSAL MADE TO EXPAND VETERANS’ FREE 
ACCESS TO ALL NATIONAL PARKS 
(By Ariana Figueroa) 
WASHINGTON.—U.S. Rep. Mariannette Mil-
ler-Meeks of Iowa testified Tuesday before 
the House Natural Resources Committee 
hearing in support of bipartisan legislation 
that would give veterans and Gold Star fami-
lies free lifetime access to national parks 
and public federal lands. 
‘‘No one is more worthy of experiencing 
open access to the incredible places that 
these men and women have fought to keep us 
free and their families who have also made 
the ultimate sacrifice along with them,’’ the 
Iowa Republican said. 
Miller-Meeks is a veteran and worked on 
the bill, the ‘‘Veterans in Parks Act,’’ with 
Rep. Ruben Gallego, an Arizona Democrat 
who is also a veteran. 
‘‘As a veteran, I know firsthand the impor-
tance of national parks as a place of connec-
tion and healing when dealing with the visi-
ble and invisible wounds of war,’’ Gallego 
said in a statement. 
‘‘The VIP Act is an important step in en-
suring that veterans, service members, and 
Gold Star families have access to the public 
lands they and their loved ones fought to 
protect.’’ 
Last year, the U.S. National Park Service 
made annual visits to national parks free for 
veterans and active duty service members, 
but the bill, H.R. 4300, would codify that an-
nual pass into law, to be used throughout 
their lives. 
‘‘We can never fully repay our veterans for 
their service and sacrifice, but we want to 
show our gratitude by giving them lifetime 
access to America’s beautiful landscapes,’’ 
Miller-Meeks said. 
The bill would also give active-duty mili-
tary free annual passes to national parks and 
public federal lands. Once those members re-
tire, their passes could be converted to life-
time passes. A Gold Star family is an imme-
diate family member of a service member 
who died in the line of duty. 
Capt. John Paluska, from Ottumwa, Iowa, 
testified before the panel in support of the 
bill. 
He said that in between his deployments, 
he would often visit Yellowstone National 
Park ‘‘and find my freedom all throughout 
the park.’’ 
‘‘There’s something about connecting to 
nature at these parks that helps with the 
healing,’’ he said. ‘‘I will always carry the 
wounds of war with me wherever I go, but 
when I go to these beautiful places, I am able 
to connect with one of the reasons I decided 
to serve-this incredible, beautiful, country.’’ 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
would note that at our committee 
markup earlier this month, as the gen-
tlewoman has stated, we added a bipar-
tisan amendment to name this bill 
after a wounded veteran who, sadly, 
passed away earlier this year. 
Alexander Lofgren was a military 
and veterans’ liaison for Chair GRI-
JALVA through the Wounded Warrior 
Fellowship Program and a lover of the 
outdoors. I was happy to cosponsor 
Chair GRIJALVA’s amendment to name 
the bill after him and hope that this 
fitting tribute helps carry on Alex’s 
legacy and provides some level of com-
fort to his family and friends. 
Before I close, I thank Representa-
tive MILLER-MEEKS for her leadership 
on this effort. A veteran herself who 
served 24 years in the Army as a pri-
vate, nurse, and doctor, Congress-
woman MILLER-MEEKS is the perfect 
champion of this legislation. I com-
mend her for her commitment to bipar-
tisanship and for her work on behalf of 
our Nation’s veterans and her constitu-
ents. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no further requests for time, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from New Mexico (Ms. HERRELL). 
Ms. HERRELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise as 
a proud original cosponsor and sup-
porter of H.R. 4300, the VIP Act, offered 
by my friend from Iowa, Congress-
woman MILLER-MEEKS. 
This legislation would codify into 
Federal law an initiative put into place 
by the Trump administration last year 
that grants free passes to visit our na-
tional parks, national forests, and 
wildlife refuges to those who deserve 
them most, our Nation’s Active-Duty 
servicemembers, veterans, and Gold 
Star families. 
Our national parks and public lands 
are an essential part of our history and 
provide great recreational opportuni-
ties for the American people. Recre-
ating in the most beautiful places our 
Nation has to offer brings needed heal-
ing and relaxation for those who have 
and still do put it all on the line to pro-
tect the freedoms each of us take for 
granted as Americans. 
As a Member of this body from south-
ern New Mexico, I have the privilege of 
representing two of the most iconic 
landmarks in the Nation, White Sands 
National Park and Carlsbad Caverns. 
These irreplaceable components of the 
National Park System welcome thou-
sands of visitors every year and provide 
a strong economic boost to their sur-
rounding communities.

July 26, 2021 
Providing greater access to our pub-
lic lands, as this bill does, will only en-
hance economic opportunity for gate-
way communities that surround our 
public lands and provide even greater 
benefits for our Active-Duty service-
men, veterans, and Gold Star families. 
This legislation enjoys the support of 
a wide cross-section of organizations 
representing all strains of political 
opinion and areas of interest, such as 
the National Association of Counties, 
Congressional 
Sportsmen’s 
Founda-
tion, and National Wildlife Federation. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be an 
original cosponsor of this legislation, 
and I once again congratulate and 
thank my colleague, Congresswoman 
MILLER-MEEKS, for her hard work. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote in favor of this bill. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Iowa (Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS), the 
author of the legislation. 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I thank my colleagues on the Natural 
Resources Committee, and I thank 
Representative WESTERMAN for yield-
ing me time to speak. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong 
support of my bill, H.R. 4300, the Alex-
ander Lofgren Veterans in Parks Act. I 
was so proud to introduce this over-
whelmingly bipartisan legislation with 
a 
fellow 
veteran, 
Congressman 
GALLEGO. 
Our commonsense legislation would 
give our servicemembers, veterans, and 
Gold Star families free passes to all of 
our beautiful national parks and Fed-
eral lands for life. This is a reasonable 
piece of legislation that will support 
those who sacrifice so much for our lib-
erties. 
Our Nation is blessed to have some of 
the most beautiful national parks and 
public lands. Each year, millions of 
Americans access the more than 2,000 
Federal recreation areas, including na-
tional parks, national forests, and 
wildlife refuges. This includes some of 
the Nation’s most iconic national 
treasures, from Acadia National Park 
in Maine and the Dry Tortugas in Flor-
ida to the Redwood National and State 
Parks forest in California and the 
Gates of the Arctic in Alaska. 
In 2020, the America the Beautiful 
annual pass became free for veterans 
and Gold Star families. However, this 
change for veterans has never been put 
into law and could be undone in future 
years. 
My bill protects these veteran passes 
by codifying them into law and making 
them lifetime passes instead of annual 
passes that would have to be re-sent 
every year. Making these passes life-
time instead of annual also makes the 
job of the Park Service easier and en-
sures our veterans have full access to 
the benefits they so richly deserve. 
Finally, my legislation also creates 
annual passes for current servicemem-
bers, which can be converted into life-
time passes once they retire. 
From sea to shining sea, we are a Na-
tion of incredible beauty and biodiver-
sity. Congress recognizes the mental 
and physical health benefits of outdoor 
recreation for current servicemembers 
and veterans. In fact, I think at our 
hearing, there was not a dry eye when 
Captain John Paluska spoke on behalf 
of this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, as a 24-year Army vet-
eran, I understand the sacrifices made 
by our military and their loved ones 
and believe that we must do whatever 
we can to honor these VIPs. My bill 
provides these Americans with free ac-
cess to the land they have sacrificed to 
defend. 
Our national parks are there for all 
of us. Getting outside into nature and 
enjoying our beautiful country pro-
vides an outlet and escape with mental 
and physical benefits. No one is more 
worthy of experiencing open access to 
these incredible places than the men 
and women who have fought to keep us 
free and the families who have made 
the ultimate sacrifice. 
Unfortunately, it is all too easy to 
pay lip service to the military’s sac-
rifice but then not follow through with 
action to recognize their service. We 
can never fully repay our veterans for 
their service and their sacrifice, but we 
want to show our gratitude by giving 
them lifetime access to America’s most 
beautiful landscapes. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to 
join in supporting my commonsense 
bill, H.R. 4300, the Alexander Lofgren 
Veterans in Parks Act. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON). 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking mem-
ber for yielding, and I thank the gen-
tlewoman for her sponsorship of this. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 4300, the Veterans in Parks Act. 
Across the country, our national 
parks provide endless opportunities for 
Americans to learn about our Nation’s 
history and culture. Additionally, na-
tional parks generate significant rec-
reational opportunities, which encour-
age visitors to spend time in the out-
doors and enjoy nature. 
From Gettysburg to Independence 
Park, and the Allegheny Portage Rail-
road to Valley Forge, Pennsylvania is 
home to 19 national parks and 7 herit-
age areas providing these benefits to 
Pennsylvanians throughout the Com-
monwealth and visitors alike. As the 
representative of Pennsylvania’s 15th 
Congressional District, it continues to 
be an honor to serve our veterans, Ac-
tive-Duty servicemen and -women, and 
proud military families. 
This legislation would simply give 
veterans and Gold Star families free 
access for life to public lands and also 
provide free annual passes to Active- 
Duty servicemembers. Studies show 
outdoor recreation is an effective way 
to decrease symptoms of PTSD and 
help veterans reintegrate with civilian 
life. This legislation is a step in the 
right direction when it comes to assist-
ing our veterans and Active-Duty serv-
icemembers’ health. 
H.R. 4300 is one way that we can say 
thank you to our brave men and 
women in uniform who have selflessly 
served and have already given so much 
to protect our Nation. 
Mr. Speaker, as the father of a com-
bat-wounded soldier and as the ranking 
member of the Committee on Agri-
culture, which also received referral on 
this legislation, I support this legisla-
tion. I urge my colleagues to vote in its 
favor. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
again urge adoption of this bill, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I com-
mend my colleague from Iowa for her 
leadership on this bill, and I urge my 
colleagues to support the legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. 
DINGELL) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4300, as 
amended. 
The question was taken.

opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, on that I

woman from Michigan. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Michigan? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, S. 325, introduced by 
Senator LISA MURKOWSKI from Alaska, 
provides a 2-year extension for the 
Alyce 
Spotted 
Bear 
and 
Walter 
Soboleff Commission on Native Chil-
dren to publish its report and make 
policy recommendations for Federal, 
State, and Tribal programs that serve 
Native children. 
Native children experience severe 
health and socioeconomic disparities 
compared to all other racial and ethnic 
groups in the United States due to the 
cycles of intergenerational trauma. It 
is the Federal Government’s trust re-
sponsibility to provide for the health 
and well-being of Native children. How-
ever, the COVID–19 pandemic delayed 
much of the Commission’s essential 
work. 
Passage of S. 325 will grant the Com-
mission an extension of time and en-
sure that the report best addresses the 
needs of Native children through much- 
needed expertise and cultural wisdom. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the distin-
guished Senator from Alaska, Senator 
MURKOWSKI, for introducing and cham-
pioning this critically important legis-
lation, as well as my dear friend and 
Committee on Natural Resources col-
league, DON
YOUNG, for leading the 
House companion bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support S. 325, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
b 1545 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 
325, which would amend the Alyce 
Spotted Bear and Walter Soboleff Com-
mission on Native Children Act, to ex-
tend the deadline of the Commission’s 
report from 3 years to 5 years after the 
Commission is fully appointed and 
fully funded. 
In 2016, the Alyce Spotted Bear and 
Walter Soboleff Commission on Native 
Children Act was signed into law. 
The purpose of the legislation was to 
establish, within the U.S. Department 
of Justice’s Office of Tribal Justice, a 
commission on Native children and to 
conduct a comprehensive study regard-
ing the Federal and local programs, 
grants, and support available for Na-
tive communities and Native children. 
The legislation stipulated that 3 
years after the date on which the Com-
mission is fully appointed and funded, 
the Commission shall issue a report to 
Congress with its recommendations on 
how to achieve better use of existing 
resources, 
increased 
coordination, 
measurable outcomes, stronger data, 
enhanced private sector partnerships, 
and implementation of best practices. 
Funding for the Commission was not 
authorized in the enacted version. 
However, the fiscal year 2019 Consoli-
dated 
Appropriations 
Act 
provided 
$400,000 to the Commission. 
With delays in securing funding and 
the full appointment of Commission 
members, the Commission was not able 
to hold its first meeting until Decem-
ber 2019. In addition, the COVID–19 pan-
demic delayed much of the Commis-
sion’s work. 
In response to these challenges faced 
by the Commission, my good friend, 
Mr. YOUNG, introduced the House com-
panion bill to S. 325, to ensure that the 
Commission has adequate time to 
produce a complete and comprehensive 
report. 
I would like to commend Mr. YOUNG 
for his continued tireless work on be-
half of American Indian and Alaska 
Natives. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the 
measure, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield such time as he may consume to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Alaska 
(Mr. 
YOUNG), the dean of the House. 
Mr. YOUNG. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. I would 
like to thank Chairman GRIJALVA and, 
of course, the ranking member, Mr. 
WESTERMAN, for the support of sched-
uling this bill for final passage. I would 
also like to thank my good friend, 
DEBBIE DINGELL, for her work. I have 
been sitting and listening to these 
bills, these are good bills. So, thank 
you, I appreciate it. 
Mr. Speaker, I introduced this bill on 
the House side. I would like to thank 
Congressman CASE
and Congressman 
KAHELE for their sponsorship and sup-
port. 
As has been mentioned, S. 325 gives 
Alyce 
Spotted 
Bear 
and 
Walter 
Soboleff Commission on Native Chil-
dren 2 more years to complete their 
important work and report their find-
ings to Congress. 
The Commission is tasked with con-
ducting a comprehensive study of Fed-
eral, State, local, and Tribal programs 
that serve Native children with the 
goal of developing a system that deliv-
ers wraparound service for Native 
youth. 
The Commission was put in place, as 
I mentioned, in 2016, but was not able 
to have its first meeting until 2019. 
Further meetings were delayed by 
COVID, and as we know, things weren’t 
really going according to scale. 
But my good friend, Gloria O’Neill, 
serves as chairman of the Commission, 
and I am thankful for her leadership on 
this issue, and her commitment to en-
suring the Commission has enough 
time to do its important work. 
Without this extension, the Commis-
sion would be rushing to conclude their 
regional meetings in order to meet 
Congress’ deadline. 
When doing this work, it could have 
far-reaching effects on Native youth 
and Native communities. We need to 
ensure the Commission has enough 
time to do good work and consider the 
options. 
Also, my colleagues have noticed re-
cently, in a lot of publications, about 
some of my schools concerning Native 
students—Native youth, and especially 
in Canada. Will this Commission also 
look at that process and see what has 
happened in the past, and we can avoid 
what is going to occur in the future? 
This is a needed Commission and a 
needed bill. I urge my colleagues to 
support S. 325. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
urge adoption of this bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mrs. 
DINGELL. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I, 
again, thank the leadership of the dean 
of the House, Mr. YOUNG, on this, and 
Senator MURKOWSKI
for the Native 
children. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
legislation, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. 
DINGELL) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, S. 325. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed. 
f 
ACCESS TO CONGRESSIONALLY 
MANDATED REPORTS ACT 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 2485) to require the Director of 
the Government Publishing Office to 
establish and maintain an online portal 
accessible to the public that allows the 
public to obtain electronic copies of all 
congressionally mandated reports in 
one place, and for other purposes, as 
amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
the District of Columbia (Ms. NORTON) 
and the gentleman from Pennsylvania 
(Mr. KELLER) each will control 20 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days within which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure before us. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Rep-
resentative MIKE QUIGLEY for his per-
sistence in pursuing this good govern-
ment legislation. Hopefully, we can get 
this bill enacted this Congress. 
H.R. 2485, the Access to Congression-
ally Mandated Reports Act, is a non- 
controversial bill that has been ap-
proved by the Oversight and Reform 
Committee many times. 
The bill is a commonsense measure 
that would make the government more 
transparent and accountable. It would 
create a one-stop-shop where Congress 
and members of the public could access 
agency reports to Congress. 
Federal agencies submit thousands of 
reports to Congress each year. This bill 
will improve congressional oversight 
by making it easy to find and access 
those reports. 
H.R. 2485 would give the public access 
to agency reports. Currently, members 
of the public often have to file requests 
under the Freedom of Information Act 
to obtain agency reports to Congress 
because many of these reports are not 
available online. 
An online library of Federal reports 
would improve our ability to use the 
information in them to make sound 
policy. It also would encourage agency 
compliance 
with 
reporting 
require-
ments. 
Finally, it would support timely ac-
cess to the reports by State and local 
governments, students, academics, and 
others with the additional benefit of 
decreasing the burden on agencies to 
process Freedom of Information Act re-
quests. 
The Access to Congressionally Man-
dated Reports Act is endorsed by al-
most 40 organizations from across the 
political spectrum. 
Mr. Speaker, I support this bill and 
urge all my colleagues to support it, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, the Access to Congres-
sionally Mandated Reports Act, long 
championed by my colleague, Mr. MIKE 
QUIGLEY, represents an honest effort to 
modernize Congress and improve the 
Article I power of the legislative 
branch. 
The bill does this by bolstering the 
ability of Congress to access and under-
stand the thousands of legally man-
dated reports compiled by the execu-
tive branch and sent to Congress each 
year. 
It is estimated that Federal agencies 
write and send to Congress over 4,000 
written reports every 2 years. That is a 
lot of valuable information for the 
American people and their representa-
tives in the U.S. House. 
These mandated reports contain in-
sights into activities of Federal agen-
cies. Insights like the status of an 
agency establishing a new program or 
updates on efforts to combat waste, 
fraud, and abuse. However, there is cur-
rently no central inventory for con-
gressional Members or our staff to ac-
cess these reports. 
Most reports are sent over via email 
and can get lost in the shuffle of an 
ever-changing and evolving Congress, 
or they are only sent to specific com-
mittees which prevents the rest of Con-
gress and the public from viewing 
them. This bill fixes that problem. 
H.R. 2485 establishes a central and 
publicly available portal of these re-
ports at the Government Publishing 
Office. Congress and members of the 
public will be able to fully search, sort, 
and 
download 
reports 
from 
this 
website. This gives the whole of Con-
gress and America’s citizens conven-
ient access to all executive agency re-
ports submitted to Congress. These are 
reports that the taxpayers paid for. 
This bill also includes protections for 
classified and sensitive information in 
keeping with the principles of the 
Freedom of Information Act. 
In summary, once Congress can get a 
handle on all the mandated reports, we 
can take actions to reduce any unnec-
essary agency reporting burdens. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, 
Mr. MIKE
QUIGLEY, for working to-
gether with the House Oversight and 
Reform Committee’s ranking member, 
JAMES COMER, on this good government 
bill, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, if the 
gentleman from Pennsylvania has no 
further speakers, I am prepared to 
close, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman 
from 
Kentucky 
(Mr. 
COMER). 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
support the Access to Congressionally 
Mandated Reports Act, which I have 
worked on along with my House Over-
sight 
and 
Reform 
Committee 
col-
league, Congressman MIKE QUIGLEY.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3872 
July 26, 2021 
This bill will help modernize Con-
gress 
and 
expand 
the 
legislative 
branch’s oversight over the executive 
branch. 
Every year, Federal agencies prepare 
and submit thousands of in-depth re-
ports to various congressional commit-
tees. These reports cover topics such as 
the implementation status of new 
agency programs or legal requirements 
in recently passed laws. 
They also cover the ongoing effort of 
the Federal Government to address 
waste, fraud, and abuse as well as pol-
icy priorities like our Nation’s finan-
cial stability, cybersecurity, homeland 
security, and public health readiness. 
In short, congressionally mandated 
reports are a key part of how the 
United States Congress fulfills its Arti-
cle I oversight duties over the execu-
tive branch. 
Beyond holding hearings and passing 
laws, the legislative branch mandates 
that executive branch agencies report 
to the House and Senate on their ac-
tivities and compliance with the law. 
As representatives in the House, we 
have an obligation to the American 
people to maintain constant visibility 
into the executive branch. And con-
gressionally mandated reports are one 
of our most useful, daily oversight 
tools. 
However, there is a problem. Con-
gress lacks a central inventory of the 
reports we require Federal agencies to 
send us. This makes it hard to know for 
certain if agencies are fulfilling their 
legal reporting obligations or for new 
congressional Members and staff to 
find reports from previous years. 
Additionally, the American public 
has little to no access to these valuable 
reports, which contain key insights 
into agency programs and missions 
that directly affect them. 
H.R. 2485 is the solution we need. 
With the bill’s establishment of a sin-
gle website at the Government Pub-
lishing Office we will be able to find 
the reports we need when we need 
them. 
A fully searchable inventory of these 
reports makes complete sense in the 
modern world. This new portal will en-
able each and every House Member and 
staffer to do their job on behalf of the 
American people they represent. 
After all, American taxpayer dollars 
are funding the preparation of these re-
ports as well as the agency activities 
they report on. 
And for sensitive reports containing 
classified information, there are pro-
tections to ensure that only the proper 
congressional committees will be able 
to access such reports. 
Again, I want to thank my colleague, 
Mr. MIKE QUIGLEY, for working with 
me to improve and reintroduce this 
government-wide transparency bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support H.R. 2485. 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
passage of H.R. 2485, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from the District of 
Columbia (Ms. NORTON) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, 
H.R. 2485, as amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
The title of the bill was amended so 
as to read: ‘‘A bill to require the Direc-
tor of the Government Publishing Of-
fice to establish and maintain a single

SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EF-
FECTS. 
The budgetary effects of this Act, for the 
purpose of complying with the Statutory 
Pay-As-You-Go-Act of 2010, shall be deter-
mined by reference to the latest statement 
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in 
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the Senate Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
the District of Columbia (Ms. NORTON) 
and the gentleman from Pennsylvania 
(Mr. KELLER) each will control 20 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days within which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure before us. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, the bill before us, the 
Congressional 
Budget 
Justification 
Transparency Act, is a commonsense, 
good government measure every Mem-
ber should support. 
It would require the congressional 
budget justification documents that 
agencies 
prepare 
for 
congressional 
committees to be posted online in a 
centralized, searchable database. 
This would make these detailed, 
plain-language explanations of how 
agencies plan to spend taxpayer dollars 
more accessible to the public. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Rep-
resentative MIKE QUIGLEY for his work 
on the House companion to this meas-
ure. He has a long history as a strong 
advocate of transparency in the oper-
ations of the Federal Government. 
This bill builds on the work of the 
Committee to improve government 
transparency by allowing the public to 
more easily learn about how Federal 
agencies spend their taxpayer dollars. 
Mr. Speaker, I support this bill, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 
272, the Congressional Budget Jus-
tification Transparency Act. 
The Congressional Budget Justifica-
tion Transparency Act is a long over-
due reform that would ensure Congress 
and the Nation’s taxpayers can under-
stand the full scope and context of the 
annual Federal budget. 
I would like to thank Congressman 
MIKE
QUIGLEY
for working together 
with House Oversight and Reform Com-
mittee Ranking Member COMER to pass 
the nearly identical companion bill, 
H.R. 22, through the House at the be-
ginning of this year. 
Last year, more than $6.8 trillion was 
spent to fight the COVID–19 pandemic. 
Public 
spending 
transparency 
re-
sources 
like 
USAspending.gov 
and 
PandemicOversight.gov, 
helped 
the 
public track agency spending, but they 
are not enough. 
Annual Federal agency budget jus-
tifications provide detailed and plain 
language explanations of how agencies 
plan to spend congressionally appro-
priated funds. 
b 1600 
However, these necessary justifica-
tion materials are scattered across 
agency websites and often difficult to 
find. This bipartisan legislation will 
ensure the American people and Con-
gress can easily access these important 
budget justification materials to re-
view proposed agency spending. 
The bill requires every agency to 
make their annual budget justification 
materials publicly available on a single 
website. To do this, the bill requires 
the Office of Management and Budget 
to issue a full listing of agency budget 
justifications and the individual agen-
cy web pages where they are posted. 
Thanks to another law produced by 
the House Oversight and Reform Com-
mittee, the 2018 Good Accounting Obli-
gation in Government Act, congres-
sional budget justifications also now 
list unimplemented Inspector General 
audit and GAO report recommenda-
tions. This means the bill will also help 
Congress and the public annually track 
open 
IG 
and 
GAO 
oversight 
rec-
ommendations. 
The Congressional Budget Justifica-
tion Transparency Act makes the exec-
utive branch annual budget process 
truly open to the American people and 
provides needed transparency of each 
agency’s detailed budget justifications. 
The American public and their con-
gressional Representatives deserve full 
access to agency plans to spend their 
hard-earned tax dollars. America’s tax 
dollars must be used wisely, and I en-
courage my colleagues to support this 
bipartisan bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, if the 
gentleman from Pennsylvania has no 
further speakers, I am prepared to 
close. 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman 
from 
Kentucky 
(Mr. 
COMER). 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
thank the gentleman from Pennsyl-
vania for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 
272, the Congressional Budget Jus-
tification Transparency Act. 
This bill is a timely and important 
reform to ensure Congress and the pub-
lic can review all Federal spending. 
This bipartisan legislation make it 
possible for the public and every mem-
ber of Congress to readily find and 
compare the annual budget justifica-
tion and supporting materials that 
each agency prepares and sends to Con-
gress. This detailed review is critical 
to ensuring that our tax dollars are 
spent properly. 
This reform is also needed now more 
than ever. Last year alone, the Federal 
Government spent more than $6.8 tril-
lion. Unfortunately, this trend in mas-
sive government spending does not 
seem to be slowing down any time 
soon. 
The Congressional Budget Justifica-
tion Transparency Act will require all 
agencies to make their budget jus-
tification materials available online in 
plain language. In doing so, this legis-
lation will empower Congress’ ability 
to conduct oversight of Federal agen-
cies’ use of taxpayer dollars by consoli-
dating agency data. It will also provide 
much-needed 
transparency 
to 
the 
American people. 
Requiring each agency to provide de-
tailed plain language explanations of 
how they intend to spend taxpayer dol-
lars ensures Americans can review 
those decisions at any time. 
I want to thank my colleague, Con-
gressman MIKE QUIGLEY, for working 
with me on H.R. 22 which we were able 
to pass through the House back on Jan-
uary 5 of this year. I was glad to see 
the Senate’s recent action advancing 
this much-needed reform bill through 
Congress. 
This legislation illustrates the im-
portance of working across the aisle to 
improve congressional oversight to en-
sure American tax dollars are spent ef-
ficiently and effectively. Today the 
House sends the Congressional Budget 
Justification Transparency Act to the 
President’s desk. 
Mr. Speaker, I look forward to work-
ing on many more bipartisan govern-
ment accountability bills and encour-
age my colleagues to support this bill.

FEDERAL CAREER OPPORTUNITIES 
IN COMPUTER SCIENCE WORK ACT 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 3533) to establish occupational se-
ries for Federal positions in software 
development, 
software 
engineering, 
data science, and data management, 
and for other purposes, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 3533 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of 
Representatives of the United States of America 
in Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. OCCUPATIONAL SERIES FOR DIGITAL 
CAREER FIELDS. 
Not later than 270 days after the date of 
the enactment of this Act, the Director of 
the Office of Personnel Management, shall, 
pursuant to chapter 51 of title 5, United 
States Code, establish or update existing oc-
cupational series covering Federal Govern-
ment positions in the fields of software de-
velopment, 
software 
engineering, 
data 
science, and data management. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
the District of Columbia (Ms. NORTON) 
and the gentleman from Pennsylvania 
(Mr. KELLER) each will control 20 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
sert extraneous materials on H.R. 3533. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
3533, the Federal Career Opportunities 
in Computer Science Work Act. I com-
mend my colleagues, Representative 
OBERNOLTE and Representative WELCH, 
for their bipartisan work on this meas-
ure. 
This bill would require the Office of 
Personnel Management to update or es-
tablish occupational series for Federal 
civilian positions in software develop-
ment, 
software 
engineering, 
data 
science, and data management within 
270 days of enactment. 
It would implement a recommenda-
tion that was included in the final re-
port of the National Security Commis-
sion on Artificial Intelligence. In its 
report, the commission stated: ‘‘The 
artificial intelligence competition will 
not be won by the side with the best 
technology. It will be won by the side 
with the best, most diverse and tech- 
savvy talent.’’ 
To attract and retain digital talent, 
the commission recommended that the 
Federal Government create the civilian 
occupational series that are included in 
this bill. This bipartisan bill would 
help support recruitment of profes-
sionals with these specialized skills for 
Federal employment. 
This is an important step in helping 
Federal agencies recruit, hire, and re-
tain the talent that is needed to re-
main competitive in the digital do-
main. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this 
bill, I urge my colleagues to do the 
same, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
3533, the Federal Career Opportunities 
in Computer Science Work Act. 
In a world that increasingly relies on 
digital technologies, the Federal Gov-
ernment needs to be able to hire and 
attract the right talent; therefore, the 
ability to recruit and retain qualified 
software and data professionals is im-
portant, particularly as our govern-
ment and private sector must with-
stand more frequent and sophisticated 
cybersecurity threats. 
The National Security Commission 
on Artificial Intelligence released their 
final report earlier this year and found 
that ‘‘Digitally talented people should 
be able to reasonably expect to spend a 
career performing meaningful work fo-
cused on their field of expertise in gov-
ernment.’’ 
The report goes on to recommend 
that new Federal career fields in dig-
ital technologies be established by cre-
ating new civilian occupational series 
for software development, software en-
gineering, knowledge management, and 
data science. 
The bill under consideration requires 
the Office of Personnel Management to 
either update existing occupational se-
ries or create new ones in the fields of 
software development, software engi-
neering, data management, and data 
science. This will ensure that the Fed-
eral workforce represents current spe-
cialized fields necessary to bringing 
America’s Government into the 21st 
century. 
The bill also enables the Federal 
Government to better target recruiting 
and retain qualified professionals in 
these essential fields. 
I 
appreciate 
Congressman 
OBERNOLTE’s and Congressman WELCH’s 
leadership on this issue. I encourage 
my colleagues to support this smart 
government modernization bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
b 1615 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers. I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
OBERNOLTE), the sponsor of this bill. 
Mr. OBERNOLTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in support of my bill, the Federal Ca-
reer 
Opportunities 
in 
Computer 
Sciences Work Act. 
Mr. Speaker, I, along with most of 
the country, was recently horrified by 
the cyberattacks against critical parts 
of our national infrastructure, in par-
ticular, the cyberattack against Colo-
nial Pipeline that shut down gasoline 
deliveries for much of the Eastern 
United States and the cyberattacks 
against JBS meat processing, which 
disrupted operations at one of the larg-
est food processing facilities in our 
country. 
It has become increasingly clear that 
dealing with these threats will require 
highly trained professionals in the 
computer 
sciences 
and 
the 
data 
sciences as part of not just our civilian 
workforce but also our Federal work-
force. 
Unfortunately, many people are sur-
prised to learn that we do not cur-
rently have Federal career occupa-
tional series that are dedicated to the 
computer sciences. This bill, the Fed-
eral Career Opportunities in Computer 
Sciences Work Act, will establish those 
series in such fields as data manage-
ment, artificial intelligence, and soft-
ware engineering. This will enable our 
Federal Government to better attract 
and retain the highly qualified tech-
nical computer scientist talent that is 
needed to respond to these attacks in 
the future. 
This is bipartisan legislation. It is an 
easy and commonsense solution to this 
problem, and I urge support for this 
bill. 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers, and I am prepared to 
close. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my col-
leagues to support this bipartisan leg-
islation that will help improve the 
technical skills of our Federal work-
force and, ultimately, modernize our 
government. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
passage of H.R. 3533, and I yield back 
the balance of my time.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
the District of Columbia (Ms. NORTON) 
and the gentleman from Pennsylvania 
(Mr. KELLER) each will control 20 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days within which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
sert extraneous material on H.R. 3599. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H.R. 
3599, the Federal Rotational Cyber 
Workforce Program Act. This bill is 
the product of bipartisan cooperation 
of our Oversight and Reform Com-
mittee members, Representatives RO 
KHANNA and NANCY MACE, and I want 
to thank them for their work on this 
bill. 
Earlier this year, our committee held 
a hearing on the Government Account-
ability Office’s 2021 High-Risk Report, 
which details the areas of government 
operations at greatest risk of failing to 
meet the considerable challenges they 
face. 
Cybersecurity was near the top of the 
list, along with the cyber skills gap 
that persists across the Federal work-
force. As the Government Account-
ability Office report described, Federal 
agencies are struggling to ensure that 
staff have the skills required to address 
the critical cybersecurity risks and 
challenges that our government faces. 
Recent 
cyberattacks 
have 
dem-
onstrated the dire consequences of fail-
ing to improve the Federal Govern-
ment’s cybersecurity operations. These 
include the SolarWinds breach, in 
which Russian hackers infiltrated the 
networks of nine Federal agencies and 
went undetected for months. 
Around the same time, cyberattacks 
linked to the Chinese government tar-
geted Microsoft’s enterprise email soft-
ware and threatened the internal data 
of Federal agencies. In addition, Rus-
sian hackers successfully breached the 
servers of the U.S. Department of State 
and stole thousands of emails. 
The Federal Rotational Cyber Work-
force Program Act, as it is called, 
would 
enable 
cybersecurity 
profes-
sionals in the Federal Government to 
rotate through assignments outside of 
their regular position. This would 
allow more agencies to benefit from 
their enterprise and give program par-
ticipants the opportunities for profes-
sional 
development. 
The 
program 
would be authorized for 5 years and, 
after 3 years, the Government Account-
ability Office would assess the oper-
ation and effectiveness of the program. 
This legislation would go a long way 
toward improving Federal agencies’ ca-
pacity to strengthen cybersecurity op-
erations, help retain top talent, and fa-
cilitate the exchange of expertise in 
this critical field. 
The security of Federal information 
technology systems and data is essen-
tial to national security, to preserving 
public trust in government institu-
tions, and to ensuring that agencies 
meet their missions in serving the 
American people. 
I strongly support this bill, and I 
urge my colleagues to do the same. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, the Federal Govern-
ment has significant work to do on the 
cybersecurity front. My colleagues, 
Representatives KHANNA
and MACE, 
recognized this harsh reality when 
crafting their bill to improve our Fed-
eral workforce’s cybersecurity and IT 
expertise. 
We face many challenges, including 
adequately securing IT infrastructure 
from cyber intrusions, supply chain 
hacks, and ransomware, each the sub-
ject of recent front-page news. 
Our cyber readiness depends, in part, 
upon our ability to maintain a pre-
pared and capable Federal workforce to 
defend our Nation’s government from a 
relentless onslaught of cyberattacks. 
Toward that end, the Federal Rota-
tional Cyber Workforce Program Act 
continues efforts created and imple-
mented during the Trump administra-
tion to promote cyber rotational de-
tails throughout Federal agencies so 
that our valuable Federal cyber experts 
continue to sharpen their skills. 
This bill seeks to codify an addi-
tional 
rotational 
opportunity 
for 
cyber-focused professionals throughout 
the Federal Government. 
Former President Trump’s executive 
order, ‘‘America’s Cybersecurity Work-
force,’’ established a mechanism for 
Federal employees to be detailed to

other agencies through a cybersecurity 
rotational assignment program. The 
Federal Rotational Cyber Workforce 
Program Act places management of a 
similar type of program under the Of-
fice of Personnel Management. 
Importantly, for oversight purposes, 
the bill establishes requirements for a 
detailed operational plan and a report 
from the Government Accountability 
Office to enable congressional over-
sight. This will help Congress evaluate 
whether the rotational program is run-
ning as intended and meaningfully ad-
dressing both personnel and agency 
needs. 
If this new rotational program is not 
providing the intended value to the 
Federal Government, then Congress 
will have the opportunity to decline re-
authorizing the program after it sun-
sets in 5 years. This is a valuable safe-
ty valve to the expansion of the Fed-
eral Government, which I am glad to 
see included in this bill. 
I thank my colleagues for their work 
on this bipartisan bill, which builds 
upon the cyber workforce efforts of the 
prior administration. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. KHANNA). 
Mr. KHANNA. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Delegate NORTON
for her leadership, 
and I thank Ranking Member COMER 
for his leadership on the bill and, of 
course, Representative MACE, who has 
been a colleague and helped craft this. 
Everyone recognizes that our coun-
try faces cyberattacks. In the private 
sector, we don’t silo cybersecurity offi-
cials. You don’t say, ‘‘You just work in 
one department.’’ They rotate through 
a company. We shouldn’t have separate 
silos in the Federal Government. 
This bill is just common sense. It 
says that we need to have a rotational 
system in the Federal Government so 
that you can have expertise from all 
the different agencies, and we can have 
a comprehensive response. It helps us 
get talent. And it is bipartisan. 
We should give credit to the previous 
administration 
for having, as was 
pointed out, the executive order. I 
worked with Matt Lira at the previous 
White House. There is nothing that is 
partisan about making sure that Amer-
ica isn’t attacked with cybercrimes 
and cyberattacks. That is a bipartisan 
initiative, and this does build on the 
work they did. It makes it stronger, 
and we put, ultimately, resources to-
ward it. 
But I am proud of the work. I am 
proud of working with Representative 
MACE on it. Frankly, I think we ought 
to be doing more things in this body in 
a 
bipartisan 
way 
that 
strengthen 
American security. 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as she may consume to the 
gentlewoman from South Carolina (Ms. 
MACE). 
Ms. MACE. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise 
in support of H.R. 3599, the Federal Ro-
tational 
Cyber 
Workforce 
Program 
Act. It is a long title, but it is a very 
good bill. I thank my colleague, RO 
KHANNA, for his leadership. 
Cybersecurity is national security, 
and this is one area where it is not 
Democrat or Republican. When 11 Fed-
eral agencies were hacked last year by 
an organization affiliated with Russia, 
they didn’t care if you had an R or a D 
by your name. 
Imagine if, in the Federal Govern-
ment, or at least a portion of the Fed-
eral Government, we could work and 
operate more like a business than a bu-
reaucracy. Well, we can do that right 
here today with H.R. 3599. 
I thank, again, RO KHANNA for his 
leadership and for allowing me the op-
portunity to work together with him 
on this. This is the third bill I have 
worked on that I hope will pass on the 
floor of the House tonight. 
We have an opportunity to show tre-
mendous leadership here today. I have 
heard a number of my colleagues here 
this afternoon, Republicans and Demo-
crats, working together for the Amer-
ican people, putting the American peo-
ple first, and that is what we are doing. 
Every day, criminal elements are at-
tempting to steal our secrets, disrupt 
our infrastructure, and damage our 
economy by extorting money from 
businesses and organizations across the 
United States. 
Most recently, in the State of South 
Carolina, we saw the high-profile Colo-
nial Pipeline hacking and attack. It is 
a reminder that America’s adversaries 
are creative and cunning and that our 
government must be the same to com-
bat this growing threat. 
It is imperative that our government 
be able to obtain, train, and retain the 
cyber and technology talent needed to 
counter these sophisticated hackers 
across the globe. The Federal Rota-
tional Cyber Workforce Program Act 
will allow Federal employees to col-
laborate and broaden their work expe-
riences, their knowledge, and their 
skill sets across Federal agencies, 
much in the same way their counter-
parts do in the private sector. 
I thank my colleagues today, Repub-
licans and Democrats, and I urge each 
and every one of them to vote in favor 
of this legislation this evening. 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers, and I am prepared to 
close. 
Mr. Speaker, it is important to im-
prove the readiness of our Nation’s 
cyber workforce through the expansion 
of cyber rotations between our Federal 
agencies. I encourage my colleagues to 
support this important legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
passage of H.R. 3599, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from the District of 
Columbia (Ms. NORTON) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, 
H.R. 3599, as amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, on that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3878 
July 26, 2021 
Mr. Speaker, this bill will give the 
District of Columbia the authority to 
increase the pay of the D.C. chief finan-
cial officer. D.C. requested that I intro-
duce this bill so that it can retain and 
recruit the best CFOs. At the outset, I 
want to emphasize that the CFO is paid 
exclusively with local D.C. funds, not 
Federal funds. 
Under the D.C. Home Rule Act, Con-
gress established a maximum rate of 
pay for the CFO, and the D.C. council 
has no authority to increase that rate. 
Congress does not cap, or otherwise es-
tablish, the pay of any other D.C. em-
ployee. Under this bill, the CFO would 
be paid at the greater of a rate equal to 
the maximum rate of pay of the CFO in 
current law or at a rate established in 
law by the District of Columbia. 
The CFO was established by Congress 
in 1995. Congress vested the CFO with 
extraordinary powers and designed the 
CFO to be independent of the D.C. 
Mayor and council. The CFO may be 
removed only for cause by the Mayor, 
subject to the approval of two-thirds of 
the council and a 30-day congressional 
review and comment period. This bill 
would maintain the independence of 
the CFO by establishing a permanent 
floor on the CFO’s pay and by prohib-
iting the council from reducing the 
CFO’s pay during the CFO’s term. 
The D.C. CFO is unique in the United 
States. D.C. cannot obligate or expend 
funds without the CFO’s certification 
that available funds exist. The CFO 
manages a $17 billion budget that con-
sists of State, county, and city func-
tions, and the CFO has more than 1,700 
employees. 
D.C. is currently searching for a per-
manent CFO. Although the CFO is the 
most important non-elected official in 
the district, more than 20 D.C. employ-
ees are paid more than the CFO. D.C. 
must compete with both the private 
and public sectors for high-quality 
CFOs, and there are many private- and 
public-sector CFOs who are paid more 
than the D.C. CFO. 
I thank Chairwoman MALONEY
for 
her support of this bill, and I thank 
Ranking Member COMER for his support 
of this bill in committee. 
This bill is critical to the financial 
operations of the District of Columbia. 
I urge my colleagues to support it, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, the chief financial offi-
cer plays an essential role in managing 
the District of Columbia’s financial 
challenges and should be properly com-
pensated for such efforts. 
I understand some of my colleagues 
may be concerned about the financial 
health of the District of Columbia, and 
I share many of those concerns. But 
that is why we need to ensure the best 
people are selected to fill the CFO posi-
tion. 
One way to attract the best can-
didates in a job search is by paying 
professionals a competitive salary. The 
CFO is responsible for the District’s fi-
nancial 
operations, 
including 
more 
than 1,700 staff members in the dis-
trict’s multi-billion-dollar budget. 
If the District believes that it needs 
to adjust the rate of pay for this posi-
tion to recruit a more qualified senior 
financial management official, then 
Congress should support such efforts. 
I believe compensation for local ex-
ecutives is a matter best handled at 
the local level, and I believe this bill 
balances local autonomy with a com-
monsense solution for attracting talent 
to the District. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, because I 
believe this is sensible legislation and 
good for the financial health of the Dis-
trict of Columbia, I will vote in support 
of this sensible bill, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
passage of H.R. 1204, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from the District of 
Columbia (Ms. NORTON) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, 
H.R. 1204. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, on that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are

SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EF-
FECTS. 
The budgetary effects of this Act, for the 
purpose of complying with the Statutory 
Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be deter-
mined by reference to the latest statement 
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in 
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
the District of Columbia (Ms. NORTON) 
and the gentleman from Pennsylvania 
(Mr. KELLER) each will control 20 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure before us. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 978 would require 
Federal agencies to establish protocols 
and protections to ensure the health 
and safety of Federal employees upon 
returning 
to 
their 
regular 
workstations. 
Each agency would be responsible for 
posting its policy on its website and 
properly notifying employees of the 
procedures within 60 days of enactment 
or 30 days before a closed worksite re-
opens. 
Within 6 months, the inspector gen-
eral of each agency must submit to 
Congress a review on implementation 
and communication of the procedures. 
I am proud to be an original cospon-
sor of this bill, which is named in 
honor of one of Representative CON-
NOLLY’s constituents, a Federal em-
ployee, 
who 
died 
tragically 
of 
coronavirus in May of last year. 
Federal 
employees 
both 
here 
in 
Washington, D.C., and across the coun-
try have been on the front lines of the 
government 
response 
to 
the 
coronavirus pandemic from the begin-
ning. 
As more are preparing to return to 
their regular worksites, this legislation 
will help make sure that policies are 
clearly conveyed to employees so that 
return happens safely. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support 
this bill, and I urge Members to vote 
‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. KELLER. I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to express 
sincere condolences to the family of 
Mr. Suthammanont. 
The global COVID–19 pandemic has 
meant painful losses for many families 
across America. 
I want to thank my colleague, Mr. 
CONNOLLY, for his work on this bill. 
Discussing this legislation is a re-
minder as to how precious life is. Every 
loss impacts a community and the sur-
viving family members. 
Over the past year-and-a-half, the 
COVID–19 
pandemic 
has 
extraor-
dinarily challenged our Nation. For ex-
ample, the pandemic presented unprec-
edented workforce challenges for the 
Federal Government. Every State and 
territory were under a historically un-
precedented emergency declaration and 
sought assistance from Federal agen-
cies. 
Both the Trump and Biden adminis-
trations have issued numerous guid-
ance materials to Federal agencies to 
ensure the vital work of America’s 
Government could continue in a safe 
manner. 
This bill is well intentioned, and I 
support government-wide transparency 
to the American people and the Federal 
workforce. But the reality is, I feel 
that this bill is creating unnecessary 
and duplicative paperwork require-
ments. 
Both the Trump and Biden adminis-
trations publicly released much of the 
information this bill seeks to obtain, 
and the Biden administration con-
tinues to require the current planning 
the bill seeks. 
Further, putting restrictive report-
ing requirements on agencies may 
hinder the new administration’s ability 
to bring the Federal workforce back to 
work rapidly as it is determined safe to 
do so. I have concerns that it may be 
duplicating existing efforts of the Fed-
eral Government. 
We hope to continue working to-
gether with our colleagues across the 
aisle to make sure the Federal Govern-
ment is effectively delivering nec-
essary resources and services to the 
American people in a safe manner. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentleman from Vir-
ginia (Mr. CONNOLLY), my good friend 
and colleague. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, 
I 
thank my good friend and neighbor, 
the Congresswoman from the District 
of Columbia for her work, and I also 
thank the Republican manager for his 
kind remarks about a grieving family 
in my district. 
Last year, I brought a similar version 
of this bill to the floor requiring Fed-
eral agencies to communicate safety 
plans to their employees before return-
ing to their offices. It is not an extra 
layer of paperwork; it is a plan. You 
have just got to have a plan so that we 
don’t have more people like Chai 
Suthammanont dying from COVID. It 
seems to me that is something we 
ought to come together on, on a bipar-
tisan basis. 
While our country opens for business, 
COVID–19 cases and hospitalizations 
that had been declining just a month 
ago are again on the rise, and the dan-
gerous delta variant accounts for 83 
percent of those cases in the United 
States. 
Meanwhile, only 56.3 percent of the 
total U.S. population has had at least 
one dose of the vaccine, and in 16 
States, fewer than 50 percent of the 
population has had at least one dose, 
including, I believe, the State of the 
distinguished 
Republican 
manager 
today. 
We are clearly not out of the woods, 
and we must look to ensure the safety 
of both of our Federal workforce and 
our contract Federal workforce as they 
return to the workplace. 
The Chai Suthammanont Remem-
brance Act would require every Federal

agency to prepare and communicate a 
safety plan for how to do that. 
The plan would include descriptions 
of the personal protective equipment 
that the agency will provide to its on-
site employees and contractors; guid-
ance of other mitigation efforts; pro-
tections for employees whose work re-
quires them to travel offsite; testing, 
contact tracing, if necessary, and vac-
cination protocols; and procedures that 
ensure the continuity of operations in 
the event it is necessary to reverse on-
site requirements. 
The bill would also require every 
agency’s inspector general to report on 
whether the agency has published and 
implemented a safety plan consistent 
with CDC guidelines. 
We should not be looking to rush 
Federal employees back to offices no 
matter what the cost, because that 
cost is too high. Already, two of our 
colleagues in this body, who have been 
vaccinated, have contracted the delta 
variant, apparently, of COVID–19. Peo-
ple are at risk. 
The man for whom this bill is named 
tragically lost his life in May of 2020. 
He was an immigrant from Thailand, 
who came here at the age of 17. He 
built a life as a man known for helping 
others. 
Even in retirement, Chai’s call to 
service brought him to work as a Fed-
eral employee at the Marine Corps 
Community Services Child Develop-
ment Center in Quantico, Virginia. He 
worked to prepare meals for the chil-
dren of our Marines. He developed a 
unique handshake for every kid at the 
daycare, making every child feel spe-
cial and included. 
On April 27, 2020, Chai worked his last 
full shift at the daycare kitchen as one 
of his coworkers coughed repeatedly 
and looked very ill. The problem was 
there were no protocols in place. That 
person subsequently tested positive. 
b 1645 
A month later, after 13 days on a ven-
tilator, my constituent, Chai, lost his 
life unnecessarily, because there was 
no plan. There were no protocols. 
This bill would prevent that. This 
bill will save lives. I plead with my 
friends on the other side of the aisle, 
please let’s not make this a political 
pawn. 
For the sake of Chai, his surviving 
widow, his family, his loved ones, his 
colleagues at the Marine base at 
Quantico, can we not do the right 
thing? 
I could talk a lot about the need for 
this, Mr. Speaker. I could talk more 
about Chai and his family, but I rest on 
the hope and belief that today on this 
matter we will hear the better angels 
of our nature and make sure that no 
more Chais have to die because of a 
lack of protocol and the lack of a plan 
simply to protect the workforce in the 
Federal workplace. 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers, and I am prepared to 
close. 
Mr. Speaker, I do not intend to re-
quest a roll call vote on this bill, but I 
am concerned that it may be dupli-
cating existing efforts of the Federal 
Government. I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
passage of the bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from the District of 
Columbia (Ms. NORTON) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, 
H.R. 978, as amended. 
The question was taken.

PERFORMANCE ENHANCEMENT 
REFORM ACT 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I move to

(H.R. 2617) to amend section 1115 of 
title 31, United States Code, to amend 
the description of how performance 
goals are achieved, and for other pur-
poses, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 2617 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in

cial Officer (or the functional equivalent) to

ance plan described under subsection (b)(5).’’. 
SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EF-
FECTS. 
The budgetary effects of this Act, for the 
purpose of complying with the Statutory 
Pay-As-You-Go-Act of 2010, shall be deter-
mined by reference to the latest statement 
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-

such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage.

and the gentleman from Pennsylvania

woman from the District of Columbia. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
sert extraneous material on H.R. 2617. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, the Performance En-
hancement Reform Act, introduced by 
Government Operations subcommittee 
chair GERRY CONNOLLY and Ranking 
Member JODY HICE, builds on the Gov-
ernment Performance and Reform Act 
of 1993. That law requires Federal agen-
cies to develop 5-year strategic plans 
and annual performance plans and re-
ports. 
The law was updated in 2010 to re-
quire greater involvement by the Office 
of Management and Budget to incor-
porate governmentwide priority goals 
and to improve accountability by re-
quiring agencies to publish these plans 
and reports online. 
The Performance Enhancement Re-
form Act would require the develop-
ment of a more comprehensive annual 
performance plan through collabora-
tion between senior agency leaders, in-
cluding chief human capital officers, 
chief performance officers, chief infor-
mation officers, and the chief financial 
officer. 
The bill would also require agency 
performance plans to include descrip-
tions of any skill set the agency needs 
to meet its performance goals. This 
would be an important reform to iden-
tify any gaps in expertise or resources 
an agency must address to accomplish 
its goals. 
This commonsense, bipartisan meas-
ure will enhance agency management 
and strengthen the focus on achieving 
the agencies’ missions.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3881 
July 26, 2021 
I urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 
2617, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, the Performance En-
hancement Reform Act would require 
proper agency collaboration with an-
nual agency performance planning. 
This bill directly addresses a problem 
where Federal agency technology and 
data resources sometimes struggle to 
support agency operational workflow 
and programmatic goals. 
It recognizes the reality that agency 
leadership must directly involve their 
technology and data leaders in stra-
tegic planning. 
Under the Government Performance 
and Results Act of 1993 and the Govern-
ment Performance and Results Mod-
ernization Act of 2010, Federal agencies 
are required to create annual perform-
ance plans. 
The Performance Enhancement Re-
form Act puts the agency chief per-
formance 
improvement 
officers 
in 
charge of coordinating the annual 
agency performance goals. 
The bill will also make sure that the 
agency’s performance planning process 
considers the resources necessary to 
support operations and achieve mission 
success. 
Such resources include information 
technology 
capabilities, 
supporting 
data assets, and human workforce ca-
pacity and skills. 
It also directly ensures that during 
this annual planning, the agency chief 
information officers, chief data offi-
cers, and chief financial officers are 
consulted on whether the performance 
goals are realistic and proper resources 
exist. 
I want to recognize my colleagues, 
Mr. CONNOLLY and Mr. HICE, for their 
work crafting this smart legislation in 
the House Oversight Committee. 
Agencies should be committing to 
goals that have a real chance of suc-
ceeding, and this legislation requires 
the proper coordination to make that 
happen. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CON-
NOLLY). 
Mr. 
CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman from District 
of Columbia, and I thank Mr. KELLER, 
the Republican manager, for his kind 
words and his support. 
Current law requires Federal agen-
cies to develop a performance plan 
every year that defines the agency’s 
mission, summarizes strategic goals 
and objectives, and identifies strate-
gies to achieve them. 
Agencies use that plan to align re-
sources and guide decision-making to 
accomplish priorities and improve out-
comes. 
These performance plans should sup-
port planning across organizational op-
erating units and describe how agency 
components are working together to-
ward common results that serve the 
public. 
They should inform agency decision- 
making about the need for major new 
acquisitions, strategic human capital 
planning, evaluations, and other evi-
dence-building and evidence-capacity 
building investments. 
Moreover, the performance plans can 
also stimulate innovation to advance 
agency goals. 
With such a broad and robust pur-
pose, these plans should be prepared 
collaboratively by agency leadership 
using the best available data and evi-
dence to form a strong foundation from 
which to execute agency missions. 
Current law, however, requires only 
the chief human capital officer to con-
tribute to the creation of this perform-
ance plan. Current law does not require 
agencies to incorporate data and evi-
dence or information technology solu-
tions into their performance plans. In 
the 21st century. 
These narrow requirements overlook 
the invaluable expertise of key stake-
holders and crucial resources in the 
formation of agency plans and exclude 
a critical area of agency planning. 
For example, chief information offi-
cers must identify and plan for an 
agency’s IT needs. 
IT is critical to mission delivery at 
every agency. Missions are threatened 
by outdated legacy systems, software, 
and hardware, to say nothing of their 
being cyber insecure. 
CIOs deserve a seat at the table to 
engage in performance planning that 
drives meaningful IT modernization so 
agencies can provide the critical serv-
ices upon which the American public 
relies. The pandemic has certainly 
made that clear. 
Current law exacerbates the lack of 
collaboration that plagues leadership 
in many Federal agencies and stymies 
successful IT modernization. 
The Performance Enhancement Re-
form Act requires agencies to integrate 
IT modernization and evidence metrics 
more effectively into their perform-
ance plans and gives the CIO a seat at 
the table. 
The bill requires agency performance 
plans to include descriptions of human 
capital, training, data and evidence, 
IT, and skill sets needed for the agency 
to meet its performance goals. 
Finally, the bill requires perform-
ance plans to include descriptions of 
technology modernization investments, 
system 
upgrades, 
staff 
technology 
skills and expertise needed, stake-
holder input and feedback, and other 
resources and strategies. 
As the distinguished gentlewoman 
from the District of Columbia men-
tioned in her opening remarks, this is a 
bipartisan bill. My ranking member, 
Mr. HICE from Georgia, collaborated 
with us fully in trying to get to this 
point. 
This is a good government measure. I 
certainly commend it to all of our col-
leagues. If we approve this, we will 
take a giant leap forward in trying to 
modernize performance planning for 
every Federal agency to serve the 
American public better. 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers, and I am prepared to 
close. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill would ensure 
the 
creation 
of 
more 
realistic 
capability- and resource-based agency 
performance goals. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
smart government reform bill, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
passage of H.R. 2617, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from the District of 
Columbia (Ms. NORTON) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, 
H.R. 2617, as amended. 
The question was taken.

AUTHORITY FOR NATIONAL CYBER 
DIRECTOR TO ACCEPT DETAILS 
ON NONREIMBURSABLE BASIS 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 
2382) to authorize the National Cyber 
Director to accept details from other 
elements of the Federal Government on 
nonreimbursable basis, and for other 
purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 2382 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled,

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-

and the gentleman from Pennsylvania 
(Mr. KELLER) each will control 20 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
sert extraneous materials on S. 2382. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise in support of S. 2382, which 
would allow the National Cyber Direc-
tor to accept details from other ele-
ments of the Federal Government as on 
a nonreimbursable basis. 
Last year the Committee on Over-
sight and Reform helped advance legis-
lation to establish the Office of the Na-
tional Cyber Director in the Executive 
Office of the President. The bipartisan 
effort fulfilled a key recommendation 
of the U.S. Cyberspace Solarium Com-
mission, which was established by the 
2019 National Defense Authorization 
Act to review the condition of our Na-
tion’s cybersecurity posture and to de-
velop solutions to defend against cyber 
threats. 
b 1700 
The National Cyber Director Act was 
signed into law through last year’s Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act, cre-
ating a centralized cybersecurity posi-
tion in the White House to assist in the 
development and streamlining of the 
Federal Government’s strategy, coordi-
nation, and response to cyber threats. 
We were thrilled to see President 
Biden nominate and the Senate con-
firm Chris Inglis, a widely-respected 
member of the Solarium Commission, 
as the Nation’s first National Cyber Di-
rector. Now, Mr. Inglis needs a team to 
get to work immediately to address cy-
bersecurity, which remains one of the 
most urgent threats on the Govern-
ment Accountability Office’s high-risk 
list. 
Indeed, the State and non-state ac-
tors from Russia, China, Iran, North 
Korea, and all corners of the globe are 
waging a silent war capable of shutting 
down 
our 
critical 
infrastructure, 
breaching our sensitive information 
system, and jeopardizing critical sec-
tors in America and globally. 
Until Congress acts to provide the Of-
fice of the National Cyber Director its 
first appropriation, the Office requires 
the ability to bring in details on a non-
reimbursable basis. This bill would 
grant that authority. 
Cyberattacks 
are 
critical, 
wide-
spread, complex, and escalating as a 
threat to our national and economic 
security. A challenge as grave and per-
vasive as cybersecurity requires that 
our government be strategic, orga-
nized, and ready. It is imperative that 
we pass this bill immediately to allow 
the Office of the National Cyber Direc-
tor to get up running as it awaits its 
full appropriation. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this 
bill, and I urge my colleagues to do the 
same. I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, the National Cyber Di-
rector, or NCD, is a recently congres-
sionally authorized position for coordi-
nating our Nation’s cyber infrastruc-
ture and activities located within the 
Executive Office of the President. Ac-
cording to the Biden administration’s 
statutory interpretation of the NCD’s 
authorizing statute, Chris Inglis, the 
newly designated National Cyber Di-
rector, cannot staff his office with 
qualified talent on loan from other 
Federal agencies. 
The administration has determined 
that the NCD’s authorizing statute 
does not provide the necessary author-
ity 
to 
accept 
nonreimbursable 
detailees from other Federal agencies. 
Congress intended the NCD to be able 
to use details to staff his office. 
The NCD’s authorizing statute gives 
power to the Director to utilize, with 
their consent, the services, personnel, 
and facilities of other Federal agencies, 
even voluntary and uncompensated 
services. But the administration is pre-
venting the NCD from accepting Fed-
eral details while congressional appro-
priations are also pending. 
S. 2382 will help clarify the NCD’s au-
thority to accept Federal details for a 
period not to exceed 3 years, and will 
help this new office properly staff itself 
in the immediate months ahead. 
We recognize the importance of help-
ing this new office stand up its oper-
ations during a time when the Nation 
deals with cyberattacks. I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to yield 5 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Rhode Island (Mr. LAN-
GEVIN). 
Mr. 
LANGEVIN. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of S. 2382. As the author of the Na-
tional Cyber Director Act, I commend 
Senators PORTMAN and PETERS for of-
fering this important legislation to 
clarify the authorities of this new of-
fice. 
I said it before and I will say it again: 
Cybersecurity is the national and eco-
nomic security challenge of the 21st 
century. For 30 years we have been in-
creasing the number of connected de-
vices, processes, and services connected 
to the internet at an exponential rate. 
We can now instantly communicate 
with people half a world away and use 
data repositories to drive advances in 
medicine, clean energy, and commerce. 
With this connectivity comes vulnera-
bility. 
For these three decades, the United 
States has struggled to develop a co-
herent cybersecurity strategy and to 
implement it to better protect the 
country and cyberspace. While we have 
seen the results of this failure in 
breaches ranging from the devastating, 
the tens of billions of dollars in damage 
caused by, for example, NotPetya, to 
the mundane, as companies fend off 
daily cyber probes. 
Just in the last half century we have 
witnessed the Russian Government tar-
get us through ransomware attacks 
through SolarWinds; the Chinese Gov-
ernment break into instances of the 
Microsoft Exchange Server, and crimi-
nals wreak havoc on the Colonial Pipe-
line, JBS, and customers of Kaseya 
through ransomware attacks, so we are 
not where we need to be. 
Congress recognized this fact in 2018 
when it created the Cyberspace Solar-
ium Commission, a distinguished body 
that I had the privilege of being ap-
pointed to by Speaker PELOSI. Through 
a year of deliberation, we developed a 
strategy of layered cyber deterrence, 
and had more than 80 recommendations 
to make that strategy a reality. Those 
recommendations run the gamut from 
changes to our military to regulations 
on private companies. But underlying 
all of them is the recognition that the 
U.S. Government itself is still not or-
ganized for success. 
Now enter the National Cyber Direc-
tor. This key recommendation called 
for a Senate-confirmed leader within 
the Executive Office of the President 
with the policy and budgetary author-
ity to develop a national strategy, 
oversee its implementation, and co-
ordinate response to significant cyber 
incidents. 
With the help of Congressman GALLA-
GHER, the Solarium Commission’s co- 
chair, and through the leadership of 
Chairwoman CAROLYN
MALONEY
and 
her staff, my National Cyber Director 
Act made it into last year’s NDAA. 
Earlier this month, the President had 
appointed and the Senate confirmed 
our inaugural National Cyber Director, 
my fellow Solarium Commission mem-
ber, Chris Inglis, to take office as the 
first Director. 
Chris’ confirmation represents noth-
ing less than a sea change in how the 
government will coordinate cyberspace 
policy. Once this office is fully staffed 
up, there will be a well of expertise 
within the White House to ensure that 
the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure 
Security Agency, the Federal Bureau 
of Investigation, sector risk manage-
ment agencies, the United States Cyber

July 26, 2021 
Command, the intelligence commu-
nity, and all of the other disparate ele-
ments of the government are working 
in concert to improve our cybersecu-
rity. However, the Office of the Na-
tional Cyber Director is very much a 
startup at the moment. 
While we will be voting on a full 
budget for this office later this week, 
including, I hope, an amendment to 
provide the full $25 million yearlong 
appropriation recommended by the So-
larium Commission, we can’t wait 
until the full fiscal year 2022 budget is 
passed to get Director Inglis on his feet 
and up and running. 
After all, our adversaries certainly 
aren’t constrained by our budgetary 
calendar. In drafting the bill, we an-
ticipated that the NCD might need to 
call upon the personnel, facilities, or 
services of Federal departments and 
agencies, with their permission, of 
course. However, there seems to be 
some ambiguity within the White 
House about whether this includes the 
ability of the Office to accept the serv-
ices of nonreimbursable detailees. 
While I think the language and the 
congressional intent of the original 
statute are quite clear, this bill should 
clear up any misunderstanding once 
and for all by explicitly authorizing 
nonreimbursable detailees. This legis-
lation will help Director Inglis get a 
staff vanguard in place and ensure he 
and his successors can take advantage 
of the expertise resident at the various 
agencies that contribute to our success 
in cyberspace. 
Mr. Speaker, let me again thank Sen-
ators PORTMAN and PETERS and Chair-
woman MALONEY for moving so quickly 
to address this urgent issue. Congress 
has already shown tremendous support 
for this Office, and I think the speed at 
which this bill moves is a testament to 
our commitment to its success. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support S. 2382. 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I strong-
ly support this bill and urge my col-
leagues to do the same. I yield back the 
balance of my time.

PRESCRIPTION 
OPIOIDS ACT 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 
957) to direct the Secretary of Veterans 
Affairs to ensure that certain medical 
facilities of the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs have physical locations 
for the disposal of controlled sub-
stances medications. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 957 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in

SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF PERIODS DURING 
WHICH ANY INDIVIDUAL MAY DIS-

Section 3009 of the Johnny Isakson and 
David P. Roe, M.D. Veterans Health Care and 
Benefits Improvement Act of 2020 (Public 
Law 116–315; 38 U.S.C. 8110 note) is amended—

‘‘(b) DESIGNATION OF PERIODS FOR ANY INDI-
VIDUAL TO DISPOSE OF MEDICATION.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary shall des-
ignate periods during which any individual 
may dispose of controlled substances medi-
cations at a covered Department medical fa-
cility. 
‘‘(2) PUBLIC INFORMATION CAMPAIGNS.—The

ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. TAKANO) and the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
insert extraneous material on S. 957. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that we 
are bringing up to the floor Senator 
KENNEDY’s bill, S. 957, the DUMP 
Opioids Act. I also want to commend 
Congresswoman 
MILLER-MEEKS
and 
Congressman TRONE for their work in 
introducing a House companion to this 
legislation. 
We have all seen reports of a dra-
matic increase in accidental and inten-
tional overdose deaths during the pan-
demic, both among veterans and non-
veterans, in our communities. While 
addressing the factors that lead to sub-
stance misuse, we must also act imme-
diately to lower access to controlled 
substances for those in distress. 
I applaud my colleagues for advanc-
ing this legislation as one piece in our 
lethal means safety approach to suicide 
and accidental death prevention. 
The Department of Veterans Affairs 
has been a leader in decreasing pre-
scribing of opioids and in developing 
nonopioid forms of pain management. 
This is vitally important given what 
we know about the health risks that 
even prescription opioids pose for vet-
erans and others in our Nation. 
At the same time, chronic pain is a 
challenging, significant, and ongoing 
concern for many veterans and there 
are times when opioids are appro-
priately prescribed and monitored. We 
need to make sure, however, that peo-
ple have safe ways to dispose of opioid 
medications when they are either no 
longer needed or when they could be 
used unsafely in a home. This bill en-
sures that veterans and members of the 
public may safely dispose of unused 
controlled substances in special reposi-
tories on VA properties on days specifi-
cally designated by VA as public take- 
back days. 
The Secretary of the VA has the au-
thority to set appropriate guidelines 
for safe disposal by members of the 
public. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to 
join me in supporting the DUMP 
Opioids Act, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
b 1715 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of S. 957, the Dispose of Unused Medica-
tions and Prescription Opioids Act, or 
the DUMP Opioids Act. 
Last year, Congress passed legisla-
tion that would allow veterans to dis-
pose of excess prescription medications 
at VA medical facilities. The DUMP 
Opioids Act would allow nonveterans 
to do the same thing. It would also au-
thorize a VA education campaign to 
make veterans and nonveterans alike 
aware of their ability to dispose of left-
over medication at the VA. 
This bill is sponsored in the Senate 
by Senator KENNEDY and in the House 
by Congresswoman MILLER-MEEKS. I 
am grateful to both of them for their 
leadership and advocacy on this impor-
tant issue. 
Earlier this month, CDC released 
data showing that opioid overdose 
deaths surged throughout the pan-
demic. In 2020, more than 93,000 Ameri-
cans died of an overdose. This is an al-
most 30 percent increase from 2019. 
We have to do everything we can to 
help those suffering from substance 
abuse disorder to overcome their addic-
tion. One way we can do this is by 
making 
controlled 
substances 
less 
readily available. By making it easier 
for unused opioids and other prescrip-
tion medication to be disposed of, this 
bill would help do that. 
I hope that every Member will join 
me in supporting the DUMP Opioids 
Act. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3884 
July 26, 2021 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Iowa 
(Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS), my good friend. 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I thank my colleague for yielding me 
time to speak. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in 
support of Senator JOHN
KENNEDY’s 
Dispose of Unused Medications and 
Prescription Opioids Act, S. 957, or the 
DUMP Opioids Act. 
Earlier this year, President Trump 
signed the JOHNNY ISAKSON and DAVID 
P. ROE, M.D. Veterans Health Care and 
Benefits Improvement Act into law. 
Under this law, the VA is required to 
set up prescription drop boxes on VA 
campuses so that veterans can safely 
dispose of unused and excess controlled 
substance 
medications. 
The 
DUMP 
Opioids Act directs the Secretary of 
the VA to designate periods during 
which anyone, not just veterans, may 
dispose of unused medications at VA 
facilities. 
In April, I partnered with Congress-
man DAVID
TRONE
to introduce the 
House companion to Senator KEN-
NEDY’s bill, and I am proud to see this 
bill before the House today. 
As a doctor, I have seen firsthand the 
challenges created by opioid addiction 
and abuse. The opioid epidemic has hit 
every corner of the United States, and 
all of us know someone who has been 
harmed by addiction. 
The DUMP Opioids Act is a simple 
expansion of current law that will give 
more Americans access to safe opioid 
disposal sites. Congress must work in a 
bipartisan manner and give our con-
stituents the tools they need to tackle 
this head-on. 
America has been hit hard by the 
opioid epidemic for years, especially 
over this past year during the pan-
demic, as illustrated by my colleague 
from Illinois. Iowa is no exception. 
With opioid-related deaths up 35 per-
cent in Iowa over the last year, we 
need to be more focused than ever on 
our efforts to both treat and prevent 
addiction. As a physician, I am proud 
to do my part to help combat this cri-
sis. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Senator KEN-
NEDY for his work with this bill, and I 
urge all of my colleagues to support S. 
957, the DUMP Opioids Act. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask all 
of my colleagues to join me in passing 
S. 957, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I encourage 
my colleagues to support this bill as 
well, and I yield back the balance of

tleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST) each

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
insert extraneous material on S. 1910. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of Senator TESTER’s S. 1910, the Major 
Medical Facility Authorization Act of 
2021. I also thank my good friend and a 
valued member of the House Com-
mittee on Veterans’ Affairs, Represent-
ative COLIN
ALLRED, for introducing 
the House companion to this vital and 
important piece of legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, each year, the Depart-
ment of Veterans Affairs submits an 
annual budget request to Congress, and 
then it is our job to authorize and ap-
propriate the funding that VA needs to 
care for America’s veterans and their 
families. Within that larger funding re-
quest is VA’s request for funds to re-
place and modernize its medical facili-
ties. 
This year’s major construction re-
quest totals just over $2 billion and 
will build a much-needed spinal cord 
injury center in Dallas, Texas; erect a 
community living center and renovate 
domiciliary and outpatient facilities in 
Canandaigua, New York; construct an 
outpatient clinic and a national ceme-
tery in Alameda, California; and allow 
for the construction of a new specialty 
care building in American Lake, Wash-
ington, among other things. 
Mr. Speaker, this Congress, our com-
mittee has highlighted VA’s aging in-
frastructure. It might surprise some 
Members to learn the median age of VA 
medical centers is 58 years old. In the 
private sector, it is about 11 years. 
Delivering 21st century healthcare in 
buildings that were built during the 
latter half of the 19th century is far 
from ideal and certainly not what our 
veterans deserve. 
Despite outdated facilities, RAND 
and other academic entities have found 
VA provides better care than private 
options, in most cases. That is right. 
The VA provides better care even 
though it is working from outdated fa-
cilities. Imagine what those findings 
would look like if VA was competing 
with a modern infrastructure. 
During our oversight efforts, the 
committee has learned that in order to 
fully recapitalize the Department’s 
portfolio, VA would need roughly $100 
billion. The Biden administration’s $18 
billion proposal to enhance VA’s phys-
ical infrastructure is a downpayment 
in ensuring veterans have access to the 
most advanced healthcare and most ro-
bust infrastructure that we can pro-
vide. 
My colleagues across the aisle may 
argue that potentially spending $18 bil-
lion on VA’s infrastructure is pre-
mature because it fails to consider ex-
isting reform efforts already underway, 
alluding to the AIR Commission. They 
will argue that we should wait for the 
Commission’s findings. Given the se-
verity of underfunding as it relates to 
VA’s capital assets, we cannot afford to

wait until the AIR Commission pro-
vides recommendations to Congress 
and the White House. 
Life safety and seismic issues across 
the portfolio must be addressed now. 
Regular maintenance should not be de-
layed because of budgetary concerns, 
nor should we delay retrofitting facili-
ties to meet the needs of VA’s fastest 
growing population—women veterans— 
or delay addressing the lessons learned 
from this Nation’s first pandemic in 
more than 100 years. 
If we are going to build back better, 
if we are going to build back trust in 
VA, we have to start making serious 
investments in the outdated infrastruc-
ture meant to serve them, and nearly 
three-fourths of Americans agree. 
Mr. Speaker, that is why I support S. 
1910, and I thank Senator TESTER, the 
chairman of the Senate Committee on 
Veterans’ Affairs, for prioritizing and 
passing this legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of S. 1910, the Major Medical Facility 
Authorization Act of 2021. 
This bill would authorize the VA’s 
major medical facilities construction 
projects 
in 
California, 
Washington, 
New York, and Texas. Those projects 
include outpatient clinics, a specialty 
care building, a spinal cord injury cen-
ter, two community living centers, and 
more. 
These projects are formally requested 
by the VA in the most recent budget 
submission. They would benefit hun-
dreds, if not thousands, of veterans. 
This bill is sponsored by Senator JON 
TESTER, chairman of the Senate Vet-
erans’ Affairs Committee. I thank him 
for introducing it, and I urge my col-
leagues to join me in supporting it 
today. 
The VA healthcare system has a mas-
sive capital assets profile. It is com-
prised of medical facilities that are, on 
average, more than five times older 
than private-sector medical facilities. 
In 2018, Congress passed the Asset 
and Infrastructure Review Act, or the 
AIR Act, to bring the VA healthcare 
system into the 21st century. It would 
lay the foundation to modernize the 
VA medical facilities to better serve 
the veterans. 
I am proud to support this bill to 
help deliver updated medical facilities 
to the veterans in these four States, 
but we have much more to do to deliver 
modern medical care to our veterans 
across this country. 
Mr. Speaker, I hope that we can pass 
this bill today and then continue work-
ing together to ensure the AIR Act 
lives up to the immense promises that 
it has for the veterans. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. ALLRED), 
my good friend and a member of the 
House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, 
where he is an active member of the 
Subcommittee on Health. 
(Mr. ALLRED asked and was given 
permission to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ALLRED. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of my bipartisan bill, 
the fiscal year 2021 Major Medical Fa-
cility Authorization Act. 
As the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq 
come to an end, as a Nation, we are re-
minded of our profound and sacred 
commitment to ensure that each and 
every one of our veterans gets the sup-
port, services, and care they need when 
they return home. 
We owe this commitment to every 
generation 
of 
veterans 
who 
have 
served. I know this from when I visited 
Afghanistan in 2019 as a member of this 
committee. 
Whether it is exposure to toxic air, 
coping with the stress and mental toll 
of their service, or trying to find a 
good job as they transition back to ci-
vilian life, we must do all we can to 
support our veterans who have served 
us so well. 
That is why I was proud to lead this 
bipartisan bill in the House. This bill 
would create jobs by authorizing the 
construction of several major VA med-
ical facilities across the country, in-
cluding a spinal cord injury center in 
Dallas, my hometown and just outside 
of my district. 
The Dallas project, currently under-
way, will construct a 30-bed, long-term 
care spinal cord injury center with the 
capacity to expand to 60 beds. These 
funds will ensure this center has all the 
tools it needs to best serve veterans in 
its care, including a warehouse admin-
istration building, parking garage, and 
central plant improvements. 
In addition to providing long-term 
care for the medical complications of 
spinal cord injuries and disorders, the 
center will provide a residential set-
ting in which highly dependent or 
medically complex veterans could live 
on a long-term basis, receiving the spe-
cialized environment, staff skills, and 
equipment that they require. 
In 2020, I worked with folks in both 
parties to help secure a new VA hos-
pital in Garland, in my district. This 
was a vacant hospital that we were 
able to get donated to the VA system. 
It took months and months of meet-
ings and calls, but we were able to get 
it done. It has now been up and running 
for over a year, and the folks there are 
doing extraordinary work. It proves 
that when we provide the VA with the 
resources it needs, the hardworking 
folks there will go above and beyond to 
serve our veterans. 
The facility is expected to eventually 
create 5,000 jobs and is helping us to 
better serve 174,000 veterans in north 
Texas. 
Mr. Speaker, I am so honored to keep 
building on this work with the passage 
of this bill because, like our veterans’ 
service and sacrifice, our commitment 
to them must be sacred. 
I thank my House cosponsors, Rep-
resentatives 
DEREK
KILMER, 
KIM 
SCHRIER, and MIKE LEVIN. I also thank 
Chairman TAKANO and Ranking Mem-
ber BOST for their leadership on this 
bill. I thank the Senate leads, Senator 
JON TESTER, chairman of the Senate 
Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, and 
Senator JERRY MORAN as well. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this measure. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I encourage 
my colleagues to support this bill, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask all 
my colleagues to join me in passing S. 
1910, the Major Medical Facility Au-
thorization Act of 2021, and I yield 
back the balance of my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3886 
July 26, 2021 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will report the resolution. 
The Clerk read as follows: 
H. RES. 554 
Whereas, on June 30, 2021, the House voted 
to establish a ‘‘Select Committee to Inves-
tigate the January 6th Attack on the United 
States Capitol.’’; 
Whereas, H. Res. 503 states that ‘‘The 
Speaker shall appoint 13 Members to the Se-
lect Committee, 5 of whom shall be ap-
pointed after consultation with the Minority 
Leader.’’; 
Whereas, on June 30, 2021, Speaker Nancy 
Pelosi stated that ‘‘We believe that Congress 
must in the spirit of bipartisanship and pa-
triotism establish this commission.’’; 
Whereas, when asked during a press con-
ference on July 22 about the partisanship of 
the committee, Speaker Pelosi stated that 
‘‘the less partisan it is, the more it will be 
accepted by the American people.’’; 
Whereas, in a statement put out by the 
Speaker’s Office, Speaker Pelosi stated that 
‘‘our imperative must be to find the truth. 
We must do so in a way that retains the 
trust of the American people in the pro-
ceedings, so that they will have confidence 
in the truth that emerges.’’; 
Whereas, for the first known time in the 
history of the House, the Speaker of the 
House rejected two of the Minority Leader’s 
nominees to a Select Committee.; 
Whereas, Speaker Pelosi’s own press re-
lease acknowledged that this was an ‘‘un-
precedented decision.’’; and 
Whereas, Speaker Pelosi’s refusal to seat 
all five Republican Members directly harms 
the legitimacy, credibility, and integrity of 
the proceedings of the Select Committee: : 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives— 
(1) condemns the refusal of Speaker Nancy 
Pelosi to seat all five Republican Members 
to the Select Committee; and 
(2) urges the Speaker to make the fol-
lowing appointments to the Select Com-
mittee: Representative Jim Banks of Indi-
ana, Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, 
Representative Rodney Davis of Illinois, 
Representative Kelly Armstrong of North 
Dakota, and Representative Troy Nehls of 
Texas. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The res-
olution qualifies. 
MOTION TO TABLE 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I have 
a motion at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will report the motion. 
The Clerk read as follows: 
Mr. Hoyer moves that the resolution be 
laid on the table. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion to table. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays.

ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered.

PERMISSION FOR MEMBER TO BE 
CONSIDERED AS PRIMARY SPON-
SOR OF H.R. 1744 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that I may here-
after be considered to be the primary 
sponsor of H.R. 1744, a bill originally 
introduced by Representative HASTINGS 
of Florida, for the purpose of adding co-
sponsors and requesting reprintings 
pursuant to clause 7 of rule XII. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
BOURDEAUX). Is there objection to the 
request of the gentleman from New 
Hampshire? 
There was no objection. 
f 
CELEBRATING 31ST ANNIVERSARY 
OF ADA 
(Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, 
this morning, I had the privilege of 
joining President Biden at the White 
House to celebrate the 31st anniversary 
of the Americans with Disabilities Act. 
This landmark civil rights law has 
drastically improved the lives of people 
with disabilities across our Nation, in-
cluding mine. 
In 1980, an accidental gunshot left me 
paralyzed, and for 10 years, I experi-
enced firsthand the adversity that the 
disability community faced before the 
ADA. 
Since its enactment, this law has 
helped break down barriers and stamp 
out discrimination. It has opened doors 
to new opportunities for people with 
disabilities and allowed members of 
our community to reach previously un-
attainable places in society. 
In fact, I can say with confidence 
that without the ADA, I would not be 
a Member of Congress proudly rep-
resenting the people of Rhode Island. 
Madam Speaker, though we have 
made tremendous progress with the 
ADA, we can’t stop fighting yet. I will 
continue working closely with advo-
cates and lawmakers like my dear 
friend, our Majority Leader, STENY 
HOYER, to advance meaningful legisla-
tion to support and protect the rights 
of people with disabilities. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF BRIAN 
SCHLIFKE 
(Mr. BARR asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of a great 
American and my dear friend, Brian 
Schlifke, of Lexington, Kentucky. 
Brian served in the United States 
Army Signal Corps during the Vietnam 
war, answering our Nation’s call with 
valor through two tours. He was a spe-
cialist in communications and earned 
the Bronze Star and Combat Medal. He 
once said that he was ‘‘no hero, just 
proud to have been of service to my fel-
low soldiers.’’ 
He continued that spirit of service 
throughout his life, working diligently 
on behalf of other veterans. He was as-
sociated with the Vietnam Veterans of 
America and Kentucky’s Sixth District 
Veterans Coalition. 
Brian was a tireless advocate for his 
fellow veterans and worked in a posi-
tive way to bring about necessary leg-
islative changes. He had a great spirit 
and a contagious smile, and his love for 
his country was unwavering. 
Our Nation lost a true patriot when 
Brian passed away on June 20, 2021. 
Brian is survived by his wife, Anne, and 
many other family members. 
It is my distinct honor, on behalf of 
a grateful Nation, to remember, recog-
nize, and pay tribute to the exemplary 
life of Brian Schlifke. 
f 
REMEMBERING DAVID CASTRO 
(Mrs. FLETCHER asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Mrs. FLETCHER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today with a heavy heart to honor 
the life of one of my constituents, 
David Castro. 
Born and raised in Houston over the 
last 17 years, David was tragically 
killed in a road rage incident on his 
way home from an Astros game just 
earlier this month. 
He had a bright future ahead of him. 
A National Merit Scholar semifinalist, 
he excelled in math and physics. He 
was a percussionist in the Westside 
High School marching band. 
Today, as I extend my deep condo-
lences to David’s family and friends for 
their loss, I rise to share their wish 
that our community and our country 
remember David through random acts 
of kindness. What a beautiful way to 
memorialize him. 
David Castro will be missed but never 
forgotten and will live on in acts of 
kindness across this country.

Speaker, I rise today to remember and 
honor the life of Colonel Edward Wex-
ler, of Savannah, Georgia, who passed 
away on June 30 at the age of 75. 
Colonel Wexler was a Savannah na-
tive who lived a truly remarkable life. 
After graduating from The Citadel, he 
was commissioned as a second lieuten-
ant in the United States Air Force. 
Colonel Wexler traveled the world with 
the United States Air Force, serving in 
many different countries. He retired 
from the Air National Guard in 2006, 
having over 35 years of service. 
Following retirement, Colonel Wex-
ler continued to serve his community. 
He became director of the Combined 
Federal Campaign for Coastal Georgia, 
president of the Savannah Military Of-
ficers Association, and junior vice com-
mander of the Veterans Council of 
Chatham County. 
Colonel Wexler’s dedication to im-
proving the lives of others will never be 
forgotten. My thoughts and prayers are 
with Colonel Wexler’s family, friends, 
and all who knew him during this most 
difficult time.

RESTORING COMMUNITIES LEFT 
BEHIND 
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise 
this evening to thank Chairwoman 
MAXINE WATERS for including the Re-
storing Communities Left Behind Act 
in her Housing is Infrastructure bill. 
This legislation, led by Congress-
woman RASHIDA
TLAIB
and myself, 
would direct $5 billion toward pro-
grams for homeowner rehabilitation 
assistance, weatherization, improved 
accessibility for seniors and people 
with disabilities, refinancing, and prop-
erty tax relief. 
It will restore quality housing in the 
cities I represent, such as Toledo, Lo-
rain, Sandusky, and Cleveland, which 
have suffered from decades of job 
losses, recessions, the foreclosure crisis 
of 2008, and chronic housing under-
investment. 
Congress must serve as a partner to 
our on-the-ground organizations and 
local leaders who know what resources 
are needed where and how best to de-
ploy them to revive their neighbor-
hoods. 
These investments will repair homes, 
stimulate economic growth, and revi-
talize communities. I urge all of my 
colleagues to support its passage, and I 
send my thanks to all who have helped 
us along this really vital road. 
RETURN OF DEBT CEILING 
(Mr. BURCHETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, 
the return of the debt ceiling on July 
31 should flash fiscal warning signs for 
every elected official in Congress. 
The debt ceiling was suspended for 2 
years back in 2019. Since then, Con-
gress has kept up its reckless spending 
habits like a teenage shopaholic at the 
mall with a credit card. 
Now, government debt is over 100 per-
cent of our domestic product—100 per-
cent, Madam Speaker. 
We clearly ignored the spending prob-
lems that got us into this mess in the 
first place. There needs to be a limit on 
how much debt elected officials can put 
on the taxpayers’ shoulders. 
My legislation, the Reforming Amer-
ica’s Fiscal Toolkit Act, would amend 
Congress’ budget process to keep gov-
ernment debt lower than our gross do-
mestic product. This would limit how 
much financial trouble Congress can 
get the country into. 
You know what they say, Madam 
Speaker: The first step to solving a 
problem is recognizing you have a 
problem, and dadgummit, Congress has 
a problem. 
Congress needs to put a spending 
check on itself, or our country is going 
to end up like that out-of-control teen-
age shopaholic: bad credit, high inter-
est rates, broke, and living in their 
parents’ basement.

200 DAYS OF DELIVERING FOR THE 
PEOPLE 
(Mr. AUCHINCLOSS asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. AUCHINCLOSS. Madam Speaker, 
last week, we celebrated the 200th day 
of the 117th Congress and 200 days of 
getting shots in arms, students in 
classrooms, money in pockets, and 
Americans back to work. 
Thanks to House Democrats and 
President Biden, we passed the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan, delivering funding 
and relief to the Commonwealth and to 
Americans across the country. 
In Massachusetts, nearly 74 percent 
of adults are fully vaccinated, allowing 
them to reunite with friends and loved 
ones, and we have sent over 500,000 
stimulus checks to Bay Staters. 
When I came to Congress, I promised 
our students and families that they 
would return to in-person learning. The 
American Rescue Plan delivered on my 
pledge, 
providing 
Massachusetts 
schools with $1.8 billion in Federal re-
lief to support their students and staff 
as they re-entered the classroom. 
We lifted up our care economy, secur-
ing over $1 billion to reduce the cost of 
childcare and pay our care workers a 
fair wage. 
As a parent, I worked hard to provide 
our working families with the historic 
tax relief that they deserve. The child 
tax credit we passed will cut child pov-
erty in half and help nearly 60 percent 
of children in my district, from Brook-
line to Fall River. 
We passed the INVEST Act, a trans-
formational bill that will reimagine 
transportation while delivering clean 
energy and spurring job creation. Now, 
the Senate has the legislative frame-
work it needs to make our infrastruc-
ture plan a reality. 
From the depths of the crisis, House 
Democrats delivered needed recovery 
for Americans in just 200 days.

REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 18, NO 
TAXPAYER FUNDING FOR ABOR-
TION ACT 
(Mr. BILIRAKIS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, in 
Pasco County, one of the counties in 
my district, we have seen a huge spike 
in overdoses, including 25 fatalities in 
the month of June alone. Very, very 
sad. 
During January through June 2021, 
we have seen more overdoses than any 
other similar period on record. 
Fentanyl continues to be a signifi-
cant factor. We must do everything we 
can to prevent fentanyl from flooding 
our streets, including stopping the free 
flow at our Nation’s southern border. 
I have been to the border, Madam 
Speaker, and I have seen how easy it is 
to move drugs into our country. We 
must secure our border. 
Additionally, we must implement 
commonsense safeguards to prevent 
opioid abuse and improve access to 
quality treatment options. I will con-
tinue to work on these priorities. 
Separately, Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Commit-
tees on Energy and Commerce, Ways 
and Means, and the Judiciary be dis-
charged from further consideration of 
H.R. 18, and ask for its immediate con-
sideration in the House. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
guidelines consistently issued by suc-
cessive Speakers, as recorded in sec-
tion 956 of the House Rules and Man-
ual, the Chair is constrained not to en-
tertain the request unless it has been 
cleared by the bipartisan floor and 
committee leaderships.

firsthand how with the right tools and 
accessibility, disabled Americans can 
live a life of independence, economic 
self-sufficiency, and pride. 
The Americans with Disabilities Act 
is a monumental piece of legislation, 
opening the doors of opportunity to the 
millions of Americans who have a dis-
ability, whether it be physical, learn-
ing, cognitive, or any other. 
Whether it is protection from dis-
crimination in the workplace, addi-
tional support in school, or added ac-
commodations in our public venues, 
the ADA provides the support to better 
empower those individuals living with 
disabilities. 
Madam Speaker, while we saw this 
landmark legislation signed into law 31 
years ago today, we must continue to 
advocate for the rights of Americans 
who are living with disabilities. The 
ADA is an incredible milestone for 
Americans living with disabilities, but 
there is still more work to be done. We 
can all continue to do more for those 
living with disabilities, from defying 
prejudice to empowering those with 
disabilities in everyday lives.

REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 18, NO 
TAXPAYER FUNDING FOR ABOR-
TION ACT 
(Mr. BABIN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the Hyde amend-
ment. For more than 40 years, Hyde en-
joyed strong bipartisan support, with 
both Republicans and Democrats agree-
ing that Americans should never be 
forced to fund abortions with their 
hard-earned tax dollars. 
However, President Biden and my 
Democrat colleagues have now decided 
to abolish this crucial protection. By 
eliminating the Hyde amendment from 
their budget, they have disregarded the 
conscience rights of all Americans and 
blatantly attacked the lives of the un-
born. 
As the father of five children and the 
grandfather of 17, I know just how pre-
cious life is, and I will never stop fight-
ing to protect the Hyde amendment. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Committees on En-
ergy and Commerce, Ways and Means, 
and the Judiciary be discharged from 
further consideration of H.R. 18, and I 
ask for its immediate consideration in 
the House. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. As the 
Chair previously advised, that request 
cannot be entertained absent appro-
priate clearance.

CRISIS AT THE SOUTHERN 
BORDER 
(Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, 
two weeks ago, I spent additional time 
at the U.S. border, which I think, by a 
mile, is the biggest crisis this country 
has. 
It has recently been brought to my 
attention that the Rio Grande Valley 
sector, where I was at, recently had 
20,000 people a week processed. They 
had never seen such a thing. 
What difference does this make? The 
more people come across, first of all, it 
probably means more illegal drugs 
crossing the border, which means more 
fentanyl, which is the reason why we 
have 90,000 deaths a year in this coun-
try. Since they’re processing more peo-
ple, it means less Border Patrol agents 
to guard the more rural areas of the 
border, which means more people com-
ing across. 
Finally, we are in a situation, we 
found out, down there, when they turn 
people over with COVID to the non-
governmental entities, those entities 
do not have secure facilities, and it 
means people are flowing into this 
country who we already know have 
COVID. 
Please, during this appropriations 
season, please add more money to our 
Border Patrol so we can get a handle 
on these ridiculously high numbers.

REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 18, NO 
TAXPAYER FUNDING FOR ABOR-
TION ACT 
(Mr. C. SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. C. SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida. 
Madam Speaker, for more than 40 
years, the Hyde amendment has pre-
vented taxpayers from funding abor-
tions through government programs. 
Historically, it has been included in an-
nual spending bills by both parties. But 
recently, Democrats voted to eliminate 
Hyde amendment protections. Even 
President 
Biden 
previously 
said: 
‘‘Those of us who are opposed to abor-
tion should not be compelled to pay for 
them,’’ but it would appear he and his 
Democrat colleagues have abandoned 
this critical position. 
With nearly 60 percent of Americans 
agreeing that taxpayer dollars should 
not be used to fund abortion, we must 
stand for life. Accordingly, I support 
H.R. 18, the No Taxpayer Funding for 
Abortion Act. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Committees on En-
ergy and Commerce, Ways and Means, 
and the Judiciary be discharged from 
further consideration of H.R. 18, and I 
ask for its immediate consideration in 
the House. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. As the 
Chair previously advised, that request 
cannot be entertained absent appro-

REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 18, NO 
TAXPAYER FUNDING FOR ABOR-
TION ACT 
(Mr. WESTERMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today in support of H.R. 18, the 
No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and 
Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act 
of 2021. 
Earlier this month, President Biden 
released his budget, which does not in-
clude the Hyde amendment, an amend-
ment that prohibits Federal taxpayer 
dollars from funding abortions through 
Medicaid. Hyde has been included in 
every appropriations package since 1976 
and is a longstanding, bipartisan com-
mon ground bill between Republicans 
and Democrats to protect the con-
science of taxpayers. 
President Biden has consistently ex-
pressed support for the Hyde amend-
ment throughout his career, and I am 
disappointed that his recent shift sig-
nals to the American people that he 
will cave to the political pressures of 
his left wing and force our tax dollars 
to pay for the eugenics of our Nation’s 
poorest individuals who are on Med-
icaid. We cannot stand for this and 
must codify Hyde’s restrictions on tax-
payer-funded abortions. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Committees on En-
ergy and Commerce, Ways and Means, 
and the Judiciary be discharged from 
further consideration of H.R. 18, and I 
ask for its immediate consideration in 
the House. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. As the 
Chair has previously advised, that re-
quest cannot be entertained absent ap-
propriate clearance.

REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 18, NO 
TAXPAYER FUNDING FOR ABOR-

(Mr. MANN asked and was given per-

minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. MANN. Madam Speaker, I stand 
today to voice my support for H.R. 18, 
the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion 
Act, which would protect the American 
people from a gross misuse of taxpayer 
dollars. 
I cosponsored H.R. 18 during my first 
few days in Congress, because I, along 
with the majority of American voters, 
believe that no person should be re-
quired to pay for abortions or abortion 
services. 
President 
Biden 
himself 
pledged never to force taxpayers to pay 
for abortions, and yet he has broken 
that promise by failing to include the 
Hyde amendment in his new budget 
proposal. 
Devaluing the life of unborn children 
has desensitized America. We should 
never use taxpayer dollars to fund 
abortion services. Instead, we should 
focus on lifesaving resources that focus 
on both the mother and the child. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Committees on En-
ergy and Commerce, Ways and Means, 
and the Judiciary be discharged from

REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 18, NO 
TAXPAYER FUNDING FOR ABOR-
TION ACT 
(Mr. HUDSON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, as a 
father, I believe that every life has 
value, and I am proud to be pro-life. 
But whether you are pro-life or not, 
my fellow North Carolinians and Amer-
icans all across the country agree that 
government should not use taxpayer 
dollars to fund abortions. 
That is why the Hyde amendment 
was created. 
The Hyde amendment has saved 2.5 
million lives and protected the con-
science rights of Americans, all with 
overwhelmingly bipartisan support. 
In fact, Hyde has been renewed every 
year since 1976, under majorities and 
Presidents of both parties, including 
President Barack Obama. 
However, in his most recent budget 
proposal, President Joe Biden chose to 
ignore precedent and the will of the 
people by excluding Hyde amendment 
protections. 
This is a radical shift in policy. 
Americans should not be forced to 
violate their conscience to pay for 
abortions. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Committees on En-
ergy and Commerce, Ways and Means, 
and the Judiciary be discharged from 
further consideration of H.R. 18, the No 
Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act,

THE U.S.-MEXICO BORDER IS 
UNPROTECTED 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, we 
have a record-setting surge of illegal 
drugs coming in across our southern 
border, including the very, very deadly 
fentanyl, 
which 
takes 
only 
small 
amounts to greatly affect many people, 
as well as whatever other activities the 
cartels want to do. 
The U.S.-Mexico border is basically 
unprotected, and it doesn’t seem to be 
a priority of the Biden administration 
at all. Please, prove me wrong. 
Yet, the Biden administration is 
happy to, once again, push the idea of 
perhaps shutting down the country 
over COVID again. Is it because of the 
delta variant, or now is it going to be 
over a new Mexico variant? But it 
seems to be coming our way. 
Yet, they will not control the border 
and the flow of illegal immigrants that 
might be carrying COVID themselves, 
whether it is through the new Mexico 
variant or not. 
So you have to ask, whose side is this 
administration on with this open sieve 
of 
a 
border, 
these 
drugs 
coming 
through, illegal immigrants coming 
through, and then putting the clamps 
down on our own economy and our own 
people?

FIGHTING FOR THE RIGHT TO 
VOTE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) is recognized 
for 60 minutes as the designee of the 
majority leader. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I am here to anchor this Special Order 
on the fierce urgency of preserving the 
precious right to vote by passing H.R. 
4, the John Lewis Voting Rights Ad-
vancement Act, and legislation like 
H.R. 1, For The People. 
I am delighted to be co-anchoring 
this Congressional Black Caucus Spe-
cial Order at the request of our tireless 
leader 
for 
justice, 
Congresswoman 
JOYCE BEATTY of Ohio, and to be joined 
by my co-anchor, Congressman RITCHIE 
TORRES of New York, and many other 
members of the Congressional Black 
Caucus. 
Fifty-six years ago, in a century that 
was close to a hundred years after the 
Emancipation Proclamation and the 
rendition of the 15th Amendment, the 
very right to vote, there we were fight-
ing with this beloved Member of Con-
gress, who challenged us to get into 
good trouble, fighting in 1965, pursuant 
to the collapse of the understanding of 
the 15th Amendment, fighting for the 
right to vote again. 
Madam Speaker, here we are today, 
2021, now 56 years after the 1965 Voting 
Rights Act, fighting for the right to 
vote. 
I want to make sure that I pay trib-
ute to Our Power, Our Message, led by 
the Honorable JOYCE BEATTY, who does 
not only speak her words, but she acts 
on her words, how proud we were. But 
I am sure pride is not what she wants 
us to feel as she walked down this dif-
ficult road here in Washington, D.C., to 
be able to express, with Black women 
and others, that we have a fierce sense 
of urgency, and was arrested, just 
about two weeks ago, in the name of 
voting rights. 
So let me, for a moment, read to you 
out of the book that has just been pub-
lished by a dear, beloved friend, ‘‘Carry 
On.’’ I use this book in the Rules Com-
mittee, when there seems to have been 
a challenge to helping the impover-
ished. I concluded my remarks, when I 
was giving amendments, to help the 
impoverished to carry on. 
But on the issue of justice, these are 
his words: ‘‘We must practice what we 
preach. If we believe in life and liberty, 
then we should not defer the dream of 
equality and justice’’—the right to 
vote—‘‘under the law for people of 
color. We must use the system of gov-
ernment to improve our laws and to 
make our society fairer and more just. 
While no one bill can right the many 
wrongs, we can stitch together partial 
solutions to deal with the complex so-
cietal issues that lead to systemic bias 
and inequality.’’ 
That is why we stand here today. We 
are stitching together a response to the 
collapse of voting rights in America. 
We are stitching together laws that 
will deal with the mass of suppression 
laws being passed in State legislatures 
across America. We are stitching to-
gether a response for those brave Texas 
Democratic representatives who are 
here in Washington, D.C., who are beg-
ging us to pass H.R. 1 and S. 1 and of 
course we have passed H.R. 1 and the 
John Lewis Voting Rights Advance-
ment Act. 
b 2015 
Let me just briefly say that serious 
damage to the precious right to vote 
occasioned by the rightwing conserv-
ative majority on the Supreme Court 
demands that the Congress exercise its 
powers under section 5 of the 15th 
Amendment to restore the extraor-
dinary reach and effectiveness of sec-
tion 2 and section 5 of the Voting 
Rights Act. The 15th Amendment said 
that no law, no State legislature 
should abridge the right to vote on the 
basis of discrimination of race and 
color and ethnicity and that the Con-
gress should stand up and provide the 
relief and the answer. 
Did you hear, Madam Speaker? The 
Congress. And the Congressional Black 
Caucus has said that, not only with 
their words but with their bodies. HANK 
JOHNSON was just arrested last week, 
Congressman HANK JOHNSON. 
So the objection to the VRA and 
their opponents is without substance. I 
have long said that the States that 
were subject to preclearance under the 
Voting Rights Act earned their way 
into so doing by discriminatory laws. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
June 
25, 
2021, 
marked the eighth anniversary of the 
Supreme Court’s infamous decision in 
Shelby County v. Holder, which immo-
bilized the Department of Justice from 
subjecting discriminatory voting and 
election laws to the preclearance. 
On August 6 will be the commemora-
tion of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. 56 
years. And look at the predicament we 
are in. 
Later on in this debate I will recount 
all the times we voted for the Voting 
Rights Act. Madam Speaker, it was bi-
partisan. It was across racial lines, re-
gional lines, because we knew it was 
the right thing to do. 
So tonight we stand on what is right. 
We stand on good trouble. We stand on 
making the decision that not the

Shelby case, not the Arizona case. The 
Arizona case is Brnovich v. DNC that 
dashes section 2, and frankly says, by 
one of the justices, that a little bit of 
discrimination is okay. Not on the 
watch of the Congressional Black Cau-
cus and all of my colleagues, because 
voting rights belongs to every single 
person in this Congress and to their 
constituents. 
Why would they want to deny the im-
plementation and the substance of the 
Constitution and the 15th Amendment? 
So here we are tonight to be able to 
explain to the American public and our 
colleagues that we cannot wait any 
longer for H.R. 4 or H.R. 1, S. 1, S. 4, 
and we are here tonight to tell our 
story. 
It is my pleasure and certainly my 
privilege, as we continue to tell our 
story, and as I continue to weave in 
that story, to yield to the gentle-
woman from Ohio (Ms. BEATTY), who, 
again, has spoken with her actions, not 
just her words, the Chair of the Con-
gressional Black Caucus, senior mem-
ber and chairwoman on the Financial 
Services Committee, and, again, some-
one who showed the Nation that it is 
both our message and our power by 
being arrested in the name of the fight 
for equality, getting into a little good 
trouble. 
I am sure John Lewis, rest in power, 
is looking down on us. 
Mrs. BEATTY. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Congresswoman SHEILA JACKSON 
LEE, who is coanchor with Congress-
man RITCHIE TORRES. 
Let me say this: Congresswoman 
JACKSON LEE is at the right place in 
the right time in history. I thank her 
for her leadership and her powerful, 
profound words of talking about not 
only our late Congressman John Lewis, 
but talking about why we are here to-
night, speaking truth to power, from 
her own experiences, from her own 
leadership, from those marches that I 
have read about and witnessed her in, 
leading 
not 
only 
individuals 
from 
Texas but across this Nation. So I 
thank her and look forward to hearing 
her talk about voting rights under at-
tack. 
Lastly, let me thank her for quoting 
from his latest book, ‘‘Carry On.’’ Just 
as it was fitting for her, as a powerful 
attorney, to talk about justice, in that 
book he talks about voting rights, and 
in that book he kept it quite simple. In 
capital letters, he said: Vote, vote, 
vote. And stand up for the right of vot-
ing, because voting rights belong to all 
of us and all of our constituents. 
Madam Speaker, let me say tonight, 
I rise and join my colleagues of the 
Congressional Black Caucus for this 
Special Order hour on a critically im-
portant topic, voting rights. 
The Congressional Black Caucus Spe-
cial Order hour is generally regarded as 
a solemn moment to give the CBC an 
opportunity to speak directly to the 
American people and to reflect on the 
ideas and policies of critical interest to 
our constituents. 
Well, tonight I speak to the people 
about the right to vote. We are gath-
ered in this sacred Chamber, the floor 
of the people’s House, to discuss the fu-
ture of voting rights in America, to 
amplify our power, our message, and to 
boldly proclaim that we are not going 
to let the clock be turned back to a 
time when the votes of Black people 
were restricted and limited by those 
who feared our power. 
On behalf of the 57 members of the 
Congressional Black Caucus, I come 
today to share some thoughts and join 
my colleagues on this debate on voting 
rights. 
The right to vote is under attack, 
and some of those attacks have taken 
place right here in this Chamber, and 
in other States across the Nation. 
So, Madam Speaker, let me be clear 
to the American people: The Congres-
sional Black Caucus will not sit idly by 
as State legislatures, fueled by the sup-
port of adversaries intent on limiting 
our access to the ballot box, voter sup-
pression, changing the rules of engage-
ment after we have been victorious. We 
have the majority in the House, the 
Senate, and we are building back bet-
ter with the Biden-Harris administra-
tion. To all of those who believe it does 
not exist, I have a message for you: We 
won. We stand for the people, because 
we were elected by the people. 
The civil disobedience displayed by 
the proud Black women and activists, 
allies, and others just over a week and 
a half ago that our coanchor talked 
about, we were there for a reason, orga-
nized by good friend and colleague 
Melanie Campbell, Clayola Brown, Bar-
bara Skinner, the Reverend Barbara 
Skinner, and so many other women. 
Well, yes, I was proud to stand with 
them. 
On that day I did reflect back on how 
many of my CBC colleagues had been 
arrested and what they fought for that 
gave me the privilege to stand on this 
floor tonight. Did I think about John 
Lewis and did I think about Fannie 
Lou Hamer and so many more? Yes. 
Did I think about Rosa Parks and what 
she did to give us the Montgomery 
March of 1955 when she sat down that 
gave us 1964 civil rights, 1965 voting 
rights, 1968 jobs and housing act, and so 
much more? 
Well, tonight, that is what we are 
standing here for. We understand, 
Madam Speaker, that you can’t change 
the future if you don’t acknowledge the 
past. And that is why you will hear us 
repeatedly talk about the legal cases. 
You will hear us talking about our rich 
history. And as much as we embrace it 
and we love it, we are not going back 
to it. And that is why we are standing 
here. 
Madam Speaker, I stand with Con-
gresswoman SHEILA JACKSON LEE and 
coanchor RITCHIE TORRES. Let me just 
say tonight, we send a strong message 
that we are here to pass H.R. 1 and 
H.R. 4, the For the People Act and the 
John Lewis Voting Rights Act. We are 
done waiting. We are done being pa-
tient. 
If it means we have to speak out, if it 
means we have to stand up and march 
and protest, then that is what we will 
do. The example set by Democrats 
across the United States, and specifi-
cally those members who came here 
from Texas, we stand with them, be-
cause they were forced to come here. 
Are they making a bold statement? 
Yes. 
But think about it. It has only taken 
one action, one person to get the atten-
tion of the Nation to change things and 
make it right. And that is what we are 
doing. When people ask why, why do we 
stand here and stand up for freedom 
and justice and our equal rights and to 
protect our voting rights? Because we 
know if we don’t stand up for our-
selves, what will our future be like? 
What will the future of our children, 
our grandchildren, and those yet un-
born be like? Well, we want to stand up 
today for H.R. 1, for H.R. 4, so we leave 
them with a better future. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Congress-
woman SHEILA JACKSON LEE for giving 
me the opportunity to speak tonight. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the Chairwoman of the Con-
gressional Black Caucus for her power-
ful words. And, yes, thank her for ac-
knowledging the women who stood in 
the gap, including Melanie Campbell 
and Reverend Barbara Williams Skin-
ner and Clayola Brown, and Tamika, 
who has been at the forefront as well, 
and many, many others that have, 
likewise, been at the forefront. We are 
pleased to be able to join in their lead-
ership as well. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
let me ask unanimous consent that all 
Members have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks on the subject of this Special 
Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Texas? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I yield to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. TORRES), a gentleman who 
now walks in history, who knows his 
history, and who is prepared to fight 
against that history that should never 
be repeated, my coanchor, who has elo-
quently articulated what was in Gen-
eral Granger’s Order No. 3, and that is 
the equality of rights. 
Mr. TORRES of New York. Madam 
Speaker, it is always a pleasure to be 
here 
with 
Congresswoman 
JACKSON 
LEE. 
The culprit is not only the Repub-
lican Party, but it is also the Supreme 
Court. The rightwing majority on the 
Supreme Court gave the Voting Rights 
Act the narrowest possible meaning in 
order to render it powerless against 
21st century voter suppression. 
Congress deliberately wrote the Vot-
ing Rights Act broadly so as to protect 
against both obvious and insidious 
forms of voter disenfranchisement. The 
broad language of the Voting Rights

Act prohibits not only the denial, but 
also the abridgement of voting rights. 
It prohibits not only discriminatory in-
tent, but also racially disparate im-
pact. It requires that all methods of 
voting be equally open to communities 
of color, and that communities of color 
have an equal opportunity to cast their 
ballots. 
And so anything that undermines 
equal openness and equal opportunity 
is a violation of the Voting Rights Act 
properly interpreted. I would submit to 
you that voter suppression in America 
has no greater ally than rightwing ju-
dicial activism. 
b 2030 
Instead of interpreting the Voting 
Rights Act as written, the rightwing 
majority on the Supreme Court has 
chosen to rewrite the statute out of ex-
istence. The enforcement mechanisms 
of the Voting Rights Act have been all 
but eviscerated. There was section 5, 
which provided for preclearance, which 
enabled the executive branch to pro-
tect voting rights. Then there was sec-
tion 2, which provided for litigation, 
which enabled the courts to protect 
voting rights. 
Both of those enforcement mecha-
nisms had been gutted at the hands of 
the Supreme Court, the former in 
Shelby County v. Holder and the latter 
in Brnovich v. DNC. 
We 
know 
from 
history, 
Madam 
Speaker, that the most effective tool 
for preventing voter suppression is 
preclearance. 
According 
to 
Justice 
Kagan, from 1965 to 2006, the Federal 
Government harnessed the power of 
section 5, the power of preclearance, to 
prevent 1,200 voting restrictions from 
taking effect. 
We should see the desecration of both 
section 5 and section 2 as a call to ac-
tion, as a call for the United States 
Congress to pass the John Lewis Vot-
ing Rights Act, which would restore 
our preclearance not only for select ju-
risdictions but for every State and lo-
cality across the Nation. 
Let it be known that the greatest ob-
stacle on the path to 21st century vot-
ing rights enforcement is the filibuster. 
The filibuster perpetuates a status quo 
that disenfranchises communities of 
color. If you are a defender of the fili-
buster, then you should dispense with 
the pretense that you are a champion 
of voting rights. If you are a defender 
of the filibuster, you are not part of 
the solution, but you are part of the 
problem. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the distinguished gentleman 
from New York for opening the path-
way. We may have him continue to ex-
plore that journey, which I will take 
up, and that is the question of the fili-
buster. Someone described it as busting 
things up and busting good things up. 
We know that there has to be a solu-
tion to those who have argued that, in 
fact, they are about the institution of 
the other body; they are about the in-
tegrity of the other body. I would 
argue that where blood has been shed 
so that people have died so that people 
might vote, it is not the integrity of 
the institution. It is the life and death 
of voting rights, not only for people of 
color, but for this Nation. 
A man who has argued eloquently 
about the filibuster and a resolve of 
our next steps, but also recognizes his-
torically, not only the civil rights jour-
ney but the fundamental right of vot-
ing that should not be hindered or un-
dermined is our majority whip, and we 
are very grateful for his leadership and 
his historical perspective and his cur-
rent understanding of how we have to 
get the job done. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from South Carolina (Mr. CLY-
BURN). 
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding to 
me and thank her so much for bringing 
this issue before the American people. 
For several weeks now, we have all 
heard discussions about various aspects 
of H.R. 1 and H.R. 4. Now, H.R. 4, as all 
of us know, has not yet passed the Con-
gress and is now before the Senate. 
But I wanted to bring two issues to 
the forefront here this evening. The 
first one has to do with the so-called 
preclearance that we just heard a dis-
cussion on. I am serving in the Con-
gress today in large part because of the 
preclearance in the Voting Rights Act 
of 1965. 
But preclearance came into being be-
cause of some targeted legislation, leg-
islation targeted toward those States 
that had a history of discriminating. 
Therefore, because all the States did 
not have that kind of a history, we had 
to go out and develop a record to show 
that this is the reason these particular 
States are being targeted. All or parts 
of seven States were initially covered 
and, of course, we all know what hap-
pened in Shelby County v. Holder. 
The 1965 Voting Rights Act was vir-
tually gutted because the formula of 
section 4 is no longer operative. There-
fore, section 5 has really been neutral-
ized, which is the preclearance. 
Here is something I want to bring to 
the attention of the American people, 
and that is this: If you were to only 
pass preclearance as it relates to a his-
tory of discrimination, we will miss 
what is happening in the country 
today. Pennsylvania was not one of 
those States. Yet, we see massive dis-
crimination in voting being advocated 
throughout Pennsylvania. The same 
thing is going on up in Michigan. 
Now, according to the studies I have 
read, 48 States have now put into place 
or proposed—I think 28 of them have 
put into place—restrictive voting laws. 
Under the standard of the 1965 Voting 
Rights Act, these States would not be 
covered. Therefore, it is time for every-
body to turn their attention to what 
we need to do about preclearance. 
I submit that preclearance needs to 
be applied universally to all 50 States, 
because if you pass preclearance, zero-
ing in on seven, eight, nine States, and 
then another State pops up with a new 
restrictive law, that State would not 
be covered under preclearance, and I 
think it is time for us to take a look at 
that as well. 
Madam Speaker, I call upon my 
friends in the Senate to not wait 
around for us to develop this record, 
though I think it is pretty much in 
place, look at applying preclearance to 
all 50 States. 
The second thing I think that we are 
needing to begin to think about that is 
not being discussed is this little thing 
called nullification; states enacting 
nullification laws. If you look at the 
Georgia law that they passed, it is very 
suppressive. It restricts. The thing that 
is insulting to me is that little part in 
there that allows an established com-
mission to overturn the results of an 
election, to nullify the results of an 
election. None of us are using that 
word today, but that word is very 
prominent when you look at what 
States are doing. 
That violates not just laws as passed 
by this Congress, that violates the Con-
stitution. The Constitution is very 
clear. Article I, Section 4 tells us that 
no State can pass final judgment on 
federal elections. No State. The best 
argument for that is sitting right there 
in The Federalist Papers No. 59. It 
talks about it and lays out examples as 
to why the Federal Government cannot 
allow States to determine the election. 
That is why the Supreme Court made 
it very clear that States could not put 
term limits on Members of Congress 
because that is not their purview. 
When you see nullification laws com-
ing forward, I think it is incumbent 
upon this Congress to step in and do 
what is necessary to exert the Con-
stitution of the United States. That is 
what is at threat here today. That is 
why I have argued irrespective of what 
you may feel about filibusters. 
Filibusters ought not be applied to 
anybody’s constitutional rights be-
cause it will allow a State to give final 
determination as it relates to federal 
elections, and that is as unconstitu-
tional as anything that can take place. 
Madam Speaker, I think that it is in-
cumbent upon the Federal Govern-
ment, the Congress, the House of Rep-
resentatives, and the Senate to do 
what is necessary to make sure that 
the United States Constitution still 
reigns supreme. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the distinguished gentleman 
from South Carolina for his comments. 
He clearly acted, as I indicated, and 
that is, he presented the history, but 
he brought us to the 21st century and 
2021. I think the challenge that we are 
now offering to the American people, 
incredulously, how can anyone try to 
undermine the votes of any American, 
and particularly those Americans of 
color? 
As I yield to the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina, let me at least just de-
pict for a moment the uniqueness of 
our history, for this picture is a picture

of a whipped, beaten back of a slave. 
That means that we had extraordinary 
conditions, 
extraordinary 
cir-
cumstances. In the 1800s preceding and 
around the Emancipation Proclama-
tion, I will just read these words as I 
yield: Congress put forward the 15th 
Amendment and it made it very clear 
that: 
No voting qualification or prerequisite to 
voting or standard, practice, or procedure 
shall be imposed or applied by any State or 
political subdivision in a manner which re-
sults in a denial or abridgement of the rights 
of any citizen of the United States to vote on 
the account of race, or color, or language mi-
nority status. 
This was coming out of slavery when 
they had the 13th Amendment that 
eliminated slavery but didn’t eliminate 
stigma and institutional racism, gave 
due process, and then gave the right to 
vote out of the history of what is de-
picted here. That is why this is so seri-
ous that an institutional rule cannot 
survive over the right to vote, and the 
big lie cannot supersede the right to 
vote. 
It is my pleasure to yield to the gen-
tlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. 
ADAMS), who is a historian and pro-
fessor in her own right and spent her 
life’s work teaching at historically 
Black colleges which were born out of 
the seeds or born out of the quagmire 
and the fires of slavery but born to 
make a difference. She has been a 
champion for the HBCUs and under-
stands what the denial of the vote and 
voting rights means to that constitu-
ency. 
b 2045 
Ms. 
ADAMS. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the coanchor, SHEILA JACKSON 
LEE. I thank her for her stellar leader-
ship and all of her diligent work and 
labor in this vineyard. 
To the dynamic coanchor, the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. TORRES), I 
thank him so very much. 
To our illustrious chair of the Con-
gressional Black Caucus, I am so very 
proud of her work and very proud of 
her leadership, and I thank her so 
much. 
Power is what makes the difference 
in lives and communities. The first 
thing you have to understand about 
power and how to get it: You don’t ask 
somebody how to get it, where it is, if 
you can have it. You take it. 
Madam Speaker, I rise tonight to 
talk about our most fundamental right 
in a democracy, the power of the vote, 
the right to vote. 
While we have made amazing strides 
over 
the 
past 
century—votes 
for 
women, voting rights for Native Ameri-
cans and indigenous people, the end of 
racist Jim Crow laws that completely 
suppressed the Black votes in certain 
States, and lowering the voting age to 
18—we are still marching because the 
promise of one person, one vote con-
tinues to be abridged by State legisla-
tures across the country. 
Marches, sit-ins, and protests are 
part of our rights as Americans, but we 
shouldn’t have to March 245 years after 
the Declaration of Independence. We 
shouldn’t have to march 151 years after 
the 15th Amendment guaranteed Black 
Americans the right to vote. We 
shouldn’t have to march a full century 
after women’s suffrage. 
But we will continue to march, and 
we will continue to make our voices 
heard until every adult citizen can 
freely, fairly, and easily access the bal-
lot. To cast a vote is at the core of 
what it means to be American. It is 
how we build a more perfect Union. 
Here in the House, we have passed 
voting rights bills that bring us closer 
to a more perfect Union. As we await 
the support of our Senate colleagues on 
this urgent matter, the issue of voting 
rights, I want to leave you with this 
because I have to tell you that, in my 
State of North Carolina, there is a lot 
of mischief going on, and there has 
been for a number of years. 
As the gentlewoman knows, my dis-
trict was considered to be the district 
that they described as ‘‘surgical preci-
sion.’’ It continues to be a problem. 
I have been a State legislator for 20 
years. I have witnessed legislation that 
targets African Americans with almost 
surgical precision and imposes cures 
for problems that did not exist—that 
is, unless you think African Americans 
voting is a problem. 
Congress cannot tolerate State-level 
attempts to curb our most funda-
mental right. Now is the time to make 
sure that every American who can vote 
has the opportunity to do so. This is 
our power, our message. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentlewoman for her point-
ed message about North Carolina and 
her district. I think I join her. My dis-
trict is a voting rights district, so we 
know what it is to be at the edge of 
surviving. 
The only way that we have survived 
is with the protection of the 1965 Vot-
ing Rights Act. We are living testi-
mony that it is crucial to the vast di-
versity that has been created in this 
House on behalf of the American peo-
ple. 
Madam Speaker, let me now take the 
pleasure of yielding to another distin-
guished Member who has had her own 
history in a very unique State. 
Someone asked the question: Is it 
Southern? Is it Northern? I think you 
only have to hear her—and, of course, 
the President of the United States, who 
is a very forthright leader. President 
Joe Biden and Vice President HARRIS 
have been forthright in confronting 
issues that have been meant to help 
the American people heal and unite. 
She has been right in the mix and, as 
well, has been a leader on labor issues, 
a leader on healthcare issues. But one 
thing she knows is the depth of dis-
parity that plagues a community when 
voting is extinguished. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Delaware (Ms. BLUNT 
ROCHESTER). 
Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER. Madam 
Speaker, I thank Congresswoman SHEI-
LA JACKSON LEE for her leadership and 
the things that she does to protect all 
of us across the country, not just in her 
district but across the country. We are 
greatly indebted to her for her service. 
The 
gentlewoman 
mentioned 
me 
coming from the State of Delaware and 
whether it is Southern or Northern. 
Many people might not know, but we 
are on the Mason-Dixon Line. We are 
urban, suburban, rural, and coastal. 
But we are also on that Mason-Dixon 
Line with that strong history. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gentle-
woman and her coanchor, Mr. TORRES, 
and I thank our esteemed chairwoman 
of the Congressional Black Caucus, 
JOYCE BEATTY. 
Madam Speaker, I stand before you 
tonight with a sense of urgency be-
cause the most fundamental and sacred 
right we have as Americans is under 
attack. 
Across 
this 
country, 
State 
law-
makers have introduced at least 389 re-
strictive bills in 48 States just this 
year, and 14 States have already en-
acted more restrictive voting laws. 
Even the highest court in the land is 
chipping away at this fundamental 
right. 
We know that those who would en-
gage in suppression, subversion, and in-
timidation are not resting, but neither 
is the Congressional Black Caucus. To-
night, we are standing up and speaking 
out because we know that just as our 
message is our power so, too, is our 
vote. 
I am going to say that again: Our 
vote is our power. 
We are here to protect and defend 
that right because the vote is tied to 
everything. The vote is tied to criminal 
justice reform. The vote is tied to 
healthcare. The vote is tied to the min-
imum wage increase across this coun-
try and access to affordable childcare. 
It is tied to the preservation of our de-
mocracy. It is tied to our very exist-
ence: the ability to drink clean water, 
breathe air that is free of pollution, 
and even to have a planet to live on. 
Everything is tied to the vote, and 
the vote is on the line. 
While we are fighting a new battle, it 
is the same old tactics that we have 
seen before. And it is a future we are 
not going back to. 
Yesterday, we lost another American 
civil rights leader and educator, Bob 
Moses. One of the many things that he 
was known for was Freedom Summer, a 
project to organize and register voters. 
Through intimidation and beating, Bob 
Moses never relented in his mission to 
register voters in the South. 
Sixty years later, it is our turn to an-
swer the question that Bob asked of 
students, a question that goes to the 
very core of who we are: What kind of 
society will we be? 
Today, the CBC is here to proclaim 
loudly and proudly: We will be the kind 
of society that values every voice, em-
powers every citizen, and counts every 
vote because it is all on the line. We 
must pass and have signed into law

H.R. 1, the For the People Act, and 
H.R. 4, the John Lewis Voting Rights 
Advancement Act. 
In honor of Bob Moses, let’s make 
this the Freedom Summer of our time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentlewoman for men-
tioning Bob Moses. 
For those of us who care and know 
about history, we know about Bob 
Moses, and it makes this night even 
more significant because if you are los-
ing the peaceful warriors who helped 
organize and put themselves on the 
line, then we must carry on. I thank 
the gentlewoman from Delaware. 
Madam Speaker, may I inquire how 
much time is remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman has 17 minutes remaining. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
let me make an argument regarding 
where we are, and then I will be happy 
to yield to my coanchor and happy to 
conclude. 
Madam Speaker, I wanted to reem-
phasize where we are today and reem-
phasize that, unfortunately, a bill that 
had been passed as bipartisan for years 
has been ‘‘upheavaled’’ by the Supreme 
Court. Unfortunately, a Supreme Court 
that, as my friend from New York de-
scribed, is an activist Supreme Court— 
the Shelby Court and now the Brnovich 
Court, absolutely wrongheaded deci-
sions. 
In Shelby, I believe the late Justice 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg said that you 
don’t throw away an umbrella in a 
rainstorm. 
Now, let me characterize these words 
and not attribute them. I think one of 
the other points that was made is: Just 
because polio is not on the rise, you 
don’t get rid of the polio vaccine. Just 
because you think COVID–19 is gone, 
you don’t throw all manner of pre-
cautions to the wind. 
Obviously, we see what is happening 
with this kind of reckless behavior and 
this kind of red State, blue State dis-
cord. People are dying. 
That is where we are with voting 
rights. The Shelby case in 2013 just im-
ploded the preclearance, which in actu-
ality says that as you begin to think 
about a bill that may have these dis-
criminatory 
impacts, 
they 
can 
be 
precleared by the Department of Jus-
tice and stopped in their tracks. Sec-
tion 2 says the harm has been done, and 
you can run into court making the ar-
gument that it is discriminatory. 
Tragically, all we were left with, be-
fore the Brnovich case, was section 2. 
But here, what has happened in this 
case that came out of Arizona—a place 
where the big lie is playing out every 
day with a false and misleading and 
disreputable vote count. To my col-
league, I don’t know what they found 
yet, but it is certainly one that has no 
basis in fact. 
The Court in Brnovich suggested that 
they would have something called 
guideposts—I call them burdens or sug-
gestions—that when reviewing claims 
that are facially so-called neutral elec-
tion policy, practice, or voting rule, 
and it is discriminating, you can look 
at these aspects. 
You can burden us by saying, ‘‘Here 
is what you look at.’’ Are they ordi-
nary burdens or mere inconvenience 
exception, the size of disparities and 
burdens imposed by the challenge rule, 
other opportunities to vote provided by 
a State’s election system. 
So, the polls are closed. You can’t do 
a mail ballot. You don’t have Souls to 
the Polls. So, just find some other way 
to vote. 
That is the question. They say, 
‘‘other opportunities to vote.’’ You 
close out all the other supporting as-
pects of voting, and maybe you can get 
to vote in a snowstorm. Maybe you can 
get to vote as a military person in bat-
tle. Maybe you can show up to the vot-
ing poll on election day because that is 
another opportunity. Maybe you can 
get on a plane and leave battle to vote. 
These are the just nonsensical aspects 
of the Brnovich case. 
Legitimate State interests justifying 
the challenge voting rule—oh, there is 
a State interest to close your polling 
locations in minority neighborhoods, 
to not have places to get a voter ID in 
eight counties in Texas when you have 
a law that says you must have a voting 
ID, or to close out Souls to the Polls, a 
perfectly legal concept to allow people 
who work around the clock through a 
Sunday to go vote. I guess you would 
tell them to just find another oppor-
tunity. 
When we were in the middle of 
COVID–19 and nurses and doctors were 
working 
around 
the 
clock, 
Harris 
County said: We will give you 24-hour 
voting. 
Legally, law enforcement present, 
machines in order, no fraud detected at 
all, but you are fighting COVID, and 
you might not get off until 1 a.m., 3 
a.m., 4 a.m. 
Yet, this is what the big lie brings 
about, and then the degree to which a 
voting rule departs from what was a 
standard practice when section 2 was 
amended in 1982. 
Now, the crisis of this is that all of 
this must be run down for you to be 
able to prevail under section 2, under 
the Brnovich case. 
Taken together, this Supreme Court 
cabal is saying to racial, ethnic, and 
language minorities already intimi-
dated—and you need to look at what 
John Lewis faced in 1965, this brunt 
force, law enforcement on horses chas-
ing foot soldiers back over the bridge, 
8-year-olds running for their lives, and 
bloodied older persons, foot soldiers, 
and John Robert Lewis, who said he 
thought he was going to die. 
b 2100 
That is what sacrifice has been made 
for voting. Taken together, this court 
decision is saying: What is the big 
deal? It is only voting. Just like with 
bad weather, sometimes you just have 
to grin and bear it and have a little in-
convenience. Just a little bit of dis-
crimination. Why are you concerned 
about that? 
And so I assume that without the 
24th amendment, that this conserv-
ative majority and the court will sub-
ject poll taxes and literacy tests to the 
review 
standard 
enunciated 
in 
Brnovich. Just a little bit of inconven-
ience. Take that money out and pay 
that poll tax. You don’t have any 
money? I guess your fundamental right 
to vote has just been extinguished. 
That is where we are today. That is 
why we are here today challenging the 
filibuster, speaking about the Fed-
eralist papers nullification, and trying 
to understand that the Constitution 
prevails over all of these miserly bills 
across the Nation. The 15th amend-
ment and then the Constitution state-
ment, very clearly says that Congress, 
that no one can nullify or stop your 
rights as a person that is elected to 
Congress because they have no rights. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD an article, an op-ed, that I sub-
mitted on June 26, 2021, authored by 
myself. 
WHERE GOP LAWMAKERS HAVE PASSED NEW 
VOTING RESTRICTIONS AROUND THE COUNTRY 
Republican state legislators have intro-
duced hundreds of bills that would tighten 
access to voting around the country, many 
of them echoing former president Donald 
Trump’s false claims that loose election laws 
allowed fraud to taint the 2020 White House 
race. 
The groundswell began early this year with 
the introduction of 253 bills proposing voting 
restrictions across 43 states as of mid-Feb-
ruary, according to the nonpartisan Brennan 
Center for Justice. That number rose to at 
least 389 bills in 48 states as of mid-May. 
The national spotlight is now on Texas 
after Democratic lawmakers left the state on 
July 12 in an effort to block passage of one 
of the most stringent new voting measures 
in the country. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) 
said the members could face arrest when 
they return, which is not expected until the 
state’s special legislative session concludes— 
potentially as late as Aug. 7. 
Across the country, 17 states have enacted 
laws this year that tighten the rules around 
casting ballots and running elections, ac-
cording to the nonpartisan Voting Rights 
Lab, which tracks developments in state 
election law. 
Many of the bills target mail voting and 
other policies that helped safeguard the fran-
chise during the coronavirus pandemic and 
produce the highest turnout among Amer-
ican voters in more than a century. 
Some of the bills also seek to curtail early 
voting, impose restrictions on voter registra-
tion efforts, limit the power of local officials 
to oversee elections and stop private donors 
from supplementing their operational budg-
ets. 
Democratic-controlled states have moved 
in the other direction, approving measures 
to formalize more permissive voting policies 
from 2020, complementing proposed federal 
legislation to protect voting rights with a 
set of national standards. 
In addition to the states listed below, Ala-
bama, Arkansas, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, 
Montana, North Dakota, New Hampshire, 
Nevada, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Wyo-
ming have also passed laws with restrictive 
language.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3896 
July 26, 2021 
STATES WITH SIGNIFICANT NEW VOTING 
RESTRICTIONS 
Arizona—Enacted May 11 and June 30 
Republicans in Arizona changed the state’s 
popular Permanent Early Voting List, which 
determines who receives mail ballots each 
election cycle. 
The new rules mean voters who do not cast 
a ballot at least once every two years will 
have to respond to a government notice to 
avoid being removed from the list and to 
continue getting a ballot in the mail. 
Another measure, signed into law on June 
30, stripped power from Democratic Sec-
retary of State Katie Hobbs, allowed third 
parties designated by the legislature to flag 
ineligible voters for removal from the rolls 
and provided funds for election security and 
post-election recounts. 
Florida—Enacted May 6 
New state law signed May 6 institutes a 
number of changes, including requiring vot-
ers to renew their mail voting application 
every two years and to submit a form of 
identification. 
With some exceptions, voters’ access to 
drop boxes for returning mail ballots will be 
limited to early voting hours, a maximum of 
12 hours per day. 
If any drop box is found to be accessible 
outside of these hours, the local supervisor 
of elections could be subject to a civil pen-
alty of $25,000. 
Voters will be permitted to drop off only 
two ballots for nonfamily members. 
The law gives partisan election observers 
more access to the ballot counting process. 
It also prevents behavior undertaken with 
the ‘‘intent’’ of influencing a voter, so the 
law is likely to bar efforts to provide food 
and water to people waiting in line to cast 
in-person ballots. 
Donations to election budgets from private 
individuals are also not allowed. 
Georgia—Enacted March 25 
Georgia’s new voting law signed by Gov. 
Brian Kemp (R) on March 25 imposes a num-
ber of restrictions on voting in the state, 
earning it comparisons to the Jim Crow laws 
that effectively blocked Black men and 
women from voting in the American South. 
Specifically, the rules prevent proactively 
sending mail ballot applications to voters, 
require voters to submit identification with 
their application to be approved and shorten 
the time frame for the application process to 
take place. 
Like several other states, Georgia added 
new restrictions on the use of mail ballot 
drop boxes and prohibited providing food or 
water to people waiting in line to vote in 
person. Legislators also stripped certain 
powers from the secretary of state, removing 
that official as chair of the State Election 
Board and allowing the General Assembly to 
select his or her replacement. 
Iowa—Enacted March 8 
New Iowa voting law shortens the applica-
tion period for mail ballots and bars election 
officials from proactively sending applica-
tion forms to voters. 
County auditors can face criminal charges 
if they do not follow certain procedures in 
purging voter rolls. 
The early voting period—and voting hours 
on Election Day are shorter. 
Local officials’ discretion in placing drop 
boxes is curtailed. 
WHAT TO WATCH IN COMING WEEKS 
Texas 
One of the most restrictive voting bills in 
the country was defeated—at least tempo-
rarily—in Texas on May 30, when a Demo-
cratic walkout in the state House caused the 
chamber to miss the deadline for passage. 
The GOP bills would empower partisan poll 
watchers and impose stiff penalties on elec-
tion administrators for actions such as send-
ing unsolicited mail ballot applications to 
voters. 
Comparing the legislation to Jim Crow 
laws, critics have said it would dispropor-
tionately affect people of color. 
The measures would prohibit drive-up vot-
ing and other methods used widely by Black 
and Latino voters in Houston to cast ballots 
during the coronavirus pandemic, as well as 
create strict signature-matching rules that 
could force the rejection of valid votes cast 
by mail. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I yield to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. TORRES), my co-anchor, and 
I thank him again for his joining me 
tonight, and for our journey that we 
are on trying to raise up justice in this 
country. 
Mr. TORRES of New York. Madam 
Speaker, both the 2020 and 2021 election 
cycles have been a powerful testament 
to the influence of the Black vote. 
I proudly come from New York State 
where we have seen a golden age of 
Black political power: the attorney 
general, the State Senate majority 
leader, the State assembly speaker, the 
mayor, are all Black. 
And we know that but for the Black 
vote, President Biden would have never 
won the Presidency, and the Democrats 
never would have won a majority in 
the Senate. And the attempts at voter 
suppression that we have seen threat-
ens to reverse the racial progress that 
has been made. 
Increasingly, we are becoming a mul-
tiracial democracy. You know, 70 per-
cent of the Democratic Caucus consists 
of people of color, women, and mem-
bers of the LGBTQ community. But 
you would never know that from the 
structure of the Senate. The structure 
of the Senate concentrates power in a 
small subset of States that are much 
Whiter, much more rural, much more 
conservative than the rest of the coun-
try. 
Before the Democratic party won the 
Senate in 2021, the Senate Republican 
majority represented 10 to 15 million 
fewer people than the Senate Demo-
cratic minority. And the problem is 
that the filibuster takes the undemo-
cratic structure of the Senate to an 
even greater extreme. 
The notion that one Senator, who 
represents a State smaller than our 
congressional districts, should have the 
power to overturn the will of the Presi-
dent and the Senate and the House, is 
profoundly undemocratic. It makes an 
absurdity of the democratic process. 
One particularly egregious example 
of the filibuster can be found in the 
area of gun safety. In a rational world, 
every gun would be registered and safe-
ly stored. Every gun owner would be li-
censed and trained. Every gun sale 
would be subject to a background 
check. 
But there is nothing rational about a 
political system that enables one Sen-
ator from a State smaller than my con-
gressional district to filibuster gun 
safety at the expense of 330 million 
Americans. 
Name any cause: LGBTQ equality, 
voting rights enforcement, immigra-
tion reform, democracy reform, crimi-
nal justice reform, all of these causes 
have died at the hands of the filibuster. 
I would submit to you that we have a 
party in America that is intent on 
holding power at any cost and by any 
means necessary. If the Republican 
party cannot win democratically, then 
it 
will 
insist 
on 
winning 
undemocratically through voter sup-
pression, gerrymandering, the struc-
ture of the Senate, the electoral col-
lege, right-wing judicial activism on 
the Supreme Court. All of these are 
means of holding onto power by any 
means necessary. All of these are 
means of subverting democracy at any 
cost. That is the challenge that lies be-
fore us. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentleman from New York. 
I am so glad he said the words ‘‘by any 
means necessary.’’ That is striking, 
and without a doubt, the approach of 
the activist Supreme Court, right- 
wing, of the big lies, and of those who 
wish to stall and stop the very lifeline 
of American democracy, and that is the 
right of each person to vote their con-
scious. 
As we have said: Our message, our 
power; but our voice, our vote; our 
vote, our voice. And I thank him for 
joining me this evening for elaborating 
and detailing and roll-calling where we 
are today. 
I notice the gentleman did not step 
in the breach and indicate that we 
might need to expand the Court. That 
is another discussion altogether. 
Madam Speaker, I am delighted to 
yield to the distinguished gentlewoman 
from Missouri (Ms. BUSH), a member of 
the Judiciary Committee. I think she 
can speak in her own way on the vital-
ity of a vote for poor people. 
Ms. BUSH. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the chairwoman for this moment to be 
able to address about something that I 
still have trouble understanding the 
need to address when people fell, when 
people bled, when people died, and we 
are still here. And all of that happened, 
so much of it happened before I was 
even born, even thought of, and we are 
still here. 
So, St. Louis and I, we rise today, be-
cause in Missouri our right to vote is 
being taken away. Taken away from 
many of us. And by us, let me be clear 
that I mean Black folks, I mean Brown 
folks, I mean Indigenous folks. 
b 2110 
Despite the raising of our voices, de-
spite the marching of our feet, and de-
spite our turning out the vote to de-
liver the government to Democrats, 
the Senate has yet to do anything 
about it. H.R. 1 is gathering dust in the 
Senate, and the filibuster remains in-
tact. With every passing day, the re-
ality of the situation worsens. 
Yet, rather than acting with urgency, 
some have even suggested instead we 
want to out-organize voter suppression.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3897 
July 26, 2021 
After an election year when Black, 
Brown, and indigenous organizers gave 
their blood, their sweat, and their tears 
to deliver a Democratic House, Senate, 
and White House. A year when Black 
women turned the longtime red State 
of Georgia blue. When Black, Brown, 
and indigenous voters stood in dis-
proportionately long lines to cast their 
ballots on an election day that is not a 
Federal holiday. A year when Black, 
Brown, and indigenous communities 
have been disproportionately harmed 
by this pandemic, yet turned out in the 
face of these suppression tactics to 
vote in record numbers. 
We did this because we were promised 
justice. We were promised that our 
right to vote would be secure, and we 
were promised a sustainable future. 
But rather than deliver on these 
promises, we were asked again to give 
our blood, our sweat, and our tears? 
To those who say just out-organize 
rather than legislate, I say shame. 
Shame, Madam Speaker, that you take 
our labor for granted. Shame that you 
take our struggle for granted, and 
shame that your promises continue to 
go unfulfilled. Like my chairwoman 
said, we have people who are living, 
struggling, burdened, and oppressed in 
ways that others aren’t, and are the 
ones who suffer the most. 
Shame that rather than doing every-
thing 
within 
your 
power, 
Madam 
Speaker, to deliver us the future, we 
are being asked to overcome voter sup-
pression again. 
To those who are telling us just to 
out-organize 
voter 
suppression, 
my 
message to you is this: We already did. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. I thank the gentle-
woman. Madam Speaker, thank you for recog-
nizing me to anchor this Special Order on the 
fierce urgency of preserving the precious right 
to vote by passing H.R. 4, the John Lewis Vot-
ing Rights Advancement Act, and legislation 
like H.R. 1, the For The People Act. 
I am delighted to be co-anchoring this Con-
gressional Black Caucus Special Order at the 
request of our tireless leader for justice, Con-
gresswoman JOYCE BEATTY of Ohio, and to be 
joined by co-anchor, Congressman RITCHIE 
TORRES of New York, and many members of 
the CBC. 
Before I begin, Madam Speaker, let me 
share some history and important numbers 
with our colleagues and the nation that show 
for most of the past 56 years, support for the 
Voting Rights Act and protecting, preserving, 
and expanding the right to vote of all Ameri-
cans has been an issue that Americans have 
supported in overwhelming numbers all across 
the nation. 
On July 9, 1965, House passed the Voting 
Rights Act by a 333–85 vote, with Democrats 
voting 221–61 and Republicans 112–24. 
House later approved the VRA conference 
report on August 3 by a 328–74 vote (Demo-
crats 217–54, Republicans 111–20). 
The Senate passed the VRA on August 4 
by a 79–18 vote, with Democrats voting 49–17 
and Republicans 30–1. 
This landmark legislation, P.L. 89–10, was 
signed into law by President Lyndon Johnson 
as on August 6, 1965. 
Five years later, on June 22, 1970, the VRA 
was renewed for five years as Public Law 91– 
285, passing the House by a vote of 272–132 
and the Senate by a vote of 64–12. 
Five years later, on June 4, 1975, Congress 
extended the VRA for seven years, enacting 
Public Law 94–73, with majorities of 341–70 in 
the House and 77–12 in the Senate. 
On June 29, 1982, a Republican-controlled 
Senate joined with a Democratic House to 
pass Public Law 97–205, extending the VRA 
for 10 years, with the vote in the Senate of 
85–8 and the vote in the House of 389–24. 
Ten years later, the bipartisan Voting Rights 
Language Assistance Act was passed as Pub-
lic Law 102–344 on August 26, 1992. 
And on July 27, 2006, the Voting Rights Act 
was extended for 25 years when the Congress 
passed Public Law 109–246 (H.R. 9), the 
Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, and Coretta 
Scott King Voting Rights Act Reauthorization 
and Amendments Act of 2006. 
The vote for H.R. 9 was 390–33 in the 
House and 98–0 in the Senate. 
Madam Speaker, every extension of the 
Voting Rights Act recounted above was signed 
into law by a Republican President, from Rich-
ard Nixon to Gerald Ford to Ronald Reagan to 
George H.W. Bush, and George W. Bush. 
This chain of bipartisan support for voting 
rights stood solid and unbreakable until the 
Supreme Court’s horrendous decision in 
Shelby County v. Holder 570 U.S. 529 (2013). 
PROTECTING AND PRESERVING VOTING RIGHTS 
Madam Speaker, the serious damage to the 
precious right to vote occasioned by the right- 
wing, conservative majority on the Supreme 
Court demands that Congress exercise its 
powers under Section 5 of the 15th Amend-
ment to restore the extraordinary reach and 
effectiveness of Section 2 and Section 5 of the 
Voting Rights Act. 
As an aside, Madam Speaker, on the objec-
tion of VRA opponents to states subject 
preclearance having the burden to bail them-
selves out, I have long said that the states 
that were subject to preclearance under the 
Voting Rights Act earned their way in, so it 
only fitting that they earn their way out. 
Madam Speaker, June 25, 2021, marked 
the 8th anniversary of the Supreme Court’s in-
famous decision in Shelby County v Holder, 
570 U.S. 529 (2013), which immobilized the 
Department of Justice from subjecting dis-
criminatory voting and election law changes to 
prior review and approval, or ‘‘preclearance.’’ 
It was predicted at the time by me and other 
defenders of the precious right to vote that the 
Court’s misguided and naı¨ve decision would 
usher in a wave of state and local initiatives 
intended to suppress and nullify the rights of 
black Americans, persons of color, young 
adults, and marginalized communities to exer-
cise the most basic act in the political process: 
voting. 
As we have seen in recent months, this pre-
diction has tragically come to pass. 
Not to be content with the monument to dis-
grace that is the Shelby decision, the activist 
right-wing conservative majority on the Rob-
erts Court, on July 1, 2021, issued its evil 
twin, the decision in the Arizona case of 
Brnovoich v. DNC, 594 U.S. l, No. 19–1257 
and 19–1258 (July 1, 2021), which engrafts on 
Section 2 of the Voting Rights onerous bur-
dens that Congress never intended and explic-
itly legislated against to ensure that: 
‘‘No voting qualification or prerequisite to 
voting or standard, practice, or procedure shall 
be imposed or applied by any State or political 
subdivision in a manner which results in a de-
nial or abridgement of the right of any citizen 
of the United States to vote on account of 
race or color, or language minority status.’’ 
Among these burdens, couched as ‘‘guide-
posts,’’ or ‘‘suggestions’’ are that when review-
ing claims that a facially neutral election law, 
policy, practice, or voting rule has a discrimi-
nator, and therefore unlawful, effect on minor-
ity citizens, courts are to consider the following 
matters: 
1. An ‘‘ordinary burdens’’ or ‘‘mere incon-
venience’’ exception; 
2. Size of disparities in burdens imposed by 
the challenged rule; 
3. Other opportunities to vote provided by a 
state’s election system; 
4. Legitimate state interests justifying the 
challenged voting rule; and 
5. The degree to which a voting rule departs 
from what was standard practice when Section 
2 was amended in 1982 
Taken together, this Supreme Court cabal is 
saying to racial, ethnic, and language minori-
ties: ‘‘What’s the big deal, it’s only voting. Just 
like with bad weather, sometimes you just 
have grin and bear a little inconvenience.’’ 
This Supreme Court majority has simply 
never understood, or refuses to accept, the 
fundamental importance of the right to vote, 
free of discriminatory hurdles and obstacles. 
Madam Speaker, were it not for the 24th 
Amendment, I venture to say that this con-
servative majority on the Court would subject 
poll taxes and literacy tests to the review 
standard enunciated in Brnovich v. DNC. 
Their predecessors on the Court understood 
this, going back at least as far as 1938, when 
the Supreme Court held in Chief Justice 
Hughes’ famous Footnote 4 in United States 
v. Carolene Products, 304 U.S. 144 (1938), 
that government action alleged to discriminate 
against ‘‘discrete and insular minorities’’ would 
be subject to ‘‘strict scrutiny’’ by reviewing 
courts. 
Madam Speaker, you might be asking who 
are these ‘‘discrete and insular minorities’’ 
about whom the Court was referring? 
The answer is they were and are persons 
‘‘excluded from ‘‘those political processes ordi-
narily to be relied upon to protect’’ them, racial 
and language minorities, and aliens, all of 
whom were denied the single most important 
tool for protecting and advancing one’s inter-
ests in a democracy: the right to vote. 
I ask unanimous consent to include in the 
record of this hearing, a June 26, 2021 op-ed 
authored by me entitled ‘‘A Strong Voting 
Rights Act Is Needed Now More Than Ever.’’ 
It is useful, Madam Speaker, to recount how 
we arrived at this day. 
Madam Speaker, fifty-six years ago, in 
Selma, Alabama, hundreds of heroic souls 
risked their lives for freedom and to secure the 
right to vote for all Americans by their partici-
pation in marches for voting rights on ‘‘Bloody 
Sunday,’’ ‘‘Turnaround Tuesday,’’ or the final, 
completed march from Selma to Montgomery. 
Those ‘‘foot soldiers’’ of Selma, brave and 
determined men and women, boys and girls, 
persons of all races and creeds, loved their 
country so much that they were willing to risk 
their lives to make it better, to bring it even 
closer to its founding ideals. 
The foot soldiers marched because they be-
lieved that all persons have dignity and the 
right to equal treatment under the law, and in 
the making of the laws, which is the funda-
mental essence of the right to vote.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3898 
July 26, 2021 
On that day, Sunday, March 7, 1965, more 
than 600 civil rights demonstrators, including 
our beloved former colleague, the late Con-
gressman John Lewis of Georgia, were bru-
tally attacked by state and local police at the 
Edmund Pettus Bridge as they marched from 
Selma to Montgomery in support of the right to 
vote. 
‘‘Bloody Sunday’’ was a defining moment in 
American history because it crystallized for the 
nation the necessity of enacting a strong and 
effective federal law to protect the right to vote 
of every American. 
No one who witnessed the violence and 
brutally suffered by the foot soldiers for justice 
who gathered at the Edmund Pettus Bridge 
will ever forget it; the images are deeply 
seared in the American memory and experi-
ence. 
On August 6, 1965, in the Rotunda of the 
Capitol and in the presence of such luminaries 
as the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and 
Rev. Ralph Abernathy of the Southern Chris-
tian Leadership Conference; Roy Wilkins of 
the NAACP; Whitney Young of the National 
Urban League; James Foreman of the Con-
gress of Racial Equality; A. Philip Randolph of 
the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters; John 
Lewis of the Student Non-Violent Coordinating 
Committee; Senators Robert Kennedy, Hubert 
Humphrey, and Everett Dirksen; President 
Johnson addressed the nation before signing 
the Voting Rights Act: ‘‘The vote is the most 
powerful instrument ever devised by man for 
breaking down injustice and destroying the ter-
rible walls which imprison men because they 
are different from other men.’’ 
The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was critical to 
preventing brazen voter discrimination viola-
tions that historically left millions of African 
Americans disenfranchised. 
In 1940, for example, there were less than 
30,000 African Americans registered to vote in 
Texas and only about 3 percent of African 
Americans living in the South were registered 
to vote. 
Poll taxes, literacy tests, and threats of vio-
lence were the major causes of these racially 
discriminatory results. 
After passage of the Voting Rights Act in 
1965, which prohibited these discriminatory 
practices, registration and electoral participa-
tion steadily increased to the point that by 
2012, more than 1.2 million African Americans 
living in Texas were registered to vote. 
In 1964, the year before the Voting Rights 
Act became law, there were approximately 
300 African-Americans in public office, includ-
ing just three in Congress. 
Few, if any, African Americans held elective 
office anywhere in the South. 
Because of the Voting Rights Act, in 2007 
there were more than 9,100 black elected offi-
cials, including 46 members of Congress, the 
largest number ever. 
Madam Speaker, the Voting Rights Act 
opened the political process for many of the 
approximately 6,000 Hispanic public officials 
that have been elected and appointed nation-
wide, including more than 275 at the state or 
federal level, 32 of whom serve in Congress. 
Native Americans, Asians and others who 
have historically encountered harsh barriers to 
full political participation also have benefited 
greatly. 
As I indicated, the crown jewel of the Voting 
Rights Act of 1965 is Section 5, which re-
quires that states and localities with a chronic 
record of discrimination in voting practices se-
cure federal approval before making any 
changes to voting processes. 
Section 5 has protected minority voting 
rights where voter discrimination has histori-
cally been the worst. 
Between 1982 and 2006, Section 5 stopped 
more than 1,000 discriminatory voting changes 
in their tracks, including 107 discriminatory 
changes right here in Texas. 
Passed in 1965 with the extraordinary lead-
ership of President Lyndon Johnson, the 
greatest legislative genius of our lifetime, the 
Voting Rights Act of 1965 was bringing dra-
matic change in many states across the 
South. 
But in 1972, change was not coming fast 
enough or in many places in Texas. 
In fact, Texas, which had never elected a 
woman to Congress or an African American to 
the Texas State Senate, was not covered by 
Section 5 of the 1965 Voting Rights Act and 
the language minorities living in South Texas 
were not protected at all. 
But thanks to the Voting Rights Act of 1965 
and the tireless voter registration work per-
formed in 1972 by Hillary Clinton in Texas, 
along ‘‘With hundreds of others, including her 
future husband Bill, Barbara Jordan was elect-
ed to Congress, giving meaning to the prom-
ise of the Voting Rights Act that all citizens 
would at long last have the right to cast a vote 
for person of their community, from their com-
munity, for their community. 
Madam Speaker, it is a source of eternal 
pride to all of us in Houston that in pursuit of 
extending the full measure of citizenship to all 
Americans, in 1975 Congresswoman Barbara 
Jordan, who also represented this historic 18th 
Congressional District of Texas, introduced, 
and the Congress adopted, what are now Sec-
tions 4(f)(3) and 4(f)(4) of the Voting Rights 
Act, which extended the protections of Section 
4(a) and Section 5 to language minorities. 
During the floor debate on the 1975 reau-
thorization of the Voting Rights Act, Congress-
woman Jordan explained why this reform was 
needed: 
‘‘There are Mexican-American people in the 
State of Texas who have been denied the 
right to vote; who have been impeded in their 
efforts to register and vote; who have not had 
encouragement from those election officials 
because they are brown people. 
‘‘So, the state of Texas, if we approve this 
measure, would be brought ‘‘within the cov-
erage of this Act for the first time.’’ 
When it comes to extending and protecting 
the precious right to vote, the Lone Star 
State—the home state of Lyndon Johnson and 
Barbara Jordan—could be the leading state in 
the Union, one that sets the example for the 
nation. 
But to realize that future, Texas must turn 
from and not return to the dark days of the 
past. 
By embracing the discriminatory Texas SB7 
and the ‘‘Big Lie’’ that the 2020 election, by all 
accounts adjudged the most secure and inclu-
sive in American history, was riven by voter 
fraud, Texas Republicans are making the 
wrong choice to their eternal shame. 
Texans must remain ever vigilant and op-
pose all schemes that will abridge or dilute the 
precious right to vote, like the odious Texas 
SB7 recently passed by the Texas State Sen-
ate but killed, but not yet permanently, by the 
unity and courage of Democrats in the Texas 
State House of Representatives. 
Madam Speaker, I applaud the House 
Democrats of the Texas General Assembly for 
being on the front lines, fighting in opposition 
to Texas SB7 on the House floor and I join 
with them in calling upon the U.S. Senate to 
eliminate the filibuster and to bring to the floor 
for debate and vote—so Congress can pass— 
H.R. 1 and H.R. 4, the John Lewis Voting 
Rights Advancement Act. 
We must all do our part to preserve this 
most important heritage because it was 
earned with the sacrifices and the lives of our 
ancestors. 
The right to vote is a ‘‘powerful instrument 
that can break down the walls of injustice’’ and 
must be protected against attack from all en-
emies, foreign and domestic, using all the 
legal tools at our disposal. 
Madam Speaker, the right to vote and to 
participate meaningfully in civic and political 
affairs has done more to advance the cause of 
freedom, justice, and equality than the Second 
Amendment has ever done, if it has done any-
thing at all. 
It is time the Congress act to protect and 
expand the right to vote, the only right that is 
preservative of every other right. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD an article titled ‘‘John Lewis 
leaves behind a powerful legacy of so-
cial justice.’’ 
[From the Washington Post, July 19, 2020] 
JOHN LEWIS LEAVES BEHIND A POWERFUL 
LEGACY OF SOCIAL JUSTICE 
(By Peniel E. Joseph) 
On July 17, congressman and civil rights 
leader John Lewis died at 80, on the same 
day as 95-year-old stalwart C.T. Vivian, Mar-
tin Luther King’s favorite preacher. Both 
leave behind a legacy of social justice activ-
ism that played a pivotal role in some of the 
most resounding victories of the civil rights 
movement: America’s Second Reconstruc-
tion. 
Lewis’s death comes at a critical moment 
in U.S. history, amid a moral and political 
reckoning on black dignity and citizenship 
that represents nothing less than a Third 
American Reconstruction. And his life pro-
vides lessons for activists today on how to 
confront racial violence, forge productive al-
liances and transform American democracy. 
Born in 1940 in Troy, Ala., to a family of 
sharecropping farmers, the deeply religious 
Lewis joined the movement for black dignity 
and citizenship as a student activist in Nash-
ville. Already enthralled by the dazzling ora-
tory of the young Martin Luther King Jr., 
Lewis enjoyed an unusual kind of political 
apprenticeship under the mentorship of an 
array of movement leaders. He learned the 
practical application of nonviolent civil dis-
obedience from the Rev. James Lawson and 
became fast friends with fellow student ac-
tivists such as Diane Nash. Ella Baker, 
founder of the Student Nonviolent Coordi-
nating 
Committee 
(SNCC, 
pronounced 
‘‘snick’’), played a critical role in convincing 
students such as Lewis that they—and not 
just King and older generations of preach-
ers—could play pivotal leadership roles in an 
unfolding national drama. 
Lewis’s calm demeanor, personal sincerity 
and outward humility made him a quiet star 
among student leaders. He was arrested doz-
ens of times for civil rights activism between 
1960 and 1966. In 1961, he joined hundreds of 
volunteers on Freedom Rides, traveling 
throughout the Jim Crow South to challenge 
segregated bus terminals. On May 14, 1961, 
Lewis experienced a vicious beating at the 
hands of a white mob as a Freedom Rider in 
Anniston, Ala. It was the first of many bru-
tal experiences he endured as an activist,

and such punishment bolstered Lewis’s polit-
ical resolve to defeat racial segregation. 
Elected chairman of SNCC in 1963, Lewis 
became the youngest national civil rights 
leader of the 1960s. At 23, he was the young-
est speaker at the March on Washington on 
Aug. 28, 1963. Although parts of the collec-
tively written speech were abandoned after 
objections from white allies in the move-
ment, Lewis prepared the nation for contin-
ued racial combat in the service of justice. 
‘‘By the force of our demands, our deter-
mination and our numbers, we shall splinter 
the desegregated South into a thousand 
pieces and pull them back together in the 
image of God and democracy,’’ he argued. 
Lewis effectively navigated between stu-
dent militants in SNCC—which craved trans-
formational political change radical enough 
to protect black life in the Mississippi Delta 
and Alabama black belt—and more prag-
matic civil rights leaders who viewed the 
Democratic Party as the most effective vehi-
cle for widespread social change. In 1964, 
Lewis encountered Malcolm X while touring 
Africa in hopes of forging international alli-
ances to strengthen domestic black freedom 
struggles and came away from his meeting 
impressed with the black nationalist icon’s 
willingness to explore political alliances 
with civil rights leaders. 
On March 7, 1965, Lewis, dressed in a crisp 
white shirt, tie, raincoat and backpack, 
joined several hundred demonstrators cross-
ing the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, 
Ala., who were routed by blue-helmeted state 
troopers. The violence that afternoon left 
Lewis with permanent scars on his head. But 
the activists’ resolve in the face of violent 
opposition helped trigger the moral and po-
litical outrage that led to the passage of vot-
ing rights legislation. Lewis’s involvement 
at that moment made visible to the whole 
nation the violent, racist dehumanization of 
black people. 
In May 1966, Stokely Carmichael, the char-
ismatic Howard University activist and 
friend turned organizational rival, replaced 
Lewis as SNCC chairman. Carmichael’s call 
for ‘‘Black Power!’’ the next month during a 
civil rights demonstration in Mississippi 
helped to transform the aesthetics of the 
black freedom struggle. Lewis completed his 
college degree at Fisk University at the mo-
ment when Black Power activists were call-
ing for a dramatic and radical restructuring 
of American democracy. The political vision 
of Black Power activists, despite political 
disagreements with Carmichael and SNCC, 
inspired Lewis, who used the racial soli-
darity forged in the crucible of the move-
ment as a springboard to political office. 
As the radical hopes of the 1960s faded in 
the aftermath of King’s assassination on 
April 4, 1968, Lewis turned to electoral poli-
tics. In 1986, he won the Georgia congres-
sional seat he would hold until his death in 
an ugly political battle with Julian Bond, 
the charismatic SNCC activist and former 
friend turned bitter adversary. Over the next 
34 years, Lewis went from staring down the 
forces of white supremacy at bus stations 
and bridges to confronting these same adver-
saries in the U.S. Congress. Bringing orga-
nizing skills learned as an activist and rad-
ical ideas about transforming American life, 
he fought valiantly for health-care, gun-con-
trol and anti-poverty legislation. During the 
late 1980s and 1990s as the nation turned 
away from the vision of the ‘‘Beloved Com-
munity’’ outlined at the March on Wash-
ington, Lewis advocated for a return to the 
anti-poverty and anti-racist policies that 
briefly flourished during the 1960s. 
The 
American 
political 
establishment, 
over time, caught up with his accomplish-
ments. Barack Obama’s watershed presi-
dential election proved a boon to Lewis’s po-
litical legacy, with the first black president 
acknowledging the congressman’s towering 
achievements with a Presidential Medal of 
Freedom. Lewis recognized Obama’s ascent 
as part of a political harvest reaped from the 
bloodstained sacrifices of earlier genera-
tions. 
Lewis understood that those struggles for 
black dignity and citizenship continued dur-
ing his lifetime. He embraced the Black 
Lives Matter movement, including the re-
cent national and global protests for racial 
justice and equality in the aftermath of 
George Floyd’s killing at the hands of police. 
‘‘It is so much more massive and all-inclu-
sive,’’ Lewis noted of Black Lives Matter. 
Whereas black women, including those who 
helped to nurture Lewis and lead the move-
ment, were excluded from speaking at the 
March on Washington in 1963, he marveled to 
witness the prominence of black women in 
the BLM movement—as featured leaders, or-
ganizers and strategists. As an elder states-
man within political and civil rights circles, 
Lewis continued to encourage the young to 
lead a movement he recognized as con-
tinuing into our own time. 
Lewis’s extraordinary life offers important 
lessons for contemporary generations orga-
nizing for black equality in America and 
around the world. His example teaches us 
that movements for racial justice have al-
ways been denigrated by authorities and 
been targets of violence by political, legisla-
tive and military bodies. Young people who 
refused to heed the warnings of an older gen-
eration helped to transform American de-
mocracy, but they received crucial men-
toring from a council of elders who believed, 
like Baker, that strong people did not re-
quire charismatic top-down patriarchal lead-
ership. To the contrary, young activists 
could be trusted to ask the right questions 
that would lead to what Lewis called the 
‘‘good trouble’’ capable of ending systemic 
racism, structural violence and white su-
premacy. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
the right to vote free from intimidation or ob-
stacle is the most precious right of any Amer-
ican citizen, a pillar of our democratic system. 
And when that right, that pillar, is threatened 
for anyone, it is a threat to us all—to our de-
mocracy and to our very way of life. 
For Texans, this fight is personal. Earlier 
this year, Republican lawmakers in the Texas 
Legislature introduced a series of new voting 
laws, yet antiquated in thought, that would re-
strict access to the polls for people across the 
state. Unfortunately, we are all too familiar 
with these types of efforts to strip our right to 
vote here in Texas. In fact, I remember having 
to pay a poll tax when I voted in my first elec-
tion in Dallas. And although these new efforts 
are not as blatant as a poll tax, they are 
equally as confining. 
These new waves of voter restriction efforts 
are not new—and neither is the opposition to 
them. From our late colleague Congressman 
John Lewis marching across the Edmund 
Pettis Bridge in 1965, to the extension of the 
Voting Rights Act in 2006, to the Texas Demo-
crats breaking quorum to prevent the passage 
of restrictive voting laws this month. It is in-
cumbent upon us to keep alive that opposition 
to similar efforts, and to inform and inspire the 
next generation to do the same. 
It is in that spirit that I, once again, call on 
the Senate to pass H.R. 1, the For the People 
Act. We can no longer afford the cost of inac-
tion on this issue. This fight is about the future 
of Texas, it’s about the future of the United 
States, and it’s about the future of democracy. 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, 
this month marked the one-year anniversary of 
the passing of our dear friend and beloved 
colleague John Lewis. Sadly, while we reflect 
upon his legacy, there are efforts underway in 
State Houses across the nation to turn back 
the clock and erect barriers to voter participa-
tion in elections. 
We all know that the premise behind these 
efforts is a lie—namely, that the 2020 election 
was stolen and that there was rampant voter 
fraud. In my home state of Georgia, these 
falsehoods led to the passage and ultimate 
enactment of Senate Bill 202, which was given 
the misleading name, ‘‘the Georgia Civics Re-
newal Act.’’ The lie also provided the impetus 
for the attack on the United States Capitol on 
January 6. 
The measures being put forward in states 
like Georgia reduce voter access to the polls 
under the guise of protecting the vote. Geor-
gia’s SB 202 limits drop boxes, imposes ID re-
quirements on absentee voting, restricts early 
voting on weekends, allows state officials to 
circumvent the work of election officials if they 
do not like the results they are seeing, and 
even makes it a crime to offer food and water 
to voters waiting in line. 
It is a ruse that disproportionately impacts 
voters whose voices have too often been si-
lenced. Why? Because those voices—African 
American voices in Georgia—made all the dif-
ference in 2020. 
The integrity of our elections is enhanced by 
greater voter participation—not less. As Martin 
Luther King, Jr. once said, ‘‘voting is the foun-
dation stone of political action.’’ 
Earlier this year, I co-sponsored H.R. 1, For 
the People Act, which is a voting and elections 
bill that protects access, promotes the creation 
of fairer districts, and supports public financing 
of campaigns. The legislation passed the 
House on March 3 by a vote of 220 to 210. 
I also supported H.R. 4, the John Lewis Vot-
ing Rights Enhancement Act, which the House 
had approved last Congress. 
H.R. 4 is intended to fix the enforcement 
provisions of the original Voting Rights Act 
that were gutted by the Supreme Court in the 
2013 Shelby County v. Holder decision. 
The Court’s conservative majority held that 
the formula for determining whether jurisdic-
tions were subject to the law’s Justice Depart-
ment pre-clearance procedure for voting and 
election changes by state and local govern-
ments were outdated. This mostly focused on 
southern states with a long history of racially 
discriminatory voter suppression. 
Contrary to the court’s opinion and since 
then, hundreds of bills across several state 
legislatures have been proposed that would 
make access to the ballot box increasingly dif-
ficult for many people—more so for commu-
nities of color, students, seniors, and disabled 
people. Some of these bills have become law. 
In many cases, those who are rolling back 
access to the vote are also involved in the de-
cennial redistricting process in which congres-
sional and state legislative maps will be set 
until 2032. 
These are precisely the kind of decisions 
the Justice Department was able to scrutinize 
under the pre-Shelby County Voting Rights 
Act. 
The John Lewis Voting Rights Enhancement 
Act will rectify this wrong and fine-tune that

formula so that the Supreme Court cannot 
strike it down again. 
Madam Speaker, I know that John Lewis is 
looking down upon us now. If he were here 
with us today, I know that he would be on the 
House floor tonight and would be imploring us 
in that booming voice of his to continue the 
fight for voting rights to which he devoted his 
life and career. 
It is the same fight for which he endured un-
speakable brutality while attempting to cross 
the Edmund Pettus Bridge on the march from 
Selma to Montgomery. We cannot turn back 
now. 
f 
ISSUES OF THE DAY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. ROY) is recognized until 10 p.m. as 
the designee of the minority leader. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I have 
been listening to my friend from Texas, 
the gentleman from New York, and 
other speakers, my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle, and I can’t help 
but observe the reality of the Shelby 
County decision as it was offered by 
the United States Supreme Court’s ma-
jority authored by Chief Justice Rob-
erts. 
Now, what my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle fail to mention is 
the fact that the Voting Rights Act re-
mains intact and the Voting Rights 
Act remains fully in effect, and its pur-
pose to ensure and preserve the ability 
of Americans to vote remains fully the 
law of the land. The core question be-
fore the Court back in 2012 or 2013—I 
think it was argued in ‘12 and decided 
in ‘13—was whether section 5, the spe-
cific preclearance provision, was, in 
fact, constitutional. 
Now, the fact of the matter is when 
this was reauthorized back in I think 
2006, it was reauthorized based on a 50- 
year-old coverage formula. 
Now, my friend from Texas knows 
that. My colleagues on the other side 
of the aisle know that it was using a 50- 
year-old coverage formula. Now, people 
may want to just kind of sweep that 
aside and say that doesn’t matter, but 
then go back and read the Supreme 
Court’s opinion in 1966 on the first 
challenge on the Voting Rights Act and 
what the Court was saying at the time, 
that when you set aside the funda-
mental role of the States in carrying 
out elections, when you set aside the 
10th Amendment, Madam Speaker, as 
the 1965 Voting Rights Act was seeking 
to do, well, then there has to be a par-
ticularly strong purpose. 
What was that particularly strong 
purpose? 
Invidious discrimination of the kind 
of the Jim Crow South of the poll taxes 
and of massive disparities in voting 
rates among populations in districts 
where those prohibitions existed. 
Fast-forward 50 years through sev-
eral iterations of the reauthorization 
of the Voting Rights Act, and in 2012, 
2013, when this was being debated and 
when the Court decided it, the Court 
said: Look, sorry, you can’t apply 50- 
year-old data to uphold and reauthor-
ize the Voting Rights Act. 
Now, I know that, because I was a 
lawyer on the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee, and I pored over every one of 
those documents that came before us 
and read and reviewed them sitting as 
a staffer on the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee where we knew full well what 
the data was showing us and what the 
data looked like. But here we are right 
now and the American people are only 
hearing that part of the story that we 
are somehow unwinding the Voting 
Rights Act. 
We have done no such thing. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Will the gen-
tleman yield? 
Mr. ROY. Out of enormous respect 
for my friend from Texas, despite the 
way these hours normally work, I yield 
briefly to the gentlewoman from Texas. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. The gentleman 
is always enormously courteous, and I 
will be brief. 
Since I was on the committee the 
gentleman might have been staff, but I 
know in the House, for example, we had 
at least 100 hearings and 15,000 pages of 
testimony. It was chaired at that time 
by Jim Sensenbrenner, a Republican, 
who was meticulous in making sure we 
had a record. So I am not sure where 
the gentleman is getting his informa-
tion from. 
I will just finish by simply saying 
that the voter suppression laws that we 
are dealing with today are all engaged 
responding to the big lie that there was 
not a legitimate election in 2020, and 
my good friend knows that President 
Joe Biden and KAMALA HARRIS were 
elected in 2020. So we wonder the basis 
of these voter suppression laws. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman, and I will not take more of his 
time. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I appre-
ciate the gentlewoman. Let me just 
say, I think this body would do a won-
der for the American people if we could 
engage in this for hours, not seconds. 
And I think the gentlewoman agrees 
that we should have this kind of debate 
back and forth so the American people 
can see so we can flush out our dif-
ferences, because there are things we 
agree on, and there are things we dis-
agree on. 
What I would respond to the gentle-
woman about the point of what oc-
curred, poring over it as a staffer as I 
did, was that the Members, including 
the chairman of the Judiciary Com-
mittee then, Mr. Sensenbrenner, as 
well as on the Senate side—and I won’t 
speak for the House, because I was on 
the Senate side—but I was in the room 
with Chairman Specter, I was in the 
room with all of those that were in 2006 
going through all this, and I was in the 
room with about 15 Republicans who 
were sitting over there, each of whom 
said that it was unconstitutional, we 
can’t really do this, but we dare not go 
down this political road. 
Okay, well, that is what that is. 
Fast-forward, and for my colleagues 
on the other side of the aisle to bemoan 
‘‘activist Courts,’’ well, welcome to the 
club. Welcome to the party of being 
concerned about activist Courts. I 
would argue this is not activism, but, 
fine, let’s have that debate about how 
much power we want to cede to the 
building over there across the street, 
because when we are talking about ac-
tivism, we can go way back on activ-
ism in terms of our views in terms of 
Roe, in terms of Planned Parenthood v. 
Casey, and other areas in which the 
Court has inserted itself into the public 
domain. 
But, okay, here we are. The legisla-
ture acted, and the Court said: Whoa, 
whoa, you can’t do that. 
Why did they do that? Applying the 
10th Amendment, applying fundamen-
tals of federalism, and applying the 
fact that States have primacy over 
election laws. 
That is what the Court did. If you be-
lieve in judicial review subsequent to 
Marbury v. Madison, as I believe my 
friend from Texas, who is now leaving 
the floor, does believe in, well, then 
that is actually what the Court was 
doing. That is what they did. That is 
what the opinion says. When you read 
the opinion, Madam Speaker, it is just 
dripping with all of the things that you 
would expect it to be filled with in 
terms of deference to what occurred in 
1965, what the Supreme Court said sub-
sequent to that about why it was in a 
particularly important time for Con-
gress to step over the role of the States 
because of the nature of the invidious 
discrimination in Jim Crow South and 
other areas of the country. 
It wasn’t just the South, by the way, 
there were counties all over the coun-
try. 
But, Madam Speaker, 
when 
you 
looked at the data—and I pored over 
the data—we showed places there were 
counties in Florida that were covered, 
counties in Florida that weren’t cov-
ered, and you could see that the voting 
rates of Black voters, Hispanic voters, 
and other voters, that vast numbers of 
people were turning out and showing 
up to vote, those numbers were even 
higher in some of the covered jurisdic-
tions. 
So you had no reason or basis to 
cover one county versus another in the 
State of Florida, Madam Speaker. 
But I would challenge all of my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle to 
go open up those views, go look in and 
look at the data, look at the tables, 
and what you will find, Madam Speak-
er, is that there were significant num-
bers of counties and States that were 
then at that time covered by the Vot-
ing Rights Act that had better turnout 
rates and better participation rates 
than those that were uncovered which 
left the Court looking at the law and 
said: Well, hold on a second. 
The whole reason that the Court 
upheld the law was because there was a 
unique circumstance where there were 
mass disparities because of very direct 
actions by those States.

I want the American people to know 
that because that is what is being said 
right now. 
b 2120 
So suddenly, if I say: Hey, we might 
want voter ID. 
Now, why might we want voter ID? 
Just to ensure that the one person who 
is voting in one person, one vote is ac-
tually the vote. 
I say I want voter ID. Maybe that is 
because I have witnessed reasons why 
that is so. Somehow that is voter sup-
pression? 
That is what is so entirely frus-
trating is that you come forward and 
you say: Hey, I think that there is a 
good reason for this that, in my mind, 
I see very clearly as being important 
for the integrity of the election. 
Let’s not get wrapped around in the 
2016 or 2020 election cycles. I have said 
a lot on the floor of the House at var-
ious times about those matters. Let’s 
just actually focus on voter integrity, 
election integrity, and wanting to 
make sure that the people who vote 
know that their vote is going to count 
fully, and that you are not going to 
have someone voting with your ID. 
We know for sure that there are indi-
viduals who come to the United States 
and use the identification of others, of 
Americans. We know that for sure. 
That is a fact. 
We know that we end up with mul-
tiple people voting. We end up with all 
sorts of different possible and potential 
fraudulent activity. 
For example, The New York Times, 
in 2012: ‘‘Yet, votes cast by mail are 
less likely to be counted, more likely 
to be compromised, and more likely to 
be contested than those cast in a vot-
ing booth.’’ That is The New York 
Times, that bastion of rightwing con-
spiracy. 
We know that the Carter-Baker Com-
mission, Jimmy Carter, known right-
wing conspirator from Georgia, and 
James Baker, again, not really known 
to be a rightwing activist, quote in 
their report, ‘‘Absentee ballots remain 
the largest source of potential voter 
fraud.’’ 
That is just data. It is just analyzing 
it. It is just fact. 
Then, you go through other examples 
of known fraud. 
Madam Speaker, 2016, at least 83 reg-
istered voters in San Pedro, California, 
received absentee ballots at the same 
small two-bedroom apartment. 
In a 2018 North Carolina congres-
sional race, a Republican operative, L. 
McCrae Dowless, Jr., had allegedly re-
quested more than 1,200 absentee bal-
lots on voters’ behalf and then col-
lected the ballots from voters’ homes 
when they were mailed out. That was a 
Republican operative. I am an equal 
opportunity presenter of the facts here 
of how fraud can occur. 
I can go through item after item. In 
2017, an investigation of a Dallas City 
Council election found 700 fraudulent 
mail-in ballots signed by the same wit-
ness using a fake name. 
There is other voter fraud in Texas. 
Since 2005, the Office of the Attorney 
General successfully prosecuted 534 in-
cidents of fraud against 155 individuals, 
et cetera, et cetera. 
I can go through county by county. 
In Medina County, Texas, four people, 
including an elected justice of the 
peace, were charged in February with 
150 counts of election fraud. The 
charges included ballot harvesting and 
illegal voting. I can go example by ex-
ample. 
Now, were all of those examples I 
just gave enough to turn an election? I 
don’t know. That is the point. We 
would like to know wherever that 
truth may lead, in whatever State and 
whatever county, wherever that takes 
us. But those are the facts. 
So, when somebody comes forward 
and says, ‘‘Hey, I think we ought to 
have voter ID. I think we ought to have 
voter ID or a way to attach an indi-
vidual to a mail-in ballot,’’ suddenly 
that is voter suppression? Right. 
So, suddenly, Major League Baseball 
walks in and says: I have an idea. Let’s 
pull out the All-Star Game from At-
lanta, Georgia, where we could cele-
brate Hank Aaron in a 50 percent Black 
city, and let’s go move it over to Colo-
rado, into Denver, which is a 10 percent 
Black city. And let’s pat ourselves on 
the back for being so exceptionally in 
tune with what is going on in the 
world. Let’s move the All-Star Game to 
Colorado. 
Why? The laws that were put on the 
books in Georgia this year, that were 
being voted on in Georgia, would basi-
cally make parity with what Colorado 
already has on the books. 
This is the kind of debate we want to 
be able to have. Can we just, like, all 
agree? Let’s get a whiteboard up and 
put the facts up of what these things 
are, what the bills are, what these laws 
are, and then at least be debating from 
the same sheet of music. 
I may have a few more things to say. 
I know I have some colleagues here. I 
want to be mindful of their time. 
I digressed there a little bit because 
I was hearing my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle. But election in-
tegrity is so critically important right 
now, and I have colleagues from Texas 
who are completely abandoning their 
duty—I should say State legislature 
colleagues, to be clear—who are aban-
doning their duty to represent their 
constituents in the State of Texas in 
the legislature and have a full-throated 
debate about S.B. 1 and H.B. 3, the cur-
rent bills in the legislative session, the 
special session in Texas, and have come 
to D.C. They are not doing their jobs. 
Look, man, I generally want to flee 
D.C. to go back to Texas. It is rare that 
I see people saying I want to flee Texas 
to come to D.C. 
But these Democratic members of 
the Texas Legislature have fled Austin 
to skip out on working in the Texas 
legislative session and have an open de-
bate. They are coming to D.C. to sit 
down with the Vice President to go 
push and promote H.R. 1 or other bills 
to say we need to federalize elections 
instead of actually doing their job, 
which brings me to my point. 
I will say a few things here, and then 
I will recognize my colleagues. At some 
point, we have to decide what it is that 
is actually sacred about what we are 
doing here as a Nation and as a body. 
Our borders, right now, are wide 
open. Opioids are skyrocketing. Mas-
sive numbers cross the border. I will 
get into some of these details in a 
minute. We do it. I have done it before. 
We have the schools that are teach-
ing so-called antiracism. 
I walked through the Austin airport 
today and saw the book by Ibram 
Kendi, the antiracism book. I can’t re-
member the title. I saw it sitting there 
in the bookstore BookPeople. I didn’t 
see a whole lot of conservative books in 
there, but I saw that book, sitting 
there in the front. 
On page 19 of that book, he writes: 
‘‘If racial discrimination is defined as 
treating, considering, or making a dis-
tinction in favor of or against an indi-
vidual based on that person’s race, 
then racial discrimination is not inher-
ently racist. The defining question is 
whether the discrimination is creating 
equity or inequity. If discrimination is 
creating equity, then it is antiracist.’’ 
Interesting definition of discrimina-
tion. Not sure that fits within the Civil 
Rights Act, but I will leave that for an-
other discussion. 
But what I am saying is, we are 
heightening the level to which every 
single aspect of our lives is taken 
through a political lens, every single 
thing. 
I am asking my staff to look at every 
hearing that this body has had since 
the beginning of January and tell me 
what percentage of the hearings has 
had a focus or something to do on race, 
on sexual orientation, or an issue in 
that type of framework. I guarantee 
you—I don’t have to count them—that 
number is going to be massively high. 
I will just go ahead and stipulate 
right now, without having done any 
counting, the percentage of hearings 
that this body has held, the percentage 
of hearings that focused on race, 
LGBTQ 
issues, 
sexual 
orientation, 
those issues will be extraordinarily 
high as a percentage. 
So, the majority believes that is 
where our focus should be—while we 
just spent $6 trillion, while inflation is 
running through the roof, while small 
businesses can’t hire people. My col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
know this because, assuredly, they 
have small businesses in their district, 
or they go to the restaurants, or they 
go to the places like I have gone to and 
they can’t hire people because we are 
paying people more not to work than 
to work. 
We have a principal focus on race-re-
lated issues, a complete abandonment 
of the responsibility of this body to se-
cure the border of the United States. It 
is wide open, opioids running amuck.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE

July 26, 2021 
Cartels own it. People are pouring 
across it, to their detriment and ours. 
Ranchers are getting overrun in Texas. 
Now, today, just yesterday, or, I 
don’t know, the last few days, the Sen-
ate Armed Services Committee voted 
overwhelmingly to draft our daughters. 
Heck, we had 8 Republicans of the 13 
vote for that nonsense, to draft our 
daughters. 
Who are we? Genuine question: Who 
are we, as a people, as a country? 
Where are the sacred boundaries of 
being able to decide how to live and to 
recognize truths that man is man, that 
woman is woman, and that I, as a fa-
ther, do not want to have my daughter 
get drafted? 
You say, well, you can draft your 
son, use the power of the government 
to draft your son. 
We can have a debate about ending 
the draft. Everyone comes back and 
says: Well, don’t worry. There is not 
going to be a draft. There hasn’t been a 
draft in 50 years, so don’t worry about 
it. 
b 2130 
What do you mean don’t worry about 
it? When my daughter turns 18 in 8 
years and she has to go sign a piece of 
paper to register, I shouldn’t be wor-
ried about my daughter getting drafted 
and getting sent to a foxhole in Af-
ghanistan or Iraq or somewhere else? 
What do you mean don’t worry about 
that? 
Yet, that is precisely what this body 
is doing. The Senate Armed Services 
Committee voted on it; the House al-
ready has that language. 
Let me be perfectly clear. I will not 
be honoring whatever law says it is 
drafting my daughter. That is the fun-
damental problem. The rule of law de-
pends on it being rooted in any basic 
understanding of who we are as a peo-
ple, where we come from, what our val-
ues are, and then actually being able to 
get the consent of the governed in a 
way that actually connects with the 
governed. 
It doesn’t just come on down from on 
high, from a Senate Armed Services 
Committee that votes, by the way, be-
hind closed doors, not in public view-
ing. And by the way, none of them will 
go out and enforce this garbage. But 
somebody one day will show up and 
hand a form to my daughter and say, ‘‘I 
am sorry, ma’am, you are going to 
have to register for the draft.’’ And I 
am going to be sitting there as a dad— 
and I promise you, my wife is a little 
more fired up about this than I am. My 
wife is going to be sitting there saying: 
‘‘Over my dead, dang body.’’ 
Now, this is what we do when we rip 
apart our society, when we forget 
where those sacred boundaries are, 
about what the role of this institution 
is, or how we are supposed to govern. 
I am going to pause for a few mo-
ments. I think both of my colleagues 
who are here wanting to speak to the 
issues that we are seeing unfold in 
Cuba, maybe a few other matters of im-
portance to them. I certainly appre-
ciate their time. I think they share 
some of the sentiments that I am shar-
ing. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. BABIN). 
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman so much for having the 
Special Order on freedom, on liberty, 
on constitutionalism, and our God- 
given rights. 
Thank you for what you have said 
there, Mr. ROY. 
Madam Speaker, I am here tonight to 
highlight and amplify the miraculous 
events that have happened less than 100 
miles from U.S. soil on the island of 
Cuba, news that, sadly, we haven’t 
heard nearly enough about. 
After more than 60 years of oppres-
sion, injustice, and fear under a Com-
munist Party that enjoys opulent 
privileges while others struggle just to 
survive, Cubans took to the streets 
shouting: ‘‘Liberty’’ and ‘‘Down with 
communism.’’ 
And this wasn’t just in Havana and 
the big cities. Renewed calls for free-
dom were all across small villages and 
towns in the Cuban countryside. 
These brave protestors, many of 
them young people, knew their appeals 
would be met with violence. They un-
derstood that they would be putting 
themselves and their families at grave 
risk. They knew they would be labeled 
enemies of the state, enemies of the 
revolution, and they would be arrested 
or potentially even murdered. 
Today, I would like to let each of my 
liberty-loving Cuban brothers and sis-
ters out there know that we hear you. 
I commend your astounding courage, 
your thirst for freedom, and your de-
sire for true justice in Cuba. 
We, as Americans, have a moral re-
sponsibility to support these protests 
of Cuba’s cruel Communist regime. 
How can we continue to be ‘‘the shin-
ing city upon a hill,’’ as President 
Reagan once eloquently said, if we do 
not help those who are seeking the 
same divine right that our ancestors 
fought and died for in the Revolution, 
the same rights that our Heavenly Fa-
ther intended for all people? 
I think it is time for the reign of dic-
tatorship and terror to come to an end 
and for freedom and for liberty to take 
their rightful place. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Texas, my friend, 
for his words, and I am going to yield 
to the gentleman from California here 
in just a moment. 
I would ask one question to the gen-
tleman from Texas, and I will repeat 
that question to my friend from Cali-
fornia. 
I share your enthusiasm and commit-
ment for wanting to help the people of 
Cuba who are seeking freedom and ob-
viously have been living under the 
thumb of tyranny for far too long. 
I was chief of staff to Senator TED 
CRUZ. His father is a dear friend, and he 
knew all too well what life was like 
under that murderous regime. 
Our friend and our colleague, Alex 
Mooney, his wonderful mother, simi-
larly, at the same rough timeframe, 
was subjected to the horrors of Cuba in 
that time in the late fifties, early six-
ties, and then came to the United 
States. 
But I would ask my friend, that as we 
watch these individuals from Cuba 
seeking freedom—and God bless them; 
we need to support them—and/or seek-
ing to come to the United States seek-
ing freedom, do you believe that our 
country is itself upholding and adher-
ing to the ideals that they are seeking? 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman. 
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, at this 
time, I cannot answer in the affirma-
tive. I think our country is under grave 
attack, our liberties, our freedoms, our 
constitutional 
rights, 
the 
Bill 
of 
Rights, the very reasons that Samuel 
Adams and Dr. Joseph Warren, and all 
of those Founders, like John Hancock, 
who started the movement that cul-
minated in the Revolutionary War and 
got us out from under the yoke of 
Great Britain. 
I will say this: I think what we are 
seeing today is, quite frankly, a star-
tling, unbelievable change of events 
that I never thought that I would see 
in my entire lifetime, the assault on 
our God-given rights that we are seeing 
today. 
What Mr. ROY just said about draft-
ing our daughters and what he just 
mentioned and listening to our friends 
across the aisle over there talking 
about the unfairness and the racism 
that is incumbent and inherently in 
our election processes, their solution 
would be an absolute violation of the 
U.S. Constitution. 
I think it goes without saying that if 
you have to show an I.D. to get into 
the White House or to get a loan or to 
do anything, really, of any kind of na-
ture as far as that is concerned, that 
we have to have the ability to ask for 
a photo I.D. to ascertain whether you 
are, indeed, that person that you are 
actually professing to be when you 
come in and cast that vote. 
So we hear a lot of talk. But I will 
tell you, it is just talk. When you talk 
about freedom and liberties, we have to 
follow the Constitution and God’s law. 
That is what it has to be. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my friend from Texas. I will yield to 
my friend in California in a moment. 
I couldn’t agree more with respect to 
the current situation we find ourselves 
and our country in. A country where 
we are now talking about vaccine pass-
ports, where we are talking about div-
ing into the private affairs of American 
citizens in the alleged name of health 
and welfare of the people, we are for-
getting that fundamental, core liberty 
of being free from government coer-
cion. 
When you go look at the Constitu-
tion and when we talk about the Presi-
dent of the United States talking about 
going door to door—and I know it

might have been a rhetorical state-
ment, but you never really know. But 
when the Constitution contemplates 
going door to door, it does so only in a 
couple of contexts: the Census, and 
then protecting individuals against it, 
by, in the Third Amendment, pre-
venting the quartering of troops in the 
homes of American people; by pre-
venting, through the Fourth Amend-
ment, unreasonable search and seizure. 
That is what was on the minds of the 
Founders. That was why the Constitu-
tion was structured the way it was 
structured. It wasn’t to empower gov-
ernment in the name of something sup-
posedly 
greater, 
in 
the 
‘‘common 
good.’’ How many hundreds of millions 
of people in this world have been 
slaughtered in the name of the com-
mon good? How many? 
b 2140 
Let’s ask the people of Cuba. Let’s 
ask the people of Cuba, seeking free-
dom, seeking to either come to the 
United States or have the kind of free-
dom that they believe exists in the 
United States, and have that in Cuba, 
whether we should be empowering gov-
ernment, supposedly in the name of the 
good or the common good of the people. 
Our Constitution exists to protect 
and preserve liberty. That is what it 
exists for. That is what this country 
was founded upon; a belief in the Al-
mighty and a belief in liberty. And we 
are tearing that apart by the thread. 
Every single day we are tearing that 
apart by the thread. 
Even as people today right now want 
to have a business, be able to employ 
people. They can’t, because they are 
told by some bright-eyed leftist: Don’t 
worry, just pay them more money. 
Without any concept of what that does 
to a bottom line. Without any concept 
what that does to an income state-
ment, being able to actually raise 
money, risk capital, put their name on 
the line, borrow, and then hire people 
to engage in the business of their 
dream. 
Maybe they inherited it from their 
family, their parents, their great- 
grandparents. What do we do? We just 
say: Don’t worry about it, pay them $15 
an hour. Like there is some magic fairy 
dust that tells people what the wage 
ought to be. 
We destroy businesses in the name of 
being nice to people. You know what it 
does? It limits the numbers of jobs, 
drives up the prices of goods, causes 
people not to have jobs, causes people 
not to be able to get the job, and then 
be able to afford whatever it is they 
want to buy. All because somebody 
said, Oh, gee, I have got a magic num-
ber, $15 an hour. 
Why not $20? Why not $50? I mean, if 
we are going to be all generous, hell, 
just make it $1,000 an hour. Oh, no, 
CHIP, that is just crazy talk. 
Child tax credits, why stop at $300? 
Modern monetary theory, just spend 
whatever you want to. Why not make 
it $30,000? Man, then everybody would 
be doing great. 
My colleagues don’t ever want to ac-
tually sit down and actually put pen to 
paper and figure out what in the heck 
can we actually afford as a country and 
what are we doing to the dignity of 
work? What are we doing to the Amer-
ican family? And what are we doing to 
freedom and the ability of the indi-
vidual to prosper according to his or 
her hard work and according to what 
he or she wants to accomplish in their 
faith and what they want to put in, the 
toil they want to put in their life? 
We are ripping that apart. We are rip-
ping it apart in the name of compas-
sion. Just like we are ripping apart the 
lives of migrants in the name of com-
passion, who are getting absolutely 
decimated by cartels. We do it and we 
say: Oh, look at us, how nice we are; 
when the little 7-year-old girl is sold 
into the sex trafficking trade because 
we put them in the hands of violent 
cartels along the border of Texas. 
Does anybody care about the num-
bers? Does anybody look at what is ac-
tually happening down at the border? I 
know, there he goes again, there goes 
that crazy CHIP ROY talking about the 
border again. Talk to my constituents. 
Talk to the people of Texas, who are 
getting absolutely crushed. 
The numbers are astounding. We are 
not just talking about people and the 
problems that we are having with 
ranchers, and we are talking about the 
sex and human trafficking trade. 
Right here we see the encounters by 
month. We have never seen anything 
like this. When Jeh Johnson headed up 
the Department of Homeland Security 
under President Obama, he said a thou-
sand a month was a crisis. I was just 
looking at the numbers. We had a few 
thousand in a day just last week in the 
McAllen sector. We had 20,000 a week. 
We had a few thousand in a day in the 
Laredo sector, a few thousand a day in 
the McAllen sector. 
We have had, I think—this is from 
memory—70 Border Patrol agents get 
COVID in the last month. We had 20 in 
Laredo. 
All of this is happening in real time. 
All while the administration talks 
about unwinding title 42 and not wor-
rying about what is happening at our 
southern border while telling us and 
preaching to us about vaccine pass-
ports. Oh, no, you better go mask up 
again. 
Fentanyl. Right down here, fentanyl, 
2021 versus 2020 fentanyl numbers. We 
are bringing in a thousand pounds of 
fentanyl in a month. A thousand 
pounds of fentanyl in a month. That is 
enough to kill millions of people. But 
that is happening right now. Nobody 
seems to care on the other side of the 
aisle. They say: Oh, don’t worry, it is 
just fentanyl. No problem to see here. 
Would you say that to my con-
stituent who died with a valium laced 
with fentanyl recently? This is hap-
pening across the country. We are now 
at 92,000 or so opioid deaths in this 
country. I will come back to that in a 
minute, because I want to yield to my 
friend from California. But that is 
what we are facing. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. LAMALFA). 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate both my colleagues from 
Texas and the spirited debate here. 
You know, I hadn’t intended to talk 
about the draft there, but Mr. ROY was 
bringing that up very vigorously. I 
have to agree 100 percent that our vol-
unteer military has worked pretty well 
for us for approximately, I think, 40 
years. 
What is it that would have anybody 
even institute the idea of draft for men 
or women, incredibly, at this point? Is 
it because our numbers are down? Is it 
because we are not getting the people 
in or is it somehow some kind of eq-
uity? 
I am not sure what the mind set is, 
but if you want to inspire people to be 
part of our military, why don’t you 
make it inspiring instead of a bastion 
of political correctness and the woke 
racism conversations happening every-
where else where even a member of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff is bringing it up 
and bringing this literature out that is 
supposed to make people feel bad about 
serving as brothers in arms in the mili-
tary, you know, because of their race. 
If you want to inspire people, don’t 
make them feel bad about joining. 
Therefore, you don’t even have to talk 
about draft, because you could get 
folks who want an opportunity, wheth-
er it is their dedication to completely 
serving their country or they see some 
opportunities there with the education 
that can be offered through the pro-
gram with the military. Whatever the 
combination is, you inspire people to 
be part of it, just as if you are selling 
a product anywhere else in the free 
market in this country. 
Why in the world would we do this 
political correctness, this continued 
race conversation that is driving peo-
ple away? I don’t understand. 
Mr. ROY. Would the gentleman yield 
for just one second? 
Mr. LAMALFA. Sure. 
Mr. ROY. Would it surprise the gen-
tleman to learn that I share his con-
cern about the state of the United 
States military, given the politically 
correct nature of the current leader-
ship? 
I just met with a bunch of parents of 
the individuals that I have nominated 
to go to the academies, and these par-
ents are beside themselves. They are 
saying, please, can you stop this? It is 
going to endanger my kids who are 
going to go serve their country at the 
academies because they hear the facts. 
They see that the U.S. Special Forces 
hired their first chief diversity officer; 
that the Department of Defense just 
hired a chief diversity officer; that a 
Space Force guardian was fired for say-
ing the ‘‘diversity, inclusion, and eq-
uity industry and the trainings we’re 
receiving in the military via that in-
dustry are rooted in critical race the-
ory which is rooted in Marxism.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3904 
July 26, 2021 
This isn’t just embarrassing and un- 
American. It is making us weak. Our 
diplomats are apologizing to the Chi-
nese Communist Party for racism when 
Beijing 
is 
running 
concentration 
camps. This is the reality of what we 
are doing to our military, where we are 
running ads talking about LGBTQ 
issues instead of actually just recruit-
ing warriors to go defend the United 
States of America. I yield to the gen-
tleman. 
Mr. LAMALFA. It is a pretty clear 
defined mission what our military is 
supposed to be doing in protecting our 
shores. We have certainly strayed very 
far from that. As I mentioned, it is not 
inspiring the best, the brightest, the 
toughest to come in. 
I have had some of these conversa-
tions with the parents and some of the 
people already in the military here. A 
young man just the other day, during 
the 4th of July, of all things, I said, 
‘‘What do you think of what is going 
on?’’ This young man is very, very 
gravely concerned, because by far there 
are a lot of great, great young people 
there. They are standing up for their 
flag, for their country, and they are 
wondering what is going on with their 
leadership. 
Indeed, if we want to be at the point 
of the type of readiness that is even 
more acute than ever right now in this 
world with China, China is just wait-
ing. China is probably over there 
laughing at us right now with what is 
going on with this administration and 
the priorities for our military. Russia 
is poised to continue to do more ag-
gression in their zones over there. And 
let alone an unstable place like Iran 
and even North Korea. What is it they 
can do or be capable of doing? Now 
with this pullout in Afghanistan, what 
are we unleashing there? 
We have got to return to a common-
sense approach that goes back to what 
the true military role and duty and 
mission is, and we are drifting far from 
it. 
b 2150 
What I wanted to pick up on, too, as 
far as when we were talking about our 
border, immigration, in general, and 
this recent topic of with Cuba. 
What do we learn from 60-plus years 
of oppression under Castro and those 
who 
followed? 
Maybe 
everything 
wasn’t beautiful under Batista back in 
1959 or what have you, but they cer-
tainly, when they had that revolution 
then, I don’t think the regular, normal, 
good people of Cuba bargained for what 
they have had at all for the last 60 
years. 
The way this administration is han-
dling it is almost basically ignoring it. 
Look at the people in Cuba who are 
holding our flag, not unlike in Hong 
Kong. It is very interesting. The ques-
tion the gentleman posed to my col-
league, maybe he wants to pose it 
again here, but when we are going in 
the direction of where Cuba is, where 
the Communist Chinese Party is going, 
we are holding up pictures of Che 
Guevara. Even in this Chamber we hear 
the type of sympathy towards the Cas-
tro era. It is unbelievable to me how 
this has been allowed to happen. 
Well, part of it, I guess, is the Amer-
ican public isn’t paying enough atten-
tion. You need to demand more or de-
mand better of who you are electing 
and compare this, contrast it with 
what hasn’t worked around the world 
under communism for many decades. 
So with Cuba, you have a situation 
where this administration is ignoring 
those who are seeking asylum from a 
Communist regime for years and years. 
We have a lot of good Cuban people 
who have come to this country years 
ago—they even trickle in now—col-
leagues that Mr. ROY had mentioned 
here that some were in this Chamber of 
Cuban descent. They love this country 
and see the opportunity here. That is 
why they cobble together these boats 
and rafts. I would like to say they are 
made basically made out of milk car-
tons. They coming toward us. 
We don’t see these people com-
plaining about this country and its flag 
and desecrating its flag cobbling to-
gether milk carton rafts and going to-
ward 
Cuba 
for 
their 
amazing 
healthcare system and their amazing 
education system that we hear people 
on other side of the aisle claiming to be 
the way to go. So what is it? 
What is asylum? When we are grant-
ing it to people coming up illegally 
from Central America, they are not 
seeking the true definition of asylum, 
they 
are 
seeking 
economic 
oppor-
tunity. Do I blame them? No. They live 
in bad conditions down there, but they 
also see this giant green light at our 
border saying: Come on across. Even 
though the laws on the books say ‘‘no’’ 
and we have people hired to patrol the 
border. Instead, they are being focused 
more and directed more to be a wel-
come wagon at the border. What are we 
doing? 
Asylum is defined: ‘‘The protection 
granted by a nation to someone who 
has left their native country as a polit-
ical refugee.’’ 
The people who have been trying to 
and some successfully escaping Cuba 
for 60 years are the perfect definition of 
that. Those are the ones we should be 
looking at, and this administration 
should be looking at finding a way to 
help them. 
Those in Central America who are 
coming here for jobs, we have legisla-
tion to work in that direction to have 
a legal workforce come here, or those 
who are already here illegally, find a 
way to get to legal status under our 
rules, under our laws. 
But, no, this administration is leav-
ing our border wide open, as was men-
tioned. The fentanyl, thousands of 
pounds, how far would that go? And 
where is it landing? The stuff we do 
catch is significant, but the stuff that 
we are not catching up with at the bor-
der, where is it going? Where is it being 
stockpiled? When is that going to come 
out? That is extremely dangerous. Ex-
tremely. 
I like to think that these freedom 
fighters, whether it is Hong Kong or 
other places who are using our flag as 
a symbol of freedom and hope, and the 
one they want to emulate and get to, 
whether it is in their country or maybe 
even come here, and we are going in 
the other direction. It is unbelievable 
to me when we can’t even have our 
Olympians respect our flag; we can’t 
have our soccer team; when we can’t 
have basically the singing of the Na-
tional Anthem or the recitation of our 
flag salute in our schools. 
One of the young men I talk about, 
now in the military, I am really proud 
of that young man. I don’t have au-
thorization to say his name. His first 
name is Grayson. What a great kid. He 
is going to be a real doer in our mili-
tary. He fought to just have his flag sa-
lute done at his high school. It hadn’t 
been done in 40 years, and he had to 
overcome a bureaucracy that said: Oh, 
we don’t know. It might offend some-
body. Oh, we haven’t asked all of the 
teachers. We haven’t asked all of the 
school board. 
This young man took it upon himself 
to petition his fellow students to get 
this done. And I said: If they don’t get 
it done, I will be right there with you 
at 8:30 in the morning. We will do it 
right in the front of the school. Well, 
they got it done. And I am so proud of 
him and what he is going to do. But 
there are many, many Americans like 
that all over this world, serving across 
the world, living here in this country 
that believe in that as well and take 
that pledge. 
Spontaneously, at the baseball game, 
if they are not going to do the National 
Anthem, they spontaneously start it 
themselves. It is pretty amazing. At 
the NHL hockey playoff game in New 
York, those Islander fans stood up and 
joined in with one that was going on, 
and the singer, she actually stood down 
so she could feel that moment. Pretty 
amazing. This still exists in the hearts 
and minds of most Americans in this 
country. 
We will not allow ourselves to be 
beaten down by political correctness, 
critical race theory, and all of these 
other things that aren’t really who we 
are or what is in the hearts of the vast 
majority of the people of this country. 
When we are talking about our bor-
der, it is a sieve, which is a giant prob-
lem. It wasn’t a problem nearly as 
much under President Trump, who was 
trying to solve the issue, but also work 
with those countries and help solve the 
issue within. Instead, it was just open 
season on all of us, on our taxpayers, 
our schools, our healthcare system, 
and even all of the COVID business 
that has been manipulated to a degree 
that Americans really need to question 
how much longer they are going to 
have their freedoms, as was mentioned 
by Mr. ROY: vaccine passports being 
forced upon us. 
In California, they are talking about 
you can’t work in the State as a State

employee unless you get the vaccine, 
or perhaps you can get off the hook by 
getting a test every single week. 
Where are our liberties? If you are 
not concerned about our liberties and 
our basic freedom, you better wake up 
right now because you don’t get them 
back once they have been taken. It is 
much more difficult to get them back 
than what our Founders had laid down 
and all of those buried in Arlington—as 
I drove by in town today—fought to 
preserve. 
We have a job as Americans. I wear 
this tie and suit. I leave my farm every 
week to be a part of it, too, because we 
can’t just sit still anymore. We all 
have to be part of this. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from California for his 
words, and I appreciate the passion and 
the commitment to what the gen-
tleman just shared with not just me 
and with my friend from Texas, but 
with the American people. 
I ask the Speaker how much time I 
have remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Texas has 3 minutes re-
maining. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I appre-
ciate my colleagues for coming down 
and joining me. I would only add this: 
As we sit here and we hear so much 
negativity about what is going on, the 
virus, for example, and vaccines, we 
hear nothing from my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle, but every-
body is stonewalling and so forth. We 
have administered 188 million individ-
uals with the vaccine in this country; 
340 or so million doses. About 57 per-
cent of the total population, about 80 
percent of those over 65 have had two 
shots, 90 percent have had one shot. 
We are well above the vast majority 
of the world in terms of total numbers. 
As a percentage, we are a little bit be-
hind, because we are a large country. 
When you look at what we have actu-
ally accomplished—remember, our col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
who last year were saying: This vac-
cine stuff, that is all fool’s gold. 
We know that is true. We know that 
is what our Vice President said, and a 
lot of our colleagues on the other side 
of the aisle said: Don’t touch the vac-
cine. That is crazy stuff. Well, now, all 
of a sudden it is like: You better go get 
the vaccine. Run and get the vaccine. 
You have to get the vaccine. Get the 
vaccine. 
Okay, I am telling my dad, a polio 
survivor, 78-years old: Go get the vac-
cine, dad. But what if you have natural 
immunity? Should you go get the vac-
cine? What if you are a kid? Should 
you go get the vaccine? Those are ques-
tions, and they are reasonable ques-
tions. 
This government, in its infinite wis-
dom, shut down businesses, shut down 
schools, mandated masks, created all 
sorts of mental health issues, prohib-
ited people from going to get cancer 
screenings and take care of themselves 
and their families, forced elderly cou-
ples who have been married for 40 or 50 
years not to be able to say good-bye 
when one of them was passing away, all 
in the name of the government taking 
care of us. 
In the infinite wisdom of the govern-
ment I should just go run down and 
say: Oh, sure, let me run down and get 
the vaccine when how much money has 
been given to the pharmaceutical com-
panies? How many billions of dollars 
are they getting, and how much do 
they get for the boosters? 
By the way, my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle were going after 
the profitability of the pharmaceutical 
companies at an oversight hearing that 
I was in last year, 2 years ago. 
The bottom line here is: This country 
is a great country filled with great peo-
ple, doing great things, every single 
day, and when this body and this gov-
ernment gets out of the way of the 
American people, they continue to do 
great things. The greatness and the fu-
ture of our country lies with them and 
with the people. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-

NOMINATION OF TODD SUNHWAE KIM 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, this 
week, the Senate will consider the 
nomination of Todd Kim to be Assist-
ant Attorney General for the Justice 
Department’s Environment and Nat-
ural Resources Division, known as 
ENRD. This Division acts as our Na-
tion’s environmental law firm. It leads 
efforts to reduce pollution and protect 
our Nation’s precious national re-
sources by enforcing Federal, civil, and 
criminal environmental laws, including 
the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water 
Act, and hazardous waste laws. At least 
that is what it is designed to do. 
Under the previous President, Donald 
Trump, ENRD took some troubling 
steps 
in 
the 
wrong 
direction. 
It 
prioritized protecting polluters over 
the environment. 
With more than 11⁄2 million acres of 
the United States currently burning in 
a wildfire season that has been greatly 
exacerbated by climate change, we are 
mindful of the critical importance of 
vigorous enforcement of our Nation’s 
environmental laws. 
What the Division needs now is a 
leader who will bring back integrity, 
expertise, and a renewed commitment 
to enforcing our Nation’s environ-
mental and natural resources law. Mr. 
Kim is that leader. In fact, his career 
in environmental law began at ENRD, 
where he worked as a trial attorney. 
During his time with the Division, he 
was awarded the Justice Department’s 
Outstanding Performance Award on 
three separate occasions. As a trial 
lawyer there, he spent 8 years rep-
resenting the United States zealously 
and apolitically under both the Clinton 
and Bush administrations. 
Mr. Kim’s principled leadership in 
that role has earned him praise across 
the ideological spectrum. He has the 
strong support of former ENRD offi-
cials from both parties. Over 80 envi-
ronmental law experts and academics, 
who often don’t agree on many things, 
all believe he is the right person. They 
wrote: ‘‘ENRD deserves one of the na-
tion’s best lawyers at its helm. Todd 
Kim promises to be just such a leader.’’ 
Mr. Kim also has experience leading 
a large legal department. He served as 
the District of Columbia’s first solic-
itor general, a role he held for over a 
decade. 
Additionally, Mr. Kim has received 
support from Asian-American organiza-
tions, including Asian Americans Ad-
vancing Justice and the National Asian 
Pacific American Bar Association. 
His nomination received strong, bi-
partisan support on our committee.

July 26, 2021 
Senators GRASSLEY, GRAHAM, CORNYN, 
and 
TILLIS—joined 
the 
Democratic 
members in advancing his nomination. 
With Mr. Kim leading the ENRD, the 
American people can trust our Nation’s 
public lands and natural resources will 
be protected by a proven expert and an 
accomplished lawyer. I urge my col-
leagues to join me in voting in favor of 
his nomination. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader is recog-
nized. 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
now for years, Republicans and Demo-
crats have spoken about the need to in-
vest more in our Nation’s infrastruc-
ture. We are a country the size of a 
continent. Every State has critical in-
frastructure 
demands, 
bridges 
that 
need repair, railways that need mainte-
nance, sewer systems that desperately 
need expansion and renovation. 
Over a month ago now, a bipartisan 
group of Senators announced a deal 
with the White House on a framework 
for a bipartisan infrastructure bill—a 
breakthrough moment. Ever since, I 
have committed both publicly and pri-
vately to put that bill on the Senate 
floor. 
Unfortunately, last week, our Repub-
lican colleagues prevented the Senate 
from taking a procedural step to begin 
the debate. But I want to be very clear. 
I am fully committed to passing a bi-
partisan infrastructure bill. 
As majority leader, I have the ability 
to move to reconsider the vote to begin 
debate on that bill this week. Since 
Senators are still finalizing the text of 
the agreement, Senators should be on 
notice that the Senate may stay in ses-
sion through the weekend in order to 
finish the bill. 
Let me say that again. Senators 
should be on notice that the Senate 
may stay in session through the week-
end in order to finish the bipartisan in-
frastructure bill. 
As I have said before, further delays 
may mean that the Senate will remain 
in session into the previously sched-
uled August recess. 
We have reached a critical moment. 
The bipartisan group of Senators has 
had nearly 5 weeks of negotiations 
since they first announced an agree-
ment with President Biden. It is time 
for everyone to get to ‘‘yes’’ and 
produce an outcome for the American 
people. 
I understand that bipartisan achieve-
ments are difficult in our polarized 
times. Extreme partisans are always 
rooting for failure. Look no further 
than the former President. 
Just this morning, former President 
Trump released a statement urging Re-
publicans to retreat from all bipartisan 
negotiations on infrastructure until 
after the midterm elections in 2022, 
maybe longer. Again, the former Presi-
dent said this morning that Repub-
licans are ‘‘weak fools and losers’’—his 
words—for even talking to Democrats 
and suggested that the Republicans 
should not negotiate at all unless they 
are in the majority. FOX News person-
alities, following his lead, are now en-
couraging primaries for Republican 
Senators who support a bipartisan in-
frastructure deal. 
Look, there are always going to be 
radical voices on the far right who 
brook no compromise, but that is only 
a recipe for obstruction and gridlock. 
We have the opportunity right now to 
actually accomplish something good 
for the American people. 
Will our Republican colleagues follow 
the absurd demands of the disgraced 
former President and his media allies, 
or will they get a good, bipartisan deal 
over the finish line? Republican Sen-
ators must ignore former President 
Trump if we are ever going to make 
progress with the American people. He 
is rooting for our entire political sys-
tem to fail. I and the rest of my Demo-
cratic colleagues are rooting for a deal. 
NOMINATIONS 
Madam President, now on nomina-
tions, the Senate will not remain idle 
in the meantime. This week, we will 
consider several highly qualified nomi-
nees to the Biden administration. To-
night, the Senate will invoke cloture 
on Todd Kim—someone the Senator 
from Illinois has just spoken about—to 
serve as the Assistant Attorney Gen-
eral and the head of the Environment 
and Natural Resources Division of the 
Justice Department, where he worked 
as a lawyer for nearly 8 years. 
The son of Korean immigrants, Mr. 
Kim fell in love with America’s natural 
treasures at a young age, when his par-
ents took him on an RV trip across the 
American West. After tonight, he will 
be in a position to defend those very 
treasures by making sure our environ-
mental laws are enforced, our Federal 
lands are maintained, and our relation-
ship with Native Tribes is respected. 
I look forward to confirming his 
nomination. 
Senators should also be aware there 
may be additional votes on nomina-
tions this week, including members of 
the National Labor Relations Board 
and potentially votes to advance nomi-
nees from our Senate committees. 
The Senate has a constitutional duty 
to advise and consent on Presidential 
appointments. We will continue that 
important work this week. 
I yield the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority whip. 
Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous con-
sent to speak as if in morning business. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I 
want to back up what the majority 
leader said. The day was May 22, 2019. I 
remember it well. Two things happened 
that morning. First was the birth of 
my granddaughter, which was an excit-
ing and happy event. The second was 
just the opposite. It was a meeting in 
the White House with President Donald 
Trump, and the purpose of the meeting 
was to discuss infrastructure. 
You see, we had an earlier meeting. 
Democrats met with the leaders of the 
Trump administration to discuss an in-
frastructure bill. When we suggested 
$1.5 trillion be spent on infrastructure. 
President Trump said: No, make it $2 
trillion. 
Well, we were happy to hear that. 
Then when we suggested that President 
Trump’s earlier suggestion of 80 per-
cent of it being paid on a State and 
local basis rather than Federal, he re-
versed himself. He said it will be 80 per-
cent Federal. More good news. 
Then came the suggestion: Well, it 
shouldn’t just be horizontal infrastruc-
ture. It ought to be vertical infrastruc-
ture—broadband, 
school 
buildings, 
things that we desperately need in 
America. 
And he said: Include them; let’s make 
that part of the package. 
It was one of the best meetings. 
Then came the subject of how we 
were going to pay for it, and President 
Donald Trump said: Stop. I am not 
going to get into that conversation. 
Well, we said: Mr. President, we have 
agreed on what we are going to do, but 
we have to pay for it. 
He said: No, you are not going to trap 
me with raising taxes or doing things 
that are politically unpopular. 
So we postponed this follow-up meet-
ing to this May 22 date—May 22, 2019. 
We were anxious to get it done because, 
during his Presidency, there had been 
no 
infrastructure 
programs—none, 
nothing—despite his promises to the 
contrary during the campaign. 
We came back May 22. He walked in 
the room and he said to all of us assem-
bled there: As long as you are inves-
tigating me for any reason, there will 
be no infrastructure bill. 
He wheeled around and walked out. 
That was the end of the conversation 
about infrastructure in the Trump ad-
ministration. It was never seriously 
considered or debated after that. 
Now we are engaged in a new exer-
cise. Some Republican Senators—and I 
thank them for their courage and ini-
tiative—want to sit down with Demo-
crats and see if we can finally, after 
years and years, come up with an infra-
structure bill to rebuild America. 
They are under pressure. They are 
under pressure from Senator MCCON-
NELL. He didn’t want them to engage in 
this kind of bipartisan negotiation. 
And now, today, former President 
Trump has joined the chorus, saying 
they shouldn’t bargain at all with 
Democrats. Put it off another year, 2 
years, whatever it has to be, until the 
Republicans control the whole process. 
That is a recipe for achieving little or 
nothing. We know that. 
So I sincerely hope that this week 
will be a breakthrough week. Senator 
SCHUMER, the Democratic majority 
leader, tried to get it started last week 
with a simple procedural vote that 
would move us to this conversation,

but he was unlucky and was unable to 
get that done, but he has maintained 
the procedural option of reconsidering 
that vote. I certainly hope that will 
happen soon. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Madam President, on a separate 
issue, we are at a pivotal moment in 
the fight against COVID–19. Thanks to 
the leadership of this administration, 
our Nation has had one of the most 
successful vaccination efforts in the 
world: 340 million doses of COVID–19 
vaccines have been administered in the 
United States, 80 percent of Americans 
over the age of 65 have been fully vac-
cinated—80 percent. That means the 
vast majority of our senior population 
is protected from being hospitalized or 
dying from COVID–19. 
Yet, at this moment, there is trouble 
on the horizon. Case numbers across 
the country are ticking back up. It is 
important to note why. The Delta vari-
ant is spreading like wildfire among 
unvaccinated people. I have heard 
quotes from some that it is a thousand 
times more transmissible than the 
original COVID–19. And it has quickly 
become the dominant strain of this 
virus in America. 
There is good news. The vaccines 
that we all have access to right now 
will stop the Delta variant in its 
tracks. They will save your life. With 
the spread of the Delta variant, the re-
ality for Americans is quickly becom-
ing: Get vaccinated or risk contracting 
a serious or deadly case of COVID–19. 
As Dr. Walensky, the Director of the 
CDC, said last week—and I quote her— 
‘‘this is quickly becoming a pandemic 
of the unvaccinated.’’ 
Over the past week, we have started 
to see a renewed sense of urgency from 
my colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle. 
They 
finally—finally—become 
more 
vocal 
about 
dispelling 
disinformation 
about 
the 
vaccines. 
Even FOX News has begun airing pub-
lic service announcements and encour-
aging viewers to get vaccinated against 
the coronavirus. I applaud them for 
starting to join the chorus of scientific 
experts, health officials, and commu-
nity leaders who have been calling on 
Americans to protect themselves and 
their loved ones, because it was only a 
few weeks ago when a couple prime- 
time hosts on FOX expressed their dis-
pleasure with me personally. 
I was alarmed, and said so on the 
floor of the Senate, by some of the 
ideas that Tucker Carlson and Laura 
Ingraham were pedaling. Their anti- 
vax rhetoric, quite simply, put their 
viewers and the families of their view-
ers at risk. We can disagree on political 
issues, and I am sure we will continue 
to do so, but we shouldn’t play polit-
ical games with life and death when it 
comes to COVID–19 vaccines. 
We have seen a shift in tone recently. 
Some hosts on FOX, specifically Sean 
Hannity and Steve Doocy, now encour-
age their viewers to get vaccinated. At 
the very least, they call on them to 
consult with their doctors. It is a move 
in the right direction, but we ought to 
make it clear once and for all publicly, 
where we can, that those who are 
spreading this anti-vax rhetoric are lit-
erally risking the lives of our fellow 
Americans. 
We are seeing the good that comes 
from sharing the facts about vaccines 
and potential to save lives. As of yes-
terday, the 7-day average of newly vac-
cinated Americans is up nearly over 
one-third from last year week. Nearly 7 
in 10 American adults have one dose of 
COVID vaccine. We need to keep it up. 
More than 610,000 of our family mem-
bers and friends and neighbors in 
America have died from this disease— 
and millions more around the world. 
We have the power within our hands, 
with vaccines, to stop this pandemic. 
We all have to do our part. 
I want to take an opportunity to rec-
ognize something else. Disinformation 
is not the only reason why people are 
not getting vaccinated. Sadly, there is 
a long history of racial bias in our Na-
tion’s institutions, from education to 
housing, to healthcare. That history of 
racial bias has, understandably, led 
some Americans to question our insti-
tutions based on fear. 
Let me first say this: Trust has to be 
earned. 
We have a lot of work to do as a na-
tion to address racial inequities in our 
healthcare system, like the fact that 
Black women are three times more 
likely than White women to die from 
pregnancy-related complications. Ac-
knowledging these inequities, doing 
something about them, is how we can 
build and regain trust. That is the 
work we have to do. 
President Biden’s American Rescue 
Plan was an important investment in 
tackling 
health 
disparities. 
It 
in-
creased funding for community out-
reach, expanded support for commu-
nity health centers. It provided a $1 
billion investment in the National 
Health Service Corps to help recruit 
more doctors, nurses, and other health 
professionals 
from 
communities 
of 
color. That was a provision that I 
added to the bill. 
At this moment, if you are still 
unvaccinated against COVID–19 and 
you have questions, reach out to a 
medical professional that you trust. 
Talk with your doctor, ask them what-
ever questions you wish, but make sure 
you have the facts on your side, be-
cause the sad truth is the pandemic has 
deepened the existing racial disparities 
in America. 
Last year, there was nearly a 3-year 
drop in life expectancy among Black 
and Brown Americans—3 years. Com-
munities of color have been three 
times more likely to be hospitalized, 
twice as likely to die from COVID. We 
can end this cycle of sickness and de-
spair, but we have got to stop the 
spread of the new variants. So please 
consult a medical professional and ask 
about getting vaccinated. 
RANSOMWARE 
Madam President, on another issue, a 
committee we both serve on, the Sen-
ate Judiciary Committee, is going to 
have an important hearing tomorrow 
on the issue of ransomware. 
For those who may be unfamiliar, 
ransomware is a type of malicious soft-
ware that can infect a computer. If 
hackers attack your computer system 
with it, they can lock up all the data in 
your system and demand a ransom pay-
ment in exchange for unlocking the 
data. As a product of our digital age, 
ransomware is a relatively new threat, 
but it could impact any individual, 
business, or organization. 
Many Americans had a rude awak-
ening about this threat earlier this 
year, when a cyber crime syndicate 
used ransomware to shut down the 
largest 
petroleum 
pipeline 
in 
the 
United States: the Colonial Pipeline. 
That shutdown sparked a nationwide 
panic that had people lining up at gas 
stations for hours, and it put the 
threat of ransomware into plain view 
for all Americans. Perhaps someone 
you know has had their world turned 
upside down by a ransomware attack. 
Tomorrow, we will discuss it at length. 
GUN VIOLENCE 
Madam President, we begin this week 
with yet another devastating toll of 
weekend gun violence across America, 
including the city of Chicago. More 
than 70 people were shot this past 
weekend in Chicago. Ten died. If you 
remember 2 weeks ago, Fourth of July 
weekend, over 100 people were victims 
of gunshots in Chicago. In that case, 19 
of them died. 
It is a mass killing on a regular basis 
in that great city. Much of it is con-
centrated in sections of the city, but it 
is starting to spread because it is so 
darned easy for a person to get their 
hands on a gun in that city. 
Shootings in Chicago have surged 
during the COVID pandemic. We see it 
happening across America. The Biden 
administration is taking steps in the 
right direction to stop this gun vio-
lence: Cracking down on untraceable 
ghost guns, rogue gun dealers, and 
these braces, this equipment that can 
effectively turn pistols into short-bar-
reled rifles. 
Crucially, the Department of Justice 
announced the launch of five firearm 
trafficking strike forces. Chicago is 
one of the cities. New York; San Fran-
cisco; Washington, DC; and Los Ange-
les, are the others. 
These strike forces will confront 
what I believe to be one of the most 
important causes of this gun violence: 
the illicit trafficking of guns. These 
strike forces will also provide support 
for law enforcement who are on the 
frontlines of fighting gun violence. 
As a testament to that fact, last 
week, Attorney General Garland joined 
me in Chicago to highlight how the 
Justice Department is standing with 
our police officers and first responders. 
I am grateful that Attorney General 
Garland returned to his hometown of 
Chicago for this purpose. But sadly, it 
was a somber homecoming. 
We first met with police officers and 
the mayor of Chicago, Lori Lightfoot,

July 26, 2021 
at the Harrison District police station. 
It is basically ground zero for gun vio-
lence in the city of Chicago. They dem-
onstrated to us the brandnew tech-
nology, the amazing technology, the 
video cameras, the shotspotters, new 
technology which they are using every 
single day to thwart the criminals and 
to prove their cases when necessary. 
These communities and these officers 
are keeping us as safe as they can, but 
they are up against an avalanche of 
guns. 
The grim toll of gun violence in Chi-
cago continues to climb upward. The 
officers agreed with Attorney General 
Garland and myself, a major problem is 
that we have guns being illegally sold 
to people who never should have had 
them, who never would have passed a 
background check, convicted felons or 
those who are mentally unstable. This 
issue is more important and more sig-
nificant than any single jurisdiction. It 
is nationwide. 
Roughly, 60 percent of the guns re-
covered at crime scenes in Chicago 
originate from out of State, primarily 
from Indiana, but also from other 
States. A person can easily buy a gun 
from an unlicensed seller in Indiana 
and drive it to Chicago in a matter of 
minutes that very same day to resell 
that gun on the streets. 
Why don’t we do something about 
this? If those who own guns agree with 
everyone else that we ought to keep 
guns out of the hands of the wrong peo-
ple, why can’t this Congress do that 
simple thing to try to slow down this 
gun violence? 
There is one more truth we must ac-
knowledge: Gun violence isn’t just 
about access to weapons. Too many 
kids in cities like Chicago face daily 
trauma that is making them more like-
ly to fall into the cycle of violence. 
During the Attorney General’s visit 
to Chicago, we joined community lead-
ers at St. Agatha Catholic Church in 
the Lawndale section of the city. They 
have developed a successful violence 
intervention program called READI 
Chicago. It is one of the many commu-
nity violence intervention programs 
that has received financial support 
from this President. 
While meeting with the leaders of 
READI Chicago, I spoke with a young 
man whom I will call John. He is re-
markably brave. After learning his 
story, one cannot ignore the similar-
ities he shares with so many other 
young people in the city. 
He grew up in a struggling family. He 
sold drugs to earn money. Like many 
of his peers, he ended up carrying a gun 
and got involved with gang violence. 
He was arrested, convicted, and served 
time in prison. Then he came back to 
the community and wanted to start a 
different life. That is how he got in-
volved with READI Chicago, where he 
is now a positive force for change in his 
home city. 
It is an inspiring story, but that 
young man John, in his early twenties, 
still remains at risk. He fears that his 
advocacy on behalf of this program has 
put crosshairs on his back in the neigh-
borhood and that his family may even 
be targeted as well. Every street corner 
in his neighborhood, every street he 
crosses, comes with a risk. He has to 
look around constantly to see if the 
gang members are going to target him. 
But still, even under this unimaginable 
stress, John is looking for a new path 
in his life. I asked him what he wanted 
to do. He said he would like to apply to 
attend Chicago State University, which 
is near this area. I hope he can get 
there. And I hope he will be a success, 
but it is amazing that he still has that 
dream after all that he has seen. 
For young people in Chicago like 
him, there is no quick fix. If you grew 
up in a family without stability and se-
curity at home, in school, or in a 
neighborhood, which many of us take 
for granted every day, it can harm 
your development and change the way 
you see the world. The CDC’s landmark 
study on ACEs, adverse childhood expe-
riences, tells us that exposure to trau-
ma is linked to risk of drug use, sui-
cide, academic struggle, and many 
other problems. If you are a young 
child experiencing this chaos, if you 
watch a family member get shot or vio-
lently assaulted, it leaves a scar called 
trauma. Trauma can stay with a child 
for life. 
That is why violence intervention 
programs like READI Chicago are so 
important, connecting these at-risk 
youth with cognitive behavioral ther-
apy, paid transitional jobs, wraparound 
support services, resources that sup-
port the healthy development of chil-
dren who are struggling with trauma. 
These are the resources that will 
change a young person’s life and set 
him on a better path, a path where he 
can discover a passionate calling and, 
ultimately, get back to the commu-
nity. 
We must invest in these long-term 
solutions to break cycles of violence 
and trauma. The bipartisan RISE from 
Trauma Act that I have introduced 
with Senator CAPITO, a Republican 
from West Virginia, and many col-
leagues, is an important step in that 
direction. It would provide $5 billion 
that President Biden has called for in 
his Build Back Better agenda for com-
munity violence intervention. 
We in the Senate need to take imme-
diate steps to combat violent crime. 
Can’t we just get together and agree 
that we don’t want to sell firearms to 
people who are convicted felons? It 
seems so obvious, and there is such 
public support for it. I want my col-
leagues to understand that the problem 
of gun violence isn’t confined to the 
city of Chicago. We have cities that are 
much smaller downstate that are see-
ing an increase in gun violence as well. 
It is time for us to do something about 
it. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The Republican leader is recognized. 
MIKE ENZI 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
this weekend, we received the bad news 
that our friend and former colleague, 
Mike Enzi, was involved in a serious 
accident while riding his bicycle. 
Mike’s colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle were sorry enough to see him de-
part the Chamber and begin his well- 
earned next chapter just a few months 
ago. Mike and Diana were a fantastic 
Senate couple in every respect, from 
major legislative accomplishments to 
the 
generosity 
and 
kindness 
they 
showed to everyone from Senate staff 
to the pages. So I know Members on 
both sides of the aisle are very much 
thinking of Mike at this time. We pray 
for his health and for the entire Enzi 
family. 
DEMOCRATIC AGENDA 
Now, Madam President, on an en-
tirely different matter, American fami-
lies are anxious, and they are uneasy. 
The share of Americans who feels op-
timistic about our country’s direction 
has plummeted by almost 20 percent 
just since the springtime. As recently 
as early May, nearly two-thirds of 
Americans said they were optimistic 
about the direction of the country. 
That was the highest figure that sur-
vey had reported in 14 years, but, alas, 
that has plummeted. Late last week, a 
new survey found that optimism is now 
a minority position as 55 percent of 
Americans are pessimistic. Approval of 
the new administration’s handling of 
COVID–19 has tumbled. Their handling 
of the economy is underwater among 
Independents. Fewer than 4 in 10 Amer-
icans approve of their handling of im-
migration, the border, or violent crime. 
Unfortunately, 
American 
families 
have ample reason to feel this way. The 
end of June clocked the highest annual 
inflation spike in more than a decade. 
The Democrats’ stay-home bonus to 
workers who remain unemployed has 
slowed the recovery and helped to keep 
workforce 
participation 
stagnant. 
Meanwhile, last year, as the far left 
put the squeeze on law enforcement 
funding in cities across the country, 
America faced a 25-percent—25-per-
cent—increase 
in 
homicides. 
Then, 
after the Biden administration was 
very eager to claim ownership and 
spike the football on the vaccination 
trajectory, which they largely inher-
ited from Republican leadership, we 
have now seen vaccination rates in 
many places plateau on what this 
White House has been insisting is their 
watch. 
This turn toward pessimism is espe-
cially stunning and especially sad be-
cause President Biden took office with

July 26, 2021 
the wind at his back. Things were set 
up for a roaring success like no other 
Presidential transition in recent mem-
ory. Thanks, in large part, to Oper-
ation Warp Speed, set up by the prior 
Congress and administration, we had 
multiple safe and effective vaccines 
that were beginning to circulate widely 
through the country. The new adminis-
tration’s so-called ambitious goal of 
about a million vaccines per day was 
already happening before they were 
sworn in. Thanks to the five bipartisan 
rescue packages that the Republican- 
led Senate passed last year, we were 
primed and ready for a historic eco-
nomic comeback. Americans were ex-
cited and ready to build a comeback 
summer for the history books. 
Yet those incredible tailwinds have 
largely been squandered. That historic 
head start has been wasted through bad 
policy and, in many cases, needlessly 
divisive leadership. 
After a poorly targeted partisan 
spending package that even liberal 
economists warned could cause more 
inflation, American families are now 
feeling the pain and literally paying 
the price. After campaign rhetoric and 
then policy decisions that have made 
our southern border less secure, a pre-
dictable crisis is playing out. After a 
year of anti-police and anti-rule-of-law 
rhetoric from too many on the political 
left, a violent crime surge is ham-
mering 
communities 
and 
making 
streets less safe all across our country. 
Oh, and as the new administration 
pulls back America’s presence in the 
Middle East in a reckless and rushed 
fashion, terrorist leaders are simply 
jumping for joy. 
This is how you take a country from 
near-record optimism to serious pes-
simism in just 2-months’ time. This is 
how you inherit favorable trends in 
just about every direction imaginable 
but 
produce 
disappointment. 
Our 
Democratic friends’ big master plan is 
yet another reckless taxing-and-spend-
ing spree but even larger. The Wash-
ington Democrats’ big idea is to bor-
row, print, and spend our way to even 
more inflation and even higher costs 
for American families, along with a 
historic set of big tax hikes to boot. 
My friends across the aisle and down 
Pennsylvania Avenue should be less 
concerned 
about 
checking 
leftwing 
items off activists’ wish lists. As more 
and more of the Democrats’ partisan 
agenda comes online, the American 
people’s pessimism grows and grows. 
The families of our country need a bet-
ter approach. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Madam Presi-
dent, I ask unanimous consent that the 
order for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
DUCKWORTH). Without objection, it is 
so ordered. 
THE ECONOMY 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Madam Presi-
dent, you know, there is an old saying 
that I have used quite often, but it 
bears repeating: Give a man a fish, you 
feed him for a day. Teach a man how to 
fish, and you feed him for a lifetime. 
It is a simple yet insightful concept. 
Human beings often like things to be 
easy. It is just in our nature. But the 
reward for easy is very short-lived. 
Sometimes, if you don’t earn it, you 
don’t understand it. If we work hard 
and challenge ourselves to improve, we 
reap the benefits for much longer. That 
is the American way. 
I would tell this to my players over 
the years that I coached. You know, 
lessons learned that are applied to the 
football field also apply in life. You 
know, this country owes you one thing: 
an opportunity. Sometimes people just 
need to be shown where that oppor-
tunity is at and encouraged to take it, 
and that is what everyone in this body 
should be focused on doing: opening 
doors for opportunity for the people of 
this country. 
President Biden seems determined to 
close those doors of opportunity by cre-
ating, it looks like, a future massive 
entitlement state. 
My Republican colleagues and I have 
talked a lot about the reckless tax-and- 
spend plan and the cost of that plan on 
American families. We are seeing ris-
ing inflation, which means dollars from 
your paycheck are not going as far. We 
are seeing costs rise on everyday goods 
that families need: food, gas, diapers— 
you name it; it is going up. This is a di-
rect result of untargeted spending this 
year as we are trying to recover from a 
pandemic, which is the worst time in 
the world to be throwing government 
money at a pandemic. 
And, now, our Democratic colleagues, 
it looks like, want to spend $3.5 trillion 
more, after spending $1.9 trillion back 
in February. And what gets talked 
about less than the cost of this spend-
ing is the social and societal cost of all 
of these new and expanded programs. 
While it may not be easy to see or 
measure, it is no less important, and 
that is what I want to talk about 
today. 
Let’s remember how this started and 
how we got here. It started with Presi-
dent Biden’s announcing two plans— 
great names. First was the American 
Families Plan, and then there was the 
American Jobs Plan. Despite their con-
fusing and similar names, on the face 
they don’t sound that bad. I am for 
American families, and I am for Amer-
ican jobs. 
These plans are not about American 
families or American jobs. They are 
full of progressive items that can only 
pass the Senate through a reconcili-
ation process. There won’t be any— 
there won’t be any—Republicans that 
will vote for this, and Democrats know 
this. So, now, here we are with our col-
leagues stuffing the worst parts of 
President Biden’s agenda—I am talking 
about the most progressive items that 
only appease the far left of their base— 
into their latest package. And all of 
President Biden’s progressive programs 
cost money, lots and lots of money. 
And they are going to pay for them 
with your taxpayer dollars, not the 
government dollars—taxpayer dollars. 
A lot of my colleagues have expressed 
concern with the Democrats’ tax-and- 
spend spree, but they aren’t the only 
ones sounding the alarm. Folks back 
home have started to take notice, and 
there is a lot more collective wisdom 
among the folks back home than there 
has been here lately in Washington, 
DC. 
So I brought a couple of letters with 
me today. These are folks from Ala-
bama who wrote to me about their con-
cerns with President Biden’s massive 
spending plan. Here is what James 
Merrill from Huntsville, AL, wrote to 
me: 
I have been studying this atrocious ‘‘Biden 
American Families Plan’’ and it is clear that 
not only is the cost staggering, the implica-
tions of all the rules that will go with it will 
terribly impact all family life and our free-
doms to manage our lives. It blatantly 
makes the middle-class dependent on the 
government—cradle to grave. A clear path to 
socialism.’’ 
James, you are exactly right. 
And Rosa Hill in Birmingham, AL, 
had this to say: 
I have just listened to President Biden . . . 
and the ideas are ridiculous. [We] should be 
helping each other, [not] the government 
. . . [getting] involved. 
Ms. HILL makes an important point. 
Much of this work can and should be 
done by our neighbors, churches, and 
people in the communities. The prob-
lem is, we have been conditioned to 
wait for the government to do the hard 
work of helping the less fortunate for 
us rather than doing it ourselves. 
Half a century ago, President Lyndon 
Johnson launched the ‘‘War on Pov-
erty.’’ He and leading liberals at the 
time thought the answer to poverty 
was to dramatically increase the bene-
fits the Federal Government would 
give out to the poor. Well, the War on 
Poverty didn’t work like its backers 
thought it would. The following decade 
was filled with economic stagnation, 
high inflation, gas lines, spikes in drug 
addiction, and a horrifying rise in 
crimes across our country. Sounds fa-
miliar—doesn’t it?—just like what is 
happening today. 
Folks, the definition of insanity is 
trying the same thing over and over 
again expecting a different result. We 
have already tried this. President 
Biden is determined to try the same 
worn out policies today: throwing tril-
lions and trillions of taxpayer money 
at the problem and hoping the problem 
goes away. It has been and still is the 
wrong solution. 
President Biden’s reckless spending 
spree won’t help struggling American 
families. It will trap them in the end-
less cycle of dependence on Big Govern-
ment and taxpayer money. Just take a 
look at what President Biden has pro-
posed in his American Families Plan:

government-subsidized childcare, free 
preschool, 
free 
community 
college. 
Free, free, free; that seems to be the 
slogan of this administration. 
Of course, we all know that there is 
no such thing as free in this country. I 
have talked before about the fact that 
President Biden has proposed 30—you 
heard me right, 30—new taxes that the 
Democrats can choose from to pay for 
these free programs in their next 
spending package—30 new taxes during 
a pandemic. 
According to one analysis by the 
Hoover Institution, President Biden’s 
American Families Plan would add 21 
million Americans to the Federal Gov-
ernment’s list of beneficiaries—21—21 
million more people living off the gov-
ernment. Now, there are certainly peo-
ple out there who need help. We all 
know that. But this plan opens the 
floodgates to taxpayer-funded benefits 
instead of concentrating on those who 
mostly 
need 
it. 
Under 
President 
Biden’s plan, your family could make 
up to $200,000 and still qualify for Fed-
eral healthcare—$200,000. 
We don’t have to comb through the 
history books for examples on how 
these progressive policies fail. We don’t 
have to look far. Just look at what we 
have done here recently and the insist-
ence on keeping unemployment bene-
fits historically high. 
My Republican colleagues and I have 
spoken about how these misguided ben-
efits essentially paid people not to 
work, destroying small businesses all 
over the country, and our economy’s 
progress has gone down as we try to re-
cover from this pandemic. 
Republican 
Governors 
across 
the 
country recognized the problem and de-
cided to cut out the overly generous 
benefits months ago. Folks who needed 
help would get it, but they wouldn’t be 
paid to sit at home, and then they 
wouldn’t be sitting home when they 
could have been working at jobs that 
would help their family. Just about 
every Democratic Governor has in-
sisted on keeping these benefits. Now, 
what does that tell you, insisting on 
keeping the benefits and not keeping 
the benefits? 
We have made some terrible deci-
sions just in a short period of time. 
Well, we can already see the results of 
what is happening with these benefits. 
According to the monthly data from 
the Bureau of Labor Statistics, States 
that cut the Federal expanded benefit 
are closer to returning to prepandemic 
employment levels than the States 
that kept them. Thirteen of the top 15 
States with the best unemployment 
numbers have all ended their Federal 
expanded unemployment insurance. 
Why don’t we learn from this mis-
guided policy and not repeat it by 
spending money on bad outcomes? We 
seem to continue to do that every time 
we turn around. 
The reckless tax-and-spend spree to 
advance President Biden’s progressive 
agenda isn’t just unaffordable; it is un- 
American. 
The 
United 
States 
was 
founded on the ideas of personal liberty 
and self-reliance. It makes you feel 
good about yourself earning your own 
way, not government handouts best 
known as socialism. 
Since our founding, people have 
flocked to the United States because of 
the opportunity it gives citizens to suc-
ceed, not because of cushy government 
handouts. Our society valued and val-
ues hard work, grit, and determination 
more than the countries most of these 
folks have left behind. 
Again, this country owes you one 
thing and that is an opportunity to 
succeed through education and hard 
work. Democrats want you to believe 
that you can only succeed with the 
government’s help. Republicans believe 
in self-reliance and that you have with-
in you God-given skills and potential 
to work hard and succeed. You have 
that. That is what this country gives 
you, which is why President Biden’s 
reckless spending spree and expansion 
of government programs is so, so dis-
appointing. 
The President and Democrats think 
success is measured by how much tax-
payer 
money 
the 
government 
can 
spend, but real success is measured by 
how many people no longer need the 
help in the first place. Our efforts need 
to empower people to be free to live 
and work to build a better life for 
themselves and their families. The 
most successful anti-poverty program 
should eventually put itself out of busi-
ness. 
So I say, enough. Enough of continu-
ously growing the Federal Govern-
ment. Enough of the reckless taxpayer- 
funded spending sprees. Enough of 
trapping people in a cycle of depend-
ence, because a culture of dependency 
is a culture in decline. 
I say we work together to encourage 
people to seize the many opportunities 
in our country, not have them wait 
around hoping the government will fix 
every problem life throws their way. 
We can’t do that. It is long past time 
we get back to teaching folks to fish, 
to learn to fish themselves, to be self- 
reliant. That is a culture of hard work 
and resilience. That is a culture of the 
United States of America, the best 
country on the face of the Earth. 
Madam President, I suggest the ab-
sence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, I ask unanimous consent that the 
order for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CHINA 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, this has already been a big week 
in Tokyo for Team USA, and I hope all 
of my colleagues have the opportunity 
to watch a few minutes of the Olympic 
Games over the next few weeks. 
Every year, we hear so much from 
commentators and athletes about how 
the Games are an opportunity for the 
world to come together, and that is ex-
actly how it once was. Unfortunately, 
the Olympics are also a target-rich en-
vironment for people and regimes that 
want to use these rare moments of 
unity to trick the world into ignoring 
evil. 
Before we were able to enjoy any of 
this year’s double-pike vaults or 400- 
meter freestyle swims, we were already 
worrying about the impending havoc 
casting a shadow over the 2022 Beijing 
Winter Olympics. 
Late last year, the Chinese Govern-
ment began pilot testing a new digital 
currency that will inevitably knock 
other domestic mobile payment sys-
tems out of the marketplace. 
The digital yuan trial has already 
pulled in $5.3 billion—that is correct, 
$5.3 billion—in transactions, and this 
month we learned that cross-border 
payments are also on the table. In fact, 
the trial has been so successful that 
Beijing wants to expand testing at the 
2022 Winter Olympics. 
Now, as much as I would like to be-
lieve that this is an innocent effort to 
bring the world a little closer together, 
this is the Chinese Communist Party 
that we are talking about, and we 
shouldn’t expect good faith because 
that is not what we are going to get 
from the CCP. We have reason to be-
lieve that the Chinese Government in-
tends to use the digital yuan to con-
duct a massive surveillance operation 
on Chinese citizens and foreign visi-
tors. 
It wouldn’t be the first time some-
thing like this happened. The CCP has 
an unfortunate history of weaponizing 
emerging technologies against people 
they would like to control. They used 
it against the Uighurs, against freedom 
fighters in Hong Kong, and on the 
mainland against anyone who ques-
tions their party propaganda. 
They are already using digital pay-
ment platforms to spy on their own 
people; and if we are not careful, they 
are going to use them to spy on Team 
USA. 
This month, I sent a letter to the 
U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee 
asking them to forbid our athletes 
from accepting or using the digital 
yuan while competing in Beijing. 
The threats are changing, and far too 
often we see our allies and partners and 
even our own government ignoring 
those threats to preserve the status 
quo. 
You may be asking yourself: Why is 
so much of the world willing to look 
the other way when confronted with 
genocide in Xinjiang or murdered pro-
testers in Hong Kong? 
It is because speaking up can be dan-
gerous, especially when it comes to 
challenging the CCP. 
China boasts the most in-demand 
market in the world. In fact, it is such 
a gold mine that you will recall the 
NBA ignored large-scale child abuse at 
its training camps in China just to 
maintain access to broadcast adver-
tising and merchandise revenue.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5065 
July 26, 2021 
Through the Belt and Road Initia-
tive, the Chinese Communist Party has 
sunk its teeth into some of the most 
valuable tourist destinations on the 
face of the Earth, on trade route, and 
strategic outposts. 
They have sold this program as an 
economic development initiative, but 
in reality this debt-trap diplomacy is 
really just an extortion scheme. Once 
these countries fall into the trap, it is 
almost impossible to escape. 
Even before the pandemic forced the 
United States into lockdown, I and sev-
eral other of my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle were ringing alarm 
bells about our supply chain security. 
China is the most dominant global 
source of rare Earth minerals, tech-
nology infrastructure, and many active 
pharmaceutical ingredients. 
Long story short, there is a lot on 
the line for the people of the United 
States. The cards are stacked against 
us. 
It would be really easy to protect 
that valuable status quo by ignoring 
human rights violations and extortion 
schemes and other overt attempts to 
make the world a little less free. But as 
much as we would like it to be, free-
dom is not humanity’s natural state. It 
is fragile. It falls victim to the weak 
and the power hungry alike, and, if we 
are not careful, yes, it will slip away, 
like it has in so many other countries. 
Freedom does have to be fought for, 
and we need our leaders to set the ex-
ample. That means staying focused on 
not following the example of countries 
that have given up their freedom. We 
don’t want to live out the authori-
tarian nightmare that the CCP has cre-
ated, but we also want to avoid becom-
ing like nations that have already 
pawned their futures in pursuit of some 
grand socialist future. 
I fear that our new majority has al-
ready lost touch with what the Amer-
ican people actually want. They sure 
don’t want what the Biden administra-
tion has been selling lately. I can defi-
nitely tell you that after a weekend in 
Tennessee. They don’t feel taken care 
of. What they are feeling is that they 
are being manipulated. 
They want to know why President 
Biden and the Democratic majority 
keep trying to pawn off the freedom 
that makes us an example to the rest 
of the world in exchange for more gov-
ernment control that nobody asked for. 
I would encourage my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle to remember 
that the American people entrusted 
them with the power that they are 
wasting on these radical wish lists 
items, and that power can be taken 
away just as easily as it was given. 
The American people want to make 
certain that we do as Ronald Reagan 
implored us to remember. And, Madam 
President, as you know, last week I 
had that poster here on the floor. Free-
dom is always one generation away 
from extinction. It is our responsibility 
to fight for it, to pass it on. 
I yield the floor.

NOMINATIONS OF HELAINE ANN 
GREENFELD AND CHRISTOPHER 
H. SCHROEDER 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I in-
tend to object to any unanimous con-
sent request relating to the nomina-
tion of Helaine Ann Greenfeld, to be an 
Assistant Attorney General at the De-
partment of Justice, PN459, and Chris-
topher H. Schroeder, to be an Assistant 
Attorney General at the Department of 
Justice, PN370. 
Last week, at the Senate Judiciary 
Committee’s executive business meet-
ing, I noted my intent to vote for both 
nominees but object to any unanimous 
consent request for their confirmation. 
Ms. Greenfeld will lead the Justice De-
partment’s Office of Legislative Affairs 
and Mr. Schroeder will lead the Justice 
Department’s Office of Legal Counsel. 
Both of these components are at the 
heart of my congressional oversight re-
quests and the Department’s failure to 
respond. I have made this decision 
clearly not on the basis of their creden-
tials but on the basis of the Justice De-
partment’s failure to respond to con-
gressional oversight requests. 
To date, the Justice Department has 
failed to provide a full and complete re-
sponse to any of my oversight requests. 
I said the same thing when I objected 
to any unanimous consent request re-
lating to the Kenneth Polite nomina-
tion on June 22, 2021. Nothing has 
changed. 
For example, on July 15, 2021, my 
staff had yet another call with the Jus-
tice Department’s Office of Legislative 
Affairs, the very office Ms. Greenfeld 
will be in charge of. On that call, the 
Department wanted to know why I had 
a hold on Mr. Polite and whether they 
could do anything to change my mind. 
My staff made clear to the Department 
that the issues before them are quite 
simple: 
Attorney 
General 
Garland 
must respond to my oversight letters 
and records requests. 
The Department asked for that call 
with my staff, and the Department did 
not provide my staff a substantive up-
date on any of my oversight requests. 
It is absurd for the Department to 
schedule a call relating to my hold on 
Mr. Polite, which was done due to the 
Department’s consistent failure to re-
spond to my oversight requests, and 
then have no updates relating to any of 
my oversight requests. 
As one of many examples of unan-
swered questions and requests, on Feb-
ruary 3, 2021, and March 9, 2021, Sen-
ator JOHNSON and I requested informa-
tion from the Justice Department re-
lating 
to 
Nicholas 
McQuaid. 
Mr. 
McQuaid was Acting Assistant Attor-
ney General for the Criminal Division, 
the position Mr. Polite now holds. In 
those letters, we raised concerns about 
potential conflicts of interest in light 
of the fact that Mr. McQuaid was em-
ployed at Latham & Watkins until Jan-
uary 20, 2021, and worked with Chris-
topher Clark, whom Hunter Biden re-
portedly hired to work on his Federal 
criminal case. 
This arrangement presents an ongo-
ing potential conflict of interest given 
the fact Mr. McQuaid is still employed 
at the Criminal Division as the Prin-
cipal Deputy Assistant Attorney Gen-
eral. A core function of congressional 
oversight is to ensure that govern-
mental departments and agencies are 
free of conflicts of interest. That is es-
pecially so with the Justice Depart-
ment and FBI. If conflicts infect them, 
those investigations and prosecutions— 
the very purpose of the Department’s 
existence—could be undermined. 
As a part of my oversight, I have re-
quested 
a 
recusal 
memo 
for 
Mr. 
McQuaid. I have also requested to 
know, as a threshold issue, whether 
one even exists. 
Attorney General Garland has failed 
to answer and provide the requested 
records. I have noted to the Depart-
ment that in 2016, I received from the 
Department Andrew McCabe’s recusal 
memo to illustrate precedent exists for 
such a production to Congress. Still, 
the Justice Department refuses to pro-
vide the same for Mr. McQuaid. 
On the July 15, 2021, call with my 
staff, they again raised my questions 
about Mr. McQuaid. The Department 
was unable to provide any legitimate 
basis upon which it could not answer 
my questions and again failed to pro-
vide any update on the Department’s 
response. 
As I have noted before with respect 
to the Federal Government’s failure to 
respond to legitimate congressional 
oversight requests, there is nothing 
more eroding of public faith than an 
unresponsive executive branch that be-
lieves it only answers to the President 
and not the U.S. Congress and, perhaps 
most importantly, ‘‘We the People.’’ 
This administration’s continued, on-
going, and blatant lack of cooperation 
has again forced my hand.

July 26, 2021 
Thus, unfortunately, I must object to 
any consideration of these nominees. 
My objection is not intended to ques-
tion the credentials of Ms. Greenfeld 
and Mr. Schroeder in any way. The ex-
ecutive branch must recognize that it 
has an ongoing obligation to respond to 
congressional inquiries in a timely and 
reasonable manner. 
f 
EQUAL 
JUSTICE 
INITIATIVE’S 
COMMUNITY 
REMEMBRANCE 
PROJECT 
Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, today 
I rise to recognize the installation of a 
historical marker in the Good Hope 
Missionary Baptist Church yard on Au-
gust 1, 2021, that will memorialize the 
life and death of three citizens who 
were lynched in 1908. This month, my 
constituent, Ms. Joyce Salter Johnson, 
will travel with friends and family 
from Wisconsin to Mississippi to honor 
her relative Frank Johnson, as one of 
those three men who were violently 
murdered in Hickory, MS. 
This historical marker is part of the 
important work being done by the 
Equal Justice Initiative in honoring 
and memorializing lives lost to racial 
violence in this country through its 
Community 
Remembrance 
Project. 
With its mission to end mass incarcer-
ation and excessive punishment in the 
United States, challenge racial and 
economic injustice, and protect basic 
human rights for the most vulnerable, 
the Equal Justice Initiative has been 
working to expose the truth, advocate 
for change, and create hope for histori-
cally marginalized communities. Law-
yer and author Bryan Stevenson found-
ed Equal Justice Initiative in 1989, and 
since then, it has grown to an organiza-
tion of robust projects, hands-on edu-
cation, and publically accessible muse-
ums and memorials. In April of 2018, 
following in the footsteps of the late 
Dr. James Cameron of Milwaukee’s 
Black Holocaust Museum in my home 
State of Wisconsin, the Equal Justice 
Initiative—EJI—opened America’s first 
national memorial dedicated to vic-
tims of racial terror lynching and a 
new museum dedicated to slavery and 
its legacy was opened in Montgomery, 
AL. 
EJI’s 
Community 
Remembrance 
Project partners with community coa-
litions to do extensive research of doc-
umented victims of racial violence. EJI 
fosters critical conversations about our 
history and race and justice today. The 
Community Remembrance Project me-
morializes documented victims of ra-
cial violence and its Community Soil 
Collection 
Project 
gathers 
soil 
at 
lynching sites for display in powerful 
exhibits honoring these victims. Nar-
rative historical markers are erected 
in public locations where violence took 
place. 
My constituent, Wisconsin resident 
Joyce Salter Johnson, is a historian 
whose third book provides a well-re-
searched history of the Freedmen Set-
tlement of Good Hope, MS, where she 
lived until the age of 10. Thus, prior to 
EJI’s documentation, she knew the ter-
rible sequence of events that led to the 
October 10, 1908, lynching of her rel-
ative, Mr. Frank Johnson, and the two 
others. Given her knowledge, research 
skills, and inclinations, she was well- 
suited to take leadership among the co-
alition members working on the Com-
munity Remembrance Project for these 
men, and for that, I am thankful. 
I commend the work of the Equal 
Justice Initiative and all who help fur-
ther the Community Remembrance 
Project’s mission of confronting the 
legacy of slavery, lynching, and seg-
regation and charting a better future. 
And I extend my solidarity to Ms. 
Johnson and her family and friends on 
their personal journey of remembrance 
and memorial.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
RECOGNIZING BIRD DOGS COFFEE 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, as ranking 
member of the Senate Committee on 
Small Business and Entrepreneurship, 
each week I recognize an outstanding 
Kentucky small business that exempli-
fies the American entrepreneurial spir-
it. This week, it is my privilege to rec-
ognize Bird Dogs Coffee, a family- 
owned small business in Owenton, KY, 
as the Senate Small Business of the 
Week. 
Located in the heart of Owenton, 
Kasey Craigmyle Towles opened Bird 
Dogs Coffee in 2015. Kasey, who grew up 
in Owenton and was the founder and 
operator of ‘‘Kasey’s Corner,’’ a suc-
cessful gift shop, decided to pursue a 
different business venture that would 
uplift her hometown and foster a sense 
of community. When Bird Dogs Coffee 
opened its door, Kasey and her hus-
band, Randy, were seizing the oppor-
tunity to fill a gap in the Owenton 
market since there was not a coffee 
shop in town. Together, Kasey and 
Randy created a welcoming cafe with 
delicious food, friendly service, and a 
hospitable atmosphere. 
Today, Bird Dogs Coffee has become 
a local favorite and has consistently 
received high praise and glowing re-
views in local and regional publica-
tions for its outstanding service and 
homemade cuisine. Bird Dogs Coffee 
welcomes customers from all over 
northern Kentucky by providing a 
place for both locals and travelers to 
catch up over a cup of coffee. Kasey 
and Randy host a number of events at 
their coffee shop, including live music 
and wine and beer tastings. Moreover, 
Bird Dogs Coffee provides a meeting 
space for local organizations like the 
Owenton Rotary Club. Entrepreneurs 
at heart, Kasey and Randy have con-
tinued seeking ways to grow their busi-
ness while serving their community. 
They have purchased buildings next to 
Bird Dogs Coffee’s original location 
and plan to open an event space and ex-
panded gift shop to meet the needs of 
their hometown. 
Like many small business owners, 
Kasey and Randy are actively involved 
in their community. Bird Dogs Coffee 
is a member of the Owen County Cham-
ber of Commerce and is an enthusiastic 
supporter of the Owen County Tourism 
Commission. For several years, Bird 
Dogs Coffee has sponsored Owen Coun-
ty School District sports teams and 
contributed to multiple fundraisers for 
local 
organizations. 
Additionally, 
Kasey and Randy regularly donate to 
Owen 
County 
Project 
Graduation, 
which provides an alcohol- and drug- 
free graduation celebration for local 
high school seniors. With Owen County 
High being close to their hearts, Kasey 
and Randy are also actively involved 
with the Owen County High School 
Alumni Association. 
Bird Dogs Coffee is a remarkable ex-
ample of how hard work, ingenuity, 
and discipline can turn a dream into 
reality. Small businesses like Bird 
Dogs Coffee form the heart of towns 
across Kentucky, regularly stepping up 
to support their communities. Con-
gratulations to Kasey, Randy, and the 
entire team at Bird Dogs Coffee. I wish 
Bird Dogs Coffee the best of luck and 
look forward to watching this small 
business’s continued growth and suc-
cess in Kentucky.∑

REMEMBERING DAVID 
MERMELSTEIN 
∑ Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
I rise today to commemorate the life 
and legacy of David Mermelstein. 
David was born in Kevjazd, Czecho-
slovakia, on December 21, 1928. In 1944, 
at just 16 years old, David was sent to 
the Nazi concentration camp at Ausch-
witz until the American liberation of 
the camp in 1945. He was the only mem-
ber of his family to survive the Holo-
caust. David lost everything, including 
documentation of his family’s insur-
ance policy. After 2 years in a displaced 
persons camp, David came to the 
United States in 1948. He met his wife, 
Irene, who is also a Holocaust survivor, 
in New York. Together, they decided to 
move to Miami, FL, where they made a 
lifelong home. 
David devoted his life to serving the 
south Florida Jewish community, as-
suming leadership roles in many orga-
nizations. He was passionate about 
educating our children about the Holo-
caust. He founded the Holocaust Sur-
vivors of Miami-Dade County, becom-
ing a national advocate for survivors 
and testifying before Congress on their 
behalf on the need for restitution to 
obtain the most equitable compensa-
tion possible for the survivors. 
David lived through unspeakable hor-
ror and dedicated his life to educating 
and inspiring those around him. Our 
memory of all those who suffered must 
never weaken, and we must always 
fight against hate. 
David was beloved by all who knew 
him. He was a fierce advocate and an 
inspiration to all who heard his story. 
David exemplified what it means to

PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS 
The following petitions and memo-
rials were laid before the Senate and 
were referred or ordered to lie on the 
table as indicated: 
POM–37. A resolution adopted by the House 
of Representatives of the State of Louisiana 
urging the United States Congress to pass 
the Treat and Reduce Obesity Act of 2021; to 
the Committee on Finance. 
HOUSE RESOLUTION NO. 215 
Whereas, the National Institutes of Health 
has reported that the obesity epidemic is 
now the second-leading cause of death in the 
United States, with an estimated three hun-
dred thousand deaths per year nationally at-
tributed to the epidemic; and 
Whereas, obesity increases the risk for 
chronic diseases and conditions including 
high blood pressure, heart disease, certain 
cancers, arthritis, mental illness, lipid dis-
orders, sleep apnea, and type two diabetes; 
and 
Whereas, over thirty-four percent of rural 
Americans live with obesity while just under 
twenty-nine percent of Americans who reside 
in metropolitan areas live with the condi-
tion; and 
Whereas, racial and ethnic minority groups 
have been disproportionately impacted by 
this epidemic with the highest prevalence of 
obesity 
occurring 
among 
non-Hispanic 
blacks (forty-nine and six-tenths percent) 
followed by Hispanics (forty-four and eight- 
tenths percent), non-Hispanic whites (forty- 
two and two-tenths percent), and non-His-
panic Asian adults (seventeen and four- 
tenths percent); and 
Whereas, currently, over one trillion four 
hundred billion dollars are expended annu-
ally on direct and indirect costs for treating 
health conditions related to obesity; and 
Whereas, on average, measured in 2019 dol-
lars, the annual cost of health care for a 
Medicare beneficiary with obesity is two 
thousand eighteen dollars more than the an-
nual cost of health care for a beneficiary of 
healthy weight; and 
Whereas, the overall improvement in pub-
lic health resulting from coverage for obe-
sity treatments would lead to lower expendi-
tures in emergency room care, ambulatory 
care, inpatient stays, and prescriptions and 
is estimated to achieve net savings in 
healthcare costs of approximately seven 
thousand dollars per person over ten years; 
and 
Whereas, utilization of obesity treatments 
are predicted to generate Medicare budget 
savings of between eighteen billion dollars 
and twenty-three billion dollars over ten 
years; and 
Whereas, less than one percent of Medicare 
beneficiaries with obesity are able to access 
obesity care; and 
Whereas, the Treat and Reduce Obesity 
Act of 2021 (TROA) has been introduced as 
H.R. 1577 and S. 596 in the One Hundred Sev-
enteenth United States Congress; and 
Whereas, this legislation is a real oppor-
tunity to help adults living with obesity by 
making targeted therapies and medications 
more widely available through Medicare; and 
Whereas, the Medicare coverage changes 
proposed by TROA would decrease federal 
government 
spending 
by 
approximately 
twenty-five million dollars over the fiscal 
year 2020 through 2029 budget period; and 
Whereas, 
with 
cosponsors 
representing 
both the Democratic and Republican Parties, 
TROA enjoys bipartisan support in both the 
United States Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives, and Senator Bill Cassidy and 
Representative Garret Graves of Louisiana 
are among the cosponsors of this legislation; 
and 
Whereas, organizations that have endorsed 
TROA include the Academy of Nutrition and

Therefore, be it Resolved, that the House of 
Representatives of the Legislature of Lou-
isiana does hereby memorialize the United 
States Congress to pass the Treat and Re-
duce Obesity Act of 2021; and be it further 
Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be 
transmitted to the presiding officers of the 
Senate and the House of Representatives of 
the Congress of the United States of America 
and to each member of the Louisiana con-
gressional delegation. 
POM–38. A concurrent resolution adopted 
by the Legislature of the State of Louisiana 
memorializing its opposition to dispropor-
tionately increasing the tax burden on nat-
ural gas, oil and fuel industries; to the Com-
mittee on Finance. 
HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 98 
Whereas, the natural gas, oil, and fuel in-
dustries contribute significantly to jobs in 
Louisiana communities and to the develop-
ment of state of the art emissions reduction 
technologies; and 
Whereas, these industries support nearly 
eleven million jobs across the country, power 
the nation’s economy, and generate billions 
in revenue for federal and state governments 
in rents, royalties, and corporate and income 
tax payments, including fourteen billion dol-
lars for state treasuries through severance 
taxes in 2019 alone; and 
Whereas, these industries support more 
than 249,800 jobs in Louisiana and account 
for more than fourteen and a half billion dol-
lars in wages in the state; and 
Whereas, these industries contribute sev-
enty-three billion dollars in gross domestic 
product for the state; and 
Whereas, these industries contributed four 
and a half billion dollars in direct revenues 
for Louisiana in 2019, and Louisiana relies on 
those revenues to fund schools, infrastruc-
ture, and other critical social services; and 
Whereas, direct industry jobs pay seven 
times the federal minimum wage and sev-
enty percent higher than the national aver-
age wage; and 
Whereas, every direct job in natural gas, 
oil, and fuel industries support an additional 
2.7 jobs in affiliated industries, from lodging 
to restaurants in proximity to these indus-
tries’ operations; and 
Whereas, these industries’ investments in 
this country have led to a fifteen percent de-
crease in household energy costs over the 
last decade, while costs for food, education, 
and healthcare have skyrocketed; and 
Whereas, those cheaper energy costs are 
crucial to working families in our commu-
nities and across the country; and 
Whereas, the natural gas, oil, and fuel in-
dustries should not be prevented from recov-
ering costs that other industries are eligible 
for simply because they operate in a dif-
ferent economic sector; and 
Whereas, the United States tax code allows 
industries across the manufacturing sector 
to recover costs related to job creation and 
other operational investments; and 
Whereas, these common tax mechanisms 
allow natural gas, oil, and fuel industries to 
create jobs and offset the intangible costs of 
drilling; invest in our communities; fund 
critical education, infrastructure, and social 
service programs; and deliver the energy 
that working families rely on every day; and 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana 
does hereby express its opposition to singling 
out these natural gas, oil, and fuels indus-
tries by disproportionately increasing the 
tax burden on them and the constituents of 
this state; and be it further 
Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be 
transmitted to the president of the United 
States, each member of the president’s cabi-
net, each member of the Louisiana congres-
sional delegation, and to the members of the 
capitol press corps.

the Committee on Finance. 
HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 24 
Whereas, The economy of the United 
States is experiencing increased demands for 
highly trained, skilled tradespeople to fill 
jobs in the construction, welding, and other 
vocational sectors; and 
Whereas, In the United States, there are 
nearly half a million more jobs available in 
the skilled trades than workers with the 
skills to fill them; and 
Whereas, The number of available jobs in 
the skilled trades is anticipated to rise to 
two million over the next decade; and

July 26, 2021 
Whereas, A traditional college education is 
one path to success, but not the only path, 
especially in light of the increasing costs of 
a traditional four-year college degree and 
the growing demand for skilled labor; and 
Whereas, Encouraging students and their 
families to invest in alternative forms of 
postsecondary skills could help reshape our 
nation’s future workforce; and 
Whereas, Providing the next generation 
the ability to save money for the future 
costs of tools, equipment, and business ex-
penses will make it easier to enter a voca-
tion, trade, or start a small business in the 
skilled trades industry; and 
Whereas, The West Virginia Legislature 
has adopted legislation authorizing the West 
Virginia Jumpstart Savings Program, which 
creates several tax incentives to help pro-
gram participants save money, by allowing 
an income tax deduction for contributions to 
a Jumpstart Savings account, by providing 
businesses with a non-refundable state tax 
credit for matching an employee’s own con-
tribution to his or her account each year; 
and 
Whereas, The Jumpstart Savings Program 
will allow individuals to roll 529 College Sav-
ings plan funds over to a Jumpstart Savings 
account without facing state income tax 
penalties; and 
Whereas, West Virginia’s Jumpstart Sav-
ings Program could be a model for other 
states to invest in the future entrepreneur-
ship and small business trade industries in 
our nation, and Congress should extend fed-
eral tax benefits to such programs; Therefore 
be it Resolved by the Legislature of West Vir-
ginia: 
That Congress is urged to provide tax bene-
fits to participants in Jumpstart Savings 
programs that are similar to those currently 
provided to participants in College Savings 
plans pursuant to 26 U.S.C. § 529; and be it 
further 
Resolved, That the Clerk of the House of 
Delegates is hereby directed to forward a 
copy of this resolution, along with a copy of 
the Jumpstart Savings Act, to the President 
and Secretary of the United States Senate, 
to the Speaker and Clerk of the United 
States House of Representatives, and to 
members of West Virginia’s congressional 
delegation. 
POM–40. A resolution adopted by the Sen-
ate of Louisiana urging the United States 
Congress to enact the Treat and Reduce Obe-
sity Act (TROA); to the Committee on Fi-
nance. 
SENATE RESOLUTION NO. 245 
Whereas, the National Institutes of Health 
has reported that obesity is now the second 
leading cause of death nationally, with an 
estimated three hundred thousand deaths a 
year attributed to the epidemic; and 
Whereas, obesity increases the risk for 
chronic diseases and conditions, including 
high blood pressure, heart disease, certain 
cancers, arthritis, mental illness, lipid dis-
orders, sleep apnea, and type 2 diabetes; and 
Whereas, 34.2% of rural Americans live 
with obesity compared to 28.7% of those who 
live in metropolitan areas; and 
Whereas, racial and ethnic minority groups 
have been disproportionately impacted, with 
the highest prevalence of obesity among non- 
Hispanic blacks (49.6%), followed by His-
panics 
(44.8%) 
and 
non-Hispanic 
whites 
(42.2%), 
and 
non-Hispanic 
Asian 
adults 
(17.4%); and 
Whereas, currently, $1.42 trillion is spent 
each year on direct and indirect costs for 
health conditions related to obesity; and 
Whereas, on average in 2019, a Medicare 
beneficiary with obesity cost two thousand 
eighteen dollars more than a healthy-weight 
beneficiary; and 
Whereas, overall improvement in health 
conditions from covered obesity treatments 
would lead to lower expenditures in emer-
gency room care, ambulatory care, inpatient 
stays, and prescriptions, resulting in net sav-
ings between six thousand seven hundred 
dollars and seven thousand one hundred dol-
lars over ten years per person; and 
Whereas, utilization of obesity treatments 
will generate Medicare budget savings be-
tween eighteen and twenty-three billion dol-
lars over ten years; and 
Whereas, less than one percent of Medicare 
beneficiaries with obesity are able to access 
obesity care; and 
Whereas, the proposed Medicare coverage 
changes would decrease federal government 
spending by approximately twenty-five mil-
lion dollars over the fiscal years 2020–2029 
budget window; and 
Whereas, the Treat and Reduce Obesity 
Act (TROA) authored by Louisiana United 
States Senator BILL CASSIDY is a real oppor-
tunity to help adults living with obesity by 
making targeted therapies and medications 
more widely available through Medicare; and 
Whereas, the TROA legislation enjoys bi-par-
tisan support, being co-sponsored by five Re-
publicans in the United States Senate and 
five Democrats in the United States Senate; 
and 
Whereas, the following organizations have 
endorsed TROA: Academy of Nutrition and 
Dietetics, American Academy of PAs, Amer-
ican

of

Endocrinologists, American Association of 
Nurse Practitioners, American College of Oc-

Resolved, That the Senate of the Legisla-
ture of Louisiana does hereby memorialize 
the Congress of the United States to enact 
the Treat and Reduce Obesity Act (TROA); 
and be it further 
Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution 
shall be transmitted to the secretary of the 
United States Senate, the clerk of the 
United States House of Representatives, and 
to each member of the Louisiana delegation 
to the United States Congress. 
POM–41. A resolution adopted by the House 
of Representatives of Louisiana urging the 
United States Congress to take such actions 
as are necessary to pass the ABLE Age Ad-
justment Act; to the Committee on Finance. 
HOUSE RESOLUTION NO. 99 
Whereas, the Achieving a Better Life Expe-
rience Act, also known as the ABLE Act, was 
passed by Congress and subsequently signed 
into law in 2014; and 
Whereas, the ABLE Act has created tax-ad-
vantaged savings accounts known as ‘‘ABLE 
accounts’’ for persons with disabilities and 
has allowed funds to be withdrawn from the 
accounts to cover costs of health care, em-
ployment support, housing, transportation, 
assistive technology, and lifelong education 
for those persons; and 
Whereas, ABLE accounts are subject to the 
same tax treatment as the popular education 
savings 
accounts 
commonly 
called 
‘‘529 
plans’’; and 
Whereas, the ABLE Act has created a pow-
erful incentive for individuals and families 
to save private funds for the purpose of sup-
porting persons with disabilities in main-
taining health, independence, and quality of 
life; and 
Whereas, the ABLE Act, as enacted, stipu-
lates that funds held in an ABLE account do 
not count toward any maximum limit on a 
person’s assets upon which eligibility for a 
means-tested federal program may be con-
tingent; and 
Whereas, savings in an ABLE account do 
not jeopardize a person’s eligibility for pro-
grams such as Medicaid and Supplemental 
Security Income; and 
Whereas, the asset limits of such programs 
had previously forced low-income persons 
into the difficult decision of whether to 
spend their limited resources, down to two 
thousand dollars in most cases, in order to 
become eligible for needed assistance; and 
Whereas, the ABLE Act, as enacted, in-
cludes a fiscal safeguard for states by pro-
viding that if the ABLE account beneficiary 
dies or his disability ceases and assets re-
main in the account, the assets will first be 
distributed to any state Medicaid plan that 
provided assistance to the person; and 
Whereas, as evidenced by the party affili-
ations of its seventy-eight original cospon-
sors being almost perfectly balanced, the 
ABLE Act legislation enjoys broad bipar-
tisan support; and 
Whereas, the ABLE Act embodies sound 
economic policy by encouraging savings and 
asset building; and 
Whereas, the ABLE Act promotes impor-
tant values that our nation holds dear by 
providing that every citizen living with a 
disability has the opportunity to attain inde-
pendence and an improved quality of life; 
and 
Whereas, prior to its passing, a limitation 
was added to the ABLE Act, which limits the 
benefits to persons who had the onset of dis-
ability before the age of twenty-six; and 
Whereas, this age limitation has prevented 
many persons and families from receiving 
the many benefits of the ABLE Act; and 
Whereas, the ABLE Age Adjustment Act 
has been introduced as S. 331 and H.R. 1219 in 
the One Hundred Seventeenth United States 
Congress; and 
Whereas, the ABLE Age Adjustment Act 
would make the provisions of the ABLE Act 
available to persons who had the onset of 
disability before the age of forty-six; and 
Whereas, if passed, the ABLE Age Adjust-
ment Act would make six million more per-
sons with disabilities eligible for ABLE ac-
counts; and 
Whereas, if passed, the ABLE Age Adjust-
ment Act would also help states keep admin-
istrative costs for the state ABLE programs 
low; and 
Whereas, as evidenced by the party affili-
ations of its sixty-five cosponsors, the ABLE 
Age Adjustment Act has broad bipartisan 
support: Therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives of the Legislature of Louisiana does 
hereby memorialize the United States Con-
gress to take such actions as are necessary 
to pass the ABLE Age Adjustment Act; be it 
further 
Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be 
transmitted to the presiding officers of the 
Senate and the House of Representatives of 
the Congress of the United States of America 
and to each member of the Louisiana con-
gressional delegation.

similar legislation and to take such actions 
as are necessary to review and eliminate all 
provisions of federal law which reduce Social 
Security benefits for those receiving pension 
benefits from federal, state, or local govern-
ment retirement or pension systems, plans, 
or funds; to the Committee on Finance. 
HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 7 
Whereas, the Congress of the United States 
of America has enacted both the Government 
Pension Offset (GPO), reducing the spousal 
and survivor Social Security benefit, and the 
Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP), re-
ducing the earned Social Security benefits 
payable to any person who also receives a 
public pension benefit; and 
Whereas, the GPO negatively affects a 
spouse or survivor receiving a federal, state, 
or local government retirement or pension 
benefit who would also be entitled to a So-
cial Security benefit earned by a spouse; and 
Whereas, the GPO formula reduces the 
spousal or survivor Social Security benefit 
by two-thirds of the amount of the federal, 
state, or local government retirement or 
pension benefit received by the spouse or 
survivor, in many cases completely elimi-
nating the Social Security benefit even 
though their spouses paid Social Security 
taxes for many years; and 
Whereas, the GPO has a harsh effect on 
hundreds of thousands of citizens and under-
mines the original purpose of the Social Se-
curity dependent/survivor benefit; and 
Whereas, according to recent Social Secu-
rity Administration figures, more than half 
a million individuals nationally are affected 
by the GPO; and 
Whereas, the WEP applies to those persons 
who have earned federal, state, or local gov-
ernment retirement or pension benefits, in 
addition to working in employment covered 
under Social Security and paying into the 
Social Security system; and 
Whereas, the WEP reduces the earned So-
cial Security benefit using an averaged in-
dexed monthly earnings formula and may re-
duce Social Security benefits for affected 
persons by as much as one-half of the retire-
ment benefit earned as a public servant in 
employment not covered under Social Secu-
rity; and 
Whereas, the WEP causes hardworking in-
dividuals to lose a significant portion of the 
Social Security benefits that they earn 
themselves; and 
Whereas, according to recent Social Secu-
rity Administration figures, more than one 
and a half million individuals nationally are 
affected by the WEP; and 
Whereas, in certain circumstances, both 
the WEP and the GPO can be applied to a 
qualifying survivor’s benefit, each independ-
ently reducing the available benefit and in 
combination eliminating a large portion of 
the total Social Security benefit available to 
the survivor; and 
Whereas, because of the calculation char-
acteristics of the GPO and the WEP, they 
have a disproportionately negative effect on 
employees working in lower-wage govern-
ment 
jobs, 
like 
policemen, 
firefighters, 
teachers, and state employees; and 
Whereas, Louisiana is making every effort 
to improve the quality of life of its citizens 
and to encourage them to live here lifelong, 
yet the current GPO and WEP provisions 
compromise their quality of life; and 
Whereas, the number of people affected by 
GPO and WEP is growing every day as more 
and more people reach retirement age; and 
Whereas, individuals drastically affected 
by the GPO or WEP may have no choice but 
to return to work after retirement in order 
to make ends meet, but the earnings accu-
mulated during this return to work can fur-
ther reduce the Social Security benefits the 
individual is entitled to; and 
Whereas, the GPO and WEP are established 
in federal law, and repeal of the GPO and the 
WEP can only be enacted by congress: There-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana 
does hereby memorialize the United States 
Congress to take all such actions as are nec-
essary to review the Government Pension 
Offset and the Windfall Elimination Provi-
sion Social Security benefit reductions and 
to eliminate or reduce them by supporting 
H.R. 82 of the 117th Congress, the Social Se-
curity Fairness Act and all similar purposed 
legislation; and be it further 
Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be 
transmitted to the presiding officers of the 
Senate and the House of Representatives of 
the Congress of the United States of America 
and to each member of the Louisiana con-
gressional delegation and the president of 
the United States.

318—EX-
PRESSING 
SUPPORT 
FOR 
THE 
DESIGNATION OF JULY 2021 AS 
‘‘AMERICAN 
GROWN 
FLOWER 
AND FOLIAGE MONTH’’ 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. 
PADILLA, and Mr. SULLIVAN) submitted 
the following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on Agri-
culture, Nutrition, and Forestry: 
S. RES. 318 
Whereas cut flower and foliage growers in 
the United States are hard-working, dedi-
cated individuals who bring beauty, eco-
nomic stimulus, and pride to their commu-
nities and the United States; 
Whereas the people of the United States 
have a long history of using flowers and foli-
age grown in the United States to bring 
beauty to important events and express af-
fection for loved ones; 
Whereas 
consumers 
spend 
over 
$35,000,000,000 each year on floral products, 
including cut flowers, garden plants, bed-
ding, and indoor plants; 
Whereas, each year, an increasing number 
of households in the United States purchase 
fresh cut flowers and foliage from more than 
16,000 florists and floral establishments; 
Whereas the annual per capita spending on 
floral products by consumers in the United 
States is almost $108; 
Whereas the people of the United States in-
creasingly want to support domestically pro-
duced foods and agricultural products and 
would prefer to buy locally grown flowers 
and foliage whenever possible, yet a majority 
of domestic consumers do not know where 
the flowers and foliage they purchase are 
grown; 
Whereas, in response to increased demand, 
the ‘‘Certified American Grown’’ logo was 
created in July 2014 in order to educate and 
empower consumers to purchase flowers and 
foliage from domestic producers; 
Whereas millions of stems of domestically 
grown flowers and foliage are now ‘‘Certified 
American Grown’’; 
Whereas domestic flower and foliage farm-
ers produce thousands of varieties of flowers 
and foliage across the United States, such as 
peonies in Alaska, Gerbera daisies in Cali-
fornia, lupines in Maine, tulips in Wash-
ington, lilies in Oregon, larkspur in Texas, 
and leatherleaf in Florida; 
Whereas the top flower and foliage vari-
eties with the highest production in the 
United States are tulips, Gerbera daisies, lil-
ies, gladiolas, roses, and leatherleaf; 
Whereas people in every State have access 
to domestically grown flowers and foliage, 
yet only 20 percent of flowers and foliage 
sold in the United States is domestically 
grown; 
Whereas the domestic cut flower and foli-
age industry— 
(1) creates a substantial economic impact 
daily; and 
(2) supports hundreds of growers, thou-
sands of small businesses, and tens of thou-
sands of jobs in the United States; 
Whereas most domestic cut flowers and fo-
liage are sold in the United States within 24 
to 48 hours after harvest and last longer than 
flowers shipped longer distances; 
Whereas flowers and foliage grown domes-
tically enhance the ability of the people of 
the United States to festively celebrate wed-
dings and births and honor those who have 
passed; 
Whereas flower and foliage giving has been 
a holiday tradition in the United States for 
generations; 
Whereas flowers and foliage speak to the 
beauty of motherhood on Mother’s Day and 
to the spirit of love on Valentine’s Day; 
Whereas flowers and foliage are an essen-
tial part of other holidays such as Thanks-
giving, Christmas, Hanukkah, and Kwanzaa; 
Whereas flowers and foliage help com-
memorate the service and sacrifice of mem-
bers of the Armed Forces on Memorial Day 
and Veterans Day; and 
Whereas the Senate encourages the cul-
tivation of flowers and foliage in the United 
States by domestic flower and foliage farm-
ers: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the designation of July 2021 as 
‘‘American 
Grown 
Flower 
and 
Foliage 
Month’’; 
(2) recognizes that purchasing flowers and 
foliage grown in the United States supports 
the farmers, small businesses, jobs, and econ-
omy of the United States; 
(3) recognizes that growing flowers and fo-
liage in the United States is a vital part of 
the agricultural industry of the United 
States; 
(4) recognizes that cultivating flowers and 
foliage domestically enhances the ability of 
the people of the United States to festively 
celebrate holidays and special occasions; and 
(5) urges all people of the United States to 
proactively showcase flowers and foliage 
grown in the United States in order to show 
support for— 
(A) the flower and foliage farmers, proc-
essors, and distributors in the United States; 
and

S5072 
July 26, 2021 
(B) the agricultural industry of the United 
States overall. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
rise today to introduce the American 
Grown Flower and Foliage Month reso-
lution. This resolution is cosponsored 
by Senator PADILLA and Senator SUL-
LIVAN, and I want to thank them for 
joining me in introducing this resolu-
tion. 
This resolution designates July 2021 
as ‘‘American Grown Flower and Foli-
age Month’’ and recognizes the impor-
tant contributions of all those involved 
in the flower and foliage industry make 
to our Nation, and also notes the long 
history that flowers have in our Nation 
and society. 
Every year, thousands of households 
in the United States purchase fresh cut 
flowers and foliage from more than 
16,000 florists and floral establish-
ments. American consumers spend $35 
billion per year on floral products each 
year. 
California is the cut flower capital of 
the United States, producing nearly 75 
percent of American-grown flowers. 
While the majority of Americans would 
prefer to buy locally grown flowers, 
only 20 percent of the flowers sold in 
the United States are grown domesti-
cally. 
Flowers are used for all types of oc-
casions. They help us celebrate major 
life events, and help us to mourn. The 
flower and foliage industry is also a 
major employer in the United States. 
This industry supports hundreds of 
growers, thousands of small businesses, 
and tens of thousands of jobs in the 
United States. 
Our resolution encourages consumers 
to look for the ‘Certified American 
Grown’ label to support local farmers 
this month and throughout the year. If 
consumers are able to differentiate be-
tween 
American-grown 
flowers 
and 
those that have been imported, many 
would choose to purchase U.S.-grown 
flowers and support the U.S. industry. 
This resolution is an important way 
to recognize a major part of the agri-
cultural industry in the United States, 
and I encourage my colleagues to move 
to pass this resolution to commemo-
rate this important month as ‘‘Amer-
ican 
Grown 
Flower 
and 
Foliage 
Month.’’ 
Thank you Mr. President. I yield the 
Floor.

319—EX-
PRESSING 
SUPPORT

AWARE-
NESS MONTH’’ 
Mr. JOHNSON submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was referred 
to the Committee on Health, Edu-
cation, Labor, and Pensions: 
S. RES. 319 
Whereas sarcoma is a cancer of connective 
tissues, such as nerves, muscles, joints, fat, 
bones, and blood vessels, that can arise any-
where in the body; 
Whereas, in the United States— 
(1) 16,000 individuals are diagnosed with 
sarcoma each year; 
(2) more than 7,000 individuals die from 
sarcoma each year; and 
(3) 50,000 individuals struggle with sarcoma 
at any 1 time; 
Whereas, each year, 1 percent of cancers di-
agnosed in adults and 20 percent of cancers 
diagnosed in children are sarcoma; 
Whereas more than 70 subtypes of sarcoma 
have been identified; 
Whereas sarcoma is often misdiagnosed 
and underreported; and 
Whereas July 2021 would be an appropriate 
month to designate as National Sarcoma 
Awareness Month— 
(1) to raise awareness about sarcoma; and 
(2) to encourage more individuals in the 
United States to get properly diagnosed and 
treated: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate supports the des-
ignation of July 2021 as ‘‘National Sarcoma 
Awareness Month’’.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE AND 
LEGACY OF SUSAN SCANLAN 
HON. ROBERT C. ‘‘BOBBY’’ SCOTT 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 26, 2021 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to celebrate the life and legacy of Susan 
Scanlan. 
Susan was a public servant, leader, and 
mentor who dedicated herself to improving the 
lives of women and families. This personal 
drive led Susan to help found the Congres-
sional Caucus for Women’s Issues and its as-
sociated policy arm, the Women’s Research 
and Education Institute (WREI), in 1977. For 
five years, Susan served as the Caucus’s di-
rector before taking the helm of WREI’s Con-
gressional Fellowship on Women and Public 
Policy, which provides aspiring policy leaders 
with invaluable Capitol Hill experience. Thanks 
to Susan’s leadership, the WREI Congres-
sional Fellowship (and its successor) has 
placed hundreds of talented fellows in con-
gressional offices, bringing their unique tal-
ents, strengths, and passion for women’s 
issues to the Hill. 
Throughout my service in Congress, I have 
had the pleasure and honor of hosting over a 
dozen fellows through this successful pro-
gram. These fellows have been incredible as-
sets to both my office and the work of the in-
stitution. Most importantly, however, they have 
had the unique opportunity to gain firsthand 
experience in policymaking—all because of 
Susan’s work. Today, the WREI Congres-
sional Fellowship—Susan’s legacy—lives on 
through the Congressional Fellowships on 
Women and Public Policy. 
My thoughts and prayers are with her family 
and friends.

HONORING 
REBECCA 
BERBERIAN 
AS A 28TH CONGRESSIONAL DIS-
TRICT WOMAN OF THE YEAR 
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 26, 2021 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in honor of Women’s History Month. Each 
year, we pay special tribute to the contribu-
tions and sacrifices made by our nation’s 
women. It is an honor to pay homage to out-
standing women who are making a difference 
in my Congressional District. I would like to 
recognize a remarkable woman, Rebecca 
Berberian of Glendale, California. 
A native Angeleno, Rebecca Berberian, RN, 
BSN, MHA, has been a resident of Glendale 
for over thirty years. She attained a Bachelor 
of Science in Nursing from Pacific Union Col-
lege, in Angwin, California, and a Master’s in 
Healthcare Administration from Cal State LA 
while working fulltime. She began her career 
in healthcare in 1988 as an operating room 
nurse at LAC+USC Medical Center and later 
went on to work as a surgical nurse at Advent-
ist Health White Memorial in Los Angeles. She 
has worked at Adventist Health White Memo-
rial for more than three decades, and pres-
ently serves as the hospital’s director of the 
Risk Management and Infection Prevention 
departments. In this capacity, Rebecca devel-
ops policies and procedures to promote pa-
tient safety, collects and analyzes infection 
data, manages hospital claims, and coordi-
nates with local and national public health 
agencies. As a mission driven and faith-based 
organization, Adventist Health White Memorial 
has encouraged Rebecca to follow her pas-
sion. of volunteering and working in several 
medical missions in underserved regions of 
Peru, Armenia and Artsakh. 
Ms. Berberian is wholeheartedly dedicated 
to her work and to the community that the 
hospital serves. Her passion for her job be-
came 
even 
more 
evident 
during 
the 
coronavirus pandemic. Specifically during the 
surge periods, she worked long hours sup-
porting the hospital’s efforts in responding to 
the pandemic, including taking part in strategic 
decision-making about converting hospital 
units to accommodate high hospitalization 
rates, contact tracing infections among staff, 
and securing personal protective equipment. 
Rebecca demonstrated compassion and em-
pathy towards families during their loved ones’ 
hospital stays and did everything she could to 
support them. She has also volunteered at the 
hospital’s vaccination clinics. Rebecca is 
thankful for her colleagues and hospital ad-
ministration for the teamwork, support, and ex-
pertise that was displayed during this unprece-
dented time. 
In addition to her career in healthcare, Ms. 
Berberian is active in the Armenian Relief So-
ciety (ARS), which is an international edu-
cational, philanthropic, and humanitarian orga-
nization. She served as the ARS Western 
USA Chairwoman and also as Chair of the 
Los Angeles ARS Maro Chapter, where she is 
currently a member. In her roles as chair-
person, she oversaw the work of the ARS Sat-
urday Armenian schools and led fundraising 
campaigns. Rebecca continues to work for the 
betterment of Armenians in the homeland and 
diaspora. 
Rebecca is married to her husband, Sarkis, 
and together they have two daughters, Alique 
and Lori. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring this exceptional, well-re-
spected woman of California’s 28th Congres-
sional District, Rebecca Berberian. 
HONORING 
THE 
100TH 
ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE BATAVIA BUSI-
NESS AND PROFESSIONAL WOM-
EN’S CLUB 
HON. CHRIS JACOBS 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 26, 2021 
Mr. JACOBS of New York. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize the Batavia Business 
and Professional Women’s Club on its centen-
nial anniversary. 
The Batavia Business and Professional 
Women’s Club was founded in 1921, at a time 
when all other local clubs were exclusive to 
men. Its mission was clear from the start: for 
women to meet and contribute meaningfully to 
the greater community. Under the leadership 
of its first president, Miss Lilliam Bender, the 
club garnered notoriety remarkably fast. Miss 
Bender received telegrams from countless es-
teemed individuals—President Harding, Vice 
President Coolidge, General Pershing, and 
Marshal Ferdinand Foch—all extending their 
congratulations for her work to establish such 
a progressive organization. By the end of 
1921, the club had attracted more than one- 
hundred new members. 
The Batavia Business and Professional 
Women’s Club has been a key resource for 
local communities throughout its one-hundred- 
year history, including in recent years. More 
recently, the club has provided meals and 
snacks to Habitat for Humanity volunteers, do-
nated baskets to the Holland Land Office’s an-
nual Christmas fundraiser, and sponsored a 
family for the Thanksgiving holiday. Members 
of the organization have also routinely volun-
teered with the Salvation Army, the United 
Way, and the Batavia Public School System. 
Sponsoring 
fundraisers 
for 
local 
women 
owned businesses is another way the club 
supports its community. The organization 
holds fundraising events for several other pur-
poses each year, such as events to raise 
money for college scholarships and service or-
ganizations. 
The Batavia Business and Professional 
Women’s Club is proud to attract a diverse 
membership. Since its inception, the club has 
brought together small business owners, 
schoolteachers, local government officials, 
self-made 
entrepreneurs, 
medical 
profes-
sionals, and countless other women from an 
array of fields and occupations. Among the 
members today, I would particularly like to rec-
ognize the teachers and employees of the Ba-
tavia City School District, the professionals at 
Genesee Cancer Assistance, and the small 
business owners from local favorites, such as

pressive professions, and I again congratulate 
the club on its centennial anniversary.

July 26, 2021 
IN RECOGNITION OF JOSEPH R. 
SIVEWRIGHT’S 
RETIREMENT 
FROM NESTLE´
PURINA PETCARE 
COMPANY 
HON. ANN WAGNER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 26, 2021 
Mrs. WAGNER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and honor the incredible 
work and service of Joseph Sivewright. On 
July 30, 2021, he will officially retire as the 
Nestle´ Purina Chairman after over 30 years of 
outstanding leadership. 
Since joining Nestle´
Purina in 1985, Mr. 
Sivewright has held various positions through-
out the company as he proved himself to be 
a treasured employee. Prior to his role as 
Chairman, he was appointed as the com-
pany’s President & Chief Operating Officer 
and was then named President and Chief Ex-
ecutive Officer. 
His dedicated leadership has not gone un-
noticed. In 2016, just one year after he took 
the reins as Chief Executive Officer, he was 
named one of the country’s most popular 
CEOs. It comes as no surprise that Nestle´ Pu-
rina received numerous accolades from both 
St. Louis organizations and national organiza-
tions while under his direction. 
I want to personally thank Joe for his many 
years of friendship, as well as his desire to en-
sure Nestle´ Purina is a strong community part-
ner. His distinguished career and tremendous 
leadership are celebrated by our St. Louis 
community. I personally appreciate the impact 
his work ethic and constant drive to improve 
the lives of those around had on his employ-
ees. As a former Purina employee myself 
when I was just out of college, I know how im-
portant it is to have a smart and driven leader 
at the helm to set the tone for the rest of us 
and help us achieve even greater heights. Joe 
had a tremendous impact not only on all of 
those with whom he worked throughout his 
many years at Purina, but also on those he 
worked with outside of work as a dedicated 
member of our St. Louis community. We all 
appreciate everything he has done so far and 
look forward to seeing what else he will ac-
complish in the coming years.

JULY VETERAN OF THE MONTH 
HON. KEVIN HERN 
OF OKLAHOMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 26, 2021 
Mr. HERN. Madam Speaker, I rise to honor 
the First District of Oklahoma’s July Veteran of 
the Month, Michael Bell. 
Michael Bell served our country in the 
United States Air Force for over twenty years. 
He worked in Security Forces and retired as a 
Master Sergeant. Throughout his service, he 
was deployed to several military bases around 
the United States and overseas. Upon retire-
ment, Mr. Bell continued to serve and protect 
his community as a member of law enforce-
ment. Michael truly has a heart for serving 
others. 
As a member of law enforcement, Michael 
goes above and beyond to serve his commu-
nity. He was involved with Atlus Public 
School’s Red Ribbon Week program and 
taught their D.A.R.E. program. He served as 
chairman of the Jackson County Tobacco 
Education Committee and President of the 
Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 120. Michael 
currently serves as Chief of Police in Coweta, 
OK. He was recently recognized for saving the 
life of a fellow veteran who was suffering from 
PTSD and contemplating suicide. He is a life 
member of Veterans of Foreign Wars and 
American Legion along with several law en-
forcement organizations. Michael, through his 
compassion for others, has touched so many 
lives in our community and across the globe. 
He answered the call to defend freedom 
and sacrificed whatever was necessary in the 
name of that noble cause. It is my honor to 
recognize Michael Bell as the 1st Congres-
sional District of Oklahoma’s July Veteran of 
the Month.

AVERTING LOSS OF LIFE AND IN-
JURY BY EXPEDITING SIVS ACT 
OF 2021 
SPEECH OF 
HON. JENNIFFER GONZA´LEZ-COLO´ N 
OF PUERTO RICO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 22, 2021 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today in support of H.R. 3985, the bipar-
tisan Afghan ALLIES Act, and to speak on the 
imminent threat facing Afghan translators and 
their families. 
These translators played a critical role in 
serving the United States and helped ensure 
the safety and success of our troops abroad. 
Yet today our allies—and their families—are 
being hunted down and killed by the Taliban 
as it retakes Afghanistan. When our country 
goes to war with its allies, we make a decision 
to bring everyone home, and it is time to bring 
our allies home, Mr. Speaker. 
While I welcome President Biden’s recent 
efforts, notably the initiation of Operation Allies 
Refuge and the announcement this week that 
military bases in Virginia and elsewhere will be 
used to temporarily house evacuating trans-
lators and their families, I remain concerned. 
First: I am concerned by the Administration 
considering temporarily housing evacuees in 
other countries, some of which cannot guar-
antee translators safety. We should not be 
shifting the burden of our responsibility to oth-
ers, especially when so many communities 
around the United States stand ready to wel-
come these heroes with open arms. 
Second, I am concerned at the daunting 
task the State Department now faces. This 
task is exacerbated in no small part by the 
rushed withdrawal timeline set by the adminis-
tration. There are thousands of individuals 
awaiting a safe home—a home that has been 
promised to them by our commonly held val-
ues and through legislation dating back to the 
early days of the War on Terror, legislation we 
now seek to amend. 
H.R. 3985 is designed to meet this moment. 
This bill increases the number of visas by 
8,000 to ensure an adequate number of visas 
are eligible for applicants currently in the pipe-
line. The bill would also remove redundant pa-
perwork while still ensuring applicants go 
through the necessary, strict background 
checks, and national security vetting. Finally, 
the ALLIES Act extends and strengthens pro-
tections for surviving spouses and children of 
deceased SIV applicants. 
Time is running out for our allies. We must 
pass this life-saving legislation before it is too 
late. I encourage our colleagues in the Senate 
to vote on this important legislation.

HONORING PATTEE COLVIN AS A 
28TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT 
WOMAN OF THE YEAR 
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 26, 2021 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in honor of Women’s History Month. Each 
year, we pay special tribute to the contribu-
tions and sacrifices made by our nation’s 
women. It is an honor to pay homage to out-
standing women who are making a difference 
in my Congressional District. I would like to 
recognize a remarkable woman, Pattee Colvin 
in the Sunland neighborhood area of Los An-
geles, California. 
Pattee is the founder of Making It Happen, 
a food and clothing pantry in Sunland whose 
mission is to help those in need. 
Ms. Colvin’s motivation for founding Making 
It Happen is truly inspiring. Pattee worked for 
a local business for many years, but in 1999, 
when she became disabled, she lost her job 
and home. For several years, Pattee lived out-
doors in the rugged Sunland-Tujunga ‘‘wash’’ 
while also maintaining a job at a local answer-
ing service company. As a member of the 
Chapel of the Hills Church in Sunland since 
2002 who lived off the food provided from the 
church’s hot meal program, in 2007, Pattee’s 
life truly turned around, in large part due to the 
church. She enrolled in the church’s Christian 
Sobriety Program, a program that she subse-
quently ran for several years and found new 
employment at Suzuki Insurance Company, a 
local business where she currently works. 
Homeless for many years, Pattee bought her 
own mobile home in Sunland in 2015. 
In 2013, Ms. Colvin created Making It Hap-
pen located at the Chapel of the Hills Church 
in Sunland. Since its inception, Making It Hap-
pen has expanded to include housing assist-
ance and free health clinics. In addition, the 
non-profit participates in events focused on 
community assistance, such as the Homeless 
Connect Days, and supports Sunland-Tujunga 
schools by sponsoring Back-to-School events 
and a Family Christmas Celebration for the 
homeless and underserved children. 
When the coronavirus pandemic began, 
there was an enormous increase in demand 
for food and meals, and their Saturday food 
pantry attendance grew from about 60 individ-
uals and their families to almost 200 individ-
uals and their families. At the height of the 
pandemic, their Sunday Hot Meal program in-
creased from 75 people to 200 people. Step-
ping up to the challenge, the organization 
began offering a weekday lunch program, 
which included meal deliveries, and in re-
sponse 
to 
COVID–19 
safety 
protocols, 
changed the manner in which they serve the 
needy; from a walk-through pantry and seated 
dinners to a drive-through and delivery. 
Along with giving back to the community 
through Making It Happen, Pattee enjoys

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
FIFTH 
ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE MT. CARMEL 
CENTER OF EXCELLENCE 
HON. DOUG LAMBORN 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 26, 2021 
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the fifth anniversary of the 
Mt. Carmel Center of Excellence in Colorado 
Springs, Colorado. A dream of Colorado busi-
nessman Jay Cimino, Mt. Carmel opened its 
doors in 2016 to support our veteran-rich com-
munity in impactful and meaningful ways. 
Their state-of-the-art facility and staff have 
become a cornerstone in the Pikes Peak re-
gion, providing functional, comprehensive care 
to veterans in need. In addition, Mt. Carmel 
Center offers transition and employment as-
sistance for those separating from the military, 
individualized and group counseling and sup-
port, family wellness classes, training, net-
working, and various other services, at little or 
no cost to our veterans through public-private 
community partnerships. 
I congratulate and thank Mr. Cimino, Army 
(COL) Retired Bob McLaughlin, and all of 
those who make Mt. Carmel a reality for vet-
erans in Colorado’s Fifth Congressional Dis-
trict. Their steadfast commitment to giving 
back to the brave men and women who have 
sacrificed so much for our freedoms is unpar-
alleled and unmatched. 
May God Bless the work done at Mt. Car-
mel, may God Bless our veterans, and may 
God Bless America.

IN CELEBRATION OF LIEUTENANT 
COLONEL EDWARD ZAWORA 
HON. JOAQUIN CASTRO 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 26, 2021 
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
today I rise in commemoration of United 
States Army Lieutenant Colonel Edward An-
drew Zawora Sr. who is turning one-hundred 
years old on October 21, 2021. Lieutenant 
Colonel Zawora resides in my hometown of 
San Antonio, Texas, with his wife, Mary Caro-
lyn Peak. This milestone is so joyous for Lieu-
tenant Colonel Zawora and his family, and I 
am honored to celebrate him on this day. 
Lieutenant Colonel Edward Andrew Zawora 
Sr. was born in East Chicago, Indiana, on Oc-
tober 12, 1921. His parents, Joe and Ana 
Zawora emigrated from Poland in 1908 with 
only six dollars. At an early age he dem-
onstrated hard work and resilience, growing 
up as one of six children during a time of fi-
nancial hardship. He held many jobs as a 
young man to support his family, helping them 
make ends meet while attending school. 
Shortly after graduating from high school, 
Lieutenant Colonel Zawora enlisted in the 
United States Army. He moved to Panama 
from East Chicago to complete his basic train-
ing and was assigned to Fort Bliss thereafter. 
During his time in El Paso, the Army observed 
great potential in Lieutenant Colonel Zawora 
and brought him to the White Sands Proving 
Grounds. It was here that the Army was devel-
oping the first missile defense program, as 
well as the first atomic bomb. Lieutenant Colo-
nel Zawora participated in these projects as a 
team member with top secret clearance. 
Lieutenant Colonel Zawora was assigned to 
the Explosive Ordinance Detachment during 
the Korean Conflict, in which he excelled and 
was quickly promoted. He was the youngest 
First Sergeant in the Army when he received 
his stripes. Throughout his career, Lieutenant 
Colonel Zawora participated in courageous as-
signments, such as diving into the ocean in 
order to disarm underwater mines while wear-
ing heavy protective gear. He also served in 
World War II, participating in EOD activities. 
Lieutenant Colonel Zawora served his country 
in two wars and completed duty assignments 
in various parts of the world. In 1966, he re-
tired as the top Army officer assigned to the 
EOD at Fort Monroe, Virginia. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to recognize 
the life and service of a person who dedicated 
themselves to family and country above all 
else. The entire San Antonio community cele-
brates this great milestone of an American 
hero. I thank Lieutenant Colonel Zawora for 
his service, his courage, and for his unending 
commitment to our country.

HONORING 
MARA 
LEONG- 
MAGUINEZ AS A 28TH CONGRES-
SIONAL 
DISTRICT 
WOMAN 
OF 
THE YEAR 
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 26, 2021 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in honor of Women’s History Month. Each 
year, we pay special tribute to the contribu-
tions and sacrifices made by our nation’s 
women. It is an honor to pay homage to out-
standing women who are making a difference 
in my Congressional District. I would like to 
recognize a remarkable woman, Mara Leong- 
Maguinez of Pasadena, California. 
A 
native 
Pasadenan, 
Mara 
attended 
Westridge School, obtained her Bachelor of 
Arts degree in American Studies and Ethnicity 
from the University of Southern California, and 
received her Master of Public Administration 
(MPA), Nonprofit Sector Management degree 
from California State University, Northridge. 
Ms. Leong-Maguinez’s career has been 
dedicated to helping children and families in 
the local community. This began with her 
seven-year employment as Development Di-
rector at the Families Forward Learning Cen-
ter in Pasadena (formerly known as Mothers’ 
Club), an organization that provides two-gen-
eration learning programs to low-income fami-
lies. Mara’s experience at Families Forward in-
creased her passion for providing comprehen-
sive services and inspired her to obtain her 
Master’s in Public Administration and dedicate 
her career to managing community-based or-
ganizations. She then went on to serve as Di-
rector of Development at the Downtown Wom-
en’s Center and Chief Development Officer of 
the Youth Policy Institute. 
In January of 2020, shortly before the 
coronavirus pandemic began, Mara began 
serving as Executive Director of the Ronald 
McDonald House Pasadena. The Ronald 
McDonald House Pasadena, located near 
Huntington Hospital and Shriners for Children 
Medical Center, is a home-away-from-home 
for families with critically ill children who are 
receiving medical treatment, providing these 
families with a comfortable, caring place to 
stay, meals and therapeutic family support 
services at little or no cost to the families. 
When the pandemic hit, Mara worked to im-
plement comprehensive safety and cleaning 
protocols and adjust the physical spaces with-
in the House, while simultaneously obtaining 
funding and gathering support to keep the 
House open during this crucial time, which 
was especially important as several families 
had to stay there for greater lengths of time 
than usual due to the pandemic. 
Mara lives in Pasadena with her husband, 
Roman Maguinez. Along with volunteering for 
Families Forward, Mara enjoys cooking and 
bicycling in the beautiful Pasadena area. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring this exceptional, well-re-
spected woman of California’s 28th Congres-
sional District, Mara Leong-Maguinez.

MS. COURTNEY RENKEN 
RECOGNITION OF SERVICE 
HON. KAY GRANGER 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 26, 2021 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Ms. Courtney Renken, who 
will be leaving my office after seven years of 
distinguished service to the people of Texas 
Congressional District 12. 
Born and raised in North Texas, Courtney 
became involved in her community at an early 
age. From her association with the Inter-
national Order of the Rainbow for Girls, to her 
membership in the Lake Worth chapter of the 
Order of the Eastern Star, to her work with the 
Azle Lions Club, Courtney has pursued every 
opportunity to learn from and support those 
around her. 
In 2014, while attending law school, Court-
ney joined my team. Balancing her schoolwork 
and a research job, she managed to take on 
some of the most detail-oriented duties in my 
office, the kind most people try to avoid. She 
gravitates not to the glamorous tasks, but to 
those that are essential for an organization to 
function smoothly. 
I was finally able to hire Courtney full-time 
after she earned her law degree, from Fort 
Worth’s own Texas A&M University School of

Law. She quickly became an irreplaceable 
part of my office, rising to the role of Deputy 
District Director. Courtney’s responsibilities in-
clude day to day management of my district 
office and ensuring our local office staff stays 
in close touch with our Washington, D.C. staff, 
but her contributions have gone above and 
beyond those required of her position. She is 
always looking for ways to innovate. She led 
the transition of my district office to a digital- 
based, paperless operation, and she was the 
driving force behind practices that led to my 
office winning a Democracy Award for Innova-
tion and Modernization in Constituent Service 
from the Congressional Management Founda-
tion. 
Courtney is known for her hospitality when 
welcoming people to Fort Worth. She has in-
troduced countless visitors to the 12th Dis-
trict’s charms, as well as its workout classes. 
She is always available to her colleagues and 
to constituents, many of whom she calls 
friends, whether it’s to discuss a work issue or 
to try a new local restaurant. Courtney’s work 
ethic shows even in her hobbies. She man-
ages popular social media accounts for both 
her dog and herself. She is a fantastic cook 
and baker, a talent she balances with a dedi-
cation to fitness, including once completing 42 
spin classes in 30 days. Courtney is a world 
traveler, has flown an airplane, and taken a 
ride in a race car going 180 miles per hour 
around the Texas Motor Speedway. 
Courtney will be leaving my office to pursue 
a career in federal law enforcement. As much 
as we will miss her, we are proud of her com-
mitment to public service and will continue to 
support her as she embarks on this new jour-
ney. On behalf of Texas’ 12th Congressional 
District, I offer her congratulations and best 
wishes for the future.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF JOHN 
ANDERSON 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 26, 2021 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, it is with 
great sadness that I rise today to honor the 
life of the late John K. Anderson, of Vernon, 
Connecticut, who passed away suddenly on 
June 16, 2021, at the age of 74. Known by 
family and close friends as Johnny, his military 
service, civic engagement, and devotion to his 
family and the greater Vernon community war-
rants the utmost praise and recognition. 
Born to Merrill and Isabelle Anderson of 
Manchester, Connecticut, John began his 
early years fanning what would become a life 
dedicated to public service. After graduating 
from Manchester High School in 1965, John 
went on to serve in the United States Air 
Force as an Aircraft Maintenance Specialist 
and crew leader. He served overseas in Ger-
many, Taiwan, Vietnam, and Greece before 
receiving an Honorable Discharge and return-
ing home to Connecticut. With his return home 
and affinity for hard work, John hit the ground 
running and opened his own business. His 
business smarts and entrepreneurial spirit 
eventually led him into the automotive trade 
where he joined the team at Bolle’s Motor 
Sales in Ellington, Connecticut. A natural peo-
ple person—John excelled at the dealership 
and fostered strong relationships with his co-
workers and clients. It was this ability to com-
municate naturally with folks from all walks of 
life that led John to dedicate the latter half of 
his life toward building a positive impact on 
the lives of others within his local community. 
From his leadership at the Water Pollution 
Control Authority to being one of Vernon’s 
Registrar of Voters—John embarked on a path 
of serving in municipal government that set his 
legacy as a leader of the public in stone. Dur-
ing part of his tenure, I was the Vernon town 
attorney and had the opportunity to see up 
close his calm practical approach to solving 
problems. With his wealth of knowledge of the 
town and its voting operations, and dedication 
to public service, registrars from around the 
state would go to John with their questions. At 
a time when the integrity of our nation’s elec-
tions has become subject to doubt and con-
troversy, John’s service in recent years was 
particularly valuable. No one questioned his 
performance or work—not for one moment. 
John epitomized what it meant to be a kind 
and caring citizen in a small town and always 
sought opportunities to engage with his com-
munity. John was also known for his regular 
penmanship of editorials in the local news and 
his nuanced perspective on civic issues that 
impacted the community. 
While we remember John as a leader in 
public service—we also remember him as a 
man who truly loved his family, friends, and 
neighbors—a love that drove him to enhance 
his community even further. John, like all of 
us, was someone who filled his life with pas-
sions and hobbies—two of which were base-
ball and golf. An avid Red Sox fan and great 
golfer, John used sports as another avenue to 
connect to his community and was a youth 
baseball coach and a volunteer at the annual 
Thanksgiving Day Manchester Road Race. 
Madam Speaker, it is an honor to represent 
constituents as honorable and impactful as 
John Anderson. While we all mourn his loss, 
we can at least find solace that his memory 
lives on through his surviving family: his chil-
dren Carly, Lauren, Justin and grandchildren; 
sister Carol; brother Rick; and four grand-
children. His life will also continue to live on 
through countless others as the stoic example 
he has set has now been woven into the very 
fabric of the Vernon community. To that end, 
I find it fitting that we, the People’s House, set 
his name and character into the CONGRES-
SIONAL RECORD and ask that the entire House 
join me in recognizing the life of John K. An-
derson, never forgetting his impact on the 
greater Vernon community through his civic 
and military service.

EULOGY FOR SENATOR BIAGIO 
‘‘BILLY’’ CIOTTO 
HON. JOHN B. LARSON 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 26, 2021 
Mr. 
LARSON 
of 
Connecticut. 
Madam 
Speaker, on March 29, 2021, I attended the 
funeral service of Senator Biagio ‘‘Billy’’ Ciotto. 
Billy was a former Connecticut State Senator, 
Deputy DMV Commissioner, and served on 
my District office staff since 2007. One of the 
most unique human beings that I have ever 
had the honor of knowing and working with, 
Billy epitomized what it meant to be a true 
public servant. I am eternally grateful for his 
friendship and his leadership. I wish to include 
in the RECORD my eulogy in honor of Billy’s 
beloved wife Jeanne, and his dear children 
Maria, Julie, Anthony, John and Joey. 
Jeanne, Maria, Julie, Anthony, John and 
Joey. On behalf of Leslie, myself, and the en-
tire Congressional staff—our hearts go out to 
you. The outpouring of people and tributes 
keep coming in. Yet we know nothing or no 
one will ever be able to fully convey the 
depth of the loss you are experiencing. 
As Billy would often say, ‘‘no one knows 
the sacrifice a family endures when they sup-
port and stand with an elected official.’’ So, 
let us first and foremost acknowledge your 
sacrifice and devotion that made it possible 
for all of us to have benefited from Billy’s 
service. His humanity, his humility, and con-
geniality. We thank you for making it all 
possible. 
Billy was unique, one of a kind, and some-
thing that is constant throughout his serv-
ice—whether at the Motor Vehicle Depart-
ment, the State Senate, or Congressional Of-
fice, he greeted people and answered his call 
to public service. His humility, and his hu-
manity ever-present as he answered in that 
unique and distinct cigar voice, ‘‘how may I 
help you?’’ 
‘‘How may I help you?’’ should be part of 
every teaching and training course for public 
officials and staff. For Billy, it came natu-
rally. For him it was effortless and genuine, 
heartfelt, and sincere. It was who he is!! 
Now I’m not saying he was angelic by any 
stretch. He had his faults and an evil side to 
him. He was an ardent devotee and follower 
of an evil empire: He was a Yankee fan. Espe-
cially in 2007, 2013, and 2018. He did celebrate 
in 2009 but through all of 2019 when the Sox 
were cellar dwellers, he would come in the 
office and announce with a cigar hanging 
from the corner of his mouth ‘‘does anyone 
know the standings in the American League 
East, and do the Red Sox still play base-
ball?’’ 
He was the envy of UCONN fans and politi-
cians. He got more TV time sitting right be-
hind the bench of the Men’s and Women’s 
basketball teams at every home game. When 
asked how he got those seats, he said ‘‘it was 
a blessing from St. Paul’’ . . . yeah, St. Paul 
Polo. 
And though devoutly religious, and apos-
tolic, and Catholic, he could be critical of a 
long winded homily in church. I remember 
being at St. Patrick-St. Anthony with the 
family and sitting directly in front of him. 
The priest was going on and on with the 
phrase ‘‘and may Jesus light a fire in your 
heart.’’ It was rather extensive, and I looked 
down and all of a sudden saw my children 
laughing. I immediately gave them the hairy 
eyeball and scornful look. After church when 
we were in the car, I said ‘‘how many times 
have I told you no fooling around in 
church?’’ They said, ‘‘it wasn’t us, it was Mr. 
Ciotto.’’ To which I said, ‘‘Don’t blame Mr. 
Ciotto.’’ They said, ‘‘but Dad, he made fun of 
the priest’s comments’’ and I said ‘‘Mr. 
Ciotto? I don’t believe it.’’ They said, ‘‘well 
you know how the priest was saying may 
Jesus light a fire under your heart?’’ and I 
said ‘‘yes.’’ Well Mr. Ciotto muttered, ‘‘may 
Jesus light a fire under your ass.’’ 
Well Billy was also wise and was willing to 
impart his wisdom on the youthful members 
of our staff. Then Chief of Staff John Rossi 
was thirty and Billy was a youthful seventy- 
nine. Rossi was explaining how he told his 
wife about the important and influential 
people he was meeting with day in and day 
out, and the restaurants and clubs he was 
lunch and dinner at. Billy who listened in-
tently looked at him and said, ‘‘young man

you have an important and responsible posi-
tion. And while I am sure that it’s exciting 
to you and maybe makes you feel good when 
you are lavishing your wife with these expe-
riences, in my opinion you might try han-
dling it a little different. Having some expe-
rience in this field, I think if it were me, 
you’re better off when your wife asks, ‘‘how 
was your day dear?’’ you say ‘‘I was so busy 
I only had time for a tuna fish sandwich.’’ Or 
as he told Kevin Brown often ‘‘old age, expe-
rience, and treachery will defeat youth and 
ambition every time.’’ 
Billy’s obituary was full of the pride he 
had for his Italian heritage and about what 
America had done for him. And with justifi-
able pride acknowledged the journey of his 
parents as well as his own. This was apparent 
with his routine drive past the Motor Vehi-
cle building which bears his name. It does so 
because his parents embedded in him those 5 
simple words: 
‘‘How may I help you?’’ 
He traveled to D.C. back in 2008 and was es-
corted by Linda Christiana. His trip was 
highlighted by dinner at the Italian Embassy 
with Ambassador Castellaneta. When I saw 
the Ambassador weeks later, he remembered 
Billy, and how entertaining and proud he 
was of his Italian heritage. He added, ‘‘he’s 
even invited me to a Bocce tournament that 
I believe is at your house!’’ 
That’s our guy. And we have a letter here 
from the Italian Embassy: 
LETTER FROM THE ITALIAN EMBASSY: 
We, at the Embassy of Italy were deeply 
saddened to learn of the passing of Senator 
Biagio ‘‘Billy’’ Ciotto. In his passing, Con-
necticut, and indeed the whole US, has lost 
a great statesman, and a wonderful Amer-
ican, proud of his Italian origins, which he 
never lost an opportunity to proudly recall. 
The story of Senator Ciotto’s life speaks 
clearly to his many talents and innate 
human touch. His generosity, kindness and 
dedication were a source of inspiration to 
the community whom he served with pas-
sion, honor, and dignity. Senator Ciotto was 
an exemplary civil servant, and whole-
heartedly dedicated himself to serving this 
great Country and his fellow Americans, 
while never forgetting his ancestral land, 
Italy. 
Our sincere condolences go out to Mrs. 
Ciotto, his family, and the entire Italian- 
American and American community at this 
moment of great loss. Senator Ciotto may be 
not with us anymore, but his legacy lives on, 
and will always do so through the many peo-
ple, he touched, and inspired. 
Our thoughts and prayers are with his fam-
ily and friends. 
Grazie, Senator Ciotto. 
The first time he met with Nancy Pelosi 
there was an instant bond. She had broken a 
barrier and was the first woman Speaker of 
the House. And when he met her, bursting 
with pride he said ‘‘Madam Speaker you have 
broken a barrier and as a father with two 
daughters I am so grateful and proud. But as 
a young man, I listened to your father 
Thomas D’Alesandro Jr. He was the first 
Italian Mayor of Baltimore and he had a 
Sunday address, he made us proud of our her-
itage and I listened intently to what he had 
to say. And now his daughter is not only the 
first woman Speaker of the House, but as im-
portant to people of our heritage and faith, 
she is the first Italian.’’ 
The bond between them was instant and 
lasting. A mutual admiration, so much so 
that after an eight year hiatus as Speaker, 
when we recaptured the House and took back 
the majority in 2018, her guest of honor at 
her swearing in was Billy. And with a cigar 
in hand and escorted by Sarah Gianni, he 
took it all in from his front row seat in the 
House Balcony. 
LETTER FROM SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI 
Every now and then, a person comes along 
whose heart is so full of love and whose life 
is so full of kindness that he radiates joy: 
Such a blessed person is Billy Ciotta. Per-
haps he had such generosity of spirit because 
of how his parents raised Biagio and because 
of his happy marriage to Jeanne. 
Everyone loved Billy, because they knew 
that Billy cared. In his work, whether at the 
DMV or in the State Senate, where he served 
with John Larson, whom he loved, he made 
everyone feel important. In taking pride in 
his Italian American heritage, he respected 
others’ pride in theirs. In his faith in God, he 
gave hope and charity to all. Anyone who 
was blessed and shaped by Billy’s friendship 
wanted to live up to his loyalty. 
Billy was in the arms of his loving family 
on March 19, the Feast of Saint Joseph, the 
patron saint of a happy death, very special 
to Italian Americans, and made his passage 
on the 20th. I hope it is a comfort to Jeanne 
and his children Joseph, Anthony, Julia, 
John, and Maria, and their grandchildren 
that so many people mourn their loss and 
are praying for them at this sad time. Billy 
will be sadly missed by all of us who loved 
him. In his life, Billy brought joy to the 
world and now he has brought his humor to 
Heaven. 
Nancy Pelosi, Speaker, United States 
House of Representatives. 
We know heaven will never be the same 
and he’s up there with some pretty good 
company. To be acknowledged and loved by 
the entire community he served and yes to 
have the Italian Ambassador and the Speak-
er of the House eulogize you is pretty im-
pressive. So many words of condolence for 
Jeanne and the family. So many stories— 
therefore our staff will be keeping the 
website open to post on what everyone sends 
to us of your memories with Billy. And 
among the first of those that we have is 
someone who knows something about the 
loss of a beloved one. Jeanne, we have here a 
letter from the President of the United 
States: 
LETTER FROM PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN 
Dear Mrs. Ciotta and Family, Please ac-
cept Jill’s and my heartfelt condolences on 
the passing of your beloved Billy. Your en-
tire family is in our thoughts and prayers. 
I know that this time must be difficult be-
yond words, and you feel like there is a hole 
in your heart. In the hardest of times like 
these, I always turn to family. It is so impor-
tant to be able to share the feeling of envel-
oping grief and to have people you love near-
by to absorb some of the worst pain. 
Billy was a devoted husband and father 
who loved you all immensely. He spent his 
life building and strengthening the Ciotto 
family bonds, which are meant for you to 
lean on during hard times like this. Your 
family shared Billy with Connecticut and 
with the Nation—and thanks to your sac-
rifices, he was able to help our country’s 
most vulnerable. Billy was a true public 
servant. 
Though the grieving process never quite 
ends, it is my hope that you will find com-
fort knowing that Billy will forever be in our 
hearts and memories and those of so many 
whose lives he touched. From experience, I 
promise you the day will come when his 
memory will bring a smile to your lips before 
it brings a tear to your eye. My prayer for 
you and your family is that day comes soon-
er rather than later. 
Sincerely, Joe Biden. 
Billy will always be with us. Provided we 
continue to post and tell those stories we 
fondly remember. The most important way 
he’ll stay with us is if we follow his example 
by saying when we have the opportunity: 
How may I help you? 
CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF SEAN 
CASTLE 
HON. JARED HUFFMAN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 26, 2021 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in celebration of the life of Sean Castle, 
who passed away on June 28, 2021 at the 
age of 43 following an apparent heart attack. 
He was a beloved member of the San Rafael 
community and a dedicated music teacher at 
the local high school. 
Sean was born on March 28, 1978 and at-
tended San Rafael High School in Marin 
County. After graduating from UCLA, he re-
turned to his hometown to teach music. Sean 
helped establish San Rafael High School’s 
award-winning music program, dedicating his 
entire 20-year career to creating a supportive 
and enriching community for students, staff, 
and families. He helped develop and then 
manage the school’s jazz band and a wind en-
semble that played at homecomings and other 
events, and he organized the school’s jazz 
choir and a percussion class called Steel 
Pans. He was respected by staff and aptly re-
ferred to as the ‘‘musical soul’’ of San Rafael 
High School. Sean’s passion for music created 
an environment for youth to grow musically 
and emotionally while exploring their creativity. 
Sean lived a full and vibrant life, dem-
onstrating gratitude and generosity for all 
those with whom he crossed paths. He had a 
passion for camping, golfing, playing back-
gammon, supporting the Giants baseball team, 
and cooking meals for loved ones. Sean is 
survived by his fiance, Nicole Dube; his moth-
er, Kris Castle; his father Kent Castle; and his 
brother Darren Castle. 
Madam Speaker, Sean’s positive impact on 
thousands of individuals will extend well be-
yond his short life. I respectfully ask that you 
join me in extending condolences to Sean’s 
family, friends and innumerable loved ones for 
their unexpected loss and in expressing our 
deep appreciation for his work spearheading a 
program that will continue to educate and in-
spire students for generations to come.

HONORING DR. REBECCA CRANE 
AS A 28TH CONGRESSIONAL DIS-
TRICT WOMAN OF THE YEAR 
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 26, 2021 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in honor of Women’s History Month. Each 
year, we pay special tribute to the contribu-
tions and sacrifices made by our nation’s 
women. It is an honor to pay homage to out-
standing women who are making a difference 
in my Congressional District. I would like to 
recognize a remarkable woman, Dr. Rebecca 
Crane of the Silver Lake neighborhood of Los 
Angeles, California. 
Born in California but raised primarily in 
Connecticut, Rebecca returned to California in 
the late 1980’s where she attended the Uni-
versity of California San Diego graduating with 
a degree in Visual Arts with minors in biology 
and chemistry. After a year of working on an

immunization project in Paraguay and an HIV 
screening clinic in Los Angeles, she attended 
Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston, 
where she obtained her Medical Doctor and 
Master of Public Health degrees. Dr. Crane 
completed her medical residency in combined 
internal medicine and pediatrics in Los Ange-
les and became an attending physician at Kai-
ser Permanente Los Angeles Medical Center, 
where she worked as a primary care physi-
cian, and was a breastfeeding advocate for 
mothers in the newborn nursery. Rebecca 
moved to Urgent Care after several years in 
Family Medicine to accommodate the needs of 
her family and other pursuits. Acting on her 
passion to advance women’s health, Dr. 
Crane led a committee at Kaiser to make the 
hospital a Baby Friendly Hospital. 
Rebecca and her family moved to Silver 
Lake in 2008, where her children attended 
local schools, including Micheltorena Street El-
ementary School. One of Rebecca’s greatest 
accomplishments has been as an active mem-
ber from 2008 to 2015 of Friends of 
Micheltorena, the support group for the school, 
where she helped to revitalize the school and 
bring in a dual-language program, in addition 
to 
being 
a 
founding 
member 
of 
the 
Micheltorena School and Community Garden. 
As an essential frontline worker during the 
coronavirus (COVID–19) pandemic, Rebecca 
has been grateful to be able to serve her com-
munity through this crisis. She experienced 
the fear, sorrow, uncertainty, and exhaustion 
that accompanied most frontline workers at 
the outset of the pandemic, but the fear sub-
sided after treating her first COVID–19 patient 
and she settled into the comfort of work, as 
Kaiser’s Urgent Care was adapted into two 
separate units, with a temporary testing facility 
in the garage. Earlier this year Rebecca as-
sisted in organizing a three-day event at Kai-
ser called ‘‘A Time to Grieve, a Time to Heal,’’ 
to commemorate all the patients, family mem-
bers, and loved ones her fellow healthcare 
workers had lost during the pandemic, and to 
honor all the hospital staff. 
In her spare time, Rebecca enjoys spending 
time with her husband, Jordan and their two 
children, Lucy and Hollis, in addition to hiking, 
camping, and gardening. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring this exceptional, well-re-
spected woman of California’s 28th Congres-
sional District, Dr. Rebecca Crane.

URGENT NEED TO PASS H.R. 40 ES-
TABLISHING A COMMISSION TO 
STUDY AND DEVELOP REPARA-
TION PROPOSALS FOR AFRICAN 
AMERICANS 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 26, 2021 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to speak on the importance of passing H.R. 
40, legislation which I introduced that estab-
lishes a commission to study and develop rep-
aration proposals for African Americans. 
Now—more than ever—the facts and cir-
cumstances facing our Nation demonstrate the 
importance of H.R. 40 and the necessity of 
placing our nation on the path to reparative 
justice. As I speak, H.R. 40 is cosponsored by 
191 Members from all parts of the nation and 
was marked up and reported favorably to the 
House by the Judiciary Committee on April 14, 
2021. In 2019, when the Judiciary Committee 
met to discuss this legislation, three overflow 
rooms were required. Since that time, we have 
seen a pandemic sweep the country, taking 
more than 600,000 souls in its wake and dev-
astating the African American community. Ac-
cording to the latest estimates from the U.S. 
Centers for Disease Control, Black people get 
COVID–19 at a rate nearly one and a half 
times higher than that of white people, are 
hospitalized at a rate nearly four times higher, 
and are three times as likely to die from the 
disease. 
Interestingly, a recent peer-reviewed study 
from Harvard Medical School suggests that 
reparations for African Americans could have 
cut COVID–19 transmission and infection 
rates both among Blacks and the population at 
large. Their analysis, based on Louisiana data, 
determined that if reparations payments had 
been made before the COVID–19 pandemic, 
narrowing the wealth gap, COVID trans-
mission rates in the state’s overall population 
could have been reduced by anywhere from 
31 percent to 68 percent. Last summer we 
saw hundreds of thousands peacefully take to 
the streets in support of Black Lives and ac-
countability for law enforcement. Many of 
those protesters carried signs in support of 
H.R. 40 and made the important link between 
policing and the movement for reparative jus-
tice. Tragically, we have also witnessed insur-
rectionists attack this institution, brandishing 
symbols of division and intolerance, that echo 
back to the darkest periods of our nation’s his-
tory. Clearly, we require a reckoning to restore 
national balance and unity. 
Four hundred years ago, ships set sail from 
the west coast of Africa and in the process, 
began one of mankind’s most inhumane prac-
tices: human bondage and slavery. For two 
centuries, human beings—full of hopes and 
fears, dreams and concerns, ambition, and an-
guish—were transported onto ships like chat-
tel, and the lives of many forever changed. 
The reverberations from this horrific series of 
acts—a transatlantic slave trade that touched 
the shores of a colony that came to be known 
as America, and later a democratic republic 
known as the United States of America—are 
unknown and worthy of exploration. 
Approximately 4,000,000 Africans and their 
descendants were enslaved in the United 
States and colonies that became the United 
States from 1619 to 1865. The institution of 
slavery was constitutionally and statutorily 
sanctioned by the Government of the United 
States from 1789 through 1865. American 
Slavery is our country’s Original Sin and its 
existence at the birth of our nation is a perma-
nent scar on our country’s founding docu-
ments, and on the venerated authors of those 
documents, and it is a legacy that continued 
well into the last century. The framework for 
our country and the document to which we all 
take an oath describes African Americans as 
three-fifths a person. The infamous Dred Scott 
decision of the United States Supreme Court, 
issued just a few decades later, described 
slaves as private property, unworthy of citizen-
ship. And, a civil war that produced the largest 
death toll of American fighters in any conflict 
in our history could not prevent the indignities 
of Jim Crow, the fire hose at lunch counters 
and the systemic and institutional discrimina-
tion that would follow for a century after the 
end of the Civil War. 
The mythology built around the Civil War 
has obscured our discussions of the impact of 
chattel slavery and made it difficult to have a 
national dialogue on how to fully account for 
its place in American history and public policy. 
While it is nearly impossible to determine how 
the lives touched by slavery could have flour-
ished in the absence of bondage, we have 
certain datum that permits us to examine how 
a subset of Americans—African Americans— 
have been affected by the callousness of in-
voluntary servitude. We know that in almost 
every 
segment 
of 
society—education, 
healthcare, jobs, and wealth—the inequities 
that persist in America are more acutely and 
disproportionately felt in Black America. This 
historic discrimination continues: African-Amer-
icans continue to suffer debilitating economic, 
educational, and health hardships including 
but not limited to having nearly 1,000,000 
black people incarcerated; an unemployment 
rate more than twice the current white unem-
ployment rate; and an average of less than 
1⁄16 of the wealth of white families, a disparity 
which has worsened, not improved over time. 
A closer look at the statistics reveals the stark 
disparity in these areas. 
Black household wealth is less than one fifth 
of the national average. The median black 
household had a net worth of just $17,600 in 
2016. Yet in that same year, the median white 
household held $171,000 in wealth while the 
national household median was $97,300. The 
black unemployment rate is 6.6 percent, more 
than double the national unemployment rate. 
Approximately 31 percent of black children live 
in poverty, compared to 11 percent of white 
children. The national average is 18 percent, 
which suggests that the percentage of black 
children living in poverty is more than 150 per-
cent of the national average. 
In the healthcare domain, the disparities suf-
fered by African Americans is also troubling. 
Over 20 percent of African Americans do not 
have health insurance, compared to a national 
average between 8.8 percent and 9.1 percent. 
One in four African American women are unin-
sured. Compared to the national average, Afri-
can American adults are 20 percent more like-
ly to suffer from asthma and three times more 
likely to die from it. Black adults are 72 per-
cent more likely to suffer from diabetes than 
average. Black women are four times more 
likely to die from pregnancy related causes, 
such as embolisms, and pregnancy-related hy-
pertension, than any other racial group. In our 
nation, among children aged 19–35 months, 
black children were vaccinated at rates lower 
than white children: 68 percent versus 78 per-
cent, respectively. 
Education has often been called the key to 
unlocking social mobility. African American 
students are less likely than white students to 
have access to college-ready courses. In fact, 
in 2011–12, only 57 percent of black students 
have access to a full range of math and 
science courses necessary for college readi-
ness, compared to with 81 percent of Asian 
American students and 71 percent of white 
students. Black students spend less time in 
the classroom due to discipline, which further 
hinders their access to a quality education. 
Black students are nearly two times as likely 
to be suspended without educational services 
as white students. Black students are also 3.8 
times as likely to receive one or more out-of- 
school suspensions as white students.

In addition, black children represent 19 per-
cent of the nation’s pre-school population, yet 
47 percent of those receiving more than one 
out-of-school 
suspension. 
In 
comparison, 
white students represent 41 percent of pre- 
school enrollment but only 28 percent of those 
receiving more than one out-of-school suspen-
sion. Even more troubling, black students are 
2.3 times as likely to receive a referral to law 
enforcement or be subject to a school-related 
arrest as white students. School districts with 
the most students of color, on average, re-
ceive 15 percent less per student in state and 
local funding than the whitest districts. 
And, of course, we cannot consider the dis-
parities between black and white in America 
without considering the intersection of African 
Americans and the Criminal Justice system. 
There are more Black men in bondage today 
who are incarcerated or under correctional 
control, than there were black men who were 
enslaved in the 1800s. The United States 
locks up African American males at a rate 5.8 
times higher than the most openly racist coun-
try in the world ever did: South Africa under 
apartheid (1993), African American males: 851 
per 100,000 and United States (2006), African 
American males: 4,789 per 100,000 
Incarceration is not an equal opportunity 
punishment. For example, incarceration rates 
in the United States by race were: African 
Americans: 2,468 per 100,000; Latinos: 1,038 
per 100,000; Whites: 409 per 100,000. African 
American offenders receive sentences that are 
10 percent longer than white offenders for the 
same crimes and are 21 percent more likely to 
receive mandatory-minimum sentences than 
white defendants according to the U.S. Sen-
tencing Commission. 
Looking at males aged 25–29 and by race, 
you can see what is going on even clearer: 
For White males ages 25–29: 1,685 per 
100,000; For Latino males ages 25–29: 3,912 
per 100,000; For African American males ages 
25–29: 11,695 per 100,000. (That’s 11.7 per-
cent of Black men in their late 20s.) Looking 
at males aged 25–29 and by race, you can 
see what is going on even clearer: For white 
males ages 25–29: 1,685 per 100,000; For 
Latino males ages 25–29: 3,912 per 100,000; 
for African American males ages 25–29: 
11,695 per 100,000. (That’s 11.7 percent of 
Black men in their late 20s.) 
And African Americans are more likely to be 
victims of crimes. Black children die from fire-
arm homicides at a rate 10 times higher than 
their white counterparts. Overall, one in 50 
murders is ruled justified—but when the killer 
is white and the victim is a black man, the fig-
ure climbs to one in six. A handgun homicide 
is nine times more likely to be found justified 
when the killer is white and the victim is a 
black man. Handgun killings with a white 
shooter and a black male victim exhibit an 
even more dramatic bias: one in four is found 
justified. But then again, we knew these in-
equities existed because for many Black 
Americans, these disparities are just a part of 
daily life. Examined in the aggregate, they rep-
resent a stunning chasm between the des-
tinies of White America and that of Black 
America. This is why, in 1989, my prede-
cessor as the most senior African American 
on this august Judiciary Committee, the honor-
able John Conyers, a past Chairman of this 
Committee introduced H.R. 40, legislation that 
would establish a commission to study and 
develop proposals attendant to reparations. 
Though many thought it a lost cause, John 
Conyers believed that a day would come 
when our nation would need to account for the 
brutal mistreatment of African-Americans dur-
ing chattel slavery, Jim Crow segregation and 
the enduring structural racism endemic to our 
society. I would like to take this moment to 
personally thank the estimable John Conyers 
for his work on this legislation for the last thirty 
years. With the rise and normalization of white 
supremacist expression during the Trump ad-
ministration, the discussion of H.R. 40 and the 
concept of restorative justice have gained 
more urgency, garnering the attention of main-
stream commentator, and illustrating the need 
for a national reckoning. H.R. 40 is intended to 
create the framework for a national discussion 
on the enduring impact of slavery and its com-
plex legacy to begin that necessary process of 
atonement. 
For many, it was not until The Atlantic pub-
lished Ta-Nehisi Coates’ The Case for Rep-
arations that the mainstream public began to 
reckon with, or even consider, the concept of 
reparations. Though the Federal government 
has been slow to engage the issue of repara-
tions, individuals, corporations, and other pub-
lic institutions have engaged the discussion 
out of both necessity and conscience. In 1994, 
a group of California plaintiffs sued the Fed-
eral government and by 2002, nine lawsuits 
were filed around the country by the Restitu-
tion Study Group. Though litigation has yield-
ed only mixed success in court, a serious 
foundation was laid for alternative forms of 
restitution. For example, in 2005, J.P. Morgan 
& Company tried to make amends for its role 
in the slave trade with an apology and a $5 
million, five-year scholarship fund for Black un-
dergraduates in Louisiana. 
In 2008, the Episcopal Church apologized 
for perpetuating American slavery through its 
interpretation of the Bible and certain diocese 
have implemented restitution programs. In 
2003, Brown University created the Committee 
on Slavery and Justice to assess the Univer-
sity’s role in slavery and determine a re-
sponse. Similarly, in 2016, Georgetown Uni-
versity apologized for its historical links to 
slavery and said it would give an admissions 
edge to descendants of slaves whose sale in 
the 19th century helped pay off the U.S. 
school’s debts. In 2017, my alma mater, Yale 
University, announced that it would rename 
Calhoun College—named for John C. Cal-
houn—would be changed to honor Grace Mur-
ray Hopper, a trailblazing computer scientist 
who also served as rear admiral in the United 
States Navy. The University’s president, Peter 
Salovey, indicated that removing Calhoun’s 
name was consistent with its values because 
Calhoun had a legacy of a white supremacist 
and a national leader who passionately pro-
moted slavery as a positive good. And, in April 
of this year, students at Georgetown Univer-
sity voted in favor of paying reparations to the 
descendants of enslaved people who were 
sold by the university to satisfy its debts. 
In 1838, in a practice likely far wider spread 
than is likely accounted for, Georgetown Jesu-
its sold 272 slaves who worked on plantations. 
When the results of the Georgetown poll were 
announced, the numbers were overwhelming: 
2⁄3 of students indicated that payments should 
be funded to descendants of these slaves and 
would be paid for by a fee that would apply to 
all undergraduate students. While the vote 
was nonbinding, it nonetheless represents the 
first time the student body of a university has 
voted to implement a mandatory fee to ac-
count for reparations. These are only a few 
examples of how private institution have 
begun reckoning with their past records. I ex-
pect that a growing number of institutions will 
be forced to examine their histories of dis-
crimination, if for no other reason than in-
creasing public scrutiny will force their history 
to light. 
Since my reintroduction of H.R. 40 at the 
beginning of this Congress, both the legisla-
tion and concept of reparations have become 
the focus of national debate. For many, it is 
apparent that the success of the Obama ad-
ministration has unleashed a backlash of rac-
ism and intolerance that is an echo of Amer-
ica’s dark past which has yet to be exorcised 
from the national consciousness. Commenta-
tors have turned to H.R. 40 as a response to 
formally begin the process of analyzing, con-
fronting, and atoning for these dark chapters 
of American history. Even conservative voices, 
like that of New York Times columnist David 
Brooks, are starting to give the reparations 
cause the hearing it deserves, observing that 
‘‘Reparations are a drastic policy and hard to 
execute, but the very act of talking and de-
signing them heals a wound and opens a new 
story.’’ 
Similarly, a majority of the Democratic presi-
dential contenders have turned to H.R 40 as 
a tool for reconciliation, with 17 cosponsoring 
or claiming they would sign the bill into law if 
elected. Though critics have argued that the 
idea of reparations is unworkable politically or 
financially, their focus on money misses the 
point of the H.R. 40 commission’s mandate. 
The goal of these historical investigations is to 
bring American society to a new reckoning 
with how our past affects the current condi-
tions of African Americans and to make Amer-
ica a better place by helping the truly dis-
advantaged. Consequently, the reparations 
movement does not focus on payments to in-
dividuals, but to remedies that can be created 
in as many forms necessary to equitably ad-
dress the many kinds of injuries sustained 
from 
chattel 
slavery 
and 
its 
continuing 
vestiges. To merely focus on finance is an 
empty gesture and betrays a lack of under-
standing of the depth of the unaddressed 
moral issues that continue to haunt this nation. 
While it might be convenient to assume that 
we can address the current divisive racial and 
political climate in our nation through race 
neutral means, experience shows that we 
have not escaped our history. Though the Civil 
Rights Movement challenged many of the 
most racist practices and structures that sub-
jugated the African American community, it 
was not followed by a commitment to truth 
and reconciliation. For that reason, the legacy 
of racial inequality has persisted, and left the 
nation vulnerable to a range of problems that 
continue to yield division, racial disparities, 
and injustice. By passing H.R. 40, Congress 
can start a movement toward the national 
reckoning we need to bridge racial divides. 
Reparations are ultimately about respect and 
reconciliation—and the hope that one day, all 
Americans can walk together toward a more 
just future. 
We owe it to those who were ripped from 
their homes those many years ago an ocean 
away; we owe it to the millions of Americans- 
yes, they were Americans—who were born 
into bondage, knew a life of servitude, and

died anonymous deaths, as prisoners of this 
system. We owe it to the millions of descend-
ants of these slaves, for they are the heirs to 
a society of inequities and indignities that nat-
urally filled the vacuum after slavery was for-
mally abolished 154 years ago. The Judiciary 
Committee hearing held in the 116th Congress 
was the first time in history that the House of 
Representatives held a hearing on H.R. 40, 
we held another earlier this year on February 
17, 2021, before marking up this landmark 
legislation on April 14, 2021. It was fitting that 
the first hearing occurred on the 19th of June, 
also known to many in this room, as 
Juneteenth—the day that, 154 years ago, 
General Gordon Granger rode into Galveston, 
Texas and announced the freedom of the last 
American slaves; belatedly freeing 250,000 
slaves in Texas nearly two and a half years 
after Abraham Lincoln signed the Emanci-
pation Proclamation. 
Juneteenth was first celebrated in the Texas 
state capital in 1867 under the direction of the 
Freedmen’s Bureau. Juneteenth was and is a 
living symbol of freedom for people who did 
not have it. Today, Juneteenth now is both the 
oldest known celebration of slavery’s demise 
and the nation’s newest national holiday. It 
commemorates freedom while acknowledging 
the sacrifices and contributions made by cou-
rageous African Americans towards making 
our great nation the more conscious and ac-
cepting country that it has become. Let me 
end by noting that the recently passed 400th 
commemoration of the 1619 arrival of the first 
captive Africans in English North America, at 
Point Comfort, Virginia. With those dates as 
an historical marker for today’s hearing, let us 
proceed to the work of repair with free hands, 
full hearts, and a passion for achieving justice. 
Let us also do the work in the spirit of rec-
onciliation and understanding that H.R. 40 rep-
resents.

RECOGNIZING THE EASTPOINTE 
FIRE AND RESCUE DEPARTMENT 
HON. ANDY LEVIN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 26, 2021 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize the Eastpointe Fire 
and Rescue Department, which is celebrating 
its 100th year of service to the community of 
Eastpointe. 
This Fire Department started from humble 
beginnings in 1921, when Eastpointe was 
known as the Village of Halfway. Local fire-
men used hand-pulled hose carts, a model T 
truck and pure grit to protect their small com-
munity. Over the decades, the Fire Depart-
ment adapted to meet the needs of the city’s 
growing population. 
Firefighters banded together in 1946 to raise 
funds for the city’s first ambulance, and in 
1956, the city built the fire station, which con-
tinues to serve citizens of Eastpointe today. In 
recent decades the Fire and Rescue Depart-
ment has made huge advances in prehospital 
care. Today, Eastpointe Fire and Rescue op-
erates two advanced life support fire engines 
that bring state-of-the-art emergency medical 
services straight to the scene. 
But one cannot recognize the Eastpointe 
Fire and Rescue Department without acknowl-
edging the brave individuals who work every 
day to keep residents safe. Twenty-some 
paramedics and fire staff stand at the ready to 
serve the community of Eastpointe 24 hours a 
day, 365 days a year. I am exceptionally 
proud to have the honor of recognizing them 
today and to mark this important centennial for 
the city of Eastpointe. Congratulations on one 
hundred years of service.’’

RECOGNIZING THE COLLIN COUN-
TY SOIL & WATER CONSERVA-
TION DISTRICT 
HON. VAN TAYLOR 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 26, 2021 
Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, today, I ask 
my colleagues to join me in recognizing the 
Collin County Soil & Water Conservation Dis-
trict (CCSWCD) on their 75th Anniversary. 
The mission of the Texas State and Water 
Conservation Board is to work in conjunction 
with local Soil and Water Conservation Dis-
tricts (SWCDs) in order to encourage the wise 
and productive use of natural resources, en-
suring needs are met for future generations in 
a manner that promotes a clean, healthy envi-
ronment, and strong economic growth. As 
such, on August 12, 1946, the Texas Sec-
retary of State signed and sealed the Certifi-
cate of Organization for the Collin County Soil 
Conservation District No. 535. 
The Collin County Soil & Water Conserva-
tion District, is a locally organized, self-gov-
erning body tasked with ‘‘preserving natural 
resources, controlling floods, preventing im-
pairments of dams and reservoirs, assisting in 
maintaining the navigability of rivers and har-
bors, and promoting the health, safety, and 
general welfare of the people of this state.’’ 
In addition to the many functions and re-
sponsibilities of the CCSWCD, they also serve 
a valuable role by planning measures to pre-
vent the flooding of thousands of acres of rich 
soil in Collin County, hosting local work group 
meetings to address natural resource con-
servation needs at a local level, and working 
with local landowners to develop water quality 
management plans to address non-point 
source pollution in the Lake Lavon watershed. 
Now upon this milestone anniversary, I con-
gratulate the Collin County Soil & Water Con-
servation District and wish them continued 
success as they meet the local needs of Collin 
County while ensuring the conservation of our 
most valuable resources.

HONORING LORI ROSALES AS A 
28TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT 
WOMAN OF THE YEAR 
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 26, 2021 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in honor of Women’s History Month. Each 
year, we pay special tribute to the contribu-
tions and sacrifices made by our nation’s 
women. It is an honor to pay homage to out-
standing women who are making a difference 
in my Congressional District. I would like to 
recognize a remarkable woman, Lori Rosales 
of the Atwater Village neighborhood of Los 
Angeles, California. 
Born and raised in Colorado, Ms. Rosales 
attended the University of Northern Colorado 
and received her Master’s in Education with 
Administration 
Credentials 
from 
Loyola 
Marymount University. With a firm belief that 
all children need to be educated fairly and are 
valued, to that end, she has spent nearly two 
decades in education: as an elementary 
school teacher, a high school principal, an 
educational consultant, and in her current po-
sition working for the University of California 
Los Angeles Center X Math Project. 
It is motherhood and her volunteer career 
with Friends of Atwater Elementary (FoAE), a 
parent support group for Atwater Elementary 
School, that are the most near and dear to 
Lori’s heart. A longtime Atwater Village resi-
dent, for the last four years, Lori has served 
as president of FoAE, bringing her community- 
building skills to the organization. Under her 
stellar leadership, she organized and suc-
ceeded in the effort to bring the Spanish Dual 
Language Immersion Program to the school, 
an effort she considers her greatest accom-
plishment. In addition, FoAE raised funds for 
beautification and projects such as the Innova-
tion Lab, the garden program, the installation 
of new murals, and a bilingual math program. 
During the coronavirus pandemic, Ms. 
Rosales organized volunteers to sort and pack 
books so all the school’s children would re-
ceive books to read at home, sent 350 stuffed 
animal bears (Cubby the Bear is Atwater Ele-
mentary School’s mascot) to the children for 
emotional support, and fundraised for school 
supplies for each child in the 2020–2021

school year. Additionally, when the school be-
came aware of a few families who experi-
enced the loss of loved ones or employment 
loss due to the pandemic, they contacted Lori, 
who swiftly responded, gathering financial do-
nations from neighbors in the community for 
those families, enabling neighbors to become 
directly involved in helping their neighbors. 
Lori is married to her college sweetheart 
from Colorado, Craig Rosales, and they have 
three children: Estes, Tyson, and Vinny. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring this exceptional, well-re-
spected woman of California’s 28th Congres-
sional District, Lori Rosales.

IN RECOGNITION OF MIGUEL 
CONCHAS 
HON. HENRY CUELLAR 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 26, 2021 
Mr. CUELLAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the career and achievements of 
Miguel A. Conchas, one of Laredo’s pre-
eminent business leaders and a distinguished 
member of our community. Miguel has served 
for 29 years as President of the Laredo Cham-
ber of Commerce, nourishing and advancing 
the quality of business, economic vitality, and 
community standards. Our city has undoubt-
edly flourished because of his outstanding en-
thusiasm and commitment to his work. 
Mr. Conchas began his career as an Ele-
mentary school teacher and served as an Ad-
ministrator for the College of Education at La-
redo State University. His fondness for teach-
ing unquestionably influenced his success in 
training and cultivating local business develop-
ment. After his career in education Miguel 
served as the Laredo Convention and Visitors 
Bureau Director, targeting promotional pro-
grams to improve Laredo tourism. 
Appropriately, his impressive career as 
President of the Chamber includes a long list 
of awards, often recognizing his success and 
diligence in trade and business expansion in 
Laredo. He received monumental recognition 
from state and federal leaders for his activism 
for NAFTA, which was instrumental in the leg-
islation becoming law. 
Throughout his long career, Mr. Conchas 
has sought to better his city through edu-
cation, activism, and professional develop-
ment. He and I have worked closely over the 
years on trade projects, and I consider him a 
close friend. Miguel is the embodiment of hard 
work and optimism, and I wish him a long and 
very happy retirement with his wife, Cynthia. 
May this ending bring many new beginnings 
for him and his family.

IN HONOR OF VIVIAN CREIGHTON 
BISHOP 
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 26, 2021 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, it 
is with great pride and admiration that I rise 
today to honor and commend an extraordinary 
public servant, wife, mother, political operative 
and friend to many, The Honorable Vivian 
Creighton Bishop, upon her retirement as the 
elected Clerk of The Municipal Court of Co-
lumbus, Georgia. Ms. Bishop retired on De-
cember 31, 2020 after 28 years of distin-
guished service. Due to the COVID–19 pan-
demic, a retirement celebration was delayed 
and combined with a belated birthday party 
that was held at 6:30 pm on July 23, 2021 at 
Warehouse Nine, 920 9th Street, Columbus, 
Georgia. 
Vivian Francine Creighton was born July 9, 
1951 to the late Frank Richard Creighton and 
Evelyn Rushin Creighton at Martin Army Hos-
pital, Fort Benning, Georgia. Because her fa-
ther was a career noncommissioned officer in 
the United States Army, she and her older sis-
ter, Jacqueline and her younger brother Frank, 
Jr. as military dependents lived and traveled in 
multiple places across the United States and 
abroad. Vivian graduated high school in 
Wurzburg, Germany, but frequently during her 
childhood and adolescence, the family lived in 
Columbus, Georgia where she and her sib-
lings would attend school. Following gradua-
tion in 1969, she was accepted to the Univer-
sity of Maryland Campus in Wurzburg but had 
to withdraw when her father received orders 
for Viet Nam. She attended Columbus Tech-
nical College, Atlanta Junior College and 
Georgia State University. After perfect scores 
on the Georgia State Merit Exams she se-
cured employment in Atlanta with the Depart-
ment of Family and Childrens’ Services and 
later with the Georgia State Department of 
Education where she managed Human Re-
sources for Georgia Public Television. 
In 1999 she married Meldon Owens and 
they produced a daughter, Aayesha. They 
moved to Columbus where she was hired as 
an Accounting Clerk in Operations and Pur-
chasing at Jack T. Rutledge State Prison 
where she rose through the ranks to become 
comptroller at the Prison, being among the 
first African Americans and females to do so 
at the Georgia Department of Corrections. Al-
though her marriage ended in divorce, she 
worked hard in her career and was named 
Georgia Department of Corrections ‘‘Employee 
of the Year for Administrative Support’’ after 
she developed an innovative program for man-
aging inmate accounts that was utilized sys-
tem wide. After 16 years, Vivian left State gov-
ernment to become an entrepreneur, opening 
a gift and flower shop, ‘‘Baskets of Delight.’’ 
In 1992, Vivian was asked by a friend who 
was a victim of domestic violence to go with 
her to get a warrant from the Municipal Court 
of Columbus, Georgia. Witnessing the rude 
treatment she was receiving from Court em-
ployees, Vivian questioned their conduct and 
was told that if she did not like the way the of-
fice was being run she should run for it her-
self. And run she did. Vivian Creighton was 
elected countywide and became the first Afri-
can American female to win countywide office 
in Muscogee County, Georgia—a position she 
held for 28 years. As Clerk she reorganized 
the office to maximize customer service, pro-
mote efficiency and achieved flawless audits 
with special recognition noted to City Council 
regarding her exit audit. During her years as 
Clerk she was loved and respected by all who 
used the court as being competent, kind, com-
passionate and helpful. 
In 2001, Vivian Creighton married yours 
truly, Congressman SANFORD BISHOP, after a 
long courtship. We recently celebrated our 
20th wedding anniversary, having survived as 
a political couple in spite of conflicting views. 
She was Co-Chair of the Georgia Hillary Clin-
ton Presidential Campaign and I was Co-Chair 
of the Georgia Barack Obama Presidential 
Campaign. In her own right she helped elect 
countless state and local officials including 
me, mentored others and is constantly sought 
out for political advice and counsel. 
Vivian was elected President of the Con-
gressional Black Caucus Spouses. She was 
the first Georgian and the only African Amer-
ican elected President of the prestigious Con-
gressional Club, the Congressionally Char-
tered bi-partisan organization of the spouses 
of members of Congress, ambassadors, Su-
preme Court Justices, and Cabinet secre-
taries. She chaired the annual ‘‘First Lady’s 
Luncheon’’ with First Lady Michelle Obama. 
Moreover, she raised over$ I million for the 
National March of Dimes Gala and won top 
awards as a celebrity chef. 
On the local level Vivian has been active in 
numerous groups, including NAACP, Rotary 
Club, Girls Inc., The Links, Inc., American 
Cancer Society, Muscogee Democratic Party 
and more. She is a longtime member of M.L. 
Harris United Methodist Church although she 
regularly attends Mount Zion Baptist Church of 
Albany, Georgia wherein I am a Deacon. 
Vivian has accomplished much in her life 
but it would not have been possible without 
the continuous love and support of her fam-
ily—daughter, 
Aayesha; 
granddaughter, 
Londyn; sister, Jacqueline, nieces, nephews, 
cousins and legions of friends, all of whom 
love her dearly. And beyond the shadow of a 
doubt, she is the love of my life. 
It has been said that ‘‘Service is the rent we 
pay for the space we occupy on this earth.’’ 
Vivian Creighton Bishop has paid her rent and 
paid it well. She has done so much for so 
many for so long. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues 
of the House of Representatives join me, 
along with the more 730,000 people of the 
2nd Congressional District in honoring and 
commending The Honorable Vivian Creighton 
Bishop for her outstanding career of public 
service and her many contributions to her 
community, her State and this nation. Best 
wishes to her as she enters this new chapter 
of her life.

ANNIVER-
SARY OF COLORADO SPRINGS, 
COLORADO 
HON. DOUG LAMBORN 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 26, 2021 
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the heart of Colorado’s Fifth 
Congressional District, Colorado Springs, Col-
orado. This July 31st, we celebrate 150 years 
since General William Jackson Palmer, a Civil 
War hero and railroad magnate, founded Colo-
rado Springs in 1871. 
The region’s first inhabitants were Native 
Americans, such as the Ute, Cheyenne, Arap-
aho, and many others. They gathered at the 
base of Pikes Peak, known today as Amer-
ica’s Mountain, near its abundant springs in 
what is now called Garden of the Gods Park. 
As they followed vast herds of bison, the Ute

would camp in nearby red rock canyon and 
visit the bubbling mineral water springs we still 
enjoy today. 
The region lies along the extreme south-
western edge of the Louisiana Territory, which 
President Thomas Jefferson purchased in 
1803. Following the Louisiana Purchase, ex-
plorers and settlers began to venture west. 
In November 1806, American explorer 
Zebulon Pike traveled through the area and 
was credited for ‘‘discovering’’ Pikes Peak. He 
and his group attempted to reach the summit, 
but they were neither dressed nor equipped to 
climb the mountain that ultimately came to 
bear his name. 
General William Jackson Palmer ushered in 
a new era of Colorado Springs history in 1869. 
During his first visit to the area, he fell in love 
with its ‘‘most enticing scenery.’’ In 1870, 
Palmer wrote to his wife: ‘‘Could one live in 
constant view of these grand mountains with-
out being elevated by them into a lofty plane 
of thought and purpose?’’ 
In the 1890s, one of the richest gold strikes 
in American history was discovered on the 
western slope of Pikes Peak. Almost over-
night, the Cripple Creek Mining District grew 
from an isolated cattle pasture to the home of 
more than 50,000 people. As a result, by the 
turn of the 19th century, Colorado Springs was 
called ‘‘the city of millionaires.’’ 
One of these millionaires was Spencer 
Penrose, who made his first fortune in Cripple 
Creek. He used his vast resources to build the 
Pikes Peak and Cheyenne Mountain High-
ways and to establish the Cheyenne Mountain 
Zoo, Will Rogers Shrine, and The Broadmoor 
Hotel. In addition, he and his wife, Julie, cre-
ated the El Pomar Foundation, which still gen-
erously supports many worthy causes in the 
Pikes Peak region and across Colorado. 
At the turn of the century, inspired by a trip 
to the summit of Pikes Peak, Katharine Lee 
Bates penned what has become our country’s 
most famous poem and song, ‘‘America the 
Beautiful.’’ 
In the 1940s, the U.S. Army opened Camp 
Carson, marking the beginning of a strong and 
vital military presence in the Pikes Peak re-
gion. In 1954, the Air Force broke ground for 
the United States Air Force Academy to con-
tinue this military tradition. Today, Colorado 
Springs is home to major military installations, 
including Fort Carson, Peterson Air Force 
Base, the U.S. Space Command, NORAD 
(North American Aerospace Defense Com-
mand), Schriever Air Force Base, and the 
United States Air Force Academy. 
In 1978, Colorado Springs became home to 
the United States Olympic and Paralympic 
Committee Headquarters. In addition, over 20 
National Olympic governing bodies, more than 
50 national sport organizations, the Colorado 
Springs Olympic and Paralympic Training 
Center, and the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic 
Museum reside in the Pikes Peak region. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues 
in the House of Representatives join me in 
celebrating this great city’s legacy and rich 
history. Out of humble beginnings and culture- 
rich traditions, Colorado Springs has grown to 
be a destination location for world-class ath-
letes, nature lovers, families, and adventure 
seekers. 
Congratulations to Colorado Springs on their 
150th anniversary. May God Bless them, and 
may God Bless America.

Barnes. I wish to include in the RECORD my 
eulogy for Wally’s wife, former U.S. Secretary 
of Commerce Barbara Franklin, who served 
our Nation with distinction. I will always treas-
ure Wally’s friendship and am grateful for his 
leadership in Connecticut and across the Na-
tion. 
Barbara, Tom and Melanie, Jarre and 
Whit, the entire Barnes family—what an 
honor to be part of this tribute to Wally. 
COVID has certainly turned our lives up-
side down, and while time doesn’t ease his 
passing, it has provided us time to reflect on 
the man. Even at 94, he was still an immense 
resource, whose advice was widely sought by 
business and civic leaders. 
In this state—the land of steady habits; a 
state of sturdy Oaks—he was a Giant Se-
quoia. I guess when you ’re a direct descend-
ent of Ebenezer Barnes, the first settler of 
Bristol, one could argue that Wally was the 
embodiment of the concept of ‘‘Noblesse 
Oblige.’’ 
And that obligation started with love of 
family and carried over to his beloved com-
munity of Bristol, the State of Connecticut, 
and our great Nation. Any examination of 
his life in general—both in and out of public 
office—quickly demonstrates that public 
service was not some avocation, or hobby for 
Wally, it was a way of life. 
A value he cherished, practiced, and nur-
tured in his family, his community, his 
state, and nation. And was reflected in his 
business, civic, and charitable endeavors. I 
was fortunate to first meet Wally when I was 
in the Connecticut Senate. We shared that 
common experience of being a part of ‘‘The 
Circle.’’ 
As many know, the State Senate is called 
the Circle because of its geometric shape, 
but also because unlike the House of Rep-
resentatives, we sit in a circle of peers, nei-
ther distinguished by rank or political affili-
ation . . . as equals. 
We chuckled over his famous ‘‘Nikita 
Khrushchev moment.’’ This Republican scion 
of the Prescott Bush era was hardly a 
Nikita—but his actions worked. He got the 
public’s and press’ attention and made us all 
remember that it’s important not to abuse 
the rights of the minority. 
He first ran for Congress in 1954 against 
Thomas J. Dodd, and I would like to read a 
letter to you Barbara from someone familiar 
with that race: 
LETTER FROM SENATOR CHRIS DODD 
Dear Barbara, I sincerely regret that I can-
not be with you in person today to celebrate 
Wally’s life. He was a good friend. 
Wally and I enjoyed a warm relationship 
spanning many decades. Like so many oth-
ers, I admired Wally, I appreciated his coun-
sel, advice, and support. I was also thankful 
for his willingness to clearly share his 
views—when we agreed and when we dis-
agreed. 
Barbara, as you and your family know, our 
families go back many years. It was 67 years 
ago in 1954 when Wally and my father com-
peted for the same congressional seat, the 
very seat that John Larson now holds. 
Wally, of course, went on to have a very 
successful and productive life. The Barnes 
Group, as all of us in Connecticut are aware, 
was extremely successful under Wally’s lead-
ership. Further, Wally loved his hometown of 
Bristol and was a treasured, contributing 
member of the community and our state for 
many, many years. 
Let me add that Wally Barnes was a great 
example of what might be called an Amer-
ican original. If I were asked to describe my 
image of a great American, I could not give 
a better description than Wally Barnes—pa-
triotic, creative, imaginative, thoughtful, a 
person who was always willing to help oth-
ers, with healthy doses of confidence and hu-
mility. 
And so, Barbara, we were fortunate that 
Wally was a part of our lives and we thank 
you for sharing him with us. 
Christopher J. Dodd. 
Wally and I both served in the Senate for 
12 years. He was the Republican Leader and 
I, as a Democrat- in different times but with 
a similar result. We were both candidates for 
Governor for our respective parties—he in 
1970, and I in 1994. 
In what was a to be a heartbreaking loss 
for the citizens of the State-he lost to Tom 
Meskill, and I to Bill Curry. We had both 
served on various commissions and I can re-
member a call I received from him after my 
defeat. But mostly I remember that laugh, 
when he asked how I felt and I said, ‘‘Hey, 
Peacock one day, feather duster the next.’’ 
And he laughed that hearty Barnes laugh of 
disarming approval. Here this giant of indus-
try, presiding over chambers of commerce, 
the Connecticut Business and Industry Asso-
ciation, this highly respected Republican, 
was calling to soften the blow that only peo-
ple who have been through it can grasp. I 
can’t tell you how important that was and 
what it meant to me personally. 
Wally’s sense of humor, his ability to re-
late to the everyday concerns of ordinary 
people, was remarkable and endeared him to 
me and those around him. He was genuine 
and sincere, believable and had our trust. 
And his focus was always on getting things 
done. Quite a contrast to politics today. Bar-
bara I would like to read a letter to you: 
LETTER FROM PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN 
Dear Madam Secretary, Jill and I send our 
deepest sympathies on the passing of your 
beloved husband, Wally. We are thinking of 
you and praying for your peace. 
There are few words that I can share to 
ease the pain of losing a partner—it leaves a 
hole in our hearts. Wally dedicated himself 
to the people of Connecticut and the state he 
loved. He was a leader, a good man, and a 
great husband, father, grandfather, and 
great-grandfather. As you reflect on your 
time together, may the love that you shared 
be a shining light in the years to come. 
There is an Irish headstone I often quote. 
It reads, ‘‘Death leaves a heartache no one 
can heal. Love leaves a memory no one can 
steal.’’ Though the grieving process never 
quite ends, I promise you that the day will 
come when Wally’s memory will bring a 
smile to your lips before it brings a tear to 
your eye. My prayer for you is that this day 
comes sooner rather than later. 
Sincerely, Joe Biden. 
Time does heal as the President has indi-
cated and has brought a few tears but an 
equal number of smiles for a man who put 
service above self. 
A master pilot, he applied to politics what 
he applied to aviation. And just like George 
H.W. Bush, he believed in the pilot’s team 
C.A.V.U., which stands for Ceiling And Visi-
bility Unlimited. He inspired others to be-
lieve that you could go as far and as high as 
their vision, imagination, and courage will 
take you. 
Thank you, Wally Barnes. God bless you, 
God bless America.

HONORING DR. WINT HUN AS A 
28TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT 
WOMAN OF THE YEAR 
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 26, 2021 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in honor of Women’s History Month. Each 
year, we pay special tribute to the contribu-
tions and sacrifices made by our nation’s 
women. It is an honor to pay homage to out-
standing women who are making a difference 
in my Congressional District. I would like to 
recognize a remarkable woman, Dr. Wint Hun 
of La Can˜ada Flintridge, California. 
Wint was born in Chauk, an isolated area of 
Myanmar. Wint’s hero and mentor, her father, 
was a medical doctor who worked in an un-
derserved area and encouraged her to be-
come a physician who would have a positive 
effect on the community she served. After he 
passed away, her family moved to Yangon, 
Myanmar where her mother, now a single par-
ent, raised her and her sister. After her high 
school graduation, with a film resolve to follow 
in her father’s footsteps and become a physi-
cian, Wint enrolled at the University of Medi-
cine in Yahgon, one of the oldest medical 
schools in South East Asia, and obtained her 
Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery 
(MBBS) degree. 
After Wint graduated, she moved to the 
United States and continued her studies. She 
finished her residency in Internal Medicine at 
NYU Hospital in Brooklyn, New York, and then 
moved to Southern California, where she com-
pleted her Infectious Diseases Fellowship at 
the University of California, Irvine. 
Board-certified in Infectious Disease and In-
ternal Medicine, Dr. Hun treats patients in her 
office and at Adventist Health Glendale, Uni-
versity of Southern California (USC) Verdugo 
Hills Hospital and Methodist Hospital in Arca-
dia. Believing that everyone deserves kind-
ness and respect, Wint cares for her patients 
as she would for her own family, listening to 
their needs and finding a solution together. 
When coronavirus became a world-wide 
pandemic, it struck at the core of Dr. Hun’s 
specialty as an Infectious Disease physician. 
From the outset of the pandemic, Dr. Hun’s 
fearlessness and expertise emboldened USC 
Verdugo Hills Hospital’s team, giving them 
courage to battle the healthcare crisis. She 
was also an indispensable resource to the In-
fection Prevention team, as it developed rapid 
isolation and testing protocols to keep patients 
and staff safe. Dr. Hun is thankful for the op-
portunity to help so many people and is espe-
cially honored to be part of USC Verdugo Hills 
Hospital’s outstanding care team. 
Dr. Hun and her husband, Victor Chan live 
in La Can˜ada Flintridge, and they enjoy trav-
eling, gardening, and spending time with 
friends and family. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring this exceptional, well-re-
spected woman of California’s 28th Congres-
sional District, Dr. Wint Hun. 
IN RECOGNITION OF PEGGY 
SENTER 
HON. ANN M. KUSTER 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 26, 2021 
Ms. KUSTER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to offer my sincere gratitude to Peggy Senter 
on the occasion of her retirement as the 
founding president of Concord Community 
Music School. 
For nearly four decades, Peggy has pro-
vided a place for students to learn, grow, and 
create. Concord Community Music School 
leads numerous music programs designed to 
build a sense of community by offering class-
es for all ages, musical abilities, and back-
grounds. Through Peggy’s energetic leader-
ship, Concord Community Music School con-
tinues to expand services and be recognized 
nationally for its innovative and well managed 
programs. 
On behalf of New Hampshire’s Second Con-
gressional District and all those who have 
been impacted by Peggy’s vision, I thank her 
for her incredible service and congratulate her 
on all she has accomplished. I wish Peggy the 
best of luck in her new chapter and look for-
ward to our continued work together to make 
New Hampshire an even better place to live, 
work, and raise a family.

HONORING DEMARKO WALKER AS 
IOWAN OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 26, 2021 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor DeMarko Walker as Iowan of the Week. 
Haircuts can make you feel refreshed, like a 
new and improved version of yourself. At East 
High School in Des Moines, it can also signify 
you’re on the right path. DeMarko Walker has 
volunteered his time at the school since 2019 
in order to reward select students who are 
showing initiative when it comes to their edu-
cation with free haircuts. 
DeMarko is a barber at a local barbershop 
in Des Moines, Universal Kutz. DeMarko was 
looking to use his passion for cutting hair as 
a way to give back to the community that has 
helped him to become the person he is today. 
Haircuts boost a lot of people’s self-confidence 
and make everybody feel good, so he teamed 
up with East High School in Des Moines to 
create a program for students to get free hair-
cuts. 
DeMarko explained his pop-up barbershop 
was created for students who show progress 
in areas such as attendance, achievement, 
and social interactions. Since implementing 
this measure, East High School has seen im-
provements on a case-by-case basis: im-
proved attendance for targeted classes, im-
proved achievement for targeted classes, 
more 
connectivity 
with 
the 
school, 
and 
healthier interactions with both adults and 
peers. 
Education is the foundation of so many of 
our communities and shapes our future as a 
nation. I want to thank DeMarko for everything 
he is doing in the community to make it a bet-
ter place to live and learn. I commend his cre-
ative initiatives at East High School. I will con-
tinue to fight in Congress to support our youth 
and one of the best ways to do that is to sup-
port community members like DeMarko. It is 
my pleasure to recognize DeMarko Walker as 
Iowan of the Week.

IN RECOGNITION OF PHYLLIS 
GOULD 
HON. JACKIE SPEIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 26, 2021 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, my col-
league JARED HUFFMAN and I rise to honor the 
late Phyllis Gould, one of the Bay Area Rosie 
the Riveters whose work was essential for the 
United States and its allies to win the war. 
Phyllis passed away on July 20, 2021, just shy 
of her 100th birthday on October 7. We had 
the honor and pleasure to work with Phyllis on 
legislation that recognizes the immense con-
tributions the Rosies have made to history. 
Phyllis Mickey Gould was born at Camp 
Lewis, now Fort Lewis, Washington. Her father 
served in the Army for 30 years and received 
a Silver Star and Purple Heart for his service 
in France during World War I. Back during that 
time, Phyllis liked to explain, women didn’t 
plan a career at an early age, instead they 
learned to cook and sew and were expected 
to marry young and raise a family. World War 
II changed that. Men were drafted to fight the 
war, leaving the jobs building ships, planes 
and munitions vacant. More than ten million 
women nationwide stepped in. In July 1942, 
Phyllis became one of the first six women 
welders at Kaiser shipyards in Richmond, Cali-
fornia. Soon she was followed by her two sis-
ters who became a draftsman and a welder 
and by her mother who became a painter. The 
Richmond shipyard built a record 747 cargo 
ships. Phyllis worked as a welder until the end 
of the war. 
The Rosies were iconized by a poster by 
Howard Miller which ironically didn’t become 
famous until 40 years after its creation. It’s a 
poster of a young woman with a polka dot 
bandana, rolling up her denim shirt sleeve, 
flexing her bicep and exclaiming ‘‘We Can Do 
It!’’ Miller was hired by Westinghouse Com-
pany’s War Production Coordinating Com-
mittee in 1942 to create a series of posters of 
inspirational images to boost worker morale. It 
was displayed only to Westinghouse employ-
ees in the Midwest for two weeks in 1943 and 
then disappeared. In the 1980s it was redis-
covered, labeled Rosie the Riveter and be-
came a symbol for American feminism. 
For Phyllis, the Rosies never received the 
recognition they deserved, so she made it her 
life’s mission to change that and this is how 
my colleagues and I came to know her. She 
was laser focused, feisty and tenacious. She 
emphatically stated, ‘‘The military could not 
have done what it did without what we did! 
Every item they needed to succeed—a woman 
helped produce!!’’ Her ultimate dream was to 
have a National Rosie Holiday, a plaque at 
veterans memorials across the country, a stat-
ue on the Washington Mall, an annual special 
commemorative coin, and a ticker tape parade 
down 5th Avenue in New York. You see, Phyl-
lis always aimed high. For her personally, she

said, she wanted to be able to say on her 
gravestone: Mission Accomplished! 
While she didn’t accomplish everything on 
her ambitious dream list, she accomplished a 
lot in her decades of advocacy for these war 
sheroes. In 2014, she and five other Rosies 
were invited to the White House and met with 
President Obama and then-Vice President 
Biden, even snatching a hug from him. Con-
gressman HUFFMAN carried, and I cospon-
sored, a bill that designated March 21 as 
Rosie the Riveter Day during Women’s History 
Month. It has to be renewed each year, but 
we do have a national holiday, thanks in large 
part to Phyllis’ work. I carried, and Congress-
man HUFFMAN cosponsored, the Rosie the 
Riveter Congressional Gold Medal Act which 
was signed into law in December 2020. The 
U.S. mint is now in the process of designing 
the medal and Phyllis was deeply involved in 
sharing her design ideas with the mint. 
In 2019, Phyllis and two fellow Rosies trav-
eled to France for the 75th Anniversary of D- 
Day. In a letter to Senator SCHUMER, she 
wrote that the people of France honored their 
work with parades, a banquet, gifts and a 
medal. In 2000, The Rosie the Riveter WWII 
Home Front National Historical Park opened 
its doors in Richmond, due to the advocacy of 
Phyllis and her fellow Rosies. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
Phyllis 
Gould 
never 
stopped fighting for the Rosies and she re-
fused to take no for an answer. She was 
fiercely independent. She lived alone in her 
apartment and drove a stick shift truck up until 
a few days before she fell ill at 99. She proud-
ly displayed photos of herself with the Presi-
dent and Vice President and Members of Con-
gress. She didn’t have a computer or cell 
phone, but she made countless phone calls 
from her landline and wrote countless hand-
written letters to federal and state elected offi-
cials to plead for proper recognition of these 
war heroes. In our book, she has permission 
to write Mission Accomplished on her grave-
stone.

HONORING DAISY DE LA TORRE AS 
A 
28TH 
CONGRESSIONAL 
DIS-
TRICT WOMAN OF THE YEAR 
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 26, 2021 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in honor of Women’s History Month. Each 
year, we pay special tribute to the contribu-
tions and sacrifices made by our nation’s 
women. It is an honor to pay homage to out-
standing women who are making a difference 
in my Congressional District. I would like to 
recognize a remarkable woman, Daisy De La 
Torre of the Elysian Valley neighborhood of 
Los Angeles, California. 
A life-long resident of Elysian Valley, Daisy 
attended Immaculate Heart High School and 
in 2017, obtained her Bachelor’s Degree in 
Nursing from the University of San Francisco. 
In 2018, she began her vocation as a nurse at 
Dignity Health Glendale Memorial Hospital. 
As a labor and delivery nurse, Daisy has 
been 
an 
essential 
frontline worker with 
coronavirus patients throughout the entire pan-
demic. New life is normally celebrated daily in 
her unit, however due to the coronavirus, un-
certainty and anxiety developed in this unit, as 
expectant mothers were occasionally com-
pelled to experience their babies’ births alone. 
In some instances, due to the mothers’ 
COVID–19 positive status, mothers were sep-
arated from their babies after they were born. 
Ms. De La Torre stepped up to the challenge, 
working overtime as needed and consistently 
providing kindness, comfort, and compassion 
to those under her care, often substituting for 
absent family members, while concurrently 
welcoming new lives as so many lives were 
lost nationwide. 
When Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) 
became scarce at the hospital, Daisy con-
tacted local Elysian Valley businesses, non-
profits, and friends, such as Waxpaper, LA 
Mas and Suay Sew Shop who quickly re-
sponded with donations of locally made masks 
for hospital staff, as well as for family mem-
bers and neighbors. Daisy’s leadership ex-
tended beyond obtaining PPE and she worked 
with LA Mas, a nonprofit organization to pro-
vide food to families in need in the Elysian 
Valley area during the pandemic. 
Daisy was one of the first group of frontline 
workers to receive a first dose of COVID–19 
vaccine in December of 2020, and has been 
a strong advocate for vaccine awareness, as-
sisting in this effort through social media plat-
forms and scheduling vaccine appointments. 
She is grateful for the opportunity to help peo-
ple through nursing and for the many bless-
ings in her life. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring this exceptional, well-re-
spected woman of California’s 28th Congres-
sional District, Daisy De La Torre.

HONORING THE LIFE AND MILI-
TARY SERVICE OF EUGENE S. 
KOLUPSKI 
HON. BRIAN BABIN 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 26, 2021 
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I rise to honor 
the life and legacy of World War II veteran, 
Eugene S. Kolupski, who was laid to rest with 
full military honors at Arlington National Ceme-
tery today, July 26, 2021. Eugene was born 
on August 23, 1924, and passed away peace-
fully at his home in Encino, California, at the 
age of 94 on July 5, 2019. 
During the Second World War, Eugene was 
a part of the 885th Heavy Bombardment 
Squadron of the United States Army Air 
Forces. He served in eight campaigns, includ-
ing Northern France, Southern France, North 
Apennines, Po Valley, Balkans, Rome-Arno, 
Naples-Foggia, and the Rhineland. For his val-
iant military service, Eugene was awarded one 
Silver Star, three Bronze Stars, and a Presi-
dential Distinguished Unit Emblem with an 
Oak Leaf Cluster, among other medals. Before 
he passed, he was also presented the French 
Legion of Honor Medal by the French Govern-
ment, France’s highest honor. 
The 885th Heavy Bombardment Squadron, 
despite its name, never dropped a single 
bomb during the war. While under the com-
mand of the 15th Air Force, its missions were 
often top secret. They were often tasked with 
dropping Office of Strategic Service agents 
behind enemy territory and dispersing weap-
ons and supplies to the French and Italian re-
sistance. In preparation for the D-Day land-
ings, the squadron placed agents behind 
enemy lines to obtain information on German 
installations and scout glider landing areas. 
They flew modified B–17 Flying Fortresses 
and B–24 Liberators that were painted black 
to better blend in during night missions. Since 
all of their operations were flown at unusually 
low altitudes, the 885th suffered some of the 
heaviest losses during the war. 
Eugene is survived by his wife Delores 
(Taroni), his children, Thomas and his wife, 
Tamara, of Seabrook, Texas; Corinne Ginett 
and her husband, James, of Sodus Point, New 
York; Joseph of Encino, California; Ann Marie 
Porretta of Webster, New York, his seven 
grandchildren, and a great-granddaughter. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
honor 
Eugene 
S. 
Kolupski as one of the last members of the 
Greatest Generation. His faithful service to our 
country will not be forgotten, and my heartfelt 
prayers remain with his family and friends.

RECOGNITION OF AMBASSADOR 
ELIN SULEYMANOV 
HON. HENRY CUELLAR 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 26, 2021 
Mr. CUELLAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the diplomatic tour of Ambassador 
Elin Suleymanov of Azerbaijan. Since regain-
ing independence in 1991, Azerbaijan has 
faced ethnic and geopolitical opposition, im-
periling its independence and democracy. Am-
bassador Suleymanov—one of the longest- 
serving ambassadors in Washington—has 
served as a force of peace and diplomacy in 
the region, working honorably to advance 
prosperity and enhance the U.S. relationship 
with Azerbaijan. We congratulate him as the 
U.S. and Azerbaijan will mark 30 years of dip-
lomatic relations next year. 
Before his diplomatic tour, he was the first 
Azerbaijani to graduate from the University of 
Toledo in 1994 as a part of the U.S.- funded 
Muskie Fellowship. In 2004, Ambassador Su-
leymanov became the first Azerbaijani to re-
ceive the Master of Law and Diplomacy de-
gree from the Fletcher School at Tufts Univer-
sity. Following his academic pursuits, he 
served as Azerbaijan’s first Consul General in 
Los Angeles, establishing the nation’s diplo-
matic presence on the West Coast. 
Ambassador Suleymanov’s personal con-
cern for Azerbaijan inspired his concerted ad-
vocacy for the refugee crisis. Before joining 
diplomatic service, he worked with the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, pro-
viding care and protection to the thousands of 
people displaced by the three-decades-long 
Armenia Azerbaijan conflict. 
Additionally, Ambassador Suleymanov has a 
special partnership with the State of Texas. 
The Ambassador is especially fond of the City 
of Laredo and has helped establish edu-
cational partnerships between TAMIU and uni-
versities in Azerbaijan. He has visited Laredo 
for the Washington Birthday Celebration more 
frequently than any other ambassador accred-
ited in Washington, and he has a special ap-
preciation for Laredo’s own Palenque Grill. 
I am pleased to congratulate Ambassador 
Suleymanov on decades of building a strong

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF TIM P. 
KEGEL 
HON. GUY RESCHENTHALER 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 26, 2021 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to celebrate the life of Tim P. Kegel who 
passed away on May 22, 2021, at the age of 
63. 
Tim became a licensed funeral director in 
1990, working with his predecessor for 10 
years before taking over the business. He es-
tablished Kegel Funeral Home Inc. in 1999 
and ran it for over 20 years, helping the 
Finleyville community and the surrounding re-
gion bury loved ones with dignity. He will al-
ways be remembered for the kindness he 
showed grieving families throughout the burial 
process. 
Tim was a lifelong member of the Finleyville 
Volunteer Fire Department. During his 45 
years with them, he served as president and 
fire chief. Tim could often be found behind the 
wheel of his pride and joy, the department’s 
vintage fire engine. He was instrumental in 
sourcing this engine and brought it to 
Finleyville in 2000. 
His work as a public servant did not stop 
there. Tim served as deputy coroner in Wash-
ington County, which required him to be on 
call 365 days a year. Oftentimes he would 
have to respond to disturbing scenes in the 
dead of night or fight through inclement weath-
er. Despite missing holidays and losing out on 
weekends, Tim continued in this position for 
nearly 30 years. 
Within his community, he held the position 
of president for the Finleyville Borough Coun-
cil. Tim served as treasurer for both the Sons 
of American Legion Post 613 and the 
Finleyville Cemetery Company. He was a de-
voted member of the First Presbyterian 
Church of Finleyville. Tim’s neighbors will al-
ways remember his incredible warmth and im-
passioned storytelling. 
Madam Speaker, Tim P. Kegel led a life of 
service lo his community. From his 45-year 
career as a volunteer firefighter to his incred-
ibly important work identifying and burying the 
deceased, his dedication to his neighbors was 
clear. I have no doubt Tim’s legacy will live on 
in Finleyville and across southwestern Penn-
sylvania.

URGENT NEED TO PASS LEGISLA-
TION 
TO 
PROTECT 
AND 
PRE-
SERVE VOTING RIGHTS 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 26, 2021 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to speak on the fierce urgency of preserving 
the precious right to vote by passing H.R. 4, 
the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement 
Act, H.R. 1, the For The People Act. I will con-
tinue the dialogue at a future time, when I dis-
cuss the importance of passing H.R. 40, legis-
lation which I introduced that establishes a 
commission to study and develop reparation 
proposals for African Americans. 
Madam Speaker, the serious damage to the 
precious right to vote occasioned by the right- 
wing, conservative majority on the Supreme 
Court demands that Congress exercise its 
powers under Section 5 of the 15th Amend-
ment to restore the extraordinary reach and 
effectiveness of Section 2 and Section 5 of the 
Voting Rights Act. As an aside, Madam 
Speaker, on the objection of VRA opponents 
to states subject preclearance having the bur-
den to bail themselves out, I have long said 
that 
the 
states 
that 
were 
subject 
to 
preclearance under the Voting Rights Act 
earned their way in, so it only fitting that they 
earn their way out. 
Madam Speaker, June 25, 2021, marked 
the 8th anniversary of the Supreme Court’s in-
famous decision in Shelby County v. Holder, 
570 U.S. 529 (2013), which immobilized the 
Department of Justice from subjecting dis-
criminatory voting and election law changes to 
prior review and approval, or ‘‘preclearance.’’ 
It was predicted at the time by me and other 
defenders of the precious right to vote that the 
Court’s misguided and naive decision would 
usher in a wave of state and local initiatives 
intended to suppress and nullify the rights of 
black Americans, persons of color, young 
adults, and marginalized communities to exer-
cise the most basic act in the political process: 
voting. As we have seen in recent months, 
this prediction has tragically come to pass. 
Not to be content with the monument to dis-
grace that is the Shelby decision, the activist 
right-wing conservative majority on the Rob-
erts Court, on July 1, 2021, issued its evil 
twin, the decision in Brnovich v. DNC, 594 
U.S. ll, No. 19–1257 and 19–1258 (July 1, 
2021), which engrafts on Section 2 of the Vot-
ing Rights onerous burdens that Congress 
never intended and explicitly legislated against 
to ensure that: ‘‘No voting qualification or pre-
requisite to voting or standard, practice, or 
procedure shall be imposed or applied by any 
State or political subdivision in a manner 
which results in a denial or abridgement of the 
right of any citizen of the United States to vote 
on account of’ race or color, or language mi-
nority status.’’ 
Among these burdens, couched as ‘‘guide-
posts,’’ or ‘‘suggestions’’ are that when review-
ing claims that a facially neutral election law, 
policy, practice, or voting rule has a discrimi-
nator, and therefore unlawful, effect on minor-
ity citizens, courts are to consider the following 
matters: 
1. An ‘‘ordinary burdens’’ or ‘‘mere incon-
venience’’ exception; 2. Size of disparities in 
burdens imposed by the challenged rule; 3. 
Other opportunities to vote provided by a 
state’s election system; 4. Legitimate state in-
terests justifying the challenged voting rule; 
and 5. The degree to which a voting rule de-
parts from what was standard practice when 2 
was amended in 1982. 
Taken together, this Supreme Court cabal is 
saying to racial, ethnic, and language minori-
ties: ‘‘What’s the big deal, it’s only voting. Just 
like with bad weather, sometimes you just 
have grin and bear a little inconvenience.’’ 
This Supreme Court majority has simply never 
understood, or refuses to accept, the funda-
mental importance of the right to vote, free of 
discriminatory hurdles and obstacles. 
Madam Speaker, were it not for the 24th 
Amendment, I venture to say that this con-
servative majority on the Court would subject 
poll taxes and literacy tests to the review 
standard enunciated in Brnovich v. DNC. Their 
predecessors on the Court understood this, 
going back at least as far as 1938, when the 
Supreme Court held in Chief Justice Hughes’ 
famous Footnote 4 in United States v. 
Caroletie Products, 304 U.S. 144 (1938), that 
government action alleged to discriminate 
against ‘‘discrete and insular minorities’’ would 
be subject to ‘‘strict scrutiny’’ by reviewing 
courts. 
Madam Speaker, you might be asking who 
are these ‘discrete and insular minorities’ 
about whom the Court was referring? The an-
swer is they were and are persons ‘‘excluded 
from ‘‘those political processes ordinarily to be 
relied upon to protect’’ them, racial and lan-
guage minorities, and aliens, all of whom were 
denied the single most important tool for pro-
tecting and advancing one’s interests in a de-
mocracy: the right to vote. It is useful, Madam 
Speaker, to recount how we arrived at this 
day. Madam Speaker, fifty-six years ago, in 
Selma, Alabama, hundreds of heroic souls 
risked their lives for freedom and to secure the 
right to vote for all Americans by their partici-
pation in marches for voting rights on ‘‘Bloody 
Sunday,’’ ‘‘Turnaround Tuesday,’’ or the final, 
completed march from Selma to Montgomery. 
Those ‘‘foot soldiers’’ of Selma, brave and 
determined men and women, boys and girls, 
persons of all races and creeds, loved their 
country so much that they were willing to risk 
their lives to make it better, to bring it even 
closer to its founding ideals. The foot soldiers 
marched because they believed that all per-
sons have dignity and the right to equal treat-
ment under the law, and in the making of the 
laws, which is the fundamental essence of the 
right to vote. On that day, Sunday, March 7, 
1965, more than 600 civil rights demonstra-
tors, including our beloved former colleague, 
the late Congressman John Lewis of Georgia, 
were brutally attacked by state and local po-
lice at the Edmund Pettus Bridge as they 
marched from Selma to Montgomery in sup-
port of the right to vote. 
‘‘Bloody Sunday’’ was a defining moment in 
American history because it crystallized for the 
nation the necessity of enacting a strong and 
effective federal law to protect the right to vote 
of every American. No one who witnessed the 
violence and brutally suffered by the foot sol-
diers for justice who gathered at the Edmund 
Pettus Bridge will ever forget it; the images 
are deeply seared in the American memory 
and experience. On August 6, 1965, in the 
Rotunda of the Capitol and in the presence of 
such luminaries as the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther 
King, Jr. and Rev. Ralph Abernathy of the 
Southern Christian Leadership Conference; 
Roy Wilkins of the NAACP; Whitney Young of 
the National Urban League; James Foreman 
of the Congress of Racial Equality; A. Philip 
Randolph of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car 
Porters; John Lewis of the Student Non-Vio-
lent Coordinating Committee; Senators Robert 
Kennedy, Hubert Humphrey, and Everett Dirk-
sen; President Johnson addressed the nation 
before signing the Voting Rights Act: ‘‘The 
vote is the most powerful instrument ever de-
vised by man for breaking down injustice and

destroying the terrible walls which imprison 
men because they are different from other 
men.’’ 
The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was critical to 
preventing brazen voter discrimination viola-
tions that historically left millions of African 
Americans disenfranchised. In 1940, for exam-
ple, there were less than 30,000 African Amer-
icans registered to vote in Texas and only 
about 3 percent of African Americans living in 
the South were registered to vote. Poll taxes, 
literacy tests, and threats of violence were the 
major causes of these racially discriminatory 
results. After passage of the Voting Rights Act 
in 1965, which prohibited these discriminatory 
practices, registration and electoral participa-
tion steadily increased to the point that by 
2012, more than 1.2 million African Americans 
living in Texas were registered to vote. 
In 1964, the year before the Voting Rights 
Act became law, there were approximately 
300 African-Americans in public office, includ-
ing just three in Congress. Few, if any, African 
Americans held elective office anywhere in the 
South. Because of the Voting Rights Act, in 
2007 there were more than 9,100 black elect-
ed officials, including 46 members of Con-
gress, the largest number ever. Madam 
Speaker, the Voting Rights Act opened the po-
litical process for many of the approximately 
6,000 Hispanic public officials that have been 
elected and appointed nationwide, including 
more than 275 at the state or federal level, 32 
of whom serve in Congress. Native Ameri-
cans, Asians and others who have historically 
encountered harsh barriers to full political par-
ticipation also have benefited greatly. 
As I indicated, the crown jewel of the Voting 
Rights Act of 1965 is Section 5, which re-
quires that states and localities with a chronic 
record of discrimination in voting practices se-
cure federal approval before making any 
changes to voting processes. Section 5 has 
protected minority voting rights where voter 
discrimination has historically been the worst. 
Between 1982 and 2006, Section 5 stopped 
more than 1,000 discriminatory voting changes 
in their tracks, including 107 discriminatory 
changes right here in Texas. Passed in 1965 
with the extraordinary leadership of President 
Lyndon Johnson, the greatest legislative ge-
nius of our lifetime, the Voting Rights Act of 
1965 was bringing dramatic change in many 
states across the South. But in 1972, change 
was not coming fast enough or in many places 
in Texas. In fact, Texas, which had never 
elected a woman to Congress or an African 
American to the Texas State Senate, was not 
covered by Section 5 of the 1965 Voting 
Rights Act and the language minorities living 
in South Texas were not protected at all. 
But thanks to the Voting Rights Act of 1965 
and the tireless voter registration work per-
formed in 1972 by Hillary Clinton in Texas, 
along with hundreds of others, including her 
future husband Bill, Barbara Jordan was elect-
ed to Congress, giving meaning to the prom-
ise of the Voting Rights Act that all citizens 
would at long last have the right to cast a vote 
for person of their community, from their com-
munity, for their community. Madam Speaker, 
it is a source of eternal pride to all of us in 
Houston that in pursuit of extending the full 
measure of citizenship to all Americans, in 
1975 Congresswoman Barbara Jordan, who 
also represented this historic 18th Congres-
sional District of Texas, introduced, and the 
Congress adopted, what are now Sections 
4(f)(3) and 4(f)(4) of the Voting Rights Act, 
which extended the protections of Section 4(a) 
and Section 5 to language minorities. 
During the floor debate on the 1975 reau-
thorization of the Voting Rights Act, Congress-
woman Jordan explained why this reform was 
needed: ‘‘There are Mexican-American people 
in the State of Texas who have been denied 
the right to vote; who have been impeded in 
their efforts to register and vote; who have not 
had encouragement from those election offi-
cials because they are brown people. ‘‘So, the 
state of Texas, if we approve this measure, 
would be brought within the coverage of this 
Act for the first time.’’ When it comes to ex-
tending and protecting the precious right vote, 
the Lone Star State—the home state of Lyn-
don Johnson and Barbara Jordan—could be 
the leading state in the Union, one that sets 
the example for the nation. But to realize that 
future, Texas must turn from and not return to 
the dark days of the past. 
By embracing the discriminatory Texas SB7 
and the ‘Big Lie’ that the 2020 election, by all 
accounts adjudged the most secure and inclu-
sive in American history, was riven by voter 
fraud, Texas Republicans are making the 
wrong choice to their eternal shame. Texans 
must remain ever vigilant and oppose all 
schemes that will abridge or dilute the pre-
cious right to vote, like the odious Texas SB7 
recently passed by the Texas State Senate 
but killed, but not yet permanently, by the 
unity and courage of Democrats in the Texas 
State House of Representatives. Madam 
Speaker, I applaud the House Democrats of 
the Texas General Assembly for being on the 
front lines, fighting in opposition to Texas SB7 
on the House floor and I join with them in call-
ing upon the U.S. Senate to eliminate the fili-
buster and to bring to the floor for debate and 
vote—so Congress can pass—H.R. 1 and 
H.R. 4, the John Lewis Voting Rights Ad-
vancement Act. 
We must all do our part to preserve this 
most important heritage because it was 
earned with the sacrifices and the lives of our 
ancestors. The right to vote is a ‘‘powerful in-
strument that can break down the walls of in-
justice’’ and must be protected against attack 
from all enemies, foreign and domestic, using 
all the legal tools at our disposal. Madam 
Speaker, the right to vote and to participate 
meaningfully in civic and political affairs has 
done more to advance the cause of freedom, 
justice, and equality than the Second Amend-
ment has ever done, if it has done anything at 
all. It is time the Congress act to protect and 
expand the right to vote, the only right that is 
preservative of every other right. 
Madam Speaker, how often have we heard 
our friends across the aisle claim that bur-
dening the right to vote with new restrictions 
and limitations are racially neutral and that 
their intentions must be adjudged pure be-
cause ‘after all, they’re the party of Lincoln’? 
This is a short horse soon curried. The Re-
publican Party was founded in the 1850s be-
cause of its opposition to slavery that South-
ern Democrats like future Vice-President of 
the Confederate States of America Alexander 
Stephens boasted was the ‘‘cornerstone of 
America.’’ In 1861, after the election of Abra-
ham Lincoln as President, the eleven slave- 
holding states succeeded from the Union, not 
to preserve their heritage, but to keep their 
slaves. That led to the Civil War, in which 
more than 600,000 persons on both sides 
gave their lives and ended in the utter defeat 
and unconditional surrender of the Confed-
erate Army led by its traitor general Robert E. 
Lee. Also, as a consequence of the Civil War, 
the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments to the 
Constitution were passed and ratified. 
Madam Speaker, I am grateful that at the 
time when it was needed most, the Repub-
lican Party was born and committed to the ex-
tinction of slavery. It was the pro-freedom, pro- 
civil rights party. The Democratic Party in 
those nightmarish days was centered in the 
‘‘Solid South,’’ and proudly wore the label of 
the pro-slavery, white supremacy party. This 
was not lost on the American people, and for 
a century Black Americans overwhelmingly 
self-identified with the pro-civil rights, anti- 
white supremacy Republican Party. Even after 
the national Democratic Party renounced de 
jure racism and ‘states rights’ at the 1948 
DNC in Philadelphia, resulting in Strom Thur-
mond leading his fellow Dixiecrats out of the 
convention and his running failed bid for the 
presidency, Black Americans remained a core 
constituency of the Republican Party, while 
nearly all whites in the southern states were 
Democrats, distinguishing themselves from 
northern liberals by calling themselves ‘South-
ern Democrats’ or ‘constitutional Democrats’. 
All of this changed in 1964. 
That was the year the Republican Party 
nominated Sen. Barry Goldwater for President, 
an active and die-hard opponent of the Civil 
Rights Act of 1964. Southern Democrats saw 
in Goldwater’s support for ‘states rights’ a kin-
dred spirit and vehicle to halt the federal gov-
ernment’s commitment to extend the writ and 
guarantees of the Constitution to all persons in 
all regions of the country. Madam Speaker, 
the result of that realigning election remains 
with us to this day. Before the Great Depres-
sion and the election of Franklin Roosevelt, 
the overwhelming majority of votes cast by 
Black Americans were for Republican can-
didates. 
Even in the election of 1960, the parties 
closely competed for the votes of Black Ameri-
cans, with Republican Richard Nixon winning 
more than 35 percent. Fast forward to 1964. 
Republican Barry Goldwater was routed 486– 
52 in an electoral college landslide and lost 43 
states; Lyndon Johnson won the popular vote 
by 16 million votes (61–38 percent). Goldwater 
won only his native state of Arizona and five 
Deep South states—Louisiana, Mississippi, 
Georgia, Alabama and South Carolina. It is in-
teresting to note that the five Southern states 
that voted for Goldwater swung over dramati-
cally to support him; for example, in Mis-
sissippi, where Democrat Franklin D. Roo-
sevelt had won 97 percent of the popular vote 
in 1936, Goldwater won 87 percent of the 
vote. Lyndon Johnson would say the Civil 
Rights Act of 1964 would cost Democrats the 
South for 50 years but it was worth it. 
What accounted for this change in voting al-
legiance, which persists to this day? The an-
swer is simple and obvious, beginning in 1964 
the Democratic Party became, and was per-
ceived by Americans, as the party of civil 
rights; the Republican Party not so much. The 
difference now is that white supremacists have 
not been welcome or embraced by the na-
tional Democratic Party since 1948 and have 
been pariahs since 1964. But they are wel-
come in today’s Republican Party; in fact, one 
was even nominated and renominated as its 
standard-bearer in 2016 and 2020. We Demo-
crats are not reluctant to remove and banish

those who bring shame and dishonor to our 
cause of advancing equal justice for all Ameri-
cans. I challenge our friends across the aisle 
to stop glorifying as ‘heritage’ a history of ter-
ror, injustice, violence, and racism represented 
by the persons whose statues are being re-

HONORING ALYCIA BELLE AS A 
28TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT 
WOMAN OF THE YEAR 
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 26, 2021 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in honor of Women’s History Month. Each 
year, we pay special tribute to the contribu-
tions and sacrifices made by our nation’s 
women. It is an honor to pay homage to out-
standing women who are making a difference 
in my Congressional District. I would like to 
recognize a remarkable woman, Alycia Belle 
of Hollywood, California. 
A compassionate leader, Alycia has self-
lessly devoted her time to organizations and 
programs that benefit the Hollywood commu-
nity. She served as the Director of Develop-
ment for Blessed Sacrament School, a Catho-
lic School within the Jesuit tradition, which 
closed its doors in 2021 after being in oper-
ation for over a century. Prior to the school’s 
closure, Ms. Belle raised $941,000 for campus 
improvements and more than $3.5 million for 
Jesuit Education that provided scholarships to 
families in Hollywood. She cofounded and im-
plemented a program called Jesuit Alumni 
Mass, or JAM, to engage alumni from every 
Jesuit Institution and give them the opportunity 
to connect while encouraging them to become 
involved with their Jesuit community in Holly-
wood. Alycia also positively impacted the lives 
of children from the Alexandria House, which 
offers safe housing for women and children 
who are in the process of moving to perma-
nent housing. The organization holds a special 
place in Alycia’s heart, since she was raised 
by a single mother. Under Alycia’s guidance, 
the Blessed Sacrament community welcomed 
several children from the Alexandria House. 
Passionate about helping people and im-
proving lives, Ms. Belle co-founded The Urban 
Sanctuary, which offers a safe environment 
within the sacred space of the Blessed Sac-
rament Church’s nave, where individuals ex-
periencing homelessness may seek guidance 
and rest. Alycia is also exploring sharing this 
model with churches that have underused 
space and homeless visitors. 
Ms. Belle supports the Hollywood Police Ac-
tivities League (PAL) and is grateful for their 
inspiring team-building programs and their 
dedication to youth. In addition to taking part 
in their events and encouraging families to 
participate in PAL’s programs, she has hosted 
their meetings at Blessed Sacrament Church. 
Alycia also enjoys volunteering for Project 
Angel Food. 
When the coronavirus pandemic hit, Alycia 
had the whole Parish Community online with 
live streaming masses within a matter of days. 
She also supported moving The Urban Sanc-
tuary outdoors and worked with the Hollywood 
Food Coalition to provide meals to people in 
need. Furthermore, Alycia supported the Holly-
wood YMCA in implementing a shower pro-
gram for unhoused individuals. 
IN addition to her extraordinary work in the 
non-profit arena, Alycia advocates for women- 
owned businesses. She owns Hollywood 
Handy Construction, Inc., which is a certified 
Women’s Business Enterprise (WBE). Alycia 
is married to her supportive husband, Jason, 
and together they have four children. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring this exceptional, well-re-
spected woman of California’s 28th Congres-
sional District, Alycia Belle.

EULOGIES 
FROM 
THE 
FUNERAL 
MASS 
OF 
CHRISTIAN 
BURIAL 
FOR ANN O’CONNELL LONG 
HON. JOHN B. LARSON 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 26, 2021 
Mr. 
LARSON 
of 
Connecticut. 
Madam 
Speaker, on Saturday July 17, 2021, I had the 
honor of attending the funeral service for a 
dear friend and remarkable woman, Ann 
O’Connell Long. Below are the eulogies made 
by her three loving children Deirdre, Maura, 
and Michael, as well as her great friend 
Suzanna Nolan. I was touched by these re-
marks and wish to include them in the 
RECORD for her beloved husband Michael 
Long and their family. 
REMARKS BY DEIRDRE LONG ABSOLONNE 
When I think of our mom, I think of faith, 
family, work, quiet strength, beauty, and 
good humor. Mom’s faith was strong, but 
quiet. She didn’t talk about it a lot—she 
simply lived it. 
She grew up in Parkville with two pairs of 
shoes, and the support of a community that 
populated the rest of her life. She had happy 
memories of her childhood, including vaca-
tions at Indian Neck, during which, ever the 
planner, she would lay out her bathing suit 
and towel before going to bed each night. 
When the other children would ask what she 
was doing, she would explain that she was 
getting things ready for the morning. 
She chose to stay close to her mom and at-
tend Saint Francis School of Nursing, one 
step in her lifelong relationship with Saint 
Francis. While there, she met our dad, who 
became her best friend and partner of 52 
years. She loved to joke that he married her 
for her money and she claimed at least some 
credit for making Mike Long a Democrat. 
She stayed home with us when we were ba-
bies and, on my fifth day of first grade, she 
resumed work full time. Nursing was her vo-
cation. Off she went at 7 am each day to help 
her family and the sick. She came home 
every night and put a balanced dinner on the 
table (a feat that now, as a working mom, I 
see as nothing short of miraculous). Every 
week for all those years, with the help of 
only her family, she cleaned our home top to 
bottom (usually while singing). She earned 
degrees and promotions along the way, while 
always making her family feel that she had 
plenty of time for us. 
I am so fortunate that my relationship 
with Mom was uncomplicated. It was com-
fortable, joyful, and good. She was steadfast, 
understanding, 
occasionally 
mischievous, 
and always just plain fun to be with. She 
really listened. And she was always open to 
new experiences, perspectives, and people. 
She enjoyed gathering with family and 
friends, and I know she treasured her time 
with each of you. She liked design maga-
zines, good books, cute dogs, babies, mas-
sages, making lists on index cards, and sim-
ple pleasures like sitting by the fire, in the 
yard, or on the beach. As everyone who has 
ever set foot in her home (or the home of 
someone she helped) knows, she made every-
thing beautiful. True to form, she spent her 
final months helping all of us to be ready for 
this morning. 
Perhaps most importantly, over all the 
years and through all of life’s ups and downs, 
she joked and laughed, early often and eas-
ily. 
REMARKS BY MAURA LONG SHEEHAN 
When I think of my mom, I see her smiling 
face with that twinkle in her eye and it 
makes me smile too. She was warm and lov-
ing, often laughing, and had a no-nonsense 
way of making things happen. 
When I think back to my childhood, I re-
member Mom singing along to John Denver 
when she was cleaning the house, baking 
chocolate chip cookies for our Cape Cod va-
cations, and highlighting textbooks while 
studying in bed at night. It wasn’t until I 
was much older that I realized how impres-
sive it was that she earned her bachelor’s de-
gree while raising three young children and 
earned her master’s degree while working 
and raising three teenagers. 
As a child, I had no idea who I was dealing 
with. As an adult, I realize how special she 
was. When I think about Mom’s life and ac-
complishments, it amazes me that she did it 
all with such generosity, gratitude, and 
grace. 
I know many of you here felt her gen-
erosity first-hand, whether it was kind words 
at just the right time, a homemade loaf of 
Irish bread, or a helping hand with your 
home improvements. At some point a few 
years ago I realized that whenever Mom 
showed up for a visit, after she breezed in 
with a smile, always bearing gifts of some 
sort, she would look me in the eye and ask 
‘‘what can I do to help you?’’ Having a moth-
er like that was a true gift. 
As for gratitude, Mom found the beauty in 
everything around her and she knew how to 
have fun. She was full of joy and always 
seemed to have time to relax and make new 
friends. She made everyone feel special and 
she made it look easy. Sometimes when I 
would call her and ask what she was doing, 
she would laugh, tell me she had her feet 
curled up on the sheepskin and that she was 
busy, ‘‘cultivating gratitude’’. She laughed, 
but it worked. 
Mom’s grace, and her genuine kindness, 
were evident her entire life. She was a gra-
cious hostess, and she truly enjoyed enter-
taining small groups of friends for lunch or 
dinner, having all her children and grand-
children under one roof every summer on 
Martha’s Vineyard, and hosting extended 
family for tenderloin dinner (with those in-
credible mushrooms) each Christmas season. 
Her grace, dignity, and strength were on 
full display this past year as she continued 
to warmly welcome friends and family for 
laughter-filled visits while quietly, through 
her example, preparing all of us for what was 
to come. 
REMARKS BY MICHAEL B. LONG 
When I think of Mom the first thing that 
comes to mind is laughter and the second is 
the things she taught me. I recall in par-
ticular a couple of sayings she would use and 
tell me that Grammy O had taught her. One 
is, ‘‘A place for everything and everything in 
its place,’’ the other, ‘‘If ye can’t say any-
thing nice don’t say anything at all.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E818 
July 26, 2021 
One thing I learned at an early age was to 
look again. A fly on the wall at 4 Maple 
Court in the mid 70’s might have heard some-
thing like this: 
‘‘Mom! There’s no more bologna!’’ ‘‘Look 
in the meat drawer.’’ 
‘‘I already did!’’ 
‘‘Look again.’’ 
‘‘Okay.’’ 
(pause) 
‘‘I found it!’’ 
I also learned that if I wasn’t throwing up 
or didn’t have a fever, I wasn’t sick. ‘‘Get up. 
You’re going to school.’’ 
If I ever complained about someone else 
doing a substandard job, she’d chime in with, 
‘‘if you want something done right, do it 
yourself.’’ 
She had a great sense of humor, and all we 
needed to get each other in hysterics was a 
word or two, or just an eyebrow raise. 
And when I commented on some accolade 
she’d received or something clever she’d 
done, she’d graciously accept the com-
pliment. And then, a second or two later 
she’d say, ‘‘They don’t pay me for my looks, 
you know!’’ 
Her kind spirit was always evident, and the 
aura of positivity she radiated was irrepress-
ible. Two instances in particular come to 
mind: 
When we visited Grammy O at Saint Mary 
Home and walked in the front door, Mom 
was all smiles. She greeted all the residents 
in the lobby as well as each person we en-
countered on the way to Gram’s room, and 
their faces would just light up. Those small 
acts of kindness make people’s days, and for 
her it was a matter of course, like eating or 
breathing. 
Another was when she visited California in 
2003 to meet her newest grandchild. A couple 
of friends met me at the house before we 
went to a concert at the Hollywood Bowl. We 
hung out for an hour or so and had a nice lit-
tle visit. On the way to the show, both of my 
friends remarked about her aura of posi-
tivity and kindness, and how much they’d 
enjoyed spending time with her. 
Finally, she remarked on many occasions 
when we were on vacation, that she always 
tried to leave the place she was staying nicer 
than when she arrived. 
Mom left this place nicer than when she 
arrived. 
REMARKS BY SUZANNE NOLAN 
Ann and I met in 2005 when I began work 
at St. Francis Hospital as Director of Spir-
itual Care. As a new administrator, I was so 
very fortunate that she took me under her 
wing; I know so many of you also received 
from her an embrace of sincere interest and 
genuine care for your well-being. 
Ann asked me to speak today about her 
time at St. Francis. The factual parts of that 
are well known. Her personal impact on her 
colleagues and staff was also remarkable. To 
try to honor her legacy there, I talked to 
many people who worked with her. 
So now I ask you to imagine a shimmering 
Waterford vase filled with a beautiful bou-
quet of flowers, each flower a phrase describ-
ing Ann as a nurse and nurse leader: 
—Incredibly strong woman 
—Could see the gift in someone, help that 
person to see it, and help them to nurture it 
—Wonderful and supportive, especially in 
challenging moments (this person told of a 
night years ago when she had to transfer a 
heart transplant patient to Yale; Ann was 
the night supervisor and helped every step of 
the way) 
—Consummate professional 
—Incredibly dedicated 
—Capable, competent 
—Respected nurse leader 
—One 
person 
described 
her 
approach 
through a Maya Angelou quote: ‘‘if you don’t 
like something, change it. If you can’t 
change it, change your attitude.’’ 
—Honest when you messed up, and then 
helped you to create the plan to go forward 
—Helped her staff feel secure in their im-
portant roles even as the corporate model 
was increasing in the hospital 
—Special in so many ways 
—Persistent and tough; did the very chal-
lenging work of bringing Continuing Care 
and Utilization and Social Services together 
into the Case Management Department then 
became the Director of that Department 
—Over the top in her generosity 
—She and Mike opened their home to pro-
vide a place for a staff member’s wedding 
—A wise mentor 
—Gentle sense of humor 
—Poked fun at herself 
—Ultimate hostess 
—A kind person, just so very kind 
And Ann, of course, throughout her work-
ing life, relished being a loving wife, a be-
loved mother and grandmother. 
I believe God gave Ann extraordinary gifts 
in her ability to love and to care deeply for 
others. Her trust in God, her deep faith, en-
abled her to embrace these gifts and enrich 
so many lives thus giving glory to God. We 
in this church, and so many others, have 
been privileged to know Ann and to be 
blessed by her presence. We miss her so 
much, and we are so grateful to her. 
May you find comfort in these words of 
safe passages: ‘‘Rest assured that in her 
dying, in her flight through darkness toward 
a new light, Ann held you in her arms and 
carried your closeness with her. And when 
she arrived at God, your image was im-
printed on her joy-filled soul.’’

Mr. FITZPATRICK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the following individuals for

HONORING MIMI AUNG AS A 28TH 
CONGRESSIONAL 
DISTRICT 
WOMAN OF THE YEAR 
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 26, 2021 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in honor of Women’s History Month. Each 
year, we pay special tribute to the contribu-
tions and sacrifices made by our nation’s 
women. It is an honor to pay homage to out-
standing women who are making a difference 
in my Congressional District. I would like to 
recognize a remarkable woman, MiMi Aung of 
La Can˜ada Flintridge, California, who is re-
ceiving Special Districtwide Recognition for 
her trailblazing work on the Ingenuity Mars 
Helicopter. 
MiMi credits her mother, who was the first 
Burmese woman to earn a doctoral degree in 
mathematics from an American university as 
her inspiration. MiMi’s family returned to 
Myanmar when she was a toddler, where MiMi 
resided until she moved back to the United 
States at the age of 16 to pursue her edu-
cation. She obtained her Bachelor of Science 
degree in Electrical Engineering and her Mas-
ter of Science degree in Electrical Engineer-
ing, with her thesis focus on signal processing 
and communications, from the University of Il-
linois at Urbana-Champaign. 
In 1990, Ms. Aung moved to Southern Cali-
fornia and began working at the National Aer-
onautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) 
Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), fulfilling her 
childhood dream of space exploration. She 
began her career by working on mathematical 
algorithms for deep space communication with

spacecraft hundreds of millions of miles away 
from Earth, and during her 30 year career at 
JPL, was selected for various positions with 
increasing degrees of responsibility specifically 
in Deep Space Network projects, organiza-
tional line management, technology develop-
ment, and space flight projects. The numerous 
technical areas she engaged in included 
spacecraft guidance, navigation, and control; 
autonomous systems; deep space signal proc-
essing and communications; optical commu-
nications and multiple-spacecraft formation fly-
ing. 
With Ms. Aung as the Project Manager, 
worldwide history was made on April 19, 2021, 
when the Ingenuity Mars Helicopter took its 
first flight and was the first powered, controlled 
flight in the planet Mars’ atmosphere, and the 
first such flight anywhere outside of Earth. 
Believing that young people should pursue 
what they believe in, and that critical thinking 
and industriousness play a big role in pursuit 
of their heart-felt objectives, MiMi is a frequent 
keynote speaker at various Science Tech-
nology Engineering Mathematics (STEM) sum-
mits and conferences and local area schools. 
MiMi and her husband, Dr. James Shell and 
their two children live in La Can˜ada Flintridge. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
for 
her 
extraordinary 
achievements in the science realm, I ask my 
colleagues to join me in honoring this excep-
tional, well-respected woman of California’s 
28th Congressional District, MiMi Aung.
