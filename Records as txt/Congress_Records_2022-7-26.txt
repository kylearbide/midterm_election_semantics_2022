DEMOCRATS HAVE FAILED 
STUDENTS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. JOYCE) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, as students prepare to return 
to classrooms, it is now more clear 
than ever that the lockdowns of the 
past 2 years have dealt a devastating 
blow to the education of our Nation’s 
children. 
Isolation and a lack of hands-on 
learning was detrimental with students 
falling behind grade level in both read-
ing and math. 
In fact, new research shows that stu-
dents have only recovered between 15 
and 35 percent of the learning that was 
lost during school shutdowns. 
Students are not learning the math, 
the science, the history, and the 
English that they will need to be suc-
cessful, and over the long term, the 
consequence of this learning loss could 
be catastrophic for our young people. 
Instead of addressing this crisis head- 
on and involving parents directly in 
their child’s education to help get 
them back on track, the Biden admin-
istration has taken steps to limit par-
ents’ involvement and federally man-
date what our children are taught in 
classrooms. 
To take on this problem, I am proud 
to join my Republican colleagues as a 
cosponsor of the Parents Bill of Rights 
Act. This important legislation would 
ensure that parents know what their 
children are being taught in schools 
and that they have the chance to be 
heard and to be a part of their kids’ 
education and not a bystander. 
This bill would give parents the right 
to see their school district’s budget and 
spending because it is time that we 
have transparency throughout our edu-
cation system. 
This would go even further to give 
parents the opportunity to protect 
their student’s privacy by making sure 
that a school cannot change their pol-
icy on privacy without parental con-
sent. 
Our students are counting on us. 
They are counting on us to find solu-
tions to the challenges that they face 
every day in school. It is time to in-
crease 
family 
involvement, 
enforce 
high standards, and make sure that we 
are preparing our kids of all ages for 
success in education. 
CELEBRATING SIGRID ANDREW 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to celebrate 
Sigrid Andrew on her upcoming retire-
ment from her role as medical center 
director at the James E. Van Zandt VA 
Medical Center in Altoona, Pennsyl-
vania. 
Ms. Andrews’ 26 years of service to 
the United States Department of Vet-
erans Affairs culminated with her time 
leading the Van Zandt VA Medical Cen-
ter’s team to where she has been a pil-
lar of support for our veteran commu-
nity. 
Ms. Andrews’ years of experience, not 
only as a nurse but as a leader in oper-
ational management, led her to find in-
novative solutions to a variety of 
unique challenges that face our vet-
erans each and every day. 
On a personal note, Sigrid Andrew 
has been instrumental in the develop-
ment and deployment of the Home-
grown Healthcare Initiative, which al-
lows third- and fourth-year medical 
students to return to their commu-
nities in central Pennsylvania to care 
for patients and build the skills that 
they will need as young doctors, doc-
tors who will be trained to address the 
physical and mental health issues of 
our great veterans. 
Sigrid Andrews’ tireless work to help 
address the rural physician shortage 
has been extraordinary and without 
her, the Homegrown Healthcare Initia-
tive would not be where it is today. 
Sigrid Andrews’ persistence, her in-
telligence, and her dedication to excel-
lence has been an essential tool to sup-
port the veteran community through-
out Pennsylvania.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7076 
July 26, 2022 
On behalf of the people of Pennsylva-
nia’s 13th Congressional District, I 
thank Sigrid Andrew for her hard work 
and her commitment to the veterans of 
the United States military. I wish her 
all the best. 
f 
DEMOCRATS ARE LOWERING 
COSTS FOR AMERICAN FAMILIES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
TLAIB). The Chair recognizes the gen-
tlewoman from Texas (Ms. GARCIA) for 
5 minutes. 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to recognize President Biden 
and House Democrats’ efforts to lower 
costs for American families. 
Because of Putin’s invasion, Ameri-
cans have seen higher costs every-
where—from the gas pump to grocery 
stores, to goods across the shelves at 
local stores. Farmers, ranchers, and 
consumers have been victims of these 
price hikes because of Putin’s invasion. 
President Biden and House Demo-
crats aren’t standing for this. That is 
why last month my Democratic House 
colleagues and I passed the Lower Food 
and Fuel Costs Act. 
This bill will lower costs of goods for 
hardworking American families by ad-
dressing supply chain risks, lowering 
the cost of food and gas prices, 
strengthening the food supply chain, 
and ensuring robust competition in the 
meat and poultry sector. This will 
bring a much-needed drop in the prices 
of goods for the American people. 
I am also glad to report that with 
President Biden’s leadership, gas prices 
have declined by an average of 65 cents 
over the last 40 days. Yes, you heard 
me right, Madam Speaker, 65 cents in 
the last 40 days. 
To bring additional savings for the 
American people, House Democrats 
passed 
the 
Consumer 
Fuel 
Price 
Gouging Prevention Act to further 
fight Putin’s price hike. 
While Democrats are determined to 
deliver results for Americans, Repub-
licans showed little support on this 
cost-saving bill. While sad on their 
part, I was not surprised. 
On the public health front, just this 
year, pharma companies have raised 
drug prices over 1,100 times. 1,100 
times. Drastic, greedy increases like 
these have led to insulin in the U.S. 
doubling in price since 2012. This really 
hurts States and congressional dis-
tricts like mine that have historically 
struggled with health issues like diabe-
tes. 
In Texas, more than 12.4 percent of 
the people—or nearly 3 million peo-
ple—have diabetes. In the Houston area 
where I live, almost 14 percent of the 
residents have diabetes. 
Madam Speaker, even in my own 
family—and you will recall, I am one of 
10—6 of us have been struck with diabe-
tes. I have one brother who is already 
under dialysis treatment. 
Shockingly, reports show that one in 
four diabetics have rationed insulin in 
Texas due to high costs. Many resi-
dents have even died because of need-
ing to ration this lifesaving medicine. 
This is simply appalling and uncon-
scionable. No one in our great Nation 
should gamble with their life by ration-
ing insulin because of high costs. 
That is why House Democrats passed 
the Affordable Insulin Now Act to cap 
the price of insulin at $35 per month 
because no one—and I mean no one— 
should have to ration insulin in Amer-
ica. 
So, while Republicans remain focused 
on pleasing their political base and 
stripping women of their rights, Demo-
crats remain laser focused on lowering 
costs 
for 
hardworking 
Americans 
across our Nation and standing with 
families. 
Democrats are the party who put 
people above politics. We stand with 
the American people. Together we are 
building a better America for genera-
tions to come and for the future of our 
children. 
f 
DEFINITION OF RECESSION 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Tennessee (Mr. ROSE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. 
ROSE. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
on 
Thursday, the Bureau of Economic 
Analysis will release its second quarter 
gross domestic product numbers, an 
overall measure of our country’s eco-
nomic output from April through June. 
For decades, a ‘‘recession’’ has been 
defined as two consecutive quarters of 
negative economic growth. Therefore, 
if Thursday’s second quarter GDP num-
ber is in the negative, then by defini-
tion, the United States economy will 
be in a recession. 
However, that won’t stop the White 
House from doing everything it can to 
deny the obvious. In fact, the White 
House Council of Economic Advisers is 
actively trying to change the defini-
tion of the word ‘‘recession.’’ 
In a blog published on July 21 titled: 
‘‘How 
Do 
Economists 
Determine 
Whether the Economy is in a Reces-
sion?’’ the White House argues that ‘‘it 
is unlikely that the decline in GDP in 
the first quarter of this year—even if 
followed by another GDP decline in the 
second quarter—indicates a recession.’’ 
I hope those students who will be 
taking economics 101 in the fall are 
taking notes because the Biden admin-
istration is attempting to change the 
decades-old answers to the test ques-
tions for purely political purposes. 
Instead of President Biden and his 
administration attempting to bait and 
switch the public on the definition of a 
recession, they should change course 
on their policies that are crushing our 
economy and creating significant pain 
for millions of Americans. 
President 
Biden’s 
disastrous 
eco-
nomic policies are having a ripple ef-
fect on the housing market, on gas and 
food prices, real wages, and, of course, 
overall inflation. Now, we will find out 
on Thursday whether, by definition, we 
are in a recession. 
Madam Speaker, it didn’t have to be 
this way. We didn’t have to borrow and 
spend ourselves into this mess. The 
President didn’t need to cancel the 
Keystone Pipeline. He didn’t need to 
restrict new oil and gas leases on pub-
lic lands. He didn’t need to create new 
regulations on every sector of the econ-
omy through the Securities and Ex-
change Commission and other bureau-
cratic government agencies. 
Thankfully, the days of complete 
Democratic Party rule in Washington 
are likely coming to an end. The Amer-
ican people are fed up with their left-
wing economic policies and will reject 
them soundly at the voting booth in 
November. 
Until then, Republicans like me who 
stand for fiscal conservatism will con-
tinue to call them out and hope for 
more accountability. 
At the end of the day, the President 
is responsible for this economic mess 
he created. He must do better. If he 
can’t, Republicans will. 
f 
MEDICARE AND MEDICAID WAS A 
GIANT LEAP FORWARD 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
the Virgin Islands (Ms. PLASKETT) for 5 
minutes. 
Ms. PLASKETT. Madam Speaker, 57 
years ago this week, President Lyndon 
B. Johnson signed into law the Medi-
care and Medicaid Act. By increasing 
healthcare access for elderly and low- 
income Americans, this act was a giant 
leap forward in building a more perfect 
Union. 
Today, nearly 64 million Americans 
are enrolled in Medicare, and over 83 
million Americans receive assistance 
from Medicaid. 
We know that these programs are 
highly effective. Extensive research 
shows that Medicaid coverage is associ-
ated with a range of positive health 
outcomes. Medicare and Medicaid save 
lives. Medicare and Medicaid also have 
considerable economic benefits. Med-
icaid significantly helps reduce poverty 
and has been tied to economic mobility 
across generations and higher edu-
cational attainment, income, and taxes 
paid. 
Despite the benefits of Medicare and 
Medicaid, my Republican colleagues 
are trying to dismantle these pro-
grams. 
In 2018, a House Republican budget 
proposed slashing $537 billion from 
Medicare over a decade. Yet, while 
House Republicans try to gut Medicare 
and Medicaid, House Democrats are 
working to expand these programs to 
more Americans. 
b 1215 
I am fighting particularly hard to 
improve Medicare and Medicaid in my 
district of the Virgin Islands of the 
United States and the other U.S. terri-
tories, which have long suffered from 
healthcare inequities. 
Before 2017, in the Virgin Islands, 
nearly 30 percent of residents didn’t

have health insurance. This is a rate 
disproportionately higher than the na-
tional average of approximately 9 per-
cent. As of 2021, 34,000 individuals in 
the Virgin Islands, over a third of our 
population, relied on Medicaid and 
CHIP. 
However, the Virgin Islands has his-
torically been denied the same Medi-
care and Medicaid benefits available to 
the States. Unlike the States, Federal 
Medicaid funding to the Virgin Islands 
is capped. Before the storms of 2017, the 
Federal Government covered just 55 
percent of Medicaid costs to the Virgin 
Islands, which is substantially lower 
than the 83 percent that would have 
been covered if the Virgin Islands were 
treated as a State. 
In addition, the Virgin Islands and 
U.S. territories are excluded from re-
ceiving low-income subsidies under the 
Medicare prescription drug benefit, and 
they are excluded from DSH, the Dis-
proportionate Share Hospital program 
under both Medicaid and Medicare. 
Through recent legislation, I worked 
to temporarily increase the Federal 
share of Medicaid funding to the Virgin 
Islands from 55 percent to 83 percent 
and increase Federal Medicaid funding 
to the Virgin Islands by hundreds of 
millions of dollars. This has allowed 
20,000 of our most vulnerable Virgin Is-
landers to retain access to healthcare. 
Unfortunately, these provisions are 
only temporary, and a permanent solu-
tion is needed to ensure the people of 
the Virgin Islands have access to af-
fordable healthcare. That is why I in-
troduced H.R. 3434 with Representa-
tives from the other territories. 
This bill would eliminate the unfair 
Medicaid funding limits for U.S. terri-
tories, increase Medicare reimburse-
ments to hospitals in the U.S. terri-
tories, allow residents of the U.S. terri-
tories to be eligible for low-income 
subsidies under the Medicare prescrip-
tion drug benefit, permit DSH pay-
ments to U.S. territories, and take 
other measures to improve access to 
health insurance. 
Madam Speaker, I am calling on the 
Senate to address the Medicaid issue 
for the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, 
Guam, Northern Marianas, and Amer-
ican Samoa to help almost hundreds of 
thousands of Americans. I am calling 
on the Senate to address this in any 
healthcare 
reconciliation 
bill 
with 
what was passed for the territories 
here in the House. 
When President Lyndon B. Johnson 
signed the Medicare and Medicaid Act 
into law, he promised: ‘‘No longer will 
older Americans be denied the healing 
miracle of modern medicine. . . . No 
longer will young families see their in-
comes, and their hopes, eaten away 
simply because they are carrying out 
their deep moral obligations to their 
parents and to their uncles and their 
aunts.’’ 
Unfortunately, this promise has yet 
to be fulfilled to residents of the Virgin 
Islands and the U.S. territories. As we 
mark 57 years of this legislation, let us 
commit to fully realizing this hope by 
expanding access to Medicare and Med-
icaid to all Americans.

UNDERFUNDING 
STATE 
AND 
LOCAL PUBLIC EMPLOYEE PEN-
SIONS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, at the 
State and local levels, public employ-
ees are often promised defined benefit 
pension 
plans 
that 
are 
subsidized 
through the tax code and exempt from 
ERISA’s funding, notice, and disclosure 
requirements. 
Too often, State and local govern-
ments have not kept their end of the 
bargain and are failing to fund em-
ployee pensions adequately. The num-
bers suggest public employee pensions 
are dangerously underfunded. Econo-
mists estimate that State pension 
plans are collectively underfunded by 
as much as $5.8 trillion. 
According to the Center for Retire-
ment Research at Boston College, pub-
lic pension funds have on hand an aver-
age of just 75 cents for every dollar ex-
pected to go to retirees in future bene-
fits. 
Simply put, there is not enough 
money set aside to meet retirement ob-
ligations. This raises serious questions 
about the promises that public employ-
ers make and the practices they use to 
address underfunding. 
I am especially concerned with re-
cent news reports that some States and 
localities, rather than making respon-
sible decisions to manage their plans, 
are adopting a risky practice: betting 
on the stock market with borrowed 
money. 
According to The Wall Street Jour-
nal, in 2021, more than 100 State, city, 
and 
county 
governments 
borrowed 
money for their pension funds and in-
vested in stocks and other invest-
ments. 
Nearly $13 billion in pension obliga-
tion bonds were sold last year, which is 
more than in the prior 5 years com-
bined. Here is the problem with issuing 
pension obligation bonds: They can 
backfire. 
Investing with borrowed money can 
increase returns when markets are ris-
ing, but it makes losses more severe in 
down markets. This is especially con-
cerning given the recent struggles in 
the stock and bond markets. According 
to recent reports, public pension funds 
have lost 10.4 percent, on average, in 
2022. 
When investments using borrowed 
money don’t perform as hoped and re-
turns fall below the bond interest rate, 
the city, State, or county winds up 
paying even more than if it hadn’t bor-
rowed in the first place. 
In light of recent multibillion-dollar 
taxpayer 
bailouts 
of 
private-sector 
pension plans, there is no question 
about where State and local govern-
ments will turn when investments fall 
short and trillions in pension plans 
come due. 
Madam Speaker, I urge public em-
ployers to make decisions to fund their 
pension plans responsibly. Plans should 
not be gambling with the retirement 
savings of the hardworking men and 
women who depend on these pensions.

HONORING LEE ESPINOZA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. RUIZ) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. RUIZ. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate Coachella Valley’s 
very own, Librado ‘‘Lee’’ Espinoza, an 
icon, a legend in the boxing ring, and 
an inspiration to us all. 
From picking peanuts in the fields of 
Michoacan, Mexico, to training world- 
renowned boxers on the national stage, 
Lee is a fighter. 
The owner of the Coachella Valley 
Boxing Club, Lee is truly the godfather 
of boxing in the valley. He has trained 
world champions and put Coachella on 
the map for producing some of the best 
boxers in the game. 
Born 
in 
1949, 
in 
La 
Piedad, 
Michoacan, Lee’s success stems from 
his humble beginnings. In his early 
years, he worked on his father’s farm, 
picking peanuts alongside his grand-
father. After the devastating loss of his 
father, Lee eventually moved to the 
U.S. with his mother, where they lived 
in Coachella and, later, Tulare. Ulti-
mately, Lee settled back in Coachella 
in the Coachella Valley, where he mar-
ried his wife, June, and worked as a 
foreman installing irrigation systems. 
Together, June and Lee had four chil-
dren: Vince, Luis, Reuben, and Candy. 
It was his son Reuben whose interest in 
boxing and winning big trophies opened 
the door for Lee to become the coach 
that he is today. Lee took Reuben to 
the Indio Boys and Girls Club every 
day after work to train with his coach, 
Lalo Gutierrez, who, in turn, taught 
him the ways of coaching. 
When Lee took over coaching for 
Lalo, he formed a boxing club that 
competed successfully against others 
throughout southern California and Ar-
izona. 
While training in a cramped, single 
room in Indio, Lee’s steadfast dedica-
tion as a coach shined through in the 
success of the athletes he guided both 
inside and outside the ring. 
His first professional fighter, Fran-
cisco ‘‘Pancho’’ Segura, fought twice 
for the International Boxing Federa-
tion world featherweight title and com-
peted in the 1984 Olympic tryouts. 
Even when Pancho decided it was 
time to retire, Lee helped him find a 
job so that he could take care of his 
family. You see, that is the thing about 
Lee. When he is in your corner, you 
know that he is going to do everything 
that he can to help you succeed. In the 
ring and out of the ring, he is truly a 
caring man, a man of character with a 
lion’s heart of gold.

H7078 
July 26, 2022 
In 1985, he officially opened the 
Coachella Valley Boxing Club in an old 
fire station next to Coachella City 
Hall. What started as a club with six 
kids quickly grew to 50. 
Over the years, he has trained out-
standing athletes like Sandra ‘‘Sandy’’ 
Yard, who won two International Fe-
male Boxing Association world titles; 
Randy Caballero, an International Box-
ing Federation World Champion; the 
Diaz brothers, Joel, Jesus, Antonio, 
and Julio, each of whom won national 
titles 
and 
competed 
before 
inter-
national 
audiences; 
and 
Jocelyn 
Camarillo, from Indio, who won the 
2021 USA Boxing National Champion-
ships. 
For Pancho, Sandy, Randy, the Diaz 
brothers, Jocelyn, and countless others 
he has trained, Lee’s mentorship did 
more than help them triumph in the 
ring. His relentless devotion to their 
growth laid the foundation for their 
long-term success. 
Through his own success and his own 
stories, he has given the athletes that 
he has trained someone to look up to 
and something to fight for. His con-
tributions to our communities have 
shaped our valley’s history and left a 
lasting mark on the sport of boxing. 
In fact, he has been inducted into the 
California Boxing Hall of Fame and the 
West Coast Boxing Hall of Fame for all 
that he has achieved. 
Growing up in Coachella, I was per-
sonally inspired by Lee and his grit, de-
termination, and work ethic. I looked 
up to Lee because I knew he was mak-
ing a difference in our humble farm-
worker community. 
It is my hope that by telling his 
story here today and recording it in 
our Nation’s history, athletes across 
the country and future generations will 
also be inspired and will feel that same 
sense of hope that he has given to 
many of us in our valley and across the 
Nation.

RECOGNIZING DR. MICHAEL 
WELSH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Iowa (Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dr. 
Michael Welsh of the University of 
Iowa College of Medicine. 
Dr. Welsh recently won the 2022 Shaw 
Prize in Life Science and Medicine for 
his discoveries of defects causing cystic 
fibrosis and his development of medi-
cines that reverse those defects. 
Dr. Welsh has spent the past 40 years 
of his career researching cystic fibrosis 
and looking for solutions at the Uni-
versity of Iowa. The Shaw Prize is 
awarded to those whose discoveries in 
biomedical sciences have created solu-
tions to illness and suffering. 
This is a remarkable achievement, 
and Dr. Welsh’s research and discov-
eries should be highlighted. I am ex-
cited to see where his research takes 
him and those he inspires and mentors, 
and how the University of Iowa will 
contribute to the cure of cystic fibro-
sis. 
RECOGNIZING REGINA CATHOLIC HIGH SCHOOL 
SOFTBALL TEAM 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
accomplishments of Regina Catholic 
High School’s softball team. 
Last weekend, the Regals concluded 
the State softball tournament hosted 
in Fort Dodge and won the 2A State 
championship title. This victory marks 
Regina Catholic High School’s fourth 
2A State championship in 11 years. 
Despite a difficult first inning, the 
Regals were able to come together, 
work as a team, and finish with a 6–4 
victory 
over 
Wilton 
Jr.-Sr. 
High 
School. 
Madam Speaker, I congratulate both 
teams, as both teams are in my dis-
trict. How outstanding that two of my 
district’s teams would be in the State 
championship 
softball 
tournament. 
They put on a spectacular champion-
ship game, showing the talent that our 
district has at the State level. 
Madam Speaker, I look forward to 
cheering on both teams next year as 
they compete for another State title. 
CELEBRATIONS 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I wish a happy birthday to

PROTECTING SOCIAL SECURITY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Connecticut (Mr. LARSON) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Madam 
Speaker, I rise to address the body on 
Social Security. 
Madam Speaker, as we speak, we are 
at war. We are at war with a global 
pandemic, a global pandemic that has 
swept across many nations, including 
our own, where we have now lost more 
than a million people. Madam Speaker, 
756,000-plus are over the age of 65. 
b 1230 
Madam Speaker, these are also the 
individuals who are most dependent 
during these times because they are on 
a fixed income and are most impacted 
by inflation. 
Madam Speaker, this war will con-
tinue because there is another wave of 
omicron coming our way called BA.2.75 
that will land here sometime in the fall 
and all the more reason that we have a 
plan to address this. Our plan is to 
make sure that we assist our seniors 
who are most in need. So we reach out 
to our colleagues on the other side and 
ask them to join us in expanding Social 
Security benefits. Congress, that has 
the sole responsibility to do this, 
hasn’t done it in 51 years. 
Madam Speaker, when you go back 
home to your district in which on aver-
age 145,000 people in your district are 
on Social Security, they need our help 
now. It is what Martin Luther King 
called the fierce urgency of now: now 
because we are in the midst of COVID, 
now because there is another more 
deadly wave on its way and the groups 
impacted the most are our senior citi-
zens and our veterans. As everyone 
knows, Social Security not only is a 
pension plan, it is spousal and depend-
ent coverage, and more veterans rely 
on Social Security than they do on the 
VA, and they are in need of our help. 
Congress as an institution hasn’t 
acted in 51 years to enhance a program. 
Madam Speaker, as you know, a gallon 
of milk cost 72 cents in 1971, and Rich-
ard Nixon was President of the United 
States. That is how long it has been 
since Congress has acted. We can no 
longer kick the can down the road. We 
are at war. We are at war with a virus 
that is attacking our people. They need 
our help, and they need our response. 
During war, we come together as a 
body and we roll up our sleeves. 
We have a plan that will extend those 
benefits. Republicans have put forward 
three concepts and ideas. One is the 
Republican Study plan that cuts Social 
Security across the board by 21 percent 
with the idea that people are living 
longer so we should boost the age. For 
every year you raise the age, that is a 
7 percent cut. The plan here says you 
have a new plan that says you work 
until you die, for God’s sake. This can-
not stand. 
Senator SCOTT has proposed a plan 
for Social Security that ends it in 5 
years, and Mr. BIGGS, before our com-
mittee, testified that Social Security 
ought to be privatized. 
We say: None of the above. 
Join us in expanding benefits to peo-
ple who need them the most and to 
people who are impacted the most. 
These are your brothers, your sisters, 
your mothers and fathers, your aunts 
and uncles, the people you worship 
with, and your coworkers. That is who 
Social Security impacts, more than 65 
million Americans currently, and with 
10,000 baby boomers a day becoming el-
igible for Social Security the time to 
act is now. We cannot kick this can 
down the road. 
We have a markup pending in the 
Ways and Means Committee to get this 
bill to the floor, and the sooner we vote 
on it the better. This is something 
where 
Democrats 
and 
Republicans 
should join together. Social Security is 
the most efficient and effective govern-
ment program. It is run with under 1 
percent administrative cost. I come 
from the insurance capital of the 
world. Any insurance company would 
love to have a 99 percent loss ratio.

CELEBRATING INDIANA’S FAIR 
SEASON 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Indiana (Mr. PENCE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, it is 
summer, and Hoosiers all over the 
great State of Indiana are renewing our 
proud and longstanding tradition of at-
tending our great county fairs. 
County fairs are a time for commu-
nities to gather, to celebrate, and to 
encourage young Hoosiers in agri-
culture. My team and I have spent our 
summer attending county fairs across 
Indiana’s Sixth District. I encourage 
all Hoosiers to attend their local coun-
ty fair and the Indiana State Fair, 
which runs from July 29 through Au-
gust 21. 
DECATUR COUNTY BICENTENNIAL 
Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Decatur County and its 
county seat, Greensburg, Indiana, in 
its bicentennial celebration. 
Decatur County and the wonderful 
city of Greensburg were founded in the 
year of 1822 by veterans and war heroes 
of the War of 1812, and it still stands 
today as a model county and city. De-
catur County and the city of Greens-
burg will long stand as a beacon of 
hope from the communities filled with 
hospitality to the famous Tree City 
courthouse. 
So, Madam Speaker, I ask that all 
Hoosiers and Americans join us in cele-
brating Decatur County’s grand bicen-
tennial. 
HENRY COUNTY BICENTENNIAL 
Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor and celebrate the bicen-
tennial of Henry County, Indiana. 
Henry County was officially founded on 
June 1, 1822. Henry County is home to 
the Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame 
and served as the home court to the 
movie ‘‘Hoosiers’’ in Knightstown. A 
museum and the birthplace of Wilbur 
Wright also finds its home there. Henry 
County 
includes 
the 
Old 
National 
Road, the oldest of the great crossroads 
of America. 
So, Madam Speaker, I ask that all 
Hoosiers and Americans join us in cele-
brating Henry County’s grand bicen-
tennial. 
HONORING STATE REPRESENTATIVE TOM 
SAUNDERS 
Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor State Representative 
Tom Saunders. Representative Saun-
ders is retiring after nearly three dec-
ades of public service, and I am proud 
to join Hoosiers in celebrating a friend 
who has had an immeasurable impact 
on our beloved Indiana. 
Representative Tom Saunders has 
long served as a distinguished voice on 
behalf of the people of Henry County 
and our entire State; therefore, Madam 
Speaker, I wish him an enjoyable re-
tirement, and I thank him for his many 
years of service. 
FIGHTING FOR HOOSIER FARMERS 
Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today because Hoosier farmers are 
struggling under Democratic leader-
ship here in Washington, D.C. While 
many of us understand the cost of in-
flation on our pocketbooks, we often 
forget that inflation is clobbering 
farmers who produce our food and fuel. 
Under President Biden’s policies, farm-
ers are struggling to just break even as 
input costs outpace commodity prices. 
So, Madam Speaker, after many let-
ters I have written to multiple agency 
heads, I regret to report that Demo-
crats are not, in fact, the party of all 
Americans. I will never stop fighting 
for Hoosier farmers and the agricul-
tural industry here in the Nation’s 
Capitol. 
THANKING GREENWOOD FIRST RESPONDERS 
Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to say a hearty thank you to the 
brave and courageous first responders 
who serve the community of Green-
wood, Indiana. When tragedy hit their 
community last week they were the 
first on the scene to respond. We com-
mend local and Federal authorities for 
their swift and coordinated action. I 
thank the Greenwood Police Chief 
James Ison and Johnson County Sher-
iff Duane Burgess for their leadership, 
and I thank all of those who serve with 
them. 
INFLATION, INFLATION, INFLATION 
Mr. PENCE. Inflation, inflation, in-
flation. 
Madam Speaker, inflation is costing 
the average family $6,000 per year— 
$6,000 per year. 
For Hoosiers, this is gas and gro-
ceries, college tuition, and car repairs. 
Despite Democrats’ denial, we all know 
where this is headed: a recession. We 
are in it. Hardworking Hoosiers cannot 
afford Democrats’ policies any longer. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle to 
stop crushing the American Dream 
with their out-of-touch policies.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
SERVICE 
OF 
U.S. 
ARMY 
RET. 
SPECIAL 
FORCES MAJOR JOHN J. DUFFY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. PANETTA) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to recognize the heroic service of 
U.S. Army Retired Special Forces 
Major John J. Duffy. 
Recently, Major Duffy was recog-
nized as a recipient of the Medal of 
Honor—not just for his service, but for 
his gallantry and intrepidity above and 
beyond the call of duty. 
A resident of my district in Santa 
Cruz, California, Major Duffy served 
four combat tours in Vietnam, often-
times operating well behind the enemy 
lines. Throughout his time in the mili-
tary, he was the recipient of 64 awards 
and decorations, 29 of which are for 
valor. 
Recently at a ceremony at the White 
House, Major Duffy received the Medal 
of Honor from President Joe Biden. 
The medal was in recognition of his ac-
tions on April 14 and 15, 1972, when 
Major Duffy was the adviser for the 2nd 
Brigade of the 11th Airborne Division 
for the Republic of Vietnam. 
Over those 2 days, Major Duffy val-
iantly defended Fire Support Base 
Charlie against an attack from a bat-
talion-sized group of the enemy. Dur-
ing the battle Major Duffy took charge 
after his CO was killed in action. De-
spite constant attacks by the enemy 
and being shot multiple times, he re-
fused to leave, and he returned enemy 
fire as he tended to his wounded sol-
diers. During the eventual evacuation 
of the base, he led the operation and 
continued to tend to his soldiers who 
were wounded in action. He finally left 
the base, but he was the last man to do 
so. 
Major Duffy exemplifies the heroism 
that is required to earn this award and 
represents the type of service and sac-
rifice that is at times necessary in 
combat for our brothers in arms and 
for our country. That is why we in our 
community, on the central coast of 
California, are so proud to call Major 
John Duffy our neighbor, a veteran, 
and our countryman of the United 
States of America. 
RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF DIANE PORTER 
COOLEY 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to recognize the life of Diane Por-
ter Cooley, a pillar of the Pajaro Val-
ley and Santa Cruz County community. 
Born to a family that settled in 
Santa Cruz County in the 1850s, Diane 
was raised on Las Lomas Ranch in 
Watsonville. Diane had a deep connec-
tion to the land and to the people of 
the central coast of California. Her fa-
ther, Tom, was one of the four founders 
of Driscoll’s Berries, and Diane contin-
ued her involvement with agriculture 
until her passing earlier this year. 
A deeply passionate civic leader, 
Diane worked tirelessly to protect and 
preserve the environment and was an 
outspoken advocate for the people of 
the Pajaro Valley. She was a dynamic 
agent of change who championed the 
creation of the Elkhorn Slough Foun-
dation, the Pajaro Valley Arts Council, 
the Community Foundation of Santa 
Cruz County, and the Land Trust of 
Santa Cruz County. 
Madam Speaker, Diane Cooley’s out-
reach and philanthropy extended far 
and wide throughout our community. 
As Santa Cruz County bids farewell to 
its beloved daughter of 95 years, may 
her legacy of giving continue to inspire 
all of us for generations to come.

CATALYTIC CONVERTER THEFTS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Indiana (Mr. BAIRD) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BAIRD. Madam Speaker, today I

constituents, my fellow Hoosiers, and 
Americans across the country: cata-
lytic converter thefts.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7080 
July 26, 2022 
From the outside looking in, cata-
lytic converter theft may seem like a 
small problem, but law enforcement, 
auto dealers, and the growing number 
of victims of these crimes will tell you 
otherwise. In communities across the 
country, thieves are targeting families, 
schools, 
and 
businesses, 
disrupting 
transportation plans and leading driv-
ers to shell out hundreds or even thou-
sands of dollars in repair costs. 
For those of you who are unfamiliar 
with catalytic converters, this auto 
part is required to reduce the potency 
of toxic emissions from internal com-
bustion engines and is usually made up 
of precious metals like platinum, rho-
dium, and palladium, which can be sold 
to scrap dealers for hundreds of dollars 
on the black market. The value of 
these 
materials, 
combined 
with 
a 
thief’s ability to remove them from a 
car in a matter of seconds, makes them 
a prime target for criminals looking to 
earn cash with little risk. 
My bill takes a multipronged ap-
proach to tackling this epidemic and 
by including traceable identifying fea-
tures on catalytic converters, address-
ing how parts are purchased, and 
strengthening enforceability of cata-
lytic converter thefts. By creating a 
system where law enforcement can link 
stolen catalytic converters from their 
vehicles of origin, prohibit the pur-
chase of disassembled catalytic con-
verters, and codify catalytic converter 
thefts as criminal offenses with crimi-
nal penalties, it is my great hope that 
we can curb these costly thefts. 
I am deeply concerned about the 
costly impacts that these thefts have 
on Americans, especially at a time 
when American workers are taking 
home less and families are paying more 
for everything thanks to soaring infla-
tion rates. I recognize the strain this 
has put on so many victims of this 
crime, and I want to do all I can to em-
power law enforcement so we can ad-
dress this problem. 
Americans have enough to worry 
about. Spending their hard-earned pay-
check to replace stolen car parts 
shouldn’t be one of them. 
b 1245 
I thank my colleagues on both sides 
of the aisle who have joined me in this 
effort to empower law enforcement and 
deter future theft by joining the PART 
Act. I believe that this widely bipar-
tisan issue can be an easy win for Con-
gress by offering a straightforward and 
impactful solution for law enforcement 
struggling to address these rampant 
crimes across the country. I hope you 
will join me in putting an end to this 
issue by supporting H.R. 6394, the 
PART Act. 
MATHEMATICAL AND STATISTICAL MODELING 
EDUCATION 
Mr. BAIRD. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to speak about H.R. 3588. This is 
an important piece of legislation that I 
was proud to introduce with my friend 
from 
Pennsylvania, 
Congresswoman 
CHRISSY HOULAHAN. 
The Mathematical and Statistical 
Modeling Education Act provides a 
much-needed solution to improving the 
quality of STEM education in America. 
This 
legislation 
advances 
mathe-
matical instruction by incorporating 
modern tools and context, including 
data, statistics, and computation. 
Mathematical modeling is currently 
taught on a limited basis yet is the 
foundation for the important work our 
Nation is addressing within research, 
development, and technological inno-
vation. 
In addition to being both a bipartisan 
and a bicameral piece of legislation, 
this bill has the support of several or-
ganizations, including the American 
Mathematical Society, and the Society 
for Industrial and Applied Mathe-
matics; and I am proud to lead this ef-
fort in providing for the security of 
America’s global competitive edge. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all Members 
to support this bill.

REMEMBERING THE 10–YEAR ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE ATTACK AT 
THE 
OAK 
CREEK 
SIKH 
GURDWARA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Wisconsin (Mr. STEIL) for 5. 
Mr. STEIL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the 10-year anniver-
sary of the horrific attack at the Oak 
Creek Sikh Gurdwara on August 5, 2012. 
I rise to honor the memory of those we 
lost in that attack. 
On August 5, 2012, a shooting took 
place at the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin, 
killing seven worshippers. 
I also rise to honor Lieutenant Brian 
Murphy, who responded to the scene 
and was shot at 15 times at close range. 
This senseless act of violence should 
have never occurred and, in particular, 
in a house of worship. Nonetheless, the 
Oak Creek community came together. 
The Sikh community responded with 
compassion and stayed true to the 
Sikh principle of Chardi Kala, trans-
lating to relentless optimism. 
I join the Oak Creek community to 
remember and honor the victims of 
this tragedy. 
IMPACT OF RISING PRICES 
Mr. STEIL. Madam Speaker, every 
day I am home in Wisconsin, I hear 
about the impact of rising prices and 
the impact that they are having on 
families’ budgets. Wisconsin’s families 
and seniors have continued to share 
their concerns with me about rising 
costs. 
A 79-year-old woman in Janesville, 
Wisconsin, told me: BRYAN, I drive less 
and am more careful about what I buy 
in the grocery store because I am on a 
fixed income. 
A woman in Oak Creek said: BRYAN, 
I am on a fixed income and with the in-
creased cost of medication, groceries, 
and gas, it is difficult to stretch money 
until the next month’s payment. 
A 68-year-old woman from Kenosha, 
Wisconsin, said: BRYAN, I am delaying 
my retirement. Food costs and energy 
costs are out of control. 
Madam Speaker, we need to change 
course. It is time we unleash American 
energy, get spending under control, and 
address the issues American families 
are facing every day. 
PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES FROM ILLICIT 
FENTANYL 
Mr. STEIL. Madam Speaker, illicit 
fentanyl is devastating our commu-
nities. In Racine County last year, 68 
people died from an illicit fentanyl 
overdose. In Kenosha County, 48 people 
died of an illicit fentanyl overdose 
death. 
Illicit fentanyl is the leading cause of 
death for individuals aged 18 to 45. We 
must keep working to keep these drugs 
off our streets. 
I am pleased to announce two of my 
amendments passed the House last 
week. 
The first amendment will support 
funding to combat fentanyl from enter-
ing the country and strengthening bor-
der security. The second amendment 
will support funding for high intensity 
drug trafficking areas. This will be 
used to combat the increase in over-
dose deaths from fentanyl and related 
substances. These amendments are an 
important step in keeping these dan-
gerous substances off our streets. 
In order to stop the illicit fentanyl 
flow, we need to secure the border, fund 
law enforcement, and make fentanyl- 
related substances a permanent sched-
ule I drug. 
I encourage Congress to take the 
steps necessary to protect our commu-
nities from this illicit substance. 
CHILDREN’S MENTAL HEALTH 
Mr. STEIL. Madam Speaker, the 
COVID–19 shutdowns exacerbated a 
worsening crisis in our country. What I 
am talking about is our children’s 
mental health. 
I recently sent a letter to the CDC re-
garding our youth’s mental health. The 
CDC has not released data on suicide 
rates among children. Why? 
The data on suicide rates in children 
is 
an 
important 
tool 
needed 
to 
strengthen our mental health infra-
structure across our country. 
As we approach the coming school 
year, this critical data will help us 
make informed decisions to support 
our children and improve their mental 
health. I urge the CDC to release this 
important data regarding our chil-
dren’s mental health. 
QUALITY HEALTHCARE FOR VETERANS 
Mr. STEIL. Madam Speaker, I will 
discuss an issue impacting veterans in 
my district. I am continuing to hear 
stories from families in Wisconsin 
about the quality of care at the State- 
run Wisconsin Veterans Home in Union 
Grove. 
The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel re-
ported in May that the State-run vet-
erans home ranks among one of the 
worst State-run veterans homes in the 
entire country. This is unacceptable. 
The substandard care veterans have

suffered at the Union Grove facility is 
abhorrent and must be addressed im-
mediately. 
Two months ago, I asked for a Fed-
eral review of the State-run facility. 
Our veterans and their families should 
be receiving the highest-quality care at 
any facility in Wisconsin. The quality 
of care at that facility has long been a 
concern of mine. 
It is abundantly clear that the vet-
erans home at Union Grove has much 
larger issues than many imagined. We 
need to ensure our veterans are receiv-
ing the care they deserve. I continue to 
call on the Department of Veterans Af-
fairs and CMS to provide a Federal re-
view of the Union Grove Veterans 
Home. 
f 
HIGH PRICES AND RISING 
INFLATION 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. LAMALFA) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, this 
time 
last 
year, 
President 
Biden 
claimed that high prices and rising in-
flation were temporary; that if we con-
tinued down this administration’s path 
and trusted their policies, then prices 
would go down again. 
Well, last month’s Consumer Price 
Index score came out and revealed that 
inflation has soared to 9.1 percent, the 
highest rate in 41 years. So obviously, 
his statement that inflation was tran-
sitory, temporary, what have you, is 
false. The numbers aren’t bearing up. 
Now, the Commerce Department is 
days away from releasing its first esti-
mate of the economy’s output in the 
April through June quarter. The econ-
omy already shrank 1.6 percent in the 
January through March quarter, and 
many economists are forecasting an-
other negative output rate. 
Two outputs in a row means that— 
the ‘‘R’’ word, the one that the Biden 
administration and his Cabinet don’t 
want to say—it could mean the reces-
sion. 
Now, that will validate the feelings 
of Americans across the country who 
are struggling to afford the basic ne-
cessities amid rising prices. 
Despite record-high prices, Treasury 
Secretary Janet Yellen is trying to 
spin the definition of a recession, 
claiming that since our Nation’s unem-
ployment rate isn’t that high, then our 
economy must be doing great. That is 
not being felt at home. That is obvi-
ously false. 
The American people are feeling un-
precedented financial pain in all as-
pects of their lives. Fuel, electricity, 
their healthcare, homes, everything is 
going up. It is becoming unaffordable 
for lower-income and middle-income 
Americans. 
Wholesale prices have surged 11.3 per-
cent. Small business confidence has 
dropped to a 48-year low with busi-
nesses struggling to hire new employ-
ees and fill open jobs. 
These high-up bureaucrats in the 
Biden administration aren’t suffering 
the financial consequences that their 
policies are causing average Ameri-
cans. They don’t feel them the same as 
regular people do. 
This is the same administration who, 
when gas prices hit an all-time high, 
told people to go out and buy brand 
new electric vehicles. Sure, no prob-
lem; $50,000 $65,000. 
Our Secretary of Transportation says 
it will require more pain to benefit 
electric car drivers and owners at 
$65,000 vehicles with Chinese-made re-
placement battery packs. 
Our Nation is facing a recession, 
meaning that the sales of new homes, 
consumer confidence, spending, and 
real wages are dropping, and inflation 
is still rising. 
President Biden has allowed the 
American people and Main Street busi-
nesses to suffer while his reckless 
spending policies continue to make 
things worse. I have heard this first-
hand from my own constituents, real 
people out there that deal with this 
every day. 
The price of everything at the cash 
register, at the supermarket, is all 
going up, and their wages, effectively, 
are going down. 
In a telephone town hall I hosted re-
cently, I asked participants, have ris-
ing costs impacted your spending hab-
its? Ninety percent said yes. They can 
spend less; they can do less. 
There are similar figures across the 
board. A new FOX News poll revealed 
that 75 percent of Americans reported 
experiencing hardship because of infla-
tion. 
We need to work to repair our econ-
omy through cutting wasteful spend-
ing, burdensome regulations, our de-
pendence on foreign oil. Why are we 
going to Saudi Arabia and asking for 
their oil when we have so much in our 
own backyard, our own energy, that we 
could make ourselves completely self- 
sufficient, as we were a couple of years 
ago, and help our allies around the 
world with that as well. 
Focus on things that help the Amer-
ican people, lower-income and middle- 
income families especially, instead of 
helping more illegal immigrants come 
to the country; instead of helping 
China become richer with more and 
more of our assets and more of our 
business. 
I keep having to ask the question: 
President Biden, and your Cabinet, 
whose side are you on? 
f 
DYSLEXIA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Arkansas (Mr. WESTERMAN) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
today, one in five Americans are af-
fected by dyslexia, making it the most 
common learning disability. Yet, there 
are still children in U.S. school sys-
tems that go without being diagnosed. 
Instead, they are written off as having 
a lack of effort, or a plain lack of intel-
ligence. 
Despite misconception, dyslexia is 
not connected to one’s level of intel-
ligence. In fact, where students have a 
difficult time reading, they often excel 
in creative thought and critical think-
ing. My bipartisan legislation, the 21st 
Century Dyslexia Act, will Federally 
define dyslexia and label proper treat-
ments and diagnosis, enabling teach-
ers, students, and parents to assist as-
piring students to achieve successful 
academic careers, and to ensure that 
all children are granted equal oppor-
tunity in the classroom. 
SAVE OUR SEQUOIAS 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
3,000 years; that is how long some giant 
sequoias have been alive. To put this 
into perspective, these trees started 
growing before the concept of democ-
racy, the English language, and the 
birth of Christ. 
The Mariposa Grove, the largest 
grove of giant sequoias in Yosemite 
National Park has been a source of in-
spiration for generations. When the 
Washburn 
Fire 
recently 
hit 
the 
Mariposa Grove, the fire’s intensity 
dramatically decreased, thanks to 50 
years of thinning and prescribed burns. 
There is a stark contrast between 
areas that have a history of proper 
management and those that have been 
disregarded. While the fire subsided in 
the Mariposa Grove, surrounding areas 
that did not receive sufficient manage-
ment were destroyed. 
As a licensed forester, I take it upon 
myself to seek science-based solutions 
for the conservation of our forests. The 
Mariposa Grove serves as a prime ex-
ample of how mechanical thinning and 
prescribed burns are necessary tools for 
proper forest management. 
It is my hope that the grove con-
tinues its legacy of inspiration by en-
couraging 
a 
new 
generation 
of 
proactive forest management that will 
protect these iconic trees for the enjoy-
ment of generations to come. 
It is past time for the Natural Re-
sources Committee to mark up the bi-
partisan Save Our Sequoias Act, and 
for the House to pass it to protect 
these iconic national treasures. 
GREAT BASIN BRISTLECONE PINE TREES 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
recently, we have talked a lot about 
the dire situation of some of Califor-
nia’s most iconic trees, the sequoias. 
But we have yet to discuss the condi-
tion of California’s oldest trees, the 
Great Basin bristlecone pine trees. 
Great Basin bristlecone pines signify 
resilience, longevity, and perseverance. 
To cope in difficult times, they almost 
completely die off, leaving but a few 
strips of bark that can continue to 
grow along the ground or skyward for 
thousands of years. To ward off pests, 
bristlecone pines trap pests in their 
thick resin. 
Due to severe drought, in mixed for-
ests, bark beetles have been able to 
build up broods on other tree species

and overwhelm many bristlecone pines, 
which succumb to bark beetles in a 
way they have never before. 
b 1300 
The good news is, in the past month, 
a Forest Service pathologist confirmed 
that Methuselah, the nearly 5,000-year- 
old bristlecone pine thought to be the 
oldest tree in the world, has yet to face 
bark beetle infestation. 
There is still time to act on the 
drought in a timely, commonsense 
manner to protect our Great Basin 
bristlecone pines. We must follow the 
bristlecone pine’s example of resilience 
and perseverance, adapting our laws to 
the needs of the natural world to stave 
off catastrophic wildfire and severe 
drought. 
DEVASTATING YEAR FOR FARMERS AND 
RANCHERS 
Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize 
the hardworking farmers and ranchers 
of Arkansas, who are being crushed by 
unprecedented drought and heat on top 
of out-of-control inflation that has cre-
ated suffocating input costs for basic 
farming inputs such as fuel and fer-
tilizer. 
Although this devastating farm year 
can’t be salvaged, hopefully the Biden 
administration and Democrats in Con-
gress will realize how detrimental their 
actions have been on raising energy 
and food prices on those who can least 
afford it: low-income and fixed-income 
Americans. 
There is still time to change direc-
tions on this dangerous path Demo-
crats are leading our country down. I 
plead with my colleagues across the 
aisle to embolden common sense.

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Holy and gracious God, thank You 
for the countless times You dem-
onstrate the intimacy of Your love for 
us—through the affection of a loved 
one, a desire met, serendipitous mo-
ments that grace our days with evi-
dence of Your hand in our lives. 
How easy it is to believe, having seen 
Your power at work, Your creative ac-
tivity in the living of our days, in the 
healing of those we love and care for. 
We are truly blessed. 
Lord, we believe. Help our unbelief. 
We ask Your blessing when we can’t 
see, when the hurts, the evil, and the 
confusion of the world obscure any evi-
dence of Your concern for us and deny 
Your willingness or ability to bring 
order to our chaos. 
In this confusion, may we find cer-
tainty that transcends doubt. In our 
fear, may we find faith that sees be-
yond our hopelessness. And as we wait 
upon You, may we trust in Your sov-
ereign power by which all things are 
possible for those who, even without 
seeing, believe. 
In the inimitable power of Your 
name, we pray. 
Amen.

THE JOURNAL 
The SPEAKER. The Chair has exam-
ined the Journal of the last day’s pro-
ceedings and announces to the House 
her approval thereof. 
Pursuant to clause 1 of rule I, the

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. WILLIAMS) come for-
ward and lead the House in the Pledge 
of Allegiance. 
Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas led the 
Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
TAKE BORDER CRISIS SERIOUSLY 
(Mr. ROSE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, what do 
Arkansas, Delaware, Idaho, Kansas, 
Maine, 
Mississippi, 
Montana, 
Ne-
braska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, 
North 
Dakota, 
South 
Dakota, 
Vermont, West Virginia, and Wyoming 
have in common? 
They all have populations smaller 
than the number of illegal immigrants 
that have been apprehended at our 
southern border since the Joe Biden ad-
ministration began. We are talking 
about 3.1 million migrants in 11⁄2 years. 
This is, indeed, a national security 
threat. 
Border Patrol officials encountered 
more than 207,000 migrants last month 
alone. Six, by the way, were on the ter-
rorist watch list. 
How many more are making their 
way here right now? How many will 
succeed at slipping through the cracks? 
How many caravans will it take? How 
many needless deaths will occur under 
this President? 
Every month, thousands more will 
come if this administration doesn’t 
begin to take this issue seriously. This 
President must do better. 
RECOGNIZING PINE HALL BRICK’S 
CENTENNIAL 
(Ms. FOXX asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize an impeccable family-owned 
company in North Carolina that is 
celebrating its 100th anniversary this 
year: Pine Hall Brick. 
In 1922, a man by the name of Flake 
Steele, Sr., founded Pine Hall Brick, 
and today, the Steele family’s fourth 
generation owns and operates the busi-
ness. 
In the construction industry, Pine 
Hall Brick is a force to be reckoned 
with. From building schools to major 
production facilities, this company has 
a reputation that spans the entire 
country and one that is highly re-
garded within the Tar Heel State. 
Congratulations to the Steele family 
and all the employees at Pine Hall 
Brick on 100 years of excellence. Here 
is to many more. 
f 
BIDEN’S LOOMING RECESSION 
(Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, Biden has repeatedly tried to 
deflect blame for all the economic 
problems Americans are currently fac-
ing. 
Instead of blaming inflation on out- 
of-control government spending, he 
claims it is the fault of greedy corpora-
tions and that profits are bad. 
Instead of realizing that his hostility 
toward the oil and gas industry is de-
creasing investments and increasing 
energy costs, he blames Russia. 
Well, I can tell you that the Amer-
ican people are not buying it. The 
American people are not stupid. People 
are facing the real-life consequences of 
Biden’s failed economic policies at the 
grocery store, at the bank, and in their 
paychecks. 
Instead of working to address these 
economic challenges, the White House 
is trying to change the definition of a 
recession before abysmal GDP numbers 
are released later this week. 
The American people deserve a leader 
that offers solutions, not semantics. In 
God we trust. 
f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. CAS-
TOR of Florida). Pursuant to clause 8 of

ther proceedings today on motions to

vote or the yeas and nays are ordered, 
or votes objected to under clause 6 of

Frederick 
Douglass 
Human 
Trafficking 
Prevention 
Education Grants under this paragraph, the 
Secretary shall— 
‘‘(i) give priority to local educational agen-
cies serving a high-intensity child sex traf-
ficking area or an area with significant child 
labor trafficking; 
‘‘(ii) give additional priority to local edu-
cational agencies that partner with non-prof-
it organizations specializing in human traf-
ficking prevention education, which partner 
with law enforcement and technology or so-
cial media companies, to assist in training 
efforts to protect children from labor traf-
ficking and sexual exploitation and abuse in-
cluding grooming, materials depicting the 
sexual abuse of children, and human traf-
ficking transmitted through technology; and 
‘‘(iii) consult, as appropriate, with the Sec-
retary of Education, the Secretary of Hous-
ing and Urban Development, the Secretary of 
the Interior, the Secretary of Labor, and the 
Attorney General, to identify the geographic 
areas in the United States with the highest 
prevalence of at-risk populations for child

bers of a racial or ethnic minority, homeless 
youth, foster youth, youth involved in the 
child welfare system, and children and youth 
who run away from home or an out-of-home 
placement.’’; and 
(5) by adding at the end the following: 
‘‘(E) CRITERIA
FOR
SELECTION.—Grantees

vivors of human trafficking, and Federal, 
State, local, or Tribal partners, to develop

sonnel in a linguistically accessible, cul-
turally

subparagraph (E), the term ‘train the train-
ers’ means having experienced or master 
trainers coach new trainers who are less ex-
perienced with a particular topic or skill, or

reach, sustainability, and making efforts 
cost- and time-efficient (commonly referred 
to as ‘training of trainers’). 
‘‘(G) 
DATA
COLLECTION.—The 
Secretary 
shall consult with the Secretary of Edu-
cation, the Secretary of Housing and Urban 
Development, and the Secretary of the Inte-
rior to determine the appropriate demo-

data collection of, at a minimum, students 
who are economically disadvantaged, mem-
bers of a racial or ethnic minority, homeless 
youth, foster youth, youth involved in the 
child welfare system, and children and youth 
who run away from home or an out-of-home 
placement.

after the date of the enactment of this Act, 
and annually thereafter, the Secretary of 
Health and Human Services shall submit to

It is the sense of Congress that Russia’s ag-

non-military infrastructure has led to mil-
lions to flee their homes—90 percent of them 
being women and children according to the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Refu-

trafficking crisis, as Russian President Putin 
continues to wage the largest and most le-
thal war in Europe since World War II.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. BASS. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 6552, 
as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. BASS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
strong support of H.R. 6552, the Fred-
erick Douglass Trafficking Victims 
Prevention and Protection Reauthor-
ization Act of 2022. 
I thank the ranking member of our 
Subcommittee 
on 
Africa, 
Global 
Health, and Global Human Rights, Rep-
resentative CHRIS SMITH, who I have 
worked closely with for many years to 
develop this bill. This joint effort has 
served as a daily reminder that col-
laboration in Congress is both impera-
tive and far from finished when it 
comes to combating and eliminating 
human trafficking. 
This legislation is the overdue reau-
thorization of the Trafficking Victims 
Act of 2000, which expired last Sep-
tember. To continue this essential 
fight to end global human trafficking, 
this measure must be passed by the 
House today so that more than 20 years 
of work is not undone. 
This bill is especially important in 
the wake of the COVID–19 pandemic, 
when virtual K–12 education made it 
harder for teachers to identify and re-
port human trafficking, prosecutions of 
traffickers were delayed as courts 
closed, and the demand for social serv-
ices for survivors increased as many of 
them lost their jobs and homes. 
Critically, 
this 
reauthorization 
strengthens provisions in the original 
bill that protect and support traf-
ficking victims while reauthorizing $1 
billion to fund programs across the De-
partments of Justice, Homeland Secu-
rity, and Health and Human Services 
that are dedicated to addressing human 
trafficking and aiding victims. 
This funding includes $35 million in 
housing assistant grants for the vic-
tims of human trafficking, which offer 
temporary housing that provides traf-
ficking survivors with meaningful al-
ternatives to living with their abusers. 
It also funds education programs on 
trafficking warning signs for educators 
and law enforcement personnel who 
may otherwise unknowingly encounter 
trafficking victims. It further requires 
greater accountability measures to 
protect people who are trafficked while 
appropriately punishing traffickers. 
In the U.S., the populations most 
vulnerable to human trafficking in-
clude migrant laborers, minorities, 
people with disabilities, those in the 
LGBTQ 
community, 
and 
especially 
runaway and homeless youth and those 
in the child welfare and juvenile jus-
tice systems. In regard to sex traf-
ficking, which is where the child wel-
fare system comes in, the average age 
of the victim is 12 years old. 
As a former healthcare professional 
and chair of the subcommittee, I have 
been a champion of child welfare issues 
throughout my time in Congress. I 
have seen too many instances of 
human rights violations against chil-
dren and other vulnerable populations 
falling victim to the abuses of human 
trafficking, both in the U.S. and 
around the world. We must take this 
issue seriously and continue taking a 
whole-of-government approach to ad-
dressing it. 
Sometimes, however, we focus on the 
international and forget that this is a 
problem right here in many cities 
around our Nation. The Frederick 
Douglass Trafficking Victims Preven-
tion and Protection Reauthorization 
Act adds several new provisions to the 
original legislation that will substan-
tially improve our efforts against traf-
ficking here at home while only slight-
ly modifying existing provisions that 
have been successful throughout its 
passage. 
One important example is the modi-
fications made to existing HHS grants 
that would train elementary and sec-
ondary 
school 
teachers, 
children, 
guardians, and trainers in the recogni-
tion and response to child trafficking. 
Child trafficking in the U.S. is not 
labor trafficking, but it is sex traf-
ficking. This section now focuses au-
thorities to ensure that grantees will 
use proven best practices, trains per-
sonnel with equitable approaches, and 
identifies service gaps, among other 
things. 
It also calls on State child welfare 
agencies to prioritize the implementa-
tion of protocols to report information 
on missing and abducted children to 
the National Center for Missing and 
Exploited Children and law enforce-
ment. 
Additionally, the bill requires States 
to submit annual reports on child sex

trafficking 
victims 
to 
Health 
and 
Human Services, which is one of the 
many steps that we can take to trace, 
track, and find those missing and, 
hopefully, create a system that pre-
vents further disappearance of our 
youth. It is our job to protect those in 
this country who cannot protect them-
selves, especially children in the child 
welfare system. When we remove them 
from their parents and from their 
homes, then we the government be-
come the parents, and we cannot be 
guilty of neglect. 
H.R. 6552 strengthens anti-trafficking 
efforts abroad. Human trafficking is 
the second largest criminal industry 
worldwide, with more than 25 million 
people, women and girls being the larg-
est identified demographic. These num-
bers are alarming, and I am humbled to 
be part of a measure that will focus on 
expanding prevention efforts at USAID 
by taking steps to further integrate 
counter-trafficking in persons activi-
ties into already existing international 
development programs. 
This bill moves not only to support 
those who have already fallen victim 
but also to prevent further trafficking 
and bring perpetrators to justice. We 
must swiftly pass this bipartisan meas-
ure to protect those who are the most 
vulnerable among us. It is our duty to 
stop this heinous crime whenever and 
wherever it is discovered, whether it be 
here in the United States or abroad. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.

Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam 
Speaker, I rise in support of the bill, 
and I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Madam Speaker, I want to convey 
my special thanks to Chairwoman 
KAREN BASS for her exceptional leader-
ship, partnership, and friendship. 
For years, we have worked together 
to combat the unspeakable crime and 
abject cruelty of sex and labor traf-
ficking. 
b 1415 
The Frederick Douglass Trafficking 
Victims Prevention and Protection Act 
is just the latest bold initiative in our 
mutual commitment to end modern- 
day slavery. 
I want to thank Speaker PELOSI, Ma-
jority Leader HOYER, Minority Leader 
KEVIN MCCARTHY, and especially Chair-
man MEEKS
and Ranking Member 
MCCAUL for having favorably reported 
the bill from the Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee on February 9. 
Majority Leader HOYER
was espe-
cially helpful and has ensured timely 
consideration during this month of 
July, just in time to commemorate the 
World Day Against Trafficking in Per-
sons. 
As my colleagues know—we have all 
been through this—but in this case 
there were five full committee referrals 
for this bill. It can be very challenging 
getting the committee chairmen and 
ranking members to agree, and I am 
grateful to them for their good faith in 
coming together for this important 
human rights cause and making sure 
that this legislation was brought to the 
floor. 
Madam Speaker, I have been working 
on human trafficking since 1995. I have 
chaired more than 35 hearings and 
written five anti-trafficking laws in-
cluding the landmark Trafficking Vic-
tims Protection Act of 2000. Many in 
the United States—and I’m grateful 
that this is so bipartisan—and many 
around the world have rallied to stop

this hideous abuse, yet it couldn’t be 
clearer that much more needs to be 
done. 
Traffickers never take a holiday, nor 
can we. Because traffickers and the ne-
farious networks that they lead always 
find new ways to exploit the vulner-
able, we must aggressively strengthen 
our laws, and we must be equally ag-
gressive in the implementation of 
those laws. 
The Frederick Douglass Trafficking 
Victims Prevention and Protection Act 
is a bipartisan, survivor-informed bill. 
KAREN and I first introduced the bill 
nearly 11 months ago on Frederick 
Douglass’ 183rd anniversary of his self- 
emancipation, and we were joined at 
the introduction by Kenneth Morris— 
Frederick Douglass’ great-great-great- 
grandson. Ken has been a tremendous 
friend and ally in this human rights 
struggle and helped us write the bill. 
Born a slave—as I think many people 
know—back in 1818, Frederick Doug-
lass disguised himself as a sailor and 
traveled from Baltimore to New York. 
A renowned abolitionist and states-
man—and a Republican—he continued 
to lead the fight to end slavery, Jim 
Crow laws, and advance respect and 
equality. 
The Frederick Douglass TVPRA hon-
ors this great man by significantly en-
hancing programs, strengthening our 
laws and adding new ones, and adding 
accountability for programs at the De-
partments 
of 
Justice, 
Health 
and 
Human Services, Homeland Security, 
and State to combat human trafficking 
and to offer sustainable solutions, solu-
tions that work. 
This bill ensures robust prevention 
through trafficking prevention edu-
cation—situational awareness for our 
children, their teachers, and parents— 
stabilization of survivors once they are 
no longer in the hands of traffickers, 
and long-term solutions that facilitate 
healing and survivor empowerment. 
Frederick Douglass once said: ‘‘It is 
easier to build strong children than to 
repair broken men.’’ 
We want to prevent trafficking from 
occurring in the first place. That is 
why we have authored this legislation. 
We create an age-appropriate, scalable 
program to train the trainers, use 
proven and tested best practices, and 
include training parents and guardians 
in trafficking prevention education. 
This bill also properly designates these 
grants as the Frederick Douglass Pre-
vention Education Grants. 
I know all of my colleagues are aware 
of Megan’s Law which protects chil-
dren domestically. In 2008 I introduced 
International Megan’s Law. It passed 
the House three times and almost died 
in the Senate until the third iteration 
of it. It was signed into law in 2016, and 
now it is being reauthorized in this bill 
as well. 
Megan Kanka was from my former 
hometown of Hamilton. She was just 7 
years old when she was kidnapped, 
raped, and brutally murdered in 1994. 
Her assailant lived right across the 
street. Unbeknownst to her family and 
other residents in the neighborhood, he 
was a convicted, repeat child sex of-
fender. Her parents, Maureen and Rich-
ard Kanka, are heartbroken to this 
day. They have been amazingly effec-
tive, courageous, and heroic in success-
fully pushing every State in the Union 
to enact Megan’s Law. 
So why International Megan’s Law? 
We know from law enforcement, aca-
demia, and media documentation that 
Americans on the U.S. sex offender reg-
istries are frequently caught abusing 
children all over the world: Asia, Cen-
tral and South America, and Europe— 
as I said, everywhere. 
Under International Megan’s Law, 
convicted child sex offenders who trav-
el abroad must provide notice to the 
U.S. Government through the Angel 
Watch Center prior to departure of all 
planned destinations. Failure to do so 
carries a significant jail term. Upon re-
ceipt of the travel itinerary, the U.S. 
Government informs the destination 
country or countries of those plans. 
In just a few years of working—and 
that is with people not traveling as 
much during Covid-19, the pandemic— 
the U.S. Government has notified for-
eign governments of the planned travel 
of 19,000 covered child sex offenders, 
and more than 7,000 individuals who 
were convicted of crimes against chil-
dren were denied entry to these na-
tions. 
The Douglass bill, Madam Speaker, 
also requires international programs to 
focus on best practices in their integra-
tion of counter-trafficking efforts into 
their development portfolios. This way 
we can make the best use of our foreign 
assistance at the Department of State 
and the U.S. Agency for International 
Development. 
The bill realigns efforts to meet fun-
damental needs of survivors through 
wrap-around social services with case 
management, including assistance with 
obtaining housing, life-skills training, 
and mental health care, while also pro-
viding long-term solutions through job 
coaching and training, and assistance 
with obtaining employment and higher 
education. This approach is funda-
mental to meeting survivors’ needs on 
their continuum of healing. 
As Frederick Douglass, again, once 
said: ‘‘Knowledge makes a man unfit to 
be a slave.’’ 
Rather than quick fixes that can 
leave survivors vulnerable to re-traf-
ficking, the Frederick Douglass bill in-
vests wisely in systemic and dignified 
solutions by providing survivors oppor-
tunities for the education and jobs 
they need to become self-reliant and 
even leaders. 
It provides, for the first-time, $35 
million for Housing Assistance Grants 
For Victims of Human Trafficking. The 
number of people without housing in 
the U.S. continues to climb, while traf-
ficking victims are extraordinarily vul-
nerable if they don’t have a place to 
live. 
We cannot forget what is happening 
in Ukraine. There is good language in 
the bill calling to our attention all of 
those who have been so horribly mis-
treated and trafficked. I thank Chair-
woman BASS for really bringing a focus 
to foster care and the fact that so 
many of our foster care children have 
been trafficked. It is a place of extreme 
vulnerability. She has very good lan-
guage that she has put into this bill— 
we worked together—but it was her ini-
tiative on that issue. 
The ILO says that there are nearly 25 
million people in the world who are 
enslaved and that most are women and 
children. 
That 
is 
unconscionable. 
Every human life is of infinite value. 
We as lawmakers have a duty to pro-
tect the weakest and most vulnerable 
from harm. 
I yield such time as he may consume 
to gentleman from Texas (Mr. ROY). 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I just want to speak 
up in favor of, not necessarily the bill 
because I need to review the bill, but 
the legislation’s purpose and the intent 
of the authors to approach this issue of 
human trafficking because it is so 
critically important. I am glad that we 
are working on a bipartisan basis to do 
that. 
I am going to demand the yeas and 
nays in a minute because of other 
issues involving the floor I am not 
going to get into right now, about time 
to review bills and other things we are 
discussing with the majority, and that 
is why we are making decisions on the 
floor to force votes. 
But on the substance, human traf-
ficking is absolutely devastating. It is 
devastating to the people of Texas, it is 
devastating to the people of the dis-
trict I represent, it is devastating to 
young children, people whom I have 
met when I have gone to various cen-
ters in Texas where they are dealing 
with these, mainly children, but also 
adults in trafficking. 
Also trafficking goes well beyond, ob-
viously, the sex trafficking trade and 
goes to the slave labor that exists in 
the United States of America today 
and that is absolutely unconscionable. 
I appreciate the bipartisan work on 
this topic. I am certainly delighted to 
work with both Members on it. I just 
didn’t want the fact that I am going to 
demand the yeas and nays to be an in-
dication of not supporting the purpose 
of this bill. There are other factors 
that are in play involving the floor and 
spending and other stuff. I appreciate 
it. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam 
Speaker, I am prepared to close. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my good 
friend from Texas for his very fine 
statement, and I look forward to a re-
corded vote. 
I also want to say very clearly that 
we have a very, very broad bipartisan 
group of stakeholders who are for this, 
including, as I mentioned a moment 
ago, Frederick Douglass Family Initia-
tives, the Douglass Leadership Insti-
tute, Frederick Douglass Foundation,

along with 300 anti-trafficking and 
human trafficking organizations, over 
500 advocates and survivors, and they 
have worked tirelessly with us over the 
last 18 months, with both KAREN BASS 
and me in crafting this legislation. We 
even had more. Some of them did drop 
out, but we will come back some day in 
the future to get some of that. But it is 
a good solid bill. 
Survivor leaders like Bella Hanoukey 
and Robert Lung provided valuable in-
sights and expertise for this bill. As I 
said, Kenneth Morris was outstanding 
in the work that he provided for us. 
As a matter of fact, as the special 
representative for human trafficking 
for the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly, 
a couple of years ago, I brought him 
into one of our big parliamentary as-
sembly meetings, and there were at 
least 100-plus lawmakers from the Eu-
ropean space that heard him speak 
about the importance of prevention. If 
young people know what is out there 
and what is waiting—particularly run- 
aways—they will be forearmed and 
forewarned and, hopefully, can miti-
gate the possibility of being trafficked 
themselves. He hit it out of the park, 
and he has been a great friend on this. 
We also have 3Strands Global Foun-
dation; the Safe House Project; Amer-
ica First Policy Institute; End Child 
Prostitution 
and 
Trafficking 
USA; 
ECPAT, with whom we work very 
closely; the American Hotel and Lodg-
ing Association; the Alliance to End 
Slavery and Trafficking, that is known 
as ATEST. They have a great group 
and consortium of groups. 
We have the International Justice 
Mission, IJM; World Vision; United 
States Catholic Sisters Against Human 
Trafficking; 
Shared 
Hope 
Inter-
national; Hope for Justice; National 
Child Protection Task Force; Rape, 
Abuse, and Incest National Network, 
also known as RAINN; the National 
Center for Missing and Exploited Chil-
dren, who also worked with us closely 
on it; the National Center on Sexual 
Exploitation; 
and 
the 
Coalition 
Against Trafficking in Women. 
They all provided valuable insights, 
as I mentioned a moment ago. 
I want to thank Mark Iozzi and 
Jamie Jackson from the majority lead-
er’s office for working closely with 
Chairwoman BASS
and me and who 
helped bring this to the floor today; 
Chris Bien and Will Dunham from the 
minority 
leader’s 
office; 
Janice 
Kaguyutan—I want to thank her for 
her help as she has done before on traf-
ficking and legislation; and Doug An-
derson. 
I want to thank Mary Vigil who is 
sitting right behind me. For the last 18 
months she has been meeting with all 
the groups working and drafting this 
legislation. She has done an amazing 
job. I want to thank her for her leader-
ship. She used to work at USAID. She 
has got a heart for vulnerable people, 
and I can’t thank her enough for that. 
I thank Piero Tozzi, our chief counsel 
for the Lantos Commission on the Re-
publican side and Mary Noonan, my 
Chief of Staff, Tomekah Burl and 
Meghann Galloway, KAREN BASS’ staff 
who were also outstanding. 
It was a full court press and a great 
deal of collaboration. I thank them and 
my distinguished staff and all the 
Members who got together behind this. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. BASS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time for the 
purpose of closing. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 6552, the Fred-
erick Douglass Trafficking Victims 
Protection and Reauthorization Act, as 
amended, should be supported by every 
Member participating in today’s vote. 
This overdue reauthorization strength-
ens laws that not only support those 
who have already fallen victim but also 
prevents the future risk of trafficking 
both at home here in the U.S. and 
abroad. 
We must supply housing for victims 
so that they can have a safe place to go 
when they leave their abusers. We also 
must ensure that child welfare and fos-
ter children are prioritized, particu-
larly young women, girls, and those in 
the LGBTQ community are protected 
and aided with resources. Without 
housing these children often have no 
choice but to return to their pimps, 
their traffickers. 
Our departments must have the fund-
ing they need so they can offer the best 
training and personnel to respond to 
this crisis. It is our duty as public serv-
ants to protect the vulnerable and stop 
this heinous crime when and where it 
is discovered. Human trafficking is a 
heinous violation of human rights, and 
we must do everything in our power to 
combat it, and that includes passing 
this bill. 
Again, I thank the staff who have 
worked very hard on this. I especially 
thank the ranking member, as we have 
worked together for 12 years. As my 
time in Congress draws to a close, I am 
very happy that this is one of the last 
pieces of legislation that we can move 
forward on together. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to join me in supporting this 
bill, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of H.R. 6552, the ‘‘Frederick 
Douglass Trafficking Victims Prevention and 
Protection Reauthorization Act of 2022. 
H.R. 6552 is a bipartisan initiative to bolster 
programs and provide critical funding to com-
bat human trafficking. 
I would like to thank Congressman CHRIS 
SMITH, for authoring today’s legislation, and 
Congresswoman KAREN BASS, for co-leading 
this initiative to take important steps in pre-
venting trafficking and protecting the most vul-
nerable among us. 
This bill will effectively reauthorize the his-
toric Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000. 
H.R. 6552 will provide more than $1 billion 
over five years to support education, restora-
tive care, and other programs that protect vic-
tims of human trafficking. 
This includes strengthening the Frederick 
Douglass Human Trafficking Prevention Edu-
cation Grants created in the Frederick Doug-
lass Act of 2018. 
Frederick Douglass Prevention Education 
grants work to prevent online grooming and 
trafficking of children through trauma-informed 
approaches and programs. 
H.R. 6552 will also authorize the Secretary 
of Health and Human Services to carry out a 
Human Trafficking Survivors Employment and 
Education Program to prevent the re-exploi-
tation of eligible individuals who have been 
victims of trafficking. 
The program will provide job-related skills 
training, life-skill training programs, assistance 
with enrollment in college or technical school, 
and other programs and services to help indi-
viduals achieve selfsufficiency. 
H.R. 6552 commits to fighting human traf-
ficking both domestically and internationally. 
Today’s bill will also reauthorize ‘‘Inter-
national Megan’s Law’’ to track convicted sex 
offenders living abroad and returning to the 
U.S. after living in foreign countries. It goes 
further by adding accountability for U.S. Fed-
eral and foreign governments, hotels, and air-
lines with anti-trafficking training and codes of 
conduct. 
My record in Congress reflects my long-
standing, deep commitment to fighting human 
trafficking. 
While drafting the major update of the Vio-
lence Against Women’s Act (VAWA), I added 
human trafficking provisions that address more 
resources and tools to aid local law enforce-
ment and advocacy groups to assist victims 
and seek justice for them. 
I also introduced H.R. 128, the RAISE Act, 
which directs the Attorney General to create a 
pilot youth diversion program for youth that 
have been the victims of abuse, sex or drug 
trafficking, or other violent conduct, and for 
whom the criminal conduct is due in whole or 
in part to that victimization. 
Texas has the second-highest number of re-
ported cases of human trafficking in the na-
tion. In 2020, the National Human Trafficking 
Hotline reported a total of 987 human traf-
ficking cases in Texas. 
This statistic is only a fraction of the actual 
number of cases since human trafficking is dif-
ficult to detect and measure. Researchers 
from the University of Texas have found that 
more than 300,000 people are victims of some 
sort of human trafficking each year in Texas. 
The Department of Justice declared Hous-
ton as one of the largest hubs in the nation for 
human trafficking. 
Human trafficking is modern-day slavery 
and a global problem. 
Today’s legislation provides the necessary 
additional support to victims of human traf-
ficking. It goes further by enforcing preventa-
tive measures to help ensure victims are not 
trafficked again. 
H.R. 6552 programs are dedicated to edu-
cation and offer innovative practices to help 
survivors navigate the pathway to self-suffi-
ciency and recovery. 
Too often women and girls who are victims 
of trafficking are arrested for crimes associ-
ated with their victimization, but they are treat-
ed as criminals and not victims in need of 
services. 
I find these practices to be heinous, dis-
gusting, and unconscionable. 
A victim who has just been forced into the 
most vile, vicious, and vulnerable reality of 
being trafficked must not be treated as a crimi-
nal, just like the person who trafficked her.

Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 6845) to provide for transparent 
licensing of commercial remote sensing 
systems, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 6845 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled,

The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Virginia. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days to revise 
and extend their remarks and to in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 6845, 
the bill now under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Virginia? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to sup-
port H.R. 6845, the Commercial Remote 
Sensing Amendment Act of 2022. I 
thank Science Committee Ranking 
Member LUCAS for introducing this bi-
partisan bill, and Representative ED 
PERLMUTTER, a member of our Sub-
committee on Space and Aeronautics 
that I chair, for being an original co-
sponsor. 
This bill will provide increased trans-
parency in the licensing of commercial 
remote sensing systems by requiring 
the regulatory agency, the National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administra-
tion, to provide additional reporting on 
the licensing of commercial remote 
sensing systems. 
The bill also amends the statute to 
ensure that the time required for 
issuing commercial remote sensing li-
censes aligns with updated regulations. 
I am pleased that the Committee on 
Science, 
Space, 
and 
Technology 
strengthened the bill in its consider-
ation of the legislation. An amendment 
we sponsored added further annual re-
porting requirements on the applica-
tions for licenses submitted and li-
censes issued. 
The amendment also sustained the 
sunset clause of annual reporting. The 
sunset date of 2030 will ensure that we 
go back, review the law, and stay re-
sponsive to changes in this rapidly 
growing commercial space sector. 
Commercial remote sensing is a high-
ly competitive global industry, with 
$2.6 billion in revenue for 2020 alone, 
according to a report of the Satellite 
Industry Association. 
Commercial remote sensing data are 
used in energy, agriculture, disaster 
monitoring, mapping, national security 
applications, and much more. This bill 
provides Congress with transparency in 
information that will benefit our over-
sight of the licensing and regulation of 
this important and growing industry. 
I urge my colleagues to support pas-
sage of H.R. 6845, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. LUCAS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 6845, the Commercial Remote 
Sensing Amendment Act. I introduced 
this bipartisan legislation along with 
my colleague, Representative PERL-
MUTTER, to update reporting require-
ments for NOAA’s Office of Commer-
cial Remote Sensing Regulatory Af-
fairs so that Congress can monitor how 
regulations are impacting the growth 
and improvement of the commercial 
remote sensing industry. 
Remote sensing uses data collected 
from satellites to produce images of 
the Earth. It has become a critical re-
source in fields like agriculture, fi-
nance, trade, and energy. 
For instance, imagery and data from 
commercial remote sensing allows us 
to improve crop production by helping 
farmers more efficiently apply water 
and fertilizer. It informs future com-
modity prices by actively monitoring 
weather and crop health. 
Commercial remote sensing also im-
proves our ability to prepare for and to 
respond to natural disasters by inform-
ing flood plain mapping, tornado track-
ing, and drought monitoring, topics 
that are very important to the people 
of Oklahoma. 
It can also be helpful in humani-
tarian relief efforts and monitoring 
treaty compliance, among other appli-
cations. 
As you can see, commercial remote 
sensing provides us with critical infor-
mation for many important applica-
tions. This technology is constantly 
evolving, and the industry is seeing 
tremendous growth. 
To effectively support and manage 
remote sensing activities, it is critical 
that Congress receives timely and com-
prehensive reports so we can evaluate 
the state of the industry and how regu-
lations are affecting its growth. 
The Commercial Space Launch Com-
petitiveness Act of 2015 established a 
reporting requirement from the De-
partment of Commerce on the status of 
commercial remote sensing licensing 
and regulation. That requirement ex-
pired in 2020. 
H.R. 6845 will reinstate the reporting 
requirement and keep Congress in-
formed of agency actions, their impact 
on licensees, and the state of the com-
mercial remote sensing industry. These 
reports to Congress will give us the in-
formation we need to ensure that the 
U.S. remains a global leader in this im-
portant field. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 6845 is a no- 
nonsense, bipartisan bill that will help 
ensure that the U.S. remains the global 
leader in the commercial remote sens-
ing industry. 
I thank my friend, Representative 
PERLMUTTER, for working with me on 
this legislation. I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I have 
no further requests for time to speak 
at this time, and I am prepared to 
close. I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LUCAS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as may consume. 
As I said before, commercial remote 
sensing provides us with critical infor-
mation to a number of fields like agri-
culture, finance, trade, energy, and 
more. This, in turn, allows us to be bet-
ter stewards of our resources. 
H.R. 6845, the Commercial Remote 
Sensing Amendment Act, will help us

ENERGY CYBERSECURITY UNIVER-
SITY LEADERSHIP ACT OF 2022 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 7569) to direct the Secretary of 
Energy to establish a program to pro-
vide financial assistance to graduate 
students and postdoctoral researchers 
pursuing certain courses of study relat-
ing to cybersecurity and energy infra-
structure. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 7569 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Energy Cy-
bersecurity University Leadership Act of 
2022’’. 
SEC. 2. ENERGY CYBERSECURITY UNIVERSITY 
LEADERSHIP PROGRAM. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) 
Addressing 
cybersecurity 
vulnerabilities in energy-related critical in-
frastructure after an intrusion occurs is inef-
ficient, ineffective, and costly. 
(2) 
Integrating 
cybersecurity 
consider-
ations into the research, design, and develop-
ment of energy infrastructure represents a 
cost-effective approach to enhancing the se-
curity, resilience, and reliability of the elec-
tric grid, oil and natural gas pipelines, and 
other energy distribution, transmission, and 
generation systems. 
(3) Successfully employing the approach 
outlined in paragraph (2) as a guiding prin-
ciple for the Department’s energy infrastruc-
ture activities will require a diverse, inclu-
sive, and highly skilled workforce which pos-
sesses energy-specific cybersecurity exper-
tise and familiarity with associated re-
search, 
development, 
and 
demonstration 
needs. 
(4) A dedicated science scholarship pro-
gram at the Department for graduate stu-
dents and postdoctoral researchers studying 
energy-specific 
cybersecurity

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. BEYER) and the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma (Mr. LUCAS) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Virginia. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days to revise 
and extend their remarks and to in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 7569, 
the bill now under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Virginia? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 7569, the Energy Cybersecurity 
University Leadership Act of 2022. 
This bill authorizes the Secretary of 
Energy to establish a program to sup-
port 
graduate 
students 
and 
postdoctoral 
researchers 
pursuing 
coursework at the intersection of cy-
bersecurity and energy infrastructure. 
In doing so, the bill aims to empower 
the Department of Energy to train a 
new generation of scientists and engi-
neers who can design and develop en-
ergy infrastructure systems with cy-
bersecurity considerations from the 
very start. 
In addition, to financial assistance 
for scholarships, fellowships, and re-
search projects, awardees will be pro-
vided with research traineeships at na-
tional laboratories and utilities to gain 
practical, hands-on experience with de-
veloping new tools and technology. 
Furthermore, the bill explicitly en-
courages the Department to leverage 
this program as a tool for diversifying 
the high-skilled workforce by expand-
ing outreach to historically Black col-
leges and universities, Tribal colleges 
and universities, and minority-serving 
institutions. 
In sum, this bill represents a nec-
essary and fundamental change from 
our current approach to securing our 
infrastructure, where cybersecurity so-
lutions are retroactively applied only 
after attack has actually occurred. 
I thank Representative ROSS for in-
troducing this thoughtful legislation. I 
urge all my colleagues to support H.R. 
7569. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. LUCAS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 7569, the Energy Cybersecurity 
University Leadership Act. 
Broadly, this bill is meant to expand 
the cybersecurity workforce for our en-
ergy sector. But before I explain how it 
will do that, I will impress upon my 
colleagues why this is necessary. 
Our energy sector is facing more 
threats now than ever before. Russia’s 
attack on Ukraine has heightened 
threats to our infrastructure, and our 
liquefied natural gas industry has been 
the target of numerous cyberattacks 
recently. 
The FBI has also been issuing warn-
ings about credible threats to our en-
ergy infrastructure. In addition to 
staying vigilant now, we need to pre-
pare ourselves for a future in which 
threats like these continue to grow. 
The way we do this is by building our 
energy sector cybersecurity workforce. 
This bill does just that with a three- 
pronged approach. 
First, it encourages further study in 
this field by creating a program at the 
Department of Energy that provides fi-
nancial assistance to graduate students 
and post-docs who are working on cy-
bersecurity and energy infrastructure. 
Second, it provides energy cybersecu-
rity training through traineeships at 
our national labs and utilities, giving 
students practical skills and experi-
ence to bring to the workforce.

Third, it ensures that we have access 
to the broadest possible range of poten-
tial cybersecurity experts by con-
ducting outreach to historically Black 
colleges and universities, Tribal col-
leges and universities, and minority- 
serving institutions. 
Taken together, these three provi-
sions in this bill will expand and im-
prove our energy cybersecurity work-
force and help us protect our critical 
infrastructure from growing threats. 
I thank my colleague, Representative 
ROSS, for introducing this important 
legislation, and Representative CAREY 
for joining her as the Republican lead 
on this bipartisan effort. It deserves 
our full support. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
3 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. ROSS). 
Ms. ROSS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 7569, the En-
ergy Cybersecurity University Leader-
ship Act. 
As all Members know, the United 
States has witnessed an alarming rise 
in cybersecurity threats and attacks 
against our energy infrastructure. My 
home State of North Carolina is no ex-
ception. 
Just over a year ago, a disastrous 
cyberattack on the Colonial Pipeline 
caused the company to halt all pipeline 
operations, leading to panic-buying of 
gasoline and diesel fuels across my 
home State. Roughly two-thirds of 
North Carolina’s gas stations ran out 
of fuel, including over 70 percent of gas 
stations in Raleigh, the largest city in 
my district. 
Our constituents rely on dependable 
energy sources for their lives and their 
livelihoods, and we cannot afford con-
tinued exposures to these types of at-
tacks. 
The Energy Cybersecurity University 
Leadership Act, a bipartisan bill I co- 
led with Congressman CAREY, will help 
address this vulnerability. 
Our bill will confront growing cyber 
threats against our country’s critical 
energy infrastructure by making real 
investments in a strong and diverse 
workforce that is ready to meet the 
challenges we face. 
It will provide financial assistance to 
support graduate students studying the 
convergence of cybersecurity and en-
ergy infrastructure, in addition to pro-
viding hands-on training and experi-
ence at our national laboratories and 
utilities. 
It will also expand the Department of 
Energy’s outreach to HBCUs, minority- 
serving institutions, and Tribal col-
leges. 
I represent much of the Research Tri-
angle, home to institutions and univer-
sities that are propelling our Nation’s 
innovation in cybersecurity, as well as 
clean energy. 
From NC State to Shaw, to Saint 
Augustine’s, and Wake Tech, this legis-
lation will better equip our brilliant 
students and researchers in North 
Carolina and beyond to tackle the 
changing cybersecurity landscape. 
I thank Chairwoman JOHNSON
and 
Ranking Member LUCAS for their lead-
ership in bringing forth this bill and 
the other Science Committee bills we 
are considering today. I urge my col-
leagues to support the bill. 
Mr. LUCAS. Madam Speaker, I am 
prepared to close, and I yield myself 
the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, our energy industry 
infrastructure quite literally keeps our 
country running. Cyberattacks that 
damage our grids, shut down our pipe-
lines, 
interrupt 
our 
energy 
trans-
missions can have real and dangerous 
consequences for families and busi-
nesses across the country. 
We know our energy sector is an at-
tractive target for our foreign adver-
saries, so we need to do everything 
within our power to keep it secure and 
reliable. 
b 1445 
H.R. 7569 will help develop the most 
important weapon we have in our arse-
nal against cyberattacks: a highly 
skilled and engaged workforce. 
I appreciate the work that Rep-
resentatives ROSS and CAREY have done 
to get this bill to the House floor. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support it today so we can 
move quickly to begin developing cy-
bersecurity resources. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, with 
great thanks to Ms. ROSS for her lead-
ership and to my friend, Ranking Mem-
ber LUCAS, for his support, I urge my 
colleagues to support H.R. 7569, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. 
BEYER) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 7569. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. TIFFANY. Madam Speaker, on

ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-
ceedings on this motion will be post-

COST-SHARE ACCOUNTABILITY 
ACT OF 2022 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 6933) to amend the Energy Policy 
Act of 2005 to require reporting relat-
ing to certain cost-share requirements. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 6933 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Cost-Share 
Accountability Act of 2022’’. 
SEC. 2. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. 
Section 988 of the Energy Policy Act of 
2005 (42 U.S.C. 16352) is amended by adding at 
the end the following: 
‘‘(g) REPORTING.—Not later than 120 days 
after the enactment of the Cost-Share Ac-
countability Act of 2022, and at least quar-
terly thereafter, the Secretary shall submit 
to the Committee on Science, Space, and 
Technology and Committee on Appropria-
tions of the House of Representatives and 
the Committee on Energy and Natural Re-
sources and the Committee on Appropria-
tions of the Senate, and shall make publicly 
available, a report on the use by the Depart-
ment during the period covered by the report 
of the authority to reduce or eliminate cost- 
sharing 
requirements 
provided 
by 
sub-
sections (b)(3) or (c)(2).’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. BEYER) and the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma (Mr. LUCAS) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Virginia. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 6933, 
the bill now under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Virginia? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to sup-
port H.R. 6933, the Cost-Share Account-
ability Act of 2022. Many of the clean- 
energy technologies deployed through-
out the Nation today have benefited 
from financial support from the De-
partment of Energy. The Cost-Share 
Accountability 
Act 
of 
2022 
would 
strengthen reporting requirements re-
lated to certain cost-share require-
ments at the Department of Energy. 
Better reporting on financial assist-
ance will help us ensure that taxpayer 
dollars are being spent wisely. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Investiga-
tions 
and 
Oversight 
Subcommittee 
Ranking 
Member 
OBERNOLTE
and 
Chairman FOSTER for their work on 
this important legislation, and I urge 
adoption of H.R. 6933. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. LUCAS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 6933, the Cost-Share Account-
ability Act of 2022. 
As the ranking member of the House 
Science Committee, I am proud of the 
work my colleagues and I have done to 
support innovative research, develop-
ment, demonstration, and commercial 
application activities for the Depart-
ment of Energy. 
To give just a few examples, last 
summer, the full House passed H.R. 
3593, our comprehensive reauthoriza-
tion of the Office of Science. Addition-
ally, the committee passed bipartisan 
legislation 
authorizing 
cutting-edge 
R&D activities across a variety of

fields such as biomanufacturing, aban-
doned 
well 
remediation, microelec-
tronics, and low-emissions manufac-
turing. 
However, directing the Department 
to conduct these activities is only a 
part of our job. Congress must be an 
active partner for the Department of 
Energy in ensuring we get the best re-
turn on our Federal research and devel-
opment investments. This legislation 
institutes a basic, commonsense re-
porting requirement that facilitates 
congressional oversight of the Depart-
ment of Energy’s financial awards. 
As a bit of background, for each re-
search, development, demonstration, or 
commercial application award the De-
partment of Energy issues, it must re-
quire that a non-Federal source pay a 
certain percentage of the cost of the 
project. However, the Department has 
the authority to reduce or eliminate 
this requirement under certain cir-
cumstances and fund a larger percent-
age of the project’s cost. 
This authority to modify these cost- 
share requirements is useful for sup-
porting the development of novel tech-
nologies and encouraging new potential 
partner organizations to compete for 
awards. However, the Department must 
wield this authority carefully and be a 
responsible steward of the taxpayers’ 
dollars. 
The Cost-Share Accountability Act 
of 2022 requires the Department to sub-
mit quarterly reports to Congress on 
the use of its authority to modify or 
eliminate the statutory cost-share re-
quirement for research, development, 
demonstration, and commercial appli-
cation activities that it funds. This 
legislation requires the Department to 
make these reports public, increasing 
public awareness and transparency re-
garding the Department’s funding deci-
sions. 
The reports will be an important tool 
for Congress in monitoring the Depart-
ment’s energy technology programs 
and holding it accountable for its fiscal 
decisions. Additionally, these reports 
can inform future legislation on re-
search and development programs and 
any potential adjustments to the cost- 
share requirements. 
This basic reporting requirement in 
no way impedes the Department’s abil-
ity to continue to use its authority to 
waive 
the 
cost-share 
requirement. 
Again, it simply provides Congress and 
the public with more data on how and 
when the Department exercises its au-
thority. 
Madam Speaker, I strongly urge my 
colleagues to support this simple re-
porting requirement, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LUCAS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
5 minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. OBERNOLTE). 
Mr. OBERNOLTE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Oklahoma 
(Mr. LUCAS), my friend and colleague, 
for yielding time. 
Research and development grants 
from the Department of Energy play a 
vital role in catalyzing the develop-
ment of new energy technology in the 
United States. The awarding of those 
grants is governed by the Energy Pol-
icy Act of 2005. 
Among other things, the act requires 
the DOE to impose a cost-sharing re-
quirement on non-Federal applicants 
for those grants. This is very appro-
priate because it gives the grant appli-
cants some skin in the game, some fi-
nancial participation of their own. 
These cost-sharing requirements can 
be as low as 20 percent with respect to 
research and development grants and 
as high as 50 percent for grants like 
commercialization or demonstration 
projects. 
As the gentleman from Oklahoma 
said, the DOE is empowered to, in ap-
propriate circumstances, waive those 
cost-sharing requirements. 
Several months ago, the SST Inves-
tigations and Oversight Subcommittee 
had a hearing in which we examined 
some of the circumstances under which 
that discretion to waive or reduce cost- 
sharing had been applied by the DOE. 
Now, to be clear, we actually con-
cluded that the DOE had appropriately 
used 
its 
authority 
in 
these 
cir-
cumstances. However, we were very 
surprised by the lack of transparency 
in this process and how difficult it was 
to obtain the information about how 
often the DOE was using this authority 
and under what circumstances. 
This bill is a very simple answer to 
that difficulty and a solution to this 
problem. H.R. 6933, the Cost-Share Ac-
countability Act of 2022, will impose a 
reporting requirement on the DOE in 
which it will be required quarterly to 
make reports to both the relevant com-
mittees of jurisdiction in the House 
and the Senate on the number of occa-
sions and the circumstances in which it 
wielded this authority to reduce or 
eliminate cost-shares in grants that it 
awards. 
This will allow us here in Congress to 
better fulfill our oversight responsibil-
ities toward the Department of Energy. 
Also, and equally importantly, it will 
provide transparency to the applicants 
for 
these 
grants 
under 
what 
cir-
cumstances it is appropriate for the 
DOE to waive these cost-sharing re-
quirements. 
This is a basic good-governance bill, 
and I urge my colleagues to support it. 
I thank the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. FOSTER), my friend and colleague, 
for being my bipartisan co-lead on this 
legislation. 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LUCAS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
The Cost-Share Accountability Act 
of 2022 institutes a simple reporting re-
quirement to assist Congress in moni-
toring the Department of Energy’s fi-
nancial awards under its research, de-
velopment, demonstration, and com-
mercial applications programs. 
The reports required by this bill will 
provide valuable information to Con-
gress on how the Department admin-
isters the statutory cost-share require-
ment. They will also assist Congress in 
fulfilling its responsibilities to oversee 
our Federal agencies’ use of taxpayers’ 
resources. 
This legislation is a simple improve-
ment to support accounting at the De-
partment of Energy for its spending de-
cisions and helps maximize the value of 
our R&D dollars. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I also 
urge my colleagues to support H.R. 
6933, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. 
BEYER) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6933. 
The question was taken.

FEDERAL PFAS RESEARCH 
EVALUATION ACT 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 7289) to provide for the National 
Academies to study and report on a 
Federal research agenda to advance the 
understanding of PFAS, and for other 
purposes, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 7289 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Federal 
PFAS Research Evaluation Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl sub-
stances (PFAS) are a group of man-made 
chemicals that have been used in a wide 
range of products since the 1940s including 
firefighting foam, carpeting, packaging, and 
cookware. There are more than 5,000 types of 
registered PFAS compounds. This chemical 
class is not currently regulated at the Fed-
eral level. 
(2) PFAS have been detected in air, water, 
soil, food, biosolids, and more. They can ac-
cumulate and remain in the body for a long 
time, and potentially lead to serious health 
effects including cancer, low infant birth-
weight, liver and kidney issues, reproductive 
and developmental problems, and more. 
(3) There remains much unknown about 
PFAS toxicity, human and environmental 
health effects, exposure pathways, as well as 
effective removal, treatment, and destruc-
tion methods, and safe alternatives to PFAS. 
(4) Federal research efforts have been frag-
mented at various agencies and struggled to

effectively address the full scope of chal-
lenges presented by PFAS. 
(5) Regulatory action and cleanup depend 
on scientific analysis of toxicity data, deci-
sion making on how best to deal with PFAS, 
and understanding the significance of the 
many exposure pathways that exist. A con-
sensus study by the National Academies 
would help inform decisions by Federal and 
State Governments, industry, and other 
stakeholders on how to best address PFAS. 
SEC. 3. NATIONAL ACADEMIES REPORTS. 
(a) RESEARCH ASSESSMENTS OF PFAS.— 
(1) IN
GENERAL.—Not later than 90 days

posures, and potential exposure pathways for 
the public; 
(ii) evaluate the fate and transport of 
PFAS and their breakdown products; 
(iii) if feasible, estimate human exposure 
to individual or total PFAS to determine rel-
ative source contributions for various expo-
sure pathways (such as air, water, soil, or 
food); 
(iv) determine the range of solubility, sta-
bility, and volatility of PFAS most likely to 
be found in the environment and the result-
ing prevalence in animals and humans; 
(v) give consideration as to whether chem-
ical category-based approaches would be ap-
propriate for evaluating PFAS toxicity and 
exposure; 
(vi) identify research needed to advance ex-
posure estimation to individual or total 
PFAS; and 
(vii) identify research needed to advance 
toxicity and hazard assessment of individual 
or total PFAS.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. BEYER) and the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma (Mr. LUCAS) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Virginia. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 7289, 
the bill now under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 7289, the Federal PFAS Research 
Evaluation Act. 
PFAS are a class of substances that 
are commonly referred to as forever 
chemicals because of their persistence 
throughout the environment. These 
chemicals are found within countless 
household items such as cooking appli-
ances, weatherproof clothing, and even 
food packaging. 
While this heat-, water-, and oil-re-
sistant chemical was created over 80 
years ago to solve problems, it has be-
come increasingly clear it has created 
more problems than it solved. 
Traces of PFAS can also be found 
within 
the 
human 
body, 
animals, 
drinking water, fish, and soil. In fact, a 
recent report by the CDC found PFAS 
was in the blood of 97 percent of Ameri-
cans. 
Despite the shocking finding on the 
prevalence of PFAS in the human 
body, there is little data that examines 
the long-term health and environ-
mental implications of these artificial 
chemicals. There are also many re-
search gaps in our understanding of 
these substances overall. 
H.R. 7289 would help address these 
gaps by authorizing the Environmental 
Protection Agency to enter into agree-
ments with the National Academies of 
Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to 
study the impact of PFAS on human 
and environmental health through a 
series of reports. These reports would 
touch on outstanding questions such as 
human exposure pathways to PFAS. 
They would also help to identify crit-
ical research gaps related to managing 
PFAS and examining safe chemical al-
ternatives. 
Finally, these studies would inform 
an Office of Science and Technology 
Policy implementation plan for Fed-
eral research, development, and dem-
onstration activities for PFAS. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my col-
leagues on the Science Committee, 
Representatives LIZZIE FLETCHER and 
PETER
MEIJER, for introducing this 
commonsense and bipartisan legisla-
tion, and I encourage my colleagues to 
support its passage. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. LUCAS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 7289, the Federal PFAS Research 
Evaluation Act. 
PFAS is an acronym for a large 
range of manufactured chemicals that 
are exceptionally strong and durable 
and have the ability to withstand high 
temperatures. 
These 
characteristics 
make them incredibly valuable in 
countless products, from cell phones to 
wind turbine components to military 
aircraft to everything in between. 
The high strength and durability of 
PFAS also mean they don’t break down 
easily in the environment. But their 
essential use in industry and consumer

products is exactly why it is important 
we remember not to villainize the en-
tire category of chemicals. 
The hazard and risk profiles of var-
ious PFAS are immensely different. 
Using certain PFAS in a controlled, re-
sponsible manner is safe and effective. 
Understanding the distinct properties 
of each of these chemicals will allow us 
to continue the important uses and 
benefits of PFAS technologies. 
That is why I rise in support of H.R. 
7289. This bill seeks to increase our un-
derstanding of PFAS by directing the 
Environmental Protection Agency to 
work with the National Academies to 
conduct two studies. 
The first study is to better under-
stand human exposure, behavior, and 
toxicity of PFAS. It will allow us to 
better address research and knowledge 
gaps that were identified by the Na-
tional Academies in 2020. 
The second study is focused on under-
standing the extent and implications of 
PFAS contamination, as well as re-
search needed to manage and treat con-
tamination and develop safe alter-
natives. 
b 1500 
Together, these studies will help us 
better address PFAS using the best 
available science. 
At the end of the day, removing 
harmful PFAS from production and 
cleaning up legacy contaminations to 
protect human health is a bipartisan 
issue. But we need to understand the 
full extent of what we are seeking to 
remove, how to best do it, and the po-
tential implications, if executed. 
I thank the gentleman from Michi-
gan (Mr. MEIJER), my colleague on the 
Science, Space and Technology Com-
mittee, for leading this bill, and being 
an informed, smart advocate on this 
issue. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I have 
no further requests for time to speak 
on this bill, and I am prepared to close. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LUCAS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
5 minutes to the gentleman from 
Michigan (Mr. MEIJER). 
Mr. MEIJER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank our ranking member, Mr. LUCAS, 
for yielding me time and for his contin-
ued leadership on the Science, Space 
and Technology Committee. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 7289, the Fed-
eral PFAS Research Evaluation Act, is 
a bipartisan bill that offers both rea-
sonable 
and 
pragmatic 
action 
on 
PFAS. I was proud to introduce it with 
the gentlewoman from Texas (Mrs. 
FLETCHER), my colleague and friend. 
PFAS chemicals, also known as per- 
and polyfluoroalkyl substances, can be 
found in nonstick pans, firefighting 
foam, food packaging, medical devices, 
and many other everyday products. 
There are hundreds of PFAS com-
pounds, and the makeup of these for-
ever chemicals makes them difficult to 
break down in nature. But given the 
sheer number of compounds and the 
complexity of each, there is much we 
still do not know about the chemicals, 
including where they might have been 
used. 
In my home State of Michigan, it is 
estimated there could be as many as 
11,300 potential sites where PFAS may 
have been used. 
The response to PFAS requires a bal-
anced approach, and I do not believe we 
should have to pick between encour-
aging economic growth or protecting 
human health and the environment. 
We need to ensure that any potential 
regulation is based on strong and 
science-based evidence, and that is 
where H.R. 7289 will play a critical 
role. With this bill, we will learn more 
about both the human health and envi-
ronmental effects of PFAS. The bill in-
cludes the health effects related to ex-
posure and toxicity of PFAS, as well as 
the effects of PFAS on the environ-
ment, including the extent of PFAS 
contamination, treatment, but also al-
ternatives. 
The studies that the bill authorizes 
will be conducted by our leading Na-
tional Academies, widely regarded as 
the most prestigious and accurate in-
stitutions for objective scientific evi-
dence. 
Once completed, these studies will 
provide us with a clearer picture of 
Federal research related to PFAS, and 
we will be able to better understand 
both the extent of problems and where 
the Federal research enterprise can 
best assist in seeking solutions. With 
such information, we can take mean-
ingful steps toward eliminating PFAS 
contamination because we will know 
exactly how and where it exists in our 
world today. 
The first step toward solving any 
problem is understanding exactly what 
you are facing. H.R. 7289 offers this 
commonsense 
solution 
to 
support 
PFAS research, our understanding of 
contamination, and how the chemicals 
behave. 
Again, I thank my colleague on the 
Science, Space and Technology Com-
mittee, Representative LIZZIE FLETCH-
ER, for introducing this legislation and 
working with me to amend it in a bi-
partisan manner before coming to the 
floor. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this important piece 
of legislation. 
Mr. LUCAS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume to 
close. 
In 
December 
of 
last 
year, 
the 
Science, Space and Technology Com-
mittee held a hearing on research and 
development relating to PFAS. I was 
impressed to hear just how far along 
the companies are when it comes to 
technologies that can safely and effec-
tively destroy PFAS in the environ-
ment. 
I mention that because it is part of 
why I am optimistic about our ability 
to improve our environmental steward-
ship. When it comes to protecting 
human health and the environment, we 
are 
making 
tremendous 
progress 
through technology. There are very few 
problems, if any, that innovation can-
not address. We can spur that innova-
tion by arming ourselves with the best 
possible information, data, and sci-
entific knowledge. 
H.R. 7289 does exactly that for PFAS. 
It doesn’t label all PFAS as deadly, and 
it doesn’t ban using it. It simply iden-
tifies areas of research that will help 
us address PFAS using the best avail-
able science. 
I 
thank 
Representative 
LIZZIE 
FLETCHER for introducing this legisla-
tion and working in a bipartisan man-
ner to advance it, and I also thank 
Science, Space and Technology Com-
mittee 
members, 
Representatives 
MEIJER
and POSEY, for cosponsoring 
this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I, too, 
urge my colleagues to support H.R. 
7289, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
I rise in support of H.R. 7289, the Federal 
PFAS Research Evaluation Act, as amended. 
This bill, introduced by Representatives LIZZIE 
FLETCHER and PETER MEIJER, is another ex-
ample of strong bipartisanship from Science 
Committee members on a critical issue facing 
our Nation. 
Manufactured carbon and fluorine-based 
chemicals, known as PFAS, are pervasive 
throughout the environment due to their inabil-
ity to be broken down. Traces of PFAS can be 
found in everyday household items, clothing, 
and even in our drinking water. They have 
also increasingly been found to have negative 
impacts on public and environmental health. 
Our low-income communities, and commu-
nities of color, are at risk for high levels of ex-
posure to PFAS due to these communities 
being disproportionately located near chemical 
plants containing PFAS. This can lead to high-
er instances of morbidity and mortality for 
these communities as well. 
To effectively reduce the presence of PFAS 
in our environment, we must be guided by 
strong science. The Federal PFAS Research 
Evaluation Act would direct the Environmental 
Protection Agency to enter into agreements 
with the National Academies of Sciences, En-
gineering, and Medicine to publish studies that 
identify major research gaps associated with 
our understanding of PFAS. These studies 
would also inform the Office of Science and 
Technology Policy’s work to develop a com-
prehensive federal research effort for PFAS. 
Families across the Nation depend on the 
Federal government to ensure their safety 
when it comes to PFAS contamination in 
drinking water and consumer goods. The find-
ings of the studies authorized in this bill will 
help support ongoing Federal efforts to protect 
our communities from the dangers of PFAS. I 
urge my colleagues to support this critical, bi-
partisan, bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. 
BEYER) that the House suspend the

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to

Act. 
Scientific integrity is a critical com-
ponent of scientific research. 
NOAA supports the American public 
in a variety of ways but is well known 
for its provision of civilian weather 
forecasts, watches, and warnings. This 
is why it is important for the agency to

be considered a trusted scientific au-
thority. The role of NOAA’s chief sci-
entist is pivotal in this respect. 
While this position is statutorily de-
fined, prior to this bill, the role lacked 
clear expectations and responsibilities 
or even qualifications. This has led to 
inconsistencies in how the role has 
been carried out historically. 
This bill clarifies the role of the chief 
scientist to ensure that they adhere to 
and uphold scientific integrity direc-
tives at NOAA. 
This commitment to scientific integ-
rity at the highest levels of NOAA’s 
leadership further underscores its im-
portance to the agency’s mission. This 
bill also requires the NOAA adminis-
trator to consider candidates with an 
established background of practice-led 
research and scientific achievement in 
fields relevant to NOAA’s mission. This 
ensures the chief scientist will have 
pertinent experiences and expertise to 
draw from while carrying out this role. 
H.R. 3952 also establishes an Office of 
the Chief Scientist within NOAA. Criti-
cally, this office will support the chief 
scientist’s efforts to foster an environ-
ment that would encourage the recruit-
ment and retention of a diverse sci-
entific workforce. Diversity is a key 
component of ensuring that all voices 
and research perspectives are heard. 
Attracting scientists with a diversity 
of backgrounds and expertise will allow 
NOAA to approach research questions 
from new perspectives. 
I also take a moment to acknowledge 
NOAA’s recent appointment of Dr. 
Sarah Kapnick as NOAA’s chief sci-
entist. Dr. Kapnick has a rich back-
ground that includes experience as a 
physical scientist at NOAA and more 
recently in the private sector. She em-
bodies many of the qualities identified 
for consideration in a chief scientist 
that this bill requires, and I congratu-
late her on her selection. 
I also thank the gentlewoman from 
New Jersey (Ms. SHERRILL) and the 
gentleman from Iowa (Mr. FEENSTRA) 
for working together to introduce this 
bipartisan bill. I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill’s passage. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. LUCAS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of H.R. 3952, the NOAA Chief 
Scientist Act, and I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
The National Oceanic and Atmos-
pheric Administration, or NOAA to 
most of us, has a broad mission that in-
cludes monitoring and conserving our 
coasts, strengthening fisheries, fore-
casting severe weather, and improving 
emergency management. That is just a 
small sample of what they do. 
Their work either involves directly 
conducting research or using research 
to inform how they can provide the 
best services to American industries 
and communities. That is why the posi-
tion of chief scientist at NOAA is so 
important. The chief scientist is tasked 
with advising the NOAA administrator, 
providing direction for NOAA’s science 
and technology policies, and leading 
scientific integrity efforts. 
This bill doesn’t create a new role for 
the chief scientist at NOAA. That posi-
tion has been utilized by the agency for 
a long time now. Instead, in recogni-
tion of how important it is for the 
agency to have a chief scientist, this 
bill simply makes that role’s existing 
responsibilities into law. 
It also ensures that the position will 
never be vacant for long by creating a 
process for naming an acting chief sci-
entist when the role is empty. And hav-
ing an office support staff for the chief 
scientist will make sure critical activi-
ties don’t slip through the cracks. 
We rely on NOAA to perform critical 
R&D and to implement sound scientific 
policies. Doing so requires capable sci-
entific research, and this bill ensures 
that NOAA will always have that. It is 
especially timely, given that earlier 
this month Sarah Kapnick was named 
to the role of chief scientist at NOAA. 
I wish her luck there. I hope she will 
continue NOAA’s long history of sci-
entific excellence. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I have 
no further requests for time, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LUCAS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume to 
close. 
Madam Speaker, the NOAA Chief 
Scientist Act is smart legislation that 
codifies an important existing role at 
NOAA. 
A scientific agency needs scientific 
leadership, and H.R. 3952 ensures that 
NOAA will always have that in place. 
I thank the gentlewoman from New 
Jersey (Ms. SHERRILL), the chair of our 
Environment Subcommittee, for intro-
ducing this bill. I also thank the gen-
tleman from Iowa (Mr. FEENSTRA), the 
ranking member of the Research and 
Technology Subcommittee, for leading 
the Republican side. 
Madam Speaker, this is a smart, sim-
ple bill, and I urge my colleagues to 
support it, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I urge 
my colleagues to support H.R. 3952, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
I rise I support of H.R. 3952, the NOAA Chief 
Scientist Act, as amended. This bill takes 
measures to better support and define the role 
of the Chief Scientist at the National Oceanic 
and Atmospheric Administration. 
One of my great priorities as Chairwoman of 
the Science Committee has been reinforcing 
the importance of scientific integrity across our 
federal science agencies. The NOAA Chief 
Scientist Act prioritizes scientific integrity at 
the highest levels of leadership at NOAA by 
requiring the Chief Scientist to publicly ac-
knowledge his or her commitment to agency 
scientific integrity policies. Scientific integrity 
and transparency are integral to ensuring fed-
eral agencies can maintain their status as 
trusted resources to Americans. 
This bill lays out qualifications for the Chief 
Scientist, as this role should be held by some-
one with expertise and experience in the field. 
This bill includes additional provisions that 
would support the expanded role of the Chief 
Scientist and make the science and tech-
nology activities of the agency transparent and 
accessible to the public. 
This bipartisan bill was introduced by Rep-
resentative SHERRILL of New Jersey and Rep-
resentative FEENSTRA from Iowa, who worked 
together on its provisions. I am proud of the 
Science Committee’s work this Congress to 
develop scientifically sound, bipartisan legisla-
tion. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of a bill 
that advances scientific integrity at NOAA and 
urge my colleagues to support it. 
I include in the RECORD an exchange of let-
ters on H.R. 3952 sent between the Com-
mittee on Science, Space, and Technology 
and the Committee on Natural Resources.

(H.R. 7361) to upgrade the communica-
tions service used by the National 
Weather Service, and for other pur-
poses. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 7361 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘National 
Weather Service Communications Improve-
ment Act’’. 
SEC. 2. NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE COMMU-
NICATIONS. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Title IV of the Weather

from Virginia. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
include extraneous material on H.R. 
7361, the bill now under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Virginia? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 7361, the National Weather Serv-
ice Communications Improvement Act. 
This bipartisan bill, introduced by 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Iowa 
(Mr. 
FEENSTRA) directs the National Weath-
er Service to improve its current in-
stant messaging communication serv-
ice, also known as NWSChat. 
NWSChat is a vital tool used by Na-
tional Weather Service professionals to 
communicate with emergency man-
agers, the media, and other strategic 
partners during high-impact and severe 
weather events. This tool ensures that 
the media and emergency response 
managers can retrieve real-time infor-
mation to help protect Americans and 
their 
property 
during 
dangerous 
events. 
However, NWSChat has experienced 
several issues recently which have 
caused delays in the National Weather 
Service’s 
ability 
to 
share 
critical 
weather information. This bill would 
help to address these issues by requir-
ing the National Weather Service to 
transition NWSChat to an up-to-date, 
cloud-based commercial platform. 
Just last week, the National Weather 
Service announced that it would be up-
grading its chat service to use the com-
mercially available Slack collaborative 
platform. It was reassuring to see the 
Weather Service take this step to ad-
dress the recent outages and issues 
with NWSChat. 
This bill will help support the agency 
with clear congressional direction and 
corresponding authorization of appro-
priations language to help ensure a 
seamless transition of NWSChat to this 
new platform. 
Reliable and uninterrupted commu-
nication 
is 
critical 
during 
severe 
weather events. The National Weather 
Service Communications Improvement 
Act will support the improvement of 
this lifesaving tool. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time 
Mr. LUCAS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 7361, the National Weather Serv-
ice Communications Improvement Act. 
Right now, the National Weather Serv-
ice is years behind when it comes to 
the internal communications system 
known as NWSChat. 
This instant messaging system is 
how forecasters and local emergency 
managers 
communicate 
with 
each 
other before, during, and after a severe 
weather event unfolds. This instanta-
neous communication is critical to 
their ability to warn and prepare com-
munities for dangerous storms quickly 
and accurately. 
It was developed decades ago out of 
necessity by employees within the Na-
tional Weather Service, not by a com-
pany that specializes in application de-
velopment. Therefore, NWSChat has 
had its fair share of hiccups, especially 
when a large number of users try to ac-
cess it at once. 
b 1515 
Surprisingly, the heaviest user traf-
fic is usually during a large, destruc-
tive weather event when officials are 
trying to anticipate what is coming to-
ward their communities. 
H.R. 7361 will help solve this problem 
by authorizing the National Weather 
Service to upgrade their instant mes-
saging service to a commercial, off-the- 
shelf solution. These services can han-
dle a large number of users and easily 
adapt to technology upgrades, giving 
our forecasters a flexible and modern 
messaging service. 
Living in Tornado Alley, I am very 
familiar with how quickly storms can 
form and change direction, so I can tell 
you that if a small upgrade like this 
makes storm warnings even a few sec-
onds faster, that time can absolutely 
be the difference between life and 
death. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my Com-
mittee on Science, Space, and Tech-
nology colleague, Mr. FEENSTRA, for in-
troducing this bill. I urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LUCAS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
3 minutes to the gentleman from Iowa 
(Mr. FEENSTRA). 
Mr. FEENSTRA. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Ranking Member LUCAS
for 
yielding and for his leadership on the 
Committee on Science, Space, and 
Technology. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 7361, the Na-
tional Weather Service Communica-
tions Improvement Act, is a bill that 
was born from a tragedy in my home 
State of Iowa. 
On March 5, a tornado outbreak in 
central and southwest Iowa killed 
seven people. It was the deadliest 
storm in our State since 2008. 
During this storm, an issue at the 
National Weather Service caused up to 
a 7-minute delay from when meteorolo-
gists issued warnings to when the pub-
lic was alerted. In Iowa, we know that 
even the smallest delays can be a mat-
ter of life and death. 
Then, just a month later, in April, 
eight tornadoes were confirmed during 
a storm. Luckily, this time around, 
there were no deaths. Despite that, we 
had 135-mile-an-hour winds and severe

building damage. But that didn’t stop 
some 
National 
Weather 
Service 
websites and NWS Chat, NWS’ out-
dated emergency communications net-
work, from crashing because of in-
creased traffic. 
The bottom line is, NWS must have a 
functional 
and 
reliable 
emergency 
communications system that can keep 
people informed and out of harm’s way 
during severe weather crises. 
H.R. 7361 specifically authorizes an 
internal messaging service upgrade by 
giving NOAA the authority to transi-
tion from NWS Chat to a commercial, 
off-the-shelf solution. This type of 
commercial solution will allow nearly 
unlimited users, so future growth and 
increased traffic will not be a problem. 
It also allows NWS Chat to take advan-
tage of new technologies as they 
emerge. 
In fact, earlier this month, NWS 
signed a contract to use Slack as the 
basis for the next generation of the 
NWS Chat service. While this is a step 
in the right direction, the legislation is 
still needed to ensure the upgrade is 
fully supported and completed. The 
sooner this quick and easy solution is 
implemented, the faster local emer-
gency managers can alert the public to 
severe weather that will save lives. 
I thank my Iowa colleagues, Rep-
resentatives AXNE, MILLER-MEEKS, and 
HINSON, for working with me to put 
this legislation forward. 
I also thank my Committee on 
Science, Space, and Technology col-
leagues for helping me cosponsor this 
bill as well. I look forward to its pas-
sage and encourage all of my col-
leagues to support it. 
Mr. LUCAS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time for clos-
ing. 
Madam Speaker, as my colleagues 
have made clear in their support of this 
bill today, every second matters when 
it comes to reacting to extreme weath-
er events. 
NWS Chat is yet another tool in our 
toolbox to make sure that commu-
nities have the earliest possible warn-
ing of what is heading their way. We 
need a fast and reliable messaging 
service that doesn’t glitch when we 
need it most. 
That is why H.R. 7361 is a simple but 
necessary bill. By upgrading the Na-
tional Weather Service’s communica-
tions, we can give our most vulnerable 
communities 
the 
information 
they 
need to protect lives and property. 
I again thank my colleague, Mr. 
FEENSTRA, for bringing together the 
entire Iowa House delegation to sup-
port this bill after witnessing the de-
structive power of a tornado outbreak 
in their State. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I also 
urge my colleagues to support H.R. 
7361, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
I rise in support of H.R. 7361, the National 
Weather Service Communications Improve-
ment Act. 
We are seeing the impacts of climate 
change on severe weather events across the 
country. Inclement weather is more intense 
than ever and happening more frequently. For-
tunately, due to the advancement of fore-
casting science and dissemination, we have 
not seen a corresponding increase in deaths. 
With climate change supercharging severe 
weather, we need to ensure emergency re-
sponse professionals can communicate with-
out interruption. This communication is vital to 
warn and protect Americans during times of 
severe weather events. 
The NWS Communications Improvement 
Act is a bipartisan bill led by Congressman 
FEENSTRA of the Science Committee. It would 
require NOAA to upgrade the aging National 
Weather Service’s instant communications 
system to current technology standards. The 
current communication system, known as 
NWS Chat, has faced delays and outages dur-
ing recent weather events. This critical tool 
needs to be updated to address these issues 
and improve reliability. The safety of all Ameri-
cans depends on it. 
The House’s consideration of this bill is very 
timely as the National Weather Service an-
nounced last week that it will be transitioning 
NWS Chat to a commercially available instant 
messaging platform. Congressional direction, 
and the corresponding authorization of appro-
priations language in this bipartisan common-
sense bill will support the Weather Service’s 
ongoing efforts on this important issue. 
With today’s technology, disruptions in com-
munication during emergency events should 
never occur, let alone be common. This critical 
bill will update NWS Chat, a very important 
communication tool, to be more dependable. I 
urge my colleagues to support its passage.

(H.R. 3588) to coordinate Federal re-
search and development efforts focused 
on modernizing mathematics in STEM 
education through mathematical and 
statistical modeling, including data-

The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 3588 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Mathe-
matical and Statistical Modeling Education 
Act’’. 
SEC. 2. MATHEMATICAL AND STATISTICAL MOD-
ELING EDUCATION. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) The mathematics taught in schools, in-
cluding statistical problem solving and data 
science, is not keeping pace with the rapidly 
evolving needs of the public and private sec-
tor, resulting in a STEM skills shortage and 
employers needing to expend resources to 
train and upskill employees. 
(2) According to the Bureau of Labor Sta-
tistics, the United States will need 1,000,000 
additional STEM professionals than it is on 
track to produce in the coming decade. 
(3) The field of data science, which is rel-
evant in almost every workplace, relies on 
the ability to work in teams and use com-
putational tools to do mathematical and sta-
tistical problem solving. 
(4) Many STEM occupations offer higher 
wages, more opportunities for advancement, 
and a higher degree of job security than non- 
STEM jobs. 
(5) The STEM workforce relies on com-
putational and data-driven discovery, deci-
sion making, and predictions, from models 
that often must quantify uncertainty, as in 
weather predictions, spread of disease, or fi-
nancial forecasting. 
(6) 
Most 
fields, 
including 
analytics, 
science, economics, publishing, marketing, 
actuarial science, operations research, engi-
neering, and medicine, require data savvy, 
including the ability to select reliable 
sources of data, identify and remove errors 
in data, recognize and quantify uncertainty 
in data, visualize and analyze data, and use 
data to develop understanding or make pre-
dictions. 
(7) Rapidly emerging fields, such as artifi-
cial intelligence, machine learning, quantum 
computing and quantum information, all 
rely on mathematical and statistical con-
cepts, which are critical to prove under what 
circumstances an algorithm or experiment 
will work and when it will fail. 
(8) Military academies have a long tradi-
tion in teaching mathematical modeling and 
would benefit from the ability to recruit stu-
dents with this expertise from their other 
school experiences. 
(9) Mathematical modeling has been a 
strong educational priority globally, espe-
cially in China, where participation in 
United States mathematical modeling chal-
lenges in high school and higher education is 
orders of magnitude higher than in the 
United States, and Chinese teams are taking 
a majority of the prizes. 
(10) Girls participate in mathematical 
modeling challenges at all levels at similar 
levels as boys, while in traditional mathe-
matical competitions girls participate less 
and drop out at every stage. Students cite 
opportunity for teamwork, using mathe-
matics and statistics in meaningful contexts, 
ability to use computation, and emphasis on 
communication as reasons for continued par-
ticipation in modeling challenges.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. BEYER) and the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma (Mr. LUCAS) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Virginia. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 3588, 
the bill now under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Virginia? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 3588, the Mathematical and Sta-
tistical Modeling Education Act. I 
thank 
Representatives 
CHRISSY 
HOULAHAN
and JIM
BAIRD
for intro-
ducing this bill. 
U.S. capabilities in science and inno-
vation are critical for our future pros-
perity, national security, and global 
competitiveness. I am thrilled that this 
week the House will consider landmark 
legislation 
that 
will 
accelerate 
progress on cutting-edge science and 
technology. However, we cannot fully 
realize this vision unless we build a do-
mestic STEM workforce that is poised 
to turn these investments into break-
through discoveries and transformative 
innovations. To that end, we must ad-
dress the longstanding challenges in K– 
12 STEM education. 
H.R. 3588 will advance research to im-
prove mathematics education by incor-
porating 
statistical 
modeling 
into 
mathematics curriculum. We know 
that 
students 
from 
diverse 
back-
grounds are attracted to STEM if they 
can see it as a tool for solving real- 
world challenges. This bill will help re-
searchers develop innovative teaching 
methods to do just that. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support the bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LUCAS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise in support of H.R. 3588, the 
Mathematical and Statistical Modeling 
Education Act. 
This bill would direct the National 
Science Foundation to provide com-
petitive grants to support the research 
and 
development 
of 
curricula 
and 
teaching methods to improve mathe-
matical and statistical modeling edu-
cation. Ensuring that our teachers are 
well equipped to encourage student in-
terest and involvement in STEM fields 
is a key component of stimulating 
America’s STEM workforce and bol-
stering our competitiveness. 
Mathematics underpins the critical 
thinking skills we use every day, from 
managing a budget to following a rec-
ipe, even to estimating how long votes 
will take today. 
As more and more jobs become tech- 
reliant, our students will need mathe-
matical and computational skills to 
keep up with the changing workplace 
and fill the growing demand for a do-
mestic STEM-literate workforce. 
H.R. 3588 is supported by the Amer-
ican Statistical Association, the Na-
tional Council of Teachers of Mathe-
matics, the American Society of Me-
chanical Engineers, and the Business 
Software Alliance, among other stake-
holders. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my col-
league, Dr. Baird, for working in a bi-
partisan way to advance this legisla-
tion. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this legislation, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
3 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Pennsylvania (Ms. HOULAHAN). 
Ms. HOULAHAN. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of my bill, H.R. 
3588, the bipartisan Mathematical and 
Statistical Modeling Education Act. 
This is a very straightforward bipar-
tisan bill. It would modernize the math 
curricula and improve K–12 science, 
technology, engineering, and mathe-
matics, otherwise known as STEM, 
education in the United States. 
We 
know 
that 
STEM 
education 
taught in schools today is simply not 
keeping pace with the rapidly evolving 
needs of the public and private sectors. 
We also know that this lack of skills 
has a direct correlation with the STEM 
skills shortage across our Nation. 
To fix this, my bill will help schools 
update their math curricula to make 
them more relevant and applicable to 
real-world scenarios. 
The National Science Foundation 
would be tasked with providing com-
petitive grants focused on modernizing 
STEM 
education 
through 
mathe-
matical and statistical modeling, in-
cluding data-driven and computational 
thinking. It will also direct the Na-
tional Academies of Sciences, Engi-
neering, and Medicine to conduct a 
study on the same topic. 
As an engineer myself and a former 
chemistry teacher and entrepreneur, I 
know firsthand just how vital this is 
for the next generation and for the fu-
ture of our workforce in our Nation. 
According to the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics, the United States will need 
1 million additional STEM profes-
sionals than it is on track to produce 
in the coming decade alone. 
Thankfully, with this legislation, we 
have the opportunity to provide tan-
gible critical thinking skills to the 
next generation that will enable them 
to succeed in the workplace and be-
yond. It is far past time to bring prob-
lem-solving into the 21st century. 
When I was in school, math was often 
portrayed as a one-dimensional skill 
that existed solely in the math class-
room. Let’s now show our students 
that a skill set in STEM is invaluable 
to analyzing trends on social media or 
predicting sports outcomes, and it is as 
valuable for that as it is to succeed in 
any chemistry class. 
I am very grateful to Representative 
JIM BAIRD for joining me, to Chair-
woman EDDIE
BERNICE
JOHNSON
and 
Ranking Member LUCAS for their lead-
ership on this topic, and to everyone 
else who played a role in bringing this 
very important and bipartisan bill to 
the floor. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this bill. 
Mr. LUCAS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time for clos-
ing. 
Madam Speaker, as teachers prepare 
for the next generation of the Amer-
ican workforce, it is vital that we in-
vest in the best STEM education cur-
ricula and teaching methods. That is 
why I strongly support this bipartisan 
legislation, which will bolster invest-
ments in mathematics and statistical 
modeling curricula. 
Madam Speaker, I again thank Dr. 
Baird for his hard work to advance this 
legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote in support of this bill, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time for clos-
ing. 
Madam Speaker, so far this year, I 
have 
completed 
two 
undergraduate 
mathematics courses at George Mason 
University. Calculus II starts on Au-
gust 22. 
I will tell you personally the evo-
lution of the teaching of math has 
come so far since I graduated from col-
lege. I am very excited by this legisla-
tion. The thought that we can take so 
much progress in teaching and soft-
ware to our next generation of students 
is very exciting.

three individuals diagnosed with a COVID–19 
infection experiences a disruption of regular 
cognitive processes within six months of 
such diagnosis. 
(4) Research is urgently needed to better 
understand why disruption in regular cog-
nitive processes occur in patients as a con-
sequence of a COVID–19 infection and how 
long such disruptions can continue after re-
covery. 
(5) The National Science Foundation has a 
deep history of supporting interdisciplinary, 
basic research that spans the social, behav-
ioral, and fundamental biological sciences 
and paves the way for scientific advance-

tion, and the potential relevance of such in-
fection to the disruption of regular cognitive 
processes. 
(4) Studies on the relevance of psycho-
logical and psychosocial factors, including 
major disruptions of physical health, mental 
health, and economic stability associated 
with the COVID–19 pandemic, on the disrup-
tion of regular cognitive processes, including 
an identification and evaluation of such fac-
tors.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 7180, 
the bill now under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Virginia? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 7180, the Brycen Gray and Ben 
Price COVID–19 Cognitive Research 
Act. I thank Representative GONZALEZ 
for introducing this important bill. 
The COVID–19 crisis has disrupted 
our lives in countless ways over the 
past 2 years. As many of us continue to 
pick up the pieces and settle into a new 
normal, we can’t lose sight of those 
who haven’t been as fortunate. 
Early research results indicate that a 
COVID–19 infection may leave individ-
uals with an increased risk of devel-
oping mental health conditions. Mil-
lions who have been infected with 
COVID–19 now find themselves saddled 
with crippling anxiety, depression, and 
sleep problems, and they may be at an 
increased risk of death by suicide and 
drug overdose. 
b 1530 
While researchers are raising alarms 
about these risks, improved data col-
lection and additional research is need-
ed to better understand the mental 
health implications of a COVID–19 in-
fection. This bill directs the National

neurological effects of COVID, particu-
larly in adolescents. It also instructs 
NSF to commission a National Acad-
emies study on the disruption of cog-
nitive 
processes 
associated 
with 
COVID. 
This bill is named for two men who 
died by suicide after suffering neuro-
logical problems caused by COVID–19. 
Tragically, there have been numer-
ous instances of psychosis developed 
after COVID illnesses. The neurological 
effects of this disease is not well under-
stood, and H.R. 7180 will help to change 
that. 
Research on this issue has been pro-
gressing as we continue to learn more 
about the long-term effects of the dis-
ease. This bill will help accelerate 
these efforts to better inform the pub-
lic and medical community; and hope-
fully, it will prevent more tragic 
deaths from occurring. 
I again thank Representative GON-
ZALEZ for his hard work on behalf of his 
constituents. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this legislation, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LUCAS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from Ohio (Mr. GONZALEZ). 
Mr. GONZALEZ of Ohio. Madam 
Speaker, I rise in support of my bill, 
the Brycen Gray and Ben Price COVID– 
19 Cognitive Research Act. I was proud 
to introduce this legislation alongside 
my friends Ms. WILD, Mr. KINZINGER, 
Mr. 
CA´ RDENAS, 
Mr. 
MEIJER, 
Mr. 
PETERS, Mr. JOYCE, and Mr. GIBBS, and 
I thank each of them for their leader-
ship on the issue. I also thank the two 
wonderful leaders of our committee, 
Chairwoman 
JOHNSON
and 
Ranking 
Member LUCAS, and their staffs for 
moving this important legislation for-
ward. 
Before I get into the heart of the bill, 
I will take a minute to share a little 
bit about who Brycen Gray and Ben 
Price were. 
Brycen Gray was a 17-year-old young 
man from my district in northeast 
Ohio. Adored by his parents, Shawn 
and Tara, as well as his brothers, 
Ricky 
and 
Patrick, 
Brycen 
sadly 
passed a little over a year ago. Known 
for his quick wit and sense of humor 
with just the right amount of sarcasm, 
Brycen could inspire the kind of laugh-
ter that makes you cry. Brycen was 
loving, 
charismatic, 
and 
selfless. 
Brycen was the kind of kid every par-
ent dreams of. 
Ben Price was a 48-year-old loving 
husband to his wife Jennifer, and a de-
voted father to their two amazing chil-
dren Jett and Maya. Sadly, we lost Ben 
at the beginning of last year. Ben was 
a busy small business owner and farm-
er from the outskirts of Chicago, but 
his life revolved around his family, 
friends, and community. One of his pas-
sions was to jump-start the Special 
Connections of Grundy County, whose 
mission is to connect people with dis-
abilities, like his beloved son Jett, to 
their community. Ben led by example 
and loved without reservation. 
Both Brycen and Ben tragically 
passed after battles with cognitive im-
pairments caused by COVID–19. Despite 
having no history of mental illness, 
each of them began to battle symptoms 
such as anxiety, panic, and paranoia. 
The disease took Brycen and Ben from 
two of the healthiest, most vibrant 
people you could find to individuals so 
debilitated that they could not bear to 
live another day. While they fought to 
the bitter end, each chose to end their 
pain. 
There is no greater joy than being a 
parent. For those of us blessed to have 
children, we know it is the most impor-
tant job any of us will ever have. To be 
sure, there are plenty of challenges at-
tributed to the job. There is nothing 
more rewarding than watching your 
children grow, while at the same time 
there is nothing more terrifying than 
watching your children experience the 
tragedies that befell Brycen and Ben. 
That is why the health and safety of 
our children should always come first. 
That is exactly why I started working 
on this bill. If we believe in protecting 
our families, we need to act now and 
start finding answers to why COVID–19 
can have such a significant impact on 
the brain. 
The legislation before us today is an-
other important step in that effort. 
Thus far, we have learned that as many 
as one in three COVID–19 survivors ex-
perience a cognitive impairment fol-
lowing their acute infection. More 
alarming, nearly one in eight COVID–19 
survivors are diagnosed with an illness 
for the first time. With nearly 80 mil-
lion documented cases of infection in 
the U.S., the health implications could 
be massive. 
While anxiety, mood, and brain fog 
are among the most common symp-
toms, researchers have also uncovered 
a prevalence of serious complications 
such as psychosis, dementia, paralysis, 
and brain hemorrhages. Moreover, ad-
ditional impairments related to cog-
nitive syndrome like impairments in 
memory, executive function, attention, 
and speed of information are common 
among COVID–19 survivors. 
Despite the significant progress made 
by researchers to improve our under-
standing of COVID–19, it remains un-
clear how the virus alters brain func-
tion, who is most at risk, and what can 
be done to quickly diagnose and treat 
impacted patients. 
The Brycen Gray and Ben Price 
COVID–19 Cognitive Research Act aims 
to close these gaps by accelerating our 
research efforts. Specifically, it au-
thorizes the NSF to award grants on a 
competitive basis to support inter-
disciplinary research on the disruption 
of regular cognitive processes associ-
ated with both short-term and long- 
term COVID–19 infections. 
Grantees will be tasked with car-
rying out foundational studies on the 
effects of cognition, emotion, neural 
structure, and function related to 
COVID–19 infections, developing new 
tools to evaluate cognitive disruptions 
from COVID–19, and examining the rel-
evance of psychological and psycho-
social factors. In addition, the bill 
stands up a team at the National Acad-
emies to study and produce a report on 
the issue. 
We can’t bring Brycen and Ben back, 
but we can ensure that their memories 
live on. I don’t want to lose any more 
Americans because we weren’t bold 
enough to take on an issue that might 
scare us, an issue we don’t fully under-
stand, an issue that is far more com-
mon than many in this body realize. 
No family should have to endure the 
tragedy of losing a loved one from 
COVID–19’s 
cognitive 
impacts. 
The 
Brycen Gray and Ben Price COVID–19 
Cognitive Research Act ensures we will 
do everything in our power to find an-
swers and deliver solutions. We cannot 
afford to lose any more time. 
Again, I thank Chairwoman JOHNSON 
and Ranking Member LUCAS for their 
constant, incredible leadership on our 
committee. I urge my colleagues to 
support the bill. 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I am 
prepared to close, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. LUCAS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
This legislation reflects how Con-
gress can work in a bipartisan way to 
address difficult issues that our con-
stituents are facing. The deaths of 
Brycen Gray and Ben Price due to 
COVID psychosis were unexpected and 
tragic. 
While their memories will live on 
through their families and friends, we 
can give them a further memorial 
through the passage of this legislation 
and, hopefully, prevent more tragedies 
like this in the future. 
H.R. 7180 represents a grassroots ef-
fort to address the issue in a thought-
ful and meaningful way. 
Again, I thank my friend Mr. GON-
ZALEZ for championing this legislation. 
Many times, people who observe this 
body may think it is all about political 
tit-for-tat or it is about making noise 
or directing time and energy in a fash-
ion that is less than productive. What 
Congressman 
GONZALEZ
has 
dem-
onstrated here today in the case of 
both Brycen and Ben is that we are

people, too, as Members. This tragedy 
touched Mr. GONZALEZ and compelled 
him to respond legislatively to make 
sure that other families can be spared 
what the Grays and Prices have gone 
through. It is a testament to my col-
league from Ohio (Mr. GONZALEZ) and a 
statement that we are basically good 
and decent people in this place. We just 
need to focus on the priorities that are 
important to our fellow Americans as 
Congressman GONZALEZ is doing today. 
Madam Speaker, I urge the passage 
of this legislation, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I, too, 
thank Congressman GONZALEZ for of-
fering this bill. I suspect there is nary 
a family represented in this body that 
has not been touched by a mental ill-
ness at one point or another and the 
tragedy and the suffering that that in-
volves. We have all seen what happens 
with the loss of a child. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support H.R. 7180, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. 
BEYER) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 7180. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it.

SAFE CONNECTIONS ACT OF 2022 
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Madam Speaker, I move to sus-
pend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 
7132) to preserve safe access to commu-
nications services for survivors of do-
mestic violence and other crimes, and 
for other purposes, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 7132 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Safe Connec-
tions Act of 2022’’. 
SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS. 
Except as otherwise provided in this Act, 
terms used in this Act that are defined in 
section 345(a) of the Communications Act of 
1934, as added by section 4 of this Act, have 
the meanings given those terms in such sec-
tion 345(a). 
SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Domestic violence, dating violence, 
stalking, sexual assault, human trafficking, 
and 
related 
crimes 
are 
life-threatening 
issues and have lasting and harmful effects 
on individuals, families, and entire commu-
nities. 
(2) Survivors often lack meaningful sup-
port and options when establishing independ-
ence from an abuser, including barriers such 
as financial insecurity and limited access to 
reliable communications tools to maintain 
essential connections with family, social 
safety networks, employers, and support 
services. 
(3) Perpetrators of violence and abuse de-
scribed in paragraph (1) increasingly use 
technological and communications tools to 
exercise control over, monitor, and abuse 
their victims. 
(4) Communications law can play a public 
interest role in the promotion of safety, life, 
and property with respect to the types of vi-
olence and abuse described in paragraph (1). 
For example, independent access to a wire-
less phone plan can assist survivors in estab-
lishing security and autonomy. 
(5) 
Safeguards 
within 
communications 
services can serve a role in preventing abuse 
and narrowing the digital divide experienced 
by survivors of abuse. 
SEC. 4. PROTECTION OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE 
SURVIVORS 
WITHIN 
COMMUNICA-
TIONS SERVICES. 
Part I of title III of the Communications 
Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 301 et seq.) is amended

SEC. 8. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EF-
FECTS. 
The budgetary effects of this Act, for the 
purpose of complying with the Statutory 
Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be deter-
mined by reference to the latest statement 
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in 
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE) 
and the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. 
LATTA) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Madam Speaker, I ask unani-
mous consent that all Members may 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 7132. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 
such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of H.R. 7132, the Safe Connections 
Act. A cell phone may be one of the 
most important items a survivor of do-
mestic violence, human trafficking, or 
other related crimes has when living in 
an abusive relationship. This device 
will not only allow a survivor to stay 
connected to family and friends, but it 
also provides them with access to out-
side help and support networks. 
There is no question that a cell 
phone is an important lifeline for sur-
vivors of these devastating and hor-
rible crimes. However, in some in-
stances, survivors use a cell phone with 
a shared mobile service plan. This can 
subject these survivors to ongoing dig-
ital abuse like bullying, stalking, or in-
timidation. 
H.R. 7132 addresses these unfortunate 
circumstances 
by 
requiring 
mobile 
service providers to separate the phone 
line of victims from an account shared 
with their abuser within 2 business 
days without financial penalties or 
other potential obstacles. 
b 1545 
The legislation also requires mobile 
service providers to publicly provide 
information about the availability of 
line 
separation 
requests 
on 
their 
websites, in their stores, and in other 
public-facing 
consumer 
communica-
tions. 
H.R. 7132 also directs the FCC to es-
tablish 
emergency 
communications 
support for these survivors and to ex-
plore how to keep calls and texts to 
hotlines for domestic violence, human 
trafficking, and other related crimes 
from appearing on a customer call and 
text log. 
For these reasons, I am pleased that 
we are bringing this critical legislation 
forward on a bipartisan basis. I com-
mend Representatives KUSTER, ESHOO, 
and WALBERG for their work in advanc-
ing this legislation out of the com-
mittee. 
I know that the Senate passed a com-
panion bill a few months ago, led by 
Senator SCHATZ and FISCHER. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this lifesaving legis-
lation in a bipartisan manner, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 7132, the Safe Connections 
Act, which was introduced by Rep-
resentatives KUSTER, WALBERG, and 
ESHOO. 
The Safe Connections Act will help 
streamline the process for survivors of 
domestic violence, human trafficking, 
and related crimes, as well as their de-
pendents, to leave a shared mobile 
phone contract with their abuser. 
Survivors of domestic abuse rou-
tinely experience digital abuse, stalk-
ing, and coercion through the use of a

July 26, 2022 
shared cell phone plan. This can lead to 
instability for survivors and make it 
even more difficult to escape an abu-
sive relationship. 
Abusers that share a mobile plan 
with a survivor of domestic abuse often 
monitor the location of their victim as 
well as their call and text history, 
which could provide an abuser insight 
into a victim’s support network, fam-
ily, friends, and coworkers. 
As survivors begin the process of re-
building their lives following domestic 
violence, it can be difficult to leave a 
shared mobile phone contract with 
their abuser. No Federal law requires 
mobile service providers to allow vic-
tims to leave their family plans very 
easily. While some States require vic-
tims to get a court order to leave a 
family plan, other States allow victims 
to leave family plans without a court 
order but instead compel victims to 
supply phone companies with evidence 
of their abuse. 
The Safe Connections Act would re-
quire a mobile service provider to com-
plete a line separation request within 2 
business days, provide clarity to sur-
vivors on how to submit the request, 
and permit survivors to receive con-
firmation that the request is complete 
by remote means. 
The legislation would also limit mo-
bile service providers from making the 
line separation request contingent on 
paying an early termination fee, main-
taining a contract with the provider, or 
requiring approval of separation by the 
primary account holder. 
The Safe Connections Act is a step 
forward in helping domestic violence 
survivors and their dependents leave 
abusive situations. 
Madam Speaker, it is very important 
that the House acts favorably on this 
piece of legislation because when you 
are thinking about what survivors of 
domestic violence, human trafficking, 
and related crimes go through—and 
also their dependents—it is absolutely 
essential that this piece of legislation 
be favorably acted on by the House. 
We want to make sure that an indi-
vidual can leave these plans but also 
still be able to remain connected with 
their friends and family and other indi-
viduals out there. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that the House 
support this legislation, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Madam Speaker, having no fur-
ther speakers, I also urge Members on 
both sides of the aisle to support H.R. 
7132. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of H.R. 7132, the Safe Connec-
tions Act, critical legislation I’ve co-led to help 
survivors of domestic violence regain their dig-
ital independence. 
Abusers are increasingly using everyday 
digital tools to coerce and control their victims 
and shared phone plans pose a unique dan-
ger for survivors of domestic violence. They 
enable abusers to monitor their victims? 
phone calls, texts, voicemails and even their 
precise physical locations. Phone providers 
make it extremely challenging and expensive 
to end a cell phone contract early, charging up 
to $350 to leave the plan and additional up- 
front fees. Given that 99 percent of all domes-
tic violence cases involve financial abuse, 
these fees pose an insurmountable barrier to 
leaving an abusive relationship. 
I’m proud to have introduced the Safe Con-
nections Act with colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle to ensure survivors can safely and 
remotely remove themselves from shared 
phone plans with their abusive partners with-
out prohibitive costs and contractual obliga-
tions. The legislation tasks the Federal Com-
munications Commission with facilitating ac-
cess to emergency communications support 
through the Lifeline Program or the Affordable 
Connectivity Program to empower survivors to 
obtain new phones or phone services at dis-
counted prices. The Federal Communications 
Commission is also required to ensure that 
calls or texts to domestic violence hotlines do 
not appear on call logs. These are highly im-
portant measures to ensure survivors can 
quickly cut ties with their abusers and remain 
connected to their support networks. 
I thank Reps. KUSTER and WALBERG, Chair-
man PALLONE, and Ranking Member MCMOR-
RIS ROGERS for their partnership on this legis-
lation, and I urge my colleagues to vote for it. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. 
MICHAEL F. DOYLE) that the House sus-
pend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 
7132, as amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The yeas and nays were ordered. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-
ceedings on this motion will be post-
poned.

and the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. 
LATTA) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Madam Speaker, I ask unani-
mous consent that all Members have 5 
legislative days in which to revise and 
extend their remarks and include ex-
traneous material on H.R. 7624. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 
such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of H.R. 7624, the Spectrum Innova-
tion Act. 
Our Nation’s airwaves are a critical 
component in building next-generation 
wireless networks. These networks can 
make a meaningful difference in Amer-
icans’ lives. They can expand the reach 
of telehealth services, extend edu-
cational experiences beyond the class-
room, and provide critical communica-
tions for public safety activities. But 
in order to achieve these important 
goals, we must continue to expand the 
ability of commercial users to access 
our airwaves, including by using inno-
vative spectrum management tech-
nologies. 
H.R. 7624 extends the Federal Com-
munications Commission’s auction au-
thority by 18 months from its expira-
tion date later this fall. This extension 
will allow the FCC to hold its planned 
spectrum auction in July without dis-
ruption, as well as any future actions. 
It is essential that we extend this au-
thority. After all, Congress has never 
allowed this spectrum authority to 
lapse. 
To maintain our Nation’s global lead-
ership in wireless innovation, we must 
come together to ensure the smooth 
management of spectrum, and that in-
cludes the auctions that have for years 
efficiently made these airways avail-
able. 
I am also pleased that this legisla-
tion will use auction proceeds in a 
budget-neutral manner to fund two sig-
nificant programs: the FCC’s rip and 
replace program and the transition to 
Next Generation 911 networks. Funding 
these two longstanding priorities will 
provide consumers with access to safe 
and secure networks that are able to 
meet the public safety demands of the 
21st century. 
The Federal investments in Next Gen 
911 will save lives. In an instant, each 
of us can text a photo to a family mem-
ber across the country or upload a 
video to social media for all to see. 
That same kind of instant communica-
tion should be accessible to 911 centers. 
Next Generation 911 allows people to 
call or send text images or videos to 911 
to help first responders and emergency 
personnel to better assess the nature of 
the emergency and reach people in 
need. It will help enhance emergency 
response by shaving precious minutes 
off response times and equipping first 
responders with lifesaving information 
before they reach the scene. 
In my time on the Energy and Com-
merce Committee, the Next Generation 
911 Act has passed out of the com-
mittee and the full House of Represent-
atives on multiple occasions, both as a 
standalone bill and as part of larger in-
frastructure packages. This bill marks 
the most significant progress we have 
made in this effort thus far, and I re-
main committed to working with my 
colleagues to see that it is signed into 
law. 
The Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee has traditionally worked in a 
bipartisan 
fashion 
on 
key 
tele-
communication matters. I commend 
Chairman PALLONE, Ranking Member 
MCMORRIS RODGERS, and Communica-
tions and Technology Subcommittee 
Ranking Member BOB LATTA, my good 
friend, 
as 
well 
as 
Representatives 
ESHOO, MATSUI, DAVIDS, WELCH, HUD-
SON, GUTHRIE, JOYCE, and JOHNSON for 
continuing in this tradition on this leg-
islation. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this important leg-
islation in a bipartisan manner, and I 
hope the Senate will soon follow suit. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
strong support of H.R. 7624, the Spec-
trum Innovation Act, which I am 
pleased to lead with my good friend, 
the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. 
MICHAEL F. DOYLE), the subcommittee 
chair. 
I thank Mr. DOYLE for working with 
me and my colleagues over the last 
several months to make improvements 
to the Spectrum Innovation Act and 
earn broad Republican support through 
the committee process. The legislation 
passed the Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee by a vote of 52–0, which is a tes-
tament to the bipartisan achievements 
that are included in this bill. 
The Spectrum Innovation Act pro-
vides clarity and direction to NTIA to 
repurpose spectrum currently used by 
Federal agencies for commercial use. 
By providing this certainty, we will en-
sure that this auction receives the nec-
essary oversight and certainty to re-
sult in a success for both Federal agen-
cies and the American taxpayer. 
It also includes the Extending Amer-
ica’s Spectrum Auction Leadership Act 
of 2022, which will extend the Federal 
Communications Commission’s general 
auction authority for 18 months. Cur-
rently, this authority is set to expire 
on September 30. Without action, the 
FCC will not be able to make more air-
waves available for 5G and wireless 
broadband services in rural areas. 
With the proceeds of these auctions, 
Congress is funding critical public safe-
ty and national security priorities. The 
FCC is currently facing a $3.08 billion 
shortfall in funding to rip and replace 
untrusted equipment from our commu-
nications, like Huawei and ZTE, which 
this bill would address. Recent news re-
ports further underscore the need to re-
move this equipment quickly to pro-
tect Americans from Chinese espio-
nage. 
Additionally, this legislation would 
provide up to $10 billion in future auc-
tion proceeds to upgrade our 911 infra-
structure. For nearly a decade, Con-
gress has worked to identify a path for-
ward on facilitating a coordinated, na-
tionwide transition to Next Generation 
911. Today’s legislation will bring that 
vision to life. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my col-
leagues Mr. HUDSON and Ms. ESHOO for 
their dedication to bringing the public 
safety community, 911 professionals, 
and States together on this solution. 
Finally, the Spectrum Innovation 
Act also includes the SMART Spec-
trum Act, legislation sponsored by my 
colleague from Kentucky, Mr. GUTHRIE, 
which will provide the National Tele-
communications and Information Ad-
ministration with another tool to help 
NTIA better manage the spectrum by 
Federal agencies. 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased that 
we are funding these important prior-
ities without adding more to the na-
tional deficit. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support the legislation, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Madam Speaker, I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I yield 
such time as she may consume to the 
gentlewoman from Washington (Mrs. 
RODGERS), the ranking member of the 
Energy and Commerce Committee. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 7624, the Spectrum Innovation 
Act, led by Chairman DOYLE and Re-
publican leader Latta. 
The Spectrum Innovation Act pre-
serves United States leadership in 
wireless technology and ensures Ameri-
cans stay connected. Through this leg-
islation, Congress is taking steps to 
protect national security, improve our 
public 
safety 
communications, 
and 
continue to push the administration to 
manage our Nation’s airways more ef-
fectively. 
The Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee is leading on finding bipartisan 
solutions to ensure America leads a 
new era of innovation and entrepre-
neurship. Today’s legislation is a result 
of that bipartisan work. 
The Spectrum Innovation Act ex-
tends 
the 
Federal 
Communications 
Commission’s authority to conduct 
spectrum auctions by 18 months. With-
out congressional action, the FCC’s au-
thority to issue spectrum licenses ex-
pires on September 30. 
b 1600 
With the upcoming 2.5 gigahertz auc-
tion, Congress must act now to make 
sure that spectrum can be used to pro-
vide faster mobile connectivity across

the United States. For the American 
people, it will mean faster internet, 
better connectivity, and stronger cell 
service. 
In order to fully utilize our commu-
nications network, we must make sure 
that they are secure. In 2020, Congress 
passed the Secure and Trusted Commu-
nications Network Act to ensure com-
munications networks in the United 
States were secure. This provided funds 
to carriers that contained dangerous 
equipment 
in 
their 
networks 
like 
Huawei and ZTE, so that these carriers 
could maintain service while replacing 
that communications equipment with 
secure components. 
Earlier this year, the FCC deter-
mined that they needed more money to 
secure our networks. This legislation 
addresses that shortfall. 
If we fail to act, dangerous equip-
ment from CCP-connected companies 
could remain in our communications 
networks indefinitely. This is a serious 
national security threat that must be 
addressed as quickly as possible. 
The Spectrum Innovation Act also 
includes legislation sponsored by my 
colleague from Kentucky (Mr. GUTH-
RIE) to establish an incumbent inform-
ing capability at the National Tele-
communications and Information Ad-
ministration. 
His 
legislation, 
the 
SMART Spectrum Act, will provide 
NTIA another tool to better manage 
Federal spectrum use and help us win 
the future by making more spectrum 
available for commercial use as the de-
mand and uses for wireless technology 
grows. 
Finally, the Spectrum Innovation 
Act would facilitate a nationwide tran-
sition to next generation 911. This leg-
islation will help bring 911 fully into 
the 21st century by considerably im-
proving the public’s ability to contact 
and share information with first re-
sponders during emergencies. 
It will also enable our first respond-
ers to respond to emergencies more 
safely by providing them with addi-
tional information-gathering tools to 
help strengthen their response when 
they arrive at the scene. 
I thank Mr. HUDSON and Ms. ESHOO 
for their years of hard work to put to-
gether comprehensive legislation to 
upgrade our Nation’s aging 911 infra-
structure. 
This bill advances innovation, im-
proves public safety, and strengthens 
America’s 
economic 
leadership 
all 
while remaining budget neutral and 
costing the American taxpayers noth-
ing by using the proceeds from future 
spectrum auctions to fund these impor-
tant priorities. 
I thank Chairman PALLONE, Chair-
man DOYLE, and Ranking Member 
LATTA for working with me and for all 
of us to come together on a bipartisan 
agreement. 
This legislation is currently the only 
proposal moving through Congress to 
address these challenges, and there are 
imminent consequences to our national 
and economic security if Congress fails 
to act. 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to see 
the House lead and take up the Spec-
trum Innovation Act with bipartisan 
support, and I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the balance of my time to close. 
Mr. Speaker, again, there are many 
points why it is very important that 
this piece of legislation does pass. 
Number one, the Spectrum Innova-
tion Act provides clarity and direction 
to NTIA to repurpose spectrums cur-
rently used by Federal agencies for 
commercial use. 
Second, it is going to extend the Fed-
eral 
Communications 
Commission’s 
general auction authority from 18 
months. 
Third, its replacement is so abso-
lutely important because we have to 
make 
sure 
we 
remove 
this 
untrustworthy equipment from our 
communications networks. 
Fourth, it will help provide up to $10 
billion to help upgrade our 911 systems 
that we have to make sure are up-
graded because as time goes by, it is 
absolutely essential. 
Finally, it is going to help NTIA bet-
ter manage our spectrums. 
So, Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of 
this very important legislation, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the 
balance of my time to close. 
Mr. Speaker, I have no further speak-
ers, but I would just like to reiterate 
how important H.R. 7624 is to future 
technologies and to NextGen 911. This 
is, as was said, a bill that passed out of 
our committee unanimously, 52–0. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues 
on both sides of the aisle to give it 
their support when it comes up for a 
vote, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of H.R. 7624, the Spectrum In-
novation Act, which includes an updated 
version of my legislation, the Next Generation 
9–1–1 Act. 
9–1–1 is a lifeline for Americans in their 
greatest hour of need. In an emergency, few 
things are more important than these three 
numbers when it comes to getting help. And it 
can often be the difference between life and 
death. After the horrific attacks on September 
11, 2001, I co-founded the E–911 Caucus with 
Representative John Shimkus and Senators 
Hillary Clinton and Conrad Burns to support 
first responders and the public safety commu-
nity by moving our nation’s 9–1–1 services 
into the 21st Century. Unfortunately, we have 
not reached our goal and most of the United 
States’ 9–1–1 call centers continue to use leg-
acy technology developed over 50 years ago. 
The Spectrum Innovation Act will provide $10 
billion for states and localities to adopt NG911 
technology and help modernize most of our 
call centers. 
Next Generation 9–1–1 will harness the 
power of 21st Century technology to respond 
to 21st century emergencies. It will allow our 
9–1–1 emergency communication centers to 
receive real-time location information, text 
messages, photos, and video from individuals 
at the scene of an emergency, and to share 
that information with first responders. It will 
also make our emergency communication cen-
ters more secure, resilient, interoperable, and 
reliable. 
The benefits of this technology will help 
save lives. If someone breaks into your home 
and you’re hiding from the intruder, you won’t 
need to call 9–1–1 to speak to an operator. 
You can text 9–1–1 to summon help while you 
continue to hide. You will be able to send pic-
tures or live stream video from the scene of a 
car accident or a home fire to help first re-
sponders better respond to the emergency. 
The investments made in NG911 through 
the Spectrum Innovation Act will help mod-
ernize our 9–1–1 system. I’m pleased it has 
the support of a broad coalition of law enforce-
ment and public safety organizations, including 
the Major County Sheriffs of America; the 
Major Cities Chiefs Association; the National 
Sheriffs’ Association; the International Asso-
ciation of Chiefs of Police; the International 
Association of Fire Chiefs; the Metropolitan 
Fire Chiefs Association; the National Associa-
tion of State EMS Officials; the Association of 
Public Safety Communications Officials; the 
National Association of State 911 Administra-
tors; and the National Emergency Number As-
sociation. 
I thank Rep. RICHARD HUDSON, my co-chair 
of the NG911 Caucus for working with me on 
this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to 
vote for it. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
CUELLAR). The question is on the mo-

under section 9 of the Consumer Product Safety 
Act (15 U.S.C. 2058) beginning on the date de-
scribed in paragraph (2). 
(2) DATE DESCRIBED.—The date described in 
this paragraph is the later of— 
(A) the date of the determination of the Com-
mission under subsection (d) with respect to the

the Commission determines appropriate), such 
revised voluntary standard in whole or in part 
shall be considered to be a consumer product 
safety rule promulgated under section 9 of the 
Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2058), 
in place of the prior version, unless, within 90 
days after receiving the notice, the Commission 
notifies the organization that the revised vol-
untary standard, in whole or in part, does not 
improve the safety of the consumer product cov-
ered by the standard and that the Commission is 
retaining all or part of the existing consumer 
product safety standard. 
(g) FUTURE RULEMAKING.—At any time after 
the promulgation of a final consumer product 
safety standard under subsection (a), a vol-
untary standard is treated as a consumer prod-
uct safety rule under subsection (e), or a revised 
voluntary standard becomes enforceable as a 
consumer product safety rule under subsection 
(f), the Commission may initiate a rulemaking in 
accordance with section 553 of title 5, United 
States Code, to modify the requirements of the 
standard or revised standard. Any rule promul-
gated under this subsection shall be treated as a

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-

The Chair recognizes the gentleman

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 5313. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in sup-
port of H.R. 5313, Reese’s Law. 
I want to begin by thanking Con-
sumer Protection and Commerce Sub-
committee Chair SCHAKOWSKY for her 
dedication to protecting consumers 
from dangerous products and Rep-
resentatives KELLY, ARRINGTON, and 
LIEU
for introducing this bipartisan 
legislation that will save children’s 
lives. 
Reese’s Law is named after Reese 
Hamsmith, an 18-month-old girl who 
lost her life from complications caused 
by swallowing a button battery. These 
are small, single-cell batteries that 
look like a disc or a button. Today, 
they are used to power common house-
hold 
electronics 
like 
television 
remotes, key fobs, and meat thermom-
eters. Because of their small size and 
availability around the house, button 
cell or coin batteries pose a serious

harm to children under 6 who can suf-
fer serious injuries or death if they 
swallow these batteries. 
According to Reese’s mother, Trista 
Hamsmith, Reese was a spunky, sassy, 
full-of-life little girl who at an early 
age took the attention of an entire 
room the moment she walked in. While 
Trista was in the hospital with Reese, 
she decided that she wanted to spread 
awareness about the dangers of button 
batteries. In her testimony before our 
committee, Trista said about Reese: 
‘‘Her Earthly battle may be over, but 
her true battle, her true plan, and her 
true purpose has just begun.’’ 
Reese’s Law requires the Consumer 
Product Safety Commission to estab-
lish mandatory safety standards to 
protect children from ingesting button 
cell or coin batteries. 
The CPSC’s standards should include 
requirements for button cell or coin 
battery packaging to make the bat-
teries more difficult to access. The 
packages must also include warning la-
bels to warn consumers about the dan-
gers of ingesting these products and in-
struct consumers about keeping new 
and used batteries out of the reach of 
children. 
This legislation is a testament to the 
bravery and tireless advocacy of Trista 
Hamsmith and parents everywhere who 
have lost children to accidental inges-
tion of these products. This is crucial 
legislation that will save kids’ lives, 
and that is why I call on my colleagues 
to support it today. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
b 1615 
Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, Reese’s Law will re-
quire the Consumer Product Safety 
Commission to establish safety stand-
ards to protect children from ingesting 
button cell batteries. It also includes 
an education component for consumers 
to ensure they are keeping new and 
used batteries out of the reach of chil-
dren. 
I thank Representatives ARRINGTON 
and KELLY for spearheading this effort, 
and to Trista Hamsmith for her tireless 
efforts. 
We are all inspired by Trista, who 
has been willing to share her daugh-
ter’s tragic story and channel it into 
an action that will help save lives. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues 
to support this legislation, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as she may consume to the 
gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. SCHA-
KOWSKY) who chairs our Consumer Pro-
tection and Commerce Subcommittee, 
from which this bill came. 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank all of the cosponsors of the legis-
lation. Particularly, I want to mention 
ROBIN KELLY, who is not able to be 
here today. I know she wanted to be 
able to speak to this legislation. 
But it was brought to our Consumer 
Protection 
and 
Commerce 
Sub-
committee by a really brave mom, and 
that is Trista Hamsmith, a woman who 
lost her 18-month-old daughter, Reese, 
tragically after she ingested a tiny but-
ton cell battery. 
And I am just so proud of not only 
the subcommittee, but the full com-
mittee that unanimously has passed 
this and brought it now to the floor. 
But we give a special thanks to 
Trista Hamsmith, mom of Reese. 
So, as the chairman mentioned, these 
batteries are found in many household 
devices and even toys that are used by 
children. And it is estimated that once 
every 3 minutes, a child is treated in 
an emergency room having swallowed 
one of these small batteries. 
These deaths and injuries that con-
tinue are absolutely not necessary be-
cause voluntary standards for their 
packaging and to protect children are 
just not present. 
And so, Reese’s Law would require 
that the Consumer Product Safety 
Commission draft mandatory standards 
for these button cell or coin batteries. 
And these standards will ensure that 
the batteries’ packaging would have in-
formation about what is dangerous; 
and that they would be child-resistant 
and would have warning labels on the 
packages and instructions for parents 
to protect their children. 
More times than not, I want to just 
say that in our subcommittee we learn 
from parents about the hazards that 
their children face. And I am just so 
proud that, with the help of GUS BILI-
RAKIS, the ranking member of the sub-
committee, the help of both the chair-
man and the ranking member of the 
full committee, and our full com-
mittee, we are able to address these 
hazards. 
And the fact that Trista was able to 
bring Reese’s story to us and tell it— 
you know, sometimes I think that our 
subcommittee is—you know, we have 
to pass out tissues because of the sto-
ries that we hear from these parents— 
and turn their tragedy into power and 
are able to make the difference. 
So I just want to thank my friends 
and colleagues, and I look forward to 
passing this legislation. 
Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. ARRINGTON) who has worked on 
this piece of legislation. 
Mr. 
ARRINGTON. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
Trista and Chris Hamsmith lived every 
parents’ worst nightmare when their 
18-month-old daughter, Reese, swal-
lowed a button battery from the back 
of a remote control. It went undetected 
for a couple of days before an x-ray re-
vealed that the battery was lodged in 
her esophagus. It burned a hole in her 
esophagus. 
By the time the doctors dislodged the 
battery, it had gone so long, and the 
unique nature of these batteries, it had 
done irreparable harm and, eventually, 
unfortunately, led to her death. 
But like a strong west Texas woman, 
and a mom on a mission, Trista prayer-
fully set out to make sure that other 
families would not have to experience 
this horrible tragedy. She 
started 
Reese’s Purpose, a nonprofit aimed at 
raising awareness of the dangers of 
button batteries and advocating for 
strong safety measures. 
While I am an ardent limited-govern-
ment and less-regulation guy, it was 
evident to me, and thanks to Trista’s 
diligence, quite frankly, that these 
button batteries were uniquely dan-
gerous. They would burn holes in kids’ 
stomachs or their esophagi and cause 
major complications and even death. 
And the cases where children were in-
gesting these batteries were growing 
exponentially; 8,000 in 2020. During 
COVID, we saw a 93 percent uptick in 
kids going to the emergency room hav-
ing ingested these batteries. 
I was convinced it needed appropriate 
immediate action, and I spoke to the 
Commissioner of the Consumer Prod-
ucts Safety Commission. They agreed 
it was a serious safety risk; but they 
said it would take 3 to 5 years for the 
rulemaking process. 
That is when I connected with my 
colleague, ROBIN KELLY. We introduced 
this bipartisan legislation that we af-
fectionately refer to as Reese’s Law, 
which would require the CPSC to put 
enhanced safety standards, including 
packaging, warning labels, and the 
like. 
I am glad we are voting on this. I am 
proud of Trista and her family. 
I encourage my colleagues to vote 
‘‘yes;’’ send it to the Senate, where 
they can act swiftly to do the same. 
Mr. Speaker, I am so proud to rep-
resent west Texas, the most kind-
hearted and compassionate people, and 
I am especially honored to be a small 
part of Reese’s Purpose and partner 
with such a strong, persistent, and lov-
ing mom in Trista Hamsmith, who I 
now 
call 
Trista 
‘‘the 
Hammer’’ 
Hamsmith. 
God bless America. God bless these 
children. I hope we can save some lives. 
And go west Texas. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no additional speakers. I am prepared 
to close. I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I thank all 
the Members that worked on this very 
important piece of legislation because 
this is a piece of legislation that is 
going to help save countless children’s 
lives. 
I also thank Trista for her unending 
work to make sure this legislation gets 
across the finish line. 
So, Mr. Speaker, I ask the passage of 
this legislation, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, as I 
said, this bill is a testament to the 
bravery and tireless advocacy of Trista 
Hamsmith and parents everywhere who 
have lost children to accidental inges-
tion of these products. So this is a cru-
cial bill that will save kids’ lives, and 
that is why I call on my colleagues to 
support it today. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. CARTER) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 4551. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of H.R. 4551, the RANSOMWARE Act. 
Ransomware and cyberattacks by 
foreign actors are an unfortunate re-
ality of the modern world, and the 
United States must be as prepared as 
possible to address them. 
In 2006, Congress passed the SAFE 
WEB Act to bolster the Federal Trade 
Commission’s authority to receive in-
formation from its foreign counter-
parts and take investigative action in 
response. 
FTC action is critical since the num-
ber of consumer complaints against 
foreign businesses is staggering, with 
over 255,000 complaints submitted to 
the FTC’s database between 2015 and 
2019. The estimated dollar value of 
losses from just these submitted com-
plaints is in the hundreds of millions of 
dollars. 
H.R. 4551 amends the SAFE WEB Act 
by adding important new FTC report-
ing requirements. The legislation re-
quires the FTC to provide regular re-
ports to Congress describing cross-bor-
der complaints it receives that involve 
ransomware and other cyberattacks by 
foreign individuals, companies, and 
governments with ties to specific coun-
tries. 
This bill also boosts the FTC’s role in 
protecting 
consumers 
from 
ransomware and cyberattacks by help-
ing the FTC and Congress better under-
stand these attacks and how to combat 
them. It also requires the FTC to sub-
mit any legislative recommendations

to 
advance 
our 
Nation’s 
security 
against these types of attacks. This in-
formation is crucial in our continued 
efforts to address this serious issue. 
Mr. Speaker, protecting Americans 
and 
our 
businesses 
against 
cyberattacks from malicious foreign 
actors is not a partisan issue, and that 
is why members of the Energy and 
Commerce 
Committee 
unanimously 
supported this bill, and why I strongly 
support it today. 
I thank Consumer Protection and 
Commerce 
Subcommittee 
Ranking 
Member BILIRAKIS for his tireless ef-
forts on this legislation, and I urge ev-
eryone to support this important bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of this legislation by Representative 
BILIRAKIS, the RANSOMWARE Act. 
H.R. 4551 amends the U.S. SAFE WEB 
Act, a tool the Federal Trade Commis-
sion uses to protect consumers with an 
international 
dimension, 
which 
in-
cludes increasing cooperation with for-
eign law enforcement. 
This bill quite simply requires the 
FTC to report on cross-border com-
plaints 
they 
receive 
involving 
ransomware or other cybersecurity-re-
lated incidents committed by our for-
eign adversaries, China, Russia, North 
Korea and Iran. 
I am sure we all have stories from 
our districts. For example, a researcher 
recently located a host in Georgia that 
could possibly be connected to a Rus-
sian host with exploitation tools that 
are connected to ransomware. 
With the increase in these attacks, I 
am glad to see this legislation under 
consideration today, which will help 
Congress, the Federal Trade Commis-
sion, and other law enforcement enti-
ties better understand these attacks 
and learn how to better combat them. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues 
to vote in favor, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
b 1630 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield such time as she may con-
sume to the gentlewoman from Wash-
ington (Mrs. RODGERS), a member of 
the Energy and Commerce Committee. 
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 
4551, the RANSOMWARE Act. 
Every sector of our economy can be 
targeted by bad actors seeking to ex-
ploit vulnerabilities in software and 
networks. Last year, we saw a signifi-
cant increase in ransomware attacks 
from groups operating out of and affili-
ated with foreign countries like China 
and Russia. 
This legislation builds on my SAFE 
WEB Extension Act, which was enacted 
last Congress, and amends it to include 
ransomware in its international report-
ing and cooperation. This will help pro-
tect Americans from ransomware and 
other cyberattacks from foreign actors. 
Just a few months ago, the U.S. 
learned that hackers for the Chinese 
Communist Party had breached major 
telecommunications 
companies 
and 
network service providers to steal cre-
dentials and harvest data. What the 
CCP will do with this information, no 
one knows. If their intent is ransom or 
to use it to extort Americans, this bill 
will help us better understand and 
combat these attacks. 
We will achieve this by requiring the 
FTC to report on cross-border com-
plaints involving ransomware, or other 
cybersecurity-related incidents, com-
mitted by foreign adversaries. This will 
help safeguard critical industries from 
countries like China, Russia, North 
Korea, Iran, and others that may wish 
to harm us. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking 
member of the Subcommittee on Con-
sumer Protection and Commerce (Mr. 
BILIRAKIS) for his work on H.R. 4551, 
and I urge my colleagues to vote in 
favor of this legislation. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield such time as she may con-
sume to the gentlewoman from Iowa 
(Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS). 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I thank the gentleman from Georgia 
(Mr. CARTER) for yielding me time. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
4551, the RANSOMWARE Act. This im-
portant legislation will help protect 
consumers 
and 
businesses 
from 
ransomware and cyberattacks. 
Almost every day, there are reports 
of foreign bad actors using ransomware 
to attack companies, hospital systems, 
law enforcement agencies, schools, and 
municipalities. 
Last year, the largest meat proc-
essing company in the world, JBS, 
which has a meat processing plant in 
my district, was hacked by a Russian- 
led cybercriminal organization. These 
hackers threatened to delete the com-
pany’s internal files unless a ransom 
was paid. JBS was forced to halt proc-
essing operations at over a dozen 
plants, causing the price of meat to 
rise and impacting economies across 
the globe. 
We have also seen this in our munici-
palities and schools in Iowa, prompting 
us in the State legislature to enact leg-
islation addressing ransomware at-
tacks. 
This particular legislation will help 
avoid attacks like these by focusing re-
sources to better understand the threat 
posed by attacks from our foreign ad-
versaries 
in 
China, 
Russia, 
North 
Korea, and Iran. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support 
this bill, and I urge my colleagues to 
do the same. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I just 
want to stress how important this bill 
is. We have heard from the speakers on 
the Republican side, and I certainly 
agree with everything they have said 
about the increased ransomware and 
cyberattacks by foreign actors and bad 
actors like Beijing and Russia and 
some of the others that have been men-
tioned. It is really important that we 
pass this bill to protect the United 
States. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4551. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, on that I de-
mand the yeas and nays. 
The yeas and nays were ordered. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-
ceedings on this motion will be post-
poned.

SECURING 
AND 
ENABLING 
COM-
MERCE 
USING 
REMOTE 
AND 
ELECTRONIC NOTARIZATION ACT 
OF 2022

(H.R. 3962) to authorize notaries public

standards for, electronic notarizations 
and remote notarizations that occur in 
or affect interstate commerce, to re-
quire any Federal court to recognize 
notarizations performed by a notarial 
officer of any State, to require any 
State to recognize notarizations per-
formed by a notarial officer of any 
other State when the notarization was 
performed under or relates to a public 
Act, record, or judicial proceeding of 
the notarial officer’s State or when the

AGGRIEVED 
PERSONS 
NOT 
AF-
FECTED; STATE LAWS ON THE PRAC-
TICE OF LAW NOT AFFECTED.

validate or impair the validity or recognition of 
the notarization. 
(b) RIGHTS OF AGGRIEVED PERSONS.—The va-
lidity and recognition of a notarization under

record or transaction that is the subject of a no-
tarization or from seeking other remedies based 
on State or Federal law other than this Act for 
any reason not specified in this Act, including 
on the basis—

is held to be invalid or unconstitutional, the re-
mainder of this Act and the application of the 
provisions thereof to other persons or cir-

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. CARTER) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 3962. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in sup-
port of H.R. 3962, the Securing and Ena-
bling Commerce Using Remote and 
Electronic Notarization Act of 2022. 
In the modern era, you can cash a 
check, book a flight, and lock and 
unlock your doors all from the conven-
ience of your smartphone. To get some-
thing notarized, a process of authen-
ticating documents required for wills, 
marriage certificates, mortgages, and 
other valuable assets, many States 
still require a person to physically ap-
pear before a notary public. 
During the height of the COVID–19 
pandemic, in-person notarizations were 
not only inconvenient but also posed a 
health risk. In-person notarizations 
forced far too many consumers to 
choose between potentially exposing 
themselves to COVID–19 in purchasing 
a house or updating their wills. 
To protect consumers and commerce, 
dozens of States enacted laws or took 
emergency actions to permit electronic 
and remote online notarizations. Such 
notarizations allow the consumer and 
the notary to execute notarizations 
through secure audio-visual commu-
nications. 
As our lives are returning to a new 
normal, it has become apparent that 
electronic 
and 
remote 
online 
notarizations are a valuable tool for fa-
cilitating commerce and making notar-
ial services more accessible. Such tools 
are particularly important for vulner-
able populations like the elderly, un-
derserved 
communities, 
and 
those

lacking access to reliable transpor-
tation. 
But State action alone cannot ensure 
universal access to electronic and re-
mote online notarizations that need ro-
bust security standards and consumer 
protections. This Nation lacks a uni-
versal standard for electronic and re-
mote online notarizations. 
As a result, there is no standard that 
permits nationwide use of electronic 
and remote online notarizations, cre-
ates robust security requirements, and 
ensures electronic and remote online 
notarizations are valid nationwide. 
That is why I thank Congresswoman 
DEAN
for the SECURE Notarization 
Act. This legislation will transition no-
tarization to the 21st century without 
sacrificing security, making the proc-
ess more convenient and safer for the 
American public. 
I commend Representative DEAN for 
her leadership on this bipartisan legis-
lation. She has been pressing for this 
to get out of committee and on the 
floor, and we are finally here today. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my col-
leagues to support H.R. 3962 today, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in favor of 
H.R. 3962, the Securing and Enabling 
Commerce Using Remote and Elec-
tronic Notarization Act of 2022. 
Historically, 
notarization 
has 
re-
quired a person to appear before a no-
tary public. However, during the height 
of the COVID–19 pandemic, such in-per-
son appointments were paused, causing 
States 
to 
permit 
remote 
online 
notarizations so as to ensure commerce 
would not come to a halt when so 
many other things were. 
The passage of H.R. 3962, which estab-
lishes nationwide standards and tech-
nical requirements for remote online 
notarization, showcases the benefits 
that technology can have to reduce the 
barriers on commerce in America and 
provide an easier way of life for our 
constituents. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Representatives 
Dean and Armstrong for their work on 
this legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support H.R. 3962, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as she may consume to the 
gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. 
DEAN), the sponsor of this bill. 
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chairman PALLONE for his work and 
that of his committee. I thank Rep-
resentative CARTER, and I especially 
thank Representative ARMSTRONG for 
working alongside me on the SECURE 
Notarization Act, H.R. 3962. 
The SECURE Notarization Act will 
authorize nationwide use of remote on-
line notarization, also known as RON, 
and would include key consumer pro-
tections, including multifactor authen-
tication of the signer and the use of 
tamper-evident technology. The bill 
would also ensure the certainty of 
interstate recognition of RON. 
Importantly, this bill sets a floor for 
the use of remote online notarization, 
and States will be able to regulate fur-
ther protections as they decide. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has taught 
us so much about the necessity and the 
benefits of new technologies used to 
streamline 
services 
for 
consumers 
across industries. Remote online nota-
rization has been and should continue 
to be a time-saving, convenient, and 
safe way for consumers to execute im-
portant documents. 
Notarizations are used extensively in 
real estate transactions and in other 
key areas, including affidavits, powers 
of attorney, living wills, advance direc-
tives, and more. 
Remote online notarizations allow 
the consumer, notary, and other par-
ties to a transaction to be in different 
locations using two-way audio-visual 
communication to securely notarize 
documents. This process provides as-
sured consumer access to notarization 
and affords customers options and 
flexible scheduling. 
This is key: Remote online notariza-
tion allows flexibility for people who 
are chronically ill or immobile, for par-
ents who can’t get away from work or 
are taking care of their children, for 
servicemembers abroad seeking to buy 
a home or correct wills. 
I know well the impact this bill could 
have for notary publics across the 
country. When I served as a State rep-
resentative 
in 
Pennsylvania, 
most 
members of our team were notaries, 
and our office served as a notary hub 
for the local community. I know many 
people struggled making appointments, 
often because of a lack of transpor-
tation or because they were ill and 
physically unable to move. Remote on-
line notarization would have allowed 
us to streamline our performance and 
better serve our community. 
This legislation will help streamline 
notary processes into the digital and 
electronic consumer-facing ecosystem, 
ensuring as people become more reliant 
on digital spaces, platforms, and serv-
ices, they still have access to services 
as important as our notary system. 
This bill is supported by more than 
120 of our colleagues. It passed out of 
the Energy and Commerce Committee 
by 56–0. It is supported by a coalition of 
20 industry partners. Simply stated, it 
is commonsense and convenient legis-
lation that is completely secure. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman PAL-
LONE and Ranking Member MCMORRIS 
RODGERS, as well as Representative 
CARTER, for their support of this bill, 
moving it swiftly through the Energy 
and 
Commerce 
Committee 
to 
the 
House floor. I also thank Congressmen 
PERLMUTTER
and RESCHENTHALER
for 
being strong allies and supporters of 
this bill as we work to forge a path. 
Finally, I thank the co-lead of this 
legislation, Congressman KELLY ARM-
STRONG. I see Mr. ARMSTRONG here. I 
am delighted to have worked with him. 
I thank him for all of his work and the 
work of his staff in helping us make 
this strong piece of bipartisan legisla-
tion. We took this bill on the road and 
gathered a tremendous amount of sup-
port and had fun along the way. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield such time as he may con-
sume to the gentleman from North Da-
kota (Mr. ARMSTRONG), the Republican 
sponsor of this bill. 
b 1645 
Mr. ARMSTRONG. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 
3962, the SECURE Notarization Act, is 
a bipartisan bill that would authorize 
the nationwide use of remote, online 
notarizations, which is simply an elec-
tronic notarization where the party 
and notary are in different locations. 
Society has widely adopted remote 
meetings, events, and even social ac-
tivities. Requirements for a signer to 
be physically present before a notary 
are often impractical and sometimes 
impossible, such as with military de-
ployments or travel restrictions. 
Remote online notarization increases 
the use of notarization and allows indi-
viduals to conduct crucial business, 
particularly if both parties are unable 
to be physically present with a notary. 
This bill would provide businesses 
and individuals with the ability to exe-
cute documents using two-way audio-
visual 
communication, 
while 
pro-
tecting consumers with multifactor au-
thentication and tamper-evident tech-
nology. 
The bill would not replace State laws 
governing the authorization and regu-
lation of notaries public, nor would 
this bill alter State control over the 
practice of law or commonly notarized 
legal papers, like estate documents. 
It would simply provide for the rec-
ognition of remote notarization per-
formed in interstate commerce, Fed-
eral courts, and would ensure the rec-
ognition of remote notarizations per-
formed under another State’s law. 
This is similar to the Full Faith and 
Credit 
Clause 
and 
implementation 
statutes that ensure the recognition of 
official 
activities 
or 
judicial 
pro-
ceedings in another State. 
Again, this has been said, but this 
bill has 123 cosponsors. It proceeded 
through regular order. It passed the 
Energy and Commerce Committee with 
a 56–0 vote. It also has the support of 20 
organizations like the American Land 
Title Association, which utilizes nota-
ries public on a daily basis. 
Mr. Speaker, I, too, thank the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania (Ms. DEAN), 
my friend, for working so closely with 
our office and having a lot of fun as we 
moved the notary bill forward. If you 
think having fun on a notary bill is 
easy, Mr. Speaker, you have got to 
work at it, but we have had a lot of 
fun, and I appreciate it. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no additional speakers, and I reserve 
the balance of my time.

July 26, 2022 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, in closing, I encourage my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, again, I 
urge my colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle to support this very important 
piece of bipartisan legislation. In the

and more that this type of electronic 
notarization really is the way to go. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3962, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. CARTER) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 8454. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
8454, 
the 
Medical 
Marijuana 
and 
Cannabidiol Research Expansion Act, 
legislation that would expand com-
prehensive cannabis research. 
In March, the Senate passed S. 253, 
the Cannabidiol and Marihuana Re-
search Expansion Act. In April, the 
House considered and passed H.R. 5657, 
the Medical Marijuana Research Act, 
which also passed with strong bipar-
tisan support last Congress. 
The bill before us today, H.R. 8454, 
represents 
a 
bipartisan, 
bicameral 
agreement that resolves the differences 
between both bills and brings us to a 
historic, overdue moment for Congress. 
The consumption of marijuana and 
marijuana-derived CBD for medical use 
is approved and regulated in 37 States, 
the District of Columbia, Guam, Puer-
to Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. 
This translates to tens of millions of 
Americans consuming marijuana every 
year. Yet, we still do not have a com-
prehensive body of research on the 
safety or therapeutic effects or benefits 
of marijuana products. 
Because of its status as a schedule I 
substance, research on marijuana has 
been regulated in a restrictive, time- 
consuming way, and the existing re-
search is not representative of the 
products that are currently available 
to many Americans. 
H.R. 8454 streamlines the registration 
process for conducting research on 
marijuana and manufacturing mari-
juana products for research purposes 
and drug development. The bill main-
tains the appropriate oversight and 
control by the Department of Health 
and Human Services and the Drug En-
forcement Administration and requires 
both applicants and regulators to ad-
here to clear protocols and timelines. 
The bill requires HHS and DEA to re-
spond to registration applicants in a 
timely manner and requires a regular 
assessment to confirm an adequate 
supply of marijuana, including specific

strains, for medical research. This en-
sures that the marijuana being pro-
vided 
for 
medical 
research 
appro-
priately reflects the strains and THC 
content in millions of products across 
the country. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill also clarifies 
that doctors can discuss with patients 
the potential harms and benefits of 
marijuana as a medical treatment. 
Finally, H.R. 8454 requires HHS to 
submit a report to Congress on the po-
tential therapeutic effects of mari-
juana and CBD for serious medical con-
ditions, 
effects 
on 
the 
developing 
human brain and body, and existing 
barriers to research. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Representatives 
BLUMENAUER, HARRIS, HOLMES NORTON, 
DINGELL, COHEN, GRIFFITH, LEE, and 
CASE for their leadership on this issue. 
I urge my colleagues to support the bill 
and look forward to the Senate acting 
expeditiously on our agreement to ex-
pand comprehensive cannabis research 
while protecting public health and 
safety. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in 
favor of H.R. 8454, the Medical Mari-
juana and Cannabidiol Research Expan-
sion Act. This bill is a revised version 
of H.R. 5657, Medical Marijuana Re-
search Act, which was led by Rep-
resentatives HARRIS and BLUMENAUER, 
and overwhelmingly passed the House 
in April. 
The text of H.R. 8454 that we are con-
sidering today is largely similar to 
H.R. 5657, but it is consensus language 
that was agreed to through bipartisan 
negotiations with the Senate. I am 
pleased we were able to get the lan-
guage to a good place. 
Marijuana is a schedule I controlled 
substance under the Controlled Sub-
stances Act. Research on these sub-
stances must be conducted in accord-
ance with the Controlled Substances 
Act and requires the Drug Enforcement 
Administration approve research pro-
tocol. 
If a researcher desires to make 
changes to an approved project, the re-
searcher must submit a request to do 
so, which is then reviewed and must be 
approved by both the DEA and the 
FDA. 
In addition to the extensive regu-
latory hurdles that researchers face, 
the actual supply of research-grade 
marijuana is relatively limited. The 
supply is subject to the single conven-
tion on narcotic drugs, which imposes 
certain obligations related to govern-
mental oversight of its cultivation. 
While the DEA and the National In-
stitute on Drug Abuse have taken some 
steps to increase the number of domes-
tic manufacturers of research-grade 
marijuana, more could be done in this 
space. The Medical Marijuana Research 
Expansion Act improves the Federal 
research landscape by streamlining 
both the research and manufacturing 
registration processes. 
This is critical to better understand 
the potential benefits and possible 
risks associated with marijuana use, as 
researchers must be able to study ac-
tual products that are currently used 
by consumers for both medical and rec-
reational use. These data are long over-
due, as policy decisions have far out-
paced the science. 
States that have fully legalized mari-
juana have done so in a relative infor-
mation 
vacuum 
with 
less 
under-
standing of what it is and what it does 
than virtually any nutritional supple-
ment currently on the market, and 
with far less information than they 
have on legal substances that are eas-
ily abused, such as alcohol or tobacco. 
Until we make it easier to conduct 
the research, making fully informed 
policy decisions will remain chal-
lenging. Even rescheduling the sub-
stance administratively will neces-
sitate robust data on potential medical 
use. 
Recent evaluations conducted sepa-
rately by the FDA and the National 
Academies of Sciences, Engineering, 
and Medicine have both illustrated the 
challenges of meeting the required 
standard of evidence for demonstrating 
effective medical use. Both studies con-
cluded that lack of research was a sig-
nificant factor in denying rescheduling 
petitions in the past. 
If Congress does not act, we will con-
tinue to have limited ability to study 
these products in clinical trial set-
tings. This commonsense solution will 
better our understanding of marijuana 
through legal, Federally sanctioned 
and scientifically valid research on 
this substance. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Representatives 
BLUMENAUER and HARRIS, along with 
Chairman PALLONE, for working to-
gether on this legislation, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no additional speakers, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield such time as he may con-
sume to the gentleman from Maryland 
(Mr. HARRIS), one of the leaders on this 
important subject. 
Mr. HARRIS. Mr. Speaker, the chair-
man of the committee got it right, this 
is historic. This bill is overdue, bipar-
tisan, and bicameral, as it should be. 
Today, I rise in support of H.R. 8454, 
the Medical Marijuana and Cannabidiol 
Research Expansion Act. 
Representative BLUMENAUER
and I 
have jointly cosponsored this bill for 
four Congresses. Talk about overdue. 
Although 
we 
disagree 
about 
rec-
reational marijuana—he supports it; I 
oppose it—we both concur that in re-
gard to medical marijuana, we need to 
do the rigorous research to answer the 
questions. 
As a physician, I realize that if we 
are going to have marijuana legal in 
over three dozen States for medical 
uses, we really ought to be able to do 
the research on it to see what it can 
and can’t be used for. Many claims are 
made about it—some are legitimate, 
some will be found to be illegitimate— 
but the American public deserves to 
know whether medical marijuana and 
cannabidiol work for those claims that 
are being made. 
This bill makes it easier to do the 
necessary, rigorous medical research 
just like is done for any other drug 
that has a claim of efficacy in this 
country. The American public deserves 
to know what medical marijuana is 
useful for, because for anyone with 
those conditions where it is found to be 
useful, it could be a godsend. But for 
other conditions where the claims 
won’t be found to be valid with rig-
orous research, it would be found to be 
ineffective, and that would help protect 
American patients as well. 
This would modernize our research 
methods, bringing medical marijuana 
up to the scientific standards we use 
for every other type of medication that 
is sold as a drug in this country. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this 
bill. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield such time as he may con-
sume to the gentleman from Virginia 
(Mr. GRIFFITH). 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my friend, and leader of the com-
mittee, FRANK PALLONE. 
H.R. 8454 is an important bill, and it 
is interesting to hear the conversation 
here on the floor. Mr. CARTER was talk-
ing about the history that you couldn’t 
get 
marijuana 
rescheduled 
because 
they didn’t have enough research, and 
you can’t get the research because it is 
scheduled as a schedule I drug, so we 
have been trapped in this vortex where 
we can’t get the information. 
I, too, am against recreational mari-
juana. But for medical marijuana, I 
think it has a great benefit. For years, 
we have been in this trap where you 
couldn’t do sufficient research, there-
fore you couldn’t reschedule it. It is 
crazy. We are going to fix it here 
today. 
My belief is that medical marijuana 
can be beneficial when used in a proper 
setting. Despite the increasing use of 
cannabis products around the country, 
there have been very few legitimate 
peer-reviewed studies to determine the 
effect of cannabis on the body. 
We 
know 
it 
does 
some 
good 
anecdotally for patients with juvenile 
seizures. What we don’t know is how 
much THC has to be in the cannabidiol 
to make it effective. This is what we 
need research for. 
b 1700 
This bill allows us to obtain approval 
to conduct cannabis research and ob-
tain quality product, not just one 
strain out of Mississippi, but multiple 
products, quality products, monitored 
by the Government, to make sure it is 
not being misused, to be used in this 
research.

It encourages research by improving 
and streamlining the registration proc-
ess for marijuana. It also ensures the 
availability of verified cannabis prod-
ucts necessary for legitimate research 
by allowing approved institutions of 
higher education, practitioners, and 
manufacturers to manufacture and dis-
tribute marijuana for the purpose of 
conducting research. 
As someone who has advocated for 
this legislation for years, I appreciate 
the work that has been done to get us 
here today. 
Whatever position you may have on 
marijuana use, you need to know that 
this bill will allow us to come together 
and support more scientific research so 
that we can make informed decisions 
as we move forward as legislators. 
I have to tell you, being here live as 
a legislator is also important, because 
the genesis of this bill was several con-
versations that took place on the floor 
of this House when people who disagree 
on the underlying issue would argue 
about what research showed. It finally 
became clear to Representative BLU-
MENAUER, to Representative HARRIS, to 
myself, and to others, that we had to 
have more research in order to get the 
right answers for the American people. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge everyone to sup-
port H.R. 8454. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I would encourage my colleagues to 
support this legislation, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, again, I 
think this is a great way of dealing 
with this issue overall and getting the 
Senate on board. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this important legislation, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support 
of H.R. 8454, the Medical Marijuana and 
Cannabidiol Research Expansion Act. I ad-
vanced a precursor to this bipartisan bill 
through my Health Subcommittee and I’m 
proud to support it on the Floor today. 
According to the Department of Health and 
Human Services National Survey on Drug 
Use, over 48 million Americans reported using 
cannabis in the past year. Thirty-seven states 
now allow the medicinal use of cannabis and 
19 states and the District of Columbia have le-
galized cannabis for adult use. 
But state laws and federal policy are a thou-
sand miles apart. As more states allow can-
nabis, the federal government still strictly con-
trols and prohibits it, even restricting legitimate 
medical research. 
The Medical Marijuana Research Act ad-
dresses these restrictions on research and al-
leviates a burdensome, out-of-date process for 
scientific researchers. First, it creates a new, 
less cumbersome registration process specifi-
cally for marijuana, reducing approval wait 
times and costly security measures. Second, 
this bill makes it easier for researchers to ob-
tain the cannabis they need for their studies 
through reforms in production and distribution 
regulations. 
Under this bill scientists will no longer be 
forced to wait more than a year to become 
federally-approved to conduct cannabis re-
search. They will also not be forced to use the 
cannabis grown by a government-authorized 
farm at the University of Mississippi. This can-
nabis lacks the properties and potency of 
commercially-available cannabis and leads to 
inadequate research. 
This is a commonsense bill that will update 
federal policy to advance research on can-
nabis and its compounds. I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill. 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, today I 
will vote to pass the Medical Marijuana and 
Cannabidiol Research Expansion Act. This 
legislation would remove barriers for research 
into cannabis and facilitate access to an in-
creased supply of cannabis for research pur-
poses. 
The cannabis laws in this country are bro-
ken, including our laws that govern cannabis 
research. Because cannabis is a Schedule I 
substance, researchers must jump through 
hoops and comply with onerous requirements 
just to do basic research on the medical po-
tential of the plant. 
The Medical Marijuana and Cannabidiol Re-
search Expansion Act amends the Controlled 
Substances Act to streamline the registration 
process and expands opportunity for our re-
searchers to investigate the potential and im-
pacts of cannabis. 
My partners in the House and Senate and 
I worked closely with experts in Congress and 
the Department of Health and Human Serv-
ices (HHS) to ensure this legislation will ex-
pand cannabis research, not restrict it. Specifi-
cally, the use of ‘‘practitioners’’ includes ‘‘NIH- 
funded researchers,’’ according to feedback 
from HHS. This ensures that this legislation 
will not restrict researchers already considered 
entities eligible to conduct research under the 
Controlled Substances Act. H.R. 8454 is de-
signed to streamline and broaden access to 
researching marijuana. 
Enacting this legislation will be an important 
step forward in making the federal government 
a real partner in the path forward on cannabis. 
In addition to this legislation, we must continue 
to advance banking access for cannabis busi-
nesses; prioritize expungements, clemencies, 
and resentencing for cannabis convictions; 
make robust investments in cannabis re-
search; develop accurate tests for impairment; 
ensure our veterans can access medical can-
nabis; and invest in communities targeted in 
the failed war on drugs. 
The Medical Marijuana and Cannabidiol Re-
search Expansion Act demonstrates the power 
of good faith bipartisan engagement on can-
nabis policy and the opportunity of this mo-
ment to enact laws our communities need. 
I look forward to working with Senators 
DIANNE FEINSTEIN, BRIAN SCHATZ, and CHUCK 
GRASSLEY
and my co-lead Representative 
ANDY HARRIS to enact this legislation and ex-
pand our Nation’s cannabis research capabili-
ties. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 8454, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 623. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
623, the Gabriella Miller Kids First Re-
search Act 2.0. 
We are considering this bill in the 
memory of Gabriella Miller, who was 
diagnosed with an inoperable brain 
tumor and sadly passed at the age of 10 
in 2013. 
Mr. Speaker, cancer is one of the 
leading causes of death in American 
children, but only 4 percent of the Na-
tional Cancer Institute’s budget is 
dedicated to pediatric cancer research. 
The Kids First program was first es-
tablished at the National Institutes of 
Health in 2014 after Congress passed 
the original Gabriella Miller Kids First 
Research bill. The goal of this program 
is to enhance collaborative research on 
childhood cancer and structural birth 
defects, including the development of a 
large-scale database of clinical and ge-
netic data to discover shared genetic 
pathways between the disorders. 
Since its creation, the Kids First pro-
gram has recruited over 40 pediatric 
cancer and structural birth defect co-
horts for whole genome sequencing, 
representing 20,000 pediatric patients 
and 48,000 genomes. The database de-
veloped and maintained by the Kids 
First program has become a critical 
tool for pediatric cancer researchers 
and practitioners across the country. 
Mr. Speaker, the bill before us reau-
thorizes and transfers the Kids First 
program from the NIH Common Fund 
to the Division of Program Coordina-
tion, Planning, and Strategic Initia-
tives, which will give the program 
more stability and allow for appro-
priate planning. The legislation also 
increases the funding authorization to 
$25 million annually for 5 years. 
I thank Representative WEXTON for 
her leadership on this issue and Rank-
ing Members RODGERS and GUTHRIE for 
working with us on this important bill. 
Finally, I thank Ellyn and Mark Mil-
ler for their relentless advocacy in 
honor of their daughter. The Kids First 
program may lead to the next big med-
ical breakthrough for some of the rar-
est cancers, and those breakthroughs 
simply would not be possible without 
their longtime commitment to this ef-
fort. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from Georgia (Mr. CARTER). 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise to express my support for H.R. 
623, the Gabriella Miller Kids First Re-
search Act 2.0. 
This bill, which is supported by a 
large bipartisan group of cosponsors, 
including my Energy and Commerce 
Committee 
colleagues 
BILIRAKIS, 
MULLIN, and MCKINLEY, would reau-
thorize the Gabriella Miller Kids First 
Pediatric Cancer Research Initiative at 
the National Institutes of Health. 
Cancer remains the leading cause of 
death from disease among children. Ac-
cording to the National Cancer Insti-
tute, an estimated 10,500 new cases of 
cancer will be diagnosed among chil-
dren from birth to 14 years, and over 
1,000 children are expected to die from 
the disease. 
Children are not just little adults, 
and childhood cancer is not always 
treated like adult cancers. That is why 
it remains important to continue to 
support a robust pediatric oncology 
portfolio at the National Institutes of 
Health. 
This legislation further prioritizes 
pediatric research and complements 
existing research activities of the Na-
tional Institutes of Health. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support 
this reauthorization honoring the cour-
age and life of Gabriella Miller, and I 
urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this legislation. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as she may consume to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Virginia 
(Ms. 
WEXTON), the sponsor of the bill. 
Ms. WEXTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today 
in 
strong 
support 
of 
the 
Gabriella Miller Kids First Research 
Act 2.0, transformative legislation that 
would vastly increase funding for life-
saving research of treatments and 
cures for childhood cancer and rare dis-
eases. 
This legislation would reauthorize 
the Gabriella Miller Kids First Pedi-
atric Research program, which is set to 
expire next year, for an additional 5 
years and increase funding to $25 mil-
lion annually, which is nearly double 
the current amount. I am proud that 
this bill has broad bipartisan support, 
with over 110 cosponsors. It also passed 
through committee unanimously. 
I am proud to carry this legislation 
in honor of Gabriella, who is from Vir-
ginia’s 
10th 
Congressional 
District. 
Gabriella was diagnosed with an inop-
erable brain tumor and passed away in 
2013 at age 10. 
She was a fierce fighter not only in 
her own battle with cancer but as an 
advocate on behalf of the millions of 
other children who have suffered from 
this terrible disease. In the months fol-
lowing 
her 
terminal 
diagnosis, 
Gabriella became a national force for 
change, urging Congress to ‘‘stop talk-
ing, start doing’’ and increase funding 
to discover better treatments and 
cures. 
Her heroic efforts delivered a suc-
cessful push to pass the Gabriella Mil-
ler Kids First Research Act in 2014, bi-
partisan 
legislation 
named 
in 
her 
honor. Gabriella’s family joined spon-
sor Representative Eric Cantor of Vir-
ginia and President Barack Obama in 
the Oval Office for the bill signing. 
The Kids First program has done re-
markable work these past few years, 
sequencing more than 20,000 samples 
from childhood cancer and structural 
birth defect cohorts and starting the 
Gabriella Miller Kids First Data Re-
source Center, a comprehensive data 
resource for research and patient com-
munities meant to advance discoveries. 
It has been almost 9 years since we 
lost Gabriella, and there is still a long 
fight ahead to better understand, treat, 
and ultimately cure childhood cancer. 
Tragically, cancer is the number one 
cause of disease-related death in chil-
dren aged 14 and younger. This year 
alone, it is estimated that over 10,000 
children in the U.S. under the age of 15 
will be diagnosed with cancer. Yet, de-
spite these staggering statistics, the 
tools we have to treat these diseases 
are woefully inadequate. 
Many of the treatments available 
today for kids battling cancer haven’t 
seen significant advances in decades. In 
fact, Gabriella Miller died from the 
same brain cancer that Neil Arm-
strong’s daughter died from in 1962. 
Fifty years later, she was receiving the 
same kind of treatment. That is out-
rageous. We are failing our kids, and 
we can, and we must do better. 
My bipartisan Gabriella Miller Kids 
First Research Act 2.0 nearly doubles 
funding for the Kids First program. 
With this major boost in Federal fund-
ing, we will unlock the full potential of 
Kids First and enable the hardworking 
doctors, scientists, and researchers to 
step up their work to find ways we can 
help these children suffering from can-
cer and rare diseases. 
Mr. Speaker, this is a lifesaving bill. 
For the Millers, who are here in the 
Capitol watching us advance this bill 
today, and the millions of American 
families who have had to go through 
the torment of hearing a doctor deliver 
a cancer diagnosis for their child, I 
urge all of my colleagues to heed 
Gabriella’s call to ‘‘stop talking, start 
doing’’ and pass this bipartisan bill. 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
623, the Gabriella Miller Kids First Re-
search Act 2.0. As many people know, I 
try to be fairly conservative when it 
comes to spending Federal dollars or 
authorizing Federal dollars to be spent. 
But, Mr. Speaker, if we are going to 
spend money at the Federal level on all 
kinds of things, near the top of that 
list ought to be research for cures for 
cancer. And even higher on that list 
should be research for children who

have cancer and for diseases that affect 
specifically the young people of this 
Nation. 
I don’t think that anyone is going to 
oppose this. I am sure that I will be 
proven wrong in a floor vote later. But 
for me, this one reaches the bar that 
we ought to have unanimous or near 
unanimous support on the floor, as we 
did in the Committee on Energy and 
Commerce. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, again, I 
think this is a very important bill, and 
I thank Representative WEXTON for her 
leadership on this issue. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask that Members on 
both sides of the aisle support the bill, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support 
of H.R. 623, the ‘‘Gabriella Miller Kids First 
Research Act 2.0.’’ As Chairwoman of the 
House Health Subcommittee, I’m proud to 
have advanced this bipartisan bill and I’m 
pleased to support it on the Floor today. 
Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act 2.0 
reauthorizes the Gabriella Miller Kids First Pe-
diatric Research Program and nearly doubles 
critical funding for pediatric cancer research to 
$25 million each year for the next five years. 
Pediatric cancer is the number one disease 
killer for children in the U.S., claiming roughly 
1,800 lives every year. Children with certain 
birth defects have an increased risk of pedi-
atric cancer, yet the genetic relationship be-
tween these conditions is still poorly under-
stood. 
First launched in 2014, the Gabriella Miller 
Kids First Pediatric Research Program con-
nects the dots between birth defects and child-
hood cancers, with the hope of fostering data- 
driven solutions for personalized treatments. 
This program is named in honor of Gabriella 
Miller, a fierce advocate for childhood cancer 
research who died of brain cancer at the 
young age of 10. Ellyn Miller, Gabriella’s 
mother, when testifying at my Subcommittee 
last year, said that Gabriella told her that she 
wanted elected officials to ‘‘stop talking and 
start doing.’’ 
I urge my colleagues to stop talking and 
start doing by passing this important bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.

TIMELY DELIVERY OF BANK 
SECRECY ACT REPORTS ACT 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 7734) to amend title 31, United 
States Code, to require the timely pro-
duction of reports to Congress under 
the Bank Secrecy Act, and for other 
purposes, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 7734 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Timely Delivery 
of Bank Secrecy Act Reports Act’’. 
SEC. 2. TIMELY PRODUCTION OF BANK SECRECY 
ACT REPORTS TO CONGRESS. 
Section 5319 of title 31, United States Code, is 
amended— 
(1) by striking ‘‘The Secretary of the Treas-
ury’’ and inserting the following: 
‘‘(a) IN
GENERAL.—The Secretary of the 
Treasury’’; and 
(2) by adding at the end the following: 
‘‘(b) TIMELY
PRODUCTION
OF
REPORTS
TO 
CONGRESS.— 
‘‘(1) PRODUCTION BY THE SECRETARY.—Upon 
the request of the congressional committees or 
subcommittees of appropriate jurisdiction for 
any report filed under this subchapter, the Sec-
retary of the Treasury shall deliver the re-
quested report to the committee or subcommittee 
not later than 30 days after such request is 
made. 
‘‘(2) PRODUCTION BY A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION 
PURSUANT TO A SUBPOENA.—Upon subpoena by 
the congressional committees or subcommittees 
of appropriate jurisdiction, a financial institu-
tion shall deliver a report filed under this sub-
chapter by the financial institution, and any in-
formation on which such report is based, to the 
committee or subcommittee not later than the re-
turn date specified for such report in the sub-
poena.’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. WATERS) and the gen-
tlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. WAG-
NER) each will control 20 minutes.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks on this legislation and to insert 
extraneous material thereon. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, suspicious activity re-
ports and other materials, collectively 
known as ‘‘BSA reports,’’ are held by 
Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforce-
ment Network, or FinCEN, and can be 
critical 
to 
congressional 
investiga-
tions. For example, this committee has 
requested documents related to our on-
going investigation into the flow of il-
licit funds from the former Soviet 
states into the United States. 
There is a long history of cooperation 
on 
the 
proper 
exchange 
of 
these 
records, but in response to a recent 
Treasury-initiated reversal of decades- 
long practice, I have found it necessary 
to introduce this bill, H.R. 7734. 
Unfortunately, Treasury has severely 
restricted congressional access to sus-
picious activity reports, or SARs, by 
requiring congressional staff to review 
all material in a reading room, prohib-
iting the copying of materials, and re-
stricting 
information 
collection 
to 
notetaking alone. These limitations 
are not placed upon the Federal, State, 
and local agencies that have been 
granted access to review SARs. 
Treasury has no statutory basis for 
imposing restrictions on congressional 
authority to obtain SARs. Neither leg-
islative language, statutory provision, 
nor case law prohibits government per-
sonnel or the financial institutions 
from providing these materials to Con-
gress. 
I am very concerned that these re-
strictions and similar alternatives of-
fered by Treasury will severely impede 
effective congressional oversight and 
investigations. In response to my com-
mittee’s recent request to review SARs 
related to the flow of illicit funds from 
former Soviet states into the United 
States, FinCEN has informed the com-
mittee that it is withholding thousands 
of pages of responsive documents con-
taining technical, detailed information 
about multiple transactions involving 
numerous parties. Given the restric-
tions imposed by Treasury, it is not 
possible for my staff to effectively cap-
ture and analyze needed information in 
such complex documents. It will be 
even more difficult for Members to re-
view such materials. 
Treasury’s refusal to produce the 
documents in the manner requested 
has severely obstructed the commit-
tee’s investigation of this important 
matter. To ensure that Congress can 
conduct effective oversight moving for-
ward, I have introduced this bill, and I 
am pleased to say that it passed our 
committee on a bipartisan basis. 
H.R. 7734 requires the Secretary of 
the Treasury to deliver BSA reports to 
a congressional committee or sub-
committee of appropriate jurisdiction 
within 30 days of its request for such 
documents. The bill further requires a 
financial institution to deliver BSA re-
ports by the return date specified in a 
subpoena issued by a committee or sub-
committee of appropriate jurisdiction. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill to ensure that Congress can obtain 
access to BSA reports without cum-
bersome restrictions and can do so in a 
timely manner to support its investiga-
tory work. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise in support of H.R. 7734, which 
increases transparency and restores a 
strong record of cooperation with the 
Treasury Department. 
H.R. 7734 would require prompt deliv-
ery of certain Bank Secrecy Act re-
ports to the committees of Congress 
that rely on those records for oversight 
and legislative work.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7127 
July 26, 2022 
Under Secretary Yellen, the Treasury 
Department has taken an unprece-
dented position that Congress cannot 
have access to Bank Secrecy Act re-
ports. This should concern all of us on 
both sides of the aisle. 
For the last 20 years, FinCEN has 
provided BSA reports to the appro-
priate committees of Congress without 
delay. FinCEN must understand that 
this is not a partisan matter. 
I look forward to continuing to work 
with my Democratic colleagues to pro-
mote accountability at Treasury and 
to restore Article I oversight author-
ity. 
I support this bill, and I urge my col-
leagues to support it. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
11⁄2
minutes to the gentleman from 
Tennessee (Mr. ROSE), my colleague on 
the Financial Services Committee. 
Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentlewoman for yielding time this 
evening. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to 
H.R. 7734, which would require the 
Treasury Secretary, upon the request 
of Congress, to deliver Bank Secrecy 
Act, or BSA, reports within 30 days to 
congressional staff. 
Additionally, it would create a simi-
lar requirement for financial institu-
tions to share BSA filings with Con-
gress. 
Currently, SARs, or suspicious activ-
ity reports, may be viewed by congres-
sional staff in a reading room at Treas-
ury. Due to the sensitive nature of 
these reports, congressional staff are 
prohibited from copying the materials 
and taking them away from Treasury 
or FinCEN. 
There have been several high-profile 
leaks of SARs over the past few years. 
In one instance, a FinCEN employee, 
who was later sentenced to 6 months in 
prison, leaked thousands of SARs to 
BuzzFeed News. 
This legislation would increase the 
number of individuals who have access 
to hard copies of these reports and will 
lead to more leaks, I fear, of sensitive 
information. 
Having served on a community bank 
board, I know how subjective SARs can 
be, and I fear that this information will 
put our entire system in jeopardy. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
oppose this legislation. 
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
my colleagues to support H.R. 7734, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Treasury’s refusal to give Congress 
reasonable access to SARs is severely 
impeding our ability to effectively 
make use of the materials to conduct 
investigations. 
Treasury has no statutory basis for 
imposing such restrictions and has of-
fered no rationale for changing the cur-
rent practice, which has been in place 
for over 20 years. 
H.R. 7734 clarifies the existing statu-
tory authority of Congress and ensures 
that Congress continues to obtain 
timely access to BSA reports without 
restrictions. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
WATERS) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 7734, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. CLYDE. Mr. Speaker, on that I

ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-

CDFI BOND GUARANTEE PROGRAM 
IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2022 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 7733) to amend the Community 
Development Banking and Financial 
Institutions Act of 1994 to reauthorize 
and improve the community develop-
ment financial institutions bond guar-
antee program, and for other purposes, 
as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 7733 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘CDFI Bond 
Guarantee Program Improvement Act of 2022’’. 
SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
It is the sense of Congress that the authority 
to guarantee bonds under section 114A of the 
Community Development Banking and Finan-
cial Institutions Act of 1994 (12 U.S.C. 4713a) 
(commonly referred to as the ‘‘CDFI Bond Guar-
antee Program’’) provides community develop-
ment financial institutions with a sustainable 
source of long-term capital and furthers the mis-
sion of the Community Development Financial 
Institutions Fund (established under section 
104(a) of such Act (12 U.S.C. 4703(a)) to increase 
economic opportunity and promote community 
development investments for underserved popu-
lations and distressed communities in the United 
States. 
SEC. 3. GUARANTEES FOR BONDS AND NOTES 
ISSUED FOR COMMUNITY OR ECO-
NOMIC DEVELOPMENT PURPOSES. 
Section 114A of the Community Development 
Banking and Financial Institutions Act of 1994 
(12 U.S.C. 4713a) is amended— 
(1) in subsection (c)(2), by striking ‘‘, multi-
plied by an amount equal to the outstanding 
principal balance of issued notes or bonds’’; 
(2) 
in 
subsection 
(e)(2)(B), 
by 
striking 
‘‘$100,000,000’’ and inserting ‘‘$25,000,000’’; and 
(3) in subsection (k), by striking ‘‘September 
30, 2014’’ and inserting ‘‘the date that is 4 years 
after the date of enactment of the CDFI Bond 
Guarantee Program Improvement Act of 2022’’. 
SEC. 4. REPORT ON THE CDFI BOND GUARANTEE 
PROGRAM. 
Not later than 1 year after the date of enact-
ment of this Act, and not later than 3 years 
after such date of enactment, the Secretary of 
the Treasury shall issue a report to the Com-
mittee on Financial Services of the House of 
Representatives and the Committee on Banking, 
Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate on 
the effectiveness of the CDFI bond guarantee 
program established under section 114A of the 
Community Development Banking and Finan-
cial Institutions Act of 1994 (12 U.S.C. 4713a). 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. WATERS) and the gen-
tlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. WAG-
NER) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks on this legislation and to insert 
extraneous material thereon. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 7733, the 
CDFI Bond Guarantee Program Im-
provement Act, led by Representative 
CLEAVER, who also is the chair of the 
Subcommittee on Housing, Community 
Development, and Insurance. 
The CDFI Fund’s Bond Guarantee 
Program provides CDFIs with federally 
guaranteed, long-term, low-cost capital 
to support existing and new economic 
development projects in their commu-
nities. 
Unfortunately, 
small-sized 
CDFIs 
currently have difficulty applying for 
this financing directly because the cur-
rent $100 million minimum financing 
amount is much higher than the 
amount many small CDFIs are seeking. 
As a result, some CDFIs can only ac-
cess the program by applying with 
larger CDFIs. 
This bill would lower the minimum 
threshold for a bond issuance from $100 
million to $25 million, giving smaller 
CDFIs a fairer shot at being able to ac-
cess this program. This will help ex-
pand financing and investments to sup-
port small businesses, healthcare fa-
cilities, and affordable housing. 
This bill builds upon the work I led 
last Congress to provide CDFIs with $12 
billion in equity and grant funding. In 
particular, that legislation, which has 
already distributed $1.25 billion to 
CDFIs, represented the largest public 
investment in CDFIs ever. 
Mr. 
CLEAVER’s 
bill 
complements 
those efforts by helping smaller CDFIs 
better access private dollars to further 
their efforts to serve low-income and 
underserved communities. 
While the Bond Guarantee Program’s 
authorization ended in 2014, Congress 
has extended it on a year-by-year basis 
in annual appropriations bills. This bill 
would extend the program for 4 years, 
creating longer-term certainty. The 
bill also includes studies to examine 
areas 
where 
the 
program 
can 
be 
strengthened.

July 26, 2022 
Furthermore, this bill is a House 
companion to a bipartisan bill in the 
Senate, S. 3441, introduced by Senators 
TINA SMITH and MIKE ROUNDS. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill to ensure that more CDFIs have ac-
cess to long-term financing through 
the Bond Guarantee Program so they 
continue to spur economic develop-
ment in communities across the Na-
tion. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I thank my colleague from Missouri, 
Mr. CLEAVER, for offering this bill and 
for working with Republicans on the 
Financial Services Committee to make 
it a better bill. 
H.R. 7733, as amended through bipar-
tisan negotiations, would lower the 
CDFI Fund’s Bond Guarantee Program 
minimum issuance threshold from $100 
million to $25 million. It would also re-
quire the Secretary of the Treasury to 
review the effectiveness of the CDFI 
Bond Guarantee Program and report 
its findings to Congress; and the pro-
gram would sunset after 4 years allow-
ing Congress adequate time to make 
adjustments and ensure proper stew-
ardship of taxpayer dollars. 
This increased accountability will 
allow Congress to make certain that 
the programs that we authorize match 
the needs of the communities to be 
served. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
b 1730 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Mis-
souri (Mr. CLEAVER). 
Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chairwoman WATERS
for her long-
standing support of CDFIs. 
I speak today in support of my bill, 
the CDFI Bond Guarantee Program Im-
provement Act of 2022, which would 
open up a significant source of long- 
term, low-cost capital to support CDFI 
projects in low-income urban, rural, 
and indigenous areas of the country. 
Community 
development 
financial 
institutions, CDFIs, deliver critical 
lending opportunities to low- and mod-
erate-income communities and commu-
nities of color. CDFIs are banks, credit 
unions, and other financial institutions 
that provide products and services spe-
cifically aimed at the needs of low-in-
come and marginalized communities 
and are certified by the CDFI fund, 
which is operated by the United States 
Department of the Treasury. 
CDFIs 
support 
people 
and 
businessowners in underserved commu-
nities by providing affordable capital 
to 
communities 
typically 
excluded 
from the mainstream financial system. 
According to Treasury, in 2019, 33 per-
cent of CDFI lending was in high pov-
erty areas, nearly 75 percent of lending 
was to underserved populations and 
distressed areas, and 17 percent was to 
rural areas. I think that ought to make 
all the people committed to this con-
cept of everybody participating quite 
happy. 
CDFIs in my district, including Cen-
tral Bank of Kansas City, LISC of 
Greater Kansas City, AltCap, and oth-
ers, are instrumental in the effort to 
narrow the racial wealth gap and in-
crease financial opportunities in under-
served communities. However, we know 
that the high demand for CDFI services 
far exceeds available funding. 
One tool the Federal Government has 
to support CDFIs in their mission is by 
making significant capital for eco-
nomic development available to CDFIs 
through the bond guarantee program. 
Enacted through the Small Business 
Administration, the CDFI bond guar-
antee program is administered by 
Treasury, 
which 
guarantees 
bonds 
issued by qualified issuers and injects 
new and substantial capital into our 
Nation’s most distressed communities. 
Unlike CDFI fund programs, the bond 
guarantee 
program 
does 
not 
offer 
grants or direct loans but is instead a 
Federal credit subsidy that is designed 
to be repaid and function at no cost to 
the taxpayers. 
Since inception, the bond guarantee 
program has guaranteed over $1.7 bil-
lion in bonds used to finance schools, 
not-for-profit facilities, small busi-
nesses, healthcare facilities, and com-
mercial and residential real estate, 
among others. 
My bill, H.R. 7733, endorsed by the 
CDFI Coalition, Community Reinvest-
ment Fund, Opportunity Finance Net-
work, and others, would recognize and 
reauthorize this program. 
The bill was a bipartisan effort and 
unanimously voted out of our com-
mittee. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chair-
woman 
WATERS, 
Ranking 
Member 
MCHENRY, and my colleagues for part-
nership on this legislation, and I urge 
swift passage today. 
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
my colleagues to support H.R. 7733, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
H.R. 7733 is supported by a number of 
groups, including the CDFI Coalition, 
Credit Union National Association, 
Independent Community Bankers of 
America, National Association of Fed-
erally-Insured Credit Unions, National 
Community Reinvestment Coalition, 
and Opportunity Finance Network.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7129 
July 26, 2022 
conduct annual examinations of credit 
rating agencies on eight review areas. 
Evaluating each of these eight areas is 
resource-intensive for both the OCR 
and the rating agency and is often-
times redundant when there have been 
no identified material issues. 
H.R. 4586 is a straightforward bill to 
provide the OCR with discretion con-
cerning these eight reviewable areas 
during their annual examinations. 
Dodd-Frank’s increased compliance 
requirements for nationally recognized 
statistical 
rating 
organizations, 
or 
NRSROs, put small credit rating agen-
cies at a disadvantage in the market, 
chilled 
competition 
among 
rating 
agencies, 
and 
further 
consolidated 
power in the largest rating agencies. 
Additionally, small credit rating agen-
cies were not the cause of the financial 
crisis and should not be treated as 
such. 
The marketplace needs commonsense 
reforms like this. By providing discre-
tion to the SEC’s OCR for these eight 
review areas, H.R. 4586 is right-sizing 
the SEC’s oversight of NRSROs and al-
leviating costly burdens that especially 
impact the smaller NRSROs. 
By adopting a risk-based approach, 
H.R. 4586 allows for continued over-
sight by OCR but in a more efficient 
and targeted manner. It also removes 
burdensome and unnecessary compli-
ance costs for small rating agencies to 
promote much-needed competition in 
the credit rating industry. 
Mr. Speaker, I obviously support 
H.R. 4586, and I encourage my col-
leagues to support it. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to support H.R. 4586, sponsored 
by Mrs. WAGNER, to help the Securities 
and Exchange Commission robustly 
oversee the credit rating agencies 
through more prudent annual examina-
tions. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my Members to 
vote ‘‘yes,’’ and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
WATERS) that the House suspend the

THE NATION 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 310) to posthumously award the 
Congressional Gold Medal, collectively, 
to Glen Doherty, Tyrone Woods, J. 
Christopher Stevens, and Sean Smith, 
in recognition of their contributions to 
the Nation, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 310 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. FINDINGS. 
Congress makes the following findings: 
(1) On September 11, 2012, the United 
States 
consulate, 
and 
its 
personnel 
in 
Benghazi, Libya, were attacked by militants. 
(2) Four Americans were killed in the at-
tack, including Ambassador J. Christopher 
Stevens, Sean Smith, Glen Doherty, and Ty-
rone Woods. 
(3) Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods were 
former Navy SEALs who served as security 
personnel in Libya. As the attack unfolded, 
they bravely attempted to defend American 
property and protect United States diplo-
matic personnel. In so doing, they selflessly 
sacrificed their own lives. 
(4) Glen Doherty was a Navy SEAL for 12 
years and served in Iraq and Afghanistan. He 
attained the rank of Petty Officer First 
Class and earned the Navy and Marine Corps 
Commendation Medal. After leaving the 
Navy, Glen Doherty worked with the Depart-
ment of State to protect American dip-
lomats. 
(5) Tyrone Woods served for 20 years as a 
Navy SEAL including tours in Iraq and Af-
ghanistan. In Iraq he led multiple raids and 
reconnaissance missions and earned the 
Bronze Star. After retiring from the Navy as 
a Senior Chief Petty Officer, Tyrone Woods 
worked with the Department of State to pro-
tect American diplomats. 
(6) J. Christopher Stevens served for 21 
years in the U.S. Foreign Service. He was 
serving as U.S. Ambassador to Libya and 
previously served twice in the country, as 
both Special Representative to the Libyan 
Transitional National Council and as the 
Deputy Chief of Mission. Earlier in his life, 
he also served as a Peace Corps volunteer 
teaching English in Morocco. 
(7) Sean Smith served for 6 years in the 
U.S. Air Force. He attained the rank of Staff 
Sergeant and was awarded the Air Force 
Commendation Medal. After leaving the Air 
Force, Sean Smith served for 10 years in the 
State Department on various assignments, 
which took him to places such as Baghdad, 
Brussels, Pretoria, and The Hague. 
(8) As their careers attest, all four men 
served their country honorably.

with 
Glen 
Doherty, Tyrone Woods, J. Christopher Ste-
vens, and Sean Smith.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7130 
July 26, 2022 
honors the memories of the four brave 
individuals who served our country 
bravely for 59 collective years in public 
service. 
The Congressional Gold Medal is an 
award bestowed by the United States 
Congress, and it is the highest rep-
resentation of national gratitude for 
exemplary achievements and contribu-
tions by individuals or institutions. 
The four individuals honored today, 
Glen Doherty, Tyrone Woods, J. Chris-
topher Stevens, and Sean Smith, exem-
plified what it means to live a life of 
service. Mr. Doherty, Mr. Woods, and 
Mr. SMITH were decorated servicemem-
bers, known for their bravery and dedi-
cation to protecting the American dip-
lomats with whom they served. Ambas-
sador Stevens was a lifelong public 
servant and diplomat, deeply invested 
in 
promoting 
peace 
and 
security 
throughout the world. 
b 1745 
As we come upon the 10-year anniver-
sary of their tragic deaths, we, as a Na-
tion mourn the loss of these shining ex-
amples of our shared American values. 
And to their loved ones, who carry 
their memories with them today and 
always, we offer our sincerest condo-
lences and profound gratitude with 
their tireless efforts to preserve their 
legacy. 
This bill would present the Congres-
sional Gold Medal to the four brave 
men who protected and served their 
country honorably and died in service 
of their country. I cannot think of any 
who are more deserving of this great 
honor. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support the bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
310, a bill that will posthumously 
award the Congressional Gold Medal to 
four American heroes who died in 
Benghazi on September 11, 2012. 
H.R. 310 will recognize the sacrifice 
that Ambassador J. Christopher Ste-
vens, Navy SEALs Glen Doherty and 
Tyrone Woods, and Staff Sergeant Sean 
Smith made for our country. These 
four men lived exceptionally impres-
sive lives that should be recognized and 
honored today. 
Ambassador Stevens, born in Grass 
Valley, California, joined the U.S. For-
eign Service in 1991. Over his 21-year 
career he held a number of important 
posts including section chief in Jeru-
salem, political officer in Damascus, 
and consular officer in Cairo before he 
returned to D.C. to serve as Director of 
the Office of Multilateral Nuclear and 
Security Affairs and Pearson Fellow 
with Senate Foreign Relations Com-
mittee under then-Senator Richard 
Lugar. Ambassador Stevens was a dedi-
cated public servant who traversed the 
globe to carry out the mission state-
ment of the Foreign Service: to pro-
mote peace, support prosperity, and 
protect American citizens while ad-
vancing the interests of the U.S. 
abroad. 
Petty First Class Glen Doherty, born 
in Winchester, Massachusetts, was a 
decorated Navy SEAL sniper and corps-
man. Doherty served in both Iraq and 
Afghanistan and responded to the infa-
mous USS Cole bombing in Yemen. 
Doherty left the Navy after 12 years of 
service. He went on to continue to pro-
tect U.S. interests by working as a con-
tractor for the State Department. 
Senior Chief Petty Officer Tyrone 
Woods, known by his friends and fam-
ily as ‘‘Rone,’’ was born in Portland, 
Oregon. Tyrone Woods, like Doherty, 
was a retired Navy SEAL who contin-
ued to serve after an illustrious mili-
tary career by protecting American 
diplomats. During his time as a SEAL, 
Woods was awarded the Bronze Star 
Medal with combat ‘‘V’’ for valor in 
Iraq and served multiple tours in Iraq, 
Afghanistan, the Middle East, and Cen-
tral America. 
Staff Sergeant Sean Smith was born 
in San Diego, California, and served in 
the U.S. Air Force for 6 years. During 
this time, he was awarded the Air 
Force Commendation Medal. Smith re-
tired from the Air Force and continued 
to serve as a U.S. Foreign Service offi-
cer. Smith was posthumously awarded 
the U.S. Department of State’s Thomas 
Jefferson Star for Foreign Service on 
May 3, 2013. 
Mr. Speaker, these four men served 
honorably and died in service to our 
country. H.R. 310 will honor these men 
with the recognition that they deserve. 
I thank my colleagues, especially 
Representative LYNCH
of Massachu-
setts and Representative MAST of Flor-
ida for their bipartisan work on this 
very important piece of legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I wholeheartedly sup-
port this bill, I urge my colleagues to 
support it as well, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. 
LYNCH). 
Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chairwoman WATERS for her leadership 
on this and for helping us to get this 
bill on the floor. 
As the proud sponsor of H.R. 310, I 
rise in strong support of this legisla-
tion to posthumously award the Con-
gressional Gold Medal to four heroic 
Americans killed in the September 11, 
2012, terrorist attack against the U.S. 
diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya: 
U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Ste-
vens; U.S. Navy SEAL and CIA security 
contractor, Glen Doherty; U.S. Navy 
SEAL and CIA contractor, Tyrone 
Woods; and U.S. Air Force Staff Ser-
geant, Sean Smith. 
At the outset, I would like to thank 
Chairwoman WATERS, Ranking Member 
MCHENRY, and Mrs. WAGNER of the Fi-
nancial Services Committee for their 
bipartisan work in support of H.R. 310. 
I would also like to recognize the in-
valuable contributions that were made 
by our late chairman of the Oversight 
and Reform Committee, Elijah Cum-
mings. He made contributions to the 
legislation and to our additional effort 
to secure full death benefits for the 
Doherty family of Massachusetts. 
Importantly, the advancement of this 
bill would not be possible without the 
support of all the family members as 
well as pro bono counsel from K&L 
Gates and other stakeholders whose re-
lentless advocacy on behalf of our four 
fallen heroes is reflective of their sac-
rifice on behalf of our Nation. 
In my home State of Massachusetts, 
I would like to particularly recognize 
Mrs. Barbara Doherty and Ms. Kate 
Quigley, the devoted mother and sister 
respectively 
of 
Navy 
SEAL 
Glen 
Doherty of Winchester, Massachusetts. 
I would also like to thank Amy 
Carnevale and Dennis Porter, two at-
torneys from K&L Gates, for their 
steadfast legal support and counsel to 
guide this legislation, as well as my 
dear friend, Dan Rea of WBZ News 
Radio who amplified the story about 
these four heroes and our efforts over 
the past 9 years, notably during a time 
of deep division in this country. 
I would like to recognize and thank 
the nearly 300 bipartisan Members— 
Democrat, Republican, and Independ-
ents—who have joined me to cosponsor 
this legislation and enable this consid-
eration on the House floor, including 
my lead Republican cosponsor of H.R. 
310, Representative BRIAN
MAST
of 
Florida. 
Mr. Speaker, since the American 
Revolution, 
Congress 
has 
commis-
sioned and bestowed its highest civil-
ian 
honor—the 
Congressional 
Gold 
Medal, in recognition of distinguished 
acts 
of 
bravery, 
leadership, 
and 
achievement that leave an enduring 
impact on our American history. 
As chairman of the Subcommittee on 
National Security, I firmly believe 
that there is no legacy more lasting 
and profound than the bravery and sac-
rifice of those who have stood in de-
fense of our Nation. In view of the ap-
proaching 10th anniversary of the ter-
rorist attack against the U.S. Con-
sulate, the nearby classified annex, and 
personnel in Benghazi, Libya, it is 
more than fitting that we bestow the 
Congressional Gold Medal on these four 
fallen American heroes who bravely de-
fended our compound and dedicated 
their lives to patriotic service on be-
half of the United States of America. 
For over 20 years, Ambassador J. 
Christopher Stevens served our Nation 
in the Foreign Service. From his first 
assignment as a consular and economic 
officer in Saudi Arabia to his last dip-
lomatic mission in Libya, Ambassador 
Stevens reflected a genuine commit-
ment to building bridges with our Mid-
dle Eastern and North African partners 
and advancing our most cherished 
democratic ideals. 
During their decades of service as 
elite U.S. Navy SEALs with tours of 
duty in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other 
conflict zones, Glen Doherty and Ty-
rone Woods perpetually exemplified the

Navy SEAL motto: ‘‘The Only Easy 
Day Was Yesterday.’’ Their continued 
service as overseas security personnel 
responsible for the safety of American 
diplomatic officials was maintained 
with the highest standards of military 
excellence. 
As a former ground radio mainte-
nance specialist in the U.S. Air Force 
and a State Department officer, Sean 
Smith served our Nation with honor 
and distinction throughout multiple 
deployments that included Iraq, South 
Africa, Oman, and Libya. 
Mr. Speaker, the commissioning of 
the Congressional Gold Medal in honor 
of these four exceptional Americans 
will appropriately recognize their her-
oism, bravery, and sacrifice on behalf 
of a grateful Nation. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle to support H.R. 
310. 
Again, 
I 
thank 
Chairwoman 
WATERS for her valued support. 
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
my colleagues to support H.R. 310, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers, and I yield myself the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank, again, Mr. 
LYNCH, as well as the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. MAST) for their tireless ef-
forts to ensure that these four individ-
uals receive the recognition that they 
clearly deserve. We must strive to rec-
ognize these brave and honorable mem-
bers of our country who have com-
mitted their lives to protecting it. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in supporting this important 
piece of legislation, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
WATERS) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 310, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

EXPANDING ACCESS TO CAPITAL 
FOR RURAL JOB CREATORS ACT 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 5128) to amend the Securities Ex-
change Act of 1934 to expand access to 
capital for rural-area small businesses, 
and for other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 5128 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Expanding 
Access to Capital for Rural Job Creators 
Act’’. 
SEC. 2. ACCESS TO CAPITAL FOR RURAL-AREA 
SMALL BUSINESSES. 
Section 4(j) of the Securities Exchange Act 
of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78d(j)) is amended— 
(1) in paragraph (4)(C), by inserting ‘‘rural- 
area small businesses,’’ after ‘‘women-owned 
small businesses,’’; and 
(2) in paragraph (6)(B)(iii), by inserting 
‘‘rural-area 
small 
businesses,’’ 
after 
‘‘women-owned small businesses,’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. WATERS) and the gen-
tlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. WAG-
NER) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks on this legislation. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
5128, the Expanding Access to Capital 
for Rural Job Creators Act, introduced 
by Representative AXNE. 
While small businesses in the big cit-
ies may enjoy easier access to capital 
to grow their businesses, hire and sup-
port their employees, and serve their 
communities, the businesses in rural 
America often struggle. Rural Amer-
ica’s job growth is half the rate than 
that of big cities, and rural America’s 
poverty rate is also higher than that of 
the big cities, even though it has 
dropped under President Biden’s lead-
ership and as a result of this Congress’ 
work. 
Congresswoman AXNE’s bill would re-
quire SEC’s small business advocate to 
report to Congress particular chal-
lenges that rural businesses face in ac-
cessing our capital markets. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
5128, the Expanding Access to Capital 
for Rural Job Creators Act. 
I thank Representatives AXNE and 
MOONEY for their work on H.R. 5128. In 
the Financial Services Committee, we 
continually highlight the importance 
of capital formation for entrepreneurs 
and job creators in the underbanked 
rural communities. We all know con-
stituents who have struggled to gain 
capital to begin their own small busi-
nesses. 
Small and rural counties and the 
small businesses in those areas are 
even more vulnerable during recessions 
and during economic recovery. H.R. 
5128 is an example of legislation that 
can help solve one of the biggest issues 
for a number of rural small businesses: 
access to capital. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues 
to support this legislation, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
b 1800 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers, and I am prepared to 
close. I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
my colleagues to support H.R. 5128, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
I thank Mrs. AXNE for her work on 
this important issue and for always 
working on behalf of the rural busi-
nesses and communities in her district. 
Congresswoman AXNE’s bill directs the 
SEC’s Small Business Advocate to 
similarly focus on the challenges rural 
small businesses face. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
WATERS) that the House suspend the

The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. WATERS) and the gen-
tlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. WAG-
NER) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks on this legislation and to insert 
extraneous material thereon. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I thank Representative DEAN for in-
troducing H.R. 7981, the Public and 
Federally Assisted Housing Fire Safety 
Act of 2022, in response to the dev-
astating apartment fire that occurred 
in a Philadelphia public housing unit, 
where 12 people died, including 9 chil-
dren. 
The subsequent investigation into 
this tragedy, found that the majority 
of the smoke alarms in the home were 
inoperable, as they had either been re-
moved from the walls or had no bat-
teries inside. 
With proper fire safety tools in place, 
these deaths could have been pre-
vented. A 2021 study from the National 
Fire Protection Agency found that 
nearly three out of five home fire 
deaths are caused by fires in properties 
with no smoke alarms present, or 
smoke alarms that failed to operate. 
Functional smoke alarms can reduce 
the number of home fire deaths. 
To help prevent similar tragedies 
like the one in Philadelphia from oc-
curring, H.R. 7981 would require the in-
stallation of either tamper-resistant or 
hardwired smoke alarms in federally 
assisted housing, better ensuring fami-
lies have adequate warning when a fire 
occurs. 
Additionally, this bill will help en-
sure families across America better un-
derstand and properly use fire safety 
features in their homes through a na-
tional education campaign led by HUD. 
I commend Representative DEAN for 
her work on this very important issue, 
and I urge my colleagues to support 
this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
On January 5, a fire broke out in an 
apartment building in Philadelphia, a 
terrible tragedy that took the lives of 
12 people, including 9 children. 
Even though the building was oper-
ated by the Philadelphia Housing Au-
thority, not one of the battery-powered 
smoke detectors was operational that 
morning, so residents had no warning 
as the fire grew out of control. 
While HUD already has regulations 
in place to ensure that federally as-
sisted units install functioning smoke 
detectors, after a heartbreaking event 
like this, Congress has a responsibility 
to ensure that the rules are updated to 
prevent future tragedies. 
H.R. 7981 would require Public Hous-
ing Authorities and property owners 
within 
HUD’s 
programs 
to 
install 
smoke alarms that are tamper-resist-
ant and hardwired, or use long-term, 
10-year batteries. 
Making sure that we have modern, 
up-to-date safety code devices like 
smoke alarms in all our federally as-
sisted housing units is fundamental 
when it comes to trying to protect the 
lives of our residents. 
H.R. 7981 will create safer homes for 
HUD’s residents. 
I congratulate Ms. DEAN for her tre-
mendous work on this, and I urge my 
colleagues to support this legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7134 
July 26, 2022 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Pennsylvania (Ms. DEAN). 
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chairwoman WATERS and Representa-
tive WAGNER for their support for this 
important legislation. 
I rise in support of my bill, H.R. 7981, 
the Public and Federally Assisted 
Housing Fire Safety Act. 
This bipartisan legislation, which 
passed by a unanimous voice vote out 
of the Financial Services Committee 
last month, would help protect the 
more than 10 million Americans who 
live in public or federally assisted 
housing, to protect them from the risk 
of fire, by requiring the installation of 
hardwired or tamper-resistant smoke 
alarms in federally assisted housing. 
My colleagues from Southeastern 
Pennsylvania, Representatives DWIGHT 
EVANS, 
BRENDAN
BOYLE, 
BRIAN 
FITZPATRICK, and MARY GAY SCANLON, 
have joined me in introducing this im-
portant legislation, as our community 
was devastated earlier this year by the 
horrific blaze that occurred in a public 
housing unit. 
As has been detailed, in the early 
morning hours of January 5 of this 
year, a fire broke out in a Philadelphia 
row house owned by the Philadelphia 
Housing Authority and converted into 
apartments, killing three sisters and 
nine of their children. 
My heart breaks for this beautiful 
family. They were loving mothers, as-
piring students, babies, some only 2 
and 3 years old. I want to take a mo-
ment to remember them by simply say-
ing their names. 
The eldest sister, Rosalee ‘‘Rose’’ 
McDonald, 33, was a loving mother to 
six children, all of whom perished in 
the fire. Her children: Quintien Tate- 
McDonald, 16; Destiny McDonald, 15; 
Dekwan 
‘‘Day-Day’’ 
Robinson, 
8; 
J’Kwan 
‘‘Jay-Jay’’ 
Robinson, 
5; 
Taniesha Robinson, 3; and Tiffany Rob-
inson, 2. 
The middle sister, Virginia ‘‘Jenny’’ 
Thomas, 30, was a loving mother to 
four children, three of whom perished 
in the fire. Her children: Natasha 
Wayne, 7; Shaniece Wayne, 10; and 
Janiyah Roberts, 3. 
And finally, Quinsha White, 18 years 
old, the younger sister to Rosalee and 
Virginia. She was still just a senior in 
high school when she died. 
Heartbreakingly, as the facts around 
this fire emerged, it became clear that 
these tragic deaths might have been 
possibly prevented with proper safe-
guards. 
Of the seven smoke alarms in the 
converted row home, all of which were 
the kind that requires frequent battery 
replacement, four were in drawers, one 
was on the floor without batteries, one 
was in the ceiling without batteries, 
and a final alarm, working, was located 
in the basement. 
This situation, sadly, is not unique. 
According to 2015 HUD data on the top 
25 deficiencies in public housing, miss-
ing or inoperable smoke detectors was 
the 15th prevalent deficiency, with 
7,700 deficiencies cited. 
In 2020, an ABC News investigation 
found that ‘‘more than 1 million people 
in the U.S. are living in federally fund-
ed housing complexes that inspectors 
found had fallen short on working 
smoke detectors.’’ 
It is clear to me that the status quo 
is not keeping families safe. My legis-
lation is desperately needed to raise 
the bar, to ensure that the 10 million 
Americans who live in public and feder-
ally assisted housing have the basic, 
lifesaving benefit of working, reliable 
smoke alarms. 
This bill would also authorize $2 mil-
lion for HUD to run a national edu-
cation campaign on health and safety 
requirements in public housing, includ-
ing how to properly use fire safety fea-
tures like smoke alarms, carbon mon-
oxide detectors, and self-closing doors. 
I am pleased to have the support of 
key stakeholders, including the Inter-
national Code Council, who provided 
guidance in drafting this bill, the Na-
tional Fire Protection Association, Na-
tional Association of State Fire Mar-
shals, the International Association of 
Fire Fighters. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield an 
additional 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania. 
Ms. DEAN. Also, I thank my col-
leagues from Pennsylvania, including 
Senator CASEY, who has introduced the 
identical legislation in the Senate. 
Finally, 
I 
thank 
Chairwoman 
WATERS, and her staff, for their guid-
ance and support in crafting this legis-
lation. 
I thank the whole Financial Services 
Committee for supporting this bill in 
our markup. I implore my colleagues 
to join me in supporting this important 
bill. 
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
my colleagues to support this legisla-
tion, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 7981 is a common-
sense bill that will save countless lives 
by improving the quality and reli-
ability of smoke alarms in public and 
federally assisted housing. It is no won-
der why the bill was passed out of our 
committee with bipartisan support and 
is being supported by the fire safety 
community, as well as affordable hous-
ing advocates. 
I thank Representative DEAN for this 
bill, and I, again, urge my colleagues to 
join me in supporting H.R. 7981. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
WATERS) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 7981, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. HARRIS. Mr. Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The yeas and nays were ordered. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Colorado is recognized for 
1 hour. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, for the 
purpose of debate only, I yield the cus-
tomary 30 minutes to the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. BURGESS), pending 
which I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. During consideration of 
this resolution, all time yielded is for 
the purpose of debate only. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Colorado? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, the Rules Committee 
met and reported a rule, House Resolu-
tion 1254, which provides for consider-
ation of H.R. 3771, the South Asian 
Heart Health Awareness and Research 
Act, under a structured rule. It pro-
vides 1 hour of debate, equally divided 
and controlled by the chair and the 
ranking minority member of the Com-
mittee on Energy and Commerce, mak-
ing in order one amendment, and pro-
vides one motion to recommit. 
The rule also provides for consider-
ation of H.R. 5118, the Wildfire Re-
sponse and Drought Resiliency Act, 
under a structured rule. The rule self- 
executes a manager’s amendment from 
Chairman GRIJALVA, makes in order 
three amendments, provides 1 hour of 
debate, equally divided and controlled 
by the chair and the ranking minority 
member of the Committee on Natural 
Resources, and provides one motion to 
recommit. 
The rule also provides for consider-
ation of H.R. 6929, the Susan Muffley 
Act, under a structured rule. The rule 
self-executes a manager’s amendment 
from Chairman NEAL, makes in order 
one amendment, provides 1 hour of de-
bate, equally divided and controlled by 
the chair and the ranking minority 
member of the Committee on Ways and 
Means, and provides one motion to re-
commit. 
Finally, the rule provides the major-
ity leader or his designee the ability to 
en bloc requested roll call votes on sus-
pension bills considered on July 26 
through July 29. That authority lasts 
through July 29. 
Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to have 
the opportunity to argue the rule 
today on three important bills. The 
first, as I mentioned, is H.R. 3771, 
which has been brought forward by our 
colleague 
from 
Washington 
(Ms. 
JAYAPAL). We are grateful to her for 
her leadership on this particular bill, 
the South Asian Heart Awareness and 
Research Act. 
As you may know, Mr. Speaker, 
heart disease is the leading cause of 
death in the United States. South 
Asian Americans are four times more 
likely to be at risk of developing heart 
disease than the general population. 
Congress must invest in strategies to 
reverse that deadly trend. 
This legislation establishes a grant 
program to provide for community 
groups involved in South Asian heart 
health promotion. The bill also sup-
ports health research by authorizing 
the Secretary of Health and Human 
Services to conduct research related to 
cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, 
and other heart-related diseases among 
various populations. 
Again, 
I 
thank 
Representatives 
Jayapal and Wilson for not only raising 
awareness about the risk factors for 
heart disease but also ensuring that 
those living with heart disease receive 
the care, the treatment, and the sup-
port that they need. 
The rule also provides for consider-
ation of a second bill, H.R. 6929, the 
Susan Muffley Act of 2022, brought for-
ward by our distinguished colleague 
from Michigan (Mr. KILDEE). We are 
very grateful to Mr. KILDEE for his 
leadership on this particular bill and 
the clarion call that he has offered 
year after year in fighting for relief for 
those in the manufacturing sector. 
As the Speaker may know, the eco-
nomic downturn that started in De-
cember 2007 significantly impacted the 
manufacturing sector throughout the 
United 
States, 
including 
Michigan. 
During this time, the auto industry un-
derwent a major restructuring with the 
assistance of the Obama administra-
tion through the Presidential Task 
Force on the Auto Industry. General 
Motors and Chrysler required financial 
assistance from the Federal Govern-
ment at that time. 
The Delphi Corporation, which Mr. 
KILDEE will explain in greater detail, 
formerly a wholly owned subsidiary of 
General Motors, was a major supplier 
of auto parts and components in the in-
dustry. In 2005, Delphi declared bank-
ruptcy due to a downturn in sales. Dur-
ing their reorganization, General Mo-
tors agreed to assist Delphi by assum-
ing some of the company’s pension li-
abilities. 
General Motors backed out of that 
deal in July 2009, and the pension plans 
were terminated by the U.S. Pension 
Benefit Guaranty Corporation, a gov-
ernment corporation that insures the 
pension benefits of workers in the pri-
vate sector. 
The Federal Government cut retire-
ment benefits by as much as 70 percent,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7136 
July 26, 2022 
Mr. Speaker, for more than 20,000 sala-
ried retirees. 
The Susan Muffley Act, brought for-
ward by Mr. KILDEE, will right this 
wrong. The bill is named after Susan 
Muffley, whose husband was one of the 
20,000 retirees who saw their benefits 
reduced when the plan was terminated. 
She joined the Delphi Salaried Retirees 
Association, and she became part of 
the core leadership of that group, 
which fought to restore their pension 
benefits. 
Mr. Speaker, fundamentally, this is a 
pretty simple bill. If you work hard 
and play by the rules, you should be 
able to retire with dignity in America. 
These 
hardworking 
retirees 
have 
waited too long to receive the benefits 
that they earned, but thanks to Rep-
resentatives Kildee and Turner, and 
with the support of this Chamber, they 
won’t have to wait much longer. 
The rule provides for consideration of 
one final bill, my bill, H.R. 5118, the 
Wildfire Response and Drought Resil-
iency Act. 
Catastrophic wildfires and drought, 
exacerbated by the climate crisis, are 
wreaking havoc on much of the West-
ern United States and across many re-
gions of our country, impacting mil-
lions of Americans, including in my 
State, the great State of Colorado. 
This crisis is harming ecosystems, 
impacting water supplies and food pro-
duction, and risking the well-being and 
the livelihood of countless families. 
The Wildfire Response and Drought 
Resiliency Act represents a major step 
by House Democrats to address the 
dual crises of wildfire and drought 
plaguing communities across the coun-
try, communities like those in my dis-
trict, Colorado’s Second Congressional 
District. 
The legislation makes specific stra-
tegic and targeted investments to pro-
tect communities from catastrophic 
wildfires, reduce risks of future fires, 
and help our firefighters currently 
fighting these flames. Similarly, the 
bill improves drought resiliency by in-
vesting in water projects with rapid 
timelines, modernizing data and tech-
nology, 
and 
providing 
near-term 
drought response. 
The package builds on the invest-
ments that were made as part of the bi-
partisan infrastructure law that this 
Chamber passed last year and supports 
a whole-of-government commitment to 
addressing the climate threats that are 
already impacting millions of Ameri-
cans. 
This bill is a critically important 
bill, and if I might, I will offer one 
final story to explain why. 
b 1830 
On December 30 of last year, the Mar-
shall fire swept through the city of 
Louisville, the town of Superior, and 
unincorporated areas of Boulder Coun-
ty, all incredible communities that I 
have the privilege of representing here 
in the United States Congress. That 
fire destroyed and damaged more than 
1,000 homes in a single night. It became 
the most destructive wildfire that our 
State has ever known. 
Over the last several months, I have 
heard countless concerns from Colo-
radans across our great State, includ-
ing 
in 
my 
district, 
about 
future 
wildfires, about our ability to recover, 
about our ability to build resiliency 
and tackle the drought that we are ex-
periencing. 
This bill meets those needs. It meets 
the needs of the American West, and 
that is why I am proud to support the 
bill and to present this evening on the 
rule for consideration of the same. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Mr. NEGUSE for yielding me the cus-
tomary 30 minutes, and I yield myself 
such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, today’s rule provides 
for consideration of three bills, three 
bills that are unnecessarily partisan, 
but that is where we are. 
The first bill, H.R. 5118, attempts to 
address the wildfires raging across the 
country. Calendar year 2022 is shaping 
up to be the most destructive wildfire 
year on record. To date, 5 million acres 
in the United States have been ravaged 
by forest fires. 
Concerningly, risk projections com-
piled by the United States Forest Serv-
ice have assessed that large swaths of 
the country will remain under the 
threat of wildfires for the remainder of 
this year. 
Forest fires are responsible for the 
destruction of lives and property. They 
are responsible for the degradation of 
our air and water quality and the de-
struction 
of 
vibrant 
natural 
eco-
systems and wildlife. They are also re-
sponsible for billions of dollars in dam-
ages to States and individuals. 
Perhaps the most distressing compo-
nent of the proliferation in intensity of 
forest fires is that some forest fires are 
entirely preventable. A major contrib-
utor is decades of poor forest manage-
ment that have exacerbated forest 
fires. 
Environmental activists and their al-
lies have made routine forest manage-
ment all but impossible. Their cam-
paign of legal obstruction has directly 
contributed to the current wildfire and 
forest health crisis. It is perplexing to 
see organizations that ostensibly are 
dedicated to protection of natural habi-
tats instead engaging in an obstruction 
that has made safeguarding our habi-
tats all the more difficult. 
Unfortunately, H.R. 5118 is a package 
of 48 bills from many different commit-
tees, but only 9 of these bills have re-
ceived a committee markup. For exam-
ple, this bill includes provisions related 
to the electrical grid, environmental 
justice, and the health effects of wild-
fire smoke, all things that are not im-
mediately necessary to fight wildfires. 
The United States Forest Service has 
demonstrated that there are scientific 
and environmentally sound solutions 
to mitigate the damage of forest fires. 
If we allow the United States Forest 
Service to actually do their jobs, we 
can create healthier, more resilient 
natural habitats that all Americans 
can enjoy and from which all Ameri-
cans can derive benefit. 
Second, H.R. 6929, the Susan Muffley 
Act, is a $1 billion taxpayer-paid bail-
out of privately run pension plans that 
have been absorbed by the Pension 
Benefit Guaranty Corporation after 
Delphi, a spinoff of General Motors, 
went into bankruptcy. 
The benefits guaranteed by the PBGC 
under the plan insurance termination 
program are subject to statutory maxi-
mums. When the PBGC became the 
trustee, participants in Delphi Salaried 
Pension Plan, approximately 20,000 em-
ployees, were subject to these statu-
tory benefit limitations. 
The Pension Benefit Guaranty Cor-
poration’s maximum benefit guarantee 
for that pension was terminated in 
2009, and it is $4,500 a month or $54,000 
per year for retirees who began receiv-
ing pensions at age 65. Of the 20,000 sal-
aried plan participants, 72 percent were 
not affected by the benefit guarantee 
limit. 
Prior to the 2009 bankruptcy of Gen-
eral Motors and of Delphi, General Mo-
tors made an agreement to top-up po-
tential benefit losses for certain Delphi 
unionized employees represented by 
the United Auto Workers. General Mo-
tors honored that agreement, and those 
unionized employees were not subject 
to the same benefit losses caused by 
the statutory limits. 
This bill could create a significant 
precedent in the single-employer pen-
sion system by allowing a taxpayer- 
funded increase for 1 of over 5,000 ter-
minated 
single-employer 
PBGC 
trusteed plans. It would also create an 
expectation that Congress will do the 
same with current and future termi-
nated plans. 
Here is the deal: This bill had no 
committee hearings, no markups, and 
no input from committee Republicans. 
Instead of working on appropriations, 
the majority has decided to use this 
last week in July to allow some of 
their Members to take home a win be-
fore the August recess. 
Lastly, H.R. 3771, the South Asian 
Heart Health Awareness and Research 
Act of 2022 takes an important public 
health issue and makes it partisan. The 
Energy and Commerce Committee Re-
publicans have repeatedly expressed 
concerns with the South Asian Heart 
Health Awareness and Research Act 
throughout the entire legislative proc-
ess. The bill did not receive a single 
Republican vote in committee. 
Cardiovascular disease is the number 
one killer in the United States. Repub-
licans don’t disagree with the need to 
undertake the research proposed in 
H.R. 3771. In fact, the Energy and Com-
merce Committee has a history of sup-
porting research on heart disease for 
at-risk populations, including South 
Asian 
communities. 
Unfortunately,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7137 
July 26, 2022 
this bill will not help address the bur-
den of cardiovascular health issues in 
America. 
This bill requires the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention to make 
grants promoting awareness of heart 
disease in disproportionately affected 
communities. This, in fact, is a dupli-
cative authorization that will deepen 
the CDC’s already problematic mission 
creep. 
There are 24 programs currently at 
CDC, all of which are funded in the 2023 
Labor-HHS Appropriations bills. Some 
have 
expired 
authorizations 
dating 
back to 1998. The CDC should be focus-
ing on addressing emerging diseases in-
stead of authorizing duplicative pro-
grams. 
The 
CDC 
has 
repeatedly 
dem-
onstrated that it does not have the 
bandwidth to deal with its current re-
sponsibilities. I believe this clear lack 
of mission and focus on infectious dis-
eases has significantly contributed to 
the CDC’s failure, yes, of coronavirus 
and now of monkeypox. 
Furthermore, the CDC doesn’t even 
want this authorization. When pro-
viding the required technical feedback 
on the bill, the CDC expressed concerns 
that the authorized grants are, in fact, 
duplicative. The agency also expressed 
concerns that it would not be able to 
provide the data required by the bill. 
I am uncertain what effect, if any, 
this bill will have on communities dis-
proportionately impacted by poor car-
diovascular outcomes when the par-
tisan government funding bill released 
by the House Appropriations Com-
mittee will already be providing nearly 
$4 billion to the National Heart, Lung, 
and Blood Institute. 
By creating this one-time authoriza-
tion of a million dollars to establish an 
internet clearinghouse on evidence- 
based heart research and treatment op-
tions for South Asian communities, 
this bill merely serves as an earmark. 
As Members of Congress, it is our job 
to examine government programs to 
determine whether, in fact, they are ef-
fective and producing positive out-
comes for the American people. 
The 
South 
Asian 
Heart 
Health 
Awareness and Research Act should 
not move forward. This bill is unneces-
sary, and it is never going to see the 
light of day in the Senate. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to the 
rule, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, before I 
yield to Mr. KILDEE, let me just re-
spond a bit to my distinguished col-
league from the State of Texas to say, 
first, I know he made reference to pri-
orities vis-a-vis the appropriations leg-
islation. 
I think that most Americans who are 
watching these proceedings tonight 
would agree that our work to help 
Americans stay healthy is an impor-
tant priority, that our work to increase 
firefighter pay for those brave fire-
fighters that are sacrificing so much to 
keep our communities safe, that that is 
an important priority; that righting a 
wrong that unjustly impacted tens of 
thousands of hardworking American 
families, workers in Michigan and 
Ohio, that that is an important pri-
ority. 
I will say with respect to the wildfire 
bill and the gentleman’s comments re-
garding forest management, I agree 
with regard to his praise for the Forest 
Service’s 
10-year 
national 
wildfire 
plan. That plan was funded through the 
bipartisan infrastructure bill which, 
unfortunately, so many of my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
opposed. 
But for House Democrats getting 
that bill done, the wildfire plan that 
my friend praises, would not have been 
enacted by the Forest Service. The 
good news, Mr. Speaker, is that my col-
league has another opportunity to vote 
on a bill that would authorize addi-
tional projects that he and so many of 
my colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle apparently support. 
That bill is the bill that we are de-
bating this week. That bill is the Wild-
fire Response and Drought Resiliency 
Act because it includes an authoriza-
tion for funding of additional projects 
so the Forest Service can continue 
doing the important work that it is 
doing in Colorado, Idaho, Utah, Ari-
zona, and across the Western United 
States. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
distinguished gentleman from Michi-
gan (Mr. KILDEE). 
Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. 
NEGUSE), my friend, for yielding to me 
to speak in favor of this rule, which in-
cludes consideration of legislation that 
I and others drafted, the Susan Muffley 
Act, to ensure that people who worked 
hard, played by the rules—20,000 of 
these Delphi salaried retirees, includ-
ing 5,000 in my home State of Michi-
gan—have their pensions protected. 
The Susan Muffley Act is a bipar-
tisan bill. I will address that again in a 
moment. Republicans and Democrats 
came together to pull this legislation 
together. The AARP supports it; the 
AFL–CIO supports it. These are work-
ers who lost their pension through no 
fault of their own. 
When General Motors filed for bank-
ruptcy during the recession, PBGC as-
sumed responsibility for these retirees 
and unfairly cut their benefits as a re-
sult of the discharge of that bank-
ruptcy. These retirees were treated dif-
ferently than other retirees affected by 
that bankruptcy. As a result, it upend-
ed so many lives. 
In September of 2009, the Delphi Sal-
aried Retirees Association filed suit. 
After unsuccessfully petitioning the 
Supreme Court, it became obvious and 
clear that a legislative solution was 
the only way to get this done. 
My legislation would make those re-
tirees whole again. The beneficiaries 
will receive a payment, the difference 
between what they would have received 
had their pension been protected. 
But let me just get to the point why 
this action is necessary. I will specifi-
cally address some of the concerns 
raised by my friend, Dr. BURGESS. This 
is not a precedent unless you consider 
the precedent for any other time that 
the Federal Government, whether you 
agreed with it or not—and I know 
many didn’t—inserted itself into this 
situation where GM and Delphi were 
facing bankruptcy, took control of the 
company, provided capital to the com-
pany, got their money back. 
It was the Federal Government who 
stepped in to do this. It was the Fed-
eral Government that contributed to 
the decision to treat these particular 
workers differently when it came to 
their earned pensions. So now it is the 
Federal Government’s responsibility to 
fix the mess that it created in the 
name of Susan Muffley, a woman whose 
husband worked at Delphi for 31 years 
and failed to seek medical treatment 
because they didn’t have access to 
healthcare during that period that 
they were being overlooked. 
b 1845 
Look, after working for 30 years to 
earn a pension, you ought to be able to 
be respected. The issue here, this is not 
a precedent in the sense that it is not 
just a private pension system that 
failed. It was a system that was taken 
over by the Federal Government, run 
through bankruptcy by the Federal 
Government, and decisions by the Fed-
eral Government that contributed to 
this. 
It is not a partisan piece of legisla-
tion. The gentleman says it is a par-
tisan bill. It is not. I wrote it with Mr. 
TURNER of Ohio. I see Mr. KATKO on the 
floor, a cosponsor of this legislation. 
For goodness’ sake, there are very few 
bills where I find my name on the same 
piece of legislation with Representa-
tive MO BROOKS. He is on this bill. If 
you think that is not bipartisan, I 
don’t know what is. 
This is something the Trump admin-
istration attempted to resolve, and 
now 
the 
Obama 
administration 
is 
working with us to get it done. I am 
sorry—the Biden administration. Actu-
ally, the Obama administration failed 
to get it done. Some of my friends on 
the other side have said that I might be 
reluctant to say so. No. 
Here is my view: If you broke it, you 
bought it. This was a failure that oc-
curred during the Obama administra-
tion. I am not afraid to admit that. But 
that doesn’t mean because I happen to 
be a member of that same party that I 
don’t think we ought to step up and do 
the right thing when we can to deal 
with this. The Federal Government is 
responsible for what happened to these 
workers. No two ways about it. The 
Federal Government owes it to them to 
fix it. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the pre-
vious question, Republicans will amend 
the rule to immediately consider a res-
olution expressing support for United

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7138 
July 26, 2022 
States Border Patrol agents introduced 
by Representative MICHAEL GUEST. 
President Biden’s border crisis is de-
moralizing our border agents. Charged 
with securing our southern border, 
these agents are rescuing women and 
children left to die by traffickers, they 
are confronting the drug trade, com-
bating gang violence, all while at-
tempting to perform their usual duties 
in the face of over 3 million undocu-
mented crossings. 
Instead of supporting these brave 
men and women, the Biden administra-
tion has, instead, turned them into po-
litical pawns. As we saw in the fall of 
2021, Democrats, including the Presi-
dent, the Vice President, and the Sec-
retary of the Department of Homeland 
Security, all were involved in a rush to 
judgment and publicly accused Border 
Patrol agents of criminal wrongdoing 
in Del Rio, Texas. 
Despite being cleared by the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security’s Inspector 
General and Customs and Border Pro-
tection’s Office of Professional Respon-
sibility, the administration still seeks 
to punish these agents in order to jus-
tify their initial criticism, all the 
while 
continuing 
President 
Biden’s 
open border agenda. 
It is time for the House to stand with 
the Border Patrol by denouncing these 
false claims and supporting their mis-
sion of securing the border. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent to insert the text of my amend-
ment in the RECORD, along with extra-
neous material, immediately prior to 
the vote on the previous question. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
LANGEVIN). Is there objection to the re-
quest of the gentleman from Texas? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentleman from Mis-
sissippi (Mr. GUEST) to explain his 
amendment. 
Mr. GUEST. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
oppose the previous question so that 
we may immediately consider H. Res. 
1255. 
This resolution expresses support for 
the United States Border Patrol agents 
and condemns the Biden administra-
tion 
for 
politicizing 
the 
measures 
taken 
by 
mounted 
Border 
Patrol 
agents to respond to an influx of Hai-
tian refugees in Del Rio, Texas, in Sep-
tember of last year. 
During the encounter, Border Patrol 
agents performed the job that they 
were trained to do. Afterward, photos 
were released that showed agents using 
long reins to control their horses. 
Those photos were then used by the 
Biden administration to manufacture 
an attack on law enforcement agents, a 
common political tactic that we have 
seen implemented by those on the far 
left in movements such as defund the 
police and abolish ICE. 
Before any inquiry was made into the 
events, we saw President Biden and 
those in his administration attack 
these officers to pander to the progres-
sives within their party. Before the in-
vestigation 
even 
began, 
President 
Biden made the promise to make those 
agents pay. Even after the allegations 
were debunked by CBP and the jour-
nalist 
who 
took 
the 
photographs, 
President Biden and those on the left 
who supported those false claims re-
fused to retract their statements and 
refused to apologize to the agents they 
publicly attacked. 
We were promised a swift investiga-
tion, 
but 
the 
investigation 
took 
months to complete. Once completed, 
the allegations of assault were dropped 
and replaced with punishments for 
using offensive language and other 
minor infractions. 
National 
Border 
Patrol 
Council 
President Brandon Judd summed it up 
best when he said this: ‘‘The moment 
he made those statements’’—referring 
to President Joe Biden—‘‘the moment 
he said those agents would pay, the 
moment he convicted those agents 
without any evidence, without any in-
vestigation, there could be no doubt in 
anyone’s mind that these investigators 
were going to come back with some 
sort of charges against the agents.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, I have been to the bor-
der. I have spoken to law enforcement 
agents stationed there. They all say 
the same thing. They all say that this 
administration has abandoned them. 
They feel that President Biden, Vice 
President HARRIS, and others in the 
Biden administration manufactured a 
political 
scandal 
by 
targeting 
the 
agents who are working every day to 
secure our border and protect our Na-
tion. This is the last thing these hard-
working agents deserve. 
The morale of our Border Patrol 
agents remains low due to extreme 
pressure and long hours exacerbated by 
the President’s border crisis. The last 
thing they need is for their elected offi-
cials to turn their back on them, or, in 
the case of Del Rio, publicly betray 
them. 
They need to know that their elected 
officials stand with them, stand with 
them to secure our border and to end 
this crisis that is bringing drugs into 
our country and endangering the lives 
of law enforcement agents, American 
citizens, and the immigrants them-
selves. 
That is why this legislation is so im-
portant. Congress must continue to ex-
press its support of our law enforce-
ment agents and work with them, not 
against them, to secure our border. The 
law enforcement community needs to 
know that this Congress stands with 
them. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage all my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on ordering the 
previous question so that we can send a 
simple message to the men and women 
who are working overtime to secure 
our border and secure our Nation: We 
stand with them, and we will never 
abandon them. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. KATKO). 
Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to oppose the previous question 
so we can immediately consider H. Res. 
1255 led by my good friend and col-
league MICHAEL GUEST, the vice rank-
ing member of the Committee on 
Homeland Security. 
Let’s be clear: The situation at the 
southwest 
border 
is 
absolutely 
unsustainable. Since President Biden 
took office, U.S. Customs and Border 
Protection has had more than 3 million 
encounters at the southwest border. 
That is 3 million. That is an incredibly 
unbelievable record. 
Yet, despite doing their best in im-
possible 
conditions, 
Border 
Patrol 
agents continue to be vilified by this 
President and others in the party. 
This is exemplified by the response 
from the Biden administration and 
Congressional Democrats when unsub-
stantiated claims were made against 
Border Patrol agents responding to 
tens of thousands of migrants that at-
tempted to illegally cross the border in 
Del Rio, Texas, in September of last 
year. 
Without any investigation, any op-
portunity to review evidence, or any 
semblance of due process, here is what 
was said about our brave law enforce-
ment officers as they simply tried to 
deal with the untenable situation at 
the border created by this administra-
tion. 
Let’s start with President Biden: 
It was horrible to see people treated like 
they were. Horses nearly running them over. 
And people being strapped. It’s outrageous. I 
promise you, these people will pay. 
Vice President HARRIS: 
This has invoked some of the worst mo-
ments in our history, where that kind of be-
havior has been used against the indigenous 
people of our country. It has been used 
against African Americans during times of 
slavery. 
Secretary Mayorkas: 
I was horrified by what I saw. The pictures 
I observed troubled me profoundly. One can-
not weaponize a horse to attack a child. 
That is unacceptable. 
Finally, Speaker PELOSI: 
Reports of the mistreatment of Haitian mi-
grants fleeing from violence and devastation 
from natural disasters are deeply troubling, 
including the inappropriate use of what ap-
pears to be whips by Border Patrol officers 
on horseback to intimidate migrants. 
Jumping to conclusions and casting 
dispersions against our law enforce-
ment officers without any forethought 
is unconscionable. It is a fundamental 
tenet of what I did as a Federal pros-
ecutor for 20 years, that you never 
reach a conclusion and seek to prove it. 
You let the facts take you where they 
do. They didn’t do that on this occa-
sion. They reached a conclusion and 
sought to prove it. 
After months of an extensive inves-
tigation that was promised within 
weeks, Customs and Border Protec-
tion’s own Office of Professional Re-
sponsibility published a report in July 
that concluded there is no evidence— 
none—no evidence that Border Patrol

agents struck, intentionally or other-
wise, any migrants with their reins 
from their horses. There were no whips, 
there were no reins used as whips, no 
one was struck, and absolutely no one 
was strapped, as the President alleged. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
an additional 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from New York. 
Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, after being 
cleared of any criminal wrongdoing, 
not a single top Democrat, including 
the President or anyone within his ad-
ministration, 
including 
Secretary 
Mayorkas, has acknowledged that their 
knee-jerk comments were wrong and 
unfair, and it destroyed the lives of 
those officers. 
To make matters worse, Border Pa-
trol agents are leaving in record num-
bers due to low morale, an impossible 
mission, and no support from this ad-
ministration. 
The constant vilifying of the Border 
Patrol and law enforcement has got to 
stop. This is not what agents signed up 
for. They deserve better. They deserve 
our support, and, by God, they are 
going to get it. 
Mr. 
GUEST’s 
resolution 
sets 
the 
record straight and acknowledges our 
responsibility to support law enforce-
ment. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle to defeat the pre-
vious question so we can take this 
measure up and provide these brave 
men and women who risk their lives 
every single day with the support they 
deserve. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I will yield to my distinguished col-
league from Colorado in just a mo-
ment, but before I do, I would be remiss 
if I didn’t say that I heard the com-
ment that my distinguished colleague 
from Texas made earlier with great in-
terest regarding the supposed partisan-
ship of the three bills that we are con-
sidering today under this rule. 
I think it is important for both the 
Speaker and the American people, 
those who are watching, to perhaps 
clarify what it is precisely that we are 
debating this evening and what we will 
be debating this week. 
Just as a reminder, again, a bill to 
help Americans stay healthy; a bill to 
right a wrong that was generated 
through the bankruptcy of General Mo-
tors that impacted hundreds of thou-
sands of Americans, hardworking fami-
lies in Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, 
and across our country; and addressing 
the scourge of wildfires across the 
United States, including by increasing 
the pay for our Federal wildland fire-
fighters. That is what these three bills 
that we are going to be considering 
this week and that are part of this 
structured rule are all about. 
I have to say to the gentleman from 
New York, whom I have great respect 
for, that I say thank you to him for 
supporting one of these bills, H.R. 6929, 
the bill brought forward by Mr. KILDEE. 
I was a bit surprised when the gen-
tleman from Texas said that these pro-
posals were not bipartisan, when, in 
fact, H.R. 6929 is supported by many of 
my colleagues from the other side of 
the aisle and led by Mr. TURNER of 
Ohio. 
I was just as surprised when he de-
scribed the bills in that fashion, since 
H.R. 3771 is also co-led by a Republican 
member, Mr. FITZPATRICK of Pennsyl-
vania. 
I was just as surprised when he char-
acterized our wildfire bill in that fash-
ion, given that Mr. LAMALFA and Mr. 
MOORE have two bills included within 
that omnibus package. 
b 1900 
These are bipartisan solutions in my 
view and in the view of many of my 
colleagues, and it is important that we 
proceed to debating them on the mer-
its, which is precisely why I encourage 
my colleagues to vote for the rule. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman from Colorado (Mr. PERL-
MUTTER), a distinguished member of 
the Rules Committee. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my friend from Colorado for ex-
tending me 3 minutes. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of the previous question and the rule, 
especially the section regarding the 
Wildfire Response and Drought Resil-
iency Act. 
Climate change is having a real and 
serious 
impact 
in 
Colorado 
and 
throughout the country. In 2020, Colo-
rado experienced the three largest 
wildfires in our State’s history. Last 
summer, 
smoke 
from 
West 
Coast 
wildfires settled in the Denver Basin 
and what was at first some of the most 
pristine, best air in the world became 
some of the dirtiest as a result of the 
smoke from those wildfires. Most re-
cently, as my friend said, in December 
of last year, a fire ripped through the 
northwest suburbs of Denver, between 
Denver and Boulder, destroying more 
than 1,000 homes in 6 hours. 
Over the last 20 years it has been hot-
ter and dryer in Colorado and through-
out the West than ever recorded. Un-
fortunately, there is still a lot we don’t 
know about wildfires, their behavior, 
and their long-lasting effects. The 
Wildfire Response and Drought Resil-
iency Act will improve our under-
standing of wildfires and create a more 
coordinated whole-of-government ap-
proach so we can better prepare for and 
respond to these worsening threats. 
Close to half of my State’s popu-
lation lives in or near places prone to 
wildfires, so we need to get serious 
about our approach to wildfires to pro-
tect people’s lives, their homes, and 
our natural resources. 
I am proud of four amendments I in-
troduced in the Science, Space, and 
Technology Committee, which are in-
cluded in this bill. The provisions ex-
pand research and development oppor-
tunities to better protect buildings 
from wildfire hazards, as well as pro-
mote energy efficiency and environ-
mental sustainability. 
Further, the provisions will assist 
collaboration among the National Oce-
anic and Atmospheric Administration, 
NASA, and other agencies in their 
work in fire prevention and fire weath-
er forecasting. The provisions allow 
NOAA and NASA to purchase commer-
cial data products from satellites and 
airborne data sources to support their 
efforts to improve our understanding of 
wildfires. 
Finally, the provisions will expand 
the Department of Energy’s activities 
under the Wildland Fire Risk Reduc-
tion Program to include fire modeling, 
forecasting, fire spread, and the anal-
ysis of wildfire fuels. 
I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on the previous 
question and the rule. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded not to traffic the 
well. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, we just 
heard a lot about wanting to right 
wrongs. Well, here is an opportunity to 
right a wrong. You can vote ‘‘no’’ on 
the previous question and allow this 
wrong to be corrected. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 31⁄2 minutes to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Texas 
(Mr. 
PFLUGER). 
Mr. PFLUGER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the ranking member for yielding. 
I rise today to oppose the previous 
question so we can immediately con-
sider H.R. 1255 and bring forward my 
good friend Mr. GUEST’s resolution that 
will support the brave men and women 
in the U.S. Border Patrol. 
I think it is the right time to be talk-
ing about fires, the right time to be 
talking about not only fires in the lit-
eral sense of the fires that have af-
fected my district, but, also, fires in 
the figurative sense that I believe our 
President has led us into, especially 
when it comes to the fires that are 
going on at our border. 
In the figurative sense, if you were 
there last year as I was under the 
bridge in Del Rio—and I wish that 
more of my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle would actually join us 
to see those ‘‘fires’’ that are going on 
every single day with the thousands, 
the hundreds of thousands of people 
that are crossing illegally. 
The administration’s policies have 
been a complete failure at every single 
turn: the illicit drugs that are flowing 
into our country; the over 100,000 peo-
ple who have died needlessly as a result 
of fentanyl; the known and suspected 
terrorists that have gotten into our 
country. I believe the number that has 
been published by the administration is 
at 56, though it only took a handful to 
orchestrate the events of 9/11. 
I spent the day talking to the Na-
tional Narcotics Officers Association. 
These officers from every walk of life, 
every corner of this country, and every 
demographic 
are 
completely 
aban-
doned. They feel abandoned by the 
Commander in Chief. If you want to

July 26, 2022 
talk about a fire, let’s talk about that 
fire. They feel abandoned while they 
are trying to do their job. While the 
powers that be are pursuing the wrong- 
headed policies, these brave men and 
women not only of the Border Patrol, 
ICE, and other CBP officers, but, also, 
in every law enforcement category are 
trying to restore law and order to our 
country while we have the other side of 
the aisle in favor of lawlessness and 
chaos. That is a fire that is worth talk-
ing about. 
It was shocking when we heard Presi-
dent Biden before an investigation was 
convened, before we knew the facts 
say: ‘‘I promise you, those people will 
pay,’’ referring to the Border Patrol 
agents who were doing their job to put 
out the figurative fires on the southern 
border. ‘‘I promise you, those people 
will pay.’’ Can you imagine if President 
Trump had said that? The outcry that 
would have happened, the outrage. 
I urge my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle to right this wrong 
against those Border Patrol agents, 
their reputations, and their families. 
Their livelihoods and their careers 
need to be righted. They have been 
completely exonerated, but where are 
my friends on the other side of the 
aisle? What a shame to have that plat-
form and to use that platform to deni-
grate these people who are putting 
their lives on the line to secure our 
country. They deserve better. 
While others on the other side of the 
aisle may be laughing right now at this 
discussion, I don’t think it is funny, 
and the people that are securing our 
country, those Border Patrol agents, 
certainly don’t think it is funny. 
The American people deserve better. 
The Border Patrol agents deserve bet-
ter. Our law enforcement agents de-
serve better. 
I urge my colleagues to oppose the 
previous question and to support our 
law enforcement and Border Patrol. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I am pre-
pared to close, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, in closing, I oppose the 
bills in this rule because they were 
crafted outside of regular order with-
out significant Republican input. 
I had hoped we could produce legisla-
tion that would mitigate and contain 
the scourge of forest fires that con-
tinue to plague our Nation. This bill 
does not provide for responsible forest 
management, those forest management 
solutions that have been demonstrated 
to be effective. For that reason, I op-
pose H.R. 5118. 
Additionally, Congress should not be 
authorizing taxpayer dollars to bail 
out privately run pension plans above 
the statutory maximum. It is unfortu-
nate that Delphi overpromised and 
under-delivered for its employees, but 
allowing a taxpayer-funded increase for 
a terminated, single-employer pension 
would set a significant precedent for 
the over 5,000 similar pensions man-
aged by the Pension Benefit Guaranty 
Corporation. 
Then 
finally, 
addressing 
cardio-
vascular disease is a nonpartisan public 
health issue, however, Congress should 
be conducting of oversight of the Cen-
ters for Disease Control, not author-
izing another duplicative program. Our 
goal should be to reduce the duplica-
tion and be more intentional with the 
funding in order to achieve positive 
outcomes. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on 
the previous question, a ‘‘no’’ on the 
rule, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, today’s rule is a testa-
ment to the hard work of so many of 
my colleagues and the House Demo-
cratic Caucus. 
These underlying bills will make our 
communities 
more 
resilient. 
They 
count for the impacts of climate 
change, invest in our Nation’s public 
health infrastructure, and fix a dec-
ades-old mistake by restoring termi-
nated pensions for hardworking Ameri-
cans across our country. 
Contrary to what my Republican col-
league would have you believe about 
these bills, two of these bills are bipar-
tisan. They are co-led by Republican 
Members of the House. 
The other bill incorporates multiple 
bills and legislative proposals that 
have been introduced by Republican 
Members of the House. 
Mr. Speaker, Americans are worth 
investing in. Our families, our stu-
dents, our firefighters, our manufactur-
ers, our communities are worth invest-
ing in. 
I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this rule. 
The text of the material previously 
referred to by Mr. BURGESS is as fol-
lows: 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 1254 
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 6. Immediately upon adoption of this 
resolution, the House shall proceed to the 
consideration in the House of the resolution 
(H. Res. 1255) expressing continued support 
for all U.S. Border Patrol agents who carry 
out the important mission of securing our 
borders. The resolution shall be considered 
as read. The previous question shall be con-
sidered as ordered on the resolution and pre-
amble to adoption without intervening mo-
tion or demand for division of the question 
except one hour of debate equally divided 
and controlled by the chair and ranking mi-
nority member of the Committee on Home-
land Security. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall 
not apply to the consideration of House Res-
olution 1255.

question is on ordering the previous 
question. 
The question was taken; and the

HARRIET TUBMAN BICENTENNIAL 
COMMEMORATIVE COIN ACT 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 1842) to require the Secretary 
of the Treasury to mint commemora-
tive coins in recognition of the Bicen-
tennial of Harriet Tubman’s birth. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1842 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Harriet Tub-
man 
Bicentennial 
Commemorative 
Coin 
Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) 
Harriet 
Tubman 
was 
a 
formerly 
enslaved abolitionist who guided about 70 
people from slavery to freedom in 10 years. 
(2) Born in March 1822, Tubman was a nota-
ble abolitionist who not only freed herself, 
but also freed others from slavery. 
(3) Harriet Ross Tubman, born Araminta 
‘‘Minty’’ Ross, was born enslaved on the 
plantation of Anthony Thompson in Dor-
chester County, Maryland. 
(4) With the help of the Underground Rail-
road network, in the fall of 1849, Tubman es-
caped from Poplar Neck in Caroline County, 
Maryland, heading north to freedom in Penn-
sylvania. 
(5) With the passing of the Fugitive Slave 
Act as part of the Compromise of 1850, the 
operations to help enslaved persons escape 
became dangerous and she risked her life to 
rescue them from slavery. 
(6) Despite passage of the Compromise of 
1850 and the Fugitive Slave Act, Tubman 
continued her work, escorting her refugees 
to Canada instead. 
(7) It was during the 1850s that Tubman 
made 13 trips back to Maryland, guiding ap-
proximately 70 enslaved persons to the 
North, including family members, and pro-
viding instruction to about 70 more who 
found their way to freedom on their own. 
(8) Regardless of the arduous process of 
helping fugitive enslaved persons escape 
through the Underground Railroad, not a 
single person was recaptured under Tub-
man’s supervision. 
(9) During 1859, Tubman aided abolitionist 
John Brown by recruiting supporters for his 
raid on Harper’s Ferry, a planned insurrec-
tion against slaveholders in Virginia and 
Maryland. 
(10) In the beginning of the Civil War, Tub-
man served as a spy, cook, and nurse in 
South Carolina and Florida. 
(11) Tubman also recruited newly freed Af-
rican-American men to join regiments of Af-
rican-American soldiers called United States 
Colored Troops. 
(12) In recognition of her abilities, Tubman 
served as an army scout and spy for Major 
General David Hunter and Colonel James 
Montgomery. Harriet Tubman was inducted 
into the Military Intelligence Corps Hall of 
Fame. 
(13) Tubman distinguished herself as the 
first woman to lead an armed expedition in 
the Civil War, the Combahee River Raid, re-
sulting in more than 700 enslaved persons in 
South Carolina being freed. 
(14) After the Civil War, Tubman fre-
quently 
sheltered 
and 
fed 
newly 
freed 
enslaved persons at her home on South 
Street in Auburn, New York, which she pur-
chased from Secretary of State William 
Henry Seward, even though she had little 
money herself. She found a means to an end 
by working as a domestic, selling produce 
from her garden, taking in donations of food, 
loans from friends, and raising pigs on her 
farm. 
(15) Tubman became active in the women’s 
movement as early as 1860. She attended 
meetings and gave speeches in her home 
State of New York, as well as in Boston and 
Washington, D.C. 
(16) Tubman was an avid advocate for Afri-
can-American women and their civil rights. 
In 1896, she was invited as a speaker at the 
first meeting of the National Association of 
Colored Women in Washington, D.C. 
(17) Although living in financial insecurity, 
Tubman transferred a 25-acre parcel of land 
to the African Methodist Episcopal Zion 
Church in 1903, which eventually became The 
Harriet Tubman Home for the Aged and Indi-
gent Negroes. At the time, few social serv-
ices existed for elderly and ill people of 
color. 
(18) Escaping slavery, risking everything 
to save her family and friends, aiding 
enslaved persons in escape from slavery, 
leading a military raid, championing the 
cause of women’s suffrage, advocating for 
civil rights and access to health care, Har-
riet Tubman is an individual that has per-
formed achievements that have had profound 
impacts on history and culture in the United 
States.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7148 
July 26, 2022 
under section 5112(m)(1) of title 31, United 
States Code. The Secretary of the Treasury 
may issue guidance to carry out this sub-
section. 
SEC. 8. FINANCIAL ASSURANCES. 
The Secretary shall take such actions as 
may be necessary to ensure that— 
(1) minting and issuing coins under this 
Act will not result in any net cost to the 
United States Government; and 
(2) no funds, including applicable sur-
charges, are disbursed to any recipient des-
ignated in section 7 until the total cost of 
designing and issuing all of the coins author-
ized by this Act (including labor, materials, 
dies, use of machinery, winning design com-
pensation, overhead expenses, marketing, 
and shipping) is recovered by the United 
States Treasury, consistent with sections 
5112(m) and 5134(f) of title 31, United States 
Code. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. WATERS) and the gen-
tleman from Arkansas (Mr. HILL) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks on this legislation and to insert 
extraneous material thereon. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, today I rise in 
strong support of H.R. 1842, the Harriet 
Tubman Bicentennial Commemorative 
Coin Act. 
I thank the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. MEEKS) for his tireless ef-
forts to ensure that Congress cele-
brates and upholds Harriet Tubman’s 
legacy of passionate advocacy for civil 
rights, women’s suffrage, and the lib-
eration of enslaved persons. 
Historians value coins and currencies 
as an important form of visual story-
telling. This is because the objects and, 
more importantly, the people depicted 
on a currency reflects the values and 
the narratives that a society tells 
about itself. As such, I cannot think of 
an individual who more perfectly em-
bodies American values of seeking jus-
tice, protecting freedom, and enduring 
personal sacrifices in the pursuit of a 
more perfect Union than Harriet Tub-
man. 
Born enslaved in March 1822 on the 
plantation of Anthony Thompson in 
Dorchester County, Maryland, Harriet 
Ross Tubman, also known as Araminta 
‘‘Minty’’ Ross, was a notable aboli-
tionist, who not only freed herself but 
also others from slavery. 
After freeing herself in the fall of 1849 
with the help of the Underground Rail-
road network, Tubman devoted herself 
to the arduous and life-threatening 
process of freeing other enslaved per-
sons. Throughout the 1850s, Tubman 
made 13 trips back to Maryland, guid-
ing approximately 70 enslaved persons 
to the north, including family mem-
bers, and providing instruction to 
about 70 more who found their way to 
freedom on their own. 
During the Civil War, Tubman served 
as a spy, cook, and a nurse in South 
Carolina and Florida. She also re-
cruited newly freed African-American 
men to join regiments of African- 
American soldiers called United States 
Colored Troops and served herself as an 
Army scout and spy for Union leaders 
Major General David Hunter and Colo-
nel James Montgomery. For her in-
valuable service, Tubman was inducted 
into the Military Intelligence Corps 
Hall of Fame. 
After the Civil War, Tubman contin-
ued her legacy of activism and care for 
the community, often sheltering and 
providing for newly freed, formerly 
enslaved persons in her home on South 
Street in Auburn, New York. 
Ms. Tubman was also an ardent sup-
porter of women’s suffrage, civil rights, 
and access to healthcare, and would at-
tend meetings and give speeches in sup-
port of these rights in Boston, New 
York City, and Washington, D.C. 
This bipartisan bill championed by 
Representative MEEKS and Representa-
tive KATKO would provide tangible sup-
port to the National Underground Rail-
road Freedom Center in Cincinnati, 
Ohio, and the Harriet Tubman Home, 
Incorporated, in Auburn, New York, to 
advance their shared mission of shar-
ing Harriet Tubman’s legacy and con-
tinuance to advance her vision of a 
more just and equitable America. 
This bill directs the Secretary of the 
Treasury to produce noncirculating 
commemorative 
coins 
for 
purchase 
bearing Harriet Tubman’s image and 
depicting her legacy as an abolitionist. 
I thank Representatives MEEKS and 
KATKO
for introducing this historic 
bill, and I urge Members to support 
this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
b 2100 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise, too, in sup-
port of H.R. 1842, the Harriet Tubman 
Bicentennial 
Commemorative 
Coin 
Act. 
Harriet 
Tubman, 
born 
Araminta 
Ross, is one of the most well-known 
conductors of the Underground Rail-
road. An escaped slave herself, Harriet 
navigated the Underground Railroad 
and reached safety in Philadelphia in 
1849. 
Instead of remaining in Philadelphia, 
Harriet made numerous secret return 
trips to Maryland to free her friends 
and family. It is unclear just how many 
trips she made, but over a 10-year pe-
riod, she never once lost one of her pas-
sengers, and she was never caught. 
Many know Harriet for her contribu-
tions to the Underground Railroad. 
However, the knowledge she gained by 
leading numerous covert missions was 
also critical to the Union military suc-
cess. 
In addition to mapping Southern 
towns and transportation routes for 
the Union Army, Harriet Tubman 
would disguise herself as an unassum-
ing elderly slave and wander the 
streets of Confederate towns, scouting 
military positions and supply lines, 
once again proving that Harriet was al-
ways willing to put her life on the line 
to defeat and destroy the system of 
slavery. 
Harriet Tubman lived a truly ex-
traordinary life and, in doing so, saved 
countless lives, not only those she 
navigated to freedom but of Union sol-
diers who used her intelligence to de-
feat their opponents, the Confederate 
forces. 
Her incredible life cannot be summa-
rized in 1 speech or 10 on this House 
floor, but the commemorative coin pro-
duced by H.R. 1842 will hopefully in-
spire a new generation to study her 
history. 
Madam Speaker, I support this bill, 
and I urge my colleagues to support it 
as well, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time until my 
colleague yields back. 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, let me 
say that each day as I drive through 
downtown Little Rock, I pass the most 
handsome statue of Harriet Tubman 
right outside our city hall. She has her 
walking stick and her cape. She is in 
that disguise as that slave woman 
walking the streets of that Confederate 
town. It brings inspiration to all the 
citizens of Little Rock to see this ex-
traordinary woman in this public piece 
of art in front of our city hall. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
KATKO), an author of the bill. 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I ap-
preciate the comments of my col-
leagues, Ms. WATERS and Mr. HILL, and 
I adopt those comments as well. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote in favor of H.R. 1842, 
the Harriet Tubman Bicentennial Com-
memorative Coin Act. 
It is an honor and privilege to speak 
in support of this bill, which comes to 
the floor just over 200 years from the 
time of Harriet Tubman’s birth. 
Across this country and around the 
world, Harriet Tubman is remembered 
as an icon of freedom and an agent of 
change. After her escape from slavery 
and work as a conductor on the Under-
ground Railroad, Harriet Tubman re-
sided in Auburn, New York, for several 
years—right down the road from her 
friend and mentor, William Seward. 
Her former home has become a cher-
ished site in central New York, and I 
have been proud to represent the Har-
riet Tubman Home and work with its 
caretaker since I came to Congress. To-
day’s vote represents one of the most 
significant steps forward in strength-
ening Federal recognition of the Har-
riet Tubman Home since its designa-
tion as a national park in 2017.

July 26, 2022 
Specifically, I am pleased that the 
coins issued under this legislation 
bearing Harriet Tubman’s likeness and 
symbolizing her legacy will directly 
benefit preservation and education ef-
forts at the Tubman Home in Auburn 
for years to come. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Congress-
man MEEKS for joining me in intro-
ducing the House version of this bill, as 
well as Senators PORTMAN and ROSEN 
for their successful efforts to unani-
mously pass this legislation in the Sen-
ate earlier this year. 
Madam Speaker, I look forward to 
sending this bill to the President’s 
desk for signature, and I urge my col-
leagues to vote in favor of honoring a 
truly great American hero who was 
tough as nails. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to follow the recommendation 
from Mr. KATKO and support H.R. 1842, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gentle-
men from New York, Mr. MEEKS and 
Mr. KATKO, for their hard work on this 
bill. I thank the gentlewoman from Ne-
vada, Senator ROSEN, and the gen-
tleman from Ohio, Senator PORTMAN, 
for leading the Senate companion 
version of this bill. 
Who we choose to honor on our cur-
rency says a lot about who we are and 
what we value as a society. This bill is 
an opportunity for us to declare to our-
selves and to our prosperity that we 
are a society who values courage in the 
face of oppression, and liberty and jus-
tice for all, not just for the lucky few. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to declare themselves as sup-
porters of these shared American val-
ues by supporting this bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
WATERS) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1842. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

California (Ms. WATERS) and the gen-
tleman from Arkansas (Mr. HILL) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks on this 
legislation and include extraneous ma-
terial. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Representa-
tive TORRES for introducing H.R. 6528, 
the Housing Temperature Safety Act of 
2022, in response to the tragic apart-
ment fire that occurred in his district 
in the Bronx. Seventeen people died in 
that fire, including eight children, 
while dozens more were injured. Sadly, 
this tragedy was entirely preventable 
and even foreseeable. 
The Twin Parks North West apart-
ment building was home to 120 fami-
lies, including 91 families who were as-
sisted through the housing choice 
voucher program. Because of heating 
and ventilation issues in the building, 
too often families found themselves 
shivering in their apartments, forcing 
them to take matters into their own 
hands by purchasing space heaters, 
which were deemed to be the cause of 
this tragic fire. 
To address this issue, and to better 
hold housing providers accountable to 
ensuring their apartments are meeting 
temperature requirements, H.R. 6528 
would create a pilot program to install 
and study the efficacy of temperature 
sensors in federally assisted housing. 
b 2110 
As the tragedy in the Bronx proved, 
inadequate heating and cooling in fed-
erally assisted units is a danger to our 
communities. This bill provides a key 
step towards researching and improv-
ing tools to better ensure families’ 
homes are both safe and warm. 
I thank Representative TORRES for 
his leadership on this issue. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support H.R. 6528, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, on the morning of 
January 9, a fire broke out in the Twin 
Parks North West apartment building 
in the Bronx, New York. Seventeen 
lives were tragically lost that day, in-
cluding eight children. Investigators 
later determined that the fire was 
caused by a defective space heater left 
on to warm an apartment that was too 
cold on that terrible January winter 
night. 
H.R. 6528, ably written by my good 
friend from the Bronx, New York (Mr. 
TORRES), would create a pilot program 
at the Department of Housing and 
Urban Development for building own-
ers to voluntarily install temperature 
sensors in federally assisted buildings. 
The hope is that temperature sensors 
authorized by this pilot program will 
help monitor the conditions inside 
housing units to ensure that conditions 
are not too hot in the summer or too 
cold in the winter. 
Property owners who contract with 
HUD have a responsibility to maintain 
decent, safe, and sanitary housing, and 
this legislation might help to ensure 
that these homes have adequate heat 
during the winter so residents will not 
have to rely on space heaters to keep 
warm. 
Representative TORRES’ idea will try 
to protect the welfare of renters in fed-
erally assisted housing and is a pilot 
program worth taking a look at to see 
if this can make a real difference. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. TORRES). 
Mr. TORRES of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I am enormously grateful to 
Chair WATERS
for her advocacy for 
safe, decent, and affordable housing 
and her support. I thank the Rep-
resentative from Arkansas for his kind 
words. 
The Housing Temperature Safety 
Act, H.R. 6528, comes more than 6 
months following the tragedy of Twin 
Parks North West which was the scene 
of the deadliest fire in New York City 
history in more than three decades. 
Even though the immediate cause of 
the fire was a malfunctioning space 
heater, the deeper cause of the fire can-
not be overlooked. 
We must ask ourselves a simple but 
fundamental question: What prompted 
tenants to use hazardous space heaters 
in the first place? 
The answer, of course, is the chronic 
deprivation of heat and hot water 
which is all too common in places like 
the South Bronx. Tenants freezing in 
their apartments are left with no 
choice but to resort to space heaters 
out of desperation for heat. A space 
heater is often a cry for help and a cry 
for heat. 
The catastrophic fire at Twin Parks 
North West was a consequence not only 
of a broken space heater but also of an 
equally broken system of housing code 
enforcement. 
The Housing Temperature Safety Act 
would pilot the use of heat sensors 
which would enable State and local 
housing 
administrators 
to 
monitor 
heat and hot water levels in real time 
in order to hold property owners ac-
countable for providing sufficient heat 
and hot water. 
When I served on the New York City 
Council, I passed a local law estab-
lishing the New York City Heat Sen-
sors Program which led to a 58 percent 
decline in heat and hot water com-
plaints among buildings where the sen-
sors were installed. 
The Housing Temperature Safety Act 
of 2022 presents us with a historic op-
portunity to harness the power of tech-
nology to bring housing code enforce-
ment into the 21st century which is 
long overdue. 
Madam Speaker, I strongly encour-
age my colleagues to vote for H.R. 6528 
and embrace the future of housing en-
forcement in America. 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I want to 
commend my friend from New York 
(Mr. TORRES) who has brought his ex-
ceptional service to the people of the 
Bronx to the people’s House. He does 
what all Members do here which is 
take a great idea at a time of tragedy 
when he learned a better way to do 
something and bring that to the House, 
use it as an example from which all 
Americans can benefit. 
So, again, Madam Speaker, I encour-
age my colleagues to support H.R. 6528, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 6528 is an im-
portant step forward in holding hous-
ing providers accountable to better 
protect the health and safety of fami-
lies receiving Federal housing assist-
ance. 
What happened in the Bronx is a 
tragedy that was wholly preventable. 
While more must be done to prevent 
similar tragedies, I am glad that we are 
providing new solutions to improve fire 
safety in Federal housing. 
I thank Representative TORRES for 
this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I, again, urge my 
colleagues to join me in supporting 
H.R. 6528, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
WATERS) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6528, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
PROMOTING NEW AND DIVERSE 
DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS ACT

Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be deter-
mined by reference to the latest statement 
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in 
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. WATERS) and the gen-
tleman from Arkansas (Mr. HILL) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks on this legislation and to insert 
extraneous material thereon. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I support H.R. 4590, 
the Promoting New and Diverse Depos-
itory Institutions Act, sponsored by 
Representative JAKE AUCHINCLOSS, the 
vice chair of the Financial Services 
Committee. 
Since the 1980s, we have seen steady 
consolidation in the number of U.S. de-
pository 
institutions 
from 
having 
roughly 33,000 banks and credit unions 
in 1980 to less than 10,000 today. Over 
the last decade, we have also seen a re-
duction of 3,300 branches by the four 
largest banks leaving behind banking 
deserts where residents lack access to a 
nearby branch for basic banking serv-
ices. 
I have also been troubled by the re-
cent decline of roughly one-third of all 
minority depository institutions, also 
known as MDIs, and more than half of 
Black-owned banks since the 2008 fi-
nancial crisis. 
In December 2020, I was pleased to 
work with Ranking Member MCHENRY 
and Senators BROWN, CRAPO, and WAR-
NER to reach a bipartisan deal to pro-
vide $12 billion in capital investments 
and grants to shore up and strengthen 
existing MDIs as well as community 
development 
financial 
institutions, 
better known as CDFIs. 
But I am still concerned that very 
few depository institutions, especially 
MDIs, have been newly chartered in re-
cent years while banking deserts con-
tinue to grow. This bill would help ad-
dress this concern by requiring regu-
lators to study this problem, request 
feedback from the public, and develop a 
strategic plan so they can take steps to 
encourage the creation of new banks 
and credit unions, including MDIs and 
CDFIs. 
H.R. 4590 also requires regulators to 
share with Congress any legislative 
recommendations to further promote 
the creation of new depository institu-
tions, 
again, 
including 
MDIs 
and 
CDFIs. 
So I thank Vice Chair AUCHINCLOSS 
for his work on this bill which received 
bipartisan support in our committee. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support H.R. 4590, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
b 2120 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Since the Dodd-Frank Act was en-
acted, the number of community finan-
cial institutions has steadily declined. 
Republicans know this trend is due to 
increased regulatory and compliance 
burdens banks and credit unions face 
that inhibit their ability to survive, let 
alone, thrive. Republicans have con-
sistently 
pushed 
for 
regulatory 
rightsizing including tailoring regula-
tion, not imposing one-size-fits-all re-
quirements. 
H.R. 4950 directs the banking agen-
cies to study ways to promote the es-
tablishment of new banks and credit 
unions, including community develop-
ment financial institutions, CDFIs, and 
minority financial institutions. 
This bill requires the banking agen-
cies to report to this body, the Con-
gress, on challenges faced by proposed 
depository institutions and to develop 
a strategic plan to promote establish-
ment of new financial institutions. 
The banking agencies will provide 
the Congress with recommendations on 
how best to propose financial institu-
tions and help them navigate that reg-
ulatory process. 
H.R. 4950 is a first step toward identi-
fying and addressing the challenges 
posed to the chartering of new banks 
and credit unions. 
The fact is, Madam Speaker, encour-
aging the establishment of de novo fi-
nancial institutions will help fill the 
needs left by bank consolidations and 
bank closures over the past decade. 
This will increase banking options and 
competition to better serve families, 
small businesses, and our local commu-
nities. The loss of local banks and cred-
it unions has disproportionately af-
fected rural communities. 
Republicans support efforts to better 
understand the challenges that pro-
spective de novo depository institu-
tions face and identifying the solutions 
to promote a greater number of new 
charters. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I

H7152 
July 26, 2022 
Massachusetts (Mr. AUCHINCLOSS), who 
is also the vice chair of the Financial 
Services Committee. 
Mr. AUCHINCLOSS. Madam Speaker, 
I will begin by thanking the Chair-
woman of the Financial Services Com-
mittee for her support of this legisla-
tion and for her career-long support for 
financial access and inclusion; and, 
also, my colleague from Arkansas’ sup-
port to make this a bipartisan initia-
tive. 
Madam Speaker, our economy has 
not always worked for all communities 
equally. This is evident in the glaring 
wealth disparities for American fami-
lies emphasized in the 2019 survey of 
Consumer Finances Federal Reserve 
Report. 
One way to address these issues is to 
ensure access to diverse and affordable 
financial services that can help indi-
viduals save money and help small 
businesses raise capital. That is why I 
urge my colleagues to vote for my bill, 
the Promoting New and Diverse Depos-
itory Institutions Act. 
Over the last several decades, there 
has been consolidation among banks 
and credit unions. This has effectively 
limited the products available to con-
sumers and artificially driven up costs 
while closing banking branches for peo-
ple who already did not have many 
choices. 
My bipartisan bill is the first step to 
increasing the supply of banking serv-
ices by directing banking regulators to 
work together to address the chal-
lenges that new depository institu-
tions, including MDIs and CDFIs, face 
when applying for a charter. 
Starting and maintaining a new bank 
or credit union is hard work. It is the 
banking regulators’ responsibility to 
measure and mitigate the challenges 
that new banks face. 
MDIs and CDFIs play a unique and 
vital role in our financial system and 
often have a close relationship with 
their consumers. By investing in and 
supporting MDIs and CDFIs, Congress 
can foster economic opportunities for 
people who otherwise are unable to ac-
cess affordable banking services in a 
system that is already restricted and 
restrictive. 
My bill will help new banks, and in so 
doing, it will expand access to afford-
able services for unbanked commu-
nities. I believe this bill is a necessary 
step toward advancing economic equal-
ity in our country, and I ask your help 
to ensure that all Americans have ac-
cess to affordable banking services re-
gardless of their address. 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, let me 
thank my friend from Massachusetts 
for his passion on this. I spent the bet-
ter part of half of my career in commu-
nity banking, and I know the consoli-
dation, how it has impacted, particu-
larly, rural counties that no longer 
have a banking office. 
And I also know how the regulatory 
burden has raised the immense costs of 
trying to form a new de novo banking 
corporation. It is just putting it out of 
reach of many, many groups of civic 
leaders, entrepreneurs, local people 
and, certainly, those trying to form a 
minority depository institution, or a 
CDFI. 
So I commend my friend from Massa-
chusetts for his work on this bill. It 
does have bipartisan support. I urge my 
colleagues to support it. 
In conclusion, Madam Speaker, I in-
clude in the RECORD a letter to the 
Speaker and the minority leader, in ad-
dition to the chair and ranking mem-
ber of the House Financial Services 
Committee from the Independent Com-
munity Bankers of America expressing 
their full support of H.R. 4590. 
INDEPENDENT COMMUNITY 
BANKERS OF AMERICA, 
July 26, 2022. 
Re Support for the Promoting New and Di-
verse Depository Institutions Act (H.R. 
4590). 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. MAXINE WATERS, 
Chairwoman, Committee on Financial Services, 
House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. KEVIN MCCARTHY, 
Minority Leader, 
House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. PATRICK MCHENRY, 
Ranking Republican, Committee on Financial 
Services, 
House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI, MINORITY LEADER 
MCCARTHY, CHAIRWOMAN WATERS, AND RANK-
ING MEMBER MCHENRY: 
On behalf of community banks across the 
country, with nearly 50,000 locations, I write 
to thank you for scheduling floor consider-
ation of the Promoting New and Diverse De-
pository Institutions Act (H.R. 4590), spon-
sored by Rep. Jake Auchincloss, and to ex-
press our support for this legislation. ICBA 
urges all Members of the House to vote YES 
on H.R. 4590. 
The Promoting New and Diverse Deposi-
tory Institutions Act requires the Federal 
banking regulators to conduct a joint study 
to assess the challenges faced by proposed 
depository institutions, including proposed 
minority 
depository 
institutions 
(MDIs), 
seeking de novo depository institution char-
ters and to provide legislative recommenda-
tions to help these proposed institutions suc-
cessfully obtain charters. There has been a 
dearth of de novo charters in the past dec-
ade. An infusion of new charters is needed to 
offset consolidation in the banking sector 
and create a competitive landscape that will 
benefit consumers and small businesses 
alike. Notably, new community bank char-
ters, including new MDI charters, are needed 
to provide access to capital and banking 
services that play a pivotal role in reaching 
unbanked populations and underserved com-
munities across the nation. 
Concrete, actionable proposals are needed 
to turn the tide of stagnant de novo bank 
formation. ICBA supports an array of meas-
ures, such as phasing in capital standards for 
de novo banks over a period of three years 
and allowing for greater flexibility to modify 
the de novo business plan as conditions war-
rant. Start-up capital is often the greatest 
impediment to forming a new bank, and 
these provisions, among others, would help 
spur the creation of de novo charters, includ-
ing MDIs. 
Thank you for your consideration. ICBA 
looks forward to working with you to ad-
vance H.R. 4590 into law. 
Sincerely, 
REBECA ROMERO RAINEY, 
President & CEO. 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
H.R. 4590 is supported by a wide range 
of stakeholders, including California & 
Nevada Credit Union Leagues, Commu-
nity Development Bankers Associa-
tion, Inclusiv, Independent Community 
Bankers Association, and many others. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
WATERS) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4590, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

DEVELOPING 
AND 
EMPOWERING 
OUR ASPIRING LEADERS ACT OF 
2022 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 4227) to require the Securities 
and Exchange Commission to revise 
the definition of a qualifying invest-
ment, for purposes of the exemption 
from registration for venture capital 
fund advisers under the Investment Ad-
visers Act of 1940, to include an equity 
security issued by a qualifying port-
folio company and to include an invest-
ment in another venture capital fund, 
and for other purposes, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4227 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Developing 
and Empowering our Aspiring Leaders Act of 
2022’’. 
SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS. 
Not later than the end of the 180-day period 
beginning on the date of the enactment of 
this Act, if the Securities and Exchange 
Commission determines the revisions would 
facilitate capital formation without compro-
mising investor protection, the Commission 
shall— 
(1) revise the definition of a qualifying in-
vestment under paragraph (c) of section 
275.203(l)–1 of title 17, Code of Federal Regu-
lations, to include an equity security issued 
by a qualifying portfolio company, whether 
acquired directly from the company or in a 
secondary acquisition; and 
(2) revise paragraph (a) of such section to 
require, as a condition of a private fund 
qualifying as a venture capital fund under 
such paragraph, that the qualifying invest-
ments of the private fund are predominantly 
qualifying investments that were acquired 
directly from a qualifying portfolio com-
pany.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7153 
July 26, 2022 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. WATERS) and the gen-
tleman from Arkansas (Mr. HILL) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks on this legislation and to insert 
extraneous material thereon. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I support H.R. 4227, the Developing 
and Empowering Our Aspiring Leaders 
Act of 2021, introduced by Mr. HOL-
LINGSWORTH. This bill would authorize 
the Securities and Exchange Commis-
sion, or SEC, to revise its rules on ven-
ture capital investment regulations to 
allow investments acquired through 
secondary transactions or investments 
in other venture capital funds to be 
considered as qualifying investments 
for venture capital funds. 
Importantly, the SEC would only be 
required to revise its rules if it finds 
that the revision would facilitate cap-
ital formation without reducing inves-
tor protections. 
I want to ensure startups and small 
businesses have access to capital, but 
as this bill stipulates, access to capital 
should not come at the expense of in-
vestor protections. This bill strikes the 
right balance, and I so urge my col-
leagues to support this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
b 2130 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise, as well, in support of H.R. 4227, 
the Developing and Empowering our 
Aspiring Leaders Act, or DEAL Act. I 
commend my colleague from Indiana 
(Mr. HOLLINGSWORTH) and my col-
leagues from across the aisle for col-
laborating on H.R. 4227. 
By investing in companies that help 
drive economic growth and job cre-
ation, venture capital funds play an 
important role in the success and over-
all health of the American economy. In 
fact, earlier this year, it was reported 
that employment from U.S.-backed VC 
companies grew 960 percent from 1990 
to 2020. That is eight times the employ-
ment growth at non-venture-capital- 
backed companies. 
Jobs created by VC-backed enter-
prises are widely distributed across the 
U.S. 
In 2020, despite COVID–19 pandemic 
conditions, more than 10,800 companies 
across the United States received ven-
ture capital funding. Additionally, in 
2020, venture capital investment in the 
United States totaled $164 billion. 
However, the registered investment 
adviser rules, promulgated by the Se-
curities 
and 
Exchange 
Commission 
under the Dodd-Frank Act, inadvert-
ently discouraged some venture capital 
firms from continuing to invest in 
companies through what are called sec-
ondary investments. 
Though advisers from venture capital 
funds were exempt statutorily from 
registration as a registered investment 
adviser, the Dodd-Frank Act required 
the SEC to define what qualified as a 
venture capital fund. 
As written, the SEC’s rules state that 
VC funds can only have 20 percent of 
their capital commitments in non-
qualifying investments. 
Specifically, the SEC definition for 
qualifying 
investments 
for 
venture 
capital funds prohibits secondary ac-
quisitions from being considered as 
qualifying investments, which means 
that the secondary acquisitions fall 
into that 20 percent nonqualifying 
bucket. 
Therefore, Madam Speaker, small, 
private companies that need additional 
capital to grow and grow big enough to 
then go public cannot turn to the ven-
ture capital industry for secondary ac-
quisition because such funds are con-
cerned that they might well exceed the 
20 percent limit and then trigger that 
the VC fund has to register as an RIA. 
Mr. HOLLINGSWORTH’s bill, H.R. 4227, 
remedies this problem by requiring the 
SEC to revise the definition of a quali-
fying investment to include secondary 
acquisitions for purposes of the RIA ex-
emption. 
This bill is a commonsense piece of 
legislation to ensure that our venture 
capital funds can continue to provide 
capital to small business across our 
land. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my friend, 
Mr. HOLLINGSWORTH, for his work on 
this legislation, and I urge a ‘‘yes’’ 
vote on Mr. HOLLINGSWORTH’s bill, H.R. 
4227. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I support H.R. 4227 and urge its pas-
sage as it correctly balances the need 
to 
provide 
access 
to 
capital 
for 
startups and other businesses with the 
need to protect investors. I note that a 
similar version of this bill previously 
passed this Chamber by a wide bipar-
tisan vote. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
WATERS) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4227, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
The title of the bill was amended so 
as to read: ‘‘A bill to require the Secu-
rities and Exchange Commission to re-
vise the definition of a qualifying in-
vestment to include an equity security 
issued by a qualifying portfolio com-
pany, whether acquired directly from 
the company or in a secondary acquisi-
tion, for purposes of the exemption 
from registration for venture capital 
fund advisers under the Investment Ad-
visers Act of 1940, and for other pur-
poses.’’. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

GREATEST GENERATION 
COMMEMORATIVE COIN ACT 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 1057) to require the Secretary 
of the Treasury to mint coins in com-
memoration of the National World War 
II Memorial in Washington, DC, and for 
other purposes, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1057 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Greatest 
Generation Commemorative Coin Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
The Congress finds the following: 
(1) The National World War II Memorial 
was dedicated in Washington, DC, on May 29, 
2004, and is located on the east end of the Re-
flecting Pool on the National Mall, opposite 
the Lincoln Memorial and west of the Wash-
ington Monument. 
(2) The dedication of the National World 
War II Memorial was the culmination of a 17- 
year effort that started on December 10, 1987 
when the World War II Memorial Act was 
first introduced in the House of Representa-
tives, and was authorized by an Act of Con-
gress signed into law on May 25, 1993. Con-
struction began September 4, 2001, after sev-
eral years of fundraising and public hearings. 
(3) Opening to the public on April 29, 2004, 
the World War II Memorial is the first na-
tional memorial dedicated to all who served 
during World War II and acknowledges the 
commitment and achievement of the entire 
Nation. 
(4) The Memorial honors the more than 
16,000,000 who served in the Armed Forces of 
the United States during World War II, the 
more than 400,000 who died, and the millions 
who supported the war effort from home. 
(5) It is a monument to the spirit, sacrifice, 
and commitment of the American people to 
the common defense of the Nation and to the 
broader causes of peace and freedom from 
tyranny throughout the world. 
(6) Today, the Memorial is a top destina-
tion for millions of annual visitors from all 
over the country and the world. For many 
young visitors, their visit to the Memorial is 
a first glimpse to a grateful Nation’s remem-
brance of the sacrifices made by the World 
War II generation. 
(7) For World War II veterans, the Memo-
rial is a special destination, a rendezvous 
point, and a gathering place for reunions and 
commemoration programs. 
(8) The Friends of the National World War 
II Memorial play a vital role in the preserva-
tion and maintenance of the National World 
War II Memorial as a treasure for the Amer-
ican people, while helping to facilitate key 
commemorative and educational programs

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. WATERS) and the gen-
tleman from Arkansas (Mr. HILL) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
include extraneous material thereon. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of H.R. 1057, which would require 
the Secretary of the Treasury to mint 
coins in commemoration of the Na-
tional World War II Memorial in Wash-
ington, D.C. 
The National World War II Memorial 
is located on the east end of the re-
flecting pool on The National Mall. The 
process for the dedication of the Na-
tional World War II Memorial started 
in 1987, and it was a 17-year effort until 
the memorial was finally opened to the 
public in 2004. 
It is the first national memorial 
dedicated to all who served in World 
War II and acknowledges the commit-
ment and achievement of the entire 
Nation. The memorial today is a top 
destination for millions of annual vis-
its from all over the country and the 
world. 
The more than 16 million people who 
served in the Armed Forces, the more 
than 400,000 who died, and the millions 
who supported the war effort from 
home are all honored with this memo-
rial. It commemorates the spirit, sac-
rifice, and commitment of the Amer-
ican people to the common defense of 
the Nation and to the broader causes of 
peace 
and 
freedom 
from 
tyranny 
throughout the world. 
It acts as a symbol of national unity, 
and it is a timeless reminder of the 
moral strength and power that flows 
when free people are at once united and 
bonded together in a common and just 
cause for liberty. 
This bill, sponsored by Representa-
tive KAPTUR, would provide tangible 
support to the World War II Memorial 
by directing the Secretary of the 
Treasury to produce commemorative 
coins in recognition of everything that 
the memorial represents. 
Madam Speaker, I urge Members to 
support this bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise in strong and enthusiastic sup-
port of H.R. 1057, the Greatest Genera-
tion Commemorative Coin Act. 
What an honor to stand on this House 
floor and pay tribute to that genera-
tion, the World War II heroes who we 
know and love so much, including my 
father-in-law, who helped free the Bu-
chenwald concentration camp, and my 
dad, who flew a B–25. 
Since its inception in 2024, the Na-
tional World War II Memorial has been 
a popular attraction for anybody vis-
iting Washington. Millions visit this 
iconic site annually. 
Along the entrance to the memorial 
plaza are 12 bronze relief panels that 
show scenes from the Atlantic front 
and 12 scenes from the Pacific front. 
The Rainbow Pool is at the center of 
the plaza, and behind that pool is the 
Freedom Wall. 
During World War II, the gold star 
was used as a symbol to indicate that 
a member of the family had lost their 
life in the war. The 4,048 gold stars on 
the Freedom Wall commemorate the 
more than 400,000 Americans who paid 
the ultimate cost and gave their life in 
the war for freedom in Europe and in 
the Pacific. 
Anytime I visit the memorial, I al-
ways take an extra second to walk and 
read the quote from President Truman 
found on the memorial wall. It reads:

July 26, 2022 
‘‘Our debt to the heroic men and val-
iant women in the service of our coun-
try can never be repaid. They have 
earned our undying gratitude. America 
will never forget their sacrifices.’’ 
This memorial is an important place 
for all Americans, but unfortunately, 
its age is beginning to show. Coming up 
on its 18th year of service, the memo-
rial is in need of repair—hence the im-
portance, Madam Speaker, of passing 
this legislation today. 
b 2140 
The surcharges or proceeds from this 
coin program will go to the Friends of 
the National World War II Memorial to 
support the maintenance and repair of 
the memorial and the continuation of 
important education programs so that 
the youth of tomorrow never forget the 
service and sacrifice of those who came 
before. 
I thank my old friend Senator Bob 
Dole for all the years that he supported 
us in trying to get this memorial built 
and was there and lived to see it. And 
I thank the gentlewoman from Ohio 
(Ms. KAPTUR), my dear friend, not only 
for the bill today to maintain the me-
morial but for originating the legisla-
tion that authorized the commission 
that established the memorial back in 
1993. 
Those who give their lives for our 
country should be memorialized and re-
membered for all future generations. I 
support this bill, and I urge the entire 
House to stand up and support this bill 
for the memories of all those who 
served in World War II. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR). 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Chair WATERS for moving this 
bill and I thank Ranking Member HILL, 
as well, on behalf of the American peo-
ple. 
The dedication of the World War II 
Memorial on our National Mall was the 
culmination of a 17-year effort in Con-
gress to construct the first national 
memorial dedicated to the 16 million 
Americans who served in the Armed 
Forces during World War II and the 
more than 400,000 who died for liberty. 
As the Representative who in 1987 in-
troduced the original legislation to 
construct the national memorial, I am 
thrilled to rise tonight in support of 
H.R. 1057, the National World War II 
Memorial Greatest Generation Com-
memorative Coin Act. 
I also rise, respectfully, in memory of 
World War II Army combat veteran 
Roger Durbin of Berkey, Ohio, who 
first suggested this meritorious idea to 
me, as well as my own uncle Stanley 
Rogowski, who fought in D-day and 
across France to free Paris and on to 
Brussels and Belgium and Luxembourg, 
and Anthony Rogowski, his brother, 
who fought in the Office of Strategic 
Services building the Burma Road in 
the very difficult battles in Asia. 
This bipartisan piece of legislation 
authorizes the U.S. Treasury to mint 
coins in commemoration of the Na-
tional World War II Memorial in Wash-
ington, D.C. The coin will serve as an 
important symbol of the spirit, sac-
rifice, and commitment of the brave 
Americans who fought to defend lib-
erty, defeat tyranny, and establish in-
stitutions to safeguard peace and free-
dom in the 20th and 21st centuries and 
beyond. 
This legislation will ensure the me-
morial is properly maintained for years 
to come and, importantly, that the his-
torical, educational, and commemora-
tive programming is prepared to better 
inform the millions of people who visit 
each year and allow collections to be 
shared nationwide. 
Since the memorial’s inception in 
2004, nearly 80 million people have vis-
ited the site, making it one of the most 
popular sites in our Nation. Approxi-
mately 240,000 World War II veterans 
are still living with us today, including 
9,000 Ohioans. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman. 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
Sustaining the World War II Memo-
rial for them and, importantly, to bet-
ter inform and enhance interpretation 
of the purposes for which the war was 
fought will provide generations to 
come with a greater sense of America’s 
history, and of course this is near and 
dear to all of our hearts. 
Please let me thank our partners at 
the Friends of the World War II Memo-
rial, Holly Rotondi and Paul Marcone, 
and 
our 
staff 
assistant 
Margaret 
McInnis for their wonderful service in 
helping us move this bill forward to 
where it is today. 
I also thank the gentleman from Illi-
nois (Mr. KINZINGER) and the 300 House 
Members who sponsored this bipartisan 
bill as well as our Senate counterparts, 
Senators MIKE
ROUNDS
and JEANNE 
SHAHEEN, for their bipartisan support. 
It is nice to do things on a bipartisan 
basis. 
Let me finally express gratitude to 
the marvelous, talented, and caring 
Chairwoman MAXINE WATERS for mov-
ing this bill along with so many, many 
others and for her dutiful service to the 
Nation, and her colleagues, Ranking 
Member PATRICK MCHENRY as well as 
Congressman FRENCH
HILL
for their 
very generous support. I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 1057. 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I urge a 
‘‘yes’’ vote on this important bill, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time to 
close. 
I thank Congresswoman KAPTUR for 
her work to guarantee that the stories 
and values the World War II Memorial 
represents 
continue 
to 
circulate 
throughout the Nation. Madam Speak-
er and Members, each evening that I 
am in Washington, D.C. when I leave 
the Capitol to go home, I pass this me-
morial, and I think about MARCY KAP-
TUR. 
I think about the first time that I 
learned and understood she created 
this. This was her legislation, and so it 
absolutely continues her vision, her 
foresight, and her love for the sac-
rifices that have been made by so many 
by establishing this World War II Me-
morial and everything that it rep-
resents. 
I am so grateful that I am able here 
this evening to show my support and to 
thank her for what she has done in cre-
ating that memorial. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
supporting this important piece of leg-
islation. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
WATERS) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1057, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

CONGRATULATING SAVANNAH/HIL-
TON HEAD INTERNATIONAL AIR-
PORT 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge 
the 
Savannah/Hilton 
Head 
Inter-
national 
Airport’s 
achievement 
in 
being voted the best domestic airport 
by Travel & Leisure magazine. 
Since its first flight took off in 1918, 
the Savannah Airport has served the 
American people and our military in 
connecting them to the rest of the 
country. Today, this airport serves 11 
different airlines with 37 nonstop des-
tinations all across the U.S. 
‘‘A lovely jewel of an airport’’ and ‘‘a 
very nice surprise’’ were just a few 
things visitors and residents had to say 
about the Savannah/Hilton Head Inter-
national Airport. 
From local favorites like Leopold’s 
Ice Cream to easily navigated termi-
nals, you can expect to receive Georgia 
hospitality 
with 
every 
connecting 
flight. 
Every day, I am more and more 
proud of the district that I represent. 
We can’t stop winning. 
Congratulations to the staff, TSA 
workers, and everyone else involved at 
Savannah/Hilton 
Head 
International 
Airport on this tremendous achieve-
ment.

RECOMMITTING OURSELVES TO 
THE PROMISE OF THE ADA 
(Ms. PORTER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. PORTER. Madam Speaker, dis-
ability should not keep any American 
from fully participating in public life. 
This week marks the 32nd anniver-
sary of the Americans with Disabilities 
Act. The ADA provides critical protec-
tions 
for 
jobseekers 
powering 
our 
workforce. It helps students thrive in 
our schools, and it empowers citizens 
to participate in our democracy. 
But like any law, the ADA is only as 
good as our ability to enforce it. For 
too many, the ADA does not deliver ac-
commodations that people with dis-
abilities need. 
I am working to strengthen the ADA, 
including for individuals with mental 
health 
needs. 
My 
Student 
Mental 
Health Rights Act will help univer-
sities adhere to ADA requirements, em-
powering disabled students to succeed. 
As we celebrate the ADA, we recom-
mit ourselves to fulfilling its promise 
of equal protection for all.

HONORING ARMY SERGEANT 
FIRST CLASS GARRETT HANAS 
(Mr. BURCHETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor Army Sergeant 
First Class Garret Hanas as Ten-
nessee’s 
Second 
Congressional 
Dis-
trict’s July Veteran of the Month. 
Sergeant First Class Hanas served his 
country for over 20 years assigned to 
the 82nd Airborne Division and spent a 
large chunk of his military career 
jumping out of airplanes, and he is 
probably the only person you will ever 
meet who has survived a parachute 
failure twice. He broke his back in the 
same three places both times, which 
left him with lots of health complica-
tions. 
He didn’t let any of this kill his spir-
it, though. He once said: ‘‘God had a 
bigger purpose for me, and that was to 
take care our veterans.’’ After retiring 
from the Army after over 20 years of 
service assigned to the 82nd Airborne 
Division, he dedicated much of his time 
to helping his fellow veterans. He got 
heavily involved with the Disabled 
American Veterans Knoxville chapter, 
where he now serves as its commander. 
He was instrumental in raising funds 
to get a new DAV van to transport vet-
erans to their doctor appointments at 
the VA Hospital, and he helped start a 
program to refurbish used scooters and 
wheelchairs to give to east Tennessee 
veterans who need them. 
It is my honor to recognize Sergeant 
First Class Garrett Hanas as Ten-
nessee’s Second District’s Veteran of 
the Month for his service to his coun-
try, his community, and his fellow vet-
erans. 
f 
CREATING A BALANCED ECONOMY 
(Ms. BROWN of Ohio asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. BROWN of Ohio. Madam Speak-
er, when President Biden took office, 
we wasted no time getting to work to 
rebuild a devastated economy. 
From the Build Back Better Act to 
the American Rescue Plan, we have 
taken bold steps to make possible the 
incredible economic progress we see 
today. Progress that made the United 
States the first major economy in the 
world 
to 
recover 
and 
exceed 
prepandemic levels of its GDP, and 2021 
saw the most jobs created in American 
history, while keeping 3.7 million chil-
dren out of poverty. 
Whether it is more good-paying jobs 
or the cost of groceries and gas, our 
goal remains the same, to create a bal-
anced economy so that Americans can 
thrive. 
Together with President Biden, we 
are fighting every day to make it a re-
ality.

NATIONAL HIRE A VETERAN DAY 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, yesterday, we cele-
brated National Hire a Veteran Day. In 
2017, the nonprofit Hire Our Heroes es-
tablished the day to highlight the 
many talented men and women who 
served our country who are now seek-
ing civilian employment. 
Hire Our Heroes serves as a resource 
bank for veterans to seek professional 
advice, 
discover 
new 
training 
re-
sources, and search for new job oppor-
tunities. 
Veterans are an important part of 
our community. They sacrifice a great 
deal to ensure that we live in a Nation 
that is free and safe. While we may 
never be able to fully repay them for 
their sacrifice, the very least we can do 
is help ease the transition back into ci-
vilian life. 
A big part of that transition is ensur-
ing there are well-paying, family-sus-
taining jobs available for our men and 
women in uniform when they return 
home. 
Our veterans are highly trained and 
highly skilled. They deserve our sup-
port while deployed and when they re-
turn home. One of the best ways to do 
that is to prepare them for the work-
force outside of the military. 
Madam Speaker, the best way to 
thank a veteran is to hire a veteran. 
The skills obtained during service are 
invaluable.

THE IMPACT OF INFLATION 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Ar-
kansas (Mr. HILL) is recognized until 10 
p.m. as the designee of the minority 
leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous materials. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Arkansas? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I appre-
ciate my 5 minutes for 1 hour under the 
House rules, which I don’t believe is 
very helpful to my colleagues. 
So let me begin that we are here to 
talk about inflation and the impact of 
inflation on our constituents. 
I will start out briefly and talk about 
Melissa from Adona, Arkansas. She 
says: It is severely impacting us, with 
gas and grocery prices so high that we 
couldn’t make our $300 car payment 
last month because my husband had 
four doctor visits to make. We have to 
do without air conditioning unless it 
gets above 97 degrees. Our grandkids 
come over and say: We thought y’all 
bought groceries. And we tell them we 
did, but that is all we could get. My 
husband is a disabled veteran, and we 
could barely make it before. With the 
rise in prices, we just have faith in the 
Lord that we can meet our needs. 
Madam Speaker, that is Melissa from 
Adona, Arkansas. 
All of our constituents are suffering. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Kentucky (Mr. BARR) to 
talk about the impact of inflation in 
his district. 
Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, whether 
it is Putin’s price hike, corporate 
greed, transitory—depending on the 
day, Madam Speaker, these are just 
some of the false narratives in the 
laundry list of excuses President Biden 
and Democrats have used to try to ex-
plain away the impact of their disas-
trous economic policies. 
The truth is, Madam Speaker, that 
this historic inflation crisis, the fastest 
rate of inflation in 40 years, is the di-
rect result of policy errors. 
The latest excuse from the President 
comes in this tweet from yesterday: 
Can you believe it? At current prices, 
the average driver will spend less than 
they would if prices had stayed at their 
peak. 
The problem is, Madam Speaker, the 
peak was under his policies. 
Here is the real—here’s the real 
tweet: At current prices, Americans 
will spend $1,200 more per person for 
gas and a whole lot more than they 
would have if Joe Biden had not been 
President of the United States. 
The reality is, our country went from 
energy dominant to energy desperate, 
and gas prices have almost doubled in 
less than 2 years from $2.36 per gallon 
to $4.32 today. 
Not only did that peak occur under 
President Biden’s policy, but I think I

July 26, 2022 
speak for all Americans when I say I 
never thought I would see the day when 
an American President would celebrate 
gas prices north of $4 nationwide. 
My story is Charlie from Fleming 
County, Kentucky. He is a farmer, and 
he cannot afford these diesel prices. He 
told me: I don’t know, Congressman, 
where you come up with these numbers 
in Washington, D.C., 9.1 percent infla-
tion. To us in America, it feels two or 
three times that much. 
This inflation is hurting Americans. 
Time to reverse course and end these 
disastrous 
policies 
of 
war 
against 
American energy. 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my friend from Kentucky for his strong 
words. 
While Mr. DONALDS is coming for-
ward, I got a note from Ron in Little 
Rock. He is a 100 percent disabled vet-
eran. He is not eating well. He is not 
able to go places because of the cost of 
gas in this country. He has to conserve 
his gas money in order to go to the VA 
for his primary care. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. DONALDS), 
my friend from Florida’s 19th Congres-
sional District. 
Mr. DONALDS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Arkansas 
(Mr. HILL) for yielding. 
Energy prices are up over 35 percent. 
Groceries have surged more than 11.9 
percent. The consumer price index is 
up 9.1 percent. The producer price 
index is up close to 12 percent. 
None of this was happening before 
the American Rescue Plan was passed 
by Congressional Democrats and signed 
into law by Joe Biden. Before that time 
period, our inflation rate was holding 
steady between 2 and 3 percent. 
What happened? What happened was 
the Congressional Democrats and the 
President of the United States, Joe 
Biden, unleashed a labor shortage on 
the United States. People did not have 
to go to work in order to continue to 
buy goods. So what happens when you 
take people out of the workforce is 
that they have money to spend, but 
there is not enough supply in the econ-
omy because enough people are not 
working to provide the products for 
enough goods. So if there are not 
enough 
goods, 
but 
everybody 
has 
money, prices go up. It happens every 
single time. 
This is very simple. Even Lawrence 
Summers, who was an economic ad-
viser to Bill Clinton, said that the 
American Rescue Plan was going to un-
leash a massive inflation in the United 
States. House Republicans said if you 
pass that bill, it is going to unleash a 
massive inflation the United States. 
So the American people need to know 
and understand that it is the policies of 
Congressional 
Democrats 
and 
Joe 
Biden that have unleashed the worst 
inflation most Americans have ever 
seen in their lives. 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I yield to 
the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. 
KIM), who will tell us how inflation is 
impacting her constituents. 
b 2200 
Mrs. 
KIM 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank my friend, FRENCH 
HILL, for yielding. 
Families, workers, and small busi-
nesses are hurting from the highest in-
flation in over 40 years, and in South-
ern California where I am from, every-
thing is more expensive. 
Inflation doesn’t discriminate. It im-
pacts every American and hurts small 
businesses and workers with less in-
come the most. 
For example, Raul and Rosalina 
Davis, owners of Tlaquepaque Res-
taurant in Placentia, in my district, 
told my office: ‘‘Higher gas prices and 
issues with our supply chain are lead-
ing to increasing costs from everything 
from beverages to meat for ingredients, 
to workforce shortages. As a res-
taurant, we run our small business 
with very tight revenue margins, and a 
small change in prices can really hurt 
our bottom line. If we have to pass on 
higher costs to our customers, it puts 
us in a tough place when we are com-
peting against bigger restaurants that 
can absorb higher costs.’’ 
While the Biden administration calls 
inflation temporary and seeks to rede-
fine the long-established meaning of a 
recession, I have introduced bills to 
combat inflationary spending, lower 
taxes on Californians, and support job 
creators. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mrs. KIM of California. Policies from 
Congress should make life more afford-
able, not less. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman is no longer recognized. 
Mr. GIMENEZ. Madam Speaker, Thank you, 
Congressman HILL for taking the time to put 
together this special order. 
From Arkansas to South Florida, every 
hardworking American is facing the same di-
lemma under Biden’s presidency. 
Look, we all know the facts. Record high in-
flation, 9.1 percent, a shrinking economy. 
But what we often overlook is just how 
devasting this Biden’s inflation is on everyday 
people and the real-life, practical impact it has 
on hardworking families. Inflation is the worst 
tax on American workers. 
Over the last week, my office has been 
hearing a lot about Biden’s inflation. Many 
families desperate to make ends meet, having 
to choose between feeding their families and 
putting gas in their car. 
Genevieve from Cutler Bay reached out to 
my office saying quote: ‘‘we were already liv-
ing paycheck to paycheck with very little sav-
ings. Now we are dipping in our savings just 
to make ends meet. I am worried that I will not 
be able to pay for after school services for my 
children when the school year starts.’’ 
Marianela from Miami shared similar con-
cerns, saying quote: ‘‘I have less money to 
save or spend. My groceries are to a min-
imum. Costs of gas are a consequence of Mr. 
Biden’s executive orders which have a domino 
effect on everything we have to buy.’’ 
Maria from Key West also reached out to us 
saying quote: ‘‘Constantly negative in the bank 
because bills have doubled in price, had to 
use credit cards after being debt free because 
of how expensive everything is. I was a stay 
at home mom and will have to return to work 
sooner than planned.’’ 
When you go out and talk to people at the 
grocery store, at the gas pumps, parents at 
our schools, they all share the same stories. 
Biden’s 9.1 percent inflation isn’t just some fic-
tional economics stat. 
It means Americans are 9.1 percent poorer 
today than they were a year ago. Hardworking 
Americans are feeling the heat. It’s time Presi-
dent Biden grow a backbone and do the work 
needed to increase our domestic energy, ar-
rest the out-of-control spending, and get our 
economy working again for all Americans. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, 
Six hundred and seventy-seven dollars. 
That’s how much more—per month—Geor-
gians are spending on everyday goods due to 
Biden’s inflation crisis. 
That’s gas. Groceries. Retirement. That’s 
money people need to live their lives. 
Instead, they’re using it to subsidize Biden’s 
far-left agenda. 
And unlike the President, the American peo-
ple can’t just change the definition of a word 
and watch their problems go away. 
Regardless of what the White House’s latest 
blog says, we are headed towards a reces-
sion. In fact, we may already be in one. 
The single mom trying to feed her family 
and the trucker paying more for diesel are 
feeling the sting of this Administration’s poli-
cies daily. 
Recession isn’t just a word to them—it’s a 
lived reality that leads to lost income, jobs, op-
portunities, and even hope. 
Where the White House sees the so-called 
‘‘strength’’ of the economy, my constituents 
see weakness. 
That weakness is emblematic of a failed 
President who is willing to look us in the eye 
and say that we are not in a recession, that 
the $4.30 you’re paying for gas is a gift. 
He’s wrong. 
Washington Democrats’ one-party rule is 
robbing Americans blind. 
We know how to fix this! Unleash American 
energy independence, rein in the runaway 
spending, and pass a budget, which was sup-
posed to happen months ago, so that the 
American people know what their elected offi-
cials value and how their tax dollars are being 
spent. 
It’s time to put the American people first.

NOTICE OF PROPOSED 
RULEMAKING 
U.S. CONGRESS,
OFFICE OF CONGRESSIONAL 
WORKPLACE RIGHTS, 
Washington, DC, July 26, 2022. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR MADAM SPEAKER: Section 210(e) of 
the 
Congressional 
Accountability 
Act 
(‘‘CAA’’), 2 U.S.C. § 1331(e), requires the 
Board of Directors of the Office of Congres-
sional Workplace Rights (‘‘the Board’’) to 
issue regulations implementing Section 210 
of the CAA, relating to the rights and pro-
tections against discrimination in the provi-
sion of public services and accommodations 
established by sections 201 through 230, 302, 
303, and 309 of the Americans with Disabil-
ities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. §§ 12131–12150, 12182, 
12183, and 12189), made applicable to the leg-
islative branch by the CAA. 2 U.S.C. § 1331(a). 
Section 304(b)(1) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. 
§ 1384(b)(1), requires that the Board issue a 
general notice of proposed rulemaking by 
transmitting ‘‘such notice to the Speaker of 
the House of Representatives and the Presi-
dent Pro Tempore of the Senate for publica-
tion in the Congressional Record on the first 
day of which both Houses are in session fol-

telephone: 202–724–9250. 
Sincerely, 
BARBARA CHILDS WALLACE, 
Chair of the Board of Directors, 
Office of Congressional Workplace Rights. 
Attachment. 
NOTICE 
OF 
PROPOSED 
RULEMAKING 
FROM THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF 
THE 
OFFICE 
OF 
CONGRESSIONAL 
WORKPLACE RIGHTS 
Modification of Regulations Under the Amer-
icans With Disabilities Act Relating to Pub-
lic Services and Accommodations, Notice of 
Proposed Rulemaking, as Required by 2 
U.S.C. § 1331, Congressional Accountability 
Act of 1995, As Amended. 
Background: 
The purpose of this Notice of Proposed 
Rulemaking (‘‘Notice’’) is to propose modi-
fications to the pending legislative branch 
Americans with Disabilities Act (‘‘ADA’’) 
substantive regulations under Section 210 of 
the 
Congressional 
Accountability 
Act 
(‘‘CAA’’) (2 U.S.C. § 1331 et seq.), which pro-
vides that the rights and protections against 
discrimination in the provision of public 
services and accommodation under Titles II 
and III of the ADA shall apply to entities 
covered by the CAA. 
The Congressional Accountability Act of 
1995 (‘‘CAA’’), PL 104–1, was enacted into law 
on January 23, 1995. The CAA, as amended, 
applies the rights and protections of 14 fed-
eral labor and employment statutes to cov-
ered employees and employing offices within 
the legislative branch of the federal govern-
ment. Section 210 of the CAA provides that 
the rights and protections against discrimi-
nation in the provision of public services and 
accommodations established by Titles II and 
III (sections 201 through 230, 302, 303, and 309) 
of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 
1990, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131–12150, 12182, 12183, and 
12189 (‘‘ADA’’), shall apply to legislative 
branch entities covered by the CAA. The 
above provisions of section 210 became effec-
tive on January 1, 1997. 2 U.S.C. § 1331(h). 
As set forth in detail below, the Board of 
Directors (‘‘the Board’’) of the Office of Con-
gressional 
Workplace 
Rights 
(‘‘OCWR’’) 
adopted regulations implementing section 
210 of the CAA in 2016. 162 Cong. Rec. H557– 
565, S624–632 (daily ed. February 3, 2016). 
These modified proposed regulations will 
bring OCWR’s ADA regulations in line with 
recent changes to the Department of Jus-
tice’s (‘‘DOJ’’) and Department of Transpor-
tation’s (‘‘DOT’’) ADA regulations and with 
the CAA of 1995 Reform Act of 2018, Pub. L. 
No. 
115–397. 
These 
and 
other 
proposed 
changes are set forth fully in this Notice. De-
letions are marked with square [brackets] 
and 
added 
text 
is 
within 
angled 
<<brackets>>. Therefore, if these regulations 
are approved as proposed, the deletions with-
in square brackets will be removed from the 
regulations and the added text within angled 
brackets will remain. 
What is the authority under the CAA for 
these proposed substantive regulations? 
Section 210(b) of the CAA provides that the 
rights and protections against discrimina-
tion in the provision of public services and 
accommodations established by the provi-
sions of Titles II and III (sections 201 
through 230, 302, 303, and 309) of the Ameri-
cans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. 
§§ 12131 12150, 12182, 12183, and 12189, shall 
apply to the following entities: (1) each of-
fice of the Senate, including each office of a 
Senator and each committee; (2) each office 
of the House of Representatives, including 
each office of a Member of the House of Rep-
resentatives and each committee; (3) each 
joint committee of the Congress; (4) the Of-
fice of Congressional Accessibility Services; 
(5) the Capitol Police; (6) the Congressional 
Budget Office; (7) the Office of the Architect 
of the Capitol (including the Botanic Gar-
den); (8) the Office of the Attending Physi-
cian; (9) the Office of Congressional Work-
place Rights; and (10) the Library of Con-
gress. 2 U.S.C. § 1331(a). 
Section 210(e) of the CAA requires that the 
OCWR Board, pursuant to section 304 of the 
CAA, issue regulations implementing that 
section, and that such regulations ‘‘shall be 
the same as substantive regulations promul-
gated by the Attorney General and the Sec-
retary of Transportation to implement the 
statutory provisions referred to in sub-
section (b) [of section 210 of the CAA] except 
to the extent that the Board may determine, 
for good cause shown and stated together 
with the regulation, that a modification of 
such regulations would be more effective for 
the implementation of the rights and protec-
tions under this section.’’ 2 U.S.C. § 1331(e). 
Are there ADA public access regulations al-
ready in force under the CAA? 
Yes. The first ADA regulations imple-
menting section 210 of the CAA were adopted 
by the Board and published on January 7, 
1997, 142 Cong. Rec. H10676–10711, S10984–11019 
(daily ed. September 19, 1996) and 143 Cong. 
Rec. S30–61 (daily ed. January 7, 1997), after 
providing notice, and receiving and consid-
ering comments in accordance with section 
304 of the CAA. No congressional action was 
taken and thus the 1997 regulations were not 
issued. Revised regulations were adopted by 
the Board and published on February 3, 2016, 
160 Cong. Rec. H7363–7372, S5437–S5447 (daily 
ed. September 9, 2014) and 162 Cong. Rec. 
H557–565, S624–632 (daily ed. February 3, 2016), 
after providing notice, and receiving and 
considering comments in accordance with 
section 304 of the CAA. No congressional ac-
tion was taken and thus the regulations were 
not issued. 
The CAA provides that, while the CAA 
rulemaking procedure is underway, the cor-
responding executive branch regulations are 
to be applied. Section 411 of the CAA (2 
U.S.C. § 1411) provides: 
‘‘Effect of failure to issue regulations. 
In any proceeding under section 1405, 1406, 
1407, or 1408 of this title . . . if the Board has 
not issued a regulation on a matter for 
which this chapter requires a regulation to 
be issued, the hearing officer, Board, or 
court, as the case may be, shall apply, to the 
extent necessary and appropriate, the most 
relevant substantive executive agency regu-
lation promulgated to implement the statu-
tory provision at issue in the proceeding.’’ 
This makes plain that ADA public access 
regulations are presently in force. ‘‘[T]he 
most relevant substantive executive agency 
regulation[s]’’ are the DOJ and DOT ADA 
public access regulations. 
Why are these regulations being proposed at 
this time? 
As set forth above, the CAA requires em-
ploying offices to comply with ADA public 
access regulations issued by the DOJ and 
DOT pursuant to the ADA. The CAA also re-
quires the Board to issue its own regulations 
implementing the ADA public access provi-
sions of the CAA. The statute obligates the 
Board’s regulations to be the same as the 
DOJ and DOT regulations except to the ex-
tent that the Board may determine that a 
modification would be more effective in im-
plementing ADA public access protections. 2 
U.S.C. § 1331(e)(2). These proposed regulations 
will clarify that covered entities must com-
ply with the ADA public access provisions 
applied to public entities and public accom-
modations to implement Titles II and III of 
the ADA. Congressional approval and Board 
issuance of ADA public access regulations 
under the CAA will also eliminate any ques-
tion as to the ADA public access protections 
that are applicable in the legislative branch. 
As set forth above, the Board adopted ADA 
regulations in 1997 and 2016, but no congres-
sional action was taken and therefore these 
regulations were not issued. The Board now 
proposes modifications to regulations adopt-
ed in 2016 to facilitate congressional consid-
eration of the ADA regulations. 
How do these regulations differ from those 
adopted by the Board on February 3, 
2016? 
This proposal consists of modifications to 
the regulations adopted by the Board in 2016. 
There are three significant types of changes: 
1. Updates to DOJ and DOT regulations: 
The proposed regulations set forth herein in-
corporate by reference the pertinent DOJ 
and DOT regulations that are in effect as of 
the date of the publication of this Notice, 
and, as such, have been updated to incor-
porate the changes made in the DOJ and 
DOT regulations since 2014. 
2. Modifications ‘‘for good cause’’: Section 
210(e) of the CAA requires that the regula-
tions issued by the OCWR Board to imple-
ment Titles II and III of the ADA as applied 
by the CAA be the same as those promul-
gated by DOJ and DOT to implement the 
ADA except where the Board determines, for 
good cause shown and stated together with 
the regulation, that a modification of such 
regulations would be more effective for the 
implementation of CAA rights and protec-
tions. 2 U.S.C. § 1331(e). 
3. Unlike the Board in 2016, the current 
Board has decided not to propose adoption of

July 26, 2022 
regulations relating to the two unique statu-
tory duties imposed by the CAA upon the 
General Counsel of the OCWR that are not 
imposed upon the DOJ and DOT: (1) the in-
vestigation and prosecution of charges of dis-
crimination using the Office’s mediation and 
hearing processes (section 210(d) of the CAA) 
and (2) the biennial ADA inspection and re-
porting obligations (section 210(f) of the 
CAA). The current Board has determined 
that rules relating to these duties are best 
implemented by adopting and publishing 
amendments to the OCWR’s Procedural 
Rules. 
Procedural Summary: 
How are substantive regulations proposed 
and approved under the CAA? 
Section 304 of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. § 1384, sets 
forth the following procedure for proposing 
and approving such substantive regulations: 
(1) the Board of Directors proposes sub-
stantive regulations and publishes a general 
notice of proposed rulemaking in the Con-
gressional Record; 
(2) there be a comment period of at least 30 
days after the date of publication of the gen-
eral notice of proposed rulemaking; 
(3) after consideration of comments by the 
Board of Directors, the Board adopt regula-
tions and transmit notice of such action (to-
gether with the regulations and a rec-
ommendation regarding the method for con-
gressional approval of the regulations) to the 
Speaker of the House and President [P]ro 
[T]empore of the Senate for publication in 
the Congressional Record; 
(4) there be committee referral and action 
on the proposed regulations by resolution in 
each House, concurrent resolution, or by 
joint resolution; and 
(5) final publication of the approved regu-
lations in the Congressional Record, with an 
effective date prescribed in the final publica-
tion. 
For more detail, please reference the text 
of 2 U.S.C. § 1384. 
What is the approach taken by these pro-
posed substantive regulations? 
The Board will follow the procedures as 
enumerated above and as required by stat-
ute. This Notice of Proposed Rulemaking is 
step (1) of the outline set forth above. The 
Board will review any comments received 
under step (2) of the outline above, and re-
spond to the comments and make any 
changes necessary to ensure that the regula-
tions fully implement section 210 of the CAA 
and reflect the practices and policies par-
ticular to the legislative branch. Because the 
Board’s 2016 revised regulations were adopted 
pursuant to the CAA’s procedures for pro-
posing and approving substantive regula-
tions, including providing a comment period 
of 30 days after publication of the proposed 
amendments in the Congressional Record, 
the Board is not soliciting additional com-
ments on those adopted amendments at this 
time. 
Are there substantive differences in the pro-
posed regulations for the House of Rep-
resentatives, the Senate, and the other 
employing offices? 
No. The Board of Directors has identified 
no good cause for proposing different regula-
tions for these entities and accordingly has 
not done so. Therefore, if these regulations 
are approved as proposed, there will be one 
text applicable to all employing offices and 
covered employees. 
Are these proposed regulations also rec-
ommended by the OCWR’s Executive Di-
rector, the Deputy Executive Director for 
the Senate, and the Deputy Executive Di-
rector for the House of Representatives? 
As required by Section 304(b)(1) of the 
CAA, 2 U.S.C. § 1384(b)(1), the substance of 
these regulations is also recommended by 
the Executive Director, the Deputy Execu-
tive Director for the Senate, and the Deputy 
Executive Director for the House of Rep-
resentatives. 
Are these proposed substantive regulations 
available to persons with disabilities in 
an alternate format? 
This Notice of Proposed Regulations is 
available 
on 
the 
OCWR’s 
website, 
www.ocwr.gov, which is compliant with Sec-
tion 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 as 
amended, 29 U.S.C. § 794d. This Notice can 
also be made available in large print, Braille, 
or other alternative format. Requests for 
this Notice in an alternative format should 
be made to the Office of Congressional Work-
place Rights, 202–724–9250 (voice); 202–426–1913 
(fax); or adaaccess@ocwr.gov (e-mail). 
How long do I have to submit comments re-
garding the proposed regulations? 
Comments regarding the proposed regula-
tions of the OCWR set forth in this Notice 
are invited for a period of thirty (30) days 
following the date of the appearance of this 
Notice in the Congressional Record. 
How do I submit comments? 
Comments must be made in writing to the 
Acting Executive Director, Office of Congres-
sional Workplace Rights, via e-mail at 
rule-comments@ocwr.gov. 
Am I allowed to view copies of comments 
submitted by others? 
Yes. Copies of submitted comments will be 
available for review on the Office’s website 
at www.ocwr.gov. 
Section-by-Section Discussion of Proposed 
Changes to the ADA Regulations 
The following is a section-by-section dis-
cussion of the proposed revisions to the 
Board’s substantive ADA regulations that it 
adopted and submitted for publication in the 
Congressional Record on February 3, 2016. 162 
Cong. Rec. H557–565, S624–632 (daily ed. Feb-
ruary 3, 2016). 
As noted above, because Congress has not 
acted on the Board’s request for approval of 
its 2016 amendments, the Board will resub-
mit them for congressional approval when it 
submits its request for approval of these 
amendments. 
Because 
the 
Board’s 
2016 
amendments were adopted pursuant to the 
CAA’s procedures for proposing and approv-
ing substantive regulations, the Board is not 
soliciting additional comments on those 
adopted amendments at this time. 
Regulations proposed in Part 1. 
Changes have been made to reflect the en-
actment of the CAA Reform Act and ADA 
Amendments Act. Section 1.101(a), Purpose 
and scope, includes an updated list of cov-
ered entities in accordance with the Reform 
Act, and the reference to 2 U.S.C. § 1361(e)(1) 
reflects a reorganization of subsections by 
the Reform Act. Section 1.101(b) now ref-
erences two parts to the regulations, instead 
of three, as set forth in more detail below. 
Section 1.102 contains updated references to 
the CAA Reform Act and ADA Amendments 
Act. 
Regulations proposed in Part 2. 
Unlike the Board in 2016, the current Board 
has decided not to propose adoption of regu-
lations relating to the two unique statutory 
duties imposed by the CAA upon the General 
Counsel of the OCWR that are not imposed 
upon the DOJ and DOT: (1) the investigation 
and prosecution of charges of discrimination 
using the Office’s mediation and hearing 
processes (section 210(d) of the CAA) and (2) 
the biennial inspection and reporting obliga-
tions (section 210(f) of the CAA). The current 
Board has determined that rules relating to 
these duties are best implemented by adopt-
ing and publishing amendments to the 
OCWR’s Procedural Rules. In the 2016 adopt-
ed regulations, such regulations are des-
ignated as Parts 2 and 3. Part 1 of the 2016 
regulations, ‘‘Matters of General Applica-
bility to All Regulations Promulgated Under 
Section 210 of the Congressional Account-
ability Act of 1995,’’ includes a list of regula-
tions incorporated by reference (designated 
§ 1.105). The Board now proposes to move the 
list of regulations incorporated by reference 
to their own part, where the former § 1.105 
subsections have been re-numbered as sec-
tions within the new Part 2. 
In § 2.103, the Board has listed the specific 
DOJ regulations incorporated by reference 
into the regulations being issued under sec-
tion 210 of the CAA. 
These proposed regulations reflect the per-
tinent DOJ regulations that are in effect as 
of the date of the publication of this Notice. 
As such, they incorporate changes in the 
DOJ regulations that have been made since 
the Board last proposed regulations in 2014. 
These changes are as follows: 
1. On August 11, 2016, the DOJ published 
regulations incorporating the requirements 
of the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 (‘‘ADA 
Amendments Act’’) into the ADA Title II 
and Title III regulations, which took effect 
on October 11, 2016. Amendment of Ameri-
cans with Disabilities Act Title II and Title 
III Regulations to Implement ADA Amend-
ments Act of 2008, 81 FR 53204–01 (August 11, 
2016). Congress enacted the ADA Amend-
ments Act to clarify the meaning and inter-
pretation of the ADA definition of disability 
to ensure that the definition of disability 
would be broadly construed and applied with-
out extensive analysis. Changes made by this 
final rule that the Board has incorporated 
include: amendment of § 35.101, relating to 
the ADA’s purpose and broad coverage; 
§ 35.108, relating to the definition of dis-
ability; appendices that provide explanation 
and guidance pertaining to the final rule. 
2. A November 21, 2016 final rule revised 
the DOJ’s Title III regulation to further 
clarify a public accommodation’s obligation 
to provide appropriate auxiliary aids and 
services for people with disabilities. Non-
discrimination on the Basis of Disability by 
Public Accommodations—Movie Theaters; 
Movie Captioning and Audio Description, 81 
FR 87348–01 (December 2, 2016). Effective on 
January 17, 2017, the final rule codified long-
standing DOJ policies in this area, and in-
cludes provisions based on technological ad-
vances and breakthroughs in the area of aux-
iliary aids and services that have occurred 
since the 1991 Title III regulation was pub-
lished. As set forth below, the Board pro-
poses to adopt § 36.303, relating to auxiliary 
aids and services, which was revised by this 
final rule. 
The Board has adopted all of the DOJ regu-
lations implementing Titles II and III of the 
ADA with the exceptions detailed in the 2016 
Notice (162 Cong. Rec. H557–565, S624–632 
(daily ed. February 3, 2016)), plus the fol-
lowing revisions: 
1. Since the DOJ’s regulations imple-
menting Titles II and III of the ADA regulate 
public entities and public accommodations, 
respectively, several regulations are very 
similar across the titles, applying a similar 
or identical requirement to either a Title II- 
or a Title III-covered entity. Under the 
OCWR’s proposed § 1.102(c), ‘‘Covered entity 
and public entity include any of the entities 
listed in § 1.101(a) that provides public serv-
ices, programs, or activities, or operates a 
place of public accommodation within the 
meaning of Section 210 of the CAA. In the 
regulations implementing Title III, private 
entity includes covered entities.’’ Therefore, 
it is not necessary for the OCWR Board to 
adopt both a Title II and a Title III regula-
tion that are identical (or similar to the

point of being duplicative) except for the en-
tity they would apply to in a non-CAA con-
text. The Board will exclude the following 
sections from its substantive regulations on 
that basis: 35.103 (relating to the regulations’ 
relation to laws other than the ADA), 36.105 
(relating to the definition of disability), 
36.208 (relating to direct threat), 36.302(c) (re-
lating to service animals), and 36.302(f) (re-
lating to ticketing). 
2. The Board finds good cause to modify 
§ 35.107(a) to list the House and Senate sepa-
rately from other public entities and to re-
flect a slightly different requirement for 
them. In creating § 35.107, the DOJ wanted to 
ensure that individuals dealing with large 
agencies would be able to easily find a re-
sponsible person who is familiar with the 
ADA’s requirements and can communicate 
those requirements to other individuals in 
the agency who may be unaware of their re-
sponsibilities (often referred to as an ‘‘ADA 
coordinator’’). 
Nondiscrimination 
on 
the 
Basis of Disability in State and Local Gov-
ernment Services, 56 Fed. Reg. 35694–01 (July 
26, 1991). 
For purposes of section 210 of the CAA, the 
House and Senate are composed of a large 
number of separate entities (including each 
office of a Member and each committee). 2 
U.S.C. § 1331(a). The Board’s modification of 
§ 35.107 allows the House and the Senate to 
each designate one employee to coordinate 
ADA compliance responsibilities, helping to 
ensure that individuals can easily find and 
get assistance to effectuate their rights 
under the ADA as applied by the CAA with 
regard to the House and Senate. The House 
and Senate ADA coordinators may, under 
the regulation as modified, be employees of 
the Office of Congressional Accessibility 
Services, which already works to provide 
services for individuals with disabilities. 
The Board finds good cause not to incor-
porate the requirement at § 35.107(b) for enti-
ties to adopt their own grievance procedures, 
since the CAA specifies the available proce-
dures for violations of the ADA as applied by 
the CAA at 2 U.S.C. § 1331(d). Section 35.107 
will thus read, in its entirety, as detailed 
below. 
3. The Board proposes to adopt § 36.206, re-
lating to retaliation or coercion. While sec-
tion 207 (2 U.S.C. § 1317) of the CAA provides 
comprehensive retaliation protection for em-
ployees (including applicants and former em-
ployees) who may invoke their rights under 
section 210, section 207 does not apply to non-
employees who may enjoy rights and protec-
tions against discrimination under section 
210. Additionally, § 36.206 contains a list of il-
lustrations of prohibited conduct, which may 
be helpful to the Board. 
4. The Board finds good cause to modify 
§ 36.213, ‘‘Relationship of subpart B to sub-
parts C and D of this part.’’ This section ref-
erences subparts without specifying which 
regulations comprise those subparts—infor-
mation which is not conveyed in all formats. 
For example, the DOJ’s ADA website breaks 
the list of regulations into subparts, but a 
reader of the list of regulations incorporated 
by reference below does not see that same in-
formation. Therefore, the Board finds good 
cause to modify this provision by inserting 
references to the provisions contained within 
each subpart. Section 36.213 will thus read as 
detailed below. 
5. The Board proposes to adopt § 36.303, re-
lating to auxiliary aids and services. Revised 
in a 2016 final rule, it now includes provi-
sions based on technological advances and 
breakthroughs in the area of auxiliary aids 
and services that have occurred since the 
1991 Title III regulation was published. Non-
discrimination on the Basis of Disability by 
Public Accommodations—Movie Theaters; 
Movie Captioning and Audio Description, 81 
Fed. Reg. 87348 (December 2, 2016). These re-
visions were not made to the analogous Title 
II Regulation, § 35.160 General (Communica-
tions), so the Board has decided it is appro-
priate to propose adoption of both regula-
tions, even though they concern similar sub-
ject matter. 
In section 2.104, the Board has listed the 
specific DOT regulations incorporated into 
the regulations being issued under section 
210 of the CAA. 
These regulations reflect the pertinent 
DOJ regulations that are in effect as of the 
date of the publication of this Notice. As 
such, they incorporate changes in the DOT 
regulations that have been made since the 
Board last proposed regulations in 2014. Spe-
cifically, a DOT final rule effective July 13, 
2015 clarified that public transportation enti-
ties are required to make reasonable modi-
fications to their policies, practices, and pro-
cedures to avoid discrimination and ensure 
that their programs are accessible to indi-
viduals with disabilities. Transportation for 
Individuals with Disabilities; Reasonable 
Modification of Policies and Practices, 80 FR 
13253–01 (March 13, 2015). Changes made by 
this final rule that the Board has incor-
porated include: amendment to § 37.5, relat-
ing to nondiscrimination; § 37.169, relating to 
the process to be used by public entities pro-
viding designated public transportation serv-
ice in considering requests for reasonable 
modification; Appendix E to Part 37, which 
explains DOT’s interpretation of sections 
37.5(i) and 37.169 concerning reasonable modi-
fication requests. 
As noted earlier, the Board has adopted all 
of the DOT regulations implementing Titles 
II and III of the ADA with the exceptions de-
tailed in the 2016 Notice (162 Cong. Rec. H557– 
565, S624–632 (daily ed. February 3, 2016)), plus 
the following revision. Unlike the Board in 
2016, the current Board has decided not to 
propose adoption of subpart F (sections 37.121 
through 37.159) of the DOT’s regulations, re-
lating to paratransit as a complement to 
fixed route service. The current Board has 
determined that these regulations are unnec-
essary 
for 
CAA-covered 
transportation. 
Under the ADA, public entities operating 
fixed route transportation systems must pro-
vide comparable transportation services to 
people whose disabilities prevent their use of 
the fixed route system. Such ‘‘ADA com-
plementary paratransit’’ is subject to many 
requirements 
detailed 
in 
DOT’s 
imple-
menting regulations. DOT reasons, in Appen-
dix D to Part 37, that some types of fixed 
route systems are exempt from the require-
ment to provide ADA complementary para-
transit because of characteristics of these 
systems such as no attempt to comprehen-
sively cover a service area, limited route 
structure, limited origins and destinations, 
interface with another mode of transpor-
tation, and limited purposes of travel. Trans-
portation services subject to the CAA share 
many of these characteristics, and in any 
event must still comply with requirements 
governing accessible vehicles and accessible 
service, so the Board has determined that it 
is not necessary to adopt the ADA com-
plementary paratransit regulations.

§ 1.101 Purpose and scope. 
(a) CAA. Enacted into law on January 23, 
1995 and amended on December 21, 2018, the 
Congressional Accountability Act (‘‘CAA’’) 
in Section 210(b) provides that the rights and 
protections against discrimination in the 
provision of public services and accommoda-
tions established by sections 201 through 230, 
302, 303, and 309 of the Americans with Dis-
abilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. § § 12131 12150, 
12182, 12183, and 12189 (‘‘ADA’’), shall apply to 
the following entities: 
(1) each office of the Senate, including 
each office of a Senator and each committee; 
(2) each office of the House of Representa-
tives, including each office of a Member of 
the House of Representatives and each com-
mittee; 
(3) each joint committee of the Congress; 
(4) the Office of Congressional Accessi-
bility Services; 
(5) the United States Capitol Police; 
(6) the Congressional Budget Office; 
(7) the Office of the Architect of the Cap-
itol (including the Botanic Garden); 
(8) the Office of the Attending Physician; 
(9) the Office of Congressional Workplace 
Rights; and 
(10) the Library of Congress. 
Title II of the ADA prohibits discrimina-
tion on the basis of disability in the provi-
sion of public services, programs, activities 
by any ‘‘public entity.’’ Section 210(b)(2) of 
the CAA provides that for the purpose of ap-
plying Title II of the ADA the term ‘‘public 
entity’’ means any entity listed above that 
provides public services, programs, or activi-
ties. Title III of the ADA prohibits discrimi-
nation on the basis of disability by public ac-
commodations and requires places of public 
accommodation and commercial facilities to 
be designed, constructed, and altered in com-
pliance with accessibility standards. Section 
225(e) of the CAA provides that, ‘‘[e]xcept 
where inconsistent with definitions and ex-
emptions provided in [this Act], the defini-
tions and exemptions of the [ADA] shall 
apply under [this Act.]’’ 2 U.S.C. § 1361(e)(1). 
(b) Purpose and scope of regulations. The 
regulations set forth herein (Parts 1 and 2) 
are the substantive regulations that the 
Board of Directors of the Office of Congres-
sional Workplace Rights has promulgated 
pursuant to section 210(e) of the CAA. Part 1 
contains the general provisions applicable to 
all regulations under section 210 and the 
method of identifying entities responsible 
for correcting a violation of section 210. Part 
2 contains the list of executive branch regu-
lations incorporated by reference which de-
fine and clarify the prohibition against dis-
crimination on the basis of disability in the 
provision of public services and accommoda-
tions. 
§ 1.102 Definitions. 
Except as otherwise specifically provided 
in these regulations, as used in these regula-
tions: 
(a) Act or CAA means the Congressional 
Accountability Act of 1995, Pub. L. No. 104–1, 
amended by Congressional Accountability 
Act of 1995 Reform Act, Pub. L. No. 115–397.

(b) ADA or Americans with Disabilities Act 
means those sections of the Americans with 
Disabilities Act of 1990 as amended by the 
ADA Amendments Act of 2008 incorporated 
by reference into the CAA in section 210: 42 
U.S.C. § § 12131–12150, 12182, 12183, and 12189. 
(c) Covered entity and public entity include 
any of the entities listed in § 1.101(a) that 
provides public services, programs, or activi-
ties, or operates a place of public accommo-
dation within the meaning of section 210 of 
the CAA. In the regulations implementing 
Title III, private entity includes covered en-
tities. 
(d) Board means the Board of Directors of 
the 
Office 
of 
Congressional 
Workplace 
Rights. 
(e) Office means the Office of Congressional 
Workplace Rights. 
(f) General Counsel means the General 
Counsel of the Office of Congressional Work-
place Rights. 
§ 1.103 Authority of the Board. 
Pursuant to sections 210 and 304 of the 
CAA, the Board is authorized to issue regula-
tions to implement the rights and protec-
tions against discrimination on the basis of 
disability in the provision of public services 
and accommodations under the ADA. Sec-
tion 210(e) of the CAA directs the Board to 
promulgate regulations implementing sec-
tion 210 that are ‘‘the same as substantive 
regulations promulgated by the Attorney 
General and the Secretary of Transportation 
to implement the statutory provisions re-
ferred to in subsection (b) except to the ex-
tent that the Board may determine, for good 
cause shown and stated together with the 
regulation, that a modification of such regu-
lations would be more effective for the im-
plementation of the rights and protections 
under this section.’’ 2 U.S.C. § 1331(e). Specifi-
cally, it is the Board’s considered judgment, 
based on the information available to it at 
the time of promulgation of these regula-
tions, that, with the exception of the regula-
tions adopted and set forth herein, there are 
no other ‘‘substantive regulations promul-
gated by the Attorney General and the Sec-
retary of Transportation to implement the 
statutory provisions referred to in sub-
section (b) [of Section 210 of the CAA]’’ that 
need be adopted. 
In promulgating these regulations, the 
Board has made certain technical and no-
menclature changes to the regulations as 
promulgated by the Attorney General and 
the 
Secretary 
of 
Transportation. 
Such 
changes are intended to make the provisions 
adopted accord more naturally to situations 
in the legislative branch. However, by mak-
ing these changes, the Board does not intend 
a substantive difference between these regu-
lations and those of the Attorney General 
and/or the Secretary of Transportation from 
which they are derived. Moreover, such 
changes, in and of themselves, are not in-
tended to constitute an interpretation of the 
regulations or of the statutory provisions of 
the CAA upon which they are based. 
§ 1.104 Method for identifying the entity re-
sponsible for correction of violations of 
section 210. 
(a) Purpose and scope. Section 210(e)(3) of 
the CAA provides that regulations under sec-
tion 210(e) include a method of identifying, 
for purposes of section 210 of the CAA and for 
categories of violations of section 210(b), the 
entity responsible for correcting a particular 
violation. This section sets forth the method 
for identifying responsible entities for the 
purpose of allocating responsibility for cor-
recting violations of section 210(b). 
(b) Violations. A covered entity may violate 
section 210(b) if it discriminates against a 
qualified individual with a disability within 
the meaning of Title II or Title III of the 
ADA. 
(c) Entities Responsible for Correcting Viola-
tions. Correction of a violation of the rights 
and protections against discrimination is the 
responsibility of the entities listed in sub-
section (a) of section 210 of the CAA that 
provide the specific public service, program, 
activity, or accommodation that forms the 
basis for the particular violation of Title II 
or Title III rights and protections and, when 
the violation involves a physical access bar-
rier, the entities responsible for designing, 
maintaining, managing, altering, or con-
structing the facility in which the specific 
public service program, activity, or accom-
modation is conducted or provided. 
(d) Allocation of Responsibility for Correction 
of Title II and/or Title III Violations. Where 
more than one covered entity is found to be 
an entity responsible for correction of a vio-
lation of Title II and/or Title III rights and 
protections under the method set forth in 
this section, as between those parties, allo-
cation of responsibility for correcting the 
violations of the ADA may be determined by 
statute, contract, or other enforceable ar-
rangement or relationship.

or toilet facilities (as defined in 28 C.F.R. 
Parts 35 and 36) would threaten or destroy 
the historic significance of the property, 
building, or facility, the exceptions for alter-

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader is recog-
nized. 
CHIPS ACT OF 2022 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, this 
morning—this 
morning—the 
Senate 
will draw a clear line in the sand that 
America’s chip crisis and America’s 
dwindling commitment to science and 
innovation will not continue under our 
watch. Within the next hour, the Sen-
ate will vote, finally—finally—to move 
toward final passage of our CHIPS and 
Science bill. That is what we are call-
ing it, the CHIPS and Science bill. 
That will put us in a position to finish 
the work on this bill before the end of 
the week. It is a major step for our eco-
nomic security, our national security, 
our supply chains, and, in fact, for 
America’s future—for America’s fu-
ture. 
I want to be clear. The proposal we 
are passing this week contains the ma-
jority of key science and innovation 
measures that the Senate passed last 
summer. It will make historic invest-
ments to scientific research. It will 
take direct aim at our Nation’s chip 
crisis. Alongside the infrastructure law 
and our recent gun safety bill, among 
others, it is one of the most consequen-
tial bipartisan achievements of this 
Congress. I thank all of my Senate col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle who 
are helping to make this happen. 
I am confident that future genera-
tions will look back on the passage of 
this CHIPS and Science bill as a turn-
ing point for American leadership in 
the 21st century, but it didn’t come to-
gether overnight. The legislation has 
been several years in the making. 
In 2019, I approached my Republican 
colleague TODD YOUNG with a proposal

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3662 
July 26, 2022 
to work together on legislation to re-
vive America’s commitment to science 
and innovation. Together, we drafted 
the first iteration of many policies we 
are passing this week, the Endless 
Frontier Act. 
A year later, I joined with my col-
leagues Senators CORNYN and WARNER 
to push for the authorization of new 
Federal chips initiatives as part of the 
NDAA to address our Nation’s growing 
chip shortage. 
We all knew that America faced a 
choice: We could keep underfunding 
science and innovation and continue to 
let America fall behind our global com-
petitors, or we could wake up to the 
challenges of this century and empower 
the American people to unleash the 
next wave of discovery and scientific 
achievement. We knew that if we didn’t 
get there first, our rivals—chief among 
them the Chinese Communist Party— 
would likely beat us to the punch and 
reshape the world in their authori-
tarian image. 
In February of 2021, less than a 
month after I became majority leader, 
I directed the chairs and members of 
our relevant committees to start draft-
ing 
a 
legislative 
package 
to 
outcompete China and create new 
American jobs, with the Endless Fron-
tier Act serving as the core of this ef-
fort. I also instructed them to draft 
legislation to rebuild the capacity of 
the U.S. semiconductor industry. The 
pandemic made clear with unforgiving 
clarity how America’s chip shortage 
was creating a crisis in our economy 
and national security. 
So Members on both sides of the 
aisle—this has been a bipartisan effort 
from the get-go—got to work. We made 
a commitment last February that if 
both sides worked together, we would 
bring a bill to the floor for a vote in 
the spring. And that is what we did, 
and we passed the U.S. Innovation and 
Competition Act with overwhelming 
bipartisan support in June of 2021. 
A year later, the legislation we are 
passing this week has many of the 
same important measures contained in 
the bill we worked on last summer. For 
example, last year’s bill secured his-
toric investments for science and inno-
vation. This bill does too. 
Last year’s bill offered tens of bil-
lions to encourage American chip man-
ufacturing and R&D. This bill does 
that too and even more with the in-
vestment tax credit provisions. 
Last year’s bill provided funding to 
help build a wireless communications 
supply chain to counter Huawei. This 
bill does too. 
Last year’s bill created the National 
Science Foundation tech directorate 
and provided funding to the Depart-
ment of Energy National Labs to help 
compete with foreign rivals in key 
technologies like AI and quantum com-
puting. This bill does too. 
Last year’s bill made major new in-
vestments in Manufacturing USA and 
the Manufacturing Extension Partner-
ship to strengthen domestic supply 
chains. This bill does too. 
Last year’s bill created the first-ever 
program to cultivate the tech hubs of 
tomorrow in regions around the United 
States that have enormous potential 
but have largely been overlooked—not 
the big megalopolises which have a lot 
of tech in them, like New York City 
and San Francisco, but smaller regions 
that have great talent but have been 
overlooked. They might be in Upstate 
New York. They might be in Indiana 
and many other parts of the country. 
This bill is making sure that happens. 
Now, let me be clear. While this bill 
contains the two major components of 
the Science and CHIPS bill, there are 
other major proposals from both sides 
that are still being worked on in the 
conference committee. Make no mis-
take that there are many Democrats 
and Republicans who have provisions 
that will be contained in the con-
ference report under Chair CANTWELL’s 
leadership, and it is my intention to 
put the conference committee bill on 
the floor of the Senate. 
As I said a moment ago, I firmly be-
lieve that passing this bill will be a 
turning point for American leadership 
in this century. The benefits of this 
legislation will reverberate across the 
country for years and decades to come. 
For much of the 20th century, Amer-
ica was without peer in our commit-
ment to scientific research, to innova-
tion, and to new, cutting-edge manu-
facturing, and it led to tens of millions 
of good-paying jobs and made the 
United States the unquestioned eco-
nomic leader of the world. 
Today, the story is different. Nations 
around the world are spending tens of 
billions of dollars to secure this cen-
tury, much like America secured the 
last one. Sadly, the Federal Govern-
ment’s commitment to science has 
waned in recent decades. In fact, as a 
percentage of GDP, we spend less than 
half as much as the Chinese Com-
munist Party on basic research—less 
than half—which is even more dev-
astating given China has spent decades 
stealing America’s intellectual prop-
erty. 
With this bill, that is finally going to 
change. We will not only create the 
good-paying jobs of tomorrow; we will 
not only fix our supply chains and 
bring costs down for American families 
with this bill; with this bill, we will re-
awaken the spirit of discovery, innova-
tion, invention, and optimism that 
made America the envy of the world. 
We don’t mean to let the days of 
American leadership end on our watch. 
We don’t mean to see America become 
a middling nation in this century. We 
mean for America to lead this century. 
For that reason, I urge my colleagues 
to give a resounding vote ‘‘yes’’ on clo-
ture at 11 a.m. today. 
PACT ACT 
Mr. President, now on the PACT Act, 
last night, I filed cloture to prepare the 
Senate to once again pass the PACT 
Act, the largest and most important 
expansion of veteran healthcare bene-
fits in decades and a bipartisan issue to 
the core—another bipartisan issue. 
As my colleagues already know, be-
cause of a technical error, the House of 
Representatives was unable to take up 
our version of the bill that we passed in 
the spring. The House has now fixed 
their error and returned the PACT Act 
back to the Senate. We want to finish 
our work on the PACT Act before the 
end of the week. 
Our Nation’s veterans have waited 
long enough to get the benefits they 
need to treat complications from toxic 
exposure in the line of duty. So we 
have every reason in the world to get 
this bill done quickly, with the same 
bipartisan support as the first time 
around. 
The need for the PACT Act is beyond 
question. Burn pits have affected up to 
31⁄2 million veterans since 9/11. Yet the 
VA has rejected nearly 80 percent of all 
disability claims connected to burn 
pits. That is unacceptable and must 
change. 
I hope Members work together to 
fast-track this bill as soon as possible 
because there is no reason to delay a 
measure that the vast majority of Sen-
ators from both parties agree is nec-
essary. Our veterans, their families, 
and our veterans service organizations 
have been urging us to finish work on 
this bill. Let’s keep our promise to 
those valiant servicemembers and send 
the PACT Act quickly to the Presi-
dent’s desk. 
I yield the floor.

July 26, 2022 
still financially; 63 percent say that 
gas prices, inflation, bills, or the econ-
omy are their biggest concerns. That is 
because 100 percent of the American 
people live in a country experiencing 
the worst inflation in more than 40 
years, and 100 percent of the American 
people live in a country where things 
did not have to be this bad but for 
Democrats’ deliberate policy choices. 
Don’t take it from me. Listen to 
Larry Summers, Treasury Secretary to 
President Clinton and NEC Director to 
President Obama. Here is what Larry 
Summers had to say: 
There wouldn’t have been nearly the same 
kinds of supply chain problems . . . if we 
weren’t giving people who were laid off un-
employment insurance that was far more 
than the salaries they had been earning . . . 
if we weren’t mailing checks willy-nilly . . . 
there would have been less spending, that 
would have meant less bottlenecks. 
He continued: 
Printing money and distributing it well 
ahead of the supply of goods is a prescription 
for inflation—and that’s what we did. We in-
jected enough money into the economy to 
make total spending grow at an 11.6 percent 
rate last year. When you have 11.6 percent 
growth rate in spending, then on any reason-
able theory of how much capacity there is, 
you’re going to have a lot of inflation. And 
that’s what we did. 
That is a top Democrat talking, but 
he is intellectually honest. He tried to 
advise Washington Democrats not to 
dump nearly $2 trillion onto the econ-
omy, but, of course, they didn’t listen. 
And now working families are stuck 
with skyrocketing costs and bills as a 
consequence. 
You would think the worst inflation 
in 40 years would be enough to con-
vince Democrats to stop running these 
painful experiments on American fami-
lies. But, if you can believe it, almost 
every House and Senate Democrat 
would like to follow up this historic in-
flation with massive new tax hikes. 
The same people who spent us into in-
flation want to tax us all the way into 
recession. 
So let’s hope this small handful of 
Democrats who see the insanity of this 
approach continue to stand strong for 
our country. 
UKRAINE 
Mr. President, on an entirely dif-
ferent 
matter, 
this 
past 
Saturday 
brought yet another escalation in Rus-
sia’s brutal war in Ukraine. The ink 
had barely dried on a deal securing safe 
passage for Ukrainian grain exports 
when Russian missiles hit the port city 
of Odesa. 
Ukraine produces one-fifth of the 
world’s 
high-grade 
wheat. 
Russia’s 
Black Sea blockade and the destruc-
tion of Ukraine’s crops have left vul-
nerable regions of the world literally 
on the verge of crisis. But Vladimir 
Putin only managed to resist the urge 
to commit senseless violence for about 
24 hours. 
Now, the fact that Putin was even 
compelled to negotiate was thanks to 
the introduction of HIMARS long- 
range rockets and Harpoon anti-ship 
missiles into Ukraine’s arsenal. If 
Ukraine had had weapons like these 
earlier, the blockade of Odesa could 
have been prevented in the first place. 
The Biden administration says its de-
cision making throughout the process 
has been deliberate and nuanced. His-
tory will likely judge otherwise. The 
months before Putin’s escalation clear-
ly called for boldness and resolve, to 
say nothing of the months since. But, 
too often, the administration’s first in-
stincts have been to plot along slowly 
and vacillate. 
The Ukrainians have fought bravely 
to stop Russia’s advance despite being 
undermanned 
and 
outgunned. 
Just 
think what they could have accom-
plished if the West had acted boldly to 
support Ukraine as storm clouds were 
first gathering, or right away when the 
storm broke. 
But, now, no one should need a re-
minder of the far-reaching impacts of 
the war in Ukraine. Our eastern flank 
allies certainly don’t. They have been 
preparing to defend themselves lit-
erally for generations, and from the be-
ginning of Russia’s latest offensive, 
they have reached deep into their own 
inventories to help equip Ukraine. 
Elsewhere in Europe, treaty allies 
have finally taken an important lesson 
about investing in deterrence and self- 
defense to heart. Countries like Ger-
many have made historic commit-
ments to increase military spending. 
The Germans, Swedes, and others have 
also broken historic precedent to share 
their stockpiles with Ukraine. 
And, of course, Russia’s war has led 
other major European states to an-
nounce their intention to join the 
ranks of the strongest alliance in world 
history. Last week, our colleagues on 
the Foreign Relations Committee ad-
vanced the necessary protocols to rat-
ify Sweden and Finland’s accession to 
NATO. There is now nothing pre-
venting the Democratic leader from 
calling these measures up for imme-
diate consideration and passage by the 
full Senate. The legislatures of other 
NATO allies like Canada, Norway, Po-
land, and Germany have already rati-
fied them. 
The United States would be fortunate 
to have two new treaty allies as im-
pressive and capable as Finland and 
Sweden. 
Both 
countries’ 
high-tech 
economies and extensive American- 
made systems will improve the alli-
ance’s interoperability and instantly 
improve the state of burden-sharing 
the day they come in. 
American leadership in the world has 
made possible the peace and security 
our country enjoys today. That leader-
ship is helping encourage our allies to 
make sufficient investments in their 
own capabilities to face down the 
shared threats, but American leader-
ship is only as strong as our willing-
ness to make robust investments in our 
own capabilities. 
President Biden has submitted a de-
fense budget request that fails to keep 
pace with growing threats and fails to 
keep pace with Democrats’ own infla-
tion, and Senate Democrats are giving 
short shrift to the need for a strong, bi-
partisan Defense authorization bill. 
Russian aggression isn’t the only 
threat to American interests today. 
Rogue states like Iran and North Korea 
continue to march toward devastating 
weapons. China’s provocative behavior 
in the Indo-Pacific continues to raise 
the stakes for long-term competition. 
So there is no time—no time—to 
waste on either of these measures—nei-
ther the Sweden and Finland protocols

UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT—H.R. 1892 
Ms. ROSEN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that if the Senate 
receives a message from the House that 
it has passed H.R. 1842, and if the text 
of that bill is identical to S. 697, that 
the bill be considered read three times 
and the Senate vote on passage of the 
bill without intervening action or de-
bate, and that the motion to reconsider 
be considered made and laid upon the 
table. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
CHIPS ACT OF 2022 
Ms. 
ROSEN. 
Mr. 
President, 
for 
months, our country has experienced a 
severe computer chip shortage, one 
that has impacted nearly every Amer-
ican industry and increased costs for 
nearly every American. From cell 
phones to cars to televisions, even our 
refrigerators and washing machines— 
products we use every day—well, they 
need computer chips to function. 
They are also used in critically im-
portant technology like the medical 
equipment at our hospitals and the 
technology used by our military. This 
is why the computer chip shortage we 
are facing is a critical economic and 
national security issue. It has caused 
prices to rise, contributed to supply 
chain issues, and limited the avail-
ability of many products, something 
that anyone who has tried to buy or 
rent a car over the past couple of years 
knows all too well. 
This shortage was directly impacting 
hard-working families and the busi-
nesses that support jobs across our Na-
tion. 
It has hurt companies that employ 
people in my State of Nevada, like 
Varian Medical Systems, which uses 
computer chips to manufacture cancer- 
fighting and other critical medical 
technologies. This shortage is impact-
ing lives and likelihoods. 
For decades, America was a global 
leader in manufacturing and innova-
tion; but over the years, we outsourced 
the production of computer chips to 
countries like China, costing us mil-
lions of potential American jobs and 
increasing our reliance on foreign na-
tions for technology that is critical— 
critical for our national security and

for our safety. All of this has been ex-
acerbated by a global pandemic and the 
war in Ukraine. 
We can’t afford to wait any longer to 
bring manufacturing of computer chips 
back to the United States. The Senate 
will be voting on bipartisan legislation 
to bring computer chip manufacturing 
back to the U.S. and help existing man-
ufacturers compete, creating thousands 
of new American jobs and enhancing 
both our economic and our national se-
curity. 
We will also improve our supply 
chain, which will help businesses like 
Varian Medical Systems, and it will 
minimize the supply chain disruptions 
which will ultimately help lower prices 
for consumers. This bill will do so 
much more to spur innovation and in-
vest in our American economy. 
As the first and only former com-
puter programmer to serve in the U.S. 
Senate, I am so excited about what this 
legislation will do for the future of 
American technology and innovation. 
It will establish a first-of-its-kind ef-
fort to accelerate our development of 
critical technologies, like artificial in-
telligence, quantum computing, and 
advanced manufacturing. We will in-
vest heavily in STEM education and in 
our cybersecurity workforce. And it 
will help build regional technology 
hubs all across this country to spark 
innovation. 
I am also so proud that this bill in-
cludes bipartisan provisions that I 
worked on in the committee that wrote 
the bulk of the legislation, which in-
cludes these: my bipartisan Rural 
STEM Education Act with Senator 
WICKER to increase access to quality 
STEM education for rural schools so it 
is accessible to all of our students no 
matter where they live. It also includes 
provisions I worked on with Senator 
BLACKBURN to support advanced manu-
facturing workforce development and a 
bipartisan amendment I introduced 
with Senator LUMMIS to develop a se-
cure and reliable critical mineral sup-
ply chain. 
This historic bipartisan legislation is 
just common sense. So let’s build up 
our 
communities; 
let’s 
strengthen 
America’s competitiveness; let’s invest 
in American innovation; let’s lower 
prices for hard-working families; and 
let’s bolster our domestic supply chain. 
Let’s pass this critical piece of legisla-
tion now. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican whip. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that I be able to 
speak for up to 15 minutes prior to the 
scheduled rollcall vote. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
INFLATION 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, ‘‘our ex-
perts believe and the data shows that 
most of the price increases we’ve seen 
. . . [are] expected to be temporary’’— 
that is what President Biden said 1 
year ago this month, something his ad-
ministration has repeatedly echoed. 
Unfortunately, it long ago became 
clear that was wishful thinking on the 
President’s part. Far from being tem-
porary, inflation has become a fact of 
life in the Biden economy. 
Last month, inflation hit its highest 
level yet under President Biden, climb-
ing to 9.1 percent, the worst inflation 
in more than 40 years. The impact of 
inflation is being felt in every corner of 
our economy. Businesses of every size 
are dealing with the effects of infla-
tion. Small businesses, of course, are 
being hit particularly hard. And 75 per-
cent of small business owners report 
inflation has had a negative effect on 
the financial health of their business 
over the past 6 months. And 75 percent 
report that inflation pressures are get-
ting worse. 
It is not surprising. Everything from 
inputs to transportation to electricity 
has become more expensive in the 
Biden economy, and that has a huge 
impact on businesses’ ability to pay 
their expenses and run their oper-
ations. 
As one South Dakota business owner 
who wrote to me noted: 
It makes it hard for me to grow my USA- 
made business when I don’t have the funds to 
pay my employees more, add more benefits, 
purchase more machinery, and buy more ma-
terial in buck as inflation continues to rise. 
Farmers and ranchers in my State 
are also struggling. As of March, the 
price of fertilizer had risen to an as-
tounding 162 percent since January 
2021. The prices of two common herbi-
cides have risen more than 50 percent 
since last year. And the price of diesel, 
which powers a lot of farming and 
ranching equipment, has doubled since 
President Biden took office. Farming 
and ranching are tough jobs already, 
often with tight margins and a lot of 
weather-related 
risks. 
Inflation 
is 
making things exponentially hard. 
The list of inflation’s impacts goes 
on. For example, last week I talked 
about how inflation is affecting our 
military, which is able to do less with 
the funds appropriated for it, thanks to 
soaring prices across the economy. 
That, in turn, can affect troop readi-
ness and the military’s ability to keep 
up with needed programs and purchases 
from weapons to vehicles to aircraft, 
and ships. 
Of course, I haven’t even yet men-
tioned the most basic impact of infla-
tion and that is the misery faced by 
hard-working Americans who confront 
sky-high prices at the grocery store 
and the gas pump and wonder how they 
are going to feed their family this 
month or whether they will be able to 
afford to get to work. 
Bloomberg reported last week that 
nearly 6 in 10 American workers are 
concerned that their paychecks won’t 
stretch far enough to support them-
selves and their families. Another re-
cent poll reported that 70 percent of 
Americans have had to cut back on 
other spending to afford necessities. 
Life in the Biden economy is grim. 
At this point, how we got here is well- 
established. One of the main reasons 
we are in the midst of this inflation 
crisis is Democrats’ decision to pass a 
massive partisan $1.9 trillion spending 
bill last March under the guise of 
COVID relief, despite the fact that Con-
gress had just passed a fifth bipartisan 
COVID bill that met essentially all 
current pressing COVID needs. Demo-
crats were warned that their bill would 
cause inflation; and they proceeded 
anyway. The so-called American Res-
cue Plan flooded the economy with un-
necessary government money, and the 
economy overheated as a result. 
So here we are with Americans strug-
gling under the weight of the worst in-
flation in 40 years, and Democrats 
want to double down on the spending 
strategy that helped get us into this 
mess in the first place. That is right. 
Despite the fact that even Democrat 
economists have stated that the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan helped create our cur-
rent inflation crisis, Democrats want 
to pass another massive government 
spending bill filled with excessive 
spending and tax hikes—a trillion dol-
lars in tax hikes in recent discussions. 
Apparently, Democrats are not con-
tent with spending us into an inflation 
crisis, they would also like to tax us 
into a recession. There is already rea-
son to worry about the negative eco-
nomic impacts of new climate meas-
ures the President is contemplating 
imposing, but on top of that, Demo-
crats want to spend even more govern-
ment money and impose a trillion dol-
lars in tax hikes, a substantial part of 
which would fall on small businesses. 
At this rate, there is no telling when 
our inflation crisis will end. Democrats 
are so committed to big spending that 
even if their legislation fails this time 
around, they are already planning to 
run on their big spending agenda in No-
vember. 
I am not sure I would want to try to 
convince voters to elect me by touting 
the same spending strategy that helped 
land our country in this inflation crisis 
in the first place. But Democrats’ be-
lief in big spending is so deeply in-
grained that it apparently can’t be 
swayed even when they see the nega-
tive consequences. 
It is incomprehensible that Demo-
crats are contemplating doubling down 
on the spending strategy that helped 
get us in this mess in the first place. 
The first spending spree has been a dis-
aster for our country, and I can only 
imagine how much Americans would 
suffer from their next one. 
I yield the floor.

ENERGY 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to talk about 
the Biden energy crisis that is affect-
ing our country. 
Now, Joe Biden has been threatening 
to declare a climate emergency. Demo-
crats from New England, Members of 
this body, have been practically beg-
ging him to do so. They actually went 
to Massachusetts with him last week 
to try to twist his arm. 
Democrats say this would give Joe 
Biden even more legal authority to re-
strict American energy. So that is 
what the Democrats want these days: 
less American energy—more expensive 
American energy, less American en-
ergy, and more power for Joe Biden. 
Well, I have got bad news for the 
Democrats. The Supreme Court has 
ruled very recently, less than a month 
ago, that energy regulation requires 
‘‘clear congressional authorization.’’ 
Congress writes the laws. It is the 
President who is just supposed to carry 
out the laws that are written by Con-
gress. The President doesn’t have the 
authority to just do whatever he wants 
by saying we have a climate crisis and 
then calling it an emergency. But 
Democrats are far too eager to give 
more and more of the Senate’s power 
to the least popular President in the 
last 70 years. 
Democrats say we have a crisis right 
now. Well, they are right about the 
fact that we have a crisis. We have a 
lot of crises in this country, and they 
are crises because of Joe Biden and be-
cause of the Democrats and the policies 
of this administration. We have an en-
ergy crisis. We have an inflation crisis. 
We have a crisis at the southern bor-
der. We have a crisis of crime in the 
cities. And as we come to the end of an-
other month, millions of families are 
facing a crisis at home trying to pay 
their bills. The result is that Demo-
crats have a crisis too. It is a crisis in 
the White House and in the party, a 
crisis of competence and a crisis of 
credibility. 
Two-thirds of Americans say that 
this President and the Democrats are 
focusing on the wrong things. There 
was a poll last week in the New York 
Times. It showed that only 1 percent of 
Americans—1 
percent—say 
climate 
change is their No. 1 priority. Now, 
that is of all people. What about Demo-
crats? Only 3 percent of Democrats say 
that the idea of what the President is 
focusing on and trying to declare an 
emergency on, a national emergency— 
only 3 percent of Democrats say it is 
their top priority. What about the 
young people, the people who the 
Democrats always say: We appeal to 
the young people? Only 3 percent of 
people under the age of 30, voters under 
the age of 30, say that climate is their 
No. 1 concern. 
The numbers are astonishing, and the 
President continues to ignore it. Work-
ing families aren’t thinking about 
what the White House is calling the 
liberal world order, which is why the 
President wants to declare a climate 
crisis. Working families are trying to 
balance their checkbooks, trying to 
make it to the end of the month with 
some money left over to pay the bills. 
People say: What do families want? I 
know, in my home State of Wyoming, I 
talk to families at the grocery on Sun-
day, traveling the State Saturday. We 
had folks all around the State coming 
together for Frontier Days in Chey-
enne. People want to be able to pay for 
a full tank of gas. They want to be able 
to go to the grocery store and buy gro-
ceries for a week. And they want to 
have money left over at the end of the 
month—and the end of the month is 
coming—to pay their bills. That is all 
they are asking. Under this adminis-
tration, they have been falling further 
and further behind, and it is becoming 
almost impossible to do those three 
simple things. 
A survey from Bloomberg last week 
found that 60 percent of workers say 
they are worried that they can’t sup-
port their family. They were doing it 
beforehand, but they can’t do it now.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3666 
July 26, 2022 
You read stories of people losing sleep 
over the economy and their own finan-
cial well-being—or not-so-well-being. 
People are putting off their dreams; 
they are giving up on their dreams and 
their hopes for themselves and their 
kids. The Joint Tax Committee has 
looked into this and said the average 
American family has already paid 
$1,500 extra for energy under Joe Biden 
as President. People are paying about 
$100 a week extra, more than they were 
when Joe Biden came into office, just 
to buy the things that they were buy-
ing last year. 
So now here we are about halfway 
through this year, and it is really add-
ing up. As a result, the savings rate is 
the lowest it has been since the great 
recession in 2009. No wonder consumer 
confidence has dropped again. The 
numbers are out this morning, and you 
look at the headlines. Here is one. It 
says, in July, consumer confidence 
slipped for the third month in a row, 
nearing pandemic lows. It goes on to 
say confidence is down 24 percent since 
last July. Inflation continues to bite. 
Inflation continues to bite. 
That is why credit card debt is at a 
record high. This year, American peo-
ple have opened millions of new credit 
card accounts just to pay for the daily 
issues of life struggles. 
So my question is: Who are the 3 per-
cent of Democrats who think climate 
change is their top priority? I know 
some are Members of this body. Well, 
they all seem to work here in Wash-
ington. 
One of them is John Kerry, clearly. 
Last week, we found out that John 
Kerry—who I think is a climate czar or 
whatever his title is at the White 
House—has now taken 48 official trips 
on a private jet, his private jet as Joe 
Biden’s climate czar. In total, those 48 
trips have put 325 metric tons of carbon 
into the atmosphere. 
Thank you, John Kerry. You know 
better than we do, though. 
Now, this is what a vehicle would 
emit in 20 years. So John Kerry is fly-
ing around lecturing the rest of us 
from his position of smug superiority, 
and he emits more carbon and a lot 
more hot air than almost anyone on 
the face of the Earth. 
If Democrats cared about our cli-
mate, they would tell John Kerry to 
park the plane and go home to one of 
your mansions. Even for Democrats, 
the hypocrisy is astonishing. 
What about another one of these peo-
ple who are focused on such a small 
amount of the 3 percent as well? How 
about Pete Buttigieg, Secretary of 
Transportation, 
Mayor 
Pete? 
Last 
week, he said this: 
The more pain that we are all experiencing 
from the high price of gas, the more benefit 
there is— 
The more pain you are suffering, men 
and women and families all around 
America, the more benefit there is— 
for those who can access electric vehicles. 
How tone deaf. And this guy wants to 
be President. I would remind Mayor 
Pete that the wealthy who can afford 
electric vehicles will be just fine; it is 
everybody else who is suffering right 
now. Mayor Pete seems to think pain 
at the pump is a good thing for Amer-
ica—not the America that I live in, not 
the America that the people of Wyo-
ming live in. The great majority of the 
American people don’t feel that pain at 
the pump is a good thing, but probably 
a number of Members of this Senate 
body do. 
Mayor Pete seems to like these high 
prices. He testified before the House 
last week and was asked about the cost 
of electric vehicles. Well, the average 
cost of electric vehicles is about 
$55,000. Oh, the price of electric vehi-
cles, you may have noted, Mr. Presi-
dent, is up 18 percent this year due to 
Joe Biden inflation. Inflation is hitting 
everything and everyone. Even the 
electric vehicles are much more expen-
sive now. 
Does Mayor Pete think people have 
that kind of money sitting around? Do 
Members of this body, the Democrats, 
think that people have that kind of 
money available? People can’t afford to 
eat. They can’t afford to drive their 
cars. They can’t afford to buy a full 
tank of gasoline. 
PBS ran a story last week about sen-
ior citizens moving in together. Why? 
Because they couldn’t afford their rent 
expenses. That is what people are expe-
riencing under Joe Biden’s Presidency. 
And where does Mayor Pete think 
electricity comes from? He was a 
mayor; he should know. Right now in 
Texas, people with electric vehicles are 
being told not to plug in their electric 
vehicles between 3 p.m. and 8 p.m. 
Don’t plug them in. Well, why? To 
avoid overtaxing the grid, to avoid a 
brownout in communities. 
This is at a point where you don’t 
have that many electric vehicles in the 
economy and in the country. What if 
Biden got his way and more and more 
people were driving electric vehicles? 
We would have a blackout every day in 
the Joe Biden economy. 
Now, electric vehicles can take hours 
and hours and hours to fully charge. 
Not everybody can wait that long. Not 
everybody has a job where they can 
email it in. A lot of people have to 
show up in person. They certainly have 
to in Wyoming. They have to work 
with their hands. 
There is still a big gap in this coun-
try between renewable energy and reli-
able energy, and we need reliable en-
ergy. We need it all. Two-thirds of our 
energy grid still comes from tradi-
tional forms of energy. 
Higher cost for energy? What does it 
mean? It means higher costs for every-
thing else. And that is what people are 
seeing all around the country in Joe 
Biden’s economy. For 15 months in a 
row now, prices have gone up faster 
than wages. So for 15 months in a row— 
that means for each of those months, 
people can afford less than they could 
the month before. Right now for the 
American people, as you saw from the 
consumer confidence numbers that are 
out today, there is no end in sight. 
Later this week, we are going to find 
out a couple of things about the econ-
omy. Tomorrow, we are going to find 
out how much the Federal Reserve is 
going to raise rates. In the last 4 
months, we have seen the largest in-
crease in 40 years, and they are likely 
to go up again this week. Mortgage 
rates have doubled in the last 7 
months. 
Why is the Federal Reserve doing 
this? Well, they are taking desperate 
measures to try to fix the inflation 
that Joe Biden and the Democrats have 
forced onto the country. If there had 
been 
no 
inflation 
crisis, 
the 
Fed 
wouldn’t be raising rates like this. So 
the blame for the rate increase is not 
on the Fed; it is on the Democrats. 
They are the ones whose policies—the 
Democrats in this body and the Demo-
crats in the White House and the 
Democrats in the House—made the 
rate hikes necessary. The Federal Re-
serve is just trying to throw on the 
emergency brake because of inflation. 
Joe Biden—and his spending, and he 
wants to spend more—is the guy who is 
fueling the inflation in a car that we 
just cannot afford to see crash. On 
Thursday, we are going to find out if 
maybe the car has already crashed be-
cause on Thursday, we will find out if 
we are officially in a recession. But it 
doesn’t really matter if it is official or 
not because the American people can 
already feel the pain of a recession. 
Two-thirds of the public has already 
made a decision in their own mind that 
we are in a recession right now. That is 
how they are feeling the impact on 
their lives. Four out of five Americans 
think that this country is on the wrong 
track under the Democrats and under 
Joe Biden. Yet the Democrats, with 
their desire to do more and more 
spending, and Joe Biden trying to do 
his Build Back Better routine—they 
want to keep us going right over the 
cliff. The Biden administration has to 
be the most out-of-touch administra-
tion since at least Herbert Hoover. 
It is time to reverse course. Stop the 
attacks on American energy. We have 
some of the largest energy reserves in 
the world here in the United States. We 
have plenty of it in my home State of 
Wyoming. We ought to be using it. We 
have the best energy workers. We have 
the highest environmental standards of 
anywhere on planet Earth. 
So the crisis facing our Nation right 
now is a crisis of choice: an energy cri-
sis, an inflation crisis, a border crisis, 
a crime crisis—all chosen by the Demo-
crats and their policies. 
Elections are coming. Midterm elec-
tions are a report card of the President 
halfway through a 4-year term. People 
are going to send a message that they 
are eager to change direction from the 
many crises that have been brought 
upon this Nation by Joe Biden and his 
liberal 
Democrat 
enablers—a 
crisis 
that the President and the Democrats 
are unwilling and unable to correct.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3667 
July 26, 2022 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I 
appreciate so much the comments of 
my colleague. I think this shows you 
that whether you are talking about 
Wyoming and the people who are there 
or Tennessee, my State, the economy 
is one of the top issues people are dis-
cussing. 
Joe Biden addressed the Nation just 
over a year ago, and he had all of these 
bold claims about how he expected the 
economy to respond to his what I 
thought 
were 
reckless 
taxing-and- 
spending sprees. He made this state-
ment, and I am going to quote him be-
cause he was trying to make the point 
that inflation was transitory, that it 
was going to be temporary. Here is 
what he said: 
I want to be clear: my administration un-
derstands that were we ever to experience 
unchecked inflation in the long term, that 
would pose a real challenge for our economy. 
While we’re confident that isn’t what we’re 
seeing today, we’re going to remain vigilant 
about any response that is needed. 
Well, let’s fast-forward a year from 
that very bold, brash statement, and 
we know that it was a falsehood that 
was meant to distract ‘‘we the people’’ 
while the President and the Democrats 
worked overtime to make things worse. 
Now, this week, economists expect to 
confirm what we have known for a long 
time and, as Senator BARRASSO was 
saying, what people are feeling in their 
personal economy—that the U.S. econ-
omy isn’t just struggling, it is shrink-
ing. Buying power for households is 
shrinking. Options and choices are 
shrinking. If the numbers say what we 
think they will, we will see the second 
consecutive month of a shrinking GDP 
and another month of runaway infla-
tion. Just a few hours ago, we learned 
that 
consumer 
confidence 
dropped 
again this month. Expectations are 
down again. 
These are the warning signs of a re-
cession. The White House doesn’t want 
us to say it. The pundits don’t want to 
say it. But that is the reality that Joe 
Biden has created. Do you know who is 
saying it? Thousands of Tennesseans 
because they are living it every day. 
Now, I would suggest to my col-
leagues that if they find themselves 
questioning this reality, they should 
get out of the city and spend some time 
talking to people who live in their 
State—people who don’t exist in the 
political bubble, the people who are 
having to make a choice between fill-
ing up the gas tank and filling up the 
grocery cart. Go talk to the farmers 
and the truckdrivers and the small 
business owners, and listen to them 
when they tell you how very difficult 
life is right now. Talk to the moms and 
the grandmoms in those smalltown 
grocery stores and listen to them when 
they tell you how hard it is to keep 
their household running. 
One of the many reasons this is so 
frustrating for Tennesseans is that 
under President Trump, economic suc-
cess was pretty much a given. The 
country was recovering from the pan-
demic. We had a plan to repair our sup-
ply chains. The American people were 
starting 
to 
have 
hope 
that 
the 
dystopian nightmare they had been liv-
ing through was finally over. 
But it is clear to them that if we ever 
find any sort of success under Presi-
dent Biden, it is going to come as a 
pleasant surprise because right now 
they are not seeing light at the end of 
the tunnel. Every week, it is harder, 
whether you are trying to find baby 
formula or you are trying to find basic 
staples or you are trying to make some 
of those pre-back-to-school purchases 
for your children. 
I talk to people every day. They 
worry about what is coming next be-
cause they cannot believe how fast the 
change has come about under the Biden 
administration. One of the things they 
mention is that Joe Biden and the 
Democrats have eliminated predict-
ability and replaced it with certainty 
that 
whatever 
this 
administration 
comes up with next is going to be 
something 
that 
makes 
their 
lives 
worse. 
When I go home and I talk to my 
friends at church or at the store, peo-
ple ask me: Why is this administration 
doing this? How could they possibly be 
making such terrible decisions? 
The answer is really quite simple. 
They don’t believe that the purpose of 
the Federal Government is to serve 
‘‘we the people’’; they believe its pur-
pose is to control our lives from the 
moment we get up in the morning until 
we put our head on the pillow at night, 
24/7, 365. They have a long history of 
using their power to incentivize de-
pendency on the government, but this 
administration has taken it even fur-
ther. 
What they perceive is happening is 
that they are being punished—pun-
ishing families, small businesses, and 
local governments that speak out by 
forcing them to pay for a socialist 
agenda that picks winners and losers. 
And who loses? Families. Small busi-
nesses. Local governments. They lose 
every single time. 
At every stop so far on my 95-county 
tour, county mayors and other local 
leaders have described to me how this 
agenda has made planning for the fu-
ture virtually impossible. Those are 
their words, not mine: It is impossible. 
A few years ago, they were focused on 
improving their communities, and now 
they are just praying that they will be 
able to keep providing basic services. 
Fuel is too expensive. Construction 
supplies are too expensive. And if they 
are available, utilities are breaking the 
budget. 
In McNairy County, a 3-year supply 
chain delay on a new firetruck has fro-
zen the flow of much needed grant 
funding. Local leaders were counting 
on that money to finish a few projects, 
get more first responders on the road, 
and lower the cost of living for the 
30,000 people they are responsible for, 
but now they are stuck. 
It is the same story for hundreds of 
small businesses and farms all across 
the State. We have farmers who de-
cided not to put their crops in the 
ground this year because the cost of 
diesel, fertilizer, chemicals, and pes-
ticides is just too high. Now think 
about that. The people responsible for 
maintaining our food supply are no 
longer able to supply food because this 
administration had other priorities. 
Retailers and other small business 
owners aren’t faring any better. Be-
cause things are more expensive for 
them, they are more expensive for each 
and every one of us. 
More and more often, Tennessee fam-
ilies are finding too much month left 
at the end of their paycheck rather 
than paycheck that is left at the end of 
the month. This has led to some hard 
choices, not just about the little lux-
uries they once enjoyed but about the 
essentials. Will they cook a balanced 
meal or will they pay the electric bill? 
Will they put gas in the car or do they 
need to send that money to school for 
their kids’ lunch? No one should have 
to make these choices, but this is the 
reality for millions of families. 
But President Biden and the Demo-
crats aren’t worried about that. It 
doesn’t appear they have ever been. 
Once they took control of the Federal 
Government, they immediately started 
spending money on things that sounded 
great to their base but that the Amer-
ican people did not vote for and still 
simply do not want. They knew this 
would sabotage our economic recovery, 
it would drive inflation, but still they 
found plenty of money to start chip-
ping away at their wish list. 
They couldn’t bring themselves to let 
America stay energy independent, so 
they canceled the Keystone Pipeline, 
and they sent the regulatory state 
after domestic energy producers. In-
deed, 42 of the 69 regulations that this 
President has put in place have been 
focused on the energy sector. 
Time 
and 
time 
again, 
President 
Biden and the Democrats have made it 
clear that their priorities do not align 
with the wants and needs of this coun-
try. 
They gave a green light to the Green 
New Deal, to critical race theory in 
public schools, to an open border, and 
to force decimating vaccine mandates 
on the National Guard and the Re-
serves. 
Meanwhile, the American economy 
has stopped dead in its tracks. This has 
to end. We are not just losing money; 
we are running out of time. The Amer-
ican people are beginning to feel this 
administration has abandoned them, 
that they are being punished. But they 
also want you to know that in spite of 
all that, they are not ready to submit 
to this agenda. They are concerned 
about their families and their commu-
nities. It is time to move away from 
this reckless, destructive agenda and 
choose the American people.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3668 
July 26, 2022 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia. 
Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that I am able to 
speak and followed by Senator CORTEZ 
MASTO to be able to speak before the 
Senate adjourns for the weekly caucus 
lunches. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
H.R. 4346 
Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, today 
we took another giant step on some-
thing that has been a lot harder than it 
should have been and could have been 
because it actually started last June 
when I rose before this body—June of 
2021—to speak about the critical need 
to pass the U.S. Innovation and Com-
petition Act, as it was known back 
then, USICA, in order to shore up U.S. 
investment in research and develop-
ment and manufacturing of critical 
technologies. 
On this bill—a few name changes 
later, and, unfortunately, more than a 
year later—I rise again before this 
body to express my strong support for 
this revised CHIPS+ legislation—that 
we just cleared an important hurdle for 
over the last hour—and urge my col-
leagues to pass this bill as quickly as 
possible so we can get it out of the Sen-
ate, get it over to the House, and get it 
to the President’s desk. 
We cannot afford to waste any more 
time because this funding sends a mes-
sage that the United States is putting 
a strong down payment on maintaining 
our edge in the global technology race 
and preventing global supply chains 
from being weaponized against the 
United States or, for that matter, 
against our allies. 
Over the past few years, China has 
continued to increase investments in 
its domestic industries and, particu-
larly, in areas that confer long-term 
strategic influence. This includes the 
semiconductor industry, which I have 
been particularly focused on over the 
past few years. 
Now, let me be clear. When I talk 
about China—let me be clear—my beef 
is with the Communist Party of China, 
Xi Jinping, and their approach. It is 
not with the Chinese people; it is not 
with the Chinese diaspora. As a matter 
of fact, when people don’t make that 
distinction, you may play exactly into 
the CCP’s agenda that somehow these 
are all simply anti-Chinese activists. 
These are not. These are activities 
against the Government of China and, 
particularly, the Communist Party of 
China. 
Coming 
back 
to 
semiconductors: 
Semiconductors, often called chips, are 
the backbone of our modern lives. They 
can be found in literally everything 
with an on-and-off switch: from cars 
and trucks to washers and dryers to 
smartphones and laptops. Chips are an 
essential component in so many of the 
devices we use today. 
The growth in chips is going to be ex-
ponential. 
Many 
have 
fought 
and 
talked about the whole notion of the 
internet of things. The internet of 
things require devices that are con-
nected to the internet. Obviously, au-
tonomous driving would be one exam-
ple. For every connection, there needs 
to be a center, most of those requiring 
a semiconductor chip. 
Unfortunately, looking backwards, 
for many years, American semicon-
ductor companies led the world in both 
design and manufacturing of this crit-
ical technology. But the truth is, our 
leadership has languished. In recent 
years, we continue to lose ground, par-
ticularly not just to China but to East 
Asian markets in total. 
As a country, we have gone—from 
1990, when we produced literally 37 per-
cent of all the chips in the world, to 
today—in the whole field of microelec-
tronics, we are down to about 12 per-
cent. 
On the other hand, China has ramped 
up its investment in chips, providing 
an estimated $200 billion in financial 
support between just 2015 and going 
forward projection up to 2025. Chinese 
orders 
for 
semiconductor 
manufac-
turing equipment rose 58 percent in 
2021 in the midst of the COVID crisis. 
China has a goal to produce at least 70 
percent of its use of semiconductors in 
the country by 2030. 
The truth is, it is not just China. 
This is global competition. Japan re-
cently passed a $6.8 billion investment 
package that will fund innovative chip 
manufacturing, as well as research and 
development. South Korea, which has 
also been one of the great leaders in 
this movement for it, has similar-type 
investments. 
Unfortunately, one of the challenges 
we face is the country or the entity 
that has evolved some of the fastest 
has been Taiwan, where, unfortunately, 
we now rely on many of the most cut-
ting-edge, leading-edge chips coming 
out of the Taiwan. 
As we have seen with President Xi’s 
aggressive—at least indications, about 
trying to subjugate Taiwan—when we 
think of it in the context of the Rus-
sian-Ukraine battle, the notion that 
could take place beyond what it would 
do to the democracy that exists in Tai-
wan, what it would do in terms of that 
critical semiconductor production—it 
would cause not only a recession but 
depression around the world. 
It is not just South Korea, Japan, 
and Taiwan. India has recently passed 
legislation investing $30 billion in their 
domestic electronics manufacturing in-
dustry, with $10 billion of that dedi-
cated to chips manufacturing and dis-
play manufacturing. 
The truth is—and this is one of the 
things I think was the great irony—is 
that when I spoke about this bill 13 
months ago, then, obviously, the Sen-
ate, with the leadership of the Pre-
siding Officer and others, we actually 
passed this bill back in July of last 
year. Our passage of that bill and rais-
ing the expectation that America was 
going to really get in the game, set off 
alarm bells, not only in terms of what 
is coming out of Asia but from some of 
our allies in Europe. 
The truth is, European bureaucrats, 
particularly coming out of Brussels, 
are not normally viewed as moving 
with a great deal of speed. But because 
we have taken now 12 months to actu-
ally get our act together and get this 
bill to this stage of passage, we have 
seen European countries—Germany, for 
example, has already selected 32 semi-
conductor projects and put $12 billion 
in draft investments. And even our 
friends in France recently announced a 
major U.S. global foundry investment 
in France. 
This has proven out—the lack of in-
vestment by the U.S. has had a huge 
impact. From 2010 to 2020, only 17 
major semiconductor plants—they call 
them fabs, manufacturing fabs—were 
built in the United States. Over that 
same time, we have seen 122 built else-
where around the world. And the hand-
ful of major projects announced in the 
last year as a direct result of our ef-
forts a year ago to say we are going to 
put our money where our mouth is in 
terms of these kind of investments— 
major facilities in Ohio, Arizona, and 
elsewhere, candidly, are very much at 
risk at this point, unless we can get 
this legislation to the President’s desk. 
Right now, the truth is: The cost of 
new fabs is 25 percent to 50 percent 
higher in the United States; and that is 
partially due to the enormous financial 
incentives offered by our competitive 
ventures. 
The truth is, in a perfect world, we 
wouldn’t want governments subsidizing 
some of these investments. We don’t 
live in a perfect world. We live in a real 
world where competitors like China 
and even our allies around the world 
are making investments, candidly, that 
on a per capita basis even make this in-
vestment by the United States seem 
relatively small. 
Many ask, so why is it so important 
for the United States to maintain in-
vestment in semiconductor production 
when on a lot of accounts, the PRC— 
China—is several generations behind? 
Because the truth is, U.S. semicon-
ductor firms—and firms in the adjacent 
areas of lithography, packaging, and 
metrology—still lead the world. 
I can tell you, as chairman of the In-
telligence Committee, I can tell you 
unequivocally 
that 
the 
Communist 
Party of China and the PRC is acutely 
aware of that gap and aggressively are 
working, not just to close it, but to 
eventually leapfrog the United States 
and our allies to lead in chip produc-
tion. 
As a matter of fact, just over this 
past week, there was an extraordinary 
story coming out of Bloomberg that in-
dicated that the Chinese may have al-
ready moved dramatically forward in 
terms of 7-nanometer production. For 
those aware, if that is true, that could 
have a huge, huge effect. We should ex-
pect that because last year, President 
Xi announced a $1.4 trillion commit-
ment through 2025 to develop advanced

technologies, not only in chips, but in 
next-generation wireless networks and 
artificial 
intelligence—technologies 
that will candidly determine who is not 
only the economic but the security 
winner of the 21st century. 
I firmly believe that this is the time 
of technology competition across the 
series of domains, and China has a plan 
they articulated in their China 2025 
document. We, in this country, are still 
trying to determine what are those do-
mains. 
The truth is, semiconductors—which 
enable advancements in artificial intel-
ligence 
or 
high-performance 
com-
puting, hypersonics, and everything 
else, again, with an on-off switch—is 
arguably the centerpiece of President 
Xi’s effort to ultimately control inno-
vation system development. 
Meanwhile, many of the key ingredi-
ents to U.S. historical success, includ-
ing Federal support for R&D, invest-
ment in basic research and support for 
advanced manufacturing, have declined 
over the last 20 years. Why? I am focus-
ing on chips and the 5G and beyond. 
Here, there is a whole series of compo-
nents in this legislation we have ad-
vanced today that includes beefing up 
R&D, advanced manufacturing, and 
other critical areas. 
It brings me down to my closing com-
ments before I turn it over to the Sen-
ator from Nevada. That is why the $52 
billion in funding for CHIPS for Amer-
ica Act—a bipartisan effort my friend, 
Senator CORNYN and I, along with Sen-
ator SCHUMER and Senator COTTON—we 
have been working on this, literally, 
for years, way beyond the 13 months, 
when I rose on this topic 13 months 
ago—is so important and why a par-
allel effort also in this bill to catalyze 
U.S. and allied innovation in a more di-
verse and resilient telecommunications 
ecosystem is so virtually important. 
I would also note this simply isn’t an 
economic competitiveness or security 
issue. We know, as we see it play out 
right now in terms of supply chains— 
vis-a-vis Russia and Ukraine, the no-
tion of cutting off advanced semi-
conductors to Russia will have a huge 
effect on Russia’s military capacity. 
We also know, as well, this will be a 
jobs bill in terms of these fabrication 
facilities and research all across Amer-
ica. And, candidly, as we know, there 
are literally thousands of cars that al-
ready have been produced by American 
auto manufacturers that are sitting, 
not getting into the market because 
they don’t have the chips to make the 
cars actually operate. Over the long 
haul, bringing that supply chain back 
here will ultimately deal with inflation 
issues, as well. 
We cannot be held hostage on this 
critical issue. Most of the focus has 
been on chips, as appropriate. But this 
bill also makes important investments 
in the future of wireless telecommuni-
cations. In many ways, this issue first 
came to the forefront, not on chips, but 
a few years back—I say this as a 
former wireless telecom guy—when a 
Chinese company, Huawei, suddenly 
started to dominate the market. We 
raised concerns about Huawei. Many of 
our allies and others said: That is fine; 
what is your alternative? What is the 
Western alternative? 
I think we were a little bit slow on 
making the case; although, now, vir-
tually every nation that invested in 
Huawei equipment has realized na-
tional security concerns that are lit-
erally in the process of ripping and re-
placing that equipment. 
We have still got more to do. Huawei 
penetrated some of our markets in the 
United States. So this bill that has 
been called CHIPS also includes fund-
ing for the bipartisan Utilizing Stra-
tegic Allied Telecommunications Act, 
or the USA Act, which fosters U.S. in-
novation in the race for 5G by pro-
viding $1.5 billion to invest in Western- 
backed alternatives to, again, Chinese 
equipment providers, like Huawei but 
also ZTE. 
This is a bill that, again, I was proud 
to work on with many of my Intel col-
leagues, Senator BURR
and Senator 
RUBIO. It will also stand up a new Pub-
lic Wireless Supply Chain Innovation 
Fund to spur movements toward open- 
architecture 
software. 
That 
would 
allow us to fund innovative, ‘‘leap 
ahead’’ technologies in the domestic 
mobile broadband market. 
That 
approach 
plays 
to 
U.S. 
strengths, like software and network 
virtualization, and it means that we 
will have a wider set of firms, including 
American, 
with 
healthier 
balance 
sheets competing against these state- 
sponsored Chinese vendors, because one 
thing that has been clear over the past 
two administrations, our anti-Huawei 
message, or the things that finally 
moved, would have moved a lot quicker 
if we had had other U.S. and Western 
alternatives. 
Again, I will close now. As the chair-
man of the Senate Intelligence Com-
mittee, I see examples every day of 
how China is doubling down on its pur-
suit of advanced technologies that I 
think will define the 21st century, and 
in many ways, the United States has 
started to fall behind. 
Fortunately, it is not too late to 
change that narrative or to change 
that result. With the right invest-
ments, like the ones that have been 
provided in this legislation, we can un-
leash the ingenuity of the American 
people. We can reinvigorate American 
innovation and improve our national 
security while setting the country up 
to lead the way on technologies that 
will define our future. 
We need to get this passed as quickly 
as possible, and then I strongly, strong-
ly urge our colleagues in the House to 
pass it as well and get it to the Presi-
dent’s desk. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
I do want to thank my colleague 
from Nevada, who has been a leader on 
this legislation, as well, and knows the 
importance of getting this done. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nevada. 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, 
I do, I have to thank my friend and col-
league Senator WARNER from Virginia. 
He has been a leading voice on this 
issue and the importance of passing 
this legislation, not just because it ad-
dresses our national security. It gives 
us an economic advantage in this coun-
try. But he also realizes the jobs it cre-
ates, and it positions not just Nevada 
but every State—this country—to lean 
into the future and be prepared for the 
challenges of the 21st century. 
So I thank you because I know that 
you have been at the forefront of this, 
and you have not relented. Thank you, 
thank you for everything that you 
have done. 
MEDICARE 
Mr. President, there is another issue 
that is important for Nevada that I 
want to talk about. It is not just Ne-
vada but for so many across the coun-
try. 
You know, I was elected to the Sen-
ate, and ever since then, in 2017, I have 
stood up for Medicare and Nevada sen-
iors. I have fought against the Trump 
administration’s cruel proposals to cut 
Medicare funding, and I championed 
provisions to expand Medicare funding 
and services. 
That is why I was shocked when, last 
week, hundreds of Nevadans began call-
ing my office. They were anxious and 
alarmed over a deliberately misleading 
ad that is running on TV, on Facebook, 
and via a text campaign. 
In Reno, this past weekend, Nevadans 
came up to me because they were con-
cerned about these false accusations. 
This ad incorrectly claims that I sup-
port a bill that would strip $300 billion 
from Medicare. This couldn’t be further 
from the truth. 
What I do know is that the ad is a de-
liberate lie, and what they are being 
funded by, unfortunately—these ads—is 
a dark money group. They are being 
funded by American Prosperity Alli-
ance. This is exactly the kind of group 
I have been raising the alarm about for 
years, because here is the truth, here 
are the facts: I am standing up for 
Medicare, just like I always have. I am 
pushing legislation, just like many of 
our colleagues, just like the Presiding 
Officer is, as well, to lower prescription 
drug costs for Nevadans and save Medi-
care and so many other seniors across 
the country really almost $300 billion. 
It saves the government. What we are 
doing, our legislation, in total, saves 
dollars—almost $300 billion—for the 
government and, ultimately, the tax-
payers. 
The bill would not cut anything but 
Big Pharma’s profits, and seniors in 
Nevada and across the country can ex-
pect even stronger benefits under the 
legislation that I am working on, that 
the Presiding Officer is working on, as 
so many of us are. So why would the 
ads lie about something so important 
to the American public when we are 
working to lower their costs and give 
them access to affordable healthcare in 
this country?

July 26, 2022 
Here is why: Because powerful inter-
est groups out there don’t want this 
legislation to succeed. So they are 
pouring dark money into efforts to 
stop it. 
Now, we don’t know who really fund-
ed this ad, and the organization that 
wrote the check doesn’t have to dis-
close that information. So nobody can 
be held accountable, and that is part of 
the problem. And that is why I have 
been calling for this accountability and 
this transparency about who is funding 
all of these ads. 
That is what we know—that the dark 
money is out there, and the only one 
that is going to benefit from these ads 
at the end of the day is Big Pharma, 
because they don’t want their profits 
cut. So they are trying to frighten Ne-
vadans and pressure me to vote against 
a bill that would help my very con-
stituents. 
Well, let me just say this: It won’t 
work. I stand up to bullies, and when I 
was attorney general, I was very proud 
that not only did I take on the big 
banks during the foreclosure crisis, 
but, during my tenure and continuing 
now, I stood up to Big Pharma, suing 
Pfizer for millions after the company 
misled Nevada consumers about the 
safety of its drugs. 
So I am not going to be intimidated 
by advertisements spouting false infor-
mation to my constituents. 
So I am here today to set the record 
straight and make sure that Nevadans 
understand what is really going on, be-
cause here is what is happening: The 
very legislation that I am working on, 
that the Presiding Officer is working 
on for New Mexico, and so many of us 
are, would dramatically lower prescrip-
tion drug costs and strengthen Medi-
care. It would do this by capping out- 
of-pocket costs for prescription drugs. 
It would punish drug companies that 
try to raise the prices of their drugs 
faster than the rate of inflation. And, 
oh, yes, it would allow the government 
to negotiate fair prices for drugs from 
pharmaceutical companies. 
Our legislation will save the govern-
ment almost $300 billion. Now, that is 
not a cut; that is a savings. Every 
household in the country knows the 
difference between the two. Under this 
plan, Nevadans will be getting more 
benefits for less money, period. That is 
the truth. 
Here is my question to Big Pharma: 
Why do you go out and scare individ-
uals, put ads out there that you are 
paying for that are lies, when in actu-
ality you could be working with us? 
Because here is what I know, at the 
end of the day, from my constituents: 
Nobody in this country, whether you 
live in the State of Nevada or in any 
other State, should have to make a 
tough decision of whether you can af-
ford your healthcare, your prescription 
drugs, or put food on the table or pay 
your electric bill. That is not what this 
country is about. 
So to Big Pharma, I will call you out. 
You want to really be a part of the so-
lution? Then come support this legisla-
tion. Help us in this country lower 
costs for so many families who lit-
erally need access to medications that 
they cannot afford. That is not what 
this country stands for. 
So that is the truth, and to anyone— 
anyone—who wants to come out and 
challenge that, I am ready to debate 
you any time of the day. 
I yield the floor.

CHIPS ACT OF 2022—Continued 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
AFFORDABLE HOUSING 
Mr. REED. Madam President, among 
the many financial worries for average 
Americans, particularly young families 
just starting out, is finding a safe, af-
fordable place to live. The simple fact 
is that we don’t have the supply of 
housing to meet demand. Indeed, we 
have a shortfall of 7 million affordable 
housing units according to the Na-
tional Low-Income Housing Coalition. 
Certainly, the COVID–19 pandemic 
reduced housing production and cre-
ated kinks in the supply chain for im-
portant raw materials like lumber, but 
the truth is that we were lagging when 
it came to building and maintaining af-
fordable housing long before COVID–19. 
Back in 2020, a Rhode Island family 
earning the State’s median income 
could not afford to buy a home at the 
median price anywhere in the State. It 
has only gotten worse since then. 
Across the country, home prices have 
risen 13.4 percent from last year, with 
the national median price now at 
$416,000. 
In my State, the Rhode Island Asso-
ciation of Realtors reports that the 
median price of homes sold in June 2022 
reached an alltime high of $430,000. 
That is 11.7 percent higher than a year 
earlier. 
A large reason that home ownership 
is out of reach for many Americans is 
the inventory levels are so low. In re-
cent months, sales have dropped as in-
terest rates have increased, but we are 
still nowhere near a balanced market. 
In a healthy housing market, there is 
usually a 6-month supply of homes 
available for sale at any given time. 
Right now, our country has less than a 
3-month supply of homes, and Rhode 
Island has less than a 2-month supply. 
As potential home buyers are priced 
out of the housing market, they re-
main in the rental market, adding ad-
ditional pressure to rental prices. Ac-
cording to apartmentlist.com, rent has 
grown 14.1 percent nationally from last 
summer. In Providence, RI, rents have 
jumped 23.8 percent from last year. 
When supply is tight and rents go up, 
it is harder for our more vulnerable 
community members to afford housing. 
That is our seniors, people with disabil-
ities, and the unhoused. People who 
have been a part of the fabric of our 
communities for decades are no longer 
able to afford staying. It is a scary 
prospect that is facing too many Amer-
icans. 
This didn’t happen overnight. Ac-
cording to the National Low Income 
Housing 
Coalition, 
the 
number 
of 
homes with low monthly rents declined 
by 4 million between 1991 and 2017. 
And the underbuilding of starter 
homes for decades has caught up to us, 
creating 
a 
major 
housing 
supply 
crunch that has led to soaring rents 
and home prices. Developers have more 
incentives 
to 
build 
six-bedroom 
‘‘McMansions’’ and luxury apartments. 
That doesn’t help folks who just need a 
safe, affordable place to live in their 
community, and it doesn’t meet the 
needs of young families who just want 
about 1,800 square feet, four walls, and 
a roof. We now have a housing market 
where 
police 
officers, 
firefighters, 
teachers, and nurses cannot afford to 
live in the communities that they 
serve. Simply put, our current housing 
stock does not have homes to match 
what families want and what families 
need. 
Also contributing to the problem, our 
housing market has been flooded with 
speculators, private equity firms, and 
large institutional investors who are 
starting to come in looking for big 
profits. This is why Chairman BROWN, 
Senator WARREN, and I have called on 
HUD to stem the flow of single-family 
homes to institutional investors and 
help level the playing field between 
families and large investors. 
In this kind of market, it is hard for 
everyone, especially first-time buyers. 
Over the last 2 years, the Federal 
Government has made substantial in-
vestments in affordable housing, help-
ing people experiencing homelessness, 
and keeping people stably housed. 
Without the measures we adopted, the 
housing situation for millions of Amer-
icans would be even worse. 
I was part of the bipartisan working 
group that negotiated the CARES Act, 
which was a step toward keeping peo-
ple safe, protecting public health, and 
preventing an affordable housing crisis 
from becoming an eviction disaster. 
But, clearly, the CARES Act wasn’t 
enough. That is why I introduced a bill 
to provide rental assistance and home-
owner assistance to families. That leg-
islative initiative led to the influx of 
more than $46 billion in emergency 
rental assistance to help renters who 
have struggled to pay their rent and 
utilities during the pandemic. Those 
funds have also been used to help with 
housing 
stability, 
particularly 
for 
unhoused individuals. In total, emer-
gency rental assistance has helped over 
34,000 families in Rhode Island alone.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3671 
July 26, 2022 
And I also worked with colleagues to 
deliver nearly $10 billion under the 
Homeowner Assistance Fund to help 
homeowners who experienced COVID–19 
hardships keep up with house pay-
ments and stay in their homes. Over 
$50 million in this fund is helping 
homeowners in my State. 
Rhode Island and other States are 
also committing their American Res-
cue Plan dollars toward building new 
affordable housing. It is hard to over-
state the impact that this cushion of 
support has had for families in our 
State and across the country. 
Putting a historic emphasis on hous-
ing support helped eliminate a major 
potential economic hardship that could 
have been catastrophic for millions of 
Americans. Without the worry of how 
to make rent or mortgage payments, 
families didn’t need to scramble to find 
shelter and uproot themselves from 
their support systems. Kids had safe 
homes and could stay in the same 
school. It helped parents keep their 
jobs, helped seniors stay connected to 
their communities, and kept all of us 
healthier and safer. We need more of 
this kind of support for families, not 
less. 
Measures like the Emergency Rental 
Assistance Program and the Home-
owner 
Assistance 
Fund were tem-
porary, and those programs are going 
to be wrapping up in the next few 
months. As we look ahead to the fu-
ture, it is time for us to think, What 
have we learned? What are the acute 
needs of housing today? 
There is no question we need to build 
more affordable housing. We need to 
invest in rehabilitating old homes but 
also in building new homes, specifi-
cally for low-income families. 
We need to fortify the Federal pro-
grams that incentivize private invest-
ment in affordable housing, like the 
National Housing Trust Fund, the Cap-
ital Magnet Fund, Low-Income Hous-
ing Tax Credits, and HOME Investment 
Partnerships. That includes extending 
available low-income housing tax cred-
its by reinstating the 12.5-percent 
boost that expired at the end of 2021. It 
also means passing the bipartisan 
LIFELINE Act introduced by Senators 
LEAHY, COLLINS, WYDEN, myself, and 
many others so that we can maximize 
the impact of the State and Local Fis-
cal Recovery Funds from the American 
Rescue Plan when States put those 
funds toward building and maintaining 
affordable housing. 
We need to invest in apprenticeships 
and training programs to create a more 
skilled construction workforce with a 
focus on attracting more diverse work-
ers. 
We 
need 
more 
innovation, 
with 
quicker building techniques and high- 
tech materials. This is not a pipe-
dream. Rhode Island has already shown 
the world how to get innovative in the 
housing space with ONE Neighborhood 
Builders’ Sheridan Small Homes and 
Bowdoin Street Rowhouse. These are 
innovative 
construction 
projects— 
small homes with many energy-saving 
aspects. They are the future, and we 
have to invest in that future. 
And as I said, we have to build to 
focus on a green future that includes 
the effects of climate change. That 
means we need to pass the Green Ret-
rofits Act, which I introduced with 
Senator COLLINS. This bill would boost 
energy efficiency in thousands of mul-
tifamily residential homes nationwide 
by bolstering public-private partner-
ships to make healthy home upgrades 
and creating a new program to dis-
tribute energy efficiency grants and 
loans. 
We need to increase our assistance 
and our commitment to homeless as-
sistance grants. That includes funding 
for the Continuum of Care Program, 
which serves over 750,000 people experi-
encing homelessness each year, and for 
emergency solution grants, which sup-
port over 350,000 who are in emergency 
shelter each year. 
We need to fully fund housing choice 
vouchers, make them easier to use in 
communities, and incentivize landlords 
to take these vouchers, which is being 
done presently in Rhode Island. 
Investing in housing will not fuel the 
fire of inflation; it will tackle one of 
the key contributors to rising costs 
and help stabilize family budgets. 
On many of these fronts, State and 
local action is also needed to move the 
ball forward. State and local govern-
ments must address the issue of exclu-
sionary zoning. In far too many places, 
there are barriers to building multi-
family homes or townhouse and too- 
high minimums for lot sizes, making it 
very challenging to build affordably. 
It should be easier for people to con-
vert their garage into living space for a 
family member, such as an in-law suite 
above a detached garage. And that is 
just one example. 
Some of these challenges can be 
traced back to ‘‘not in my backyard’’ 
attitudes, which we must all do our 
part to overcome. 
Every family should have a decent, 
affordable place to live, and we need to 
commit ourselves to making the in-
vestments and adopting policies to 
make that possible. 
And emphasizing, once again, invest-
ment in housing will lower costs to 
families, which will be an effective way 
to help overall—not immediately—but 
overall to lower inflationary pressures 
on our working families. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Louisiana. 
Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, 
joining me today on the floor are Mr. 
James Shea, Mr. Woody Daigle, and 
Ms. Bernadette Breslin—three very 
able members of my staff. 
ENERGY POLICIES 
Madam President, I want to talk for 
a few minutes today about electricity 
and, more specifically, about how to 
pay for it. 
My people are really struggling right 
now. Folks in my home State of Lou-
isiana—and I know this is true in your 
State, Madam President, and across 
the country—are facing some of the 
largest energy bills, electricity bills, in 
the history of ever. 
In the past month, I have learned 
about a woman in Shreveport in my 
State whose electricity bill went from 
$182 to $243, a Baton Rouge resident 
whose bill went from $65 to $353, a cit-
izen from my city of New Orleans 
whose bill went from $140 to $280 in 1 
month. 
As one of my people put it, ‘‘Your 
electricity bill should not be one-third 
of your paycheck.’’ 
Now, I realize that to some Ameri-
cans who are fortunate enough to be 
wealthier, these increases may seem 
insignificant, but many of my people in 
Louisiana live from paycheck to pay-
check. And put very simply, many of 
the people in my State and many of 
their fellow Americans simply cannot 
afford this. 
Now, look, I understand it is hot. I 
understand it is hot in Louisiana. Here 
is a news flash: In the summer, it is al-
ways hot in Louisiana. Some days, I 
think that God gave Louisiana a choice 
between good food and good weather, 
and we chose good food. I get that. 
But heat is not the main reason that 
these electricity bills are soaring. It is 
not. The main reason that electricity 
bills are soaring is because of President 
Biden’s profoundly foolish energy poli-
cies which have depleted America’s 
natural gas inventories. 
Because of this, natural gas prices 
have increased 75 percent from 2020— 
not 9.1 percent that you read in the 
newspaper or attributed to inflation in 
general, not 20 percent—75 percent, and 
they continue to climb. 
Entergy is one of the largest elec-
tricity providers in my State, particu-
larly in South Louisiana—actually, all 
over my State. Entergy just sent a let-
ter to its customers, and I want to 
quote from it. This is what Entergy 
told its ratepayers and my people: 
[T]he cost of natural gas, which we use to 
operate numerous power generation facili-
ties, continues to rise. Natural gas prices in 
April of 2022 were more than double those in 
April of 2021 and three times higher than 
April 2020. As a result, these higher-than nor-
mal costs will be seen on customer bills. 
That is why my people are so scared. 
That is why the American people are so 
scared. 
Louisianans are not alone in this. A 
recent survey—and this is a very rep-
utable 
research 
firm 
called 
HelpAdvisor—just found that 24 per-
cent—a quarter—of all Americans have 
reduced or gone without paying basic 
expenses so they can pay their energy 
bills, pay their electricity bills. 
What country are we living in? 
Now, the current energy crisis—and 
that is what this is—is a sucking chest 
wound for Louisianans and for Ameri-
cans. Yet President Biden refuses to 
budge from his war on affordable en-
ergy that got us here. 
I will say this: President Biden has 
been true to his word. On day 1 of his

campaign, he said he would destroy 
America’s energy independence. By 
God, he has done it. He said that. By 
God, he has been successful. He killed 
the Keystone Pipeline. He has canceled 
our 
country’s 
mineral 
leases. 
He 
stalled our country’s pipelines. He has 
told his banking regulators to dry up 
capital and loans for energy produc-
tion. He has put the full force and 
weight of the U.S. Government behind 
this effort to destroy oil and gas. In 
doing so, he has intentionally forfeited 
America’s energy independence, and 
that is why electricity bills are so 
high. 
I will give you one example, but I am 
not going to beat this to death. Earlier 
this month—I guess just before July 4— 
President Biden’s Department of the 
Interior released its 5-year Federal 
leasing plan. That plan contains a max-
imum—it doesn’t even mean they will 
do this amount—of 11 lease sales for oil 
and gas producers. Do you know what 
the last plan proposed was under the 
prior administration? Forty-seven. 
It is clear. I mean, I get it. President 
Biden does not want the United States 
of America to produce its own fossil 
fuels. He just doesn’t. His new plan is 
we are going to forfeit our energy inde-
pendence. 
We have to have oil and gas to run 
the greatest economy in all of human 
history. Where are we going to get it if 
we forfeit our energy independence? 
Well, we are going to buy up natural 
gas and oil from countries—foreign 
countries—that hate us. So those for-
eign countries will have more money to 
buy weapons to try to kill us. That is 
what we are doing. 
Now, what is the answer? How do we 
fix this? Well, the answer—duh—is to 
have the American people produce 
their own oil and gas. We can do it, and 
we have done it before. We were energy 
independent. My people in Louisiana 
know how to produce clean, affordable 
energy and so do other people in other 
States. 
This is what else my people would 
tell President Biden if they could speak 
to him directly. They would say: Mr. 
President, with all due respect, we can 
produce natural gas; we can produce 
oil. 
They would go further. They would 
say: Mr. President, we want you to un-
derstand that we don’t hate wind, and 
we don’t hate solar. We, the people of 
Louisiana, want to explore all alter-
native forms of energy: wind, solar, nu-
clear, clean hydrogen, hydroelectric. 
But they would go further and say: 
Mr. President, we want a balanced en-
ergy policy. Ours is the greatest econ-
omy in all of human history, and it 
uses a lot of energy, and 80 percent of 
our energy comes from fossil fuels. Do 
we work every day to make those fossil 
fuels cleaner? Yes, but we can’t do 
without them. When we try, this is 
what happens in terms of electricity 
bills. 
There are ways that people can get 
help. They are struggling right now in 
my State. For example, for customers 
in New Orleans, Entergy has created a 
program called Energy Smart Pro-
gram. Entergy, the electric power com-
pany, will send an employee out to 
your residence for free and make sug-
gestions about how you can lower your 
bills. 
There are other entities that are try-
ing to help. There is a group called 
Share the Light and another group 
called SMILE. These are local non-
profits in Lafayette that will try to 
help people in their areas who are hav-
ing trouble paying their electricity 
bills. 
SLEMCO is also offering a terrific 
utility assistance program that would 
provide a one-time $300 grant payment 
for people who can’t pay their elec-
tricity bills. 
Of course, there are also programs 
under my State’s Louisiana Housing 
Corporation, such as LIHEAP and the 
Weatherization 
Assistance 
Program, 
that can help folks reduce their elec-
tricity bills. 
Let me close in this way. Two years 
ago, I was on this same floor and in 
this very same spot—right here. I was 
able to talk about how our economy 
was soaring. Two years ago, I was able 
to proudly say that we in America were 
energy independent, that unemploy-
ment was at record lows, and that 
Americans had more money in their 
pockets. We can have that again. The 
American people deserve it. We can 
have it again but not if President 
Biden continues to double down on 
what, in my judgment, is his bone- 
deep, down-to-the-marrow, foolish en-
ergy policy, which, when you scrub 
away all the rhetoric, amounts to this: 
wind, solar, and wishful thinking. 
You can’t produce electricity with 
wishful thinking. My people’s bills are 
way too high, and they don’t have to be 
that high if President Biden would just 
listen. 
I yield to Senator MARSHALL. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
HONORING AMELIA EARHART 
Mr. MARSHALL. Madam President, 
this week, after waiting more than 20 
years, Amelia Earhart’s statue will re-
place fellow Atchison, KS, native and 
former U.S. Senator John Ingalls in 
the National Statuary Hall Collection. 
Amelia will join President Dwight D. 
Eisenhower, our Nation’s 34th Presi-
dent and Abilene, KS, native, as one of 
Kansas’s two tribute statues in the 
Capitol 
Building. 
President 
Eisen-
hower’s statue was placed in the Cap-
itol Rotunda in 2003, but Amelia’s jour-
ney to our Nation’s Capitol has taken 
much longer. Kansans, and especially 
the people of Atchison, persevered, just 
as Amelia did in her pursuit of flight, 
to coordinate and create a bronze stat-
ue and limestone base—an appropriate 
nod to our State’s signature natural 
stone. 
It was 85 years ago this month that 
Amelia Earhart vanished over the vast 
Pacific Ocean. She had already com-
pleted more than three-fourths of her 
trip, which would have made her the 
first pilot ever to circle the Earth at 
its equator. Amelia had already made 
history before this flight. She was the 
first person to fly solo from Hawaii to 
the U.S. mainland, the first woman to 
fly solo across the Atlantic, and the 
first woman to fly nonstop across the 
United States. In defying odds and ex-
pectations with each new accomplish-
ment, she became a global superstar 
and one of the most accomplished pi-
lots in history. 
While Amelia was a pioneer for avi-
ators everywhere, she is still today a 
role model for every person but espe-
cially for women and young girls who 
strive to break barriers and achieve 
their dreams despite the odds being 
against them. 
In 
my 
home 
State 
of 
Kansas, 
Amelia’s legacy lives on and continues 
to know no limits. Kansas is home to 
the Air Capital of the World for good 
reason. Our State has been home to 
many aviation manufacturers over the 
course of a century, and on any given 
summer’s day, with eyes to the sky, 
you can see crop dusters flying low, 
dodging trees and power lines, diving 
upon acres and acres of cropland. Look-
ing farther upward, you might see 
hobby pilots or executive jets, and 
often, you will hear screeching fighter 
bombers and giant jet refuelers, but to 
see them, you have to strain your eyes 
forward of the booming sound. Indeed, 
our spacious land is well fitted for spa-
cious runways, and our faraway hori-
zons that provide endless visibility go 
on for miles on end, signaling Kansas 
will remain the Nation’s leader in aero-
space and drone development. 
I want to go back for a moment to a 
young Amelia being brought up in the 
heartland. Yes, Kansas is where 9-year- 
old Amelia first took to flight. Listen 
to this story. 
Inspired by an exhibit she saw at the 
1904 World’s Fair, she built by herself a 
makeshift roller coaster. Recall again 
she is 9 years of age in this story. She 
launched her coaster off the roof of her 
house. After tipping over the edge of 
the roofline, she said: ‘‘It felt like I was 
flying.’’ Sixteen years later, she pur-
chased her own plane and flew to new 
heights. 
Today, I also want to honor the peo-
ple of Atchison, who have taken great 
lengths to preserve and tell Amelia’s 
story for all Americans to hear. My 
wife and I not too long ago enjoyed a 
great day visiting her perfectly pre-
served birth home, but the star of the 
show for our visit—a ‘‘must go see’’ for 
everybody but especially for American 
history buffs—was the new Amelia Ear-
hart Hangar Museum, which honors 
Amelia’s aviation legacy and inspires 
all generations in the pursuit of flight. 
The centerpiece is Muriel, the world’s 
last remaining Lockheed Electra 10–E, 
an aircraft identical to the plane Amel-
ia flew on her final flight. Muriel is 
named for Amelia’s younger sister, 
Grace Muriel Earhart Morrissey.

July 26, 2022 
What I am really excited about at the 
museum is the immersive STEM exhib-
its, 
which 
take 
visitors 
through 
Earhart’s adventurous life, from grow-
ing up in Atchison, KS, to the height of 
her worldwide fame as the first woman 
to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean. 
Every school within busing distance 
has to plan a field trip to Atchison in 
the coming year. Parents should be 
fighting for the chance to chaperone. 
Finally, I want to salute Atchison’s 
annual festival in honor of Amelia, 
which I attended just a couple of week-
ends ago, celebrating her life and 
achievements 
with 
history 
lessons, 
concerts, downtown arts and crafts, a 
world-class 
fireworks 
extravaganza, 
and a luncheon honoring the Amelia 
Earhart 
Pioneering 
Achievement 
Award recipient. It was there for the 
first time that I connected with the 
legend of Amelia and why the home-
town folks, nearly 130 years after her 
birth, fight to preserve her legacy and 
especially how much she means to the 
ladies of the community. 
Amelia flew to new heights and trav-
eled longer distances than ever before, 
and today, Americans everywhere are 
joining Atchisonians and Kansans as 
we all honor Amelia this week out of a 
shared admiration for her innovative, 
pioneering spirit. 
Her fellow Atchison native and stat-
uary predecessor, John Ingalls, coined 
the motto for our State, ‘‘Ad Astra per 
Aspera,’’ which means ‘‘to the stars 
through difficulties.’’ Amelia Earhart 
personified that motto by pushing 
against 
social 
boundaries 
set 
for 
women and breaking new records in 
flight not just for a woman but for all 
aviators. 
For generations to come, her spirit 
and her likeness in Statuary Hall will 
inspire not only Kansans but also visi-
tors from around the world. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
Mr. MORAN. Madam President, this 
week, the U.S. Capitol will welcome a 
bronze statue of a determined young 
woman with short-cut hair, a curious 
smile, and a bomber hat in hand. For 
almost everyone around the country, 
this young woman is easily recogniz-
able as the adventurer and aviator 
Amelia Earhart. 
Amelia Earhart, the most famous 
woman in aviation, soared into the his-
tory books, setting flight records and 
breaking barriers. But before she be-
came known worldwide as the Queen of 
the Air, she was the daughter of a 
small town in Kansas, Atchison. 
Amelia Earhart was born in 1897 in 
Atchison, KS, a rural community that 
had a population then of about 500 peo-
ple. As a young girl, Amelia kept busy 
with her sister Muriel. The girls were 
constantly exploring their own neigh-
borhood, climbing trees, and playing 
with animals. During her high school 
years, Amelia excelled in chemistry, 
which inspired her to go to medical 
school—a goal unthinkable for woman 
at the time. Her independence and am-
bition were evident from a very young 
age. 
Amelia’s go-getter attitude propelled 
her to become an innovative entre-
preneur—working as a stenographer, 
an author, a social worker, a truck-
driver, and even a fashion designer. 
Later in life, when Amelia was asked 
how she maintained such a fervent 
work ethic, she stated: 
The most effective way to do it is to do it. 
This can-do spirit was the catalyst 
for Earhart’s daring and fast-paced ca-
reer as an aviator. Amelia fell in love 
with flight when she took a plane ride 
at a California airshow in 1920, and it 
wasn’t long after that experience be-
fore Amelia started her first pilot les-
sons. 
She completed her aviation courses 
in 1921, making her only the 16th 
woman in the world with a license to 
fly. Earhart quickly purchased her own 
plane and wasted no time in becoming 
one of the world’s most notable avi-
ators. 
Following Charles Lindbergh’s solo 
flight across the Atlantic, interest 
grew to see a woman fly across the At-
lantic. On June 17, 1928, Earhart took 
off but only as a passenger. After land-
ing in Wales some 20 hours later, she 
recalled how she felt like she was ‘‘just 
baggage, like a sack of potatoes,’’ and 
added, ‘‘Maybe someday, I’ll try it 
alone.’’ 
Shortly after that trip, Amelia an-
nounced she would fly the same path 
that she did in 1928 but this time on her 
own, solo. When the pilot was asked 
what prompted her to reattempt this 
flight, she stated: 
There’s more to life than just being a pas-
senger. 
In 1932, Earhart became the first 
woman to complete a solo trans-
atlantic flight in a record time of 14 
hours 56 minutes, despite being faced 
with a number of challenges during the 
trip. 
Earhart continued to break records 
by completing the first-ever solo flight 
from Hawaii to California, from Los 
Angeles to Mexico City, and reaching 
the highest altitude a female pilot had 
ever reached at the time. 
Her spirit of adventure led her to at-
tempt the greatest feat: a flight around 
the world. Amelia would be the first 
person to attempt this by taking the 
equatorial route, starting in the west 
and making her way east. This was an 
astonishing 29,000-mile route, with the 
last 7,000 miles occurring over the Pa-
cific Ocean. 
She left with her navigator, Fred 
Noonan, on June 1, 1937, making stops 
in South America, Africa, India, and 
Southeast Asia. Every stop on her jour-
ney, she came closer and closer and 
closer to achieving her goal. 
On July 2, 1937, the day of the longest 
leg of her journey, her quest ended too 
soon in radio silence somewhere over 
the Pacific. Intensive searches con-
tinue to this day, most recently by the 
renowned oceanographer and Kansan 
Dr. Bob Ballard, but have left the 
world continuing to wonder what ever 
happened to Amelia. 
She captivated the hearts and the 
minds of many and inspired the next 
generation of pilots to love the sky in 
the same way she did. 
Undeniably, the State of Kansas has 
a long history steeped in the aviation 
industry, but without pioneers like 
Amelia Earhart, our State would not 
be the epicenter of aviation that it is 
today. 
Now, in celebration of her accom-
plishments and legacy, Amelia Earhart 
will join President Dwight D. Eisen-
hower as bronze beacons representing 
Kansas in our Nation’s Capitol as part 
of the National Statuary Hall Collec-
tion. Tomorrow, this Wednesday, we 
will unveil Amelia’s statue to the 
world, just 3 days after what would 
have been her 125th birthday. 
This week would not have been pos-
sible without the efforts of Jacque 
Pregont, Karen Seaberg, and Reed 
Berger, all with the Atchison Amelia 
Earhart Foundation. 
Thank you for your extensive and de-
termined efforts. This partnership has 
made so much progress to get us to the 
day that we now arrive at. 
I look forward to the dedication cere-
mony on Wednesday and seeing Kan-
sans fill Statuary Hall to honor and 
preserve Amelia Earhart’s legacy. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
NATIONAL WHISTLEBLOWER APPRECIATION DAY 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
don’t know how many years in a row I 
have been doing this, but this week in 
July, I always come to the Senate floor 
to honor whistleblowers. 
I expect this week that the Senate 
will unanimously pass my resolution 
designating this Saturday, July 30, as 
National Whistleblower Appreciation 
Day. This year the resolution has 21 co-
sponsors from both sides of the aisle, 
more cosponsors than this resolution 
has had ever before. Now, that should 
serve as a very important reminder 
that protecting and celebrating whis-
tleblowers is not a partisan issue. It is 
just as simple as it being good govern-
ment. 
This Congress, I have been working 
on several pieces of whistleblower leg-
islation that also have bipartisan sup-
port. One of those bills, which I intro-
duced last December along with Sen-
ators WARREN and WARNOCK, relates to 
money laundering. In 2020, Congress es-
tablished the first-ever anti-money- 
laundering 
whistleblower 
program. 
Under 
this 
reward-based 
program, 
whistleblowers who provide actionable 
information to the government that 
exposes money laundering may receive 
a percentage of the funds recovered as 
a result of their disclosure. 
While that is an important step for-
ward, the current program has its 
issues. First, there is no minimum 
award amount, so the government isn’t

July 26, 2022 
obligated to pay a whistleblower any-
thing at all, even if the information 
that the whistleblower provides leads 
to a successful enforcement action. 
Second, the program doesn’t provide 
the Treasury Department with a mech-
anism to pay whistleblowers and, in-
stead, relies on yearly congressional 
appropriations. 
My bill addresses these issues. It 
raises the cap on whistleblower re-
wards from 25 to 30 percent, and it sets 
a 10-percent base minimum on rewards 
to ensure that if the government col-
lects as a result of the whistleblower’s 
disclosure, the whistleblower isn’t left 
holding the short end of the stick. It 
also establishes a funding mechanism 
to ensure that the Treasury Depart-
ment has funds readily available to pay 
whistleblowers independent of congres-
sional appropriations. 
These improvements will ensure that 
whistleblowers have the confidence to 
come forward and assist law enforce-
ment in cracking down on money laun-
dering. 
The bill also expands the whistle-
blower disclosures that are eligible for 
the award. Current whistleblower laws 
don’t offer anything to whistleblowers 
who report violations of sanctions 
against individuals. That would include 
sanctions placed on Russian oligarchs 
following Putin’s unprovoked invasion 
of Ukraine. That is a missed oppor-
tunity. I have it on good authority that 
there are some whistleblowers who 
might have come forward to report 
sanction violations associated with the 
Russians if only the reward system 
were in place to cover their disclosure. 
My bill fills the gap by expanding the 
list of covered disclosures to include 
sanctions violations. 
Another bill which I am introducing 
this week strengthens the FBI whistle-
blower protections. For years, the FBI 
has argued that the FBI and the Jus-
tice Department should retain tight 
control over FBI whistleblower-retalia-
tion cases. The FBI has its own sepa-
rate whistleblower law that leaves au-
thority for settling FBI whistleblower- 
retaliation complaints to the FBI and 
to the Department of Justice. 
The bill that I introduce will allow 
FBI employees to appeal their whistle-
blower retaliation cases to the Merit 
Systems Protection Board. This bill 
gives them outside review by a neutral 
third party. The bill also includes a 
kickout provision. That will mean 
that, if the FBI doesn’t act in a timely 
manner, the whistleblower can take 
their cases straight to the Merit Sys-
tems Protection Board. 
This bipartisan bill is cosponsored by 
Senators 
DURBIN, 
HAWLEY, 
WHITE-
HOUSE, and BLACKBURN. I want to 
thank each of those cosponsors for 
their support. 
Those are just two of several legisla-
tive initiatives before Congress that 
will ensure whistleblowers remain pro-
tected. I urge Congress to consider and 
pass this legislation before the end of 
the year. Support for whistleblowers is 
something that we can all get behind. 
It can and should unite every Member 
of the Congress who believes govern-
ment needs to remain transparent and 
accountable to people. This week, I en-
courage my fellow Senators to remem-
ber that important fact. 
Let’s renew our shared commitment 
to strengthening the Nation’s whistle-
blower laws by taking up and passing 
this important whistleblower legisla-
tion. 
H.R. 4346 
Madam President, now on another 
subject—and it is the subject that is 
before the Senate right now that I as-
sume will be brought up for final ac-
tion yet this week—which is the vote 
on a stripped-down China competition 
package. 
Now, gone is language combating 
China’s unfair trade practices. Gone 
are provisions preventing fentanyl and 
narcotics from entering the country. 
Gone is my proposal to stop subsidizing 
China through the low-cost World 
Bank loans. Gone are provisions that I 
championed preventing the flood of 
counterfeit Chinese merchandise. And 
gone are condemnations of the Chinese 
Communist Party for the ongoing 
genocide of the Uighur minority. 
Last year, I supported an earlier 
version of this bill, in large part be-
cause it included these very tough-on- 
China policies that I just mentioned 
are missing from this piece of legisla-
tion that the Senate will soon be vot-
ing on. But now these policies are out, 
and more spending is in. 
It includes more than $76 billion of 
subsidies earmarked for a single indus-
try: the semiconductor manufacturers. 
Semiconductors, or chips, are impor-
tant, but that doesn’t mean that we 
should write these companies a blank 
check. If incentives to encourage more 
semiconductor 
investment 
in 
the 
United States are necessary, they 
should be targeted. 
I understand the national security 
concerns, but simply mentioning the 
words ‘‘national security’’ isn’t the end 
of the discussion. 
Proponents must show how these 
subsidies will accomplish their objec-
tives. These subsidies are not targeted 
at domestic production of the advanced 
chips produced almost exclusively by 
our allies in Asia. Furthermore, these 
subsidies fail to include adequate safe-
guards to prevent companies receiving 
subsidies from turning around and— 
you know what?—possibly investing in 
China. 
A lot has changed since Congress 
began talking about these subsidies 
more than a year ago, and the Senate 
passed this bill a long, long time ago. 
According to a recent Wall Street 
Journal editorial, the semiconductor 
industry has already announced $80 bil-
lion of U.S. investment by 2025. More-
over, there is growing evidence that a 
chip glut is down the road, coming 
along. 
Yet, instead of looking to trim back 
or better target the subsidies, this bill 
actually doubles down on corporate 
welfare. This bill now includes an ex-
pansive tax credit that will subsidize 
semiconductor manufacturers to the 
tune of about $24 billion. 
In total, American taxpayers will pay 
up to 40 percent of the cost of a semi-
conductor facility. That means indi-
vidual companies are in line to receive 
billions in taxpayer funds. For exam-
ple, Intel has announced plans for a $20 
billion facility. Taxpayers will write a 
check from a low of $4 billion to pos-
sibly a high of an $8 billion check for 
this one facility. 
I am dumbfounded that my Demo-
cratic colleagues can justify this, and I 
say that because President Biden and 
his allies in Congress rant and rave 
about profitable corporations paying 
little or no tax. And yet, under this 
bill, some of the largest and most prof-
itable companies in the world are 
poised to pay zero tax. 
In fact, unlike typical tax credits 
that reduce a company’s tax bill, this 
one will allow a company to receive 
the credit as a cash payment, exceed-
ing any taxes that that company might 
pay. 
Outside of Senator SANDERS, Senate 
Democrats 
seem 
very 
unconcerned 
with making these large profitable cor-
porations—as you hear them say all 
the time—‘‘pay their fair share.’’ 
I hope that they keep this in mind 
when liberal groups inevitably point to 
more profitable multinationals not 
paying taxes. Don’t try then and blame 
Republicans or the 2017 tax bill, which 
has resulted in record revenues coming 
into the Federal Treasury. In fact, the 
2017 tax bill should be the model for 
how we should be competing with 
China. Instead of targeting specific in-
dustries for lavish subsidies, we re-
formed our Tax Code to eliminate spe-
cial interest loopholes while helping all 
industries compete on a global scale, 
including against China. 
A competitive tax code, pro-growth 
policies, and rule of law allow Ameri-
cans to do what Americans do best, and 
that is innovate. That is how we will 
outcompete China. 
In contrast, onshoring wasteful and 
inefficient Chinese industrial policies 
will only stifle innovation and weaken 
our dynamic economy, which is our 
great advantage.

I suggest the absence of a quorum.

AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

thought that the Republicans wanted 
to cut taxes, but when it comes to 
American families’ health insurance, 
they want to raise taxes. Now, why?

July 26, 2022 
Obama who came up with the ACA— 
the Affordable Care Act—where mil-
lions of Americans have access to 
health insurance—affordable health in-
surance—35 million, 1 out of 10 Ameri-
cans. 
But in the efforts of the Republicans 
to end the Affordable Care Act, they 
are basically trying everything. There 
was a time when there was this his-
toric, tension-filled moment on the 
floor when three Republican Senators 
saved the Affordable Care Act. Sen-
ators MURKOWSKI, COLLINS, and John 
McCain—and I will still remember that 
image as long as I am alive—walked on 
the floor and saved the Affordable Care 
Act. 
But ever since then, the Republicans 
have been trying to do away with it 
every way they can think of. There are 
millions of Americans who have better 
health insurance because of the Afford-
able Care Act. They cannot be denied 
coverage because of a preexisting con-
dition. They don’t have annual or life-
time limits on coverage. They have 
free preventive healthcare, and young 
adults can stay on their parents’ plans 
until they have reached the age of 26— 
all positive things, wildly popular. 
Still the Republicans resist the idea 
that this is going to be the law of the 
land, if they have anything to say 
about it. 
There is no disputing that ACA is one 
of the greatest public policy accom-
plishments of a lifetime. But as I men-
tioned, this lifesaving policy is once 
again under threat from the Repub-
licans. Why? 
Last year, Congress passed and Presi-
dent Biden signed into law the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan, which, among other 
things, made ACA health plans more 
widely available and more affordable 
for millions of Americans. 
That package increased the size of 
ACA’s tax credit, which eliminated or 
reduced out-of-pocket premiums for 
millions of people. 
It also expanded eligibility, so that 
more lower- and middle-income Ameri-
cans are now eligible for tax credits. 
As a result of these improvements, a 
record 
14-and-a-half 
million 
people 
signed up for the ACA plans during the 
2022 open enrollment period. And I un-
derstand nearly one-third of these en-
rollees found a plan that costs $10 per 
month or less. 
Millions of enrollees selected a plan 
that didn’t cost anything. In the midst 
of this once-in-a-century pandemic, the 
American Rescue Plan provided fami-
lies across the Nation with peace of 
mind that they have continued access 
to health insurance. 
Here is the problem: If Congress 
doesn’t do something—and soon—these 
enhancements lowering the cost of pre-
miums for American families will end. 
That causes millions of people to lose 
their health insurance or to have to 
pay more. 
If you are in a time of inflation, 
where the cost of living is going up, 
wouldn’t you want to be on the train 
that says ‘‘lower health insurance pre-
miums’’? The Democrats are. The Re-
publicans are not. 
Millions of people will either lose 
their insurance or pay more if we don’t 
do something. Not one single Repub-
lican Senator will join in our efforts, 
but those families in every State are 
going to be benefited by this. 
Let’s not forget how hard Republican 
Senators have fought to come down on 
the side of insurance companies and 
take away health insurance for Ameri-
cans. It has been their top priority for 
decades. 
So it falls on Democrats, once again, 
to fix this problem. And fix it we must. 
It is my understanding that all 50 
Democratic Senators are on board with 
providing a multiyear extension of 
these ACA tax credits. I know that 
House Democrats are with us. 
Let us get it done soon by August 
when insurers start notifying cus-
tomers of their 2023 premiums. People 
nationwide have a lot on their plates 
these days, from rising costs to fears of 
gun violence to increasing COVID cases 
to new restrictions on women’s rights. 
Let us not add to the burden of tax- 
paying families by hiking their health 
insurance premiums next year. The 
Democrats want to fix it. We invite the 
Republicans, who give many speeches 
on the cost of living for families, to 
join us. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kentucky. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST 
Mr. PAUL. Over 6 million people died 
worldwide from COVID; over a million 
Americans died from COVID. 
Last year, we passed unanimously an 
amendment I had to ban any U.S. tax 
dollars from going to Wuhan, China, to 
the lab. There was a great deal of evi-
dence that this pandemic arose out of 
the lab. 
Gain-of-function research enhances 
the severity of transmissibility of ex-
isting viruses that may infect humans. 
The dangers are so acute that, from 
2014 to 2017, the National Institutes of 
Health suspended funding for all gain- 
of-function projects. 
The emergence of COVID serves as a 
reminder that this dangerous research, 
conducted in a secretive and totali-
tarian country, is simply too risky to 
fund. 
I, therefore, ask my colleagues to re-
store this crucial provision that would 
prohibit the funding of gain-of-function 
research in China. 
I ask unanimous consent that it be in 
order to call up my amendment No. 
5159. I further ask that there be 30 min-
utes of debate, equally divided between 
the two leaders or their designees; and, 
finally, that upon the use or yielding 
back of that time, the Senate vote on 
adoption of my amendment with no in-
tervening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Washington. 
Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, 
reserving the right to object, no one 
could be more disappointed than my-
self in the fact that we don’t have a 
conference report before us at this 
point in time. 
With so many different committees 
and the four corners working to resolve 
so many issues, I had hoped that we 
would get over the goal line and be 
here with that conference report. 
Unfortunately, events overtook us 
and objectives of the calendar and a va-
riety of issues that narrowed the dis-
cussion we have before us today to two 
focus points: one, the Science Commit-
tee’s work with the Commerce Com-
mittee in the Senate and language that 
basically would incent the semicon-
ductor industry. 
And our colleagues voted to proceed 
on those two measures, and there was a 
lot of discussion on what the definition 
of a ‘‘skinny bill’’ was. Not sure, ex-
actly—I mean, I know a lot of the 
events that got us to that discussion. 
But I will say to my colleague that 
he is correct. When USICA left the U.S. 
Senate, it included this language, and 
this language was very much debated 
in conference, and it was part of the ju-
risdiction of several committees, but 
primarily the HELP Committee, whose 
content is now not part of the legisla-
tion we are considering. 
So I am hopeful that we will get 
those committees that have jurisdic-
tion over this language to rectify their 
differences between the House and the 
Senate, but that is what four corners 
is. It is rectifying these issues between 
the House and the Senate, and I hope 
that my colleague will work with me 
on a conference that will continue 
after this point. 
I hope that we get this legislation 
done, and then I hope that we literally 
return to finish up the rest of the con-
ference work because there are so 
many important issues, like this, that 
we should include in the legislation. 
So I hope my colleague will continue 
to work with us, knowing that these 
are not all of the issues that had been 
discussed, but a more narrow issue. 
So, therefore, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MUR-
PHY). Objection is heard. 
The Senator from Ohio. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I am 
coming to the floor today to offer a 
very 
straightforward, 
commonsense 
amendment that is noncontroversial, 
that has met all of the requirements 
set out by the Democratic leadership— 
by the majority leader—by the chair of 
the conference, and by the ranking 
member of the conference to be accept-
ed. This is language that must accom-
pany the research dollars that are part 
of the CHIPS+ legislation that we are 
considering right now. 
When you add it all up, when you add 
up CHIPS and the CHIPS+ language, 
which includes research dollars to 
NSF, NIH, Department of Energy, and 
so on, we are talking about $200 billion 
of taxpayer money. 
As part of this process, when we 
passed the underlying bill, USICA, here

July 26, 2022 
in the U.S. Senate, we included lan-
guage that said: You know what, we 
ought to protect that language. We 
ought to protect that research. 
It is like we are buying a really ex-
pensive new car, and if we don’t protect 
it, it means we are not buying the in-
surance that goes with it. The insur-
ance is needed for a very simple reason: 
We know that for the past two decades, 
that U.S. taxpayer-paid research—just 
like the research that we are about to 
both appropriate and authorize in this 
legislation—has been subject to being 
taken by our adversaries, particularly 
China. So that is why we need to pro-
tect it. 
We worked painstakingly over the 
last 4 years on a bipartisan basis to 
come up with this legislation. Again, it 
has been fully vetted. 
There was discussion a moment ago 
about the four corners. What does that 
mean? That means that the chair and 
ranking members of the committees of 
jurisdiction—the 
four 
corners—are 
asked to approve anything that goes 
into this legislation. 
Well, everything I am going to talk 
about today is approved by the four 
corners. 
By the way, everything that is in the 
underlying legislation—some of the 
plus in the CHIPS+ Act—has not gone 
through the four corners process. This 
has. 
To my colleagues who say: Well, if we 
put this amendment in, how about 
these other amendments? Look, I have 
five or six things in the USICA bill I 
would love to have be part of this final 
agreement. I have wonderful trade leg-
islation that should be part of this. It 
is not. That is with Senator BROWN, by 
the way. I have wonderful legislation 
that deals with worker retraining that 
is absolutely related to competitive-
ness. That is with Senator KAINE. It 
should absolutely be part of this final 
agreement. It is not. I get that. There 
are a lot of things that had to be left 
out when this conference did not suc-
ceed, 
even 
though 
I, 
like 
others, 
worked very hard to get that con-
ference to come to agreement—not just 
in my areas. I am the ranking member 
on the Homeland Security Committee. 
We cleared all of ours but also worked 
with other committees and other Mem-
bers, Republican and Democrat alike. 
But I said from the start that we 
have to have this research security lan-
guage in place if we are going to put 
out billions of dollars of new taxpayer 
dollars in terms of research; otherwise, 
it is irresponsible. 
So the amendment I am offering 
today is a skinnied-down version of 
what passed in USICA already. It is a 
skinnied-down version of what I was 
proposing because some people thought 
there were some concerns in the 
House—actually among Republicans, 
interestingly—about some of these as-
pects, so we have just taken those out. 
We 
have 
made 
this 
totally 
non-
controversial. Four corners. Fits like a 
glove with what we are talking about, 
which is the new research dollars. That 
is what this is all about. 
It should not be surprising that there 
is a lot of bipartisan support for this. 
There has been from the start. Why? 
Because everybody knows this is a 
grave threat to our national security if 
we do not protect American research. 
The Director of the FBI, Christopher 
Wray, recently warned: 
The greatest long-term threat to our na-
tion’s information and intellectual property, 
and to our economic vitality, is the counter-
intelligence and economic espionage threat 
from China. It’s a threat to our economic se-
curity—and by extension, to our national se-
curity. 
He characterized China as the largest 
threat to ‘‘our ideas, our innovation, 
and our economic security.’’ He noted 
that the FBI now has over 2,000 open 
cases focused on China, with a new case 
being opened approximately every 12 
hours. This is reality. This is what is 
happening right now. 
After our bipartisan investigation, 
we had a hearing. The FBI showed up, 
and we said: Do you know what? We 
have learned in our investigation the 
shocking news that for two decades 
China has been systematically tar-
geting the best American researchers 
and the best American research to be 
able to take that research, leapfrog us, 
and it has helped to create an ascended 
China—the rise of their military and 
their economic progress—by taking our 
research, taxpayer-paid. 
The FBI, testifying, said: Do you 
know what? You are right. We have 
kind of been asleep at the switch, and 
we are going to change that. And they 
have, and that is why you have seen 
many, many arrests being made. But 
they said to us: We need some legisla-
tion. We need a cause of action that ac-
tually fits what is going on here be-
cause there is not one now. We have to 
come up with other ways, like mail 
fraud or other—tax evasion or other 
ways to bring people to justice. That is 
what this legislation does. 
We also heard from the State Depart-
ment, and this was career people at the 
State Department, including now in 
the Biden State Department. They des-
perately want new authority to be able 
to avoid people coming into our coun-
try to steal our technology. They des-
perately want it, and that is part of 
this legislation today. 
We found out that China uses these 
so-called 
talent 
recruitment 
pro-
grams—the most prominent one, you 
have heard of, probably; it is the Thou-
sand Talents Plan—to target science 
and technology sectors just like the 
ones we are funding. They target aca-
demics, scientists, engineers, entre-
preneurs, and finance experts. The 
plans provide monetary benefits and 
other incentives to lure experts into 
providing proprietary information or 
research to China, in violation of our 
laws and conflict of interest rules. 
Again, the cases go on and on. 
China, in turn, exploits American re-
search, intellectual property, and open 
collaboration for their own benefit— 
again, often U.S. taxpayer-funded. 
In just one of many, many cases, a 
chemist was sentenced recently by a 
Federal judge in Tennessee after being 
convicted of conspiracy to commit 
trade secret theft, possession of stolen 
trade secrets, economic espionage, and 
wire fraud. The chemist received mil-
lions of dollars in Chinese Government 
grants, including a Thousand Talents 
Plan award, to steal American innova-
tion to fund the rise of China’s econ-
omy. 
This is just one of the researchers we 
have been able to stop. Think of how 
many have slipped through the cracks 
since we have not yet implemented the 
grant and visa reforms included in this 
amendment I am offering today. 
In fact, the Department of Health 
and Human Services’ IG recently re-
leased a report that found that more 
than two-thirds of the National Insti-
tutes of Health’s grant recipients failed 
to meet the Federal requirements re-
garding foreign financial interests, in-
cluding instances of U.S. taxpayer- 
funded researchers failing to disclose 
ties to the Chinese Government. That 
is NIH. We are funding NIH through 
this—some of this money is going to go 
to the NIH. Yet we are not providing 
the protection to keep this from hap-
pening. 
The skinnied-down version of the 
amendment today goes directly to the 
root of the problem. It is the minimum 
we have to do. 
First, the amendment makes it pun-
ishable by law to knowingly fail to dis-
close foreign funding on Federal grant 
applications. 
Researchers should not be able to lie 
to grant-making Agencies about the 
money they receive from our adver-
saries. Pretty simple. Who could be 
against that? 
Second, it allows the State Depart-
ment to deny visas to foreign research-
ers coming to the United States to ex-
ploit the openness of our research en-
terprise. 
Currently, the State Department can 
deny a visa to a foreign researcher they 
know is coming here to steal export- 
controlled technology, but what if that 
technology someone is coming to steal 
is not export-controlled? How about ar-
tificial intelligence? How about quan-
tum computing? Well, if you can be-
lieve it, in that case, the State Depart-
ment’s hands are tied even though they 
know it is happening. 
This amendment gives the Biden 
State Department the authority they 
have sought from Congress to deny 
visas to those seeking to come to the 
United States expressly to steal our 
emerging technology. Sometimes they 
are members of the Chinese Com-
munist Party. Sometimes they are 
members of the Chinese military. Yet 
they cannot stop them. 
As we know, there are more provi-
sions in the full Safeguarding Amer-
ican Innovation Act, but again, after 
talking to my colleagues, I agreed to

S3677 
July 26, 2022 
scale back the amendment. Doing so 
will ensure our research is protected 
and guarantee its passage in the House. 
These provisions reached four corners 
agreement in the conference, as I said, 
and include additional changes beyond 
that made at the request of everybody 
who had any objection, including the 
Congressional Asian Pacific American 
Caucus. We solved their issues. 
This skinny version of the Securing 
American Innovation Act is a signifi-
cant concession, and I urge my col-
leagues to respect the fact that we 
spent years going through this and, 
more recently, hours to deal with 
everybody’s issues to meet them more 
than halfway. 
I will remind many of my colleagues 
in this Chamber, they voted to begin 
consideration of the CHIPS package 
last week because they believed this 
language was in the bipartisan pro-
posal. I know that because Democrats 
and Republicans alike have come up to 
me and said that. I thought your lan-
guage was in there, they said. Why 
wouldn’t we want to protect this re-
search, they said. 
One reason they think it is in there 
is because all Republican offices, at 
least, were told that it was in there. In 
fact, the email sent right after the vote 
late on Tuesday afternoon reiterated 
that these provisions were included. So 
the whip that we sent out—the whip in-
formation on what was in this legisla-
tion included the Safeguarding Amer-
ican Innovation Act. That is how we 
got the necessary Republican votes. 
Now, I support the underlying bill, 
and I have restrained myself and shown 
respect for the process by helping to 
get us to the point we are today. But 
my understanding was that people 
would work with me to ensure that we 
were able, if it was four corners, to be 
sure that, again, this insurance on this 
new car that we are buying would be 
there. 
It fits like a glove. This is where the 
legislation must be included. If not, we 
find ourselves irresponsibly spending 
taxpayer dollars that are not pro-
tected. So we are going to invest about 
200 to 250 billion hard-working Amer-
ican-taxpayer dollars in research and 
innovation. 
Again, I support the underlying bill, 
but we have got to protect that intel-
lectual property, that taxpayer-funded 
research, from being stolen by our 
competitors and used against us. With-
out these protections, I believe this 
legislative package, with significant 
levels of Federal funding, is a giveaway 
to some of our adversaries, including 
Beijing. It is not like there is any se-
cret out there. China has made no se-
cret of its goal to supplant the United 
States as the global economic leader 
and to do it by getting the best re-
search and the best researchers. 
Today, we released a report on how 
China has also targeted the U.S. Fed-
eral Reserve in addition to our science 
and innovation. Our economic policies 
are in China’s crosshairs now, and this 
body cannot stand idly by and allow it 
to continue. We must act, and that 
means including, at a minimum, this 
skinny version of the Safeguarding 
American Innovation Act’s provisions. 
Failure to do so will harm our national 
security and our economic strength in 
the face of an ascendant China. 
To my colleagues, please do not 
block this very simple request. We 
have done everything right. We have 
gone through the process of a bipar-
tisan investigation, of bipartisan hear-
ings, bipartisan legislation, and four 
corners agreements—working with ev-
erybody to address their concerns—and 
this is where this legislation must be. 
Again, I have four or five other very 
important bills in USICA that I am not 
asking for today because they don’t fit 
perfectly 
with 
this 
new 
research 
money; but this does, and it has to be 
there. So I ask unanimous consent. 
That is all I need. With unanimous con-
sent, the Senate can do anything, to 
include what everybody says they 
want, what everybody says is impor-
tant. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that it be in order to call up my 
amendment No. 5158. I ask further that 
there be 30 minutes of debate, equally 
divided between the two leaders or 
their designees, and finally, upon the 
use or yielding back of that time, that 
the Senate vote on the adoption of my 
amendment with no intervening action 
or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Washington. 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, in 
reserving the right to object, I say to 
my colleague from Ohio that I know 
how hard he and Senator PETERS from 
the 
Homeland 
Security 
Committee 
have worked on this language. I know 
because I have consulted with them 
many times over the last month and a 
half, wondering about its progress and 
wondering about various issues involv-
ing people on both sides of the aisle to 
resolve what they were concerned 
about in definitions. I, too, felt like the 
Senators’ hard work and language had 
gotten to a point where it could be in-
cluded in a package of legislation. 
We were very, very hopeful that the 
various committees’ work—that of the 
Finance Committee, the Foreign Af-
fairs 
Committee, 
the 
HELP 
Com-
mittee—the Health, Education, Labor, 
and Pensions Committee—the Intel 
Committee work, and the work that we 
just discussed from the Homeland Se-
curity Committee—could all be in-
cluded in a conference report. So the 
words ‘‘pins down’’ did not come from 
my side of the aisle. The words ‘‘pins 
down’’ did not happen. For me, I have 
been 
doing 
nothing 
but 
diligently 
working with all of my colleagues— 
most of the time when they don’t 
agree—in trying to get them to agree. 
I very much appreciate the subject at 
the heart of what Senator PORTMAN’s 
work is. He is trying to say to us that 
we have to understand the reality of 
the world that we live in now and make 
sure that we are protecting all of our 
research dollars as we move forward. 
Again, it wasn’t my decision to de-
cide the narrowness of this bill. It 
wasn’t my decision to say that these 
are the two subject areas that people 
are going to include. I know because I 
thanked the Senator for his help in 
getting the Science Committee’s legis-
lation included in this package. But 
you could see that even that was a very 
tough lift in that there were a lot of 
people around here who didn’t want to 
do that. 
So I say to my colleague from Ohio 
that I am going to work with him in 
whatever capacity to get this language 
accepted. 
Now he is saying that he has stream-
lined this language from, probably, 
what the four corners has agreed to. I 
do know that the Senator worked very 
hard trying to get a four-corner agree-
ment from the Science Committee, 
which we didn’t have, to include this 
language. And why? Because there had 
been a big fight in the House between 
the 
Science 
Committee 
and 
their 
Homeland Security Committee about 
what this language said. Then you had 
the Judiciary Committee weighing in 
in both the House and the Senate as to 
what this language said. Since all of 
those people have been part of that dis-
cussion, that part of the four corners 
did not happen. 
My colleague is earnest, and his work 
is real. The reports that he is referring 
to in the Homeland Security Com-
mittee are real, and we should honor 
them and honor that work. I am com-
mitted to getting that legislation 
passed, and we will confer with the 
Senator from Ohio about where that 
goes and if it goes in the conference re-
port because I am committed to fin-
ishing the conference report, because 
as I said, the Finance Committee, the 
Foreign Affairs Committee, the HELP 
Committee, the Judiciary Committee, 
and your Homeland Security Com-
mittee—five committees—would still 
all like to have language as part of this 
conference report. 
While we aren’t able to cover every 
aspect of this jurisdiction, I am very 
hopeful that our colleagues will take 
the impetus of this legislation’s pass-
ing and double down on getting the 
rest of the conference report done and 
signed and on the President’s desk. 
Then we will have a robust policy, not 
just the incentives, not just the R&D 
but a variety of issues addressed as 
they relate to our competitiveness. 
So I will continue to work with my 
colleague from Ohio on this important 
language and with all of my colleagues 
on those various committees who have 
asserted their interest on this subject, 
but at this time, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Washington.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
The Senator from Florida. 
H.R. 4346 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
Florida families hear a lot of talk up 
here in Washington about inflation. 
Right now, inflation is raging over 9 
percent across America. 
I was warning about the coming in-
flation crisis back in February of last 
year, but now basically everyone in the 
Senate—Republicans 
and 
Democrats 
alike—have joined me in talking about 
just how horrific this is for families in 
each of our States. 
In Florida, inflation is costing fami-
lies nearly $800 more every month. 
Imagine being a family on a fixed in-
come and having to pay double rent 
each month or adding a luxury car pay-
ment to your monthly expenses. That 
is essentially what families in my 
State are dealing with since Joe Biden 
took office. 
It is a new tax on families at every 
income level, a tax created by the 
sheer incompetence of Joe Biden. It 
hurts our poorest families—like mine 
growing up—the very most. 
Now, we know what causes this infla-
tion. It is reckless government spend-
ing. On this side of the political aisle, 
we aren’t afraid to tell this truth, but 
our Democratic colleagues, with the 
exception of one or two, won’t do it. 
It is fine. You would probably imag-
ine that, in a 50–50 Senate, we would 
still be able to hold the line and stop 
reckless spending in its tracks. Nope, 
not in broken Washington. Here in 
Washington, the only thing we can 
seem to get bipartisan consensus on is 
digging America deeper and deeper into 
debt. It happens again and again. And 
with each dollar of debt and each new 
round of reckless spending, we throw 
gasoline on the raging inflation fire 
burning across America. 
As I speak here now, it is about to 
happen again. This week, the Senate 
will very likely pass the so-called 
China bill that spends $280 billion we 
don’t have. We are not burning our sav-
ings here; we are borrowing $280 billion 
to do this. 
This is why the American people hate 
Congress. They see politicians stand up 
in their neighborhoods and pledge to 
fight the waste in Washington and then 
watch as those same politicians be-
come the very problem they vowed to 
fix. It is disgusting, and it is happening 
up here all the time. 
So let’s talk about this bill that we 
are set to vote on this week. Demo-
crats and some Republicans will sug-
gest that it will help combat the 
threats we face from Beijing. There is 
just one problem. This bill doesn’t help 
us combat communist China at all. 
On Monday of last week, this bill 
cost $76 billion and was 73 pages long. 
Two 
days 
later, 
Senator 
SCHUMER 
turned it into a $250 billion version. 
Now it is more than 1,000 pages, a $280 
billion monster chock-full of reckless 
spending and bad policy that gives Joe 
Biden a wide-open door to push his rad-
ical policies. 
The bill ballooned in size and price 
because 
CHUCK
SCHUMER—Senator 
SCHUMER—inserted massive slush funds 
for the National Science Foundation. 
This same entity has burned billions of 
taxpayer dollars on insane projects like 
creating a towel-folding robot or study-
ing how shrimp run on treadmills. I 
wish I was making this up, but I am 
not. 
This 
bill 
doubles 
the 
National 
Science Foundation’s budget over the 
next 5 years and gives millions to uni-
versities that already have a problem 
with spies from communist China 
stealing intellectual property and data. 
Does the bill increase protections to 
stop this or better protect tax dollars? 
No. 
No wonder the debt is surging over 
$30 trillion and inflation is over 9 per-
cent. Washington is broken. It just 
can’t stop wasting your money. 
So what else does this bill do? A huge 
part of it is a massive giveaway to 
chipmakers like Intel. You know Intel, 
the 
world’s 
largest 
semiconductor 
maker that saw $20 billion in profit 
last year and paid its CEO $180 million. 
They are not exactly struggling these 
days, but politicians in Washington 
want to give them billions of your 
money with no strings attached. 
There are no requirements to see a 
return on investment. There are no 
provisions to claw back dollars if they 
don’t do what they are supposed to do. 
There is nothing for accountability. 
What 
is 
worse, 
these 
large 
chipmakers have lobbied hard to weak-
en the bill so they can keep doing busi-
ness in communist China. And—guess 
what—Washington caved, and they got 
exactly what they wanted. Massive, 
multibillion-dollar corporations like 
Intel will get Americans’ hard-earned 
tax dollars to build manufacturing 
plants, get tax writeoffs for those 
plants, and get a tax credit. These 
chipmakers are getting paid three ways 
with your tax money, and they will 
still be allowed to work and expand in 
communist China. 
There is nothing stopping them from 
moving funds around to increase their 
business in communist China or any 
other market, for that matter. There is 
no requirement for them to build a cer-
tain number of plants here in the 
United States. There are no quotas 
that they need to hit so Americans can 
be sure we never have to rely on risky 
supply chains. 
And even if communist China invades 
Taiwan, which supplies nearly two- 
thirds of all the world’s semiconduc-
tors, the companies that get your tax 
dollars in this bill will still be allowed 
to operate in communist China while 
receiving your money. 
This bill isn’t anti-China; it is pro- 
China. It is going to cause more infla-
tion, more debt, and create more defi-
cits. There is absolutely no account-
ability. It doesn’t make any sense. 
Now, there is a heck of a lot we can 
do to reshore our supply chains and en-
sure Chinese spies don’t steal our tech-
nology, all things this bill purports to 
do but doesn’t. 
For more than a year now, I have 
been fighting this bloated bill while at 
the same time introducing other legis-
lation with my colleagues to economi-
cally decouple from communist China, 
strengthen our defense networks, and 
stand up to Xi Jinping’s abuses. 
We all want to solve problems. I want 
to solve problems. I am open to good 
investments. They have to be done 
with accountability to the American 
people. That is why I introduced an 
amendment to this bill to ensure that 
no tax dollars are going to go to ben-
efit communist China. 
My amendment would do four things. 
First, my amendment would eliminate 
all the exemptions that are currently 
in the bill that allow semiconductor 
companies who take U.S. taxpayer dol-
lars to expand and continue their oper-
ations in communist China. Money is 
fungible, and we should make perfectly 
clear that these American tax dollars 
should only be benefiting Americans. 
Some have called this a national se-
curity investment. If that is true, then 
we should make sure it builds up Amer-
ican security, not communist China’s. 
Second, my amendment will require 
the Secretary of Commerce to certify 
to Congress that the Department has 
completed 
a 
return-on-investment 
analysis of a proposed grant. That an-
nouncement must show the grant will 
be a net positive for taxpayers and pre-
vent distribution of that grant until 
the Secretary certifies the analysis and 
makes it public. 
In business and in government, I 
have made countless deals. I never 
want to make an investing deal when I 
am unsure whether I am getting a re-
turn on my money. Americans under-
stand this. If we are going to be invest-
ing taxpayers’ dollars, we need to make 
smart investments that will get a real 
return.

three-part agreement with the Com-
merce Secretary specifying that they 
will, one, not engage in any trans-
action involving the expansion of chip 
manufacturing capacity in communist 
China; two, refuse to cooperate with 
the Communist Chinese Government 
moving forward; three, commit to im-
mediately ceasing all operations in 
communist China if it invades Taiwan. 
As I mentioned before, the bill in its 
current form does nothing to stop 
chipmakers from expanding operations 
in communist China and has loads of 
exceptions specifically allowing these 
companies to keep working there. That 
is insane. We should not allow it. 
If people want to call this an anti- 
China bill, then let’s make it an anti- 
China bill and stop doing business in 
communist China. 
Fourth, my amendment will ensure 
that all U.S. tax dollars are clawed 
back if any company breaks that three- 
part agreement with the Commerce 
Secretary, and it would require the 
Commerce Secretary to ensure that the 
company will repay the money if they 
break the agreement. If you break a 
contract, there are consequences. Ev-
eryone knows this, and it is crazy that 
this bill doesn’t already have those 
provisions in it. 
If we don’t change this bill, a vote for 
this bill is a vote for higher inflation. 
It is a vote to help communist China 
and a vote to add to our already $30 
trillion debt. 
My amendment isn’t controversial. 
This is commonsense stuff. It will im-
prove the bill and add the kinds of safe-
guards Americans should expect from 
legislators handling their hard-earned 
tax dollars. We are a fiduciary for the 
American taxpayer. 
Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem like 
the Democratic majority leader is in-
terested in having a vote on my com-
monsense 
amendment, 
but 
that 
shouldn’t surprise the American public. 
They have come to expect this sort of 
dysfunction under Democratic leader-
ship. 
The Democrats love to pretend that 
they are fighting against corporate 
special interests, but what the major-
ity leader is pushing forward right now 
is one of the grossest gifts to corporate 
America I have ever seen. The families 
in each of our States deserve and ex-
pect better than what this delivers. 
Our Nation is in the midst of a his-
toric inflation crisis that is destroying 
the dreams and hard-earned savings of 
millions of families across our country. 
Our answer to that crisis cannot be to 
throw gasoline on the fire and walk 
away. We can and must do more to 
combat the threats posed by com-
munist China. 
Members of this body, on both sides 
of the aisle, have great ideas that can 
do that, but this bill isn’t one of them. 
I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill 
or, at a minimum, join me in demand-
ing that my amendment be adopted so 
we can better protect the massive 
amount of tax dollars being spent here. 
I also urge my colleagues not to turn 
a blind eye to the new debt this bill 
creates. As I said earlier, this bill bor-
rows $280 billion we don’t have. We 
have to stop this. 
That is why I am raising a budget 
point of order. When we keep bor-
rowing and spending money we don’t 
have, it is terrible for our country and 
our families. A vote to waive my point 
of order is a vote to approve more debt, 
which means more inflation. 
POINT OF ORDER 
Mr. President, the pending measure, 
Senate amendment No. 5135, violates 
section 404(a) of S. Con. Res. 13 of the 
111th Congress, the fiscal year 2010 
budget resolution, as amended by S. 
Con. Res. 11 of the 114th Congress, be-
cause it would increase the short-term 
debt by more than $10 billion in one or 
more of the fiscal years that comprise 
the current budget window. 
Therefore, I raise a point of order 
against this measure pursuant to sec-
tion 404(a) of Sen. Con. Res. 13, the fis-
cal year 2010 concurrent resolution on 
the budget.

TRIBUTE TO GENERAL JOSEPH M. MARTIN 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I rise 
today to recognize the service, accom-
plishments, and retirement of Michi-
gan native GEN Joseph M. Martin. 
Joe will pass on the mantle of leader-
ship after 36 years of service and com-
pletes his highly decorated career as 
the Vice Chief of Staff of the U.S. 
Army. 
Joe is a proud son of Michigan. Born 
and raised in Royal Oak and Dearborn, 
his family is deeply rooted in the area, 
with strong ties to the Ford Motor 
Company. Joe’s grandfather, Leonard 
Martin, worked there for 43 years. 
Joe’s 
father, 
Leonard 
Martin 
Jr., 
worked there for 42 years. 
It was from his father and grand-
father that General Martin learned the 
Michigan values of honesty, hard work, 
and service to his community. And it is 
these values that General Martin has 
carried with him throughout his 36 
years in the U.S. Army. 
As a child, Joe attended Henry Ford 
Elementary and Woodworth Junior 
High. Before high school, the Martin 
family moved to the west side of Dear-
born, where Joe attended Clare Bryant 
Junior High and Dearborn High before 
college. 
And although Joe’s family has a tra-
dition steeped in naval aviation, Joe 
took a different path and chose to at-
tend West Point and join the Army. 
General Martin graduated from the 
U.S. Military Academy in 1986 and was 
commissioned as an armor officer. 
Throughout the next 30 years, General 
Martin would serve in support of Amer-
ica’s most significant large-scale oper-
ations and fight in some of the Army’s 
most storied divisions. 
He deployed in support of Operation 
Desert Storm, twice for Operation Iraqi 
Freedom, and as the Combined Joint 
Force Land Component Commander for 
Operation Inherent Resolve. 
Among other assignments, Joe served 
with the 1st Armored Division, the 4th 
Infantry Division, U.S. Army Oper-
ational Test Command, and served as 
the commanding general of the Na-
tional Training Center and the com-
mander of the 1st Infantry Division.

July 26, 2022 
Following his command of the Big 
Red One, General Martin was appointed 
as the Director of Army Staff and later 
confirmed as the Vice Chief of Staff of 
the Army. 
Joe credits his success to his wife, 
Leann; and the Martins have two chil-
dren, Joey and Kylie. 
To General Martin and to his family: 
On behalf of a grateful Nation, thank 
you for your incredible service and sac-
rifice over the last three-and-a-half 
decades. We are glad to welcome you 
back to your home State of Michigan 
as you begin your next chapter. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Minnesota. 
AMERICAN INNOVATION AND CHOICE ONLINE ACT 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I 
rise today to address my colleagues on 
the topic of competition policy, just as 
I did last week, and I will continue to 
do until we take action. 
Now, I want to start out speaking 
briefly about one part of competition 
policy that is very important, and that 
has to do with prescription drugs. 
As we all know, brand-name prescrip-
tion drugs in the U.S. are more than 
250 percent of those in other industri-
alized countries. In many cases, Ameri-
cans pay the highest prices in the 
world for these drugs. Yet it is our 
country, our taxpayers, that have put 
in the money for the research. 
The high price of prescription drugs 
has put treatments out of reach for 
many Americans, even those with in-
surance, and driven up the tab for tax-
payers. 
Examples: One of my constituents, 
Ramae, from Bemidji, was diagnosed in 
2018 with an incurable blood cancer, 
multiple myeloma. She relies on a drug 
called Revlimid that costs about 15,000 
a year. Ramae depleted her life sav-
ings, cashed out her 401(k), and sold her 
house in order to afford this drug she 
needs to survive. 
Actually, nearly 20 percent of older 
adults have reported not taking their 
medicines as prescribed because of the 
cost. 
The good news—and this gets to com-
petition. Years and years ago, as you 
know, Mr. President, the pharma-
ceutical industry installed in law a 
provision 
that 
said 
Medicare 
was 
banned from negotiating less expensive 
prices for drugs—banned from negoti-
ating. 
Yet, we know from the VA, which is 
allowed to negotiate on behalf of our 
Nation’s patriotic veterans, that we 
can get much less expensive but as 
high quality drugs for our veterans. 
Our 46 million seniors deserve the same 
kind of deal. 
That is what we are coming into in 
this next week, finally. And I have led 
the bill that has over 30 cosponsors in 
the Senate to allow for negotiation of 
prescription drugs for a long, long 
time. Finally, we are going to get this 
done. 
It is not going to cover all the drugs 
as I would, but it is a big beginning. We 
have enough votes in the Senate to 
pass a bill to fix that. Democratic 
votes—all Democratic votes. But it is 
the fight worth fighting. You see the 
Pharma ads running against this bill. 
They have got every incentive to stop 
this. Why? 
Well, it is going to save taxpayers 288 
billion over 10 years. Taxpayers are 
going to be able to get that money, in-
stead of the prescription drug compa-
nies. That is why this is so important. 
It is going to allow Medicare to finally 
negotiate prices under Medicare Part 
D. 
In addition to that, it will stop drug 
companies from price gouging drugs 
that are already on the market, stop 
price hikes, and make sure the price of 
your drugs doesn’t increase more than 
the rate of inflation. 
As I said, we have the votes in the 
Senate—all 
Democratic 
votes—to 
make life easier for so many people. We 
stand with AARP. We stand with the 
seniors of this country to finally allow 
Medicare to negotiate less expensive 
drugs for our seniors. 
So that is one part of competition 
policy. That means allowing negotia-
tion. That is part of what competition 
is. But there is something else we need 
to do, and last week I talked about 
what is happening with the tech com-
panies. I talked about the fact that for 
years and years, in the beginning of 
this Nation’s inception, our country 
has always believed in capitalism and 
in a free market, and we have always 
understood that you have got to have 
antitrust laws in place, which I ex-
plained the history last week. Anti-
trust laws, at the time, it got that 
name because it was about breaking up 
trusts. 
Trusts—steel 
trusts, 
copper 
trusts—trusts that controlled the econ-
omy, brought up prices, made it hard 
for individual small businesses to com-
pete. 
And over time, this Senate, this 
Chamber right here, the Senators— 
they finally stopped just doing every-
thing these trusts want. They stopped 
just giving in to the Big Money, and 
they actually did something to protect 
capitalism. That is when they passed 
the Sherman Act. Senator Sherman 
was a Republican from Ohio. They 
passed the Clayton Act. Through his-
tory, rose to the occasion. 
We are at another moment in history 
right now, and that is a moment fo-
cused on too much consolidation in our 
economy. What is at stake is the very 
idea that drives our economy forward— 
competitive markets. 
Today, too many areas of our econ-
omy are highly concentrated and con-
trolled by a few corporations. These 
are the corporations of old. These are 
the trusts of old, but we have our mod-
ern-day ones as well. 
So when this happens, you have a lot 
of problems, and one of them is cor-
porations stop competitors from mov-
ing ahead and from innovating and 
finding better ways to serve customers 
because they have all the customers, so 
they don’t have the incentive. 
We have seen consolidation in every-
thing from cat food to caskets. Our dig-
ital markets are now controlled by a 
few Big Tech titans that have grown 
into the largest corporations the world 
has ever known. 
It is well past time to put some rules 
of the road in place to make sure that 
these dominant digital platforms work 
for consumers and allow American 
small businesses to innovate and com-
pete. 
That is why I have been working 
across the aisle with Senator CHUCK 
GRASSLEY, the Republican lead of this 
bill, and a bipartisan group of Senators 
that Samantha Bee once called an 
‘‘Oceans 11 of cosponsors,’’ including 
Senators DICK DURBIN, LINDSEY GRA-
HAM, RICHARD BLUMENTHAL, JOHN KEN-
NEDY, CORY BOOKER, CYNTHIA LUMMIS, 
MAZIE
HIRONO, MARK
WARNER, JOSH 
HAWLEY, STEVE DAINES, and SHELDON 
WHITEHOUSE—are all cosponsors of this 
bill. There are many, many other Sen-
ators who are going to support it as 
well. 
It is why, as the chair of the Sub-
committee 
on 
Competition 
Policy, 
Antitrust, and Consumer Rights, I have 
held a series of hearings with Senator 
LEE about online markets and abuses 
of power by the largest digital plat-
form. Senator LEE and I have a number 
of other bills together on this subject. 
We have heard about how the small 
number of extraordinarily large digital 
platforms—based on the 18 months of 
House hearings—18 months of House 
hearings—still, we have passed nothing 
in this Congress, not one bill since the 
dawn of the internet involving internet 
competition and competition policy. 
What we have learned is they act as 
gatekeepers that control how smaller 
companies reach their customers. As a 
result, online marketplaces lack the 
hallmarks of robust competition, fierce 
price competition, game-changing new 
products, 
and 
customers 
switching 
back and forth among products. 
Instead, we have what started as ex-
citing when everyone started accessing 
Amazon, Google; but the market is be-
coming 
increasingly 
calcified, 
one 
where the biggest gatekeepers have lit-
tle or even no fear of competitive 
threats, one where they feel no pres-
sure, where they can put themselves at 
the top of the search results regardless 
of quality or price. That is what we 
have right now—no rules in place. 
So when you look at Amazon, you see 
all these Amazon products at the top. 
You look at Google when this all start-
ed out, they didn’t have their own 
products. Well, now they do—Google 
products at the top. Apple products at 
the top. 
They can extract monopoly profits 
from consumers, and the small busi-
nesses rely on them because there is 
really no other way to access their own 
market. 
If we don’t act now, we will entrench 
those companies further, making it 
even more difficult for innovators to 
bring new products to market and for

small 
and 
medium-size 
companies 
across America to grow online. 
Let me be clear. We have monopoly 
problems that go far beyond digital gi-
ants like Facebook and Google, and 
there is more that we need to do to re-
store competition to markets through-
out the economy. We have a big task in 
front of us to rein in unchecked power 
and bring the benefits of consumer 
competition to all. 
Last Tuesday, I talked about the cost 
of inaction, how other countries are at-
tacking this problem way before us, 
how the European Parliament has just 
passed a major bill that is much more 
aggressive than anything that we are 
looking at here. 
Great Britain, what they are doing. 
Australia, what they just did. There 
are many examples throughout his-
tory, of course, where Congress stepped 
in and didn’t bow to the bloated mo-
nopolies but actually did something to 
further competition and rejuvenate the 
competitive market. 
When I talk about the dominant dig-
ital platforms, I am talking about 
some of the most powerful companies 
in the world, with armies of lobbyists 
and lawyers, with thousands of lawyers 
and lobbyists. They are everywhere—in 
every corner of this town, at every 
cocktail party, and all over this build-
ing. I tell my colleagues that they 
don’t even know, sometimes, when 
someone is trying to influence them 
because they think they are just talk-
ing to a friend because they have hired 
everyone they can see. 
But once they start talking about 
antitrust and Big Tech, I tell them 
they should at least ask the person if 
they are being paid by the tech com-
pany or if they are on one of the boards 
of one of the groups that supports the 
tech companies because, time and time 
again, they have been surprised to find 
the answer is yes. 
The tech companies aren’t just lob-
bying my colleagues; they are also lob-
bying 
the 
American 
people 
with 
‘‘astroturf’’ campaigning and dishonest 
PR tactics. At the same time that I 
have been working with my colleagues 
in good faith on commonsense solu-
tions to our online competition prob-
lems, these companies have been tell-
ing anyone who will listen that acting 
to protect competition in our digital 
markets will somehow cede our na-
tional security or outlaw Amazon 
Prime—something for which Senator 
GRASSLEY and I came to the floor of 
the Senate because it was such a lie. 
Together, we noted that their own lob-
byists had said that it wasn’t true. 
Their own lobbyists for Google had 
said, Yes, the bill wouldn’t really get 
rid of Amazon Prime. But that is what 
they are running ads for. 
Then, of course, is the money. I think 
this is actually the best evidence of 
just how big and dominant and bul-
lying these companies are, running ads 
in the States where people are in tough 
races. That is what they are doing. 
How obvious can it be? Message re-
ceived: We are out here. We can hurt 
you. We may not be putting your name 
in these ads right now, but we can do 
it. We have got the money to do it be-
cause we are the dominant monopolies. 
By the way, they wouldn’t be spend-
ing millions and millions and millions 
of dollars to stop us if we didn’t have 
some momentum. Let me give you 
some numbers. 
In 2021, Big Tech companies spent 
more than $70 million combined lob-
bying Congress. 
In the first quarter of this year, 
Facebook—now known as Meta—Ama-
zon, Alphabet—which is Google—and 
Apple spent more than $16 million lob-
bying Congress. 
In just 1 recent week in May—1 
week—one industry group, the Com-
puter and Communications Industry 
Association, spent $22 million in 1 week 
on TV ads against this bill. That is $22 
million against one bill in 1 week, and 
the numbers keep getting worse. 
Since I last took to the floor to dis-
cuss this issue, it was reported that 
Amazon reached an alltime high in lob-
bying spending in the last quarter, and 
that is only what the company spent 
directly. It doesn’t include what Big 
Tech directed others to spend, using 
contributions to spread misinformation 
about the bill. 
So that is what we are up against. 
And there is me, and there is this post-
er. There is our lawyer—one lawyer, 
Keagan. 
We 
have 
another 
lawyer, 
Avery. We have a third person. That is 
it. That is our team. Of course, Senator 
GRASSLEY and the other Senators in-
volved in this have great attorneys. We 
have the endorsement of the Justice 
Department. That is a whole lot of law-
yers. We have support from Secretary 
Raimondo over in Commerce and their 
team in doing this bill because they get 
that this is about competition moving 
forward. 
I would like to share two examples of 
the misinformation campaign against 
this bill. 
Just a few months ago, you may have 
read a letter from people outside of the 
Senate who were criticizing the bipar-
tisan bill that Senator GRASSLEY and I 
had worked on. It was signed on by a 
little-known group—actually, it was 
not that little-known if you watch TV 
because it is in the disclaimers on the 
ads—called American Edge. Here is 
what the Washington Post wrote about 
American Edge: 
Backed by millions from Facebook-parent 
company Meta, American Edge has launched 
a full-throated campaign to combat anti-
trust legislation in Washington, placing op- 
eds in regional papers throughout the coun-
try, commissioning studies, and collabo-
rating with a surprising array of partners, 
including minority business associations, 
conservative think tanks, and former na-
tional security officials. 
This is The Washington Post talking. 
It’s a political playbook more common to 
other industries, including pharmaceuticals 
[and] tobacco. . . . 
This is the playbook we have seen 
time and time again: Distort the truth, 
and distract people from the key issues 
by raising sideline potential concerns 
that aren’t even in the bill’s scope. 
Look over here, not at the real prob-
lems we face with real solutions to ad-
dress them. 
Amazon tried something similar, but 
they didn’t get away with it because 
small business owners are too savvy to 
fall for silly tricks. As CNBC wrote in 
an article last month, Amazon is so 
worried that Congress will finally do 
something, not to get rid of Amazon 
and not to stop Amazon Prime, but to 
simply say, when you do your searches 
on Amazon, at least you should have a 
fair shake at getting whatever are the 
most affordable or best products in 
what you are looking for at the top and 
not just what Amazon wants you to see 
because that is what they own. 
They placed a senior executive in 
charge, we now know, to recruit third- 
party sellers to oppose the bill, the 
small businesses. The Amazon execu-
tive posted to a forum used by sellers 
and directed them to a website that in-
cluded a form to contact their Senators 
with a prewritten email opposing the 
legislation. But get this: They weren’t 
fooled. These sellers knew the power 
that Amazon had to affect their busi-
nesses. They are monopolies, right? Ac-
cording to the CNBC report, hundreds 
of sellers replied to the post and actu-
ally expressed their support for the leg-
islation. 
I am not sure this would have hap-
pened 10 years ago, honestly, but now 
they have realized what the game is, 
what the rig is, what is really hap-
pening. Here are some examples of 
what the small businesses posted. This 
is after the request from the Amazon 
executive to write letters to people 
like me and the Presiding Officer op-
posing the bill. 
Here is what someone wrote: 
Any informed seller is going to support 
massive action taken against Amazon in the 
antitrust arena. I am personally sick of the 
condescending posts by Amazon management 
directed at us. We are not morons and know 
how to read and think for ourselves. 
That one got more than 100 likes in 
the forum. 
Here is another one: 
Yes, I’m going to oppose that Amazon will 
be prohibited from undercutting, manipu-
lating the Buy Box, and instituting restric-
tions on certain listings that unfairly bar me 
from selling an item. Yup, writing to my 
senator right now. 
We will call that a sarcastic post. 
Others got straight to the point: 
Thanks for the reminder! 
One seller wrote: 
I’ve asked my senators to support the bill. 
Another wrote: 
If Amazon is against the Bill, it must be 
good! 
And my favorite: 
I’m highly allergic to corporate propa-
ganda and fear mongering. Therefore, for the 
sake of my health, I will be encouraging my 
senators to fully support this legislation. 
I think these are pretty good exam-
ples of how resilient and clever our

American small businesses actually 
are. 
Since I am a Senator and not a tech- 
based industry group, I don’t get to 
spread my message with a multi-
million-dollar ad campaign, but Big 
Tech lobbyists can’t stop me from 
standing here right now on the Senate 
floor and telling you the truth—the 
people who are watching at home— 
since there are actually no other Sen-
ators out here right now except the 
Presiding Officer. 
We cannot let these companies use 
their monopoly profits to scare the 
Congress from doing its job. Some have 
said that this is the biggest political 
fight that Big Tech has ever fought. 
The truth is that they are not fighting 
on terms that anyone would think are 
fair. They are not fighting with truth-
ful 
representations 
or 
factually 
grounded arguments. They are spend-
ing millions and millions of dollars on 
ads that distort the truth because they 
are scared. They are scared about what 
is going to happen if we have honest, 
robust, American style competition. 
‘‘It’s better to buy than compete.’’ 
‘‘It’s better to buy than compete.’’ Do 
you know who said those words? That 
is 
what 
Facebook’s 
CEO 
Mark 
Zuckerberg wrote in a 2008 email 
around the time of the Instagram and 
WhatsApp acquisitions. Facing com-
petition from new upstarts, Facebook 
decided to take them out—to stop 
them from innovating in ways that 
might win over users from Facebook. It 
makes sense, right? Who knows what 
Instagram would have developed for 
their bells and whistles in terms of pri-
vacy and other things if they had been 
able to fairly compete? 
When the FTC sued Facebook, it 
wrote on—by the way, that was under 
the Trump administration and now 
continues on through the Biden admin-
istration. It wrote on page one of its 
antitrust complaint: 
Facebook has maintained its monopoly po-
sition by buying up companies that present 
competitive threats and by imposing restric-
tive policies that unjustifiably hinder actual 
or potential rivals that Facebook does not or 
cannot acquire. 
As 
another 
Facebook 
employee 
wrote, quoted in the FTC’s complaint: 
We’re scared that we can’t compete on our 
own merits. 
As of last week, we have new evi-
dence showing the same from other 
companies from documents that were 
obtained by Chairman DAVID CICILLINE 
and Ranking Member KEN BUCK, over 
in the House, during their bipartisan 
investigation into Big Tech. 
One of the documents quotes an 
Amazon executive discussing the po-
tential threat from Ring, a video door-
bell company it later bought for $1 bil-
lion. 
The executive said: 
I’m supportive of Ring. I don’t know how 
we can get big fast without acquiring some-
one. 
In the same email chain from an-
other Amazon executive: 
There’s a lot of overlap with what we want 
to do . . . and very little that we don’t want 
to do. 
There it is in black and white. They 
wanted to enter the market, but they 
couldn’t innovate fast enough, so they 
just bought up the competition. That is 
what they have been doing. The domi-
nant platforms will stop at nothing to 
protect their profits, even if it means 
stifling the innovation and ingenuity 
that has made our Nation’s economy 
second to none. We see the campaign to 
try to torpedo this bill for what it is: 
an obvious effort to protect their mar-
ket power and monopoly profits. 
Adam Smith—the godfather of cap-
italism, the guy who talked about the 
invisible hand—loved capitalism, but 
he always said this: 
Always watch out for the standing army of 
monopolies. 
And that is why, over time, we have 
developed law that allows us to ensure 
that the big guys don’t always control 
the marketplace—so that you can have 
new forms of competition developed. 
I want to be clear on this point. 
These are highly successful companies 
that have given us incredible innova-
tions. I don’t want these companies or 
their innovations or their beneficial 
products or services they offer to go 
away, and they won’t go away with 
this bill. What we will do is make sure 
that they are creating the conditions 
on their dominant platforms—because 
that is what we are dealing with, four 
different ones—for the next new thing 
to be developed and to thrive. That is 
why we have antitrust laws. 
As Senator Sherman—a Republican 
from Ohio and for whom our central 
antitrust law, the Sherman Act, was 
named—famously said: 
If we will not endure a king as a political 
power, we should not endure a king over pro-
duction, transportation, and sale of any of 
the necessaries of life. 
Let me speak specifically about anti-
trust and innovation. There is a per-
sistent myth out there that antitrust 
law is about prices and nothing else. 
That is not true. Although prices are, 
of course, an extraordinarily important 
component of competition policy and 
analysis—and by the way, you are see-
ing more and more small businesses so 
concerned about what is going on—and 
big businesses because these platforms 
are charging them more and more and 
more just for the pleasure of being on 
the platform or for getting their names 
up at the top or for using their serv-
ices, but it isn’t all about pricing; it is 
also about innovation. 
Through competition and innovation, 
there are new products, services, apps, 
and ideas that are hard for us to even 
fathom that will be developed by clever 
engineers, smart business people, and 
thoughtful marketers. Innovation is 
part of the American spirit. Innovation 
generates new opportunities and new 
hopes for businesses. Breakthroughs in 
science and technology have given us 
the 
vaccines 
that 
are 
getting 
us 
through this pandemic and driving the 
development of clean energy solutions. 
Emerging technologies like artificial 
intelligence 
are 
driving 
innovation 
across our country. 
I think the Presiding Officer from the 
great State of Michigan knows a little 
bit about innovation there with what 
we have seen as its emergent. When ev-
eryone was writing off the American 
car companies, they innovated and 
moved ahead. 
Of course, some of our economy’s 
largest companies began as startups 
with new innovation, and some of these 
companies—now small and large—are 
starting to say: Wait a minute. These 
four Big Tech companies can buy any-
thing they want. There are no rules of 
the road. They can put their stuff at 
the top. Yet this is where customers go 
and buy things. We just need an even 
playing field in the marketplace. 
Innovation that is vital to our Amer-
ican economy cannot thrive without 
open, competitive markets. It is com-
petition that pressures manufacturers 
to invest in research and development 
and to constantly innovate to improve 
their products and introduce new prod-
ucts. It is competition that provides 
opportunities for entrepreneurs to de-
velop new ideas and to start new busi-
nesses. 
This topic is so important that I held 
a hearing with Senator LEE last De-
cember on innovation. In his opening 
remarks, 
Senator 
LEE
shared 
his 
thoughts about this important topic, 
noting that when competition suffers, 
so does innovation. One might say that 
competition is itself the mother of in-
novation. 
Competition 
really 
can’t 
occur without a lot of innovation. 
As one of our witnesses at the hear-
ing, Dr. Diana Moss, president of the 
American Antitrust Institute, testi-
fied, dominant firms face fewer eco-
nomic incentives to innovate. It is one 
thing to create new products that can 
win over customers from a rival. It is 
another to create new products that 
might undermine your existing busi-
ness. 
When you have got all of the cus-
tomers, let’s say, in the App Store—all 
Apple phones have one kind of app, and 
all other phones have another kind of 
app, Google—they are a duopoly. There 
you go. So they can do what they want. 
That is why they are charging 30 per-
cent to Spotify—just for the pleasure 
of competing against Apple Music. 
That is what is happening. 
The path to future innovations is 
through the crucible of competition. 
What makes companies innovate is not 
just a desire to please their customers 
but also the healthy fear that others 
might please them instead and win cus-
tomers in the competitive landscape. 
If the largest digital gatekeepers do 
not face any meaningful competition, 
they will continue to extract monopoly 
profits from customers and the small 
businesses that depend on them to 
reach their customers. If the largest 
digital gatekeepers have the power to 
avoid competition, we should expect

that they will not innovate at the same 
pace as when they face stiff competi-
tion. 
So to my colleagues I say, as I did 
last week: Yes, you can love the prod-
ucts. You can love the CEOs, if you 
want. You can love the companies. But 
you also have to love competition and 
understand the unique place of the U.S. 
Senate to take on what has happened 
time and time again in history: the 
bloated monopolies that sometimes 
come up. You don’t get rid of steel or 
copper. Of course, we didn’t. We cre-
ated a more competitive marketplace. 
That former chairman of AT&T said 
himself, after the breakup of AT&T, 
when we saw long distance rates go 
down through Democratic and Repub-
lican leadership, when we saw the cell 
phone industry, which had been noth-
ing, when cell phones were the weight 
of bricks and this big in your brief-
case—we saw all that changed, and he 
actually said we are a stronger com-
pany because of what happened. 
Here are the facts today. Here are 
our new bloated situations: Google— 
pretend that is now Google—has a 90- 
percent market share in search en-
gines. In Australia, when the Aus-
tralian Government was taking them 
on and said you have got to charge a 
fair rate for media links, Google—and 
Facebook, by the way—literally said: 
OK, we are going to leave your coun-
try. We are going to leave an industri-
alized nation. 
Then, there was so much pressure on 
the world that they backed down and 
negotiated rates. 
A 90-percent market share—that is 
what you get to do. Great product, OK. 
If we are going to tolerate that, I guess 
the Justice Department will look at it. 
That is not what our bill does. It 
doesn’t break them up. It doesn’t do 
anything. It is just that when we have 
a 90-percent gatekeeper, at least we 
have some rules of the road for what 
they put on there. 
Apple controls 100 percent of app dis-
tribution for iPhones. Together, Apple 
and Google, as I noted, have a duopoly 
on app distribution on all smartphones. 
Three out of every four social media 
users—there are 4 billion of them—are 
active Facebook users. Amazon is ex-
pected to seize half of the entire e-com-
merce retail market this year. 
What do they do with that power? As 
the New York Times reported a few 
years ago, back in 2018, if you opened 
up the App Store on an iPhone in May 
of 2018 and typed the word ‘‘podcast’’ in 
the search box, the first result, after an 
ad, would have been an app made by 
Apple: Apple Podcasts. The next result 
would have been Apple’s Compass app, 
then Apple’s Find My Friends app. 
Amazon does the same thing. 
ProPublica reported: 
We looked at 250 frequently purchased 
products over several weeks to see which 
ones were selected for the most prominent 
placement on Amazon’s virtual shelves—the 
so-called ‘‘buy box’’ that pops up first. . . . 
And so many of us have had that ex-
perience, right? You are in a hurry. 
You want to buy something. What pops 
up first? 
About three-quarters of the time, Amazon 
placed its own products and those of compa-
nies that pay for its services in that posi-
tion, even when there were substantially 
cheaper offers available from others. 
This obviously puts small businesses 
in a bind. The need for action is clear. 
All they have to do is treat people fair-
ly, have a reason to put people up first, 
and treat the people who are adver-
tising on their sites fairly. 
The way our bill works, if they do 
that, they stay out of trouble. If they 
don’t do it, the Justice Department, 
the FTC, and the State AG can look 
into doing something about it. They 
are, obviously, not going to bring some 
big case over one mistake. We are talk-
ing about a consistent effort here, 
which is exactly what they have been 
doing to make more money by putting 
their stuff at the top. 
Since the founding of this country, 
people across the country and across 
the political spectrum have recognized 
and taken on the issue of monopoly 
power. That is why we have worked 
across the aisle—Senator GRASSLEY 
and myself—to build bipartisan support 
for this bill, the bipartisan solution to 
the problem of anti-competitive self- 
preferencing by dominant digital gate-
keepers. That is how we found our com-
mon ground. That is how KEN BUCK, a 
conservative Republican out of Colo-
rado, found common ground with Rep-
resentative CICILLINE, a liberal progres-
sive Congressman from Rhode Island. 
Our bill creates the rules of the road 
for these platforms so they can’t abuse 
their gatekeeper power by favoring 
their own products or services and 
disadvantaging rivals in ways that 
harm competition. 
In other words, examples are that 
Amazon won’t be able to misuse small 
business data in order to copy their 
products. The best example of that is 
the Wall Street Journal reporting 
about a four-person luggage company 
out of Brooklyn, NY, advertising inno-
cently, giving them the data they need 
to advertise, and, bam, a few months 
later, Amazon has the identical prod-
uct in Amazon Basics. 
Apple won’t be able to stifle competi-
tion by blocking other companies’ serv-
ices from interoperating with their 
platforms, and Google won’t be able to 
bias their platform search results in 
favor of their own products and serv-
ices without merit. These platforms 
will no longer be able to put their own 
products and services automatically 
first. That is what we are talking 
about. Amazon should rank products 
based on price and quality, not based 
on their own profit margins. 
In those new House Judiciary docu-
ments that I mentioned earlier, there 
is one from a Google executive that il-
lustrates this point as well. It is an 
email about Amazon saying: 
Amazon has a built-in incentive to partner 
with Alexa, since they will pull you from 
their store if you don’t support it. 
Again, that is an amazingly honest 
statement of the situation where ramp-
ant self-preferencing is allowed: A 
product might be great for consumers, 
but if it doesn’t ‘‘partner with Alexa’’— 
forget it. They will pull it from the 
store to solidify their emerging power 
in voice assistants. 
Second, the world’s largest and most 
powerful platform shouldn’t be allowed 
to copy small businesses’ private data 
that they get from their sellers, as I 
just mentioned, to create knock-off 
products. 
Third, in the bill, platforms shouldn’t 
require companies, especially small 
companies, to buy a bunch of stuff 
from the monopolies, like ads or dis-
tribution services, in order to be listed 
at the top. They can offer those serv-
ices. They can sell those services. But 
the only way you get to the top, so 
that when our pages here, sitting in the 
Chamber, are trying to look at the best 
deal for a fan, if they don’t have air 
conditioning in their room—it was 
really hot in Washington, DC. Well, the 
best product should come up or the 
least expensive product. That is what 
should come up, not just something 
that Amazon Basics can make money 
off of. That is what the bill does. 
It is not a breakup bill. It is not a 
ban on mergers, but it would put some 
commonsense rules of the road in 
place. If we can get these reforms in 
place, we will ensure a fairer, more 
competitive marketplace for small and 
medium businesses. This bill gives 
them more options, more flexibility, 
and more access to the markets. 
Just today, the National Federation 
of Independence Businesses wrote to 
Senator GRASSLEY and me to say that 
84 percent of their members support 
Congress taking action—that is about 
the kind of numbers I would like to see 
around here, 84 percent—‘‘to control 
unfair and anticompetitive practices of 
large tech companies.’’ That is why 
they are formally endorsing the bill, 
writing: 
Most small businesses have no choice but 
to rely in some capacity on these large tech-
nology companies for a variety of business 
needs, ranging from driving business traffic 
through search to online advertising to ac-
cessing key digital marketplaces. 
For small business sellers using market-
place platforms, competition between the op-
erator’s own products and third-party sellers 
creates conflicts of interest and has been 
shown to lead to unfair business practices. 
By the way, it is not just small busi-
ness. There are a whole bunch of big 
businesses supporting it, too, only be-
cause they are not going to compete 
against the big titans. A lot of them 
don’t want to say it out loud because 
they don’t want to be punished. They 
just call us and tell us. That is what 
you deal with when you deal with mo-
nopolies. You are not going to out peo-
ple who don’t want it out there. But 
the truth is, there are a whole bunch of 
businesses that support this bill, in ad-
dition to a whole bunch of working 
people, in addition to my colleagues 
from all sides of the political spectrum.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3684 
July 26, 2022 
What did the Justice Department 
say? They said: 
Vesting the power to pick winners and los-
ers across markets in a small number of cor-
porations contravenes the foundations of our 
capitalist system, and given the increasing 
importance of these markets— 
And that is very key here— 
the power of such platforms is likely to con-
tinue to grow. . . . 
That is what we are seeing right now 
with the small business rebellion. 
This puts at risk the nation’s economic 
progress and prosperity, ultimately threat-
ening the economic liberty that undergirds 
our democracy. 
That is the business group. Now, I 
will go to the consumer group. The 
Justice Department you just heard. 
The Consumer Federation of America 
wrote: 
We need to incentivize more competition 
and more innovation. 
A group of legal scholars said: 
It is an appropriate expression of democ-
racy for Congress to enact pro-competitive 
statutes to maintain the vibrancy of the on-
line economy. 
Monopoly power, consumer choice, 
reduced innovation—these aren’t topics 
that came up for the first time when 
we marked up and passed the bill. In 
fact, we got it out of committee 16 to 
6, the first time since the advent of the 
internet, in a highly polarized, at 
times, Senate Judiciary Committee, 
for anyone who watched the Supreme 
Court hearings. We got that bill out 16 
to 6, the first bill to advance to the 
Senate floor—the competition bill— 
since the advent of the internet. 
We cannot stand by and do nothing 
while digital giants entrench their 
power to gobble up more businesses, 
gobble up bigger and bigger slices of 
the economy. I guess we can. I guess we 
can turn into this situation. But even 
these Senators, way back—they were 
all in here, unlike what I see right now. 
But they were all here, and they actu-
ally got something done. And this is 
our moment right now. 
I urge my colleagues to bring this 
bill to the floor. I have gotten the com-
mitment to get a vote on this bill. We 
have got to get this bill on a vote. 
I appreciate Senator GRASSLEY’s pa-
tience and bipartisan support, but we 
know that we are up against a lot. But 
if they think that I am going to get 
scared by that, think again. I am ready 
to roll. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
PETERS). The Senator from Pennsyl-
vania. 
PACT ACT OF 2022 
Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I rise 
because I want to express concerns 
that I have about a particular provi-
sion in the PACT Act. It is my under-
standing that the Senate is considering 
this later this week. We could be vot-
ing on cloture as early as tomorrow 
afternoon. 
My concerns with the provision of 
the bill as drafted are—well, I and 
many of my colleagues share this con-
cern. What we want to do is ensure 
that the PACT Act is not used as a ve-
hicle to dramatically increase spending 
outside of the objective of the bill, 
which is to cover specific healthcare 
and benefits for veterans. 
As it is written, as we are currently 
considering it, the PACT Act includes 
a budget gimmick that is designed to 
do exactly that. This gimmick was not 
in the House bill, but some Senators 
found it necessary to add this. This 
gimmick is not necessary to achieve 
the underlying purpose of the legisla-
tion. The purpose of the legislation is 
to expand VA healthcare benefits and 
certain other benefits for veterans. 
I have a very simple proposed fix for 
this problem that will not reduce vet-
eran benefits by a single dollar. It 
would allow the bill to fully achieve its 
original intent. 
To explain this a little bit, I have to 
explain a little bit about how the Fed-
eral Government spends money around 
here. 
As you know, Mr. President, we have 
two big categories of Federal spending. 
We have what we call discretionary 
spending, and that is the spending that 
is appropriated annually by Congress. 
That spending is limited every year. 
There is a cap on how much can be 
spent in that category. That is the first 
category. 
The 
second 
category 
of 
Federal 
spending, we call mandatory spending. 
This is different from discretionary 
spending in the sense that it is kind of 
automatic spending. It occurs not by 
appropriation; it is driven by eligi-
bility for various programs. People are 
eligible; so they get the payment. And 
it does not depend on a congressional 
appropriation. Those are the two big 
categories of spending. 
Now, the PACT Act, as I said, ad-
dresses veterans’ healthcare. Now, of 
course, as we all know, current law al-
ready obligates the VA to spend a great 
deal of money on veterans’ healthcare 
and benefits, as it should. In par-
ticular, there is about $400 billion over 
the next 10 years that the VA will 
spend on veterans’ toxic exposure care 
and benefits—about $400 billion. That 
is existing law. That is going to happen 
no matter what we do with this bill. 
That $400 billion has always been cat-
egorized in the discretionary spending 
category of Federal spending, and, 
therefore, it is subject to caps, limits. 
Now, what the PACT Act does is it 
expands this obligation on the part of 
the VA. And it expands it a lot, by 
about $280 billion over the next 10 
years. And it takes all of that new 
spending, the $280 billion of new spend-
ing that the VA will spend under the 
PACT Act, and it puts it in the manda-
tory spending category—not the discre-
tionary but the mandatory spending 
category. 
Now, we can argue about whether or 
not that was a good idea, but that is 
not my issue on the floor this evening. 
I have no quarrels with the $280 billion 
being in the mandatory category. That 
is not the issue at hand. 
Here is the problem with this bill. 
Here is the budgetary gimmick. This is 
what is outrageous. The bill takes the 
$400 billion that I mentioned earlier, 
the $400 billion that is obligated to be 
spent by the Veterans’ Administration, 
by legislation passed many years ago, 
money that is going to be spent; it en-
ables that spending to be shifted from 
the discretionary category to the man-
datory category of spending. 
You could say: Well, so what; the 
government is still going to spend the 
money either way. That is true. It is 
going to go for the same purpose, to 
the same people who need it. That is 
all true. 
So why does it matter? Why did the 
Senate authors of this bill, unlike the 
House, decide it is necessary to take 
this big category of spending that is al-
ready in existing law and move it from 
the discretionary spending category to 
the mandatory category? 
Well, here is the reason. As I said 
earlier, there are caps on how much 
discretionary spending can occur in 
any given year. By moving this big cat-
egory of spending, this $400 billion, out 
of the discretionary category and put-
ting it into mandatory, you create this 
big hole under the cap. That is what is 
going on here. Now, when you create 
that big hole, guess what happens with 
that big hole? It gets filled with spend-
ing on who knows what. That is what is 
going on here. This is unbelievable. 
Now, again, I want to stress that my 
quarrel here is not with the underlying 
purpose of the bill or the substance. 
And, sure, we could talk about ways it 
could be improved, but that is not what 
this is about. It is about a budget gim-
mick that is designed to allow hun-
dreds of billions of dollars in addi-
tional, unrelated spending having noth-
ing to do with veterans. It could be 
anything. It is this big, gaping hole 
that some folks around here created by 
design in our discretionary spending 
category. 
You know what it really comes down 
to. It is about Congress hiding behind 
an important veterans’ care bill a mas-
sive, unrelated spending binge. That is 
what this amounts to. Now, that would 
be objectionable at any time, under 
any circumstances, as far as I am con-
cerned, but it is unbelievable that this 
provision is snuck into this bill at a 
time like this. 
What I am referring to is the obvious 
fact that our entire economy—Amer-
ican families, virtually all of them, are 
being racked by out-of-control infla-
tion. Inflation is at a 40-year high—40 
years. I mean, roughly half of all 
Americans have never been alive with 
inflation this high. And there is no 
avoiding it. It is at the gas pump. It is 
at the grocery store. It is at the rent. 
It is everywhere. 
Well, how does inflation come about? 
Well, a big part of it came from too 
much government spending and lax, 
easy-money monetary policy. That is

always a very dangerous combination. 
And sure enough, it gave us this out-of- 
control inflation. Well, this gimmick is 
going to make it worse. It is going to 
add $400 billion over 10 years in totally 
unrelated, unnecessary spending. 
Again, we are not talking about vet-
erans’ healthcare. That is not what I 
am here to talk about. We are talking 
about the other $400 billion that we 
haven’t seen exactly what that is going 
to consist of. Who knows. But you can 
be sure that a big hole under the spend-
ing caps is not going to left as a big 
hole. 
So this is terrible policy. So, here, I 
have got a simple suggestion. Here is 
all we need to do. We leave the $280 bil-
lion, the new spending for veterans’ 
healthcare that the bill contemplates— 
leave that in mandatory spending. 
That is fine. But we simply would mod-
ify the bill to keep the $400 billion that 
we are going to spend anyway in the 
category where it has always been, the 
discretionary spending category. This 
doesn’t cut a dime in veterans’ spend-
ing, but it would avoid creating this 
huge hole for all kinds of new and unre-
lated spending. 
So, again, I will stress one more time 
for the people who might choose to lis-
ten, this doesn’t reduce spending on 
veterans’ healthcare or benefits of any 
kind by a single penny. And the change 
that I am looking for would not in any 
way impede the ability of veterans to 
get the healthcare that they are going 
to get under this bill as a result of 
toxic exposure. It is not about any of 
that. It is only about preventing this 
excessive, unrelated spending in we 
don’t even know yet what categories, 
which was inserted in this bill. 
So I think this is a simple fix. Unfor-
tunately, it appears we are still not in 
the business of contemplating amend-
ments in this Chamber. We were prom-
ised there would be amendments at the 
beginning of this process. Amendments 
have always historically been a funda-
mental way that we litigate our dif-
ferences and iterate our way to solu-
tions, but we are not allowed to do 
this. I have not been allowed to offer 
an amendment. Nobody has. 
So I intend to vote against cloture, 
which, as you know, Mr. President, is 
the procedural vote that ends debate 
and ends the amendments and allows 
the body to get on to final passage. I 
am not going to vote for cloture be-
cause we haven’t had this debate yet. 
We haven’t had this vote on this out-
rageous budget gimmick that has noth-
ing to do with the underlying purpose 
of the bill. 
So I am going to urge my colleagues 
to join me in voting against cloture. 
And what will happen if we deny clo-
ture? What if we succeed, and the 
Chamber, 
the 
body, 
is 
unable 
to 
achieve cloture? Well, then I think I 
know what happens. Our Democratic 
colleagues would work with us to fix 
the gimmick. That is what would hap-
pen. Then the bill would move forward 
with all the same benefits for veterans 
that it has and that it has always had 
as a bill, and we would do this without 
introducing this massive, unrelated 
spending. 
Now, why am I confident that that is 
what the outcome would be? Because I 
think our Democratic colleagues are 
very unlikely to forgo passing a really 
important veterans health bill for the 
sake of their unrelated spending blitz. I 
think, as much as they want to go on 
that spending binge, they would take a 
pass on that if that is what they have 
to do to get this veterans bill done. So 
that is how this would end. 
That is why, Mr. President, once 
again, I urge my colleagues, join me in 
a simple fix for a terrible budget gim-
mick, and let’s do this quickly. And if 
we are not allowed to do this any other 
way, then let’s deny cloture tomorrow 
on the cloture vote, and then we will be 
able to fix it promptly thereafter. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
H.R. 4346 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, as 
the Presiding Officer knows, the United 
States of America has long been at the 
vanguard of global scientific and tech-
nological innovation, and that leader-
ship has helped power our economy and 
strengthen our leadership position in 
the world. 
That competitive edge is now at risk. 
It is at risk because we have failed to 
renew our national commitment to one 
of the key tools that has brought us 
that success in the past: making robust 
Federal investments in scientific re-
search and development. 
The bill before the Senate, called the 
CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, aims to 
stop this downward drift and propel us 
forward again in the area of discovery, 
in areas of innovation and manufac-
turing. It honors a long, long tradition 
of American excellence in research and 
invention. 
If you look back over our history, 
America has always been on the lead-
ing edge of science, of technology, of 
engineering, and mathematics. That 
spirit has been with us since our found-
ing, but it truly flourished in the dec-
ades following the Second World War, 
with new inventions springing from 
American minds every year and mov-
ing us forward at an accelerated pace. 
American astronauts took humanity 
to the Moon for the first time. Amer-
ican computer scientists invented the 
internet and changed the world. In 
fact, it was during this explosion of dis-
covery that an American engineer cre-
ated the first integrated circuit in 1958, 
and that invention would pave the way 
for the microchips we use today and 
which are a big part of the legislation 
before us. 
In the 20th century, the United 
States was the innovation capital of 
the world. In 1960, America generated 
69 percent of all research and develop-
ment on the entire planet. This golden 
age flowed from the ingenuity of Amer-
ican visionaries, and it was fueled by 
our system of free enterprise and pri-
vate investment. 
But we cannot ignore another key in-
gredient in the success of that period, 
and that is the very large investment 
in cutting-edge research and develop-
ment made by the Federal Government 
on behalf of the American people. Fed-
eral funds accounted for two-thirds of 
all American research and development 
investment in 1968—two-thirds from 
the Federal Government. In fact, all 
three of the American-made inventions 
and innovations I just mentioned— 
from building the rocket and the sys-
tems to land a man on the Moon and 
return him safely to Earth to inventing 
the internet, to creating that first 
microchip—those were fueled, in large 
part, by Federal Government invest-
ment, 
taxpayer 
investment, 
to 
strengthen the entire country. 
For example, if you look at the his-
tory of the microchip, you will see that 
between 1987 and 1997—that decade— 
the R&D arm of the Department of De-
fense, what we call DARPA, disbursed 
around $870 million in Federal funding 
to 14 ship manufacturers across the 
country, which, in turn, made the 
American ship industry more competi-
tive than ever. 
That was then. Today, we see a 
changing story. We are still a leader in 
innovation, but we are at risk of falling 
behind and falling behind quickly. And, 
in doing so, we are ceding ground to 
our global competitors and adversaries. 
This is a time where standing still 
means going backward and going back-
ward fast. 
The U.S. share of global research and 
development has dropped by half, by a 
full 50 percent, in the last six decades, 
and the most recent figures available 
reveal that the Federal investment in 
R&D as a share of our gross domestic 
product has dropped by one-third over 
the last 40 years. 
While we have been slipping, other 
countries are dramatically boosting 
their investments in these critical 
areas, fueling huge resources toward 
innovation. China’s most recent 5-year 
plan calls for ramping up investments 
in research and development by more 
than 7 percent every year. China has 
made no secret of its desire to corner 
the market in AI, in quantum com-
puting, in clean energy tech, and much 
more. And the Chinese Communist 
Party is putting resources where their 
plan is, mobilizing the investments 
needed to try to achieve that goal. 
This is not only an issue of falling be-
hind in the areas of innovation and dis-
covery because, even if Americans are 
inventing new technologies, the benefit 
to the American worker of leading in 
the invention of new technologies is 
much diminished if the manufacturing 
of essential products that use those 
technologies simply goes offshore. 
We spend a lot of time inventing new 
technologies here, but over the last 
many 
decades 
we 
have 
seen 
the 
offshoring of those technologies and 
the manufacturing of products with

those technologies to other parts of the 
world, at the expense of the American 
worker. We have seen that dramatic 
offshoring of jobs for decades, includ-
ing in many areas that are critical to 
the success of our entire economy and 
to the needs of our national security. 
An American may have invented the 
microchip, but today we produce only 
12 percent of the world’s microchips. 
And that is at a time when these chips 
are absolutely essential to almost 
every aspect of modern life, from run-
ning our washing machines to powering 
our military. At the same time, com-
petitors like China are pairing their 
rising R&D investments with major 
funding for manufacturing, putting the 
money in for invention and putting the 
money in to make sure those inven-
tions stay and are manufactured in 
China. China has put $150 billion to-
ward manufacturing microchips over 
the last 8 years. And today, 19 of the 
world’s 20 fastest growing microchip 
firms are in China. 
So you can see how this creates an 
enormous challenge for America’s com-
petitiveness, 
for 
our 
economic 
strength, and for our national security. 
The technology we need today for our 
cars, our homes, our businesses, and 
our military is, in large part, produced 
overseas. 
We have already fallen way behind in 
the manufacturing of strategically im-
portant technologies, and now we are 
also at risk of losing our edge in devel-
oping the critical technologies of the 
future. 
This has got to change. In the face of 
these challenges, we have to ask our-
selves two fundamental questions: One, 
how can we ensure that we continue to 
invent the key technologies of the fu-
ture; and, second, how can we make 
and manufacture key products using 
those technologies right here in Amer-
ica? 
That is why it is time for us to take 
a page out of our own history and re-
ignite a golden age in American re-
search, development, and manufac-
turing through robust Federal invest-
ments. And the bill before the Senate 
begins to take us down that road. 
First and foremost, it includes $53 
billion to supercharge microchip manu-
facturing in America. That will bolster 
our economic security and our national 
security. 
For American families, more Amer-
ican-made microchips means we will be 
able to ease some of the strain on our 
supply chains that are leading to in-
creased wait times for everything from 
cars to smartphones, to dishwashers. 
And in the long term, boosting our do-
mestic production of chips will help 
spur homegrown manufacturing jobs 
and lower the prices of a wide range of 
goods and services. 
More 
American-made 
chips 
also 
means we will be less reliant on foreign 
manufacturers to meet our military 
needs. Today, 90 percent of the high- 
end microchips—the most sophisti-
cated microchips—are made in Taiwan. 
These are advanced chips on the mar-
ket that power everything from con-
sumer 
electronics 
to 
sophisticated 
military software and hardware. These 
microchips are in our jets. They are in 
our radar systems and much more. 
So with this additional funding, 
America will have increased capacity 
to produce these high-end microchips 
right here at home so we are not rely-
ing on foreign countries to power the 
things our communities and our coun-
try rely on every day. 
But while supporting the manufac-
turing of chips here at home is impor-
tant, it is not enough to keep us com-
petitive on other key fronts. As I said 
earlier, we need America to get back 
on the leading edge of research and de-
velopment in a whole range of areas on 
technology’s frontier. 
Now is the time for us to boost inno-
vation and to sharpen our edges across 
every technological front, from quan-
tum competing to artificial intel-
ligence, to so much more. And that is 
why this legislation calls for signifi-
cant new investments in major sci-
entific institutions. It would authorize 
an increase of $36 billion for the Na-
tional Science Foundation, an increase 
of $5 billion for the National Institute 
of Standards and Technology in my 
home State of Maryland, and an in-
crease of $12.9 billion for the Depart-
ment of Energy’s Office of Science. 
These increases represent roughly a 
doubling—a doubling—of the Federal 
resources dedicated to these important 
Agencies. It also includes an increase 
of $11 billion for the Department of 
Commerce over 5 years to develop re-
gional technology hubs around the 
country so that every part of the 
United States and communities in 
every corner of the country can benefit 
from these investments. 
These are major increases. These are 
authorized increases—these parts with 
respect to future technologies as op-
posed to the chips portion of the bill. 
So, No. 1, we need to make sure these 
funds are actually appropriated; and, 
second, we need to ensure that these 
funds are deployed in the most stra-
tegic and effective way. That is why 
our bill includes a bipartisan provision 
that I authored with Senator BLUNT of 
Missouri to ensure that the United 
States has the tools it needs to mon-
itor and address new frontiers in 
science, technology, engineering, and 
mathematics. 
This portion of the bill includes two 
elements: First, it directs the National 
Academy of Sciences to identify the 
critical emerging technologies before 
us; and, second, it directs the National 
Academies to assess how well the 
United States is meeting those science 
and technology challenges through our 
global leadership and through the in-
vestments we are making here at 
home. I think we all recognize that we 
can’t determine the path that we 
should chart as a country without get-
ting a good look at the terrain and the 
horizon and even try to peer over the 
horizon. And charting that course is 
only helpful if we monitor our progress 
along the way to see if we are meeting 
our goals. 
That is about developing a national 
early warning system for technologies 
in which our country’s best minds are 
focused on the technologies of the fu-
ture so that we don’t get caught flat- 
footed in the face of emerging opportu-
nities. 
We have seen in the case of 5G tech-
nology what can happen when we are 
not tracking the possibilities, and we 
get blindsided. The reality is China 
beat us in the transition from 4G to 5G 
networks, and it wasn’t because we 
lacked the talent or the skill or the re-
sources or the drive to win the 5G race. 
We failed to build a comprehensive sys-
tem for 5G deployment fast enough be-
cause we did not have a national strat-
egy. We had blind spots. The market 
didn’t fill them. It requires a national 
plan of action. That provision in the 
legislation will address that short-
coming. 
And as we revitalize innovation here 
at home, we have got to get all of our 
talent on the field. We need to deploy 
all of our brainpower in order to fuel 
this renaissance in American techno-
logical leadership. This bill will pro-
vide major investments in our 21st cen-
tury workforce to create jobs and in-
spire 
the 
next 
generation 
of 
our 
innovators. 
I am pleased that a bipartisan provi-
sion is included in here that was au-
thored 
by 
our 
colleague 
Senator 
WARNOCK, which will direct additional 
Federal funds toward emerging re-
search institutions of higher education, 
including 
our 
Nation’s 
historically 
Black colleges and universities and our 
minority-serving institutions. 
On top of that provision, I am pleased 
that this bill includes a bipartisan 
measure that I wrote with Senator 
TILLIS of North Carolina. Our provision 
would help advance the research classi-
fication of HBCUs around the country 
that already have strong research pro-
grams and make them competitive 
among the highest caliber of research 
universities for more Federal funding— 
to take them from R2s to R1s. This will 
open the doors of opportunity for more 
students, faculty, and staff across the 
country. In my State of Maryland, we 
have two HBCUs that would directly 
benefit from this provision: Morgan 
State University and the University of 
Maryland Eastern Shore. This is an in-
vestment in our future. 
These are just some of the elements 
in this bill that will help foster a sus-
tained American leadership in emerg-
ing technologies into the future. But 
even when this bill is passed—and I 
urge all my colleagues to vote for it— 
our work is not over. The Senate and 
the House have spent the last 2 years 
working on a package to sharpen 
America’s competitive edge on the 
world stage. The bill before us does not 
include many of the other important 
measures that also enjoy bipartisan

support and are still part of the con-
ference committee. So we need to get 
to the remainder of those provisions 
and get them over the finish line. 
For example, one of the pieces of that 
larger bill that is not included in the 
measure before us would help protect 
American intellectual property and 
protect our technology secrets against 
theft by foreign companies or other 
countries. We know that in today’s 
high-speed, fast-paced economy, where 
information zips around the world at 
the speed of light, it is easier than ever 
to steal someone else’s technology for 
your own purposes. At a summit in 
London earlier this month, FBI Direc-
tor Chris Wray warned companies from 
across Europe that Beijing is devel-
oping more advanced strategies to 
‘‘ransack’’ 
Western 
companies, 
pil-
laging intellectual property, and steal-
ing inventions from Americans and 
others around the world in the high- 
tech sector. We have to do everything 
we can to protect ourselves against 
that malign conduct. 
For example, if you are an American 
company and a foreign company in 
China steals your intellectual prop-
erty, the only recourse you currently 
have at your disposal is to file a law-
suit—file a lawsuit and go to court. It 
is like taking a peashooter to a knife 
fight, especially when you are dealing 
with a foreign government, like the 
Government of China. That is why I in-
troduced a bipartisan bill with Senator 
SASSE
to arm the U.S. Government 
with the authority to impose tough 
sanctions on companies that system-
atically plunder U.S. technology se-
crets and intellectual property. 
That measure, as I said, is part of a 
larger package, and we need to get that 
done by the end of the year. For now, 
I urge my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle to support the bill that is be-
fore us this week. It is a key step for-
ward to ensure that America remains 
the world’s leading developer of key 
technologies and will help bring that 
important high-tech microchip manu-
facturing back here to the United 
States. 
We have the brainpower. We have the 
institutions. We have a system that 
can fuel tech entrepreneurs. We need to 
match those very important assets 
with a willpower for national success 
and progress. 
History tells us that a key ingredient 
in America’s innovation success story 
has been Federal investment in R&D— 
much of the R&D that companies will 
not invest in because it is sometimes 
too risky. It is an investment that we 
make on behalf of the American people 
to ensure our national success and our 
global leadership. We are today wit-
nessing the efforts of our competitors 
and, in many cases, our adversaries to 
overtake us in these key areas. And we 
should not and we must not surrender 
our leadership in those places that 
shape our economy and shape our 
world. 
We must harness the full power of 
American innovation, as we have done 
in the past, to meet the challenges of 
our time. And this bill is an important 
part of that effort. And I urge my col-
leagues to support it.

RECOGNIZING THE 25TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF RADIO FREE ASIA AND 
ITS 
MISSION 
TO 
PROVIDE 
AN 
INDEPENDENT SOURCE OF NEWS 
TO CLOSED SOCIETIES IN ASIA 
Mr. PETERS. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the Sen-
ate proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of Calendar No. 418, S. Res. 394. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the resolution by 
title. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A resolution (S. Res. 394) recognizing the 
25th anniversary of Radio Free Asia and its 
mission to provide an independent source of 
news to closed societies in Asia. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the resolution, 
which had been reported from the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations, with an 
amendment to strike all after the re-
solving clause and insert in lieu thereof 
the following: 
Whereas, after the 1989 Tiananmen Square 
Massacre, a bipartisan group of Senators and 
Members of the House of Representatives, led by 
then-Senators Joseph R. Biden and Jesse Helms, 
came together and sponsored legislation to cre-
ate Radio Free Asia, a news outlet with a con-
gressionally mandated mission to provide unbi-
ased, independent, and domestic journalism for 
audiences in China, Burma, Cambodia, Laos, 
North Korea, Tibet, and Vietnam, whose people 
do not fully enjoy freedom of expression; 
Whereas Radio Free Asia— 
(1) was established by United States law as 
part of the United States International Broad-
casting Act of 1994 (22 U.S.C. 6201 et seq.); 
(2) was incorporated as a private, nonprofit 
corporation on March 11, 1996; and 
(3) made its inaugural broadcast in Mandarin 
to the Chinese people on September 29, 1996; 
Whereas Burma, Vietnam, China, and North 
Korea rank amongst the world’s 10 worst coun-
tries for media freedom in Reporters Without 
Borders’ 2022 World Press Freedom Index, as 
based on an evaluation of pluralism, independ-
ence of the media, quality of legislative frame-
work, and safety of journalists; 
Whereas Radio Free Asia delivers program-
ming and content using many media platforms, 
including radio, television, and the internet, in 
the languages of Mandarin, Korean, Burmese, 
Tibetan, Uyghur, Khmer (Cambodian), Can-
tonese, Lao, and Vietnamese, and through 
English translations and content on the website 
and social media of Radio Free Asia; 
Whereas 
Radio 
Free 
Asia 
launched 
BenarNews in 2015, an online news affiliate that 
publishes news and content for audiences in In-
donesia, Bangladesh, Malaysia, Thailand, and 
the Philippines that is focused on the con-
sequences of extremism and contributes to cov-
erage by Radio Free Asia of the influence of the 
People’s Republic of China in Southeast Asia 
and the expanded military presence of the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China in the South China Sea; 
Whereas Radio Free Asia in 2020 launched on-
line 
brand, 
WHYNOT/WAINAO, 
engaging 
younger Chinese Mandarin-speaking audiences 
around the world, who are often skeptical of 
pervasive Chinese government narratives, fos-
tering an open dialogue on banned or under- 
covered topics through probing independent- 
thinking journalism, features, and content; 
Whereas Radio Free Asia, consistent with its 
congressional mandate of editorial independ-
ence, works to ensure that its journalists and 
services adhere to the highest journalistic stand-
ards and ethics, without influence or inter-
ference by the United States Government or any 
administration; 
Whereas the Uyghur Service of Radio Free 
Asia has served a vital role by providing an 
independent source of information on the re-
pression and mass detention of Uyghurs and 
members of other ethnic and religious minorities 
in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of 
the People’s Republic of China, helping inform 
the policies of Congress and the executive 
branch, including a determination by the State 
Department that the Chinese government, under 
the direction of the Chinese Communist Party, is 
engaged in genocide against Uyghurs and mem-
bers of other ethnic and religious minority 
groups; 
Whereas Radio Free Asia has documented the 
rapid deterioration of autonomy and democratic 
freedoms in Hong Kong by the Chinese central 
government, including restrictions on freedom of 
speech and the press and crackdowns on activ-
ists, journalists, and protesters; 
Whereas Radio Free Asia has been a primary 
source of information on Tibetan regions in the 
People’s Republic of China, including on the 
March 2008 Lhasa Uprising and ensuing secu-
rity crackdown, the spate of Tibetan self-immo-
lations, and restrictions on Tibetan language, 
education, religious practice, and the display of 
images of the Dalai Lama;

MORNING BUSINESS 
CHIPS ACT OF 2022 
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I 
rise to express my support for the sub-
stitute amendment to the House mes-
sage accompanying H.R. 4346, which is 
the vehicle for the so-called CHIPS 
Act. 
Semiconductors are crucial to nearly 
every sector of our economy. They are 
in our cars and trucks, medical devices, 
and 5G telecommunications equipment. 
America created the semiconductor in-
dustry in the 1960s. We ceded global 
leadership in the 1970s. We regained it, 
to an extent, in the 1990s but have lost 
it again. In 1990, the U.S. share of semi-
conductor manufacturing was 37 per-
cent. By 2020, that share had declined 
to 12 percent. As Mark Muro and Rob-
ert Maxim of the Brookings Institution 
recently reported: 
While the 1990s saw a significant expansion 
in U.S. innovation capacity in semiconduc-
tors, the nation’s production capacity con-
tinued to decline. In some cases, this owed to 
foreign countries out-competing the U.S. on 
labor costs. But more can be attributed to 
the significant subsidies foreign govern-
ments have been providing to build and 
maintain fabrication plans—a level of sup-
port that the U.S. hasn’t matched. 
The Senate is poised, with strong bi-
partisan support, to get the United 
States back on track with respect to 
domestic 
semiconductor 
manufac-
turing, which is critical for our na-
tional and economic security. The sub-
stitute amendment provides $54 billion 
in grants to domestic manufacturers 
and another $24 billion in tax credits 
through the Creating Helpful Incen-
tives 
to 
Produce 
Semiconductors— 
CHIPS—for America Fund. The sub-
stitute amendment also authorizes $102 
billion over the next 5 years for the Na-
tional Science Foundation—NSF—the 
Department of Commerce, and the Na-
tional Institute of Standards and Tech-
nology—NIST—a $52 billion increase 
over the Congressional Budget Office— 
CBO—baseline. 
These funds will be a ‘‘shot in the 
arm’’ for domestic manufacturing; here 
is a list of some firms that plan to use 
funding to expand or establish manu-
facturing facilities: Intel and TSMC 
plan to build factories in Ohio and Ari-
zona; GlobalFoundries wants to expand 
a 
facility 
in 
upstate 
New 
York; 
SkyWater Technology and Purdue Uni-
versity want to collaborate on a new 
$1.8 billion factory and research facil-
ity West Lafayette, IN; and IBM and 
the State University of New York at 
Albany want to establish a semicon-
ductor research center in Albany. 
While the substitute amendment is 
necessary, it is not sufficient. It does 
not extend the Trade Adjustment As-
sistance—TAA—Small Business Inno-
vation Research—SBIR—or Small Busi-
ness Technology Transfer—STTR—Pro-
grams, for instance. 
Fortunately, conferees are still work-
ing on those and other provisions from 
the Senate-passed United States Inno-
vation and Competition Act—USICA— 
and the House-passed America Creating 
Opportunities for Manufacturing, Pre- 
Eminence in Technology, and Eco-
nomic Strength—America COMPETES 
Act. I hope the Senate will have the op-
portunity to vote on a conference re-
port that covers many issues the sub-
stitute amendment does not address. 
Many Senators have spoken on the 
floor about the importance of the semi-
conductor incentives in division A of 
the substitute amendment, and I have 
just added my voice to that chorus. 
But I would also like to highlight the 
science provisions included in division 
B, which are also important. division B 
authorizes: $20 billion for the first-of- 
its-kind NSF Directorate for Tech-
nology, Innovation, and Partnerships, 
which will accelerate domestic devel-
opment of critical national and eco-
nomic security technologies such as ar-
tificial intelligence, quantum 
com-
puting, advanced manufacturing, 6G 
communications, energy, and material 
science; $9 billion—$4 billion over the 
CBO baseline—for several NIST initia-
tives and programs, including a tri-
pling of funding for the Manufacturing 
Extension 
Program—MEP—and 
leverages the MEP to create a national 
supply chain database, which will as-
sist businesses with supplier scouting 
and minimize supply chain disruptions; 
and the National Aeronautics and 
Space 
Administration’s—NASA— 
Artemis Program to return Americans 
to the Moon as a prelude to sending hu-
mans to Mars. 
Division B also extends the Inter-
national Space Station through 2030 
and supports a balanced science port-
folio, including Earth science observa-
tions and continued development of the 
Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. 
Division B codifies the Planetary De-
fense Coordination Office and requires 
NASA to continue efforts to protect 
Earth from asteroids and comets. Just 
2 months from now, the Double Aster-
oid Redirection Test—DART—will de-
liberately crash a probe into the 
minor-planet moon Dimorphos of the 
double 
asteroid 
Didymos 
to 
shift 
Dimorphos’s orbit. The asteroid poses 
no actual threat to Earth; it was mere-
ly selected for the test to assess our 
ability to deflect an asteroid on a colli-
sion course with Earth through kinetic 
energy. 
I introduced the Cleaner, Quieter Air-
planes Act in the previous Congress 
and again this year and am pleased

that division B directs NASA to con-
tinue research in aeronautics, includ-
ing the use of experimental aircraft, to 
advance aircraft efficiency and super-
sonic flight. 
Finally, 
division 
B 
requires 
the 
White House Office of Science and 
Technology Policy—OSTP—to promul-
gate guidance to all Federal research 
Agencies that would: prohibit Federal 
research Agency personnel from par-
ticipating in foreign talent recruit-
ment programs; require covered indi-
viduals on applications, e.g., principal 
investigators, to disclose participation 
in foreign talent recruitment pro-
grams; and prohibit awards in cases 
where covered individuals are partici-
pating in malign foreign talent recruit-
ment programs. 
In the aggregate, the substitute 
amendment will help the United States 
recapture and maintain its techno-
logical preeminence in so many sec-
tors. I want to thank and congratulate 
Leaders SCHUMER and MCCONNELL and 
Senators CANTWELL and CORNYN and so 
many others who have been instru-
mental in bringing the Senate to this 
point. As I said a moment ago, how-
ever, our work does not end here. I en-
treat the USICA/America COMPETES 
Act conferees to reach an agreement so 
that the Senate may consider the myr-
iad provisions not contained in the sub-
stitute 
amendment—provisions 
that 
are equally important to our economic 
and national security. 
As with the Infrastructure Invest-
ment and Jobs Act, we are dem-
onstrating that the Senate can work in 
a bipartisan fashion to pass bills that 
make life better for all Americans.

HONORING DEPUTY SHERIFF 
BRANDON SHIRLEY 
Mr. PAUL. Madam President, the 
Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office has 
lost one of its own. Deputy Sheriff 
Brandon Shirley, 26, of Louisville, was 
fatally shot by two suspects. It is pain-
ful whenever we lose an officer, but it 
is especially horrendous when that loss 
is for no apparent reason. 
Deputy Sheriff Shirley was working 
as a security officer at Rockford Lane 
Auto Sales when he was shot at ap-
proximately 2:30 a.m. Brandon was able 
to report the shooting on his radio and 
was transported to the University of 
Louisville Hospital, where he ulti-
mately succumbed to his wounds. 
In a particularly agonizing moment 
for our country, Deputy Sheriff Shirley 
was the 25,000th law enforcement offi-
cer killed in our Nation’s history, ac-
cording to the Officer Down Memorial 
Page, a nonprofit organization that re-
ports U.S. law enforcement deaths. 
Deputy Sheriff Shirley was well-liked 
and respected by his colleagues and su-
pervisors. 
Jefferson 
County 
Sheriff 
John Aubrey shared these kind words, 
‘‘He loved being a deputy sheriff, and 
he was a good one.’’ He was equally 
praised by Lt. Col. Carl Yates of the 
sheriff’s office as being ‘‘very active, 
proactive, courageous, a good Deputy, 
and well-liked.’’ 
Deputy Sheriff Brandon Shirley was 
an asset to the residents of Louisville 
and a testament to the Jefferson Coun-
ty Sheriff’s Office. I am proud to salute 
Brandon and mourn alongside the en-
tire Shirley family.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
REMEMBERING TOM POBEREZNY 
∑ Mr. 
INHOFE. 
Madam 
President, 
today, I would like to recognize and 
honor the life of my friend and fellow 
aviator, Tom Poberezny, after his pass-
ing earlier this week. It is no coinci-
dence that this week is the annual Ex-
perimental 
Aircraft 
Association— 
EAA—AirVenture air show in Oshkosh, 
Wisconsin, an event that Tom was 
monumental in propelling to a world- 
level aviation event. 
Tom and I got to know each other at 
this event, and I am grateful for the 
fellowship we built over a shared love 
of aviation. Like his father, the found-
er of EAA Paul Poberezny, Tom was 
first 
appointed 
chairman 
to 
EAA 
AirVenture in 1977. At the time, it was 
simply a national gathering of small 
plane enthusiasts. Under his leader-
ship, it grew into an international 
event with hundreds of thousands of 
visitors every year. 
Like me, Tom was a lifelong aviation 
enthusiast. There is no doubt that Tom 
had a long-lasting impact on the avia-
tion community, from his involvement 
with the U.S. National Unlimited Aero-
batic Team to his presidency of EAA. 
As president of EAA, Tom had a leader-
ship role advocating for sport pilots 
and light-sport category aircraft, and 
he spearheaded the construction of the 
current EAA Aviation Center head-
quarters and museum complex in Osh-
kosh, WI. 
Tom recognized the importance of 
growing the next generation of avi-
ators. In 1992, he led the creation of the 
Young Eagles program designed to give 
young kids an opportunity to experi-
ence flight in a general aviation air-
plane while educating them about avia-
tion. In 2003, Tom played a pivotal 
leadership role as a member of the Cen-
tennial of Flight Commission to com-
memorate the Wright Brothers’ his-
toric first flight. 
When Tom retired from EAA, his 
work wasn’t finished. He served on the 
boards of several organizations includ-
ing Angel Flight West, which provides 
free air transportation for passengers 
in need of medical treatment far from 
home. 
Throughout the years, Tom was rec-
ognized for his notable contributions to 
the aviation community. In 1996, he 
was inducted into the Wisconsin Avia-
tion Hall of Fame, and 20 years later, 
he was inducted into the National 
Aviation Hall of Fame. Tom’s dedica-
tion to aviation serves as an example 
for us all, and his legacy will stand the 
test of time. 
Most aviators know Tom’s history, 
but what they may not be aware of was 
his close relationship with individuals 
in the aviation community. I was with 
Tom at Oshkosh since 1979, the very 
first year I went with my two young 
aviator sons. We didn’t miss a single 
Oshkosh in 43 years, and each reunion 
was one of my happiest moments. We 
are part of the Tom Poberezny family, 
and for that reason, the relationship is 
very special. 
Kay and I join his family in their 
grief and in celebrating the life of Tom 
Poberezny, a remarkable champion of 
aviation.∑

RECOGNIZING FC WICHITA 
∑ Mr. MARSHALL. Madam President, I 
rise today to honor and recognize FC 
Wichita’s 12-year-old youth girls’ soc-
cer team. 
FC Wichita’s 12-year-old youth girls’ 
soccer team recently took the first 
place title at the U.S. Cup Champion-
ship in Blaine, MN. This win is one of 
the most prestigious victories a youth 
team can attain, making their team 
the first in the history of the FC Wich-
ita program to win a U.S. Cup Cham-
pionship 
title. 
FC 
Wichita 
went 
undefeated in five games, which in-
cluded a 2–1 victory over JaHbat FC in 
the semifinals and a 3–2 victory in pen-
alty kicks over Minnesota’s Manitou 
FC in Saturday’s championship game. 
The U.S. Cup title was the cherry on 
top of an outstanding summer for the 
FC Wichita girls’ team in which they 
also won the Real Colorado Cup. 
It is my honor to congratulate FC 
Wichita on such a wonderful season, 
and I would like to recognize both the 
players and the coaches for their hard 
work in this season. Their numerous 
accomplishments have made the great 
State of Kansas proud. 
I now ask my colleagues to join me 
in recognizing the FC Wichita’s 12- 
year-old youth girls’ soccer team for 
their outstanding athletic accomplish-
ments and the determination displayed 
during their U.S. Cup Championship 
victory.∑

TRIBUTE TO KATHERINE 
WETHERTON 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, every 
Member of Congress vividly remembers 
his or her path toward engagement in 
our government. Some have been more 
circuitous than others, but we all re-
member how that spark was ignited 
and how action ensued. 
Katherine Wetherton, a freshman at 
the University of Louisville, hopes to 
kindle that passion for civic engage-
ment in young women. In doing so, 
Katherine wrote a book for middle and 
high school students entitled ‘‘She 
Rocks the Vote.’’ She distributes it at 
seminars, workshops, and the Little 
Free Library, which she built and in-
stalled in her hometown in Oldham 
County. 
A results-focused young woman, Kate 
was active in Girl Scouts for 13 years

POM–167. A resolution from the House of 
Representatives of the Commonwealth of 
Puerto Rico supporting the congressional 
bill H.R. 7409, known as the ‘‘Territorial Re-
lief Under Sustainable Transitions for Puer-
to Rico Act of 2022’’ (Trust for Puerto Rico 
Act of 2022), introduced by Congressman 
Ritchie Torres, that would amend the Puerto 
Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic 
Stability Act (PROMESA) in order to facili-
tate the termination of the Financial Over-
sight Board after certification of a balanced 
budget for two consecutive fiscal years; to 
the Committee on Energy and Natural Re-
sources. 
HOUSE RESOLUTION NO. 764 
Over the past decades, Puerto Rico’s eco-
nomic growth has experienced a deceleration 
that has resulted in the loss of competition 
in the private sector and a severe financial 
crisis in the governmental sector. 
The Island’s economic recession began in 
2006. However, it should be noted that the fi-
nancial crisis precedes it, because previous 
government 
administrations 
issued 
debt 
amounting to billions of dollars to finance 
budget deficits, thus presenting to the Island 
the illusion of a balanced budget, as provided 
by our Constitution. It is worth noting that 
a $45 billion debt was issued between 2000 and 
2012. Approximately half of the money was 
used to finance budget deficits and to defray 
the government’s payroll expense and spend-
ing. 
We must remember that the financial cri-
sis broke that started during the first decade 
of the 21st century led to the subsequent en-
actment of the Puerto Rico Oversight, Man-
agement, 
and 
Economic 
Stability 
Act 
(PROMESA) and the creation of the Finan-
cial 
Oversight 
Board, 
hereinafter 
the 
‘‘Board,’’ for the purpose of managing Puerto 
Rico’s finances. 
Ever since PROMESA and the Board be-
came effective in 2016, the government of 
Puerto Rico has maneuvered to meet the fi-
nancial requirements imposed within this 
new reality. Under PROMESA, the terri-
torial government must approve a balanced 
budget for four (4) consecutive fiscal years in 
order to require the termination of the 
Board. Given this scenario, it must be noted 
that, since the Board began operations, the 
first balanced budget was approved by the 
current Legislative Assembly for fiscal year 
2021–2022. 
In view of this context, and given the im-
position of an antidemocratic body such as 
the Financial Oversight Board, Congressman 
RITCHIE TORRES started this initiative to 
amend PROMESA in order to reduce the re-
quired number of balanced budgets to four (4) 
to just two (2). Furthermore, this measures 
establishes that the Board shall be termi-
nated 90 days after the certification of the 
second balanced budget. Thus, any ambi-
guity within the statute in effect regarding 
the Board’s termination is eliminated. 
This House of Representatives believes 
that the bill introduced by Congressman 
RITCHIE TORRES (H.R. 7409, better known as 
‘‘Trust for Puerto Rico Act of 2022’’) provides 
a mechanism to restore power to the people 
of Puerto Rico, and consequently, to its 
democratically elected officials. Liberty and 
democracy are two pillars of our government 
and our goal must be to strengthen them; 
therefore, we are duty-bound to promote and 
support policies aimed at its attainment. It 
is time to raise our voices and join in any ef-
fort that seeks to restore the people of Puer-
to Rico’s control and power over its finances 
as soon as possible. 
For all of the foregoing, this House of Rep-
resentatives expresses its firm support to 
congressional bill H.R. 7409, known as the 
‘‘Territorial Relief Under Sustainable Tran-
sitions for Puerto Rico Act of 2022’’ (Trust 
for Puerto Rico Act of 2022), introduced by 
Congressman 
RITCHIE
TORRES. 
This 
bill 
would amend the Puerto Rico Oversight, 
Management, and Economic Stability Act 
(PROMESA) in order to facilitate the termi-
nation of the Financial Oversight Board 
after the certification of a balanced budget 
for two consecutive fiscal years. 
Be it resolved by the House of Representatives 
of Puerto Rico: 
Section 1.—The House of Representatives 
of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico hereby 
expresses its firm support to congressional 
bill H.R. 7409, known as the ‘‘Territorial Re-
lief Under Sustainable Transitions for Puer-
to Rico Act of 2022’’ (Trust for Puerto Rico 
Act of 2022), introduced by Congressman 
RITCHIE TORRES, that would amend the Puer-
to Rico Oversight, Management, and Eco-
nomic Stability Act (PROMESA) in order to 
facilitate the termination of the Financial 
Oversight Board after the certification of a 
balanced budget for two consecutive fiscal 
years. 
Section 2.—A copy of this Resolution shall 
be translated into the English language and 
delivered to the President of the United 
States of America, Joseph R. Biden and the 
leadership of the United States Congress. 
Section 3.—This Resolution shall take ef-
fect upon its approval. 
POM–168. A resolution adopted by the Sen-
ate of the State of Hawaii urging the United 
States Congress and Hawaii’s congressional 
delegation to support legislation estab-
lishing medicare for all; to the Committee 
on Finance. 
SENATE RESOLUTION NO. 201 
Whereas, Hawaii’s residents deserve high 
quality health care; and 
Whereas, the economic vitality of Hawaii 
is closely linked to the physical well-being of 
its residents; and 
Whereas, the novel coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID–19) pandemic led to record levels of 
unemployment and the loss of employer- 
sponsored health insurance for hundreds of 
thousands of Hawaii’s workers; and 
Whereas, according to a University of 
Michigan study published in 2010, Native Ha-
waiians are far more likely to suffer an early 
death in comparison to Caucasians; and 
Whereas, people often delay needed med-
ical treatments due to an inability to pay for 
health care costs, which further jeopardizes 
the health of those individuals; and 
Whereas, these individuals are signifi-
cantly more likely to develop serious illness 
if they contract COVID–19; and 
Whereas, managed care and other market- 
based reforms have failed to contain health 
care costs, resulting in medical problems and 
cost burdens for working families; and 
Whereas, under a single-payer health care 
system, nonmedical expenses nationwide 
could be reduced to approximately six to 
eight percent of total health care costs, sav-
ing more than one trillion dollars; and 
Whereas, Medicare for All would provide 
national health insurance without copay-
ments and deductibles for every person in 
the United States for all necessary medical 
care, including prescription drugs, hospital 
visits, surgical and outpatient services, pri-
mary and preventive care, emergency serv-
ices, reproductive care, dental and vision 
services, and long-term care; now, therefore, 
Be it 
Resolved by the Senate of the Thirty-first 
Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular 
Session of 2022, that the United States Con-
gress and Hawaii’s congressional delegation 
are urged to support legislation establishing 
Medicare for All; and be it further 
Resolved, That certified copies of this Reso-
lution be transmitted to the Speaker of the 
United States House of Representatives, 
President of the United States Senate, and 
members of the Hawaii congressional delega-
tion.

ongoing commitment to the goals of the 
Paris Climate Agreement, the United Na-
tions Sustainable Development Goals, and 
endorsement of the Fossil Fuel Non-Pro-
liferation Treaty; to the Committee on For-
eign Relations. 
SENATE RESOLUTION NO. 95 
Whereas, the scientific consensus is clear 
that human activities are primarily respon-
sible for accelerating global climate change, 
and that the climate crisis now represents 
one of the preeminent threats to global civ-
ilization; and 
Whereas, the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change (IPCC) reported in 2018 that 
we must achieve net zero in greenhouse gas 
emissions (GHGs) by the middle of this cen-
tury in order to have a reasonable chance of 
limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Cel-
sius; and 
Whereas, the IPCC released its Sixth As-
sessment Report from Working Group II, 
which was approved by one hundred ninety- 
five member states, in February 2022, and the 
summary for policy makers notes that there 
is high confidence that ‘‘the rise in weather 
and climate extremes has led to some irre-
versible impacts as natural and human sys-
tems are pushed beyond their ability to 
adapt’’; and 
Whereas, the United Nations (UN) Sec-
retary-General Antonio Guteres, responded, 
‘‘The IPCC is an atlas of human suffering 
. . . according to current commitment, glob-
al emissions are set to increase almost 14 
percent . . . . It will destroy any chance of 
keeping 1.5 alive . . . coal and other fossil 
fuels are choking humanity’’; and 
Whereas, the UN Human Rights Council in 
2021 adopted landmark legislation, Resolu-
tion 48/13, recognizing a clean, healthy and 
sustainable environment is a human right; 
and 
Whereas, changes in Hawaii’s climate are 
already being felt, as evidenced by rising sea 
levels, coastal inundation, ocean warming as 
well as coral bleaching, heightened risk of 
wild fires, and increasing severe storms; and 
Whereas, the entire community is im-
pacted by the health and safety risks of fos-
sil fuel expansion, particularly those who 
also face socioeconomic and health inequi-
ties, including low-income families, those ex-
periencing homelessness, people of color and 
indigenous peoples, youth, seniors, those ex-
periencing mental and physical disabilities, 
and people with health conditions; and 
Whereas, youth and future generations 
have the most to lose from a lack of imme-
diate action to stop fossil fuel expansion as 
they face major and lifelong health, ecologi-
cal, social, and economic impacts from pro-
longed and cumulative effects of climate 
change, including food and water shortages, 
infectious diseases, and natural disasters; 
and 
Whereas, the Paris Climate Agreement is 
silent on coal, oil, and gas, an omission with 
respect to the supply and production of fossil 
fuels (the largest source of GHGs) that needs 
to be collectively addressed by other means; 
and 
Whereas, the Glasgow Climate Pact im-
proved incrementally only calling for a 
phase down not a phase out of coal; and 
Whereas, global governments and the fossil 
fuel industry are currently planning to 
produce about one hundred twenty percent 
more emissions by 2030 than what is needed 
to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius and 
avert catastrophic climate disruption, and 
such plans risk undoing the work of the 
State to reduce GHG emissions; and 
Whereas, the fossil fuel industry is cur-
rently 
claiming 
over 
fifty 
percent 
of 
coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic recovery 
funding from senior levels of government in 
the G20, thereby siphoning away recovery 
funding badly needed by cities and other in-
dustries; and 
Whereas, the construction of new fossil 
fuel infrastructure and expanded reliance on 
fossil fuels exposes communities to unten-
able risks to public health and safety at the 
local and global levels; and 
Whereas, the economic opportunities pre-
sented by a clean energy transition far out-
weigh the opportunities presented by an 
economy supported by expanding fossil fuel 
use and extraction; and 
Whereas, the community is committed, as 
part of the climate emergency response, to a 
just energy transition and to ambitious in-
vestments in the green infrastructure and in-
dustries that will create jobs and rapidly 
decarbonize the economy; and 
Whereas, Hawaii recognizes that it is the 
urgent responsibility and moral obligation of 
wealthy fossil fuel producers to lead in put-
ting an end to fossil fuel development and to 
manage the decline of existing production; 
and 
Whereas, a new global initiative is under-
way calling for a Fossil Fuel Non-Prolifera-
tion Treaty that would end new fossil fuel 
exploration and expansion, phase out exist-
ing production in line with the global com-
mitment to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Cel-
sius, and accelerate equitable transition 
plans: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the Senate of the Thirty-first Leg-
islature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session 
of 2022, that this body affirms the State’s on-
going commitment to the goals of the Paris 
Climate Agreement, the UN Sustainable De-
velopment Goals, and the GHG reduction 
targets as called for by the IPCC, and pledges 
to meet its proportionate greenhouse gas re-
ductions under the Paris Climate Agree-
ment; and be it further 
Resolved, That the State and each county 
are requested to formally endorse the call for 
a Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty; and 
be it further 
Resolved, That the U.S. government is 
urged to support the initiative for a Fossil 
Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty; and be it fur-
ther 
Resolved, That certified copies of this Reso-
lution be transmitted to the United Nations 
Secretary General and High Commissioner 
for Human Rights, President and Vice Presi-
dent of the United States, President Pro 
Tempore of the United States Senate, Major-
ity and Minority Leaders of the United 
States Senate, Speaker and Minority Leader 
of the United States House of Representa-
tives, members of the Hawaii congressional 
delegation, Governor, and Mayor of each 
county. 
POM–170. A resolution adopted by the Sen-
ate of the State of Hawaii urging the Presi-
dent of the United States to issue a presi-
dential directive ordering federal agencies to 
report disaggregated Native Hawaiian and 
Pacific Islander data in compliance with the 
Office of Management and Budget Statistical 
Directive No. 15; to the Committee on Home-
land Security and Governmental Affairs. 
SENATE RESOLUTION NO. 82 
Whereas, racial and ethnic data play a crit-
ical role in identifying disparities, moni-
toring programs for civil rights compliance, 
informing public policy development, and 
guiding funding priorities; and 
Whereas, the Association of Hawaiian Civic 
Clubs has adopted over thirty resolutions 
since 2005 that either cited disaggregated 
data in support of Native Hawaiian issues, 
honored Native Hawaiian-serving institu-
tions and community members that contrib-
uted or safeguarded Native Hawaiian data, or 
urged government agencies at the federal, 
state, and local levels to provide data 
disaggregating Native Hawaiians and other 
Pacific Islanders, including Resolutions 2020– 
42, 2019–46, 2013–16, 2012–12, 2010–20, and 2008– 
35; and 
Whereas, the federal Office of Management 
and Budget revised Statistical Policy Direc-
tive No. 15 in 1997, separating the ‘‘Asian and 
Pacific Islander’’ category into the ‘‘Asian’’ 
and ‘‘Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Is-
lander’’ categories; and 
Whereas, numerous data reports at the 
local, state, and federal level continue to fail 
to report disaggregated Native Hawaiian 
data as detailed in ‘‘Data Justice: About Us, 
By Us, For Us,’’ issued by the Hawai’i Budget 
and Policy Center and Papa Ola Lokahi on 
March 5, 2021; and 
Whereas, the importance of urging govern-
ment agencies to improve data collection 
and 
reporting 
practices 
and 
access 
to 
disaggregated Native Hawaiian data has been 
recognized by the Legislature through the 
resolution titled, ‘‘Recognizing the impor-
tance of 21st Century Data Governance and 
Fact-Based Policymaking’’, and by the City 
and County of Honolulu through the resolu-
tion titled, ‘‘Urging the State of Hawaii and 
the 
City 
and 
County 
of 
Honolulu 
to 
Disaggregate Racial Data Collection and Re-
porting Beyond Federal Minimum Stand-
ards’’; and 
Whereas, California Government Codes 
8310.5 and 8310.7, explicitly require California 
state agencies to collect data for each major 
Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander group, 
including 
‘‘Hawaiians’’, 
separate 
from 
‘‘Samoans’’, 
‘‘Tongans’’, 
‘‘Fijians’’, 
and 
‘‘Chamorros’’; and 
Whereas, Hawaii and California have re-
leased 
disaggregated 
Native 
Hawaiian 
COVID–19 case and death data that identified 
disparities between Native Hawaiians and 
other Pacific Islander groups, which has con-
tributed to the justification of more cul-
turally tailored and effective services; and 
Whereas, numerous federal agencies fail to 
utilize 
a 
‘‘Native 
Hawaiian 
& 
Pacific 
lslander’’ category when reporting data from 
critical surveys, such as the United States 
Department of Education’s Early Childhood 
Longitudinal Survey and the United States 
Department of Health and Human Services’ 
National Health Interview Survey, among 
others; and 
Whereas, article II, section 1, clause 1, of 
the United States Constitution vests in the 
President the discretion to issue federal di-
rectives for the purpose of managing execu-
tive branch resources; and 
Whereas, the Office of Management and 
Budget is an office within the Executive Of-
fice of the President of the United States; 
now, therefore, be it, 
Resolved, by the Senate of the Thirty-first 
Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular 
Session of 2022, that the President of the 
United States is urged to issue a presidential 
directive ordering federal agencies to report 
disaggregated Native Hawaiian and Pacific 
Islander data in compliance with the Office 
of Management and Budget Statistical Pol-
icy Directive No. 15; and be it further 
Resolved, That the President of the United 
States is urged to issue a presidential direc-

dress the fragmented nature and incon-
sistent implementation of international en-
vironmental law by enumerating funda-
mental climate change principles in one le-
gally binding framework for current and fu-
ture generations for equity and equality; and 
Whereas, the Global Pact will serve as a 
cornerstone in international human rights 
and environmental law and create a more co-
herent global environmental governance; 
and 
Whereas, the Global Pact addresses the 
challenges posed by environmental degrada-
tion in the context of sustainable develop-
ment and induces a greater degree of uni-
formity for environmental laws in all states; 
and 
Whereas, the Global Pact consists of over 
two dozen articles that cover a variety of 
topics and ideas to consider for implementa-
tion, including: 
(1) The right to an ecologically sound envi-
ronment; 
(2) The duty to take care of the environ-
ment; 
(3) Integration and sustainable develop-
ment; 
(4) Intergenerational equity; 
(5) Prevention; 
(6) Precaution; 
(7) Environmental damages; 
(8) Polluter-pays; 
(9) Access to information; 
(10) Public participation; 
(11) Access to environmental justice; 
(12) Education and training; 
(13) Research and innovation; 
(14) The role of non-state actors and sub-
national entities; 
(15) The effectiveness of environmental 
norms; 
(16) Resilience; 
(17) Environmental non-regression; 
(18) Cooperation; 
(19) Armed conflicts; 
(20) The diversity of national situations; 
(21) Monitoring implementation of the 
Pact; and 
(22) Other topics focusing on the Secre-
tariat, signature, ratification, acceptance, 
approval, entry into force, denunciation, and 
depositary; and 
Whereas, the Global Pact provides an agen-
da based upon the articles for grassroots and 
global action to generate the political will to 
protect the planet today and tomorrow; and 
Whereas, the State desires to promote sus-
tainable development where each generation 
can satisfy its needs without compromising 
the capability of future generations to meet 
their needs to respect the balance and integ-
rity of the Earth’s and Hawai‘i’s fragile eco-
system; and 
Whereas, Hawai‘i emphasizes the vital role 
of women to achieve the United Nations sus-
tainable development goals and the neces-
sity to promote gender equality and em-
powerment of wahine for global general well- 
being; and 
Whereas, Hawai‘i is already involved in 
international initiatives to protect the plan-
et and the Oceania region by actively par-
ticipating in many United Nations annual 
sessions and meetings and by partnering 
with United Nations specialized agencies, 
programs, and funds, including partnering 
with the United Nations Office of the High 
Commissioner for Human Rights and partici-
pating in the United Nations Environment 
Programme; and 
Whereas, in Hawai‘i, college, community, 
and capitol dialogues on the Paris Agree-
ment and the 2030 Development Agenda, 
among other climate change topics, continue 
to generate genuine insight that contributes 
to Voluntary Local Reviews, which are vol-
untary reports to the United Nations on 
local progress on implementing the United 
Nations sustainable development goals; and 
Whereas, 
local 
opportunities 
for 
the 
State’s youth to learn about and participate 
in climate change initiatives include oppor-
tunities at colleges and universities that 
provide input on achieving the Global Pact, 
with a focus on research and innovation, and 
participation in a Hawai‘i human rights and 
resilience process; now, therefore, Resolved, 
By the Senate of the Thirty-first Legislature 
of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 
2022, that the State and each county are 
urged to adopt the Global Pact to achieve 
the United Nations Paris Agreement and the 
2030 Development Agenda, and to specifically 
adopt the United Nations sustainable devel-
opment goals, numbers 13 through 17; and be 
it further 
Resolved, That the Global Pact should be 
embraced and that protection of nature 
should be the centerpiece of the State’s poli-
cies and practices; and be it further 
Resolved, That certified copies of this Reso-
lution be transmitted to the United Nations 
Secretary General and High Commissioner 
for Human Rights, President and Vice Presi-
dent of the United States, President Pro 
Tempore of the United States Senate, Major-
ity and Minority Leaders of the United 
States Senate, Speaker and Minority Leader 
of the United States House of Representa-
tives, each member of Hawai‘i’s congres-
sional delegation, Governor, and mayors of 
each county of Hawai‘i.

State of Texas relative to enactment of fed-
eral legislation allowing the general public 
96 hours to examine bills or resolutions; to 
the Committee on Rules and Administration.

By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and 
Mr. CARDIN): 
S. 4618. A bill to improve access to 
opioid use disorder treatment services 
under the Medicare program; to the 
Committee on Finance. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the 
opioid epidemic continues to claim the 
lives of far too many people, with 
record numbers of both Mainers and 
Americans lost in 2021. While many 
perceive the face of opioid addiction as 
young, the epidemic harms older adults 
as well. In Maine, more than 10 percent 
of drug overdose deaths last year were 
among residents 60 and older. 
Each and every opioid death is pre-
ventable, but we must ensure the 
unique needs of seniors struggling with 
addiction are not forgotten. That is 
why I rise today with my colleague 
from Maryland, Senator CARDIN, to in-
troduce legislation to improve seniors’ 
awareness of, and access to, opioid use 
disorder, OUD, treatment covered by 
the Medicare Program. Our bill, the 
Supporting Seniors with Opioid Use 
Disorder Act of 2022, is in response to 
recent findings from the inspector gen-
eral that confirm the urgent need to 
increase the number of Medicare bene-
ficiaries receiving treatment for opioid 
use disorder. 
The challenges of the COVID–19 pan-
demic, combined with the increased 
prevalence of fentanyl, have aggra-
vated this national crisis. Even before 
COVID–19, however, the number of peo-
ple age 55 or older treated in emer-
gency 
rooms 
for 
nonfatal 
opioid 
overdoses was increasing, with a shock-
ing 32 percent jump in E.R. visits from 
2016 to 2017. In 2018, as chairman of the 
Senate Special Committee on Aging, I 
chaired a hearing on this very topic in 
attempt to shed light on this often- 
overlooked population. One expert wit-
ness told the Aging Committee, ‘‘Medi-
care beneficiaries are the fastest grow-
ing population of diagnosed opioid use 
disorders.’’ 
Compounding these disturbing statis-
tics is a December 2021 Department of 
Health and Human Services Office of 
Inspector General, OIG, report explor-
ing 
whether 
Medicare 
beneficiaries 
with opioid use disorder receive medi-
cation and behavioral therapy. It found 
more than 1 million Medicare bene-
ficiaries were diagnosed with OUD in 
2020, yet fewer than 16 percent of those 
patients received medication to treat 
their OUD. The report also concluded 
older beneficiaries were three times 
less likely to receive medication to 
treat their OUD than younger bene-
ficiaries. Even fewer beneficiaries re-
ceived both medication and behavioral 
therapy. The conclusion is clear: Medi-
care beneficiaries are not receiving the 
OUD treatment they need. 
Our bill, the Supporting Seniors with 
Opioid Use Disorder Act of 2022, would 
codify the recommendations made by 
the HHS OIG regarding how to improve 
beneficiaries’ awareness of Medicare 
coverage for OUD treatment and how 
to identify current gaps and opportuni-
ties to better meet the needs of this 
unique population. Specifically, our 
legislation would require CMS to con-
duct 
additional 
outreach 
to 
bene-
ficiaries to increase awareness about 
Medicare coverage for the treatment of 
OUD, such as by revising outreach and 
enrollment materials, making State 
and national contact information for 
healthcare providers publicly available 
in an easily accessible manner, and de-
veloping or improving continuing edu-
cation programs on opioid medications

and substance use disorder treatment 
programs. Our bill would also improve 
data sharing within Agencies at HHS 
with the goal of obtaining a better un-
derstanding of current treatment gaps. 
Lastly, the bill would require HHS to 
convene a stakeholder meeting to 
share best practices on the use of be-
havioral therapy among beneficiaries 
receiving medication to treat opioid 
use disorder. Emerging research points 
to evidence that patients receiving 
medication to treat opioid use disorder 
may also benefit from behavioral ther-
apy, so this opportunity for collabora-
tion on strategies to support better 
treatment engagement and continuity 
could be beneficial to both patients and 
healthcare professionals. 
The overdose crisis continues to rav-
age the country, and it is critical that 
people who are suffering from opioid 
use disorder have access to the treat-
ment they need to survive and thrive— 
including our seniors. Challenges in 
treatment and recovery undoubtedly 
persist, but the actions taken in this 
legislation can help guide our contin-
ued response. I urge my colleagues to 
support the adoption of this important 
legislation that will support seniors’ 
access to opioid use disorder services 
and our understanding of potential dis-
parities in treatment.

‘‘AMERICAN 
GROWN 
FLOWER 
AND FOLIAGE MONTH’’ 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. 
SULLIVAN, and Mr. PADILLA) submitted 
the following resolution; which was 
considered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 720 
Whereas cut flower and foliage growers in 
the United States are hard-working, dedi-
cated individuals who bring beauty, eco-
nomic stimulus, and pride to their commu-
nities and the United States; 
Whereas the people of the United States 
have a long history of using flowers and foli-
age grown in the United States to bring 
beauty to important events and express af-
fection for loved ones; 
Whereas 
consumers 
spend 
over 
$38,300,000,000 each year on floral products, 
including cut flowers, garden plants, bed-
ding, and indoor plants; 
Whereas, each year, an increasing number 
of households in the United States purchase 
fresh cut flowers and foliage from more than 
12,000 florists and floral establishments; 
Whereas the annual per capita spending on 
floral products by consumers in the United 
States is more than $170; 
Whereas the people of the United States in-
creasingly want to support domestically pro-
duced foods and agricultural products and 
would prefer to buy locally grown flowers 
and foliage whenever possible, yet a majority 
of domestic consumers do not know where 
the flowers and foliage they purchase are 
grown; 
Whereas, in response to increased demand, 
the ‘‘Certified American Grown’’ logo was 
created in July 2014 in order to educate and 
empower consumers to purchase flowers and 
foliage from domestic producers; 
Whereas millions of stems of domestically 
grown flowers and foliage are now ‘‘Certified 
American Grown’’; 
Whereas domestic flower and foliage farm-
ers produce thousands of varieties of flowers 
and foliage across the United States, such as 
peonies in Alaska, Gerbera daisies in Cali-
fornia, lupines in Maine, tulips in Wash-
ington, lilies in Oregon, larkspur in Texas, 
and leatherleaf in Florida; 
Whereas the flower and foliage varieties 
with the highest production in the United 
States are tulips, Gerbera daisies, lilies, gla-
diolas, roses, and leatherleaf; 
Whereas people in every State have access 
to domestically grown flowers and foliage, 
yet only 22 percent of flowers and foliage 
sold in the United States are domestically 
grown; 
Whereas the domestic cut flower and foli-
age industry— 
(1) creates a substantial economic impact 
daily; and 
(2) supports hundreds of growers, thou-
sands of small businesses, and tens of thou-
sands of jobs in the United States; 
Whereas most domestic cut flowers and fo-
liage are sold in the United States within 24 
to 48 hours after harvest and last longer than 
flowers shipped longer distances; 
Whereas flowers and foliage grown domes-
tically enhance the ability of the people of 
the United States to festively celebrate wed-
dings and births and honor those who have 
passed; 
Whereas flower and foliage giving has been 
a holiday tradition in the United States for 
generations; 
Whereas flowers and foliage speak to the 
beauty of motherhood on Mother’s Day and 
to the spirit of love on Valentine’s Day; 
Whereas flowers and foliage are an essen-
tial part of other holidays such as Thanks-
giving, Christmas, Hanukkah, and Kwanzaa; 
Whereas flowers and foliage help com-
memorate the service and sacrifice of mem-
bers of the Armed Forces on Memorial Day 
and Veterans Day; and 
Whereas the Senate encourages the cul-
tivation of flowers and foliage in the United 
States by domestic flower and foliage farm-
ers: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the designation of July 2022 as 
‘‘American

foliage domestically enhances the ability of 
the people of the United States to festively 
celebrate holidays and special occasions; and 
(5) urges all people of the United States to 
proactively showcase flowers and foliage 
grown in the United States in order to show 
support for— 
(A) the flower and foliage farmers, proc-
essors, and distributors in the United States; 
and 
(B) the agricultural industry of the United 
States overall.

721—CELE-
BRATING 
THE 
50TH 
ANNIVER-
SARY 
OF 
THE 
INAUGURAL 
LAUNCH OF THE LANDSAT SE-
RIES OF EARTH OBSERVATION 
SATELLITES, A JOINT MISSION 
OF THE UNITED STATES GEO-
LOGICAL SURVEY AND THE NA-
TIONAL 
AERONAUTICS 
AND 
SPACE ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. CARDIN (for himself, Mr. THUNE, 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN, and Mr. ROUNDS) sub-
mitted the following resolution; which 
was considered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 721 
Whereas, on July 23, 2022, the United 
States Geological Survey (referred to in this 
preamble as ‘‘USGS’’) and the National Aero-
nautics and Space Administration (referred 
to in this preamble as ‘‘NASA’’) celebrate 
the 50th anniversary of the launch of the 
Landsat series of Earth Observation sat-
ellites (commonly known as the ‘‘Landsat 
program’’); 
Whereas, through satellite remote sensing, 
which in 1972 constituted a new scientific in-
strument, the Landsat program introduced a 
powerful tool for humankind to observe the 
resources 
of 
Earth 
and 
the 
long-term 
changes in the condition of the land surfaces 
of Earth; 
Whereas, as the first civilian program in 
the United States for the systematic obser-
vation of the land surfaces of Earth, the 
Landsat program has exemplified the highest 
ideals of the United Nations Committee on 
the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, while help-
ing to position the United States as a global 
leader in the field of satellite remote sens-
ing; 
Whereas data and imagery of Earth pro-
duced by the Landsat program have been 
used for 50 years in the United States and 
around the world— 
(1) to analyze crop conditions, soil mois-
ture, and global crop production; 
(2) to forecast the needs of the world to en-
sure food security; 
(3) to monitor water consumption; 
(4) to facilitate emergency responses to 
and post-event analyses of natural disasters, 
including earthquakes, volcanoes, floods, 
tsunamis, hurricanes, and wildfires; 
(5) to monitor forests and changing land- 
use patterns; 
(6) to track receding glaciers and changes 
in sea-ice extent; and 
(7) to survey urban growth;7 
Whereas data and imagery produced by the 
Landsat program have been applied by— 
(1) many Federal, State, and local agen-
cies, particularly agencies within the De-
partment of the Interior and the Department 
of Agriculture; and 
(2) the governing bodies of Indian Tribes 
and Alaska Natives to solve difficult and ex-
pensive problems for their members at min-
imum cost to the taxpayers of the United 
States; 
Whereas, since 2008, calibrated on-board 
data and imagery produced by the Landsat 
program have been made globally available 
at no cost to the public, greatly amplifying 
the use of such data and imagery, expanding 
growing markets for commercial remote 
sensing data and analysis, providing the 
foundation for commercial innovations in 
land remote sensing, and serving as a trusted 
reference for the calibration of instruments 
and improvement of commercial data prod-
ucts; 
Whereas data produced by the Landsat pro-
gram has been estimated to provide billions 
of dollars in value to the economy of the 
United States each year; 
Whereas 50 years of continuous Landsat 
observations— 
(1) supply the world with impartial, funda-
mental evidence to support a scientific un-
derstanding of a changing global climate; 
and 
(2) form the basis for thousands of peer-re-
viewed, scientific publications that have doc-
umented changes in the land surface of 
Earth; 
Whereas data produced by the Landsat pro-
gram provide an invaluable common vocabu-
lary and a shared set of references for the 
state of Earth that can inform international, 
Federal, and local efforts to address difficult 
environmental and public policy issues; 
Whereas USGS and NASA are currently de-
veloping mission concepts for Landsat Next, 
the follow-on mission to Landsat 9; 
Whereas Landsat 9 and the Sustainable 
Land Imaging program will build on and 
strengthen this key resource of the United 
States to provide a sustainable, space-based 
system to extend and improve the 50-year se-
ries of science-quality, global land imaging 
measurements produced by the Landsat pro-
gram—the longest time series of the land 
surface of Earth; and 
Whereas, during July 2022, USGS, NASA, 
scientists, engineers, land managers, and the 
people of the United States will celebrate 50 
years since the launch of the first Earth-ob-
serving satellite of the Landsat program: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) celebrates the 50th anniversary of the 
inaugural launch of the Landsat series of 
Earth 
Observation 
satellites 
(commonly 
known as the ‘‘Landsat program’’); 
(2) recognizes the scientific, engineering, 
and analytical expertise of the United States 
Geological Survey (referred to in this resolu-
tion as ‘‘USGS’’), the National Aeronautics 
and Space Administration (referred to in this 
resolution as ‘‘NASA’’), and the advisory 
Landsat Science Team; 
(3) recognizes the important contributions 
that data produced by the Landsat program 
provides to decision-makers worldwide and 
the desire to continue the Landsat program 
into the next 50 years through Landsat Next; 
(4) designates July 23, 2022, as ‘‘Landsat 
50th Anniversary Day’’, or ‘‘Landsaturday’’; 
and 
(5) respectfully requests that the Secretary 
of the Senate transmit an enrolled copy of 
this resolution to the Director of USGS and 
the Administrator of NASA.

Ms. STABENOW (for herself, Mr. 
WARNOCK, Ms. COLLINS, Mr. BOOKER, 
Ms. CANTWELL, Mr. MERKLEY, Mr. KING, 
Mr. OSSOFF, and Mr. PETERS) sub-
mitted the following resolution; which 
was considered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 722 
Whereas blueberries are a native North 
American fruit, first managed and harvested 
as wild blueberries by the native Wabanaki; 
Whereas wild blueberries continue to be 
managed and harvested in Maine by farmers, 
including the Wabanaki, as a native, natu-
rally occurring crop; 
Whereas the pioneering work conducted in 
New Jersey in the early 1900s by Elizabeth 
White and Dr. Frederick Coville, a botanist 
at the Department of Agriculture, to domes-
ticate wild lowbush blueberries resulted in 
the development of the hybrid variety of cul-
tivated highbush blueberries; 
Whereas because of these early efforts, 
highbush blueberries are large, sweet, juicy 
berries that can be commercially produced 
and shipped; 
Whereas wild blueberries— 
(1) are small and sweet; and 
(2) are not planted, but still grow and are 
harvested where they have naturally oc-
curred for thousands of years; 
Whereas the blueberry industry in the 
United States is an important sector of 
United States agriculture with an annual 
economic impact of $4,700,000,000; 
Whereas highbush and wild blueberries 
have a total harvested area estimated at 
more than 140,000 acres and are produced in 
48 States by nearly 13,185 farms; 
Whereas 
blueberry 
production 
in 
the 
United States has continually increased, 
with particular growth in the first 2 decades 
of the 21st century, to reach a harvest of 
760,000,000 pounds in 2021; 
Whereas blueberries are low in fat and a 
source of fiber, vitamins, and minerals; 
Whereas blueberries are being studied to 
examine the role the berries may play in pro-
moting good health in areas such as cardio-
vascular health, brain health, exercise, insu-
lin response, and gut health; and 
Whereas blueberries are harvested in the 
United States from March through early 
September, with the harvest reaching its 
peak in July: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates July 2022 as ‘‘National Blue-
berry Month’’; 
(2) recognizes the contributions of blue-
berry growers in the United States and their 
families; and 
(3) recognizes that purchasing blueberries 
grown in the United States supports farmers, 
jobs, communities, and the economy of the 
United States.

Whereas, in 1777, before the passage of the 
Bill of Rights, 10 sailors and Marines blew 
the whistle on fraud and misconduct that 
was harmful to the United States; 
Whereas the Founding Fathers unani-
mously supported the whistleblowers in 
words and deeds, including by releasing gov-
ernment records and providing monetary as-
sistance for the reasonable legal expenses 
necessary to prevent retaliation against the 
whistleblowers; 
Whereas, on July 30, 1778, in demonstration 
of their full support for whistleblowers, the 
members of the Continental Congress unani-
mously passed the first whistleblower legis-
lation in the United States that read: ‘‘Re-
solved, That it is the duty of all persons in 
the service of the United States, as well as 
all other the inhabitants thereof, to give the 
earliest information to Congress or other 
proper authority of any misconduct, frauds 
or misdemeanors committed by any officers

or persons in the service of these states, 
which may come to their knowledge’’ (legis-
lation of July 30, 1778, reprinted in Journals 
of the Continental Congress, 1774–1789, ed. 
Worthington C. Ford et al. (Washington, DC, 
1904–37), 11:732); 
Whereas whistleblowers risk their careers, 
jobs, and reputations by reporting waste, 
fraud, and abuse to the proper authorities; 
Whereas, in providing the proper authori-
ties with lawful disclosures, whistleblowers 
save the taxpayers of the United States bil-
lions of dollars each year and serve the pub-
lic interest by ensuring that the United 
States remains an ethical and safe place; and 
Whereas it is the public policy of the 
United States to encourage, in accordance 
with Federal law (including the Constitution 
of the United States, rules, and regulations) 
and consistent with the protection of classi-
fied information (including sources and 
methods of detection of classified informa-
tion), honest and good faith reporting of mis-
conduct, fraud, misdemeanors, and other 
crimes to the appropriate authority at the 
earliest time possible: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates July 30, 2022, as ‘‘National 
Whistleblower Appreciation Day’’; and 
(2) ensures that the Federal Government 
implements the intent of the Founding Fa-
thers, as reflected in the legislation passed 
on July 30, 1778 (relating to whistleblowers), 
by encouraging each executive agency to 
recognize National Whistleblower Apprecia-
tion Day by— 
(A) 
informing 
employees, 
contractors 
working on behalf of the taxpayers of the 
United States, and members of the public 
about the legal right of a United States cit-
izen to ‘‘blow the whistle’’ to the appropriate 
authority by honest and good faith reporting 
of misconduct, fraud, misdemeanors, or 
other crimes; and 
(B) acknowledging the contributions of 
whistleblowers to combating waste, fraud, 
abuse, and violations of laws and regulations 
of the United States.

TEXT OF AMENDMENTS 
SA 5183. Mr. DAINES submitted an 
amendment intended to be proposed by 
him to the bill H.R. 4346, making ap-
propriations for Legislative Branch for 
the fiscal year ending September 30, 
2022, and for other purposes; which was 
ordered to lie on the table; as follows: 
At the appropriate place, insert the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. lll. ENFORCEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL 
PROPERTY 
PROVISIONS 
OF 
ECO-
NOMIC AND TRADE AGREEMENT BE-
TWEEN THE GOVERNMENT OF THE 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND 
THE GOVERNMENT OF CHINA. 
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) the Agreement includes significant 
mandates for the People’s Republic of China 
related to its domestic intellectual property 
regime, including with respect to copyrights, 
trademarks, trade secrets, and patents; 
(2) the changes included in the Agreement, 
if implemented effectively, should improve 
the domestic intellectual property frame-
work of the People’s Republic of China, 
which has historically proven to harm the 
innovation and creative communities in the 
United States; 
(3) despite commitments made by the Gov-
ernment of the People’s Republic of China 
under the Agreement, ongoing market access 
barriers, uneven enforcement, measures re-
quiring forced technology transfer, and seri-
ous deficiencies in the rule of law continue 
to make the business environment in the 
People’s Republic of China highly chal-
lenging for rights holders in the United 
States; 
(4) as reflected in the 2021 report by the 
United States Trade Representative required 
under section 182(h) of the Trade Act of 1974 
(19 U.S.C. 2242(h)) (commonly referred to as 
the ‘‘Special 301 Report’’), the People’s Re-
public of China has consistently been listed 
in that annual report since 1989 as a trading 
partner of the United States that ‘‘fails to 
provide adequate and effective IP protection 
and enforcement for U.S. inventors, creators, 
brands, manufacturers, and service pro-
viders, which, in turn, harm American work-
ers’’; and 
(5) Congress encourages the United States 
Trade Representative, the Attorney General, 
the Secretary of State, the Secretary of 
Homeland Security, the Secretary of Com-
merce, and the Director of the United States 
Patent and Trademark Office— 
(A) to use all available tools to ensure that 
the People’s Republic of China fully imple-
ments its commitments under the Agree-
ment; and 
(B) to actively consider additional means 
to require the People’s Republic of China to 
address unfair market access barriers, forced 
technology 
transfer 
requirements, 
and 
broader intellectual property theft concerns, 
including through future trade agreements 
and working with partners in multilateral 
organizations, such as the Group of 7 (G7), 
the Group of 20 (G20), and the World Trade 
Organization. 
(b) 
ENFORCEMENT
OF
AGREEMENT.—The 
President, acting through the United States 
Trade Representative, shall coordinate with 
the heads of such Federal agencies as the 
President considers appropriate to enforce 
the actions related to intellectual property 
laid out in the Agreement including— 
(1) the civil, administrative, and criminal 
procedures and deterrent-level civil and 
criminal penalties provided in the Agree-
ment; and 
(2) by using the full enforcement authority 
of the President, including any enforcement 
authority in connection with the identifica-
tion and reporting process under section 182 
of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2242). 
(c) REPORT ON STATUS OF IMPLEMENTATION 
OF CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 180 days 
after the date of the enactment of this Act, 
and every 180 days thereafter, the United 
States Trade Representative shall submit to 
the appropriate committees of Congress a re-
port on the status of the implementation by 
the People’s Republic of China of its obliga-
tions under Chapter 1 of the Agreement. 
(2) INFORMATION
IN
REPORT.—Each report 
required by paragraph (1) shall contain infor-
mation sufficient to enable the appropriate 
committees of Congress to assess the extent 
of the compliance by the People’s Republic 
of China with the Agreement, including ap-
propriate quantitative metrics. 
(d) DEFINITIONS.—In this section: 
(1) AGREEMENT.—The term ‘‘Agreement’’ 
means the Economic and Trade Agreement 
Between the Government of the United 
States of America and the Government of 
China, dated January 15, 2020. 
(2) 
APPROPRIATE
COMMITTEES
OF
CON-
GRESS.—The term ‘‘appropriate committees 
of Congress’’ means the Committee on Fi-
nance of the Senate and the Committee on 
Ways and Means of the House of Representa-
tives. 
SA 5184. Mr. PAUL submitted an 
amendment intended to be proposed by 
him to the bill S. 3373, to improve the 
Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant 
and the Children of Fallen Heroes 
Grant; which was ordered to lie on the 
table; as follows: 
At the appropriate place, insert the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. ll. OFFSET THROUGH TEMPORARY RE-
DUCTION IN FOREIGN ASSISTANCE 
PROGRAMS. 
During the 10-year period beginning on Oc-
tober 1, 2022, no Federal funds may be ex-
pended by the United States Agency for

NOTICE 
OF 
PROPOSED 
RULE-
MAKING 
FOR 
THE 
CONGRES-
SIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY ACT 
U.S. CONGRESS,
OFFICE OF CONGRESSIONAL 
WORKPLACE RIGHTS, 
Washington, DC, July 26, 2022. 
Hon. PATRICK LEAHY, 
President Pro Tempore of the Senate, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: Section 210(e) of the 
Congressional Accountability Act (‘‘CAA’’), 2 
U.S.C. § 1331(e), requires the Board of Direc-
tors of the Office of Congressional Workplace 
Rights (‘‘the Board’’) to issue regulations 
implementing Section 210 of the CAA, relat-
ing to the rights and protections against dis-
crimination in the provision of public serv-
ices and accommodations established by sec-
tions 201 through 230, 302, 303, and 309 of the 
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 
U.S.C. § § 12131–12150, 12182, 12183, and 12189), 
made applicable to the legislative branch by 
the CAA. 2 U.S.C. § 1331(a). 
Section 304(b)(1) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. 
1384(b)(1), requires that the Board issue a 
general notice of proposed rulemaking by 
transmitting ‘‘such notice to the Speaker of 
the House of Representatives and the Presi-
dent Pro Tempore of the Senate for publica-
tion in the Congressional Record on the first 
day of which both Houses are in session fol-
lowing such transmittal.’’ 
On behalf of the Board, I am hereby trans-
mitting the attached notice of proposed rule-
making to the President Pro Tempore of the 
U.S. Senate. I request that this notice be 
published in the Senate section of the Con-
gressional Record on the first day on which 
both Houses are in session following receipt 
of this transmittal. In compliance with Sec-
tion 304(b)(2) of the CAA, a comment period 
of 30 days after the publication of this notice 
of proposed rulemaking is being provided be-
fore adoption of the rules. 
Any inquiries regarding this notice should 
be addressed to Teresa James, Acting Execu-
tive Director of the Office of Congressional 
Workplace Rights, 110 Second Street, SE, 
Room LA–200, Washington, DC 20540–1999; 
telephone: 202–724–9250. 
Sincerely, 
BARBARA CHILDS WALLACE, 
Chair of the Board of Directors, 
Office of Congressional Workplace Rights. 
Attachment. 
NOTICE 
OF 
PROPOSED 
RULEMAKING 
FROM THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF 
THE 
OFFICE 
OF 
CONGRESSIONAL 
WORKPLACE RIGHTS 
Modification of Regulations Under the Amer-
icans with Disabilities Act Relating to Pub-
lic Services and Accommodations, Notice of 
Proposed Rulemaking, as Required by 2 
U.S.C. § 1331, Congressional Accountability 
Act of 1995, as Amended. 
Background: 
The purpose of this Notice of Proposed 
Rulemaking (‘‘Notice’’) is to propose modi-
fications to the pending legislative branch 
Americans with Disabilities Act (‘‘ADA’’) 
substantive regulations under Section 210 of 
the 
Congressional 
Accountability 
Act 
(‘‘CAA’’) (2 U.S.C. § 1331 et seq.), which pro-
vides that the rights and protections against 
discrimination in the provision of public 
services and accommodation under Titles II 
and III of the ADA shall apply to entities 
covered by the CAA. 
The Congressional Accountability Act of 
1995 (‘‘CAA’’), PL 104–1, was enacted into law 
on January 23, 1995. The CAA, as amended, 
applies the rights and protections of 14 fed-
eral labor and employment statutes to cov-
ered employees and employing offices within 
the legislative branch of the federal govern-
ment. Section 210 of the CAA provides that 
the rights and protections against discrimi-
nation in the provision of public services and 
accommodations established by Titles II and 
III (sections 201 through 230, 302, 303, and 309) 
of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 
1990, 42 U.S.C. § § 12131–12150, 12182, 12183, and 
12189 (‘‘ADA’’), shall apply to legislative 
branch entities covered by the CAA. The 
above provisions of section 210 became effec-
tive on January 1, 1997. 2 U.S.C. § 1331(h). 
As set forth in detail below, the Board of 
Directors (‘‘the Board’’) of the Office of Con-
gressional 
Workplace 
Rights 
(‘‘OCWR’’) 
adopted regulations implementing section 
210 of the CAA in 2016. 162 Cong. Rec. H557– 
565, S624–632 (daily ed. February 3, 2016). 
These modified proposed regulations will 
bring OCWR’s ADA regulations in line with 
recent changes to the Department of Jus-
tice’s (‘‘DOJ’’) and Department of Transpor-
tation’s (‘‘DOT’’) ADA regulations and with 
the CAA of 1995 Reform Act of 2018, Pub. L. 
No. 
115–397. 
These 
and 
other 
proposed 
changes are set forth fully in this Notice. De-
letions are marked with square [brackets] 
and 
added 
text 
is 
within 
angled 
<<brackets>>. Therefore, if these regulations 
are approved as proposed, the deletions with-
in square brackets will be removed from the 
regulations and the added text within angled 
brackets will remain. 
What is the authority under the CAA for 
these proposed substantive regulations? 
Section 210(b) of the CAA provides that the 
rights and protections against discrimina-
tion in the provision of public services and 
accommodations established by the provi-
sions of Titles II and III (sections 201 
through 230, 302, 303, and 309) of the Ameri-
cans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. 
§ § 12131–12150, 12182, 12183, and 12189, shall 
apply to the following entities: (1) each of-
fice of the Senate, including each office of a 
Senator and each committee; (2) each office 
of the House of Representatives, including 
each office of a Member of the House of Rep-
resentatives and each committee; (3) each 
joint committee of the Congress; (4) the Of-
fice of Congressional Accessibility Services; 
(5) the Capitol Police; (6) the Congressional 
Budget Office; (7) the Office of the Architect 
of the Capitol (including the Botanic Gar-
den); (8) the Office of the Attending Physi-
cian; (9) the Office of Congressional Work-
place Rights; and (10) the Library of Con-
gress. 2 U.S.C. § 1331(a). 
Section 210(e) of the CAA requires that the 
OCWR Board, pursuant to section 304 of the 
CAA, issue regulations implementing that 
section, and that such regulations ‘‘shall be 
the same as substantive regulations promul-
gated by the Attorney General and the Sec-
retary of Transportation to implement the 
statutory provisions referred to in sub-
section (b) [of section 210 of the CAA] except 
to the extent that the Board may determine, 
for good cause shown and stated together 
with the regulation, that a modification of 
such regulations would be more effective for 
the implementation of the rights and protec-
tions under this section.’’ 2 U.S.C. § 1331(e). 
Are there ADA public access regulations al-
ready in force under the CAA? 
Yes. The first ADA regulations imple-
menting section 210 of the CAA were adopted 
by the Board and published on January 7, 
1997, 142 Cong. Rec. H10676–10711, S10984–11019 
(daily ed. September 19, 1996) and 143 Cong. 
Rec. S30–61 (daily ed. January 7, 1997), after 
providing notice, and receiving and consid-
ering comments in accordance with section 
304 of the CAA. No congressional action was 
taken and thus the 1997 regulations were not 
issued. Revised regulations were adopted by 
the Board and published on February 3, 2016, 
160 Cong. Rec. H7363–7372, S5437–S5447 (daily 
ed. September 9, 2014) and 162 Cong. Rec. 
H557–565, S624–632 (daily ed. February 3, 2016), 
after providing notice, and receiving and 
considering comments in accordance with 
section 304 of the CAA. No congressional ac-
tion was taken and thus the regulations were 
not issued. 
The CAA provides that, while the CAA 
rulemaking procedure is underway, the cor-
responding executive branch regulations are 
to be applied. Section 411 of the CAA (2 U.S.C 
§ 1411) provides: 
‘‘Effect of failure to issue regulations. 
In any proceeding under section 1405, 1406, 
1407, or 1408 of this title . . . if the Board has 
not issued a regulation on a matter for 
which this chapter requires a regulation to 
be issued, the hearing officer, Board, or 
court, as the case may be, shall apply, to the 
extent necessary and appropriate, the most 
relevant substantive executive agency regu-
lation promulgated to implement the statu-
tory provision at issue in the proceeding.’’ 
This makes plain that ADA public access 
regulations are presently in force. ‘‘[T]he 
most relevant substantive executive agency 
regulation[s]’’ are the DOJ and DOT ADA 
public access regulations. 
Why are these regulations being proposed at 
this time? 
As set forth above, the CAA requires em-
ploying offices to comply with ADA public 
access regulations issued by the DOJ and 
DOT pursuant to the ADA. The CAA also re-
quires the Board to issue its own regulations 
implementing the ADA public access provi-
sions of the CAA. The statute obligates the 
Board’s regulations to be the same as the 
DOJ and DOT regulations except to the ex-
tent that the Board may determine that a 
modification would be more effective in im-
plementing ADA public access protections. 2 
U.S.C. § 1331(e)(2). These proposed regulations 
will clarify that covered entities must com-
ply with the ADA public access provisions 
applied to public entities and public accom-
modations to implement Titles II and III of

the ADA. Congressional approval and Board 
issuance of ADA public access regulations 
under the CAA will also eliminate any ques-
tion as to the ADA public access protections 
that are applicable in the legislative branch. 
As set forth above, the Board adopted ADA 
regulations in 1997 and 2016, but no congres-
sional action was taken and therefore these 
regulations were not issued. The Board now 
proposes modifications to regulations adopt-
ed in 2016 to facilitate congressional consid-
eration of the ADA regulations. 
How do these regulations differ from those 
adopted by the Board on February 3, 
2016? 
This proposal consists of modifications to 
the regulations adopted by the Board in 2016. 
There are three significant types of changes: 
1. Updates to DOJ and DOT regulations: 
The proposed regulations set forth herein in-
corporate by reference the pertinent DOJ 
and DOT regulations that are in effect as of 
the date of the publication of this Notice, 
and, as such, have been updated to incor-
porate the changes made in the DOJ and 
DOT regulations since 2014. 
2. Modifications ‘‘for good cause’’: Section 
210(e) of the CAA requires that the regula-
tions issued by the OCWR Board to imple-
ment Titles II and III of the ADA as applied 
by the CAA be the same as those promul-
gated by DOJ and DOT to implement the 
ADA except where the Board determines, for 
good cause shown and stated together with 
the regulation, that a modification of such 
regulations would be more effective for the 
implementation of CAA rights and protec-
tions. 2 U.S.C. § 1331(e). 
3. Unlike the Board in 2016, the current 
Board has decided not to propose adoption of 
regulations relating to the two unique statu-
tory duties imposed by the CAA upon the 
General Counsel of the OCWR that are not 
imposed upon the DOJ and DOT: (1) the in-
vestigation and prosecution of charges of dis-
crimination using the Office’s mediation and 
hearing processes (section 210(d) of the CAA) 
and (2) the biennial ADA inspection and re-
porting obligations (section 210(f) of the 
CAA). The current Board has determined 
that rules relating to these duties are best 
implemented by adopting and publishing 
amendments to the OCWR’s Procedural 
Rules. 
Procedural Summary: 
How are substantive regulations proposed 
and approved under the CAA? 
Section 304 of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. § 1384, sets 
forth the following procedure for proposing 
and approving such substantive regulations: 
(1) the Board of Directors proposes sub-
stantive regulations and publishes a general 
notice of proposed rulemaking in the Con-
gressional Record; 
(2) there be a comment period of at least 30 
days after the date of publication of the gen-
eral notice of proposed rulemaking; 
(3) after consideration of comments by the 
Board of Directors, the Board adopt regula-
tions and transmit notice of such action (to-
gether with the regulations and a rec-
ommendation regarding the method for con-
gressional approval of the regulations) to the 
Speaker of the House and President [P]ro 
[T]empore of the Senate for publication in 
the Congressional Record; 
(4) there be committee referral and action 
on the proposed regulations by resolution in 
each House, concurrent resolution, or by 
joint resolution; and 
(5) final publication of the approved regu-
lations in the Congressional Record, with an 
effective date prescribed in the final publica-
tion. 
For more detail, please reference the text 
of 2 U.S.C. § 1384. 
What is the approach taken by these pro-
posed substantive regulations? 
The Board will follow the procedures as 
enumerated above and as required by stat-
ute. This Notice of Proposed Rulemaking is 
step (1) of the outline set forth above. The 
Board will review any comments received 
under step (2) of the outline above, and re-
spond to the comments and make any 
changes necessary to ensure that the regula-
tions fully implement section 210 of the CAA 
and reflect the practices and policies par-
ticular to the legislative branch. Because the 
Board’s 2016 revised regulations were adopted 
pursuant to the CAA’s procedures for pro-
posing and approving substantive regula-
tions, including providing a comment period 
of 30 days after publication of the proposed 
amendments in the Congressional Record, 
the Board is not soliciting additional com-
ments on those adopted amendments at this 
time. 
Are there substantive differences in the pro-
posed regulations for the House of Rep-
resentatives, the Senate, and the other 
employing offices? 
No. The Board of Directors has identified 
no good cause for proposing different regula-
tions for these entities and accordingly has 
not done so. Therefore, if these regulations 
are approved as proposed, there will be one 
text applicable to all employing offices and 
covered employees. 
Are these proposed regulations also rec-
ommended by the OCWR’s Executive Di-
rector, the Deputy Executive Director for 
the Senate, and the Deputy Executive Di-
rector for the House of Representatives? 
As required by Section 304(b)(1) of the 
CAA, 2 U.S.C. § 1384(b)(1), the substance of 
these regulations is also recommended by 
the Executive Director, the Deputy Execu-
tive Director for the Senate, and the Deputy 
Executive Director for the House of Rep-
resentatives. 
Are these proposed substantive regulations 
available to persons with disabilities in 
an alternate format? 
This Notice of Proposed Regulations is 
available 
on 
the 
OCWR’s 
website, 
www.ocwr.gov, which is compliant with Sec-
tion 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 as 
amended, 29 U.S.C. § 794d. This Notice can 
also be made available in large print, Braille, 
or other alternative format. Requests for 
this Notice in an alternative format should 
be made to the Office of Congressional Work-
place Rights, 202-724-9250 (voice); 202-426-1913 
(fax); or adaaccess@ocwr.gov (e-mail). 
How long do I have to submit comments re-
garding the proposed regulations? 
Comments regarding the proposed regula-
tions of the OCWR set forth in this Notice 
are invited for a period of thirty (30) days 
following the date of the appearance of this 
Notice in the Congressional Record. 
How do I submit comments? 
Comments must be made in writing to the 
Acting Executive Director, Office of Congres-
sional Workplace Rights, via e-mail at 
rule-comments@ocwr.gov. 
Am I allowed to view copies of comments 
submitted by others? 
Yes. Copies of submitted comments will be 
available for review on the Office’s website 
at www.ocwr.gov. 
Section-by-Section Discussion of Proposed 
Changes to the ADA Regulations 
The following is a section-by-section dis-
cussion of the proposed revisions to the 
Board’s substantive ADA regulations that it 
adopted and submitted for publication in the 
Congressional Record on February 3, 2016. 162 
Cong. Rec. H557–565, S624–632 (daily ed. Feb-
ruary 3, 2016). 
As noted above, because Congress has not 
acted on the Board’s request for approval of 
its 2016 amendments, the Board will resub-
mit them for congressional approval when it 
submits its request for approval of these 
amendments. 
Because 
the 
Board’s 
2016 
amendments were adopted pursuant to the 
CAA’s procedures for proposing and approv-
ing substantive regulations, the Board is not 
soliciting additional comments on those 
adopted amendments at this time. 
Regulations proposed in Part 1. 
Changes have been made to reflect the en-
actment of the CAA Reform Act and ADA 
Amendments Act. Section 1.101(a), Purpose 
and scope, includes an updated list of cov-
ered entities in accordance with the Reform 
Act, and the reference to 2 U.S.C. § 1361(e)(1) 
reflects a reorganization of subsections by 
the Reform Act. Section 1.101(b) now ref-
erences two parts to the regulations, instead 
of three, as set forth in more detail below. 
Section 1.102 contains updated references to 
the CAA Reform Act and ADA Amendments 
Act. 
Regulations proposed in Part 2. 
Unlike the Board in 2016, the current Board 
has decided not to propose adoption of regu-
lations relating to the two unique statutory 
duties imposed by the CAA upon the General 
Counsel of the OCWR that are not imposed 
upon the DOJ and DOT: (1) the investigation 
and prosecution of charges of discrimination 
using the Office’s mediation and hearing 
processes (section 210(d) of the CAA) and (2) 
the biennial inspection and reporting obliga-
tions (section 210(f) of the CAA). The current 
Board has determined that rules relating to 
these duties are best implemented by adopt-
ing and publishing amendments to the 
OCWR’s Procedural Rules. In the 2016 adopt-
ed regulations, such regulations are des-
ignated as Parts 2 and 3. Part 1 of the 2016 
regulations, ‘‘Matters of General Applica-
bility to All Regulations Promulgated Under 
Section 210 of the Congressional Account-
ability Act of 1995,’’ includes a list of regula-
tions incorporated by reference (designated 
§ 1.105). The Board now proposes to move the 
list of regulations incorporated by reference 
to their own part, where the former § 1.105 
subsections have been re-numbered as sec-
tions within the new Part 2. 
In § 2.103, the Board has listed the specific 
DOJ regulations incorporated by reference 
into the regulations being issued under sec-
tion 210 of the CAA. 
These proposed regulations reflect the per-
tinent DOJ regulations that are in effect as 
of the date of the publication of this Notice. 
As such, they incorporate changes in the 
DOJ regulations that have been made since 
the Board last proposed regulations in 2014. 
These changes are as follows: 
1. On August 11, 2016, the DOJ published 
regulations incorporating the requirements 
of the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 (‘‘ADA 
Amendments Act’’) into the ADA Title II 
and Title III regulations, which took effect 
on October 11, 2016. Amendment of Ameri-
cans with Disabilities Act Title II and Title 
III Regulations to Implement ADA Amend-
ments Act of 2008, 81 FR 53204 01 (August 11, 
2016). Congress enacted the ADA Amend-
ments Act to clarify the meaning and inter-
pretation of the ADA definition of disability 
to ensure that the definition of disability 
would be broadly construed and applied with-
out extensive analysis. Changes made by this 
final rule that the Board has incorporated 
include: amendment of § 35.101, relating to 
the ADA’s purpose and broad coverage; 
§ 35.108, relating to the definition of dis-
ability; appendices that provide explanation 
and guidance pertaining to the final rule. 
2. A November 21, 2016 final rule revised 
the DOJ’s Title III regulation to further

clarify a public accommodation’s obligation 
to provide appropriate auxiliary aids and 
services for people with disabilities. Non-
discrimination on the Basis of Disability by 
Public Accommodations—Movie Theaters; 
Movie Captioning and Audio Description, 81 
FR 87348–01 (December 2, 2016). Effective on 
January 17, 2017, the final rule codified long-
standing DOJ policies in this area, and in-
cludes provisions based on technological ad-
vances and breakthroughs in the area of aux-
iliary aids and services that have occurred 
since the 1991 Title III regulation was pub-
lished. As set forth below, the Board pro-
poses to adopt § 36.303, relating to auxiliary 
aids and services, which was revised by this 
final rule. 
The Board has adopted all of the DOJ regu-
lations implementing Titles II and III of the 
ADA with the exceptions detailed in the 2016 
Notice (162 Cong. Rec. H557–565, S624–632 
(daily ed. February 3, 2016)), plus the fol-
lowing revisions: 
1. Since the DOJ’s regulations imple-
menting Titles II and III of the ADA regulate 
public entities and public accommodations, 
respectively, several regulations are very 
similar across the titles, applying a similar 
or identical requirement to either a Title II- 
or a Title III-covered entity. Under the 
OCWR’s proposed § 1.102(c), ‘‘Covered entity 
and public entity include any of the entities 
listed in § 1.101(a) that provides public serv-
ices, programs, or activities, or operates a 
place of public accommodation within the 
meaning of Section 210 of the CAA. In the 
regulations implementing Title III, private 
entity includes covered entities.’’ Therefore, 
it is not necessary for the OCWR Board to 
adopt both a Title II and a Title III regula-
tion that are identical (or similar to the 
point of being duplicative) except for the en-
tity they would apply to in a non-CAA con-
text. The Board will exclude the following 
sections from its substantive regulations on 
that basis: 35.103 (relating to the regulations’ 
relation to laws other than the ADA), 36.105 
(relating to the definition of disability), 
36.208 (relating to direct threat), 36.302(c) (re-
lating to service animals), and 36.302(f) (re-
lating to ticketing). 
2. The Board finds good cause to modify 
§ 35.107(a) to list the House and Senate sepa-
rately from other public entities and to re-
flect a slightly different requirement for 
them. In creating § 35.107, the DOJ wanted to 
ensure that individuals dealing with large 
agencies would be able to easily find a re-
sponsible person who is familiar with the 
ADA’s requirements and can communicate 
those requirements to other individuals in 
the agency who may be unaware of their re-
sponsibilities (often referred to as an ‘‘ADA 
coordinator’’). 
Nondiscrimination 
on 
the 
Basis of Disability in State and Local Gov-
ernment Services, 56 Fed. Reg. 35694–01 (July 
26, 1991). 
For purposes of section 210 of the CAA, the 
House and Senate are composed of a large 
number of separate entities (including each 
office of a Member and each committee). 2 
U.S.C. § 1331(a). The Board’s modification of 
§ 35.107 allows the House and the Senate to 
each designate one employee to coordinate 
ADA compliance responsibilities, helping to 
ensure that individuals can easily find and 
get assistance to effectuate their rights 
under the ADA as applied by the CAA with 
regard to the House and Senate. The House 
and Senate ADA coordinators may, under 
the regulation as modified, be employees of 
the Office of Congressional Accessibility 
Services, which already works to provide 
services for individuals with disabilities. 
The Board finds good cause not to incor-
porate the requirement at § 35.107(b) for enti-
ties to adopt their own grievance procedures, 
since the CAA specifies the available proce-
dures for violations of the ADA as applied by 
the CAA at 2 U.S.C. § 1331(d). Section 35.107 
will thus read, in its entirety, as detailed 
below. 
3. The Board proposes to adopt § 36.206, re-
lating to retaliation or coercion. While sec-
tion 207 (2 U.S.C. § 1317) of the CAA provides 
comprehensive retaliation protection for em-
ployees (including applicants and former em-
ployees) who may invoke their rights under 
section 210, section 207 does not apply to non-
employees who may enjoy rights and protec-
tions against discrimination under section 
210. Additionally, § 36.206 contains a list of il-
lustrations of prohibited conduct, which may 
be helpful to the Board. 
4. The Board finds good cause to modify 
§ 36.213, ‘‘Relationship of subpart B to sub-
parts C and D of this part.’’ This section ref-
erences subparts without specifying which 
regulations comprise those subparts—infor-
mation which is not conveyed in all formats. 
For example, the DOJ’s ADA website breaks 
the list of regulations into subparts, but a 
reader of the list of regulations incorporated 
by reference below does not see that same in-
formation. Therefore, the Board finds good 
cause to modify this provision by inserting 
references to the provisions contained within 
each subpart. Section 36.213 will thus read as 
detailed below. 
5. The Board proposes to adopt § 36.303, re-
lating to auxiliary aids and services. Revised 
in a 2016 final rule, it now includes provi-
sions based on technological advances and 
breakthroughs in the area of auxiliary aids 
and services that have occurred since the 
1991 Title III regulation was published. Non-
discrimination on the Basis of Disability by 
Public Accommodations—Movie Theaters; 
Movie Captioning and Audio Description, 81 
Fed. Reg. 87348 (December 2, 2016). These re-
visions were not made to the analogous Title 
II Regulation, § 35.160 General (Communica-
tions), so the Board has decided it is appro-
priate to propose adoption of both regula-
tions, even though they concern similar sub-
ject matter. 
In section 2.104, the Board has listed the 
specific DOT regulations incorporated into 
the regulations being issued under section 
210 of the CAA. 
These regulations reflect the pertinent 
DOJ regulations that are in effect as of the 
date of the publication of this Notice. As 
such, they incorporate changes in the DOT 
regulations that have been made since the 
Board last proposed regulations in 2014. Spe-
cifically, a DOT final rule effective July 13, 
2015 clarified that public transportation enti-
ties are required to make reasonable modi-
fications to their policies, practices, and pro-
cedures to avoid discrimination and ensure 
that their programs are accessible to indi-
viduals with disabilities. Transportation for 
Individuals with Disabilities; Reasonable 
Modification of Policies and Practices, 80 FR 
13253–01 (March 13, 2015). Changes made by 
this final rule that the Board has incor-
porated include: amendment to § 37.5, relat-
ing to nondiscrimination; § 37.169, relating to 
the process to be used by public entities pro-
viding designated public transportation serv-
ice in considering requests for reasonable 
modification; Appendix E to Part 37, which 
explains DOT’s interpretation of sections 
37.5(i) and 37.169 concerning reasonable modi-
fication requests. 
As noted earlier, the Board has adopted all 
of the DOT regulations implementing Titles 
II and III of the ADA with the exceptions de-
tailed in the 2016 Notice (162 Cong. Rec. H557– 
565, S624–632 (daily ed. February 3, 2016)), plus 
the following revision. Unlike the Board in 
2016, the current Board has decided not to 
propose adoption of subpart F (sections 37.121 
through 37.159) of the DOT’s regulations, re-
lating to paratransit as a complement to 
fixed route service. The current Board has 
determined that these regulations are unnec-
essary 
for 
CAA-covered 
transportation. 
Under the ADA, public entities operating 
fixed route transportation systems must pro-
vide comparable transportation services to 
people whose disabilities prevent their use of 
the fixed route system. Such ‘‘ADA com-
plementary paratransit’’ is subject to many 
requirements 
detailed 
in 
DOT’s 
imple-
menting regulations. DOT reasons, in Appen-
dix D to Part 37, that some types of fixed 
route systems are exempt from the require-
ment to provide ADA complementary para-
transit because of characteristics of these 
systems such as no attempt to comprehen-
sively cover a service area, limited route 
structure, limited origins and destinations, 
interface with another mode of transpor-
tation, and limited purposes of travel. Trans-
portation services subject to the CAA share 
many of these characteristics, and in any 
event must still comply with requirements 
governing accessible vehicles and accessible 
service, so the Board has determined that it 
is not necessary to adopt the ADA com-
plementary paratransit regulations.

(a) CAA. Enacted into law on January 23, 
1995 and amended on December 21, 2018, the 
Congressional Accountability Act (‘‘CAA’’) 
in Section 210(b) provides that the rights and 
protections against discrimination in the 
provision of public services and accommoda-
tions established by sections 201 through 230, 
302, 303, and 309 of the Americans with Dis-
abilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. § § 12131–12150, 
12182, 12183, and 12189 (‘‘ADA’’), shall apply to 
the following entities: 
(1) each office of the Senate, including 
each office of a Senator and each committee; 
(2) each office of the House of Representa-
tives, including each office of a Member of 
the House of Representatives and each com-
mittee; 
(3) each joint committee of the Congress; 
(4) the Office of Congressional Accessi-
bility Services; 
(5) the United States Capitol Police; 
(6) the Congressional Budget Office; 
(7) the Office of the Architect of the Cap-
itol (including the Botanic Garden); 
(8) the Office of the Attending Physician; 
(9) the Office of Congressional Workplace 
Rights; and 
(10) the Library of Congress. 
Title II of the ADA prohibits discrimina-
tion on the basis of disability in the provi-
sion of public services, programs, activities 
by any ‘‘public entity.’’ Section 210(b)(2) of 
the CAA provides that for the purpose of ap-
plying Title II of the ADA the term ‘‘public 
entity’’ means any entity listed above that 
provides public services, programs, or activi-
ties. Title III of the ADA prohibits discrimi-
nation on the basis of disability by public ac-
commodations and requires places of public 
accommodation and commercial facilities to 
be designed, constructed, and altered in com-
pliance with accessibility standards. Section 
225(e) of the CAA provides that, ‘‘[e]xcept 
where inconsistent with definitions and ex-
emptions provided in [this Act], the defini-
tions and exemptions of the [ADA] shall 
apply under [this Act.]’’ 2 U.S.C. § 1361(e)(1).

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3703 
July 26, 2022 
(b) Purpose and scope of regulations. The 
regulations set forth herein (Parts 1 and 2) 
are the substantive regulations that the 
Board of Directors of the Office of Congres-
sional Workplace Rights has promulgated 
pursuant to section 210(e) of the CAA. Part 1 
contains the general provisions applicable to 
all regulations under section 210 and the 
method of identifying entities responsible 
for correcting a violation of section 210. Part 
2 contains the list of executive branch regu-
lations incorporated by reference which de-
fine and clarify the prohibition against dis-
crimination on the basis of disability in the 
provision of public services and accommoda-
tions. 
§ 1.102 Definitions. 
Except as otherwise specifically provided 
in these regulations, as used in these regula-
tions: 
(a) Act or CAA means the Congressional 
Accountability Act of 1995, Pub. L. No. 104–1, 
amended by Congressional Accountability 
Act of 1995 Reform Act, Pub. L. No. 115–397. 
(b) ADA or Americans with Disabilities Act 
means those sections of the Americans with 
Disabilities Act of 1990 as amended by the 
ADA Amendments Act of 2008 incorporated 
by reference into the CAA in section 210: 42 
U.S.C. § § 12131–12150, 12182, 12183, and 12189. 
(c) Covered entity and public entity include 
any of the entities listed in § 1.101(a) that 
provides public services, programs, or activi-
ties, or operates a place of public accommo-
dation within the meaning of section 210 of 
the CAA. In the regulations implementing 
Title III, private entity includes covered en-
tities. 
(d) Board means the Board of Directors of 
the 
Office 
of 
Congressional 
Workplace 
Rights. 
(e) Office means the Office of Congressional 
Workplace Rights. 
(f) General Counsel means the General 
Counsel of the Office of Congressional Work-
place Rights. 
§ 1.103 Authority of the Board. 
Pursuant to sections 210 and 304 of the 
CAA, the Board is authorized to issue regula-
tions to implement the rights and protec-
tions against discrimination on the basis of 
disability in the provision of public services 
and accommodations under the ADA. Sec-
tion 210(e) of the CAA directs the Board to 
promulgate regulations implementing sec-
tion 210 that are ‘‘the same as substantive 
regulations promulgated by the Attorney 
General and the Secretary of Transportation 
to implement the statutory provisions re-
ferred to in subsection (b) except to the ex-
tent that the Board may determine, for good 
cause shown and stated together with the 
regulation, that a modification of such regu-
lations would be more effective for the im-
plementation of the rights and protections 
under this section.’’ 2 U.S.C. § 1331(e). Specifi-
cally, it is the Board’s considered judgment, 
based on the information available to it at 
the time of promulgation of these regula-
tions, that, with the exception of the regula-
tions adopted and set forth herein, there are 
no other ‘‘substantive regulations promul-
gated by the Attorney General and the Sec-
retary of Transportation to implement the 
statutory provisions referred to in sub-
section (b) [of Section 210 of the CAA]’’ that 
need be adopted. 
In promulgating these regulations, the 
Board has made certain technical and no-
menclature changes to the regulations as 
promulgated by the Attorney General and 
the 
Secretary 
of 
Transportation. 
Such 
changes are intended to make the provisions 
adopted accord more naturally to situations 
in the legislative branch. However, by mak-
ing these changes, the Board does not intend 
a substantive difference between these regu-
lations and those of the Attorney General 
and/or the Secretary of Transportation from 
which they are derived. Moreover, such 
changes, in and of themselves, are not in-
tended to constitute an interpretation of the 
regulations or of the statutory provisions of 
the CAA upon which they are based. 
§ 1.104 Method for identifying the entity re-
sponsible for correction of violations of 
section 210. 
(a) Purpose and scope. Section 210(e)(3) of 
the CAA provides that regulations under sec-
tion 210(e) include a method of identifying, 
for purposes of section 210 of the CAA and for 
categories of violations of section 210(b), the 
entity responsible for correcting a particular 
violation. This section sets forth the method 
for identifying responsible entities for the 
purpose of allocating responsibility for cor-
recting violations of section 210(b). 
(b) Violations. A covered entity may violate 
section 210(b) if it discriminates against a 
qualified individual with a disability within 
the meaning of Title II or Title III of the 
ADA. 
(c) Entities Responsible for Correcting Viola-
tions. Correction of a violation of the rights 
and protections against discrimination is the 
responsibility of the entities listed in sub-
section (a) of section 210 of the CAA that 
provide the specific public service, program, 
activity, or accommodation that forms the 
basis for the particular violation of Title II 
or Title III rights and protections and, when 
the violation involves a physical access bar-
rier, the entities responsible for designing, 
maintaining, managing, altering, or con-
structing the facility in which the specific 
public service program, activity, or accom-
modation is conducted or provided. 
(d) Allocation of Responsibility for Correction 
of Title II and/or Title III Violations. Where 
more than one covered entity is found to be 
an entity responsible for correction of a vio-
lation of Title II and/or Title III rights and 
protections under the method set forth in 
this section, as between those parties, allo-
cation of responsibility for correcting the 
violations of the ADA may be determined by 
statute, contract, or other enforceable ar-
rangement or relationship.

COMMENDING 
CHIEF 
GARY 
PONTHIEUX, JR. UPON HIS RE-
TIREMENT 
HON. STEVEN M. PALAZZO 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 26, 2022 
Mr. PALAZZO. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the distinguished service of Chief 
Gary Ponthieux, who will retire this year after 
28 years of service to South Mississippi. 
Chief Ponthieux, from Bay St. Louis, MS, 
currently resides in Pass Christian, MS, where 
he lives with his wife, the former Kacey 
Edwards of Bay St. Louis and their children, 
Luci (12) and Max (9). Chief Ponthieux ob-
tained his bachelor’s degree in Criminal Jus-
tice with a double minor in Forensic Science 
and Psychology from the University of South-
ern Mississippi. In 1994, Chief Ponthieux at-
tended the Hattiesburg Police Department Law 
Enforcement Academy and received the high-
est academic award. 
Chief Ponthieux began his public service ca-
reer in 1994 with the Gulfport Police Depart-
ment as a police officer. Within a short period, 
he worked his way up to Narcotics Detective 
and served from April 1995 to January 2003. 
In January 2003, he was promoted to Criminal 
Investigations Detective Sergeant. He contin-
ued to serve the Gulfport community in this 
role until November 2017. Following his time 
as Criminal Investigations Detective Sergeant, 
he left the Gulfport Police Department to serve 
as Chief of Police of Bay St. Louis. Con-
cluding his time in Gulfport, he spent a little 
over 23 years serving the Gulfport community 
and nearly five years serving the Bay St. Louis 
community. Chief Ponthieux has spent 28 
years serving the people of South Mississippi. 
For his service, Chief Ponthieux has been 
awarded numerous prestigious awards, such 
as the top academic award as a graduate of 
the Hattiesburg Police Academy, being named 
outstanding officer by the Gulfport Rotary 
Club, Gulfport Chamber of Commerce, and 
many more. Upon his retirement, Gary took a 
position with the High Intensity Drug Traf-
ficking Area, HIDTA, a DEA task force that tar-
gets high-intensity drug trafficking and money 
laundering organizations. 
Chief Ponthieux has continuously gone 
above and beyond to answer the call of public 
service. I am grateful for his service and dedi-
cation to South Mississippi. Most importantly, 
he embodies the virtues of integrity, hard 
work, and selflessness that South Mississip-
pians expect from their government officials. 
Chief Ponthieux leaves the City of Bay St. 
Louis better than he found it. On behalf of the 
Fourth Congressional District of Mississippi, I 
congratulate Chief Ponthieux on his retire-
ment, and may God watch over him and his 
family as he continues to serve and protect. 
TRIBUTE 
TO 
VAN 
DO-REYNOSO, 
PUBLIC 
HEALTH 
DIRECTOR, 
COUNTY OF SANTA BARBARA 
HON. SALUD O. CARBAJAL 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 26, 2022 
Mr. CARBAJAL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of Van Do-Reynoso, Pub-
lic Health Director, County of Santa Barbara 
for her impeccable 5 years of service. Van 
served as Public Health Director since 2017, 
leading the Department through countless 
events and disasters, such as the Thomas 
Fire, the January 9, 2018, Montecito Debris 
Flow, and the COVID–19 pandemic. During 
each one of these events, Van always en-
sured that protecting the public health of the 
community was first and foremost. 
On January 21, 2020, when the first case of 
COVID–19 was reported in the United States, 
the spotlight was thrust towards Van and her 
dedicated team, and as always, Van did not 
let us down. Van’s enduring passion to serve 
the residents and ensure equity for all in 
Santa Barbara County, led the Board of Su-
pervisors to declare racism a public health 
emergency and found the Office of Health and 
Equity. 
Van is especially known for her ability to de-
velop and mobilize partnerships to further the 
Public Health’s mission, building deep collabo-
rative relationships with community members 
and organizations across the County. Impor-
tantly, Van has worked tirelessly to have 
health care centers provide access to services 
beyond primary care, including telehealth, be-
havioral health, and pharmacy services. Van is 
also a strong advocate for Animal Services 
and ensuring the safety of animals in our com-
munity. 
As Van understands the calming effects and 
health benefits animals provide, Van intro-
duced a Pet Policy for Public Health to allow 
pets in the workplace. Van’s tireless energy, 
enthusiasm, empathy, and efforts to improve 
the lives and health status of all Santa Bar-
bara County residents will always have the re-
spect of her colleagues. 
Madam Speaker, Van Do-Reynoso leaves 
the Public Health Department, County of 
Santa Barbara in a strong place, well prepared 
to continue its mission to improve the health of 
our communities by preventing disease, pro-
moting wellness and health equity, while en-
suring access to needed health care, and 
maintaining a safe a healthy environment. I re-
spectfully ask that you join me in expressing 
immense gratitude to Van Do-Reynoso for her 
5 years of distinguished and dedicated public 
service. 
HONORING COLTON HARRIS 
HON. SAM GRAVES 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 26, 2022 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam Speaker, 
I proudly pause to recognize Colton Harris. 
Colton is a very special young man who has 
exemplified the finest qualities of citizenship 
and leadership by taking an active part in the 
Boy Scouts of America, Troop 1376, and earn-
ing the most prestigious award of Eagle Scout. 
Colton has been very active with his troop, 
participating in many scout activities. Over the 
many years Colton has been involved with 
scouting, he has not only earned 33 merit 
badges, but also the respect of his family, 
peers, and community. Colton has achieved 
much as a scout, having achieved the ranks of 
Patrol Leader, Assistant Senior Patrol Leader, 
Troop Guide, Quartermaster, and Librarian. 
Colton has also contributed to his community 
through his Eagle Scout project. Colton’s 
project entailed 200 hours of extensive land-
scaping to enhance the area in which he 
worked. 
Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join 
me in commending Colton Harris for his ac-
complishments with the Boy Scouts of Amer-
ica, and for his efforts put forth in achieving 
the highest distinction of Eagle Scout.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF BERNARD J. MAHONEY 
HON. JOHN KATKO 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 26, 2022 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor and celebrate the life of Bernard J. 
Mahoney, a dedicated and longtime public 
servant, a gifted attorney and businessman, 
and a devoted and loving husband and father 
who passed away on July 19, 2022. 
Bernie was a beloved member of the Cen-
tral New York community and served in the 
Syracuse Common Council and in the New 
York State Assembly. He attended Saint An-
thony’s School, Christian Brothers Academy, 
and graduated from Le Moyne College. He at-
tended Syracuse University College of Law 
and practiced law at the Mackenzie Law Firm. 
He also was employed by IBM and used that 
experience to start Niagara Computer Sales, 
Inc. Bernie also served his country in the U.S. 
Army at Ladd Army Airfield in Fairbanks, Alas-
ka. 
Bernie won his bid to serve in the Syracuse 
Common Council as Councilor-at-large in 
1977 and served ten years in that seat. He re-
turned to the Council in 1990 as a Represent-
ative for the 3rd District. Bernie won a seat in 
the New York State Assembly in 1994 and 
served two terms. His daughter, Joanie 
Mahoney, followed in his footsteps and served

on the Syracuse Common Council and as 
County Executive for Onondaga County. 
Bernie Mahoney was a fixture in Central 
New York politics, a friend to all who knew 
him, and a public servant in the truest sense. 
He instilled these values in his daughter, as 
they both cared deeply for the community they 
served and were both trusted confidants and 
dear friends of my family. 
Outside of his work, Bernie was a devoted 
father, grandfather, and active member of 
Most Holy Rosary Church. In celebration of his 
proud Irish heritage, Bernie and his daughter, 
Joanie served as co-Grand Marshalls of the 
2019 Syracuse Saint Patrick’s Day Parade. He 
is survived by his wife of 63 years, Joanne, 
their 9 children, and 17 grandchildren. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues 
in the House join me in remembering Bernard 
J. Mahoney, honoring his many years of self-
less public service, and to keep him and his 
family in mind as we remember his many con-
tributions to the Central New York community.

TRIBUTE TO THE KIWANIS CLUB 
OF GLENDALE 
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 26, 2022 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the Kiwanis Club of Glendale, 
California upon its 100th anniversary. 
The club was chartered on April 28, 1922, 
and at the charter night celebration on July 22, 
of that same year, 61 charter members were 
present. Sponsored by the Kiwanis Club of 
Pasadena, California, the Kiwanis Club of 
Glendale in turn, sponsored other clubs in 
1922 including in Burbank, Santa Barbara, 
North Hollywood and Alhambra and several 
other clubs over the years. 
Dedicated to selfless service to the commu-
nity’s youth with the goal of creating respon-
sible citizens of tomorrow and following 
Kiwanis International’s mission of ‘‘improving 
the world one child and one community at a 
time,’’ the club has supported a plethora of 
community 
programs, 
youth 
groups 
and 
projects over the last century. 
In 1932, the renowned Glendale Kiwanis 
Chorus was formed. The chorus, which was 
active for decades, gave generously of their 
talent and time, performing at retirement 
homes, schools, other service clubs and inter-
national Kiwanis conventions, and participated 
in television and radio broadcasts. In 1940, 
the Boy Builders project, which operated for 
over 20 years, provided club and after-school 
athletic activities for at-risk boys, and was cre-
ated in partnership with the Glendale YMCA. 
Other notable projects included providing fa-
cilities and camp buildings for Girl Scouts, 
Camp Fire Girls, and Boy Scouts, and in 
1944, a Vocational Guidance and Veterans’ 
Welfare Center was established which served 
over 9,500 veterans in 1945 and became a 
model for similar centers in other communities. 
In the 1950’s, the club formed Key Clubs at 
Hoover High School and Glendale High 
School, sponsored foreign exchange students, 
organized a Circle K Club at Glendale Com-
munity College, and held an annual basketball 
tournament for community college teams that 
changed in 1971 to an annual tournament for 
high school teams, and which provided in-
come for the club’s youth activities. 
Current programs include the distribution of 
scholarships to local students, the Kiwanis 
Read Aloud project which supports the Glen-
dale Public Library, the Reading is Funda-
mental program where books are distributed to 
local elementary schools, and The Blanket 
Project where members make blankets and 
distribute them to local charities such as the 
Salvation Army and the YWCA. In addition, 
the club partners with numerous local food 
pantries to feed local children and families, in-
cluding the Glendale Community College Food 
for Thought Pantry for college students experi-
encing food insecurity. 
To support their many worthwhile programs, 
the Kiwanis Club of Glendale’s creative en-
deavors include the Kiwanis Incredible Duck 
Splash (KIDS), an annual holiday gala and ice 
socials. 
I ask all Members to join me in congratu-
lating the Kiwanis Club of Glendale and thank-
ing its members for a century of outstanding 
service to the Glendale community, particularly 
to our children.

HONORING MRS. BOBBYE MAGGIO 
HON. STEVEN M. PALAZZO 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 26, 2022 
Mr. PALAZZO. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the outstanding work and dedication 
of Mrs. Bobbye Maggio. Bobbye Maggio was 
born and raised in Batesville, Mississippi. She 
graduated from Saint Joseph Catholic School 
in Madison, Mississippi, and then attended the 
Providence School of Nursing in Mobile, Ala-
bama. 
In her senior year of nursing school, she 
met the late Dr. Henry A. Maggio, whom she 
married upon her graduation. They were mar-
ried for 58 years, and together they raised 
their four children—Shannon, Melissa, Ste-
phen, and Michael—in Bay St. Louis, Mis-
sissippi. Today, Bobbye is the proud grand-
mother to 16 grandchildren and the great- 
grandmother to 4 great-grandchildren. 
Bobbye was instrumental in founding Our 
Lady Academy Catholic School in 1971, the 
only all-girls private school in the state of Mis-
sissippi. She deeply believed in the impor-
tance of Catholic education for girls so that 
they may learn Catholic Christian morals and 
values and achieve their full academic and 
personal potential. 
Bobbye has a long history of public and 
community service to the Mississippi Gulf 
Coast. She was a founder of the Junior Auxil-
iary of Hancock County and is involved in 
local Bible studies, church groups, and youth 
retreats. Additionally, Bobbye is a member of 
the all-women Krewe of Nereids, which has 
grown into one of the largest Carnival organi-
zations on the Mississippi Gulf Coast today. 
Bobbye is a longtime Republican activist. 
She has campaigned for local Republican gov-
ernment officials and participated in local elec-
tions. 
Today, we recognize Mrs. Bobbye Maggio 
for her outstanding service to the Republican 
Party, Hancock County, and the State of Mis-
sissippi.

HONORING VIRGINIA BELL 
HON. ANDY BARR 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 26, 2022 
Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I rise to honor 
an incredible woman, Virginia Bell. Mrs. Bell 
lives in Lexington, Kentucky and turned 100 
years old on June 30, 2022. 
Mrs. Bell was born and raised on a farm 
outside of Cynthiana, KY. She attended Tran-
sylvania University, graduating in 1944 with 
degrees in mathematics and biology. After 
raising five children with her husband Wayne, 
she went back to school and earned a mas-
ter’s degree in social work in 1982 at the age 
of 60. She became the first family counselor at 
the University of Kentucky’s Sanders Brown 
Center on Aging. Mrs. Bell developed the rev-
olutionary Best Friends Approach for the care 
of people with Alzheimer’s and other demen-
tias. She created the Best Friends Adult Day 
Program, one of the first dementia specific 
adult day care centers in the country. Her 
ideas have been replicated world-wide. 
Mrs. Bell is internationally known in the field 
of dementia care, having lectured in over 30 
countries. 
She has co-authored 5 books and been 
widely published in professional journals. She 
was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Hu-
mane Letters from Transylvania University in 
1992. The National Council on Aging pre-
sented her with the prestigious Ruth Von 
Behren Award in 1994. She was the first in-
ductee in the University of Kentucky College

CONGRATULATING DR. ROBERT J. 
DILGER 
HON. NYDIA M. VELA´ZQUEZ 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 26, 2022 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
congratulate Congressional Research Service 
Senior Specialist, Dr. Robert Jay Dilger on his 
retirement, and to thank him for his years of 
outstanding and dedicated service to Con-
gress. For more than a dozen years, Dr. 
Dilger has been CRS’s expert on small busi-
ness. During that time, he has provided the 
House Small Business Committee and its 
staff—and numerous other congressional of-
fices—with an unparalleled level of information 
and independent research on federal policies 
that affect small businesses. His work at CRS 
is the gold standard for legislative support and 
policy analysis for Congress. 
Prior to CRS, Dr. Dilger had a distinguished 
career in academia. He became a recognized 
national authority on federalism, authoring 
nine books and numerous articles. Bob grad-
uated from Johns Hopkins University with a 
bachelor’s degree in political science and 
holds a Ph.D. from the Department of Politics 
at Brandeis University. Early in his career, he 
held positions with the National League of Cit-
ies, the U.S. Advisory Commission on Inter-
governmental Relations, and the Brookings In-
stitution before joining the faculty at the Uni-
versity of Redlands in California. There he 
served as professor and chair of the Depart-
ment of Political Science. 
He then moved to West Virginia University 
where he was the founding Director of the In-
stitute for Public Affairs. In addition, Bob 
taught undergraduate and graduate courses 
and chaired graduate student M.A. and Ph.D. 
committees. 
Bob arrived at CRS in 2004 to manage the 
Government & Finance division. Since 2008, 
he has devoted himself to research and anal-
ysis, generating an impressive portfolio of 
carefully curated and maintained written prod-
ucts, and providing support to congressional 
offices on the Small Business Administration’s 
programs and a broad range of issues and 
policies affecting small businesses. 
Through the caliber of his research, and the 
sheer volume of his consultations with con-
gressional staff, Bob set a high bar for his 
CRS colleagues. He should be proud of his 
assistance on major legislation such as the 
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, the 
Small Business Jobs Act, and, more recently, 
the CARES Act and related COVID bills, but 
also the long-term professional and personal 
relationships he has built with staff on the 
Small Business Committees and in other con-
gressional offices. 
Madam Speaker, this body and the Nation 
are all the wiser and better informed because 
of Dr. Dilger’s public service both as an aca-
demic and as a CRS analyst. I hope my col-
leagues will join me in wishing Bob a long, 
healthy, and happy retirement with his wife, 
Gloria, and his 2 children and 7 grandchildren, 
as he begins a new chapter of his life.

HON. SALUD O. CARBAJAL 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 26, 2022 
Mr. CARBAJAL. Madam Speaker, each 
year, through the Women of the Year Award, 
my office extends’ special recognition to 
women on the Central Coast who have made 
a difference in our community. I would like to 
recognize one outstanding Women of the Year

Linda is a retired Santa Barbara Research 
Center and Raytheon Business Manager who 
loves to mentor young children and college

leaders. Linda’s commitment to service dates 
back to her membership in the first Black so-
rority—Alpha Kappa Alpha—since her under-
graduate college days at CSU, Los Angeles, 
and subsequent graduate studies at USC. The 
sorority focuses on service to the community, 
a mission Linda has embraced and helped in-
still in her sisters. She has held positions of 
President, Vice President, and many com-
mittee chairmanship roles throughout her 
years of service and still serves as the Grad-
uate Advisor of undergraduate members of the 
sorority at University of California at Santa 
Barbara. 
Organizations that provide educational sup-
port and scholarship assistance to students— 
especially the underserved—are at the heart 
of most of Linda’s volunteer work. She is a 
former Presidentand Recording Secretary of 
Endowment for Youth Community and a mem-
ber and Treasurer of George Washington 
Carver Scholarship Club for over thirty years. 
Prior to the pandemic Linda volunteered at the 
Buellton Library with the ‘‘Tail Waggers,’’ an 
elementary student reading program, and was 
part of the Adult Literacy Program assisting 
adult English language learners. 
Linda is a devoted advocate for the Black 
community in Santa Barbara County, who pro-
motes voting and civic engagement among 
BIPOC residents of Santa Barbara County. 
She is a member of the Santa Maria NAACP 
and an Advisory Board member of Santa Bar-
bara’s Martin Luther King Jr. Committee, re-
cruiting Santa Ynez Valley students to partici-
pate in the Poetry and Essay Contest for the

the Non-Profit Board of Madi’s Treasure Box, 
an organization started by an eight-year-old 
girl whose mission is to provide multicultural 
tools promoting literacy and inclusion to 
schools and libraries across the U.S. 
Linda has served as Recording Secretary 
for Santa Ynez Valley Woman’s Club and is a 
member of True Vine Bible Fellowship Church, 
where she volunteers in the nursery, as a 
church usher, and Hospitality Committee 
member. 
I am honored to recognize Linda for her 
continued commitment to Santa Barbara 
County. I ask all Members to join me today in 
honoring a dedicated woman of California’s 
24th Congressional District, Linda Tyler-Ryles, 
for her incredible service to her community. 
RECOGNIZING DR. MARK H, 
JOHNSTON 
HON. JASON CROW 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 26, 2022 
Mr. CROW. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the accomplishments of Dr. Mark 
Johnston, and to congratulate him on his 
membership to the National Academy of 
Sciences. 
A trailblazer in the field of Biochemistry and 
Molecular Genetics, Dr. Johnston’s lab has 
been a leader shedding light on how cells re-
spond to glucose. He has played a vital role 
in the sequencing of the yeast genome, and is 
a 
pioneer 
in 
the 
field 
of 
comparative 
genomics. 
In addition to his research, Dr. Johnston has 
been a professor since 1983. He began his 
teaching journey at the Washington University 
School of Medicine, until 2009, when he relo-
cated to the University of Colorado Denver. 
He currently serves as Professor Emeritus at 
the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical 
Campus in Aurora, Colorado. Additionally, he 
worked as Editor-in-Chief at the journal, GE-
NETICS, for 12 years—a journal that has ex-
isted at the forefront of the field for the past 
century. He has published more than 100 pa-
pers and articles, as well as a popular science 
book, the Genetic Twists of Fate. 
Dr. Johnston has no small collection of ac-
colades. In 2008, he received the George W. 
Beadle Award from the Genetics Society of 
America, and in 2012, was elected to the 
American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He 
has received a series of fellowships among 
other field-related recognitions. 
In 2022, Dr. Johnston was elected as a 
member of the National Academy of Sciences. 
There is no application process to become a 
member—rather 
membership 
is 
singularly 
achieved through an election process, and 
only 120 members may be elected annually. 
Membership is considered and accepted as a 
mark of excellence in science, and is consid-
ered one of the highest honors a scientist can 
receive. 
Dr. Johnston’s contributions to the scientific 
community, University of Colorado Anschutz 
Medical Campus, and those around him have 
been enormous. I congratulate him for his 
membership to the National Academy of 
Sciences, as well as an incredible career in 
the field of genetics.

At the young age of 17, Marvin continued 
that legacy of military service, joining the U.S. 
Navy, and was named a chartered member of 
the Hancock County Mississippi National 
Guard in 1954. Upon returning home from the 
U.S. Navy, Marvin worked for the Chevron Oil 
Company and the Global Marine Drilling Com-
pany as an electrician and in automation on 
offshore oil fields. In 1978, Mr. Lacoste found-
ed Marvin Lacoste Repair Service, which has 
provided heating and air conditioning services

Marvin was one of the founding members of 
the Hancock County Republican Party. He

many local, State, and Federal government of-
ficials. 
Marvin is an astute business owner, but he 
is also known for his tireless public service 
and commitment to the betterment of the Mis-
sissippi Gulf Coast. For decades, Marvin has 
participated in local chapters of Shriners Hos-
pitals for Children, the Scottish Rite of Free-
masonry, and several other community serv-
ice-focused endeavors.

CELEBRATING THE RETIREMENT 
OF BOB ARNOULD 
HON. PETE AGUILAR 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 26, 2022 
Mr. AGUILAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor one of California’s favorite adopted 
Iowans. Bob Arnould, a former Speaker of the 
Iowa House of Representatives and fierce ad-
vocate for not-for-profit credit unions, has offi-
cially retired from his role as a Chief Advocate 
for his industry. I’ve had the pleasure of work-
ing with Bob and rise to honor both a good 
friend and a visionary leader. 
Bob started at the California and Nevada 
Credit Union Leagues as the Director of State 
Government Affairs. His team was responsible 
for all credit union advocacy measures in the 
world’s fifth-largest economy at a time when 
the state was shifting politically, and the finan-
cial services sector was under the microscope 
for every act of lending. Credit union advocacy 
was still new to the Legislature and Bob made 
it his mission to develop long lasting relation-
ships with the state’s leaders. 
This is where Bob grew the advocacy pro-
gram from an organizational standpoint, which 
has changed California and Nevada credit 
unions, as well as the lives of their leaders 
and members. As he advanced to Vice Presi-
dent and eventually Senior Vice President of 
Advocacy, Bob expanded the three-person of-
fice to a full team devoted to advocacy’s 
‘‘three-legged stool’’ as he calls it: lobbying, 
political action and grassroots engagement. 
He developed and fostered a team that would 
go on to become a force in Sacramento and 
Carson City. Legislators, some of them my 
colleagues now, knew that when credit unions 
walked in the door, they could not be an after-
thought. 
Before coming to the Leagues, Bob was the 
Speaker of the Iowa State Assembly. For 20 
years before that, he worked his way up from 
rank-and-file 
Assemblyman, 
through 
com-
mittee chairs and party leaders, to a political 
career eventually culminating in the Speaker-
ship. He worked in the Iowa Caucuses and 
ran campaigns from his young 20’s, until he 
came to California and the Leagues in the late 
’90s. To earn this level of trust among the 
Iowa community, he had to demonstrate a 
level of community devotion and something 
else rarely found in politicians: humility. Those 
who know and work with Bob to this day know 
that he embodies this. 
Encapsulating Bob’s leadership throughout 
the California and Nevada Credit Union 
Leagues is not an easy task. He is a visionary 
leader, honest and decent person, but I’m 
proud to know him most as a good friend. His 
entire career has been dedicated to one mis-
sion statement, it’s less about you, and all 
about them: the community, the people, every-
one. Bob makes it 100 percent about you. 
Rarely has there been a leader with such 
humility who recognizes that all great leaders 
give away their credit to allow others to rise. 
That is how he has accomplished so much. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in honoring 
Speaker Bob Arnould.

HONORING LUKE MALLON 
HON. SAM GRAVES 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 26, 2022 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam Speaker, 
I proudly pause to recognize Luke Mallon. 
Luke is a very special young man who has ex-
emplified the finest qualities of citizenship and 
leadership by taking an active part in the Boy 
Scouts of America, Troop 1214, and earning 
the most prestigious award of Eagle Scout. 
Luke has been very active with his troop, 
participating in many scout activities, such as 
the Mile Swim. Over the many years Luke has 
been involved with scouting, he has not only 
earned 29 merit badges, but also the respect 
of his family, peers, and community. Luke has 
achieved much as a scout, having achieved 
the ranks of Patrol Leader, and Den Chief. 
Luke has also contributed to his community 
through his Eagle Scout project. Luke’s project 
saw him build and install birdhouses and a 
bird feeder at a local bird sanctuary. 
Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join 
me in commending Luke Mallon for his ac-
complishments with the Boy Scouts of Amer-
ica, and for his efforts put forth in achieving 
the highest distinction of Eagle Scout.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF 
WAYNE C. BECKMAN 
HON. JACK BERGMAN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 26, 2022 
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, it is my 
honor to recognize the life of servicemen 
Wayne C. Beckman, who recently passed 
away on July 1, 2022, at the age of 88. A 
proud U.S. Navy Veteran and a lifelong mem-
ber of the American Legion, Wayne was an in-
dispensable part of Michigan’s First District. 
Wayne, a lifelong Yooper and native of 
Ironwood, enlisted in the U.S. Navy in 1951 
and served in the Korean War aboard the 
USS Moale as a Radarman. Throughout his 
service, he was awarded the National De-
fense, Korean Service, United Nations, and 
Navy Occupation Medals. One of his most 
prized accomplishments was sailing around 
the world before turning 18 years old. After 
nearly three years, Wayne was honorably dis-
charged in 1954. After his service to our Na-
tion, he returned home where he met his wife, 
Bonita Beckman. They were married in 1958 
and raised four children together. Wayne was 
also a proud grandfather and great-grand-
father. He was known as a ‘‘pillar of the com-
munity,’’ and enjoyed attending his kids’ and 
grandkids’ extracurricular activities. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of Michigan’s 
First District, I ask you to join me in honoring 
the life and service of Wayne C. Beckman. His 
dedication to his country, community; and fam-
ily will never be forgotten.

July 26, 2022 
my office extends special recognition to 
women on the Central Coast who have made 
a difference in our community. I would like to 
recognize one outstanding Women of the Year 
Award recipient, Reverend Caroline Hall of 
Los Osos, California. 
The Reverend Doctor Caroline J. Addington 
Hall is a tireless advocate for the homeless, 
for the LGBTQ+ community, for the environ-
ment, for social justice, for children, and for 
our furry and feathered friends. She doesn’t 
just talk; she DOES. 
Caroline Hall was the Executive Director of 
Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA) 
for San Luis Obispo County before being 
called to the ministry. She now serves as Rec-
tor at St. Benedict’s Episcopal Church, a vi-
brant and welcoming faith community with 
deep roots in social and environmental justice 
and community organizing in Los Osos. She 
ministers to the members of St. Benedict’s 
with her usual dedication as the Rector, as 
well as to individuals in the community who 
are unhoused or struggling with major life 
challenges. People know her kind and loving 
dedication, making St. Benedict’s the place for 
anyone in trouble, needing a motel, gas for 
their car, or just a ride. 
An advocate for the unhoused and under-
serviced, Rev. Hall is vocal about the need for 
increased homeless services. She served as 
Executive Director and later President of Peo-
ple of Faith for Justice (PFJ) within San Luis 
Obispo County, which advocates for social 
justice for the underserved and marginalized, 
as well as for peace and nonviolence. She 
currently serves on the County’s Homeless 
Services Oversight Council. Rev. Hall has 
spent many nights at the local warming shelter 
for unhoused people during cold and rainy 
weather and developed a pilot safe parking 
program. She has taken many unhoused to 
doctor appointments, vet appointments for 
their animals, and bought them food and cloth-
ing. As Chair of the nonprofit Los Osos Cares, 
she oversees the assistance programs for vul-
nerable residents in Los Osos, Cayucos, and 
Morro Bay. 
Rev. Hall has served on the GALA board, 
was a founding member of the Coalition of 
Welcoming Congregations, advocating for the 
LGBTQ+ community—especially in faith com-
munities—and for social justice. She has 
served as a board member and president of 
Integrity USA, the national Episcopal ministry 
for LGBTQ+ persons, helping to pass national 
resolutions supporting the Employment Non- 
Discrimination Act, same-gender marriage, 
and addressing gender identity and advocating 
for legislation protecting transgender individ-
uals. She is also the author of A Thorn in the 
Flesh, presenting the history of LGBTQ inclu-
sion in the Episcopal Church. 
Rev. Hall encourages others to be good 
stewards of our earth through her work with

cese of El Camino Real, as a member of the 
Earth Care Team at St. Benedict’s, and has

She truly is a woman that believes being part 
of the solution is required for all of us to make 
our community, country, and world a better 
place for everyone. Her positive impact on the 
community is beyond measure. 
I am honored to recognize Reverend Caro-
line Hall for her continued commitment to San 
Luis Obispo County. I ask all Members to join 
me today in honoring an exceptional woman 
of California’s 24th Congressional District, 
Reverend Caroline Hall, for her incredible 
service to her community.

HONORING QUINLAN-HAMMOND 
HALL OF HONOR 
HON. STEVEN M. PALAZZO 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 26, 2022 
Mr. PALAZZO. Madam Speaker, today, we 
celebrate the dedication and ribbon cutting 
ceremony for the Quinlan-Hammond Hall of 
Honor at the University of Southern Mis-
sissippi. 
The Quinlan-Hammond Hall of Honor is a 
state-of-the-art facility that represents the Uni-
versity of Southern Mississippi’s commitment 
to honor our nation’s heroes. The dedication 
ceremony will honor Joe Quinlan, USM alum-
nus and lead benefactor for the Hall of Honor, 
as well as U.S. Army Major General (Retired) 
Jeff Hammond, USM alumnus and former 
Golden Eagles Football Team Captain and 
Quarterback. These two gentlemen have 
earned this recognition for their service to the 
Golden Eagle community. 
The University’s Center for Military Vet-
erans, Service Members and Families pro-
vides guidance and support to Student-Vet-
erans in their academic and professional pur-
suits. Major General Jeff Hammond, who 
serves as the Center’s Director, has led the 
University of Southern Mississippi to earn nu-
merous prestigious recognitions, including the 
top Military Caring University across the State 
of Mississippi, designation as a Purple Heart 
Institution, and ranking No. 1 in the Southeast 
by Military Times in its ‘‘Best for Vets: Col-
leges 2021 Rankings.’’ 
The new Quinlan-Hammond Hall of Honor 
will provide more than 1,700 USM Military Stu-
dents and Student-Veterans with a home of 
their own that is commensurate with the honor 
of which they are deserving. 
Today is a special day. The dedication and 
ribbon cutting ceremony for the Quinlan-Ham-
mond Hall of Honor symbolizes the University 
of Southern Mississippi’s continued commit-
ment and gratitude to our nation’s heroes for 
their unwavering dedication to our country. As 
a Marine veteran and USM alumnus, I want to 
thank the University’s Administration, the USM 
Foundation, and the more than 150 USM 
alumni donors who made the construction of 
the new Quinlan-Hammond Hall of Honor pos-
sible for their commitment to honor those who 
serve.

CONGRATULATING 
MEMPHIS 
BROADCAST JOURNALIST MEARL 
PURVIS 
HON. STEVE COHEN 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 26, 2022 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to pay tribute to a television reporter and an-
chor Mearl Purvis, revered throughout the 
Memphis area. After more than 30 years on 
television and 18 years on the Fox 13 news 
desk, Mearl Purvis will anchor her final news-
casts on July 29. I first met Mearl as a state 
senator, and I found her thoughtful and tena-
cious reporting useful to the public’s under-
standing of important issues. Mearl graduated 
from Jackson State University and worked as 
a reporter and anchor in Charlotte, North 
Carolina; New Haven, Connecticut; Jackson, 
Mississippi, and Nashville before moving to 
Memphis in 1992. On her first day at WMC, 
she was thoughtfully covering a proposed 
state income tax and major improvements to 
Memphis International Airport. In 2004, Mearl 
moved across town to the Fox 13 anchor 
desk, where she has been involved in major 
local news. As a reporter and speaker, she 
has shared a stage with world leaders includ-
ing Desmond Tutu, Mikhail Gorbachev, and 
U.S. presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton. 
Mearl has won eight Regional Emmy Awards, 
the prestigious Edward R. Murrow Award, the 
equally prestigious George Foster Peabody 
Award and J.C. Penney Missouri Award. A 
standout supporter in private life for her com-
munity, Mearl is an active volunteer for the 
Boys and Girls Clubs of Greater Memphis, a 
supporter of Porter Leath and Bridges USA. 
She is also a Board of Visitors member of the 
University of Tennessee Health Science Cen-
ter. As a mother, Mearl also has invested 
quality time in Memphis elementary schools 
reading to children, a cause about which she 
is passionate. I commend my friend Mearl for 
her service to our community and wish her all 
the best in retirement.

HONORING HENRY CHAPMAN 
HON. SAM GRAVES 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 26, 2022 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam Speaker, 
I proudly pause to recognize Henry Chapman. 
Henry is a very special young man who has 
exemplified the finest qualities of citizenship 
and leadership by taking an active part in the 
Boy Scouts of America, Troop 120, and earn-
ing the most prestigious award of Eagle Scout. 
Henry has been very active with his troop, 
participating in many scout activities, such as 
camping for a total of 58 nights, hiking more 
than 24 miles, and serving 35 hours of com-
munity service. Over the many years Henry 
has been involved with scouting, he has not 
only earned 59 merit badges and 7 Eagle 
Palms, but also the respect of his family, 
peers, and community. Henry has achieved 
much as a scout, having achieved the ranks of 
Quartermaster, Troop Guide, and Den Chief. 
He also earned his Totin’ Chip, Den Chief 
Service 
Award, 
Emergency 
Preparedness 
BSA Award, and the National Achievement 
Award for Camping. Henry has also contrib-
uted to his community through his Eagle Scout 
project. Henry’s project saw him build an out-
door deposit box that allows the public to hon-
orably retire flags that are a symbol to our 
country. There is also a donation bin on the 
box where people can donate to a veteran’s 
charity.

HONORING HERMAN MACK 
WOODEN 
HON. DWIGHT EVANS 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 26, 2022 
Mr. EVANS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor an influential member of the Philadel-
phia community, a leader and staunch advo-
cate for employee rights. In 1989, Mr. Herman 
Wooden was elected to the position of Sec-
retary Treasurer of Local 1776, making him 
the first African American constitutional officer 
and the chief financial officer of the union. Mr. 
Wooden held that position for 17 years, until 
his retirement in 2006. Mr. Wooden dedicated 
his life and career to improving the lives of 
working families. 
Mr. Herman Mack Wooden was born on ay 
31, 1945, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He 
was the son of the late James Wooden and 
Josephine Pierce. Herman was educated in 
the Philadelphia public school system. He 
graduated from Simon Gratz High School and 
completed some college courses. Herman en-
listed in the Army in September 1963. He was 
honorably discharged as a Sergeant in Janu-
ary 1966. 
Mr. Wooden began his career with United 
Food Workers (UFCW) 1357, now Local 1776, 
in 1966 working as a clerk at the Wine & Spirit 
Shoppes, formerly known as the State Liquor 
Stores in Philadelphia, PA. While working as a 
clerk, he became heavily involved in the orga-
nizing effort to unionize the State store em-
ployees across the entire Commonwealth of 
Pennsylvania. 
In addition to working as a clerk, Mr. Wood-
en worked at the Philadelphia Parking Author-
ity which ultimately led to him serving as Chair 
of the Philadelphia Parking Authority. Focusing 
on his passion, in 1971, Herman’s effort to 
unionize state liquor store, pharmacy and su-
permarket employees was successful. He was 
very instrumental to the success of these in-
dustry workers campaigning to join Local 
1357. 
In 1975, Mr. Wooden was hired as a full- 
time staff member of Local 1357 as an orga-
nizer/representative. During his long career 
with the union, he held numerous positions 
that included Organizer, Representative, Polit-
ical Representative and Lobbyist, Lead Rep-
resentative, Servicing Director, and Executive 
Assistant to the President just to name a few. 
Furthermore, with all those positions, Herman 
continued to advocate for the rights of all 
working people and championed more diver-
sity and inclusion in the labor movement. As 
noted above, in 1989, Mr. Wooden was elect-
ed to the position of Secretary Treasurer of 
Local 1776. In appreciation of his years of 
service and contribution to laborers’ rights, Mr. 
Wooden was recognized by the Senate of 
Pennsylvania. 
In retirement, Mr. Wooden continued his 
work as a board member for the UFCW Minor-
ity Coalition, United Latinos, and Women’s 
Network. These are all constituency groups, 
with the UFCW, that advocate for more diver-
sity and inclusion in the labor movement; 
which are two areas that were very important 
to Herman throughout his entire life. He con-
tinued to assist in the efforts to protect the 
jobs of those same liquor store union mem-
bers, that he originally helped organize over 
50 years ago, right up until his last days. Her-
man Wooden was a real-life example of what 
it meant to be a trade unionist. 
Today, we mourn the passing of Mr. Her-
man Wooden which occurred on July 22, 
2022.

HONORING THE LIFE AND WORK 
OF MRS. MATTIE MCALISTER 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 26, 2022 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in tribute to a one-of-a-kind woman in Toledo, 
Mrs. Mattie McAlister, who passed from this 
life at the age of 98 years on July 7, 2022. 
Mattie McAlister was a giant in the education 
of the young people of Toledo. 
Mattie McAlister was born in Benton, South 
Carolina, the youngest of eleven children born 
to Pearl and Arthur Garrison, he a teacher and 
she a midwife. Her father started a school for 
Black children in their rural county and taught 
adults in the evening in the Garrison home. 
Mattie graduated high school at age fourteen, 
obtained her bachelor’s degree and began 
teaching high school math and science. She 
went on to study at Detroit’s Wayne State Uni-
versity, the former Mary Manse College in To-
ledo, and earned her master’s degree from the 
University of Toledo. 
Upon her arrival in Toledo in 1960, Mattie 
McAlister took employment with Toledo Public 
Schools, 
teaching 
at 
several 
elementary 
schools until her retirement from Fulton School 
in 1991. After that, she worked with children at 
Grace Community Center and developed a 
curriculum there. She researched and devel-
oped methods to address the uniqueness of 
‘‘Summer’s Child,’’ a term she coined for those 
children born in the summer who were often 
the youngest of their peers in school. 
Her obituary in the Toledo Blade makes 
clear the influence Mrs. McAlister had on her 
young charges and the educational system: 
‘‘Mrs. McAlister retired in 2014 from Grace 
Community Center, where she developed a 
curriculum and worked with children, from 
kindergarten through eighth grade. She also 
shared pearls of wisdom that have become 
part of Grace’s culture. Her sayings ‘‘had to 
do with how you treat one another in this 
world,’’ said Elaine Taite Page, Grace execu-
tive director since 2012. 
‘‘She told students, ‘Nurture your mind 
with great thoughts, for you will never go 
higher than you think,’ and ‘The nicest 
words I know are, ‘Excuse me,’ ‘Thank you,’ 
‘If you please,’ ’’ Ms. Page said, Students en-
ergetically chanted, ‘‘Good, better, best. 
Never let it rest. Your good becomes better, 
and your better becomes best.’’ 
‘‘Those sayings are on display at the Cen-
ter. 
‘‘There was never a student she could not 
reach,’’ Ms. Page said. ‘‘She made people un-
derstand, I see you, I value you, and you are 
somebody.’’ 
‘‘The one word that epitomizes what was 
driving her is a four-letter word. Love. Love 
supreme,’’ Ms. Page said. 
‘‘In the Center’s after-school programs, she 
arranged children in a circle. Sitting on an 
African-style chair of carved wood, she 
opened with, ‘How was your day?’ ’’ Ms. Page 
said. 
‘‘She could glean needs that had to be 
heard, to be recognized. She had a positive 
affirmation to leave with every child,’’ Ms. 
Page said. 
‘‘Mrs. McAlister worked to reinforce read-
ing and math skills during the Center’s sum-
mer program and guided high schoolers who 
had returned to be youth leaders. 
‘‘In 
one 
of 
several 
autobiographical 
sketches, Mrs. McAlister wrote that at 
Grace, ‘‘my greatest joy was creating learn-
ing games, successfully teaching language 
arts and math, along with character-building 
exercises. I enjoyed sharing parenting tips 
for parents who had precocious children who 
challenged authority.’’ 
‘‘My greatest pride,’’ Mrs. McAlister wrote, 
‘‘was teaching children to read and man-
aging my children’s behavior in a kind and 
caring way. I did not send them to the prin-
cipal to be controlled. I dearly loved my stu-
dents. Each one of them was my pet!’’ 
Mattie McAlister’s lessons for life for anyone 
who struggled; indeed for everyone, showed 
that what you lived, how you contributed, is 
what matters. She never lost patience. She 
had a teacher’s cadence when she spoke, and 
people listened. Her lessons on life should be 
on billboards for all to learn. 
Spiritual, poet, teacher, mentor, matriarch, 
activist, all are words which describe Mattie 
McAlister, and her legacy is writ large. Yet, as 
profound as her impact has been for the near 
century of her life, Mattie McAlister’s greatest 
achievement is her family. To her children, 
grandchildren, great-grandchildren and great- 
great-grandchildren, we pray for peace in the 
memory of the priceless gift of Mattie Garrison 
McAlister’s life well lived.

HONORING 
CITY 
OF 
DIAMONDHEAD, MISSISSIPPI ON 
THEIR 10TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. STEVEN M. PALAZZO 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 26, 2022 
Mr. PALAZZO. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the city of Diamondhead, Mis-
sissippi on the 10th anniversary of its incorpo-
ration. 
Diamondhead received its charter as the 
111th city in Mississippi by Secretary of State 
Delbert Hosemann on February 6, 2012. Much 
of the land that would ultimately become 
Diamondhead was purchased by Walter Gex 
Sr., in 1937 from the Gulf State Paper Com-
pany and the Easy Opener Bag Company. In 
the late 1960s, the Diamondhead Corporation, 
with interests in resort developments, devel-
oped Diamondhead on the Mississippi Gulf 
Coast, with Diamondhead as its first project 
because the land is the highest point of ele-
vation in the area. Therefore, the project was 
named ‘‘Diamondhead’’ after an iconic vol-
canic cone on the Hawaiian island of Oahu. 
On October 25, 1961, NASA announced the 
formation of the Mississippi Test Facility, now 
the John C. Stennis Space Center. The center 
would border the Pearl River in Hancock 
County. Along with the center’s construction 
an influx of government workers and contrac-
tors moved into the area. The community ex-
perienced additional growth as other enter-
prises arrived including the Naval Oceano-
graphic Office at Stennis Space Center and

the Michaud Assembly Facility in New Orleans 
East. 
Diamondhead was initially organized as a 
property owners association (POA) but on 
January 1, 1985, the Purcell Company (for-
merly the Diamondhead Corporation) turned 
over the POA to a homeowners board of di-
rectors. Following Hurricane Katrina, the POA 
experienced hardships that led to the need for 
added federal and state financial resources. 
Therefore in 2009, a vote for Diamondhead to 
become a city was filed with the Hancock 
Chancery Court, and an election approved the 
incorporation. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to recognize 
the 
visionaries 
and 
homeowners 
of 
Diamondhead who worked tirelessly to bring 
Diamondhead to what it is today, ‘‘a Commu-
nity Where the Living is Easy’’.

HONORING THE TRADITION AND 
ACCOMPLISHMENTS 
OF 
THE 
SOUL CHILDREN OF CHICAGO 
HON. DANNY K. DAVIS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 26, 2022 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, today, I wish to honor The Soul Chil-
dren of Chicago headed by Dr. Walt Whitman, 
Jr. This organization, created in 1981, is the 
Nation’s 
oldest 
internationally-acclaimed, 
Grammy-award-winning, youth, gospel choir. 
The choir has performed internationally in 
Sweden, Italy, Holland, Israel, and Switzer-
land, and across the United States, even per-
forming for nearly 1.7 billion people on the 
opening day of the 2010 World Cup in South 
Africa as well as at the White House for Presi-
dents George H. W. Bush, Richard Nixon, and 
Ronald Reagan. The Soul Children of Chicago 
has recorded with Stevie Wonder, Mariah 
Carey, Neil Diamond, Yolanda Adams, and 
many other notables. The list of accomplish-
ments goes on. 
However, The Soul Children of Chicago is 
much more than the prestigious awards and 
accolades it has garnered. The organization is 
a living testament to the promise of Psalm 
37:3, ‘‘Take delight in the LORD, and He will 
give you the desires of your heart.’’ 
Under the direction and passion-filled guid-
ance of Dr. Walt Whitman, Jr., The Soul Chil-
dren of Chicago serves as a catalyst for the 
education, elevation, and illumination of Chi-
cago’s youth. 
Although it has garnered many awards and 
international recognitions, these accomplish-
ments have never been the goal. The goal 
has always focused on utilizing music as the 
motivator to inspire young people worldwide to 
have faith in themselves, each other, and 
God. This dedication to youth uplift is rooted 
in the principle of ‘‘taking delight in the LORD’’ 
and has marked Dr. Whitman and The Soul 
Children of Chicago as household names both 
in the United States and overseas. 
Please make no mistake; the journey of The 
Soul Children of Chicago has been chal-
lenging. But it has been worth it. 
The Soul Children of Chicago is bigger than 
rehearsals. Bigger than a choir. Bigger than 
an organization. It is family. Further, this family 
has spawned graduates, artists, pastors, busi-
ness owners, community leaders, profes-
sionals, doctors, lawyers, and entrepreneurs. 
This family presents students with the tools 
and accountability to excel in any task they 
undertake, whether succeeding in school, 
staying out of gangs and drug culture, or culti-
vating a spirit of excellence. 
The Soul Children of Chicago is a family 
that takes delight in the LORD, and, for that 
reason, I believe that He will continue to give 
them all the desires of their hearts. Dr. Walt 
Whitman, Jr., the head of this family, began a 
good work in 1981, and, by the grace of God, 
he will carry it on to completion until the day 
of Christ Jesus. 
I await their continued success an excel-
lence in the years to come.

tributed to his community through his Eagle 
Scout project. Evan’s project saw him repaint 
fire hydrants throughout his city, performing a

Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join 
me in commending Evan Spiwak for his ac-
complishments with the Boy Scouts of Amer-
ica, and for his efforts put forth in achieving

CELEBRATING MARION F. SMITH’S 
100TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. A. DONALD McEACHIN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 26, 2022 
Mr. MCEACHIN. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
celebrate the life and accomplishments of 
Marion F. Smith, a constituent of Virginia’s 4th 
Congressional District. This July 20th, Ms. 
Smith will reach the milestone of her 100th 
birthday. 
Marion F. Smith was born on July 20, 1922 
in Chesapeake, Virginia, to Isaiah and Laura 
Ferebee. Laura, a mid-wife, and Isaiah, a 
farmer, raised their 7 children through the 
Great Depression and encouraged each of 
them to chase opportunities and live their lives 
to the fullest. 
Ms. Smith learned about perseverance early 
on. In elementary and middle school she 
walked five miles each way to and from 
school. In 1939, she graduated from Provi-
dence High School and was married in 1943. 
While this marriage ended in 1960, it provided 
her with 3 beloved children: Roderick, John, 
and Rita. 
A lifelong learner, Ms. Smith sought edu-
cation at every level. She was initially able to 
take classes at Women’s College in Greens-
boro and Norfolk State University. She earned 
enough credits to enter the Teacher Corps 
Program in 1971 and graduated from Norfolk 
State University in 1973 with her B.S. in Ele-
mentary Education. She also found time to 
serve her community by working for the 
Southeastern Tidewater Opportunity Project 
(STOP) in Norfolk, helping to alleviate poverty 
in low-income communities. 
After graduation, with her degree in hand, 
Marion returned to Chesapeake and became a 
teacher in Chesapeake Public Schools. The 
lifelong learner she was, Marion continued her 
education and graduated from Old Dominion 
University with her master’s degree in edu-
cation in 1987. She retired from Chesapeake 
Public Schools in 1989. Ms. Smith is also a 
member of Phi Delta Kappa, a professional or-
ganization for Educators, in the Alpha Lambda 
Chapter. 
In addition to her passion for education, she 
is also a woman of faith. She grew up in a 
Christian family and is currently a member at 
Covenant Fellowship. She is also a Past Ma-
tron of The Order of the Eastern Star of Vir-
ginia. 
While Marion has centered her life around 
education, service, and spirituality, she also 
loves to bake and cook, she loves cars and 
houses, and especially loves to bowl. After re-
tiring, Marion decided to take up bowling and 
continued her bowling career until she turned 
97. She still notes how much she enjoys the 
sport. 
Marion has lived a life of faith, love, and 
grace. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in wishing Marion F. Smith a happy 100th 
birthday.

University of Louisville’s Southern Police Insti-
tute 129th Administrative Officers Course, the 
Law Enforcement Command College at the 
University of Mississippi, Leadership Gulf 
Coast, and Gulf Coast Business Council-Mas-
ters Leadership Class. 
Jones began his public service career in 
1993 with the Biloxi Police Department as a 
reserve police officer and progressed to a full- 
time officer in 1995. During his tenure at Biloxi 
Police Department, Jones worked as a part- 
time instructor at the Harrison County Law En-
forcement Training Academy. In June 2000, 
Jones left the Biloxi Police Department to be-
come a full-time instructor for the Harrison 
County Sheriffs Department’s Law Enforce-
ment Training Academy where he was pro-
moted to the Director of the Southern Re-
gional Public Safety Institute and secured $1 
million federally earmarked for the Mississippi 
Rural Law Enforcement Mobile Training Pro-
gram. In the latter part of his career, Jones 
joined the D’Iberville Police Department and 
served as a narcotics investigator, promoted 
to the rank of Captain, Operations Com-
mander, Deputy Chief of Police, and City Man-
ager. 
For his service, Jones has been awarded 
numerous prestigious awards including a two- 
time recipient of the Medal of Valor, the City 
of Biloxi Mayor’s Commendation, Deputy of 
the Year, Officer of the Year, a two-time re-
cipient of the Southern Regional Public Safety 
Institute’s Outstanding Instructor Award, and a 
two-time recipient of the Police Star Award. 
Jones has continuously gone above and be-
yond to answer the call of public service. I am 
grateful for his service and dedication to South 
Mississippi. Most importantly, he embodies the 
virtues of integrity, hard work, and selfless-
ness that South Mississippians expect from 
their government officials. Clay leaves the City 
of D’Iberville better than he found it. On behalf 
of the Fourth Congressional District of Mis-
sissippi, I congratulate Clay Jones on his re-
tirement.
