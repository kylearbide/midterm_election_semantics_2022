DESIGNATION OF THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker: 
WASHINGTON, DC,

I hereby appoint the Honorable DWIGHT

f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Gracious God, we grieve yet again for 
the loss of one of our own, another 
brave member of the Capitol Police, 
William ‘‘Billy’’ Evans. We pray for his 
family and friends, for those who 
served alongside him, and all those who 
so deeply feel his passing. 
On Friday, many Christians acknowl-
edged the sacrifice You made in Your 
love for us. How profound it is that on 
that same day, Officer Evans sacrificed 
his own life for the love of his country 
and the defense of democracy. There is 
no greater love. 
Dare we, God, pray also for souls like 
Noah Green, whose life was tormented 
by 
mental 
illness 
and 
depression. 
Sadly, there are countless others who 
wrestle with these afflictions and un-
controllable rage, who believe that life 
is only a war to be fought. Lord, even 
in our anger, may we find a way to 
pray for those who would turn their 
wrath on us. 
God, we desire atonement for these 
atrocities 
and 
for 
the 
injustices 
brought upon the Capitol, and we need 
answers for their prevention. Hear our 
prayers for wisdom and courage. May 
we lay down our fear, anger, frustra-
tion, and deep sadness before Your 
throne of grace, that Your divine judg-
ment would prevail; that Yours would 
be the last word; and that Your peace 
and justice would reign in this place, in 
our lives, and in this country. 
We pray in the abiding love of Your 
holy name. 
Amen.

BRANDON BENEDICT 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 5, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud Brandon 
Benedict for receiving the Arvada Wheat 
Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth award. 
Brandon Benedict is a student at Arvada 
West H.S. and received this award because 
his determination and hard work have allowed 
him to overcome adversities. 
The dedication demonstrated by Brandon 
Benedict is exemplary of the type of achieve-
ment that can be attained with hard work and 
perseverance. It is essential students at all 
levels strive to make the most of their edu-
cation and develop a work ethic which will 
guide them for the rest of their lives. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to 
Brandon Benedict for winning the Arvada 
Wheat Ridge Service Ambassador for Youth 
award. I have no doubt he will exhibit the 
same dedication and character in all of his fu-
ture accomplishments.

HONORING JESSE TURNER 
MORRIS, JR. 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 5, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. Jesse Tur-
ner Morris, Jr. Jessie Turner Morris, Jr. was a 
civil rights activist. He was born in Philadel-
phia, Pennsylvania on February 8, 1937 to 
Amanda Louise Wooten Morris and Jesse Tur-
ner Morris. In the early part of his life the fam-
ily lived in Wilmington, Delaware. Jesse would 
later move to Los Angeles, California where 
he graduated from Polytechnic High School. 
Mr. Morris’ love for math led him to obtain a 
BS degree in Economics from UCLA, where 
he was a member of the swim team. He 
furthered his education by obtaining a mas-
ter’s degree in Agricultural Economics from 
Iowa State University. In the early 1960s Mr. 
Morris moved to Jackson, Mississippi and 
began in earnest his work to empower Black 
southerners working with the Student Non-
violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and 
the 
Council 
of 
Federated 
Organizations 
(COFO). Through his involvement in the Civil 
Rights Movement, Mr. Morris met Euvester 
Simpson, with whom he had a 22-year mar-
riage and five children. Black institution build-
ing was one of his long-term goals, and in 
1966, Mr. Morris helped establish the Poor 
People’s Cooperative, which provided loans 
and assistance to poor people to start cooper-
ative businesses and actualize a life beyond 
the 
limitations 
of 
the 
racist 
system 
of 
sharecropping. Mr. Morris commitment to 
Black empowerment was unwavering and con-
tinued long after the Movement ended. Mr. 
Morris served as director of the Emergency 
Land Fund for 15 years continuing the work 
that initially brought him to Mississippi, fighting 
to prevent Black people from losing their land. 
During this time, he served on the Editorial 
Board of The Review of Black Political Econ-
omy. In 1984, Mr. Morris became the first Ex-
ecutive Director of the Mississippi Food Bank, 
a clearinghouse for food for charitable organi-
zations in central Mississippi. In later years, he 
worked with the U.N.I.Teaching Youth pro-
gram and volunteered as a Court Appointed 
Special Advocate for children, while continuing 
to support voter registration efforts and initia-
tives to preserve civil rights history. Mr. Morris 
loved a good joke or prank and was always an 
advocate of Black self-determination. Mr. Mor-
ris is survived by his children, Earl Morris 
(Natilyn), Orlando Morris (Trish), and Omar 
Morris of Jackson, Mississippi, Tiyi Morris 
(Judson L. Jeffries) of Westerville, Ohio, and 
Jessica Morris (Thomas Anderson) of Coconut 
Creek, Florida. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing the late civil rights activist 
Mr. Jesse Turner Morris, Jr.

IN 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
THE 
20TH 
PASTORAL 
ANNIVERSARY 
OF 
SUFFRAGAN 
BISHOP 
AVERY 
DUMAS 
III 
AND 
FIRST 
LADY 
ROSALIND DUMAS 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 5, 2021 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Suffragan Bishop Avery 
Dumas III and First Lady Rosalind Dumas of 
Ann Arbor on the occasion of their 20th Pas-
toral Anniversary. Their contributions to our 
community are worthy of commendation. 
Suffragan Bishop Dumas is the son of Dis-
trict Elder Avery Dumas Jr. and First Lady 
emeritus Jeanette Dumas. A graduate of Ypsi-
lanti Public Schools, he attended DeVry Insti-
tute of Technology and worked in the techno-
logical field for major corporations before 
being installed as the Pastor of New Grace 
Apostolic Temple on March 31, 2001 by 
Bishop Harry L. Herman, Diocesan Bishop of 
the 5th Episcopal District of the Pentecostal 
Assemblies of the World. His installation serv-
ice took place just one day before the passing 
of his father, mentor, and best friend, District 
Elder Avery Dumas Jr. 
He has gracefully upheld the legacy of serv-
ice that begun with his father and grandfather 
who originally served as pastor of the church. 
Suffragan Bishop Dumas serves as the chair-
man of the Ghana Council in Africa and over-
sees other churches and pastors in his posi-
tion as Suffragan Bishop. Well known in the 
Ann Arbor/Ypsilanti community, their church 
has touched countless lives through their jail 
and prison ministry, charity drives, campus 
outreach, and community events. 
Suffragan Bishop Dumas married First Lady 
Rosalind Lee Dumas in June 1986 and to-
gether they have three children, Jennifer Lee, 
Madison Elyse, and Avery Dumas IV. Those 
who know him describe him as a dynamic 
servant leader and as ‘‘a man after God’s 
heart.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Suffragan Bishop Avery 
Dumas III and First Lady Rosalind Dumas on 
their 20th Pastoral Anniversary. I join with the 
Dumas’ family, friends, and the entire con-
gregation of the New Grace Apostolic Temple 
in extending my best wishes and gratitude to 
them on their pastoral anniversary.

HONORING THE LIFE OF MAJOR 
GENERAL DAN HELIX 
HON. MARK DeSAULNIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 5, 2021 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the life of Major General 
Dan Helix. 
Dan grew up in West Berkeley, California 
and in 1948 he began his 41-year career with 
the United States Army and Army Reserve. 
He enlisted as a private, but was soon com-
missioned as an Infantry second lieutenant in 
1951. Dan continued to rise through the ranks, 
serving as a platoon leader and company 
commander of a rifle company with the 45th 
Infantry Division during the Korean War. Fol-
lowing the end of the war, Dan worked for 
Army Intelligence in Japan where he met his 
future wife, Mary Lou. The couple dated for a 
few short months before getting married in 
1953. 
Dan and Mary Lou moved to Concord, Cali-
fornia in 1955. Dan attended the University of 
California, Berkeley where he earned a bach-
elor’s degree in History. He later went on to 
obtain a master’s degree in political science 
from San Francisco State University. It was 
while teaching high school government that 
Dan decided to enter local politics. He was 
first elected to the Concord City Council in 
1968, serving for eight years before eventually 
going on to serve as a director of the Bay 
Area Rapid Transit (BART) District. During 
Dan’s time with the BART District, he worked 
to provide discounts for senior riders and sup-
ported the promotion of a woman to the then 
all-male board of directors. He returned to the 
Concord City Council in 2010 as an appointee 
and was elected to one final term in 2012. 
During both of his tenures on the City Council, 
Dan served terms as mayor. 
In 1989, Dan retired from the U.S. Army as 
a Major General. As a Korean War Veteran, 
Dan earned the Army Distinguished Service 
Medal, Silver Star, Legion of Merit, Bronze 
Star with ‘‘V’’ Device, and Purple Heart with 
Oak Leaf Cluster among other commendations

during a distinguished career spent both in ac-
tive duty and with the Army Reserve. He is 
also a member of the U.S. Army’s Infantry Hall 
of Fame. 
As a leader in Concord, Dan was a former 
president of both the Concord Rotary Club 
and the former Mt. Diablo Hospital Founda-
tion, Concord campus, as well as a member of 
a U.S. Congressional commission that evalu-
ated potential changes to the Department of 
the Army. He also advocated for the preserva-
tion of the Lime Ridge Open Space, helped 
establish the Family Justice Center, and was 
instrumental in the building of the Senior Cen-
ter. 
Sadly, Dan passed away in March at the 
age of 91. He was a cherished resident of 
Concord who dedicated his life to helping oth-
ers. Please join me in honoring Major General 
Dan Helix for his many contributions to our 
country and our community.

tory. She graduated from the Institute of Poli-
tics at Millsaps College in Jackson and served 
the college as Vice-President of the Institute 
where she taught, ‘‘Grass-roots Organizing 
and Campaign Management.’’ She is the re-
cipient of one honorary degree, Doctor of Hu-
mane Letters from Tougaloo College in 2018, 
and a Special Presidential Honors Award from 
LeMoyne College of Syracuse, New York. 
Flonzie’s employment and professional ca-
reer has spread from the dusty roads of Mis-
sissippi to the White House as she interacted 
with many individuals of national prominence. 
She was inspired to become involved in the 
civil rights movement in 1963, just after the 
assassination of Medgar Evers. Her inspiration 
continues in a myriad of creative community 
initiatives across the country where she lec-
tures and provides motivational opportunities 
to a cross section of audiences. She continues 
to be a much sought-after speaker. 
On November 5th, 1968, Flonzie was the 
first African American female elected to public 
office in a bi-racial Mississippi town. She cele-
brated the 50th anniversary of her historic 
election in 2018. The position of Election 
Commissioner in Canton, MS, allowed her to 
correct many voting rights injustices through-
out the state. 
She authored and published her first book, 
‘‘Looking Back to Move Ahead,’’ in 1994. In 
1999, the book became a Best Seller for an 
Independent Author. This memoir chronicles 
her growing up years in a small rural Mis-
sissippi town and salutes the involvement of 
scores of unsung heroes and sheroes who 
were similarly involved in the civil rights move-
ment in the 1960’s and 1970’s in Madison 
County and Jackson, Mississippi. Flonzie 
worked with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Am-
bassador 
Andrew 
Young, 
Marian 
Wright 
Edelman, Constance Slaughter Harvey, Alice 
Walker, Judge Reuben Anderson and many 
other humanitarian activists, locally and na-
tionally. 
Flonzie is the recipient of more than 400 na-
tional, state, church, and community service 
awards including the National FBI Citizens 
Award presented by former FBI Director 
James Camey in 2017 in Washington D.C. 
She is a member of the National Association 
of Female Executives, NAACP, SCLC, NCNW, 
and Women for Progress, Inc., among other 
organizations. 
She is president and CEO of FBW & Asso-
ciates, Inc., a marketing consulting firm and is 
the founder of the Flonzie B. Wright Scholar-
ship Foundation, a foundation designed to en-
courage students to stay in school. This foun-
dation has provided more than $45,000.00 in 
scholarship dollars and other enhancements to 
many students. 
Flonzie is featured in the documentary, 
‘‘Standing on My Sisters’ Shoulders.’’ This 
award-winning film honors African American 
and Caucasian women, who were involved in 
the Southern Civil Rights Movement, including 
Annie Devine, Unita Blackwell, and Joan 
Trumpauer Mulholland, to name a few. They 
were honored for their work at the John F. 
Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in 
Washington D.C. She has been featured in 
Purpose Magazine, Tomorrow’s South, ‘‘Black 
America Series, Madison County, MS,’’ ‘‘The 
Sip’’ and has self-produced two documen-
taries, ‘‘Standing Tall in Tough Times’’ and 
‘‘Before I’ll Be Your Slave.’’ She has been fea-
tured in many other publications and docu-
mentaries. Flonzie gave the Keynote Speech 
in Dayton, Ohio the night Barack Obama ac-
cepted the Democratic Party’s Presidential 
Nomination, August 2008. Most recently, 
Flonzie was featured on the cover of the Janu-
ary 2018 issue of the Metro Christian Maga-
zine. 
Before relocating to Mississippi, Flonzie 
served the Miami University in Middletown, 
Ohio as Student Affairs Scholar in Residence 
where she co-wrote a new curriculum, ‘‘Black 
Issues in Higher Education.’’ Even though her 
travels have been extensive and her achieve-
ments many, she simply refers to herself as, 
‘‘Just a Country Girl from Mississippi who 
loves the Lord and ALL people.’’ 
She is a member of the New Hope Baptist 
Church in Jackson, and is the mother of three 
children: Cynthia, Edward (deceased), and 
Darrell. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the life, legacy, and service of 
Flonzie Brown-Wright.

HONORING THE STATUE UNVEIL-
ING OF EARL FRANCIS LLOYD 
HON. DONALD S. BEYER, JR. 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 5, 2021 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
honor of the statue unveiling of Earl Francis 
Lloyd, the first African American to play in a 
National Basketball Association game. The 
City of Alexandria hosted a virtual unveiling for 
Mr. Lloyd’s statue on Saturday, April 3, 2021. 
Despite the challenges he faced in his per-
sonal and professional life, Mr. Lloyd was able 
to succeed while displaying compassion, lead-
ership, and determination. On October 31, 
1950, Mr. Lloyd became the first African 
American to play in an NBA game and played 
in seven games before being drafted into the 
Army. He returned in 1952 and played for the 
Syracuse Nationals. 
Mr. Lloyd further established African Amer-
ican players by becoming an assistant coach 
with the Detroit Pistons in 1968 before taking 
over as head coach in 1971. 
Please join me in commemorating the stat-
ue of Mr. Lloyd, a native Alexandrian who ex-
emplified excellence throughout his life.

The

gram history just one year after the team 
punched their ticket to the state tournament 
that ended up being cancelled due to the

tested their mettle and served as a guiding 
force leading them to a 31–6 record for this 
season. 
The Greeneville Greene Devils opened the 
state tournament by leading the Bolivar Cen-
tral Tigers of Hardeman County for all but 1 
:53 seconds of the game which ended in a 
61–58 victory for Greeneville. The Greene 
Devils then faced the Upperman Bees of Put-
nam County in the semifinals. Upperman 
proved to be a worthy opponent claiming the 
lead for over half of the game, but the Greene 
Devils persevered and came out on top 47– 
41. The only thing standing in their way of 
overall victory was the 25–1 Jackson South 
Side Hawks of Jackson, TN. Greeneville led 
for most of the game, but the Hawks fought 
their way to a one-point lead with just 4:00 
minutes left. With ice in their veins, however, 
the Greene Devils regained the lead and 
never looked back ending with a 47–46 vic-
tory. I am so very proud of these young men 
and their coaches. 
Winning a state championship is a monu-
mental accomplishment and is a testament to 
their commitment to their mission statement 
which is to ‘‘embody the principles and prac-
tices of a community-minded, championship 
basketball program by: utilizing gifts and influ-
ence, emphasizing other-centeredness, and 
developing athleticism and basketball skill.’’ I 
commend these young men, their excellent 
coaching staff and the statisticians and 
videographers who support them on this well- 
deserved title. I wish them equal success in 
their future athletic and academic pursuits. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues 
join me in congratulating the Greeneville High 
School Greene Devils on winning the 2A State 
Championship and representing Tennessee’s 
First Congressional District with such distinc-
tion. I am proud to represent these students 
and wish them all the best in their future en-
deavors.

HONORING MRS. JUDY HUDSON 
BLAND 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 5, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Mrs. Judy Hud-
son Bland. 
Judy Bland moved to Quitman County at the 
age of five with her parents, Floyd and Chris-
tine Hudson and her three older brothers. She 
was educated from first through twelfth grade 
in Marks. Upon high school graduation, she 
attended the University of Mississippi on a 
journalism scholarship her freshman year. 
In the spring of 1963, she married Johnny 
Bland, who had signed a contract with the 
Boston Red Sox and traveled with him to play 
at various locations in their farm system. After 
an eye infection ended his baseball career, he 
began a new one as a banker with First Secu-
rity Bank at the Marks Branch. They brought 
their young family to Marks; a son, Kevin 
Bland, and daughter, Kimberly Bland (Wells), 
who were both educated in Marks; both re-
ceived associate degrees from Northwest 
Community College and B.S. degrees; Kevin, 
from Mississippi State and Kimberly, from 
Delta State. These two children, their spouses 
and her grandchildren have been a constant 
source of joy, pride and inspiration as a part 
of her daily life. 
Bland had obtained her B.S. degree at the 
University of Memphis and worked for several 
years in the Memphis City School System, so 
in 1977, she returned to her teaching career, 
one that included a variety of afterschool pro-
grams which exposed the students in Quitman 
County to new technology and gave them op-
portunities to volunteer for worthwhile projects, 
such as participating in the relief efforts after 
Hurricane Katrina. In 1992, she was honored 
to receive recognition as ‘‘Teacher of the 
Year’’ at Quitman County High School. She 
was also often called upon to interview pro-
spective teachers at recruiting events on col-
lege campuses. 
After her retirement in 2004, she continued 
the spirit of volunteerism. Whenever she saw 
a need, she offered to do what she could to 
fill it and help those in need lift themselves 
above their disadvantages. She helped pa-
tients at DePorres Rural Health Clinic who 
could not afford their medicine apply to the 
pharmaceutical companies for free or at a dis-
counted price. Working with the Community 
Foundation of Northwest Mississippi, she cre-
ated a pilot program for Head Start to educate 
the children on eating nutritious food and to 
encourage their family members to eat 
healthy, as well. Working with the local non-
profit, Youth Opportunities Unlimited, she su-
pervised 
youth 
on 
educational 
fieldtrips; 
helped students learn GIS/GPS technology 
and to map the condemned buildings in 
Quitman County that should be cleared and 
used for environmental friendly projects; pre-
pared yard signs with house numbers to im-
prove 911 accuracy; delivered Emergency Kits 
to elderly residents in the county; helped open 
a fitness center that welcomed all area resi-
dents; and conducted afterschool workshops 
for students on topics, such as financial lit-
eracy, entrepreneurship, and screen printing. 
Working with the Marks Project, a local non-
profit formed in 2017, she has been instru-
mental in providing playground equipment, an 
outdoor fitness trail, and an outstanding foot-
ball field for countywide youth in the City of 
Marks Park; providing an excellent reading 
program for Pre-K, a Saturday tutoring/recre-
ation program for middle school students, con-
ducted on the campus at the University of Mis-
sissippi’s School of Education, and ACT Prep 
Boot Camps at the high school, all in the 
Quitman County School District; and securing 
partnerships 
with 
both 
Northwest 
and 
Coahoma Community College to provide free 
job training to Quitman and its surrounding 
counties. 
Bland has served on numerous boards in 
Quitman County and north Mississippi, includ-
ing the board of directors of DePorres Delta 
Ministries, Youth Opportunities Unlimited, and 
the Marks Project, as well as the Advisory 
Board of the Community Foundation of North-
west Mississippi and the Board of Trustees of 
Northwest Mississippi Community College. 
She has won several awards in recent 
years, such as the 2010 President’s Volunteer 
Service Award, the 2013 Quitman County 
Alumni Scholarship Gala Award, the Commu-
nity Foundation of Northwest Mississippi’s 
2019 
Community 
Star 
Award, 
Margaret 
Madddox Woman of the Year and the 2020 
Mule Train Historical Society Woman of the 
Year. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Mrs. Judy Bland for her 
dedication to the teaching profession and her 
untiring efforts of volunteerism,

HONORING 
MICHAEL 
FINNEY’S 
30TH ANNIVERSARY WITH ABC7 
NEWS BAY AREA 
HON. MARK DeSAULNIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 5, 2021 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the service of Michael 
Finney as he celebrates his 30th anniversary 
with ABC7 News Bay Area. 
Michael’s interest in journalism began as a 
child. While attending Ray Lyman Wilbur Jun-
ior High School in Palo Alto, California, Mi-
chael took a journalism class in which he did 
a story on bike thefts. His story contributed to 
the school’s decision to build a fence to pre-
vent any further thefts. Michael later graduated 
from California State University, Chico and 
went on to pursue a career in journalism. He 
worked at television stations in Idaho, Bakers-
field, and San Diego before returning to the 
Bay Area. 
Michael joined ABC7 News in 1991 and has 
since become known for his ‘‘7 On Your 
Side,’’ segments, which focus on consumer 
advocacy. The segments highlight Michael’s 
investigations into consumer complaints in-
cluding faulty products, suspicious business 
practices, and industry problems. Through this 
work, Michael has helped return millions of 
dollars to consumers and earned the trust and 
respect of the community. 
Michael’s work has not only made him a 
household name in the Bay Area, but has also 
earned him numerous accolades for his work 
in broadcast journalism. He has won an Emmy 
from the National Academy of Television Arts 
and Sciences and a Golden Mike, in addition

RECOGNIZING 
TAMPA’S 
HEALTH 
CARE HERO, DR. KEVIN SNEED, 
IN HONOR OF BLACK HISTORY 
MONTH 
HON. KATHY CASTOR 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 5, 2021 
Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Madam Speaker, 
in honor of Black History Month, I am cele-
brating Tampa’s health care heroes. I rise 
today in admiration and respect for the service 
and leadership of Dr. Kevin Sneed, a tenured 
professor and the founding dean of the Uni-
versity of South Florida (USF) College of 
Pharmacy. Born in 1968, he was raised in Or-
lando, FL. His parents were both public school 
teachers and were part of the initial wave of 
educators to desegregate Orange County pub-
lic schools. As a student at Edgewater High 
School, he was a shining star—senior class 
vice president, a member of the National 
Honor Society and a football and track athlete. 
He attended the University of Central Flor-
ida to earn his bachelor’s degree in biology 
with a concentration in microbiology. While it 
is apparent that he was drawn to the sciences, 
it was a significant illness while in college that 
furthered his appreciation for health care and 
inspired him to enter this field. Dr. Sneed then 
received his Doctor of Pharmacy degree from 
Xavier University of Louisiana College of Phar-
macy, where he received numerous clinical 
and leadership awards. He returned to Florida 
to complete an Ambulatory Care/Primary Care 
Pharmacy Practice Specialty Residency at 
Bay Pines Veteran’s Administration Medical 
Center. 
Prior to joining USF, Dr. Sneed was a fac-
ulty member at Florida A&M University Col-
lege of Pharmacy. He joined USF Health as 
assistant dean and then founded its College of 
Pharmacy, which this year will celebrate its 
10-year anniversary since welcoming its first 
charter class. In 2019, the College of Phar-
macy received a $10 million donation from the 
Taneja Family Foundation, marking a trans-
formational milestone for the young school 
and validating the innovative education experi-
ence that centers around the Primary Care 
Clinical Pharmacist, which trains pharmacists 
and physicians together. USF is a pioneer of 
this in Florida. 
One of Dr. Sneed’s research and clinical in-
terests is examining health care disparities. He 
regularly partners with organizations, such as 
the 
American 
Heart 
Association 
and 
REACHUP, Inc., to shine a light on these dis-
parities and improve health outcomes, and his 
efforts were more critical than ever this past 
year during the COVID–19 pandemic. During 
this time, Dr. Sneed has been dedicated to 
educating African American and Latino com-
munities 
on 
how 
to 
understand 
the 
coronavirus and prepare for the vaccine, while 
working with the medical research community 
to help ensure equitable distribution among 
communities of color. Black and Hispanic pop-
ulations that contract COVID–19 have a higher 
death rate by 2.8 times their white counter-
parts, according to the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention. The same dataset 
also demonstrates even higher hospitalization 
rates for Black and Hispanic populations. Dr. 
Sneed’s efforts surely will save lives. 
Dr. Sneed is active in national and state or-
ganizations, among which include the Amer-
ican Heart Association, Association of Black 
Cardiologists, National Pharmaceutical Asso-
ciation, American Society of Health-System 
Pharmacists, American Association of Col-
leges of Pharmacy, Florida Pharmacy Asso-
ciation, Florida Society of Health-System Phar-
macists, Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc, and 
Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity. His work has been 
published in numerous peer-reviewed journals, 
book chapters, abstracts, poster presentations, 
and he has participated in multiple federal and 
industry sponsored grant projects. Notably, Dr. 
Sneed served as a site principal investigator 
and co-investigator on medication clinical 
trials. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of a grateful na-
tion in the midst of a public health crisis and 
the Tampa Bay community, I am proud to rec-
ognize the service and leadership of Dr. Kevin 
Sneed, and his audacious, inspiring vision to 
transform health care in a way that empowers 
the clinician, but more importantly, the patient.

IN RECOGNITION OF CHRISTOPHER 
JOHN KURBEL’S 100TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 5, 2021 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Christopher John Kurbel of 
Dearborn on the occasion of his 100th Birth-
day. His contributions to our community and to 
our nation are worthy of commendation. 
The son of immigrants from Austria and 
Germany, Mr. Kurbel was born and raised in 
Detroit, Michigan as the youngest of four chil-
dren. He met his wife, wife Evelyn Mae 
Stirbrny when the family moved to Lincoln 
Park, Michigan. 
Mr. Kurbel joined the United States Army in 
1942 during World War II. He was a member 
of the 34th Infantry Division, serving as 3rd 
Platoon squad leader; 135th Regiment; Com-
pany; Private First Class. He was first sta-
tioned in Africa and later shipped to Italy, and 
other parts of Europe. His last battle was the 
victory of the complete surrender of the Ger-
man 34th Division on May 1, 1945. He was 
awarded two bronze medals and a Good Con-
duct Award for his service to our nation which 
ended in 1945. 
After his duties ended, he returned to Michi-
gan, working various jobs before ending up at 
McLean Trucking, where he remained for thirty 
years until his retirement. Before her passing 
in 2017, Mr. and Mrs. Kurbel were married for 
nearly seventy years and together they have 
seven children, thirteen grandchildren, and six 
great grandchildren. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Christopher John Kurbel on his 
100th Birthday. He has honorably served this 
country through his exemplary military service 
during World War II. I join with Mr. Kurbel’s 
family and friends in extending my best wishes 
to him on his birthday.

Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a tenacious and 
ambitious man Mr. Deonta Selvy, Sr. Selvy 
has shown what can be done through hard 
work, dedication, and a desire to make a dif-

sity. 
Apart from being a great businessman, 
Selvy is known for his love of sports and 
teaching kids the fundamentals of the games. 
Selvy has been a volunteer football and bas-
ketball coach for the last 15 years and has 
mentored hundreds of kids through the years.

HONORING THE LIFE OF JOHN 
KNOX 
HON. MARK DeSAULNIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 5, 2021 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the life of John Knox. 
John was raised in Richmond, California, 
where he attended John F. Kennedy High 
School. He graduated from the University of 
California, Berkeley and went on to obtain a 
Juris Doctorate from Berkeley Law in 1987. 
After completing his education, John began 
working as an attorney at Orrick and dedi-
cated himself to his career as a public finance 
lawyer. 
After six years, John was promoted to part-
ner. He mastered the technical aspects of 
being a lawyer, but also understood the impor-
tance of developing strong business relation-
ships. John built a local government practice 
throughout 
the 
Bay 
Area, 
which 
he 
transitioned to a municipal restructuring prac-
tice. John and his law partner guided cities 
through bankruptcy with John handling the 
public financing and restructuring of debt. In 
2012, John and his partner helped Stockton, 
CA file for bankruptcy protection, which was 
the largest U.S. city bankruptcy filing that year. 
This work with cities earned them recognition 
as ‘‘Attorneys of the Year’’ by California Law-
yer magazine in 2013. John received this 
same recognition, known as the CLAY award, 
in 2005 and 2017. In addition to this work, it 
was also John’s idea to use Social Impact 
Bonds to revitalize distressed properties in 
Richmond and transition them to those in 
need of affordable housing. 
In his personal life, John met his future wife, 
Aracely, in high school when they were 
partnered for a class project. John and 
Aracely married in 1981 and had four children. 
John also had a love of music, especially jazz, 
which he developed during childhood when he 
started playing piano. As a teenager and 
young adult, John played music professionally 
as part of a band. His friends and family re-
member his piano playing as effortless and al-
ways drawing a crowd. 
Sadly, John passed away in February at the 
age of 64. Please join me in honoring John for 
his many contributions to our community.

Monday, April 5, 2021 
Mr. RUIZ. Madam Speaker, I rise to cele-
brate the life of my constituent, Faustino 
‘‘Tino’’ Armenta. A United States Marines vet-
eran who served his country honorably, Tino 
was a remarkable member of our community 
who shared a passion for public service, edu-
cation, and his vintage 1953 Bel Air. 
From a young age, Tino demonstrated his 
courage and love of country when he earned 
his Eagle Scout badge in high school. Upon 
his graduation, he enlisted in the U.S. Marine 
Corps and served our country as a chemical, 
atomic, and biological warfare Non-Commis-
sioned Officer Instructor. 
Tino was a lifelong learner who believed in 
the power of education. After discharge from 
the Marines, he obtained his MBA and Ph.D. 
in international business and traveled across 
the country as he pursued a thriving business 
career. Over the course of his career, Tino in-
spired countless others. In his uplifting biog-
raphy, ‘‘Los Hijos de Orozco,’’ he traced his 
families’ history and their pursuit of the Amer-
ican Dream. 
After his retirement, Tino spread his love of 
learning to others through his community in-
volvement. He volunteered with various orga-
nizations that provide educational resources to 
low-income children in the community. He 
even traveled to Peru to teach children in the 
countryside how to read and write in English. 
His passion for education now lives on in his 
children, Juan and Cris, who both obtained 
their doctorates and practice law in Rancho 
Mirage and San Diego. 
For many years, Tino remained engaged in 
his community by lending a hand and men-
toring young people. He was always willing to 
help those in need—even if it meant donning 
a Santa Claus or elf costume to pass out pre-
sents to local children. 
Tino was not only a dear member of the 
community but also a dear person to me. I 
mourn his loss with his loved ones, his wife 
Nora, children Juan and Cris, and all his won-
derful grandchildren and great-grandchildren— 
who will no doubt—carry on his legacy for 
generations to come.

CHLOE CLEVELAND 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 5, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud Chloe Cleve-
land for receiving the Arvada Wheat Ridge 
Service Ambassadors for Youth award. 
Chloe Cleveland is a student at Oberon 
Middle School and received this award be-
cause her determination and hard work have 
allowed her to overcome adversities. 
The dedication demonstrated by Chloe 
Cleveland is exemplary of the type of achieve-
ment that can be attained with hard work and 
perseverance. It is essential students at all 
levels strive to make the most of their edu-
cation and develop a work ethic which will 
guide them for the rest of their lives. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to 
Chloe Cleveland for winning the Arvada 
Wheat Ridge Service Ambassador for Youth 
award. I have no doubt she will exhibit the 
same dedication and character in all of her fu-
ture accomplishments. 
RECOGNIZING 
TAMPA’S 
HEALTH 
CARE HERO, DR. PATRICK EM-
MANUEL VINCENT, IN HONOR OF 
BLACK HISTORY MONTH 
HON. KATHY CASTOR 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 5, 2021 
Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Madam Speaker, 
in honor of Black History Month, I am cele-
brating Tampa’s health care heroes. Today I 
rise in immense gratitude for the life of service 
of retired pastor, Dr. Patrick Emmanuel Vin-
cent, who because of his vision and leader-
ship, approximately 1,500 of our neighbors of 
the East Tampa community have a medical 
home and access to free health care through 
the Calvary Community Clinic. Born in 1948 in 
the southeasterly Caribbean islands of Trini-
dad and Tobago, our community is fortunate 
that for the past nearly 20 years he has called 
Tampa Bay his home and for his pastoral 
service leading the congregation of Mount Cal-
vary Seventh Day Adventist (SDA) Church 
since 2001 until his retirement in 2016. 
Dr. Vincent always wanted to be a minister 
of the gospel as far back as he could recall. 
He started his preparation for ministry at the 
University of the Southern Caribbean in 
Maracas Valley, a few miles northeast of his 
childhood 
home. 
He 
then 
moved 
to 
Mandeville, Jamaica to complete his bach-
elor’s degree at the Northern Caribbean Uni-
versity. He graduated with a master’s degree 
in Divinity from the SDA Theological Seminary 
at Andrews University in Michigan. He com-
pleted his Doctor of Ministry degree at Van-
derbilt University Divinity School. His pastoral 
ministry took him to Nashville and Chat-
tanooga, TN, as well as Birmingham, AL and 
Orlando, FL. He became a renowned church 
builder and church growth specialist. As the 
senior pastor of Mount Calvary SDA Church in 
Tampa, Dr. Vincent led his congregation into 
their beautiful new sanctuary and recon-
structed the church’s school. 
But Dr. Vincent’s vision went beyond serv-
ing the congregation of his church. He led a 
survey within the East Tampa community 
where his church is located to determine the 
most critical need. In response to the growing 
uninsured population in this area, the Calvary 
Community Clinic was established in 2015 to 
provide quality, compassionate health care. 
Dr. Vincent raised funding through Mount Cal-
vary Church endowments and membership 
contributions, community initiatives, donations 
from corporations as well as grants. Today, 
Dr. Vincent serves as the chair of the Board 
of Directors for the clinic and a volunteer staff 
of certified physicians, physicians assistants, 
nurse practitioners, nurses, pharmacists, coun-
selors, social workers, and clerical and sup-
port personnel provide free healthcare and 
health education services to the uninsured, 
underserved and working poor individuals and 
families of East Tampa and Hillsborough 
County. 
Dr. Vincent is happily married to Judy Wil-
liams and together, they have committed their 
lives in service to God and their neighbors. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of a grateful na-
tion and Tampa Bay community, I am proud to 
recognize Dr. Patrick Emmanuel Vincent, and 
his lifetime of servant leadership, spiritual 
guidance and his entrepreneurial spirit to uplift

CELEBRATING 70 YEARS OF AUTO-
MOTIVE COLOR & SUPPLY CORP. 
HON. JIM BANKS 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 5, 2021 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
congratulate northeast Indiana-based auto-
motive and industrial paint supplier and dis-
tributor Automotive Color & Supply Corpora-
tion for 70 years of business. 
Richard Byers Sr. acquired part ownership 
of the company and began to operate the 
business shortly after its founding in 1951. 
Richard attained full ownership of the com-
pany in 1970, and the Byers family has owned 
and operated Automotive Color as a family 
business since. 
Automotive Color has established itself as 
one of the leading automotive and industrial 
paint and supply distributors not just in the 
Midwest but throughout the United States. 
Paint from Automotive Color is used on race 
cars, commercial and private aircraft, space-
craft, ocean vessels, movies and TV show 
sets, and more. 
At a time when American industry is in con-
valescence from the coronavirus pandemic, 
this historic milestone is even more extraor-
dinary. 
Hoosiers are thankful for and proud of Auto-
motive Colors’ contributions to northeast Indi-
ana and the country. This record is testament 
to the exceptional service and quality they 
have provided, and will continue to provide, for 
generations.

RECOGNIZING THE REPUBLIC OF 
KOREA’S 
COMMENDABLE 
RE-
SPONSE TO COVID–19 
HON. BILL PASCRELL, JR. 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 5, 2021 
Mr. PASCRELL. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize and commend our ally South Ko-
rea’s response to the COVID–19 pandemic. 
Under the leadership of President Moon Jae- 
in and Prime Minister Chung Sye-Kyun, who 
took office just prior to the World Health Orga-
nization’s declaration of a pandemic, the Re-
public of Korea’s response to COVID–19 
should be applauded. 
I am proud to represent one of the most vi-
brant Korean American communities in the na-
tion in the Ninth District of New Jersey. Ko-
rean Americans have contributed greatly to 
North Jersey and to our nation in myriad 
ways, from business and science, to sports, 
the arts, and public service. I share the pride 
of many Korean Americans across our country 
and the Ninth District in South Korea’s re-
sponse to the pandemic. 
From the outset of the pandemic, the Re-
public of Korea engaged in a coordinated na-
tional strategy to control viral spread. This in-
cluded reactivating contact tracing tools last 
used to combat the 2012 Middle East Res-
piratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak, which al-
lowed South Korea to rapidly collect and ana-
lyze real-time data on COVID–19 cases. 
Equipped with an effective tracing program, 
South 
Korea 
quickly 
made 
use 
of 
a 
smartphone application to help ensure compli-
ance with isolation or quarantine following ex-
posure to the virus. 
Critically, the Republic of Korea made a 
concerted and early effort to provide accurate 
information on the COVID–19 pandemic to the 
general public. From the very first reported 
cases in the country, South Korea ensured its 
citizens knew to social distance, practice good 
hygiene, and wear a mask in public. 
Together, these measures led to the Repub-
lic of Korea’s notably low infection and death 
counts over the past year, despite being one 
of the first nations to experience recorded 
cases. 
In the 73 years since the founding of the 
Republic of Korea, our two nations have en-
joyed a powerful and enduring alliance, 
marked by a shared belief in the values of de-
mocracy and freedom. 
I have always been deeply dedicated to up-
holding our commitment to the security and 
defense of the Republic of Korea, who con-
tinue to serve as one of our most valued eco-
nomic and strategic partners. I sincerely hope 
the bonds that tie our two nations will only 
grow stronger as we continue to collaborate 
on the many issues that face us, including 
quashing COVID–19 with science, good gov-
ernance, and effective communication. On that 
task, the world ought to look to the Republic 
of Korea as a role model.

CORA FORRESTER 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER

Monday, April 5, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today 
to 
recognize 
and 
applaud 
Cora 
Forrester for receiving the Arvada Wheat 
Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth award. 
Cora Forrester is a student at Wayne Carle 
M.S. and received this award because her de-
termination and hard work have allowed her to

The 
dedication 
demonstrated 
by 
Cora

ment that can be attained with hard work and

I extend my deepest congratulations to Cora 
Forrester for winning the Arvada Wheat Ridge 
Service Ambassador for Youth award. I have 
no doubt she will exhibit the same dedication 
and character in all of her future accomplish-
ments.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 5, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam

organization, CompuRecycling Center, Inc.

CompuRecycling Center, Inc. is a 501c3

the Director. It is also comprised of five Board

ference in the community.

HONORING SUE ELLEN ALLEN 
HON. GREG STANTON 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 5, 2021 
Mr. STANTON. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor the life and legacy of Sue Ellen Allen, 
who passed away on February 24, 2021. A 
woman whose fiery passion matched her red 
hair, Sue Ellen was a fearless champion for 
criminal justice reform in Arizona and across 
the nation—guided by her steadfast belief that 
everyone deserved a second chance. She 
loved fiercely, and her infectious southern 
charm brought light to every room she en-
tered. Sue Ellen’s story is an inspiration to us 
all, and Arizona is a better place for her pres-
ence among us. 
She lived many lives as an educator, busi-
ness owner, community leader, and as a 
former inmate at Arizona State Prison. Sue 
Ellen put it best, she was a ‘‘contradiction in 
terms.’’ It was during her time as an inmate 
when she encountered systemic inequities and 
became acutely aware of the hardships faced 
for those behind bars. Her cell mate, Gina— 
despite many pleas for medical attention— 
died of leukemia. This loss altered the course 
of Sue Ellen’s life and inspired her to fight not 
only for her own reentry into society, but for all 
those formerly incarcerated, especially girls 
and women.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks

April 5, 2021 
When talking about her experience, Sue 
Ellen used to say, ‘‘Being released from prison 
is like being shot out of a cannon naked into 
a brick wall.’’ Even through hardship, she 
never lost her sense of humor. Upon her re-
lease, she authored ‘‘The Slumber Party from 
Hell’’ detailing her time in prison. She then 
founded the nonprofit organization ReInventing 
ReEntry to educate and reshape society’s per-
ception of former inmates to help them re-
integrate and give them a fair shot for employ-
ment, housing, education, and entrepreneurial 
opportunities—without shame or stigma. 
Sue Ellen courageously chose to confront 
and relive these challenges with hope that she 
could help others see their purpose and po-
tential again. She visited prisons and detention 
centers to tell her story and prepare women 
and girls for life inside and after reentry. She 
would talk to anyone who listened, from 
judges and elected officials—even President 
Barack Obama. For her seminal leadership on 
criminal justice issues, she joined First Lady 
Michelle Obama as a guest of honor for the 
President’s final State of the Union address. 
Sue Ellen saw life as a grand adventure and 
moved mountains to inspire hope in those she 
saw herself in. We owe her a debt of gratitude 
and are thankful we bore witness to her life’s 
work in Arizona and across the nation. She in-
spired many Arizonans to seek justice, treat 
others with the dignity and respect they de-
serve, and to keep up the good fight. 
In this spirit of remembrance, I rise to honor 
the tremendous life and legacy of Sue Ellen 
Allen. I thank Sue Ellen, and wish her God-
speed.

REMEMBERING JANE SA´ NCHEZ 
HON. TIM RYAN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 5, 2021 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Jane Sa´nchez, Deputy Librar-
ian for Library Collections and Services and 
the 25th Law Librarian of Congress, who 
passed away on March 26, 2021 after a cou-
rageous battle with cancer. 
Appointed as Law Librarian of Congress on 
February 6, 2017, Jane managed the oper-
ation and policy administration for the Law Li-
brary of Congress, the world’s largest collec-
tion of legal materials. Then, in June 2019, 
Ms. Sa´nchez was also appointed Deputy Li-
brarian for the newly formed Library Collec-
tions and Services Group (LCSG). Here, Jane 
was instrumental in helping to bring together 
the three units responsible for acquiring, 
stewarding, describing and serving library col-
lections. 
Prior to the Law Library, Jane had been 
Chief of Humanities and Social Sciences 
(HSS) since October 2014. HSS provided re-
search service in the Library’s Main Reading 
Room, the Local History and Genealogy sec-
tion, the Digital Reference Team and the 
Microform and Electronic Resources Center. 
Under her leadership, services to researchers 
expanded which led to a more robust use of 
the collections and services. 
Ms. Sa´nchez had also served as a business 
unit Managing Director at the U.S. Govern-
ment Publishing Office; as an associate direc-
tor of Justice Libraries, Justice Management 
Division, U.S. Department of Justice; as de-
partmental head of History & Culture Libraries 
at the Smithsonian Institution Libraries; and as 
an acquisitions manager for electronic data-
bases at BNA, Inc. 
Jane had been the recipient of numerous 
awards over the course of her career, includ-
ing from the U.S. Department of Energy for 
sustained superior service and from the Jus-
tice Management Division and the Smithso-
nian Institution for workflow improvements. 
Jane Sa´nchez held a Juris Doctorate from 
American University’s Washington College of 
Law, a Master’s of Library Science from Sim-
mons College in Boston and a Bachelor of 
Arts in English from the University of New 
Mexico, Albuquerque, New Mexico. 
As chairman of the Legislative Branch Ap-
propriations Subcommittee, I had the pleasure 
of working with Jane during the appropriations 
process for the Library. Anyone who has 
worked with Jane would describe her as a 
strong leader who will be remembered for her 
calming presence. Her passing is a great loss 
for not only her family and friends, but also for 
the Library of Congress. I thank Jane for her 
great service to Congress, the Library, and the 
American people. My deepest sympathies go 
out to Jane’s colleagues, and especially her 
husband, Christopher, and her three children, 
Adam, Andrew, and Alyson.

HONORING DR. KALANYA MOORE 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 5, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable 
individual, Dr. Kalanya Moore. 
Kalanya Moore serves as Assistant Pro-
fessor and Director of Field Experiences and 
Clinical Practices and School District Partner-
ship Liaison for the Teacher Education Council 
Departmental Governing Board in the Teacher 
Education Department at Mississippi Valley 
State University. She collaborates with District 
Superintendents, District and Building-Level 
Administration, Cooperating Teachers, and 
MVSU University Content Area Supervising 
Educators in the Elementary and Secondary 
Area Departments to develop and maintain re-
lationships that lead to quality field experi-
ences for Teacher Candidates at both the un-
dergraduate and graduate levels. Dr. Moore 
has also served as Teacher Education Depart-
ment Acting Chair and Coordinator of the 
Master of Arts in Teaching (Certification) Pro-
gram. 
She monitors the adherence of the MVSU 
Education Preparation Program to the Mis-
sissippi Department of Education certification 
guidelines for field experiences, student teach-
ing, and graduate internships. Prior to joining 
higher education full-time, she obtained 15 
years of P–12 experience. Her work experi-
ences include Pre-Kindergarten and Kinder-
garten teacher, District Instructional Cur-
riculum Coach (K–6), Adjunct Professor of On- 
Ground and Online Universities, Child Devel-
opment Center Director, and Educational Con-
sultant to HBCU Master of Arts in Teaching

Development Specialist (PDS) for the Council 
for Professional Recognition-Child Develop-
ment Associate (CDA) and Consultant to MS 
Head Start Agencies, Preschool Programs, 
and School District Career and Technical Edu-
cation (CTE) programs in the state. 
Her Spiritual Mantra derives from Galatians 
6:9—Let us not become weary in well-doing, 
for in due season we shall reap, if we faint 
not; and II Corinthians 5:7—For we walk by 
faith, not by sight. Her life’s most pivotal role 
is being wife of Mr. Reginald Moore of Green-
wood, MS, and the mother of Reginald II and 
Jordan Moore. 
Dr. Moore serves as a mentor, advocate 
and ‘‘voice’’ to student education candidates, 
early career educators and those seeking 
guidance into the education profession. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Dr. Kalanya Moore for her 
dedication to education and commitment to 
our community.

Over the past year they have faced chal-

have shown incredible resolve in the face of 
adversity. They have shown us all how to 
seek positivity and hope in each day as we 
weather the storms that come our way. 
I couldn’t be more thankful to represent the 
incredible people across South Dakota and all 
over the nation who work hard each day, not 
for fame, not for recognition or for money, but 
for the betterment of their communities. This is 
what makes America strong. I am grateful for 
the opportunity to recognize these hard-
working individuals.

TEACHING ASIAN PACIFIC 
AMERICAN HISTORY ACT 
HON. GRACE MENG 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 5, 2021 
Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, throughout 
this pandemic, Asian Americans have been 
facing a second virus—that of hate and dis-
crimination. In fact, since the beginning of the 
pandemic, hate incidents against Asian Ameri-
cans have skyrocketed 150 percent. Our com-
munity is being scapegoated for the COVID– 
19 pandemic, and as a result, have been vic-
tim to the most hateful, cowardly, and des-
picable attacks. Our children and elderly espe-
cially are being ruthlessly under attack. There 
are nearly 4,000 reported incidents of Asian 
Americans being spat on, stabbed, verbally 
abused, beaten, slashed, and most recently 
murdered in a tragic and senseless mass 
shooting. Our parents are scared to leave their 
homes and walk down the street. Parents are 
scared to let their children go outside and play 
or to even go to school. 
Asian Americans, however, know this vio-
lence and racism directed at our community is 
not new. From the ‘‘yellow peril’’ scare of the 
1800s, which paved the way for the Page Act 
of 1875 and the Chinese Exclusion Act, to the 
unjust incarceration of the Japanese Ameri-
cans during World War II, our history includes 
shameful accounts of institutionalized discrimi-
nation and racism towards Asian Americans. 
Madam Speaker, since the 1700s, Asian 
Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPIs) have 
made immeasurable contributions to our na-
tion throughout its history. AAPIs have shaped 
the fabric of our country with contributions to 
our infrastructure, economy, and our military. 
Unfortunately, for generations, Asian Pacific 
American history has been poorly represented 
in our K–12 education system and social stud-
ies textbooks. This misrepresentation renders 
AAPIs invisible and leads to the perception 
that we are ‘‘forever foreigners.’’ 
In fact, growing up, I was never taught of 
the expansive contributions of Asian Ameri-
cans throughout our history. I barely learned 
about Chinese immigrants who built the trans-
continental railroad connecting the East and 
West Coasts. My history textbooks never 
taught that slaves built the U.S. Capitol, the 
very heart of our democracy. 
Madam Speaker, the gaps in our collective 
history prevent our nation from moving forward 
in in solidarity and allyship. We cannot create 
a shared future where all can achieve the 
American Dream unless we learn from our 
shared history. In this time of great misin-
formation and discrimination against Asian 
Americans, we need greater cultural aware-
ness and understanding of our community’s 
history within the foundations of our U.S. his-
tory. 
That is why I rise today to announce the re-
introduction of my Teaching Asian Pacific 
American Act to promote the teaching and 
learning of Asian Pacific American history in 
K–12 schools. Specifically, my bill would re-
quire Presidential and Congressional Acad-
emies’ grant applicants and recipients to in-
clude Asian Pacific American history as part of 
their history and civics programs offered to 
students and teachers. Furthermore, it would 
encourage the inclusion of Asian Pacific Amer-
ican history within national and state tests ad-
ministered through the National Assessment of 
Educational Progress and promote collabora-
tion with the Smithsonian Institution’s Asian 
Pacific American Center to develop innovating 
programming. 
Madam Speaker, in order to create a shared 
future for all Americans, we have to learn from 
the mistakes of our past. I thank my col-
leagues who have joined me in this critical 
legislation, and I urge its swift passage so that 
our nation can move forward in healing.

DANIEL ROSALES 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 5, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud Daniel 
Rosales for receiving the Arvada Wheat Ridge 
Service Ambassadors for Youth award. 
Daniel Rosales is a student at Arvada K–8 
and received this award because his deter-
mination and hard work have allowed him to 
overcome adversities. 
The dedication demonstrated by Daniel 
Rosales is exemplary of the type of achieve-
ment that can be attained with hard work and 
perseverance. It is essential students at all 
levels strive to make the most of their edu-
cation and develop a work ethic which will 
guide them for the rest of their lives. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to Dan-
iel Rosales for winning the Arvada Wheat 
Ridge Service Ambassador for Youth award. I 
have no doubt he will exhibit the same dedica-
tion and character in all of his future accom-
plishments.

Monday, April 5, 2021

as a doctor in Jefferson County, Mississippi 
for over 50 years. Dr. Pandey recently retired 
in 2020, came to the Jefferson County area in 
1969, accompanying her late husband, Dr. 
Tiwari, Ph.D., who accepted a job offer in the 
Department of Agriculture at Alcorn State Uni-
versity. Taking the advice of Dr. Tiwari’s asso-
ciates, Dr. Pandey considered Jefferson Coun-
ty, particularly Fayette and set up practice in 
June 1970. 
Dr. Pandey who is now around 85 years 
old, began her practice in Fayette on Harrison 
Street. A number of years later, she built the 
Arbind Clinic on South Main Street, directly 
across from Jefferson County Hospital. This 
site remained the home of her practice until 
her recent retirement. 
Dr. Pandey, a native of India, graduated 
from Panta Medical College in 1958 and com-
pleted her internship in 1960. She began prac-
ticing medicine in her native country but soon 
came to America with her husband who 
worked on a terminal degree at the University 
of Georgia. 
Dr. Pandey began her practice in America 
at 
the 
Central 
State 
Hospital 
at 
the 
Milledgeville, Georgia, beginning in December 
1967. She left Central State Hospital in 
Milledgeville and moved to Alcorn State on 
September 1, 1969. 
Dr. Pandey falls into a unique and illustrious 
group of doctors who have placed dedication 
and service at the top of their agendas. Dr. 
Pandey’s walls are filled with certificates that 
attest to her endowments. One special certifi-
cate that many doctors do not receive reads 
that Dr. Pandey was inducted into the 50-Year 
Club by the American Medical Association in 
2008. Another certificate attests to her attain-
ment as Board Certified in Family Medicine. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the life, legacy, and service of 
Dr. Shanti Pandey.

HONORING THE LIFE OF DR. 
DENNIS DEPERRO 
HON. JOHN KATKO 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 5, 2021 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Dr. Dennis DePerro, who 
passed away on March 1, 2021. Dr. DePerro 
was a champion of higher education, dedi-
cating his life to helping students realize their 
full potential at universities and colleges 
across New York State. 
Since 2017, Dr. DePerro had served as 
President of St. Bonaventure University in Al-
legany, New York. In just four short years, Dr. 
DePerro established himself as a forward 
thinking and compassionate leader who cared 
deeply about the students, faculty, and staff 
he served. As President of St. Bonaventure, 
he expanded school enrollment, embraced 
new academic programs, and improved ac-
cess to online learning. 
To those who were familiar with Dr. 
DePerro’s 
work, 
his 
success 
at 
St. 
Bonaventure was no surprise. For eighteen 
years, he accomplished similar feats in my 
district in Central New York as Vice President 
for Enrollment at Le Moyne College and 
played a key role in bettering the college and 
advancing its core mission. Central New York 
is immensely grateful to Dr. DePerro for his 
many contributions to our community. 
Beyond his astounding work in higher edu-
cation, Dr. DePerro enjoyed nothing more than 
spending time with his wife, Sherry, and two 
sons, Andrew and Matt. His memory lives on 
through his family and friends. We join all who 
knew and admired Dr. DePerro in mourning 
his life. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the 
House join me in honoring Dr. Dennis 
DePerro. Throughout his career, Dr. DePerro 
touched many lives and was a blessing to the 
students, universities and colleges, and com-
munities he served. The passion and commit-
ment he espoused is an inspiration to us all, 
and he leaves behind a lasting legacy of work 
that will continue to positively impact students 
in Upstate New York.

REMEMBERING ALFREDO 
SANDOVAL 
HON. RAUL RUIZ 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 5, 2021 
Mr. RUIZ. Madam Speaker, I rise to cele-
brate the life of my constituent, Alfredo 
Sandoval. 
Alfredo—or the ‘‘Chief’’ as his kids lovingly 
nicknamed him—was a decorated combat vet-
eran, a loving father, and a mentor to many. 
When Alfredo enlisted in the United States 
Air Force in 1954, he began a career that took 
him across the country and around the world. 
With his wife, Elena, by his side, Alfredo trav-
eled from Brawley, California to Savannah, 
Georgia to Tokyo to Naples and countless 
other cities in service to our country. 
After returning home to the United States in 
1968, he was called on to serve in Vietnam. 
There, he earned a Bronze Star for his valor 
in the field. As a member of the First Mobile 
Communications Group, he received a Presi-
dential Unit Citation, 23 Air Force Outstanding 
Unit Awards, and a Navy Meritorious Unit Ci-
tation. 
Alfredo broke down barriers in the Air Force. 
When he retired in 1984, he had achieved the 
rank of Chief Master Sergeant. Alfredo truly 
paved the way for future generations of His-
panic men and women who followed in his 
footsteps to become Air Force Officers. Our 
nation owes him a tremendous debt. 
Even in retirement, Alfredo continued to up-
lift and inspire. His family saw him as a man 
who led by example and helped them find 
their way in this world. In the words of his 
granddaughter, ‘‘Every time I spoke to him, he 
would call me his number one. Even when I 
felt lost . . . he told me to have confidence in 
who I was and where I was going.’’ As Alfredo 
joins his beloved Elena in Heaven, his spirit 
will continue to guide his children and grand-
children through life. 
Alfredo is survived by his children, Alfredo 
A. Sandoval and Ruben E. Sandoval. His 
story of service and love of country is re-
corded in the United States Air Force and Air 
Force Association’s archives, and now, his life 
story is recorded in our nation’s history. 
Today, we close his chapter in our history just 
as his son, Alfredo, would say, ‘‘Fly safe, 
Chief.’’ 
MARY IDA OLIVER 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 5, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Mary Ida Oliver (Buccola) 
of Westminster, Colorado who will turn 95 on 
April 22, 2021. 
Mary Ida was born on April 22, 1926 in 
Sopris, Colorado. Her childhood was spent as 
a true ‘‘coal miner’s daughter.’’ In her teen 
years she sold WWII war bonds and spent 
time as Rosie the UN-riveter. 
Mary Ida married the love of her life, A.T. 
‘‘Bud’’ Oliver, a WWII pilot. They have been 
together for over 73 years and have five chil-
dren, five grandchildren and two great grand-
children. 
Mary Ida is a devoted wife and loving moth-
er, grandmother and great grandmother. She 
is also a true Coloradan, living in this great 
state for her entire life. She is also an avid fan 
of both the Denver Broncos and Colorado 
Rockies. 
Celebrating ninety-five years is a tremen-
dous milestone and should be celebrated. It is 
my privilege to wish Mary Ida a very happy 
birthday and wish her all the best in the future.

HONORING MRS. MAOTHA 
ANDERSON MCDANIEL ROBINSON 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 5, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable 
hero, Mrs. Maotha Anderson McDaniel Robin-
son. 
Mrs. Maotha Anderson McDaniel Robinson 
was born January 29, 1920, in Avon, Mis-
sissippi. On Friday, January 29, 2021, a pre-
cious gift of life and love, celebrated her 101st 
birthday with her family and friends. 
From her humble beginnings in rural Bolivar 
and Sunflower Counties, Mrs. Robinson, along 
with her brother and sister, were raised on a 
system of integrity premised on the tenets of 
love, kindness and compassion imparted by 
their parents. Her parents focus was to instill 
a central moral compass that echoed the heart 
of the Good Samaritan and core ethical values 
encompassed in the importance of work, fam-
ily, community and the love of God. Known for 
her kindness and willingness to assist others, 
Mrs. Robinson has devoted most of her life as 
the matriarch, not only of her family, but of her 
community as well as the oldest living female 
resident of the City of Shaw, Mississippi. 
Mrs. Robinson is a God-fearing Christian, a 
devoted wife and nurturing mother of eight 
children. She is the living embodiment of a 
woman of Proverbs 31:10. She is a woman 
after God’s own heart, committed to her faith, 
her family and her friends. Her faithful mem-
bership of Poplar Grove Baptist Church and 
as a dedicated member of the Heroines of 
Jericho, has shown her as an upstanding pillar 
in the community. 
Mrs. Robinson remains the archetype icon 
and central foundation of a family that retains 
an unbreakable bond of love, honor, devotion,

commitment and encouragement for each 
generation. She continues to be a blessing to 
others through her impartation words of Chris-
tian advice and wise counsel to those in her 
company as a reminder of God’s unfailing love 
for us all, and continues to enjoy the affection, 
appreciation, encouragement, love and re-
spect. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Mrs. Maotha Anderson 
McDaniel Robinson for her dedication to serv-
ing her family, community, and state.

RECOGNIZING 
TAMPA’S 
HEALTH 
CARE HERO, DR. DANA DARIEN 
GLENN, 
IN 
HONOR 
OF 
BLACK 
HISTORY MONTH 
HON. KATHY CASTOR 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 5, 2021 
Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Madam Speaker, 
in honor of Black History Month, I am cele-
brating Tampa’s health care heroes. Today I 
rise in admiration and respect for the public 
service and leadership of Dr. Dana Darien 
Glenn, who proudly serves our Veterans as 
Women’s Center Medical Director at the 
James A. Haley Veterans (VA) Hospitals and 
Clinics in Tampa, FL. Born in Pittsburgh, PA, 
in 1966, she relocated to Tampa in 1972 with 
her family. Her own father, Dr. Glinton Darien, 
served as a full-time staff dentist at the James 
A. Haley VA Hospital. Dr. Glenn has followed 
in his footsteps to serve our Veterans. Dr. 
Glenn was also influenced by her mother, who 
is a retired registered nurse. While Dr. Glenn 
has always had a passion for science and 
math, building a sense of community for her 
patients started at a young age when she 
would accompany her father, a deacon, as he 
visited the ill and shut-ins. 
The youngest of three children, she at-
tended Hillsborough County Public Schools, 
graduating with honors from Leto High School. 
She then earned her associate’s degree and 
graduated with honors from Hillsborough Com-
munity College. She completed her bachelor’s 
degree with honors from the University of Flor-
ida in 1988 and her Doctor of Medicine degree 
from the University of North Carolina, Chapel 
Hill School of Medicine in 1993. She returned 
to Florida to complete the Bayfront Medical 
Center Family Practice Program. In Tampa, 
she met and married the love of her life, 
Vernon Glenn, where they live with their two 
children, Alana and Theodore. 
Prior to joining James A. Haley VA Hospital, 
Dr. Glenn was a private practitioner for 10 
years in Tampa. Part of that time she ran a 
practice, Glenn Family Health Center, with her 
husband. Her sense of community transitioned 
her from private practice to joining the James 
A. Haley VA Hospital as a full-time staff physi-
cian in 2005. She was inspired by the hos-
pital’s patient-aligned care team and less than 
10 years later, she would become part of the 
planning team to open a center solely dedi-
cated to women veterans healthcare, including 
equipment, supplies and space to ensure gen-
der-specific care. The United States has more 
than 2 million women veterans, and the num-
ber of women using VA health services has 
more than tripled over the last 20 years. VA 
hospitals across the nation are adapting to 
serve the changing demographic—Dr. Glenn 
is part of this history of transition. The James 
A. Haley VA Hospital currently serves approxi-
mately 12,000 female Veterans. 
Dr. Glenn is board certified by the American 
Board of Family Medicine and she is a mem-
ber of the American Medical Association. Her 
list of past awards and honors include Finalist 
for VA Woman of the Year Award, Young 
Leader Award by the Florida Academy of 
Family Physicians, Charles Aucremann Art of 
Medicine Award, M.A. Barton Award for Best 
Medical Paper, Outstanding Presentation, Re-
search Day, and Commonwealth Fund/Bristol- 
Myers Squibb Fellowship in Academic Re-
search. Her professional and community serv-
ices include: VA National Women’s Health 
Services Mini-Residency Faculty participating 
in national and local lectures to train women’s 
health staff as well as Affiliate Assistant Pro-
fessor at USF Health Morsani College of Med-
icine teaching internal medicine residents. She 
has been a volunteer speaker at numerous 
church-based community health programs fo-
cusing on women’s health issues. 
Dr. Glenn is passionate about helping peo-
ple achieve their highest level of health and 
wellness. She is especially encouraged about 
opportunities to effectuate positive changes in 
the African American community disproportion-
ately affected by the COVID–19 pandemic and 
in multiple chronic disease/health outcome 
measures as well as underrepresented in 
leadership roles in medicine. 
Her personal mission statement is based on 
her favorite Bible verse, Galatians 2:20: ‘‘I 
have been crucified with Christ; and it is no 
longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and 
the life which I now live in the flesh I live by 
faith in the Son of God, who loved me and 
gave Himself up for me.’’ 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of a grateful na-
tion in the midst of a public health crisis and 
the Tampa Bay community, I am proud to rec-
ognize the service and leadership of Dr. Dana 
Glenn, as well as her eternal optimism guided 
by her personal faith.

award. I have no doubt he will exhibit the 
same dedication and character in all of his fu-
ture accomplishments.
