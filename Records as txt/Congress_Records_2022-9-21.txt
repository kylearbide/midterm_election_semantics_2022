Vol. 168 
WASHINGTON, WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 21, 2022 
No. 152 
House of Representatives 
The House met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the Speaker pro tem-

DESIGNATION OF SPEAKER PRO 
TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker: 
WASHINGTON, DC, 
September 21, 2022. 
I hereby appoint the Honorable HENRY 
CUELLAR to act as Speaker pro tempore on 
this day. 
NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House of Representatives. 
f 
MORNING-HOUR DEBATE

ant to the order of the House of Janu-
ary 10, 2022, the Chair will now recog-
nize Members from lists submitted by 
the majority and minority leaders for 
morning-hour debate. 
The Chair will alternate recognition 
between the parties, with time equally

NATIONAL VOTER REGISTRATION 
DAY, 2022 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
the Virgin Islands (Ms. PLASKETT) for 5 
minutes. 
Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, the 
right to vote is fundamental to our de-
mocracy. While the path to full voting 
rights for all American citizens has 
been and still is long and challenging, 
this week we honor the heroes who 
fought to secure this right by encour-
aging and supporting all eligible Amer-
icans to register to vote. 
This call to action would be incom-
plete if I did not mention the nearly 4 
million Americans living in U.S. terri-
tories and those in the District of Co-
lumbia who still do not have equal vot-
ing representation in this Congress and 
in our country. 
As such, Americans living in the ter-
ritories and the District of Columbia 
are accustomed to being last in line or 
given short shrift for hurricane relief, 
Medicaid, and infrastructure funding. 
We must remain committed to build-
ing an America where every vote mat-
ters and where every citizen has the 
ability and the right to participate 
freely in the democratic process. 
That is why I stand with House 
Democrats to continue to work on se-
curing the vote for all Americans. Our 
Nation depends on it. 
BETTER-PAYING JOBS 
Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to affirm my commitment to ex-
panding work opportunities to all cor-
ners of the country, including the often 
excluded territory of the Virgin Is-
lands. That means forming better-pay-
ing jobs and economic opportunities so 
Americans can work and live with dig-
nity and security. 
The Democratic Caucus has remained 
committed to people over politics in 
this with safer communities, better- 
paying jobs, and opportunities for all 
Americans. 
That is why they have supported and 
I support the three significant pieces of 
legislation that have been passed by 
House 
Democrats: 
the 
CHIPS 
and 
Science Act which provides billions of 
dollars in new funding to strengthen 
American research and development 
and rebuild our supply chain; the Infla-
tion Reduction Act which has stimu-
lated job growth through investments 
in clean, affordable, and secure Amer-
ican energy while simultaneously cut-
ting families’ energy bills and fighting 
the climate change; and, lastly, the In-
frastructure Investment and Jobs Act, 
let us not forget, which aims to rebuild 
our roads, bridges, and transit systems 
while bringing broadband and clean 
drinking water to more communities. 
BLACK WOMEN’S EQUAL PAY DAY 
Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to highlight the disparities that 
exist for Black women due to the dou-
ble-pronged existence of institutional 
racism and misogyny in our country. 
Black women bear the unique burden of 
experiencing both gender and racial 
discrimination. We have seen this in 
health, wealth, education, and work 
among all socioeconomic, geographic, 
and age groups. 
Black women earn 58 cents to the 
dollar of a White man—the same job, 
the same position—58 cents to the dol-
lar. Their earning gap is even more se-
vere for mothers, with Black mothers 
only earning 46 cents for every dollar a 
White, non-Hispanic father earned na-
tionally. 
It is imperative that we demand pay 
equity for Black women. So today, I 
stand with all of my sisters and de-
mand and implore my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle to support Black 
Women’s Equal Pay Day.

KANSAS CORN HARVEST REPORT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Kansas (Mr. MANN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. MANN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to deliver the 14th installment of my 
farm bill impact series during a time 
when the effects of a poor corn harvest 
in Kansas are only compounded by ris-
ing inflation. 
Kansas farmers are laboring under 
the burden of skyrocketing input costs 
while they work hard to keep our coun-
try fed, fueled, and clothed, and they 
deserve workable solutions to this in-
flation crisis before the situation gets 
any worse. Farming is already a risky, 
volatile business without the added 
burden of inflation, and USDA esti-
mates that input costs will continue to

September 21, 2022 
rise to astronomical rates throughout 
2022 and beyond. 
For an example of the risk of vola-
tility in farming, the corn harvest is 
underway in some parts of Kansas, and 
the results are a fraction of the yield 
that farmers hope for and bank on dur-
ing normal seasons. The farm bill 
which Congress will reauthorize in 2023 
exists, in part, specifically for situa-
tions like this current corn crop to pro-
vide energy assistance to our ag pro-
ducers 
even 
when 
Mother 
Nature 
doesn’t cooperate. 
The weather in Kansas can be ex-
treme and unpredictable, which means 
that growing corn can be a very dif-
ficult prospect. Kansas is suffering 
from a major drought right now. Ac-
cording to the USDA, for the week end-
ing September 11, only 14 percent of 
Kansas topsoil was rated as adequate. 
And USDA rated the corn condition 27 
percent very poor, 27 percent poor, 24 
percent fair, 20 percent good, and only 
2 percent excellent. Meanwhile, accord-
ing to Drought Monitor, 34 counties in 
my district alone are in extreme 
drought, and 16 are in exceptional 
drought. 
The farther west you go in Kansas, 
Mr. Speaker, the worse it gets. Even ir-
rigated fields are having issues, and far 
more corn crops than normal will be 
complete losses. Many Kansas pro-
ducers are saying that this is the worst 
corn harvest in recent memory. This is 
a dire situation. Farmers invest hun-
dreds of thousands of dollars in pro-
ducing this essential crop, and its fail-
ure means that farmers are left won-
dering how they are going to put food 
on the table and pay for gas to drive 
their kids to school. To make matters 
worse, consumers end up without ac-
cess to many of the products that they 
have learned to enjoy and on which 
they depend. 
This is where farm bill programs like 
crop insurance come in. Crop insurance 
serves producers and consumers alike 
because it helps prevent producers 
from going out of business and grocery 
store aisles from sitting empty. Farm 
bill programs like crop insurance have 
secured our national food supply and 
helped generations of producers avoid 
bankruptcy when times get tough. We 
are in one of those times right now. In-
flation is skyrocketing in America, 
President Biden is trying to impose his 
farm killer tax and dismantle the 
stepped-up basis, and producers are 
going out of business. The need to re-
authorize the farm bill for 2023 has 
come at a critical moment in time. 
A bad harvest in Kansas isn’t just 
about money. It is about morale and 
spirit. Missing harvest time in Kansas 
doesn’t just mean missing out on the 
yield of a cash crop. It means missing 
out on a special Kansas tradition of 
celebrating the culmination of all of 
your family’s hard work. It creates fi-
nancial insecurity while leaving a void 
where a renewal of family camaraderie 
should be. Washington, D.C., unfortu-
nately, doesn’t understand this. This 
city has never been crippled by some-
thing like a lost harvest. 
D.C. 
moves 
right 
along 
through 
drought, heat, late winter snows, and 
torrential downpours unfazed. That is 
why I am standing here today, to re-
mind Congress that 1 in 10 employed 
Americans—nearly 20 million people in 
this country—work in food and agri-
culture where weather creates a make- 
or-break situation for their livelihoods. 
And, most importantly, every Amer-
ican has to eat. 
American agricultural producers are 
hurting not only from skyrocketing 
input costs that come from inflation, 
but also from lowered morale that 
comes from extreme heat, drought, 
thin margins, and a broken supply 
chain. In 2023, Congress must reauthor-
ize the farm bill with American farm 
families at the front of their minds be-
cause they are in a crisis. 
I will be back on the floor soon to de-
liver another installment of my farm 
bill impact series and highlight more 
programs and titles within the bill that 
I believe Congress must understand and 
support to ensure that agriculture 
thrives in America. The people who 
feed, fuel, and clothe us all deserve our 
unwavering support. They also deserve 
a robust safety net in the farm bill and 
workable solutions to the inflation cri-
sis before it is too late.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF 
CARMEN LOUISE BOSSENBROCK 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Washington (Ms. SCHRIER) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. SCHRIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the lives of two out-
standing Eighth District residents. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to honor 
the 
legacy 
of 
Carmen 
Louise 
Bossenbrock who passed away on July 
31, 2022, at the age of 94. Carmen was a 
pioneering figure in the fight against 
polio, a tireless community advocate, 
and a beloved lifelong Wenatchee Val-
ley resident. 
As the polio epidemic rampaged 
across Washington State, Carmen be-
came 
a 
medical 
leader 
in 
the 
Wenatchee Valley. Working at Dea-
coness 
Hospital 
and 
later 
Central 
Washington Hospital as a physical 
therapist, Carmen was often the only 
thing standing between polio patients 
and debilitating paralysis. 
For 2 years, in the thick of the epi-
demic, she was the only licensed phys-
ical therapist practicing in north cen-
tral Washington. As patients flooded 
through her doors, Carmen devoted 
herself to the recovery of hundreds of 
patients. As a reflection of her tireless 
leadership, Carmen became the head of 
physical therapy at Central Wash-
ington Hospital until her retirement. 
Carmen remained a tireless advocate 
against polio in her later career. She 
was 
an 
active 
member 
of 
the 
Wenatchee Rotary Club—one of the 
first women to join. There she passion-
ately led fundraising for global vaccine 
programs to ensure no family would 
have to experience the devastation of 
polio. 
Friends remember Carmen as a pillar 
of the community, splitting her time 
between her beloved pear orchard in 
Dryden and her mission to eradicate 
polio. 
We are deeply grateful for Carmen’s 
service. Her legacy will forever be a 
part of the Wenatchee Valley and 
Washington State. I join Carmen’s fam-
ily and friends in mourning their loss 
of an extraordinary woman. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF GUNNERY SERGEANT 
ARTHUR BRANSON SUMMERS 
Ms. SCHRIER. Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to share the story of Gunnery Ser-
geant Arthur Branson Summers, a U.S. 
marine killed in action in World War 
II. After 76 years, his body has returned 
home to his family members and has 
been laid to rest in East Wenatchee, 
Washington. 
Gunnery Sergeant Summers of Com-
pany I, 3rd Battalion, 6th Marine Regi-
ment, 2nd Marine Division, was killed 
in the winter of 1943 in the Betio Island 
battle with Japanese forces. Sadly, 
Summers was 1 of 1,000 servicemembers 
who died that day and 1 of almost 500 
whose remains were never found. Trag-
ically for his family, friends, and loved 
ones, they were deemed nonrecoverable 
in 1949. 
But this changed in 2009 thanks to 
the tireless work of the nonprofit orga-
nization History Flight. After a small 
piece of military rain poncho was found 
near the site, History Flight began ex-
cavations in 2009 and discovered the 
body of Gunnery Sergeant Summers 
along with several other lost service-
members. His remains were brought 
home to his family, nephews David and 
Donald McCannel. He received an hon-
orable burial in East Wenatchee, Wash-
ington. 
Gunnery Sergeant Arthur Branson 
Summers answered our Nation’s call at 
a time of great need, and for his serv-
ice, valor, and sacrifice, we are forever 
thankful. 
I would like to recognize History 
Flight for their work to return Sum-
mers to his home and to thank David 
and Donald McCannel and their fami-
lies for providing Gunnery Sergeant 
Summers an honorable burial on Amer-
ican soil. 
On behalf of a grateful Nation and 
the entire Eighth District, we are 
proud to have Gunnery Sergeant Sum-
mers in his final resting place in East 
Wenatchee, Washington. 
HONORING THE ISSAQUAH ALL-STARS AND THE 
BONNEY LAKE/SUMNER LITTLE LEAGUE TEAMS 
Ms. SCHRIER. Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to take a moment to honor some 
tremendous 
young 
athletes. 
The 
Eighth District had not one but two 
teams representing our State at the 
Little 
League 
World 
Series. 
The 
Issaquah 
All-Stars 
represented 
the 
northwest region at the Little League 
Softball World Series, and the Bonney 
Lake/Sumner Little League team, at

THE PANDEMIC IS OVER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Mrs. MCCLAIN) for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. MCCLAIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to reiterate an important state-
ment made by our President: The pan-
demic is over. 
This weekend on ‘‘60 Minutes,’’ Presi-
dent Biden finally said what most 
Americans have known for months: We 
are no longer in the COVID–19 pan-
demic. 
So if the President just admitted it, 
that means the national emergency is 
over, correct? 
If that is the case, then why did the 
President just tell the country that the 
pandemic is so bad that we should for-
give billions of dollars of student debt, 
or that it is because of the ongoing 
pandemic that we must continue to en-
force a vaccine mandate on our Na-
tion’s military? 
b 1015 
I will tell you why—it is because it 
was never about the pandemic. It was 
about the President bypassing Con-
gress and the Constitution to push his 
radical socialist agenda. 
Mr. Speaker, President Biden himself 
has said the pandemic is over. It is past 
time that we strip him of his emer-
gency powers and end the vaccine man-
dates and reject all COVID-related 
funding requests. 
f 
CONGRATULATING THE LAS 
VEGAS ACES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Nevada (Ms. TITUS) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to acknowledge and congratulate the 
Las Vegas Aces on winning the Wom-
en’s National Basketball Association 
Championship this past Sunday. 
On September 18, 2022, the Las Vegas 
Aces defeated the Connecticut Sun 78– 
71 in game four of the WNBA finals. 
The Aces won the championship three 
games to one and secured the first 
major professional sports champion-
ship in the history of the city of Las 
Vegas. 
Even before the playoffs, the Aces 
had an incredible season led by rookie 
head coach Becky Hammon, who be-
came the first former NBA player and 
rookie head coach to win the NBA 
championship. 
Every member of the team, including 
Kiersten Bell, Sydney Colson, Chelsea 
Gray, 
Dearica 
Hamby, 
Theresa 
Plaisance, Kelsey Plum, Iliana Rupert, 
Aisha Sheppard, Kiah Stokes, Riquna 
Williams, A’ja Wilson, and Jackie 
Young was critical to the success of 
the Aces this year. 
Since coming to Las Vegas in 2018, 
the Aces have played well, but, unfor-
tunately, up until now they were un-
able to win at all. 
In 2020, during the COVID-shortened 
season and without key players due to 
injury, the team still made the WNBA 
finals but were ultimately turned back. 
In 2021, the team was set for great-
ness, but, unfortunately, fell short in 
heartbreaking fashion in game five of 
the Western Conference Finals. 
In the lead-up to the 2022 season, the 
team lost key players to free agency, 
and former coach Bill Laimbeer re-
tired, but the organization shifted its 
focus and approach and took the league 
by storm. 
Led by prolific three-point shooting, 
the Aces dominated the regular season 
and ended with a league best record of 
26–10, securing the Commissioner’s Cup 
along the way. 
Heading into the playoffs, the team 
was primed for success. 
Led by forward A’ja Wilson, who won 
this year’s regular season Most Valu-
able Player, also Defensive Player of 
the Year, and first-team All-WNBA 
honors, fellow All-WNBA honors guard 
Kelsey Plum, and WNBA Most Im-
proved Player Jackie Young, the Las 
Vegas Aces dominated the playoffs. 
In the finals, Chelsea Gray delivered 
a tremendous performance, averaging 
18 points per game in the series and 
winning the WNBA finals Most Valu-
able Player. In the championship- 
clinching 
game, 
Riquna 
Williams 
scored a crucial 17 points, with her in-
credible three-point shooting, to lift 
the Aces to victory. 
Following this victory, Aces players 
Chelsea Gray, Kelsey Plum, Jackie 
Young, and A’ja Wilson, who competed 
and won gold medals for the United 
States in the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, 
joined an exclusive club of players who 
won both Olympic gold and the WNBA 
championship. 
In closing, I congratulate owner 
Mark Davis who, through continued in-
vestment and caring, has put women’s 
basketball on the map in Las Vegas; 
Coach Becky Hammon; all the amazing 
players, led by the A’ja Wilson; and the 
entire Las Vegas organization led by 
its president, Nikki Fargas, and gen-
eral manager, Natalie Williams. Con-
gratulations 
on 
this 
tremendous 
achievement. 
The city of Las Vegas and all of 
southern Nevada are extremely proud 
of the Aces. They certainly raised the 
stakes and hit the jackpot.

RECOGNIZING 250TH ANNIVERSARY 
OF FINCASTLE, VIRGINIA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. CLINE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the 250th anniversary of 
Fincastle, Virginia. 
In 1772, western-moving settlers John 
Mill and Israel Christian founded the 
town of Fincastle, and by 1784 there 
were 59 homes as well as taverns and 
the early formation of a justice sys-
tem. 
Once Virginia’s gateway to the West, 
Fincastle 
is 
the 
county 
seat 
of 
Botetourt, which once extended to the 
Mississippi River. Meriweather Lewis 
and William Clark visited Fincastle 
during their great expedition into the 
West. William returned to Fincastle 
and married Julia Hancock in 1808 in 
the historic home, Santillane. The 
town has been nationally recognized as 
a Lewis and Clark community. 
Passing settlers stopped in Fincastle 
on their way into the interior of what 
would become the United States, con-
ducting business and buying goods 
from the merchants in town. 
Today, Fincastle proudly maintains 
its heritage and history. 
Their version of the Botetourt Coun-
ty Courthouse, designed by President 
Thomas 
Jefferson, 
is 
located 
in 
Fincastle and contains records going 
back hundreds of years. 
Fincastle’s annual Historic Fincastle 
Festival will be a bit more special this 
year, celebrating the town’s 250th anni-
versary, and being held this weekend. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent 
this historic town, a bedrock of the 
oldest colony and the great Common-
wealth of Virginia. 
BIDEN’S RADICAL AGENDA 
Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
criticize President Biden and House 
Democrats in Washington for turning 
their backs on hardworking families. 
Month after month, they have con-
tinued to advance a radical agenda 
that has crushed the American Dream. 
Grocery costs are up 131⁄2 percent, 
electricity costs are up 151⁄2 percent, 
fuel oil costs are up nearly 70 percent. 
Everything has gone up since this 
failed President took office. Why? Be-
cause Biden and the Democrats are ob-
sessed with spending taxpayer dollars 
and pushing Socialist Green New Deal 
policies. 
Last week, after yet another infla-
tion report showed that prices were up 
again, Joe Biden and the Democrats 
threw a party at the White House. To 
add insult to injury, on his recent 
interview on ‘‘60 Minutes,’’ President 
Biden had zero remorse for the dev-
astating effects of his raging inflation 
crisis. 
He continues to claim that the econ-
omy is great and that tons of jobs are 
being created. That is a lie. Here is 
what he is not telling you. Full-time 
jobs are way down, and it is only part- 
time jobs that are growing. 
Biden and Democrats have sent a 
clear message that they don’t care 
about American families. There is one 
solution to this problem: Stop reckless 
government spending. Virginia families 
are sick and tired of paying the price 
for Biden’s radical agenda. 
When Republicans retake the major-
ity next year, we will end this infla-
tion-fueled spending, fix this broken 
economy, and deliver power back to 
the American people.

FALL PREVENTION AWARENESS 
WEEK 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Ms. LOIS FRANKEL) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. LOIS FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. 
Speaker, about a year ago, it was 4 
a.m. in the morning when I got a call 
from the West Palm Beach paramedics. 
They had received a call from my 
mother’s Apple watch—believe it or 
not—and they rushed to her apartment, 
and they found her lying on her apart-
ment floor. She had fallen and broken 
her hip. 
I stayed close as she suffered through 
surgery and hospitalization and reha-
bilitation. I counted the endless med-
ical bills paid by Medicare and her own 
personal funds. I watched as my inde-
pendent mom became fearful of living 
alone and moved into an assisted living 
facility. 
Mr. Speaker, I will say, there is some 
very good news about my mom, she is 
alive and well and adapting to her new 
lifestyle. She uses a walker and aging 
has reduced her stamina, but her 
bridge partners will tell you she still 
has a very sharp mind. 
Listen to this. Her surgeon told me 
her recovery at her age, which was 96 
at the time of the fall, was an excep-
tion, that most her age, after a brutal 
injury, quickly sundown to death. 
Mr. Speaker, you may ask why am I 
telling this story? Because tomorrow is 
the first day of fall, and not only are 
the leaves turning, but it marks the 
start of Fall Prevention Awareness 
Week, a nationwide effort to raise 
awareness that falls are preventable, 
and also, to bring awareness to fall pre-
vention strategies and resources. 
Mr. Speaker, after my mom fell, I 
started hearing story after story from 
friends and colleagues about their own 
personal experiences of people who had 
fallen, and you know what I learned? 
Falls are the most frequent cause of in-
juries and injury-related death among 
people over 65. 
There are 36 million falls a year in 
people over 65 here in America, leading 
to broken bones and broken spirits, and 
34,000 of those becoming deadly. The 
cost—this is an amazing figure—the 
cost to the American health system is 
$50 billion a year from injuries related 
to falls. That is billion with a b. 
Here is the most important message I 
have today: Falls are preventable. I am 
going to say it again: Falls are pre-
ventable. There are simple things that 
seniors can do with assistance from 
their doctors and their family and 
their friends and caretakers to stop the 
falls before they happen. 
Here are some of the top tips from 
Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention. Make sure that medications 
don’t have side effects that can cause 
dizziness or loss of balance, stay hy-
drated, get eyes checked every year. 
And because most falls happen in the 
home, make critical changes like in-
stalling grab bars, clearing tripping 
hazards, and make sure that the rugs 
are flat on the floor. If necessary, use 
mobility aids like walkers and canes, 
when needed, even in your own home. 
There are also simple exercises that 
seniors 
can 
do 
to 
improve 
joint 
strength, especially in the ankles, to 
help improve balance and stability. 
I am pleased to say, Mr. Speaker, 
that the House Labor, Health, and 
Human Services’ budget plusses up fall 
prevention research and programs in 
the 2023 budget. I am hoping that the 
Senate will go along with that. 
Mr. Speaker, I call on all my col-
leagues to recognize this week as Fall 
Prevention Awareness Week and help 
me spread the word: Falls are prevent-
able. It is on all of us to keep our loved 
ones on their feet.

SOCIAL SECURITY FAIRNESS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Louisiana (Ms. LETLOW) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. LETLOW. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to express disappointment and 
frustration of thousands of my con-
stituents after our effort to bring H.R. 
82, the Social Security Fairness Act, to 
the floor for a vote, which was delayed 
this week. 
The Windfall Elimination Provision 
and the Government Pension Offset are 
unfair, bureaucratic deductions that 
cheat nearly 2 million Americans out 
of their earned Social Security bene-
fits. 
These rules impact our public serv-
ants—the teachers who educate our 
children, firefighters and police officers 
who keep our communities safe. At a 
time when we desperately need more 
men and women to enter these fields, 
knowing these penalties exist deter 
them from pursuing these occupations. 
WEP and GPO have been in place 
since the 1980s and Congress has ig-
nored this problem for decades. I want 
to be clear, we are not trying to create 
new entitlement programs or forgive 
debt. We are trying to ensure that re-
tirees obtain the benefits that are 
rightly theirs. 
Just last week, I received a letter 
from Carla Moreau, a teacher from 
Bunkie, Louisiana, who retired after 
spending 23 years in the classroom. 
Carla recently lost her husband, Ge-
rard, to cancer at age 60. However, due 
to WEP and GPO, she is ineligible to 
receive his Social Security survivor 
benefits simply because she was a 
teacher. If Carla had chosen any other 
profession outside of public service, she 
would automatically receive those ben-
efits just like any other American 
would. 
Mr. Speaker, Carla’s story is just one 
of the many from across my district 
and around our country, and each one 
is heartbreaking and unjust. Not a sin-
gle day goes by that I don’t hear from 
a constituent who is impacted. 
b 1030 
Since I took office over 1 year ago, 
almost 3,000 people have contacted my 
office to ask us to fix WEP and GPO— 
by far, the most calls concerning a sin-
gle issue. 
High inflation and record price hikes 
continue to plague our Nation, and 
now, by refusing to address WEP and 
GPO, this Congress is essentially tell-
ing hardworking Americans that they 
must either not retire, reenter the 
workforce, or find other means to 
make ends meet. 
It is astounding to me that this ad-
ministration and the Democratic ma-
jority spend trillions to forgive student 
loans, bail out private industry, and 
create new government programs, but 
the people impacted by WEP and GPO 
continue to be ignored. 
My colleague from Illinois, RODNEY 
DAVIS, brought forward H.R. 82 to re-
peal WEP and GPO. I am a proud co-
sponsor of this bill, along with nearly 
300 other Members of this House. 
Since the 117th Congress convened, 
we worked together as Democrats and 
Republicans to find a way to bring this 
bill to the floor for a vote. After nearly 
a year and a half of being denied, we 
worked to have it placed on the Con-
sensus Calendar, a process that could 
force the bill to come to the House 
floor. 
Only when we were on the cusp of 
forcing a floor vote and had 300 Mem-
bers ready to support this measure did 
Democratic leadership take action to 
remove the legislation from the Con-
sensus Calendar and essentially bog it 
down in a backlog. 
Mr. Speaker, it is unconscionable to 
me that some would play procedural 
games and deny this body the oppor-
tunity to vote on a bill that fixes such 
an obvious wrong. 
What am I supposed to say to the 
people like Carla Moreau? That despite 
the fact that we were sent here to solve 
problems, we will just kick the can 
down the road? 
Is that really the answer that we are 
okay with relaying to her and the 2 
million Americans who are adversely 
impacted? 
Mr. Speaker, I was sent here to rep-
resent the people of the Fifth District 
of Louisiana, and today, I can say with 
grave sincerity that their voices, along 
with 2 million other Americans, con-
tinue to be silenced. 
Instead of my standing behind this 
podium today, we should be doing the 
will of the people and bringing H.R. 82 
to the floor for a vote.

STUDENT DEBT CANCELLATION

millions of student loan borrowers 
across this Nation who slept a little 
easier last night knowing that essen-
tial student loan debt relief is on the 
way. 
I am thinking of every person who 
has pulled me aside in community and 
dropped their eyes to the floor as they 
describe 
the 
financial 
burden 
and 
shame they were carrying, crushed by 
student debt—the teachers, the elec-
tricians, the nurses, and, indeed, even 
the grandparents, our elders, some 76 
years old on fixed incomes whose bene-
fits were garnished. 
The coalition that rallied around our 
calls to cancel student debt is as broad 
and diverse as this Nation because so, 
too, are the families personally im-
pacted by this economic justice issue. 
We thank President Biden for taking 
action. We thank him for listening 
deeply and responding. With the stroke 
of a pen, he moved to cancel student 
debt for millions of borrowers, and this 
action is going to change and save 
lives. 
In my home State of Massachusetts, 
the Department of Education reported 
yesterday that 813,000 student loan bor-
rowers in Massachusetts stand to ben-
efit from student debt cancellation. 
I get emotional thinking about the 
profound impact this will have for our 
families, especially families that have 
been systemically denied the oppor-
tunity to own or build generational 
wealth. This is the type of trans-
formative policy that sends ripples for 
generations. Student loan cancellation 
will change and save lives. 
I thank my dedicated partners in this 
effort, Senator WARREN and Senator 
SCHUMER; my colleagues in the House 
who have worked on this issue for 
years alongside me: Congresswoman 
OMAR, 
Congresswoman 
ADAMS, 
Mr. 
CLYBURN, Mr. JONES, and our partners 
in the Congressional Progressive Cau-
cus and the Congressional Black Cau-
cus, 
including 
Senator 
WARNOCK, 
Chairwoman 
JAYAPAL, 
Chairwoman 
BEATTY, and Chairwoman WATERS. 
Our work to make education acces-
sible and affordable across the Nation 
continues with urgency, and millions 
of families are going to start 2023 stu-
dent loan debt-free thanks to the 
Biden-Harris administration. That is a 
beautiful thing. 
RECOGNIZING HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH 
Ms. PRESSLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in recognition of Hispanic Heritage 
Month. 
The Massachusetts Seventh is one of 
the most diverse districts in the coun-
try due, in large part, to the rich His-
panic and Latinx communities who re-
side there: the Colombians, Salva-
dorans, and Ecuadorians in East Bos-
ton and Chelsea; the Dominicans, Puer-
to Ricans, and Cubans in Jamaica 
Plain and the South End; and the Mexi-
cans and Brazilians in Cambridge, 
Somerville, Everett, and beyond. 
Many of these champions are on the 
front lines of fights that matter not 
just for their own community but for 
our very humanity. They are justice 
seekers and movement builders, and 
given the number of servicemen and 
-women and veterans, they are defend-
ers of democracy and freedom. 
Their sweat equity makes our coun-
try stronger and our policymaking 
more informed. I am proud to call them 
partners in the work to build a more 
just and equitable world because, Mr. 
Speaker, if the story of America is one 
of progress, then we owe it to the col-
lective power, resilience, and collective 
advocacy of our Hispanic and Latinx 
siblings. 
So to those in Massachusetts and 
across the country, and those on my 
dedicated staff now and in the past, 
from Aissa to Lona, to Luz, to Alana, 
to Ricardo, to Dagoberto, to Kayla, we 
thank you. This month and every 
month, we give you your flowers. 
RECOGNIZING ALOPECIA AREATA AWARENESS 
MONTH 
Ms. PRESSLEY. Finally, Mr. Speak-
er, I rise to recognize September as Al-
opecia Awareness Month. 
Across the country, approximately 7 
million people have alopecia, an auto-
immune disease, which I live with, that 
attacks one’s hair follicles. 
People of all ages, genders, races, and 
from every walk of life are living with 
this condition. Thankfully, although 
this does not threaten our lives, it does 
not mean that it does not impact it. 
Collectively, we are fighting for bold 
investments in skin disease research, 
comprehensive medical coverage, and 
meaningful public education to combat 
the stigma, discrimination, bullying, 
and, indeed, even depression and sui-
cide ideation that so many of us experi-
ence. 
Whether we are sharing a meal in the 
heart of the Massachusetts Seventh or 
sharing our stories, to someone who is 
newly diagnosed, we choose strength 
over shame and purpose over pain. 
I can personally attest to the for-
titude that defines our community 
each and every day. Although there is 
no cure, there is community. We work 
to create space so that all of us may 
show up in the world as our full and au-
thentic selves. 
This transformation that I live with 
is not one of my choosing, but it is one 
that 
I 
have 
learned 
to 
embrace 
unapologetically with the support of 
my loved ones, team, and broader com-
munity in my decision to not wear a 
wig, recognizing the power of that rep-
resentation for the 7 million-strong al-
opecia community in this country. 
That is why, this September, on the 
floor of the House of Representatives, I 
can affirm that alopecia is my super-
power. I am free to be me. I commemo-
rate 
Alopecia 
Areata 
Awareness 
Month.

RECOGNIZING IMPORTANCE OF 
AGRICULTURE EDUCATION 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
the importance of agriculture edu-
cation. 
Last week, we celebrated National 
Teach Ag Day. This recognition of ag-
riculture education is more important 
than ever. 
The average age of the American 
farmer is around 57 years old. It is crit-
ical for our food security to inspire the 
next generation of agricultural leaders, 
and this starts in the classroom. 
I have had the privilege of spending 
time with agriculture educators in 
Pennsylvania 
and 
throughout 
our 
country. Programs like the Future 
Farmers of America and 4–H are strong 
advocates for advancing agriculture 
education and exposing our youth to 
the agriculture industry. 
Over the past few months, I have had 
the opportunity to witness these agri-
culture programs firsthand. I visited 
fourth graders at Glendale Elementary 
School in Cambria County who were 
working closely with seniors from the 
Central 
Pennsylvania 
Institute 
of 
Science and Technology to bring text-
books to life. The lesson I participated 
in focused on science, soil, and agricul-
tural operations. I had the opportunity 
to work directly with the students, 
where we discussed a plant’s journey 
from seed to full growth. We examined 
soil, and students made observations of 
plant growth. 
We interact with agriculture at least 
three times a day, and it is critical 
that students have the opportunity to 
really learn about the industry and the 
career opportunities that it offers. 
In July, I joined CenClear and the 
YMCA of Centre County at the ribbon 
cutting of the antihunger program at 
Morgan Run Farm. This initiative will 
serve as a hands-on, community-cen-
tered educational tool to further fami-
lies’ understanding of agriculture proc-
esses, farming, nutrition, and commu-
nity development. 
Right now, more than ever, we under-
stand food security is national secu-
rity, and a country that cannot feed 
itself often finds itself in turmoil. Pro-
grams like the antihunger program at 
Morgan Run and the science lesson at 
Glendale Elementary are the first steps 
in educating our youth about our food 
sources. 
As I mentioned earlier, we are at a 
critical point in our agricultural fu-
ture, with the average age of our farm-
ers hovering around 57 years old. It is 
important that we develop the next 
generation of farmers. That is why, in 
August, I held a listening session fo-
cused on the next generation of farm-
ers. 
We discussed how we can engage and 
support our next generation of farmers 
and encourage youth to get involved in 
the agriculture industry. We had re-
markable panelists who were incred-
ibly accomplished in their fields. To-
gether, we highlighted their work to 
promote innovative technologies that 
inspire and engage the next generation 
of agriculturists.

September 21, 2022 
As a senior member of the Education 
and Labor Committee, co-chair of the 
bipartisan Career and Technical Edu-
cation Caucus, co-chair of the 4–H Cau-
cus, and proud member of the FFA 
Caucus, I am passionate about advanc-
ing agricultural education in schools. 
I take this moment to thank all of 
our agricultural educators across the 
country, the Commonwealth, and in 
the 15th Congressional District. Their 
work invests in our agriculture edu-
cation and helps prepare the next gen-
eration of farmers, producers, and 
ranchers. 
I always enjoy my meetings with 
FFA and 4–H students, as they are 
clearly our future, and our conversa-
tions give me great hope in the direc-
tion of our agricultural community. 
Mr. Speaker, I, once again, thank all 
those involved in agricultural edu-
cation and empowering our next gen-
eration of farmers. 
CELEBRATING ACCUWEATHER’S 60TH 
ANNIVERSARY 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratu-
late AccuWeather on its 60th anniver-
sary. 
Since 1962, AccuWeather has provided 
trusted and accurate weather forecasts 
for individuals, businesses, and commu-
nities. 
AccuWeather is repeatedly recog-
nized as the most accurate weather 
forecast. Their warnings have saved 
thousands of lives and have protected 
people from harm and property from 
damage. Most notably, Congress cited 
AccuWeather during Hurricane Katrina 
for saving 10,000 people, thanks to their 
accurate forecasts. 
Today, more than 1.5 billion people 
rely on AccuWeather to stay safe and 
plan their day. 
AccuWeather currently has the larg-
est collection of data at its Global 
Weather Center, which receives more 
information than any other facility on 
Earth. 
Most importantly, AccuWeather is a 
proud Pennsylvania 15th Congressional 
District business with more than 500 
employees and is headquartered in Fer-
guson Township in Centre County. 
Mr. Speaker, please join me in con-
gratulating AccuWeather; their found-
er and CEO, Dr. Joel Myers; and their 
entire team on 60 years of service to 
our communities and excellence in 
forecasting the weather.

UNCERTAINTY IN WAKE OF 
HURRICANE FIONA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. ESPAILLAT) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to continue to raise awareness to 
the destruction that Hurricane Fiona 
has brought about to the Caribbean— 
namely, to Puerto Rico and the Domin-
ican Republic. 
Let me start, Mr. Speaker, by saying 
that yesterday marked the fifth anni-
versary of Hurricane Maria, a natural 
disaster that left 3.5 million Americans 
without power and killed over 3,000 
lives. 
While hurricanes in the islands are 
not new, Hurricane Maria exposed the 
vulnerability of Puerto Rico, and 5 
years later, uncertainty remains in the 
wake of Hurricane Fiona, which oc-
curred this past weekend. 
There was a 100 percent blackout on 
the island when the hurricane landed. 
As of 10 a.m. yesterday, 73 percent of 
the island had no power and 60 percent 
of the island had no water. 
I commend the Biden administration 
for its swift actions to declare a state 
of emergency for the region, and I am 
hopeful that they will approve Gov-
ernor Pierluisi’s request for a major 
disaster declaration soon, which will 
follow additional lifesaving resources 
for Puerto Rico. 
For this reason, I join Senator SCHU-
MER and Congresswoman VELA´ ZQUEZ in 
speaking with FEMA Administrator 
Deanne Criswell, urging the adminis-
tration to reimburse 100 percent of the 
costs, allow document flexibility for 
accessing aid, and advance funding to 
Puerto Rico in this critical moment. 
We must do all it takes to ensure re-
lief assistance to help residents re-
cover. We cannot turn our backs on our 
brothers and sisters in Puerto Rico. 
Yesterday, I held a strategy planning 
call with leaders from New York, Puer-
to Rico, the Dominican Republic, and 
emergency services organizations in re-
sponse to Hurricane Fiona. 
We have witnessed catastrophic dev-
astation across Puerto Rico and the 
Dominican Republic, and it will re-
quire a multilevel government ap-
proach to ensure vital resources to the 
region in a timely manner. 
b 1045 
As of today, more than 1 million peo-
ple in the Dominican Republic are 
without access to utilities and shelter. 
At least 1 million people in the Do-
minican Republic have no access to 
running water. 
More than 700,000 homes and busi-
nesses have been left in the dark as 
they suffered loss of power. 
Additionally, at least 3,000 homes 
were damaged or destroyed, and four 
bridges collapsed. 
The situation is dire. We must do all 
we can to help the people of the Domin-
ican Republic during this moment of 
crisis. 
For this reason, I am urging the 
United 
States 
Agency 
For 
Inter-
national Development to deploy a Dis-
aster Assistance Response Team and 
coordinate with other U.S. Government 
agencies and partners to advance relief 
efforts. 
The Federal response must be swift, 
robust, and continue for as long as is 
needed. 
The impact of this devastating nat-
ural disaster hits close to home, as a 
multitude of my district—we have 
many folks in Washington Heights, in 
the Bronx, in El Barrio, and Harlem— 
have family members in Puerto Rico 
and the Dominican Republic who are in 
need of supplies and other disaster re-
lief. 
Mr. Speaker, my heart is with the 
people of the Caribbean, and we will 
continue to monitor this situation 
closely.

HONORING BRIGADIER GENERAL 
THOMAS CAUTHEN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Tennessee (Mr. BURCHETT) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to honor Brigadier General Thomas 
Cauthen, an American patriot who 
served 38 years in the Tennessee Air 
National Guard. 
He was inspired as a child by watch-
ing his dad’s career as a pilot in the 
Tennessee Air National Guard’s 134th 
Fighter-Interceptor Group, which later 
became the 134th Air Refueling Wing. 
In 1984, General Cauthen followed in 
his dad’s footsteps and started his com-
mission right after getting his bachelor 
of science in civil engineering from the 
University of Tennessee. 
After getting his pilot training, he 
flew combat support missions during 
Operation 
Desert 
Storm, 
Southern 
Watch, Joint Forge, Allied Force, En-
during Freedom, and Noble Eagle. He 
eventually went to the 134th Air Re-
fueling Wing and ended up serving as 
its commander for 7 years. He then be-
came the director of staff at the Joint 
Force 
Headquarters 
Tennessee 
and 
then chief of staff for the entire Ten-
nessee Air National Guard. 
Mr. Speaker, last month, he retired 
after 38 long years of faithfully serving 
his country. He plans to spend more 
time with his wonderful wife, Penny, 
their two kids, and their grandchild. 
He also plans to get more involved with 
the community by volunteering with 
the Employer Support of the Guard and 
Reserve and get more involved with the 
East Tennessee Military Affairs Coun-
cil. 
Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recog-
nize 
Brigadier 
General 
Thomas 
Cauthen as Tennessee’s Second Dis-
trict’s September 2022 Veteran of the 
Month. I thank him for his incredible 
service and congratulate him on a well- 
earned retirement. 
CONGRATULATING ETHAN AND ARI KLASKY 
POWERLIFTING CHAMPIONS IN EAST TENNESSEE 
Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker, I want 
to take a moment to appreciate some 
powerlifting champions in east Ten-
nessee. 
That 
is 
correct, 
I 
said 
powerlifting. 
Last week, I was on the plane back to 
Knoxville from Washington. This fel-
low sitting next to me talked excitedly 
about his set of twins, 17-year-old Ari 
and Ethan, who go to Webb School of 
Knoxville. They are powerlifting cham-
pions.

a hobby, and he got his boys into the

sport when they were about 9 years old. 
They all trained together, and as time 
went on, they ended up loving the sport 
as much as their dad. 
This year, the boys decided to com-
pete for the first time in the Southern 
Powerlifting Federation championship, 
and they blew the competition out of 
the water. Both boys won their divi-
sions, and Ari set a world record—a 
world record, Mr. Speaker—for his age 
and weight class by lifting a total of 
1,660 
pounds 
between 
his 
deadlift, 
bench, and squat. 
It is very cool to me to have a world 
record holder who goes to school in my 
district, but it is even cooler to hear 
how the shared love of powerlifting 
bonded this father and his sons in a 
very unique way. 
Ari and Ethan didn’t grow up as bick-
ering brothers as most do. They grew 
up as training partners. They sup-
ported each other, kept each other 
safe, and pushed each other to keep 
pursuing their goals. 
Unfortunately, Ari tore his ACL and 
won’t be able to compete in the squat 
or deadlift this year, but he isn’t let-
ting that fact get him down. He still 
plans to compete in the bench press 
competition, and he credits his perse-
verance to his brother’s constant inspi-
ration. Ari isn’t giving up on his dream 
of competing in the USA Powerlifting 
competition. 
I have a teenage daughter, Isabelle, 
and she is also an athlete. She does 
horseback riding competitions. She is a 
barrel racer, and she is pretty good at 
it. I know exactly how awesome it is to 
be a dad who is incredibly proud of 
their kids’ accomplishments. 
We all want our kids to do well in 
life. To see them push themselves and 
exceed everyone’s expectations is a 
feeling like no other. 
Scott, Ari, and Ethan are prime ex-
amples of what we can accomplish 
when we set goals and work hard every 
day to achieve them. 
Mr. Speaker, I take just a moment to 
recognize their accomplishments. 
f 
UKRAINE TRIP 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. COSTA) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, since Rus-
sia’s invasion of Ukraine, the world has 
changed—socially, economically, and 
the political landscape. Putin’s war has 
killed thousands of Ukrainians, inno-
cent citizens, and displaced millions 
who have struggled to get food and re-
sources in this region. 
Last April, I spoke on the floor after 
the attacks in Bucha, which I visited, 
and labeled President Putin for what 
he is, a war criminal. As Russia con-
tinues 
this 
unprovoked 
attack 
on 
Ukraine, we must continue to stand 
strong and united against him. 
I traveled to Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital 
city, as a part of the Yalta European 
Strategy Conference recently. 
As one of the only Members of Con-
gress to have actually stayed over-
night, spent a couple of days, I wit-
nessed the 24-hour cycle of the capital 
city finding energy once again, revital-
izing itself through its day-to-day rou-
tines. 
I saw parts of the city where Russia’s 
tanks entered the suburbs and killed 
innocent civilians, as well as children, 
destroying 
homes, 
apartments 
and 
schools, mass graves with over 166 indi-
viduals. Even through this tragedy, 
Ukraine has remained resilient, and 
Kyiv returns to life. 
I felt relatively safe as I walked the 
streets in the central city. Looking 
back to where the city was 6 months 
ago is a reminder to me of how pre-
cious all of our freedoms are. As I met 
Ukrainians across the capital, it was 
inspiring to see their hope that better 
days are coming, and that Ukraine will 
prevail. 
During my visit, we met with NATO 
allies and many of the panel sessions 
that we had focused on how we will 
continue 
our 
support 
for 
Ukraine 
amidst Russia’s brutal war that was 
unprovoked. 
Critically, we discussed matters re-
lated to Ukraine’s defense, its economy 
and recovery plans, and humanitarian 
aid as it continues to prevail from Rus-
sia’s countless attacks. 
Strong economic security is critical 
to rebuilding Ukraine and preserving 
its sovereignty. That is what we must 
do after the war. We saw Ukrainian 
Armed Forces execute one of the most 
pivotable 
48-hour 
counteroffensives 
during the past 6 months, and it con-
tinues. 
The liberation of Izium and territory 
to the north in Kharkiv is one of the 
countless displays of bravery and sac-
rifice 
that 
have 
come 
to 
define 
Ukraine’s fight. 
Ukraine is putting up a stronger 
fight than Russia was anticipating; 
through strength, unity, and love of 
country, Ukraine will prevail. 
Today, we heard that Putin is enlarg-
ing his forces by 300,000 and is inferring 
that everything is on the table. We 
must call his bluff. 
Congress and President Biden have 
provided significant support to Ukraine 
since the beginning of the war, and it 
has made a difference on a bipartisan 
basis, and we must continue that when 
we pass the continuing resolution later 
in the next week. 
Ukraine has been able to strengthen 
its defense systems, bolster its refugee 
services, and tackle food insecurity. 
Millions of tons of grain have come out 
of Odessa through the agreement that 
was reached through Turkey and the 
U.N. However, challenges remain, and 
the war has not yet been won. 
We, the United States with our NATO 
allies, must continue to unite against 
Vladimir Putin and provide Ukraine 
with the tools to defend itself and to 
protect its sovereignty from this brutal 
invasion. 
As we craft the upcoming continuing 
resolution, we must continue addi-
tional funding. 
This is a pivotal moment in our his-
tory. Our actions today will determine 
the future of the 21st century. 
The world has changed in the last 8 
months. Future generations will look 
back in history and judge us if we made 
more good decisions than poor deci-
sions to preserve their rights and their 
liberties. 
We must not let Putin win. Democ-
racy must prevail. This is the test of 
our time and our generation among our 
NATO allies and here in America to 
stand up for liberty and democracy. 
Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how 
much time I have remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from California has 30 seconds 
remaining. 
AZERBAIJAN’S ATTACK ON ARMENIA 
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I also rise 
today to condemn Azerbaijan’s attack 
on Armenia. 
Nearly 204 Armenian troops are con-
firmed killed or missing. It was an at-
tack on a sovereign territory. 
Speaker PELOSI’s visit to Armenia is 
a symbol of the United States’ commit-
ment to a peaceful, prosperous Arme-
nia that is setting up its own demo-
cratic nation. That is why I am push-
ing to include demining assistance and 
other aid for Armenia and Artsakh in 
the fiscal year 2023 budget. 
Mr. Speaker, we must stand with the 
people of Armenia for all the right rea-
sons.

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
With the psalmist, let us pray. 
You, O Lord, are our strength, we 
watch for You. You, O God, are our for-
tress on whom we can rely. 
God, go before the men and women of 
Ukraine and be the shield and defense 
of their country against their aggres-
sors. In Your might uproot their en-
emies and bring them down. 
For the sins of their mouths, for the 
words of their lips, let those who would 
slander Ukraine, let them be caught in 
their pride. For the curses and lies 
they utter, consume them in Your 
wrath. 
Deliver Ukraine, O God. Save its peo-
ple from those who conspire against 
them for no offense or sin of their own.

PERIPHERAL ARTERY DISEASE 
AWARENESS MONTH 
(Mr. PAYNE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to commemorate September as 
Peripheral Artery Disease, or PAD, 
Awareness Month. 
PAD is a disease of the arteries that 
can cause blockages in the arms and 
legs, and it could lead to limb amputa-
tions. There are more than 160,000 PAD 
patients who lose limbs to this disease 
every year. African Americans are 
three times more likely to have a limb 
amputated than other Americans. That 
is because these patients are less likely 
to receive proper screenings and treat-
ment for PAD. 
That is why I created the Congres-
sional PAD Caucus and serve as its co- 
chairman. I wanted to create aware-
ness of this disease in Congress so we 
can 
provide 
resources 
for 
better 
screenings and treatments. Once we do 
that, we can save limbs and lives every 
year. 
f 
BREW ACROSS AMERICA 
COMPETITION 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, in June, I was hon-
ored to kick off the fifth annual Brew 
Across America competition hosted by 
Anheuser-Busch. 
Brew Across America brings together 
Members from both sides of the aisle 
through a friendly competition to brew 
their own varieties in partnership with 
a bipartisan buddy. 
My partner and I, fellow Agriculture 
Committee 
member, 
Congressman 
SALUD CARBAJAL, may not see eye to 
eye on every policy issue, but we can 
both agree to set aside our differences 
over a good beer. 
I invite all of my colleagues to join 
us, our competitors, and the Anheuser- 
Busch team tonight at Nationals Sta-
dium to sample each of the bipartisan 
brews and help us crown a winner. 
One of the awards is a People’s 
Choice award. To participate, individ-
uals can text the name of their favorite 
beer to 202–980–4023 until 7 p.m. eastern 
time tonight. 
The smooth functioning of democ-
racy so often relies on finding common 
ground to solve the toughest chal-
lenges, and we all know the process of 
finding common ground demands mu-
tual respect. 
Beer and agriculture—since it is a 
great agro product—go hand in hand, 
and as Republican leader of the House 
Agriculture Committee, I remind us all 
to thank a farmer the next time you 
crack open a cold one. 
f 
UTILITIES AS A HUMAN RIGHT 
(Ms. TLAIB asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
support of the Resolution Recognizing 
the Human Rights to Utilities. 
I read an article about a couple in 
their seventies in Detroit who had to 
melt snow in a bucket in front of their 
home so they can flush their toilet. 
That is when I knew when I came to 
the United States Congress, I had to in-
troduce water as a human rights act. 
Millions of our neighbors across our 
country right now struggle with utility 
insecurity, fear of shutoffs, and are 
subject to inhumane living conditions. 
I proudly stand with Representatives 
BUSH and BOWMAN and other colleagues 
in the House in changing the conversa-
tion around what we all deserve. 
The resolution ensures that everyone 
has access to water, sanitation, elec-
tricity, heating and cooling, public 
transit, and broadband communica-
tions all as a basic human right. 
It is past time that we take the prof-
it motive out of providing the basics of 
a good life for many of our neighbors 
who continue again to struggle. I ap-
preciate everyone that is working on 
this issue and the advocates out there 
that know that this is important to our 
country.

HONORING DICK SCHOFIELD 
(Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor 
Springfield’s own Dick Schofield. Dick 
passed away recently at age 87. He was 
the grandfather of my good friend 
Jayson Werth. 
Schofield was an accomplished base-
ball star, spending 19 seasons in the 
major leagues with seven organiza-
tions. Schofield’s baseball career began 
at Springfield High School. Just weeks 
after graduating, he reported to the St. 
Louis Cardinals. In 1960, he became a 
World Series champion as a pivotal 
member of the Pittsburgh Pirates. 
Dick is one of four generations in his 
family to play professional baseball. He 
followed in his father Ducky’s foot-
steps, and both his son Dick, and 
grandson Jayson, had long and success-
ful careers in MLB as well. 
Though Schofield had opportunities 
to stay in the league as a coach, he 
chose to return to his hometown of 
Springfield to treasure his time with 
his loving wife, Donna, and their three 
children: 
Kim, 
Dick, 
and 
Tami. 
Schofield proudly represented his com-
munity as an accomplished salesman 
and 20-year board member of the 
Springfield 
Metropolitan 
Exposition 
Authority. 
As a grandfather to eight and great- 
grandfather to five, Dick was a true 
family man that cherished the time 
spent with all of them. I send my deep-
est condolences to my friend Jayson 
and the entire Schofield family. 
Dick, may you rest in peace.

COUNTERING UNTRUSTED 
TELECOMMUNICATIONS ABROAD 
(Ms. WILD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. WILD. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
support of my bill, the Countering 
Untrusted Telecommunications Abroad 
Act, which passed the House yesterday. 
I thank my colleague and friend from 
the other side of the aisle, Representa-
tive ANN WAGNER of Missouri, for co- 
leading this legislation. This bill is 
proof that when it comes to national 
and economic security challenges, we 
can find common ground. 
The purpose of the bill is simple: to 
investigate and respond to vulnerabili-
ties caused by Chinese telecommuni-
cations companies in U.S. embassies 
overseas and among our close allies. 
For too long, the world has stood by as 
Chinese telecoms giants have operated 
as vehicles for the Chinese Communist 
Party to commit horrific human rights 
violations against the Uyghur people, 
conduct mass surveillance and espio-
nage, and supply technology to other 
repressive regimes around the world. 
Securing these networks is impera-
tive when it comes to national security 
and human rights, as well as for our 
economic security. This legislation 
will 
help 
us 
to 
ensure 
that

RECOGNIZING MORTON HIGH 
SCHOOL 
(Mr. LAHOOD asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAHOOD. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Morton High School 
in Morton, Illinois. 
At Morton, classes past and present 
have achieved tremendous success and 
a legacy of excellence carried on by the 
students that followed them. 
As the Morton High School athletics 
department has grown, so has the 
prominence of their girls’ basketball 
team, known as the Lady Potters. In 
an unprecedented record of success in 
eight seasons from 2015 to 2022, the 
Lady Potters won four Illinois State 
championships, three in succession. In 
that time, they have won 244 games 
and only lost 23. 
Coach Bob Becker has been awarded 
Coach of the Year multiple times by 
the Illinois High School Association 
and was named to the Illinois Basket-
ball Coaches Hall of Fame in 2020. This 
year, the class of 1972 also celebrates 
their 50th anniversary as graduates of 
Morton High School. 
Morton continues to honor the leg-
acy of the classes before them and 
their 
tremendous 
achievements 
throughout the year. Congratulations 
to classes past and present of Morton 
High School. The school pride is wor-
thy of celebration. Keep up the great 
work, Potters. 
f 
HONORING SADIQA REYNOLDS 
(Mr. YARMUTH asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor a leader in my com-
munity and a person I consider one of 
the most impactful individuals in the 
history of Louisville, Sadiqa Reynolds, 
in her final days as president and CEO 
of the Urban League of Louisville. 
It was only 7 years ago that Sadiqa 
was an esteemed judge, a role where 
she conducted herself with impar-
tiality and kept her feelings and opin-
ions to herself. My, how times change. 
As head of the Urban League, Sadiqa 
has held nothing back, leading with an 
open heart and open mind, speaking 
out for Louisville’s marginalized com-
munities with the passion and elo-
quence necessary to create positive, 
lasting change in people’s lives. 
You cannot drive Louisville’s streets 
without seeing Sadiqa’s impact. Our 
West End has begun a much-awaited 
transformation in the last few years, 
anchored in large part by a new world- 
class track and field and education 
complex, which she conceived and 
spearheaded. 
Sadiqa, you have been the conscience 
of our community, leading the fight 
against injustice in historic times. We 
are a better city because of your lead-
ership. We are grateful for your service 
and can’t wait to see what you will 
achieve next. 
f 
RECOGNIZING SUICIDE 
AWARENESS MONTH 
(Mr. KATKO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Suicide Awareness 
Month. 
For families deeply affected by sui-
cide like my own—this issue is very 
personal. 
When I came to Congress, I decided 
to turn grief into a purpose by co- 
chairing the bipartisan Mental Health 
Caucus. 
I have worked with my colleagues to 
author and pass legislation to expand 
pediatric mental health care, effec-
tively implement the new 988 suicide 
lifeline, and reduce the shortage of 
mental health professionals, but there 
is still much more to be done. 
Stigma surrounding mental illness 
still persists in the country big time. 
We are just beginning to understand 
the pandemic’s true impact on behav-
ioral health. If we are to make mean-
ingful progress to reduce suicide, we 
need to focus on areas that produce the 
most in the least amount of time. 
The American Foundation for Sui-
cide Prevention, along with a growing 
segment of the medical community, 
has recognized the need to expand sui-
cide 
risk 
screenings 
within 
our 
healthcare community systems. By 
having more patients receive these 
screenings, 
healthcare 
professionals 
can better identify and treat at-risk in-
dividuals. 
Madam Speaker, suicide prevention 
is an issue near and dear to my heart, 
and I encourage all of my colleagues to 
join me in this important, lifesaving 
work. 
f 
HAWAIIAN HISTORY MONTH 
(Mr. KAHELE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. KAHELE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of Hawaiian His-
tory Month in my home State of Ha-
waii. 
Today, I recognize David La’amea 
Kalakaua, who was elected king in 1874 
and served until his death in 1891. He 
was the first governing monarch to 
visit Washington and circumnavigate 
the globe. 
In 1882, he completed the construc-
tion of Iolani Palace, the only home of 
royalty in the United States, which 
still stands today on the island of 
O’ahu. 
A 
man 
of 
science, 
King 
Kalakaua outfitted Iolani Palace with 
indoor plumbing, a telephone, and elec-
tric lights. Iolani Palace even had elec-
tricity before the White House. 
A patron of Hawaiian music and 
dance, Kalakaua is fondly known as 
the Merrie Monarch. In my hometown 
of Hilo, the annual Merrie Monarch 
Hula Festival is held in his honor and 
attracts thousands from around the 
globe. This year marks the festival’s 
60th anniversary. 
We are forever grateful to King David 
Kalakaua for inspiring the continu-
ation of our people and our Native Ha-
waiian culture.

BIDEN’S BORDER CRISIS 
(Ms. TENNEY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. TENNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to highlight the ongoing, unprec-
edented disaster that is occurring at 
our southern border and underscore the 
need for immediate action. 
In August, Customs and Border Pa-
trol agents encountered 203,597 illegal 
immigrants at our southern border. 
That was an increase of 307 percent 
compared to the last August of the 
Trump administration. 
This also put the U.S. at over 2 mil-
lion encounters for fiscal year 2022. 
This is the first time ever that we have 
eclipsed 2 million in a single fiscal 
year, and we have about 1 month to go. 
Despite all these facts, Vice Presi-
dent HARRIS said last week that the 
border is secure. If our so-called border 
czar thinks that this is secure, it is no 
wonder that we are continuing to see 
no viable options, and this problem 
continues to explode without a solu-
tion. 
The Biden administration must take 
swift and immediate action at the 
southern border. We must restart the 
border wall construction, invest in 
proven technologies, empower Customs 
and Border Patrol agents to enforce 
the law, and hire more Customs and 
Border Patrol agents to support the 
men and women who are already giving 
us honorable service there.

OPEN BORDER IS A NATIONAL 
SECURITY CRISIS 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, last week, Vice Presi-
dent HARRIS bizarrely said the south-
ern border is secure. The reality is 
more threatening and absurd. 
Since Biden took office, over 3 mil-
lion illegal aliens have crossed. In Au-
gust alone, there were over 200,000 ille-
gal alien encounters. This is three 
times the illegal crossings compared to

the last August when Donald Trump 
was President. 
Dangerously, there are 66 trained 
murderers from the terrorist watch list 
that have crossed. Separately, half a 
million illegal aliens have invaded in 
the last year, admitted the Department 
of Homeland Security. 
Biden and the Democrats are respon-
sible for a national security crisis due 
to the open border, with American fam-
ilies at a greater risk of murderous at-
tacks than ever before. 
In conclusion, we will not forget 9/11.

stan to America. God bless Ukrainian

OF 
H.R.

PRESIDENTIAL 
ELECTION REFORM ACT 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, by di-
rection of the Committee on Rules, I 
call up House Resolution 1372 and ask 
for its immediate consideration. 
The Clerk read the resolution, as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 1372 
Resolved, That upon adoption of this reso-
lution it shall be in order to consider in the 
House the bill (H.R. 8873) to amend title 3, 
United States Code, to reform the process for 
the counting of electoral votes, and for other 
purposes. All points of order against consid-
eration of the bill are waived. The bill shall 
be considered as read. All points of order 
against provisions in the bill are waived. The 
previous question shall be considered as or-
dered on the bill and on any amendment 
thereto to final passage without intervening 
motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally 
divided and controlled by the chair and rank-
ing minority member of the Committee on 
House Administration or their respective 
designees; and (2) one motion to recommit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Maryland is recognized 
for 1 hour. 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, for 
the purpose of debate only, I yield the 
customary 30 minutes to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER), pending which I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
During consideration of this resolu-
tion, all time yielded is for the purpose 
of debate only. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Maryland? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
yesterday, 
the 
Rules Committee met and reported a 
rule, House Resolution 1372, providing 
for consideration of H.R. 8873, the Pres-
idential Election Reform Act, under a 
closed rule. 
The rule provides 1 hour of debate 
equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of 
the Committee on House Administra-
tion, as well as one motion to recom-
mit. 
This bipartisan legislation, brought 
forward by Ms. LOFGREN and Ms. CHE-
NEY of Wyoming, is the product of more 
than 2 years of work by the Committee 
on House Administration and more 
than a year and a half of deliberations 
and investigation by the January 6th 
Select Committee. 
The electoral college, of course, has 
been with us from the beginning of the 
Republic. In a sense, this is legislation 
America has been working on since 
1887, for the last 135 years, because that 
was the last time that Congress legis-
lated to try to lend statutory coher-
ence and legislative direction to the 
provisions of the Constitution gov-
erning the electoral college. 
The electoral college, as you know, 
Madam Speaker, is a Byzantine, com-
plex, and multifaceted institution, but 
it is clear, in the wake of the debacle of 
January 6, 2021, that we must mod-
ernize it, update it, and make it work 
as well as possible for as long as we 
have it. 
That is why both supporters of the 
electoral college system and those who 
would replace it with a national pop-
ular vote for President, and that is a 
camp I am in, a camp that represents 
around two-thirds of the American peo-
ple, are strongly supporting this legis-
lation and should be supporting this 
legislation in order to clarify the 
mechanisms of our Presidential elec-
tion process. 
First of all, this legislation reaffirms 
that the Vice President’s role at the 
count of the electoral college electors 
on January 6 is a ministerial role and 
does not include any substantive au-
thority to count or reject or dismiss or 
nullify or vaporize electoral college 
votes sent in by the States, nor does 
the Vice President have any inde-
pendent, substantive power to halt or 
delay the joint session or to return 
electoral college votes to the States. 
We believe there was never any ambi-
guity about that. Former President 
Trump was told there was no ambi-
guity about it by his own Vice Presi-
dent, by his White House counsel, by 
the Attorney General of the United 
States, yet insisted that there was 
some kind of ambiguity and wiggle 
room for the Vice President to step 
outside of his assigned constitutional 
role and simply declare the electoral 
college votes of certain States, includ-
ing Arizona, Georgia, and Pennsyl-
vania, null and void and return them to 
the legislatures of those States for 
some undefined further action. 
All of that is clearly outside the his-
tory of the electoral college and what 
is contemplated constitutionally. We 
clarify that in this legislation. 
Moreover, the current provisions in 
the Electoral Count Act governing ob-
jections brought forward to the receipt 
of electoral college votes from par-
ticular States would be changed in this 
legislation. 
Under the current rules, all it takes 
is a Member of the House and a Mem-
ber of the Senate to bring an objection

September 21, 2022 
to the receipt of electoral college votes 
from a State. That would be changed to 
a requirement, under this act, of one- 
third of the House and one-third of the 
Senate together raising an objection, 
obviously meaning that this could not 
be done for purely fanciful purposes. 
There would have to be a substantial 
body of Members in both Chambers 
who agree that there is a serious objec-
tion being made. 
By the way, the Senate proposal dif-
fers slightly in that they are sug-
gesting a one-fifth requirement on both 
sides as opposed to the one-third re-
quirement that is being advanced in 
this legislation. 
Furthermore, the rules in this stat-
ute define explicitly the constitutional 
grounds upon which an objection to 
electoral college votes can be made. 
These objections are limited to a very 
narrow set of discrete issues that are 
grounded in the constitutional text of 
the 12th Amendment or other parts of 
the Constitution, such as whether an 
elector has voted for two candidates 
from the elector’s own State, which is 
clearly in violation of the 12th Amend-
ment. 
The rules also clarify the denomi-
nator, or the method of calculating the 
whole number of electors that have 
been cast for the purpose of winning a 
Presidential election. 
Our counting rules would also clarify 
the applicable parliamentary procedure 
at the count, ensuring that strategic 
bad faith actors are unable to exploit 
procedural loopholes in an effort to 
delay or subvert the count. 
Confusion 
has 
plagued 
electoral 
counts in Congress at different points 
in our history, almost since the begin-
ning of the Republic. We are confident 
that under this bill, future counts will 
be far more orderly and ministerial in 
nature, even during controversial elec-
tions, and will act simply to certify the 
choice of the American people as ex-
pressed through the State elections, 
which is the full extent of Congress’ 
counting role under the Constitution. 
We want to make sure that Congress 
does not pretend to arrogate to itself 
the power to decide who is going to be 
the President. The role of Congress is 
simply to count the electoral college 
votes that have come in. Maybe if I get 
a moment later, I can get into a little 
more specificity about the grounds for 
objection. 
There is also clarification of when a 
State’s Presidential election can be ex-
tended in case of a truly catastrophic 
event. Today’s Federal law allows a 
State legislature to appoint electors by 
itself if a State has had a failure to 
elect at its November election. That 
very vague provision is dangerous, dan-
gerously unclear, and it was targeted 
by former President Trump’s sup-
porters in 2020. 
Our 
legislation 
provides, 
instead, 
that voting in a State’s Presidential 
election can only be extended if a State 
experiences a genuinely catastrophic 
event, which we define specifically 
with respect to natural disasters and 
terrorist attacks and like calamities. 
The event must also be widespread 
enough to potentially affect the out-
come of the State’s election. All of this 
is mediated judicially by appearance 
before a Federal court. Any extension 
may only cover the area that was di-
rectly affected by the event, and any 
extension cannot last longer than 5 
days after election day. 
We know that a provision like this is, 
unfortunately, 
necessary. 
The 
Sep-
tember 11 terror attacks on America 
occurred on primary election day in 
New York City, and Hurricane Sandy 
in 2012 very nearly derailed New York 
and New Jersey’s Presidential elections 
that year. We are confident that our 
bill ensures that Federal law will ac-
count for unforeseen emergencies in fu-
ture Presidential elections. 
There are other provisions that I 
hope to get into in a little more detail, 
but I close, Madam Speaker, just by 
saying that this is an absolutely nec-
essary and urgent update of the Elec-
toral Count Act, which hasn’t been 
touched since 1887. 
We saw in January 2021 how some of 
the imperfections in the current proc-
ess can be exploited by actors who are 
determined to derail the electoral col-
lege counting process or, indeed, over-
throw the whole election. We want to 
do whatever we can, within the con-
fines of the electoral college system, in 
this legislation to improve the situa-
tion and to prepare for the next Presi-
dential election. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
b 1230 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank the distinguished gen-
tleman and my good friend from Mary-
land for yielding me the customary 30 
minutes, and I yield myself such time 
as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, the rule before us 
today provides for consideration of 
H.R. 8873, which—let’s just call it what 
it is—this is a partisan messaging bill 
from my friends across the aisle. 
My colleagues want to ram this bill 
through Congress to change the way 
Presidential elections are conducted. 
H.R. 8873 is attempting to reform the 
Electoral Count Act for the first time 
since 1887. This is the first time in 135 
years we are taking a look at this. Yet, 
despite that, no hearings were held on 
this bill, and the text was introduced 
just a mere 24 hours before it was pre-
sented in the Rules Committee yester-
day. 
During testimony before the Rules 
Committee, the sponsor of the bill, 
Chair LOFGREN, mentioned repeatedly 
the lengthy process they undertook to 
draft this bill, including consulting the 
country’s leading so-called experts. 
Yet, she did not bother to bring this 
legislation before her own committee 
for consideration. 
Given the majority’s constant claims 
of democracy itself being under attack, 
one would think that the Democratic 
Party and my colleagues across the 
aisle would bring bills through the ap-
propriate channels and mechanisms. 
But my colleagues across the aisle will 
also try to tell you that this bill is a 
reform, it is a reaction to the objec-
tions to certifying the 2020 election. 
However, both sides of the aisle have 
long used their legal authority to ob-
ject to Presidential elections. 
Notable individuals that have exer-
cised this authority include no other 
than 
Hillary 
Clinton, 
Joe 
Biden, 
KAMALA
HARRIS, NANCY
PELOSI—and 
that is just to name a few. 
Again, they have all used this au-
thority to object to Presidential elec-
tions. Even our distinguished chairman 
of the Committee on Rules, and some-
one I consider a good friend, objected 
to the 2016 elections. My other Rules 
Committee colleague and good friend 
from Maryland also objected. 
In fact, following the 2016 election, 
Democrats objected to certifying the 
electoral votes of more States than Re-
publicans did in 2021. 
Following 
her 
loss 
to 
President 
Trump, Hillary Clinton continued to 
attack the integrity of our democratic 
process by insisting ad nauseam that 
President Trump was, ‘‘an illegitimate 
President.’’ 
Stacey Abrams—another great exam-
ple—the current Georgia Democratic 
gubernatorial nominee, has built a na-
tional brand on denying election re-
sults and making baseless accusations 
of suppression and voter fraud. She 
claimed that she won the 2018 election 
for Governor and has yet to concede 
the 2018 race. 
But we can go all the way back to 
2005. Democrats objected in that year 
to certifying Ohio’s electoral votes 
with Senator Barbara Boxer joining 
Representative Stephanie Tubbs Jones 
to require a vote. 
Madam Speaker, 31 Members of the 
House voted against certifying these 
results; 12 of whom are still in Con-
gress today, and I presume those 12 are 
now supporting this legislation, hypo-
critically. But this precedent goes back 
even further than 2005 and 2001. 
We can take this back to 1961 with 
President John F. Kennedy. JFK—this 
is a great history lesson—drafted his 
own secret slate of electors declaring 
himself the winner of Hawaii’s elec-
toral votes when the State was origi-
nally called for Richard Nixon. 
Let’s just talk about today. Despite 
the history, today, the actual purpose 
of this bill is nothing more than an at-
tempt to federalize our elections. This 
is a way to backdoor H.R. 1 into legis-
lation. 
This is nothing more than an attack 
on President Trump and the 2020 elec-
tion, an attack on a man who has not 
been in office for nearly 2 years. This is 
about giving Congress unprecedented 
authority on how to interpret State 
law, how to restrict State discretion, 
and how to impose control on State 
election officials.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H8024 
September 21, 2022 
Madam Speaker, for those reasons, I 
urge my colleagues to oppose this rule. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I was delighted to 
hear my friend offer those comments. I 
am afraid I don’t really understand his 
objection to this legislation. He says 
we are trying to ram this through. 
After 135 years of doing nothing about 
the Electoral Count Act, I guess you 
have to be a true conservative to see 
135 years as moving too quickly in re-
forming the provisions of this very 
opaque, and in places, vague and in-
scrutable language. 
But in any event, the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania argues there have 
been times that Members of both par-
ties have raised objections in the past. 
That is absolutely right. Both Repub-
licans and Democrats have made objec-
tions on the floor in the past. Obvi-
ously, none of the objections attributed 
to those on our side had anything to do 
with a violent assault on the institu-
tions of the country or an attempt to 
get the Vice President to step outside 
of his constitutional role, or other ef-
forts to conduct what has been called a 
political coup in the country. 
In any event, the gentleman is cor-
rect that there have been a lot of objec-
tions raised. If that is your problem, 
then you should be absolutely sup-
porting this legislation because we are 
proposing to go from a situation where 
any single Member can raise an objec-
tion if he or she can get a Senator to 
join them, to a situation where you 
need a third of the entire House of Rep-
resentatives and a third of the entire 
U.S. Senate before an objection can be 
raised. The objections can be raised 
only according to very specific con-
stitutional criteria. They have to be 
grounded in the text of the Constitu-
tion. 
For example, if a State has not been 
admitted yet, and yet is purporting to 
offer electors, that would be grounds 
for rejecting it and for adjusting the 
denominator. If there are attempts by 
electors to vote for two people from the 
same State, which is clearly in viola-
tion of the 12th Amendment, then that 
would be rejected. 
Right now, anybody can object for 
any reason he or she wants. There were 
people in 2021 who were running around 
talking about precinct problems in par-
ticular States or claims of votes ap-
pearing in the middle of the night. 
Now, there was nothing to any of 
those. More than 60 Federal and State 
courts rejected every claim of electoral 
fraud and corruption. But in any event, 
that is not the job of the House of Rep-
resentatives to be out trying to police 
the counting of ballots in Pennsylvania 
or Arizona or Georgia, or any other 
State. 
All we are supposed to do is take the 
certificate of ascertainment that is 
provided by the Governor based on the 
State legislature’s determination of 
what the vote is in the casting of the 
electors from the State. So once that 
certificate of ascertainment comes in, 
our job is to accept it. 
Now, if someone tries to not comply 
with what the will of the State really 
was—say, if a Governor says I disagree 
with how the people voted, I am not 
going to turn it in—then that person 
can be taken to court by one of the 
Presidential candidates, or both, or all 
of the Presidential candidates, and can 
be ordered to comply with the political 
will of the people of the State. If the 
Governor still refuses to do it, then the 
Court is empowered to give it to an-
other appropriate official like the Sec-
retary of State, who would then have 
the authority to file the certificate of 
ascertainment with the Congress of the 
United States and with the archivist. 
So what we are trying to do is take, 
shall we say, an antique kind of instru-
ment, the electoral college, and we are 
trying to bring it up to date, so it 
works for us in America in the 21st 
century. If your objection is it is too 
easy for people of any party to object, 
I think you totally should be sup-
porting this legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Massachusetts 
(Mr. 
MCGOVERN), 
the 
very 
distin-
guished chairman of the Committee on 
Rules, who I should say was very much 
with us on January 6. He was there 
that night. He was the last person at 
the dais before we were forced to evac-
uate from the Chamber. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, 
my colleague from Pennsylvania men-
tioned me by name in his speech. And 
I just want to say, because I think it is 
important to clear things up, please do 
not compare my objections or the ob-
jections of others in the past to what 
happened on January 6. It is insulting. 
Our objections were symbolic. What 
happened on January 6 was violent. It 
was an attempt to overthrow the gov-
ernment of the United States of Amer-
ica. It was an attempt to basically 
overturn the will of the American peo-
ple. 
Madam Speaker, we are here today 
because democracy faces a crisis of le-
gitimacy, not just here at home, but 
around the world. 
According to Freedom House, 2021 
was the 16th consecutive year in which 
more countries declined in freedom 
than gained. Democracy’s reach has 
ebbed and flowed through the decades, 
but it is clear that right now we are in 
a democratic recession. 
More countries are turning toward 
authoritarianism 
than 
ever 
before. 
Countries we had thought were free are 
losing ground. Even the United States, 
the global bastion of democracy, has 
been labeled a backsliding democracy 
for the first time our history. This fact 
alone should set off alarm bells in all 
of our heads. 
I have seen what happens when de-
mocracies fall, and I have seen the 
good that can come when the United 
States 
upholds 
democratic 
values 
around the world. 
We can’t preach democracy abroad 
when democracy is under attack at 
home. Because the deal is, there are 
people sowing the narrative that de-
mocracies cannot handle the problems 
of this century. There are people who 
advocate for authoritarian regimes 
that ignore the will of the people. In 
the global struggle between democracy 
and autocracy, these bad actors are a 
cold reminder that it isn’t inevitable 
that democracy prevails. We have to 
fight like hell to make sure that it 
does. 
Madam Speaker, all this is to say 
that the world is watching what we do 
here today. We have to make a choice, 
and if we make the wrong one, the con-
sequences will be grave. No one is com-
ing to save us. We have to save our-
selves. 
The Presidential Elections Reform 
Act addresses some serious issues with 
our Presidential elections. It used to be 
that our leaders would respect the will 
of the voters—win or lose. In a func-
tional democracy, that is how it works. 
But now, people who don’t like the re-
sults of an election feel empowered to 
lie and reject those results—sometimes 
violently. 
The dismantling of our democracy 
won’t happen all at once; it will con-
tinue to erode bit by bit until one day 
we will look around and see that it is 
too late. And the thing is, it starts 
with the elections. 
Our elections are the keystone of our 
democracy. They are how the will of 
the people becomes the action of the 
government. We have a responsibility 
to shore up the institutions of our de-
mocracy against the forces that seek 
to erode them. 
The Presidential Election Reform 
Act gives us the opportunity to do just 
that. 
This bill is about strengthening de-
mocracy, prohibiting election officials 
from refusing to certify elections, 
clarifying that the Vice President can’t 
just 
throw 
away 
electoral 
college 
votes, ensuring States only send one 
accurate election certificate to Con-
gress so we don’t see illegal, fraudulent 
slates of electors like we did in 2020. 
These reforms will strengthen our 
elections and breathe life into our 
democratic 
institutions. 
Perhaps 
equally as important, they will send a 
signal to the world that American de-
mocracy is more resilient than the 
forces that seek to subvert it. 
Madam Speaker, I know that some-
times when we talk about things like 
democracy or democratic institutions, 
it sounds abstract and lofty. Let me be 
perfectly clear. There is nothing ab-
stract about this. 
If we cannot ensure free and fair elec-
tions, we cannot ensure a free and fair 
society. We have to ask ourselves 
whether we believe our country should 
be governed with force or with consent. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I yield 
an additional 30 seconds to the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H8025 
September 21, 2022 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, 
our government cannot work and our 
democracy cannot survive if we fall on 
different sides of this question. The 
choice we make matters. What we do 
here today matters. 
This should not be partisan; it should 
not be controversial. We all have a 
stake when it comes to the survival of 
our democracy. If you believe that free-
dom and democracy are worth it and 
you believe in the promise of what 
America can be, I implore you to vote 
in favor of the Presidential Election 
Reform Act. 
Vote like the future of our democ-
racy depends on this bill, because it 
does. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I would remind my 
colleague and good friend from Massa-
chusetts that he objected to Alabama 
in 2017, just like my good friend from 
Maryland objected in 2017 to Florida. 
Now, as far as this bill being rammed 
through, I would take a minute to 
rebut the accusation that it hasn’t 
been rammed through. It absolutely 
was. 
We were given almost exactly 24 
hours to look at this bill before it came 
to the Committee on Rules. When we 
had the hearing in the Committee on 
Rules, to my knowledge, that was the 
only hearing that we have had in the 
House because Chair LOFGREN didn’t 
even have the foresight or the willing-
ness to take this through her own com-
mittee process, her own committee 
that she chairs. 
So I am just saying let’s follow the 
process. And let’s be frank about some-
thing. If this bill were just about in-
creasing the number of necessary ob-
jectors to one-third in this Chamber 
and one-third in the other Chamber, it 
might have a chance of passing with bi-
partisan support. But that is not what 
this bill does. This bill is a backdoor 
for H.R. 1. 
b 1245 
Let me just give you a few examples 
of extra material in this bill that 
makes it unpalatable. 
This bill allows for Presidential can-
didates to sue to extend the voting pe-
riod, even after polls have closed, due 
to 
a 
broadly 
defined 
catastrophic 
event. Then a panel of Federal judges, 
not State election officials, are then 
responsible for deciding whether States 
must allow for up to 5 additional days 
of voting. The real kicker here is that 
this suit must be filed no more than 1 
day after the election. So you can see 
how a ‘‘catastrophic event’’ would 
probably be any Democrat that is los-
ing on the night of the election. 
Rather than working with Repub-
licans in a bipartisan manner on a 
skinny form of an actual reform bill, 
House Democrats and the January 6 
committee are desperately trying to 
score cheap political points on a bill 
that does nothing to improve the Elec-
toral Count Act and does everything to 
take away constitutional and State 
sovereignty over elections. 
Let’s be blunt about something else. 
The American people don’t care about 
this, especially when they are dealing 
with catastrophe after catastrophe and 
failed policy after failed policy of this 
administration. So while House Demo-
crats are focusing on a partisan mes-
saging bill that has zero chance of ac-
tually becoming law, our southern bor-
der just hit a record 2 million border 
crossings this fiscal year. That is the 
highest amount ever recorded in a sin-
gle year. 
Meanwhile, for the past year-and-a- 
half, the Biden administration has been 
transporting illegal immigrants from 
the southern border to places all over 
the country, often in the dead of night, 
and with zero notification to elected 
officials. 
That is why if we defeat the previous 
question, I will personally offer an 
amendment to the rule immediately to 
consider H.R. 6592, the Immigration 
Transparency and Transit Notification 
Act of 2022. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to insert the text of my 
amendment in the RECORD, along with 
any extraneous material, immediately 
prior to the vote on the previous ques-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
MEUSER), my good friend, who is here 
to explain more on this amendment. 
Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my good friend from Pennsyl-
vania for his leadership and for his sup-
port of this commonsense legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I do rise to oppose 
the previous question so that we may 
immediately consider my bill, H.R. 
6592, the Immigration Transparency 
and Transit Notification Act, which 
would 
provide 
much-needed 
trans-
parency for the secret immigration 
flights sent by the Biden administra-
tion to my hometown and to commu-
nities across, primarily, rural America. 
Thanks to their open border policies, 
the Biden administration has been 
sending hundreds of flights full of ille-
gal immigrants into American commu-
nities, often in the dead of night. Over 
the last year-and-a-half, these flights 
have been landing in towns across 
America, placing thousands of illegal 
immigrants into communities with no 
prior notice, yet no one has flinched, 
no mainstream media attention, no 
outrage from the podium at the White 
House or Democrats in this House. 
Now that Chicago, Washington, D.C., 
and Martha’s Vineyard have received 
flights, now it has become a seemingly 
national crisis. 
Remember, the Biden administration 
was flying thousands of these illegals 
secretly to middle America for well 
over a year now, and no one has batted 
an eye. 
Sanctuary cities and States offering 
benefits to illegal immigrants and the 
open border rhetoric from the Biden 
administration continue to induce ille-
gal immigration and likely violates 
Title 8 of the U.S. Code. 
Republicans have endlessly called on 
the Biden administration and my col-
leagues in this House, Democrat col-
leagues, to secure our border and ulti-
mately put an end to this practice of 
airdropping illegal immigrants into 
American communities. This should 
not be a partisan issue. 
I became aware of these flights in my 
area only from local whistleblowers at 
our local airport. I engaged in good 
faith with DHS and HHS and was met 
with nothing but nontruths and empty 
promises. We were first told no illegals 
were being flown into Pennsylvania. 
This, of course, turned out to be com-
pletely untrue. I saw it with my own 
eyes. 
I was also told that it was just a co-
incidence these flights were coming in 
at 2 o’clock in the morning into remote 
rural airports. One flight was around 
midnight on Christmas night. 
After these meetings, I was told that 
I would receive notification of future 
flights. No such notifications were ever 
received, yet the flights continued. 
At this point, I introduced this re-
sponsible piece of legislation to bring 
transparency, accountability, and de-
cency, and local help and support to 
the situation. 
The current situation at our border 
is not humane. Millions of illegals are 
enduring a treacherous journey, as we 
all know, facing perilous conditions, 
assault, rape, and death, all because 
the Biden administration’s words and 
actions, and that of the cartels cer-
tainly, that we allow to exist, have led 
them to believe that they can come. 
This is not humane, Madam Speaker. 
Nothing about the Biden administra-
tion’s border policy is. When such 
illegals arrive on ghost flights, as men-
tioned, in these communities, no one 
on the ground has any idea where they 
are coming from or where they are 
going. 
In addition to all of this, we have 
deadly drugs like fentanyl pouring 
across the border, killing over 100,000 
Americans just in the past year. 
The cartels are getting rich as mi-
grants are giving away their life sav-
ings under the pretense set out by the 
Biden administration that they are 
welcomed here. The illegals are not to 
blame for making this journey. It is 
the cartels and the Biden administra-
tion’s encouraging them who are to 
blame. The false message is out: Show 
up to our border and all will be fine. 
As a result, our border is overrun and 
border communities and others across 
the country—yes, even now Martha’s 
Vineyard—are now feeling the effects 
of this. It needs to stop. 
Of course, if our southern border is 
secured, there would be no need for

such ghost flights to take place. Effec-
tive border policy should be fully im-
plemented. Catch and release must end. 
Our border must be secured. 
Until these policies change and our 
border is secured, I offer this legisla-
tion to bring accountability and trans-
parency to these flights and ensure 
American communities are properly in-
formed, ensure that the sponsor is le-
gitimate and verified and safe, that we 
are not aiding and abetting human 
trafficking, and we give the State’s 
Governor the authority to approve 
flights and determine if they have the 
means to provide the support nec-
essary. 
The schools should also be notified, 
Madam Speaker. How is it when 10 
young children here illegally, who do 
not speak English, show up at a school 
district on a Monday morning, without 
notification? It is wrong. It is a ter-
rible shame that it took flights to lib-
eral enclaves like New York, Chicago, 
D.C., and Martha’s Vineyard for this to 
be taken seriously and receive the at-
tention that it finally deserves. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield an additional 30 sec-
onds to the gentleman from Pennsyl-
vania. 
Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, our 
border must be secured. I think I am 
making my point. 
Until then, this bill will bring order 
and transparency to this practice. I 
hope my Democrat colleagues are truly 
outraged by some of these practices, as 
I have outlined. I urge them to join me 
in defeating the previous question in 
support of my bill. In doing so, we will 
address the reality that so many com-
munities across America have been fac-
ing for nearly 2 years. Let’s act respon-
sibly. 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, we are here to for-
tify the integrity of American Presi-
dential elections, the process by which 
the people choose their own President. 
One can only regard with amazement 
the gentleman from Pennsylvania’s 
casual assurance that the American 
people don’t care about this. The 
American people don’t care about so-
lidifying the process by which we elect 
our own President? The American peo-
ple don’t care about whether or not a 
Presidential election is going to be sto-
len by a lot of backroom games and 
manipulation of the rules? I beg to dif-
fer. Even the Wall Street Journal 
today endorsed the legislation that we 
are bringing forward. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania 
(Ms. SCANLON), a very distinguished 
member of the Committee on Rules. 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I 
would reiterate Mr. RASKIN’s point that 
certainly the voters in Pennsylvania 
that I have heard from care deeply 
about whether or not their votes are 
counted. 
Madam Speaker, the Presidential 
Election Reform Act will reinforce one 
of the defining American characteris-
tics of our American experiment in de-
mocracy: the peaceful transition of 
Presidential power. 
It is critical to that experiment that 
Americans have faith that our leaders 
will honor the will of the people when 
they vote. The process of counting and 
transmitting votes is a question of pro-
cedure and should not be treated as an 
opportunity to manipulate the out-
come of a free and fair election as it 
was in the wake of the 2020 election. 
I am heartened that the legislation 
under consideration today is a bipar-
tisan bill. I don’t care if you are a 
Democrat, a Republican, a conserv-
ative, a liberal, an Independent. If you 
love this country and believe in a gov-
ernment by the people, for the people, 
and of the people, we all have an obli-
gation to confront the dangers posed 
by antidemocratic agents who try to 
undermine our elections, abandoning 
the rule of law and the peaceful trans-
fer of power for their own personal or 
political gain. 
I regret that we must bring this bill 
to strengthen the guardrails of our de-
mocracy after the subversive actions of 
the disgraced former President and his 
supporters threatened to derail our 
government entirely. 
But we must confront those con-
tinuing threats to our electoral sys-
tem, in Pennsylvania and across the 
Nation, where bad actors continue to 
promote lies about election security. 
To be clear, there was never justifica-
tion for the efforts to overturn the 2020 
election. But bad actors lied about the 
election results and willfully misinter-
preted the law, and Members of the 
former President’s party, whether ex-
plicitly or by their silence, continue to 
support these lies and baseless legal 
challenges. 
These tactics demand the bipartisan 
set of reforms we are considering today 
to insulate our democracy from dema-
goguery. 
I look forward to working with my 
colleagues of all political stripes to 
strengthen the guardrails of our de-
mocracy and to support and defend the 
Constitution. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I can tell you that 
in my area of Pennsylvania, nobody is 
talking about this. What they are talk-
ing about is failed economic policy, 
failure to support law enforcement, 
which is leading to both inflation, eco-
nomic hardship, and some of the high-
est crime rates we have ever seen on 
record. 
I would implore my colleagues across 
the aisle to actually talk to real Amer-
icans, not just the woke yuppies that 
comprise their voting base, to see what 
Americans care about. But something 
tells me that the American people will 
say loud and clear what they care 
about come November. 
It is also rich hearing about all of 
these ‘‘assaults on democracy.’’ Let’s 
just go back to 2019. In 2019, Hillary 
Clinton said: ‘‘No, it doesn’t kill me, 
because he knows’’—meaning Trump— 
‘‘that he is an illegitimate President.’’ 
So you have the former Presidential 
candidate calling the former President 
an illegitimate President. That is 
clearly echoing some of the sentiments 
that my friends across the aisle are 
now accusing us of doing. 
ADAM SCHIFF, for example, my col-
league from California, in his opening 
statement for the Senate’s January 
2020 impeachment trial said: ‘‘The 
President’s misconduct cannot be de-
cided at the ballot box, for we cannot 
be assured that the vote will be fairly 
won.’’ How about that for criticizing 
and questioning the democratic proc-
ess? 
Representative John Lewis, in 2017, 
said: ‘‘I don’t see this President-elect 
as a legitimate President. I think the 
Russians participated in helping this 
man get elected, and they helped de-
stroy the candidacy of Hillary Clin-
ton.’’ That was a baseless claim based 
on the Steele dossier that was discred-
ited. 
Representative JERRY MCNERNEY of 
California, in 2017: ‘‘The election of Mr. 
Trump lacks legitimacy.’’ 
VICENTE GONZALEZ of Texas, just this 
month—this isn’t even the last Presi-
dential election cycle. This was this 
month, regarding a special election. 
This month, when discussing MAYRA 
FLORES’ upset victory in his upcoming 
election against her, said: ‘‘They stole 
that last election.’’ So it is quite rich 
hearing all of these accusations now 
coming from my friends across the 
aisle. 
When we call into question election 
results, it is somehow a threat to de-
mocracy. When they do it, they are 
magically upholding democracy. 
But it just doesn’t stop with my 
friends across the aisle here in this 
Chamber. Let’s talk about KAMALA 
HARRIS. She agreed with the radio show 
host that she should be concerned over 
Trump’s legitimacy. She said: ‘‘We 
should believe exactly what the intel-
ligence community has told us, which 
is Russia did interfere in the election 
of the President in 2017.’’ That is the 
now Vice President saying that. 
Also, it is absolutely rich that she 
cites 
the 
intelligence 
community, 
when they knew the Steele dossier was 
a product of the Hillary Clinton cam-
paign; the same intelligence commu-
nity that wasn’t able to discern that 
the Russian interference story was a 
hoax; the same intelligence community 
that told us that the Hunter Biden 
laptop was Russian disinformation, de-
spite knowing that the FBI had that 
laptop in their possession at the time 
they made that baseless accusation; 
the same intel community, by the way, 
that told us that Kabul would stand 
strong for months on end and Ukraine 
would fall within hours. So that is the 
intel 
community 
that 
my 
friends 
across the aisle are citing.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H8027 
September 21, 2022 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
GARBARINO), my good friend, to speak 
more on the issue of immigration and 
transparency. 
b 1300 
Mr. GARBARINO. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to urge the defeat of the pre-
vious question so that we can imme-
diately consider H.R. 6592, the Immi-
gration Transparency and Transit No-
tification Act of 2022. 
The crisis at our southern border is a 
threat to our national security, public 
safety, and public health. While this 
administration continues to tell the 
American people that all is well, 
fentanyl, the number one killer of 
young people in America, has flooded 
across the border at record rates; drug 
smugglers and human traffickers are 
thriving; and the migrants themselves 
are facing dire conditions all because 
President Biden told them it was okay 
to come here illegally. 
Since Joe Biden took office, over 1 
million 
undocumented 
immigrants 
have been allowed to resettle here. 
Long before border State Governors 
started busing migrants to sanctuary 
cities so they might share the burden 
of this crisis, President Biden was put-
ting them on flights and buses in the 
dead of night and sending them to com-
munities far north of the border with-
out a warning to the people who live 
there or the officials who would be-
come responsible for them. 
The New York Post first exposed se-
cret, dead-of-the-night flights of mi-
grants into Westchester, New York, 
last year. But to date, the administra-
tion has refused all requests for trans-
parency and accountability regarding 
these resettlements, this despite mul-
tiple letters from myself and other 
Members of Congress requesting that 
they stop these covert flights and pro-
vide information to Congress and local 
officials about who these migrants are 
and what vetting they received before 
being dropped off in our communities. 
H.R. 6592 would require officials to be 
notified before undocumented immi-
grants may be placed in their jurisdic-
tion and would provide Governors with 
the authority to refuse placement. 
We cannot continue to turn a blind 
eye to the border crisis or the strain 
that these relocations are placing on 
communities across the country. 
Madam Speaker, I urge this body to 
act and immediately consider H.R. 6592 
to require transparency and account-
ability of the administration for the re-
location of undocumented immigrants 
throughout the United States and put 
the power to oversee these relocations 
in the hands of people in these commu-
nities which are most affected by it. 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I just 
want to quickly point out the false 
equivalency just invoked by the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania. 
On the one hand, you have people of 
both political parties pointing out the 
100 percent documented interference of 
Vladimir Putin in our 2016 Presidential 
election, with millions and millions of 
dollars spent on his so-called Internet 
Research Agency to engage in cyber 
surveillance, 
cyber 
espionage, 
and 
cyber sabotage of our election. On the 
other side, we have a violent insurrec-
tion incited by the President of the 
United States, where 150 of our officers 
were wounded and injured, ending up 
with broken arms, legs, jaws, and 
necks; concussions; contusions; and 
traumatic brain injury. 
Those are two very different things. 
One is an exercise of people’s First 
Amendment right to speak. The other 
is a violent effort to overthrow the 
electoral process and the constitu-
tional order of the United States. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the very distinguished gentleman from 
California (Mr. GARAMENDI). 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, 
on January 6, America witnessed the 
first and most serious attempt since 
the Civil War to stop our democracy. It 
was an insurrection engineered by the 
then-President, Donald Trump, so that 
he could put forth a coup and remain in 
power. It did not succeed. 
We came here that night over blood- 
stained floors and smashed doors and 
windows, and we voted. We voted to 
put in place the will of the voters of 
America to transfer power. Fortu-
nately, the attempt by the President 
was unsuccessful. 
Nevertheless, in Hollywood, there is 
always a sequel, often to a very bad 
movie. We are headed for a new sequel 
in 2024. Unless we change the 1887 Elec-
toral Count Act, we will see a sequel. 
We know, all across this Nation, that it 
is being set up. 
There are candidates running for 
critical offices—secretaries of state, 
various county offices—with the intent 
to use the 1887 Electoral Count Act to 
put in place a sequel to the January 6, 
2021, violent insurrection. It is in place 
now. It is an attempt happening now to 
have a new coup, to use the 1887 law. 
We must pass this bill. We must 
change the law. It is ancient. It has al-
ready been proven by January 6 and 
the attempted coup then to use that 
law to install in the Presidency a per-
son who was not legitimately elected 
by the people of America. 
We have to do this. It is our task. It 
is our work, and this bill does it. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I have a lot of respect and ad-
miration for my good friend from Cali-
fornia, and he knows that. But if you 
want to talk about sequels, let’s just 
talk about all the times the Democrats 
objected to election results. We can go 
all the way back for decades. 
Many Democrats, including Hillary 
Clinton, 
BARBARA
LEE, 
MAXINE 
WATERS, and SHEILA JACKSON LEE, have 
cast doubt on every single Republican 
Presidential victory in the last two 
decades. In fact, every single Democrat 
President since 1977 has cast doubt on 
the legitimacy of U.S. elections. 
I will just go through some of that 
because my good friend from California 
said this looks like a sequel to a bad 
movie. Let’s just look at the current 
administration. In both 2013 and 2016, 
Biden claimed that Gore won the 2000 
Presidential election. In May 2019, 
Biden said that he ‘‘absolutely’’ agrees 
that Trump is an ‘‘illegitimate Presi-
dent.’’ That is the current Democratic 
President casting doubt on elections. 
It doesn’t stop with him, though. 
Let’s again go to his Vice President, 
KAMALA
HARRIS. In 2019, the Vice 
President agreed that Trump was an il-
legitimate President. 
It is just not those that were elected 
to office. Let’s look at key senior staff-
ers. 
For nearly two decades, Biden Chief 
of Staff Ron Klain claimed that Al 
Gore won the 2000 election. 
President Biden’s press secretary, 
Karine Jean-Pierre, tweeted that the 
2018 Georgia gubernatorial race was 
stolen. Jean-Pierre also cast doubt just 
not on that election but also on the 
2016 election by tweeting: ‘‘Stolen elec-
tion, 
welcome 
to 
the 
world 
of 
#unpresidented Trump.’’ 
Jamal Simmons, the communica-
tions director for KAMALA HARRIS, for 
years tweeted that Bush had stolen the 
2000 election. 
Then-Representative Marcia Fudge of 
Ohio, now the HUD Secretary, said 
that Trump ‘‘may not be a legitimate 
President.’’ 
If you are talking about sequels to 
bad movies, this goes all the way back 
to the 1970s, when my friends across 
the aisle undermined faith in our elec-
tions by loose talk and baseless claims 
that elections were stolen. 
I will end the list of quotes with this 
because it is my good friend from 
Maryland. In 2002, my friend from 
Maryland wrote that the Supreme 
Court had ‘‘[frozen] the election re-
sults’’ in an ‘‘outrageous assault on de-
mocracy,’’ saying that the Court had 
determined the outcome of a Presi-
dential election. 
In 2003, my good friend also called 
Bush America’s first ‘‘court-appointed 
President.’’ 
I have a litany of other quotes from 
my friends across the aisle, not only 
current Members serving in this Cham-
ber but also well-known Democrats 
from across the United States that 
have questioned results of elections. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the very distinguished 
gentleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
SCHIFF), my friend. 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of the Presidential Election 
Reform Act, but first, let me respond 
to my colleague from Pennsylvania, 
who partially quoted me in the first 
impeachment trial. 
I did, in fact, predict that if the 
former President was not held account-
able for trying to extort Ukraine by 
withholding 
military 
aid 
to 
get 
Ukraine’s help to cheat in the election 
that he would go on to try to cheat in

even new and worse ways in the upcom-
ing election. In fact, I believe I said 
that the odds were not 5 percent, not 10 
percent, not even 50 percent, but 100 
percent that he would go on to try to 
cheat again. In that, sadly, I was all 
too correct. 
Over the last year, the House Select 
Committee to Investigate the January 
6th Attack on the United States Cap-
itol has conducted a thorough inves-
tigation into the multiple lines of ef-
fort by President Trump and his allies 
to overturn the election, efforts that 
included a pressure campaign against 
the Vice President to violate the Con-
stitution and assume powers he does 
not hold to unilaterally reject valid 
electoral count votes. 
Our democracy held, but barely. 
These events have revealed underlying 
vulnerabilities to our democracy, vul-
nerabilities that could be exploited in a 
future Presidential election. 
This bill will help ensure that the 
will of the American people, as ex-
pressed through their votes, cannot be 
overturned by any official of any polit-
ical party at any time or for any pur-
pose. 
Consistent with the Constitution, it 
raises the threshold for challenging a 
slate of electors during a joint session 
of Congress. It reaffirms the role of the 
presiding officer, that it is a ministe-
rial one. Perhaps most important, it af-
firms 
that 
State 
officials 
cannot 
change the rules of an election after 
the fact in an effort to overturn the 
will of the people, as expressed through 
their popular vote. 
This bill will help ensure that the 
cornerstone of our democracy, free and 
fair elections and the peaceful transfer 
of power, remains in place for future 
generations of Americans. This is not a 
partisan task but a patriotic one. 
Over the past several months, we 
have told the story of what happened 
on January 6, documenting the events 
for the American people. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I yield 
an additional 15 seconds to the gen-
tleman. 
Mr. SCHIFF. Now is the time for our 
committee and this Congress to look to 
the future. It is my hope that this leg-
islation becomes one of the most sig-
nificant pieces of our legacy, that it 
makes our Constitution, our country, 
and our democracy stronger and more 
secure. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time to close. 
Madam Speaker, inflation is at the 
highest rate in over 40 years, literally 
the highest rate since I have been 
alive. The majority of American work-
ers confirmed their income has fallen 
behind the rising cost of things like 
buying groceries, paying utility bills, 
and just filling up their gas tanks. 
We have set a record for the highest 
illegal border crossings in 1 year, in-
cluding 78 individuals on the FBI’s ter-
rorist watch list. 
So far in 2022, homicide rates have in-
creased roughly 50 percent compared to 
this time in 2019. 
The Federal Government is also set 
to run out of funding in 9 days, yet 
here we are, focused for the second 
week in a row on trying to attack 
President Trump, a President that 
hasn’t been in office for nearly 2 years. 
That is how we are spending our time. 
House Democrats have chosen once 
again to put on yet another partisan, 
political show while the American peo-
ple are at home suffering the con-
sequences of their failed agenda, suf-
fering the consequences of inflation 
that is out of control, wages that are 
dropping, energy costs that are sky-
rocketing, and crime rates that are 
making them less safe in their commu-
nities. 
H.R. 8873 tramples on States’ rights 
and would do serious harm to the in-
tegrity of our elections. 
Madam Speaker, for these reasons, I 
urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the 
previous question and ‘‘no’’ on the rule, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, to my dear friend 
from Pennsylvania, if you think that 
this legislation is an attack on Presi-
dent Trump, you simply haven’t read 
the legislation because there is nothing 
in there attacking President Trump. 
This is about reforming the Electoral 
Count Act so it works for the American 
people. 
As long as we are going to have the 
electoral college, we must update it 
and modernize it to make it work and 
to make sure that the will of the peo-
ple is vindicated at every level—at the 
State level, with the Governor who has 
to provide the certificate of ascertain-
ment; and then, when it comes here, we 
have to be able to receive it and not 
have the Presidential electoral process 
consumed by a bunch of ideological an-
tics and tantrums. 
My friend mobilizes a number of epi-
sodes of Democrats raising objections 
in the past. Of course, I could equal 
each one of those with Republicans 
raising objections in the past because 
this has become a fine bipartisan tradi-
tion in the history of the electoral col-
lege. But if you think it is too easy for 
people to get up and object, support 
our legislation because we are saying 
you can’t make an objection until you 
get one-third of the House of Rep-
resentatives to sign the objection to 
attest to its validity and its substance. 
b 1315 
Then in order for it to be validated, 
you need not just a third of the House, 
you need a third of the Senate. You 
need bicameral adoption of the objec-
tion by a third of each body before it is 
even heard and then debated. So if you 
think that too much frivolous stuff is 
going on, well, then you should be sup-
porting our legislation. 
The rest of what you are saying is 
just complaint about political rhetoric, 
and I happen to like the political rhet-
oric pointing out that Vladimir Putin 
is an enemy of democracy not just in 
Ukraine but in the United States and 
all over the world. Maybe we disagree 
about that. I know that there are some 
cheerleaders for Vladimir Putin over 
on that side of the aisle. 
In any event, remember this: Today, 
you can object for any reason at all, 
and one person can get up and do it if 
they can find one other person in the 
other Chamber, but under this legisla-
tion, under the Presidential Election 
Reform Act there will be a neatly 
cabined set of approved constitutional 
objections, all of them grounded in the 
text of the Constitution: 
For example, if a State purports to 
submit more electoral college votes 
than they actually have. 
For example, an elector in the Presi-
dential 
election 
process 
constitu-
tionally cannot hold another Federal 
office, so if they hold another Federal 
office that will be grounds for an objec-
tion. 
For example, a President must be a 
natural-born citizen at least 35 years of 
age. So it would be a valid objection to 
claim that the candidate that a State 
is purporting to cast electors for is 
only 26 years old. 
Also, under section 3 of the 14th 
Amendment, 
Federal 
office 
holders 
must not be guilty of insurrection or 
rebellion against the Union; something 
that was insisted upon by the radical 
Republicans after the Civil War. There-
fore, that would be a legitimate ground 
for objection. 
Presidents are limited to two terms 
in office, so that would be a legitimate 
ground for objection if a State purports 
to cast electors for someone who has 
already served two terms in office. 
Under Article II, section 1, clause 4, 
and the 12th Amendment, electors 
must vote on the same day throughout 
the Nation distinctly by ballot for 
President and Vice President, one of 
whom must not be an inhabitant of the 
elector’s State. 
In other words, we finally have pro-
vided real precision and definiteness as 
to what is a valid objection. That 
doesn’t mean the objection is nec-
essarily ratified bicamerally by con-
current majorities, which is what you 
need in order to uphold it, but it is not 
a free-for-all. You can’t just start fin-
ger painting on it. 
To the extent that the gentleman’s 
only substantive objection I have heard 
is that in the past it has been too easy 
for Members of both parties to raise ob-
jections, then you should absolutely be 
supporting this legislation. 
This is a thorough legislative project 
that reflects the common sense and the 
wisdom of people who are the real ex-
perts in this field. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote 
on the rule and the previous question. 
The text of the material previously 
referred to by Mr. RESCHENTHALER is as 
follows: 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 1372

lowing:

CONGRESSIONAL BASKETBALL 
TEAM DEFEATS LOBBYISTS 
(Mr. WENSTRUP asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today with my teammates to recognize 
the accomplishments of the Congres-
sional Basketball Team. 
The Congressional Basketball Team 
won Monday’s 22nd Annual Congres-
sional Basketball game against a team 
of lobbyists. 
We ended a drought for the Members’ 
team going back to 2014. So we were 
due. We won 46–36 but most impor-
tantly, this event was sponsored by the 
Hoops for Youth Foundation, a not-for- 
profit organization that supports at- 
risk kids in our communities. 
The Hoops for Youth Foundation was 
founded with the mission of creating 
opportunities for at-risk kids through 
basketball. They work to teach kids 
that the skills they use on the basket-
ball court can be used every day in life 
to help them succeed. 
It is a fun game. We come together. 
We won in a nice bipartisan fashion. 
BLAKE MOORE was the MVP. He played 
an outstanding game, and we congratu-
late him for that. It was a great team 
effort. 
Madam Speaker, we say thank you to 
the non-profit that put this together 
for us and the success we had with rais-
ing money and having fun at the same 
time. 
Go team House of Representatives!

JOINT CONSOLIDATION LOAN 
SEPARATION ACT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. PIN-
GREE). Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, 
the unfinished business is the vote on 
the motion to commit on the bill (S. 
1098) to amend the Higher Education 
Act of 1965 to authorize borrowers to 
separate joint consolidation loans, of-
fered by the gentlewoman from North 
Carolina (Ms. FOXX), on which the yeas 
and nays were ordered. 
The Clerk will redesignate the mo-
tion. 
The Clerk redesignated the motion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion to commit. 
This will be a 5-minute vote. 
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 202, nays

PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION REFORM 
ACT 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, pur-
suant to House Resolution 1372, I call 
up the bill (H.R. 8873) to amend title 3, 
United States Code, to reform the proc-
ess for the counting of electoral votes, 
and for other purposes, and ask for its 
immediate consideration in the House. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1372, the bill is 
considered read. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 8873 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Presidential 
Election Reform Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Article II and the Twelfth Amendment 
to the Constitution govern how our Republic 
selects the President and Vice President of 
the United States. Article II provides that 
‘‘each state shall appoint, in such manner as 
the legislature may direct, a number of elec-
tors, equal to the whole number of Senators 
and Representatives to which the State may 
be entitled in the Congress.’’ (Constitution, 
article II, section 1, clause 2). Article II pro-
vides that Congress has the authority to reg-
ulate the timing of such elections by setting 
the ‘‘time’’ of the Presidential election and 
the ‘‘day’’ on which presidential electors 
cast their votes (Constitution, article II, sec-
tion 1, clause 4). The Twelfth Amendment 
identifies Congress’ responsibility for count-
ing electoral votes: ‘‘The President of the 
Senate shall, in the presence of the Senate 
and House of Representatives, open all the 
certificates and the votes shall then be 
counted. The person having the greatest 
number of votes for President, shall be the 
President, if such number be a majority of 
the whole number of Electors appointed.’’. 
Congress’ authorities in these respects are 
further bolstered by the Necessary and Prop-
er Clause of the Constitution (article I, sec-
tion 8, clause 18). 
(2) ‘‘On January 6, 2021, a mob professing 
support for then-President Trump violently 
attacked the United States Capitol in an ef-
fort to prevent a Joint Session of Congress 
from certifying the electoral college votes 
designating Joseph R. Biden the 46th Presi-
dent of the United States.’’ Trump v. Thomp-
son, 20 F.4th 10, 15 (D.C. Cir. 2021), cert. de-
nied, 142 S. Ct. 1350 (2022). This constituted 
‘‘the single most deadly attack on the Cap-
itol by domestic forces in the history of the 
United States.’’ Trump, 20 F.4th at 35. 
‘‘Then-Vice President Pence, Senators and 
Representatives were all forced to halt their 
constitutional duties and flee . . . for safe-
ty.’’ Id. at 16. ‘‘The events of January 6, 2021 
marked the most significant assault on the 
Capitol since the War of 1812.’’ Id. at 18–19. 
(3) The Electoral Count Act of 1887 should 
be amended to prevent other future unlawful 
efforts to overturn Presidential elections and 
to ensure future peaceful transfers of Presi-
dential power. 
(4) The reforms contained in this Act are 
fully consistent with States’ constitutional 
authority vested by Article II to appoint 
electors; the reforms herein do not restrict 
the mode in which States lawfully appoint 
their respective electors or resolve related 
contests or controversies, but instead ensure 
that those appointments, and the votes cast 
by those electors, are duly transmitted to 
Congress. 
SEC. 3. TIMING OF APPOINTING ELECTORS. 
Section 1 of title 3, United States Code, is 
amended— 
(1) by striking the period at the end and in-
serting ‘‘, in accordance with State laws duly 
enacted prior to such day.’’; and 
(2) by striking ‘‘in every fourth year suc-
ceeding every election of a President and 
Vice President’’ and inserting ‘‘in each year 
that is evenly divisible by four’’. 
SEC. 4. PERMITTING EXTENSION OF TIME FOR 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN EVENT 
OF CATASTROPHIC EVENT POTEN-
TIALLY AFFECTING OUTCOME. 
(a) EXTENSION OF TIME FOR ELECTION.—Sec-
tion 2 of title 3, United States Code, is 
amended to read as follows: 
‘‘§ 2. Limited extension of time for appointing 
electors 
‘‘(a) CRITERIA
FOR
EXTENDING
TIME
FOR

State laws duly enacted prior to the day 
fixed by section 1 of this title, the time for 
voting in such election shall, in accordance 
with the procedures described in subsection 
(b), be extended beyond the day fixed by sec-
tion 1 of this title if a candidate for Presi-
dent who appears on the ballot in the State 
demonstrates by clear and convincing evi-
dence in an action filed under subsection (b) 
that— 
‘‘(1) a catastrophic event has occurred in 
the State; 
‘‘(2) the catastrophic event has prevented a 
substantial portion of the State’s electorate 
from casting a ballot on such day, or caused 
a substantial portion of ballots already cast 
to be destroyed or rendered unreadable by 
such event without sufficient notice to af-
fected voters by such day; and 
‘‘(3) the number of voters prevented from 
casting a ballot by such event, the number of 
ballots destroyed or rendered unreadable by

bers, is sufficient in number to potentially 
affect the ability of that candidate to win 
the election with respect to one or more 
presidential electors.

‘‘(1) AUTHORIZING FILING OF ACTION BY CAN-
DIDATE.—A candidate for President who ap-
pears on the ballot of the State, and no other 
person, may file an action against the chief 
State election official of the State in the dis-
trict court of the United States for the judi-
cial district in which the capital of the State 
is located to seek an extension of the time 
for voting in the election under this section. 
Such district court shall have original and 
exclusive jurisdiction of any such action. 
‘‘(2) 
DETERMINATION
BY
THREE-JUDGE 
COURT.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—Any action under this 
subsection shall be heard and determined by 
a court of 3 judges convened pursuant to sec-
tion 2284 of title 28, United States Code, ex-
cept that subsection (b)(2) of such section 
shall not apply to any such action, and any 
determination with respect to such an action 
shall be reviewable only by appeal directly 
to the Supreme Court of the United States. 
‘‘(B) EXPEDITED CONSIDERATION.—It shall be 
the duty of the district court described in

United States to advance on the docket and 
to expedite to the greatest extent possible 
the disposition of any action or appeal under 
this subsection. 
‘‘(3) CRITERIA
FOR
DECISION.—The court 
shall require the time for voting in the elec-
tion to be extended under this section only if 
the court finds by clear and convincing evi-
dence that the criteria of subsection (a) are 
met.

‘‘(A) PERIOD
OF
EXTENSION.—If the court 
finds that the criteria of subsection (a) are 
met, the court shall, except as provided in 
subparagraph (C), order an extended voting 
period that shall be for the shortest duration 
necessary in light of the catastrophic event 
justifying the extension, so long as such ex-
tended voting period concludes not later 
than 5 days after the day fixed by section 1 
of this title. 
‘‘(B) IMPLEMENTATION OF EXTENSION.— The 
time for voting in an election which is ex-
tended under this section shall only be ex-
tended in the area in the State specifically 
and directly affected by the catastrophic 
event, and, to the extent practicable, all bal-
lots cast on or prior to the day fixed by sec-
tion 1 of this title that are otherwise valid 
under State law duly enacted prior to such 
day shall be counted, and voters who cast 
such ballots shall not be required to take 
further action to take into account the ex-
tension of time for the election under this 
section. 
‘‘(C) IMPOSSIBILITY OF IMPLEMENTATION.—If 
the court finds that the criteria of sub-
section (a) are met, but that it is impossible 
for the State to administer an extended vot-
ing period as a result of the catastrophic 
event, the court shall issue a declaratory 
judgment to that effect and, to the extent 
practicable, all ballots cast on or prior to the 
day fixed by section 1 of this title that are 
otherwise valid under State law duly enacted 
prior to such day shall be counted. 
‘‘(5) RIGHT
TO
INTERVENE.—Only a can-
didate for President who appears on the bal-
lot of the State may intervene in an action 
filed with respect to the State under this 
subsection. 
‘‘(6) SANCTIONS.—If, on the court’s own ini-
tiative or the motion of a party, the court 
finds that the candidate filing an action 
under this subsection did not have a good- 
faith basis for the factual or legal conten-
tions asserted in the action, the candidate’s 
attorneys of record and their law firms shall 
be jointly and severally liable for an amount 
equal to 3 times the full attorney’s fees and 
other expenses incurred by each other party 
to the action. 
‘‘(7) DEADLINE.— 
‘‘(A) IN
GENERAL.—An action under this 
subsection must be filed not later than the 
day after the day fixed for the election by 
section 1 of this title. 
‘‘(B) EXCEPTION.—If the catastrophic event 
prevents the appropriate court from accept-
ing the filing of an action under this sub-
section, the action must be filed in another 
district court of the United States capable of 
accepting the filing most proximate to the 
judicial district in which the capital of the 
State is located.

If any provision of this Act or an amend-

cumstance, is held to be unconstitutional, 
the remainder of this Act, and the applica-
tion of such provision or amendment to any 
other person or circumstance, shall not be 
affected by the holding. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill 
shall be debatable for 1 hour, equally 
divided and controlled by the chair and 
ranking minority member of the Com-
mittee on House Administration or 
their respective designees. 
The gentlewoman from California 
(Ms. LOFGREN) and the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS) each will 
control 30 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and insert extraneous material 
on H.R. 8873 into the RECORD. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
strong support of H.R. 8873, the Presi-
dential Election Reform Act. 
This bipartisan bill is a product of 
over 2 years of work, first on the Com-
mittee on House Administration and 
subsequently on the January 6th Select 
Committee. 
Working in partnership with Rep-
resentative LIZ CHENEY, we have had 
extensive consultation with bipartisan 
law professors, former judges, and 
other experts. We have engaged in a 
fulsome, thoughtful, nonpartisan proc-
ess, and where Ms. CHENEY and I didn’t 
always agree, we compromised, in the 
great tradition of the legislative proc-
ess. 
I thank my friend, colleague, and the 
vice chair of the January 6th Com-
mittee, LIZ CHENEY. Her partnership, 
leadership, intelligence, and, frankly, 
her courage have been invaluable to 
the select committee’s work and to the 
development of this bill. 
I want to be very clear: In revising 
the Electoral Count Act and related 
laws, that in no way condones the ac-
tions of the ex-President and his allies. 
Indeed, Dr. John Eastman openly ad-
mitted that his plan violated the Elec-
toral Count Act. President Trump was 
told the same. 
But this bill will make it harder to 
convince people that they have the 
right to overthrow the election. Here 
are a few things the bill does. 
First, this bill reaffirms that the 
Vice President’s authority at the elec-
toral count is ministerial. The Vice 
President’s authority has always been 
ministerial and always will be ministe-
rial, but as we saw in 2020, former 
President Trump and his allies sought 
to unlawfully exploit the ECA to sug-
gest otherwise. 
The bill will also enact new electoral 
counting 
rules 
for 
Congress. 
Pre-
viously, just a few Members of each 
House were able to derail the pro-
ceedings 
with 
frivolous 
objections. 
That will no longer be the case. 
Under this bill, no objection will be 
heard unless one-third of each House 
supports it, and the only objections 
that will be permitted are those that 
are rooted in the Constitution itself, a 
narrow set of issues. 
The bill also prevents State and local 
election subversion. For example, Gov-
ernors will be required to submit their 
State’s lawful certificate of appoint-
ment, and Federal courts will be em-
powered to force them to do so if they 
refuse. 
Ultimately, this bill is about pro-
tecting the will of the American vot-
ers, which is a principle that is beyond 
partisanship. The bottom line is this: If 
you want to object to the vote, you 
better have your colleagues and the 
Constitution on your side. Don’t try to 
overturn our democracy. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
I think it is important today to begin 
by taking a step back, provide some 
important context about the bill we 
are considering today, and reestablish 
some important facts. 
Election administration and the way 
elections work is a complicated proc-
ess. For most of us, this experience 
typically consists of showing up, cast-
ing a ballot, and then digesting news 
coverage of results. Very few people re-
alize everything that goes on behind 
the scenes. 
But recently, as election administra-
tion has come into the forefront, there 
are a lot of people who all of a sudden 
seem to think that they are an expert 
on the subject. This includes many of 
the people in these buildings and in the 
press. 
Many of those folks have never been 
on the ground in election offices across 
the country and couldn’t tell the dif-
ference between an e-pollbook and a 
high-speed ballot scanner, yet they 
know they are right. 
This has led to all sorts of rumors, 
narratives, and misinformation across 
the political spectrum to percolate 
within our society, and that has caused 
people to lose faith in our elections. 
This is a huge problem. 
I have spent the past few years trav-
eling the country to learn about dif-
ferent State election processes and 
have met with countless Republican 
and Democrat election administrators.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H8037 
September 21, 2022 
I have learned about the checks and 
balances in place. 
Free and fair elections are the bed-
rock of our democracy, and we must 
ensure people can have faith in elec-
tions and election processes and out-
comes in order for our democracy to 
continue to thrive. 
Unfortunately, one false narrative 
that has been pushed by my colleagues 
on the other side is that Republican 
Members of Congress are election sub-
verters or deniers, trying to overthrow 
elections because of an objection to a 
State’s electoral slate on January 6. 
This has been fueled by members of the 
media who don’t understand the sub-
ject. 
They are claiming that this par-
ticular action was unprecedented and 
an affront to democracy. However, so 
many of them, including powerful com-
mittee chairs that are in power today, 
have objected in the past. In fact, 
Democrats have objected to every sin-
gle Republican Presidential win in the 
21st century. 
Another false narrative is that some-
how the legal actions taken by the 
Trump 
campaign, 
the 
rhetoric 
of 
former President Trump, Republican 
Members of Congress voting to object 
to a State’s electors, and the illegal ac-
tions of many people who attacked the 
Capitol on January 6 were all con-
nected in some kind of mass conspiracy 
by Republicans to stage a coup. 
These two narratives are now pre-
sented on a daily basis as though they 
are fact, but that is quite simply not 
true. The fact of the matter is, there 
are longstanding legal frameworks in 
place to adjudicate disputes in election 
outcomes that have been utilized regu-
larly, regardless of party. 
There is not enough time today to go 
through all of them, but the point is 
these processes have existed for a long 
time, and they are used frequently and 
often by candidates of all political 
stripes. 
There are checks, balances, and safe-
guards woven in throughout the sys-
tem. The goal of every election frame-
work is to ensure the person who takes 
the oath of office is the one who actu-
ally won. That is true in the States, in 
the courts, and here in Congress. 
The best news of all is these systems 
have worked. At the end of the day, the 
outcomes were exactly as they should 
have been. It is why people can and 
should have faith in our election sys-
tem. 
This isn’t to say that our system is 
perfect. There is always room for im-
provement, but unfortunately, that is 
not what is happening here today. 
The Electoral Count Act has been in 
place for over a century and directly 
implements constitutional provisions. 
Members of all political parties have 
exercised their rights under the provi-
sions of that law to raise constitu-
tional objections to State electoral 
slates if they determine something 
may be improper. This is not an affront 
to democracy. Frankly, it is democracy 
in action. 
In fact, Democrats have quite an ex-
tensive history of objecting to the elec-
toral count. I include in the RECORD a 
list of over 80 Democrats denying elec-
tion results, including many chairs, 
people 
like 
Chairperson 
MAXINE 
WATERS, Chairman BENNIE THOMPSON,

JAMIE
RASKIN, 
and 
many others here today.

Sanders said he was ‘‘concerned’’ about ‘‘the 
role Russian hacking played in getting 
[Trump] elected.’’

in rejecting the electoral votes from the

read’’ votes in Brindisi’s election challenge 
for his 2020 House race. He also got Al 
Franken’s apparent loss in a Minnesota Sen-
ate election overturned in court. 
81. Former state Sen. Hank Sanders (D– 
Ala.) said the 2016 presidential election was 
stolen from Clinton. 
82. Sen. Patty Murray’s (D–Wash.) sup-
ported fellow Democrats for their ‘‘questions 
about voting irregularities’’ in the 2004 presi-
dential election. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Again, the result in all of these cases 
was that our system worked. The 
House and Senate did what they were 
supposed to do, heard the objections, 
disposed of them properly, and ulti-
mately certified the election as origi-
nally presented.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H8039 
September 21, 2022 
Objecting does not make you an elec-
tion subverter or denier. Each Member 
of Congress has a constitutional duty 
to do what they think is best for their 
constituents. 
At the same time Democrats were ac-
cusing Republicans of undermining de-
mocracy, they themselves were at-
tempting to overturn the results of a 
duly-certified election in Iowa’s Second 
Congressional District. The challenger, 
Democrat Rita Hart, even said that she 
brought the contest to a partisan com-
mittee in D.C. instead of Iowa courts in 
order to ‘‘get the result we need.’’ 
This was after the State of Iowa fol-
lowed their normal and lawful process 
throughout the election for Iowa-02. 
The votes were counted, recounted by 
multiple bipartisan recount boards, 
and duly certified. 
Yet, this majority orchestrated hav-
ing their candidate bypass State courts 
and instead attempted to utilize the 
House itself to steal a congressional 
seat to boost their slim majority. This 
was the single biggest act of election 
subversion that occurred in the 2020 
election cycle, and it was carried out 
by the same people here today claim-
ing that Republicans are a threat to 
democracy. 
Fast forward to today. Democrats are 
once again attempting to move a major 
piece of legislation that overhauls a 
key piece of our election system in a 
partisan manner behind closed doors. 
They didn’t hold a hearing or a markup 
on this bill. They didn’t release legisla-
tive text until 24 hours before it was 
considered in the Rules Committee. 
They didn’t consult Republicans on the 
committee of jurisdiction, despite re-
peated overtures to work together on 
discussions of this important issue—all 
rebuffed. 
Why rush such a significant piece of 
legislation when the next Presidential 
certification won’t happen for over 2 
years? It is pretty simple, Madam 
Speaker: The midterm elections are 
just weeks away, and the Democrats 
are desperately trying to talk about 
their favorite topic, former President 
Trump. 
As someone who voted to certify Joe 
Biden as President and who recently 
lost a primary race to a candidate en-
dorsed by the former President, I be-
lieve what House Democrats and the 
January 6th Committee are doing is ir-
responsible and wrong. 
They have allowed their dislike for 
one man, President Trump, to cloud 
their judgment and guide their actions, 
no matter the consequences to this in-
stitution or the Constitution that they 
claim they want to uphold. 
b 1500 
It is time that we started being hon-
est with ourselves and with the Amer-
ican people. The facts are: 
The President and his campaign fil-
ing legal challenges in State and Fed-
eral courts around the country was not 
improper nor unprecedented. Everyone 
is entitled to their day in court. Those 
suits were considered by judges and ul-
timately rejected. The process worked. 
The rhetoric of former President 
Trump following the 2020 election was 
highly inappropriate. 
Republican Members of Congress ob-
jecting to a State’s slate of electors is 
not election subversion or unprece-
dented. 
The actions of the individuals who 
attacked the Capitol on January 6 were 
wrong. Those individuals should be 
prosecuted to the fullest extent of the 
law. 
Democrats have just as long of a his-
tory as Republicans of challenging and 
questioning elections, including at-
tempting to overturn a duly certified 
congressional election in Iowa. This is 
not a partisan issue, and the processes 
in place have worked. 
Madam Speaker, I would just reit-
erate that people’s faith in our elec-
tions is critical to the long-term suc-
cess of our democracy. It is time for 
House Democrats to quit playing par-
tisan political games and pushing false 
narratives just to preserve their own 
power. 
It is incumbent upon all of us to be 
honest and work in good faith to serve 
the American people, restore faith in 
our elections, and protect our democ-
racy. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, on 
January 6, the President had whipped 
up a mob, told them that the Vice 
President could overturn the election, 
and a majority of the Republicans in 
this House voted to reject the decision 
made by American voters as reflected 
in the electoral college for no reason 
whatsoever, other than sham fraud 
claims. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Wyoming (Ms. 
CHENEY), the vice chair of the January 
6th Select Committee. 
Ms. CHENEY. Madam Speaker, I 
want to begin by thanking the gentle-
woman from California, Chairwoman 
LOFGREN, for her work on this bill. The 
chairwoman and I certainly have our 
disagreements on issues, but there is 
no one I respect more in this body for 
their diligence, for their commitment, 
for their expertise, for their commit-
ment to our Constitution, to her con-
stituents, and to this country. It has 
been a real pleasure working with her, 
as well as the staff of the House Ad-
ministration Committee. I particularly 
thank my counsel on the January 6th 
Select Committee, Joe Maher, for his 
tremendous work on this bill. 
This bill has benefited from a wide 
range of input from constitutional ex-
perts, including many conservative 
constitutional 
experts, 
jurists, 
and 
scholars who worked with us on this 
bill. Their input has been invaluable. 
I also want to praise those in the 
Senate who have been working hard on 
their version of Electoral Count Act re-
form. Our bill builds on what they have 
already put forth. 
Commentary from conservatives on 
our bill has been exceptionally posi-
tive. Here are a few examples. 
Judge Luttig, a widely respected con-
servative legal expert, wrote that our 
bill was ‘‘masterfully drafted’’ to en-
sure we never have another day any-
thing like January 6 and to avert other 
future efforts to overturn our Nation’s 
democratic elections. 
The Wall Street Journal editorial 
board offered a range of positive com-
ments, including explaining that the 
House bill would make it harder for 
‘‘partisans in Congress who want to get 
C-Span-famous to lodge phony elec-
toral college objections’’ or for them to 
raise objections on the House floor be-
cause ‘‘somebody had a funny feeling 
about the vote totals in west south-
eastern Pennsylvania.’’ 
The conservative Cato Institute said 
this: ‘‘In some respects,’’ this bill is 
‘‘more conservative and originalist’’ 
than the existing Senate bill. 
Conservative 
commentator 
Quin 
Hillyer said in the Washington Exam-
iner that the House bill adds to the 
work already done by the Senate and 
‘‘fills in almost all gaps with admirable 
and sensible specificity.’’ 
There are many other examples from 
conservative commentators, as well. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my Republican 
colleagues to read those articles and 
editorials in full. 
If your aim is to prevent future ef-
forts to steal elections, I would re-
spectfully suggest that conservatives 
should support this bill. If instead your 
aim is to leave open the door for elec-
tions to be stolen in the future, you 
might decide not to support this or any 
other bill to address the Electoral 
Count Act. 
January 6, contrary to what my col-
league from Illinois just said, was not 
‘‘democracy in action.’’ Our oath of of-
fice is to support and defend the Con-
stitution, which provides the method 
by which we elect our President. Legal 
challenges are not improper, but Don-
ald Trump’s refusal to abide by the rul-
ings of the courts certainly was. 
In our system of government, elec-
tions in the States determine who is 
the President. Our bill does not change 
that. This bill will prevent Congress 
from illegally choosing the President 
itself. 
As we detailed in our January 6 hear-
ings, a Federal judge has reviewed evi-
dence submitted by the January 6th 
Select Committee and concluded that 
former President Trump likely vio-
lated two criminal statutes when he 
pressured Vice President Pence to re-
ject legitimate State electoral votes in 
our joint session. That is what Vice 
President Pence called ‘‘un-American.’’ 
In 
our 
hearings, 
we 
have 
dem-
onstrated that President Trump knew 
specifically that what he was doing was 
illegal, but he did it anyway. President 
Trump’s conduct was illegal under the 
existing Electoral Count Act, and it 
would be illegal under this new bill, as 
well. 
Our bill reaffirms what the Constitu-
tion and existing law make plain: The

Vice President has no authority or dis-
cretion to reject official State elec-
toral slates. It also makes clear that if 
Members of Congress have any right to 
object 
to 
electoral 
slates, 
those 
grounds are limited to the explicit con-
stitutional requirements for candidate 
and elector eligibility and the 12th 
Amendment’s explicit requirements for 
elector balloting. 
Under our system of elections, Gov-
ernors must transmit lawful election 
results to Congress. If they fail to ful-
fill that duty, our bill provides that 
candidates for the Presidency should be 
able to sue in Federal court to ensure 
that Congress receives a State’s lawful 
certification. 
Finally, our bill makes clear that the 
rules governing an election cannot be 
changed retroactively. The Constitu-
tion assigns an important duty to 
State legislatures to determine the 
manner in which the States appoint 
their electors. This must not be read to 
allow State legislators to change the 
rules retroactively to alter the out-
come. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman. 
Ms. CHENEY. Madam Speaker, this 
bill will preserve the rule of law for all 
future Presidential elections by ensur-
ing that self-interested politicians can-
not steal from the people the guarantee 
that our government derives its power 
from the consent of the governed. 
Madam Speaker, I urge passage of 
this bill. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Georgia 
(Mr. 
LOUDERMILK). 
Mr. LOUDERMILK. Madam Speaker, 
I thank my friend, Ranking Member 
DAVIS, for yielding me the time. 
I will address something that I heard 
just a few moments ago from my col-
league from Wyoming listing off a 
number of conservative commentators 
about how great this bill is, and that is 
why we should vote on it. Well, see, 
that is the problem of why we are here 
right now. None of those conservative 
commentators are responsible for cast-
ing a vote for something that will af-
fect the future of this country. 
You see, we are here now making a 
decision on this issue when we should 
have been included in this process all 
along. I am not calling into question 
whether this bill is good or whether 
this bill is bad. What I am saying is we 
have not been involved in this process, 
and we are being told to just take the 
word of someone because they call 
themselves a conservative commen-
tator. 
It is those of us here who have been 
elected by the people of this Nation 
that are given the responsibility to 
analyze these things, to work together 
in a bipartisan manner to come up with 
what is the best solution for this Na-
tion. That is not where we are. 
A partisan-run committee is the one 
who has rushed this bill to the floor, 
and we are being told that we need to 
work on it and that it is imperative we 
pass it now. 
Don’t get me wrong, I agree that we 
ought to take a closer look at the Elec-
toral College Act. I agree that we 
should clarify some of the mechanisms 
of the act, and I certainly agree that 
we should be working to prevent an-
other breach of security of this Capitol 
as we saw on January 6. 
With all that said, we can’t afford a 
one-sided, no-compromises discussion 
crafted by a partisan select committee, 
which is what we are being presented 
with in this bill, at least from the per-
ception that we have at this moment. 
So, my question is: Why now? Why 
has the January 6th Committee chosen 
this moment to pursue this legislation 
instead of working together in a true 
bipartisan manner, engaging Repub-
licans and Democrats together in a 
broader perspective? 
You see, the American people are 
smart enough, and they know the an-
swer to this question. The January 6th 
Committee has really wasted more 
than a year. Instead of looking into 
how the security of this building was 
breached, they have been looking for a 
year for evidence of some vast con-
spiracy on January 6, 2021, with noth-
ing to show for it. They have spent 
days falsely accusing me and some of 
my other colleagues of wrongdoing in 
the days prior to the January 6 inci-
dents without producing any substan-
tial evidence to back up their claims. 
Why? Because it doesn’t exist. 
Now, with midterm elections looming 
and the prospect of a new majority in 
the House and the Senate, they feel 
they need to justify the time they have 
wasted by inserting themselves into 
what was once a bipartisan, bicameral 
discussion of the Electoral Count Re-
form Act. 
In the meantime, House Republicans 
have taken concrete steps to promote 
confidence in elections at every level of 
government. We have introduced legis-
lation that would reaffirm States’ con-
stitutional sovereignty over elections 
rather than trampling it. We have done 
this because the American people are 
tired of hearing about January 6. 
The American people care about the 
growing cost of living, the declining 
economy, and the uncontrolled spend-
ing, which has caused mass inflation. 
The American people want to be con-
fident that their vote counts in every 
election, that they can trust the ballot 
box, and their concerns won’t be ig-
nored by lawmakers in Washington. 
I will close with this. The American 
people don’t need the January 6th 
Committee to tell them what is broken 
in this country. They look at their de-
clining paycheck and the rising cost of 
groceries, and they see this body fo-
cused on the past instead of correcting 
their future. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 
30 seconds to the gentleman. 
Mr. LOUDERMILK. Madam Speaker, 
they see that this body and its reckless 
spending is why we have record infla-
tion in this moment. 
For that reason, I encourage my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the Presi-
dential Election Reform Act, and then 
let’s work together on something that 
will work for the American people. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, the 
January 6th Committee has as its obli-
gation 
to 
recommend 
legislative 
changes that would make the country 
safer. We have done that. 
I will say that the partisan split in 
the House Administration Committee 
has always been six majority, three mi-
nority. On the select committee, it is 
not that far off, seven majority, two 
minority. 
We have worked together, and I hear 
Mr. DAVIS’ concern that he didn’t par-
ticipate. It wasn’t me. It was Leader 
MCCARTHY
that withdrew his name. 
Had his name been left in, he would 
have been a member of the committee, 
and he would have been able to partici-
pate in the obligation our committee 
has undertaken. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. 
HOYER), our majority leader. 
Mr. 
HOYER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, Congress has a sa-
cred duty to uphold our elections and 
to safeguard our democratic process. I 
rise in strong support of that mission. 
I am not surprised that we hear on 
this floor the rationalization of insur-
rection, the rationalization of what I 
believe was treason. 
I rise with extraordinary respect for 
the gentlewoman from Wyoming, as 
Republican as any Member of that side 
of the aisle, save a willingness to stand 
and speak truth to power, to honor 
facts, to honor the Constitution. 
b 1515 
I applaud her for it and have deep re-
spect for her willingness to stand up 
today and for history. 
The gentleman from Georgia called 
January 6 an incident. The Republican 
National Committee passed a resolu-
tion, almost overwhelmingly, that re-
ferred to January 6 as legitimate polit-
ical discourse: see no evil, speak no 
evil, hear no evil. 
I hear my friend, Mr. DAVIS, speaking 
about this being a partisan issue. This 
is an American issue. This is a democ-
racy issue. This is a values issue. 
To those who come to this well or 
speak from the floor to try to ration-
alize the invitation given by President 
Trump—the 
incitement 
stated 
by 
President Trump—and the deployment 
of a mob to fight like hell and stop the 
steal—I advise my colleagues and I 
urge my colleagues to look at Vice 
President Gore’s comments when he 
lost the election 5–4. He honored the 
Court’s decision, not because he agreed

with it, but because he said it was good 
for America and our democracy. 
I call attention to the remarks of 
Hillary Clinton when she lost to Presi-
dent Trump. That night, knowing that 
she had gotten 3 million more votes, 
she conceded because the law is the 
electoral college makes that decision. 
In 1864, despite the turmoil of Civil 
War, President Lincoln—President Lin-
coln would be standing with LIZ CHE-
NEY if he were on this floor. President 
Lincoln went to great lengths to en-
sure that Americans had the oppor-
tunity to make their voices heard in a 
national election. He argued that ‘‘We 
cannot have free government without 
elections,’’ and that ‘‘if the rebellion 
could force us to forego or postpone a 
national election, it might fairly claim 
to have already conquered and ruined 
us.’’ 
LIZ CHENEY has said that, not exactly 
in those words, but it is exactly the 
same substance of what Abraham Lin-
coln said over a century and a half ago. 
We came face to face with a similar 
danger on January 6 last year. It was 
rationalized then, and, sadly, it is 
being rationalized now. History will 
judge. 
The insurrection revealed a willful 
and false refusal to accept the certified 
and judicially confirmed election re-
sults. The gentleman from Illinois said 
that the Trump administration went to 
the courts. They lost time after time 
after time after time, and to this day, 
they do not accept what Al Gore ac-
cepted, that we are a nation of laws 
and not of one man. 
There are ambiguities in our elec-
toral system, and they can jeopardize 
our democracy. That is what this bill is 
about: upholding our democracy. 
Questions 
surrounding 
the 
Vice 
President’s role in counting electoral 
votes served as a pretext for the insur-
rectionists’ assault on the Capitol. For-
tunately, their conspiracy and their 
plot failed. In that incident that the 
gentleman from Georgia talked about, 
police officers died, civilians died, and 
hundreds were injured severely in that 
incident. 
What a polite word for treason and 
insurrection. 
That tragic and dangerous episode, 
however, underscored the importance 
of clarifying any uncertainties that fu-
ture malevolent actors could exploit to 
undermine the will of the American 
people 
as 
expressed 
through 
their 
votes. 
I went to the Charles County Fair 
last weekend. I went to the Democratic 
booth. As I always do, I went to the Re-
publican booth, and the biggest sign 
was: Trump won. 
We are a nation of laws. Try to re-
spect a nation of laws. The bipartisan 
legislation the Presidential Election 
Reform Act provides the clarity nec-
essary. 
It reaffirms, as former Vice President 
Mike 
Pence 
correctly 
concluded— 
which is why those incidents were call-
ing for the death of the Vice President 
with a noose hanging out in front of 
the Capitol and why they were calling 
for the life of the Speaker of the House 
in that incident—that he did not have, 
and he does not have the authority to 
delay or reject the counting of elec-
toral votes. 
Why? 
Because we are a nation of laws and 
a nation of the Constitution. That 
principle was established in both the 
Constitution and the Electoral Count 
Act of 1887. 
Not only would this legislation raise 
the threshold required to object to a 
State’s slate of electors from the ridic-
ulously low one House Member and one 
Senator to one-third of the member-
ship—at least 152 million people ought 
to be given that respect who voted in 
that election—at least one-third of us 
would have to rise to overturn their 
judgment. 
This bill also restricts the grounds on 
which objections can be made, limiting 
the ability of Members to lodge frivo-
lous and partisan objections. 
The bill also contains important pro-
visions to restrict the ability of State 
and local elected and election officials 
to undermine or overturn the process 
of tabulating and certifying results in 
their jurisdictions. People elect the 
President, not State legislators, and 
not this Congress. The American peo-
ple elect the President. 
Not only do these measures align 
with the overwhelming consensus—not 
just conservative commentators, but 
commentators of all stripes whether 
ideological or not, believe this is a 
good piece of legislation. I share their 
view. 
No individual or group of conspira-
tors ought to have the power to subvert 
the will of the American people. 
I thank the Committee on House Ad-
ministration Chair ZOE LOFGREN, and I 
share the remarks of the gentlewoman 
from Wyoming about her integrity, her 
intellect, and her conscientious car-
rying out of her duties as a Member of 
the Congress. Indeed, Vice-Chair CHE-
NEY’s work on this bill and the January 
6 Committee will go down as one of 
this institution’s greatest examples of 
political courage and integrity. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gentle-
woman for her work. 
Similarly, 
I 
thank 
Chairwoman 
CAROLYN MALONEY and her colleagues 
on the House Oversight and Reform 
Committee 
for 
their 
work 
inves-
tigating vulnerabilities in our demo-
cratic process. 
We must now come together not as 
Republicans, not as Democrats, and 
not as partisans, but as protectors. We 
raised our hands and said that we 
would protect the Constitution and 
laws of this Nation. This is one of those 
days that we get to meet that oath. 
Let me conclude because not only did 
Lincoln argue that elections were es-
sential to free government, but he also 
made clear his belief that ‘‘elections 
belong to the people. It is their 
choice.’’ 
That is what this legislation is 
about. Stand up for your country. 
Stand up for the people. Vote for this 
bill. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, may I inquire how 
much time is remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Illinois has 17 minutes re-
maining. The gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia has 19 minutes remaining. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, it is always good to 
follow my good friend, Leader HOYER. I 
appreciate his friendship, and I appre-
ciate his time here in this institution. 
He has seen a lot of things happen in 
the governing of this country. I respect 
him and his viewpoint. 
It is frustrating when we also hear 
comments from my colleague, Leader 
HOYER. Back on January 25 of this year 
he was quoted in a Politico story where 
he said that President Biden is correct 
that the midterm elections will be ille-
gitimate if Congress doesn’t pass the 
Democrats’ election takeover bills. 
This is part of the rhetoric that we 
have got to stop. We have got to make 
sure that we remind everybody, as 
Leader HOYER did, my good friend, that 
this is an American issue. It is not a 
partisan issue. The processes have 
worked. 
I want to know, if it is an American 
issue and not a partisan issue, Madam 
Speaker, why, then, were we not even 
consulted as the committee of jurisdic-
tion minority members? 
I would have loved to have been able 
to sit down and come up with a bipar-
tisan solution. No Republican—no Re-
publican—that I know or that I respect 
thinks that the violence on January 6, 
which we all witnessed, is okay. 
I think it was a terrible day. I think, 
again, anyone who committed those 
acts and those crimes should be held 
accountable to the fullest extent of the 
law. Let’s be clear: They broke the law. 
It doesn’t matter what you are pro-
testing, Madam Speaker, if you break 
the law. 
Madam Speaker, if you are rioting in 
the streets, looting stores and busi-
nesses, and committing the crimes 
across this country that we have seen 
exacerbated because of the Biden ad-
ministration’s lack of effort in enforc-
ing these activities to be adjudicated, 
then do you know what? They should 
be held accountable. Arrest them, pros-
ecute them, and put them in jail. 
Leader HOYER also said this bill and 
this process should not be about one 
man. I agree. I agree. But, unfortu-
nately, this bill is nothing short of 
being only about that one man. This is 
too important of an issue to make this 
about an individual that you may or 
may not like or that you may or may 
not want to run for President ever 
again. This bill and this process is too 
important for the future of America. 
Madam Speaker, my good friend, Mr. 
HOYER, brought up Hillary Clinton. She 
actually denied the results of the 2016 
Presidential 
elections 
and 
believes

there were legitimate questions regard-
ing the integrity of the 2004 Presi-
dential election. She said that Stacey 
Abrams would have won the 2018 guber-
natorial 
election 
against 
Governor 
Brian Kemp if it had been fair. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. 
STEIL). 
Mr. STEIL. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Illinois for yield-
ing. 
Madam Speaker, when I saw that 
there was going to be a bill rushed to 
the House floor with 5 days remaining 
in a legislative calendar without a 
committee hearing, I thought maybe 
the Democratic majority would be 
rushing to the floor a bill to address in-
flation that is clobbering the American 
people. 
No. 
I thought maybe they would be rush-
ing to the floor a bill to address the 
crime crisis that is plaguing cities 
across the United States. 
But no. 
I thought maybe there would be a bill 
rushed to the House floor without a 
committee hearing 51 hours after the 
text was introduced to address the cri-
sis taking place at our border and the 
millions of immigrants coming into 
the United States illegally and the 
fentanyl that is coming across our 
U.S.-Mexico border and killing thou-
sands of Americans. 
But no. 
So what is so important that a bill 
needs to be rushed to the House floor 
without any committee hearing to re-
view and analyze the bill? 
And it is the Presidential Election 
Reform Act. 
As the ranking member of the Sub-
committee on Elections of the House 
Administration Committee, I have to 
admit I am disappointed we didn’t have 
the opportunity to thoughtfully review 
the legislation before us. 
b 1530 
In fact, we haven’t had a hearing in 
the Subcommittee on Elections since 
July. So I think now is our moment, 
unfortunately, with only 30 minutes on 
the minority’s side, to actually dive in 
and analyze the legislation before us. 
With any important piece of legisla-
tion, in particular, one like this that 
impacts our national elections and the 
elections of our President, the first 
question I ask myself is: Will the bill 
before us boost people’s confidence in 
our election process? The bill fails the 
test. 
I would highlight, in particular, sec-
tion 4 of this bill that gives candidates 
a loophole to define what a cata-
strophic event is, which might include 
a natural disaster or national health 
emergency like COVID. Why is this so 
important? 
The candidate for President could— 
up to a full day following the election— 
request an extension for the election 
by up to 5 days if they feel there is a 
‘‘catastrophic event’’ that was suffi-
cient to prevent a substantial portion 
of a State’s electorate from casting a 
ballot on election day. 
The bill doesn’t properly define cata-
strophic event. Often in this body, we 
take the time in committee in regular 
order to understand what the terms of 
the bill mean, to give an opportunity 
to improve the text to provide cer-
tainty and clarity to the American 
people going forward. We are let down 
by the fact that we are not following 
regular process in this case. 
Instead of continuing to undermine 
faith in the elections process, we 
should instead pursue commonsense 
legislation that supports election in-
tegrity and respects the Constitution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute 
to the gentleman from Wisconsin. 
Mr. STEIL. Madam Speaker, pursue 
legislation that respects the Constitu-
tion and Federalism, such as legisla-
tion like the American Confidence in 
Elections Act that Ranking Member 
DAVIS introduced back in July to en-
hance the integrity in our elections. 
We heard earlier the majority leader 
mention that there is ambiguity in our 
election system and that is what this is 
about. If that is what this is about—if 
we are actually trying to remove the 
ambiguity in our election system, 
which is a very worthy cause, why not 
have a hearing on this bill? 
I haven’t yet heard one person from 
the majority’s side explain why this 
bill is being rushed to the floor 51 
hours after the text was introduced 
without using the consideration of the 
Senate bill as the basis of this legisla-
tive text. I think that question needs 
to be answered today. 
We need to actually dive into what 
this bill does to actually allow the 
American people to have confidence in 
our election system. I remain dis-
appointed the House did not take the 
thoughtful approach that the Senate 
takes, and I urge my colleagues to vote 
against the bill. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, just a quick correc-
tion. Right now and in the 2020 elec-
tion, we had States that said, gosh, 
there is fraud. It was completely bogus, 
but they tried to monkey with the sys-
tem. This bill prevents that. 
It defines a major natural disaster as 
any 
natural 
catastrophe, 
including 
hurricane, tornado, historically signifi-
cant widespread snowstorm, histori-
cally significant widespread flooding, 
historically 
significant 
destructive 
fire, tidal wave, tsunami, earthquake, 
or volcanic eruption that prevents a 
large sector of a State from voting 
enough that it could impact the elec-
tion. 
Then it limits how long you could ac-
commodate that disaster. The decision 
isn’t made by partisans. It is Federal 
judges who would make that deter-
mination. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
AGUILAR), an esteemed member of the 
January 6 Select Committee. 
Mr. AGUILAR. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Chair LOFGREN
and the vice 
chair of the January 6 Select Com-
mittee, my colleague from Wyoming, 
LIZ
CHENEY, for their leadership in 
bringing this bill to us. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 8873, the bipartisan Presi-
dential Election Reform Act. This bill 
makes important changes to the laws 
that govern the cornerstone of our de-
mocracy, a peaceful transfer of power. 
These changes benefit no political 
party, and they do not give political 
advantage to any particular candidate. 
This bill simply protects the rule of 
law from those who would seek to 
upend it. 
Our Republican colleagues who are 
opposed to this legislation, once again 
find themselves on the side of violent 
extremists. Madam Speaker, after what 
we saw on January 6 and what the Se-
lect Committee has demonstrated, that 
those seeking to overturn the election 
were exploiting the vulnerabilities in 
the law this bill remedies, I am not 
sure how anyone could oppose this 
piece of legislation. 
The choice before this body is clear: 
Protect the rule of law, strengthen the 
Constitution, and vote against insur-
rection. 
Madam Speaker, I urge an ‘‘aye’’ 
vote. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I thought the es-
teemed Member from California was 
going to speak a little longer. It caught 
me a little off guard. I apologize. I am 
not used to him being that succinct in 
anything he does but thank you. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
MCCLINTOCK), my good friend, another 
esteemed Member of this institution. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, 
the Electoral Count Act of 1887 asserts 
that Congress may vote to disqualify 
electoral votes. It was misused by the 
Democrats in 2016 and by Republicans 
in 2020, attempting to interfere with 
the constitutionally required tally of 
electoral votes. I believe both sides 
were wrong. 
Congress has no such power, period. 
Think about it. Under our Constitu-
tion, if no candidate receives a major-
ity of electoral votes, the election im-
mediately passes to the House and Sen-
ate. If Congress had the power to pass 
judgment on the validity of electoral 
votes, 
it 
could 
simply 
invalidate 
enough to place the election in its own 
hands, an obvious conflict of interest. 
That is why the Constitution clearly 
mandates that the vote shall be count-
ed in the presence of the Congress. Dis-
putes arising from the conduct of elec-
tions are the sole province of the 
courts. Does anyone seriously believe 
that a Congress of 535 intensely par-
tisan politicians is a safe repository for

the power to adjudicate the integrity 
of the vote? Well, neither did the 
Founders. 
This 
measure 
does 
narrow 
the 
grounds upon which the count can be 
interfered with by the Congress, but it 
still allows Congress to invalidate elec-
toral votes. So it does not solve the 
problem, and it creates new problems 
by allowing a State to delay its elec-
tion for up to 5 days after the rest of 
the Nation’s vote is already known. 
Can you imagine the chaos and sus-
picions that that would create? How 
sad that such an important issue as the 
electoral count should be handled in so 
clumsy and partisan a bill as this. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Massachusetts (Ms. CLARK). 
Ms. 
CLARK 
of 
Massachusetts. 
Madam Speaker, January 6 is one of 
the darkest days in American history. 
We now know in great detail how the 
former President and his cronies were 
attempting to use the electoral certifi-
cation process to undermine our de-
mocracy to take away the people’s 
vote. 
They tried to delegitimize a free and 
fair election with their lies, subvert 
the results certified and sent by the 
States, and pressure a Vice President 
into rejecting his constitutional re-
sponsibilities, all of which erupted in 
violence, hate, and bloodshed right 
here in our Capitol. 
We walked through the blood and 
broken glass right outside of this 
Chamber to cast our votes to uphold 
our democracy. Today, we must vote 
for the Electoral Count Act to ensure 
that the rule of law and the will of the 
people will always prevail in this 
Chamber and in this country. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
PELOSI), 
the 
Speaker of the House. 
Ms. 
PELOSI. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I 
thank the chair for her patriotic lead-
ership on the House Administration 
Committee and her invaluable service 
and leadership as a member of the Se-
lect Committee on January 6. 
Madam Speaker, I thank her for 
yielding, but I more importantly thank 
her for bringing this important legisla-
tion to the floor. I salute her leader-
ship and that of Congresswoman LIZ 
CHENEY, vice chair of the January 6 Se-
lect Committee, a principled and cou-
rageous voice for freedom in our coun-
try. 
This legislation is a manifestation of 
their courage, their patriotism, and 
their determination in our mission to 
save American democracy. I thank 
Chairwoman LOFGREN and Vice Chair 
CHENEY. 
Madam Speaker, we are really the 
beneficiaries of such greatness in our 
country’s history. One of our Founders, 
Thomas Paine, said that the times 
have found them to declare independ-
ence; to fight a war for independence 
against the greatest naval power that 
existed at the time; to win that war 
under leadership of our great patriarch, 
George Washington, and then to write 
our founding documents. Thank God 
they made them amendable so that we 
could have expanding freedom in our 
country. 
One of their early documents, the 
Declaration of Independence, has been 
called by some the greatest document 
of the millennium, of a thousand years. 
Some years later the Union was 
under threat. Abraham Lincoln—this is 
long before he was President—Abraham 
Lincoln delivered a stark warning 
about the state of our Union. Speaking 
in Springfield in 1837, more than two 
decades before the Civil War, he diag-
nosed a dangerous erosion of our de-
mocracy. ‘‘They were pillars of the 
temple of liberty,’’ Lincoln said, refer-
ring to the generation of Americas who 
fought for independence and served as 
living proof of the importance of de-
mocracy. He continued: ‘‘ . . . now that 
they have crumbled away, that temple 
must fall unless we, their descendants, 
supply their places with other pillars 
. . .’’ 
His words ring just as true today as 
we confront a dire threat to our democ-
racy and a duty to supply new pillars 
to preserve it. 
On January 6, 2021, an insurrection 
erupted at the Capitol, seeking to nul-
lify the results of a free and fair elec-
tion. This was a direct assault not only 
on the Capitol, but on our Constitu-
tion, on the rule of law, and on democ-
racy itself; a direct assault on the Con-
stitution because the Constitution said 
that day that the Congress would, 
again, certify the election of Joe Biden 
and KAMALA HARRIS per the Constitu-
tion by presenting the electoral college 
vote. So that was an assault on the 
Constitution. That was that day. It 
wasn’t just any day; it was the day 
that the Constitution was supposed to 
be honored. 
Now, we have a solemn duty to en-
sure that future efforts to undermine 
elections cannot succeed. That is why 
the House established the Select Com-
mittee on January 6, to find the truth 
of the attack and ensure that it could 
never happen again. Since then, there 
have been attempts across the country 
to nullify future elections. 
b 1545 
That is why, today, we are taking 
historic and bipartisan legislative ac-
tion to safeguard the integrity of fu-
ture Presidential elections. 
The Presidential Election Reform 
Act takes four necessary steps. 
First, the bill reaffirms that under 
the Constitution, the Vice President 
has no authority to reject a slate of 
electors or delay the count in any way. 
This was the heart of the former Presi-
dent’s illegal, false electoral scheme. 
Second, the bill directly limits the 
types of objections to only those out-
lined in the Constitution, which can be 
raised during certification. You just 
can’t raise any and all, but those that 
are allowed in the Constitution. All ob-
jections would require one-third of 
each Chamber to be entertained and a 
majority to be sustained. 
Third, our bill requires Governors to 
transmit lawful election results to 
Congress or be compelled to by a Fed-
eral court. Under this proposal, no 
rogue Governor can unlawfully subvert 
the will of the people, the heart of a de-
mocracy expressed in the democratic 
electoral process. 
Fourth, our bill makes crystal clear 
that States cannot change the rules 
governing an election after the elec-
tion has occurred—did you hear that? 
‘‘Cannot change the rules governing an 
election after the election has oc-
curred’’—preventing radical State leg-
islators from attempting to nullify the 
election. I keep using that word, ‘‘nul-
lify.’’ 
These changes are imperative right 
now. Emboldened by January 6, politi-
cians are waging a sinister campaign 
across America, the country, to sub-
vert our future elections, peddling the 
big lie that the 2022 election was sto-
len; assembling an army of operatives 
to intimidate voters at the polls and 
poll workers, as well; and even threat-
ening to reverse results for which they 
disagree. 
Wait a minute. We are talking about 
a democracy. ‘‘Threatening to reverse 
results for which they disagree.’’ 
Let me be clear: This is a kitchen 
table issue for families. We must en-
sure that this antidemocratic plot can-
not succeed. 
It is a kitchen table issue because de-
nying the American people their funda-
mental freedom to choose their own 
leaders denies them their voice in the 
policies we pursue. Those policies can 
make an immense difference in their 
everyday lives, on top of which we have 
a responsibility. We take an oath to 
protect and defend the Constitution of 
the United States. 
This legislation is in furtherance of 
honoring that oath of office so that our 
children, 
our 
grandchildren, 
future 
generations, know that they live in a 
great democracy that cannot be under-
mined for political reasons. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
every 
Member 
knows that January 6 was an attempt 
to subvert democracy, but many across 
the aisle refuse to admit the truth. 
They refused to admit the truth that 
very night with blood on the floor, 
glass on the floor, and all the rest when 
we came in to honor our constitutional 
responsibility. 
Overwhelmingly, others on the other 
side of the aisle voted not to accept the 
results of the people in the election. 
Now, House Republican leaders are 
whipping against this necessary meas-
ure. To all those who oppose this legis-
lation, I ask you: How could anyone 
vote against free and fair elections, a 
cornerstone of our Constitution? How 
could anyone vote against our Found-
ers’ vision, placing power in the hands

of the people? How could anyone vote 
against their own constituents, allow-
ing radical politicians to rip away their 
say in our democracy? 
Decades after Lincoln’s stark warn-
ing, the future he foretold, a crumbling 
of the pillars of democracy, came to 
pass with a Civil War. One year into 
the horror and devastation, President 
Lincoln called on the Congress to come 
together to save the Union. 
In his message, he wrote—this is 
when he is President—‘‘We shall nobly 
save, or meanly lose, the last best hope 
of Earth.’’ We ‘‘hold the power and bear 
the responsibility.’’ 
Today, American democracy, ‘‘the 
last best hope of Earth,’’ is again in 
grave danger, and its fate is in our 
hands. 
So, I implore every Member to heed 
Lincoln’s words, to stand up for the 
rule of law and our Constitution. In 
doing so, we pass on a vibrant democ-
racy for generations to come—Amer-
ica, the beacon of hope in the world; 
this building, a symbol, a temple of de-
mocracy, synonymous with freedom 
and democracy throughout the world, 
which was assaulted, but we must cor-
rect it. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a resounding 
bipartisan ‘‘aye’’ vote on the Presi-
dential Election Reform Act. 
In gratitude to Madam Chair ZOE 
LOFGREN, chair of the House Adminis-
tration Committee and a member of 
the January 6th Committee, and our 
very distinguished vice chair of the 
January 6th Committee, thank you for 
your patriotism. Thank you for your 
leadership. Thank you for your cour-
age. 
Madam Speaker, I urge an ‘‘aye’’ 
vote. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to 
how much time is remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Illinois has 71⁄2 minutes 
remaining. 
The 
gentlewoman 
from 
California has 15 minutes remaining. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD a tweet from Speaker PELOSI 
on May 16, 2017, that says: ‘‘Our elec-
tion was hijacked. There is no ques-
tion. 
Congress 
has 
a 
duty 
to 
#ProtectOurDemocracy 
and 
#FollowTheFacts.’’ 
I couldn’t agree more. We need to fol-
low the facts. 
The Speaker asked: How can one vote 
against this bill? Well, I would say: 
How can we vote for a bill that was 
completely done without any consulta-
tion? 
Here is what I hope, Madam Speaker. 
I was actually comforted somewhat 
during the Rules testimony yesterday 
when my colleague, Chairperson LOF-
GREN, mentioned that the goal of the 
majority is to watch this bill pass—I 
have many concerns with it; I laid 
those out yesterday, and I will lay 
them out again—but hope the Senate 
passes the version that we could have 
used as the basis and the starting point 
here in the House, and then we could 
go to conference committee. 
Okay, I hope it happens. I am not 
going to hold my breath, but I cer-
tainly hope it happens. I reiterate my 
desire for that to be a process where we 
can finally come together in a bipar-
tisan way. Again, I am cautiously opti-
mistic. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, just 
a correction. What I actually said in 
the Rules Committee is I hope we pass 
this bill. The Senate will pass a bill. 
They are doing a markup in the Rules 
Committee next week. If they are dif-
ferent, there is generally a conference 
committee. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
JEFFRIES). 
Mr. JEFFRIES. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Chairwoman LOFGREN and Vice 
Chair CHENEY for their distinguished 
leadership on this incredibly important 
issue. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
strong support of the Presidential Elec-
tion Reform Act. 
Our democracy is fragile. Democracy 
is not a spectator sport. Democracy is 
not a self-executing proposition. De-
mocracy does not simply run on auto-
pilot. 
It requires all of us to remain en-
gaged, particularly because we are con-
fronting a diabolical adversary who is 
determined to undermine the principle 
of free and fair elections, undermine 
the rule of law, and undermine the 
peaceful transfer of power. 
Certainly, our democracy is not per-
fect, but it is worth saving. That is 
why it is so critically important that 
we act with the fierce urgency of now 
to defend the Republic against tyr-
anny, protect the principle of free and 
fair elections, and continue America’s 
long, necessary, and majestic march 
toward a more perfect Union. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from 
New 
Mexico 
(Ms. 
LEGER 
FERNANDEZ). 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, I thank Chair LOFGREN for 
the hard work that she and her cospon-
sor, Representative CHENEY, have done 
on this bill. 
I rise today to safeguard a simple yet 
sacred pillar of our democracy: The 
candidate who wins the election takes 
office. Only the voters’ votes count. It 
will not be overturned by our Vice 
President or any State officer or any 
threats of political violence, threats, 
intimidation, and lies. We cannot let 
violence undermine over 200 years of a 
peaceful transfer of power in this coun-
try. 
I rise today to safeguard the rights of 
every American to have their will re-
flected in those public servants lucky 
enough to serve them. 
We must not forget January 6. Our 
Republican colleagues fighting this bill 
seem to forget that January 6 was a 
violent day of action. We must pass 
this bill so that we do not have a rep-
etition of that. 
Today, I will vote for the Presi-
dential Election Reform Act to fulfill a 
hopeful future for our country. Amer-
ican democracy is the best answer to 
fulfilling our Constitution’s promise of 
inclusion for everyone, regardless of 
race, ethnicity, creed, or economic cir-
cumstance. 
A truly inclusive democracy that 
helps everyone thrive is a constitu-
tional promise we can and must make 
a reality. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Rhode Island (Mr. LANGEVIN). 
Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of the Presi-
dential Election Reform Act. 
January 6, 2021, will forever be known 
as one of the darkest days in our Na-
tion’s history, which threatened the 
very survival of our democracy. Incited 
by a former President, a violent mob 
stormed the Capitol, intent on pre-
venting the peaceful transfer of power 
upon which our democracy depends. 
Thankfully, they failed, and Vice 
President Mike Pence fulfilled his con-
stitutional duty to oversee the count-
ing of the electoral votes. No matter 
what President Trump and his cronies 
claim, the Vice President of the United 
States has no legal authority to reject, 
delay, or otherwise obstruct the count-
ing of the electoral votes. 
Yet, there are those who continue to 
spew the big lie and undermine the le-
gitimacy of future elections. So, today, 
we must reject these dangerous voices 
and pass the Presidential Election Re-
form Act so that we can safeguard our 
democracy from any attempt to over-
turn the will of the people. 
We came perilously close to losing 
our democracy on January 6, 2021. Let 
us come together to protect the rule of 
law and prevent any similar assault on 
our democracy from ever happening 
again. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Wyoming (Ms. CHE-
NEY), the vice chair of the January 6th 
Select Committee. 
Ms. CHENEY. Madam Speaker, I am 
struck 
listening 
to 
my 
colleagues 
today on both sides of the aisle. The 
concept that I think we have to make 
sure we never lose sight of is that some 
things have to matter, and we, as indi-
viduals, determine whether or not our 
institutions survive. 
We have heard consistently since 
January 6—actually, in the weeks just 
after January 6, we were in agreement. 
But shortly after that, we began to

hear excuses about what had happened. 
We began to hear people defending the 
indefensible. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to recognize that when you de-
fend the indefensible, slowly but sure-
ly, you chip away at the great founda-
tions of this Republic. You chip away 
at those very things that we are sworn 
to protect. 
This bill is an excellent bill. This bill 
is a bill that will help to protect the 
rule of law. This bill is a bill that will 
help to ensure that future elections 
cannot be stolen. This bill will ensure 
that, in the future, the United States 
Congress is very clear that we have a 
very limited number of objections that 
can be made, if any can be made at all, 
and those are strictly limited to those 
outlined in the Constitution. 
b 1600 
This bill is a very important and cru-
cial bill to ensure that what happened 
on January 6 never happens again. 
It saddens me, Madam Speaker, that 
my colleagues on this side of the aisle 
continue to play politics. I can tell you 
that is not what we are doing on the 
January 6th Committee. My colleagues 
ought to watch the hearings on the 
January 6th Committee. We have been 
very clear in terms of putting forward 
what happened and in terms of putting 
forth former-President Trump’s respon-
sibility and role in every aspect of the 
attack that happened that day. 
Contrary, again, to the assertions my 
friend and colleague from Illinois made 
previously, what happened on January 
6 was not the normal functioning of 
our democracy. President Trump had 
every right to bring those cases in 
court, but he did not have the right, 
and it was a fundamental violation of 
his oath of office, to refuse to abide by 
the rulings of the court. 
Madam Speaker, we are a Nation of 
laws, not of men. I urge my colleagues 
to pass this bill. It is a very good bill. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, we 
are prepared to close, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I had the oppor-
tunity to testify yesterday before the 
Committee on Rules about how this 
process has been highly partisan, and 
that I would have welcomed an oppor-
tunity to work on the Electoral Count 
Act reforms in a bipartisan way—just 
like the Senate did. 
There is one quote from my friend, 
Ranking Member TOM
COLE, that I 
want to share. As he said, ‘‘Given all 
the majority’s righteous and high- 
minded talk over the last 2 years about 
how democracy itself is in peril, don’t 
you think it would be better served to 
have operated through regular order 
with real Member buy-in on a topic 
that is as important to the American 
people as this one?’’ 
That is how the Senate handled this 
task—in a bipartisan matter driven to-
ward finding consensus. Why shouldn’t 
the House operate in the same way? In-
stead here in the House, every outreach 
made by Republicans to work on this 
issue was rebuffed. 
This bill tramples on State sov-
ereignty. While the Constitution gives 
States the authority to make and in-
terpret their own State laws, this bill 
would grant Congress unprecedented 
authority to determine what State law 
is. 
Second, there is a provision of this 
bill that gives candidates the ability to 
broadly define catastrophic events— 
which could include major natural dis-
asters or acts of terrorism—and then 
use that event to extend the balloting 
after the polls close for up to 5 days. 
Think about it. A candidate could 
pull a Pelosi and request a change in 
the rules supposedly because of the 
COVID–19 pandemic, despite the fact 
that the majority of the country has 
moved on—including President Biden 
who declared the pandemic is over, just 
to extend voting for 5 more days for 
their political benefit. 
Or remember just last year, when 
President Biden’s FBI labeled con-
cerned parents attending their chil-
dren’s school PTA meetings domestic 
terrorists? 
With many polling at schools, a can-
didate could try to claim that parents 
meeting is a catastrophic event. We 
also can’t forget that many Democrats 
have 
claimed 
that 
Republican-led 
States with newly enacted election in-
tegrity laws like Florida are sup-
pressing voters. 
Could a candidate then try to claim 
voter suppression because they don’t 
like their State’s laws and then request 
the polls stay open once they see elec-
tion results that aren’t going their 
way? 
This bill would create a new private 
right of action for all Presidential can-
didates or their electors and specifi-
cally expand the scope of the right to 
tabulate. 
This creates a big question as to how 
and if Congress has the authority to re-
quire candidates to go to Federal court 
to force them to follow State law. 
I mean, I can just picture the field 
day election lawyers like sanctioned 
Democrat Marc Elias would have with 
these provisions all while creating 
mass confusion for voters who will 
question if their vote was even count-
ed. Voters don’t need Congress to come 
in and overcomplicate the ECA process 
that has worked for the last 135 years. 
As a reminder, we came back the 
night of January 6, after the tragic 
events that we all witnessed here in 
this Capitol, and we certified Joe Biden 
as President and KAMALA HARRIS as 
Vice President. 
What voters want is to show up on 
election day, easily cast their ballot, 
know that their ballot is counted in ac-
cordance with the law, and for election 
results to come in later that night. But 
this bill doesn’t do that. Instead, it 
could very well do the opposite. 
This bill does nothing to prevent an-
other mob from attacking the Capitol. 
Neither Mike Pence doing what every 
Vice President in history has done nor 
lawful constitutional objections being 
filed caused a mob to attack—and 
clarifying those responsibilities won’t 
prevent another mob. 
That is why this bill won’t even see 
the light of day over in the Senate and 
why we should have used the bipartisan 
Senate version as a starting point. 
Maybe then we could actually enact 
some necessary updates to improve and 
clarify the certification process and 
focus on the big unanswered problem— 
the security of the Capitol. Bad actors 
by definition don’t follow the law so 
any changes made to the Electoral 
Count Act aren’t a silver bullet. 
As I have been saying this entire 
Congress, we need to be focused on why 
the Capitol was left so unprotected on 
that day in January. Why was a mob 
able to breach one of the most signifi-
cant buildings on our planet? 
Again, I invite all of my Democrat 
colleagues to work with me to improve 
the security of this Capitol and the 
people it holds. That is how we prevent 
another attack. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to oppose this bill because it is 
both bad process and bad policy. The 
American people deserve better. They 
deserve to have full confidence in the 
election process and the outcomes. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, may 
I inquire how much time remains? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
MCCOLLUM). The gentlewoman has 91⁄4 
minutes remaining. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I think it is important to talk about 
the January 6th Select Committee. 
Since its creation more than a year 
ago, the select committee has given 
substantial attention to the issues re-
lated to the Electoral Count Act and 
its need for reform. 
Let’s recall that in addition to find-
ing out all the facts of the events lead-
ing up to January 6, the select com-
mittee is tasked with recommending 
changes in the law or in procedures 
that will prevent such an occurrence in 
the future. 
The select committee has devoted 
multiple public hearings, over more 
than 41⁄2 hours, to issues related to the 
Electoral Count Act and the former 
President’s efforts to overturn the elec-
tion on January 6. 
During these hearings, the com-
mittee heard from at least four wit-
nesses regarding the electoral college 
votes and other issues related to the 
act. 
Importantly, conservative judge, Mi-
chael Luttig, who is a legal expert and 
served in the Reagan administration 
and was appointed by President H.W. 
Bush to the United States Court of Ap-
peals for the Fourth Circuit, testified

before the select committee that the 
Electoral Count Act, ‘‘ . . . is not only 
a work in progress for the country, but 
at this moment in history an impor-
tant work in progress that needs to 
take place.’’ 
He testified with reference to the 
Electoral Count Act that, ‘‘ . . . Donald 
Trump and his allies and supporters 
are a clear and present danger to 
American democracy.’’ 
Now, why is that? 
Because even though the presiding 
officer of the Senate, the Vice Presi-
dent, has never had more than a min-
isterial role to play in the counting of 
the votes, the former President told 
people that he could change the out-
come. He said so in his speech. He said 
so in tweets. He threatened the Vice 
President. And we saw that that armed 
mob that came here to attack us be-
lieved what the former President said. 
In fact, they read allowed the tweets 
as he delivered them, and how Mike 
Pence had disappointed him. 
Madam Speaker, Judge Luttig said 
this about the bill that Ms. CHENEY and 
I have introduced: ‘‘Had this bill, the 
Presidential Election Reform Act, been 
the law during the 2020 Presidential 
election, there never would have been 
the fateful January 6 that the country 
witnessed and experienced that day.’’ 
He also went on to say this bill is 
masterfully drafted. Now, why would 
he say that? 
Well, it is. But we also sought his 
considered judgment and expertise as 
we crafted this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD his remarks on this: 
This week, Congresswoman LIZ
CHENEY 
and Congresswoman ZOE LOFGREN introduced 
a bipartisan bill in the House to reform the 
Electoral Count Act of 1887. This bill rep-
resents a comprehensive and compelling 
Rule of Law overhaul of the anachronistic 
ECA. 
Had this bill, the Presidential Election Re-
form Act, been the law during the 2020 Presi-
dential election, there never would have 
been the fateful January 6 that the country 
witnessed and experienced that day. 
Indeed, had this bill been the law before 
the 1876 presidential election, which was the 
impetus for the current Electoral Count Act, 
the country never would have experienced 
the election upheaval of that quadrennial 
presidential election. 
The Cheney-Lofgren bill is masterfully 
drafted so as to require the state governors 
to transmit to Congress only what are de-
fined by the bill as the ‘conclusive’ electoral 
votes for the presidency representing the 
popular vote of the states, a transmittal that 
will only occur after any and all disputes 
over those votes have been resolved by the 
state and federal courts. 
Then, during the Joint Session, Congress 
will be allowed only a few, very narrow 
grounds to object to these ‘conclusive’ votes, 
all of which grounds are related to the tech-
nical constitutional qualifications of the 
electors or their electoral votes. 
Thirty percent of each, the Senate and the 
House, must concur in an objection in order 
for it to be put before the two Chambers of 
Congress for resolution and decision. An ob-
jection must be agreed upon by fifty percent 
of both chambers in order for it to be sus-
tained. 
With the Cheney-Lofgren bipartisan bill 
scheduled to be voted on in the House tomor-
row, it now appears that there is not only bi-
partisan, but also bicameral, support for the 
desperately-needed reform of the ECA. 
I urge the Senate and the House to quickly 
conference and resolve their differences in a 
law that will ensure there will never again 
be another January 6 in America. 
Madam Speaker, this is a bill that 
has been well received across the polit-
ical spectrum. 
Now, we have got a Wall Street Jour-
nal report saying: ‘‘The good news is 
that the House now has a bill to update 
the 1887 Electoral Count Act. . . . ’’ 
They go on to say, ‘‘There’s no excuse 
for Congress’s delay in fixing this invi-
tation to political trouble.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD an article from the Wall Street 
Journal and an article from the Wash-
ington Post. 
[From the Wall Street Journal, Sept. 20,

LIZ CHENEY’S ELECTORAL COUNT ACT BILL TO 
STOP A JAN. 6 REPEAT 
(By the Editorial Board) 
The good news is that the House now has a 
bill to update the 1887 Electoral Count Act, 
the antiquated law implicated in the Jan. 6 
Capitol riot. Even better, the legislation un-
veiled this week by Republican Liz Cheney 
and Democrat Zoe Lofgren reads like it’s an 
improvement, in some respects, of the Sen-
ate version. 
The House plan says the Vice President’s 
role when Congress tallies the Electoral Col-
lege ‘‘is ministerial.’’ The VP can’t on his 
own ‘‘order any delay in counting.’’ This re-
sponds to President Trump’s claim in 2020 
that Mike Pence could seize control of the 
joint session. Mr. Trump’s legal argument 
relied on a lack of clarity in the 12th Amend-
ment, which can’t be fixed by statute. Still, 
it would be helpful to have Mr. Trump’s the-
ory contradicted by the law and Congress’s 
explicit procedure. 
The House bill says Electoral College cer-
tificates ‘‘shall be accepted as conclusive’’ if 
submitted by a state’s Governor, unless a 
court orders otherwise. If a rogue Governor 
refuses to certify the real winner, federal 
courts could ‘‘direct another official of the 
State’’ to complete the job. A three-judge 
panel would preside, with appeal to the Su-
preme Court. The date for electors to vote 
would be pushed to Dec. 23, providing more 
room for challenges to play out. 
Where the House bill might be an improve-
ment is in making it harder for partisans in 
Congress who want to get C-Span-famous to 
lodge phony Electoral College objections. 
Only a specified set of complaints would be 
heard, such as if a state sends too many elec-
tors; if electors vote on the wrong day or are 
ineligible; or if the presidential or vice presi-
dential candidate is ineligible. No whining 
on the House floor that somebody had a 
funny feeling about the vote totals in west 
southeastern Pennsylvania. 
The Senate bill offers similar finality to 
the Governor’s certificate. Yet it would con-
tinue to permit Congress to object vaguely 
that an elector’s vote wasn’t ‘‘regularly 
given.’’ That’s the same phrase Congress has 
abused for years, and in 2020 an alarming 147 
House and Senate Republicans objected. An 
ideal reform would stop this grandstanding. 
Hence, the House bill’s idea to enumerate 
specific grounds for legitimate objections. 
Ms. Cheney and Ms. Lofgren also propose 
to lift the threshold for objections. Under 
the current Electoral Count Act, a single 
Senator working with a single Representa-
tive can force Congress to debate their wild 
claims. The Senate bill would require signa-
tures from a fifth of each chamber. The 
House bill raises that to a third. How about 
they keep going and compromise at two 
fifths? More is better, but requiring 33 Sen-
ators is better than needing only Sen. Josh 
Hawley or Rep. Jim Clyburn. 
The best approach remains for lawmakers 
to get out of this objection business and 
leave such disputes to the courts. The House 
bill retains a purported authority to reject 
Electoral College votes if Congress decides 
that the incoming President is constitu-
tionally ineligible. But isn’t 14 days before 
Inauguration Day a little late for that, 
folks? Imagine if President Trump wins a 
landslide in 2024 and then Democrats move 
to invalidate his electors, saying that Mr. 
Trump led an ‘‘insurrection’’ as defined 
under the 14th Amendment. 
Perhaps it’s unrealistic to expect law-
makers to give up the power they arrogated 
in 1887, but the madness of Jan. 6, 2021, 
should have made a convincing case. It’s ask-
ing for trouble to enshrine any political 
process for overturning the will of the voters 
two weeks before the transfer of power is 
scheduled to take place. Last time it was 
voting machines in Michigan, and before 
that it was Russian interference, and before 
that it was voting machines in Ohio . . . but 
it’s always something for Congress’s par-
tisans. 
Nevertheless, a bill to make that prospect 
less likely goes in the right direction, espe-
cially if it cuts off the microphone for the 
sour grapes and conspiracy theories that 
marred the counting after 2000, 2004, 2016 and 
2020. 
This reform should have been the top pri-
ority for Congress and the Jan. 6 committee 
from the beginning, but their priority has 
been replaying the riot rather than trying to 
prevent the next one. Let’s hope it isn’t too 
late in this Congress to get this done at last. 
[From the Washington Post, Sept. 20, 2022] 
OPINION A NEW AND IMPROVED VERSION OF 
ELECTORAL COUNT ACT REFORM 
(By Jennifer Rubin) 
The compromise proposal that Senate ne-
gotiators cobbled together earlier this year 
to reform the 1887 Electoral Count Act was a 
good start to prevent a repeat of the 2020 
coup attempt. But the bill was far from per-
fect, as testimony before the Senate Rules 
Committee highlighted. 
Fortunately, two members of the House se-
lect committee investigating the Jan. 6 in-
surrection, Reps. Liz Cheney (R–Wyo.) and 
Zoe Lofgren (D–Calif.) put forth their own 
improved version on Monday, as described in 
an opinion piece for the Wall Street Journal. 
Their proposal makes a number of key 
changes to the law, which stipulates the cer-
tification of electoral votes. For example: 
It confirms that the vice president has 
only a ceremonial role. 
It specifies that members of Congress can 
only object to electoral votes if they concern 
‘‘the explicit constitutional requirements for 
candidate and elector eligibility and the 12th 
Amendment’s explicit requirements for elec-
tor balloting.’’ Interestingly, the proposal 
makes clear that one objection might be 
that the candidate is ineligible under Sec-
tion 3 of the 14th Amendment, which bars 
from federal office anyone who ‘‘engaged in 
insurrection or rebellion against the same, 
or given aid or comfort to the enemies there-
of.’’ In other words, it would serve as a trip 
wire for challenging former president Donald 
Trump on the basis that he instigated an 
‘‘insurrection.’’ 
It raises the threshold for Congress to vote 
on an objection from one lawmaker in each 
chamber to one-third of each chamber.

September 21, 2022 
The proposal also avoids some of the con-
fusing language included in the Senate pro-
posal regarding state certification. The 
House version is a helpful and precise de-
scription of the correct process: 
Governors must transmit lawful election 
results to Congress; if they fail to fulfill that 
duty, or another official prevents the lawful 
results from being transmitted, candidates 
for the presidency should be able to sue in 
federal court to ensure that Congress re-
ceives the state’s lawful certificate. These 
suits would occur before Congress counts 
electoral votes, and should ensure, in all 
cases where one candidate has the majority 
of electoral votes, that Congress’s proceeding 
on Jan. 6 is purely ministerial. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I 
was very happy to get that support 
from the organization, from The Wall 
Street Journal, but we also got kudos 
from Cato, that well-known conserv-
ative institution, that they say this 
bill is actually more conservative and 
originalist as compared to other meas-
ures. 
It is not every day that the Center 
for American Progress and the Cato In-
stitute see it the same way. But they 
do in this case. Both organizations, 
right to left, agree that this is an ap-
propriate step to take and that it will 
help make our country safer. 
Madam Speaker, I would address a 
couple other issues before closing. 
First, it is unfortunate that my 
friend, Mr. DAVIS, has said something 
that is clearly inaccurate. In the bill 
itself it defines what is a disaster. It is 
not somebody saying, gosh, there’s 
COVID. It is a tightly defined set of ca-
tastrophes that will be decided by a 
Federal three-judge panel and will be 
limited just in time and scope so that 
people could have their votes cast and 
counted. 
I also want to address something I 
think is very unfortunate, the sugges-
tion that somehow I had a role in try-
ing to overturn the election in Iowa. 
Nothing could be further from the 
truth. 
The Federal Contested Election Act 
says this: 
A candidate challenging an election, is re-
quired within 30 days after the result of their 
election, to file with the clerk and serve 
upon the contestee written notice of the in-
tention to contest an election. 
Once that is done, it is assigned to 
the House administration committee. 
It wasn’t my idea. That is what our 
rule says. And there is a process that 
has to be undertaken. 
Now, we didn’t finish that process be-
cause the contestee withdrew, which 
was her right, and frankly, I was glad 
that the matter was terminated. But 
that is just what the law requires. 
Madam Speaker, I would make a 
final comment about the objections 
under this proposed law. It is true that 
Members of both sides of the aisle have 
randomly objected to certification of 
the electoral college. I think, honestly, 
that is unfortunate. But we never saw 
a majority of one party vote to over-
turn the election as we did on January 
6 of 2020. 
What this bill would do would be to 
make sure you could never have those 
kinds of objections in the future. We 
did some research. We believe that 
under our bill, not a single objection in 
the last 100 years would have been al-
lowed under this bill. The last example 
was a disagreement in 1873 about 
whether a candidate who passed away 
after the election still qualified as a 
person for Article II purposes. That 
would be covered under the limited set. 
But this would put an end to using 
frivolous challenges to the electoral 
count. And that is another good reason 
why we should pass this bill today. 
Madam Speaker, 234 years ago, the 
authors of The Federalist Papers asked 
this: ‘‘Who are to be the electors of the 
Federal Representatives? Not the rich, 
more than the poor; not the learned, 
more than the ignorant; not the haugh-
ty heirs of distinguished names, more 
than the humble sons of obscurity. . . . 
The electors are to be the great body of 
the people of the United States.’’ 
That is the message that resonates to 
this day. This bill will ensure that the 
voice of the American people is the 
final word on the future of our Repub-
lic. 
All told, the reforms in this bill con-
fine Congress to its true narrow role in 
Presidential elections under the 12th 
Amendment. 
I hope and trust that my colleagues 
on both sides of the aisle would join us 
in this critical effort to protect Amer-
ican democracy and to ensure, in Presi-
dent Lincoln’s words at Gettysburg, 
‘‘that government of the people, by the 
people,’’ and ‘‘for the people’’ long en-
dures. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1372, the pre-
vious question is ordered on the bill. 
The question is on the engrossment 
and third reading of the bill. 
The bill was ordered to be engrossed 
and read a third time, and was read the 
third time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on passage of the bill. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, on that I demand the 
yeas and nays. 
The yeas and nays were ordered. 
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 229, nays

MOURNING THE LOSS OF BEN AND 
MAX MORRISSEY 
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today with deep sadness to pay tribute 
to two highly-skilled U.S. Steel work-
ers, brothers, Ben and Max Morrissey, 
who tragically lost their lives at the 
British Petroleum Refinery in my 
hometown. Yesterday, while on the job 
at the BP Husky plant in Oregon, Ohio, 
their lives were cut short in a horrific 
explosion. 
Responsible citizens, husbands, and 
fathers who performed America’s es-
sential work that drives progress and 
our American way of life forward, these 
brave men will never again return 
home to their dear families. They leave 
behind very young children who will 
come to understand the gravity of 
their fathers’ loss. 
My heart goes out to their precious 
families and with their brothers and 
sisters in the United Steelworkers 
Local 1–346 who lost two beloved 
friends. 
In our grief, we also extend our deep 
gratitude to the brave first responders 
who rushed to the scene, provided aid, 
and helped keep our community safe. 
Today is a heartbreaking day for the 
people of northwest Ohio. We have 
flown flags in honor of Ben and Max 
Morrissey high above the U.S. Capitol 
today. We lift up the memory of them 
to their loved ones in our hearts, and 
we pray that they may find solace and 
comfort in the memories that they will 
always have of their treasured hus-
bands, fathers, and sons, and that to-
gether they may heal. 
May God be with them all. 
f 
REFORMING THE ELECTORAL 
COUNT 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to support the Presidential 
Election Reform Act which is long 
overdue. 
As I stand in the well, I can still see 
the images of January 6, 2021. I can 
hear the gunfire. I can hear and see the 
directions of our very able Capitol Po-
lice to tell Members to hit the ground. 
I can see the banging on the doors. 
Thank goodness this act will reform 
the electoral count to ensure that Con-
gress counts the votes as required by 
the Constitution, including by ensuring 
that Congress receive a single accurate 
electoral count certificate from each 
State—no phony electors as evidenced 
by President Trump’s attempt to bring 
down this Nation. 
Requiring that the States select elec-
tors to accomplish this in accordance 
with State law existing as of the last 
election, it will reaffirm that the Vice 
President’s role at the count is min-
isterial, raise the objection threshold 
to one-third instead of one person, one 
Member, and limit the explicit con-
stitutional grounds upon which Mem-
bers may object to a State electoral 
vote. They will list the explicit con-
stitutional grounds. There will be order 
to the process. 
This is a democracy admired around 
the world. We must defend this democ-
racy, and we are defending it by voting 
today on the Presidential Election Re-
form Act. This is what we should do, 
the Presidential Election Reform Act. 
f 
FARMERS NEED WATER 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. 
LAMALFA. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
with the 50th anniversary of the Clean 
Water Act, it is important to remind 
the Biden administration that Con-
gress did not give the EPA jurisdiction 
over every puddle in America, despite 
what they are trying to claim. 
The 2015 Waters of the United States 
rule was nothing short of a land and 
water grab that gave bureaucrats the 
ability to meddle in intermittent and 
ephemeral streams, such as the kind 
farmers use for draining and irrigation. 
Under the 2015 WOTUS rule, the EPA 
could fine farmers thousands of dollars 
if they simply rotated from one crop to 
another on their own land without first 
gaining permission from a Government 
entity. 
Then 
the 
Trump 
administration, 
through the Navigable Waters Protec-
tion Rule, eliminated the significant 
nexus standard set by the WOTUS rule 
which solved much of the overreach 
and uncertainty around it. 
The Navigable Waters Protection 
Rule clearly identified WOTUS in six 
categories and made further clarifica-
tions of the definitions of tributaries 
and adjacent wetlands. 
So I was very dismayed by the EPA’s 
and U.S. Corps of Engineers’ decision 
to reverse the 2020 Navigable Waters 
Protection Rule and restart the rule-
making process around the definition 
of what is a navigable water. 
If President Biden were serious about 
helping farmers grow food to supply 
Americans and the world during this 
global food shortage, he would return 
to the Navigable Waters Protection 
Rule to give farmers certainty and 
then customers at the grocery store 
shelf certainty in price and availability 
of food. 
f 
YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
STANSBURY). Under the Speaker’s an-
nounced policy of January 4, 2021, the 
gentleman from New York (Mr. BOW-
MAN) is recognized for 60 minutes as the 
designee of the majority leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. BOWMAN. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on the subject of my 
Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. BOWMAN. Madam Speaker, to-
night, I am convening a Special Order 
hour for the Congressional Progressive 
Caucus, and we are focused on the ur-
gent matter of our children’s mental 
health, which is in crisis. 
Madam Speaker, I want everyone lis-
tening to me now to think about their 
childhood. 
What stressors, if any, did you expe-
rience? 
What kept you up at night? 
What made your heart skip a beat or 
your palms sweaty? 
What 
seemed 
completely 
over-
whelming? 
Now think of who was there to help 
you, listen to you, and comfort you.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H8049 
September 21, 2022 
Now imagine that stressor, and imag-
ine dealing with that same issue in a 
time when the worldwide pandemic 
forced you to remain at home for more 
than 1 year before you returned to 
school 
with 
constantly 
fluctuating 
COVID policies; in a world where the 
book you read last year is banned in 
school now; in a world where you spend 
a significant amount of time on social 
media consuming stories and pictures 
of other peoples’ lives, and that in-
cludes 
coming 
across 
lies 
and 
disinformation; in a world where a 
former President wanted to build a 
wall, where death is ubiquitous, and 
where food, gas, and housing prices are 
so high you often go without the basic 
necessities; in a world where the Su-
preme Court has stripped basic human 
rights that your parents and grand-
parents were able to enjoy. 
Could you imagine being a child right 
now and juggling your mental health? 
Mental health is essential for overall 
health, and ignoring that basic fact is 
harmful to our children who are count-
ing on us to do everything in our power 
to support them during this difficult 
time. 
This pandemic has exacerbated many 
preexisting challenges, stressors, and 
trauma experienced by our youth. 
It has also caused many new chal-
lenges. 
In December 2021, the U.S. Surgeon 
General, Dr. Vivek Murthy, issued an 
advisory highlighting the urgent need 
to address the Nation’s youth mental 
health crisis. 
Last fall, the American Academy of 
Pediatrics, the American Academy of 
Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, and 
the Children’s Hospital Association 
jointly declared a national state of 
emergency in children’s mental health. 
Prior to coming to Congress, I had 
the privilege of serving New York City 
children in our public schools for over 
20 years. I served as an elementary 
school teacher, a high school guidance 
counselor, and a middle school prin-
cipal. 
The education, care, and well-being 
of our children are my life’s work, and 
it is an honor to speak on the floor to-
night to highlight an urgent issue that 
is critical to the health and safety of 
our children and the future of our de-
mocracy: our children’s mental health. 
During the 2017–2018 school year, 34 
children died within the K–12 school 
system in the Bronx, and 17 died via 
suicide. In early 2018, the horrible 
Parkland High School shooting hap-
pened, killing 17 children and wounding 
17 more while leaving a nation reeling 
in despair. 
During this time as a middle school 
principal, I saw a rise in student self- 
harm and suicidal ideation in kids as 
young as 11 years old. It was these fac-
tors that ultimately led me to run for 
Congress in the first place. 
Since the pandemic, an unprece-
dented number of our young people feel 
helpless and hopeless right now, and we 
need to make an unprecedented effort 
for a coordinated, comprehensive re-
sponse. That is why at the end of last 
year we called for a new COVID relief 
package that considers the needs of the 
whole child to support overall health, 
including youth mental health. 
The toll of the pandemic is daunting 
when we consider its impact on chil-
dren. In the past 2 years, more than 
167,000 children across the country 
have lost a parent or primary caregiver 
to COVID–19. These caregivers provided 
a child’s most important basic needs: 
love, security, food, and shelter. More 
than 13,000 of these children lost their 
only caregiver. In fact, for every four 
COVID–19 deaths, one child in the U.S. 
loses a parent. 
A student in my district in Yonkers 
shared her experience of suddenly los-
ing her father to COVID followed by 
her mother testing positive. She de-
scribed her fear and not being able to 
sleep while her mother was in an in-
duced coma for 9 days. She couldn’t 
eat, and she couldn’t go to school. Be-
cause of her father’s immigration sta-
tus, he was excluded from almost all 
types of medical insurance and was 
forced 
to 
choose 
between 
basic 
healthcare and food. 
Her story is not the only one like 
this, which is why we need to drive re-
sources so that schools can directly 
support students’ mental health and so 
we can break down barriers to basic, 
necessary healthcare for all regardless 
of immigration status. 
After experiencing the major trau-
matic loss of a parent, we know the 
world as these children knew it has 
ended. Loss and grief are a part of life, 
but in children grieving, a major loss 
can have lifelong impacts of depres-
sion, 
post-traumatic 
stress, 
and 
anxiety. 
b 1715 
For parents and those of us who work 
directly with children, it is heart-
breaking to see one child grieving. 
With this vast number of grieving chil-
dren, our entire community must be 
ready to empathize and mobilize the 
help they need to cope. 
In addition to the stress youth are 
under as a result of COVID–19 and this 
ongoing pandemic, they are also facing 
other mental health issues as they 
navigate puberty and being an adoles-
cent. Youth across the country are bat-
tling substance abuse, eating and body 
image disorders, facing various forms 
of peer pressure, anxiety, and overall 
trying to learn how to manage their 
emotions and feelings during their 
formative years. This is a reality 
across racial and economic lines. 
Still, meaningful mental health care 
is out of reach for so many children. 
Native American or Indigenous chil-
dren are 41⁄2 times as likely as White 
children to have lost a parent to 
COVID. Black children are almost 21⁄2 
times more likely than White children, 
and Hispanic children are nearly twice 
as likely than White children to have 
lost a parent or caregiver. 
When we also consider that many 
families who face job losses, loss of in-
surance, financial hardships, and a lack 
of school-based mental health profes-
sionals, the barriers to youth mental 
health support are unacceptable. 
Madam Speaker, I yield such time as 
she may consume to the gentlewoman 
from New Jersey (Mrs. WATSON COLE-
MAN). 
Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Madam 
Speaker, I thank my colleague for or-
ganizing this very important moment 
on the floor of the House of Represent-
atives to address what is a critical, ur-
gent issue, and crisis in our country 
right now. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to draw 
attention to this public health crisis 
that our Nation has yet to adequately 
address. Over the last 13 years, youth 
mental well-being has plummeted. The 
Surgeon General’s office reported that 
between 2009 and 2019, the share of high 
school students reporting persistent 
sadness or hopelessness increased by 40 
percent, while the share of those con-
templating suicide increased by 36 per-
cent. 
The COVID pandemic has only made 
this worse. The youth mental health 
crisis—in many ways, a pandemic of its 
own—has only worsened in recent 
years. While the President’s COVID re-
sponse has been significantly more ef-
fective than that of his predecessor, we 
cannot properly address COVID with-
out addressing the mental health con-
sequences of over 2 years of isolation, 
uncertainty, and historic amounts of 
death and suffering. 
Black and Brown youth are among 
those hurting the most. In 2019, my 
Emergency Task force on Black Youth 
Suicide 
and 
Mental 
Health 
found 
alarming increases in suicide rates 
among Black youth, in part caused by 
racial disparities in access to care. As 
of last year, that rate of increase is 
more than twice as high for Black girls 
and Black boys. 
In response to this, I introduced the 
Pursuing Equity in Mental Health Act, 
which would invest in our entire men-
tal health care system. That means not 
just funding additional mental health 
research, but also establishing a stig-
ma-shattering outreach program and 
building a larger, stronger, more cul-
turally competent mental health care 
workforce. 
To fight America’s youth mental 
health crisis, we must prioritize equity 
and do everything in our power to 
eliminate racial and gender-based men-
tal health disparities. This is an impor-
tant moment in our time in Congress. 
We have devastation, sadness, and in-
credibly devastating responses to sad-
ness at a very young age. 
Madam Speaker, I did not know that 
a 5-year-old could comprehend that 
ending his or her life was an answer to 
the pain that he or she has been experi-
encing, but I know that it has hap-
pened. As a result of seeing those posts 
over and over and over and over again 
on Facebook and other platforms, that

is what motivated me to pull together 
that emergency task force. It has 
yielded such tremendous information 
that we need as a country to know—to 
know that we need to invest in all as-
pects of healthcare as it relates to the 
disparities that exist with access to 
mental health care as well as just 
healthcare in general. 
We must do better. We have so much 
to overcome. We can do better, and I 
look forward to my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle and in both Houses to 
work collaboratively to do better for 
this next generation. 
Mr. BOWMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN for her 
leadership and her voice in this impor-
tant matter. 
Madam Speaker, I want to talk brief-
ly before yielding to Representative 
CARTER from New Orleans. I want to 
speak briefly about the role of schools 
in addressing the issue of mental 
health. 
Our schools play an essential role in 
supporting positive mental health for 
our youth. In order to serve the whole 
child, we cannot limit our Federal sup-
port to only academic outcomes. Chil-
dren are much more likely to receive 
mental health services in the school 
than anywhere else, but the problem is 
that too few of our schools have 
enough mental health professionals on 
staff, including psychologists, social 
workers, and counselors. The ratio of 
students to school psychologists is 
roughly 1400 to 1. 
Just this year I hosted a town hall 
with students in my district who 
shared how hard it was for them to 
meet with a counselor or mental health 
professional at school. The students 
with more access to mental health re-
sources went to schools in wealthier 
parts of my district. 
As a former principal, I know first-
hand how important it is that the 
schools have the resources to employ 
mental health professionals. More than 
14 million students attend a school 
with police officers or school resource 
officers, but no counselors, nurses, psy-
chologists, or social workers on staff. 
The way we allocate resources is a 
reflection of our priorities and our val-
ues, which is why I support unprece-
dented levels of funding that prioritizes 
the mental health of all our students 
by making sure there are trained, cul-
turally competent mental health pro-
fessionals in every public school, in-
cluding more Black and Brown mental 
health professionals. 
For the last 21⁄2 years, we have seen 
our schools at the front lines of re-
sponding to the COVID–19 pandemic. In 
many ways, we as a society have shift-
ed how we think about what it means 
to care for our young people in the face 
of multiple public health crises. 
Together, with our schools leading 
the way, we worked to create a safety 
net for our children and prioritize the 
well-being of the whole child. These are 
the kinds of investments that can buff-
er children from chronic stress that 
can lead to adverse childhood experi-
ences, or ACEs. 
It should go without saying, our kids 
are so much more than any one test 
score or academic measure. Children 
are individuals who are members of 
their community, and our schools 
should be subsequently funded and 
equipped as community hubs. Sup-
porting our children’s success is fun-
damentally 
intertwined 
with 
sup-
porting the whole child in a well-co-
ordinated ecosystem of wraparound 
services. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the distin-
guished gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. 
CARTER). 
Mr. CARTER of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I thank Congressman BOWMAN 
for organizing this hour to discuss such 
a critical issue, and I thank him for his 
leadership. 
Madam Speaker, today I rise in sup-
port of the opportunity to shine light 
on this critical issue of mental health. 
Our children are our most precious 
treasures. For many of us, they are our 
reason why. 
Why we work two jobs. Why we go to 
school. Why we try to overcome per-
sonal challenges and become the best 
version of ourselves. Yet, our system is 
failing to help our dear children fight 
their 
own 
demons. 
From 
kinder-
gartners to young adults, young people 
of all ages are struggling with mental 
health and that they are not being met 
with the services they need to be 
happy, to be healthy, and tragically, to 
save their lives. 
It is truly a crisis, and like most cri-
ses we face, the situation is worse for 
some communities than others, and 
certainly it is the case for communities 
of color. 
Here is a terrifying statistic: Black 
children under the age of 13 are twice 
as likely to die by suicide compared to 
their White peers—twice as likely. 
Further, children who survive nat-
ural disasters—like many of my con-
stituents in southeast Louisiana—are 
left with emotional scars that can im-
pact them for their entire lives. A new 
study published by the Journal of Child 
Psychology and Psychiatry found that 
the stress of experiencing a natural dis-
aster during a pregnancy can substan-
tially increase the risk of childhood de-
pression and anxiety. 
It is clear that we are in a crisis, and 
we must act to meet the moment. I am 
so grateful that the Institute of Women 
and Ethnic Studies of New Orleans has 
been granted $400,000 from HHS for an 
initiative to help identify health and 
wellness policies that are successful in 
improving Black youth mental health, 
and including suicide prevention. 
This year, Congress just passed the 
Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, 
which will help keep guns out of the 
hands of individuals who are in danger 
of potentially hurting themselves or 
others. But this historic bill also in-
cludes $500 million for school-based 
mental health services, and millions 
more for certified community behav-
ioral health clinics and mental health 
telehealth. 
This year, we also launched the 988 
hotline, a mental health hotline and 
text line, where people can reach 
trained counselors in their time of 
need. We must, we can, we will do 
more. We must make mental health 
service easy, accessible, and affordable 
to everyone, particularly our children. 
We must tear down the stigma and 
equalize mental health and physical 
health. It is okay to not be okay. Ev-
eryone needs support at a different 
point in their lives. Everyone needs a 
little extra help sometimes. Everyone 
can feel a little down sometimes. Ev-
eryone has issues that they think are 
insurmountable. But guess what? With 
help, with treatment, help is there, and 
you can survive it. You have got to 
know that. 
Don’t ever be afraid to ask for help. 
Don’t ever be afraid to admit that you 
just don’t feel right. Don’t ever be 
afraid to admit that you don’t fit in, 
that you feel different. Help is there. 
And we have all had moments where we 
needed help. You have got to know 
that you can survive, and you will sur-
vive this. 
We must all be trained about the 
signs of mental health crises and look 
out for one another. Implementing 
many of these programs and supporting 
the mental health professionals who 
provide these services may have a sig-
nificant price tag, and from my per-
spective, it is essential. 
Any dollar that we spend, any money 
that we appropriate that saves a life, 
that gives individuals hope that we 
care and that resources are available, 
are dollars well spent. 
We need to do more. We need to in-
vest in programs and have staff that 
change and save lives. We need to do it 
now. We need to continue to fight. Our 
children are worth it. 
When someone has high blood pres-
sure, they exercise, they diet, they 
take a pill. If someone has diabetes, 
they exercise, they diet, they take a 
pill. They modify their lifestyles, and 
they are not ashamed to admit those 
things. Mental health is no different. 
There is nothing wrong with admit-
ting that you may need help because 
help is there for you, and we know em-
pirically that the resources are there, 
and they make a difference. We have 
got to get away from feeling like if we 
need help that somehow some way that 
means something is wrong with me. 
Well, there is nothing wrong with you. 
There is nothing more wrong with you 
than a person that has a headache who 
takes an aspirin. 
b 1730 
There is nothing more wrong with 
you than somebody who has high blood 
pressure and takes blood pressure med-
icine. We can fix it. You are not alone. 
It is important that you know. 
To anyone who is struggling, who has 
children or young people in their lives 
who are struggling, you are not alone.

You will never be alone. Things will 
get better. 
Reach out. 988 is available to you 24/ 
7. Experts are waiting to heed your 
call. Organizations are funded to help 
you. We are here to help you. 
You are not alone, and you can and 
will survive. 
Mr. BOWMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Representative CARTER so much 
for his powerful words and leadership 
and for being here this evening. 
When we consider the toll of a na-
tionwide youth mental health crisis, 
our mission must be to show love to 
our youth and to help our young people 
learn to love themselves, their commu-
nities, and our planet. 
In the face of so many real-world 
challenges, like the climate crisis, the 
pandemic, and extreme inequality and 
discrimination, it is essential that 
children’s 
learning 
prioritizes 
cre-
ativity, innovation, critical thinking, 
problem-solving, communication, and 
collaboration as these approaches all 
support the mental health and the 
overall development of our children. 
These are the 21st century learning 
skills that will empower and teach our 
students how to think, not what to 
think. 
When the purpose of education is 
about fostering the value and ethic of 
lifelong learning as a fundamental pil-
lar of democracy, it is abundantly clear 
that promoting positive mental health 
is fundamental to that work. 
But when we try to apply a business 
model to our schools and treat our stu-
dents as commodities, making the nec-
essary investments in mental health 
support 
and 
social 
and 
emotional 
learning gets sidelined in favor of a 
more simplistic bottom line that im-
properly fixates on the results of an an-
nual assessment. 
We have subjected our public schools 
to this model for 20 years, and it hasn’t 
addressed inequity in our schools. It 
has not closed any gaps. What it has 
done is limit what gets taught and how 
it gets taught. 
It has prioritized doing well academi-
cally over developing the lifelong skills 
that you need, including your emo-
tional health and well-being. It has 
made students feel that their chance to 
live a quality life with opportunities 
hinges on how they do on a singular 
exam. 
We have the opportunity to change 
this, finally, and do right by our stu-
dents. The idea that our schools should 
be equipped to meet the holistic needs 
of their students is not one that should 
exist only in a time of a pandemic. We 
cannot go back to our old ways of 
thinking about schools just in terms of 
narrowly defined academic perform-
ance. 
Even before the pandemic, rates of 
young 
people 
experiencing 
mental 
health issues were rising. Between 2007 
and 2019, the percentage of adolescents 
reporting a major depressive episode 
increased by nearly 60 percent. By 2019, 
mental health disorders had exceeded 
physical conditions as the most com-
mon cause of impairments and limita-
tions amongst children. 
I saw the gaps in our health system 
up close. Schools are the most common 
place for children to access mental 
health services, but most schools do 
not 
meet 
recommended 
ratios 
for 
school psychologists, social workers, or 
counselors. Instead, even before the 
pandemic, we saw pediatricians, teach-
ers, school leaders, and more stepping 
in to try to provide mental health serv-
ices, despite many of them not feeling 
fully equipped to do so. The pandemic 
only exacerbated all of these issues and 
put further strain on a health system 
that was already not built to ade-
quately support youth mental health. 
As COVID surged, emergency room 
visits for young people having a mental 
health crisis increased dramatically. 
Since 2019, ER visits for suspected sui-
cide attempts rose 51 percent amongst 
girls ages 12 to 17. But high COVID hos-
pitalization rates and, later, the surge 
of new variants, combined with inad-
equate vaccination rates, mean that we 
had and continue to have a shortage of 
hospital beds and emergency rooms to 
service young people having a mental 
health crisis. 
In an op-ed by a constituent of mine, 
Jonathan Slater, a child and adoles-
cent psychiatrist, described children 
and teenagers at his hospital having to 
wait 3 to 4 days for an inpatient bed. 
The 
strain 
on 
hospital 
capacity 
caused by the ongoing pandemic means 
our ability to adequately treat all 
other physical and mental health is 
jeopardized. The more people get vac-
cinated and boosted, that means fewer 
people in the hospital, and it means the 
15-year-old who lost her parent to 
COVID and hasn’t experienced a nor-
mal school year since she was 12 can 
get access to the emergency mental 
health care that she needs. 
I want to express immense gratitude 
for the many people, teachers, school 
leaders, pediatricians, school bus driv-
ers, emergency room physicians, and 
staff who have stepped in to confront 
the youth mental health crisis head-on. 
But we cannot address youth mental 
health without addressing issues we 
face in our broader healthcare system 
and 
without 
addressing 
workforce 
issues in mental health professions. 
As we continue to face compounding 
public health and mental health crises 
among our young people, we have to 
recognize that cultivating a better Na-
tion, marked by healthy and happy 
young people who are equipped to en-
gage 
critically 
and 
collaboratively 
with their communities and our democ-
racy, requires us to continue on the 
path of rethinking schools and their 
purpose and potential. 
We need Federal investments and re-
sources in our schools that reflect 
these priorities, and that means put-
ting the mental health and well-being 
of our students front and center as we 
move forward. 
Madam Speaker, I yield such time as 
she may consume to the gentlewoman 
from Michigan (Ms. TLAIB), and I thank 
her very much for being here. 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the ever-amazing partner in good trou-
ble, Congressman BOWMAN, for hosting 
this Special Order hour on one of the 
most critical issues facing our Nation, 
youth mental health. 
As a mother of two young boys, I 
know that there are few people who see 
this mental health crisis amongst our 
children quite like our teachers and 
our educators. They are on the front 
lines of it every single day, and it is in 
no way an exaggeration to say Amer-
ica’s teachers are the ones saving lives 
in the face of a tidal wave of trauma 
and grief brought about by many crises 
impacting our young people today. 
From COVID–19 to schools turning 
into war zones, severe economic hard-
ship, and an education system that 
continues to be underfunded for a num-
ber of issues that, again, our kids are 
dealing with, we are seeing that trau-
ma is at the center of it. 
I know according to the National Al-
liance on Mental Illness, 57.8 percent of 
Michiganders from the age of 12 to 17 
who have experienced depression did 
not receive any care in the last year, 
and high school students with depres-
sion are more than two times more 
likely to drop out than their peers. 
These 
are 
just 
a 
few 
of 
the 
compounding traumas impacting our 
young people today. These traumas 
have stolen our children’s sense of safe-
ty and our children’s support systems. 
So, the fact that the rates of youth in 
mental 
health 
distress 
have 
sky-
rocketed should be a surprise to no 
one, especially not anyone in this body. 
We have failed to address gun vio-
lence. We have failed to protect basic 
human rights. We have failed to ensure 
that every child in the richest nation 
on Earth has access to the clean air, 
safe water, and healthy food that they 
need to grow and thrive. We have failed 
to truly address childhood poverty. 
Instead of investing in schools, com-
bating poverty, and taking action on 
reducing violence, this body continues 
to double down on failed approaches. 
I know I continue to be asked in my 
community: What good is another 100 
F–35s when our children go to sleep on 
empty stomachs? What is the point of 
spending more money on militarization 
of our communities than any other 
country spends on defense instead of 
making sure that our children have 
safe drinking water and that they are 
not exposed to lead and PFAS? 
While our children are crying out for 
help as loud as they can, over in the 
Senate, their elected leaders, many of 
whom have been bought and paid for by 
the fossil fuel lobby, are working hard 
to—you 
guessed 
it—sell 
out 
their 
chances at a livable future and improve 
the lives of many of our folks in the fu-
ture. 
This body, this Congress, isn’t just 
failing to address this youth mental 
health crisis. It is turbocharging it. 
I know in my community, we have 
the most polluted ZIP Code in the

State of Michigan, 48217, where we see 
high rates of asthma. When I go read to 
children in the third grade class during 
March Reading Month, I ask how many 
children there know what I do for a liv-
ing, and they don’t know, usually, and 
I have to give them a civics lesson. I 
tell them that I am trying to fight for 
clean air. I ask them: ‘‘How many of 
you have asthma or are suffering from 
asthma?’’ A third of the class always 
raises their hands. 
I ask them: ‘‘It hurts to have an asth-
ma attack, doesn’t it? It is hard to 
breathe. Isn’t it hard to breathe?’’ 
They shake their heads. 
Every day, we fail. We fail them by 
not taking action on climate for a liv-
able future. 
Please know this: Our children can-
not learn if they are hungry, but they 
also cannot learn if they are breathing 
dirty air, if they are being poisoned by 
lead-infested water, so we must take 
action. 
I know that we also have failed to 
enact real, meaningful gun control 
that our children can be proud of, that 
our teachers can feel is meaningful and 
that it actually does keep them safe. 
Every day that we have failed to 
enact bold reforms to resurrect and 
protect our democracy is a day closer 
to dooming our children to a fascist fu-
ture where their rights are stripped 
from them. 
This isn’t new for our communities, 
but I know for many of the young peo-
ple of color in my community, the 
LGBTQI youth, our immigrant youth, 
our religious minorities, these failures 
have been amplified by the horrifying 
pandemic of racism, bigotry, and hate 
that has exploded in our country. 
Make no mistake, the crisis of hate 
facing our country is 100 percent the 
result of continued political motiva-
tion that is literally a factor in push-
ing elected officials and social leaders 
in spewing out fear rather than trying 
to address the root causes of the issues 
that our children are facing. 
I know the only solution here is fun-
damental overhaul of what we govern. 
We must put our children before cor-
porations, people before profits, and 
community solidarity before hate and 
fear. 
Madam Speaker, I cannot thank my 
colleague enough for his incredible 
leadership. Sometimes it is our lived 
experiences that we bring into this 
Chamber that give us the passion and 
inspiration to work hard. I am so hon-
ored to be able to serve with somebody 
that not only was a principal but is 
also a father himself and understands 
and has been on the front line and seen 
the lack of action in this body for our 
youth mental health crisis in our coun-
try. 
Mr. BOWMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank RASHIDA for her voice. It is good 
to see her and be with her. 
Tonight, we have heard from Mem-
bers who represent communities across 
the country. The youth mental health 
crisis is a national crisis that requires 
an all-of-government response. Our 
children deserve nothing less. 
There were so many voices that con-
tributed to these remarks this evening 
from my district, New York-16. I recog-
nize them at this moment. 
Making the necessary investments in 
our youth mental health will take all 
of us at every level of government and 
in every community. 
I give a special shout-out to constitu-
ents of mine who shared their prior-
ities around youth mental health. Jon-
athan Lewis, a Scarsdale Village trust-
ee, shared how important it is to un-
derstand the relationship between a 
mental health crisis and learned out-
comes to our students, not just in an 
academic sense but also with respect to 
school climate and the importance of 
creating a learning environment that 
is safe from violence. 
Stephanie Marquesano from the har-
ris project in Ardsley highlighted how 
important it is that communities, 
youth, and all levels of government be 
in dialogue with each other about the 
intersection of mental health and sub-
stance use disorders, particularly as it 
relates to our youth. 
Ron Hartridge, educator and advo-
cate in the Bronx, expressed his deep 
concern regarding the impact that 
trauma and fear have on our children 
and how important it is to equip our 
schools to support students instead of 
prioritizing compliant behavior, which 
is so often used to justify and perpet-
uate the school-to-prison pipeline. 
Jonathan Alvarez from 914United in 
Yonkers called for meaningful juvenile 
justice reform in the Lower Hudson 
Valley. 
Darryl Taylor, a Tuckahoe Village 
trustee, wrote in about the toll of the 
COVID–19 pandemic, particularly on 
our youth who lost loved ones, parents, 
siblings, or friends, and the urgency we 
must have to reach out to our youth 
who may be feeling alone in their grief 
and hopelessness. 
Mary Graves, Mount Vernon’s Demo-
cratic chair, shared how important it is 
that we make mental health resources 
and support available to the whole 
community and consider how there 
isn’t a one-size-fits-all approach to 
mental health. 
Julie Cordin from my district shared 
how troubling it is to learn that suici-
dal ideation and attempted suicides 
amongst children increased during the 
pandemic and that this will not go 
away on its own. We have to work on 
this together. I am so grateful to all of 
my constituents who care so deeply 
about our youth, both locally and na-
tionally. 
The youth mental health crisis is a 
national crisis that requires an all-of- 
government response. Our children de-
serve nothing less. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

MORAL BREAKDOWN OF AMERICA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Wis-
consin (Mr. GROTHMAN) is recognized 
for 60 minutes as the designee of the 
minority leader. 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
would like to talk about several issues 
which have either not been covered 
enough lately or not covered in the ap-
propriate way. 
The first thing I would like to talk 
about is the loan forgiveness program 
and the recent change in the law in-
creasing public loan forgiveness. 
When my constituents back home 
ask me, what is the biggest problem? I 
say, well, we certainly have problems 
with the economy, we certainly have 
problems with education, we certainly 
have problems with crime—but I say 
the biggest problem is we are in a 
moral breakdown in this country. 
I would like to address the way the 
loan forgiveness program and public 
loan forgiveness is changing America, I 
think, for the worst. 
The first thing I would like to ad-
dress is the fact that this institution 
has apparently felt that you are a lot 
better off, or it should be much easier 
for you to have your loan forgiven if 
you work for a nonprofit organization 
or a governmental entity. 
Now, whenever I go around my dis-
trict, the manufacturers, the farmers, 
a couple of big insurance companies, 
they are all looking for more people to 
work. But the message out of Wash-
ington is, don’t work for business, 
which, after all, is the engine that real-
ly makes our country go around. It 
shows kind of a hatred for manufactur-
ers, a hatred for agriculture, a hatred 
of retail, a hatred of insurance. 
People working in this building who 
work with our government employees, 
their staff is government employees, 
apparently felt: Well, I think those 
hardworking people in government, 
they ought to be offered a tremendous 
benefit that people who don’t work for 
the government don’t get. We are going 
to find a way to forgive the people’s 
loans if they are the nice, noble people 
who work for government. And if they 
are somebody who, say, works for a 
manufacturer—which is so important 
for the country—well, we don’t care 
about those people. We hate those peo-
ple. 
The next message in our loan forgive-
ness policy is the dislike of people who 
don’t go to college. One of my goals in 
the legislature—which I think I am 
succeeding at a little bit—is educating 
people about all the good, necessary 
jobs we have in our country that don’t 
require a 4-year college degree. 
Recently, The Wall Street Journal 
pointed out—I am told—that if you are 
a plumber and compare your lifelong

trades. We so desperately need more 
people who are skilled in the manufac-
turing field. 
But what do we do here? 
We turn around and put them or 
their children in greater debt with this 
loan forgiveness program or it will 
likely drive up insurance more with 
the loan forgiveness program that is 
going to cost over $300 billion a year. 
We benefit the people who go to col-
lege. We treat the people who don’t go 
to college like dirt: No, you are not 
getting anything, inflation is going to 
go up and hurt you because we have to 
give money to the people who went to 
college. 
The next bad message that it sends 
is, I think it is discriminating against 
the hardworking. 
I ran into somebody recently, heard 
about somebody who got a nice job out 
of college, but with pride he said he 
was going to work extra hard and pay 
off that student loan. So he got a job as 
an Uber driver and he got a job as a 
bartender. I am sure between them 
both he was working well over 60, 65 
hours a week but he was proud to pre- 
pay that student loan. 
And what does the government say to 
somebody who works especially hard 
and pays off their student loan? 
Sucker. We are going to give the 
same benefit to someone who didn’t 
work that second or third job. 
Again, you are eating away at the 
moral fiber of America. 
The next group is the frugal. I always 
thought it was wise to be frugal, wise 
to be debt-free, pay off that debt before 
you take out your credit card and buy 
a fancier car or buy more furniture or 
buy a fancy vacation or something. But 
we look at the people who are frugal 
and use their frugality to pay off their 
student loan. Again, we say: Sucker, 
you shouldn’t have paid off your stu-
dent loan. The government will pay off 
the student loan for somebody who 
wasn’t as frugal, and we consider you 
kind of foolish for being frugal. 
And the final thing I would point out 
is that under the proposed forgiveness 
by President Biden, we give out twice 
the forgiveness if you originally took 
out Pell grants. 
Now, one of the problems I have 
talked about with the Pell grants in 
the past is that it is easier to get a Pell 
grant if you are not married, which 
probably isn’t a good thing, but that is 
the way it is. 
Now, you already get the benefit of 
the Pell Grant for not being married in 
the first place. Now we double the 
amount of loan forgiveness if you wind 
up originally getting this additional 
boost with the Pell grant. 
So, again, it is sending the wrong 
message to people. In addition to the 
fact that it is another $360 billion log 
on the fire of inflation. And then peo-
ple will pretend they don’t know where 
inflation came from. But when the 
Treasury is spending 360 billion bucks, 
that is where the inflation came from. 
The next thing I am going to address 
is what is going on at the border. And 
as I mentioned before, this is another 
topic that the press underreports. 
Earlier this week, one more time, we 
had the information come out on the 
number of people who came across the 
border in August. It varies from month 
to month, between 140,000 and 180,000 
people crossing the border. But that is 
just totally inappropriate. It makes a 
mockery of our immigration laws to 
people who are doing it right. 
We know that some of these people, 
after all, had to break the law to come 
here, and are going to be disproportion-
ately in a situation in which they have 
to take advantage of the public bene-
fits of this country. And we don’t know 
whether they have been adequately 
blended 
into 
America, 
think 
like 
Americans, think with the self-reliance 
that Americans should have. I don’t 
think any serious country believes in 
open borders, except for we do here. 
In addition to the obvious problem of 
the adults coming here, we have—de-
pending on the month—about 10,000 un-
accompanied minors coming here to be 
dropped off, presumably at relatives, 
somebody or other. I don’t know where 
the press is that always worries about 
broken families, when our open borders 
results in 9,000 or 10,000 people, who at 
least claim to be minors, without a 
parent around. 
The next problem, a humanitarian 
problem, when you have such a huge 
number of people crossing the border, 
people die coming over the border. The 
last time I was down on the border, 
they found two bodies of people around 
San Diego and the Pacific Ocean. We 
were told it was more common to find 
bodies on the Mexican side of the bor-
der. We hear about people dehydrating 
to death in the Arizona desert. We hear 
about people drowning in the Rio 
Grande. 
Nevertheless, these things are not 
talked about. They are an inevitable 
consequence of sending a message to 
people all around the globe that we 
don’t care what happens at the border. 
Another problem is, depending on the 
person, they frequently are charged 
$5,000, $10,000, $20,000 to come here. Who 
is benefiting by this? 
The Border Patrol believes that the 
drug cartels are right now making 
more money smuggling people across 
the border than they do selling drugs. 
So what is the effect of the drug car-
tels making more money? It gives 
them even more of a stranglehold on 
our southern neighbor, Mexico, which 
is quickly becoming more and more of 
a narco State. 
I think part of that is our fault in 
America for having too many people 
consume drugs that are snuck in across 
the southern border. But some of the 
fault also has to lie in this open-door 
policy pursued by the Biden adminis-
tration as the Mexican drug cartels get 
wealthier and wealthier and wealthier. 
Another thing to point out is we are 
not inappropriate otherwise as far as 
letting people in this country. Depend-
ing on the year, we have over 800,000 
new people sworn in as American citi-
zens. That is certainly very generous, 
particularly when compared to other 
countries. Meanwhile, we have a situa-
tion in which we are encouraging peo-
ple to come here right now. 
Madam Speaker, 65 percent of the 
bursts of illegal immigrants are people 
on Medicaid, which would indicate that 
it is still a greater burden on our budg-
et to have more people come here. 
The American Medical Association 
points out the huge number of illegals 
who show up in emergency rooms. Of 
course, as a practical matter, they are 
in charge of this if something passes 
through to the other people who are 
paying for their medical care. But, 
again, we have to say one of the rea-
sons for the spiraling costs of medical 
care in this country is people who show 
up in the emergency rooms and don’t 
pay. That would be illegals. 
I recently talked to someone who op-
erates a free clinic in my district. And 
they told me that a significant number 
of the people that they deal with at the 
free clinic are people here illegally. 
This could become even greater if 
eventually President Biden gets his 
dream—it could very easily happen if 
the elections go away. I don’t want to 
have them go away—in which we give 
Pell grants to people who come here il-
legally which results in close to a free 
college education that the American 
middle class doesn’t get. But appar-
ently an inducement to have more peo-
ple come here is we are going to give 
Pell grants to people who come here il-
legally. 
I hope that the American press corps 
pays more attention to the numbers in-
troduced earlier this week, as far as 
the number of people who came here il-
legally in August. It should be a banner 
headline. It will be a permanent change 
in America when over 150,000 people 
come here. 
And I should point out that as more 
people come here, it doesn’t mean we 
are kicking out more people who break 
our laws. At the same time, we are de-
porting only about a quarter of the 
number of people who President Trump 
was deporting for breaking the law. So 
we are, in essence, allowing more peo-
ple who are criminally prone to come 
into this country. 
The next issue I want to talk about 
that the press should be paying atten-
tion to: I recently talked to someone 
who claims that in the military, where 
they had required vaccines, we have re-
cently heard of increases in mis-
carriages, cancer, blood clots, neuro-
logical complications, and deaths. 
I would hope the press would dig into 
this, make some freedom of informa-
tion requests. If it really is true, as my 
friend tells me, that there is an in-
crease in medical problems at the same 
time that our military was required to 
get the vaccine, it is something we 
should know not only for the benefit of 
the military but the rest of America as 
well. 
I haven’t seen this being adequately 
covered given the huge amount of

money we are putting in these vac-
cines, as well as the fact that we are 
encouraging children to get these vac-
cines. I would hope that a lot of atten-
tion is being paid to the effect of vac-
cines on the primarily young military 
population, and a population that is 
generally in shape. 
The next thing that not only the 
press should be paying attention to 
but, quite frankly, the business lobby-
ists should be paying attention to is 
something called the PRO Act. 
The PRO Act passed the House of 
Representatives two terms in a row. It 
is being held up in the Senate right 
now only because of the filibuster rule. 
Depending upon what happens in the 
elections in November, one could easily 
see the PRO Act become law. 
b 1800 
The American public does not know 
what is in the PRO Act. Lobbyists in 
this building, who should know better, 
don’t know about the PRO Act. We are 
very close to changing the labor laws 
in this country where you can wind up 
having an election to unionize with 
only 14 days’ advance notice. These 
elections would take place with an 
open ballot. You fill out your ballot, 
and people can know how you vote. If 
it is perceived that the management 
team did something untoward during 
the election, the labor relations board 
can deem there to be a union, even 
though nobody even voted to be union-
ized. 
It can create a situation in which dif-
ferent franchisees can be lumped to-
gether, and even though no employees 
in one location want to unionize, they 
can be forced into a union. 
It would be a fundamental change in 
the way we do business in this country. 
I have nothing against people who be-
long to a union, but this would over-
whelmingly shift the bias toward forc-
ing people to join a union when they 
don’t necessarily want to. It is some-
thing our business groups, whatever as-
sociation 
it 
is, 
should 
familiarize 
themselves with and make sure their 
members know what could very easily 
happen. 
I also think the PRO Act has been 
very 
underpublicized 
by 
our 
press 
corps. If it turns out in January that 
we begin down a process of mass union-
ization and we go down a path in which 
all employees’ numbers have to be 
turned over—their address, their email 
address, their phone number—without 
their say so, the American public 
ought to know what they are voting for 
in November. 
I don’t believe the press corps in this 
country has adequately explained to 
both management, employees, every-
body, how close we are to that PRO Act 
becoming law. Everybody ought to 
know it. I think it would be dev-
astating for American business, par-
ticularly American business that has 
to compete abroad, if the PRO Act 
were to pass. But if it passes, I bet very 
few people will understand what effect 
this election has on it. 
There is another significant bill that 
is being held back only because of the 
filibuster rule in the Senate. Even 
though this bill passed this session, the 
average American does not know how 
close we are to this becoming law. I 
speak about the LGBTQI+ Data Inclu-
sion Act. 
In this act, both for the purpose of 
censuses and other government forms, 
American citizens and American chil-
dren will be asked to declare a sexual 
preference or sexual identity, be it bi-
sexual, be it binary, be it transgender, 
what-have-you. I think this is highly 
offensive. There was a time when the 
gay rights movement meant we weren’t 
supposed to ask what people do in bed. 
Now, it is going to be the government’s 
business, and you are going to be asked 
to declare your sexual preference, 
which by itself is outlandish. 
But just as outlandish is this declar-
ing goes all the way down to kids who 
are 7 or 6 or 5 years old. Now, there the 
form may be filled out by parents or by 
a teacher. It includes forms other than 
just the census, forms that school dis-
tricts are required to fill out. 
Nevertheless, I think it is a funda-
mental change in America that we are 
going to be collecting data on sexual 
preferences from any age group. Out-
landish for age 5; outlandish for age 12. 
But this, to me, is a fundamental 
change in the way America operates, 
and the information that people are 
supposed to turn over to the govern-
ment is a fundamental change. 
I would be surprised if one out of 300 
Americans knew we are so close to 
making that requirement in the United 
States. I hope that our slumbering 
press corps—I don’t mean to refer to 
them that way—but I hope that the av-
erage American knows how close we 
are to that bill becoming law. 
The next issue that I think we ought 
to look at a little bit concerns the con-
tinued effort to claim we have a huge 
racism problem in this country. I do 
not believe we have a racism problem 
in the country. The easiest way to see 
that is when you look and see how well 
the immigrants who just come here are 
able to do, despite the fact that many 
of the immigrants who come here don’t 
even know English. 
I have recently spoken to people from 
the Hmong community, from the In-
dian community, and from the Filipino 
community, and all of them are so 
happy to be in America and think 
America is the land of opportunity, 
that people do so well in America. 
I talked to a Hmong individual re-
cently, and he had between himself, his 
children, and his siblings’ children, 
about 30 children or nieces or nephews. 
Every one of them is thriving in Amer-
ica. Nobody has broken any laws. They 
all have decent jobs. They are educated 
in one fashion or another. These are 
people who came here from an entirely 
different culture. Many were not Chris-
tian. Their parents or grandparents did 
not know English when they came 
here, but they thrive in America. 
I have been talking to some Indian 
immigrants, and they say how wonder-
ful the opportunity is here. Again, I 
talked to somebody recently who came 
here, didn’t know any English. He had 
to start out as a dishwasher. He worked 
his way up and is doing fantastically 
well in America. The fact that he is of 
Indian heritage had no effect on him 
whatsoever, and he couldn’t think of 
any way in which he had been discrimi-
nated against. Same thing is true with 
somebody from the Philippines. 
But what do we get here out of Wash-
ington? We get Joe Biden talking about 
we have to pass a bill—I will talk about 
in a second—we have to make it easier 
to sue police, in part, because we per-
ceive the police are prejudiced. 
We continue to promote the Black 
Lives Matter movement, which is built 
on the lie that we have a huge problem 
with racist police in this country. But 
nevertheless, we coddle them, people 
give them money, and they are treated 
with respect. 
In our election law, we are told we 
have to get rid of photo ID, something 
that many other countries have, be-
cause it is racist to require photo ID. 
That is some horrible slander that Joe 
Biden has against the people of this 
country. 
I would ask that the press begin to 
treat these claims of racism a little 
more skeptically. I think they should 
ask people details when they claim rac-
ism is a big problem, because it is not 
without harm. I think it causes people 
to walk around with a chip on their 
shoulder. I think that it causes unnec-
essary divisions in Americans. I think 
America has been a melting pot my 
whole life and well before I was born. 
People come here from all around the 
globe. I should point out that insofar 
as there are ethnic problems, they are 
frequently greater in other countries. 
That is one thing that people from 
India pointed out to me, that there are 
problems between different religious 
groups or ethnic groups in India in 
which people even get killed. There is 
nothing like that in the United States. 
It is time the politicians of this 
building, rather than trying to take po-
litical advantage of the grievances that 
they try to bring up, they should tell 
people that anybody who works hard in 
America has an opportunity to succeed 
and that that is something they can be 
proud of about of America. They can 
just use their common sense. 
If you are down at the border, the 
people who come here, come here from 
all around the globe, because they 
know that despite the fact they might 
not know the native language, despite 
the fact that they don’t have a job 
lined up when they get here—whether 
you are coming here from Peru or Cuba 
or Ecuador or Bangladesh, Uzbekistan, 
anywhere—you are going to be better 
off in the United States. Not Christian, 
not northern European, not European 
at all, you are still going to be better 
off in the United States. 
So many immigrants have told me 
there is unlimited opportunity in the

United States. That is why they are 
here. One of the major reasons, I think, 
why some people don’t succeed in tak-
ing advantage of that opportunity is 
because they are told by opportunistic 
politicians that America is a racist 
country and you cannot succeed in 
America. 
The final comment that I think the 
press should be picking up going into 
the election cycle is a law that right 
now has passed the House twice but has 
only not passed the Senate because of 
the filibuster rule, which could change 
with a shift in just two votes in the 
U.S. Senate, is the law making it easi-
er to sue police. 
There are a variety of reasons why 
crime has gone up so dramatically in 
this country in the last 2 years, and 
there is no question that part of it is 
we are not adequately funding our po-
lice departments. But even more than 
that, we are not speaking positively 
about police. Now, we have a bill out 
there making it easier to sue police if 
they handcuff somebody or if they 
wrestle with somebody. 
This rhetoric from politicians and 
also this proposed law causes police, I 
think, to be very reluctant to phys-
ically engage somebody, very reluctant 
to be aggressive. As a result, we have 
in Milwaukee, the city of my birth, and 
many other urban cities, including 
Washington and Baltimore, right up 
the freeway, dramatic increases in the 
number of homicides. It didn’t just 
happen. It happened, in part, because of 
rhetoric from politicians tearing down 
police, encouraging lack of respect for 
the law. 
The final highlight of this drive to 
dislike police could easily happen in 
January when we get rid of the limited 
immunity that police currently have if 
they have to engage someone. It would 
dramatically change policing, make it 
more difficult to find police, and make 
it easier to sue police. 
I hope our press corps pays special 
attention to these laws, which did not 
pass out of this Congress, but passed 
only out of the House. But if there is a 
slight shift in the partisan makeup in 
January, they could easily become law. 
The American citizens ought to know 
about these laws before they go to vote 
in November. I am afraid they are not 
going to know it, because they are not 
adequately covered by our slumbering 
journalists. 
I ask one more time that they pay 
attention to laws related to racism; 
laws related to suing police; laws re-
lated to the LGBTQI+ Data Inclusion 
Act, in which they go around and try 
to collect data on sexual preferences 
from all Americans; and the PRO Act, 
in which we, I think, just shamefully 
tip the balance of the scales toward 
forcing people to become members of a 
union. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
REFLECTIONS OF MY TIME IN 
CONGRESS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman from Florida (Mr. DEUTCH) 
for 30 minutes. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, I ar-
rived in this storied Chamber 12-and-a- 
half years ago fresh off a Florida spe-
cial election to fill former Representa-
tive Robert Wexler’s seat. I was the 
lone freshman in the middle of the 
111th Congress. I was eager. I was a lit-
tle uncertain. I had a bit more hair. I 
wanted to do right by the people who 
sent me here. 
It was during those first days that I 
met the late John Dingell, then the 
dean of the House, himself by all ac-
counts a very important man. I don’t 
know about you, Madam Speaker, but 
at that point, having secured the will 
of the American people to serve as 
their Representative in the House of 
Representatives, and having received 
my spiffy new congressional pin, I 
might have been feeling a little impor-
tant myself, even with the novelty of 
my new job. 
b 1815 
But John Dingell looked me square 
in the eye and gave me a piece of ad-
vice that I would never forget. He said: 
You are not important. It is what you 
can do for the people who sent you 
here, that is what is important. If you 
never confuse those two, he said, you 
will be fine. 
Over the course of my time in Con-
gress, as Mr. Dingell predicted, I have 
met some very important people, but 
those people, with all due respect to 
my colleagues, don’t serve in this 
Chamber. 
I met Mitch Libman, the childhood 
friend of Private First Class Leonard 
Kravitz, Company M, Fifth Infantry 
Regiment, 24th Infantry Division. For 
decades, Mitch worked to find out why 
Private First Class Kravitz, who sac-
rificed himself for his platoon during 
the Korean war in an extraordinary act 
of heroism, never received the Medal of 
Honor he was recommended for. 
Mitch’s efforts led to a 2002 congres-
sional review to uncover soldiers of 
Jewish and Hispanic origin who were 
wrongfully denied the Medal of Honor 
due to prejudice. His tireless devotion 
to his late friend led me to introduce 
an amended version of the National De-
fense Authorization Act in the 113th 
Congress to ensure each and every sol-
dier discovered during that review to 
deserve the Medal of Honor received 
their award. 
I was proud to stand before President 
Obama surrounded by the families of 
these bravest Americans when the 
President awarded 24 recipients, in-
cluding Private First Class Kravitz 
posthumously, 
with 
that 
deserved 
honor. 
Mitch Libman and Private First 
Class Kravitz, and what we were able 
to do for them, that was important. 
I met Mona Reis, the founder of the 
Presidential Women’s Center. Outraged 
by the prevalence of unsafe, back-alley 
abortions, by the injustice of women 
having to travel across borders to ac-
cess basic reproductive healthcare that 
is their right, Mona lobbied for legal-
ized abortion here in Washington. 
The day after Roe v. Wade was de-
cided, she joined the first outpatient 
abortion clinic in Miami as a staff 
counselor, helping women in Florida fi-
nally access the care they needed. 
When she moved north to my district, 
she founded the Presidential Women’s 
Center in Palm Beach County, a lead-
ing comprehensive reproductive care 
facility. 
It is because of her dedication to 
women’s basic human rights in south 
Florida, and her shining example nur-
turing patients through the most dif-
ficult decision of their lives, that I 
fought hard against efforts to attack 
women’s bodily autonomy, first in Tal-
lahassee and then in Washington. 
It is why I became a task force chair 
of the Pro-Choice Caucus. Together 
with my colleagues, we passed the 
Women’s Health Protection Act in the 
House to codify Roe into law and 
pushed for the repeal of the global gag 
rule. That was important, and espe-
cially in this moment, it continues to 
be important. 
I met Robert Boo and Bruce Wil-
liams, CEO and active aging manager 
of the Pride Center at Equality Park in 
Wilton Manors, Florida. Every day, 
they work with their team to create a 
welcoming, empowering home with a 
wealth of resources for south Florida’s 
LGBTQ+ community and particularly 
LGBTQ+ seniors. From art galleries to 
health workshops to education to coun-
seling, Robert and Bruce ensure that 
the community’s needs are met. 
But the challenges that they face are 
tremendous. LGBTQ+ seniors have en-
dured a lifetime of marginalization and 
discrimination, and their needs are 
many and unique. 
Their work led me to Ruthie Berman, 
a lifelong advocate who fought along-
side her wife, Connie, for the LGBTQ+ 
community. Even though Connie is no 
longer with us, Ruthie’s activism has 
not let up. She is still briefing congres-
sional staff and sharing her wisdom. 
Ruthie and Connie, Bruce and Rob-
ert, all of their tireless efforts prompt-
ed me to introduce the Ruthie and 
Connie LGBT Elder Americans Act 
every Congress and to chair the Equal-
ity Caucus’ Task Force on Aging. Be-
cause of them, Congress better under-
stands the needs of this community 
and has the tools to take action. That 
is important. 
I met David Hogg, Matt and Ryan 
Deitsch, Cameron Kasky, and X Gon-
zalez. I met Jackie Corin, Alex Wind, 
and dozens of their classmates. When 17 
of their friends and teachers at Mar-
jory Stoneman Douglas were murdered 
by a killer with access to an assault 
weapon, 
as 
our 
community 
was 
wracked with shock and grief, these

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H8056 
September 21, 2022 
young people refused to sit by and wait 
for the next school shooting. They got 
together. 
They 
started 
a 
national 
movement. 
They started March For Our Lives to 
prevent the next tragedy. Because of 
them, roughly half a million people 
showed up in Washington and 2 million 
in cities around the country and 
around the world to demand change, 
one of the largest protests in American 
history. Because of them, we had the 
highest ever youth turnout in the 2018 
midterms, and we elected a gun safety 
majority to Congress, a majority that 
includes dedicated advocates like my 
dear friend LUCY MCBATH. 
I 
met 
Lori 
Alhadeff, 
Fred 
Guttenberg, 
Manny 
Oliver, 
Tony 
Montalto, and dozens of other family 
members who had their loved ones 
taken from them too soon and who are 
still pushing through their anguish to 
try to make our community and our 
country safer. 
Because of them, I introduced legis-
lation to crack down on 3D-printed 
guns, raise the legal age for purchase, 
ban high-capacity magazines, and es-
tablish a Federal buyback program. 
Because of them, a universal back-
ground checks bill and an assault 
weapons ban have passed in the House, 
and because of them, the first major 
gun safety law in 30 years is now law. 
That was important. 
Because of them, I remember those 
they 
lost 
every 
day. 
I 
remember 
Alyssa, Scott, Martin, Nicholas, Aaron, 
Jaime, Chris, Luke, Cara, Gina, Joa-
quin, Alaina, Meadow, Helena, Alex, 
Carmen, and Peter. That is important. 
I met Christine Levinson and her 
children, Sarah, Doug, Stephanie, Dan, 
Susan, David, and Samantha, whose 
husband and father, Bob Levinson, was 
being held hostage in Iran. 
When I got to Washington, the 
Levinsons had already been searching 
for answers for 3 years. Bob became the 
longest held American hostage in his-
tory, as his family navigated a con-
fusing and disjointed landscape of re-
sources and information across mul-
tiple Presidential administrations. 
But the Levinsons did not give up. 
Even after we learned of Bob’s likely 
death in captivity, the Levinsons never 
stopped trying to give other families 
facing the same terrible circumstance 
that they faced more resources than 
they had. 
They didn’t stop trying to bring Bob 
and every American hostage home, and 
because of them, President Obama 
issued an executive order to better 
track unlawful detainment of U.S. na-
tionals abroad and support the families 
of those detainees, an executive order 
that was codified into law by my bill, 
the Robert Levinson Hostage Recovery 
and 
Hostage-Taking 
Accountability 
Act, soon after we learned of Bob’s 
passing. 
There are still hostages around the 
world today. Bob is still not home, but 
the strides we made for these families, 
that was important. Those of us in this 
Chamber and all Americans continuing 
to fight to bring them home and to 
bring closure to the Levinsons, that is 
important. 
Of course, I met people before I came 
to Washington, people who informed 
my work in Tallahassee. Their stories 
have continued to be important. They 
have continued to inspire the actions 
that we have taken in this Chamber. 
On a plane in Florida, soon after my 
election to the State senate, I met 
Berthy De La Rosa-Aponte. She told 
me her story and the story of her 
daughter, Lucy, who was living with 
cerebral palsy, autism, and multiple 
other developmental and intellectual 
disabilities. 
Berthy told me about a harmful 
change in language on its way through 
the State legislature, a change that 
could have had disastrous consequences 
for the health and quality of life for 
her daughter and many others with se-
vere disabilities. She told me: If this 
goes through, I will have two choices. I 
could put Lucy into an institution or 
she will die. 
Because of her, I introduced legisla-
tion to fix it. We got that language 
changed. The American flag Lucy 
painted still hangs in my office in 
Washington. While Lucy passed away 2 
years ago, the change she inspired, 
that lives on, and that was important. 
The people I met during my career in 
public 
service 
informed 
important 
work, work that we do with a lasting 
legacy, but so did the people that I 
came here with. The day I was sworn in 
as a Member of Congress, since it was 
following a special election, there was 
no limit on the number of tickets in 
the House gallery for my friends and 
family. 
I was elected on April 13, 2010, and 
sworn in 2 days later, which is not a 
whole lot of time for people to plan to 
come, but they dropped everything to 
come even on short notice, and we 
packed the place. So many dear friends 
and family were with me that day, fill-
ing up this gallery. 
It is hard to single any of them out. 
There were people who cared about 
every issue under the Sun, with so 
many different visions for what the fu-
ture of our country could be. But many 
of the faces in the gallery that day who 
decided it was worth coming for that 
moment, many of them were people 
that I had gotten to know in my 25 
years living in Boca Raton through our 
shared involvement in our local Jewish 
community. They are people who share 
my strong commitment to bettering 
not only the American Jewish commu-
nity, not only the global Jewish com-
munity, but our Nation and our world 
through our community’s advocacy 
and service. 
I have seen their faces every day of 
this journey, as I fought anti-Semitism 
as 
cofounder 
of 
the 
Bipartisan 
Taskforce for Combating Anti-Semi-
tism; bolstered our Nation’s relation-
ships in the international community 
as a member of the Foreign Affairs 
Committee and the Middle East, North 
Africa, and Global Counterterrorism 
Subcommittee chair; strengthened the 
U.S.-Israel 
relationship 
as 
a 
loud, 
proud, and consistent advocate for Con-
gress’ bipartisan commitment to the 
U.S.-Israel strategic partnership, to 
Iron Dome funding, to bilateral co-
operation between our two nations, and 
for calling out anti-Semitism wherever 
it appears on whichever side of the po-
litical aisle; and advocated for Holo-
caust survivors to ensure they can live 
out their remaining years in peace and 
dignity. 
Guess what, Madam Speaker? A lot 
of them are back here in the gallery to-
night for the end of this ride. 
I lost my dad, Bernie Deutch, years 
ago. He couldn’t be there to watch my 
swearing-in, but it was the conversa-
tions that I had with him years ago 
ringing in my ears that day. 
When my dad served in the Battle of 
the Bulge and went to Europe to defend 
America and to fight the Nazis, it was 
the opportunity to do the work on the 
House floor that he was fighting for, 
that brave Americans in uniform are 
fighting for as I speak. 
Why did he do it? Why did he remind 
me of those stories? Because my dad 
taught me, taught all of us, my broth-
ers, Jeff, Stan, and Eddy, and my sis-
ter, Elaine, of the dual importance, the 
equal importance, the tremendous im-
portance of being both a proud Jew and 
a proud American. One informs the 
other. They are inextricably linked. 
My colleagues and constituents know 
me as a proud Jewish member of the 
American Congress. My involvement in 
the community, my travel to Israel, 
those have been such a fundamental 
part of what I have done since I have 
been here. They are cornerstones of the 
legacy that those faces in the gallery 
that day and my dad helped me leave, 
and that is grounding, it is humbling, 
and that is important. 
There are eight people who were 
there with me that day when I was 
sworn in 121⁄2 years ago that I want to 
single out even all these years later. 
All of us in this place are doing this for 
the world we are helping to create for 
our children and for their children, for 
all the generations to come. 
My kids were 15 and 12 when I got 
elected. Watching Gabby, Serena, and 
Cole grow, go through college, take on 
their own leadership positions on cam-
pus, in the Jewish community, and in 
the workforce, watching them do their 
part to help change the world, that has 
inspired me to do my part all these 
years. 
My wife, Jill, a leader in our local 
Jewish community with boundless pas-
sion for cultivating the next genera-
tion of Jewish leaders, all the work she 
does every day has been a source of 
strength and inspiration for me every 
time I come to Washington. 
The support from Jill, Gabby, and 
Serena, who are in the gallery with us 
today, and from Cole, who is watching 
in Austin, that is what brought me joy

when we celebrated success, and it is 
what sustained me during the chal-
lenging times. 
b 1830 
Jill’s mother, Sarah Gale, is watch-
ing today—I hope—and her father, 
Frank, who we recently lost, both of 
whom supported me every step of the 
way. My nephew, Eli, was there that 
day. He can’t be here today because he 
left us when he accidentally ingested 
fentanyl laced into a legal supplement, 
and we all fight to honor his memory 
by bringing attention to this epidemic 
every day. And my mom, who stood in 
the corner of this Chamber, giving the 
royal wave to all of my new colleagues, 
undoubtedly the woman of the hour, 
even though she was not the one being 
sworn into the United States Congress. 
During my swearing-in speech, I 
turned to her, and I finished by saying, 
‘‘In all her 86 years, my mother, Jean 
Deutch, never could have imagined 
hearing her name in this Chamber.’’ 
‘‘Mom,’’ I said, ‘‘thank you for making 
me believe that I could be anything I 
wanted to be because today,’’ I said, 
121⁄2 years ago, ‘‘I am a Member of the 
U.S. Congress.’’ While I miss sharing 
the ups and downs of Congress with 
her, I hope that as my mom looks down 
on us today, she believes that the serv-
ice in this Chamber lived up to the 
dream she had that day. 
This job is not easy. We all know 
there is plenty of progress yet to be 
made, that seemingly more often than 
we find areas of common ground, we 
get caught up in bitter, often vitriolic 
partisanship. We fight, we demonize, 
we create barriers to some of the 
change our constituents rightfully de-
mand. Sometimes we field violent 
threats from the very people we are 
here in Washington to try to help. 
I was here that day in January 2021. 
We have no shortage of dark days in 
this Chamber, some very dark ones like 
that one. The battles here feel impor-
tant and often all-consuming. The trail 
of stymied progress is infuriating. 
What this body of government is able 
to do for our constituency, as increas-
ingly rare as it may feel, that is impor-
tant. It is more important than me. It 
is more important than my successor. 
It is more important than any of us. I 
have been here long enough to see that 
it is worth fighting for. 
I have also been here long enough to 
have so many people fighting for me, 
and I want to thank my colleagues, so 
many of whom have become close 
friends. There are too many to men-
tion, but there are a handful who have 
gone out of their way to fight for me 
and with me, who have been so sup-
portive of my efforts to obtain leader-
ship 
positions 
under 
their 
watch. 
Speaker PELOSI, Leader HOYER, Chair-
man MEEKS, Chairman NADLER, Chair-
man JEFFRIES, my dear friends and 
neighbors, DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ 
and LOIS FRANKEL, and the late Alcee 
Hastings: Thank you. 
Thank you to the back row hecklers: 
Scott and Ami, Pete and Derek, Steph-
anie and Dan and Kathleen. To Josh 
and Elaine, Debbie and Dean, Brad and 
Kathy: Thank you for always being 
there for all of us. 
The Republican colleagues who I 
served and fought with who helped me 
bridge the partisan gap: Ranking Mem-
ber WILSON, my fantastic partner on 
the Middle East, North Africa and 
Global 
Counterterrorism 
Sub-
committee; 
Representative 
CHRIS 
SMITH, my partner and co-chair on the 
Anti-Semitism Task Force; Represent-
ative GUS BILIRAKIS, also from Florida, 
with whom I launched the Congres-
sional Hellenic Israel Alliance Caucus; 
and FRENCH HILL, who worked with me 
to 
launch 
the 
Congressional 
Task 
Force on American Hostages. I thank 
them. 
I thank my Republican colleagues 
from the Florida delegation, like Rep-
resentative MARIO DIAZ-BALART, who 
has so often fought with me, and Rep-
resentative WASSERMAN
SCHULTZ
to 
champion human rights from Caracas 
to Havana to Tehran. So many former 
colleagues who were so instrumental 
during their time here, especially those 
who were my foreign policy mentors: 
Howard Berman, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, 
Eliot Engel, and Nita Lowey. 
The Members who served with me on 
the Ethics Committee, some of the 
most honorable public servants I have 
had the privilege to meet: Representa-
tives SUSAN
WILD, DEAN
PHILLIPS, 
VERONICA
ESCOBAR, 
and 
MONDAIRE 
JONES; 
Representatives 
MICHAEL 
GUEST, DAVE JOYCE, JOHN RUTHERFORD, 
KELLY ARMSTRONG; my late colleague, 
Jackie Walorski and former Represent-
atives Kenny Marchant, Susan Brooks, 
and Charlie Dent. Thank you to DAVID 
CICILLINE
and JENNIFFER
GONZA´ LEZ- 
COLO´ N and all the Members I have been 
privileged to travel the world with rep-
resenting the United States. 
Thank you to the U.S. servicemem-
bers and employees of the State De-
partment, USAID, and other embassy 
employees from Tashkent to Buenos 
Aires to Jerusalem, who serve our Na-
tion, each in their own way and each 
magnificently. 
I have seen a lot of change in Con-
gress over the last dozen years. Over 7 
years and nearly four Congresses have 
passed since John Dingell last stood on 
this floor. I wonder if he would be sur-
prised by the bitter divides that have 
expanded 
exponentially 
since 
that 
time. Even now, his words are worth 
repeating. They are as true now as they 
were then and will continue to be for 
every Member who comes after me. 
‘‘You’re not important; it’s what you 
can do for the people who sent you here 
that’s important.’’ 
I think we can all agree it is the peo-
ple who help us do that work, our dedi-
cated staffs, that are important, too. 
So this one is for Team Ted. Thanks to 
my D.C. staff: Josh Rogin, Case Kustin, 
Aviva Abusch, Sophie Mirviss, Jack 
Steinberg, 
Tiffany 
Mendoza-Farfan, 
Fabiana 
Corsi-Mendez, 
and 
Alex 
Rogoff. 
My 
ethics 
counsel, 
David 
Arrojo and Tom Rust, and the non-
partisan ethics staff. My district staff: 
Wendi Lipsich, Jayne Chapman, The-
resa Brier, Alex Rocha, Jen Raducci, 
James DeJesus, Eric Johnson, Brandy 
Edelson, and Lewis Goldberg. And the 
longtime members of Team Ted who 
have moved on to other roles, but 
whose contributions to this work over 
the years are unmatched: Josh Lipman, 
Joel Richard, Jason Attermann, Ellen 
McLaren, 
Ashley 
Mushnick, 
Darcy 
Farnan, Jill Benson, and Daniel Fon-
tana, and so many others. Thank you 
does not suffice. No words suffice. You, 
your work, your service has been so 
important to so many. 
To the staff who keep this whole 
Chamber running, the floor staff here, 
the Cloakroom staff right next door, 
committee staff across the Capitol 
complex, thank you. To the Capitol Po-
lice, who protect us every day but who 
deserve such enormous gratitude since 
the events of January 6 especially, 
thank you. 
To the entire team of experts and 
management over at CRS and Library 
and Congress, who are so critical to the 
legislative process, I thank you. To ev-
eryone on the facilities and food serv-
ice teams, the Architect of the Capitol 
staff, everyone who keeps us fed, keeps 
our offices clean, makes sure that we 
get our mail, our flags, and everything 
else you do every day, thank you. To 
all who I do not have time to mention, 
thank you for your service to this body 
and to our country. 
As I prepare to leave this place for 
the last time, as I transition from this 
Chamber to my next chapter, I will 
keep John Dingell’s words in mind; I 
hope you will, too. Those of us that 
serve here can do important things for 
the American people. The work that 
lies ahead for Congress on behalf of the 
American people, that is important for 
this Chamber, for our country, and for 
our democracy. 
I am not important, but I believe the 
people in my community in South 
Florida, the family who stood by me, 
the staff who served with me, my col-
leagues who fought alongside me have 
helped me contribute something impor-
tant to our Nation on behalf of the peo-
ple who sent me here. 
To my colleagues, the friends who 
have served with me, inspired me, and 
collaborated with me in this Chamber 
on both sides of the aisle, those whom 
I have mentioned and all those who I 
cannot, even on the darkest days, it 
has been the honor of my life to know 
you, to work with you, to leave some-
thing important behind for our con-
stituents. You may not be important 
either, according to John Dingell, but 
you are still important to me. I am 
heartened by how many good and 
thoughtful people will still be serving 
here when I leave. 
After next week I will be your con-
stituent. I hope you keep pushing to 
bridge the divides, keep pushing to do 
important work for all of us, and I have

faith that if you keep doing that, de-
spite sometimes extraordinary odds, we 
will be just fine. 
I thank you, Madam Speaker, and for 
the last time, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
f 
CRISIS AT THE SOUTHERN 
BORDER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. ROY) for 30 
minutes. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Florida for his 
service to this country. We should all 
be down here engaging with our col-
leagues more often to learn more about 
them. I did not know that about your 
father. God bless you. Godspeed. Thank 
you for serving in this Chamber. 
Madam Speaker, much has been 
made in the last week over the actions 
of two Governors; in particular Gov-
ernor Greg Abbott of the State in 
which I live and where I am a Congress-
man—Texas—as well as the Governor 
of Florida, Ron DeSantis. 
Much is being made of the fact that 
these Governors transported certain in-
dividuals who had come to this country 
and were released into this country by 
this administration—I believe contrary 
to law, I believe in direct violation of 
both the text and the spirit of the 
law—that they were released into this 
country by the thousands. 
Governor Abbott of Texas and Gov-
ernor DeSantis of Florida transported 
some of these individuals to particular 
locations. Now, it was very clear that 
they did so in significant part to make 
a point. That point is that our States 
are bearing the brunt of an administra-
tion’s policies that are purposefully al-
lowing our border to be operationally 
controlled by cartels to the detriment 
of the American people. That is what is 
happening. 
So kudos to Governor DeSantis, 
kudos to Governor Abbott for bringing 
to light a problem which is being ig-
nored by the leftist press that refuses 
to bring the truth to the American peo-
ple. 
So 50 people get transported to Mar-
tha’s Vineyard, and the entire wine- 
and-cheese circuit loses their collective 
mind. Oh, no, what have you done? Oh, 
the cries of politicization of using 
human beings as pawns. But who is it 
that is using these individuals as 
pawns? Could it be my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle or the people 
in this administration that are leaving 
our border wide open, such that 53 
human beings died in a tractor-trailer 
in San Antonio, which I represent? 
So which is it? Which is worse? Fifty 
people being sent to Martha’s Vineyard 
to bring attention to a problem so that 
all of these Americans on Martha’s 
Vineyard could put their glass of wine 
down and put their cheese plate down 
and suddenly recognize that there are 
literally thousands of people being dis-
tributed into our country every single 
day by this government and by non-
governmental organizations. Every sin-
gle day. 
My colleagues do nothing about it. 
Fifty-three human beings died in an 
oven that was a tractor-trailer, and my 
Democratic colleagues don’t say a 
dadgum word. Nothing. 
But they sure say something when 
suddenly 50 show up to Martha’s Vine-
yard. Then everybody gathers around 
for a photo op and brings sandwiches 
and pats themselves on the back for 
their grand compassion because, oh, we 
are enlightened leftists in Martha’s 
Vineyard. We love everybody. So we 
are going to bring sandwiches, then we 
are going to call the National Guard 
and say haul them out of here. 
That is the truth. 
But why isn’t anybody talking about 
the 53 human beings that died in that 
tractor-trailer in San Antonio, Texas? 
One example of the thousands. 
There is a cemetery that has been 
created in south Texas with PVC 
crosses for bodies of migrants pouring 
across the Rio Grande in south Texas. 
That is what is happening to these peo-
ple, getting sold into the sex traf-
ficking trade, being abused by cartels, 
bodies littering ranches, dying in the 
Rio Grande River, dying in trucks. 
All while here in Washington, D.C., 
the Mayor of D.C. complains about, oh, 
we are now a border city; or the city 
councilwoman who said, well, we don’t 
have the infrastructure for this. Well, 
welcome to the party. 
b 1845 
Well, welcome to the party, because 
that city councilwoman declared D.C. a 
sanctuary city, and that city council-
woman called for the abolition of ICE. 
And prior to the individuals being de-
livered to D.C. by Governor Abbott to 
the steps of the Vice President’s 
home—who supposedly is in charge of 
securing the border but can’t find her 
way to the border if you gave her a 
map and a plane ticket to get there—73 
human beings were found in the Na-
tion’s Capital in a stash house right 
here within a couple of miles of this 
building, 12 of whom were kids. 
Where 
are 
my 
Democratic 
col-
leagues? 
They are burying their heads in the 
sand because it is not politically expe-
dient to acknowledge that open borders 
results in dead migrants, dead Ameri-
cans, empowerment of cartels, em-
powerment of China, and a danger to 
the American people and our national 
security, while almost 100 individuals 
associated with terrorist countries or 
terrorist organizations have now been 
apprehended coming across our border 
not even dealing with the million peo-
ple who were got-aways. 
I have given this speech so many 
times, but I keep having to update it. I 
keep having to come down to the floor 
and talk about what is happening in 
Texas and what is happening to our 
people. 
Now let’s talk about what is hap-
pening to Americans. These are the 
faces of the individuals and the lost 
voices of people who have died from 
fentanyl. I showed these to the Sec-
retary of Homeland Security, and he 
scoffed. There are 72,000 lost voices and 
72,000 dead Americans in 1 year. That is 
more than we lost in the entirety of 
the Vietnam war right here. 
Where are my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle? 
Where is the President of the United 
States? 
These individuals are dead. Their 
mamas found them in their house 
dying and tried to resuscitate them. 
They left their home in a body bag be-
cause they took a pill that was laced 
with fentanyl that was cooked up in 
the backyard of a cartel. Fentanyl is 
coming in from China, and they are 
dead. That is what is happening, and 
my Democratic colleagues are nowhere 
to be found. They are nowhere to be 
found. 
At the same time that we have got 
wide-open borders and our country is 
getting destroyed, we have vaccine 
mandates in place that are absolutely 
decimating our ability to maintain, 
control, and to hold our servicemem-
bers in the military. It is an absolute 
abomination. We are losing hundreds 
and thousands of servicemembers at a 
time when our recruiting levels are at 
historic lows. The Army is having trou-
ble recruiting. They are at 50 percent 
of their goals. 
I have met with members of the 
United States Marines, the Navy, the 
Air Force, and the Army, and they are 
all coming in under their recruiting 
levels. 
Meanwhile, we are firing people. 
They are losing their jobs. It is hap-
pening as we speak right now; members 
of the United States military are get-
ting fired and having to leave service. 
Why? 
Because of a vaccine mandate, a vac-
cine mandate being carried out by the 
administration 
with 
complete 
and 
total disregard for the fact that that 
vaccine does nothing for transmission 
and which the CDC wholly recognizes is 
totally useless for the individuals in 
question. 
In fact, now the President of the 
United States says the pandemic is 
over. 
The pandemic is over, so why are we 
firing our men and women in uniform? 
I will take a moment to recognize my 
good friend from Pennsylvania (Mr. 
PERRY), who is a veteran himself who 
served his country, to see if he has any 
thoughts on this matter. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
PERRY). 
Mr. 
PERRY. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman from Texas for 
the time and for bringing up what we 
know is wrong, what we clearly know 
is wrong.

iest population, by the way, in the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H8059 
September 21, 2022 
United States of America is in the 
military. We are down to less than half 
a percent of Americans who even serve 
in uniform. And recruiters, even before 
the pandemic, were telling us they 
were concerned about what they were 
looking forward to because the popu-
lation really just couldn’t meet the re-
cruiting goals because people were ei-
ther criminals, overweight, or what 
have you. 
So we already have a problem, and 
then you get this vaccine mandate. It 
is experimental, and they force the 
best of the best to leave the service. 
Meanwhile, we can’t defend ourselves. 
China is on the rise, Madam Speaker, 
you have got Russia threatening nu-
clear war, and the President declares 
the pandemic over while we are kick-
ing our finest people, people who said: 
Put me on the front line, I will sign the 
blank check and give everything, in-
cluding my life, in defense of our coun-
try. 
And we say, no, thank you. Unless 
you get this jab and bend the knee— 
and bend the knee—your service here is 
not wanted. 
Mr. ROY. As the gentleman probably 
knows, and I am sure he has talked to 
his own constituents, I have had people 
coming into my office saying, I don’t 
know what to do. I have served my 
whole life wearing the uniform, but I 
don’t think it is in my best interest, I 
don’t think it is helping the military, I 
am not going to do it, and I am getting 
fired. 
They have discharged 5,000 Active 
Duty servicemembers for refusing to 
take the COVID–19 vaccine while the 
Army’s recruiting levels, as I have 
said, are at 52 percent of the 2022 re-
cruiting goal. Forty percent of men 18 
to 24 are unvaccinated, the prime re-
cruiting demographic. Service academy 
applications are down 10 to 30 percent 
depending on the service academy, and 
now DOD comes in and says, hey, we 
need more money for recruiting. 
Well, how about you stop screwing 
up? 
How about you not tuck tail and run 
from Afghanistan and leave $85 billion 
behind? 
How about you stop pumping out 
woke garbage into the men and women 
in uniform? And how about you not fire 
them because they dare to say that 
they don’t want a vaccine? 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
PERRY). 
Mr. PERRY. How about this: any-
body who has served, anybody who has 
worn the uniform knows that as impor-
tant as recruiting is, to replace those 
who are retiring after spending the 
best 
years, 
their 
most 
productive 
years, and their most healthy years of 
their lives in uniform, the most impor-
tant thing is retention. It is how you 
treat the people who are going into 
battle. We are not interested in retain-
ing anybody, apparently, unless they 
bend the knee. 
So we are going to kick someone out 
after the American taxpayer has spent 
a boatload of money training someone. 
Madam Speaker, do you know what 
the cost of training an F–18 pilot is or 
an AH–64 pilot or the ultimate weapon, 
the American infantryman? Do you 
know what the cost of that is, Madam 
Speaker? 
After 18 years of service, the best 
years of their life, right before they are 
ready to retire because they won’t take 
the jab, we say that we are not inter-
ested in retaining you, even knowing 
that we can’t meet our recruiting 
goals. 
This is a complete dereliction of 
duty, and it is inviting to the enemies 
of the United States. This weakness is 
provocative, and you are seeing it all 
around the globe. This is all done by 
the Biden administration and leftwing 
Democrats who somehow think that 
the control that comes from the emer-
gency pandemic order is better than se-
curing our Nation. And even under the 
circumstance where the President him-
self said the pandemic is over, yet as 
my good friend from Texas just said, 
while we stand here at this very mo-
ment, while the pandemic is over, we 
are processing people out of the mili-
tary at this moment. 
Mr. ROY. It makes absolutely no 
sense. 
One might question why would this 
Congress and why would this body give 
more money to the Department of De-
fense and this administration to con-
tinue to fire men and women in uni-
form? 
Madam Speaker, why would we not 
attach to a continuing resolution re-
funding bill in 9 days a requirement 
that our men and women in uniform 
not be fired for not taking a vaccine for 
a pandemic the President says is over? 
Madam Speaker, $6 billion, by the 
way, goes to Fauci’s NIAID, and $9 bil-
lion goes to the CDC. 
Why are we funding this? 
Why are we funding an open border? 
Why are we funding $60 billion to the 
Department 
of 
Homeland 
Security 
which is causing Americans to die from 
fentanyl and causing migrants to die 
on people’s ranches, endangering the 
American people and allowing people 
known to be associated with terrorists 
in our country, and at the same time 
we are funding vaccine mandates to 
fire men and women in uniform when 
our recruiting levels are at an all-time 
low? 
It begs the question. 
But that is not the only problem. 
That is not the only thing we are deal-
ing with. We are dealing with an en-
ergy crisis. We are dealing with a re-
ality that energy prices are up. 
Why would that be? 
A tsunami of shutoffs the headlines 
say, 20 million U.S. homes are behind 
on energy bills, Federal oil leases slow 
to a trickle under Biden. Treasury Sec-
retary Janet Yellen warns that gas 
prices could spike again this winter. 
We are decimating the ability of the 
American people to be able to fund 
their lives, heat their homes, and drive 
their cars to work all in the name of 
choosing to pursue unicorn energy poli-
cies which are destroying our country. 
My colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle and this administration are 
purposely driving up the cost of gas, 
purposely driving up the cost of elec-
tricity, and purposely making our grid 
less reliable all so they can pat them-
selves on the back for pursuing a 
‘‘green’’ agenda that is doing nothing 
but empowering China, making our 
country worse, and not doing a dang 
thing for CO2, by the way, nothing. 
While 
China 
has 
1,100 
coal-fired 
plants and is building one new coal- 
fired plant a week, we have 250, and we 
are building zero. We are adding no new 
gas plants. We are adding no new nu-
clear plants to speak of. 
We are adding wind and solar, mak-
ing our grid less reliable. We are reduc-
ing our ability to produce liquified nat-
ural gas to the world. And we are deci-
mating our strategic advantage and 
undermining the health and well-being 
of the American people so my Demo-
cratic colleagues can pursue a leftist, 
radical agenda to appease their leftist 
base. 
The American people have had it. 
Here is another point. 
Why would we fund it? 
Why would we continue to fund a 
government that is doing that to the 
American people? 
I know my colleague here cares a lot 
about energy policies from his home 
State of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
PERRY). 
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, in 
Pennsylvania, of course, we stand on 
top of hundreds and hundreds of years 
of our natural resources that are abun-
dant and readily available. They are 
cleaner than any other place on the 
planet, and we have got an administra-
tion that says: Keep it in the ground, 
don’t use it. 
Madam Speaker, half of Pennsyl-
vania if you had gone back 20 years ago 
looked like the 1950s, maybe not half of 
Pennsylvania, but a good portion of the 
north central portion of Pennsylvania 
because there were no jobs. The leftist 
policies, of course, in Pennsylvania 
chased all the opportunity away, and 
families were struggling to hold on to 
their farms. Then horizontal drilling 
and hydraulic fracturing came into 
favor, and these farms and these com-
munities were saved and brought into 
the 21st century. 
The Obama administration and this 
administration has come in and said, 
oh, no. Back to poverty for you. You 
are not going to be able to afford to 
heat your home. 
And if you are, guess what? 
You are going to be making a choice 
between heating your home this winter 
and feeding your family, all by design, 
all on purpose, and all intentional by 
this administration. 
It is unacceptable, and as my good 
friend from Texas said, we are being

asked in the next few days here, when-
ever they come up with whatever they 
come up with, to keep funding this and 
to keep funding that kind of policy. 
Why would we provide one vote for 
it? 
There is not one Republican vote. 
Quite honestly, not one Democrat 
should vote for it if they love their 
country, if they love the people in their 
communities, and if they care about 
the people who are suffering and strug-
gling to pay their bills. 
Mr. ROY. Electricity, one in six fami-
lies are behind on their bills. Gas prices 
are $1.66 higher in this administration. 
Energy prices are six times higher than 
last year in Germany which just 
banned fracking and phased out nu-
clear which is a telltale warning for 
where we are heading. They are nation-
alizing their gas companies. Germans 
are stockpiling wood to heat their 
homes. 
Madam Speaker, you never met a set 
of policies that you could possibly 
imagine where you could do more to 
undermine and damage your own coun-
try than the policies that this adminis-
tration and the colleagues on the other 
side of aisle are adopting. 
So the question is: Will my GOP col-
leagues, will my Republican colleagues 
give $14.1 billion to the Department of 
the Interior to continue to lease fewer 
Federal acres for oil and gas? Will we 
do that? 
Will we give $9 billion to an EPA that 
is imposing a methane fee and taxes on 
the oil and gas industry that will be 
crippling my friend’s constituents, my 
constituents, 
and 
every 
American 
across the country, or the EPA that is 
targeting the largest U.S. oil field or 
proposing rules to shut down half of 
Texas’ coal-fired plants? 
They want to weaken our grid even 
further while also giving $10 billion for 
Federal wind subsidies that are de-
stroying our grid. That is the question. 
How about $5 million for climate czar 
John Kerry to fly around in his private 
jet talking about how great he is ad-
vancing a Green New Deal agenda? 
That is the reality. 
So here is the question—and this is 
really what I want to engage my col-
league, my friend from Pennsylvania: 
What do we do? 
What do we do in the face of an ad-
ministration and colleagues who are at 
war with the American people, who are 
endangering America with open bor-
ders while people die of fentanyl, who 
are at war with the American people 
and their ability to afford energy, have 
gas in their car, have a job, have elec-
tricity, and have a strong grid; and at 
war with the members of our military, 
making them lose their job if they 
don’t take a mandatory jab because Dr. 
Fauci says so? 
What do we do about an administra-
tion that is at war with the people, tar-
geting them, defining them as domes-
tic terrorists by the FBI, if you are 
challenging the school board, targeting 
them with 85,000 new IRS agents to go 
audit them to raise revenue? 
Madam Speaker, what do you do in 
the face of an administration that is 
doing that every single day? 
Madam Speaker, I will tell you what 
you do if you are a Republican or if you 
are a Democrat who actually believes 
in Article I of the United States Con-
stitution. 
I give you James Madison. I give you 
the father of the Constitution. 
In Federalist No 58 it says, ‘‘The 
House of Representatives cannot only 
refuse, but they alone can propose, the 
supplies requisite for the support of 
government. They, in a word, hold the 
purse. . . . 
‘‘This power over the purse may, in 
fact, be regarded as the most complete 
and effectual weapon with which any 
constitution can arm the immediate 
representatives of the people, for ob-
taining a redress of every grievance, 
and for carrying into effect every just 
and salutary measure.’’ 
That, Madam Speaker, is what the 
Founders gave us to push back on an 
executive branch that is out of control 
and operating in direct detriment to 
the American people or a Senate that 
refuses to do its job. 
The people’s House has this tool, and 
we should use it. I think my friend 
from Pennsylvania agrees. 
b 1900 
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, this is 
what we have. We are not the executive 
branch. We don’t enforce the laws. But 
when the executive branch governs 
against the will of the people—and la-
dies and gentlemen, what we hear all 
day around this place is, oh, they are 
trying to destroy democracy because 
they have a disagreement, they have a 
political disagreement, they are trying 
to destroy democracy. 
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a Re-
public. Madam Speaker, this is a Re-
public. And the power of the purse, the 
power of taking from the people a por-
tion of what they earn and distributing 
it through the Federal Government 
through its policies resides right here, 
right here in this House of Representa-
tives. It is the only thing we have. 
We can’t arrest people. We can’t pros-
ecute people. We can say enough is 
enough. You are governing against the 
will of the American people. You are 
governing against the best interest of 
your country. We are not going to help. 
We signed up not to help. You are not 
going to get our vote. 
If you want to do it, you can own it. 
You can go explain to the American 
people why they can’t afford their bills; 
why they can’t find things on the gro-
cery shelves; and why their police 
aren’t on the streets; and why they are 
worried about when they step out 
somebody from some other country 
who doesn’t belong here is going to kill 
their children or abduct them or rob 
their store. You can explain it because 
we are not going to because we are not 
going to vote to continue this charade, 
this assault on the American taxpayer 
and American citizens. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I want to 
say to my friend from Pennsylvania 
how proud I am to serve with him and 
how proud I am to serve with him in 
the House Freedom Caucus. People like 
to malign the Freedom Caucus on the 
other side of the aisle—heck, even a 
little bit on our side of the aisle—for 
daring to want to stand up for freedom, 
the belief in the individual, the belief 
in civil society, the belief in Fed-
eralism, and the belief in free enter-
prise. The belief that not all answers 
come from this town; it doesn’t come 
from this government. 
In fact, if you empower people, em-
power States, and empower civil soci-
ety, than human beings prosper, their 
lives are made better. They are able to 
go carry out the greatest things that 
you could possibly imagine to bring 
freedom to the rest of the world as this 
country has done for almost 250 years. 
That is why we are here. That is why 
I am in the Freedom Caucus. That is 
why I am pushing forward, along with 
my colleague, my friend from Pennsyl-
vania, and my other colleagues. Forty- 
two of us have signed a pledge and put 
out a letter, a letter that says that we 
are going to reject any continuing res-
olution that expires before the next 
Congress. 
Then we are going to reject any ap-
propriations package put forward by 
my colleagues on the other side of aisle 
this year, whether it is before or during 
any lame-duck session, because the 
American people should speak on No-
vember 8 about the atrocities that have 
been carried out against them by an 
administration that cares more about 
their political dynamics than they do 
about the American people every day. 
The American people should speak, and 
then we should spend taxpayers’ money 
on the priorities that they choose. 
Right now, I can tell you that those 
priorities are not continuing to carry 
out open borders, endangering them. It 
is not firing our men and women in 
uniform for daring not to take a vac-
cine. It is not continuing energy poli-
cies that are undermining our national 
security and stable grid. It is not hir-
ing IRS agents to go after the Amer-
ican people. 
We are just simply saying we should 
use the power of the purse. My message 
to my Republican colleagues: Use the 
power of the purse. Use the power of 
the purse to check the executive 
branch. Join us. Why are there only 42 
people who have signed that letter? It 
should be all 218 who are saying no. No 
to an administration. No to my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
who are at war with the American peo-
ple and their well-being. 
Stand up in defense of the people you 
represent. Don’t fund the government 
you campaign against every day. Hold 
that funding and demand change. Hold 
that funding and demand that you 
stand up for the people. Stand up for 
America. Stand up for energy freedom. 
Stand up for the ability of our men and 
women in uniform to serve. Stand up

for a secure border. Stand up for the 
ability to carry out your business with-
out being targeted by armed FBI and 
IRS bureaucrats and agents. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, what 
my good friend from Texas who joins 
me in the Freedom Caucus is alluding 
to is we are being asked to fund a gov-
ernment for a period of time in which 
the election will occur. We are going to 
run out of money here in 9 days, and we 
are being asked to fund the govern-
ment, and all things that my good 
friend from Texas has already outlined, 
all those atrocities, but not until the 
rest of the year, just until sometime in 
December after the election when peo-
ple have lost their election and there is 
no accountability. 
You know what they are going to do 
then? They are going to waltz right in 
here, and say: Oh, you know what? We 
are running out of money again. We 
got to do it again. You know what? I 
don’t have to stand for election. So if 
you think this one is bad, if you think 
all the things that Mr. ROY has out-
lined that are in this one, more money 
for COVID when there is no more pan-
demic—so says the President of the 
United States—if you think that is 
bad, just wait until these folks don’t 
have to stand for election in December. 
We are saying, if we are going to fund 
a package, first of all, it has to fix 
these things. First of all, it has to fix 
these things. Second of all, send it into 
the next term so that the people’s 
voice can be heard after November’s 
election. But that is not going to hap-
pen. That is not going to happen. 
There is no way—as my good friend 
from Texas says, not one more penny. 
Not one more penny to support these 
failed policies, these policies that go 
against the people that are governed by 
this town. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I want to 
credit our leader, Mr. MCCARTHY, for 
yesterday saying that he also believes 
that it would be wrong for my Repub-
lican colleagues to support a con-
tinuing resolution that does not ad-
dress the damage being done to this 
country by open borders. He is right to 
say that. He is correct to say that. 
We should demand that we change 
how we are dealing with the border be-
cause it is an absolute abomination; 
endangering Americans, endangering 
migrants in the false name of compas-
sion. We should change that because we 
can. 
Madam Speaker, I thank our leader, 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
MCCARTHY) for saying that because it 
is correct. We should not fund a gov-
ernment that is continuing to allow 
open borders to endanger the American 
people. We should fund a government 
that demands change. That is what the 
power of the purse is and that is what 
you use it for. 
My friend, Senator MIKE LEE from 
Utah, in the Senate, has circulated a 
similar letter demanding the same 
thing in the Senate. This is the time 
for the people’s House and for the Sen-
ate to stand up. We should demand 
change. If we don’t get change next 
week, and we get a continuing resolu-
tion into December, we should demand 
change in December. 
If we don’t get change in December, 
we should demand change in January 
or February or March, but we should 
demand change every day. We should 
be down here fighting on the floor of 
the House, not out at steak dinners; 
not out doing all the business of this 
town, but here doing the business of 
the American people who sent us here 
to change this place; to stand up for 
them, to stand up for America, to 
stand up for a better future. 
On July 2, 2026, when we turn 250 
years old, we can look proudly at our 
kids and grandkids and pass down a 
great country to them, instead of leav-
ing it bankrupt, which is what this ad-
ministration is currently doing. We can 
take that back. That is our calling. 
That is our calling today. And that is 
why I am proud to be in the Freedom 
Caucus with my friend, Mr. PERRY, and 
I will give him the last minute. 
Mr. 
PERRY. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the good gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. ROY) for bringing this to light. He 
is absolutely right. We didn’t come 
here, none of us came here on either 
side of the aisle, because we thought 
Washington was perfect. We came here 
because we know it is broken. 
If you know something is broken, 
why do you keep doing the exact same 
things that have broken it? Yet, we are 
being asked, once again, when we come 
here—well, this is what we always do. 
We are running out of money. We have 
to pass this. I remind everybody, we 
are, what, $32-, $31-, $30-something tril-
lion in debt. They don’t even print this 
money anymore; they just digitally 
create it. 
We don’t have the money to do this. 
Not one more penny to rule against the 
consent of the govern is what I say. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I appre-
ciate the gentleman. Not one more 
penny. Not one more penny for a gov-
ernment running at odds with the 
American people. Let’s use the power 
of the purse. Let’s stand up for Amer-
ica. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
f 
SLAVERY REMEMBRANCE DAY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. GREEN) for 
30 minutes. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, the great Maya Angelou summa-
rized the very essence of my being 
when she proclaimed ‘‘ . . . the gifts 
my ancestors gave, I am the dream and 
hope of the slave.’’ I am proud to say 
tonight that I am a descendent of 
enslaved people. 
I also want to acknowledge tonight a 
couple of righteous allies of enslaved 
people. Mr. STENY HOYER, the majority 
leader of the House. Mr. HOYER and I 
worked closely to bring the Slavery 
Remembrance Day resolution to the 
floor. I am very proud of what he has 
done to help us. I consider him a right-
eous ally of enslaved people. 
President Joe Biden: President Biden 
issued a press statement that I will be 
eternally grateful for as it relates to 
enslaved people. In fact, I would like to 
read from the statement that the 
President actually issued. Of course, it 
is 
the 
President’s 
statement, 
Joe 
Biden, marking Slavery Remembrance 
Day. He issued this on August 20, 2022. 
It reads: 
More than 400 years ago, 20 enslaved Afri-
cans were forcibly brought to the shores of 
what would become the United States. Mil-
lions more were stolen and sold in the cen-
turies that followed, part of a system of slav-
ery that is America’s original sin. 
Great Nation’s don’t hide from their his-
tory. They acknowledge their past, both the 
triumphs and the tragedies. Today is a day— 
He is talking about August 20. 
Today is a day to reflect on the terrible 
toll of slavery, and our Nation’s profound 
ability to heal and emerge stronger. 
He goes on to say: 
Despite the horrors they faced, these men 
and women and their descendants have made 
countless contributions to the building of 
this Nation and the continuous effort to re-
alize the American ideal. I was honored last 
year to declare Juneteenth a national holi-
day, another moment to reflect and rededi-
cate ourselves to becoming a more perfect 
union. And it is why my administration will 
continue the hard, ongoing work to bring 
true equity and racial justice to our country. 
I am grateful for the efforts of Congress— 
in particular, Representative Al Green and 
Senator Elizabeth Warren—to recognize the 
significance of this day. 
Madam Speaker, I mention the Presi-
dent because this day was many years 
in the making, many years. In fact, it 
was on August 20 of 1619 that the White 
Lion, a slave ship, a ship with enslaved 
human beings on it, docked at Point 
Comfort, near what we now call Nor-
folk, Virginia, and it had these 20 
human beings on it from Africa. They 
were traded for materials and goods 
and left there. 
b 1915 
This was a seminal moment in our 
history, August 20, 1619, some 246 years, 
108 days ago. From August 20, 1619, to 
January 31, 1865, when the 13th Amend-
ment was ratified, we considered these 
the years and days that this country 
had lawful slavery. 
It is interesting to note that over 
this entire period of time, there were 
persons who were very helpful to those 
who were enslaved. I shall talk about 
them later on in this half hour. 
The value of that 246 years of labor, 
unpaid labor, unpaid slave labor, has 
been estimated to be such as $14.2 tril-
lion. That is in 2009 dollars. So it is im-
portant for us to realize that these per-
sons who were enslaved over these 246 
years, 108 days, these persons gave 
America a foundation, an economic 
foundation that has persisted to this

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H8062 
September 21, 2022 
day—246 years, 108 days of free labor, 
some $14.2 trillion. 
In fact, these persons are the great-
est contributors to the American econ-
omy, the greatest contributors ever to 
the American economy, because of 246 
years, 108 days of free labor. 
Here are some of the well-known 
landmarks 
and 
buildings 
built 
by 
enslaved human beings. I will talk 
about them. This is according to an ar-
ticle styled ‘‘15 American landmarks 
that were built by slaves,’’ published in 
the publication known as the Business 
Insider and by James Pasley. Let me 
now start. 
The first is the White House. Accord-
ing to the White House Historical Asso-
ciation, enslaved human beings were 
likely involved in all aspects of the 
construction, including the carpentry, 
masonry, cording, rafting, plastering, 
glazing, and painting. 
The task force reported this. Slaves 
appeared to have shouldered alone all 
the grueling work of sawing logs and 
stones. 
The White House: Constructed by 
slaves. 
The U.S. Capitol Building: Enslaved 
human beings quarried the stone used 
for the floors, walls, and columns of 
the Capitol. They shaped that stone. 
They laid the brick foundations of the 
buildings. 
Enslaved human beings, in large 
part, also completed the carpentry as 
they framed the roof and installed its 
shingles and its coverings. Enslaved 
human beings were responsible for 
more skilled labor like plastering and 
painting. 
The White House and the Capitol. 
The Statue of Freedom atop the Cap-
itol: If you have been to Washington, 
D.C., you have seen the Statue of Free-
dom atop the Capitol. An enslaved 
human being created the Statue of 
Freedom. 
This is remarkable and almost pain-
ful to say, knowing that a person who 
was enslaved created the Statue of 
Freedom that is atop the Capitol. It 
was done so because Philip Reid was 
the only person available with the skill 
to make a bronze statue out of the 
plaster cast. 
The 
Smithsonian 
Institution 
in 
Washington, D.C.: Although enslaved 
individuals did not work on the actual 
building, they were the ones who quar-
ried the iconic red sandstone that still 
adorns the building to this day. 
Wall Street in New York: Enslaved 
human beings built the titular wall for 
which the street is named. In addition, 
Wall Street was the location of one of 
the largest slave markets in the coun-
try in the 1700s. 
Trinity 
Church 
in 
New 
York: 
Enslaved human beings helped to build 
the original Trinity Church on Wall 
Street, which stood from 1698 until 
1776. 
Fraunces Tavern in New York: Al-
though few specific details still exist 
on the process, enslaved human beings 
built one of the oldest buildings in 
Manhattan. 
Faneuil Hall in Boston: Enslaved 
human beings helped build the cradle 
of liberty indirectly by working for 
Peter Faneuil, who helped fund the 
building with funds made from slavery. 
Fort Sumter in South Carolina: 
Enslaved human beings helped build 
the fort where the Civil War began. 
They were forced to help create the 
bricks that made up the structure, as 
well as forced to repair the fort while it 
was under attack. As many as 20 slaves 
died during the attack on the fort. 
Harvard Law School in Massachu-
setts: Enslaved human beings helped 
build the Harvard Law School through 
the wealth of the slave owner Isaac 
Royall, Jr., whose wealth came from 
his sugar plantations and farms. 
Castillo de San Marcos fort in Flor-
ida: The oldest missionary fort in the 
United States was built by enslaved 
human beings who toiled for around 25 
years under the Spanish to build the 
fort. 
Georgetown 
University: 
Enslaved 
human beings were sold in order to 
raise $3.3 million in funds, in today’s 
money, to finance the construction of 
the Georgetown campus. 
The University of North Carolina: 
Enslaved human beings helped build 
the oldest public university in the 
country. Many of the University of 
North Carolina structures were built 
and maintained by slaves. 
Monticello in Virginia: Thomas Jef-
ferson’s home had its bricks and lime-
stone quarried, built, and placed by 
enslaved human beings. 
Montpelier in Virginia: President 
James Madison’s family had their 
homes 
cleared, 
created, 
and 
con-
structed by enslaved human beings. 
Mount Vernon in Virginia: President 
George 
Washington’s 
home, 
Mount 
Vernon, was built by enslaved human 
beings who were forced to quarry the 
materials, as well as build and main-
tain the home. 
In summary, enslaved human beings 
built some of the most well-known 
structures in our country. To recap, 
they built the White House in Wash-
ington, D.C., or helped to—there were 
others involved—the U.S. Capitol in 
Washington, D.C., the Statue of Free-
dom atop the Capitol, the Smithsonian 
Institution in Washington, D.C., Wall 
Street in New York, Trinity Church in 
New York, Fraunces Tavern in New 
York, Faneuil Hall in Boston, Fort 
Sumter in South Carolina, Harvard 
Law School in Massachusetts, Castillo 
de San Marcos fort in Florida, George-
town University in Washington, D.C., 
the University of North Carolina, Mon-
ticello in Virginia, and Montpelier in 
Virginia. 
It should be noted also that these 
structures are among those that are 
known to us. The list does not include 
the untold number of roads, bridges, 
and water wells, as well as houses and 
more, 
that 
were 
constructed 
by 
enslaved human beings. It also does not 
include the many crops planted and 
harvested in the agrarian economy 
built on the backs of enslaved human 
beings. 
All told, the total value of labor of 
every hour toiled under the whip of 
slavers in this country has been esti-
mated to be between $5.9 and $14.2 tril-
lion, 2009 dollars. This is why I say that 
the enslaved human beings are the 
greatest contributors to the American 
economy. 
As a group, as a lot, as a people, the 
enslaved human beings contributed up-
ward of around $14.2 trillion of free 
labor to this country. They were the 
foundational mothers and fathers of 
this country. 
This is a widely cited number, and it 
was calculated by the University of 
Connecticut 
researcher 
Thomas 
Craemer 
using 
the 
number 
of 
unremunerated work hours multiplied 
with 
historical 
free 
market 
labor 
wages. This is wealth that was stolen 
from human beings who have seen lit-
tle to none of it repaid. 
The American economy had hundreds 
of years of free labor that gave it a 
start, that allowed it to compete and, 
in a sense, to have a competitive edge 
that many other countries did not have 
simply because of enslaved human 
beings. 
I am honored to say that I am proud 
to be a descendant of enslaved human 
beings, the persons who built this 
country, the foundation of it, who gave 
it its start, its place in the economic 
order 
as 
a 
world 
power—enslaved 
human beings. 
So, now, let’s look at some of the 
people who were the enslavers. 
John L. Manning owned at least two 
plantations holding 670 human beings 
against their will, one in South Caro-
lina and another in Louisiana—a slave 
owner. 
Meredith Calhoun held more than 700 
enslaved people and produced cotton, 
more cotton than any other property 
in Louisiana. 
William Aiken was one of the State’s 
wealthiest citizens, the owner of the 
largest rice plantation in the State, 
with over 700 enslaved on 1,500 acres 
under cultivation, almost twice the 
acreage of the next largest plantation. 
This is, for many of the persons who 
have inherited wealth, how that wealth 
was 
initially 
brought 
into 
being. 
Enslaved human beings gave them 
their start with free labor—John Man-
ning, 
Meredith 
Calhoun, 
William 
Aiken. 
Another, John Burnside, was the 
largest sugar producer in the country 
during his time. Before he died, he 
owned 10 different plantations and 
enslaved 753 people at his peak. 
Joshua Ward, also known as the king 
of the rice planters, had 1,130 enslaved 
people. 
Stephen Duncan was a businessman 
who collectively enslaved more than 
2,000 human beings. He was one of the 
largest cotton producers, not in this 
country but in the world. 
b 1930 
The most that he enslaved that one 
time was 858.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H8063 
September 21, 2022 
These were the people who had the 
opportunity to acquire great wealth at 
the expense of the lives of other people, 
many of whom lived their entire lives 
in bondage and died as enslaved human 
beings. 
And what is unfortunate about all of 
this is we in this country have come to 
glorify those who were the enslavers. 
We glorify the Confederate military. 
We glorify, and to a certain extent, we 
deify many of the Confederate gen-
erals. These were the people that were 
fighting to maintain slavery. They get 
all of the honors, until as of late when 
we started to change that. But they 
have been given the honors. 
The persons who were the liberators 
were demeaned and portrayed as in-
sane, portrayed as murderers. But 
these were the people who were the lib-
erators. We have vilified the liberators 
and have glorified the enslavers. 
It is with great difficulty that we try 
to change this, but the difficulty is 
such that people don’t really want to 
hear about the slaves. They have been 
so indoctrinated with the glory of the 
enslavers that they can’t accept—many 
people—the fact that the slaves are the 
persons who were the foundational 
mothers and fathers of this country. 
The slaves should be honored and 
they should be memorialized. They 
should be placed in the same position, 
not for having done the same thing 
that persons have done on Memorial 
Day, those that we memorialize in the 
wars, but they should be given the 
same dignity and respect because they 
died for this country. They died in 
bondage for this country. They were 
born into slavery. They lived as slaves, 
and they died as slaves. They ought to 
be honored and memorialized to the 
same extent as we honor and memori-
alize those who died in the wars. That 
is hard for some people to accept. 
Many don’t want to hear that said. 
But they should be given the honor 
that they deserve for living and dying 
for this country, because they did. But 
not only did they live and die for this 
country, their children lived and died 
for this country. Their children were 
taken away from them, sold at the auc-
tion block. Their children and grand-
children lived and died as well. 
Why wouldn’t we honor the people 
who lived and died in bondage and gave 
this country its economic foundation 
to the same extent that we honor the 
people who died in the wars? We 
should. They made America great. 
They deserve the honor and dignity, 
the same honor and dignity that those 
who died in wars have been given. 
So let’s talk for a minute about the 
liberators. 
John Brown. I remember when I was 
in high school—or I don’t know if it 
was high school, maybe it was junior 
high. We studied our history. And I re-
member the indication to us was that 
John Brown was a crazy man, just out 
to murder people senselessly. 
John Brown was a liberator. He was 
fighting to liberate the people who 
were enslaved. He has never been given 
the honor that he deserves. John 
Brown ought to be honored to the same 
extent that we honor other persons 
who were liberators in wars. He was a 
liberator in this country. 
The difficulty associated with hon-
oring John Brown is this: When we 
honor others who liberated people from 
injustice, we are looking through a 
window into the world of other people. 
But if we honor John Brown, we have 
to look into the mirror and we see our-
selves and our transgressions. 
We have a lot that we have to do to 
atone for slavery: for taking people, 
selling their children, raping their 
women. We have a lot to atone for. And 
it is difficult for us to accept the fact 
that atonement is still something that 
we have not achieved. 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate this 
President because he has acknowledged 
our history. This President, in my 
opinion, will be among the pantheon of 
the greatest Presidents this country 
has had because he has fought injustice 
that others wouldn’t speak of. 
He put a Black woman on the Su-
preme Court. Others could have done 
it; they didn’t. President Biden did it. 
He acknowledged Slavery Remem-
brance Day. Others could have; they 
didn’t. President Biden did. 
He will be seen by those in the dis-
tant future as one of the greatest 
Presidents this country has had, espe-
cially as it relates to addressing injus-
tices. 
Sojourner Truth, abolitionist. She 
became the first Black woman to win a 
case against a White man in this coun-
try. It is amazing how people like So-
journer Truth are now starting to be 
recognized, but for years, have been de-
nied their rightful place in history as 
persons who fought for the liberation 
of Black people. 
Nat Turner, a preacher. A preacher 
who rebelled. He led a 4-day rebellion 
of enslaved people to free Black people. 
This was in 1841. When I studied this in 
high school or junior high—I am not 
sure which—Nat Turner was portrayed 
as a traitor, as someone who attacked 
this country. 
Nat Turner was a liberator. Nat Tur-
ner was trying to free people who were 
in bondage. 
Robert E. Lee, on the other hand, was 
trying to maintain slavery. Yet, we 
have had Lee high schools across this 
country. I know of no Nat Turner high 
school in this country. There may be 
one, but I know of no Nat Turner high 
school. 
There ought to be Nat Turner high 
schools across the country to the same 
extent that we have had Lee high 
schools because Nat Turner was the 
liberator. Lee was the enslaver. He was 
the person who would maintain slav-
ery. Why would we honor Lee to the ex-
clusion of Nat Turner, who was a lib-
erator? 
I know this is difficult for some peo-
ple to manage because we have always 
been told that the liberators were peo-
ple who were working against our 
country. They were working to free 
people. The Confederate soldiers were 
working and killing to maintain people 
in bondage. 
Madam Speaker, I speak the truth. 
No one can deny the truth of what I 
say. You can deny wanting to see and 
hear that truth, but it is the truth. 
Harriet Tubman, abolitionist, who 
sought to free slaves as well. She made 
13 
missions 
and 
rescued 
some 
70 
enslaved people. 
Madam Speaker, there are many 
more. I know that my time is nearing 
its end, but there are many more. 
Madam Speaker, I will just say this 
about Harriet Tubman. It has been said 
that she said she could have freed 
many more ‘‘if they had known they 
were slaves.’’ 
William Still, Elijah Anderson, Fred-
erick Douglass, and, of course, the 
great Abraham Lincoln: All persons 
who worked as liberators. 
I will be saying more about this. If 
you missed out on some portion of it 
tonight, I will present it in a similar 
fashion at a later time. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the major-
ity leader, Mr. HOYER, for being a 
righteous ally of enslaved people. I will 
be eternally grateful to the President 
for being a righteous ally and a person 
who issued the statement recognizing 
Slavery Remembrance Day on August 
23 of each year. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Our Heavenly Father, You are our 
mighty fortress. Continue to be for us 
a bulwark that never fails. 
Lord, inspire our lawmakers to do 
Your will. Direct them in their work. 
Empower them to meet each challenge 
and shield them from discouragement. 
May they not depart from Your pur-
poses for their lives in their thoughts, 
words or deeds. 
Lord, give our Senators the discipline 
to relinquish any spirit of self-impor-

Give them also the certainty that You 
are guiding their lives. 
We pray in Your merciful Name. 
Amen.

The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Under the previous order, the

The senior assistant legislative clerk

Treaty document No. 117–1, Amend-
ment to Montreal Protocol (‘‘Kigali 
Amendment’’). 
Pending: 
Schumer amendment No. 5503, to add an ef-

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader is recog-
nized. 
TREATY DOCUMENT NO. 117–1 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, 35 
years ago this month, every nation on 
Earth came together for the first time 
in human history to sign onto a global 
accord to save the planet’s dying ozone 
layer. It was a convergence unlike any 
before, uniting not just every member 
of the United Nations but, in time, also 
the European Union and even the Holy 
See. 
That accord, of course, was the Mon-
treal Protocol, hailed by then-UN Sec-
retary General Kofi Annan as ‘‘perhaps 
the 
single 
most 
successful 
inter-
national agreement to date.’’ 
Today, the Senate will finish the 
work of ratifying the Kigali Amend-
ment to the protocol when we vote 
later today here on the floor. 
Ratifying the Kigali Amendment will 
require two-thirds of the Senate, and I 
want to thank every single Member, 
Democratic and Republican alike, who 
voted yesterday to move forward on 
this measure. Our country, our busi-
nesses, and our planet will benefit be-
cause of it. I hope we can see that same 
level of support today. 
In a year where we have already seen 
plenty of major bipartisan bills become 
law, the Kigali Amendment might just 
be one of the most important bipar-
tisan achievements to date—less her-
alded, but maybe more important—be-
cause this measure will go a long way 
to lowering global temperatures while 
also creating tens of thousands of 
American jobs and deal with the fact 
that China rarely participates in global 
cooperation when it comes to putting 
their own economy and jobs ahead of 
ours. 
As I have explained, the Kigali 
Amendment will signal the commit-
ment of the United States to phase 
down the use of dangerous industrial 
chemicals known as HFCs by 80 percent 
over the next 15 years. HFCs are found 
practically in every home in America 
and around the world, inside the vast 
majority of refrigerators, air-condi-
tioner 
units, 
aerosols, 
insulating 
foams, and more. 
Experts say that if we can meet the 
goals set forth by the Kigali Amend-
ment, we can reduce global tempera-
tures by about half a degree Celsius by 
the end of the century. That is huge. 
We struggle to get that reduction

down, to get that increase down. And 
this is a big, big step forward for that. 
Half a degree might sound like a round-
ing error to some, but in truth, it is 
very, very, very significant. 
But equally significant, however, are 
the tens of billions in new investments 
that will be up for grabs if we ratify 
this amendment. 
Every year, millions and millions of 
refrigerators and AC units are sold 
around the world, and the United 
States ranks near the top of refrig-
erator exports. All of these products 
will need viable HFC refrigerant alter-
natives moving forward, and we need to 
take every step available to make sure 
those alternatives are provided by 
American companies and American 
workers, driven by American inge-
nuity. 
By one measure, ratifying the Kigali 
Amendment will generate nearly $39 
billion in investments here in America 
in the next 5 years when combined with 
other steps we have taken to transition 
away from HFCs. It will create tens of 
thousands of new American jobs and 
increase U.S. heating, ventilation, and 
refrigeration exports by 25 percent in a 
few short years, by 2027. 
Let me say that all again. Tens of 
thousands in new American jobs, near-
ly 39 billion in new investments, a 
surge in U.S. exports—all of that is on 
the table if we finish our work to ratify 
this amendment today. There is every 
reason in the world to say yes. 
There is really no down side to ratifi-
cation. The Kigali Amendment will not 
overrule or change any current U.S. 
law. It will require no one to replace 
their appliances at home. The United 
States will be able to lead the inter-
national 
process 
of 
implementing 
Kigali, ensuring U.S. businesses will 
set the terms of implementation that 
benefit them. And Congress will be per-
fectly free to change domestic policy 
to adapt to new technologies without 
having to worry about this agreement. 
Even without the Kigali Amendment, 
the United States has already taken 
steps to transition away from HFCs, 
and U.S. businesses have been the ones 
leading the way. So it is no surprise 
that groups like the U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce, the American Chemistry 
Council, the Air-Conditioning, Heating 
& Refrigeration Institute, and even 
companies like Walmart and Honey-
well all support the Kigali Amendment. 
So in many ways, this is sort of a leg-
islative layup. It is low-hanging fruit 
to secure billions in growth and tens of 
thousands of good-paying jobs. Again, 
there is every reason in the world to 
say yes and practically no reason to 
say no. 
So for the sake of U.S. businesses, for 
the sake of U.S. workers, for the sake 
of U.S. exporters and U.S. investment, 
and for the sake of leadership in safe-
guarding our planet, I urge my col-
leagues to vote yes on ratifying Kigali 
later today. 
DISCLOSE ACT 
Mr. President, now on DISCLOSE. In 
the 12 years since conservatives on the 
Supreme 
Court 
ruled 
in 
Citizens 
United, our elections have been become 
rank—rank—with the stench of dark 
money. 
Soon, the Senate will vote to erase 
this foulness when we hold the first 
procedural vote to take up the DIS-
CLOSE Act. This has been a long time 
coming, and credit goes to Senator 
WHITEHOUSE, perhaps the Senate’s most 
valiant enemy of dark money. I com-
mend him; I thank him; and I stand 
with him in his efforts to shine a light 
on the corrosive power of dark money 
in our elections. No one has done more 
to shine the light on this evil, evil 
thing. 
In free and fair elections—one person, 
one 
vote—American 
voters 
alone 
should have the power to determine the 
Nation’s leaders without fear that 
their voices will be drowned out by 
powerful elites or special interests. 
Sadly, unfortunately, dark money 
has rendered this ideal a fantasy. The 
idea of one person, one vote has been 
washed away by cascades of dark, un-
disclosed money pouring into our elec-
toral 
system. 
Today, 
the 
average 
American—someone who might chip in 
$30 or $50 every now and then to sup-
port a candidate—is left practically 
powerless against billionaires and spe-
cial interests who can cut million-dol-
lar checks to promote candidates of 
their choice. Who here thinks that is a 
healthy democracy? 
Because of today’s broken campaign 
finance laws, many of these donations 
happen entirely in secret. It is a veil 
cast over our democracy that leaves 
vast majorities of voters behind. 
And the problem is not just limited 
to our elections. Oh, no. Dark money 
has also corroded the judicial nomina-
tion process, as special interest groups 
spend tens of millions to push extrem-
ist judges onto the Federal Bench. 
I believe that the awful decision in 
Dobbs was greatly affected by the fact 
that dark money is undisclosed. 
The DISCLOSE Act operates off a 
simple premise: A healthy democracy 
is a transparent democracy, one where 
billionaires 
and 
mega-corporations 
don’t get a free pass to exploit loop-
holes in campaign finance law in order 
to spend billions in anonymous con-
tributions. That is the antithesis of de-
mocracy. 
This shouldn’t be a Democratic or a 
Republican view. After all, when was 
the last time any of us heard voters 
celebrate the spread of dark money? 
When was the last time any of us heard 
voters say it is better for billionaires 
and special interests to buy elections 
in secret rather than be held account-
able to the public? 
Of course the public doesn’t think 
that, unless they themselves—a few, 
few—are cutting million-dollar checks 
in secret. 
Even the Republican leader, who has 
dedicated much of his career to killing 
many campaign reforms, used to say in 
the distant past that disclosure and 
transparency are good things for elec-
tions. Unfortunately, that was a long 
time ago, and now all we hear from the 
other side are the absurd—and these 
are 
truly 
absurd—arguments 
that 
transparency somehow equates to sup-
pressing freedom of elections. Tying 
logic and fairness into a pretzel knot to 
say that transparency is like sup-
pressing freedom of expression is ab-
surd. Imagine. Imagine this. Imagine 
being on the side of millionaires and 
billionaires who would no longer have 
the luxury of influencing our elections 
by cutting million-dollar checks in 
total anonymity. What a tragedy. Isn’t 
that a shame? These poor billionaires 
and millionaires might have to disclose 
what they are doing. 
Of course, of course, imagining being 
on the side of those millionaires and 
billionaires is ridiculous. If a multi-
billionaire wants to spend colossal 
sums on candidates who are deeply 
anti-choice or who support insurrec-
tionists—which some of these dark 
money, special interest, MAGA Repub-
licans do—shouldn’t the public have a 
right at least to know, simply to know 
it? 
If someone wants to come here on the 
floor and argue otherwise, God help our 
democracy. 
Louis Brandeis said over a century 
ago that sunlight is the best of dis-
infectants. The DISCLOSE Act would 
put that into practice. 
So if you agree that the American 
people have a right to know who is try-
ing to influence their elections, sup-
port the DISCLOSE Act. If you agree 
that America’s representatives should 
only have one boss, the people, and not 
special interests, then support the DIS-
CLOSE Act. 
Democracy cannot prosper without 
transparency. Dark money, hidden se-
crets are the hallmark of dictatorships, 
left and right. We, in democracy, need 
transparency. 
I thank Senator WHITEHOUSE for all 
he has done. I strongly support passing 
this legislation to keep the dream of 
our Founders alive—alive—in this cen-
tury. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The Republican leader is recognized. 
INFLATION 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, on 
Sunday’s edition of ‘‘60 Minutes,’’ 
President Biden made a bizarre at-
tempt to deny the American people’s 
pain from Democrats’ runaway infla-
tion. After the latest nationwide data 
reported that consumer prices are ris-
ing at 8.3 percent year-on-year, the 
President suggested the country should

September 21, 2022 
be celebrating that they weren’t rising 
even faster. 
Working Americans aren’t buying 
that insulting spin. Middle-class fami-
lies aren’t rejoicing that their daily 
life costs 8.3 percent more than it did a 
year ago and—listen to this—13.2 per-
cent more than when President Biden 
took office. 
In Parma, OH, one local grocer is 
working hard to keep her prices com-
petitive but admits that ‘‘[w]e have 
been getting hit with all of our sup-
pliers with chicken, ground meat, ev-
erything.’’ 
And in Fairfield County, the head of 
one organization that helps feed folks 
experiencing economic hardship put it 
this way: 
I think things are going to get a whole lot 
darker and more bleak before they get a lot 
better. We’re desperately worried about food. 
Across the border in West Virginia, 
in Fayette County, persistent high 
prices have one retired grandmother 
worried about how the rest of her fam-
ily is making ends meet. 
She said: 
I’m already stressed and stressed and try-
ing to figure out how [my daughter is] going 
to pay to keep the lights on, get groceries, 
get school clothes on her kid’s back. 
In Perryopolis, PA, one shopper told 
a reporter that besides cutting back at 
the grocery store, she had taken on a 
second job of working nights at a ware-
house to help feed her family of four. 
This is what she had to say: 
Clothing, gas, just about everything has 
gone up, and food is a large part of it. 
Meanwhile, the head of a small man-
ufacturer in Big Bend, WI, reports that 
amid price spikes and backed-up supply 
chains, ‘‘trying to source products has 
been very difficult.’’ 
In each of these States’ cases—West 
Virginia, Ohio, Wisconsin, and Penn-
sylvania—one Senator tried to spare 
working families from all of this pre-
ventable pain. Each of those States has 
one Republican Senator who warned 
about inflation, who voted against in-
flation, and who voted for amendments 
that would have reduced inflation. 
But, unfortunately, each one of those 
States also has a Democratic Senator 
who decided to vote in partisan lock-
step to plow ahead with the trillions of 
dollars in reckless, inflationary spend-
ing. One Senator each from West Vir-
ginia, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wis-
consin cast the tie-breaking votes to 
bring this pain down on their citizens’ 
heads. Now, sadly, they are all paying 
the price. 
Working families in West Virginia 
are paying Washington Democrats’ in-
flation tax to the tune of an extra $563 
a month. Ohioans are paying $661 more. 
In Pennsylvania, inflation is squeezing 
folks for an extra $605; and in Wis-
consin, it is $673. Families in these 
States are paying a painful price for 
the deciding vote that their Demo-
cratic Senators chose to cast. 
ENERGY 
Now, Mr. President, on a related 
matter, Democrats’ runaway inflation 
includes skyrocketing costs to keep 
the lights on and to heat or cool 
homes. 
We are also witnessing the dangerous 
vulnerabilities 
that 
Democrats 
in 
places like California have built into 
their electrical grids. California Demo-
crats have spent years putting ‘‘green’’ 
lifestyle preferences ahead of the basic 
needs of working families. The result is 
a grid that is both more expensive and 
less reliable. We have seen the same 
California Democrats, who have spent 
years pushing their citizens to buy ex-
pensive electric cars, now begging the 
public not to plug them in. 
Even as California teeters on the 
brink of an energy crisis of European 
proportions, 
Washington 
Democrats 
are pushing the rest of the country in 
that very same risky direction. They 
made their signature priority for this 
year spending even more of the people’s 
money to take us even farther in the 
wrong direction even faster. 
Last month, our Democratic col-
leagues rammed through a gigantic 
party-line bill that raises taxes on reli-
able domestic American energy in 
order to subsidize wealthy people buy-
ing electric cars or fancy, new appli-
ances. Every Democratic Senator cast 
the deciding vote for that reckless 
spending spree. 
That includes the senior Senator 
from West Virginia, who claims he only 
did so because the Democratic leader 
promised him that Democrats would 
line up behind permitting reform to 
make it easier to build things and com-
plete projects in our country. But now, 
very predictably, this backroom deal is 
crumbling before our eyes. Almost 60 
days after our colleague from West Vir-
ginia gave up his vote for this vague 
promise, it still appears the far left and 
House Democrats want no part of his 
backroom deal they didn’t sign on to. 
As for the Republican side, our col-
league Senator CAPITO has put forward 
a real, actual, substantive permitting 
reform bill that would make the com-
monsense changes our country needs. 
Senator 
CAPITO’s 
substantive 
bill 
stands in stark contrast to what every 
indication thus far suggests will be 
weak, reform-in-name-only legislation 
from her home State colleague. 
As luck would have it, Senator CAP-
ITO’s real plan is also closer to passing 
the Senate than Senator MANCHIN’s re-
form-in-name-only 
plan. 
Senator 
MANCHIN recently told reporters that 
his version may need 20 Republican 
votes to become law, but Senator CAP-
ITO’s plan only needs Senator MANCHIN 
and nine other Democrats to get on 
board. We are talking about real, sub-
stantive reform that is already closer 
to becoming law. But so far, our Demo-
cratic colleague from West Virginia 
has refused to back his colleague’s 
commonsense proposal. He has shown 
little appetite to actually get some-
thing accomplished. 
So talk is cheap. If our colleagues 
across the aisle want real permitting 
reform, Senator CAPITO’s fantastic bill 
only needs Senator MANCHIN plus nine 
more Democrats to clear this Chamber. 
Otherwise, it would appear the senior 
Senator from West Virginia traded his 
vote on a massive liberal boondoggle in 
exchange for nothing. 
DISCLOSE ACT 
Mr. President, on one final matter, 
finally, with all of these national crises 
hammering families, the Democratic 
majority is using the Senate schedule 
to demonstrate that they do not care. 
The Democratic leader is not spend-
ing floor time on a bill to combat 
Democrats’ inflation crisis or their im-
migration crisis or their violent crime 
crisis or their energy crisis, not on leg-
islation to help American families’ 
daily lives in any way. Instead, the 
Democratic leader is setting up a vote 
on a bill to erode the First Amendment 
and make political speech more dif-
ficult. Instead of trying to address the 
root causes of their unpopularity, 
Democrats are attacking the American 
people’s ability to speak out against 
them. 
The Democrats try to ram through 
political takeover bills like this zombie 
DISCLOSE Act once or twice every 
year. 
This 
legislation 
would 
give 
Democrats’ friends in the unelected bu-
reaucracy even more power to police 
the political speech and activism of 
private citizens. 
Remember, donations to political ac-
tion committees and electioneering 
nonprofits are already publicly dis-
closed. That is already the law. What 
Democrats want is a huge, new step 
that would reduce private citizens’ pri-
vacy and chill Americans’ constitu-
tional rights. The same Democrats who 
wouldn’t condemn angry mobs gath-
ering outside the private family homes 
of Federal judges now believe that 
vastly more information about private 
citizens’ political views should be made 
public. 
It is no mystery as to how these 
things fit together. Even the liberal 
ACLU warned years ago that what the 
Democrats want to pull off ‘‘unconsti-
tutionally infringes on freedom of 
speech and the right to associational 
privacy.’’ 
I don’t often say the ACLU has it 
right, but they do here. 
Instead of addressing the reasons 
why Americans are upset with Demo-
crats, the Democrats are trying to leg-
islate our citizens into sitting down 
and shutting up.

ABORTION 
Ms. ROSEN. Mr. President, in the 
months since the conservative major-
ity on the Supreme Court struck down 
Roe v. Wade, the assault on reproduc-
tive rights by anti-choice, MAGA Re-
publicans has been relentless. 
Anti-choice States across the coun-
try have already enacted strict and 
rigid abortion bans that strip our 
rights away, threaten to jail women 
and their doctors, and put women’s

health at risk. And just as we have al-
ways known, this threat is not just at 
the State level. 
Last week, legislation was intro-
duced in this very Chamber that would 
enact a national abortion ban, one that 
would strip women of the fundamental 
right to control their own bodies. This 
abortion ban—and that is exactly what 
it is, a nationwide abortion ban—poses 
a real and serious threat to the rights 
of women across this country. This is a 
dangerous 
nationwide 
government 
mandate that would threaten women 
and their doctors—threaten them— 
with jail time, including those in my 
State of Nevada. 
Pro-choice States like Nevada, where 
the people voted overwhelmingly to 
protect reproductive freedoms as part 
of State law, would be forced—forced— 
to abide by this Federal mandate. Be-
cause Federal law supersedes State 
law, this legislation would override the 
will of Nevadans and the freedom—the 
freedom—that they have had for dec-
ades. 
If anti-choice Republicans in Con-
gress have their way and their national 
abortion ban passes—listen to this— 
then Nevada’s doctors could be pros-
ecuted; 
Nevada’s 
women 
could 
be 
jailed; and Nevada’s women could die 
as a result of a lack of access to care. 
So let’s be clear. The only thing 
standing in the way of their national 
abortion ban is the pro-choice majority 
in the U.S. Senate, and I will do every-
thing I can to fight this legislation 
threatening our reproductive rights 
not just in Nevada but across the coun-
try. 
That is why I helped to introduce the 
Let 
Doctors 
Provide 
Reproductive 
Health Care Act, along with Senators 
MURRAY, PADILLA, and the Acting 
President pro tempore, Senator LUJA´ N, 
to protect doctors in States like Ne-
vada, where abortion remains legal and 
protects women from facing prosecu-
tion and potentially jail by anti-choice 
States. No doctor—let me repeat this. 
No doctor should ever be jailed for pro-
viding women with the reproductive 
and often lifesaving care they need 
wherever these women are from. No 
doctor should ever be jailed for pro-
viding care. 
Anti-choice Republicans in the Sen-
ate have blocked these efforts in the 
past as they have continued to push for 
dangerous bans. 
Today—today—we have another op-
portunity to protect doctors and their 
patients by passing this legislation— 
without obstruction or delay—because 
let’s be clear: We will not—we will 
not—give up. We will not allow a na-
tional abortion ban to pass the Senate. 
We will not allow doctors to face pros-
ecution for doing their jobs. We must— 
we must—protect a woman’s right to 
choose and continue fighting against 
this ban every step of the way. 
I yield the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican whip. 
INFLATION 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, on Sun-
day, the President appeared on ‘‘60 
minutes,’’ where he was asked what he 
was going to do to help alleviate infla-
tion in light of August’s continued 
grim inflation news and the resulting 
stock market nosedive. 
The President’s response? 
Well, first of all, let’s put this in perspec-
tive. Inflation rate month to month was 
just—just an inch, hardly at all. 
‘‘Let’s put this in perspective’’? That 
might be something to say if the infla-
tion rate had ticked up from, say, 2 
percent—the target inflation rate—to 
2.1 percent, but I am pretty sure that 
that is not the appropriate thing to say 
when you are talking about the sixth 
straight month of inflation above 8 per-
cent and the ninth straight month of 
inflation at or above 7 percent and the 
11th straight month of inflation above 
6 percent. 
Even more concerning than August’s 
consumer price index rising 8.3 percent 
from the same month a year ago was 
the increase in core inflation—a meas-
ure of inflation minus the volatile cat-
egories of food and energy. This meas-
ure increased to 6.3 percent in August, 
up from 5.9 percent in both June and 
July, suggesting that inflation is sink-
ing its roots even deeper into various 
sectors of our economy—or in the 
words of a CNBC headline from last 
week: 
Inflation isn’t just about fuel costs any-
more, as price increases broaden across the 
economy. 
But, of course, you don’t have to take 
my word for it about the mess that we 
are in. Here is what one of President 
Obama’s top economic advisers had to 
say last week after August’s inflation 
numbers came out: 
Today’s CPI report confirms that the US 
has a serious inflation problem. Core infla-
tion is higher this month than for the quar-
ter, higher this quarter than last quarter, 
higher this half of the year than the previous 
one, and higher last year than the previous 
one. 
‘‘Let’s put this in perspective.’’ That 
is what President Biden had to say? 
Here is the American people’s perspec-
tive: Fifty-seven percent of Americans 
disapprove of President Biden’s han-
dling of the economy, and 37 percent of 
voters say that President Biden’s poli-
cies have hurt them personally, versus 
just 15 percent of voters who say his 
policies have helped them. 
These numbers are no surprise. The 
President may somehow still believe 
that he is creating an economy that 
will ‘‘work for working families,’’ but 
the reality is that, in the Biden econ-
omy, working Americans are suffering. 
Americans’ utility bills are soaring; 
their grocery bills have ballooned; and 
they are paying $1.30 more per gallon 
every time they fill up their car than 
they were when President Biden was 
elected. Real wages have dropped every 
single month since Democrats passed 
their $1.9 trillion American Rescue 
Plan spending spree—the bill, I would 
add, that helped plunged our economy 
into our current crisis. And 40 percent 
of Americans report having difficulty 
paying for their normal household ex-
penses. Americans are dipping into 
their savings or working side jobs to 
make ends meet. They are charging 
more day-to-day expenses on their 
credit cards. In too many cases, they 
are having to visit food banks, which 
are seeing huge lines thanks to contin-
ued high inflation. What are Democrats 
and the President doing about this? 
Nothing. 
Of course, last month, Democrats did 
pass a bill they called the Inflation Re-
duction Act. The problem? The bill will 
do nothing to reduce inflation—noth-
ing. Again, you don’t have to take my 
word for it. The nonpartisan Penn 
Wharton Budget Model said this about 
the bill’s impact on inflation: 
The impact on inflation is statistically in-
distinguishable from zero. 
‘‘[S]tatistically 
indistinguishable 
from zero.’’ 
Or you could take the word of the 
Democrat chairman of the Budget 
Committee, who admitted right here 
on the Senate floor that the so-called 
Inflation Reduction Act would not re-
duce inflation. 
But it is not just that Democrats 
have done nothing to help solve our in-
flation crisis; they are also on track to 
make Americans’ economic situation 
significantly worse. 
In 
August, 
President 
Biden 
an-
nounced a massive student loan give-
away that could cost anywhere from an 
estimated $500 billion to more than $1 
trillion and that the Committee for a 
Responsible 
Federal 
Budget 
notes 
would ‘‘meaningfully boost inflation.’’ 
This is a statement from the Com-
mittee for a Responsible Federal Budg-
et talking about the President’s mas-
sive student loan giveaway, and they 
say it will ‘‘meaningfully boost infla-
tion’’ or, as the president of the Com-
mittee for a Responsible Federal Budg-
et recently put it, ‘‘Amid 40-year-high 
inflation and despite the administra-
tion constantly touting its ‘fiscal re-
sponsibility,’ these changes will reck-
lessly add to the debt and make the 
Federal Reserve’s job in fighting infla-
tion even harder, which will amplify 
our risk of entering a recession.’’ 
Many of us would argue we are al-
ready in a recession—two consecutive 
quarters of negative GDP growth. 
Inflation has spent 8 straight months 
at 40-year highs, and the President has 
decided that now is a good time to im-
plement a policy that will ‘‘meaning-
fully boost inflation.’’ 
The economy continues to show signs 
of weakening, driven in large part by 
the inflation crisis Democrats helped 
create. Major companies have recently 
announced job cuts. Sixty-three per-
cent of small businesses are putting a 
hold on hiring, and 10 percent of those 
are cutting jobs. We have had negative 
economic growth, as I mentioned, for 
the past two quarters. So naturally— 
naturally—Democrats decided this was

a good time to raise taxes on busi-
nesses. Yes, Democrats’ so-called Infla-
tion Reduction Act imposes new taxes 
on businesses to help pay for their 
Green New Deal spending. 
I say ‘‘taxes on businesses,’’ but, of 
course, taxes on businesses largely fall 
on workers and consumers in the form 
of fewer jobs and opportunities, lower 
wages, and higher prices—in other 
words, pretty much the exact opposite 
of what we need right now, with prices 
soaring and wages failing to keep pace 
with inflation. 
The Inflation Reduction Act also im-
poses new taxes on energy that will 
drive up energy prices for both Amer-
ican families and American businesses, 
imposing further pain on family budg-
ets and likely prolonging our inflation 
crisis even further. 
The President may have wanted to 
build an economy ‘‘from the bottom up 
and the middle out,’’ as he has de-
scribed it; instead, he and his fellow 
Democrats have helped create an econ-
omy in which working families are 
struggling to make it from one pay-
check to the next. And thanks to the 
additional tax-and-spend policies the 
Democrats have recently implemented, 
working families are likely to be strug-
gling for some time to come. 
I yield the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Washington. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 4723 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, last 
week, Republicans made clear that de-
spite the clear outcry from people 
across the country, overturning Roe 
was just their first step. Republicans 
want a national abortion ban. Repub-
licans want to force my constituents to 
stay pregnant even when they do not 
want to be and to go after the doctors 
who provide abortion care. 
I am here today to continue to say in 
no uncertain terms that Democrats are 
not going to stand for it. While Repub-
licans are busy threatening the rights 
of women in every State across the 
country and threatening doctors with 
jail time, Democrats are here to defend 
abortion rights and defend the doctors 
who provide that care, because even be-
fore Republicans dropped their na-
tional abortion ban bill, I was hearing 
from providers in my home State of 
Washington who are facing a huge in-
flux of patients due to Republicans’ ex-
treme bans. 
Just yesterday, the Texas Tribune 
shared the heartbreaking story of a 
woman who learned that the pregnancy 
she had wanted so badly was incompat-
ible with life, that her daughter was 
developing without a skull or brain. 
But because Republicans in Texas 
think they know better than this 
woman or her doctor, she had to travel 
for treatment from Dallas all the way 
to Seattle to get the care she needed. 
Providers on the ground in my State 
tell me there are so many more pa-
tients being forced to make a trek like 
that. They are worried about caring for 
them, and not just because it is for so 
many more patients, not just because 
Republicans are straining resources 
and causing a healthcare crisis that 
puts women’s lives at risk; healthcare 
professionals are also deeply worried 
about how Republicans’ extreme laws 
threaten their practices. They are ter-
rified Republicans will take away their 
livelihoods and even their freedom just 
for doing their jobs, just for providing 
the care their patients need—care that 
is, once again, completely legal in my 
State. 
They are right to be scared. When it 
comes to Republicans’ extreme, no- 
holds-barred anti-abortion agenda, the 
writing is on the wall, and it has been 
for some time. Even before this latest 
bill, Republican State lawmakers were 
already drafting legislation that would 
make it a crime to provide abortion 
care to a resident even in another 
State where it is legal, and they were 
doing this while at the same time try-
ing to claim they didn’t want to throw 
doctors in prison. 
On top of all of that, they were 
standing in the way of the bill I will 
offer today to protect healthcare pro-
viders. This is a really straightforward 
bill. It simply protects doctors pro-
viding legal abortion care. 
The last time I tried to pass it, the 
junior Senator from Indiana said he 
was concerned about this bill ‘‘allowing 
abortions for anyone who crosses the 
State lines and is not a resident of that 
State.’’ In other words, Republicans 
are worried about all the patients I 
mentioned earlier who are traveling to 
Washington State seeking abortion 
care that they urgently need. Repub-
licans don’t think they should be able 
to travel to Washington State to get 
healthcare, and they want to allow 
other States to target Washington 
State doctors, to threaten them for 
providing legal abortion care. 
That is extreme. It is not what doc-
tors want, and it is definitely not what 
the American people want. Women and 
men across the country do not want 
politicians making their healthcare de-
cisions and throwing their doctors in 
prison. They want to be able to make 
their own decisions about their own 
bodies, their own families, their own 
future. They want doctors to be able to 
focus on doing their jobs, not fearing a 
jail sentence. 
So I urge my Republican colleagues 
to step aside and allow us to pass the 
Let 
Doctors 
Provide 
Reproductive 
Health Care Act. This legislation is so 
straightforward. It protects doctors 
providing legal abortion care, and it 
ensures that they can practice medi-
cine and save lives without fear of legal 
threats and intimidation. It makes 
clear that the attacks we have seen on 
doctors are unacceptable and that poli-
ticians should not be harassing or scar-
ing or investigating, threatening, or 
punishing doctors for providing care 
that is perfectly legal, that patients 
want, and that in many cases is even 
necessary to save lives. 
If Republicans have been doing what 
I have been doing, if they have been ac-
tually listening to doctors and pa-
tients, then they should reverse course 
and let us get this commonsense bill 
passed. But if they continue blocking 
these steps, if they continue ignoring 
the outcry from every corner of the 
country, if they continue to undermine 
the health of patients seeking care and 
the freedom of healthcare providers 
doing their jobs, they should know we 
are not going to stop pushing back. 
There is too much at stake. 
So, Mr. President, as if in legislative 
session, I ask unanimous consent that 
the Committee on the Judiciary be dis-
charged from further consideration of 
S. 4723; that the Senate proceed to its 
immediate consideration; further, that 
the bill be considered read a third time 
and passed and the motion to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon 
the table. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Is there objection? 
The Senator from Indiana. 
Mr. BRAUN. Mr. President, reserving 
the right object, I am glad the Supreme 
Court has returned the issue of life 
back to the people’s elected representa-
tives, where it should have stayed 49 
years ago. 
This legislation denies State rep-
resentatives the right to make laws 
protecting life. This bill is an attempt 
to undermine State laws that protect 
life by allowing abortions for anyone 
who crosses State lines and is not a 
resident of the State. 
Moreover, it gives the Department of 
Justice $40 million in grant funding to 
help people sue States—to help people 
sue States—that enact policies to pro-
tect life. The Department of Health 
and Human Services is given another 
$40 million in funding for any eligible 
center at Secretary Becerra’s discre-
tion. This funding is not protected by 
the Hyde amendment, and most likely, 
we are going to borrow every penny of 
it, like we do for most things in this 
place. We should not spend $80 million 
to undermine State laws on life or im-
pose a legislative backdoor for abor-
tion-on-demand across our Nation. 
For these reasons, I oppose this bill, 
and I do object. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The objection is heard. 
The Senator from Washington. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am 
deeply disappointed. I am not sur-
prised. We continue to see Republicans 
show their true, harsh colors, and the 
contrast with Democrats could not be 
more stark. 
We simply want people to get the 
healthcare they need and let them 
make their own medical decisions. Re-
publicans want to ban abortion nation-
wide. We want to protect doctors. Re-
publicans want to threaten and penal-
ize or even jail them just for doing 
their job, even when they are following 
their State’s laws. 
Mr. President, rest assured, I will 
continue 
speaking 
up 
for 
our 
healthcare providers, for families, for 
patients. And as we continue to see

this extremism, I want to assure every-
body that I am not going to stop fight-
ing. 
Mr. President, someone should be al-
lowed to travel out of their own State 
to get the healthcare they need. It is 
unbelievable 
that 
the 
Republicans 
block this bill. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
TREATY DOCUMENT NO. 117–1 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to oppose the 
Kigali Amendment. That is the United 
Nations treaty that is under consider-
ation in this body today. 
Two years ago, this body, the U.S. 
Senate, passed a bipartisan bill. The 
goal 
of 
the 
bill 
was 
to 
reduce 
hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs, and do it 
domestically. We passed it. It was 
signed into law. 
Now, these HFCs are gases that are 
used in refrigerators, air-conditioners, 
fire extinguishers, and in insulation. 
They also contribute significantly to 
greenhouse gas emissions. 
So I worked in a bipartisan way to 
build a coalition of Senators to pass 
the bill. Two years later, here we are; 
the law is now in effect in the United 
States. Parts of the law are still being 
implemented. Yet, now, today, we are 
being asked to sign on to treaty obliga-
tions at the United Nations that I be-
lieve are wholly unnecessary. 
We have already passed bipartisan 
legislation to reduce HFC consump-
tion, and it has already become the law 
of the land. Many of the benefits and 
the jobs that are being touted are U.S. 
innovations, and it is the result of our 
domestic legislation, not ratification 
of some U.N. treaty. We did it here. We 
did it right. 
I say we don’t need to get entangled 
now in another United Nations treaty. 
Our own law can be amended if we 
would like. It can be repealed. It can be 
replaced. Depending on the impact and 
cost, the United States can make 
changes quickly. It is much harder, if 
not impossible, to do it with an inter-
national treaty. In fact, when you take 
a look at the Kigali treaty and amend-
ment, there is actually no way to with-
draw from it if we ratify and join in. 
When I take a look at this, it is espe-
cially bad because it doubles down on 
the practice of treating China—yes, 
China—as a developing country. And 
the key word here is ‘‘developing.’’ 
China is not a developing country, but 
this treaty says they are a developing 
country, and it makes a big difference 
in terms of the treaty and the way that 
China is treated internationally be-
cause it gives China special treatment. 
And I will tell you, Mr. President, 
they don’t deserve the kind of treat-
ment that they would get with this. 
Under this treaty, China would get an 
extra 10 years—an extra decade—to 
produce HFCs. Well, this places us, the 
United States, at a competitive dis-
advantage to China for 10 additional 
years. 
Interestingly and, I think, surpris-
ingly to people when they hear this, 
the United States would also be ex-
pected to give more American taxpayer 
dollars to a U.N.—United Nations— 
multilateral fund that is set aside to 
help developing nations. The key word 
here again is ‘‘developing.’’ And they 
want to treat China like a developing 
country. So it would send more U.S. 
dollars to China because they have ac-
cess to this U.N. multilateral fund. 
Well, the United States is already the 
largest contributor to this fund. We 
have given over 1 billion of American 
taxpayer dollars to this United Nations 
so-called—it is a slush fund. 
But what about China? Do they con-
tribute? Oh, no, China has actually 
taken $1.4 billion out of the fund that 
we have contributed to because we are 
a developed nation and China is still, 
theoretically and legally, by this trea-
ty, developing. 
When you take a look at the debt 
that we have as a nation and you go 
and talk to any high school class or 
any junior high school class, as I have 
done 
in 
Wyoming—we 
did 
it 
in 
Wheatland, WY, with a bunch of really 
smart kids—they say: OK, when we 
have this debt, who are we borrowing 
the money from? 
Do you know what they say? Oh, we 
are borrowing it from China. 
So we borrow from China to give to 
the Multilateral Fund under this Mon-
treal 
Protocol. 
And 
what 
happens 
then? The Fund gives it to China. The 
United States borrows from China. We 
give it to the United Nations. The 
United Nations gives it to China. So we 
are further in debt to China. This 
makes zero sense. Even to the high 
school kids it makes zero sense. 
With 
ratification 
of 
the 
Kigali 
Amendment to the U.N. treaty, more 
and more American taxpayer dollars 
will be going to communist China. 
Now, this is happening despite the 
fact that everyone knows that China is 
not a developing country and shouldn’t 
be labeled as a developing country or 
be treated as a developing country. 
China is the second largest economy in 
the world. China is our greatest eco-
nomic and geopolitical rival. 
The United States should not let 
China play by a special set of rules 
that is designed to give a helping hand 
to truly developing nations. China 
doesn’t fit. But this is exactly what is 
outlined in the Kigali Amendment. And 
that is why I have filed at the desk an 
amendment to what is being discussed 
on the floor of the Senate today. My 
amendment says the United States will 
not ratify this treaty until China is de-
fined, rightly, as a developed country— 
not a developing country but a devel-
oped country—because they truly are. 
No special treatment for China, period. 
Everyone should stand up for that in 
this body, each and every Member. 
So Senators have some decisions to 
make: Are you going to vote to allow 
China to play by a whole different set 
of rules? Are we going to put America 
at a competitive disadvantage? Are we 
going to vote to continue to give Amer-
ican taxpayer dollars to China? 
Now, Members and my colleagues and 
friends on the other side of the aisle 
say: Oh, it is not about China. This is 
about HFC, the chemicals involved. 
Again, we have already passed bipar-
tisan legislation to reduce HFCs. The 
law is still going into effect. There is 
no excuse for any Senator to give 
China a handout at the expense of the 
American taxpayers and the American 
hard-working 
families—no 
excuse 
whatsoever. 
We should not be outsourcing our en-
vironmental policy. I urge my col-
leagues to support my amendment and, 
once again, say no special treatment 
for China. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
ORDER OF PROCEDURE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that at 2:30 p.m. 
today, Wednesday, September 21, all 
postcloture time in relation to Treaty 
Document No. 117–1 be considered ex-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4885 
September 21, 2022 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, there 
has been much made in the Biden ad-
ministration about the value of diver-
sity, and I agree that having diversity 
in any organization is positive. You get 
different viewpoints. But diversity en-
compasses much more than race or 
gender or religious orientation. Those 
are all important. Diversity actually 
means having people around you with 
varied experiences. As I mentioned, in 
my mind, that is certainly important, 
but it is particularly important in the 
Oval Office, particularly important in 
the White House. It is particularly im-
portant in the leadership of our Fed-
eral Government. 
Let’s take the example of military 
experience in this administration. You 
would think the Biden administration 
would think it is important to have 
members in his Cabinet or senior White 
House officials who have served in the 
military. After all, he is the Com-
mander in Chief, a very important part 
of his responsibilities. But, in fact, vir-
tually no one in this administration, 
with the exception of Secretary Austin, 
at the highest levels—Cabinet officials, 
senior White House officials—have any 
significant military experience at all. 
Why does this matter? The President 
doesn’t have it, of course. His Sec-
retary of the VA, Chief of Staff, Na-
tional Security Advisor—just go down 
the list. Nobody has any experience. 
In the Federal Government of the 
United States, why does this matter? It 
matters because it is obvious by the 
people this President surrounds him-
self—the people who are giving him ad-
vice on big decisions for America—that 
this President doesn’t prioritize mili-
tary, our national defense, and our 
troops and their families. This mani-
fests itself in many, many ways. 
First, most importantly, it matters 
in how we fund our national defense. I 
was on the floor last week, speaking 
about this very topic. This is President 
Biden’s first budget. You can see this 
here, what he proposed. It has the in-
creases through every Federal Agency. 
This was a multitrillion-dollar budget. 
And it says this is what we are 
prioritizing as the Biden administra-
tion. You can see, heck, double-digits. 
That is Education and Commerce. And 
EPA is over 20 percent, and Interior 
over 15 percent—on and on and on, all 
the green. It is just a massive expan-
sion of Federal Agencies, except two 
Agencies: Department of Defense and 
Homeland Security, the two Agencies 
that actually protect Americans. 
If you look to this line of inflation, 
which when the Biden administration 
put out their budget last year was 
about 4.5 percent, these are actual in-
flation-adjusted real cuts by about 2 to 
3 percent to our military. That was the 
Biden 
budget 
not 
prioritizing 
our 
troops, our national security at all. My 
view is that that is the No. 1 job of this 
government. It is not the President’s 
view, not his team’s view. 
In the interim—that was last year’s 
budget—we had a war in Ukraine. We 
had the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs 
and the Secretary of Defense testify in 
front of the Armed Services Committee 
that we are probably seeing the most 
dangerous time globally in any time in 
the last 40 years. 
So what about the Biden budget this 
year? 
Mr. President, you did it again. 
This is actually EPA, a 25-percent in-
crease—wow. 
But here we go, all the big double- 
digit increases. When you get down to 
the Department of Defense, with now 
the 9 percent Biden inflation, we are 
talking a 5-percent real cut to our mili-
tary. That is not prioritizing our mili-
tary. 
You are starting to see how this in-
flation and other things are really im-
pacting our troops. The Army, last 
week, in an article, suggested that the 
American military members who are 
having trouble making ends meet be-
cause of high levels of inflation should 
go on food stamps. You heard that cor-
rect. We are going to give the EPA a 
25-percent raise. We are going to cut 
defense spending by a 5-percent real 
cut, and if you are a soldier struggling 
because of high inflation to actually 
put food on the table, you can go get 
food stamps. That is the perfect exam-
ple of not prioritizing our military. 
I want to unpack this further. The 
Army is saying that, if our troops don’t 
have enough food to eat, they should 
look at going on food stamps. But the 
President finds it absolutely essential 
to forgive $560 billion in student loan 
debt just a couple of weeks ago. Who 
are the preponderance of Americans 
who will benefit from that lawless bail-
out? 
High-earning 
Americans, 
the 
elite—White House staffers, certainly. 
They are going to get a half-trillion- 
dollar bailout, and our troops are being 
told to go on food stamps. This should 
shock every single American. 
So we know the President and his 
team don’t prioritize the military. 
Look at these budgets or our troops or 
our national security. But that doesn’t 
mean they don’t find the military use-
ful. I am going to put up a picture of a 
recent speech that, I will tell you, 
every time I look at it, my blood boils, 
and so should every American’s blood 
boil. 
It is this picture. 
Now, every President gives partisan 
speeches. Now, I don’t think it is wise 
for every President to give the kind of 
partisan speech that President Biden 
gave on September 1 in Philadelphia in 
which he vilified millions, tens of mil-
lions of his fellow Americans who don’t 
agree with his administration’s poli-
cies. Some of you may have seen that 
speech. The President told the country 
that many of his fellow Americans, all 
of whom are Republican, don’t ‘‘respect 
the 
Constitution,’’ 
are 
‘‘destroying 
American democracy.’’ He gave this 
speech against a blood-red backdrop, 
fists clenched—look at him—yelling 
that millions of his fellow Americans 
embrace 
anger—while 
he 
embraced 
anger in his speech—and chaos. This 
President who continually issues law-
less Executive orders, like shutting 
down the ANWR in my State, his half- 
a-trillion-dollar student loan bailout, 
then 
says 
that 
Republicans 
are 
‘‘against the rule of law.’’ He went on 
and on—the insults, very partisan, 
somewhat deranged, attacking tens of 
millions of his fellow Americans. 
Now, look, Presidents do that. I don’t 
think it is a good idea. But here is the 
thing about this speech: To make mat-
ters worse—look at this—he did all 
this, a clearly partisan speech, while 
being flanked by two Active-Duty ma-
rines as his political props. Look at 
that. Look at that—in my view, a sick-
ening abuse of authority from a Com-
mander in Chief who has never served 
in the military—I think he got five 
Vietnam deferments—and knows noth-
ing about the Marine Corps’ ethos of 
honor, courage, commitment. 
Remember when General Milley, the 
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs—and was 
Chairman under President Trump as 
well—released a video where he apolo-
gized for standing beside the President, 
then-President Trump, when that could 
have been perceived as political. 
This is what General Milley said: 
I should not have been there. My presence 
in that moment and in that environment 
created a perception of the military [being] 
involved in domestic politics. 
I thought that was a good speech by 
General Milley. He made a mistake; he 
apologized; and that was the right 
thing to do. 
This is much worse. This is much 
worse. These marines, unlike General 
Milley, they are being ordered to stand 
next to the President of the United 
States while he rants against millions 
of his own fellow Americans. 
The President certainly didn’t apolo-
gize for this speech. In fact, when criti-
cized by both Democrats and Repub-
licans for the politicization of the mili-
tary with these marines propped up 
next to him, the Biden administration 
actually doubled down in terms of their 
use of these two Active-Duty marines 
as political props in a very partisan 
speech. 
Here is what the spokesperson at the 
White House said: 
The presence of [the] Marines at [that] 
speech was intended to demonstrate the deep 
and abiding respect the President has for 
[these servicemembers] . . . [for] the ideals 
and the unique role our independent military 
plays in defending our democracy, no matter 
who is in power. 
This is Orwellian doublespeak. What 
a bunch of nonsense. 
Here is the fact: The presence of 
these marines was meant to politicize 
the President’s speech and politically 
benefit from the honor and respect the 
few and the proud have earned in the 
hearts of Americans over decades, over 
millennium. This should disturb every 
single American, whether you are Dem-
ocrat or Republican. This was just 
wrong. 
Let me provide another example of 
the politicization of our military by

September 21, 2022 
the Biden administration. Now, this is 
something that hasn’t gotten a lot of 
attention. Some people were like, hey, 
it wasn’t a really big deal. I actually 
think it was a big deal. 
We have some of the best service 
academies in the world. They are the 
best in the world—the U.S. Naval Acad-
emy, West Point, Air Force Academy, 
Coast Guard Academy. Each of our 
military service academies has board 
members, some of whom are appointed 
by the President of the United States 
for 3-year terms. 
Now, I am honored to serve on the 
U.S. Naval Academy Board. I was ap-
pointed as a member of the Armed 
Services Committee. Here is the tradi-
tion in our country that every single 
President has abided by: When they 
come into office, they let the Board 
members finish out their terms. So, for 
example, when President Trump was 
elected, the Obama administration offi-
cials, who were President Obama’s ap-
pointees, finished out the terms on the 
Naval Academy Board, the West Point 
Board, and the Air Force Academy 
Board. That is what we do. 
The point is not to politicize the 
service academies. That has always 
been the tradition, every single Presi-
dent—except 
for 
Joe 
Biden. 
When 
President Biden came into office, he 
looked at West Point, Annapolis, the 
Air Force Academy, and somebody said 
to him ‘‘You know what, Mr. President, 
let’s fire all the Trump appointees. 
Let’s fire them right now, all 18 of 
them’’ to clearly politicize the service 
academies of America. So that is what 
they did—something that had never 
been done before by any President in 
the history of the country—and they 
did it regardless of qualifications of the 
current members serving on these 
boards. Let me give you some exam-
ples. 
Retired Army LTG H.R. McMaster 
was fired off the West Point Board. 
Ironically, the same day he was fired 
by President Biden’s White House, he 
was honored by the West Point Asso-
ciation of Graduates as the distin-
guished graduate of the year of West 
Point. So one President fires him, and 
West Point gives him a great honor. 
GEN Jack Keane, a former Vice Chief 
of Staff of the Army, was fired from 
the West Point Board; retired Army 
COL Douglas Macgregor; an Afghani-
stan war veteran, clinical psychologist 
Meaghan Mobbs; a Bronze Star recipi-
ent and businessman, David Urban; a 
retired Army lieutenant general, Guy 
Swan—18 qualified people, all fired. 
The politicization of the service 
academies of America was undertaken 
by this administration—the first Presi-
dent, the first White House ever to do 
it, all fired by Joe Biden and not al-
lowed to fulfill their terms. 
Of course, the Biden administration 
loves to use our military to push other 
agendas that have nothing to do with 
lethality 
in 
winning 
our 
Nation’s 
wars—many, many examples. Let me 
give you just a couple. From the begin-
ning, issuing Executive orders not fo-
cused on how we have a stronger mili-
tary but using taxpayer dollars to es-
tablish a committee within the Pen-
tagon to do what ended up being witch 
hunts on so-called extremists in the 
military, of which—when they came 
back with their report, they said they 
had actions of .005 percent. They also 
issued Executive orders to use taxpayer 
dollars to mandate transgender transi-
tion surgeries for Active-Duty soldiers. 
Importantly, 
they 
become 
nondeployable when that happens. 
So back to my original point, no one 
in senior positions in the White House 
or the Cabinet—with the exception of 
Secretary Austin—has significant mili-
tary experience, and on so many of 
these issues, there is no adult in the 
room. 
Think about these White House con-
versations where they are talking 
about, hey, let’s cut the defense budg-
et, and we will grow the EPA by 25 per-
cent. Well, that is a great idea, Mr. 
President. Let’s make sure we give a 
partisan speech at Independence Hall, 
and, oh yeah, let’s grab a couple Ac-
tive-Duty marines to stand right next 
to the President as his props. That is a 
great idea, Mr. President. Let’s come 
in and politicize the service academies 
and fire all the Trump administration 
appointees—even American heroes like 
H.R. McMaster, General Keane—de-
spite the fact that no President had 
ever done that before. Great idea, Mr. 
President. 
This is really problematic, what we 
are seeing right now, and that lack of 
prioritization extends here in the U.S. 
Senate, unfortunately, as it relates to 
our military. 
As we know with regard to defense 
budget cuts, in the 2020 NDAA, we had 
a debate right here on the Senate floor 
where my colleague the junior Senator 
from Vermont proposed an amendment 
to dramatically cut our military, al-
most by 15 percent, across-the-board 
cuts. He even actually wrote an op-ed 
in POLITICO. Remember, this is when 
Democrats were pushing to defund the 
police. Here is the op-ed. It is actually 
called ‘‘Defund the Pentagon: The Lib-
eral Case.’’ 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to have printed in the RECORD the 
op-ed ‘‘Defund the Pentagon: The Lib-
eral Case.’’ 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
DEFUND THE PENTAGON: THE LIBERAL CASE 
(By Senator Bernie Sanders) 
Fifty-three years ago Dr. Martin Luther 
King Jr. challenged all of us to fight against 
three major evils: ‘‘the evil of racism, the 
evil of poverty and the evil of war.’’ If there 
was ever a moment in American history 
when we needed to respond to Dr. King’s 
clarion call for justice and demand a ‘‘rad-
ical revolution of values,’’ now is that time. 
Whether it is fighting against systemic 
racism and police brutality, defeating the 
deadliest pandemic in more than a hundred 
years, or putting an end to the worst eco-
nomic downturn since the Great Depression, 
now is the time to fundamentally change our 
national priorities. 
Sadly, instead of responding to any of 
these unprecedented crises, the Republican 
Senate is on a two-week vacation. When it 
comes back, its first order of business will be 
to pass a military spending authorization 
that would give the bloated Pentagon $740 
billion—an increase of more than $100 billion 
since Donald Trump became president. 
Let’s be clear: As coronavirus infections, 
hospitalizations and deaths are surging to 
record levels in states across America, and 
the lifeline of unemployment benefits keep-
ing 30 million people afloat expires at the 
end of the month, the Republican Senate has 
decided to provide more funding for the Pen-
tagon than the next 11 nations’ military 
budgets combined. 
Under this legislation, over half of our dis-
cretionary budget would go to the Depart-
ment of Defense at a time when tens of mil-
lions of Americans are food insecure and 
over a half-million Americans are sleeping 
out on the street. After adjusting for infla-
tion, this bill would spend more money on 
the Pentagon than we did during the height 
of the Vietnam War even as up to 22 million 
Americans are in danger of being evicted 
from their homes and health workers are 
still forced to reuse masks, gloves and 
gowns. 
Moreover, this extraordinary level of mili-
tary spending comes at a time when the De-
partment of Defense is the only agency of 
our federal government that has not been 
able to pass an independent audit, when de-
fense contractors are making enormous prof-
its while paying their CEOs outrageous com-
pensation packages, and when the so-called 
War on Terror will cost some $6 trillion. 
Let us never forget what Republican Presi-
dent Dwight D. Eisenhower, a former four- 
star general, said in 1953: ‘‘Every gun that is 
made, every warship launched, every rocket 
fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft 
from those who hunger and are not fed, those 
who are cold and are not clothed.’’ 
What Eisenhower said was true 67 years 
ago, and it is true today. 
If the horrific pandemic we are now experi-
encing has taught us anything it is that na-
tional security means a lot more than build-
ing bombs, missiles, nuclear warheads and 
other weapons of mass destruction. National 
security also means doing everything we can 
to improve the lives of tens of millions of 
people living in desperation who have been 
abandoned by our government decade after 
decade. 
That is why I have introduced an amend-
ment to the Defense Authorization Act that 
the Senate will be voting on during the week 
of July 20th, and the House will follow suit 
with a companion effort led by Representa-
tives Mark Pocan (D–Wis.) and Barbara Lee 
(D–Calif.). Our amendment would reduce the 
military budget by 10 percent and use that 
$74 billion in savings to invest in commu-
nities that have been ravaged by extreme 
poverty, mass incarceration, decades of ne-
glect and the Covid–19 pandemic. 
Under this amendment, distressed cities 
and towns in every state in the country 
would be able to use these funds to create 
jobs by building affordable housing, schools, 
childcare facilities, community health cen-
ters, public hospitals, libraries and clean 
drinking water facilities. These communities 
would also receive federal funding to hire 
more public school teachers, provide nutri-
tious meals to children and parents and offer 
free tuition at public colleges, universities 
or trade schools. 
This amendment gives my Senate col-
leagues a fundamental choice to make. They 
can vote to spend more money on endless 
wars in the Middle East while failing to pro-
vide economic security to millions of people

in the United States. Or they can vote to 
spend less money on nuclear weapons and 
cost overruns, and more to rebuild strug-
gling communities in their home states. 
In Dr. King’s 1967 speech, he warned that 
‘‘a nation that continues year after year to 
spend more money on military defense than 
on programs of social uplift is approaching 
spiritual death.’’ 
He was right. At a time when half of our 
people are struggling paycheck to paycheck, 
when over 40 million Americans are living in 
poverty, and when 87 million lack health in-
surance or are underinsured, we are ap-
proaching spiritual death. 
At a time when we have the highest rate of 
childhood poverty of almost any major coun-
try on Earth, and when millions of Ameri-
cans are in danger of going hungry, we are 
approaching spiritual death. 
At a time when we have no national test-
ing program, no adequate production of pro-
tective gear and no commitment to a free 
vaccine, while remaining the only major 
country where infections spiral out of con-
trol, we are approaching spiritual death. 
At a time when over 60,000 Americans die 
each year because they can’t afford to get to 
a doctor on time, and one out of five Ameri-
cans can’t afford the prescription drugs their 
doctors prescribe, we are approaching spir-
itual death. 
Now, at this unprecedented moment in 
American history, it is time to rethink what 
we value as a society and to fundamentally 
transform our national priorities. Cutting 
the military budget by 10 percent and invest-
ing that money in human needs is a modest 
way to begin that process. Let’s get it done. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. So that was the lib-
eral case, defund the Pentagon. The 
junior Senator from Vermont wrote 
that. The majority leader put out a 
tweet saying he was a proud supporter 
of the defund the Pentagon amend-
ment. That was right here on the Sen-
ate floor. 
Of course, there is the National De-
fense Authorization Act, the No. 1 bill 
that focuses on national defense for our 
Nation. That passed out of committee, 
the Armed Services Committee, in 
June in a very strong bipartisan vote, 
23 to 3. It passed the House in July. We 
will have pay raises for our troops so 
the Army doesn’t have to tell them go 
line up for food stamps because they 
are hungry. And we need to bring it to 
the floor right here. 
So what are we doing? As far as I can 
tell, the majority leader doesn’t want 
to bring up the Defense Authorization 
Act until December—December. That 
is why I joined a letter led by Senator 
TUBERVILLE, with whom I serve on the 
Armed Services Committee, signed by 
20 of my colleagues, to say to the ma-
jority leader: Mr. Majority Leader, we 
have a dangerous world right now. 
Bring the NDAA to the floor. It is 
going to pass. It has great support. 
By the way, I know the Democrat 
Senators feel this way, too, on this 
topic. 
So we need to get this body back to 
what is important for our country— 
bolstering our economy, fighting infla-
tion, 
bringing 
down 
energy 
costs, 
unleashing American energy, and defi-
nitely passing the legislation that 
funds our military, that provides pay 
raises for our troops during this very 
dangerous time. 
So I again ask the majority leader to 
bring the NDAA to the floor. We need 
it. 
I call on the President and his admin-
istration—the President of the United 
States, the Commander in Chief—to 
truly prioritize our military and their 
families, and that begins with putting 
an end to using them in a disgraceful 
way as political props for your partisan 
agenda. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
WARNOCK). The Senator from Kansas. 
f 
ADVANCED AIR MOBILITY COORDI-
NATION AND LEADERSHIP ACT 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, Amer-
ican 
aviation—something 
we 
care 
about greatly in Kansas but across the 
country—it is entering a new era of in-
novation and of growth. Industry and 
government in this circumstance need 
to work together to make certain the 
United States stays competitive and 
remains the leader in this arena. 
In today’s technology and research 
and development, there are unmanned 
vehicles. They are autonomous. They 
will be flying passengers and cargo 
from point to point in the United 
States. 
These 
vehicles 
will 
take 
off 
vertically and land vertically, and it is 
important for us to begin the prepara-
tion for that development in our air-
space, at our airports, in our commu-
nities, and across the country. 
Bipartisan legislation, which I have 
introduced along with Senator SINEMA, 
the Advanced Air Mobility Coordina-
tion and Leadership Act, has been 
waiting Senate approval for weeks. 
This legislation would instruct the 
Secretary of the U.S. Department of 
Transportation 
to 
lead 
a 
working 
group comprised of members of various 
government Agencies and the civil 
aviation industry—a public-private ef-
fort. 
Their objective would be for them to 
review the steps needed to mature 
AAM past its initial operations, ensure 
a robust domestic supply chain, iden-
tify current Federal policies that can 
be leveraged to advance this industry. 
I thank Senator SINEMA for her help 
in moving this bill forward. It has been 
approved by the Commerce Committee, 
and the advocacy groups have been en-
gaged in helping us develop the legisla-
tion and helping us work its way 
through the committee and through 
the Senate. 
I also thank a number of Kansans 
who have provided information and 
support for this endeavor. 
This legislation is crucial to ensuring 
the United States remains a leader in 
the aviation sector for years to come, 
and I am anxious for it to become law 
with the President’s signature. 
Therefore, as if in legislative session, 
I ask the Chair lay before the Senate 
the message to accompany S. 516. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Chair lays before the Senate the fol-
lowing message from the House. 
The bill clerk read as follows: 
Resolved, That the bill from the Senate (S. 
516) entitled ‘‘An Act to plan for and coordi-
nate efforts to integrate advanced air mobil-
ity aircraft into the national airspace sys-
tem, and for other purposes’’ do pass with an 
amendment. 
MOTION TO CONCUR 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, now I 
move to concur in the House amend-
ment, and I ask unanimous consent 
that the motion be agreed to and that 
the motion to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
The motion was agreed to. 
f 
AMENDMENT TO MONTREAL PRO-
TOCOL (‘‘KIGALI AMENDMENT’’)— 
Continued 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise 
today to remind our colleagues of the 
incredible opportunity that we have be-
fore us today—incredible opportunity 
that we have before us today. 
Later today, this body, the U.S. Sen-
ate, will have the opportunity to vote 
to ratify the Kigali Amendment to the 
Montreal Protocol. 
What does that mean? 
Kigali, as it is affectionately known, 
is a global treaty to phase down the 
use of hydrofluorocarbons, also known 
own at HFCs. For years, HFCs have 
been widely used as a key component 
that are called refrigerants, but a key 
component in modern air conditioners, 
in refrigerators, and other cooling 
products. Yet, the United States is al-
ready transitioning away from using 
HFCs. We might want to ask, why? 
Well, one reason is that American 
companies are at the forefront of devel-
oping the next generation of coolant 
technology, the next generation of re-
frigerants. 
This transition away from HFCs is 
expected to stimulate literally billions 
of dollars in economic investment in 
this country—billions of dollars; create 
tens of thousands of jobs; and signifi-
cantly increase U.S. exports, all using 
technology developed in this country— 
all by using technology developed in 
this country; putting Americans to 
work, using technologies developed by 
Americans. 
Now, first, some history on how we 
got here. 
HFCs came about to replace ozone- 
depleting substances, which created a 
hole in our ozone layer. I said to some 
of my colleagues yesterday at a lunch-
eon where we were, Mr. President, that 
I first remember hearing about the 
hole in the ozone, I think, when I was 
in the Navy overseas, and reading 
about it in Time and Newsweek that I 
got in the mail while we were deployed 
and saying: I wonder what this is all 
about. What could be causing that? It 
turned out to be a big deal and one that 
still plays out today in the debate be-
fore us as well.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4888 
September 21, 2022 
But in 1988, this very body, the U.S. 
Senate, voted unanimously to ratify 
the 
Montreal 
Protocol, 
an 
inter-
national agreement to phase out ozone- 
depleting substances that was nego-
tiated under President Ronald Rea-
gan’s leadership. 
Since then, the global consumption 
of ozone-depleting substances has de-
clined by—get this—by 97 percent, 
while our economy has continued to 
grow. 
Now, that is good news. That is real-
ly good news. But, unfortunately, there 
is some bad news. 
The HFCs that have been used for 
years now to replace the ozone-deplet-
ing substances have been found to also 
be bad for our environment. 
So in 2016, the global community got 
together and amended the Montreal 
Protocol to also phase down HFCs, 
hydrofluorocarbons. 
This is not the first time we have 
ratified an amendment to the Montreal 
Protocol. The Kigali Amendment be-
fore us is the fifth amendment to the 
Montreal 
Protocol 
ratified 
by 
the 
United States. 
The Kigali Amendment was trans-
mitted to the U.S. Senate on November 
16, 2021—almost a year ago—300 days, 
in fact, ago. Each day that has passed 
without ratification represents a fur-
ther delay in supporting American 
businesses, in supporting American 
workers, and in growing our economic 
and national security interests and 
protecting our economic and national 
security interests. 
Thanks to American innovation, we 
now have HFC alternatives that are 
cleaner and more energy efficient than 
HFCs. And the best part—here is the 
best part: These cleaner, more efficient 
HFC alternatives are being manufac-
tured, as I said, right here, right here 
in the U.S. of A. 
In recent years, the American indus-
tries’ leadership on transitioning away 
from HFCs created an excellent oppor-
tunity for bipartisan action at the Fed-
eral level. And to that end, our friend 
and colleague Senator NEELY KENNEDY 
and I introduced something called the 
AIM Act, the bipartisan American In-
novation and Manufacturing Act. That 
was in 2019. 
Our bill proposed phasing down HFCs 
in our country by 85 percent over 15 
years—not overnight, not in 1 year, not 
in 2 or 3 years but phasing down by as 
much as 85 percent within 15 years, the 
same timeline as the Kigali Amend-
ment before us. 
So 16 Democrats and 16 Republicans 
joined the AIM Act as cosponsors with 
Senator KENNEDY
and myself. Addi-
tionally, a broad coalition of organiza-
tions, from the National Association of 
Manufacturers to the U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce to the American Chemistry 
Council, endorsed our bill, along with a 
lot of other American companies. 
In December 2020, the AIM Act be-
came law under a divided Congress and 
a Republican administration. It was a 
bipartisan win—a bipartisan win. It 
was an American win as well. 
Now it is time to build on that suc-
cess. Now it is time to seize on the op-
portunity before us and ratify the 
Kigali Amendment. 
The Kigali Amendment is good for 
our economy. Implementing the AIM 
Act, paired with ratification, will help 
generate nearly $40 billion of new 
growth in investment in the U.S. econ-
omy by 2027. 
It will also create roughly 150,000 
American jobs—150,000 new American 
jobs—and increase U.S. heating, ven-
tilation, air-conditioning, and refrig-
eration exports across the world by at 
least 25 percent over that same time 
period. 
In addition, Kigali ratification is 
good for consumers. As EPA’s data 
shows us, transitioning away from 
HFCs means average prices will be 
lower for consumers—lower for con-
sumers, not higher. Something I think 
we all support in this body. 
Ratifying Kigali will also build on 
our bipartisan success in the AIM Act 
by allowing the Federal Government to 
better protect U.S. companies from il-
legal dumping and smuggling of HFCs 
into our country from adversaries like 
China. 
And then, lastly, Kigali ratification 
will ensure U.S. companies continue to 
have access to international markets 
so that modern, efficient, economical 
air-conditioners 
and 
refrigerators 
across the world will be stamped 
‘‘Made in America,’’ not ‘‘Made in 
China.’’ 
So today, we, the U.S. Senate, have 
an opportunity to make that vision a 
reality; to build on the decades-long bi-
partisan record of success from the 
Montreal Protocol to the passage of 
the AIM Act a couple of years ago; to 
show our Nation and to show the world 
yet another time that bipartisan solu-
tions are lasting solutions. This is a bi-
partisan solution. This is a bipartisan 
solution, and it demands bipartisan 
support. 
I hope our colleagues will join Sen-
ator KENNEDY and myself and many of 
our colleagues, and, frankly, a whole 
ton of businesses across the country 
and organizations who support what we 
are doing, and join us in supporting the 
ratification of the Kigali Amendment. 
Let’s seize the day or, as we say in 
Delaware, ‘‘Carper diem. Carper diem.’’ 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
IRAN 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, tens of 
thousands of Iranian citizens are tak-
ing to the streets in dozens of cities 
across Iran as we speak. The chant that 
is echoing across that ancient land is: 
‘‘Death to the dictator.’’ Yet Joe Biden 
and the Democrats in Washington 
would rather make another disastrous 
deal with the ayatollahs and those who 
declare ‘‘death to America’’ and who 
are, at this very moment, working to 
assassinate American citizens on our 
sovereign soil. Barack Obama’s be-
trayal of the Iranian people during the 
Green Revolution is replaying before 
our very eyes. 
The latest revolt against the aya-
tollahs was inspired by yet another 
reprehensible crime by this theocratic 
dictatorial regime against its own peo-
ple. 
Last week, the ayatollahs’ thugs, 
known as the morality police, arrested 
a 22-year-old woman on the street for 
the heinous crime of allegedly not 
wearing a head scarf in public. They 
threw her into a police van; they bru-
tally beat her on the way to the deten-
tion center; they inflicted terrible inju-
ries on her, from which she soon died. 
Countless Iranians were immediately 
horrified by this cold-blooded murder 
and are now taking to the streets to 
protest their illegitimate outlaw re-
gime. They are burning hijabs and pro-
testing the oppression under which 
they have suffered every day for 43 
years. In the murder of this young 
woman, we see the true face of the aya-
tollahs, a regime which our President 
hopes to enrich with hundreds of bil-
lions of dollars and to appease with yet 
another terrible nuclear deal. In fact, 
just minutes ago, President Biden 
stood before the world at the U.N. Gen-
eral Assembly, stating at great length 
that he would continue negotiations 
toward this dangerous deal while offer-
ing only the briefest and emptiest of 
words to reproach the ayatollahs for 
the murder of this young woman for 
the grave crime of refusing to wear a 
headscarf 
in 
public 
and 
only 
the 
briefest of words for the thousands of 
protesters—at latest reports, seven of 
which have been murdered and many 
more shot and beaten—I would say this 
does feel a lot like deja vu, a replay of 
Barack Obama’s betrayal of the 2009 
Green revolutionaries. And why did he 
betray them in 2009? Was he caught 
flatfooted? Was he overwhelmed by 
events? Was he simply new to the job? 
naive? even incompetent? No. He be-
trayed those Green revolutionaries in 
cold blood because his one overriding 
objective was his terrible nuclear deal 
with Iran. 
He wanted a deal because he believed 
America was to blame for the decades 
of tension and conflicts with Iran; that 
America had sinned and we needed to 
atone for our sins against Iran and to 
pull in our horns; and therefore he 
stood idly by so as not to offend the 
mullahs and their street militias as 
they beat the Iranian people. 
And, today, for the very same reason, 
Democrats are once again selling out 
those brave Iranian protesters so they 
can once again try to buy the friend-
ship of the oppressive ayatollahs. The 
U.S. Congress should stand with the 
Iranian people and prevent another be-
trayal by a Democratic President. And

September 21, 2022 
you wouldn’t think it would be that 
hard. I mean, on face value, you would 
think self-professed progressive Demo-
crats would stand up as one against a 
so-called morality police who arrested 
a woman for the grave crime of not 
wearing a scarf over her hair in public 
and then beat her so severely that she 
died in custody. 
Imagine what would happen if this 
had occurred in, say, Saudi Arabia. 
Imagine what these Democrats would 
be saying if a country in Western Eu-
rope enforced its laws in this way. You 
would expect that Democrats could 
marshal just a tiny bit of outrage—the 
tiniest bit of outrage possible when the 
ayatollahs arrest a woman for not 
wearing a headscarf in public and then 
beat her to death. But, no, they don’t. 
And to be honest, you don’t even 
have to imagine these things either. 
We see how the Democrats have treat-
ed Iran for 13 years—as if America is at 
fault and we are the problem and Iran 
deserves an apology and hundreds of 
billions of dollars and to be brought 
into the civilized world. Look at how 
they treated Saudi Arabia as a pariah 
for years. In fact, look at Barack 
Obama’s entire response to the Arab 
Spring in 2011. It was just like his re-
sponse to the Green Revolution in 2009 
in Iran. The Iranian people rise up in 
protest, silence; the people of Egypt 
rise up in protest, Barack Obama with-
draws political support for Egypt’s 
leader and demands his immediate res-
ignation; 
protests 
in 
Libya 
where 
Muammar Qadhafi had been scared 
straight by George Bush and had come 
out of the cold, Barack Obama attacks 
his government and overthrows him 
militarily; protests in Syria, silence. 
What is the common thread in those 
responses in 2009 in Iran and 2011 in 
Egypt and Libya and Syria and 2022 in 
Iran? It is very simple. If you are pro- 
American, you get condemned—maybe 
overthrown. If you are anti-American, 
you get rewarded with hundreds of bil-
lions of dollars and a blind eye toward 
your grave crimes against your people 
and your aggression against America 
and our allies throughout the region. 
Again and again, the Democrats excuse 
the crimes of our enemies while they 
obsess over the flaws of our friends. 
As Jeane Kirkpatrick, the legendary 
Ambassador to the United Nations, 
once said—and it is true today of so 
many Democrats—‘‘they always blame 
America first.’’ 
We cannot allow Joe Biden to repeat 
the mistakes of Barack Obama and 
once again betray the brave people of 
Iran, which I would remind you is a 
mortal enemy of the United States. So 
I call on my colleagues to join me in 
standing with the people of Iran, with 
the brave people of that ancient nation 
who stand in the streets today chant-
ing ‘‘Death to the dictator,’’ not with 
the dictator and the ayatollahs who 
still to this day chant ‘‘Death to Amer-
ica.’’ 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
TREATY DOCUMENT NO. 117–1 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, China is not 
a developing nation. China is the 
world’s second largest economy. China 
is the world’s largest manufacturer, 
and China is the world’s No. 1 creditor. 
Yet this body, the U.S. Senate, is 
poised to ratify a treaty that ignores 
those facts and treats China with kid 
gloves. Simply put, the Kigali Amend-
ment places America at a competitive 
disadvantage, using American taxpayer 
dollars to subsidize Chinese companies. 
The Kigali Amendment restricts sup-
plies 
of 
compounds 
called 
hydrofluorocarbons or HFCs, which are 
refrigerants used in most air-condi-
tioning and refrigeration systems. The 
rationale is that HFCs leaking out of 
equipment and into the atmosphere 
add to climate change. However, even 
the EPA admits that HFCs contribute 
only five one-hundreths of 1 degree Cel-
sius to projected increases in global 
temperature. 
As a developing nation, designated as 
such under the Kigali Amendment, 
China is eligible to receive funding 
from the $4.5 billion Multilateral Fund, 
of which the United States is, not sur-
prisingly, the largest contributor. 
If this treaty is ratified, the United 
States will be required under the trea-
ty to meet strict deadlines for phasing 
out HFCs, while China is given an addi-
tional 10-year timeline to come into 
compliance with the same standards. It 
is doubtful, given its track record, that 
China has any intention of actually 
meeting its environmental obligations 
under this treaty. 
Treating China as a developing coun-
try gives it an unfair advantage in the 
existing HFC market and allows China 
to continue production, allowing that 
country to continue to undercut the 
HFC market well into the 2040s. As the 
world’s largest emitter of greenhouse 
gases, China has a long history of dis-
respecting and disregarding environ-
mental standards and has continually 
increased its emissions and invest-
ments in coal-fired powerplants since 
the 2015 Paris climate agreement. 
Under this treaty, Chinese-based HFC 
producers will get the largest share of 
the controlled market in future sup-
plies needed to keep existing cooling 
systems running. As it has done under 
past environmental treaties, China will 
continue to produce supplies that are 
not allowed under the updated environ-
mental standards. 
This is part of a conspicuous trend on 
China’s part. China wants to get ahead 
by playing by a different set of rules 
than the rest of the world—and cer-
tainly a different set of rules than the 
United States has to live under. We 
know China ignores the rules and has 
little respect, if any, for international 
norms, and yet we continue to allow 
China to dominate markets with the fi-
nancial support of American taxpayer 
dollars. 
This is a point where it just goes too 
far. We can’t give them that. They 
haven’t earned that. There is nothing 
about their behavior to suggest that 
they 
deserve 
this 
treatment. 
We 
shouldn’t give it to them here. 
To that end, later today, the Senate 
will likely vote on an amendment of-
fered by Senator SULLIVAN
and me. 
Now, it will not fix all of the flaws in 
the Kigali treaty; it will, however, 
begin to address the issue of China re-
ceiving special treatment at the ex-
pense of the American people. It will 
require the Secretary of State to pro-
pose the removal of China’s designa-
tion as a developing nation to the Vi-
enna Convention. I urge my colleagues 
to vote in favor of our amendment and 
acknowledge the fact that China is not 
a developing nation. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
IMMIGRATION 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, the cri-
sis at our southern border continues to 
break records. For the first time ever, 
the United States has encountered 
more than 2 million migrants at our 
southern border in a single fiscal year, 
and that doesn’t even include data for 
the month of September. 
Now, my State, the State of Texas, 
has a 1,200-mile common border with 
Mexico where most of these migrants 
show up, although some go to Arizona, 
some to New Mexico, and some to Cali-
fornia. But the vast majority of these 2 
million migrants have showed up on 
our backdoor step. This includes a 
hodgepodge of people, from asylum 
seekers 
to 
economic 
migrants, 
to 
criminals, to drug smugglers. 
In each of the last 6 months, the U.S. 
Customs and Border Protection has 
logged more than 200,000 migrant en-
counters—for 
each 
of 
the 
past 
6 
months, 200,000 a month. The media 
used to lose its collective mind when 
100,000 immigrants arrived in a single 
month, but I guess the public has be-
come desensitize to these numbers be-
cause they are so huge, and we have 
now been operating at twice that level 
for 6 consecutive months. 
Communities in my State of Texas 
have struggled to carry the weight of 
President Biden’s border crisis, and no-
body seemed to care. But the moment 
the burden reached the liberal enclaves 
of Manhattan and Martha’s Vineyard, 
the outrage machine fired up. 
Earlier this year, Texas Governor 
Greg Abbott began transporting mi-
grants to other States and cities to 
ease the burden on communities in 
Texas. After all, what are we supposed 
to do? Two million migrants show up 
at the border. Are they supposed to 
stay there? Well, most of them have 
been in contact with relatives and 
other people in other cities around the 
country, and so they eventually make 
their way to their destination. And, if 
they are asylum seekers, they are 
given a notice to appear for a future 
court hearing, which probably will 
never occur because of the huge back-
log in our immigration courts. 
So Governor Abbott did what any 
reasonable person would do and began

sending these migrants to other places 
where they eventually will end up at 
their final destination, wherever that 
may be. You can imagine 2 million mi-
grants showing up on your border and 
what the strain on local health sys-
tems is like, what the strain is on 
emergency response services. The more 
migrants that show up on our backdoor 
step, the lower the capacity to care for 
taxpayers who pay taxes to make sure 
those services are available. 
At the same time, nongovernmental 
organizations—we call them NGOs— 
along the border are expected to pick 
up the Federal Government’s slack and 
care for the migrants, which harms 
those charities’ ability to support more 
Texans and other Americans who rely 
on them. 
To state the obvious, the burden of 
this crisis should not fall on our border 
communities. 
The 
Federal 
Govern-
ment, after all, is charged with the re-
sponsibility of managing our inter-
national borders, and that includes mi-
gration. 
Simply stated, the Biden administra-
tion has refused to deal with this crisis 
or, frankly, even to really acknowledge 
it. But that doesn’t change the fact 
that my State—or any other State, for 
that matter—should not be left to 
manage the fallout alone. 
Now, since April, more than 11,000 
migrants 
have 
voluntarily 
boarded 
buses from Texas to Washington, DC; 
New York; and Chicago. In the past, 
the leaders of these cities have made it 
clear that they would welcome mi-
grants with open arms. They self-des-
ignate as a sanctuary city. Well, now 
this is their opportunity to provide 
that sanctuary and those services and 
relieve some of the burden on the bor-
der States that have borne the dis-
proportionate burden for all this time. 
But you would have thought that 
something nefarious was going on or a 
genuine public emergency had oc-
curred. They don’t care a whit about 2 
million people showing up on the Texas 
border. But when they show up on a 
bus in Washington, DC, or Chicago or 
New York, they howl like a dog that 
has been hit with a rock. 
After ignoring the border crisis dur-
ing the entirety of the Biden adminis-
tration, the arrival of a few thousands 
migrants in these sanctuary cities has 
put them into an absolute panic. The 
Democratic Mayor of Washington, DC, 
for example, declared a public health 
emergency after her city received only 
a few thousand migrants. Two million 
migrants at the border in my State, 
Arizona, New Mexico, and California, 
and they didn’t raise a peep. But a few 
thousand migrants to show up here in 
Washington, DC—roughly the same 
number that arrive on the southern 
border every single day—you would 
have thought there was an emergency. 
The Democratic mayor of New York 
said that his city is ‘‘nearly to the 
breaking point.’’ This is a city of 81⁄2 
million people. Yet the mayor said his 
city is near the breaking point even 
though it has welcomed only a few 
thousand migrants. Give me a break. 
Our colleague from Illinois, the ma-
jority whip, called the transportation 
of these migrants ‘‘cruel and inhu-
mane.’’ Giving people a bus ride to 
their ultimate destination strikes me 
as not cruel and not inhumane. The 
White House Press Secretary had the 
temerity to say it was ‘‘shameful and 
reckless.’’ Well, what is shameful and 
reckless is the Biden administration’s 
border crisis that it simply ignored for 
the last 2 years. 
Vice President KAMALA HARRIS even 
went so far as to call this ‘‘the height 
of irresponsibility’’ and a ‘‘dereliction 
of duty.’’ I doubt Vice President HAR-
RIS recognizes the many layers of irony 
in that statement. After all, last 
March, she was designated as the bor-
der czar for the Biden administration, 
but she wouldn’t visit the border. She 
was charged, by the President of the 
United States, with finding solutions 
to address this ongoing crisis. If she 
wants to talk about dereliction of 
duty, her refusal to acknowledge, much 
less address, the border crisis is a 
prime example of irresponsibility and 
dereliction of duty. 
But what is even more misleading 
about her statement is the fact that 
transporting migrants to cities far 
from the southern border is nothing 
new. In fact, the Biden administration 
has been doing it all along. Here is a 
chart. It shows the cities that have 
been 
receiving 
migrants 
from 
the 
Biden administration since the Presi-
dent became President of the United 
States in January of 2021: In Wash-
ington State, Yakima, if I am pro-
nouncing that correctly; Minneapolis; 
Denver; Phoenix; Yuma; even Atlanta; 
White Plains; Scranton; Baltimore; 
Harrisburg; Allentown; Jacksonville, 
FL; Birmingham, AL; Houston, TX; 
Brownsville; San Antonio; Dallas—all 
of these cities have been the recipients 
of migrants transported by the Biden 
administration. 
In April of last year, the Associated 
Press published a story with the head-
line ‘‘Unaccompanied children from 
border arrive in Pennsylvania.’’ The 
following month, the local news sta-
tion in Chattanooga, TN, posted a 
story with the headline ‘‘Late-night 
flights carrying migrant children ar-
rive in Chattanooga.’’ Here is another 
headline from October of last year: 
‘‘Biden administration quietly flies il-
legal immigrants to New York in the 
middle of the night.’’ We didn’t hear 
the howls of protest from Mayor 
Adams or the Governor when the Biden 
administration was doing what they 
are now complaining about. Though 
they don’t talk about it very often, the 
Biden administration has a history of 
transporting migrants to cities far 
from the U.S.-Mexico border, and they 
didn’t call it shameful or reckless then. 
Just to be clear, when somebody 
claims asylum at the border and passes 
an initial test of a credible fear of per-
secution, they are then given a notice 
to appear for a future court hearing 
that may be years off, with millions of 
cases in the backlog. That is called a 
notice to appear, and it shouldn’t sur-
prise anybody that, over the years, 
after people have already made their 
way into the interior of the United 
States, that many of them don’t show 
up for their court hearing. This is part 
of what the Border Patrol said is a lack 
of consequences associated with enter-
ing the United States in an irregular 
fashion. Oh, by the way, 90 percent of 
the people who do show up for their 
court hearing are not granted asylum. 
They don’t qualify. 
As I have stressed on many occa-
sions, Mr. President, communities in 
my State do not have the capacity, the 
infrastructure, or the resources to han-
dle this crisis alone. As New York City, 
the largest city in America, raises 
alarms over a few thousand migrants, I 
can’t help but think about what hap-
pened when 15,000 Haitian migrants 
showed up under a bridge in Del Rio, 
TX, a town of 35,000 people. The group 
of migrants who showed up under that 
bridge in Del Rio equated to more than 
40 percent of the city’s population. Can 
you imagine what a challenge that was 
just to feed people, provide them hu-
mane treatment, sanitation. But if you 
extrapolate that 15,000 in a city of 
35,000, that would be the equivalent of 
more than 3 million people showing up 
in New York City or 280,000 arriving in 
Washington, DC, in the course of just 1 
week. 
So whether they intended to do so or 
not, the mayors of Washington, DC and 
New York City—and Chicago, for that 
matter—have shown that the weight of 
this crisis is extraordinarily heavy, and 
they are only experiencing a tiny frac-
tion of what Texas communities have 
faced every day for the last year and a 
half. And do you know what? Appar-
ently the Biden administration simply 
doesn’t care. As these mayors now 
know, caring for these migrants who 
cross our border is a herculean task be-
cause of the sheer volume of people 
coming across. 
Legal immigration is part of the se-
cret to our success as a country. We 
naturalize a million people a year. But 
these are people who have chosen to 
jump ahead of those waiting in line to 
enter the country lawfully, and we sim-
ply don’t have the resources in place at 
the border or other places to deal with 
this vast tsunami of humanity—food, 
clothing, shelter, medical care, trans-
lation services, legal services, sanita-
tion. Communities in Texas apparently 
have been expected to bear the entire 
brunt and the entire burden. It is time 
consuming, it is labor intensive, it is 
extraordinarily expensive, and it is 
dangerous. 
The criminal organizations that are 
getting rich moving these migrants 
into the country for $5-, $10-, $15,000 a 
person are flooding the Border Patrol 
with these migrants, diverting nec-
essary resources from the Border Pa-
trol from interdicting the drugs that

September 21, 2022 
are entering our country that killed 
108,000 Americans last year alone. Sev-
enty-one thousand of those 108,000 died 
of 
fentanyl 
overdose, 
a 
synthetic 
opioid. Precursors come from China, 
get to Mexico, are manufactured there, 
and are smuggled into the United 
States. And fentanyl has taken far too 
many lives in every State and in every 
city in this Nation, and yet the Biden 
administration has not awakened to 
the fact that they are being played; 
that part of this business model, if you 
want to call it that, of flooding the 
border with migrants is to divert the 
Border Patrol and law enforcement of-
ficials from stopping these drugs, this 
poison, from coming into the country. 
Then, yes, in every city in the Na-
tion, we have seen a spike in crime. Do 
you know who the distribution net-
work is in the United States for the 
drugs that the cartels smuggle across 
the border? It is gangs in every city 
and in every State in the country. And 
who is responsible for most of the gun 
violence and crime in our cities? It is 
these gangs that are the principal dis-
tribution network for the drugs that 
come across the border. Yet the Biden 
administration has not connected the 
dots. I don’t know why. The DEA, or 
the Drug Enforcement Administration, 
the FBI Director—there are a lot of 
people in the administration who could 
inform the President and the Vice 
President of what the facts are, but 
they apparently are not even curious, 
or, if they know, they don’t seem to 
care. 
From El Paso to the Rio Grande Val-
ley, as I said, Texas shares a 1,200-mile 
border with Mexico out of our total 
border of 2,000 miles. The communities 
situated along that border simply can-
not handle the monumental job of deal-
ing with this flow of migrants and the 
failure of the Federal Government to 
live up to its responsibilities. But this 
isn’t a partisan matter. 
My friend Oscar Leeser, who is the 
mayor of El Paso, TX—he is a proud 
Democrat—he has been busing mi-
grants to get them off the streets of El 
Paso to the cities where they want to 
go. 
He said a few days ago: 
People are not coming to El Paso, they’re 
coming to America. 
It is only fair for other parts of the 
country to bear the burden that we 
have borne alone in my State and in 
other border States, as long as the Fed-
eral Government is simply advocating 
its responsibility to deal with illegal 
immigration and to fix this crisis. 
They know what to do. They simply 
are refusing to do it, presumably be-
cause some of their political supporters 
don’t believe in anything except open 
borders. 
The Biden administration has com-
pletely abdicated its duty to secure the 
border, and it has failed to supply bor-
der communities with the resources 
they need to try to manage this fall-
out. The truth is, no matter what the 
resources were, the numbers are just 
overwhelming. And that is the point. 
The cartels get rich; they smuggle 
drugs and additional migrants; and 
that is the point. So it is not going to 
stop until the Biden administration 
wakes up out of its deep sleep and deals 
with the reality of what is happening 
at the border. 
In the last 12 months, Customs and 
Border 
Protection 
has 
encountered 
more than 2.3 million migrants at the 
southern border, and that total grows 
every single day. All you have to do is 
turn on your TV set and see people 
streaming across the border, many of 
them turning themselves in, getting 
into this asylum system where they ul-
timately melt into the great American 
heartland, never to be heard from 
again, successfully making their way 
into the country. 
Our amazing men and women at the 
Border Patrol are grappling with staff-
ing shortages and poor morale. How 
would you like to be a police officer 
where the mayor and city council say: 
Well, we had to hire a police force, but 
we are really not going to fund that po-
lice force or we are not going to do 
anything to recruit more people to 
serve in that police force. And do you 
know what? We really don’t care 
whether they enforce the law or not. 
That is the message that the Border 
Patrol is receiving from the Biden ad-
ministration. So, of course, morale is 
bad. Of course, it is hard to recruit. 
The agents are outnumbered, they are 
overwhelmed, and, frankly, disgusted 
with the lack of leadership. 
Border communities are buckling 
under the weight of vast humanitarian 
needs, and now even the self-pro-
claimed sanctuary cities don’t seem to 
want to help. Unfortunately, the Biden 
administration appears to have no in-
tention of fixing the problem. And it 
sure seems like they don’t think any-
body else should have to help either. 
It is leaving Texas and other border 
States to buckle under the weight of a 
crisis that we had no hand in creating. 
It is forcing Texas taxpayers to make 
up for the failure of the Federal Gov-
ernment to perform its responsibilities. 
And what is worse, President Biden, 
Vice President HARRIS, and Members of 
this body are trying to paint my State 
as the enemy for trying to deal with 
the hand that it has been dealt while 
they continue to refuse to lend a help-
ing hand. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
DISCLOSE ACT 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I 
wanted to come to the floor and kick 
off the process that will culminate to-
morrow with our vote on the DIS-
CLOSE Act. 
The DISCLOSE Act will get rid of 
dark money in our politics. President 
Biden gave a good speech about it yes-
terday 
to 
help 
stir 
interests 
and 
progress in this area. 
There are problems with dark money 
in and of itself. It contributes to what 
has been called the tsunami of slime in 
our politics, because when the slimy ad 
has a fake, phony front group’s name 
on it and no actual real entity or com-
pany or association is accountable for 
that, well, then you can lie to your 
heart’s content, you can smear to your 
heart’s content, and there is no ac-
countability. 
So there are reasons for getting dark 
money out of our elections on their 
own: 
just 
giving 
disproportionate 
power to special interests, sliming up 
our elections, allowing a lot of bad ac-
tors powers that they don’t deserve, 
and putting enormous power in the 
hands of people who are, A, politically 
active enough to be willing to spend 
that kind of money and have a motive 
in legislative outcomes to spend that 
kind of money that regular citizens 
can’t begin to match. 
But there is a lot more to it than 
that. There is a lot more to it than 
that, because, like corruption, dark 
money is used to achieve other goals. 
And those other goals have had very 
important policy effects in our coun-
try. 
Climate change we are dealing with 
daily 
now 
in 
floods, 
in 
fires, 
in 
droughts, in species moving about— 
particularly in Rhode Island, our ocean 
fisheries are moving about. The oceans 
are acidifying. We are putting essential 
operating systems of our planet in dan-
ger and onto a course that mankind 
has never seen before in the entire his-
tory of humankind. 
When I got here in 2007, this was ad-
dressed as a bipartisan problem. There 
were three different bipartisan Senate 
bills, all of which were very consequen-
tial. It would have made a huge dif-
ference. Senator McCain ran for Presi-
dent carrying the Republican Party 
banner with a significant and serious 
climate platform, and it looked like de-
mocracy was responding to this prob-
lem in a responsible way. All of that 
activity came to an instant shuttering 
halt in January of 2010. 
What happened in January of 2010? 
What happened in January of 2010 was 
that the U.S. Supreme Court let loose 
one of the worst decisions it has ever 
rendered—the Citizens United deci-
sion—and that decision allowed unlim-
ited money to flow into politics. 
Of course, if you can spend unlimited 
money in politics, you suddenly have 
an unprecedented motive to hide it. If 
the most you can give is $3,500 or $5,000 
from your PAC, it is not worth putting 
a lot of effort into hiding that; plus, 
nobody really cares. But if you can 
give $35 million, plus, let’s say you are 
a polluting fossil fuel company and you 
don’t want people to know that, now it 
is worth putting quite a lot of money 
into the apparatus of hiding who you 
are. It is an expensive apparatus. It is 
a real apparatus. Senators have gone to 
the floor before to describe it. We have 
used this graphic. 
This is the web of climate denial that 
has been chronicled by scientists who 
study as a phenomenon climate denial 
and 
how 
the 
money 
flies

through these different groups and how 
they use it to hide what they are doing 
on climate. 
Well, once that got launched, that 
was the end of bipartisanship on cli-
mate. We lost a decade. I think history 
will show that the lost decade from 
January 2010 until now is one that 
these pages and children across the 
country will pay a very steep price for. 
Why would they be willing to do it? 
Well, the fossil fuel industry has an an-
nual subsidy of $660 billion, basically, 
from being allowed to pollute for free— 
$660 billion. 
If you are protecting a $660 billion 
subsidy, how much would you be will-
ing to spend any given year to protect 
it? If you spent $6.6 billion a year, you 
would still be earning 100 times your 
investment. Sure enough, we have seen 
dark money explode into expenditures 
by the billion. And as that happened, 
climate progress ended. 
Look at voter suppression. Across 
the country, there was a wave of Re-
publican 
State 
legislatures 
passing 
voter suppression laws. Was it an 
amazing coincidence that they all hap-
pened to do that at the same time? Evi-
dently not, because there is actually a 
tape from Heritage Action—one of the 
dark money groups behind those voter 
suppression campaigns—where the per-
son briefing the big donors admitted 
this: 
We’re working with these state legislators 
. . . in some cases we actually draft [the 
bills] for them or we have a sentinel on our 
behalf give them the model legislation so it 
has that grassroots, you know, from-the-bot-
tom-up type of vibe. 
The whole thing was a dark money 
fake fed into these State legislatures 
by dark money and no small amount. 
This is a $24 million investment— 
The speaker said— 
We . . . started . . . right after the Novem-
ber election. . . . we’ve driven hundreds of 
1000s of calls, emails, placed letters to the 
editor, hosted events, and run television and 
digital ads. 
So voter suppression is an artifact of 
dark money. 
And, last, Court capture. I have got a 
series of speeches that I have given so 
far—18 of them. When I do, I put my 
‘‘Scheme’’ poster up because this was a 
scheme; indeed, a scheme and a half. 
At this point, what we know is that 
at least $580 million was spent on 
phony front groups using dark money 
out to capture the Court. We don’t 
know how much additionally went into 
political coffers to reward people for 
their Court-packing enterprise or to 
threaten to punish people if they didn’t 
go along with the Court-packing enter-
prise, but it was quite a show. 
This is just one little node of that 
$580 million Court capture enterprise. 
It shows two groups, which is the cur-
rent, sort of, best practices—worst 
practices, better to say—in political in-
fluence. You have a 501(c)3 and a 501(c)4 
side by side, same location, same staff, 
indistinguishable in any real sense. 
And then in this case, they pushed 
what they called fictitious names so 
that their phony front groups had 
phony front groups that had names 
like Judicial Education Project and 
Honest Elections Project Action. But 
here is one that was somewhat signifi-
cant, the Judicial Crisis Network, be-
cause Judicial Crisis Network took $15 
million checks, $17 million checks and 
turned that money to TV ads to stop 
the confirmation of Justice Garland 
and to push through the confirmation 
of Justices Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and 
Barrett. So dark money flows into all 
these other areas. 
If you like climate denial, you love 
dark money. If you like voters having 
their votes suppressed by partisan leg-
islators, you love dark money. And if 
you like a captured Court that dances 
to the tune of the dark money donors 
who stocked it, you love dark money. 
And that is before we even get to its 
pernicious, insidious, clandestine effect 
in our elections. 
With that, I see that my time has ex-
pired and that Senator GRASSLEY is 
here for his time, so I yield the floor to 
my friend Senator GRASSLEY. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
HICKENLOOPER). 
The 
Senator 
from 
Iowa. 
FENTANYL 
Mr. 
GRASSLEY. 
Mr. 
President, 
today, roughly 175 Americans will die 
from fentanyl poisoning. Many of them 
won’t even know that they have taken 
the fentanyl. They will think they 
have taken Xanax for anxiety or 
oxycodone for pain. That is what Devin 
Anderson—you will see his picture here 
in a minute—of Shelby, IA, thought 
when he took a fentanyl pill marked 
like an oxy. 
Devin had fought hard for his sobri-
ety. He had enrolled in treatment and 
moved back home, but he was strug-
gling with anxiety. To cope, he took a 
pill from a friend. 
Devin’s coworker came to pick him 
up for work in the early morning of 
February 24 of this year. Devin wasn’t 
ready, so his coworker called him. 
When Devin didn’t answer, he called 
again. 
Devin’s 
14-year-old 
brother 
heard the phone ringing. He went 
downstairs to investigate and found 
Devin unresponsive. 
Devin was 23 years old when he died. 
His mom wants you to know that 
Devin was a kind person and he was 
loved by his friends. 
In 2021, fentanyl killed more Ameri-
cans between the ages of 18 and 45 than 
any other cause. That is more than 
COVID–19, cancer, and car accidents 
combined. 
Six months ago, I stood where I am 
now and asked for a permanent solu-
tion for fentanyl scheduling. Today, we 
are absolutely no closer to a perma-
nent solution than we were back then, 
6 months ago. 
While Congress has been waiting to 
take action, the cartels have not. The 
cartels have simply rebranded, coloring 
fentanyl like candy to addict Amer-
ica’s children. Fentanyl is in our 
schools, like in Blackwood, NJ, where a 
12-year-old overdosed on a schoolbus 
after his uncle made him clean a 
fentanyl trap house; or in Chipman 
Junior 
High 
School 
in 
California, 
where a 13-year-old brought 150 fake 
Percocet pills laced with fentanyl, with 
4 out of every 10 fake pills containing a 
potentially lethal dosage of fentanyl. 
Both of these schools are hours away 
from the Mexican border, but despite 
Customs and Border Protection’s ef-
forts, fentanyl has reached our chil-
dren’s hands. 
So when the Vice President tells the 
press that our border is secure, we all 
know that is just plain wrong and irre-
sponsible, and that attitude, that the 
border is secure, ends up killing. 
In the Federal Government’s absence, 
parents 
like 
Arletha 
and 
Robert 
Gilliam have been forced to fill the 
void. Their daughter Ciara died last 
month because of fentanyl. And you 
see Ciara right here. By all accounts, 
Ciara had a big heart. As her dad puts 
it, if you were in a bad mood, Ciara 
would make sure that that bad mood 
didn’t last very long. Even though she 
had graduated from Iowa’s Ankeny 
Centennial High School and lived on 
her own, she still FaceTimed her mom 
every day. 
But on August 23 of this year, no one 
could get hold of Ciara, so her grand-
parents drove by her house. Her car 
was in the driveway. Ciara’s grand-
parents knocked, both on her doors and 
her windows, with no response. Finally, 
Ciara’s grandpa crawled through her 
bedroom window. There, he found her 
dead on her bedroom floor. Fentanyl 
shut down her organs, and she went to 
sleep. She never woke up again. She 
was only 22 years old. 
Ciara’s parents are now searching for 
answers they never should have had to 
find in the first place. They have of-
fered a $50,000 award to locate the deal-
er who supplied the fake pill that 
killed their daughter. They deserve 
better than that. They deserve congres-
sional action, and they deserved it in 
2017 when the DEA, the Drug Enforce-
ment Administration, first scheduled 
fentanyl. 
Grieving parents are the unsung he-
roes in the fight against fentanyl. Time 
after time, they push through their 
heartbreaks to share their stories, as 
you have heard me tell for two fami-
lies, and now they demand action so 
that more kids don’t die. It is time for 
Congress to match the efforts of those 
parents. 
The Department of Justice has been 
very clear: 
The permanent scheduling of FRS is crit-
ical to the safety and health of our commu-
nities and class-wide scheduling provides a 
vital tool to combat overdose deaths in 
[America]. 
End of quote from the Department of 
Justice. 
For those whom we have lost, like 
Ciara and Devin, and for the countless 
lives that we will save if we take ac-
tion, it is time that we give them the

tool they need, and that is the sched-

long-term basis. 
COMBATING VIOLENT AND DANGEROUS CRIME 
ACT 
Mr. President, on another subject— 
and a shorter subject for anybody wait-
ing to talk—it is dangerous to live in 
many places in America, especially in 
blue cities. Like inflation, violent 
crime remains very high. For example, 
compared to 2019 midyear figures, 
America’s largest cities have seen a 50- 
percent increase in murders and a 36- 
percent increase in aggravated as-
saults. And it is no mystery what is 
causing this spike in crime. Blue city 
progressive, pro-criminal prosecutors 
and radical bail reform laws fuel this 
spike, a spike in violent crime, by let-
ting dangerous, repeat criminals go 
unpunished and, in some cases, even 
uncharged. 
The recent tragedies in Memphis, TN, 
earlier this month underscore the dan-
gers that families face at the hands of 
chronic criminals. And remember the 
words ‘‘chronic criminals’’ because the 
fact is that the majority of violent 
crimes are committed by a relative 
handful of repeat offenders like the two 
in Memphis. For example, criminals in 
Chicago charged with shootings and 
murders have, on average, 12 prior ar-
rests. In Oakland, CA, only around 400 
people, or just one-tenth of 1 percent of 
Oakland’s population, were responsible 
for a majority of the city’s murders. 
Now, just think, one-tenth of 1 percent 
of the population of that city is respon-
sible for a majority of the murders in 
Oakland. 
Federal 
law 
enforcement 
has 
a 
unique and very vital role in targeting 
repeat violent criminals, but for the 
last 2 years, the Senate’s ability to ac-
tually pass bills that expand criminal 
law to reduce violent crime and target 
repeat violent criminals has hit a brick 
wall. It is just impossible to get any 
consensus even though we all know it 
is a very major problem. 
In July, as part of my effort to pro-
mote a solution to this problem of 
major crime caused by a very small 
number of people in each community, I 
introduced a bill that I entitled ‘‘Com-
bating Violent and Dangerous Crime,’’ 
which is cosponsored by 26 of my Re-
publican colleagues in the Senate. The 
House companion bill was introduced 
September 15, with seven Republican 
cosponsors. 
The bill has seven simple solutions 
that will help to reverse this violent 
crime 
spike 
by 
putting 
dangerous 
criminals in jail and keeping them 
there. These commonsense solutions 
will fix real problems and bring imme-
diate relief and increased safety to 
communities plagued by the scourge of 
violent crime. 
Given the unprecedented increase in 
murders, we can and we should make it 
easier to prosecute murders. This bill 
will do that. 
Mr. President, 2021 was the deadliest 
year to be a law enforcement officer 
since 9/11. We should make it easier to 
prosecute people who attack law en-
forcement. This bill will do that. 
Carjackings are way up nationwide— 
200, 300, and even 400 percent in some 
cities. We should deter carjacking with 
sufficient sentences. This bill will do 
that. 
Dangerous drugs are being marketed 
to young people as colorful candy—I 
just spoke about that—and these chil-
dren are dying from overdoses. We 
should make it so that no children die 
from fentanyl made to look like candy. 
This bill will do that. 
Bank robbery, kidnapping—the list of 
violent crimes that would be strength-
ened by this bill goes on and on. 
I stand ready to work with Demo-
crats who want to provide relief to 
their constituents from this crime-
wave. So if any of them are open to any 
of these provisions, I want them to 
know that I am ready to work with 
them. Let’s partner together to make 
the American people safer. 
I yield the floor.

ator from Mississippi. 
INFLATION 
Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Mr. President, 
over the past week, Americans were hit 
once again with a grave inflation re-
port. Worse, the American people got 
more evidence of just how out of touch 
the White House and congressional 
Democrats are with the damage infla-
tion is doing to families across the 
country. 
We were all hoping President Biden’s 
crushing inflation might show signs of 
easing and give folks a chance to catch 
their breath after months and months 
of watching their paychecks shrink. 
That is not what happened at all. Infla-
tion is up 8.3 percent from a year ago— 
a disastrous number. 
We are feeling the inflation in every 
aspect of our lives, from paying utility 
bills to gassing up cars, to rent and in-
surance, and, especially, to the basics 
like food. Grocery prices are up 13.5 
percent from this time last year, which 
is a crushing blow to most Americans 
who visit their local store once a week, 
like I do. Milk is up 17 percent. Bread 
and chicken are up 16 percent. Eggs are 
up an outrageous 40 percent. And the 
list goes on and on. 
I do my own shopping for my family, 
and I see this weekly, and it is incred-
ible. This is a reality, but President 
Biden appears to be living in a very, 
very different reality. When the latest 
bad inflation numbers were released 
last week, the President and Wash-
ington Democrats threw a party on the 
White House lawn. That is right, a 
party—a lawn party. The President and 
Democrats celebrated as the rest of us 
watched the Dow plummet and re-
ceived an inflation report confirming 
that this is the worst year for food and 
electricity inflation since the fallout 
from President Jimmy Carter. 
What exactly did they celebrate? 
Their latest reckless, Big Government 
spending bill. 
I don’t have to remind you that, just 
over 
a 
year 
ago, 
the 
Democrats 
rammed 
through 
their 
$2 
trillion 
spending 
spree 
despite 
economists 
warning that it would be a catalyst for 
rampant inflation. Economists warned 
us then, and they are warning us now, 
about the misnamed Inflation Reduc-
tion Act; namely, that it won’t do any-
thing to ease inflation, but it will cer-
tainly add to the deficit. 
Apparently, hosting a big party is 
preferable than heeding these non-
partisan warnings and getting to work 
to get our Nation back on the right 
track. 
When the ‘‘Inflation Act’’ was on the 
floor, 
Republicans 
tried 
countless 
times to adopt solutions to tackle in-
flation, crime, and secure our border. 
But our efforts were consistently shut 
down because not one Senate Democrat 
could spare a penny from the Green 
New Deal. No, they have their own pri-
orities, and they are awfully out of 
touch with the priorities of American 
families. 
On Sunday, we were given more evi-
dence that the President is living in a 
completely different world than the 
rest of us. The President appeared on 
‘‘60 Minutes,’’ where he discussed sev-
eral challenges currently facing our 
Nation, only, according to him, our Na-
tion is doing swell. And indeed, the 
President seemed to paint a rosy pic-
ture of little to no inflation and sug-
gested we should be relieved by the new 
inflation numbers. 
When asked what he could do better 
and faster to help Americans get some 
relief at the grocery store checkout 
line, he claimed inflation was up 
‘‘hardly at all.’’ 
‘‘Hardly at all’’? Say that to parents 
paying 40 percent more for a dozen of 
eggs just to feed their children break-
fast. Say that to workers who are 
watching their savings dwindle month 
after month because their paychecks 
can’t keep up with these prices. Say 
that to the Americans who are just 
barely getting by in this economy. 
President Biden, you may not have 
to visit the grocery store or pay an 
electricity bill, but my constituents 
do. 
Time and time again, the President 
and his allies in Congress have proven 
he is out of touch with American prior-
ities and in denial about the real suf-
fering and fears of the American peo-
ple. They are right to question whether 
they can still afford the leadership 
they are getting out of the White 
House and the Democrat-led Congress. 
It is high time for the President and 
Democrats to align their priorities 
with those of the people, allow real so-
lutions to be considered on the Senate 
floor, and get out our economy back on 
its feet. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I 
think you all might remember when

September 21, 2022 
experts claimed that inflation was 
‘‘transitory.’’ It ended up that they 
couldn’t have been more wrong by 
using that word. 
Since President Biden took office, 
Iowans have seen prices rise 13.7 per-
cent. That adds an extra $666 to their 
monthly budget. Couple that with fall-
ing real wages, and Iowans have been 
strapped very thin. 
This combination of rising prices and 
falling real wages has hit rural Iowa 
communities particularly hard. As a 
result, according to a report issued by 
Iowa State University, the disposable 
income of rural Iowans fell 33 percent 
over the past 12 months alone. It is no 
wonder, then, that the high cost of liv-
ing is the number one concern that I 
hear about from Iowans as I travel all 
of our 99 counties. 
However, here in DC—and remember, 
DC is an island surrounded by reality— 
here in this town, the primary concern 
of President Biden and congressional 
Democrats has been enacting their 
very partisan agenda. 
They have refused to work with Re-
publicans on sensible policies to tame 
inflation and provide targeted relief. In 
the process of doing that, they haven’t 
even followed the advice of their own 
brethren. And I will use Larry Sum-
mers as an example, that Harvard pro-
fessor and former Secretary of Treas-
ury. He said, way back in January, be-
fore this President was sworn in, that 
the economy was turned around: Don’t 
spend any more money or you are 
going to have inflation. 
And, immediately, within 60 days of 
being in office, this new President and 
this new Congress passed a $2 trillion 
appropriations bill to feed the fires of 
inflation. 
So instead of taming inflation, they 
rebranded the reckless tax-and-spend-
ing spree that they had pursued for 
more than a year as a bill recently 
passed called the Inflation Reduction 
Act, which I call the ‘‘Inflation En-
hancement Act’’—never mind that out-
side experts uniformly concluded the 
bill’s hodgepodge of the Green New 
Deal and the subsidies that go with 
that program and the tax hikes would 
do nothing to address inflation today. 
Of course, if you want to stop infla-
tion, now caused by excessive govern-
ment spending, the first thing you 
should do is stop spending; or another 
way you can say it—and common sense 
dictates this: When you are in a hole, 
quit digging. 
Instead, Democrats doubled down 
with Big Government spending and 
coupled it with job-killing tax hikes. 
The National Association of Manufac-
turers said they would lose about 
217,000 jobs. Democrats’ policy deci-
sions made even less sense given that, 
only a week before, we learned our 
economy had shrunk for two straight 
quarters, indicating recession. 
And everyone knows, as President 
Obama once said—and this seems to be 
the third term of the Obama Presi-
dency, but this is what he said when he 
was actually President: 
The last thing you want to do is to raise 
taxes in the middle of a recession. 
And yet it was done in that bill in 
August by more than $300 billion. The 
last thing our economy needed was an-
other 
tax-and-spending 
spree, 
but 
Democrats just couldn’t let go of their 
wish list. 
What is more, at the height of hypoc-
risy, Democrats touted the Inflation 
Reduction Act as an example of fiscal 
responsibility. Yet the supposed sav-
ings they claim will result from the 
bill was then immediately dwarfed in 
just 1 day of actions by President 
Biden’s unilateral student loan an-
nouncement, which will cost American 
taxpayers at least $500 billion. And 
some people are saying it could cost up 
to $1 trillion. 
When President Biden announced 
that he was wiping out $10,000 to $20,000 
of student loan debt for people making 
as much as $150,000 or $250,000 for 
households, that likely illegal action 
will send the bill for this student loan 
giveaway to Americans who did not at-
tend college or people who graduated 
from college already paying off their 
college expenses. And at the same 
time, it is going to fuel the fires of in-
flation. 
So much, then, for the lip service 
about deficit reduction and inflation. 
But we now know that that inflation 
was not transitory. It is persistent. 
Iowans are sick and tired of paying the 
price for the failures of this Biden 
economy. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I come 
to the floor today to discuss how con-
sumers are paying more for less reli-
able energy as a result of the policies 
of the Biden administration and con-
gressional Democrats. North Dakotans 
are paying 60 percent more for gasoline 
since January of 2021, and diesel re-
mains at nearly $5 a gallon. 
Prices are high because we have a 
supply problem. Our friends and allies 
in Europe are facing an even worse sup-
ply crisis, and unless the Biden admin-
istration changes its approach, Amer-
ican families and businesses will con-
tinue to face these inflationary pres-
sures. 
Fortunately, the solution is clear. 
More energy supply means consumers 
pay less. More supply is what helps us 
get prices under control, get inflation 
under control, and consumers relief. 
In 2019, the United States was pro-
ducing nearly 13 million barrels of oil a 
day. Today, that production is down at 
about 11.8 million barrels a day. That 
is because the policies of the Demo-
crats in Congress and the Biden admin-
istration include blocking energy pro-
duction on Federal lands, and that is 
curtailing supply. Our vast supply of 
taxpayer-owned oil, gas, and coal re-
sources on Federal lands are a national 
strategic asset. Yet President Biden 
and his ‘‘keep it in the ground’’ allies 
treat our NG reserves as a liability. 
Recent analysis by the Wall Street 
Journal shows that the Biden adminis-
tration leased only 130,000 acres for 
new oil and gas production in the first 
19 months of this administration. Let 
me repeat that number. The Biden ad-
ministration has only leased 130,000 
acres for new oil and gas production in 
its first 19 months. For comparison, 
President Reagan leased 47.6 million 
acres during the same time period. The 
Biden administration, in just under 2 
years, leased 130,000 acres. The Reagan 
administration 
leased 
47.6 
million 
acres during the same amount of time. 
That is the point. We need to take 
the handcuffs off our producers if we 
are going to produce more energy here 
at home. And nobody produces energy 
better, more cost effectively, more de-
pendably, and with better environ-
mental stewardship than America. We 
do the best job of anybody in the world. 
New energy leases are needed to grow 
oil production and supplies for the 
long-term, otherwise production will 
continue to fall, and that means higher 
energy costs for our consumers. 
Instead of defending previously held 
lease sales, the Biden administration is 
relying on litigation from environ-
mental allies to block permits needed 
for energy development. That only fur-
ther increases our reliance on adver-
saries like Russia, Iran, and Venezuela, 
countries with little or no regard for 
environmental stewardship or human 
rights. They are our adversaries. How 
in the world can we put ourselves sub-
ject to their energy production? En-
ergy production is part of national se-
curity. Energy security is national se-
curity. 
Natural gas prices also remain high 
and families are being hit with higher 
utility bills. Electricity prices are up 
nearly 16 percent compared to last 
year. As we approach the winter 
months, natural gas bills are up 33 per-
cent over the same period, and with 
winter coming on, they are going to go 
up more. 
The Biden administration’s policies 
are undermining our energy security, 
and because the cost of energy is built 
into our entire economy, inflation has 
been driven to record heights. Every-
thing you buy has an energy compo-
nent in it. When energy costs go up be-
cause the administration won’t let us 
produce more here at home, it causes 
inflation in everything you buy—every-
thing you buy, not just at the gas sta-
tion but in the grocery store or any-
where else because of the energy com-
ponent. 
Despite these challenges, President 
Biden and congressional Democrats 
doubled down by passing their partisan

tax-and-spend bill that will make it 
more expensive to produce energy in 
the United States. The bill includes a 
new tax on natural gas. That doesn’t 
make energy cheaper; that makes it 
more expensive. The bill includes a new 
tax on natural gas and also makes oil 
and gas production on Federal lands 
more expensive through higher fees and 
royalty rates. So they are driving up 
the cost of energy. 
In addition to levying $739 billion in 
new taxes on hard-working families, 
the bill was loaded with $370 billion in 
Green New Deal spending. Instead of 
tax hikes and wasteful spending, Presi-
dent Biden needs to take the handcuffs 
off our domestic energy production. In-
stead of higher taxes and fees, more 
mandates, and less energy develop-
ment, we need to take the handcuffs off 
our domestic energy producers to lower 
energy costs and help reduce the bur-
den of inflation, which harms every 
American but particularly those low- 
income Americans who are struggling 
with the higher cost of everything from 
putting food on the table to gas at the 
pump, to anything and everything they 
buy. We need to change this policy di-
rection, and it needs to happen now.

The Senator from Wyoming. 
INFLATION 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
come to the floor today to talk about 
the Biden economic crisis that the 
American people are facing every day. 
Last week, Democrats threw a big 
party at the White House; even Holly-
wood celebrities flew in to celebrate. If 
you take a look at what was going on, 
on the split-screen television all across 
the country, they saw Democrats cele-
brating and the stock market col-
lapsing; people’s savings, retirements 
evaporating; Democrats dancing. 
It was the worst day on Wall Street 
since the pandemic, and by the time 
the party at the White House was over, 
$1.6 trillion was erased from the value 
of those who hold American stocks. 
So why did this happen? The reason 
that this happened was because just 
hours earlier the world found out that 
inflation in America went up once 
again. 
Prices people have to pay for things 
are up more than 13 percent since the 
day Joe Biden took office. Costs which 
economists predicted would go down 
last month, actually went up instead. 
Well, the economists made a pre-
diction, but the American people know 
what they are facing every day when 
they go to the grocery store, pay their 
rent, pay their energy bills, try to buy 
back-to-school supplies for their kids. 
Inflation is now going up after the 
Democrats passed a reckless tax-and- 
spending bill. This is nothing to cele-
brate even though they were down at 
the 
White 
House 
celebrating. 
The 
American people aren’t celebrating; 
they are suffering. They are suffering 
the worst inflation in over 40 years. 
Prices have risen faster than wages 
for 17 consecutive months—17 months 
in a row, prices rising faster than 
wages. With each passing month, the 
American people can afford less and 
less. Now people have cut into their 
savings, borrowed money, just to get 
by. 
Credit card debt is climbing. Reports 
across the Nation are more and more 
people are buying on layaway. People 
on fixed incomes cannot keep up; they 
are falling further behind. And it is no 
wonder then that many seniors are de-
laying their retirements. 
Rising costs are hitting our troops. 
Right now, our troops are watching 
their paychecks disappear, melt away. 
According to a recent report, the Army 
is now recommending our troops sign 
up for food stamps. 
The U.S. Army—can you imagine 
such a thing?—is recommending troops 
sign up for food stamps. After the dead-
ly and disgraceful evacuation of Af-
ghanistan, people knew Joe Biden had 
very little respect for our men and 
women in uniform. What we are seeing 
today is a national failure by Joe Biden 
and the Democrats. Our heroes in uni-
form should not have to rely on welfare 
in order for them to serve the Nation. 
Our soldiers should not have to find 
themselves in a battle against Joe 
Biden’s inflation. 
Now, the U.S. Senate still hasn’t 
passed a defense bill this year. We are 
waiting to go. Senator SCHUMER says, 
well, we will do that next month. It 
just shows that Democrats do not 
prioritize our national defense. It al-
ways goes to the bottom of the list— 
leave it for last. Democrats have other 
priorities like their James Taylor con-
cert last week at the White House on 
the lawn. 
Democrats have been too busy paying 
off the climate activists to pay our 
troops. The Senate ought to get to 
work on a defense bill immediately. We 
should ensure that our troops, whether 
they are serving at F.E. Warren Air 
Force Base in Wyoming, Luke Air 
Force Base in Arizona, or Nellis Air 
Force Base in Nevada, or Buckley 
Space Force Base in Colorado, that 
they get a raise so they won’t further 
be hurt by Joe Biden’s inflation. 
Now, many Democrats seem obliv-
ious to the pain and suffering that they 
have caused American families. When 
Joe Biden took office, inflation was es-
sentially nonexistent. A gallon of gas 
was $2.39. In today’s prices, it is almost 
$3.70 a gallon, higher in States like Ne-
vada, Washington State, and others. 
When Joe Biden took office, econo-
mists were predicting an economic 
boom. Now our economy continues to 
shrink, and just in a matter of months, 
Joe Biden took us from recovery to re-
cession. 
And recovery right now is nowhere in 
sight. Consumer confidence is worse 
today 
than 
it 
was 
during 
the 
lockdowns of 2020, hard to believe but 
true. This summer, we saw the lowest 
consumer confidence ever recorded in 
the history of polling for these sorts of 
things. 
Families feel very stressed about the 
future, and prices continue to climb. 
Now, ultimately, this means that we 
are going to have layoffs at a time 
when people are running out of savings. 
A poll last week showed that people 
across the country are cutting back on 
spending on just about everything just 
to keep up, just to avoid falling further 
and further behind. Some are cutting 
back on groceries. Some are growing 
their own, trying to grow their own 
food instead of going to the grocery 
store. 
At the same time, the Federal Re-
serve is getting ready to raise interest 
rates again, maybe as soon as today. 
This year, we have already seen the 
largest rate hikes in 40 years. Rates are 
going higher and higher and higher as 
the Democrat-caused inflation wildfire 
continues to burn. 
There is no end in sight and no relief 
for the pain being caused to American 
families. Mortgage rates have almost 
doubled this year. They are the highest 
they have been since the great reces-
sion, and they are going to go even 
higher. 
At the same time, mortgage applica-
tions have dropped significantly. More 
and more people are giving up on the 
American dream of even owning their 
own home. To make matters worse, it 
doesn’t look like interest rates are 
coming down any time soon. 
You know, it is very easy to cause in-
flation, very difficult to get rid of. Last 
March, Joe Biden caused inflation with 
the stroke of a pen on a bill that every 
Democrat in this body voted for, and 
working families all across the country 
have suffered ever since. 
Interest rate hikes are designed to 
slow down the economy. And yet we 
have an economy that is already 
shrinking, and they want to slow it 
down some more. It shrank for the first 
6 months of this year. That has always 
been the definition of a recession. The 
administration is even trying to rede-
fine recession while we are in the mid-
dle of one because they don’t want to 
own it, but they do. 
The pain and suffering that people 
are being subjected to has no end in 
sight, and the policies of this President 
and the policies of the Democrats who 
have all voted for it—every one of 
them—have brought us inflation and 
recession. 
The wealthy elites that run the 
Democratic Party are doing just fine. 
It is the hard-working men and women 
all across the country who are suf-
fering. Republicans are committed to 
help lower prices for working men and 
women all around America.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4896 
September 21, 2022 
Certainly, in my State of Wyoming, 
it is a major concern, major discussion. 
It is what I hear about. What I heard 
about Friday at our Victoria’s football 
game and the tailgate party is what 
things cost, trying to just stay ahead, 
trying to keep ahead, trying to fall less 
far behind. 
We are committed to getting the 
economy back on track. It is time for 
the Democrats to get their priorities 
straight. We need to pass a defense bill 
to take care of our troops. We need to 
stop the reckless spending and the tax 
hikes. 
These are the policies that have 
caused the cost of everyday items to 
continue to go up. The Democrats need 
to stop strangling American energy. 
That is what is driving up the price, 
not just at the pump but electric bills, 
home heating, natural gas, all of the 
things that the American people need 
and want, energy that is affordable, 
available, and reliable. 
The American people deserve much 
better than what we have been getting 
from the Democrats, and the Demo-
crats—let me point out—are in full 
control of the House, the Senate, and 
the White House. 
It is their policies and their positions 
that brought us 40-year high inflation, 
food going up faster and faster, 13 per-
cent inflation since the day Joe Biden 
and the Democrats took over. It is 
time for a change.

developing country, and the United Nations 
and other intergovernmental organizations 
should not treat the People’s Republic of 
China as such. 
At the end, add the following: 
SEC. 3. CONDITION. 
The advice and consent of the Senate 
under section 1 is subject to the following 
condition: Prior to the Thirty-Fifth Meeting 
of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol, the 
Secretary of State shall transmit to the Sec-
retariat of the Vienna Convention for the 
Protection of the Ozone Layer a proposal to 
amend 
Decision 
I/12E, 
‘‘Clarification 
of 
terms and definitions: developing countries,’’ 
made at the First Meeting of the Parties, to 
remove the People’s Republic of China. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, 
about 4 years ago, I was part of a meet-
ing with several Senators—there were 
about 11 of us—here in the U.S. Capitol 
with the Chinese Ambassador. And in 
the meeting, I had raised a number of 
issues about the lack of reciprocity 
that China has with regard to the 
United States: market access on our 
trade; their ability to invest here but 
we couldn’t invest there; the fact that 
they have all kinds of journalists in 
America and we can’t have journalists 
over there—just across the board on so 
many things—Confucius Institutes in 
American universities, no equivalent in 
Chinese universities. No reciprocity on 
so many topics. 
And I will never forget the response 
of the Chinese Ambassador to the 
United States. With 11 U.S. Senators 
right there, he said: Well, Senator, I 
agree there is a lack of reciprocity in a 
number of areas, but that is because 
China is a developing country. 
China is a developing country. That 
is what he said just 4 years ago. And 
my response was: Mr. Ambassador, 
with all due respect, can you please 
stop using that talking point about 
your country being a developing coun-
try? It is kind of an insult to all of our 
intelligence. And to be honest, you are 
not a developing country. The Amer-
ican people know it; the world knows 
it; and you need to stop telling every-
body and using that as a crutch. 
What does that have to do with the 
amendment that I just called up? 
Well, today, before we vote on the 
Kigali treaty, I have an amendment 
that I am asking all of my colleagues 
here in the Senate to support. I am not 
talking about the merits of the Kigali 
treaty itself. There is an element of 
this treaty that raises a principle that 
is at stake right now that is so impor-
tant with regard to China, the United 
States, and the rest of the world. 
This treaty that we are getting ready 
to vote on continues to classify China 
as a ‘‘developing country.’’ 
Why does that matter? 
Well, as I mentioned, it is a facade. 
China is not a developing country; it is 
the second largest economy in the 
world. It is one of the most industri-
alized countries in the world. It has 
one of the biggest militaries in the 
world. The World Bank even now con-
siders China an upper middle income 
country. 
But what China keeps trying to do in 
international 
organizations 
and 
in 
international treaties is continue to 
get the same benefits as truly devel-
oping countries, such Ghana, Somalia, 
Nigeria, Bangladesh. These are the 
countries that need global assistance, 
not China. 
So my amendment today is very sim-
ple to this treaty. It first says that the 
U.S. Senate concludes: 
The People’s Republic of China is not a de-
veloping country, and the United Nations 
and other intergovernmental organizations 
should not treat the People’s Republic of 
China as such. 
And then my amendment goes one 
step further, and it makes the advice 
and consent of the Senate for this trea-
ty contingent upon the Secretary of 
State of the United States going to the 
U.N. and the Vienna Convention Secre-
tariat to file an amendment to the 
treaty that clarifies that China should 
be taken off the annex that defines it 
as a developing country. 
So we have a declaration—China is 
not a developing country—and then it 
says to the Secretary of State, before 
you get the advice and consent of the 
U.S. Senate, you shall go to the U.N. 
and file an instrument that says China 
should be removed from the list of 
countries to this treaty that are called 
developing countries. 
And, again, this matters. This mat-
ters, for example, on this treaty. 
Why? 
Because in this treaty, the devel-
oping country annex gives those coun-
tries under that annex much longer 
time to implement the treaty, and it 
actually gives them funding from the 
U.N. to implement the treaty. 
Now, where does that funding come 
from? 
Most of it comes from the United 
States. So, in essence, right now, the 
way the treaty is organized, the United 
States gives the U.N. money to help 
implement the treaty, and a lot of that 
money is going to go to China. 
Does anyone in the U.S. Senate think 
that makes sense? Does anyone in 
America think that that makes sense? 
It does not. 
Furthermore, on this treaty and on 
so many other international agree-
ments, whether at the U.N. or other 
places, when you give China more time 
for implementation, particularly as it 
relates to the global environment, all 
you are doing is harming the global en-
vironment. 
China is a developed country. China 
is an industrialized country. The U.S. 
Senate, the international organizations 
where China is a member, need to start 
recognizing this. 
So I am proud to say I worked closely 
with Senator BARRASSO and Senator 
LEE
on this amendment. I actually 
wish it were stronger. 
Senator BARRASSO was here on the 
floor, talking about his amendment. I 
actually think that is the preferred 
way to go, but we couldn’t get agree-
ment in terms of the Barrasso amend-
ment, so I am encouraging all of my 
colleagues to vote on this principle: 
The U.S. Senate, on any international 
agreement or any international treaty, 
should no longer agree to the obvious. 
China is not a developing country; it is 
an 
industrialized 
country, 
and 
we 
should make clear in the Senate and in

international organizations that that 
is the view of the United States, and 
we need to encourage the Secretary of 
State, which is exactly what my 
amendment does, to make sure the 
U.N. and other countries agree with us 
on that. 
I encourage all of my colleagues to 
vote yes on this amendment. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that I be per-
mitted to conclude my comments be-
fore the vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I 
rise today to once again urge my Sen-
ate colleagues to take the bipartisan, 
practical pro-manufacturing step of 
providing advice and consent to ratify-
ing the Kigali Amendment. 
Each of the four previous amend-
ments to this treaty, the Montreal Pro-
tocol, have enjoyed overwhelming bi-
partisan support in the Senate, and 
Kigali should be no different. 
Our companies are clear. They want 
us to approve this treaty so that they 
can maximize their export potential of 
cutting-edge chemicals that they have 
pioneered. They want us to approve the 
treaty. It will generate billions of dol-
lars in economic activity and create 
thousands of jobs here at home in the 
United States. 
They are also clear that if we fail to 
ratify, they stand to lose. They will be 
locked out of export markets in key 
products. American workers will suffer, 
which is why the National Association 
of Manufacturers, the U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce, and impacted industries all 
support the action we are prepared to 
take. 
Now, I have heard the concerns that 
some colleagues have raised about 
China and how it benefits from its anti-
quated status as a ‘‘developing coun-
try’’ under the Montreal Protocol. 
Frankly, it is a fair point to raise, but 
it should have no bearing on whether 
we join Kigali. 
The simple fact is, whether we join 
Kigali or not has no impact on whether 
China is treated as a developing coun-
try—none. On the other hand, ratifying 
Kigali will have a major positive ben-
efit for us because China has doubled 
down on yesterday’s chemicals, and we, 
the United States, lead on all the alter-
natives. Joining Kigali will turn the 
world away from China and its compa-
nies 
and 
towards 
our 
competitive 
strength. It is good for the United 
States and our businesses, and it is bad 
for China. However, I also recognize 
the plain fact that China is no longer a 
developing country, and I agree that it 
should not enjoy advantages under the 
Montreal Protocol that it received be-
cause of decisions made more than 30 
years ago. 
I have been a steadfast champion of 
addressing the challenges China pre-
sents as they are, not as we hope for 
them to be. I led passage of the Stra-
tegic Competition Act and my Taiwan 
Policy Act, which was recently voted 
out of the Foreign Relations Com-
mittee on an overwhelming bipartisan 
basis. So I have no problem acknowl-
edging that China should no longer 
qualify as a developing country, and 
for that reason, I support the Lee-Sul-
livan amendment. 
The Senate’s constitutional role on 
treaties is both unique and vital. What 
we are doing today will directly, posi-
tively—if we adopt ratification—im-
pact 
American 
workers, 
American 
businesses, and American consumers. 
It will meet our challenge against 
China. It will create greater security at 
home. It will create great prosperity. 
There are few things that we do in the 
Senate that can improve our economy, 
create jobs, and meet the challenge of 
China in this one dimension. 
For all of those reasons, I urge my 
colleagues to support providing advice 
and consent for the Kigali Amendment 
after the Sullivan amendment is con-
sidered. 
f 
TREATY DOCUMENT NO. 117–1 
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, as the 
current ranking member of the U.S. 
Senate Committee on Environment and 
Public 
Works—EPW—Committee, 
I 
submit these comments to provide the 
Senate with additional information on 
the existing domestic authority to 
phasedown the production and con-
sumption of hydrofluorocarbons, HFCs. 
The EPW Committee has jurisdiction 
over air pollution, and in the 116th 
Congress, managed the development of 
the domestic authority to implement 
the Kigali Amendment, See 218 Cong. 
Rec. S7926, daily ed. Dec. 21. 2020, state-
ment of then-EPW Chairman JOHN 
BARRASSO, then-EPW Ranking Member 
TOM CARPER, and Sen. JOHN KENNEDY). 
As the Senate Committee on Foreign 
Relations clearly states in Senate Ex-
ecutive Report 117–2, no further legisla-
tion is required to implement the 
Kigali Amendment and the Amend-
ment is not self-executing. New author-
ity is not granted to the U.S. Environ-
mental 
Protection 
Agency—EPA— 
through ratification. 
In section 103 in division S of the 
Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, 
the American Innovation and Manufac-
turing—AIM—Act of 2020, P.L. 116–260, 
was enacted. That law established a 
new, national program administered by 
the EPA to phasedown the production 
and consumption of certain HFC sub-
stances due to their significant global 
warming potential. Specifically, the 
AIM Act requires the EPA to imple-
ment an 85 percent phasedown of the 
production and consumption of regu-
lated HFC substances, requiring levels 
to reach approximately 15 percent of 
their 2011–2013 average annual levels by 
2036. 
The AIM Act provides all the nec-
essary authorities to phasedown the 
production and consumption of HFCs 
in the United States in line with U.S. 
obligations under the Kigali Amend-
ment and is already being implemented 
by the EPA. In October 2021, the EPA 
issued a final rule establishing the al-
lowance allocation for 2022 and 2023, 
along with establishing a trading pro-
gram for HFCs. 86 Fed. Reg. 55,116, Oct. 
5, 2021. As stated in that final agency 
action, the Kigali Amendment and the 
AIM Act have ‘‘a nearly identical list 
of HFCs to be phased down following 
the same schedule,’’ Id. at 55,124. The 
EPA is currently developing regula-
tions to update allowance allocations 
and the trading program for 2024 and 
later years. 
I thank my colleagues at the U.S. 
Senate committee on Foreign Rela-
tions for providing a clear Congres-
sional statement that no new legisla-
tion is required and that the Kigali 
Amendment is not self-executing. As 
Congress has already enacted the re-
quired domestic implementing legisla-
tion, I support ratification. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. I yield the floor.

TREATY DOCUMENT NO. 117–1 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, this is 
a very good day. We have just passed 
the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal 
Protocol on a strong bipartisan basis. 
This is a win-win-win: win for U.S. 
jobs, win for U.S. investment, and win 
for U.S. leadership in the fight against 
climate change. 
We have talked a lot about how this 
amendment will help U.S. businesses, 
U.S. jobs, and U.S. competitiveness 
overseas, but let’s talk about how im-
portant this amendment will be for 
protecting our planet. 
Ratifying the Kigali Amendment, 
along with passing the Inflation Reduc-
tion Act, is the strongest one-two 
punch against climate change any Con-
gress has ever undertaken. 
Let me say that again: Ratifying the 
Kigali Amendment, along with passing 
the Inflation Reduction Act, is the 
strongest one-two punch against cli-
mate change any Congress has ever 
taken. 
In fact—amazing statistic, folks— 
people don’t pay attention to this one, 
but it is vital. Experts say that phasing 
out our use of HFCs will help prevent 
up to half a degree Celsius of warming 
by the end of the century. 
That is worth repeating as well. Ex-
perts say that phasing out our use of 
HFCs will help prevent up to half a de-
gree Celsius of warming by the end of 
the century. 
It is an easily overlooked victory, 
but a massive one, all coming from 
eliminating this family of dangerous 
chemicals, which are a thousand times 
more deadly per molecule than carbon 
dioxide. 
And on top of it all, ratifying this 
amendment will give U.S. businesses a 
huge leg up. It will open exports to new 
international markets, generate tens of 
billions in new investments and help 
create tens of thousands of good-paying 
jobs, and we will get a much needed 
edge against Chinese businesses that 
still lag behind in developing viable 
HFC alternatives. 
Under Kigali, our exports will in-
crease while China will lose out. So, 
once 
again, 
ratifying 
the 
Kigali 
Amendment is a win-win-win: a win for 
U.S. jobs, a win for U.S. investment, 
and, most of all, a win for our global 
campaign to defeat the climate crisis 
and preserve our planet for future gen-
erations. 
I want to thank my colleague from 
Delaware who has been such a per-
sistent advocate on this legislation. 
And there are so many others—the 
Senators from New Mexico and Hawaii 
and Delaware—who have worked so 
hard on it as well. I thank them for 
their steadfastness. The globe, our 
globe, is rejoicing today because of this 
legislation. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I want 
to thank our leader for his leadership. 
None of this would have happened 
without your leadership. I want to 
thank your staff. 
I want to thank the relative respec-
tive staffs on our side here and the 
Senators especially on the Environ-
ment and Public Works Committee. 
I want to especially thank our friend 
JOHN NEELY KENNEDY from Louisiana, 
who has been a great partner, and his 
staff and other folks on the other side 
of the aisle. 
My mother used to say to my sister 
and me when we were kids, she would 
say that things happen in threes. I re-
member she would say things happen 
in threes, and given what the leader 
just said, I am thinking about threes 
and especially with respect to making 
sure that this planet is going to be 
around for our children and grand-
children. 
But if you go back to the bipartisan 
infrastructure bill signed into law 
roughly 10 months ago by the Presi-
dent, we did a whole lot there, you will

recall, with respect to roads, highways, 
bridges, water, wastewater, water in-
frastructure, flood control. But that 
legislation had the largest—at that 
point the largest climate title that we 
had ever put in a bill of any con-
sequence here in the U.S. Senate. That 
is No. 1. 
No. 2 would be the IRA, the Inflation 
Reduction Act, that was signed into 
law just last month by the President 
and championed by any number of 
folks, including our colleague from 
West Virginia, JOE MANCHIN. I want to 
thank him and the majority leader for 
their good work. That was No. 2 be-
cause the investments, the clean en-
ergy investments we make in the Infla-
tion Reduction Act, are just extraor-
dinary—extraordinary. 
Then, today, to pass the Kigali 
Amendment 
to 
the 
Montreal 
Pro-
tocol—people might be wondering, who 
are watching, and say: What in the 
world is that? And I will just walk you 
back in time. 
People might remember that I was a 
naval flight officer in the Vietnam war, 
and near the end of the Vietnam war, 
maybe after I had moved to Delaware, 
I remember hearing something about 
speculation about a hole in the ozone 
and there might be a hole in the ozone. 
At first, people dismissed it. I dis-
missed it. But over time, the concerns 
persisted, and the hole in the ozone 
grew and grew. 
Somewhere along about 1985, some 
updated scientific information, evi-
dence, emerged that said there is a hole 
in the ozone, and it is big, and it is get-
ting bigger. 
Our President at the time, as I recall, 
was not a Democrat; he was a Repub-
lican—Ronald Reagan. Under his lead-
ership, we as a nation joined in the 
Montreal Protocol. It was finalized in 
1987, where we actually say that what 
is happening here is exactly clear, and 
what that is, is there is a hole in the 
ozone. It was being created by mate-
rials that are in our air-conditioners or 
refrigerators and our coolers. We call 
them 
refrigerants, 
and 
when 
they 
leaked out of the air-conditioners, re-
frigerators, and coolers, they actually 
created the hole in the ozone. 
So the question is, Do we have to 
give up our refrigerators, our air-condi-
tioners, our coolers, our freezers? Do 
we have to give those up in order to 
take care and address the hole in the 
ozone? As it turns out, we did not, but 
what we had to do was replace some-
thing 
called 
CFCs, 
chlorofluorocarbons, which were refrig-
erants at the time and contributed to 
the hole in the ozone. What we had to 
do was replace those CFCs with some-
thing new. Science and the scientists 
came up with that something new. 
What they came up with was not CFC 
plus 2; they came up with HFCs, 
hydrofluorocarbons. 
What I know about chemistry you 
can fit on a fairly small thumbnail, but 
HFCs came along, and, guess what, the 
hole in the ozone started getting small-
er. We stayed cool. The air-condi-
tioners worked, freezers worked, refrig-
erators worked, and the hole in the 
ozone started getting cooler. 
What didn’t get cooler was our planet 
because HFCs, as Senator SCHUMER 
suggested, are about 1,000 times worse 
than carbon dioxide with respect to 
global warming. We finally have real-
ized that, and the question is, Can we 
do anything about it? If so, can we do 
it to make sure we stay cool or cold, if 
you will, and at the same time address 
climate change? 
Some people say: You know, we can’t 
do good things for this planet or we 
can’t clean the air, clean the water, ad-
dress the climate change, and create 
jobs and economic opportunity. But, as 
Senator SCHUMER
suggested, that is 
just not true. This is sort of like hav-
ing our cake and eating it, too, because 
we can create jobs. 
A lot of them we are talking about 
creating with the phasedown of HFCs 
and for the next 15 years talking about 
creating literally tens of thousands of 
jobs not in some other country but 
here. We are talking about creating 
these jobs using technology developed 
here, and we are talking about the abil-
ity to export this technology and sell 
products using this technology all over 
the place. 
I forget exactly what the economic 
value is from these activities, but it is 
in the tens of billions of dollars here, 
with American technology, created by 
American workers. Who wouldn’t be for 
that? Who wouldn’t be for that? 
Some of our Republican colleagues 
offered an amendment today. Senator 
LEE and, I think, Senator SULLIVAN 
joined together on an amendment. I 
think most of us voted for that, and it 
has been adopted and added to this 
package. 
The other thing I would mention is 
that about a month ago, you may re-
call, we stayed up all night during a 
vote-arama, working on the reconcili-
ation legislation that led to the IRA, 
the Inflation Reduction Act. 
I remember the next day going home. 
I was just dog-tired. I went home on 
the train and got off the train, and be-
fore I went home, I drove to Wawa, 
which is a convenience store. We love 
Wawa. They are all up and down the 
east coast, especially in Delaware. I 
stopped at Wawa to get a cup of coffee. 
I got a small cup of coffee and went to 
the cash register, the cashier, to pay 
for it, and the lady at the cash register 
said: Your money is no good here. 
I said: No, no. I want to pay. I want 
to pay for it. 
She said: No, no. I am mindful of 
what you have been up all night doing. 
Your money is no good here. 
I said: Could I get a larger cup of cof-
fee? 
She said: No, but your money is no 
good here. 
She also went to say—she said: I have 
a son. I have a daughter. I want to 
make sure they grow up on a planet 
that is fit to grow up on and that they 
can grow old on. 
I think that is a sentiment that al-
most any father or mother or grand-
father or grandparent would feel and 
have. I would just say to them today: I 
know sometimes you look at what is 
going on here and our inability to work 
together. We have come together. We 
have come together on something that 
is extremely important for us, my gen-
eration, but even more important, for 
those who follow us. 
Bipartisan solutions are lasting solu-
tions. This is a good bipartisan solu-
tion, and for everybody who has been a 
part of this, I want to thank you. I 
want to convey our thanks as well to 
the President and his administration 
for their help in getting this done. 
This is a day, as my colleague from 
Delaware, Congresswoman LISA BLUNT 
ROCHESTER, would say—she would say: 
This is a day the Lord hath made. Let 
us rejoice and be glad in it. 
Amen. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 1950 
Mr. 
LANKFORD. 
Mr. 
President, 
while we are standing here right now in 
Washington, DC, in the middle of an 
afternoon, protests are happening all 
over Iran right now. 
The latest news reports coming out 
from social media and the very limited 
media that can get out of Iran—mas-
sive protesters are in the streets of 20 
different cities in Iran right now. The 
latest count is nine people have been 
killed in those protests by Iranian 
forces trying to be able to shut down 
the protests that are now breaking out 
all over the country—including, by the 
way, protests in Tehran. 
What is going on? This has been a 
simmering issue for a long time in 
Iran. As I have stated several times on 
this floor and in committee hearings, 
our opposition with Iran is not with 
the Iranian people. The Iranian people 
live in oppression underneath the Ira-
nian regime, which pushes their thumb 
down on them and limits their progress 
in the world and in their own country. 
The spark of this latest group of pro-
tests that are happening in the streets 
all over Iran is a young lady who was 
murdered in police custody in Iran 
named Mahsa Amini. 
Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Iranian 
woman, died in custody because she 
broke Iran’s hijab law. In other words, 
she wasn’t wearing her head covering, 
and so—brace yourself—the morality 
police arrested her. The morality po-
lice in Iran detained her, where she was 
apparently beaten to death while she 
was in prison. Now, the police and the 
regime have come out and said she had 
sudden heart failure, but with multiple 
injuries around her head, that is not 
sudden heart failure. 
The nation—once again—of Iran is 
rising up to say: This has to stop. 
Americans would be surprised at the 
number of social media posts that are 
getting out of Iran right now, where

September 21, 2022 
large crowds—large crowds—are gath-
ering in cities, tearing down the pic-
tures of the Ayatollah, and chanting in 
the streets of Tehran, ‘‘Death to the 
dictator.’’ 
I have friends in Iran who have actu-
ally sent me some of the social media 
posts to be able to show me that this is 
what the street looks like today. This 
is breaking out across Iran. 
Now, what is interesting is that, at 
the same time, the President of Iran 
has been allowed to be able to come 
into the United States to be at the U.N. 
General Assembly to be able to speak 
out for the regime’s benefit to the rest 
of the world. It will be a remarkable 
side-by-side of what is happening in 
Iran on the streets right now and the 
Iranian leadership at the U.N. General 
Assembly. 
At this same moment as well, Iran is 
working with Russia and has delivered 
hundreds of unmanned aerial vehicles 
that are weaponized, little kamikaze 
drones that are literally taking out 
Ukrainian artillery right now in the 
field in Ukraine. The Iranians haven’t 
just supplied these weaponized drones 
to Russia; they have brought Russian 
leaders into Iran to be able to train 
them on how to be able to attack 
Ukraine with these weapons. 
Right now as well, the Russians are 
calling up additional reservists to be 
able to fight the Ukrainians and to be 
able to continue to take the fight to 
them. Protests are also erupting in 
Russia right now from Russian moms 
who are furious that their husbands 
and their sons are being called up to be 
able to fight in Ukraine to replace the 
thousands of casualties that Russia has 
suffered in Ukraine. 
Now, why do I connect the dots in all 
of these—what is happening in Iran on 
the streets, what is happening on the 
streets in Russia, and what is hap-
pening right now in Ukraine? Because 
in the middle of that moment inter-
nationally that is happening, the U.S. 
Government has partnered with Rus-
sian diplomats to negotiate with Iran a 
restart of the nuclear deal with them. 
I can’t make this up. So the United 
States is using Russia as its proxy to 
negotiate with Iran to be able to re-
start a nuclear negotiation with them. 
Listen, the JCPOA, this nuclear deal, 
as it is commonly called, when it was 
put in place in 2015, was then set aside 
to say: It is not accomplishing its pur-
poses. 
In 2015, when it was put in place— 
let’s just review real quick what hap-
pened in the days after that. 
Planes full—literal planes full—of 
pallets loaded with cash were sent to 
Iran as soon as this deal was signed. It 
was a government suddenly flush with 
cash. How did that regime use that 
cash? They bought munitions to be 
able to fight against Americans in Iraq. 
From 2015 to 2017—that period imme-
diately after the JCPOA was signed 
and planes full of cash were sent to 
them—munitions fired against Amer-
ican troops in Iraq increased 341 per-
cent. During that same time period, 
terrorist incidents increased 183 per-
cent. There were 58 incidents involving 
Iranian vessels in the gulf that put 
American troops at risk. Iran used its 
money not to be able to help the Ira-
nian people but to attack us and to at-
tack our allies. 
Our Nation withdrew from this nu-
clear negotiation 4 years ago. After 
that happened, Iran’s exports of crude 
oil declined by more than 2 million 
barrels a day, cutting off a major sup-
ply of money into the regime. Iran’s 
defense budget was then cut 28 percent 
because of those revenue shortfalls. 
Iran’s currency lost 70 percent of its 
value as the pressure was applied to 
Iran to actually join into nations 
around the world, to actually become a 
nation like the rest of the world. 
I am bringing this into the Senate 
today. It is an issue that I have 
brought multiple times. We should 
have ongoing dialogue with Iran. They 
are ambitious to become a nuclear 
weapons-capable nation. They are the 
single largest State sponsor of ter-
rorism in the world. They are the de-
stabilizing force in all of the Middle 
East. Every nation in that entire re-
gion has to prepare themselves for an 
inevitable, erratic, irrational attack 
from Iran; and every nation fears the 
day that they gain a nuclear-capable 
weapon. 
But the gaps in the nuclear negotia-
tions are large. Let me list some of 
them. The nuclear negotiation excludes 
any conversation about their terrorist 
activities. It is just simply not limiting 
their terrorist activities, just limiting 
their nuclear capability. They are 
building long-range weapons capable of 
carrying a nuclear weapon. Why would 
you need to build a long-range heavy 
missile unless you are carrying a nu-
clear tip? The two are connected—their 
terrorist activities, their missile ambi-
tions, and their nuclear ambitions. We 
should connect those in all of our rela-
tionships. 
My amendment in my sense of the 
Senate that I bring is very clear today. 
One is to acknowledge what we all 
know is actually happening. The sec-
ond is to say, we can’t have any kind of 
sanctions relief, especially preemp-
tively in negotiations on lifting energy 
petroleum sales coming out of Iran. 
The next section of it, the third section 
of it, is simply not releasing any of the 
sanctions on the Iranian Revolutionary 
Guard Corps. They are the core of the 
terrorist activities in the area. They 
are the trainers for those who actually 
attacked Americans in Iraq. We should 
not lift sanctions on them. The fourth 
on this is not providing relief to the fi-
nancial institutions in Iran so they 
can’t continue to extend their terrorist 
activities and their financial activities 
behind the scenes. The goal of this is to 
be able to put pressure on the regime 
but to protect the Iranian people as 
much as possible. 
The final statement that is in this 
sense of the Senate is to affirm our 
long-term friendship with the people of 
Iran and our understanding that they 
are living under the thumb of this re-
gime. 
My friend that I had mentioned be-
fore who is from Iran has reached out 
to me in the last 24 hours with this 
simple question. The Iranian people are 
on the streets, trying to gain their 
freedom, trying to be able to speak and 
live their faith as they choose to. And 
here is this question: What are the 
Americans going to do to stand with 
us? That is a fair question for this 
body. 
The Iranian people who are begging 
for their own freedom do not want the 
American response to be sending cash 
to the regime so they can oppress their 
people more or lifting the sanctions at 
this moment so that the regime can 
continue to advance its terrorist ac-
tivities or just disengaging from its 
missile ambitions that destabilizes the 
region or to continue to be able to use 
Russia as a proxy for the United States 
of America while Russia is literally 
using Iranian drones to attack the 
Ukrainians. 
Let’s speak with a clear voice to the 
Iranian people on the streets. They 
want to hear the United States say: We 
stand with your passion for freedom, 
and not: We stand with the regime in 
what they are trying to do to you. 
So saying all that: As if in legislative 
session, I ask unanimous consent that 
the Committee on Banking, Housing, 
and Urban Affairs be discharged from 
further consideration of S. 1950 and the 
Senate proceed to its immediate con-
sideration; I ask further that the bill 
be considered read a third time and 
passed and that the motion to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon 
the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Connecticut. 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, reserv-
ing the right to object. I have such re-
spect for my colleague from Oklahoma. 
We are often on the same side of issues 
related to matters of national security 
and the Middle East, but I disagree 
with his analysis that he has presented 
here today. Let me make just a remark 
or two about his immediate request 
and then make a few remarks about 
the broader work to try to protect the 
world from a nuclear weapons-armed 
Iran. 
First, as I understand it—and I just 
had a few days to take a look at the 
underlying legislation—it would sig-
nificantly remove the administration’s 
discretion to waive sanctions or to 
enter into certain oil sales or authorize 
business with Iranian financial institu-
tions in that only a treaty entered into 
by the United States would provide 
that authority to the administration. 
I think that is generally bad policy. 
We can imagine a whole set of diplo-
matic engagements with any nation, 
including Iran, in which an executive 
may wish to toggle sanctions or li-
censes in order to provoke some behav-
ior beneficial to the United States.

S4901 
September 21, 2022 
That is, in fact, why we regularly build 
waivers into our sanctions statutes. So 
to suggest that on Iran policy, the 
President is going to have no ability to 
impact sanctions or licenses until a 
treaty is entered into ties the adminis-
tration’s hands—both Republican and 
Democratic administrations—in a way 
that I simply don’t think is helpful. 
I understand my friend’s argument. 
He is not a supporter of the JCPOA, 
and he does not desire for the United 
States to enter back into a nuclear 
agreement with Iran. And at the heart 
of this request is the essence of Presi-
dent Trump’s Iran policy—the idea 
that if we just keep hammering Iran 
with sanctions that either their behav-
ior will get better or they will at some 
point choose to come to the table and 
do a comprehensive deal—the nuclear 
program, their ballistic missile pro-
gram, their support for terrorism. 
Now, I think that was a credible ar-
gument back during the Obama admin-
istration. Many people said Obama 
shouldn’t give Iran anything until Iran 
comes to the table on everything. 
This Congress went a different way. 
We ended up taking a vote that, by our 
rules, allowed for the nuclear agree-
ment to go forward. But we now have 
the benefit of the opposition’s argu-
ment to the JCPOA having been tested 
for 4 years. Trump basically took that 
philosophy—keep 
sanctioning 
Iran; 
don’t worry about the fact that it is 
unilateral, and eventually Iran will 
come to the table on everything. He 
tested that for 4 years, and it was an 
unmitigated disaster—an unmitigated 
disaster. Not only did Iran not come to 
the table on everything, they came to 
the table on nothing. Their behavior in 
the region got much worse and much 
more adversarial to U.S. interests. 
Just look at the reality on the 
ground in a place like Lebanon or 
Yemen or Iraq or Syria. At the end of 
Trump’s term, did Iran have more or 
less influence in those places? Unques-
tionably more. More integrated with 
the Houthis—by the end of Trump’s 
term, they were in charge of the Leba-
nese government. There was less sepa-
ration between the Iraqi power struc-
ture and Tehran. 
At the end of that 4-year period of 
time, testing maximum pressure, Iran 
was more deeply involved with its 
proxies than ever before. They were not 
negotiating with the United States on 
any of the conditions that the Trump 
administration laid down for us, and 
they were shooting at us. 
There was not a single attack on U.S. 
servicemembers 
by 
Iranian 
proxies 
while the United States was in the 
JCPOA. Let me say it again: Not a sin-
gle attack on U.S. servicemembers by 
Iranian proxies when the United States 
was in the JCPOA. They occur with 
regularity today. Attacks against U.S. 
forces in housing and on bases in Iraq 
and Syria restarted once we withdrew 
from the deal. In this year alone, there 
have been attacks in February, March, 
April, May, June, July, and August. 
And so, I am not sure why we have to 
do a lot of guessing now as to whether 
we are better off with or without a nu-
clear agreement with Iran, because 
here’s what we got for maximum pres-
sure: American troops under fire, more 
support for proxies, no hopes of nego-
tiation, and—the icing on the cake—an 
Iranian nuclear program that is now 
weeks away from having enough fissile 
material to produce a nuclear weapon. 
Compare that with a year away during 
the time of the agreement. 
So we tested this theory that we just 
hit them with sanctions, hit them with 
sanctions, and, eventually, they capit-
ulate. It didn’t work by, I think, all ob-
jective measures. It didn’t work. And 
so it makes sense that the Biden ad-
ministration wants to engage and try 
to put back together a deal that was 
good for the United States and our al-
lies. 
And, lastly, I will say this. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma is right. The Ira-
nians are bad people. You can just see 
what they are doing right now in the 
streets of Tehran in brutally repressing 
another wave of protests. Listen to 
what the President said on TV just this 
week—denying the Holocaust. These 
are our adversaries. This is an enemy. 
But all throughout American history, 
we have understood there are times 
when it makes sense to sit down across 
the table with your enemy and adver-
sary and engage in diplomatic con-
versation that is good for you and good 
for the world. It is true that if Iran was 
further away from a nuclear weapon, it 
would be good for us and it would be 
good for other countries in the world, 
including Russia, which is why Russia 
is sometimes part of these negotia-
tions. But I don’t know that because 
something is good for everybody, it 
shouldn’t be acceptable to the U.S. 
Congress. 
And so I am going to object to this 
request because I believe that the 
JCPOA is the right thing for the secu-
rity of this Nation; because I believe in 
diplomacy even with your adversaries; 
because I think we have tested the 
proposition that maximum pressure 
will work better than a nuclear agree-
ment, and we now know the results; 
and I also believe that some of the de-
tails of this resolution would ulti-
mately bind the hands of American 
Presidents in a way that, you know, 
probably isn’t good precedent for the 
long-term security of the Nation. 
So, again, I think my colleague 
comes to the floor with good faith ob-
jections and longstanding objections. I 
come down in a different place, and for 
that reason, I would object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I ap-
preciate my colleague. We have a lot of 
agreement in areas in Lebanon and 
other areas in the region that we work 
diligently together to be able to re-
solve—very, very difficult areas in this 
region. 
But I do want to say: Facts are stub-
born things. When my colleague makes 
a statement that we can see what hap-
pens during the time of the JCPOA and 
we can see what happens during the 
time of sanctions, I am welcome to be 
able to look at those facts. During the 
time of the JCPOA, as I mentioned be-
fore, from 2015 to 2017, munitions fired 
against American troops in Iraq in-
creased 341 percent. Many of those mu-
nitions were Iranian-provided. So to be 
able to say that there were no attacks 
on Americans during the JCPOA is just 
factually not correct. 
I can take you to a multitude of 
members of the U.S. military that will 
speak specifically of munitions that 
were fired on them and all kinds of im-
provised explosive devices created by 
the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps 
and shipped into Iraq to be able to at-
tack them specifically during that 
time period. So it is not factually cor-
rect there were no attacks on Ameri-
cans during the time of the JCPOA. In 
fact, all the folks that look at these 
issues saw that terrorism increased 183 
percent during that time period. 
During the time of the sanctions, 
Iran suffered real consequences in their 
economy, including a dramatic drop in 
their own defense spending by 28 per-
cent during that time period. I received 
a personal outreach from an individual 
who is a leader in Lebanon, who my 
colleague and I both know well, who 
reached out to me personally and said 
whatever the United States is doing 
right now to cut off funding to Iran, 
keep doing it because it is also cutting 
off funding to Hezbollah and to Leb-
anon. They are not getting their pay-
checks right now, and that is helping 
the stability of our government. 
So there was a real effect during that 
time period. We can discuss strategic 
aspects of which one is more effective, 
the agreement or the heavier sanc-
tions, but we can’t just ignore it and 
say there was no benefit during that 
time period in the last several years on 
the pressure that was put on Iran dur-
ing this time period. 
The fact still remains, the people of 
Iran are asking the question. They are 
on the streets chanting for freedom. 
What is the Senate going to do to stand 
with them? And, currently, it is noth-
ing. I would like for it to be something, 
to stand with the people of Iran as they 
speak out against the repressive re-
gime that they are under the thumb of. 
I yield the floor.

DISCLOSE ACT 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I 
am here today as we close in on the 
vote on the DISCLOSE Act scheduled 
for tomorrow to urge my colleagues to 
vote yes on that measure. I have intro-
duced the DISCLOSE Act in every Con-
gress since Leader SCHUMER first un-
veiled it in 2010 on the heels of the 
wretched Citizens United decision. 
Every Congress, just about every 
time I have set foot in Washington, I 
have sounded the alarm on the ever- 
growing tsunami of slime that Citizens 
United unleashed into our elections. I 
rise once more today to urge this 
Chamber to end the flood of dark 
money drowning our democracy. 
This is not inevitable. As late as 2006, 
the amount of dark money sloshing 
around in our elections was only $5 
million. In 2020, it had crossed the bil-
lion-dollar threshold. Big special inter-
ests don’t spend a billion dollars with-
out expecting return on investment, 
and that has damaged our democracy. 
Voting to clean up that mess pre-
sents clear choices: whether or not bil-
lionaires and big corporations can pur-
chase influence in secret, whether or 
not Americans deserve to know who is 
buying that influence, whether or not 
corruption has a place in our American 
democracy. 
Twelve years after Citizens United, 
the evidence is in. Dark money powers 
up corporations and megadonors to 
pump billions into phony front groups. 
Those groups, often with soothing 
names like People for Puppies and 
Prosperity, then spew bile and slime 
into our elections. We often can’t know 
exactly who paid for that bile and 
slime, but when corporations and the 
ultrarich keep getting what they want 
from a dark money-funded Congress, 
well, you see that over and over and 
over again; and Americans’ suspicions 
grow. Their gut tells them the corpora-
tions and billionaires are behind the 
phony ads in an effort to rig our polit-
ical system. 
And Americans’ instincts are right. 
Academic studies show that economic 
elites and business interests command 
huge influence in government policy 
while regular people have statistically 
little or none. Studies also show that 
politicians elected to Federal office 
with the support of dark money are 
more likely to support legislation 
aligned with big corporate interests. 
Regardless of what the American peo-
ple want, the big donor interests win 
time after time. 
Dark money isn’t limited to elections 
either. I have come to the floor now 18 
times to expose a decades-long, right-
wing scheme to capture the Federal ju-
diciary and its crown jewel, our Su-
preme Court. This scheme included a 
$580 million secretive campaign of dark 
money and phony front groups to pack 
the courts with judges selected to 
green-light 
donor-friendly 
policies, 
running multimillion-dollar ad cam-
paigns to keep the confirmations of 
those judges and Justices on track. 
Now, the result is the Court that 
dark money built is delivering big for 
its donor puppeteers. In a matter of 
days, the FedSoc Six on the Supreme 
Court overturned Roe v. Wade, manu-
factured new polluter-friendly legal 
doctrines, and threw out centuries-old 
gun safety regulations—all things big 
donors wanted; all things majorities of 
Americans did not want. What is more, 
one rightwing donor just dumped $1.6 
billion to supercharge the dark money 
operation that captured the Court and 
cement that dark money network’s 
hold over the Federal judiciary. And 
guess what. We wouldn’t know who 
that donor is if someone hadn’t tipped 
off the press—ProPublica and the New 
York Times. Think about that. We 
only know this because we get occa-
sional 
little 
glimpses 
of 
these 
megadonors’ 
covert 
schemes. 
That 
means this is only the tip of the ice-
berg. And where that $1.6 billion goes 
on its way out into our political sys-
tem will be obscured in dark money 
channels. 
No wonder Americans’ trust in the 
government is cratering. Fifty-eight 
percent of voters say our government 
needs major reforms or a complete 
overhaul. Just a quarter of Americans 
say they have confidence in the Su-
preme Court. That is down 11 percent 
just from last year. Americans know 
something is deeply amiss in our de-
mocracy. 
Mr. President, I believe to restore 
trust in government, we need to flush 
dark money out of government. Year 
after 
year, 
poll 
after 
poll, 
over-
whelming majorities of Americans say: 
money in politics and wealthy political 
donors are the root of Washington’s 
dysfunction. Election cycle after elec-
tion cycle, even during COVID, voters 
listed political corruption among their 
most important issues. Americans no 
longer trust that their voices matter 
here, not as much as the dark money 
voices of big corporations and billion-
aires. And it is time to listen to them. 
It is time to rid our system of the cor-
rupting influence of unlimited dark 
money. 
Even the Citizens United Justices 
recognized 
that 
unlimited 
political 
spending without transparency would 
corrupt. Even the Justices who opened 
the floodgates of unlimited political 
spending knew that if it was not trans-
parent, it would corrupt. They just 
wouldn’t do anything about it. 
The DISCLOSE Act hinges on a very 
simple idea: that Americans deserve to 
know who is spending to influence 
their vote. If you agree with that sim-
ple idea, vote for the DISCLOSE Act. If 
you believe that corporations and bil-
lionaires shouldn’t hide behind phony 
front groups while spending gobs of 
money on elections, you should vote 
for the DISCLOSE Act. If you oppose 
corruption, you should vote for the 
DISCLOSE Act. It is time for every 
Member of this body to go on record 
about this poison in our system. And 
with any luck, with 10 Republicans 
joining us, we can return to a Congress 
that serves America again, and Ameri-
cans deserve that. 
I yield the floor to my distinguished 
colleague, Senator MERKLEY. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, when 
I was in grade school, I had basic civics 
education. We learned about the fact 
that the vision of America was based 
on individuals standing up for their 
ideas in the public square. They could 
say: Here is what I think should take 
us forward, and here are the arguments 
behind it. 
And someone else could say: Not so 
quick. I don’t think that is the right 
path. We should do something else. 
But in the course of this debate, 
those people gathered in the square 
could decide which way to go, partly 
based on whether they admired the 
thinking and the ideas being presented 
by the individuals, perhaps also what 
they knew about the individuals who 
were making those comments. But this 
is a basic competition of ideas freely 
expressed by members of the commu-
nity and debated openly. 
Well, I thought that was a beautiful 
thing; and it really goes to the notion 
of freedom of speech and the power 
that flows up from the people because 
it is the people gathered and discussing 
ideas who are making decisions. And in 
a republic, like our Republic, those de-
cisions also involved whom you vote 
for because of that set of ideas; and 
that person is sent to a State legisla-
ture or the House of Representatives or 
the U.S. Senate to fight for those ideas. 
Isn’t that a beautiful concept of com-
plete transparent debate? 
You know who else agreed with this 
idea who is no longer with us? Antonin 
Scalia. Now, I don’t know that I have 
ever quoted Antonin Scalia before, 
former Supreme Court Justice who 
passed away a few years ago. He had 
this to say about disclosure. He said: 
Requiring people to stand up in public for 
their political acts fosters civic courage, 
without which democracy is doomed. 
And then he continued: 
For my part, I do not look forward to a so-
ciety which, thanks to the Supreme Court, 
[on which he sat] campaigns anonymously 
. . . hidden from public scrutiny and pro-
tected from the accountability of criticism. 
This [he said] does not resemble the Home of 
the Brave. 
So here is a very conservative Jus-
tice saying that, without transparency, 
without public accountability, democ-
racy is doomed.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4903 
September 21, 2022 
I love the revolutionary idea that 
flows up from the people or, as Abra-
ham Lincoln put it, that we are of the 
people, by the people, for the people. 
Seven weeks from now, Americans 
are going to go to the polls, and they 
are going to cast their vote on initia-
tives and on individuals running for of-
fice based on what they have heard. 
And here is the challenge. A lot of 
what they have heard is not about peo-
ple standing up in public with the cour-
age of their convictions but about se-
cret campaign spending where there is 
no accountability—the exact kind of 
influence that Antonin Scalia said 
dooms our democracy. 
Citizens United, the decision in 2010, 
is something we talk about quite a bit. 
What it basically said is that if you 
don’t give money directly to a can-
didate but instead run a campaign on 
their behalf, you can spend as much as 
you want. So unlimited spending—un-
limited. This created super PACs that 
can collect unlimited spending from 
corporations, unlimited spending from 
individuals, and run unlimited cam-
paigns on behalf of someone—super 
PACs. 
But here is the thing, when they 
made that decision, the Court thought 
that perhaps Congress would act to 
make sure that all of those donations 
were disclosed. They weren’t making a 
decision that they liked secrecy. After 
all, Antonin Scalia who voted for Citi-
zens United said: 
With secrecy, democracy is doomed. 
Well, we haven’t acted because we 
have a triple veto baked into the way 
the Senate acts that says you need a 
supermajority to get a bill to the floor, 
a supermajority to close debate on 
amendments, and a supermajority to 
go to a final vote on a bill. 
Colleagues across the aisle have said: 
We wanted to protect that secret 
money because we think it helps us. 
That secret money is all about not 
government of, by, and for the people; 
that secret money is about government 
of, by, and for the powerful. So they 
are using their veto for the powerful to 
corrupt our country, to corrupt the 
core vision of government of, by, and 
for the people. That is what this DIS-
CLOSE Act is all about, to say that we 
only thrive if the money is legitimate 
in campaigns. 
Let me explain this. There are two 
standards that my Republican col-
leagues have been fighting for: one 
standard for ordinary people and a 
completely different standard for the 
rich and powerful. 
For ordinary people, they have sup-
ported public disclosure. So for ordi-
nary people in America who spend $200 
on a campaign, it is publicly disclosed. 
Everybody knows who you gave the 
money to. 
But if a billionaire doesn’t write a 
$200 check but writes a $200 million 
check on behalf of running a campaign 
for an individual, it is secret. It is se-
cret—secrecy for the rich and powerful, 
disclosure for ordinary Americans. 
This is all about the equivalent of a 
stadium sound system by the powerful 
that drowns out the voice of ordinary 
people. That drowning-out effort, as 
my colleague just pointed out, has 
gone higher and higher and higher. The 
sound system from the stadium has 
gotten louder and louder and louder, 
drowning out the voices of people. In 
2010, it was some 60 million in dark 
money. In 2016, collectively over the 
years they had reached a billion dol-
lars, and, in 2020, over a billion dollars 
in a single year. 
And now we have Barre Seid, who do-
nated his company, $1.6 billion, into 
the dark money network. This money, 
spent without accountability, is used 
to smear candidates. 
There is a saying—a saying I heard as 
a little kid—and that saying was: The 
lie gets halfway around the world be-
fore the truth gets its pants on. But in 
our social media world, it is more like 
the lie gets three times around the 
globe before the truth gets out the 
front door. The truth is being ham-
mered constantly by the smear cam-
paign from dark money. 
So this is what we have: a vote com-
ing up on whether you believe in secret 
money smear campaigns or you believe 
in public accountability and preserving 
the vision of government of, by, and for 
the people. 
This is so important to our future. I 
wonder what Antonin Scalia, lying in 
his grave, might be thinking when he 
sees the outcome of Citizens United, an 
outcome he did not intend. 
You know, I had the experience of 
being the target of one of these smear 
campaigns in 2014. The Koch brothers 
were bragging, and they held a meet-
ing. They said: We are going to put a 
lot of money—millions of dollars—into 
an organization called Freedom Part-
ners. And Freedom Partners, along 
with the network, is going to spend 
$200 million in the 2014 campaigns. 
They came to Oregon, and the press 
reports said that they were putting $3.6 
million into television ads attacking 
me. 
Now, I was in a different position 
than many targets because the Koch 
brothers 
had 
bragged 
about 
this 
money. So they did not take advantage 
of the anonymity that they could have. 
I decided to call them out. I put up an 
ad and said: Where is this money from? 
It is out-of-State oil and coal billion-
aires who have come to our State who 
want to elect my opponent because 
they share an agenda, and here is the 
agenda they have advertised: great in-
vestment for them, terrible choice for 
Oregon. 
That was my response. I was able to 
respond because, in that case, the Koch 
brothers had chosen to waive the se-
crecy. They wanted people to know 
what they were doing. They wanted 
people to tremble and fear over the fact 
that they could write a check for $3 
million, or $5 million, or $10 million, or 
$50 million. 
This is even more evil when it is se-
cret because then you can’t respond 
about the source and what they are all 
about. 
We have seen some recent examples. 
The Elections Project—what is that 
dark money up to? That dark money is 
up to trying to override article I, sec-
tion 4 of the Constitution. They want 
State legislatures, without any influ-
ence from Congress or from Governors, 
to be able to write election rules. That 
is not what the Constitution says. 
In addition, they want State legisla-
tors to be able to ignore the vote in 
their State and reassign electors for 
President to whomever they want. 
That is what that dark money group is 
doing. 
How about Heritage Action? Jessica 
Anderson, the executive director, was 
caught on video bragging about her or-
ganization’s role in passing voter sup-
pression laws in Georgia. That is what 
that dark money is up to. They are try-
ing to stop Americans from voting. 
How un-American is that? How unpa-
triotic is that? How ‘‘destroying the 
freedom and rights of Americans’’ is 
that? That is what Heritage Action is 
up to in trying to destroy democracy 
here in the United States of America. 
Then we had the dark money groups 
coming together and saying that they 
were going to have an under-the-dome- 
type strategy to stop the DISCLOSE 
Act. What does ‘‘under the dome’’ 
mean? It is a reference to the dome 
over the Capitol. ‘‘Under the dome’’ is 
about using the triple veto here in the 
Senate to stop the DISCLOSE Act. 
We twice had 59 votes to try to hold 
a debate on the DISCLOSE Act, but 
not 60—1 vote short. Now they are try-
ing to do it again, to use the Repub-
lican caucus under the Senate rules— 
an under-the-dome strategy to support 
the sleazy, terrible, dark money at-
tacks corrupting elections in America. 
I say ‘‘corrupting’’ because how can 
an individual, if they can’t see who is 
donating the money, if they don’t 
know what is true and what isn’t, be-
cause the highest percentage of these 
ads are actually putting fake facts for-
ward; they are putting lies forward— 
that is why I call them a smear cam-
paign. If smear campaigns are inun-
dating the airways, how can citizens 
make an informed judgment? They 
can’t. That is why Antonin Scalia said 
this type of secrecy would destroy de-
mocracy, and on this, he was right. 
Let’s pass the DISCLOSE Act. Let’s 
save the vision of government of, by, 
and for the people. 
I yield to my colleague from Oregon. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
SMITH). The Senator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. I thank my colleague, 
and I know that Senator VAN HOLLEN 
is here as well. 
I am going to be brief. I particularly 
want to thank our colleague from 
Rhode Island because he has been re-
lentless in terms of making this case 
day after day. I want to put this in 
very personal kind of terms because all 
of us who have the honor of serving in 
the U.S. Senate can relate to this 
issue.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4904 
September 21, 2022 
Senator WHITEHOUSE has added a re-
form to his proposal that is very per-
sonal to me and I think embodies the 
accountability and the transparency 
that Oregonians and people in Min-
nesota, Michigan, and Maryland are 
calling for. Here is how I would start 
it: A number of years ago, I authored 
legislation that millions of Americans 
now understand is called Stand By 
Your Ad. Stand By Your Ad stipulated 
that as an elected official or a can-
didate, you would have to actually put 
your name behind these attack ads 
where you go after your opponent. And, 
now, day after day, in these next 50- 
plus days, we are going to see plenty of 
these ads. 
The law worked well, and it is still 
on the books today, much to the cha-
grin of some officials who would like to 
take a quick hit on their opponent—an 
official or a candidate—and then scam-
per off without any accountability. 
I do want to make clear, because of 
the good work of the Senator from 
Rhode Island, that Stand By Your Ad 
doesn’t mean as much today because 
we now know the premium is ongoing 
for these secret, incredibly negative 
ads on your opponent because the peo-
ple paying for dark money ads aren’t 
required to put their name behind what 
they are saying. 
That is an extraordinarily strong hit 
against openness and accountability 
and transparency in our democracy. 
Oregonians and people across the coun-
try are rightfully disgusted by it. It is 
extraordinary the lengths that those 
who 
are 
orchestrating 
these 
dark 
money attacks will go in order to make 
their case when there is no account-
ability. 
I see my seatmate from the Finance 
Committee. We have worked together 
for years to change the Medicare stat-
ute that barred Medicare from negoti-
ating to hold down the price of medi-
cine. Big Pharma protected this negoti-
ating ban like it was the Holy Grail. 
My colleague and I would come to the 
committee day after day and talk 
about: How is this common sense? Ev-
erybody in America negotiates in order 
to get the best possible deal. 
But we looked, particularly in this 
session, at the start of the debate as a 
classic study in dark money. Big 
Pharma, and groups associated with it, 
spent enormous sums of money attack-
ing me personally in Washington, DC, 
media. There was scary music, and 
there were attacks about how anybody 
who wanted these reforms was like a 
leech and taking away cures from the 
American people. 
The striking part of all of this, and 
why what Senator WHITEHOUSE has had 
to say is so important, is that the ad 
wasn’t even directed at me, because it 
was in Washington, DC. I am barely a 
household word in my own household, 
let alone in Washington, DC. 
And what was the point of these ex-
traordinarily large sums attacking me 
in Washington, DC? The point of it was 
to scare my colleagues—Senator STA-
BENOW, Senator VAN HOLLEN, all of my 
colleagues here—because there was so 
much money at the hands of these ex-
treme 
groups 
associated 
with 
Big 
Pharma that wanted to undermine a 
commonsense reform backed by mil-
lions 
of 
Americans 
that 
Medicare 
should negotiate. 
At one point, someone said: Oh, there 
is so much opposition to this effort to 
negotiate. 
I said: Are you kidding me? The op-
ponents of negotiating on Medicare 
must be in a witness protection pro-
gram because we can’t find anybody 
who thinks you shouldn’t negotiate. 
Yet Big Pharma was willing to spend 
huge sums of money—dark money—not 
really to damage me politically, be-
cause my constituents live in Oregon, 
but to scare other Senators. 
So people, of course, are going to get 
bludgeoned with these dark money ads 
every time they turn on the television, 
the radio, or watch a video online. I 
just don’t think that Americans should 
be forced to guess or wonder what spe-
cial interest is funding these ads that 
come from murky groups that have 
these radical names like the Coalition 
for Prosperity and Justice. We all 
know that they are not going to tell 
you who they really are. 
My colleague from Maryland has 
been 
very 
patient. 
We 
had 
some 
glitches in the schedule, and we want 
to hear from our friend from Michigan 
as well. 
I want to thank Senator WHITEHOUSE 
for basically taking the ‘‘Stand By 
Your Ad’’ concept and kind of reconfig-
uring it in the DISCLOSE legislation. 
Senator WHITEHOUSE’s bill would re-
quire the heads of corporations, unions, 
or other organizations to identify when 
they are behind political ads, the same 
way Stand By Your Ad works under the 
original version of the law that I au-
thored. 
And remember—and I want this to be 
the takeaway about this issue—Sen-
ator WHITEHOUSE’s proposal and ex-
tending ‘‘Stand by Your Ad’’ in this 
kind of fashion treats everybody the 
same. This is quintessential good gov-
ernment. It is not about going after 
somebody on the right or somebody on 
the left. This is about common sense. 
It is not a radical, leftwing proposal. 
The American people ought to know 
who is trying to influence their votes. 
By the way, when we authored the 
original ‘‘Stand by Your Ad’’ proposal, 
it used to be bipartisan. And as my col-
league from Rhode Island has men-
tioned, of late, it has been the Repub-
licans who have been protecting dark 
money and protecting the basic kind of 
disclosure that I think our system of 
government has been all about. 
The American people have strong dif-
ferences of opinion on issues. There is 
no question about that. But I have had 
more than 1,020 open-to-all townhall 
meetings. What nobody disputes is that 
openness and accountability is what 
the American system is all about. 
So, Senator WHITEHOUSE, our thanks 
to you for spending years and years at 
it because you are taking us, in a sig-
nificant way, back to what I think used 
to be common sense, used to be ac-
countability, used to be something 
that transcended the kind of thing that 
Big Pharma was doing early on where 
they didn’t even pretend—they didn’t 
even pretend—it was about an indi-
vidual legislator; it was about scaring 
off all Members of Congress. 
We can do better. Senator WHITE-
HOUSE’s proposal moves us in that di-
rection, and I want to thank my col-
league from Maryland, who also was 
trying to deal with the scheduling kind 
of challenge, and look forward to work-
ing with him and my seatmate on the 
Finance 
Committee 
and 
Senator 
WHITEHOUSE, another exemplary mem-
ber of the Finance Committee. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Presi-
dent, I ask unanimous consent that the 
following Senators be permitted to 
speak prior to the scheduled vote: my-
self for up to 10 minutes, Senator STA-
BENOW for up to 10 minutes, Senator 
CANTWELL for up to 5 minutes, and Sen-
ator MENENDEZ for up to 5 minutes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
DISCLOSE ACT 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Presi-
dent, I too want to thank the Senator 
from Rhode Island, Senator WHITE-
HOUSE, for his laser focus on the issue 
of disclosure and transparency. And I 
want to thank my colleagues here on 
the floor: Senator WYDEN; Senator STA-
BENOW; and Senator MERKLEY, who was 
here before; and others within our cau-
cus. 
In fact, every member of our Demo-
cratic Caucus supports the DISCLOSE 
Act. We support it because the stakes 
are so high for the future of our democ-
racy. Billions of dollars that have crept 
in and now are gushing into our polit-
ical system to influence our elections 
pose a grave threat to our Republic and 
to the future of our democracy. 
Make no mistake, these are corpora-
tions and very wealthy people who are 
spending billions of dollars in secret 
money to influence people’s votes so 
that they can get their way at the ex-
pense of the public interest. You have 
got a very few people with very deep 
bankrolls who are using their funds to 
try to shape our democracy and bend 
our democracy to suit their interests 
at the expense of everybody else. 
And, as President Biden said in his 
remarks on this earlier this week, even 
foreign entities—foreign entities that 
are not allowed to contribute to polit-
ical campaigns are engaged in these po-
litical 
expenditures—under 
current 
law, use dark money, front groups, to 
try to influence our elections and steer 
the course of our democracy here in 
the United States from overseas. That, 
by itself, should scare the hell out of 
every Senator and every American. 
Madam President, I want to talk a 
little bit about how we got here. How

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4905 
September 21, 2022 
did we get to a place where, in the 
United States of America, for elec-
tions, special interests can spend bil-
lions of dollars to influence people’s 
votes without telling the voters who 
they are? And make no mistake, they 
are not telling voters who they are be-
cause they don’t want voters to know 
who is behind these ads. 
Well, the story begins with the infa-
mous 5–4 decision in the Supreme 
Court case of Citizens United. That de-
cision opened the spigots and then 
floodgates to corporate spending—cor-
porate spending in Federal elections. 
That is when the Supreme Court said: 
For spending in elections, we are going 
to say corporations are people too. Cor-
porations can’t go into the ballot box 
and push the lever, but for purposes of 
influencing everybody else’s vote, we 
are going to say corporations are peo-
ple too. 
And that unleashed a huge amount of 
money into politics. The only way to 
address that part of Citizens United is, 
of course, either to have a Supreme 
Court that will reverse the terrible 
Citizens United decision or through 
constitutional amendment. I support 
that, but that is not happening any-
time soon. But there is something that 
we can do right now and which we are 
going to vote on tomorrow, and that is 
the issue of secret, dark money because 
we can change that through our votes 
tomorrow. 
After Citizens United, what you 
began to see was not just more money, 
not just a gusher of money from cor-
porations and corporate entities going 
into elections, but more and more se-
cret money flowing into elections. And 
you can see the pattern here of, back in 
2006, about $5 million a year going into 
secret money in different ways; in 2020, 
$1 billion in that year alone. So the 
trajectory is increasing by the year, 
and as my colleagues have said, we also 
have the situation where one indi-
vidual just contributed $1.6 billion that 
is going to flow in subterranean ways 
through our election process—one indi-
vidual, $1.6 billion. 
Now, here is a point I want to empha-
size. Even in that really terrible Su-
preme Court decision, 5–4 decision, in 
Citizens United, the Justices—eight of 
the nine Justices in that decision 
called for more transparency in elec-
tions. Here is what Justice Kennedy 
wrote on behalf of eight of the nine 
Justices: that the disclosure of polit-
ical 
expenditures 
‘‘provide 
share-
holders and citizens with the informa-
tion needed to hold corporations and 
elected officials accountable for their 
positions and supporters.’’ 
He went on to say that, with disclo-
sure, ‘‘citizens can see whether elected 
officials are ‘in the pocket’ of so-called 
moneyed interests.’’ 
This is Justice Kennedy. He voted for 
the notorious Citizens United decision, 
which opened the gushers of money, 
but he said, as this money flows 
through our system, we have a public 
interest in making sure voters know 
who is spending that money. And he 
says right here that it is important for 
citizens to know whether their elected 
officials are in the pockets of special 
interests. 
So this vote is pretty clear in former 
Justice Kennedy’s terms, which is, if 
you want dark money, you don’t want 
the public to know who is supporting 
you in your campaigns, if you support 
continuing dark money. 
So after that Citizens United deci-
sion, the alarm bells went off, as they 
should, and many of us said: We have 
got to pass a law to require disclosure. 
All this money is going to flow through 
the system. My God, at the very least, 
let’s make sure that voters know who 
is spending the money. 
So back in 2010—I served in the 
House of Representatives at the time— 
I authored the original DISCLOSE Act. 
My chief cosponsor was a Republican, 
Mike Castle from the State of Dela-
ware, at the time. And we passed it. We 
passed that in the House of Representa-
tives back in 2010. But when it came to 
the Senate, it hit a brick wall of Re-
publican opposition. 
And I must say, given what Repub-
licans had said before the Citizens 
United decision about disclosure, it 
was a complete, 180-degree flip-flop and 
turnaround because the position that 
the Republican Senate leader Senator 
MCCONNELL had taken for decades was, 
We don’t need all these regulations to 
regulate 
political 
money, 
but 
we 
should have disclosure; we should have 
disclosure. 
In fact, when he was on ‘‘Meet the 
Press’’ back in the day, in the year 
2000, this was a hot issue because of 
McCain-Feingold. So he was asked why 
he voted no on one of these campaign 
finance provisions, and he said the fol-
lowing: 
We need to have real disclosure. And so 
what we ought to do is broaden the disclo-
sure to include at least labor unions and tax- 
exempt business associations . . . so you in-
clude the major political players in America. 
He went on to say—Senator MCCON-
NELL: 
Why would a little disclosure be better 
than a lot of disclosure? 
Well, I agreed with Senator MCCON-
NELL in 2000. We want full disclosure 
and full transparency. But what hap-
pened was, as soon as the Citizens 
United decision came down and a gush-
er of money started flowing through 
the system, including through corpora-
tions, all of a sudden, all of a sudden: 
Hey, I didn’t mean what I said about 
disclosure. I can have my cake and eat 
it too—lots of money and nobody 
knows where it comes from. 
And, in a twist of history, when we 
passed the DISCLOSE bill out of the 
House, it came to the Senate, and the 
Senate version of that bill got 59 out of 
100 votes. Every Democrat voted for it. 
It would have been 60 except for a ter-
rible twist in history, which is Senator 
KENNEDY
passed away. And Senator 
BROWN
took his place, and Senator 
BROWN voted against cloture on the 
DISCLOSE Act. 
But, my colleagues, here is the fact: 
59 out of 100 Senators wanted to move 
forward there, and but for the anti-
democratic filibuster, we wouldn’t have 
secret money in politics today. But 
here we are, and we have to deal with 
it in the here and now. 
And it is interesting to hear the Re-
publican leader. He said back in 2012, 
after we tried to move the DISCLOSE 
Act, on this Senate floor: Dark money 
is a ‘‘problem that doesn’t exist.’’ 
Then, to take things even further, he 
rallied Republicans, and so, in the Re-
publican national platform in 2012, it 
read: We ‘‘oppose passage of the DIS-
CLOSE Act,’’ by name. We don’t want 
the American people to know who is 
spending this money. We like dark 
money in politics. 
So that brings us to today because 
what we saw since that vote in 2010 and 
then those comments by the Repub-
lican leader back in 2012 is this huge 
gusher of secret money flowing. And, 
interestingly now, it has also caught 
the attention of some of our Repub-
lican colleagues who have been com-
plaining about secret money in poli-
tics, complaining that Democratic po-
litical organizations are spending se-
cret money in politics. 
As we know, Senator MCCONNELL dis-
tributed to reporters an email entitled 
‘‘Democrats Let the Dark Money Flow 
and Like Its Power’’—and like its 
power. And Senator HAWLEY tweeted 
about dark money from foreign groups, 
writing: 
But who is funding this overseas dark 
money group—Big Tech? billionaire activ-
ists? foreign governments? We have no idea. 
Americans deserve to know what foreign in-
terests are attempting to influence Amer-
ican democracy. 
This is Senator HAWLEY, the Senator 
from Missouri. And I don’t say this 
often on the Senate floor, but I agree 
with Senator HAWLEY’s question here. 
And tomorrow he and every Member of 
this body will have a chance to vote to 
say that, yes, we should know about 
what foreign entities and interests are 
spending money in our elections, be-
cause there is all sorts of money—in 
fact, about $300 billion a year in foreign 
money—being laundered through our 
whole economy, and we don’t know 
how much of that these days is flowing 
into elections. As President Biden said, 
we need to pass this to do that. 
And if you look at some of the titles 
of this bill that Senator WHITEHOUSE 
has put forward, they are pretty sim-
ple. There are whole sections of the bill 
to get at the question of foreign money 
in our elections. I don’t know why any-
one is going to oppose that. 
Here we are, 12 years later, after that 
vote in 2010 that got 59 out of 100 votes. 
It would have had 60, except that Sen-
ator Kennedy passed away. And our Re-
publican colleagues, who are now com-
plaining about secret money, have a 
chance to work with us and vote with 
us to get rid of it. Whether it is Demo-
cratic 
money, 
Republican 
money, 
somebody else’s secret money, get rid

of it. Require transparency. That is 
what the DISCLOSE Act is all about. 
So this is another chance for every 
Member of the Senate to align them-
selves with the overwhelming majority 
of the American people. Eighty percent 
support transparency disclosure, and 
they do it because they know how im-
portant it is to our democracy. Let’s 
vote for this. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, 
first of all, I want to thank Senator 
VAN HOLLEN for his incredible work 
over the years and his leadership both 
in the House and in the Senate. And 
thank you for taking on this fight and 
working so hard to expose the bright 
light of truth and transparency about 
what 
is 
happening 
around 
secret 
money. 
And I want to thank Senator WHITE-
HOUSE for his dogged focus on the issue 
of secret money influencing elections. 
Thank you for all of your wonderful 
work, and to all of our colleagues who 
have joined us on the floor and to all of 
my Democratic colleagues, all of whom 
are supporting the DISCLOSE Act. 
The Members of this Chamber have a 
choice to make, and it is really pretty 
simple: You can be on the side of the 
American people or you can be on the 
side of the rich and powerful. 
We can pass the DISCLOSE Act, let 
the public know what is happening, put 
limits around it, stop all of this; or you 
can vote against it and vote with the 
powerful and the wealthy. 
The DISCLOSE Act is going to keep 
our elections in the hands of voters, 
not the highest bidders. That is really 
the bottom line. And you don’t have to 
look very far for examples of why we 
need to pass this legislation. 
Colleagues have all been talking 
today about, stunningly, how a con-
servative group has received a $1.6 bil-
lion donation from a single donor—one 
man, $1.6 billion; and one mission—one 
mission—to put his finger on the scale 
of our democracy. 
If you don’t think that guy isn’t 
going to have an undue influence on 
our elections in the coming years, then 
I have a bridge across the Straits of 
Mackinac I would like to sell you. 
And this very rich man isn’t alone, 
unfortunately. As my colleagues have 
said, in 2006, there was less than $5 mil-
lion in dark money spent on our elec-
tions—5 million. Then, in 2010, the Su-
preme Court handed down its Citizens 
United decision, which opened the 
floodgates, and it didn’t take long for 
the water to rise. In 2012, more than 
$300 
million 
was 
spent 
in 
secret 
money—dark money—in elections, and 
in 2020, more than $1 billion was spent 
in dark money in elections. And now 
we know, in 2022, that we have one per-
son who has already given $1.6 billion 
to try to influence this election. 
If you laid those billion-dollar bills 
end to end, they would extend around 
the Earth nearly four times—extend 
around the Earth four times. That is 
how much we are talking about here, 
and we don’t even know where all this 
anonymous spending is coming from. 
But we do know this, and Senator 
WYDEN—Chairman WYDEN—spoke ear-
lier. When we took on Big Pharma to 
lower prescription drug prices, not one 
Republican voted yes. When we took on 
Big Oil to lower energy costs and at-
tack the climate crisis, not one Repub-
lican voted yes. When we took on cor-
porations that pay zero in taxes, not 
one Republican voted yes. 
The American people deserve to 
know why. How much dark money is 
coming in from those powerful inter-
ests to protect their profits? 
Dark money could also be coming 
from foreign actors who wish to harm 
our country. 
What has been reported, though, 
again, is that dark money is coming in 
from one really rich guy—one really 
rich guy who wants to make our Na-
tion a little bit more toward his liking. 
American voters deserve to know 
who is spending huge—huge, huge— 
sums of money to influence our democ-
racy. And under the DISCLOSE Act, 
they will know that. It will strengthen 
the foreign money ban to make sure 
foreign actors can’t influence our elec-
tions. It requires corporations and 
other groups to disclose their donors. 
Right, left, Democrat, Republican: Dis-
close your donors. 
And it expands disclosure require-
ments to online ads and other types of 
ads as well. As for all of those cam-
paign text messages that are blowing 
up your phone, you deserve to know 
who is sending them. 
These changes are popular. They are 
common sense, and they are really im-
portant. They are really important if 
we think America deserves to know 
who is influencing our elections. It is 
time to make sure our American de-
mocracy actually works for the Amer-
ican people. 
Again, the Members of this Chamber 
have a choice to make: We can stand 
with the American people or we can 
stand with the rich and powerful. 
Democrats have made that choice. I 
have made that choice. We stand with 
the American people who just want a 
fair shot to work hard and get ahead. 
Americans want to know that this is 
their democracy and that it works for 
them, not just a few rich people. 
I urge my colleagues to support the 
DISCLOSE Act. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
NOMINATION OF ARATI PRABHAKAR 
Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I 
rise today to support the nomination of 
Dr. Arati Prabhakar to be the Director 
of the Office of Science and Tech-
nology. 
Since 
1976, 
the 
Office 
of 
Science and Technology Policy has 
worked to ensure that the United 
States leads in science and technology, 
to promote STEM education, and to 
make sure that our science Agencies 
share the common purpose of bene-
fiting all Americans. 
Dr. Prabhakar is very well qualified 
for this job. As an engineer, physicist, 
leader, venture capitalist, and pioneer, 
she has had a trailblazing career, ac-
complishing a lot in a time period 
where she was Director of the Defense 
Advanced Research Project Agency, 
DARPA, and the first woman to lead 
the National Institute of Standards 
and Technology, NIST. 
And under Dr. Prabhakar’s leader-
ship, DARPA kick-started the develop-
ment of a rapid-response mRNA vac-
cine platform. This platform was the 
basis for the fast, safe, and effective 
COVID–19 development. 
Under her leadership at NIST, she 
worked to expand the Manufacturing 
Extension Partnership to boost the 
competitiveness of small- and medium- 
sized American manufacturers. 
Just last year, the Manufacturing 
Extension Partnership program helped 
our domestic manufacturers capture 
$3.9 billion in new sales. In my State 
alone, that translated into over $186 
million and more than 2,000 jobs cre-
ated or retained. 
Perhaps even more impressive, back 
in the 1990s, when Dr. Prabhakar was 
just in her twenties, she helped launch 
DARPA programs that made essential 
leaps forward in semiconductor manu-
facturing technology. Dr. Prabhakar’s 
programs laid the groundwork for five 
generations 
of 
chip 
manufacturing 
technologies to help demonstrate lead-
ership right here in the United States. 
Dr. Prabhakar is now ready to lead 
again, and now we are asking for her to 
lead this important Agency. We have 
just passed the CHIPS and Science Act, 
which is a renewed commitment to do-
mestic semiconductor research and 
manufacturing and U.S. leadership in 
the next generation chip technology. 
Dr. Prabhakar has the exact experi-
ence we need to advise the President on 
semiconductor 
manufacturing, 
on 
bringing the supply chain and security 
that we need here in the United States, 
and on continued growth in science and 
technology jobs that come along with 
it. 
The CHIPS and Science Act directs 
the National Science Foundation to in-
vest in translational research, includ-
ing through a new NSF tech direc-
torate. 
Before 
her 
nomination, 
Dr. 
Prabhakar was an important voice in 
support of this effort of a tech direc-
torate, reaching out to House and Sen-
ate colleagues and helping to shape the 
directorate in its focus on big national 
and security challenges. 
And the CHIPS and Science Act re-
flects our commitment to diversity in 
science, to make sure that the engi-
neering, math, and STEM fields are in-
cluded and that we continue to grow a 
workforce that is needed. 
The important aspect of science is 
not always thought of in every aspect 
of growing the next generation. That is 
why I am so encouraged that Dr.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4907 
September 21, 2022 
Prabhakar is very committed to in-
creasing the talent pool that we need 
in our country. 
For the first time in our country’s 
history, the President has elevated the 
Office of Science and Technology Pol-
icy Director to a Cabinet-level post, 
meaning there will be a scientist in the 
room for our Nation’s most important 
discussions. 
And for the first time in history, 
with the support of my colleagues here 
today, Dr. Prabhakar will be the first 
woman and person of color to serve as 
the Senate-confirmed OSTP Director. 
Dr. Prabhakar will have a lot to do, 
including developing the whole-of-gov-
ernment science and technology strate-
gies for issues ranging from security to 
commercial space exploration. And at 
a time of growing competition, OSTP 
needs to tell the President and advise 
our leaders what we need to do to 
maintain our competitiveness as a na-
tion. 
I know, coming from an innovation 
State, how important the Office of 
Science and Technology Policy strate-
gies can be in helping our Nation at-
tract and keep the best and brightest 
and prioritize collaboration between 
academia and industry. And since 
Washington has been a STEM leader— 
in fact, I think we are the most STEM- 
focused State in the Nation; that is, by 
number of people involved in STEM—— 
we know that this partnership between 
the existing workforce and the work-
force of tomorrow needs to grow. 
I know that, as a former DARPA Di-
rector, Dr. Prabhakar will help us with 
this engine of innovation and growing 
STEM education in America. More-
over, I know that Dr. Prabhakar will, 
on many issues, help to improve the 
participation of women and girls in the 
issues of STEM. 
This is such a big, important issue 
for us today. But just being at the 
helm of the Office of Science and Tech-
nology Policy, being a woman, being 
there at the Cabinet level, and advising 
the President of the United States, I 
know she will help to deliver a message 
that young women all across America 
need to be involved in the sciences to 
help our Nation in the next phases of 
innovation. I am so excited that she 
will be in this position. 
I ask my colleagues to support her as 
a devoted, experienced, and exceptional 
public servant. These are the kinds of 
people who we need in government. 
These are the kinds of people who can 
make America stronger, safer, and 
more competitive. I urge my colleagues 
to support the confirmation of Dr. 
Prabhakar as the Director of the Office 
of Science and Technology Policy. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF AMANDA BENNETT 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I 
rise today in support of Amanda Ben-
nett to be the Chief Executive Officer 
of the U.S. State Agency for Global 
Media. 
When autocrats around the world 
have been cracking down on inde-
pendent media; when regimes silence 
opposition with repression and fear; 
when they shut down the internet, as 
we have seen in countries like Cuba 
and Iran; when they actively target the 
United States and like-minded demo-
cratic 
nations 
with 
disinformation 
campaigns, it is critical for the United 
States to have a champion of democ-
racy and free speech leading the U.S. 
Agency for Global Media, someone who 
can meet the challenge posed by the 
spread 
of 
digital 
authoritarianism 
around the world. 
Ms. Bennett is prepared to take on 
that task. She has over two decades of 
experience in journalism, including as 
the director of Voice of America. For 23 
years, she worked at the Wall Street 
Journal, including as a correspondent 
in Beijing, where she came face-to-face 
with China’s authoritarianism. She has 
seen how their state security forces 
watch and detain journalists to sup-
press the truth. 
As a former director of Voice of 
America, she understands the impor-
tance of the U.S. Agency for Global 
Media’s networks and American public 
diplomacy efforts. 
Over the course of her career, she 
served on the boards of the Lenfest In-
stitute and Committee to Protect 
Journalists. 
In short, Ms. Bennett is without a 
doubt the right person for this posi-
tion. She will be a tireless advocate for 
the journalists working at USAGM and 
an effective steward of its operations. 
She will also be an invaluable ally to 
USAGM’s independent partners, includ-
ing Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty 
and Radio Free Asia. She will defend 
the importance of Radio and TV Marti. 
And she will be accountable to Con-
gress in these efforts. 
It has been almost 2 years since the 
Agency has had a Senate-confirmed 
CEO at the helm. It is in dire need of 
steady leadership that supports inde-
pendent media. 
I enthusiastically support Ms. Ben-
nett. I respectfully urge my colleagues 
to support her confirmation as well. 
TREATY DOCUMENT NO. 117–1 
Madam President, finally, before I 
yield the floor, I would also like to cel-
ebrate the Senate’s historic vote today 
to approve the Kigali Amendment to 
the Montreal Protocol. 
In approving the Kigali Amendment, 
the Senate took an important step that 
will have enormous economic and trade 
benefits for American manufacturing 
and jobs, but it was also the single 
most important climate action the 
Senate and the Senate Foreign Rela-
tions Committee have taken in more 
than 30 years. As wildfires ravage the 
West, 
hurricanes 
devastate 
Puerto 
Rico, and catastrophic flooding inun-
dates the Midwest, strong action to 
fight climate change has never been 
more urgent. 
By voting for the Kigali Amendment 
today, we voted for maintaining a liv-
able planet with clean water to drink. 
We voted for a stable food supply for 
all of humanity. We voted, in a strong 
bipartisan coalition, to keep American 
innovation and business at the fore-
front of the transition to clean energy. 
Finally, I want to express my grati-
tude for the support and cooperation of 
the Foreign Relations Committee’s 
ranking member, the senior Senator 
from Idaho, Senator RISCH. His part-
nership and the tireless efforts of his 
staff were essential in the Senate’s suc-
cess on Kigali. 
I want to thank my staff on the Sen-
ate 
Foreign 
Relations 
Committee: 
Damian Murphy, staff director; Andrew 
Keller, chief counsel; Josh Klein; Josh 
Kretman; 
Julia 
Greensfelder; 
and 
Megan Bartley. They were essential in 
getting it to the committee and mak-
ing us successful. 
I urge a positive vote. 
I yield the floor.

to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the

S. RES. 753 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I rise 
today to say a few words about the 
state of democracy, both in terms of 
the upcoming election in Brazil as well 
as here in the United States. 
It is no great secret that, today, de-
mocracies around the world are under 
great threat from rightwing extre-
mism. That obviously includes our 
own, as we all saw tragically on Janu-
ary 6, 2021, when there was an attack 
on this very building by those seeking 
to overturn our Presidential election. 
One of the countries where democ-
racy is now under threat is Brazil, the 
largest nation in Latin America and 
one of the largest democratic countries 
in the world. On October 2, less than 2 
weeks from now, Brazil will hold its 
Presidential 
election. 
According 
to 
many polls, it appears that the two 
major candidates in that election are 
President Jair Bolsonaro and former 
President Lula da Silva. If no can-
didate in that election receives over 50 
percent of the vote, there will be a run-
off election between the top two can-
didates on October 30. 
Mr. President, over the past many 
months, Brazilians from all sectors of 
society have publicly expressed serious 
concerns about ongoing efforts in that 
country to undermine democracy, in-
cluding close to 1 million Brazilians 
who signed an open letter released on 
July 26, 2022, defending the democratic 
institutions of Brazil and the rule of 
law. 
And there is, in fact, a very good rea-
son as to why the people in Brazil are 
concerned about their democracy, and 
that is that the current President and 
candidate 
for 
reelection, 
Jair 
Bolsonaro, has made some very provoc-
ative statements which suggest that he 
might not accept the election results if 
he loses. In other words, Bolsonaro 
might attempt to destroy Brazilian de-
mocracy and remain in power no mat-
ter what the people of Brazil determine 
in a free and democratic election. 
Here are just a few examples of what 
Mr. Bolsonaro has said over the years. 
Back in September 2018, before he 
won his election, Bolsonaro stated: 
I will not accept an election result that is 
not my own victory. 
On September 7, 2021, as reported by 
the Financial Times, Bolsonaro stated: 
There are those who think they can take 
me from the presidency with the mark of a 
pen. Well, I say to everyone I have only three 
possible fates: Arrest, death or victory. And 
tell the bastards I’ll never be arrested. Only 
God can take me from the presidency. 
According to Human Rights Watch, 
previously, President Bolsonaro had 
claimed, without providing any evi-
dence, that the last two Presidential 
elections were fraudulent, including his 
own election, in which he claimed he 
got more votes than the final tally 
showed. 
But it is not just Bolsonaro’s words 
that should be of concern to those of us 
who still believe in democracy. Accord-
ing to a recent survey by the Federal 
University of the State of Rio de Janei-
ro, Brazil is experiencing a 335-percent 
increase in violence directed against 
political leaders in 2022 relative to 2019. 
Mr. President, it is obviously not the 
business of the United States to deter-
mine who the next President of Brazil 
is or to get involved in Brazil’s Presi-
dential elections in any way. That is a 
decision to be made solely by the peo-
ple of Brazil through a fair and free 
election. But it is the business of the 
United States to make clear to the peo-
ple of Brazil that our government will 
not recognize or support a government 
that comes to power through a mili-
tary coup or the undermining of a 
democratic election. That is our busi-
ness. 
In that regard, Mr. President, I ask 
my colleagues to support a resolution

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4909 
September 21, 2022 
that I have introduced with Senator 
KAINE, S. Res. 753. And Senator KAINE, 
of course, is the chair of the Senate 
Foreign Relations Subcommittee on 
the Western Hemisphere, and that is 
also cosponsored by Senators LEAHY, 
MERKLEY, BLUMENTHAL, and WARREN. 
This resolution is very simple and 
straightforward. It does not take sides 
in Brazil’s election, obviously, and that 
would be unacceptable. But what it 
does do is express the sense of the U.S. 
Senate that the U.S. Government will 
make it unequivocally clear that the 
continuing relationship of the United 
States and Brazil depends upon the 
commitment of the government of 
Brazil to democracy and human rights. 
This resolution urges the Biden ad-
ministration to make clear that the 
United States will not support any gov-
ernment that comes to power in Brazil 
through undemocratic means and to 
ensure U.S. security assistance to 
Brazil remains compliant with our laws 
related to the peaceful and democratic 
transition of power—in other words, no 
military aid to a military coup in 
Brazil. 
This does not seem to be a com-
plicated or, in my view, controversial 
piece of legislation. Yet—and I say this 
with a great deal of sadness, and maybe 
it tells us the state of democracy in the 
United States—we have not been able 
to get one single Republican to cospon-
sor this very simple, straightforward 
resolution. 
Why is that? And the answer is, I 
would love for my Republican col-
leagues to explain to me why they can-
not support and add their names to a 
resolution that simply supports Bra-
zil’s democracy and the peaceful trans-
fer of power. Obviously, it would be 
most effective if this resolution had bi-
partisan support, and I hope that it 
will. 
Mr. President, in my view, it is im-
perative that the U.S. Senate make it 
clear through this resolution that we 
support democracy in Brazil. It would 
be unacceptable to the United States 
to recognize a government that came 
to power undemocratically; and, if we 
did that, it would send a horrific mes-
sage to the entire world. So it is impor-
tant for the people of Brazil to know 
that we are on their side. 
We are on the side of democracy, and 
that is what this resolution is about. I 
ask my colleagues, in a bipartisan way, 
to support it.

EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
consider the following nominations en 
bloc: Calendar Nos. 1056 and 1060; that 
the Senate vote on the nominations en 
bloc without intervening action or de-
bate; that the motions to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table; and that the President be imme-
diately notified of the Senate’s action. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The question is, Will the Senate ad-
vise and consent to the nominations of 
Roselyn Tso, of Oregon, to be Director 
of the Indian Health Service, Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services, 
for the term of four years; and Robert 
A. Wood, of New York, to be an Alter-
nate Representative of the United 
States of America to the Sessions of 
the General Assembly of the United 
Nations, during his tenure of service as 
Alternate Representative of the United 
States of America for Special Political 
Affairs in the United Nations, en bloc? 
The nominations were confirmed en 
bloc.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

f 
DISCLOSE ACT 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I 
rise today in support of the DISCLOSE 
Act and the need to take action to get 
secret money out of our elections. 
I want to thank Senator WHITEHOUSE 
for his leadership on this legislation— 
and testimony at the Rules Committee 
hearing I held on it this summer—as 
well as Leader SCHUMER for holding 
this vote. Senator WHITEHOUSE
has 
championed this bill since 2012, and I 
have been proud to support it alongside 
him in every Congress. 
This vote could not come at a more 
important time, as we are seeing an 
unprecedented flood of money into our 
elections. Over $14 billion was spent 
during the 2020 elections, the most ex-
pensive in our country’s history. 
As we approach the general election 
in November, with 48 days left, this is 
already the most expensive midterm 
election ever. One estimate expects 
that nearly $10 billion will be spent 
just on political advertising this elec-
tion cycle, more than double the $4 bil-
lion in the 2018 midterm elections. 
As spending on elections increases, 
the sources of the spending are less ac-
countable than ever before. One inves-
tigation found that more than $1 bil-
lion was spent on the 2020 elections by 
groups that do not disclose their do-
nors at all. 
Americans know there is way too 
much money in our elections, and—for 
our democracy to work—we need to 
know where this money is coming 
from. But since the Supreme Court’s 
decision in Citizens United opened up 
the flood of outside money, no signifi-
cant improvements have been made to 
our disclosure laws or regulations. 
Unlimited, anonymous spending in 
our elections doesn’t encourage free 
speech; it drowns out the voices of the 
American people who are seeking to 
participate. And this unrelenting se-
cret spending will continue unless we 
take action to address it, which is why 
we need to pass the DISCLOSE Act. 
The DISCLOSE Act would address 
this tidal wave of secret money by re-
quiring outside groups that spend in 
our elections to disclose their large do-
nors—those that contribute more than 
$10,000—to the public. 
Importantly, the bill also makes it 
harder for wealthy special interests to 
hide their contributions or cloak the 
identity of donors; and it cracks down 
on the use of shell companies to con-
ceal donations from foreign nationals. 
I held a hearing on the bill in the 
Rules Committee this summer, where 
we heard about the effects that secret 
money is having on our democracy— 
and why we need to pass this legisla-
tion. 
Senator WHITEHOUSE testified at that 
hearing, and he spoke powerfully about 
the impact that secret money is having 
on our government—affecting all as-
pects of our lives, from the makeup of 
our courts to people’s healthcare deci-
sions to addressing climate change. 
We also heard from Montana’s Com-
missioner of Political Practices Jeff 
Mangan, who told us how his State’s 
version of the DISCLOSE Act passed in 
2015 with bipartisan support. I couldn’t 
agree more that transparency in our 
democracy should not be a partisan 
issue, and regardless of political party, 
we should know who is spending in our 
elections. 
The American people know what is at 
stake, so it is no surprise that cam-
paign finance disclosure laws have 
overwhelming support. One recent poll 
found that in swing States, 91 percent 
of 
likely 
voters—Republicans 
and 
Democrats—support full transparency 
of campaign contributions and spend-
ing in our elections. Another poll from 
2019 found that, across America, 83 per-
cent of likely voters support public dis-
closure of contributions to groups in-
volved in elections. 
There is also a long history of bipar-
tisan support for reducing the influ-
ence of money in our democracy. In 
fact, the very first limits on corporate 
campaign contributions in 1907, the 
landmark Federal Election Campaign 
Act in 1972, and the Bipartisan Cam-
paign Reform Act in 2002—which my 
friends and former colleagues Senators 
John McCain and Russ Feingold joined 
together to champion—were all passed 
on a bipartisan basis and signed into 
law by Republican Presidents. 
Former 
Supreme 
Court 
Justice 
Antonin Scalia—never one to hide his 
opinions—was also a staunch supporter 
of campaign finance disclosure. In a 
2010 case, Doe v. Reed, he wrote: ‘‘For 
my part, I do not look forward to a so-
ciety which, thanks to the Supreme 
Court, campaigns anonymously . . . 
hidden from public scrutiny and pro-
tected from the accountability of criti-
cism. This does not resemble the Home 
of the Brave.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4910 
September 21, 2022 
Ensuring the transparency of our 
elections has been—and should con-
tinue to be—a bipartisan value. These 
issues are at the very heart of our de-
mocracy, and this commonsense bill 
would protect the right of voters to 
make informed choices and know who 
has been trying to influence our elec-
tions. 
While we are here today to vote on 
legislation to counter the flood of se-
cret money in our elections, there is so 
much more we must do to safeguard 
our democracy, and I continue to sup-
port this and the other reforms in the 
Freedom to Vote Act. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
supporting these measures that are so 
fundamental to our system of govern-
ment and voting to advance this legis-
lation.

REMEMBERING SCOTT KEITH 
Ms. LUMMIS. Mr. President, today I 
have the distinct honor of welcoming 
Scott Keith to the Wyoming Agri-
culture Hall of Fame in the class of 
2022. While Scott sadly passed away in 
2020, I know he would be pleased that 
so many people he worked with over 
the years have honored him with this 
remarkable posthumous recognition. 
Being inducted into the hall of fame 
is truly one of the highest achieve-
ments anyone can meet. It means your 
peers and colleagues believe you are 
among the best of the best, you have 
made the industry better, and during 
your lifetime, you have set an example 
for those who wish to follow in your 
footsteps. 
Scott was introduced to the world of 
agriculture at an early age, having 
been born in Buffalo and raised on a 
ranch near Kaycee. It did not take long 
for him to learn to love and appreciate 
agriculture in Wyoming and realize 
that, when he grew up, that is what he 
wanted to do with his life. In order to 
help facilitate that dream, Scott en-
rolled at Casper College and eventually 
the University of Wyoming, where he 
earned a bachelor’s degree in agri-
culture business. 
Eventually, Scott and his new bride, 
Brenda, decided to move to Casper to 
settle down and raise a family. While 
in Casper, not only did Scott spend 
time fostering further relationships in 
the agriculture industry through his 
work as a loan officer with the Produc-
tion Credit Association and First Inter-
state Bank in Casper, he also made 
sure to leave his mark on the commu-
nity 
through 
numerous 
volunteer 
projects in Casper. Scott had served on 
the Casper Chamber of Commerce Ag 
Committee, as well as on the Natrona 
County Conservation District. He was 
also a very passionate supporter of the 
Kelly Walsh High School football team 
and the Casper Swim Club, where he 
could be found behind the grill at foot-
ball games and on the pool deck during 
swim meets. Needless to say, he loved 
his family and enjoyed supporting his 
local community any way he could. 
In 2002, Scott joined the Wyoming 
Business Council Agribusiness Division 
as the forage and co-op development 
program specialist, which eventually 
led to a promotion to be the livestock 
and forage program manager. In that 
role, Scott was instrumental in pro-
moting the Wyoming hay and forage 
industry across the United States and 
abroad. Scott also played a significant 
role in creating numerous associations 
related to the promotion of Wyoming 
Agriculture through the Wyoming Hay 
and Forage Association and the Future 
Cattle Producers of Wyoming. His work 
with the Wyoming Hay and Forage As-
sociation led Wyoming hay producers 
to victory at the World Forage Anal-
ysis Superbowl in Madison, WI—twice. 
I know there are many members of the 
Pro Football Hall of Fame who have no 
Super Bowl wins, but Scott was able to 
claim being a two-time winner of the 
World Forage Analysis Superbowl. 
Scott also took an interest in teach-
ing and promoting agriculture to youth 
in Wyoming. Being an expert in judg-
ing 
cattle, 
among 
other 
talents, 
through the Future Cattle Producers of 
Wyoming program, Scott would en-
courage high school students to learn 
how to raise cattle by working with 
local producers and a donated heifer. 
This not only gave high school stu-
dents firsthand experience in learning 
how to raise cattle, but it also played 
a vital role in making sure that Wyo-
ming continues to be a worldwide lead-
er in quality beef. 
After the passing of his wife Brenda, 
Scott met Tracy Smith in Casper, and 
in 2016, he began working as a con-
tractor for Big Iron Auctions. He was 
quickly promoted to district manager 
and was able to help those involved in 
Wyoming agriculture buy and sell their 
equipment. 
In addition to all of his work 
throughout his career, he still found 
time to be a part of the Wyoming Wool 
Growers 
Association, 
the 
Wyoming 
Stock Growers Association, and even 
was able to serve as the chairman of 
Wyoming AgXpo. He truly was an 
amazing person and a role model to all 
of us in Wyoming. 
I wish that Scott had been able to re-
ceive this recognition in person. He 
dedicated his life to the promotion of 
Wyoming agriculture, and many are 
benefiting from his hard work. But, I 
am glad that his legacy will continue 
to live on through his membership in 
the 
Wyoming 
Agriculture 
Hall 
of 
Fame.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO DANA CONNORS 
∑ Mr. KING. Mr. President, I rise today 
to honor the career one of Maine’s 
most 
dedicated, 
respected 
leaders: 
Dana Connors. Dana is part of the fab-
ric of Maine, and it is almost impos-
sible to concisely recognize the impact 
he has had on our State. 
Dana, a proud native of Aroostook 
County, started his career as a munic-
ipal manager in Presque Isle after 
graduating from the University of 
Maine. Here, he served as city manager 
for 16 years, where he built a reputa-
tion as an advocate for common sense, 
a consensus builder, and a good lis-
tener. His exceptional ability to put a 
fine point on issues and present a case 
for the greater good brought him to 
State government, where he served as 
Maine’s Commissioner of the Depart-
ment of Transportation under both a 
Democratic and Republican Governor— 
a true testament to his bipartisan val-
ues. 
In the time I have known him, it has 
always been clear that Dana served the 
people, not any party. It is due to this 
unimpeachable dedication, that people 
have always trusted him implicitly. I 
am one of those people, and when I was 
lucky enough to serve as Governor of 
the great State of Maine, Dana was my 
first and only choice to be my transi-
tion director. Shortly after in 1994, he 
became president of the Maine State 
Chamber of Commerce, where he has 
served our business community admi-
rably for nearly 30 years. 
It is here at the chamber where per-
haps he has left his largest legacy. 
There has never been a greater advo-
cate for Maine’s businesses, and his 
legacy will continue to echo through-
out our State for generations. Because 
of Dana, thousands of Maine businesses 
have been able to thrive, employ hard- 
working Maine people, and make our 
State the greatest in the Nation. 
While 
his 
retirement 
will 
undoubtably leave a large void in the 
business community, Dana has in-
stilled the same work ethic and under-
standing of the needs of Maine busi-
nesses in his team. They will continue 
Dana’s legacy and ensure the growing 
success of the State that Dana devoted 
his career to. 
Dana has made the Maine State 
chamber a shining example of profes-
sionalism. His instincts—and his fash-
ion sense—may be a hard act to follow, 
but his ability to lead always includes 
a path for others to succeed. Thank 
you, Dana, for your friendship, your 
leadership, and your dedication to pub-
lic service. Maine is better for it.∑

NATIONAL 
WASTE AND RECYCLING ASSO-
CIATION 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor the Kentucky Chapter

For 60 years, NWRA has been the Na-

tor waste and recycling industries, 
which are essential to maintaining the 
quality of American life. The daily de-
livery of waste and recycling services 
impacts all residential, commercial, 
and industrial properties.

through the strategic application of a 
results-driven advocacy and vision. The 
NWRA has created a favorable business 
climate where members prosper and 
provide safe, economically sustainable 
services and jobs that benefit commu-
nities throughout America. 
With nearly 700 members, no chapter 
has showcased this shining standard 
more than Kentucky’s NWRA chapter. 
For example, solid waste in Louisville 
has a diversion rate that is twice as ef-
ficient as comparable sized cities. 
Solid waste and recycling collection 
in Louisville is no easy task. Metro 
Louisville consists of 83 incorporated 
cities, numerous homeowners’ associa-
tions, and the Urban Services District 
collected by Metro Public Works. De-
spite 
these 
challenges, 
Kentucky’s 
NWRA chapter continues to meet and 
exceed all expectations. 
I am proud to salute the Kentucky 
NWRA chapter for their continued 
service and accomplishments, and I 
have no doubt they will continue to 
play an integral role in bettering the 
Commonwealth.∑

50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 
DOVER ADULT LEARNING CENTER 
∑ Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor to recognize the 
Dover Adult Learning Center—DALC— 
on its 50th anniversary. For five dec-
ades, the hard-working team at the 
DALC has supported thousands of adult 
learners in their quest to reinforce 
their learning skills and improve their 
lives through high-quality adult edu-
cation. I join a grateful community in 
saluting them for the indispensable 
service they provide not only to each 
participant, but also to local partners 
and businesses who benefit from an 
educated and engaged workforce. 
We all know that an education is the 
key to unlocking so many doors of op-
portunity. These doors could lead to a 
fulfilling new job, a hard-earned pro-
motion at a current place of work, or 
additional education and training at a 
community college. No matter the des-
tination, the Dover Adult Learning 
Center works closely with community 
members throughout their educational 
journey to identify personal goals and 
provide 
tailored 
instruction 
that 
guides them toward their full poten-
tial. The center offers an inviting at-
mosphere where students of all types— 
including people with disabilities, peo-
ple who are homeless or unemployed, 
teens who might otherwise drop out of 
high school or immigrants learning 
English—feel comfortable honing their 
reading, writing, math, and digital lit-
eracy skills. At the Dover Adult Learn-
ing Center, a high-quality adult edu-
cation is always within reach. 
Each June, the Dover Adult Learning 
Center holds a graduation ceremony 
where participants are able to cele-
brate the successful completion of 
their 
program 
alongside 
family, 
friends, center staff, and volunteer tu-
tors. It is a time to reflect on a period 
of personal growth and achievement. It 
is also a chance to look forward with 
hope. For many graduates, an exciting 
future with new possibilities is only 
just beginning. Through their experi-
ence at the Dover Adult Learning Cen-
ter, they are given the tools to venture 
into this new world with an open mind 
and a lifelong appreciation for learn-
ing. 
As a former teacher at the Dover 
Adult Learning Center, I know from 
personal experience how hard the cen-
ter works to provide these programs 
and 
accommodate 
each 
participant 
through a variety of learning options, 
flexible schedules, and access to sup-
portive services like childcare. Its staff 
and educators are creative in con-
necting and engaging with each stu-
dent, and they are always there to offer 
support and guidance. We should take a 
moment to thank all of the teachers, 
staff, and volunteers for the skill, dedi-
cation, and passion that they bring to 
their roles at the center each and every 
day. 
On behalf of the people of New Hamp-
shire, I ask my colleagues and all 
Americans to join me in congratu-
lating the Dover Adult Learning Cen-
ter on five decades of service and wish-
ing its team all the best as they con-
tinue their important work in the com-
ing years.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mr. LEAHY: 
S. 4916. A bill to reauthorize the Run-
away and Homeless Youth Act, and for 
other purposes; to the Committee on 
the Judiciary. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise 
to join my colleague, the senior Sen-
ator from Vermont, in introducing the 
Runaway and Homeless Youth and 
Trafficking Prevention Act of 2022. 
This bill would update and reauthorize 
the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act 
programs, which have provided life-
saving services and housing for Amer-
ica’s homeless youth for nearly half a 
century. 
Homelessness is affecting youth in 
truly staggering numbers. According to 
the National Network for Youth, an es-
timated 4.2 million young people expe-
rience homelessness at some point each 
year. Some of these youth may be 
away from home for a few nights, while 
others have been living on the streets 
for years. No area of this country is 
immune from the scourge of homeless-
ness, as it impacts rural and urban 
communities alike. 
Tragically, runaway and homeless 
youth are at high risk of victimization, 
abuse, criminal activity, and even 
death. This population is at greater 
risk of suicide, unintended pregnancy, 
and substance abuse. Many are unable 
to continue with school and are more 
likely to enter our juvenile criminal 
justice system. The reality is that 
available data likely underestimate 
the scale and consequences of this 
problem. 
I have met with teachers, social 
workers, and others from Maine who 
work directly with young people expe-
riencing 
homelessness. 
We 
talked 
about the pressure that student home-
lessness places on teachers, school ad-
ministrators, 
and 
their 
already 
strapped resources, and—most impor-
tant—the 
homeless 
students 
them-
selves. I have also visited New Begin-
nings in Lewiston, where I saw first-
hand 
how 
Runaway 
and 
Homeless 
Youth Act resources are providing es-
sential safety nets for young people in 
need. The staff at New Beginnings 
helps young people with case manage-
ment, provides referrals to State and 
local agencies, assists with housing 
needs and access to shelter, and con-
nects individuals to local educational 
and employment programs. 
Several years ago, as the chair of the 
Senate Transportation and Housing 
Appropriations Subcommittee, I held a 
hearing that featured testimony from 
Brittany Dixon, a former homeless 
youth from Auburn, ME, who gave pow-
erful testimony on her personal experi-
ence with homelessness. After becom-
ing homeless, Brittany was connected 
with New Beginnings. In her testi-
mony, she said, ‘‘New Beginnings pro-
vided many resources I could use to 
succeed, including assistance with col-
lege applications and financial aid. . . . 
New Beginnings has helped me to de-
velop critical life skills and to become 
self-sufficient.’’ ‘‘Programs that sup-
port homeless youth are important to

so many young people like me,’’ she 
added. ‘‘It gives young people the 
chance to have a safe place to stay 
while they get their footing and figure 
out what they want to do in their 
lives.’’ 
Runaway and Homeless Youth Act 
programs helped make Brittany’s suc-
cess story possible. Sadly, however, 
there are still many homeless youth 
who do not have the support they need. 
We must build on our past efforts be-
cause homeless youth should have the 
same opportunities to succeed as their 
peers. 
The three existing Runaway and 
Homeless Youth Act programs—the 
Basic Center Program, the Street Out-
reach Program, and the Transitional 
Living 
Program—help 
community- 
based organizations reach young people 
when they need support the most. 
These programs help runaway and 
homeless youth avoid the juvenile jus-
tice system, and early intervention can 
help them escape victimization and 
trafficking. 
The Runaway and Homeless Youth 
and Trafficking Prevention Act would 
reauthorize and strengthen these pro-
grams that help homeless youth meet 
their immediate needs, and it would 
help secure long-term residential serv-
ices for those who cannot be safely re-
united with their families. Our legisla-
tion would also create a new program— 
the Prevention Services Program—de-
signed to help prevent youth from run-
ning away and becoming homeless in 
the first place. Moreover, our bill sup-
ports wraparound services for victims 
of trafficking and sexual exploitation. 
Mr. President, the Runaway and 
Homeless Youth and Trafficking Pre-
vention Act will support those young 
people who run away, are forced out of 
their homes, or are disconnected from 
their families. A caring and safe place 
to sleep, eat, grow, study, and develop 
is critical for all young people. The 
programs reauthorized and modernized 
through this legislation help extend 
those basic services to the most vulner-
able youth in our communities. 
I thank Senator LEAHY for his leader-
ship on this bill and urge my col-
leagues to support it.

SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS 
SENATE RESOLUTION 787—RECOG-
NIZING THE VITAL IMPORTANCE 
OF 
THE 
MEKONG 
RIVER 
TO 
SOUTHEAST ASIA AND THE ROLE 
OF 
THE 
MEKONG-UNITED 
STATES PARTNERSHIP IN SUP-
PORTING THE PROSPERITY OF 
THE REGION 
Mr. MERKLEY (for himself and Mr. 
SULLIVAN) submitted the following res-
olution; which was referred to the 
Committee on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 787 
Whereas the Mekong River supports the 
livelihoods of approximately 60,000,000 peo-
ple, making it the most important river in 
Southeast Asia and one of the most impor-
tant rivers in the world; 
Whereas the Mekong-United States Part-
nership, 
comprising 
the 
United 
States, 
Burma, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Viet-
nam, and the predecessor of that partner-
ship, the Lower Mekong Initiative, have con-
tributed greatly to the economic, social, and 
human resources development of the coun-
tries in the Mekong River Basin and the pro-
tection of the Mekong River; 
Whereas the United States has long-
standing diplomatic relations with the coun-
tries in the Mekong River Basin, including a 
nearly 200-year-old relationship with treaty 
ally Thailand; 
Whereas the development of the countries 
in the Mekong River Basin is critical for the 
unity, economic strength, and institutional 
development of the Association of Southeast 
Asian Nations, a strategic partner of the 
United States; 
Whereas the Mekong River is increasingly 
imperiled by the threats of climate change 
and the construction of upstream dams that 
have altered the natural flow of the river and 
vital ecological processes supported by nat-
ural flow; 
Whereas, since 2019, the flow of water in 
the Mekong River during the wet season has 
been abnormally low; 
Whereas the Nuozhadu and Xiaowan Dams 
in China account for more than 50 percent of 
the water storage of all dams in the Mekong 
River Basin and can restrict up to 10 percent 
of the total wet season flow of the Mekong 
River, 
exacerbating 
drought 
conditions 
downstream; 
Whereas the Mekong River Commission is 
an integral partner in ensuring the long- 
term health of the Mekong River; 
Whereas 
the 
Ayeyawady-Chao 
Phraya- 
Mekong Economic Cooperation Strategy can 
be a leader in supporting river development 
and protection; 
Whereas the Mekong Dam Monitor, funded 
partly by the Mekong-United States Part-
nership, has provided essential data and in-
formation about the impacts of hydropower 
dams along the Mekong River to the people 
and governments of the Mekong River Basin 
to allow them to prepare for irregular water 
flows and mitigate the economic and envi-
ronmental impacts of those flows; 
Whereas the Mekong River has become a 
hub for criminal elements to traffic in drugs, 
people, and wildlife, undermining the rule of 
law in the countries in the Mekong River 
Basin and impacting the world through the 
proliferation of illegal drugs and fauna that 
can cause spillover of zoonotic diseases; 
Whereas the international community has 
committed to support the development of 
countries along the Mekong River through 
internationally 
recognized 
development 
goals; 
Whereas the Friends of the Mekong, which 
includes the countries in the Mekong River 
Basin, the United States, Australia, the Eu-
ropean Union, Japan, New Zealand, the Re-
public of Korea, the Asian Development 
Bank, the Mekong River Commission Secre-
tariat, and the World Bank, is committed to 
supporting the shared principles that have 
underpinned peace and prosperity across the 
Indo-Pacific for decades; 
Whereas close coordination and collabora-
tion with civil society groups throughout the 
Mekong River Basin is essential to the pro-
tection of the Mekong River; 
Whereas, among the countries in the 
Mekong River Basin, there has been a nega-
tive trend toward the detention and detain-
ment of civil society actors and journalists 
and an increase in violations of human 
rights; 
Whereas the February 1, 2021, military 
coup in Burma was illegal and unjustified 
and has resulted in more than 2,000 deaths, 
more than 1,000,000 people displaced, and tens 
of thousands of people in detention, and con-
tinued violence threatens the stability of the 
entire region, especially those countries 
along the borders of Burma; and 
Whereas diaspora communities from coun-
tries in the Mekong River Basin are a vital 
part of the United States and help build 
thriving people-to-people ties between those 
countries and the United States that lead to 
strong commercial, civil society, and cul-
tural ties: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) expresses sincere concern over the envi-
ronmental, 
economic, 
and 
humanitarian 
threats to the Mekong River and the commu-
nities of the Mekong River and continued 
support to counter those threats; and 
(2) declares it is the policy of the United 
States Government to— 
(A) through the Mekong-United States 
Partnership and the Friends of the Mekong, 
promote the economic and environmental 
well-being of the people of Mainland South-
east Asia in the 5 countries through which 
the Mekong River flows, namely, Burma, 
Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam; 
(B) support a whole-of-government ap-
proach in providing and coordinating Federal 
aid and assistance throughout the Mekong 
River Basin under the Mekong-United States 
Partnership, including programmatic sup-
port provided by the Department of State, 
the United States Agency for International 
Development, and other Federal agencies; 
(C) contribute to the development of qual-
ity infrastructure, the development of na-
tional electricity markets, cross-border en-
ergy trade, the facilitation of cross-border 
transport, renewable and clean energy accel-
eration and deployment, the development of 
micro, small, and medium enterprises, agri-
culture, transportation, the facilitation of 
trade and investment, strengthened sub-
regional production linkages and supply 
chains, digital infrastructure, and the digital 
economy in the Mekong River Basin; 
(D) promote engagement and buy-in of the 
United States private sector to support the 
long-term inclusive economic growth, resil-
ience, global health, education, and sustain-
able development of the region; 
(E) leverage the expertise of the United 
States, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Aus-
tralia, and other partners in high-quality in-
frastructure to support the economic devel-
opment needs of the countries in the Mekong 
River Basin; 
(F) support the development of quality in-
frastructure, including through projects fi-
nanced by the United States International 
Development Finance Corporation, in the 
countries in the Mekong River Basin; 
(G) encourage all members of the Associa-
tion of Southeast Asian Nations to view the 
environmental, humanitarian, and economic 
threats to the Mekong River as a danger to 
the entire region; 
(H) promote sustainable water use, natural 
resources management, and environmental 
conservation and protection, including— 
(i) through support for a technically sound, 
well-coordinated, and consensus-based ap-
proach to managing the shared resources of 
the Mekong River Basin; 
(ii) through support for environmental con-
servation, protection, and resilience in the 
Mekong subregion; and 
(iii) by enhancing the capacity of countries 
in the Mekong River Basin in the sustainable 
conservation and management of natural re-
sources, including fishery resources, for sus-
tainable food security; 
(I) continue the important work that pro-
vides vital data and monitoring to the people 
and governments of the Mekong River;

TEMBER 23, 2022, AS ‘‘MALNUTRI-
TION AWARENESS WEEK’’ 
Mr. MURPHY (for himself, Mr. BOOK-
ER, Mrs. FEINSTEIN, Mr. CARDIN, Ms. 
SINEMA, 
Ms. 
HASSAN, 
and 
Mr. 
BLUMENTHAL) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 788 
Whereas malnutrition is the condition that 
occurs when an individual does not get 
enough protein, calories, or nutrients; 
Whereas malnutrition is a significant prob-
lem in the United States and around the 
world, crossing all age, racial, class, gender, 
and geographic lines; 
Whereas malnutrition can be driven by so-
cial determinants of health, including pov-
erty or economic instability, access to af-
fordable healthcare, and low health literacy; 
Whereas there are inextricable and cyclical 
links between poverty and malnutrition; 
Whereas communities of color, across all 
age groups, are disproportionately likely to 
experience both food insecurity and mal-
nutrition; 
Whereas the Department of Agriculture de-
fines food insecurity as when an individual 
or household does not have regular, reliable 
access to the foods needed for good health; 
Whereas Black children are almost 3 times 
more likely to live in a food-insecure house-
hold than White children; 
Whereas infants, older adults, individuals 
with chronic diseases, and other vulnerable 
populations are particularly at risk for mal-
nutrition; 
Whereas the American Academy of Pediat-
rics has found that failure to provide key nu-
trients during early childhood may result in 
lifelong deficits in brain function; 
Whereas disease-associated malnutrition 
affects between 30 and 50 percent of patients 
admitted to hospitals, and the medical costs 
of hospitalized patients with malnutrition 
can be 300 percent more than the medical 
costs of properly nourished patients; 
Whereas, according to the ‘‘National Blue-
print: Achieving Quality Malnutrition Care 
for Older Adults, 2020 Update’’, as many as 1⁄2 
of older adults living in the United States 
are malnourished or at risk for malnutrition; 
Whereas, according to recent Aging Net-
work surveys, 76 percent of older adults re-
ceiving meals at senior centers and other 
congregate facilities report improved health 
outcomes, and 84 percent of older adults re-
ceiving home-delivered meals indicate the 
same; 
Whereas disease-associated malnutrition 
in older adults alone costs the United States 
more than $51,300,000,000 each year; and 
Whereas the American Society for Paren-
teral and Enteral Nutrition established Mal-
nutrition Awareness Week to raise aware-
ness about, and promote the prevention of, 
malnutrition across the lifespan: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates the week of September 19 
through September 23, 2022, as ‘‘Malnutrition 
Awareness Week’’; 
(2) recognizes registered dietitian nutri-
tionists and other nutrition professionals, 
health care providers, school foodservice 
workers, social workers, advocates, care-
givers, and other professionals and agencies 
for their efforts to advance awareness about, 
treatments for, and the prevention of mal-
nutrition; 
(3) recognizes the importance of existing 
Federal nutrition programs, such as the nu-
trition programs under title III of the Older 
Americans Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C. 3021 et seq.) 
and Federal child nutrition programs, for 
their role in combating malnutrition; 
(4) supports increased funding for the crit-
ical programs described in paragraph (3); 
(5) recognizes— 
(A) the importance of medical nutrition 
therapy under the Medicare program under 
title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 
U.S.C. 1395 et seq.); and 
(B) the need for vulnerable populations to 
have access to nutrition counseling; 
(6) recognizes the importance of the inno-
vative research conducted by the National 
Institutes of Health on— 
(A) nutrition, dietary patterns, and the 
human gastrointestinal microbiome; and 
(B) how those factors influence the preven-
tion or development of chronic disease 
throughout the lifespan; 
(7) supports access to malnutrition screen-
ing and assessment for all patients; 
(8) encourages the Centers for Medicare 
and Medicaid Services to evaluate the imple-
mentation of newly-approved malnutrition 
electronic clinical quality measures; and 
(9) acknowledges— 
(A) the importance of access to healthy 
food for children, especially in child care set-
tings and schools; and

Whereas the logging industry has served as 
an economic driver and cultural tradition in 
the United States for centuries; 
Whereas the logging industry creates rural 
jobs and provides revenue for local and State 
governments and National Forests; 
Whereas loggers provide renewable mate-
rial for products used by people in the United 
States every day; 
Whereas loggers are the first link in the 
$300,000,000,000 domestic forest products sup-
ply chain; 
Whereas loggers are the means by which 
healthy forest management plans are accom-
plished; 
Whereas logging provides for healthy for-

790—CON-
DEMNING THE ATROCITIES THAT 
OCCURRED IN ATLANTA, GEOR-

PREMACIST MOBS BRUTALIZED,

REAFFIRMING THE COMMITMENT

HATRED, INJUSTICE, AND WHITE 
SUPREMACY 
Mr. OSSOFF submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 790 
Whereas the horrific act of lynching im-
pacted race relations in the United States 
and shaped the geographic, political, social, 
and economic conditions of Black people in 
ways that are still relevant today; 
Whereas more than 4,400 Black people were 
lynched across 20 States between 1877 and 
1950, 594 of whom were Black victims in 
Georgia and 36 of those documented victims 
were killed in Fulton County; 
Whereas, until 1906, Atlanta, Georgia, was 
home to more than 50,000 Black residents, 
many of whom owned homes and businesses 
in the city; 
Whereas, on September 22, 1906, at 9 p.m., 
10,000 White men and boys gathered at the 
corner of Pryor and Decatur Streets, an area 
known as Five Points in downtown Atlanta; 
Whereas the mob was motivated by the 
media’s false coverage of Black men brutal-
izing White women;

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4917 
September 21, 2022 
Whereas city officials, which included 
Mayor James G. Woodward, attempted to 
calm the crowds but failed to do so; 
Whereas, going through Decatur Street, 
Pryor Street, Central Avenue, and through-
out the central business district, assaulting 
hundreds of Black people, the mob of White 
men and boys continued to hunt and kill At-
lanta’s Black residents into the night; 
Whereas, in an attempt to control the mob, 
Mayor Woodward called the fire department 
out to disperse the mob using large streams 
of water, but the mob quickly regathered 
and continued to shoot and stone Atlanta’s 
Black residents; 
Whereas, by Monday, September 24, 1906, 
what is now known as Downtown Atlanta, 
was under military rule; 
Whereas the massacre continued, with 
plans to move outside of the city and into 
Brownsville, a Black community south of 
downtown with about 1,500 residents; 
Whereas the community gathered to pre-
pare and fight back, and with great fear of a 
counterattack they were disarmed by State 
Troops, and more than 250 African American 
men were arrested; 
Whereas, through the duration of the mas-
sacre, armed Black residents defended their 
neighborhoods, both in Brownsville and in 
Dark Town; 
Whereas at least 25 Black residents were 
murdered, 2 White men were killed, hundreds 
of Black residents were wounded, and thou-
sands of Black businesses and homes were 
burned or destroyed; 
Whereas the story of the Atlanta race mas-
sacre is only 1 of many such atrocities and 
horrific incidents, and shows the lasting im-
pact of White supremacy in the United 
States; and 
Whereas the theft of property from Black 
landowners as well as the displacement 
caused by the terrorizing of the Black com-
munity in Atlanta, Georgia, shows how his-
toric racism and injustice have significantly 
contributed to persistent wealth inequality 
between Black and White Americans in the 
United States: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) condemns the actions of the White su-
premacist mobs that drove out Black resi-
dents of Atlanta, Georgia; 
(2) honors the memory of the victims and 
acknowledges the lasting impact that this 
incident has had on the Black community of 
Atlanta, Georgia; 
(3) expresses support for the designation of 
a national day of remembrance for the vic-
tims of forced migrations of Black Ameri-
cans throughout United States history; and 
(4) reaffirms the commitment of the Fed-
eral Government to combat White suprem-
acy and seek reconciliation for racial injus-
tice.

nance Corporation should prioritize pro-

powered fast attack submarine named after 
Oklahoma City, the capital and most popu-
lous city in Oklahoma, and is the second ship 
in the history of the Navy to bear that name. 
(2) The motto of the USS Oklahoma City is 
‘‘The Sooner, The Better’’, which is a testa-
ment to both the spirit of the people of Okla-
homa City and the readiness of the 140-per-
son crew of the USS Oklahoma City. 
(3) The USS Oklahoma City was christened 
and launched on November 2, 1985, sponsored 
by Linda M. Nickles, and was commissioned 
for service on July 9, 1988, with Commander 
Kevin John Reardon as the first commanding 
officer of the submarine.

Oklahoma City, the USS Oklahoma City has 
traveled around the globe multiple times and 
has served in the Mediterranean, the Persian 
Gulf, the Pacific, and, most recently, Apra 
Harbor, Guam. 
(5) In the aftermath of the April 19, 1995, 
bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal 
Building in Oklahoma City, the crew of the 
USS Oklahoma City donated blood in sup-
port of the victims of the deadliest act of 
homegrown terrorism in the history of the 
United States, which resulted in the deaths 
of 168 individuals. 
(6) The USS Oklahoma City was the first 
Navy submarine to transition from naviga-
tion using paper charts to an all-electronic 
navigation suite. 
(7) On Friday, May 20, 2022, the inactiva-
tion ceremony for the USS Oklahoma City 
was held in Puget Sound Naval Shipyard to 
honor nearly 34 years of service. 
(8) Throughout the career of the USS Okla-
homa City, the USS Oklahoma City sup-
ported a range of missions, including anti- 
surface warfare, anti-submarine warfare, tar-
geted strike missions, and intelligence, sur-
veillance, and reconnaissance missions. 
(b) RECOGNITION OF SERVICE.—Congress rec-
ognizes the service of the Los Angeles-class 
attack submarine the USS Oklahoma City 
and the crew of the USS Oklahoma City, who 
served the United States with valor and 
bravery.

States.

(2) the United States should reduce reli-
ance on the People’s Republic of China for 
rare earth minerals through— 
(A) strategic investments in development 
projects, production technologies, and refin-
ing facilities in the United States; or 
(B) in partnership with strategic allies of 
the United States that are reliable trading 
partners, including members of the Quad-
rilateral Security Dialogue; and

countries of the Quadrilateral Security Dia-
logue to promote shared investment and de-
velopment of rare earth minerals.

in the BUILD Act of 2018 (division F of Pub-
lic Law 115–254); and

(1)’’ and inserting ‘‘paragraph (1)(A)’’. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS ON EFFECTIVE AND 
EFFICIENT
MANAGEMENT
OF
THE
BLENDED 
FEDERAL WORKFORCE.— 
(1) DEFINITION.—In this subsection, the 
term ‘‘Executive agency’’ has the meaning 
given the term in section 105 of title 5, 
United States Code. 
(2) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
(A) The implementation of Federal laws 
and the competent administration of Federal 
programs require skilled and capable per-
sonnel. 
(B) Executive agencies depend on a blended 
workforce that includes Federal employees, 
employees of prime contractors and sub-
contractors performing services to Executive 
agencies, and employees of State or local 
governments, nonprofit organizations, or in-
stitutions of higher education performing 
services to Executive agencies under the 
terms of grants and cooperative agreements 
(in this subsection referred to as ‘‘grant-
ees’’), all of whom make essential contribu-
tions to achieving the missions of the Gov-
ernment in service to the people of the 
United States. 
(C) Approximately 2,000,000 Federal em-
ployees help to execute the laws of the 
United States, supplemented by an unknown 
number, estimated to exceed 5,000,000, of em-
ployees of prime contractors, subcontrac-
tors, and grantees providing services to Ex-
ecutive agencies. 
(D) Policymakers, Executive agencies, and 
observers have often focused on individual 
components of the blended workforce, such 
as employees, without considering all com-
ponents or considering the entire blended 
workforce and how all 3 components can 
work most effectively together. 
(E) Executive agencies inhibit their own 
workforce planning and risk making deci-
sions that may reduce the overall efficiency 
and cost effectiveness of the blended work-
force by focusing on only 1 component in iso-
lation. 
(F) 
Establishing 
artificial 
limits 
on 
headcounts or full-time equivalent positions 
for Federal employees, administrators, and 
managerial employees of Executive agencies 
may discourage the employment of interns 
or entry-level employees to build a balanced 
employment pipeline and may inadvertently 
encourage managers to shift work to con-
tractors and grantees for the purpose of com-
plying with such numerical limits, even if 
those decisions are not justified by an ap-
proach to improve the efficiency or cost ef-
fectiveness of the Executive agency’s work. 
(G) The Government Accountability Office 
has identified strategic human capital man-
agement as a high-risk area for the Federal 
Government, adding that critical skills gaps 
‘‘impede the government from cost-effec-
tively serving the public and achieving re-
sults’’. 
(3) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that Executive agencies should— 
(A) manage the entire Federal blended 
workforce, including employees, contractors, 
and grantees, using a comprehensive and ho-
listic approach to advance their missions as 
effectively and cost efficiently as possible, 
within appropriated budgets and without 
using 
artificial 
numerical 
limits 
on 
headcounts or full-time-equivalent positions; 
and 
(B) conduct a holistic review of their 
blended workforce and develop a comprehen-
sive plan to ensure an efficient and cost-ef-
fective blended workforce.

acts over which it has jurisdiction, includ-
ing, as appropriate, incarcerating individuals 
convicted of such acts;

foreign military assignments, trade delega-
tions abroad, or other similar missions, who

tion;

try has taken to prohibit government offi-
cials from participating in, facilitating, or

quate resources available, to civil society or-
ganizations and other institutions to combat 
corruption, 
including 
reporting, 
inves-
tigating, and monitoring; 
(6) whether an independent judiciary or ju-
dicial body in the country is responsible for, 
and effectively capable of, deciding corrup-
tion cases impartially, on the basis of facts 
and in accordance with the law, without any 
improper restrictions, influences, induce-
ments, pressures, threats, or interferences 
(direct or indirect); 
(7) whether the government of the country 
is assisting in international investigations of 
transnational corruption networks and in 
other cooperative efforts to combat signifi-
cant corruption, including, as appropriate, 
cooperating with the governments of other 
countries to extradite corrupt actors;

recognizes the rights of victims of corrup-
tion, ensures their access to justice, and 
takes steps to prevent victims from being 
further victimized or persecuted by corrupt 
actors, government officials, or others; 
(9) whether the government of the country 
protects victims of corruption or whistle-
blowers from reprisal due to such persons 
having assisted in exposing corruption, and 
refrains from other discriminatory treat-
ment of such persons; 
(10) whether the government of the coun-
try is willing and able to recover and, as ap-
propriate, return the proceeds of corruption; 
(11) whether the government of the coun-
try is taking steps to implement financial 
transparency measures in line with the Fi-
nancial Action Task Force recommenda-
tions, including due diligence and beneficial 
ownership transparency requirements;

ruption as the Secretary of State considers 
appropriate.

GOVERNMENT
EFFORTS
TO 
COMBAT CORRUPTION
IN RELATION

At the end of title XII, add the following: 
Subtitle G—Masih Alinejad HUNT Act of 2022 
SEC. 1281. SHORT TITLE. 
This title may be cited as the ‘‘Masih 
Alinejad Harassment and Unlawful Tar-
geting Act of 2022’’ or the ‘‘Masih Alinejad 
HUNT Act of 2022’’. 
SEC. 1282. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds that the Government of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran surveils, harasses, 
terrorizes, tortures, abducts, and murders in-
dividuals 
who 
peacefully 
defend 
human 
rights and freedoms in Iran, and innocent en-
tities and individuals considered by the Gov-
ernment of Iran to be enemies of that re-
gime, including United States citizens on 
United States soil, and takes foreign nation-
als hostage, including in the following in-
stances: 
(1) In 2021, Iranian intelligence agents were 
indicted for plotting to kidnap United States 
citizen, women’s rights activist, and jour-
nalist Masih Alinejad, from her home in New 
York City, in retaliation for exercising her 
rights under the First Amendment to the 
Constitution of the United States. Iranian 
agents allegedly spent at least approxi-
mately half a million dollars to capture the 
outspoken critic of the authoritarianism of 
the Government of Iran, and studied evacu-
ating her by military-style speedboats to 
Venezuela before rendition to Iran. 
(2) Prior to the New York kidnapping plot, 
Ms. Alinejad’s family in Iran was instructed 
by authorities to lure Ms. Alinejad to Tur-
key. In an attempt to intimidate her into si-
lence, the Government of Iran arrested 3 of 
Ms. Alinejad’s family members in 2019, and 
sentenced her brother to 8 years in prison for 
refusing to denounce her.

(3) According to Federal prosecutors, the 
same Iranian intelligence network that al-
legedly plotted to kidnap Ms. Alinejad is 
also targeting critics of the Government of 
Iran who live in Canada, the United King-
dom, and the United Arab Emirates. 
(4) In 2021, an Iranian diplomat was con-
victed in Belgium of attempting to carry out 
a 2018 bombing of a dissident rally in France. 
(5) In 2021, a Danish high court found a 
Norwegian citizen of Iranian descent guilty 
of illegal espionage and complicity in a 
failed plot to kill an Iranian Arab dissident 
figure in Denmark. 
(6) In 2021, the British Broadcasting Cor-
poration (BBC) appealed to the United Na-
tions to protect BBC Persian employees in 
London who suffer regular harassment and 
threats of kidnapping by Iranian government 
agents. 
(7) In 2021, 15 militants allegedly working 
on behalf of the Government of Iran were ar-
rested in Ethiopia for plotting to attack citi-
zens of Israel, the United States, and the 
United Arab Emirates, according to United 
States officials. 
(8) In 2020, Iranian agents allegedly kid-
napped United States resident and Iranian- 
German journalist Jamshid Sharmahd, while 
he was traveling to India through Dubai. Ira-
nian authorities announced they had seized 
Mr. Sharmahd in ‘‘a complex operation’’, and 
paraded him blindfolded on state television. 
Mr. Sharmahd is arbitrarily detained in Iran, 
allegedly facing the death penalty. In 2009, 
Mr. Sharmahd was the target of an alleged 
Iran-directed assassination plot in Glendora, 
California. 
(9) In 2020, the Government of Turkey re-
leased counterterrorism files exposing how 
Iranian authorities allegedly collaborated 
with drug gangs to kidnap Habib Chabi, an 
Iranian-Swedish activist for Iran’s Arab mi-
nority. In 2020, the Government of Iran alleg-
edly lured Mr. Chabi to Istanbul through a 
female agent posing as a potential lover. Mr. 
Chabi was then allegedly kidnapped from 
Istanbul, and smuggled into Iran where he 
faces execution, following a sham trial. 
(10) In 2020, a United States-Iranian citizen 
and an Iranian resident of California pleaded 
guilty to charges of acting as illegal agents 
of the Government of Iran by surveilling 
Jewish 
student 
facilities, 
including 
the 
Hillel Center and Rohr Chabad Center at the 
University 
of 
Chicago, 
in 
addition 
to 
surveilling and collecting identifying infor-
mation about United States citizens and na-
tionals who are critical of the Iranian re-
gime. 
(11) In 2019, 2 Iranian intelligence officers 
at the Iranian consulate in Turkey allegedly 
orchestrated the assassination of Iranian dis-
sident journalist Masoud Molavi Vardanjani, 
who was shot while walking with a friend in 
Istanbul. Unbeknownst to Mr. Molavi, his 
‘‘friend’’ was in fact an undercover Iranian 
agent and the leader of the killing squad, ac-
cording to a Turkish police report. 
(12) In 2019, around 1,500 people were alleg-
edly killed amid a less than 2 week crack-
down by security forces on anti-government 
protests across Iran, including at least an al-
leged 23 children and 400 women. 
(13) In 2019, Iranian operatives allegedly 
lured 
Paris-based 
Iranian 
journalist 
Ruhollah Zam to Iraq, where he was ab-
ducted, and hanged in Iran for sedition. 
(14) In 2019, a Kurdistan regional court con-
victed an Iranian female for trying to lure 
Voice of America reporter Ali Javanmardi to 
a hotel room in Irbil, as part of a foiled Ira-
nian intelligence plot to kidnap and extra-
dite Mr. Javanmardi, a critic of the Govern-
ment of Iran. 
(15) In 2019, Federal Bureau of Investiga-
tion agents visited the rural Connecticut 
home of Iran-born United States author and 
poet Roya Hakakian to warn her that she 
was the target of an assassination plot or-
chestrated by the Government of Iran. 
(16) In 2019, the Government of Denmark 
accused the Government of Iran of directing 
the assassination of Iranian Arab activist 
Ahmad Mola Nissi, in The Hague, and the as-
sassination of another opposition figure, 
Reza Kolahi Samadi, who was murdered near 
Amsterdam in 2015. 
(17) 
In 
2018, 
German 
security 
forces 
searched for 10 alleged spies who were work-
ing for Iran’s al-Quds Force to collect infor-
mation on targets related to the local Jewish 
community, including kindergartens. 
(18) In 2017, Germany convicted a Pakistani 
man for working as an Iranian agent to spy 
on targets including a former German law-
maker and a French-Israeli economics pro-
fessor. 
(19) In 2012, an Iranian American pleaded 
guilty to conspiring with members of the 
Iranian military to bomb a popular Wash-
ington, DC, restaurant with the aim of assas-
sinating the ambassador of Saudi Arabia to 
the United States. 
(20) In 1996, agents of the Government of 
Iran allegedly assassinated 5 Iranian dis-
sident exiles across Turkey, Pakistan, and 
Baghdad, over a 5-month period that year. 
(21) In 1992, the Foreign and Common-
wealth Office of the United Kingdom ex-
pelled 2 Iranians employed at the Iranian 
Embassy in London and a third Iranian on a 
student visa amid allegations they were plot-
ting to kill Indian-born British American 
novelist Salman Rushdie, pursuant to the 
fatwa issued by then supreme leader of Iran, 
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. 
(22) In 1992, 4 Iranian Kurdish dissidents 
were assassinated at a restaurant in Berlin, 
Germany, allegedly by Iranian agents. 
(23) In 1992, singer, actor, poet, and gay Ira-
nian dissident Fereydoun Farrokhzad was 
found dead with multiple stab wounds in his 
apartment in Germany. His death is alleg-
edly the work of Iran-directed agents. 
(24) In 1980, Ali Akbar Tabatabaei, a lead-
ing critic of Iran and then president of the 
Iran Freedom Foundation, was murdered in 
front of his Bethesda, Maryland, home by an 
assassin disguised as a postal courier. The 
Federal Bureau of Investigation had identi-
fied the ‘‘mailman’’ as Dawud Salahuddin, 
born 
David 
Theodore 
Belfield. 
Mr. 
Salahuddin was working as a security guard 
at an Iranian interest office in Washington, 
DC, when he claims he accepted the assign-
ment and payment of $5,000 from the Govern-
ment of Iran to kill Mr. Tabatabaei. 
(25) Other exiled Iranian dissidents alleged 
to have been victims of the Government of 
Iran’s murderous extraterritorial campaign 
include Shahriar Shafiq, Shapour Bakhtiar, 
and Gholam Ali Oveissi. 
(26) Iranian Americans face an ongoing 
campaign of intimidation both in the virtual 
and physical world by agents and affiliates of 
the Government of Iran, which aims to stifle 
freedom of expression and eliminate the 
threat Iranian authorities believe democ-
racy, justice, and gender equality pose to 
their rule.

HONORING KEVIN AND SOURIYNO 
CHEN AS IOWANS OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 21, 2022 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
ask the House of Representatives to join me 
in recognizing brothers Souriyno Chen and 
Kevin Chen as Iowans of the Week. Young 
entrepreneurs Souriyno and Kevin co-own 
Lucky Lotus, a successful, Southeast Asian 
eatery in Des Moines. Since opening their 
doors in October 2019, the Chens have lever-
aged their restaurant to serve up more than 
just delicious local eats. While working through 
significant challenges as new restaurant own-
ers throughout the COVID–19 pandemic, 
they’ve consistently stepped up during difficult 
times to further causes they care about. 
Souriyno and Kevin were no strangers to 
the restaurant business prior to opening Lucky 
Lotus. As the sons of refugees Seng and Dala 
Chen, who owned and operated Cafe´ Fuzion 
on Des Moines’ east side for 15 years, they 
grew up in the industry. The two brothers saw 
an opportunity to share their family’s passion 
for good food with greater Des Moines, a 
place they saw as full of possibilities. They 
wanted to be part of this growing community 
as it moved in a positive direction and con-
tribute to its momentum. 
With so much heart in its premise, it’s no 
surprise that Lucky Lotus has been an engine 
for charitable giving since its inception. As 
Souriyno and Kevin saw the growing success 
of their restaurant, it was important to them to 
leverage this new platform and build on the 
community. They began engaging in efforts 
like raising funds for certain causes and doing 
food drives, always looking for different oppor-
tunities to affect positive change where and 
when they could. 
Through Lucky Lotus, the Chen brothers do-
nated a percentage of their proceeds to the 
Des Moines Chapter of the NAACP during the 
height of the Black Lives Matter movement to 
help eliminate race-based discrimination in our 
state. As hostility and hate crimes against 
Asian Americans were on the rise, they used 
the trending #StopAsianHate outcry to not only 
call for an end to racism and xenophobia in 
Iowa, but also donated a large share of their 
proceeds for a week to the Iowa Asian Alli-
ance. They raised funds to create the Lucky 
Lotus Scholarship in partnership with the Iowa 
Asian Alliance, which was awarded to several 
local students for the first time last year. It was 
originally meant to be one award for one stu-
dent, but the brothers raised enough funds to 
offer three scholarships instead. The Chens 
have found a way to make the Lucky Lotus 
Scholarship an annual award that will now go 
to three young Iowans of Asian descent and 
help them pay for higher education. 
The more Souriyno and Kevin learned about 
the growing conflict in Ukraine in recent 
weeks, they jumped into action. Lucky Lotus 
publicly announced earlier this week that they 
are donating proceeds of various dishes to 
World Central Kitchen, an organization work-
ing on the frontlines in Ukraine to provide hot 
meals to Ukrainian refugees and neighboring 
countries. Iowans interested in learning about 
how they can help the crisis in Ukraine can 
visit the U.S. Department of State’s ‘‘United 
with Ukraine’’ website for more information. 
Souriyno and Kevin understand how power-
ful food can be. It’s a necessary thing for our 
survival and basic comfort, but regardless of 
our different backgrounds or experiences, food 
offers a way to stay better connected and to 
show our care for one another. The Chen 
brothers are telling a story through Southeast 
Asian food, sharing the love of what they grew 
up eating, and making a positive impact on 
issues that matter in the process. They’ll tell 
you Lucky Lotus would not exist without all the 
love and support of the people across the Des 
Moines metro, and I am inspired by how 
they’ve leveraged that support to give back in 
Iowa and beyond. Souriyno and Kevin are 
working every day to make the community a 
better place, whether by donating to causes 
supporting folks from all walks of life or by 
bringing people together over a shared meal. 
I am proud to name them our Iowans of the 
Week.

OPPOSING H.R. 8520, THE COUN-
TERING 
UNTRUSTED 
TELE-
COMMUNICATIONS ABROAD ACT 
HON. PATRICK T. McHENRY 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 21, 2022 
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I rise, 
along with Republican Members of the Finan-
cial Services Committee, Subcommittee on In-
vestor Protection, Entrepreneurship, and Cap-
ital 
Markets—Rep. 
BILL
HUIZENGA, 
Rep. 
FRENCH HILL, Rep. TOM EMMER, Rep. ALEX-
ANDER X. MOONEY, Rep. WARREN DAVIDSON, 
Rep. TREY HOLLINGSWORTH, Rep. ANTHONY 
GONZALEZ, Rep. BRYAN STEIL and Rep. VAN 
TAYLOR, to express our serious concerns with 
H.R. 8520, the Countering Untrusted Tele-
communications Abroad Act. Although this bill 
was referred to the Financial Services Com-
mittee, the referral was waived without under-
standing the bill’s impact on U.S. capital mar-
kets. 
We believe that H.R. 8520 implicates securi-
ties disclosure obligations in a way that runs 
counter to our existing principles-based disclo-
sure framework. As such, H.R. 8520 risks set-
ting a precedent in support of policies that run 
counter to our free-market principles and are 
harmful to the competitiveness of U.S. capital 
markets. 
In particular, we are concerned that H.R. 
8520 requires publicly traded companies to 
make certain disclosures to the Securities and 
Exchange Commission to advance foreign pol-
icy and national security objectives. As we 
have stated on several previous occasions this 
is ineffective. Sanctioning is the most effective 
way to achieve foreign policy and national se-
curity objectives—not our securities laws. 
Hijacking U.S. investment disclosure rules to 
accomplish extraneous policy goals com-
promises the strength of American capital 
markets, disincentivizes companies from going 
or remaining public by increasing compliance 
costs and reduces investment opportunities for 
retail investors and retirement savers. More-
over, the SEC is not the appropriate entity for 
advancing our Nation’s national security or for-
eign policy agenda. Such issues should be 
handled by agencies with expertise in over-
seeing more effective tools like sanctions and 
export controls. 
Similarly, H.R. 8520 inappropriately con-
siders all information of a certain kind ‘‘mate-
rial,’’ in this case information related to con-
tracts for—or usage of—telecommunications 
equipment or services from certain providers. 
Currently, under the Securities Exchange Act 
of 1934, public companies are required to file 
annual reports with the SEC that are made 
public to disclose company information that in-
vestors would find material to making invest-
ment decisions. It is not Congress’ job to tell 
public companies what information is and is 
not material. Instead, it is up to the individual 
company to make that determination on its 
own. Otherwise, companies will be forced to 
increase costs and regulatory risks to comply 
with disclosure obligations that do not materi-
ally influence investment decisions. 
Moreover, this bill is mandating compliance 
with a disclosure regime that requires dis-
closing information that is likely unknowable. 
Specifically, the bill requires that publicly trad-
ed companies disclose if they or ‘‘any affiliate’’ 
used or entered into contracts to use covered 
telecommunications equipment or services. 
Inexplicably, the bill does not define ‘‘any affil-
iate.’’ Still, in many instances, it will be impos-
sible for many companies to know whether 
their affiliates contracted for or used such 
services. To make matters worse, when com-
panies attempt to disclose this impossible-to- 
discern information in a manner that later 
turns out to be mistaken, they would be liable 
for securities fraud. 
The flawed approach set forth in this bill 
sets a dangerous precedent. H.R. 8520 should 
have been marked up in the Financial Serv-
ices Committee prior to floor consideration in 
order to fully debate the policy implications. 
Ultimately, this bill will limit choices for every-
day investors, encourage public companies to 
go private, and weaken the health of U.S. 
public markets. 
For these reasons, we oppose H.R. 8520.

RECOGNIZING TOYS FOR TOTS 
DAY IN MISSOURI 
HON. BILLY LONG 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 21, 2022 
Mr. LONG. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve 
Toys for Tots program and their chapters in 
Southwest Missouri. 
First established in 1947, Toys for Tots is 
celebrating their 75th Anniversary in 2022. 
They have lived up to their mission of pro-
viding toys to the less fortunate ever since 
then, providing over 627 million toys to more 
than 281 million less fortunate children nation-
wide. This is done with the help of local com-
munities during the annual holiday campaign 
lasting from October to Christmas. 
Southwest Missouri has three Toys for Tots 
Campaigns, in Joplin serving Jasper County, 
in Newton serving Newton and McDonald 
Counties, and in Springfield serving Barry, 
Barton, Camden, Cedar, Christian, Dade, Dal-
las, Greene, Hickory, Lawrence, Polk, St. 
Clair, Vernon and Webster Counties. These 
three local Campaigns have done phenomenal 
work in bringing the joy of Christmas to those 
in need. 
Missouri Governor Mike Parson has pro-
claimed October 1, 2022, to be Toys for Tots 
Day across the State of Missouri. I join Gov-
ernor Parson and the Missouri General As-
sembly in congratulating Toys for Tots on their 
75th Anniversary and wish them continued 
success for the next 75 years.

HONORING COOPER WERNER LOWE 
HON. SAM GRAVES 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 21, 2022 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam Speaker,

zenship and leadership by taking an active

Eagle Scout. 
Cooper has been very active with his troop, 
participating in many scout activities. Over the

scouting, he has not only earned 23 merit 
badges, but also the respect of his family, 
peers, and community. Most notably, Cooper 
has served 2 terms as Patrol Leader and also 
served as Troop Chaplain. Cooper has also 
contributed to his community through his 
Eagle Scout project. Cooper coordinated and 
led the construction of a 12 x 16 storage shed 
behind a church that the Lowes attended. 
Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join 
me in commending Cooper Werner Lowe for 
his accomplishments with the Boy Scouts of 
America and for his efforts put forth in achiev-
ing the highest distinction of Eagle Scout. 
CELEBRATING 75 YEARS OF THE 
PHOENIX INDIAN CENTER 
HON. RUBEN GALLEGO 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 21, 2022 
Mr. GALLEGO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the Phoenix Indian Center, 
which celebrates its 75th anniversary this 
year. 
Founded in 1947, the Phoenix Indian Center 
is the oldest American Indian non-profit orga-
nization of its kind in the United States. Origi-
nally established to help Native Americans 
who traveled to downtown Phoenix to sell arts 
and crafts to support their families, the non- 
profit has successfully expanded its services 
to offer exemplary employment, education, 
cultural enrichment, and community engage-
ment services for urban Native Americans. Ad-
ditionally, the Phoenix Indian Center has con-
tinuously achieved its goal to ‘‘keep families 
intact and help them maneuver through dif-
ficult situations they may encounter.’’ 
By implementing their core values of integ-
rity, accountability, adaptability, and respect, 
the Phoenix Indian Center has established re-
sources such as job preparedness workshops, 
youth services, housing assistance, scholar-
ships, and many others that have positive im-
pacts throughout the Native American commu-
nity. For 75 transformative years, I thank the 
Phoenix Indian Center, and I look forward to 
seeing what they accomplish next for our com-
munity.

STANDING UP FOR DOWNWINDERS 
UNDER THE RADIATION EXPO-
SURE 
COMPENSATION 
ACT 
(RECA) 
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 21, 2022 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in continued support of the reauthorization of 
the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act 
(RECA). I first learned about RECA through 
my constituents over 10 years ago, and since 
then I have been determined to get justice for 
the victims of reckless federal government 
policies that injured thousands. 
From 1945 to 1962, the United States gov-
ernment, through its military, conducted nearly 
200 atmospheric weapons development tests 
as part of our nation’s Cold War security strat-
egy during an era when other nations were 
also engaged in nuclear weapons testing and 
proliferation. These tests exposed millions of 
innocent Americans to potentially cancer-caus-
ing ionized radiation from nuclear fallout. It is 
hard to believe today, but for over a decade 
the military was blasting tons of radioactive 
material into our skies. And this was the mili-
tary that was supposed to protect Americans. 
One report, from the University of Kansas, 
explained that ‘‘enormous clouds, pinkish-gray 
in color, rose up into the air, spreading out 
and reaching over nearby communities. At the 
time, not much information about these tests 
was available to the public, but the radioactive 
dust that fell from the clouds—gathering on 
people’s homes, their cars, their clothes lines, 
and their vegetable gardens—caused serious 
and harmful long-term medical issues.’’ 
The report further documents just one per-
son’s experience with the radiation delivered 
over their farm in Utah: 
‘‘Not till the 1960s were we really aware of 
the danger of those fallout materials. Mom 
and Dad were told that there was nothing to 
worry about, it wasn’t going to harm any-
body. And then people started getting sick! 
And passing away! And thyroid cancer was a 
big one, it was huge . . . and then our family 
lost that sweet little baby. Dad still thinks 
that it’s the milk Mom drank, and then Mom 
later on got colon cancer, and none of that 
has ever shown up in her family. There’s no 
sign of colon cancer anywhere in the family. 
And Mom died with colon cancer, and Dad 
and Warren were plagued with skin cancer, 
and I’ve had a bit of skin cancer myself. It’s 
always a worry because, the people realized 
that the government were lying to them! 
Literally lying to them. And it just was sad, 
it was a sad situation.’’ 
When the injuries were discovered, Con-
gress subsequently provided an apology on 
behalf of the nation and passed the Radiation 
Exposure Compensation Act of 1990, or 
RECA, to establish a trust fund for partial res-
titution to individuals—commonly referred to 
as ‘‘Downwinders’’—who have contracted cer-
tain cancers and other serious diseases that 
can be directly attributed to the radiation expo-
sure from the nuclear weapons testing. 
The spread of radioactive material was not 
limited to Arizona, Utah and Nevada. It went 
essentially nationwide. The University of Kan-
sas states, ‘‘While the areas surrounding test 
sites in the southwestern states are some of 
the most heavily affected, air currents carried 
the radioactive particles all over the country, 
and even beyond the borders of the U.S.’’ 
This information came from the National Can-
cer Institute. 
RECA was and is an effort to provide some 
very minimal compensation for the radiation 
victims. RECA is all we have now, even 
though it was too little and too late for many. 
I have long led legislation that would reau-
thorize RECA and expand eligibility for 
Downwinders compensation by including quali-
fied individuals who were exposed in any part 
of Clark County, Nevada, or Mohave County, 
Arizona—immediately downwind jurisdictions 
from the testing site that have been excluded 
from compensation for decades due to a draft-
ing error. The exclusion of my constituents in 
Mohave County, Arizona is an egregious injus-
tice. It’s clear that the original legislative intent 
was to include all of Mohave County and that 
the partial exclusion is a drafting error in the 
statutory text: In 1990, RECA was passed with 
Mohave County included. Then in 2000, S. 
1515 amended RECA expanding qualification 
to additional counties. The expansion of com-
pensation to additional counties did not seek 
to exclude any jurisdiction. It only sought to 
‘‘increase’’ Downwinders compensation to ad-
ditional counties. In amending the Act, the 
House of Representatives stated in the House 
Report that Congress’s goal in amending the 
Act was to ‘‘increase’’ the existing Downwinder 
areas to ‘‘include’’ additional areas. The 
House report makes clear that the drafters 
sought to increase the area that had been 
covered under the prior version and to add 
new counties. In reality, Congress added new 
counties to the affected area but also mistak-
enly eliminated a large portion of Mohave 
County. In short, legal malpractice in drafting

the statute cut out more than half of Mohave 
County, one of the most impacted counties in 
the U.S. 
The statutory text is at odds with the stated 
goals of House Report 106–697 which states 
‘‘S. 1515 would increase the Downwinder ‘‘af-
fected area’’ to include . . . the counties of 
Coconino, Yavapai, Navajo, Apache, and Gila 
in Arizona.’’ It says nothing about excluding 
any county. This drafting error has had a di-
rect impact on people’s health and safety and 
has cost many of my constituents the com-
pensation they deserve. I call for immediate 
rectification of RECA to clarify that the original 
text and later amendments never sought to 
exclude my constituents in Mohave County, 
Arizona from qualifying for Downwinders com-
pensation. 
But Madam Speaker, there is more. As the 
maps demonstrate, radioactive fallout was 
documented across the United States. It is not 
just Mohave County that should be included 
under RECA, but all contiguous 48 states. 
There is evidence of fallout in every state. 
Only the furthest west areas, such as L.A. es-
caped radiation. But Eastern California was 
exposed. For that reason, I am urging an 
amendment to RECA as we reauthorize it: 
RECA should allow claims from any person 
who lived in a documented radiation zone dur-
ing the test years that later developed a can-
cer related to radiation exposure. 
The government sacrificed its people to test 
the bombs. Moralists can argue if that was the 
right thing to do at the time. But today, 70 
years later, the moral debate is irrelevant. The 
people have been hurt. Families devasted. 
They were unwittingly sacrificed as foot sol-
diers in a war they did not sign up for. At a 
minimum, the federal government today has 
the moral obligation to recognize their sacrifice 
and compensate the victims.

UNITED STATES COMMISSION ON 
INTERNATIONAL 
RELIGIOUS 
FREEDOM 
REAUTHORIZATION 
ACT OF 2022 
SPEECH OF 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 19, 2022 
Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support 
of S. 3895, the U.S. Commission on Inter-
national Religious Freedom (USCIRF) Reau-
thorization Act. This bipartisan legislation reau-
thorizes USCIRF through 2024 and dem-
onstrates strong congressional support for its 
mission of promoting religious freedom as a 
core objective of U.S. foreign policy. 
As the daughter of immigrants who fled reli-
gious persecution abroad, I believe the U.S. 
has a responsibility to stand up for the rights 
of religious minorities around the world. That’s 
why I’m proud to have joined Congressman 
CHRIS SMITH in introducing H.R. 7829, the 
House companion of S. 3895. I’m grateful to 
Rep. SMITH for partnering with me on this leg-
islation and for his unwavering commitment to 
ensuring that all people can practice the reli-
gion of their choice without fear of persecu-
tion. 
In 1998, Congress established USCIRF, an 
independent commission dedicated to pro-
moting religious freedom through U.S. foreign 
policy. In the years since its founding, the 
Commission has lived up to its mandate by 
issuing incisive reports about religious free-
dom conditions abroad, advising Congress 
and Executive Branch officials, and sounding 
the alarm when religious persecution occurs. 
Importantly, the Commission is independent 
from the State Department, ensuring that its 
assessments of religious freedom conditions 
abroad are not influenced by, or perceived to 
be influenced by, other U.S. foreign policy in-
terests. 
We live in an era in which religious freedom 
is threatened in much of the world. The Chi-
nese government is perpetrating genocide 
against Uyghur Muslims; Christians in Iraq and 
Syria have been subjected to ethnic strife and 
the ravages of war; and the Burmese junta 
continues its horrific genocidal campaign 
against the Rohingya minority. It’s clear that 
USCIRF’s work is as important today as ever 
before. 
By reauthorizing USCIRF on a bipartisan 
basis, Congress will demonstrate strong sup-
port for the Commission and its critical work to 
promote religious freedom abroad. I urge my 
colleagues to stand with the persecuted reli-
gious minorities of the world by supporting this 
legislation.

RECOGNIZING BIOHIVE UTAH 
HON. BURGESS OWENS 
OF UTAH 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 21, 2022 
Mr. OWENS. Madam Speaker, on Decem-
ber 2, 1982, the medical team from the Uni-
versity of Utah successfully implanted the first 
permanent artificial heart in the world. 
Forty years later, Utah remains a trailblazer 
in healthcare innovation. 
Over the past two years, I had the pleasure 
of visiting many Utah businesses at the fore-
front of the healthcare industry. I would like to 
highlight the impressive work a few of our 
homegrown companies are accomplishing in 
the healthcare space. 
The team at Ortho Development Corpora-
tion works to restore mobility by perfecting the 
design, manufacturing, and distribution of sur-
gical instruments used for total knee and hip 
replacements. 
Xenter specializes in developing new wire-
less medical device technologies and digital 
health tools to address the latest challenges in 
medicine while helping Utahns manage their 
health information. 
Canyon Labs is an accredited laboratory 
providing testing, scientific and technical con-
sulting, and clinical research services for med-
ical 
devices, 
pharmaceuticals, 
over 
the 
counter drugs, and biologics. 
Ultradent is a global dental manufacturing 
company improving oral health throughout the 
world and ranked No. 9 best workplace by 
Fortune magazine. 
My state’s pro-innovation regulatory environ-
ment, advanced medical infrastructure, and 
highly skilled workforce work in tandem to ce-
ment Utah’s invaluable role in the life sciences 
community. 
Biohive, a collaboration of more than 1,100 
companies representing Utah’s life science 
and healthcare innovation ecosystem, is the 
driving force behind the beehive state’s suc-
cess. The collective effort of local government, 
the private sector, and other stakeholders fa-
cilitated by the Biohive initiative has delivered 
remarkable results. 
Utah is ranked No. 6 in the Nation for med-
ical device development, and No. 5 for 
diagnostics development. Utah also serves as 
the epicenter for lifesaving catheter tech-
nologies and is a rising force in bio-pharma. 
Additionally, the Bioscience industry in Utah 
supports 130,000 local jobs, accounts for 8 
percent of GDP, and produces hundreds of 
patents for lifesaving medical devices. 
Behind 
these 
extraordinary 
accomplish-
ments are the pioneering spirit, grit, and kind-
ness of Utahns. I am proud to represent the 
beautiful state of Utah, and I hope Utah’s suc-
cess story serves as the blueprint for other 
states to emulate.

HONORING THE COURAGEOUS LIFE 
AND SERVICE OF ROBERT C. SHAW 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 21, 2022 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Robert C. Shaw, for his coura-
geous service in the United States Navy. 
Robert Shaw was born in 1924 in Saratoga 
County, New York. At the age of 19, Bob 
joined the United States Navy as a torpedo 
man’s mate on the USS Tigrone. Bob and the 
USS Tigrone began their war patrol at Pearl 
Harbor and then set off for Guam for engine 
repairs. The fleet then made their way to the 
South China Sea to help identify and intercept 
Japanese shipping boats. Beginning in April 
1945, Bob and his fleet performed lifeguard 
duties off the coast of Hainan until Japan sur-
rendered in August of 1945. 
Bob was discharged from the Navy on De-
cember 21, 1945 at the rank of Seaman First 
Class. For his brave and selfless service, he 
was awarded the Victory Medal, the American 
Campaign Medal, and the Asiatic Pacific Cam-
paign Medal. 
Following his time in the Navy, Bob contin-
ued to lead a life full of service to country and 
community. 
After 
being 
discharged, 
Bob 
bought and lived on two farms, where he or-
ganized a 4-H Club for local youth to mentor 
and educate them on proper farm practices. 
Bob was also an active member of Optimist 
International, a worldwide volunteer organiza-
tion, and the Freemasons. 
In addition to his volunteer work, Bob con-
tributed to the local community in a variety of 
ways. Bob owned and operated several local 
businesses including the Stage Coach Inn, the 
Crossroads, the General Store in Wilton, and 
Shaw Fuel, which is still in operation today. 
Throughout his life, Bob showed exceptional 
dedication to serving his country and his local 
community. I am proud to honor Bob with the 
Saratoga County Veterans Association as part 
of the monthly Honor our Deceased Veterans 
Ceremony. On behalf of the 21st District of 
New York, I would like to thank Bob Shaw and 
his family for their service to the country and 
community.

CELEBRATING THE UNVEILING OF 
THE FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN 
VETERANS MONUMENT IN BUF-
FALO, NEW YORK 
HON. BRIAN HIGGINS 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 21, 2022 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam Speak-
er, today I join the Western New York commu-
nity in celebrating and honoring the service of 
African American veterans throughout the his-
tory of the United States military. For decades, 
our country ignored the unjust conditions in 
which African Americans had served in our 
armed forces. When others returned home 
from war, they were heralded as heroes. 
When African Americans returned home from 
war, our nation denied their humanity and their 
equal rights. Thankfully, a committee in Buf-
falo, New York has dedicated its time and en-
ergy into recognizing this reality. Now, the Afri-
can American Veterans Monument will stand 
on the Buffalo waterfront as a constant re-
minder to all its citizens of the immense sac-
rifices that have been made. 
From the Revolutionary War to the present 
day, millions of African Americans have 
served this country with valor. There are cur-
rently more than 360,000 African American 
soldiers in our military. We have an additional 
2.1 million African American veterans. Over 
200,000 African Americans served in the 
Union Army during the Civil War and over 1 
million African Americans served in WWII. In 
total, 89 African Americans have been award-
ed the Medal of Honor, the most prestigious 
military decoration awarded to U.S. service 
members. This type of unquestionable loyalty 
and service cannot go unrecognized. Leaders 
in the Western New York community, led by 
New York State Assembly Majority Leader 
Crystal Peoples-Stokes, were not about to let 
that happen. 
This monument will honor our African Amer-
ican veterans in the same way they served 
our country: with integrity, strength, and resil-
ience. The first of its kind, this monument will 
be unveiled on September 24, 2022, at Buffalo 
and Erie County Naval & Military Park. The 
date commemorates the anniversary of the 
preliminary Emancipation Proclamation Act, 
the law that first allowed African Americans to 
join the armed forces. Every aspect of this 
monument was carefully constructed. It will 
feature twelve black concrete pillars to sym-
bolize all twelve major campaigns that African 
Americans have fought in. The top of each pil-
lar is illuminated to represent the candles that 
families would put in windows to guide their 
soldiers to safety. These lights will continu-
ously glow to remind us that service does not 
end when a soldier comes home; it is a com-
mitment that can never be properly repaid. 
Nevertheless, I trust that the African Amer-
ican Veterans Monument can be the first of 
many steps to thoroughly appreciate our brave 
and selfless veterans in the African American 
community. I am so proud to represent count-
less African American veterans and those who 
recognized the necessity of this monument. 
This is long overdue. 
HONORING 70 YEARS OF THE MIS-
SOURI AND ASSOCIATED RIVERS 
COALITION (MOARC) 
HON. SHARICE DAVIDS 
OF KANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 21, 2022 
Ms. DAVIDS of Kansas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize the 70th anniversary of 
the Missouri and Associated Rivers Coalition 
(MOARC). Since its inception, MOARC and its 
members have tirelessly served the greater 
Kansas City region. 
MOARC was formed in 1952, following a 
flood, with the goal of implementing better 
water management. Membership today con-
sists of organizations, associations, compa-
nies, governmental units, and individuals, all of 
whom are interested in establishing better 
flood control programs and supporting con-
servation of land-water resources. 
Since its creation, MOARC’s members have 
fiercely advocated for the Kansas Third District 
and the rest of the region, advocating for 
projects like the Bush Creek Basin. Without 
their efforts, it might not be recognized as the 
cultural corridor of Kansas City. And thanks to 
their work advocating for projects like the St. 
Joseph Levee and Line Creek Watershed, the 
region is better positioned to take action on 
important infrastructure needs. 
I’ve also had the pleasure of supporting 
MOARC’s work while in Congress. Last year, 
I joined local officials to tour the Upper Turkey 
Creek levee project, for which I secured fund-
ing and MOARC supported. 
I look forward to continuing my strong rela-
tionship with MOARC, their exceptional mem-
bers, and their local land-water conservation 
efforts. Here’s to many more years of respon-
sible waterway stewardship in the greater 
Kansas City region.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF REVEREND MICHAEL RUSSO 
HON. MARK DeSAULNIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 21, 2022 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the life of Reverend Mi-
chael Russo. 
Throughout his life, Michael demonstrated 
his dedication to his faith and his passion for 
education. He earned his bachelor’s in com-
munications and later his Master of Divinity 
from Seton Hall University. Michael became 
an ordained minister in 1971 and was known 
from that point on as Father Mike. Father Mike 
was especially interested in political commu-
nications and American journalism. He earned 
a Ph.D. in American Social and Political His-
tory from New York University (NYU). His doc-
toral dissertation, which focused on CBS 
News’s impact on American politics, received 
the 1983 Bayrd Still Award in Historical Writ-
ing. 
Father Mike was eager to share his knowl-
edge and passion for U.S. history with future 
generations. He began his career as an edu-
cator teaching Religion and Communication 
Studies at Seton Hall. He later served as chair 
of Seton Hall’s Religious Studies Department. 
He began teaching Political Communication at 
Saint Mary’s College in the early 1980s and 
was later appointed as chair of the Academic 
Senate and chair of the Communication De-
partment. Father Mike was adored among the 
Saint Mary’s community and has touched 
countless students’ lives. 
Father Mike worked closely with CBS News 
for many years, offering his expert analysis on 
papal happenings. His partnership with CBS 
began when Mike was still in college, serving 
as Walter Cronkite’s desk assistant. Father 
Mike was later asked by CBS to cover events 
surrounding the Pope where he provided his 
expertise to a global audience. Father Mike 
had the honor of travelling with Pope John 
Paul II on ‘‘Shepard One’’ when His Holiness 
visited Northern California in 1987. 
Sadly, Mike passed away on August 10, 
2022. He is survived by his brother Joseph 
and his wife Anita, his sister Marian, his 
nieces and nephews, Leah, AJ, Philip, Bettina, 
Tim, William, Josephine, and Julian, and many 
other loving family members, friends, col-
leagues, and parishioners. Father Mike will be 
remembered for his wisdom, compassion, and 
commitment to his faith. He will be deeply 
missed. Please join us in honoring Reverend 
Michael Russo for his many contributions to 
our community and to our Nation.

COMMEMORATING THE 100TH ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE RED ARROW 
DINER 
HON. CHRIS PAPPAS 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 21, 2022 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in honor of the 100th Anniversary of the Red 
Arrow Diner in Manchester, New Hampshire. 
As one of the most popular diners on the East 
Coast, the Red Arrow Diner enjoys a special 
place in the folklore of our state and remains 
a popular destination for locals, celebrities, 
politicians, and tourists alike. 
Dating back to the diner’s opening in Octo-
ber of 1922, the Red Arrow cemented its leg-
acy in downtown Manchester as a quaint, fam-
ily-friendly locale with a knack for home- 
cooked meals guaranteed to please even the 
most skeptical palate. This tiny little diner on 
Lowell Street flourished into a major chain that 
today employs one hundred and seventy-five 
people and has expanded operations to Con-
cord, Londonderry, and Nashua. Despite this 
massive growth, the Red Arrow remains com-
mitted to the values of its founders: serving 
customers with a smile and delivering con-
sistent, quality home cooked meals. 
The Red Arrow Diner’s success can be at-
tributed in large part to the efforts of Carol 
Lawrence, her father George Lawrence, and 
Amanda Wihby. Their vision for this diner has 
made the Red Arrow a must-visit destination 
for visitors from out of state, and their dedica-
tion to the state of New Hampshire will ensure 
that the Red Arrow remains a vital part of our 
state culture for another 100 years. On behalf 
of my constituents in New Hampshire’s First 
Congressional District, I thank the Red Arrow 
Diner and its management for 100 years of 
outstanding contributions to our state.

INTRODUCTION OF THE FERRY 
SERVICE EXPANSION ACT 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 21, 2022 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, today I 
introduce the ‘‘Ferry Service Expansion Act’’ 
with U.S. Senator PATTY MURRAY (D–WA). I 
want to thank my House colleagues for their 
support as original cosponsors of this bipar-
tisan legislation. 
Ferries are among the most climate-resilient 
modes of public transportation, capable of 
reaching areas where it is infeasible or impru-
dent to build new bridges or causeways. His-
torically, Congress has underfunded public 
ferry service compared to other transit and 
roadway projects. Our ‘‘Ferry Service Expan-
sion Act’’ would correct this by increasing 
funding for both the Federal Highway Adminis-
tration’s (FHWA) formula and the Federal 
Transit Administration (FTA) competitive grant 
programs to the levels requested by the Public 
Ferry Coalition, which represents public ferry 
operators across the country. 
In the Bay Area, the San Francisco Bay 
Area Water Emergency Transportation Author-
ity (WETA) is working to expand ferry service 
for commuters and visitors alike. WETA is also 
retrofitting its existing diesel-powered ferries to 
reduce emissions of particulates and green-
house gases, WETA is pursuing new, zero- 
emissions ferries to eventually replace its en-
tire vessel fleet. The ‘‘Ferry Service Expansion 
Act’’ would provide federal support for this im-
portant work, while also holding federal grant-
ees to the high standards for ‘‘Buy American’’ 
requirements and prevailing wages under the 
Davis-Bacon Act that already apply to other 
federal funding for ferries. 
Under current law, States may use their fed-
eral 
Surface 
Transportation 
Block 
Grant 
(STBG) for public or private ferry projects. In 
December 2020, the Bay Area Council re-
leased a feasibility study for employing hover-
craft to provide ferry service in the South Bay. 
Hovercrafts can provide ferry service in envi-
ronmentally sensitive areas that cannot be 
dredged to sufficient depth for vessels. Sec-
tion 4 of the ‘‘Ferry Service Expansion Act’’ 
would simply clarify that States could use their 
STBG for hovercraft ferries, provided the 
project is otherwise eligible under the program 
as providing ferry service to the public. On 
July 1, 2021, the House passed this same 
provision as my amendment to Chairman 
PETER A. DEFAZIO’s (D–OR) ‘‘Investing in a 
New Vision for the Environment and Surface 
Transportation (INVEST) in America Act.’’ 
Lastly, our bicameral, bipartisan legislation 
would also support private operators of pas-
senger ferries by allowing them to register 
Capital Construction Funds with the Maritime 
Administration (MARAD). Capital Construction 
Funds allow vessel operators to forgo paying 
federal business taxes on such vessels pro-
vided all that forgone tax payment is rein-
vested in constructing new U.S.-flagged ves-
sels in American shipyards. Under current law, 
only cargo vessels and commercial fishing 
boats are eligible for this special tax exemp-
tion. However, some car ferry operators suc-
cessfully 
registered 
Capital 
Construction 
Funds with MARAD, arguing that the cars are 
‘‘cargo’’ and therefore their vessels are a 
‘‘cargo vessel’’ and not a ‘‘ferry.’’ The ‘‘Ferry 
Service Expansion Act’’ corrects this discrep-
ancy by ensuring that passenger ferries are 
also clearly eligible. On March 29, 2022, the 
House passed this same provision from my 
H.R. 6882 as part of the ‘‘Don Young Coast 
Guard Authorization Act of 2022’’ (H.R. 6865). 
As a senior member of the House Com-
mittee on Transportation and Infrastructure, I 
continue working to secure additional federal 
funding to complement the state, county, and 
local investments to improve ferry service 
across the Bay Area. I plan to work with Sen-
ator MURRAY to make this legislation a priority. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage all members of 
the House to join us in cosponsoring the 
‘‘Ferry Service Expansion Act.’’
