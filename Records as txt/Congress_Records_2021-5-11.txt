PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Almighty God, You have called us, 
and we are Yours. We pray this day 
that our lawmakers would respond to 
this calling with worthiness, keenly 
aware of the privilege that it is You 
who have sent them into the leadership 
of this country. 
May they receive this mantle of re-
sponsibility 
with 
all 
humility, 
gentleness, and patience. May they 
demonstrate eagerness to maintain the 
unity of the spirit who binds this body 
together in peace, bearing with all oth-
ers around them, in the manner of un-
conditional love You Yourself have re-
vealed to Your sons and daughters. 
Help us each to live into the occupa-
tions to which You have called us. In 
living out the lives You have given us 
and in interacting with those into 
whose company You have brought us, 
may we build one another up in faith 
and love. May words of truth and not 
evil spill from our mouths. 
When we are angry, keep us from sin-
ning one against the other. As Mem-
bers of one body, may we show grace in 
our encounters and, when necessary, 
offer forgiveness even as You, in Your 
divine mercy, have forgiven us. 
It is in Your merciful name we pray. 
Amen.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2158 
May 11, 2021 
WELCOMING 
THE 
HONORABLE 
TROY CARTER OF LOUISIANA TO 
THE 
HOUSE 
OF 
REPRESENTA-
TIVES 
The SPEAKER. Without objection, 
the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. 
SCALISE) is recognized for 1 minute. 
There was no objection. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, it is 
with great honor on behalf of the en-
tire Louisiana delegation that we wel-
come TROY CARTER into the congres-
sional delegation. Of course, for TROY, 
this is not his first time in public serv-
ice. In fact, he has committed his life 
to public service. He served in the 
State legislature in the House of Rep-
resentatives, 
then 
served 
multiple 
terms on the New Orleans City Council, 
and then went back to the State legis-
lature serving as a senator. In fact, 
until last week, he served with distinc-
tion in the Louisiana State Senate. 
He is replacing, of course, our dear 
former colleague, Cedric Richmond, 
and we are proud to see Cedric make 
his way down Pennsylvania Avenue to 
come over here to the House to be a 
part of this special ceremony. 
Speaking on behalf of the entire Lou-
isiana delegation, Madam Speaker, we 
look forward to continuing that great 
tradition as Republicans and Demo-
crats working together for the best in-
terests of our great State of Louisiana 
as well as for the Nation. 
We welcome TROY CARTER to the del-
egation and to the United States Con-
gress. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to Congress-
man TROY CARTER. 
Mr. CARTER of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I thank Mr. SCALISE for his 
very kind words and wonderful intro-
duction. 
First, a very special thanks to my 
wife, Ana, who is behind me, my chil-
dren, my family, my team, my friends, 
and all of my amazing supporters. No 
one runs for office alone, and they were 
all there with me every step of the way 
from the very beginning. 
To God be the glory. From the Cut 
Off to the Congress, God is amazing. 
My mother, who could not be with us 
here today, Pastor Eartha Fleming 
Carter, taught her children the impor-
tance of public service. I promise I will 
never forget those lessons. I will con-
tinue to listen to the concerns, the 
hopes, and the dreams of my district. I 
will work for and be the voice of the 
people. 
Worldwide, my district is known for 
Mardi Gras, great food, our amazing 
culture bearers, and as the birthplace 
of jazz. Just as importantly, it has 3 of 
the top 10 ports in the U.S., a vibrant 
manufacturing base, renowned univer-
sities, rich agricultural production, 
and we are the gateway to space 
through the Michoud Assembly Facil-
ity in eastern New Orleans. 
My district also has a lot of needs: 
COVID recovery, economic develop-
ment, 
infrastructure 
investment, 
criminal justice reform, environmental 
justice, and education, to name a few. 
I am here to serve my district, and I 
believe we can help all of our people 
reach their full potential. 
I commit to working with everyone 
in the Congress and the White House to 
address those needs and to stand strong 
when those needs are not being ad-
dressed. 
I am honored to have been given this 
opportunity to serve, and I will do so 
with every fiber of my very being. 
I always seek God’s guidance, and I 
will continue to do that as I serve the 
people of Louisiana and this great 
country. I will lead with honor and in-
tegrity. 
May God continue to bless Louisiana 
and these United States of America. 
f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
The SPEAKER. Under clause 5(d) of 
rule XX, the Chair announces to the 
House that, in light of the administra-
tion of the oath of office to the gen-
tleman from Louisiana (Mr. CARTER) 
the whole number of the House is 431. 
f 
SUPPORTING OUR HEROES 
(Mr. BERA asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. BERA. Madam Speaker, today we 
will be considering the Helping Emer-
gency Responders Overcome Act, or the 
HERO Act. 
This has been an unprecedented time 
of stress and pressure on our first re-
sponders: firefighters, police officers, 
and our frontline healthcare workers. 
This is a no-nonsense bill that will pro-
vide necessary resources to understand 
first responder suicide and pressure, 
but also to provide grants to provide 
peer-to-peer 
conversation 
and 
proactive reaching out to these first re-
sponders who are our heroes. 
So, again, I urge all my colleagues to 
pass this bill unanimously. It has 
passed previously. It will make a dif-
ference, and it will help save lives and 
help treat these heroes as they have 
taken care of us. 
f 
NATIONAL POLICE WEEK 
(Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, during National Police Week, 
it is my honor to pay tribute to all of 
the men and women who put their lives 
on the line to serve and protect all of 
our communities. 
In Pennsylvania and around the 
country, including here in Congress, 
dedicated 
law 
enforcement 
officers 
show up for work every day and quietly 
do the job that we have entrusted to 
them. They uphold the law, they pro-
mote safety, and, most importantly, 
they preserve human life. 
Far too often these officers, unfortu-
nately, do not come home. Today I ask 
that the American people join me in re-
membering our Nation’s fallen police 
officers and honoring their service and 
their sacrifice. 
More than a profession, law enforce-
ment is truly a calling. Whether on the 
streets of Pennsylvania, on our bor-
ders, or across our great Nation, I 
thank our law enforcement officers for 
answering the call to serve the Amer-
ican people.

b 1415 
CHILD TAX CREDIT IN AMERICAN 
RESCUE PLAN 
(Ms. SCANLON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to talk about the exciting new 
child tax credit that is part of the 
American Rescue Plan. I know the 
words ‘‘exciting’’ and ‘‘tax credit’’ 
don’t usually belong in the same sen-
tence, but this is different. 
With the child tax credit, families 
with children under the age of 17 will 
receive $250 per child per month and 
$300 per month for kids under 6. These 
monthly payments can help cover ev-
eryday child-rearing expenses—things 
like food, diapers, or shoes for the teen-
ager who outgrows his every 6 weeks. 
More than 119,000 children in my dis-
trict will benefit from the new child 
tax credit, including thousands of chil-
dren who will be lifted out of deep pov-
erty. 
Let’s be clear: The child tax credit is 
a special refundable tax credit, so even 
families who don’t earn enough to pay 
taxes will get the automatic payment. 
But it is important to file a tax return 
before the May 17 deadline so you can 
begin receiving payments as soon as 
possible. 
I look forward to making the child 
tax credit permanent. 
f 
HONORING THE SERVICE OF 
EILEEN UCEKAY 
(Ms. TENNEY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, it is a 
tremendous honor for me to recognize 
Eileen Ucekay, a hardworking and out-
standing constituent of the 22nd Con-
gressional District in New York. She 
retired on May 9 of this year after 
working 45 years as the village clerk 
and treasurer of West Winfield. 
Eileen hails from the nearby city of 
Utica, where she grew up with her two 
sisters and attended high school there 
before moving to West Winfield. 
Eileen married her late husband, 
Jack, and had three wonderful children 
in our community, all while continuing 
to work for the village. 
In addition to her many decades of 
public service, Eileen serves the West 
Winfield 
community 
through

church, the Greater West Winfield His-
torical Society, the Red Cross, and the 
Red Hat Society. 
She is truly a role model for all. Her 
remarkable life, strong character, and 
deep dedication to public service have 
gained her the respect of everyone in 
our community. 
We are grateful for Eileen Ucekay’s 
service and her compassion for our 
community. 
f 
RECOGNIZING NATIONAL POLICE 
WEEK 
(Mr. PFLUGER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. PFLUGER. Madam Speaker, this 
week is National Police Week. It is a 
time to honor the sacrifice and service 
our men and women in blue make 
every single day to protect our neigh-
bors and our loved ones. 
In my district today, unfortunately, 
we are off to a very sobering start. 
Last night, two Concho County officers 
were shot and killed in the line of duty. 
These officers died protecting their 
community to the very end, defending 
the freedoms, values, and safety our 
country holds so dear. 
Though we are unable to thank them 
personally for their sacrifice, we will 
never stop honoring their legacy, the 
legacy of service and selflessness. 
I would like to extend my deepest 
condolences to their families, friends, 
colleagues, and community members 
who are affected by this enormous 
tragedy and remind all of us of the dan-
ger that law enforcement officers put 
themselves in every single day, will-
ingly, to help our communities. 
It is time that we stand up and honor 
them, and thank them for what they 
do. As a country, I request that we all 
keep our law enforcement officers in 
our hearts, our thoughts, and our pray-
ers and that we thank them for what 
they do. 
f 
HONORING LAW ENFORCEMENT 
(Mr. BURCHETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, 
this week is National Police Week, and 
I rise to honor the brave men and 
women of law enforcement who gave 
their lives to protect our communities. 
In 1962, National Police Week was es-
tablished by President John F. Ken-
nedy, a Democrat. But back then, hon-
oring our fallen officers was a bipar-
tisan issue, Madam Speaker. Today, 
many Democrats are so set on demon-
izing law enforcement they won’t even 
use this week to honor those lives that 
have been lost in the line of duty. It is 
a shame that supporting law enforce-
ment has become such a political non-
starter for my colleagues across the 
aisle. 
Police officers in our communities 
are cracking down on gangs, getting 
drugs off the streets, and stopping 
crime before it happens. They are keep-
ing all of us safe and deserve to know 
those who made the ultimate sacrifice 
will never be forgotten and will always 
be honored. 
Law enforcement, particularly our 
local sheriff’s offices and police depart-
ments in Tennessee’s Second Congres-
sional District, will always have my 
gratitude for the great work they do to 
keep us safe from bad folks. 
f 
RECOGNIZING NATIONAL CHARTER 
SCHOOL WEEK 
(Ms. FOXX asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of National Char-
ter School Week. This week, we honor 
the hope that charter schools deliver to 
millions of students nationwide, and 
we are reminded that education is 
about students, not politics. One such 
example is Piedmont Community Char-
ter School in North Carolina’s Fifth 
District. 
Regardless of ZIP Code, all American 
families deserve to decide, free of gov-
ernment interference, which learning 
environment best suits their child’s 
strengths. 
For 30 years, charter schools have 
prepared underserved students for life-
long success. Charter school alumni 
graduate from college at two to four 
times the national average for low-in-
come families. 
While Democrats dictate one-size- 
fits-all education requirements, Repub-
licans are fighting to offer educational 
freedom and choice. Charter schools 
offer students from every walk of life 
the opportunity to learn in an environ-
ment that works for them so they can 
develop tools to thrive. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF SERGEANT GERALD DIXON 
(Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the life 
and service of Sergeant Gerald Dixon of 
the Edmond Police Department. 
Sergeant Dixon has faithfully served 
our community for 32 years, 13 of 
which he spent as a school resource of-
ficer. 
In his time as an SRO, Sergeant 
Dixon has had a long-lasting impact on 
countless students in Edmond. Years 
after graduating, students still recall 
how much his presence meant to them. 
Looked up to as a great man and a fix-
ture of school, Sergeant Dixon’s com-
mitment to his community is evident. 
Not only has Sergeant Dixon’s pres-
ence helped make school a safe place, 
but his leadership, warm spirit, and 
love for his job also made students 
comfortable. They confided their strug-
gles in him, shared countless experi-
ences, and are better off from having 
Sergeant Dixon serve in their school. 
Madam Speaker, Sergeant Dixon has 
dedicated his life to the community 
and made countless sacrifices to ensure 
the safety of our students and the pub-
lic at large. I am truly honored and 
humbled to recognize Mr. Dixon, and I 
am grateful for his service and the leg-
acy he leaves behind. I wish him all the 
best in his well-deserved retirement.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Kentucky (Mr. GUTHRIE) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on H.R. 433. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I rise today in support of H.R. 433, 
the Family Support Services for Addic-
tion Act of 2021. 
Addiction and substance use disorder 
are complex, yet diagnosable, treatable 
diseases. Families can play a signifi-
cant role in helping an individual find 
treatment. Yet, there isn’t a one-size- 
fits-all approach to making sure that 
loved ones receive the care they need 
and deserve. This, of course, can be a 
challenge to more than just the indi-
vidual; it is a challenge to families as 
well. 
Madam Speaker, families across the 
United States are doing all they can to 
seek care for those they love. In fact, 
data from the Substance Abuse and 
Mental Health Services Administration 
reminds us that nearly 20 million 
Americans live with a substance use 
disorder. Unfortunately, only a frac-
tion of those Americans receives treat-
ment. 
H.R. 433, the Family Support Serv-
ices for Addiction Act, builds upon con-
gressional efforts, such as the Com-
prehensive Addiction and Recovery 
Act, the 21st Century Cures Act, and 
the SUPPORT for Patients and Com-
munities Act, to help close the treat-
ment gap and get Americans on the 
road to recovery. 
Part of paving a smooth road to re-
covery 
is 
providing 
evidence-based 
guidance for families and connecting 
them with other community support 
systems, which can dramatically influ-
ence an individual’s trajectory. That is 
exactly what this bill sets out to do. 
The bill would authorize the Sec-
retary of Health and Human Services 
to award grants to family community 
organizations that would work to de-
velop, expand, and enhance evidence- 
based family support services. These 
family community organizations would 
be able to use these grants to reduce 
stigma around substance use disorder 
and build connections between families 
and providers, and foster care services 
and other peer support services. 
I commend the lead sponsors of this 
legislation, Representatives TRONE and 
MEUSER, and their staff, for advocating 
for additional support for families. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
legislation. I hope the Senate will act 
on it swiftly. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 433, the Family Support 
Services for Addiction Act of 2021, 
which was introduced by Representa-
tives TRONE and MEUSER. 
This legislation would establish a 
grant program for family community 
organizations that provide evidence-in-
formed and family-based approaches to 
substance use and addiction manage-
ment. 
Family-based 
approaches 
have 
a 
record of success in substance use dis-
order recovery when compared with in-
dividual approaches, as they address 
several psychosocial dimensions of ad-
diction and strengthen support net-
works for affected individuals.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2161 
May 11, 2021 
This legislation would support family 
community organizations committed 
to pursuing evidence-driven interven-
tions for substance use disorder, reduc-
ing 
the 
stigma 
of 
addiction 
and 
strengthening both families and com-
munities through recovery. 
I would like to thank Representa-
tives TRONE and MEUSER for the hard 
work that they have done to put to-
gether and to bring this important bill 
to the floor. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as he may consume to 
the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. 
TRONE), the author of this bill. 
Mr. TRONE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on H.R. 433, 
the Family Support Services and Ad-
diction Services Act. 
I introduced this bill with my friend 
and fellow businessman, DAN MEUSER, 
in order to show our support for the 
millions of families that are struggling 
to help their loved ones suffering from 
addiction. 
b 1430 
In 2016, my nephew Ian lost his life to 
an overdose after years of struggling 
with addiction. But he didn’t fight this 
battle alone. My wife and I were with 
him every step of the way, working to 
support his recovery efforts. Getting 
him the help he needed was hard for us 
to do, even with the resources we had 
at our disposal. 
Our story is not unique. For most 
families, it is nearly impossible to 
navigate our behavioral healthcare sys-
tem, and COVID–19 has made it even 
harder. 
While our country faced an addiction 
crisis prior to COVID–19, the pandemic 
has made this crisis a five-alarm fire. 
Last year, more Americans died from 
drug overdoses than ever before, nearly 
90,000 Americans. That is a 29 percent 
increase in just one year. American 
families need help, and they need it 
now. 
This bipartisan bill provides the 
funding for nonprofits working with 
families struggling with addiction. The 
bill will provide grants to reach more 
families, create a more tailored ap-
proach, and save lives. 
I 
want 
to 
thank 
Congressman 
MEUSER for his support and partner-
ship. He has been an absolute champion 
on this issue. 
I also want to thank Chairman PAL-
LONE, Chairwoman ESHOO, and Ranking 
Member RODGERS for their laser-like 
focus on this issue. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. MEUSER). 
Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Kentucky, 
my good friend, Representative GUTH-
RIE; and my good friend from Mary-
land, DAVID TRONE, for their work on 
this bill. 
Madam Speaker, the plight of addic-
tion continues to affect communities 
across the country and in our great 
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Sub-
stance use disorder, like any disease, 
doesn’t just affect the individual. Their 
family, spouse, children, and friends 
also suffer alongside them, hoping for 
recovery. The critical support system 
they comprise is a potent tool in com-
batting addiction and an effective part-
ner we should aim to empower. 
That is why this bill, the Family 
Support Services for Addiction Act, is 
so essential and why I am truly very 
proud to be working with my good 
friend, Representative DAVID TRONE, to 
see it become law. His commitment to 
this cause is impressive and honorable. 
Our bill provides grants for commu-
nity organizations, providing critical 
support to families trying to navigate 
the complex insurance coverage and 
treatment options. 
Too often, this system overwhelms 
concerned families looking for the best 
option for their loved one. By passing 
this bill, we ensure more families will 
be connected to a lifesaving treatment 
option tailored to their needs. 
Unfortunately, Madam Speaker, this 
crisis has only become more acute dur-
ing the pandemic. According to the 
CDC, 81,000 drug overdose deaths oc-
curred between May 2019 and May 2020, 
the highest number recorded in a 12- 
month period. To combat this epidemic 
of drug use, we must use every tool we 
have; and the network of support that 
families provide is an essential tool to 
overcoming addiction and restoring our 
communities. 
I, again, want to thank Representa-
tive TRONE for his work on this bill, on 
this very important issue; and the com-
mittee leaders for moving this much- 
needed measure to the floor today. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
have no further speakers, I am pre-
pared to close, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume for the purpose of closing. 
Madam Speaker, I really appreciate 
both the leaders of this bill and the en-
tire House, as we have worked hard to-
gether in a bipartisan way over the 
years for the opioid abuse and other 
types of abuse and recovery efforts. 
This is an important bill and an addi-
tional step in that direction. We are 
fighting it, but we still have to con-
tinue the fight. This is an important 
bill. I support it, and I urge my col-
leagues to support it as well. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time for 
the purpose of closing. 
Madam Speaker, I am sure we will 
notice as we go through the suspension 
calendar today that we have a number 
of bills that deal with addiction and be-
havioral health issues. This is Mental 
Health Month that we are observing 
today, and this is one of the bills that 
is a very important part of this group. 
Madam Speaker, I urge support on a 
bipartisan basis, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 433. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2163 
May 11, 2021 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on H.R. 1475. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 1475, the Pursuing Equity 
in Mental Health Act. 
We have long known that people of 
color 
experience 
inequities 
in 
healthcare in the United States. While 
we have made progress to close these 
gaps in recent years, including with 
the passage of the Affordable Care Act, 
people of color in America continue to 
experience inequities in care and worse 
health outcomes compared to White 
Americans. 
These long-term trends are rooted in 
several social determinants that are 
often driven by structural discrimina-
tion 
and 
institutionalized 
racism, 
which has created systemic health in-
equity. The tragic result of these long- 
term trends is that people of color are 
more likely to suffer from underlying 
health conditions; have a much harder 
time getting access to care; and when 
they do, they are far more likely to ex-
perience bias, discrimination, and poor 
health outcomes. 
The 
Congressional 
Black 
Caucus’ 
Emergency Task Force on Black Youth 
Suicide and Mental Health reiterated 
these points in a report last Congress 
that raised concern about the increas-
ing rates of suicide and mental health 
trends among Black children. 
The bill before us today, H.R. 1475, is 
aimed specifically at addressing equity 
in mental health. It is a comprehensive 
approach to address increasing suicide 
rates and mental health disorders 
amongst Black youth. The bill would 
invest resources into better under-
standing racial and ethnic minority 
mental health disparities, improve out-
reach and support for racial and ethnic 
minorities, and expand provider sup-
port for students of color entering the 
mental health workforce. 
Madam Speaker, I am hopeful that 
this bill will help reduce the inequities 
in mental health. 
Before I conclude, I would like to 
thank my colleague, Representative 
BONNIE WATSON COLEMAN, and her staff 
for leading this important legislation. 
She, of course, is in the district imme-
diately next to me and a longtime sup-
porter of these causes. So this is a bill 
that is significant, and I do want to 
thank the Congresswoman for being 
the sponsor. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support the bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 1475, the Pursuing Equity 
in Mental Health Act, sponsored by 
Representative WATSON COLEMAN. 
This important bill helps address sui-
cide and mental illness in youth from 
minority 
and 
underserved 
commu-
nities. 
Despite improvements in health qual-
ity, disparities in mental healthcare 
persist. The Agency for Healthcare Re-
search and Quality has reported that 
racial and ethnic minority groups in 
the U.S. are less likely to have access 
to mental health services, less likely 
to use community mental health serv-
ices, more likely to use emergency de-
partments, and more likely to receive 
lower quality care. 
Poor mental healthcare access and 
quality ultimately contribute to poor 
outcomes, 
including 
suicide 
among 
these populations. These issues are es-
pecially acute in minority youth popu-
lations. 
This bill would help address these 
disparities by authorizing grants tar-
geted at high-poverty communities for 
culturally and linguistically appro-
priate mental health services, sup-
porting mental health disparities re-
search, 
studying 
the 
impact 
of 
smartphones and social media on ado-
lescents, and reauthorizing the Minor-
ity Fellowship Program to support 
more students of color entering the 
mental health workforce. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote 
for this important initiative, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
PALLONE. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
first, let me say that Congresswoman 
BONNIE WATSON COLEMAN has, for years 
both here and in the State legislature 
and beyond, gone after issues that 
many of us have neglected or been un-
willing to address. Maybe because they 
are controversial or whatever. She is 
always out there looking to help those 
people who are distressed or don’t have 
someone to look out for them. 
Madam Speaker, I yield such time as 
she may consume to the gentlewoman 
from New Jersey (Mrs. WATSON COLE-
MAN). 
Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Madam 
Speaker, I thank my colleague from 
New Jersey for those kind words, and I 
thank my colleague from the other side 
of the aisle for supporting what I think 
is a very important piece of legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to call 
on all of my colleagues to support the 
Pursuing Equity in Mental Health Act. 
Over the last several years, data has 
indicated an alarming increase in the 
suicide rates for Black children and 
teenagers, while a recent study has 
shown that suicide intervention pro-
grams—while successful among White, 
Asian, and Hispanic children—have 
done little to help African-American 
and Native-American youth. 
Two years ago, I launched the Emer-
gency Task Force on Black Youth Sui-
cide and Mental Health, sponsored by 
the Congressional Black Caucus. The 
task force’s report that inspired this 
bill is an urgent call to action. 
Regardless of race, gender, and socio-
economic 
status, 
every 
individual 
should have access to mental health re-
sources and treatment. 
This bipartisan bill will provide 
much-needed 
grants 
for 
culturally 
competent mental health services, in-
crease funding for the Minority Fellow-
ship Program, and direct research and 
resources at Federal departments and 
agencies. I basically am echoing what 
my colleagues have already shared 
with you. 
We must pursue this equity in men-
tal health because the systems we have 
in place simply do not address the men-
tal health needs of all communities. 
Madam Speaker, I call upon all of my 
colleagues to support this important 
piece of legislation. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time for 
the purpose of closing. 
Madam Speaker, again, this is a very 
important issue, and I am glad we are 
here today to address it. We need to ad-
dress it. My hopes and prayers are, as 
we move forward with this piece of leg-
islation, we get the help that commu-
nities needed. 
I support this legislation, and I urge 
my colleagues to support it. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I, 
too, urge my colleagues to support this 
very important bill, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1475, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are

b 1445 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on H.R. 586. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I rise in support of H.R. 586, the Sui-
cide Training and Awareness Nation-
ally Delivered for Universal Prevention 
Act of 2021, or the STANDUP Act. 
For the last decade, suicide has been 
the second leading cause of death in 
the United States for young Americans 
between the ages of 10 and 24. Since 
2007, the number of suicides for this 
group has nearly tripled. 
We are witnessing notable disparities 
within this youth suicide crisis as well. 
Data tells us that young Black Ameri-
cans, ages 5 to 12 years old, are twice 
as likely to die by suicide as compared 
to their White peers. Suicide rates for 
American Indian and Alaska Native 
teenagers between the ages of 15 and 19 
are 60 percent higher than the national 
average for all teenagers. Additionally, 
among the more than 77,000 youth re-
porting suicidal ideations, over one- 
third of them are identified as LGBTQ. 
This data makes clear that more 
must be done to help those struggling. 
We can and must act now to help equip 
students and the community around 
them to identify risk factors, because 
oftentimes, it is the students who are 
the true eyes and ears of each campus. 
We can help provide them with effec-
tive tools so they can play an active 
role in preventing suicide or self-harm. 
H.R. 586 would encourage schools to 
expand evidence-based suicide aware-
ness and prevention training to stu-
dents. It would also require this train-
ing as a condition of receiving funds 
under the Substance Abuse and Mental 
Health 
Services 
Administration’s 
Project AWARE grant program. 
The STANDUP Act, Madam Speaker, 
would also support technical assistance 
resources for schools and encourage the 
collection and reporting of data to 
track implementation of these policies 
and practices. 
Research shows that training stu-
dents on suicide prevention makes an 
impact on student suicide rates and 
improves a student’s willingness to 
seek help or help a peer. Much of this 
training is already taking place across 
thousands of schools nationwide, but 
STANDUP will help ensure that this 
good work is expanded to more schools 
across the country. 
For these reasons, I stand up in sup-
port of the STANDUP Act. I thank the 
lead sponsors, Representatives PETERS 
and BILIRAKIS, and the many bipartisan 
supporters of this legislation for their 
work on this critical issue. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill. I hope the 
Senate will act swiftly to pass it after 
we have taken action. I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2165 
May 11, 2021 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 586, the STANDUP Act of 
2021, which was introduced by Rep-
resentative SCOTT PETERS and includes 
the support of many Members of the 
House, including Energy and Com-
merce Committee colleagues BILIRAKIS, 
BLUNT ROCHESTER, UPTON, and TONKO. 
This legislation helps promote sui-
cide awareness and facilitates preven-
tion training for students and young 
Americans. For the last decade, suicide 
has been the second leading cause of 
death for Americans ages 10 to 24, and 
the 10th leading cause of overall deaths 
in the United States. Tragically, this 
epidemic has only worsened during the 
COVID–19 pandemic. 
Suicide is preventable, and initia-
tives 
that 
empower 
students 
with 
knowledge of the warning signs and re-
sources for prevention are critical in 
addressing these trends. 
Through this bill, Project AWARE 
grantees will be empowered to estab-
lish school-based suicide awareness and 
prevention training programs, which 
will improve student awareness of men-
tal health issues while connecting at- 
risk individuals to needed health serv-
ices. 
The pandemic has greatly impacted 
the mental health of all Americans, 
which is why it is critical that we con-
tinue addressing our Nation’s chal-
lenges in preventing youth suicide and 
promoting the wellness of all. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
have no additional speakers at this 
time. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Florida 
(Mr. 
BILIRAKIS), 
my 
good 
friend. 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, we 
have all worked together on this very 
powerful bill. There is no higher pri-
ority than keeping our children safe. I 
think most people know that. 
Since 2010, suicide has been the sec-
ond leading cause of death for young 
Americans ages 10 through 24. From 
2007 to 2015, the number of children and 
teens visiting the emergency room for 
suicide-related 
injuries 
doubled. 
In 
2017, 517 Americans, aged 10 through 14, 
and 6,252, aged 15 through 24, com-
mitted suicide. Sadly, some commu-
nities in my district are among those 
with the highest suicide rates in Flor-
ida. I represent the Tampa Bay area, 
Madam Speaker. 
Research has shown that most of 
these young Americans tell someone 
that they are contemplating suicide or 
school violence, and 68 percent of 
averted violence was stopped because a 
student reported concerns about a 
threat, a plot, or other concerning be-
havior involving a peer. 
H.R. 586, the Suicide Training and 
Awareness Nationally Delivered for 
Universal 
Prevention 
Act, 
or 
the 
STANDUP 
Act, 
encourages 
States, 
Tribes, and schools to create policies 
for student suicide prevention training 
utilizing SAMHSA-provided best prac-
tices, training, and technical assist-
ance. 
By providing high quality screening 
and prevention training to school staff 
and peers, threats can be identified be-
fore they materialize, and those who 
are at risk have an opportunity to get 
the mental health treatment they sore-
ly need. 
I have seen firsthand, Madam Speak-
er, the power of work like this through 
nonprofits like Sandy Hook Promise, 
and SAVE Promise Clubs at my chil-
dren’s school actually at Palm Harbor 
University High School, which is lo-
cated in Palm Harbor, Florida, in my 
district. When properly equipped, stu-
dents can be empowered to prevent vio-
lence in their schools. 
I appreciate the bipartisan work of 
my colleagues, and, of course, we actu-
ally sponsored this bill with Congress-
man PETERS. I also want to thank the 
chairman for placing the bill on the 
agenda and working with us. 
I urge my colleagues to join us in 
passing this critical legislation to help 
reverse the troubling trend of youth 
suicide and violence. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, as 
we were speaking before, this is an im-
portant issue. Suicide affects so many 
people. There are systems, there is the 
ability to become aware. It can be pre-
ventable if people know the right signs 
to look for. I think the American peo-
ple absolutely want to work together 
to make this happen so we can prevent 
this. 
I urge all my colleagues to support 
this piece of legislation. I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
urge support on a bipartisan basis for 
this bill. I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 586. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-

MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR 
STUDENTS ACT OF 2021 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the

prehensive mental health programs, as

section (b), is further amended by striking 
the part designation and heading and insert-
ing the following: 
‘‘PART G—SCHOOL-BASED MENTAL 
HEALTH’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Kentucky (Mr. GUTHRIE) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on H.R. 721. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I rise today in support of H.R. 721, 
the Mental Health Services for Stu-
dents Act of 2021. 
Mental illness, Madam Speaker, af-
fects 
millions 
of 
Americans. 
With 
youth in particular, research shows 
that half of all lifetime mental illness 
begins by the age of 14. According to 
the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, about three in four chil-
dren between the ages of 3 and 17 suffer 
from depression and anxiety, and near-
ly half have behavioral problems. In 
fact, data from Mental Health America 
shows that youth between the ages of 
11 and 17 are now at higher risk of mod-
erate to severe anxiety and depression. 
For many students, schools are a 
critical place to get mental health or 
behavioral health support, and now 
with added public health concerns, eco-
nomic pressures, online learning, and 
the social isolation that comes with 
these things, experts worry about the 
added repercussions we will see on the 
well-being of students across the coun-
try. 
This data, and the effect of the pan-
demic, make clear that we must do 
more to invest in preventative mental 
and behavioral health services and 
training in schools to give our kids and 
teens a brighter future. The American 
Academy of Pediatrics Committee on 
School Health recognized the increas-
ing mental health needs of children and 
adolescents when it said, ‘‘School- 
based mental health services offer the 
potential for prevention efforts as well 
as intervention strategies.’’ 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 721 does just 
that. This bill would support com-
prehensive mental health programs at 
schools across the Nation by encour-
aging partnerships between State and 
local educational agencies and mental 
health providers. Funding would be 
made available through the Substance 
Abuse and Mental Health Services Ad-
ministration. This funding would sup-
port prevention screening, treatment, 
and development of evidence-based pro-
grams for social, emotional, mental, 
and behavioral issues among students. 
H.R. 721 would also help us better un-
derstand the student, family, and edu-
cational outcomes of services provided 
to the students. 
I want to thank the lead sponsors of 
this bill, Representatives NAPOLITANO 
and KATKO, for their leadership and 
tireless work. 
Madam Speaker, it is critical that we 
support preventative mental and be-
havioral health services and training in 
schools for our kids and teens, particu-
larly at a time when mental health 
risks are exacerbated by the COVID–19 
pandemic. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill. I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I rise today in support of H.R. 721, 
the Mental Health Services for Stu-
dents Act of 2021, spearheaded by Rep-
resentative NAPOLITANO. 
This bill authorizes the Substance 
Abuse and Mental Health Services Ad-
ministration Project AWARE grants. 
These grants support State educational 
agencies, in partnership with State 
mental health agencies, in increasing 
awareness of mental health issues 
among school-aged youth, providing 
training for school personnel to detect 
and respond to mental health issues 
and connecting students with behav-
ioral health issues and their families to 
needed services. 
By supporting partnerships between 
State and local systems to promote the 
healthy development of students, these 
grants increase access to mental health 
services for school-aged youth, ulti-
mately reducing youth violence, sub-
stance use disorder, and suicide. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
have no additional speakers at this 
time. I reserve the balance of my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2167 
May 11, 2021 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, as 
with all the other bills before us today, 
it is so important to reach out to our 
youth and to prevent suicide and vio-
lence as a result of mental health dis-
orders. We all know, as young as we 
can reach them, the better. 
I support this bill and ask my col-
leagues to do so. I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, as 
my colleague from Kentucky points 
out, with these bills today, we are try-
ing to reach out and deal with these 
mental and behavioral health problems 
in various settings. In this case, it is 
the school-based setting, which I think 
is one of the most effective. 
So for that reason, I would ask my 
colleagues to support this legislation. I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
JACKSON LEE). The question is on the 
motion offered by the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) that the 
House suspend the rules and pass the 
bill, H.R. 721, as amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-

BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTION 
GUIDELINES ACT OF 2021 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 2877) to amend the Public 
Health Service Act to direct the Sec-
retary of Health and Human Services 
to develop best practices for the estab-
lishment and use of behavioral inter-
vention teams at schools, and for other

The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 2877 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

tion: 
‘‘SEC. 520H. BEST PRACTICES FOR BEHAVIORAL

‘‘(d) PUBLICATION.—Not later than 2 years 
after the date of enactment of this section, 
the Secretary shall publish the best prac-
tices under subsection (a)(1) on the internet

‘‘(e) 
TECHNICAL
ASSISTANCE.—The 
Sec-
retary shall provide technical assistance to 
institutions of higher education, elementary 
schools, and secondary schools to assist such 
institutions and schools in implementing the 
best practices under subsection (a). 
‘‘(f) DEFINITIONS.—In this section: 
‘‘(1) The term ‘behavioral intervention 
team’ means a team of qualified individuals

‘‘(A) are responsible for identifying and as-
sessing individuals exhibiting concerning be-
haviors, experiencing distress, or who are at

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Kentucky (Mr. GUTHRIE) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on H.R. 2877. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I rise today in support of H.R. 2877, 
the Behavioral Intervention Guidelines 
Act. 
Madam Speaker, behavioral interven-
tion teams are multidisciplinary teams 
that support students’ mental health 
and emotional well-being by detecting 
patterns, trends, and disturbances in 
behavior, and by conducting outreach 
to students who are unable to manage 
distress in healthy and constructive 
ways. These teams are already active 
in some educational settings, such as 
Wichita State University, Southern 
Connecticut 
State 
University, 
and 
Rochester Institute of Technology. 
This bill requires the Substance 
Abuse and Mental Health Administra-
tion to develop best practices for 
schools that have or want to have be-
havioral intervention teams. These 
best practices would cover the proper 
use of these teams and how to inter-
vene and avoid inappropriate use of 
mental health assessments and law en-
forcement. These best practices would 
then be required to be posted publicly 
on the Department of Health and 
Human Services website. HHS would 
also help to provide technical assist-
ance to entities implementing these 
best practices. 
We know that three in four children 
between the ages of 3 and 17 with de-
pression also have anxiety. Anxiety 
and depression are the top two mental 
health concerns among college stu-
dents as well. Unfortunately, recent

data found that over 80 percent of 
young people with mental health needs 
did not receive the care that they need-
ed. 
Young people in crisis should be able 
to access the care they need or be able 
to find support from peers who can di-
rect them toward appropriate services. 
This bill helps bridge that gap. 
The champions of this legislation, 
Representatives 
FERGUSON, 
PETERS, 
BURGESS, and PANETTA, worked to-
gether to help provide these behavioral 
health prevention tools to schools and 
colleges around the country, and I ap-
plaud them for their bipartisan effort. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
strong support of H.R. 2877, the Behav-
ioral Intervention Guidelines Act of 
2021 
introduced 
by 
Representatives 
FERGUSON, BURGESS, PETERS, and PA-
NETTA. 
This important bill authorizes the 
Substance Abuse and Mental Health 
Services Administration to develop 
best practices for establishing and 
using behavioral intervention teams in 
elementary schools, secondary schools, 
and institutions of higher education. 
Behavioral intervention teams are 
multidisciplinary teams that support 
students’ mental health and wellness 
by identifying students experiencing 
stress, anxiety, or other behavioral dis-
turbances, and conducting intervention 
and outreach to these students to help 
manage risk. These teams are already 
active in some educational settings, 
such as Texas Tech and the University 
of California, Los Angeles. 
By acting in a proactive manner to 
assist students and connect them with 
needed resources, behavioral interven-
tion teams help schools create a safe 
environment for their students and im-
prove 
mental 
health 
outcomes 
in 
young people. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to 
the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. FER-
GUSON). 
Mr. FERGUSON. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in strong support of H.R. 
2877, the BIG Act. 
Without question, we have all seen 
how the mental health issues in Amer-
ica have been growing, and they have 
been exacerbated by the COVID–19 pan-
demic. The urgency to address this cri-
sis has become more dire as we are see-
ing how fear, anxiety, financial prob-
lems, and particularly isolation have 
compounded these issues. We see this 
across the board but particularly with 
our young people. 
We must tackle these issues head-on, 
and that is why I am honored to sup-
port the BIG Act. 
This straightforward bill works to 
provide local communities and edu-
cational systems with the tools that 
they need to help identify mental 
health needs before it is too late. 
As a healthcare provider, I can tell 
my colleagues that early intervention 
is vitally important, and putting teams 
together that recognize the needs and 
see the problems with students before 
it is too late is important. The last 
thing that we want to see our students 
go through is the process of dropping 
out of school because of issues or prob-
lems with behavior or with their class-
mates. Most importantly, we never 
want to see them do harm to them-
selves or to others. 
This bill provides the resources and 
the best practices from around the 
country in one site where school dis-
tricts and different organizations can 
come together to put together the pro-
grams that will work best for them. 
Congress must step up to confront 
this challenge, but doing so success-
fully will require input from an awful 
lot of people. That is what this bill 
does. 
This is a bipartisan, bicameral bill. It 
has widespread support from places 
like Texas A&M; as you mentioned, the 
University of California; and in my 
home district, Columbus State Univer-
sity. It has the support of mental 
health organizations, mental health 
providers, and other individuals across 
this country. 
Together, we can and should increase 
the mental health well-being of our fel-
low Americans. 
National Mental Health Awareness 
Month is going on, and it is so impor-
tant that we act to improve access 
across our country to high-quality, evi-
dence-based mental healthcare serv-
ices. That is why I ask my colleagues 
to join in supporting the BIG Act. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, what 
we have talked about is that this cre-
ates a safe environment for students. I 
think all Americans want a safer envi-
ronment for all of our students and to 
improve the mental health outcomes of 
young people. 
Madam Speaker, that is what this 
bill focuses on, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
urge support for this bill. This is just 
another tool to help provide behavioral 
services—in this case, to schools and 
colleges around the country. I think it 
deserves our support. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2877. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are

BIPARTISAN SOLUTION TO 
CYCLICAL VIOLENCE ACT OF 2021 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 1260) to amend the Public 
Health Service Act to establish a grant 
program supporting trauma center vio-
lence intervention and violence preven-
tion programs, and for other purposes, 
as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1260 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled,

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Kentucky (Mr. GUTHRIE) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on H.R. 1260. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Trauma is a pressing public health 
epidemic. In 2016 alone, trauma ac-
counted for more than 29 million emer-
gency department visits and 39 million 
physician office visits in the United 
States. 
Tragically, homicide is the leading 
cause of death for Black males between 
the ages of 1 and 24 and the second 
leading cause of death in Hispanic 
males in the same age group. Regard-
less of race, of the people who survive 
a single violent trauma, it is estimated 
that up to 45 percent will experience a 
second violent trauma. 
This is where H.R. 1260 steps in to 
provide critical data-driven interven-
tions. The Bipartisan Solution of Cycli-
cal Violence Act directs the Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services to 
establish a grant program for specified 
trauma centers and nonprofits to es-
tablish or expand intervention or pre-
vention programs related to inten-
tional violent trauma. 
These programs, Madam Speaker, 
help identify patients at risk of repeat 
violent injury and connects them with 
hospital 
and 
community-based 
re-
sources. The bill bridges tragedy with 
hospital-based 
violence 
intervention 
programs by providing intensive case 
management to people who have expe-
rienced at least one violent trauma. 
These programs have been shown to 
successfully reduce injury recidivism 
and help those at risk for violence live 
safer lives. 
I 
commend 
my 
colleagues, 
Rep-
resentatives 
RUPPERSBERGER
and 
KINZINGER, for spearheading this initia-
tive. 
Again, I urge my colleagues to sup-
port this important bipartisan bill, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 1260, the Bipartisan Solu-
tion to Cyclical Violence Act of 2021 in-
troduced by Representative RUPPERS-
BERGER and fellow Energy and Com-
merce Committee member KINZINGER. 
This important legislation would pro-
vide Federal grants to hospitals and 
trauma centers for intervention serv-
ices to victims of violent crime. 
Violence in America disproportion-
ately impacts urban and underserved 
communities, where poor social deter-
minants of health can contribute to 
structural violence. 
Hospital-based 
intervention 
pro-
grams help reduce violence because 
they reach high-risk individuals re-
cently admitted to a hospital for treat-
ment of a serious violent injury. Hos-
pitalization presents an opportunity 
when an individual may be open to help 
to break the cycle of violence by imme-
diate intervention following the vio-
lent incident. 
By supporting hospital-based vio-
lence intervention programs, this bill 
will connect at-risk individuals with 
local resources that address underlying 
risk factors for violence. 
I thank Representatives RUPPERS-
BERGER and KINZINGER for tackling this 
challenging issue and for putting for-
ward a meaningful solution to help ad-
dress violence in our communities. 
Madam Speaker, it is important to 
break the cycle of violence. Having 
someone in a hospital setting who has 
just been a victim of violence is a great 
time to address that. 
I think this is the right policy at the 
right time, and I urge my colleagues to 
vote for this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
also urge my colleagues to support this 
bill. Again, this one, dealing with 
intervention for violent traumas, is 
part of this package today. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1260, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-

‘‘SEC. 520J–1. SECURING APPROPRIATE FOLLOW- 
ON 
CARE 
FOR 
ACUTE 
MENTAL 
HEALTH ILLNESS AFTER AN EMER-
GENCY DEPARTMENT ENCOUNTER. 
‘‘(a) IN
GENERAL.—The Secretary may 
award grants on a competitive basis to quali-
fying health providers to implement innova-
tive approaches to securing prompt access to 
appropriate follow-on care for individuals 
who experience an acute mental health epi-
sode and present for care in an emergency 
department. 
‘‘(b) ELIGIBLE GRANT RECIPIENTS.—In this 
section, the term ‘qualifying health provider’ 
means a health care facility licensed under 
applicable law that— 
‘‘(1) has an emergency department; 
‘‘(2) is staffed by medical personnel (such 
as emergency physicians, psychiatrists, psy-
chiatric registered nurses, mental health 
technicians, clinical social workers, psy-
chologists, and therapists) capable of pro-
viding treatment focused on stabilizing 
acute mental health conditions and assisting 
patients to access resources to continue 
treatment in the least restrictive appro-
priate setting; and 
‘‘(3) has arrangements in place with other 
providers of care that can provide a full 
range of medically appropriate, evidence- 
based services for the treatment of acute 
mental health episodes. 
‘‘(c) USE
OF FUNDS.—A qualifying health 
provider receiving funds under this section 
shall use such funds to create, support, or ex-
pand programs or projects intended to assist 
individuals who are treated at the provider’s 
emergency department for acute mental 
health episodes and to expeditiously transi-
tion such individuals to an appropriate facil-
ity or setting for follow-on care. Such use of 
funds may support the following: 
‘‘(1) Expediting placement in appropriate 
facilities through activities such as ex-
panded coordination with regional service 
providers, assessment, peer navigators, bed 
availability 
tracking 
and 
management, 
transfer protocol development, networking 
infrastructure development, and transpor-
tation services. 
‘‘(2) Increasing the supply of inpatient psy-
chiatric beds and alternative care settings 
such as regional emergency psychiatric fa-
cilities. 
‘‘(3) Use of alternative approaches to pro-
viding psychiatric care in the emergency de-
partment setting, including through tele- 
psychiatric support and other remote psy-
chiatric consultation, implementation of 
peak period crisis clinics, or creation of psy-
chiatric emergency service units. 
‘‘(4) 
Use 
of 
approaches 
that 
include 
proactive followup such as telephone check- 
ins, telemedicine, or other technology-based 
outreach to individuals during the period of 
transition. 
‘‘(5) Such other activities as are deter-
mined by the Secretary to be appropriate, 
consistent with subsection (a). 
‘‘(d) APPLICATION.—A qualifying health 
provider desiring a grant under this section 
shall prepare and submit an application to 
the Secretary at such time and in such man-
ner as the Secretary may require. At a min-
imum, the application shall include the fol-
lowing: 
‘‘(1) A description of identified need for 
acute mental health services in the pro-
vider’s service area. 
‘‘(2) A description of the existing efforts of 
the provider to meet the need for acute men-
tal health services in the service area, and 
identified gaps in the provision of such serv-
ices. 
‘‘(3) A description of the proposed use of 
funds to meet the need and gaps identified 
pursuant to paragraph (2). 
‘‘(4) A description of how the provider will 
coordinate efforts with Federal, State, local, 
and private entities within the service area. 
‘‘(5) A description of program objectives, 
how the objectives are proposed to be met, 
and how the provider will evaluate outcomes 
relative to objectives. 
‘‘(e) AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.— 
To carry out this section, there is authorized 
to be appropriated $15,000,000 for each of fis-
cal years 2022 through 2026.’’.

tleman from Kentucky (Mr. GUTHRIE) 
each will control 20 minutes.

b 1515 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on H.R. 1205. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 1205, the Improving Mental 
Health Access from the Emergency De-
partment Act. 
I would like to begin by recognizing a 
member of our committee, Representa-
tive RUIZ, and his staff for their work 
on this important legislation. As an 
emergency room physician himself, Dr. 
RUIZ knows firsthand the needs of both 
the medical professional and patients 
in the ER. 
Among those increasing needs is sup-
port for mental health services. Re-
search has shown that one in every 
eight emergency department visits in 
the U.S. is related to a mental health 
issue. And since 2009, mental health 
emergency room visits have substan-
tially increased, most of which is driv-
en by adolescents and young adults. 
This is especially concerning given the 
recent report from the Government Ac-
countability Office that found emer-
gency department visits for suicide at-
tempts from mid-March to mid-October 
2020 were up 26 percent from 2019. 
Now, this bill would help to provide 
increased access to care for people who 
report to an emergency department for 
acute mental health episodes. Under 
the bill, the Secretary of Health and 
Human Services is authorized to award 
grants 
to 
support 
innovative 
ap-
proaches for providing follow-on care 
for individuals treated in the emer-
gency department for acute mental 
health issues. This includes increasing 
the number of inpatient psychiatric 
beds and alternative care settings, sup-
porting a patient’s transition to appro-
priate mental health services, or the 
use of tele-psychiatric support or other 
remote psychiatric consultation meth-
ods. 
Madam Speaker, emergency depart-
ments can sometimes feel like a stress-
ful place, especially for people in crisis. 
However, they are often the last re-
maining safety net in many commu-
nities. We know that follow-up care for 
people with mental illnesses is linked 
to fewer repeat emergency room visits 
and improved mental and physical 
health. So let’s do our part to support 
the emergency room staff and patients 
in need by passing this bill today. 
Madam Speaker, again, I urge my 
colleagues to support H.R. 1205, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 1205, Improving Mental 
Health Access from the Emergency De-
partment Act of 2021, sponsored by 
Representative RUIZ. 
This bill authorizes the Substance 
Abuse and Mental Health Services Ad-
ministration to award grants to emer-
gency departments for the purpose of 
supporting follow-up services to pa-
tients that present in the emergency 
department in mental health crisis. 
According to SAMHSA’s National 
Guidelines for Behavioral Health Crisis 
Care, there is a disconnect in the provi-
sion of follow-up services regarding 
what comes next for patients experi-
encing a mental health crisis in the 
emergency department. 
If a patient comes in with appendi-
citis, the emergency room physician 
can call a surgeon. If the patient has a 
rash, the emergency department has a 
roster of dermatologists in clinics; and, 
in many cases, the physician can even 
make an appointment for the patient. 
These partnerships don’t always exist 
for mental health illness. 
By authorizing grants to support pro-
grams that help those treated at emer-
gency departments expeditiously tran-
sition to follow-on care, this bill will 
remove barriers to care for those expe-
riencing an acute mental health crisis, 
reduce stigma, and ultimately save 
lives. 
Madam Speaker, one of the great 
things I have learned being a Member 
of the House of Representatives is that 
we have 435 people from all walks of 
life and they bring all their life experi-
ences to us and create some important 
legislation. 
Dr. RUIZ is an emergency room physi-
cian. He knows this firsthand. We are 
colleagues on the Committee on En-
ergy and Commerce. I know he is pas-
sionate about it because it does save 
lives if we get people the assistance 
they need. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote for this bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
PALLONE. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
again, we are trying with these series 
of bills today to address mental and be-
havioral health problems, and this one 
deals with the emergency room. So 
that is very important, and I would 
urge my colleagues to support it on a 
bipartisan basis.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 1324. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 1324, the Effective Suicide 
Screening and Assessment in the Emer-
gency Department Act. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has caused 
tremendous suffering in our country 
over the past year and has negatively 
impacted the mental health of so many 
Americans. In fact, rates of mental 
health disorders, like depression and 
anxiety, that may lead to suicide have 
gone up almost fourfold. 
According to the National Centers 
for Health Statistics, over 44,000 people 
died from suicide last year. However, 
these numbers may not fully reflect 
the deaths that occurred secondary to 
despair from the pandemic. Suicide is 
the second leading cause of death for 
people between the ages of 10 and 34, 
impacting children and people in the 
prime of their lives.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2172 
May 11, 2021 
We also saw this during the pandemic 
with a spike in suicide deaths for first 
responders. For example, who can for-
get the story of Dr. Lorna Breen, an 
emergency room physician in New 
York, who dedicated herself to fighting 
the pandemic, but then tragically died 
from suicide after experiencing ex-
treme burnout? 
To counter these unnecessary deaths, 
we need to provide more resources to 
our providers on the front lines of 
emergency 
departments 
across 
the 
country. It is particularly important 
that we focus on those with limited re-
sources, including Critical Access Hos-
pitals, facilities serving Native Ameri-
cans, and emergency departments in 
communities with high rates of suicide. 
Resources for healthcare providers in 
the emergency department are impor-
tant since they are often in the posi-
tion of providing for patients at the 
highest risk for suicide with approxi-
mately 10 percent of emergency depart-
ment patients presenting for treatment 
of suicidal ideations. Unfortunately, al-
most 40 percent of patients visiting an 
emergency department following a sui-
cide attempt will go on to reattempt 
suicide within a year. 
Madam Speaker, this bill will assist 
emergency departments by providing 
better 
training 
to 
emergency 
healthcare providers, establishing poli-
cies to improve identification and 
treatment of individuals at risk for sui-
cide, employing additional behavioral 
health professionals, and improving ac-
cess to care for patients. 
I thank Representatives BILIRAKIS 
and SOTO and their staff for their tire-
less effort on this bill. Again, bipar-
tisan. 
Madam Speaker, suicide deaths are a 
preventable tragedy that negatively 
impact families and loved ones and rob 
us of young people in the prime of their 
lives. So whatever we can do to prevent 
this is going to be so important. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support H.R. 1324, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
strong support of H.R. 1324, the Effec-
tive Suicide Screening and Assessment 
in the Emergency Department Act of 
2021, introduced by Representatives 
BILIRAKIS, SOTO, and BURGESS. 
This legislation will authorize the 
grant program to improve the identi-
fication, screening, assessment, and 
treatment of patients in emergency de-
partments who are at risk for suicide. 
Consideration of this bill could not 
come at a more pressing time. The 
COVID–19 pandemic and resulting eco-
nomic downturn have impacted the 
mental health of many Americans. Due 
to the pandemic, tens of thousands of 
additional Americans have died from 
suicide or substance misuse. 
Emergency departments are key lo-
cations to intervene and assist those 
who may be contemplating suicide. 
Past research has identified one in 
every eight emergency department vis-
its in the United States were related to 
a mental health or substance use dis-
order. 
By creating grants for emergency de-
partments 
to 
develop 
policies 
for 
screening those at risk of suicide, and 
enhancing their post-discharge care co-
ordination, this bill will improve our 
frontline providers’ ability to inter-
vene when someone is in crisis, ulti-
mately reducing deaths from despair 
during this difficult time. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. BILIRAKIS), my friend. 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, 
this is a real problem in this country. 
We have a mental health crisis, and, 
collectively, these bills address that. 
So I thank the chairman and the rank-
ing member for bringing these bills to 
the floor. Let’s get them through 
today, and then passed in the Senate 
and have the President sign because it 
will make a real difference in the lives 
of these people who are suffering with 
mental illness. 
Madam Speaker, our Nation remains 
in the midst of a suicide crisis. Over 
the past several decades, the suicide 
rate has risen sharply, increasing by 31 
percent since 2001, making suicide the 
10th leading cause of death, and claim-
ing an estimated 47,000 lives annually. 
A 2016 study found that 11 percent of 
all emergency department patients ex-
hibited 
suicidal 
ideation. 
However, 
only 3 percent of those patients were 
diagnosed by current screening tools. 
Furthermore, about 70 percent of pa-
tients who leave the emergency depart-
ment after a suicide attempt never at-
tend their first outpatient follow-up 
appointment. This is just reality, and 
we have got to do something about 
this. 
The Effective Suicide Screening and 
Assessment in the Emergency Depart-
ment Act creates a voluntary HHS 
grant program to assist emergency de-
partments in developing protocols for 
identifying, assessing, and treating in-
dividuals at risk for suicide with pref-
erence given to either critical access 
hospitals or hospitals located in a geo-
graphic area with a suicide risk that is 
higher than the national average rate. 
Grants last for 2 years and grantees 
must submit a report annually on their 
efforts to improve the identification, 
assessment, and discharge policies for 
individuals who are at risk for suicide. 
This proactive approach is vital be-
cause emergency departments often 
are the first—and, sadly, too often the 
only—point 
of 
contact 
within 
the 
healthcare system for those most at 
risk for suicide. 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate, again, 
the bipartisan support of my colleague, 
and I worked on this with Congressman 
SOTO. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to pass H.R. 1324, the Effective 
Suicide Screening and Assessment in 
the Emergency Department Act, to fur-
ther equip our health providers to rec-
ognize and assist these patients in cri-
sis. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I am 
prepared to close, and I would just say 
that these series of bills is so impor-
tant in dealing with the suicide and 
prevention, in preventing this tragic 
epidemic from becoming a pandemic as 
well. 
Madam Speaker, I urge the support, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
also urge support for this bill. Again, 
this is dealing with trying to alert po-
tential problems or potential for sui-
cide in the emergency department, a 
very important part of this package. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1324. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Kentucky (Mr. GUTHRIE) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 1480. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of the Helping Emergency Re-
sponders Overcome Act, or the HERO 
Act. 
As we have learned over the past 
year, not all heroes wear capes. There 
are heroes in our communities working 
to save the lives of countless Ameri-
cans, including our emergency respond-
ers, firefighters, healthcare workers, 
and hospital personnel, who, to this 
day, continue to battle COVID–19. 
Unfortunately, despite their heroic 
efforts, evidence suggests that suicide, 
depression, and substance abuse dis-
order are significant issues facing pub-
lic safety personnel and medical pro-
viders. Those on the front lines of the 
COVID–19 pandemic have witnessed 
previously 
unimaginable 
conditions 
that are traumatizing for even the 
most resilient public safety and med-
ical personnel. 
Madam Speaker, prior to COVID–19, 
it was estimated that 30 percent of first 
responders develop behavioral health 
conditions, including, but not limited 
to, 
depression 
and 
post-traumatic 
stress disorder, as compared with 20 
percent of the general population. 
Tragically, a 2018 study found that pub-
lic safety officers were more likely to 
die by suicide than professionals in 
other lines of duty. 
So this bill will help inform and sup-
port prevention and treatment strate-
gies for addressing behavioral and men-
tal health issues among public safety 
officers. The legislation would require 
the development of a data system to 
capture 
the 
incidence 
of 
suicides 
among this population, while also fa-
cilitating the study of successful inter-
ventions to reduce suicide among these 
frontline health workers. 
The bill also includes efforts to en-
hance behavioral health and wellness 
programs 
for 
healthcare 
providers, 
such as providing financial assistance 
to entities that establish behavioral 
health programs targeted to these pop-
ulations. By utilizing the new data sys-
tem, 
improved 
research, 
and 
pro-
grammatic findings, the Department of 
Health and Human Services will de-
velop best practices and resources for 
addressing PTSD in these frontline 
workers. 
I want to commend Representative 
BERA, I know he spoke before during 
the 1 minute Special Orders on this 
bill, 
and 
also 
Congressman 
FITZPATRICK, for putting forward this 
bipartisan legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to help those heroes by sup-
porting the HERO Act today, and I re-
serve the balance of my time.

Technology, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRWOMAN JOHNSON: Thank you for 
consulting with the Committee on Energy 
and Commerce and agreeing to discharge 
H.R. 1480, the ‘‘Helping Emergency Respond-
ers Overcome Act’’, from further consider-
ation, so that the bill may proceed expedi-
tiously to the House floor. 
I agree that your forgoing further action 
on this measure does not in any way dimin-
ish or alter the jurisdiction of your com-
mittee or prejudice its jurisdictional prerog-
atives on this measure or similar legislation 
in the future. I would support your effort to 
seek appointment of an appropriate number 
of conferees from your committee to any 
House-Senate conference on this legislation. 
I will ensure our letters on H.R. 1480 are 
entered into the Congressional Record dur-
ing floor consideration of the bill. I appre-
ciate your cooperation regarding this legis-
lation and look forward to continuing to 
work 
together 
as 
this 
measure 
moves 
through the legislative process. 
Sincerely, 
FRANK PALLONE, JR., 
Chairman. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 1480, the Helping Emer-
gency Responders Overcome Act, or 
HERO Act, which was introduced by 
Representative 
BERA, 
and 
several 
Members of this Chamber, including 
Energy and Commerce Committee col-
leagues BURGESS, BLUNT
ROCHESTER, 
KELLY, KUSTER, and TONKO. 
This legislation would create a data-
base at the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention to capture public safe-
ty officer suicide incidences, and stud-
ies successful interventions. It would

also authorize a grant program for peer 
support and wellness programs for 
frontline healthcare workers and fire 
and emergency medical service agen-
cies. The bill also directs the Secretary 
of Health and Human Services to de-
velop best practices and share re-
sources for addressing post-traumatic 
stress in public safety officers. 
This legislation is incredibly timely. 
Emergency workers and doctors and 
nurses have been under incredible 
strain throughout the pandemic. Los-
ing those who keep us healthy and safe 
will only make the crisis worse. 
We must ensure that all the heroes 
across America on the front lines of 
healthcare and in law enforcement and 
public safety have the support they 
need to continue working to keep us 
safe. 
Madam Speaker, this being National 
Police Officer Week, I think it is Me-
morial week, it is an important time to 
do all we can for those in law enforce-
ment, but also public safety, as this 
bill addresses, and those on the front 
lines in healthcare. 
So I encourage us to be in support of 
those on the front lines, and I urge a 
‘‘yes’’ vote. Madam Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, this 
one, of course, deals with trying to ad-
dress 
behavioral 
mental 
health 
amongst public safety officers, and 
that is obviously a very important part 
of this package. 
Madam Speaker, I would urge unani-
mous support for the bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1480, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Kentucky (Mr. GUTHRIE) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 2862. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 2862, the Campaign to Pre-
vent Suicide Act. 
Suicide, Madam Speaker, continues 
to be one of the leading causes of death 
in the United States. Last year alone, 
we lost more than 44,000 people to sui-
cide deaths, placing a heavy toll on the 
families and friends of victims, as well 
as on our communities. 
To help prevent suicides, we have 
created a lifeline that people can call 
when they are in crisis to get the help 
they need. This suicide prevention hot-
line has been available since 2004 
through funding we have provided to 
the 
Substance 
Abuse 
and 
Mental 
Health Services Administration, and 
the call-in line has taken millions of 
calls since its inception. 
Unfortunately, the call-in line was 
started as a 10-digit number that is 
hard to remember, and this could po-
tentially be preventing essential access 
to support for those in crisis. In 2018, 
the National Suicide Hotline Improve-
ment Act was passed with the goal of 
launching a new 3-digit number similar 
to 911 that is easy to remember during 
a time of crisis. 
The Federal Communications Com-
mission is now finalizing the process to 
launch this new 3-digit call-in line, 988, 
next year. Now we need to ensure peo-
ple are aware of the new 3-digit number 
through a marketing of 988. 
H.R. 2862 provides this essential next 
step in communicating the new lifeline 
number to the public, and will also 
evaluate the effectiveness of the mar-
keting to better understand how best 
to reach communities in need. 
Madam Speaker, suicide deaths are a 
preventible tragedy, and this call-in 
line has the potential to help people in 
crisis and to save lives, but we need to 
educate people about this important 
resource. 
Madam Speaker, I want to commend 
the lead sponsors of this legislation, 
Representatives BEYER and KINZINGER, 
and their staff, for their tireless work 
on this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support the bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 2862, the Campaign to Pre-
vent Suicide Act, introduced by Rep-
resentatives BEYER and KINZINGER. 
This bill directs the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention and the 
Substance Abuse and Mental Health 
Services Administration to conduct a 
national suicide prevention education 
campaign, this includes promotion of 
the new 988 number for the National 
Suicide Prevention Lifeline. 
The bill also helps educate Ameri-
cans on ways to engage people showing 
signs of suicidal behavior, in order to 
provide them with the support they 
need. The bill is desperately needed as 
we work as a nation to emerge from an 
unprecedented health and economic 
crisis. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues 
to come together here today and ad-
vance this legislation. 
Again, this is important in terms of 
having the 988 number, people can 
reach out and have intervention. We 
know intervention and prevention and 
recognition is key to preventing people 
from committing suicide. 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate my 
friends, Mr. BEYER and Mr. KINZINGER, 
for bringing this forward. I urge its 
passage. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, as 
my 
colleague 
from 
Kentucky 
ex-
plained, this is a very important piece 
of legislation to make people aware of 
this 988 number to prevent suicide. 
Madam Speaker, I would urge my 
colleagues on a bipartisan basis to sup-
port this bill, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2862, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, on that I demand the yeas 
and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are

tions. 
SEC. 6. DEFINITION. 
In this Act, the term ‘‘Suicide Prevention 
Lifeline’’ means the suicide prevention hot-
line maintained pursuant to section 520E–3 of 
the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 
290bb–36c). 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Kentucky (Mr. GUTHRIE) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 2981. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 2981, the Suicide Preven-
tion Lifeline Improvement Act. 
We have spoken a lot about suicide 
prevention today and recognize that 
this is an issue we have to address to 
save the lives of Americans who are in 
the prime of their life. And we have 
tens of thousands of people dying every 
year from suicide, and millions of peo-
ple struggling with mental health 
issues, many of which have been exac-
erbated by the COVID–19 pandemic. 
Fortunately, the Federal Govern-
ment provides dedicated funding for a 
lifeline that people can call when they 
are in crisis, and we have recently 
made major investments in improving 
this lifeline by changing it to a 3-digit 
number, 988. That change is in the 
works now, Madam Speaker. 
b 1545 
This bill will increase support for the 
National Suicide Prevention Lifeline 
to ensure that those who make the call 
are able to get high quality crisis serv-
ice. The lifeline’s network has now 
over 170 local call centers that answer 
millions of calls every year. However, 
we need to provide additional funding 
so this lifeline can respond to increas-
ing demands. The legislation will also 
enhance coordination of services as 
well as data sharing while extending 
the capacity for local communities to 
provide services. 
This bill, Madam Speaker, will en-
sure that the lifeline has the sufficient 
level of resources needed to provide 
high quality services for people who 
are reaching out for help. 
Again, I want to commend the lead 
sponsors of this bill, Representatives 
KATKO, BEYER, and NAPOLITANO, and 
their staff for their tireless work on 
this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support H.R. 2981, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
strong support of H.R. 2981, the Suicide 
Prevention Lifeline Improvement Act 
of 2021, introduced by Representatives 
KATKO, NAPOLITANO, and BEYER. This 
legislation will increase the authoriza-
tion of the National Suicide Prevention 
Lifeline program to $50 million a year 
and ensures funding is available for the 
continued operation of the suicide hot-
line. 
When an individual in crisis calls the 
suicide hotline, they cannot get a busy 
signal. This is crucial in this time of 
economic distress and social isolation 
caused by the COVID–19 pandemic. 
With more individuals in crisis, more 
calls will come. We must increase 
awareness of this critical resource and 
make it easier to remember the num-
ber. We must make sure the national 
suicide hotline is prepared to deal with 
those in crisis.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2178 
May 11, 2021 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this important leg-
islation. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
KATKO). 
Mr. 
KATKO. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of the Suicide Prevention Lifeline 
Improvement Act. I was proud to intro-
duce this legislation alongside my good 
friends and tremendous leaders on 
mental health issues, Congresswoman 
NAPOLITANO and Congressman BEYER. 
Every year during Mental Health 
Awareness Month, I stand before this 
body to highlight the mental health 
crisis facing our Nation and the urgent 
need for action. This year, however, 
the issue is more critical than ever. 
As the coronavirus pandemic im-
pacted nearly every aspect of our soci-
ety and daily lives, we saw devastating 
increases in the number of Americans 
suffering from mental health issues. 
One report by the Centers for Disease 
Control last June indicated that 40 per-
cent of U.S. adults reported struggling 
with mental health or substance use, 
with nearly 11 percent of adults and 
over 25 percent of those aged 18 to 24 
years old having seriously considered 
suicide. Those are stunning numbers. 
The threat of this pandemic was not 
solely a physical or financial one. It 
has taken a toll on the mental health 
of millions upon millions of Americans, 
and they need our support. 
I am pleased that the bipartisan Sui-
cide Prevention Lifeline Improvement 
Act takes important steps to provide 
individuals in crisis with lifesaving aid 
and 
resources 
by 
improving 
and 
strengthening the National Suicide 
Prevention Lifeline. Since its creation, 
the lifeline has been significantly un-
derfunded and plagued with issues, like 
long call wait times and lack of con-
sistency. 
This bill increases the authorization 
from $12 million to $50 million, and 
dedicates 80 percent of that funding to 
local suicide crisis centers that are the 
backbone of the lifeline, like Contact 
Community 
Services 
in 
Syracuse, 
which literally saves lives every day. 
The legislation also implements im-
portant quality assurance measures in-
cluding the requirement to eliminate 
call wait times and implement evi-
dence-based practices like follow-up 
and referrals to other health services 
that are required. For too long, the 
mental health and suicide crisis in our 
country has gone unspoken, under-
funded and under-recognized. It is time 
we address this crisis as what it is: a 
crisis. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support H.R. 2981 and other 
important mental health bills on the 
floor today. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
have no additional speakers, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. In closing, Madam 
Speaker, I appreciate my colleagues for 
working very hard on this bill and all 
the bills for suicide preservation. 
Madam Speaker, I urge its passage, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. PALLONE. In closing, Madam 
Speaker, this, again, is a bill to try to 
improve the lifeline and the use of the 
new 988 number. I urge its support, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2981. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed. 
f 
SUICIDE PREVENTION ACT 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 2955) to authorize a pilot pro-
gram to expand and intensify surveil-
lance of self-harm in partnership with 
State and local public health depart-
ments, to establish a grant program to 
provide self-harm and suicide preven-
tion services in hospital emergency de-
partments, and for other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Kentucky (Mr. GUTHRIE) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on H.R. 2955. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 2955, the Suicide Preven-
tion Act. This is among several bills 
being considered today that is specifi-
cally aimed at suicide prevention. The 
reason for these legislative efforts is 
that suicide is a devastating and pre-
ventable tragedy that strikes far too 
many Americans; and there is legiti-
mate reason for us to be concerned 
that this preventable cause of death 
may become worse as we fully uncover 
the impact of the pandemic on Amer-
ican lives. We know that more people 
than ever are suffering from mental 
health issues, and suicide is unfortu-
nately a devastating consequence of 
untreated mental illness. 
So we have to act now to better un-
derstand the risk factors for suicide 
and self-harm, train providers on how 
to better manage patients, and improve 
our ability to detect suicide deaths and 
self-harm in our communities. This bill 
does each of these things. 
The Suicide Prevention Act, intro-
duced by Representatives STEWART and 
MATSUI, will enhance collection and 
sharing of important data while also 
providing funding for programs that 
train and equip emergency department 
personnel in how to prevent suicide. 
The bill also enables surveillance of 
self-harm 
to 
inform 
better 
health 
strategies aimed at prevention, Madam 
Speaker. It also supports emergency 
departments to better screen and treat 
high-risk patients, and it also calls for 
development and deployment of best 
practices in suicide prevention for all 
healthcare providers. 
So, in closing, we know that suicide 
is one of the leading causes of prevent-
ible death in the United States—par-
ticularly for young people—and we 
have to act. I commend the work of the 
sponsors of this bill, Representatives 
STEWART and MATSUI, in creating this 
important bill. I look forward to pass-
ing the bill today, and I hope that the 
Senate will act on it swiftly. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support the bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
strong support of H.R. 2955, the Suicide 
Prevention Act, spearheaded by Rep-
resentatives STEWART and MATSUI. 
This legislation establishes two grant 
programs to prevent self-harm and sui-
cide. The first grant program would 
train emergency room personnel in sui-
cide prevention strategies and screen-
ing. The bill also establishes a grant 
program to enhance data collection 
and sharing of suicide information to 
help save lives. 
I thank my colleagues for bringing 
forward this important legislation, and 
I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of 
this important initiative. 
Madam Speaker, seeing no additional 
speakers, I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. In closing, Madam 
Speaker, again, this bill is part of our 
strategy in prevention. I urge my col-
leagues to support it on a bipartisan 
basis, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2955. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it.

Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the

for registrants to exercise due dili-
gence upon discovering a suspicious 
order, and for other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 768

of 2021’’. 
SEC. 2. CLARIFICATION OF PROCESS FOR REG-
ISTRANTS TO EXERCISE DUE DILI-

(a) IN GENERAL.—Paragraph (3) of section 
312(a) of the Controlled Substances Act (21 
U.S.C. 832(a)) is amended to read as follows: 
‘‘(3) upon discovering a suspicious order or 
series of orders— 
‘‘(A) exercise due diligence; 
‘‘(B) establish and maintain (for not less

ders if the due diligence fails to resolve all of 
the indicators that gave rise to the suspicion 
that filling the order or series of orders 
would cause a violation of this title by the

titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in 
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Kentucky (Mr. GUTHRIE) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on H.R. 768. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 768, the Block, Report, And 
Suspend Suspicious Shipments Act of 
2021. 
Since 1999, more than 841,000 Ameri-
cans have died from a drug overdose. In 
the early years of this epidemic, many 
of these deaths involved prescription 
opioids. Then in 2010 we began seeing 
dramatic 
increases 
from 
heroin-in-
volved deaths, and now we are seeing a 
third wave, Madam Speaker, involving 
synthetic opioids like illicitly manu-
factured fentanyl. 
In those earlier years, Americans 
across the country became addicted to 
opioids. Many of those opioids were 
prescribed to patients to treat pain. 
However, throughout the years, we 
have discovered that many of these 
opioids were diverted through a system 
meant to prevent diversion. 
The Drug Enforcement Administra-
tion requires entities that manufacture 
or distribute controlled substances to 
register and report their activities 
through ARCOS, a system meant to 
track the manufacture, distribution, 
and dispensing of these substances. In 
this system, registrants are also ex-
pected to disclose suspicious orders of 
controlled substances such as orders of 
unusual size, orders deviating from a 
normal pattern, or orders of an unusual 
frequency. 
H.R. 768 will improve reporting and 
action on suspicious orders by clari-
fying the responsibilities of drug manu-
facturers and distributors when discov-
ering a suspicious order. The legisla-
tion also requires that this discovery 
be reported to DEA, which will help all 
entities to better identify suspicious 
activity and root out bad actors. 
This is a commonsense bill that will 
make clear the responsibilities for all 
entities in our supply chain, and hope-
fully help to deter opioid diversion and 
trafficking. 
I commend the lead sponsors of this 
legislation, Representatives DINGELL 
and MCKINLEY, and their staff, for their 
work on this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support the bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY, 
Washington, DC, May 5, 2021. 
Hon. FRANK PALLONE, JR., 
Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN PALLONE: This is to advise 
you that the Committee on the Judiciary 
has now had an opportunity to review the 
provisions in H.R. 768, the ‘‘Block, Report, 
And Suspend Suspicious Shipments Act of 
2021,’’ that fall within our Rule X jurisdic-
tion. I appreciate your consulting with us on 
those provisions. The Judiciary Committee 
has no objection to your including them in 
the bill for consideration on the House floor, 
and to expedite that consideration is willing 
to forgo action on H.R. 768, with the under-
standing that we do not thereby waive any 
future jurisdictional claim over those provi-
sions or their subject matters. 
In the event a House-Senate conference on 
this or similar legislation is convened, the 
Judiciary Committee reserves the right to 
request an appropriate number of conferees 
to address any concerns with these or simi-
lar provisions that may arise in conference. 
Please place this letter into the Congres-
sional Record during consideration of the 
measure on the House floor. Thank you for 
the cooperative spirit in which you have 
worked regarding this matter and others be-
tween our committees. 
Sincerely, 
JERROLD NADLER, 
Chairman.

Hon. JERROLD NADLER, 
Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN NADLER: Thank you for 
consulting with the Committee on Energy 
and Commerce and agreeing to be discharged 
from further consideration of H.R. 768, the 
‘‘Block, Report, And Suspend Suspicious 
Shipments Act of 2021,’’ so that the bill may 
proceed expeditiously to the House floor. 
I agree that your forgoing further action 
on this measure does not in any way dimin-
ish or alter the jurisdiction of your com-
mittee or prejudice its jurisdictional prerog-
atives on this measure or similar legislation 
in the future. I would support your effort to 
seek appointment of an appropriate number 
of conferees from your committee to any 
House-Senate conference on this legislation. 
I will seek to place our letters on H.R. 768 
into the Congressional Record during floor 
consideration of the bill. I appreciate your 
cooperation regarding this legislation and 
look forward to continuing to work together 
as this measure moves through the legisla-
tive process. 
Sincerely, 
FRANK PALLONE, JR., 
Chairman. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2181 
May 11, 2021 
Energy and Commerce Committee col-
leagues, MCKINLEY and DINGELL. 
This bill addresses an alarming prob-
lem that was identified in the Energy 
and Commerce Committee’s 2018 bipar-
tisan investigation into the distribu-
tion of prescription opioids by whole-
sale drug distributors. 
The committee found that when mil-
lions 
of 
prescription 
opioids 
were 
dumped into communities large and 
small across the country, the distribu-
tors flagged the orders for the DEA, 
but shipped the orders anyway—even 
after notifying the authorities that the 
orders were suspicious. 
b 1600 
This bill places additional obliga-
tions on drug manufacturers and dis-
tributors that discover a controlled 
substance suspicious order. 
In addition to reporting the sus-
picious order to the DEA, H.R. 768 re-
quires the manufacturer or distributor 
to exercise due diligence, decline to fill 
the order, and provide information to 
the DEA on the indicators that led to 
the belief that filling the order would 
violate the Controlled Substances Act. 
All 
stakeholders 
have 
important 
roles to play in preventing substance 
use disorders, and it is critical that our 
pharmaceutical manufacturers and dis-
tributors step up in stopping pill dump-
ing. 
I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as she may consume to 
the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. 
DINGELL), who is the author of this bill 
and oftentimes presents to the House 
commonsense action plans on impor-
tant issues. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for being a very 
good and fair chairman. 
I rise in support of the Block, Report, 
And Suspend Suspicious Shipments 
Act. This bipartisan legislation would 
implement 
safeguards 
against 
pill 
dumping and other abusive practices to 
address the ongoing opioid epidemic, 
which remains one of the most pressing 
public health threats facing our coun-
try. 
Last year, over 88,000 Americans lost 
their lives as a result of the opioid cri-
sis, including 2,650 individuals in my 
home State of Michigan. Communities 
across the country are hurting, and 
new tools to address pill dumping and 
other dodgy practices that have exacer-
bated the opioid crisis are needed now 
more than ever. 
The Block, Report, And Suspend Sus-
picious Shipments Act will strengthen 
oversight and integrity of the opioid 
supply chain by requiring that drug 
manufacturers and distributors exer-
cise due diligence when they receive a 
suspicious order for controlled sub-
stances. This includes blocking or de-
clining to fill the suspicious order and 
providing DEA additional data and 
background on the indicators of the 
order in question. 
This legislation’s commonsense pro-
tection will save lives in Michigan and 
all around this country by making dis-
tributors and manufacturers active 
partners in curbing these abuses. 
I would like to recognize my col-
league, Congressman MCKINLEY, for his 
record of leadership, concern, empathy, 
compassion, and working to address 
this longstanding issue that has helped 
perpetuate the opioid crisis. 
I would also like to thank Chairman 
PALLONE and Ranking Member ROD-
GERS, as well as the Democratic and 
Republican committee staff, for their 
hard work to build consensus and ad-
vance this important bipartisan pri-
ority. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
legislation. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
My 
good 
friend 
from 
Michigan 
thanked the Republican and Demo-
cratic staff. We have gone through a se-
ries of bills and have another one to go, 
most dealing with substance use dis-
orders, mental health, and suicide pre-
vention, and all of them brought to the 
floor in a bipartisan way. That happens 
with Members working together, but it 
also happens with staff working long 
hours together. We certainly appre-
ciate all of them who are here with us 
on the floor or not on the floor this 
afternoon. 
This is important. We did an over-
sight investigation. We did a com-
mittee investigation and saw what 
seemed to us obvious quantities of pills 
being distributed that should be raised 
to the attention of people. 
I think my friend from Michigan said 
it best when she said this is common 
sense, so we want to make sure we 
clarify the role of pharmaceutical man-
ufacturers and distributors. 
This is a good bill, and I urge its sup-
port. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
I appreciate my colleague from Ken-
tucky referencing the investigation 
that was done that led to this bill and 
other legislation. Many times, I think 
the public doesn’t realize that our com-
mittees do a lot of investigative work 
that leads to important legislation. 
This is certainly an example. 
Again, I thank Mrs. DINGELL, in par-
ticular, because this is something that 
I think will help us with the supply 
chain and, hopefully, deter opioid di-
version and trafficking. 
Madam Speaker, I urge bipartisan 
support, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 768. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

FAIRNESS IN ORPHAN DRUG 
EXCLUSIVITY ACT 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 1629) to amend the Federal

titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in 
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Kentucky (Mr. GUTHRIE) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on H.R. 1629. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I rise in support of H.R. 1629, the 
Fairness in Orphan Drug Exclusivity 
Act. The legislation will close a loop-
hole in the orphan drug program to en-
sure generic drugs can come to market 
and are not unfairly blocked by their 
brand competitors. 
This bill, which passed the House by 
a voice vote last Congress, takes steps 
to address two crises: one, the soaring 
cost of prescription drugs; and, two, 
the ongoing opioid crisis. It deserves 
our bipartisan support once again 
today. 
The Orphan Drug Act has been suc-
cessful in driving research and dis-
covery of new therapies to treat and 
even 
cure 
rare 
diseases. 
The 
law 
incentivizes the development of these 
therapies, including by awarding 7 
years of market exclusivity and two 
pathways for manufacturers to receive 
these incentives. 
Under the first pathway, orphan drug 
status may be awarded when manufac-
turers develop drugs approved to treat 
diseases with patient populations of 
200,000 or fewer. Under the second path-
way, through the rarely used cost re-
covery pathway, they may receive or-
phan drug status if drug research and 
development costs are not expected to 
be recouped by sales of the underlying 
drug. 
Now, under certain circumstances, a 
manufacturer may also get additional 
rounds of exclusivity for additional 
drugs in their portfolio if they treat 
the same condition and have the same 
active ingredient, even if the second 
drug does not meet the orphan drug 
qualifications. This provision has al-
lowed 
some 
manufacturers 
to 
cir-
cumvent the original intent of the Or-
phan 
Drug 
Act, 
which 
was 
to 
incentivize the creation of novel drugs 
for small populations. 
Because of this loophole, some manu-
facturers have been able to market 
widely used drugs to large populations, 
all while retaining exclusivity and 
blocking 
generic 
competition 
from 
coming to market. 
An example of this recently occurred 
when a formulation of bupe, a drug to 
treat opioid use disorder, was approved 
in 2017 and was allowed to carry the or-
phan drug designation granted to its 
manufacturer’s 
original 
bupe 
drug 
more than 20 years earlier in 1994. 
When the original 1994 orphan drug 
designation was granted, it was ex-
pected that this drug would not be pre-
scribed frequently. However, as the 
opioid crisis worsened, and our re-
sponse to the crisis evolved, millions 
were eventually prescribed the treat-
ment, generating billions in sales. 
Clearly, we knew in 2017 that bupe 
was not an orphan drug. Nevertheless, 
the drug was granted orphan drug sta-
tus and exclusivity, and that delayed 
additional forms of generic competi-
tion. 
While the FDA eventually recognized 
this issue with this particular drug and 
revoked its orphan drug designation, 
its exclusivity delayed generic com-
petition that otherwise would have 
been on the market. 
We need, Madam Speaker, every tool 
available to us to combat the opioid 
epidemic, including low-cost, afford-
able medication treatments, and loop-
holes like this one should not be al-
lowed to limit access to low-cost drugs. 
H.R. 1629 would stop this from hap-
pening again in the future. It requires 
drug manufacturers to demonstrate in 
their application to the FDA that each 
drug application considered under the 
cost recovery pathway would fail to re-
coup development costs. The legisla-
tion would also ensure that these rules 
apply to drugs already on the market. 
This bill is a narrowly tailored fix for 
a narrow but very real loophole in the 
law. I thank Representative DEAN from 
Pennsylvania for introducing this bill. 
It passed the House on a bipartisan 
basis, by voice vote, and without oppo-
sition last Congress. I look forward to 
it passing with bipartisan support 
again today and getting it through the 
Senate and to President Biden’s desk 
so it can become law. I urge all of my 
colleagues to support the bill. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of the Fairness in Orphan Drug 
Exclusivity Act. 
The Orphan Drug Act was enacted to 
incentivize the development of drugs 
for rare diseases by giving products 
that receive an orphan drug designa-
tion 7 years of market exclusivity, 
meaning a drug produced by another 
manufacturer that contains the same 
active ingredient to treat the same 
condition is barred from entering the 
market during this time. 
One way a drug can receive an or-
phan designation and, subsequently, 
market exclusivity is by the manufac-
turer’s demonstration that there is no 
reasonable expectation that the cost of 
developing the drug will be recovered. 
However, we have seen in recent years 
that some drug manufacturers, in an 
effort to block competitors from the 
market, have tried to take advantage 
of a loophole in the law. Existing law 
allows an orphan drug designation and 
market exclusivity to carry forward to 
future versions of the same drug with-
out requiring the manufacturer to 
demonstrate that the drug has not 
been, and remains unlikely to be, prof-
itable. 
This legislation will close that loop-
hole, requiring manufacturers to show 
there is no reasonable expectation that 
the cost of research and development 
will be covered for each successor drug, 
while still preserving incentives for or-
phan drug development. 
We must preserve incentives to inno-
vate while preventing bad actors from 
exploiting those incentives to benefit 
from a national crisis, as we saw dur-
ing the opioid epidemic. 
While no drug currently benefits 
from 
market 
exclusivity 
awarded 
through this mechanism, I remain con-
cerned about including language that 
allows for the retroactive revocation of 
an incentive through legislation. 
Legislation that sets a precedent of 
revoking a benefit awarded prior to en-
actment creates a slippery slope and 
could chill innovation if adopted else-
where in statute. While this bill itself 
is narrowly tailored, we do not want 
uncertainty caused by Congress retro-
actively legislating to discourage truly 
innovative drugs from coming to the

market, especially for the rare disease 
community. 
However, I will support this bill as it 
moves forward today as I believe it is 
important to prevent the abuse of this 
program in the future. I look forward 
to continuing discussions to come to a 
resolution on this outstanding concern 
as we work with the Senate to get this 
bill to the President’s desk. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as she may consume to 
the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania 
(Ms. DEAN), the author of this legisla-
tion, which is important because when-
ever we can encourage generics and 
make drugs more affordable, it is cer-
tainly to the benefit of the American 
people. 
b 1615 
Ms. DEAN. Madam Speaker, I thank 
Representative GUTHRIE and Chairman 
PALLONE for their support of this crit-
ical legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 1629, the Fairness in Orphan Drug 
Exclusivity Act. 
This crucial legislation would close a 
loophole in the current law that can be 
used to block competition in the phar-
maceutical marketplace. 
The Orphan Drug Act of 1983 provided 
incentives for prescription drug manu-
facturers to develop products to treat 
rare diseases. This includes an exclu-
sive 7-year marketing right for thera-
pies that receive an orphan drug des-
ignation. 
For a drug to qualify, it must either 
be a treatment for a disease or a condi-
tion that affects fewer than 200,000 peo-
ple in the United States, or is a drug 
intended for diseases that there is no 
reasonable expectation to recoup re-
search and development costs. 
This legislation focuses on the drugs 
intended for diseases that there is no 
reasonable expectation to recoup re-
search and development costs. It would 
require all drug manufacturers who ob-
tain orphan drug status to prove that 
they have no reasonable expectation 
that they will recover their research 
and development costs and efforts. 
This legislation works to prevent 
companies from continuing to use or-
phan drug exclusivity status for a 
newly approved drug, with an identical 
ingredient to the former version, with-
out having to prove the inability to re-
coup costs. 
This exact circumstance happened 
when 
a 
manufacturer 
of 
a 
buprenorphine 
product 
updated 
an 
older product that received orphan 
drug status and subsequently was given 
a renewed orphan drug exclusivity. 
Buprenorphine is used as a treatment 
for opioid use disorder to help those re-
covering 
from 
addiction. 
Unfortu-
nately, at the time, the opioid epi-
demic was raging. It was, by no means, 
a rare disease, and the drug was not a 
market loser. 
Closing this loophole will ensure that 
products do not receive an unfair mar-
ket advantage and, therefore, remains 
consistent with the spirit and intent of 
the Orphan Drug Act. We must work to 
ensure people can gain access to newer 
therapies and medically assisted treat-
ments that are potentially blocked due 
to orphan designation. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Representa-
tive MARC VEASEY for introducing this 
legislation along with me. I thank my 
colleagues in the House for passing this 
bill without objection on a voice vote 
just 6 months ago in the 116th Con-
gress. 
Again, I thank Chairman PALLONE 
for bringing this bill forward and for 
his leadership on substance use dis-
order and behavioral health issues 
more broadly. 
Madam Speaker, I urge Members to 
support this bill. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume for the purpose of closing. 
Madam Speaker, it is so important 
that we have the Orphan Drug Act. We 
have so many people who have rare dis-
eases come to our offices and visit us 
on Capitol Hill, as they should. Hope-
fully we will be able to do that again 
soon. It just touches your heart. Many 
of these diseases have so few people af-
fected by it; but if it is you or your 
child or somebody in your family, it is 
devastating. 
We have all seen the power of the pri-
vate marketplace to come in and 
produce these pharmaceuticals that 
make a difference. So we have to have 
provisions to allow these drugs to come 
into the marketplace and incentivize 
that private innovation moving for-
ward. 
But when people use that in order to 
move forward, this loophole has to be 
closed. I am glad that it is here, and it 
is these things that we need to work 
on. It is really not specifically here; it 
is just maybe a slippery slope in other 
places as we move forward. 
I thank my friend from Pennsylvania 
for bringing this forward, and the En-
ergy and Commerce Committee for ad-
dressing this, because we have to pre-
serve orphan drug status for those af-
flicted by the rarest and the most dev-
astating diseases. We also need to bring 
lower drug prices to Americans, and we 
can do that working together. 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate this 
being brought forward. I urge my col-
leagues to support this piece of legisla-
tion, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume for the purpose of closing. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Representa-
tive GUTHRIE for his remarks about 
trying to work together to lower the 
cost of prescription drugs. I thank Con-
gresswoman DEAN
because this is a 
part of that effort. 
As you will note, today, we had a 
whole package dealing with mental 
health, behavioral health, and other 
drug activities. It is very important 
that we move this whole package and 
try to get it passed in the Senate as 
quickly as possible. 
Madam Speaker, I urge support for 
this legislation on a bipartisan basis, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1629. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL 
EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO 
YEMEN—MESSAGE 
FROM 
THE 
PRESIDENT 
OF 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES (H. DOC. NO. 117–37) 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following message 
from the President of the United 
States; which was read and, together 
with the accompanying papers, referred 
to the Committee on Foreign Affairs 
and ordered to be printed: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides 
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90 
days prior to the anniversary date of 
its declaration, the President publishes 
in the Federal Register and transmits to 
the Congress a notice stating that the 
emergency is to continue in effect be-
yond the anniversary date. In accord-
ance with this provision, I have sent to 
the Federal Register for publication the 
enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional emergency declared in Executive 
Order 13611 of May 16, 2012, with respect 
to Yemen is to continue in effect be-
yond May 16, 2021. 
The actions and policies of certain 
former members of the Government of 
Yemen and others continue to threaten 
Yemen’s peace, security, and stability. 
These actions include obstructing the 
political process in Yemen and the im-
plementation of the agreement of No-
vember 23, 2011, between the, Govern-
ment of Yemen and those in opposition 
to it, which provided for a peaceful 
transition of power that meets the le-
gitimate demands and aspirations of 
the Yemeni people. For this reason, I 
have determined that it is necessary to 
continue the national emergency de-
clared in Executive Order 13611 with re-
spect to Yemen.

CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL 
EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO 
SECURING

COMMUNICATIONS 
TECH-
NOLOGY AND SERVICES SUPPLY 
CHAIN—MESSAGE 
FROM 
THE 
PRESIDENT 
OF 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES (H. DOC. NO. 117–38) 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following message 
from the President of the United 
States; which was read and, together 
with the accompanying papers, referred 
to the Committee on Foreign Affairs 
and ordered to be printed: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides 
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90 
days prior to the anniversary date of 
its declaration, the President publishes 
in the Federal Register and transmits to 
the Congress a notice stating that the 
emergency is to continue in effect be-
yond the anniversary date. 
In accordance with this provision, I 
have sent to the Federal Register for 
publication the enclosed notice stating 
that the national emergency declared 
in Executive Order 13873 of May 15, 
2019, with respect to securing the infor-
mation 
and 
communications 
tech-
nology and services supply chain, is to 
continue in effect beyond May 15, 2021. 
The unrestricted acquisition or use 
in the United States of information 
and communications technology or 
services designed, developed, manufac-
tured, or supplied by persons owned by, 
controlled by, or subject to the juris-
diction or direction of foreign adver-
saries augments the ability of these 
foreign adversaries to create and ex-
ploit vulnerabilities in information and 
communications technology or serv-
ices, with potentially catastrophic ef-
fects. This threat continues to pose an 
unusual and extraordinary threat to 
the national security, foreign policy, 
and economy of the United States. 
Therefore, I have determined that it is 
necessary to continue the national 
emergency declared in Executive Order 
13873 with respect to securing the infor-
mation 
and 
communications 
tech-
nology and services supply chain.

Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act with re-

NATIONAL MENTAL HEALTH 
AWARENESS MONTH 
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today as May marks National Mental 
Health Awareness month, a time when 
Americans recommit themselves to 
building better futures for those strug-
gling with a mental health condition, 
erasing the stigma around those seek-
ing help, and elevating barriers to high 
quality and timely mental health care. 
According to a 2020 report released by 
Congress’ Joint Economic Committee, 
over 40 percent of adults surveyed re-
ported a negative mental or behavioral 
health condition exacerbated by the 
coronavirus. Ending the mental health 
and addiction crises is a mission that 
can unite all of our communities be-
cause, just like mine in northern Ohio, 
there isn’t a single community that 
hasn’t struggled with both. 
I commend my colleagues with legis-
lation on the floor today, including 
Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN’s bill to reau-
thorize the Minority Fellowship Pro-
gram to support more students of color 
entering the mental health workforce, 
who are dedicated to addressing mental 
health disparities among underserved 
populations. 
It is time, and over time, for Con-
gress to take meaningful action, tar-
geting provider shortages, reimburse-
ment parity, housing support, treat-
ment, and more Federal funding to 
push the bounds of Federal research. 
We have strong allies in the adminis-
tration who care about these issues. I 
look forward to rolling up my sleeves 
to work with them, and across the 
aisle. We are only getting started. 
f 
RECOGNIZING LINDSEY WILSON 
COLLEGE FOOTBALL TEAM 
(Mr. COMER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the Lindsey Wilson 
College football team of Columbia, 
Kentucky, for winning the 2020 NAIA 
National Football Championship. 
The Lindsey Wilson football team 
finished their undefeated season as na-
tional champs Monday night, beating 
Northwestern College from Iowa 45–13, 
adding another championship to their 
season after already winning the Mid- 
South Conference. Even more impres-
sively, the Blue Raiders dominated op-
ponents every game during the regular 
season, outscoring them by an average 
of 32 points a game. 
Lindsey Wilson College did not have 
a football team from 1935 to 2009. Foot-
ball was reintroduced to campus in 
2010, after an 86-year absence, and it 
has not taken long for the Blue Raiders 
to reach the pinnacle of NAIA football. 
I commend Athletic Director Willis 
Pooler and Head Coach Chris Oliver for 
building a championship-caliber pro-
gram in just over a decade. This ac-
complishment is also a testament to 
every player’s hard work and dedica-
tion during an unprecedented year. 
Once again, congratulations to the 
national champion Lindsey Wilson Col-
lege football team on this outstanding 
achievement. 
f 
b 1915 
MENTAL HEALTH MONTH 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to commemorate Mental 
Health Month and to acknowledge as I 
presided today on the floor the number 
of mental health bills that were passed 
today ready to be approved by the Sen-
ate and as well to be signed by the 
President. 
Mr. Speaker, I worked closely with 
my constituents during COVID–19 and 
really worked with the city of Houston 
to use CARES money to develop a call 
center for the stressed people in my 
community. 
Mental health is real. Mental health 
issues are real, and it is imperative 
that we continue on the Federal level 
to provide the resources to help our 
families, to educate our families, to 
provide counseling for our families, 
and, yes, to provide an opportunity for 
them to call locally and nationally in a 
stressful 
situation. 
COVID–19 
was 
stressful, and many, I believe, lives 
were saved by the lifeline that we 
opened in the city of Houston that was 
on 7 days a week. 
I want to thank all of those pro-
viders, including Dr. Janice Dill, and 
again, the city of Houston who worked 
with us in Harris County to save lives. 
We must know that mental health is a 
medical issue, and we need to save 
lives, end the stigma, and recognize all 
of those who are embracing those who 
are sick and need help with respect to 
mental health. 
f 
VINCE DOOLEY 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to congratulate a Geor-
gia legend on his induction into the 
Georgia Military Veterans Hall of 
Fame Class of 2020. 
Coach Vince Dooley was inducted for 
his military service and his lifetime of 
selfless service to others. After grad-
uating from college, Coach Dooley 
served his country in the Marine Corps 
for 2 years. It is without question that 
Coach Dooley has had a positive im-
pact on the University of Georgia as 
well as communities across the coun-
try. 
During his 25 years as head football 
coach of the University of Georgia, the 
Bulldogs won six SEC titles and a na-
tional championship. Coach Dooley’s 
service did not stop on the field and 
has carried over into the community. 
His community service has extended to 
organizations such as the Heart Fund, 
Multiple Sclerosis, Juvenile Diabetes, 
Boy Scouts, Salvation Army, and Geor-
gia Easter Seals Society. 
He has also traveled abroad and led 
missions to provide spiritual and phys-
ical healing to those in need. 
I want to thank Coach Dooley for his 
selfless commitment to improving the 
lives of others, and I want to congratu-
late him on his induction. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF RAMON 
RAMIREZ OF ALLENTOWN, PENN-
SYLVANIA 
(Ms. WILD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. WILD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the memory of Ramon Rami-
rez of Allentown, Pennsylvania, who 
tragically lost his life to a senseless 
rampage of gun violence on April 21 
while he was filling up his work truck 
at a gas station in the wee hours of the 
morning. 
He was 31 years old. He was a hus-
band of 12 years and a father of three 
children. People remember him as a 
loving family man and a hard worker. 
He was someone who—as one of his 
neighbors put it—was always looking 
to make things better for those around 
him. That same neighbor remarked 
that lately she often heard Ramon and 
his son play basketball in front of their 
house. 
The horrific toll of gun violence 
across our country is puncturing the 
American Dream. It has stolen the 
hopes and lives of so many families. 
Mr. Speaker, I am not up here to ad-
vocate for any particular bill. I am up 
here to ask, beg, and plead that some-
body on the other side of the aisle 
come to me with their suggestions of 
what we can do to stop these random 
acts of gun violence. 
I want to work with my colleagues. 
We have to end this. I ask that all of 
my colleagues join me in paying trib-
ute to Ramon Ramirez and standing in 
solidarity with his family.

Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today during National Police Week to 
recognize the law enforcement officers 
serving on the front lines. Without 
them our streets would erupt into 
chaos, and the law and order our soci-
ety relies on would crumble. We have 
seen this happen already too much in 
this country. 
Our law enforcement officers have al-
ready incredibly difficult and dan-
gerous jobs. That is why recent attacks 
on law enforcement by extreme ele-
ments wanting to upend our society 
deeply sadden millions of Americans, 
myself included, who support the po-
lice. Instead of providing the resources 
to assist our police, these radicals want 
to defund our police departments alto-
gether. 
This is insanity. We should ask our-
selves how we can help police do their 
jobs more safely and effectively, not 
vilify them. 
I am proud to back the blue. The ma-
jority of Americans who recognize 
their security and well-being depend 
upon the police to back the blue too. 
All our law enforcement officers who 
serve us so faithfully should know that 
they have our sincere thanks and ap-
preciation, not only during Police Ap-
preciation Week, but always.

ELECTION INTEGRITY 
(Mr. GAETZ asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. GAETZ. Mr. Speaker, it is with 
great concern that I report to the 
House that the Civil Rights Division of 
the Biden Justice Department is actu-
ally working against the civil rights 
and the voting rights of our citizens. 
Brave patriots in Arizona have un-
dertaken an election audit to ensure 
that an actual human being is attached 
to a vote that was cast. This will in-
form better public policy prospec-
tively. But Pamela Karlan, the head of 
the Civil Rights Division of the Biden 
Justice Department, has worked to 
stop that endeavor, and we know Dr. 
Karlan from her testimony in the Judi-
ciary Committee where she made fun 
of President Trump’s son’s name and 
where she said that conservative Re-
publicans didn’t want to even live 
around one another because apparently 
we are so repulsive. 
This is deeply unfortunate. This per-
son should not even have a job at the 
Justice Department, and she certainly 
should not be working to perpetuate 
the true big lie and that is that there 
is not a tremendous amount of work 
left to be done on election integrity.

CANCEL CULTURE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
KAHELE). Under the Speaker’s an-
nounced policy of January 4, 2021, the 
gentleman from Colorado (Mr. BUCK) is 
recognized for 60 minutes as the des-
ignee of the minority leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unani-
mous consent that Members have 5 leg-
islative days to revise and extend their 
remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Colorado? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, cancel cul-
ture is a dangerous phenomenon, the 
total silencing and erasing of people 
and truths the progressives dislike. 
Americans are beginning to see what 
cancel culture is really about. A recent 
survey found that 64 percent of Ameri-
cans now believe cancel culture is a 
threat to freedom. 
Cancel culture aims not only to can-
cel certain elements of society but to 
replace them. Consider the following: 
for years, the political left has at-
tempted to erase parts of our American 
history, especially our founding and 
the story of 1776. 
Why? 
Because their goal is replacement. In 
place of America’s true history, the 
progressives want to push the 1619 
Project. This false narrative presents 
students with an alternate history and 
an alternate reality that our Nation 
was founded not on the principles out-
lined in the Declaration of Independ-
ence but instead on a racist pursuit of 
expanding 
slavery. 
Canceling 
1776 
makes sense only in the broader con-
text of this effort to advance a false 
narrative. 
Other areas of curriculum are being 
canceled in favor of critical race the-
ory. Just last week, the Biden adminis-
tration announced that it will use tax-
payer funds to push critical race the-
ory in public schools across the Nation. 
Critical race theory is the backdoor 
way to teach Marxism to students and 
adults in this country under the guise 
of pushing equity. 
In my State of Colorado, the oil and 
gas industry is being canceled. 
The goal? 
Replace it with Green New Deal ob-
jectives. 
Schools named after our Founders 
must be renamed after liberal icons ac-
cording to the left. Professors and jour-
nalists who will not kowtow to the pro-
gressive agenda find themselves re-
placed in their jobs. 
Our list of examples could go on. 
I am joined tonight by my colleagues 
who wish to help expose cancel culture. 
The examples we will highlight touch 
on all aspects of cancel culture, but 
they all have one thing in common: in 
each instance, progressives seek to 
cancel, cut, censor, and silence so they 
can move to the next phase: replace-
ment culture. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Arizona (Mr. BIGGS), who is my 
good friend. 
Mr. BIGGS. Cancel culture is eroding 
the very foundation of who we are as 
an American people. Rowan Atkinson, 
the star of the British TV series 
‘‘Maigret’’ said that it is like a medie-
val mob coming to burn witches. That 
is what the cancel culture is all about. 
How about taking an analogy from 
George 
Orwell’s 
‘‘Nineteen 
Eighty- 
Four’’ novel where they take history 
and they throw it into the chute. They 
revise history constantly, and you 
can’t even control what you think any-
more, Mr. Speaker. That is what cancel 
culture is becoming. 
How about from a book called ‘‘The 
Girl With Seven Names’’ about a coura-
geous young woman who escaped from 
North Korea and she tells us how North 
Korea did the same thing? 
How about China under the Chinese 
Communist Party as reported in ‘‘The 
Hundred-Year Marathon’’ by Mr. Pills-
bury who wrote that book? 
That is what we see happening, this 
attempt to erase who we are as individ-
uals and then replace them with some-
thing else. 
Let me give you some other exam-
ples. Pepe Le Pew is no longer toler-
ated by the left and by the woke mob. 
Miss Piggy is canceled. Dr. Seuss books 
are canceled. 
Here are some others. How about this 
one: Goya Foods, because this guy had 
the temerity, Robert Unanue, who is 
the CEO of Goya Foods, had the temer-
ity to support President Trump so peo-
ple attempted to boycott and cancel 
his business. Senator JOSH
HAWLEY 
wrote a book. He is canceled because he 
says that he wants election integrity. 
How about Washington, Lincoln, and 
Jefferson? 
San Francisco erases those schools 
named after Washington, Lincoln, or 
Jefferson. 
Matthew Yglesias, the liberal opinion 
writer who resigned from Vox, a com-
pany that he cofounded, because his 
woke staff says he is too center right. 
How about Tucker Carlson, Sean 
Hannity, and Laura Ingraham? 
They were all attacked for being con-
servative voices. 
The attack is to silence conserv-
atives’ voices. The new rule is we will 
only be tolerant if you are accepting of 
our views—not just accepting—if you 
comply—not just comply—you bow to 
the tyrannical rules of the left. 
Gina Carano, the ‘‘Mandalorian’’ ac-
tress, was fired by Disney because she 
says that being a Republican in 2021 is 
like being a Jew in Nazi, Germany. So 
she has got to go. They canceled the 
action figure named after her. 
Adam Rubenstein, a former New 
York Times reporter and editor, has 
got to go because he lets TOM COTTON’s 
piece get published in The New York 
Times. Oops. We can’t have that. 
J. K. Rowling, the very successful au-
thor of the Harry Potter series, is can-
celed because she has the temerity to 
suggest that transgender rights might 
endanger women’s rights. You can’t 
have any conflicting view out there, 
Mr. Speaker. No, you can’t do that. 
Then Mike Lindell, you know him, he 
is the My Pillow guy. He is on TV all

the time advertising. You can’t have 
him because he is a friend and sup-
porter of Donald Trump and questions 
the election results. 
We have reached the point in our so-
ciety where the left says that if you do 
not bow your knee to what we say is 
the new norm—and the only acceptable 
dogma—if you are a heterodox in any 
way, Mr. Speaker, we will cancel you, 
we will dock you, and we will erase 
you. That cannot stand, and it will not 
stand. 
This group and the gentleman from 
Colorado will continue to fight. I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. We will 
continue to fight this outrageous at-
tack on who we are as American peo-
ple. 
Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman for his remarks. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) 
for a slightly different purpose. She 
will tell us about a very sad cir-
cumstance in her home State of North 
Carolina. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
colleague for yielding tonight for a 
very short but very serious and solemn 
set of comments. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay trib-
ute to two members of the Watauga 
County Sheriff’s Office who lost their 
lives in the line of duty on April 28. 
Sergeant Chris Ward, an 8-year law 
enforcement officer, and K–9 Deputy 
Logan Fox, a former deputy of the 
Ashe County Sheriff’s Office, left an in-
delible mark on Watauga County. 
This is a tremendous loss not only 
for Watauga County, but also for law 
enforcement across the State and coun-
try. These two fallen heroes dedicated 
their lives to law enforcement, and 
many who knew them recognized that 
their passion for serving the commu-
nity they were proud to call home was 
second to none. 
This Monday, a Community Day of 
Remembrance in Boone, North Caro-
lina, was held in their honor. 
Businesses, organizations, and proud 
citizens of Watauga County came to-
gether to show their overwhelming 
support for law enforcement and for 
first responders. 
Mr. Speaker, across America law en-
forcement officers like Sergeant Ward 
and Deputy Fox wake up every day 
with one important goal in mind: ful-
filling their duty to uphold law and 
order. These proud men and women 
leave for work knowing that they may 
not come home to their families, but 
still, they answer the call to serve 
without a moment’s hesitation. That 
level of commitment to one’s duty and 
community is truly awe-inspiring, and 
I firmly believe that we owe law en-
forcement a profound debt of gratitude. 
Mr. Speaker, I will always support 
law enforcement across this country. 
They are true gatekeepers of law and 
order, and they must be respected. 
Calls to defund the police from the 
left are egregious and divisive. That 
rhetoric is profoundly dangerous and is 
an insult to the men and women who 
work around the clock to protect us. 
God bless the countless law enforce-
ment officers across this country and 
their families. We are forever grateful 
for the sacrifices you continue to 
make. 
b 1930 
Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentlewoman from North Carolina for 
her comments, and I assure her that 
our thoughts and prayers are with her 
and the families of those who have fall-
en. 
I yield to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. ROY). 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman from Colorado for orga-
nizing this important topic of con-
versation. 
I thank the gentlewoman from North 
Carolina for recognizing the law en-
forcement officers in her home State, 
much like the rest of our States, who 
put their lives on the line every single 
day to defend us, to protect our com-
munities. 
This is an important week, obvi-
ously, for law enforcement. I think it is 
germane to the point that my friend 
from Colorado is making about can-
celing because this whole notion of 
canceling isn’t just about corporations; 
it is not just about technology; it is 
not just about Amazon; it is not just 
about Twitter and Facebook. It is 
about canceling the very people who 
are, like our friend from North Caro-
lina was just talking about, these law 
enforcement officers—canceling police 
officers, canceling law enforcement, 
canceling those who are standing up 
and defending us every single day. 
We hear it. I had a little girl in my 
home district in Austin who wrote a 
project for her school in which she was 
outlining how she was upset about how 
her father, her dad, who is a police offi-
cer, was being treated and how, when 
he would come home, he was despond-
ent a little bit about the day because 
our law enforcement officers are being 
harassed, targeted, criticized, mocked, 
defunded. 
This is purposeful. This is happening 
every single day. We are literally 
working to cancel law enforcement. 
In Austin, Texas, they defunded po-
lice $150 million. Now, we have seen a 
50 percent spike in homicides. There 
are homeless encampments all across 
the streets. We have 1999 levels of fund-
ing for the police department for a city 
that has grown by leaps and bounds 
since then. 
This canceling of law enforcement 
leaves us at risk, and it undermines the 
very security of our communities. But 
it is real, and it is happening in real- 
time. 
Twenty major cities have cut police 
budgets. $1.7 billion has been cut from 
police departments nationwide. 
But it is not just law enforcement. 
We are talking about that here because 
of my friend from North Carolina. But 
it is about corporations. We are sitting 
here in the people’s House, in front of 
the American flag, and our Nation 
right now is increasingly run by cor-
porations more than the men and 
women who are in this body. 
I mean, think about it. We hardly 
ever meet. We never amend. We never 
debate. We never do any actual give- 
and-take here on the floor. We get up 
and speechify a little bit. 
Meanwhile, corporations are deciding 
who gets to get their voice heard. Cor-
porations are deciding, by the way, 
what election laws are warranted in 
Georgia or Texas, venerable corpora-
tions like Coca-Cola, Delta Air Lines, 
Major League Baseball. 
In the United States of America, 
baseball has been politicized. I can’t 
even watch baseball with my son with-
out having to figure out and worry 
about how he is going to be viewing 
America because Major League Base-
ball has decided it is more important 
to be woke and move the All-Star 
Game from 50 percent Black Atlanta to 
10 percent Black Denver. Why? So they 
can go around patting themselves on 
the back in Colorado while they say: 
Hey, look at me. I am driving my 
Subaru, and I have an Apple sticker on 
my car. 
No offense to the gentleman from 
Colorado. 
Is that woke? 
Hank Aaron passed away this year. 
We could have celebrated his life with 
an All-Star Game in Atlanta, Georgia, 
and woke corporate Major League 
Baseball decides it is more important 
to make a statement about election 
laws in Georgia, which, by the way, the 
proposed laws differ very little from 
the laws in Colorado, as my friend from 
Colorado knows. 
But they wanted to make a state-
ment through their corporate power 
and their woke corporate boards that 
are packed with all these elite Harvard 
Business School and Yale school of 
business types that are going into 
these corporate boardrooms and trying 
to tell us how to live our lives in little 
ole Texas or Georgia or Colorado. That 
is what we face with these corporations 
that are trying to tell us how to live. 
I appreciate my friend from Colorado 
giving us the time to focus on this im-
portant issue tonight. We have to re-
claim our ability to live free in this 
country, and we ought to ask ourselves 
that question more and more: Are we 
truly free with wide-open borders and 
half a million apprehensions, $30 tril-
lion in debt, and corporations telling 
us how to live our lives? Are we truly 
free in this country? I think we ought 
to ask that question over and over and 
over. 
Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
friend from Texas, and I appreciate the 
points that he made. 
I yield to the gentleman from Ten-
nessee (Mr. GREEN). 
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speak-
er, before I jump into my remarks, I 
would like to echo what my colleague 
from Texas said.

The 
interesting 
thing 
about 
the 
Major League Baseball decision is, only 
2 days before they decided that voter 
ID was too tough for them, they signed 
a deal with Tencent in China, where 
there are no elections whatsoever and 
where they are committing cultural 
genocide against the Uighurs. 
That wasn’t good enough in Georgia, 
but they signed a deal for millions of 
dollars to support what is going on in 
China. 
Mr. Speaker, as a physician, I recog-
nize that cancel culture is a sickness in 
our society. It is easy to diagnose, but 
we have to admit it is going to be dif-
ficult to cure because we are fighting 
the woke media and the woke left. 
The left is using cancel culture to 
tear our country apart in its quest for 
their version of a utopia. They demon-
ize conservatives as an enemy of a na-
tion that we love and hold dear. But no 
one is safe from cancel culture, not 
even the liberals themselves. 
Who 
has 
advanced 
progressivism 
more than Barack Obama during his 8 
years as President? No one. Yet, left-
ists 
today 
are 
canceling 
Barack 
Obama, who was, until recently, their 
self-proclaimed hero. In his home State 
of Illinois, Thomas Jefferson Middle 
School was supposed to be renamed the 
Barack and Michelle Obama Middle 
School; that is, until the far radical 
left protested that Obama followed the 
laws in some instances by deporting il-
legal immigrants. 
God forbid that a President, tasked 
in the Constitution to enforce the law, 
actually enforces the law. 
So, please, my colleagues on the left, 
tell me how my colleagues on the right 
are safe from cancel culture when your 
side of the aisle isn’t even safe. Iconic 
figures on the left are being canceled. 
Just the other week, the famed athe-
ist Richard Dawkins, who many fellow 
Christians and I find incredibly offen-
sive for his bigoted attacks on our 
faith, was just canceled. Dawkins was 
stripped of his Humanist of the Year 
Award that he received back in 1996. Of 
what was he found guilty? He believed 
that a civil discussion on what con-
stitutes gender was legitimate. Can-
celed. 
A professor even canceled lecturing 
on the writings of James Baldwin, 
known for his participation in the civil 
rights and gay liberation movements, 
because his students said it made them 
‘‘relive intergenerational trauma.’’ 
Matthew Yglesias, the founder of the 
liberal news website Vox, has been can-
celed simply because he didn’t want to 
defund the police. Canceled. 
Again, my colleagues on the left, tell 
me how cancel culture doesn’t exist, 
and tell me that conservatives aren’t 
being attacked. 
Who are these conservatives getting 
canceled? 
Well, the left tried unsuccessfully, as 
was mentioned earlier, to cancel Goya 
Foods executive Robert Unanue be-
cause he supported Donald Trump. 
President 
Abraham 
Lincoln, 
who 
ended the Democrat Party’s institution 
of slavery, is being canceled. 
Lincoln’s general, President Ulysses 
S. Grant: Canceled. 
Covington Catholic children—yes, I 
said children—were completely slan-
dered with lies by the left-wing media 
simply because they happened to be 
wearing MAGA hats. 
Senate Democrats tried to cancel 
Justice Amy Coney Barrett because 
she actually believes what her Catholic 
faith teaches. 
Vice President KAMALA HARRIS tried 
to cancel a lower court appointee just 
3 years ago because he was a member of 
the Catholic charitable group Knights 
of Columbus. Apparently, they hold the 
controversial view that we shouldn’t 
terminate the lives of innocent, unborn 
children. 
Enough is enough. If we want our 
country to continue to prosper, we 
need to stop seeing each other as polit-
ical enemies and candidates for can-
cellation. We need to remember the 
motto on the great seal above my head 
as I speak: E pluribus unum, out of 
many, one. 
We are a nation of many different 
States, 
localities, 
ethnicities, 
reli-
gions, backgrounds, and political be-
liefs. We need to stop focusing on our 
differences and start seeing each other 
as Americans, once again, regardless of 
what we believe. 
Cancel culture is anti-American and, 
for the sake of our Nation, it needs to 
end now. I urge my Democrat col-
leagues to join us in this. Your own 
icons are being canceled. You will be 
the next victim. You will be assimi-
lated. 
Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman for his impassioned remarks 
and great research. We could all learn 
a lot from that. I appreciate it very 
much. 
I yield to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. CLOUD). 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman from Colorado for orga-
nizing this. This is an essential topic in 
this essential time that we find our-
selves. 
We have a unique foundation, in that 
our Nation rests on the understanding 
that our inalienable rights to life, lib-
erty, and the pursuit of happiness are 
not a grant from this government but, 
rather, a gift from God. 
Among these inalienable rights en-
shrined in our First Amendment is the 
freedom of speech. Indeed, the peace 
and tranquility of our entire Republic 
rest on the understanding that the peo-
ple have a right to have their voice 
heard. 
But we have entered into a most 
troubling time in our Nation. For all 
the talk of unity by this current ad-
ministration, 
this 
government 
has 
sought only conformity. 
In this Chamber, we have witnessed 
the unilateral march of the extreme- 
left legislation designed not to protect 
our liberties but, rather, force the 
American people to conform to their 
extreme ideas of government-mandated 
social engineering and the restruc-
turing of an economy from the most 
successful model in history to one of 
socialism, which has failed everywhere 
it has been tried. 
Then there is Big Tech. These compa-
nies that arose to prominence in an en-
vironment that only economic freedom 
and opportunity provide have now em-
braced authoritarianism, fostering a 
world that is worse than the one they 
hoped to correct. 
They have selectively canceled con-
servative voices while allowing leftist 
members, even in this body, to repeat-
edly call for unrest in our streets and 
violence against dissenting voices. 
They have allowed their platforms to 
raise money to bail out violent rioters, 
these true insurrectionists who have 
called for an end to America, that have 
burned our flags and literally taken 
over city blocks, declaring them auton-
omous to the United States. 
Yes, these Big Tech platforms con-
tinue to provide a platform for Com-
munist China, for terrorist groups, and 
others to spew their propaganda. 
Then there are the multinational 
corporations that have bought into 
this diabolical movement. They are ei-
ther ignorant to history or simply care 
more about their quarterly earnings re-
port than the liberty, opportunity, or 
personal prosperity of their neighbors, 
the American people. 
They would rather cozy up to the 
powerful to gain access to crush their 
competition and to protect corporate 
profits than stand up for the very prin-
ciples and economic opportunity that 
enabled their own success. They do a 
disservice to the people of this Nation. 
The hypocrisy is not overlooked. 
To some in our Nation who have ex-
perienced the relative peace and secu-
rity that comes with being heirs of 
these blessings of liberty, these trends 
could seem novel or perhaps part of the 
natural ebb and flow of politics in a 
free society. 
Sometimes it is harder for us born 
here to see the signs, but some of the 
most compelling voices sounding the 
alarm right now are the immigrants 
who come here. I have spoken to many 
from Cuba, Ecuador, Iran, and Ven-
ezuela. They see the signs in a way 
that many of us do not, and they are 
fearful, angered, and heartbroken. 
b 1945 
Venezuela, just a few short years ago, 
was the economic jewel of South Amer-
ica. Today, it is a wasteland fraught 
with poverty, conflict, and oppression. 
A couple in my district came from 
Iran. They are terrified by what they 
are now seeing here. One of them liked 
a post about the killing of Soleimani 
and found her account temporarily 
halted on the platform. The irony is 
too rich. 
I spoke to a lady from Ecuador. She 
had come to this country at about 18 
years of age with her family. Under se-
vere persecution, she had fled the coun-
try to come here. She didn’t refer to 
this as the United States of America.

She said: ‘‘I come to freedom country. 
We have to do everything we can to 
protect freedom country.’’ Those were 
her words. 
So we know that while the termi-
nology and the methods may be new, 
the cancel culture movement is hardly 
new to history. Despotic regimes have 
worked to silence dissent for millennia. 
What is different about this moment 
is the broad embrace of the movement 
by those in positions of power within 
the United States of America in order 
to consolidate political power or per-
haps preserve their personal status 
quo, all at the sake of the liberties of 
their fellow citizens. 
Ronald Reagan reminded us that 
freedom is never more than one genera-
tion away from extinction. We didn’t 
pass it to our children in the blood-
stream. It must be fought for, pro-
tected, and handed on for them to do 
the same, or one day we will spend our 
sunset years telling our children and 
our children’s children what it was 
once like to live in the United States 
where men were free. 
It is time to restore power to the 
American people. It is time for people 
across this Nation to stand up in board-
rooms and classrooms and houses of 
worship and in this hallowed Chamber, 
to stand up with courage to this evil 
movement. 
God forbid we be the generation that 
allows this precious and unique experi-
ment in self-government, this imper-
fect but beautiful Republic, to sink, en-
veloped by the undertow of the forces 
of envy, strife, and division. Let us not 
let that happen. 
Let us be that generation, like gen-
erations before, that work toward that 
more perfect union, one that protects 
and preserves our beloved freedom 
country. 
Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. 
PERRY). 
Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I surely 
thank my good friend, the gentleman 
from Colorado, for the opportunity to 
speak and the importance of this sub-
ject. 
Ladies and gentlemen, in the thirties 
and forties, they banned and burned 
books. That was just what they had at 
the time. They weren’t really banning 
the book; they were banning and burn-
ing the idea—the ideas, the differences 
of opinion. I submit to you that that 
fascist regime then did what this can-
cel culture is doing right now. 
We have already talked about Major 
League Baseball canceling the All-Star 
Game in Atlanta and acting like we 
don’t know that there are more restric-
tive States elsewhere, including the 
State that it went to. It is absolutely 
ridiculous. 
Facebook canceled the Great Bar-
rington Declaration, a declaration of 
medical professionals and scientists 
who declared that lockdowns had ad-
verse effects on physical and mental 
health and we would be better served 
by focusing on the protection of people 
who face a high risk of mortality 
should they become infected. 
How dare they. How dare they not ac-
cept the narrative, the dogma, the 
groupthink. Who do they think they 
are? 
Google 
fired 
employee 
Kevin 
Cernekee for the crime—what was his 
crime? He held conservative views. 
How about OSU Coach Mike Gundy? 
What was his crime? Wearing the 
wrong T-shirt while fishing. 
That is how absurd this gets. And it 
just keeps on going, ladies and gentle-
men. It doesn’t stop. 
Of course, President Trump, the 
President of the United States, was 
canceled by big tech, banned from 
Twitter, likely permanently banned 
from Facebook and, as has already 
been stated, by the same companies 
doing business with and helping the 
Communist Chinese Government op-
press its citizens, the same companies 
that allow the Ayatollah to freely 
transmit over their platform. No prob-
lem there. And it just keeps on going. 
I mean, the President talked about 
hydroxychloroquine in the early stages 
of the pandemic as a potential solution 
or treatment. Man, who knows? I 
mean, it has been around since the 
1940s. How dare he. And how dare the 
doctors who believe in him and believe 
the same thing. Who do they think 
they are when the press and the cancel 
culture says no way? 
Of course, the worst of it, a Rep-
resentative right here in this body, the 
gentlewoman from Missouri, and 54 of 
her colleagues sought to cancel 140 
Members of Congress for objecting to 
the electors in several States due to 
the election irregularities and con-
stitutional infractions in these States, 
including my home State of Pennsyl-
vania. They introduced H. Res. 25, call-
ing for the removal of those Members 
from the House of Representatives. 
They don’t bother telling you that 
they themselves objected to more 
States in 2016 than the Republicans did 
in 2020. Let’s cancel them. Free speech 
has been canceled. 
If you want to protest and burn your 
city down, protest is great. Violence 
and rioting is not accepted, except 
when it is. But think you are going to 
the church in the same town? Canceled. 
Your right to protest. You can riot, 
yes. But come to the Capitol and ad-
dress your grievances with your elected 
representatives, no. 
Ladies and gentlemen, cancel culture 
is a synonym for fascism; and the soon-
er we recognize it, the better off we are 
going to be at dealing with it. 
Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman for not naming my home 
State as he was talking about the All- 
Star Game. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the 
gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. TIF-
FANY), and I thank him for joining us 
in this Special Order hour. 
Mr. TIFFANY. Mr. Speaker: 
I do not like the cancel mob. 
I do not like the groupthink blob. 
We should not censor our own speech. 
That’s not a habit we should teach. 
This isn’t China or Iran. 
Free speech belongs to every man. 
This right belongs to women, too. 
To teachers, students, me and you. 
Don’t let them tell you what to say. 
Or what to think or how to pray. 
America’s for you and me. 
For Dr. Seuss—not Jack Dorsey. 
I thank the Speaker for the time. 
And hope you liked my free speech rhyme. 
Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman, and I suggest he is in the 
wrong line of work. That was great. I 
thank him very much for that. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the 
gentleman from Georgia (Mr. CLYDE). 
Mr. CLYDE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman from Colorado for hosting 
this Special Order on this very impor-
tant and increasingly pervasive issue 
in our society: Cancel culture. 
I hold very deep concerns about how 
this ugly movement is corrupting our 
youth and stands to seriously threaten 
the many core values shared by those 
in my district, those from north Geor-
gia: altruism, patriotism, faith, and in-
tegrity, just to name a few. 
While calling people out on their ac-
tions and/or behaviors is nothing new 
in our society, there is something in-
herently dangerous about fringe groups 
of people moving in a calculated man-
ner to strip people of jobs, to strip 
businesses of revenue, and shutting 
down entire thought groups altogether, 
without a fair and just consideration 
being afforded to the targeted party. 
Each of us has an understanding of 
what is right and wrong, just as we, as 
lawmakers, have our own ideas for 
what is good policy and what is not. We 
can debate and defend our personal 
opinions and sincerely held beliefs all 
we want, but when rights enshrined by 
the Constitution are at risk, I believe 
we have a duty to step up and defend 
those rights. 
Whether we are talking about stand-
ing up for God-given, unalienable reli-
gious liberties, Second Amendment 
rights or First Amendment protec-
tions, I wholeheartedly believe that we 
should also be pointing to the truth 
within the Constitution. 
It is easy to point to the Constitution 
as a blanketed rationale for countless 
issues. Both sides do it, and I find it 
does the public a disservice at large on 
two fronts, especially when one side 
just doesn’t tell the truth. 
For one, I believe blanketed state-
ments pointing to enumerated rights 
inadvertently desensitizes Americans, 
especially our youth, to the impor-
tance of the Constitution. 
Secondly, we are not challenging our-
selves to push beyond the emotional 
sphere of these issues and to think 
critically and analytically to find the 
truth. 
So we, as conservatives, need to 
stand up to cancel culture in two ways. 
First, the Constitution has provided 
the basis for which the canceled indi-
vidual and the ‘‘cancelor’’ engage in de-
bate to begin with.

Second, we should be putting truth 
behind our decision to stand up in de-
fense of those being targeted. 
For example, I stand here today to 
oppose the progressive push to cancel 
biological genders, to cancel religious 
liberties, and to cancel the Second 
Amendment. Probably the most bold 
example of cancel culture that I have 
ever seen is that of Facebook and Twit-
ter trying to cancel the sitting Presi-
dent of the United States, Donald 
Trump. 
I stand in defense of biological gen-
ders because the truth is that women 
are biologically different from men. 
Young men should not have to compete 
against 
self-identified 
transgenders 
who are biological men. Moreover, the 
truth is that women are the bearers of 
life, and only women can give birth. 
Call them what they are. Moms are 
moms, not birthing people. 
How ridiculous is that term, ‘‘birth-
ing people’’? 
How about H.R. 5, the Equality Act. 
That was another brazen attempt by 
progressives to cancel biological sex by 
normalizing transgender equality. 
As I have said before and will say 
again, transgender medical treatment 
for children is child abuse, and any ef-
fort to normalize such treatments is a 
serious violation of the welfare and 
bodily integrity of our children. Allow-
ing children to undergo life-changing 
alterations to their bodies should be a 
violation of the law, and the child 
abuser should be criminally prosecuted 
to the fullest extent of the law. 
I oppose efforts by progressives to 
cancel religious liberties in their en-
tirety. While I could speak at length 
about the various targets of cancel cul-
ture that fall under religious liberties, 
there is no better example than the 
Democrats’ bill on the floor this week, 
H.R. 1065, that blatantly and know-
ingly leaves out protections for reli-
gious entities, as prescribed under the 
Civil Rights Act of 1964. 
Under this act, a religious employer 
could have to consider allowing an em-
ployee to take paid time off to have an 
abortion procedure. While religious lib-
erty protections are the center of this 
cancellation attempt, the truth is that 
an unborn child is a living, human 
child, and we must protect it as such. 
I stand strong against the Demo-
crats’ all-out attack on the Second 
Amendment, because it is no secret 
they are trying to cancel Americans’ 
right to keep and bear arms in a piece-
meal manner. The truth is that law- 
abiding gun owners are not the per-
petrators of violent crimes. However, 
law-abiding gun owners will bear the 
brunt of the impact from this ploy. The 
facts are on the side of the law-abiding 
gun owners. 
The Democrats know that and they 
just can’t stand it. That is why Demo-
crats are rolling out rules to ban guns 
piece by piece so that guns in the 
homes of Americans, as we speak, be-
come outlawed over time. They do this 
under the guise of abolishing firearms 
made at home by individuals by calling 
them ghost guns. 
The truth is that we see through this 
thinly veiled facade, and we will not sit 
by and allow them to cancel our rights. 
Finally, I challenge all of my col-
leagues to not just stand up to the can-
cel culture in the name of the Con-
stitution, but to do so by adding truth 
to the dialogue. 
Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. DONALDS). 
Mr. DONALDS. Mr. Speaker, I want 
to thank the gentleman from Colorado 
for hosting the Special Order. 
I will also tell you, Mr. Speaker, it is 
actually good to be able to talk in this 
Chamber without that thing on my 
face. It is messing up the enunciations. 
Mr. Speaker, my colleagues have 
talked at length about all of the exam-
ples and all of the damaging aspects of 
cancel culture, and I don’t want to go 
through and reiterate those points. 
I think the purpose—what I want to 
take this time to do, Mr. Speaker, is to 
actually have a pleading with the peo-
ple of our country. 
You see, if you look at the history of 
world governments, even go before our 
own Government, the ability to speak 
has been sacrosanct in order for the 
ability to be free. 
You see, there was a time, under the 
brutality of European kings, where you 
could dare not speak a word against 
the Crown. If you did, you were slaugh-
tered, you were maimed, you were put 
into chains, you were put into slavery. 
The very idea of freedom of speech 
canonized in our Constitution just 
wasn’t created by our Framers; it is 
something our Framers understood and 
they studied from their view of world 
history. And that very protection is 
the one thing, the most paramount 
thing, that the Members of this body, 
whether they be in our House, the Sen-
ate, or the person who occupies the 
White House at any point in time in 
American history, can never abridge or 
infringe. 
The reason for that is very simple: 
Because the thoughts that roll around 
in your mind are yours alone. They are 
your thoughts. They were given by 
God. They were given by your own in-
tellect. And your ability to express 
them should never be taken away or 
shamed by a government or by a sect 
or a substructure of any society, let 
alone American society. 
b 2000 
You see, Mr. Speaker, we have come 
to a very dangerous point in our poli-
tics. This has nothing to do with Social 
Security and Medicare which, by the 
way, for the American people, are 
going to go insolvent in somewhere be-
tween 5 and 7 years. 
This isn’t about our issues talking 
about guns and supporting the Second 
Amendment. This isn’t about if you 
want to talk about green technology or 
embracing fossil fuels or actually em-
bracing nuclear power, which is what 
we should be doing as a country. This 
isn’t our views on what we do with re-
spect to foreign policy and who our ad-
versary might be. 
This goes to the very core of our 
country. It goes to the very core of our 
culture. It goes to the very core of 
whether our society will have the abil-
ity to sustain itself for another 200 
years into the future. 
But I will promise you this, Mr. 
Speaker, it will not be possible if we 
have one group of Americans telling 
another group of Americans that what 
they say should no longer be heard 
simply because they don’t agree or 
even if they are offended or even if 
what somebody says is so vile that uni-
laterally every American finds it to be 
distasteful and doesn’t want to hear it. 
You see, the very thought of any in-
dividual must be protected at all times. 
It is what separates our country from 
the other countries of the world today 
and the other societies on our Earth in 
years past. It is what creates the very 
foundation of a republic of people to be 
able to grow, to see, to do, to be their 
best, because they are free, and there is 
no government that can oppress them. 
The only example I am going to cite 
tonight is the example of somebody 
who is actually not on my side of the 
political aisle. She is a reporter, Alexi 
McCammond. And Alexi, just so you 
know, I am not bringing your situation 
up to make a political point. Far from 
it. You see, she was a journalist. She 
was on MSNBC and an NBC contrib-
utor. I don’t think she would probably 
like my politics too much. But because 
of something she said when she was a 
freshman in college on social media, 
she was targeted. She was canceled. 
She had reached a pinnacle in her ca-
reer through her hard work. I don’t 
even know her, but I know that she was 
able to accomplish something. But be-
cause somebody in her company, be-
cause of somebody at Teen Vogue de-
cided they didn’t like what she had 
said, she became the new target. 
Mr. Speaker, and frankly, my fellow 
Americans, we cannot continue as a so-
ciety if we are quick to shut each other 
down before we actually decide to open 
up our ears and listen. There are so 
many debates on this very floor that 
are going to take place, not just in this 
Congress, but in many Congresses to 
come. There are going to be disagree-
ments in our society, whether you are 
talking about policing or racism or the 
past or the future, but the one thing 
that must remain in our Republic is 
tolerance. 
You see, Mr. Speaker, we have to 
adopt a standard; not a subjective one, 
but an objective one. But here is the 
truth: We already have had that stand-
ard. We have already adopted it. It is 
the objective standard that you are 
free to speak in the United States of 
America. And whether it is Twitter, 
Facebook, or Instagram or YouTube or 
Snapchat or TikTok, or The Wash-
ington Post or The Washington Times, 
whether you want to talk about The

New York Times or you want to talk 
about redstate.com, you want to talk 
about MSNBC or FOX News, Morning 
Joe or Sean Hannity, we must be free 
to speak at all times because the bat-
tlefield of ideas is the only thing that 
is going to propel our Republic for-
ward. It is the only thing that is going 
to allow young kids to grow and actu-
ally increase their intellect and to be 
able to transform our economy in ways 
that none of us in this Capitol today 
can even fathom. It is the very basis of 
what makes our Nation the greatest 
nation. It is what makes us unique. It 
is what allows us to be able to fight it 
out every day on this floor, verbally, of 
course, Mr. Speaker. 
My fellow Americans, we are all in 
this together. Mr. Speaker, we are in 
this together. We can’t cancel each 
other. We can’t move people out of the 
public square because we find their 
ideas even vile or distasteful. I may not 
like what you have to say, Mr. Speak-
er. We may disagree on votes on this 
very floor, but the one thing I will al-
ways respect, the one thing I will al-
ways defend is your ability to say it 
and your ability to vote that way. My 
only ask is that you do the same for 
people on my side of the political aisle. 
Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman for his profound remarks. I 
now yield to the gentlewoman from 
Wyoming (Ms. CHENEY), my friend and 
my neighbor to the north. 
Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to thank very much my friend, 
colleague, Mr. BUCK, for yielding me 
time this evening. 
I know the topic, Mr. Speaker, is can-
cel culture. I have some thoughts 
about that. But tonight I rise to dis-
cuss freedom and our constitutional 
duty to protect it. 
Mr. Speaker, I have been privileged 
to see firsthand how powerful and how 
fragile freedom is. Twenty-eight years 
ago, I stood outside a polling place, a 
schoolhouse in western Kenya. Soldiers 
had chased away people who were lined 
up to vote. A few hours later, they 
came streaming back in, risking fur-
ther attack, undaunted in their deter-
mination to exercise their right to 
vote. 
In 1992, I sat across the table from a 
young mayor in Nizhny Novgorod, Rus-
sia. I listened to him talk of his dream 
of liberating his nation from com-
munism. Years later, for his dedication 
to the cause of freedom, Boris Nemtsov 
was assassinated by Vladimir Putin’s 
thugs. 
In Warsaw in 1990, I listened to a 
young Polish woman tell me that her 
greatest fear was that people would 
forget; they would forget what it was 
like to live under Soviet domination, 
that they would forget the price of 
freedom. 
Three men—an immigrant who es-
caped Castro’s totalitarian regime, a 
young man who grew up behind the 
Iron Curtain and became his country’s 
minister of defense, and a dissident 
who spent years in the Soviet gulag— 
have all told me it was the miracle of 
America, captured in the words of 
President Ronald Reagan that inspired 
them. 
I have seen the power of faith and 
freedom. I listened to Pope John Paul 
II speak to thousands in Nairobi in 
1985, and 19 years later, I watched that 
same Pope take my father’s hands, 
look in his eyes, and say, ‘‘God bless 
America.’’ 
God has blessed America, Mr. Speak-
er, but our freedom only survives if we 
protect it, if we honor our oath, taken 
before God in this Chamber, to support 
and defend the Constitution, if we rec-
ognize threats to freedom when they 
arise. 
Today, we face a threat America has 
never seen before. A former President, 
who provoked a violent attack on this 
Capitol in an effort to steal the elec-
tion, has resumed his aggressive effort 
to convince Americans that the elec-
tion was stolen from him. He risks in-
citing further violence. 
Millions of Americans have been mis-
led by the former President. They have 
heard only his words but not the truth, 
as he continues to undermine our 
democratic process, sowing seeds of 
doubt about whether democracy really 
works at all. 
I am a conservative Republican, and 
the most conservative of conservative 
principles is reverence for the rule of 
law. The electoral college has voted. 
More than 60 State and Federal courts, 
including multiple judges the former 
President appointed, have rejected his 
claims. The Trump Department of Jus-
tice investigated the former Presi-
dent’s claims of widespread fraud and 
found no evidence to support them. The 
election is over. That is the rule of law. 
That is our constitutional process. 
Those who refuse to accept the rulings 
of our courts are at war with the Con-
stitution. 
Our duty is clear. Every one of us 
who has sworn the oath must act to 
prevent the unraveling of our democ-
racy. This is not about policy. This is 
not about partisanship. This is about 
our duty as Americans. Remaining si-
lent and ignoring the lie emboldens the 
liar. 
I will not participate in that. I will 
not sit back and watch in silence while 
others lead our party down a path that 
abandons the rule of law and joins the 
former President’s crusade to under-
mine our democracy. 
As the party of Reagan, Republicans 
have championed democracy, won the 
Cold War, and defeated the Soviet 
Communists. Today, America is on the 
cusp of another Cold War. This time 
with 
Communist 
China. 
Attacks 
against our democratic process and the 
rule of law empower our adversaries 
and feed Communist propaganda that 
American democracy is a failure. We 
must speak the truth. Our election was 
not stolen, and America has not failed. 
I received a message last week from a 
Gold Star father who said, ‘‘Standing 
up for the truth honors all who gave 
all.’’ We must all strive to be worthy of 
the sacrifice of those who have died for 
our freedom. They are the patriots 
Katharine Lee Bates described in the 
words of ‘‘America the Beautiful’’ when 
she wrote, Oh beautiful for heroes 
proved in liberating strife, who more 
than self, their country loved and 
mercy more than life. 
Ultimately, Mr. Speaker, this is at 
the heart of what our oath requires: 
That we love our country more, that 
we love her so much that we will stand 
above politics to defend her, that we 
will do everything in our power to pro-
tect our Constitution and our freedom 
that has been paid for by the blood of 
so many. We must love America so 
much that we will never yield in her 
defense. That is our duty. 
Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentlewoman, and I inform the Speaker 
that we have no further speakers. I 
yield back the balance of my time.

BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, ‘‘infra-
structure,’’ ‘‘court packing,’’ ‘‘crisis,’’ 
‘‘Jim Crow,’’ ‘‘bipartisan’’—all words 
that we recognize, all words with fixed, 
long-established 
meanings, 
and 
all 
words whose meanings are currently 
being twisted unrecognizably. 
In the brave new world of the Biden 
administration, the Democratic Con-
gress, the plain meaning of language is 
no longer so plain. 
Take the term ‘‘infrastructure.’’ Ask 
anybody what they think of when they 
think of infrastructure, and I can guar-
antee what they will tell you: roads, 
bridges, waterways, maybe airports. I 
can also tell you what they won’t think 
of: Medicaid expansion, support for Big 
Labor, free community college. 
Why? Because none of those things 
has ever been part of the definition of 
‘‘infrastructure,’’ 
until 
now. 
Now 
Democrats are claiming that infra-
structure is pretty much whatever 
they want it to be. 
One Democratic Senator tweeted: 
Paid leave is infrastructure. Childcare is 
infrastructure. Caregiving is infrastructure. 
Well, actually, no, they are not. 
Those are policy proposals—proposals 
that could be discussed, but they are 
not infrastructure. Saying something 
is infrastructure doesn’t make it so. 
And, unfortunately, Democrats’ re-
definition of infrastructure, as Orwell-
ian as it is, is actually less alarming 
than some of Democrats’ other at-
tempts at linguistic redefinition. 
Take court packing. Everyone who 
has ever sat through an American his-
tory class knows exactly what court 
packing refers to—expanding the num-
ber of Justices on the Supreme Court 
so that you can get the Supreme Court 
decisions that you want. 
President Franklin Delano Roosevelt 
proposed it in the 1930s, and it was de-
feated by a bipartisan majority of Sen-
ators. And most thought the idea had 
been consigned to the ash heap of his-
tory, until Democrats resurrected it 
during the Trump administration. 
Upset by the Court’s current makeup 
and worried that the Court might not 
rubberstamp Democratic policies, a 
growing number of Democrats are get-
ting behind the idea of court packing. 
But, of course, they are eager to es-
cape the negative connotations of the

May 11, 2021 
term. After all, President Roosevelt’s 
Court-packing attempt is not exactly 
regarded as a shining moment of his 
Presidency. And so in a move worthy of 
Orwell’s 
‘‘Nineteen 
Eighty-Four,’’ 
Democrats are asking us to accept the 
fantastical notion that Republicans 
packed the Court—indeed, packed the 
entire judiciary—and that Democrats 
are merely seeking to restore balance. 
Yes, in the Democrats’ brave new 
world, the President performing his 
constitutional duty to nominate judges 
and Justices, and a Senate duly con-
firming them, is now defined as a na-
kedly partisan power grab akin to 
President Roosevelt’s attempt to se-
cure a favorable outcome for his poli-
cies from the Supreme Court. 
I should say a Republican President 
fulfilling his constitutional duty and a 
Republican 
Senate 
confirming 
his 
nominees because we all know—we all 
know that if it were President Biden 
who had filled multiple seats on the 
Supreme Court and succeeded in hav-
ing a lot of judges confirmed, his ac-
tions would not be regarded as Court 
packing; they would be regarded cor-
rectly as business as usual. That is 
what we do around here. They would be 
regarded correctly as a President doing 
his job and performing his constitu-
tional duty. 
Then there is Jim Crow. Americans 
know what ‘‘Jim Crow’’ means. It re-
fers to the reprehensible period of seg-
regation, when Black Americans were 
forced to live as second-class citizens 
and denied the equal protection of the 
laws. 
‘‘Jim Crow’’ is one of the great stains 
on our country’s history, and it is a 
term that should not be used lightly, 
but that is exactly what Democrats are 
doing. 
They decided that it suits their pur-
poses to call to mind the history of this 
word, and so they have applied the 
term to an ordinary, mainstream elec-
tion reform bill in Georgia. 
In fact, the President went so far as 
to call the Georgia law ‘‘Jim Crow on 
steroids,’’ as if it would not only bring 
us back to the era of segregation but 
return us to something even worse. 
And all this for an election law that 
is squarely in the mainstream when it 
comes to State election laws and in 
some ways is more permissive than 
election laws in presumably utopian 
Democratic-led States like New York. 
I could go on. 
There are Democrats’ attempts to re-
define ‘‘bipartisan’’ from something 
that is supported by both parties in 
Congress to something that is maybe— 
maybe—supported by some Republican 
voters in some poll, no matter how du-
bious its reliability. 
Or there is the White House’s con-
torted refusal to call the situation at 
our southern border a crisis, as if by re-
fusing to use the word they could 
somehow change the reality of the sit-
uation. 
But let me ask a question. Why is the 
plain meaning of language under as-
sault by the Democratic Party? Why 
are Democrats dramatically redefining 
ordinary words and concepts? 
Well, maybe it is because reality 
isn’t so pretty. Take court packing. 
The truth is that Democrats are afraid 
that the current Supreme Court is not 
going to rule the way Democrats want 
in cases they care about. So they want 
to expand the Supreme Court and let 
President Biden nominate new Justices 
so they can guarantee the outcomes 
that they want. 
But saying that doesn’t sound so 
great. In fact, it sounds more auto-
cratic than democratic. So Democrats 
are attempting to disguise the real rea-
son behind their partisan court-pack-
ing plan by applying the word ‘‘Court 
packing’’ not to their own attempts to 
pack the Court but to the ordinary 
work of the President and the Con-
gress. 
Or take infrastructure. Pretty much 
everybody supports infrastructure. You 
would be hard-pressed to find anyone 
who doesn’t thinking the government 
should maintain our roads and bridges. 
It would be a lot easier, on the other 
hand, to find people who think that 
maybe government shouldn’t be in the 
business of substantially increasing 
spending or expanding into new areas 
of Americans’ lives. 
So Democrats have chosen to dis-
guise their plans for massive govern-
ment spending and government expan-
sion under the heading of ‘‘infrastruc-
ture.’’ After all, everybody supports in-
frastructure. 
So if they can sell their plans for 
government expansion as infrastruc-
ture, then they might be able to imple-
ment a lot of proposals that otherwise 
might not make it through Congress. 
Or take Jim Crow. With H.R. 1 and S. 
1, Democrats are pushing to pass an 
election law that would federalize elec-
tions, inject a massive dose of partisan-
ship into our election system, and give 
Democrats what they hope will be a 
permanent 
advantage 
in 
elections 
going forward, but obviously they can’t 
say that. They can’t suggest that we 
pass H.R. 1 to improve Democrats’ elec-
toral chances so they have had to find 
another reason to push Americans to 
pass this bill. 
And so they have manufactured a cri-
sis—States are passing dangerous elec-
tion laws that harken back to Jim 
Crow, and we need the Democrats’ elec-
tion bill to save the day. 
Sometimes I wonder when the Presi-
dent is bashing the Georgia election 
law if he remembers that the legisla-
ture that passed that law was elected 
by the same voters who gave him the 
victory in Georgia and sent two Demo-
crats to the U.S. Senate. Does he really 
want to call those voters racist? 
Ultimately, Democrats’ assault on 
language is about power. Change the 
language, and you can change the out-
come and secure your political control. 
It is no coincidence that oppressive 
regimes have cracked down on speech 
and redefined it to suit their purposes 
or that they manufacture crises to 
keep the people in need of government. 
The problem for Democrats is that 
there is no mandate for Democrats’ far- 
left agenda. Democrats’ radical social-
ist candidates couldn’t even make it 
through the Democratic primary, let 
alone the general election. President 
Biden won the Democrat primary and 
the election in large part because he 
campaigned, perhaps disingenuously, 
as a moderate. And as for Congress, 
Democrats lost seats in the House and 
have a paper-thin majority in both 
Chambers. If there was any mandate to 
be gathered from November, it was a 
mandate for moderation. 
But Democrats aren’t interested in 
moderation. They are increasingly en-
thralled with the far-left wing of their 
party, and they have a radical agenda 
to push and possibly a very limited 
window to push it. And since there is 
no mandate for that agenda, they have 
to create one. 
That is why you see Democrats rede-
fining the very plain meaning of com-
mon words. Say that you don’t like the 
makeup of the Supreme Court, and 
most Americans would say: Tough, 
that is the way the ball bounces some-
times in our democracy. 
Claim that Republicans engaged in 
court packing, on the other hand, and 
all of a sudden Democrats’ radically 
partisan Supreme Court power grab 
seems a lot more acceptable. 
I get Democrats’ passion for their 
politics. I feel pretty strongly about 
my political principles. But their ma-
nipulation of language to advance their 
politics is deeply disturbing. Instead of 
trying to pursue a radical agenda 
cloaked in misleading language, I sug-
gest Democrats turn their efforts to bi-
partisan cooperation. As the November 
election made clear, that is what the 
American people are looking for. 
I yield the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority whip is recognized. 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I lis-
tened carefully to the statement by my 
friend from South Dakota about rad-
ical 
socialism—radical 
socialism. 
I 
think what he is categorizing as rad-
ical socialism is the suggestion by the 
President of the United States, Joe 
Biden, that we should really care about 
providing 
safe, 
affordable, 
quality 
daycare for women who want to go to 
work. Radical socialism? 
I am concerned about some trends 
that we are noting. The census reports 
that the birth rate in America is going 
down. Fewer children are being born in 
this country. I ask a basic question: 
What does that say about our country 
and about our future? 
What it tells me is that raising a 
family for many is a struggle. They 
have to work to bring money home, 
and they want to have the peace of 
mind when they go to work that their 
kids are safe. That is not a radical sug-
gestion, and the solution isn’t social-
ism.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2425 
May 11, 2021 
The solution is just caring. What do 
you care about? President Joe Biden 
does, and he has suggested, as part of 
his plan for American families, that 
the wage earners don’t have more than 
7 or 8 percent of their income dedicated 
to daycare. I don’t think that is rad-
ical. I think it is realistic. It says they 
have some skin in the game, some in-
vestment on their own part, but they 
have affordable daycare affordable to 
them. 
Republicans say they are all about 
infrastructure. We want to build the 
best highways—I do, too—the best 
bridges and best airports and such so 
that Americans in business can move 
from one place to another. Sign me up. 
That is basic infrastructure, and I 
agree with it. But, if I have the best 
highway from my home to a good place 
of employment and still can’t find af-
fordable daycare, many people—espe-
cially women who are out of work— 
can’t buy into this infrastructure in-
vestment. That is not radical. Social-
ism, to give a mother a helping hand so 
that she has a safe place to leave her 
child during the course of the day? 
And how about the other suggestions 
of President Biden? Is it radical social-
ism to suggest that we have available 
for all families in America—all fami-
lies in America—2 additional years of 
training and education for children be-
fore kindergarten? I don’t think it is 
radical. 
I have the best little granddaughter 
in the world, who is going to be 2 years 
old in just a few days. She started her 
school experience already. We are 
proud of her, and I think it is going to 
help her to socialize with other chil-
dren, learn in a classroom atmosphere, 
and I am glad she is there. I wish every 
family in the city of Chicago and the 
State of Illinois had the same option. 
But many cannot. 
President Biden thinks that is a good 
idea. So do I. 
Who would characterize that as rad-
ical socialism—2 additional years for 
children before kindergarten? 
Here is another thing he suggests. 
Let’s have 2 additional years after the 
12th grade. The President said 2 years 
of community college. Is that radical 
socialism, to expand the offering of 
education an additional 2 years? If you 
visit community colleges and see what 
is going on there, you realize that 
many young people are making really 
life-changing decisions about their ca-
reers and their future. 
Radical socialism? I don’t think so. I 
think most families would say it is just 
common sense. It is not radical, and it 
is not socialism if government gives a 
helping hand. We have done that since 
the 1950s when it came to college loans. 
We do that today when it comes to 
helping school districts across this Na-
tion. Not radical, not socialism, just 
common sense commitment to the 
American family. 
So they can make the speeches all 
they wish, but that is the reality. 
There has been an awful lot of talk 
on the Senate floor about infrastruc-
ture, as I mentioned. Many of my col-
leagues across the aisle think it is just 
roads and bridges and nothing more. I 
think that is a priority, but I don’t 
think that is the entire challenge. 
When we consider infrastructure, we 
ought to look to the future. We should 
ask important challenging questions. 
What kind of infrastructure invest-
ment will help us for decades to come? 
What does the next-generation econ-
omy in America need? What tools will 
our children and grandchildren need to 
lead healthy, productive, satisfying 
lives? 
Tough 
questions, 
but 
President 
Biden’s American Jobs Plan and the 
American Families Plan face these 
questions honestly. Broadband, edu-
cation, clean energy, paid family leave, 
electric vehicles, daycare—the Presi-
dent’s plan envisions all of these things 
and more as the future of infrastruc-
ture. 
What does that future look like in 
practice? I had a visit last week which 
was amazing. I wanted to share just a 
little bit of my visit with you. Last 
Thursday, I visited a town in central 
Illinois called Normal. During my 
visit, I toured a new manufacturing 
plant, the Rivian plant, where produc-
tion will begin in a few weeks on 
brand-new electric trucks, SUVs, and 
delivery vans. This is not a small-scale 
operation. Amazon has already placed 
an order for 100,000 emission-free deliv-
ery vans—100,000. 
Not long ago, 6 years ago, in fact, an-
other car company, Mitsubishi, occu-
pied a plant where Rivian is today, and 
they left town, putting 1,000 people out 
of work in the process. We were pretty 
down on our luck at that point and de-
spondent about the future of that facil-
ity. It sits out by Interstate 55. 
Guess what happened. A year later, 
thanks to the leadership of many peo-
ple, including my friend the mayor of 
Normal, IL, Chris Koos, who found a 
buyer for the old Mitsubishi plant. By 
the end of 2021, that plant will be back 
in business full scale with more than 
2,500 employees producing the next 
generation of electric vehicles. 
It is a manufacturing jobs boom in 
Normal, IL. I couldn’t be more excited 
or happy for the people who live near-
by. It was made possible by leaders and 
investors who refused to hang on to the 
past. Here was this young CEO who de-
cided that electric vehicles were our 
future. He came up with that idea 5 
years ago, and he has created a large 
class of believers. 
Folks in this town will tell you infra-
structure is about more than roads and 
bridges. For them it is about taking 
transportation in America to the next 
generation, and the President of the 
United States, Joe Biden, understands 
that. 
His American Jobs Plan includes a 
$174 billion investment in electric vehi-
cles and charging stations. Is this some 
big radical socialist government idea? 
No. Listen to the major producers of 
automobiles in America today talk 
about where they think the market is 
headed. Every one of them is talking 
about electric vehicles. The funds that 
President Biden proposes would sup-
port the growth of companies like 
Rivian and accelerate the installation 
of charging stations across the coun-
try. 
I 
went 
from 
Normal, 
IL, 
to 
a 
multimodal 
facility—Amtrak, 
cars, 
buses. They all gathered downtown in a 
building which I helped to build. And 
we went to several levels of parking in 
this facility. At each level there were 
electric charging stations. That is the 
future. 
Imagine the future where you drive 
from Normal to Chicago or St. Louis, 
or anywhere in this country, without 
burning a drop of gasoline? This is the 
new normal, a place where hard-work-
ing Illinoisans produce next-generation 
vehicles, and companies come together 
with local leaders to move us toward a 
cleaner, stronger economy. 
Normal, IL, is stepping up to the 
plate to ensure the United States con-
tinues to lead in the global economy, 
even as competitors like China ramp 
up their own electric vehicle produc-
tion. 
Make no mistake. If we follow the 
lead of the Republicans and step away 
from investing in electric vehicles and 
the training and the other elements 
that are necessary to develop it, the 
Chinese are not going to drop out of 
the competition. They are going to un-
fortunately be very successful at our 
expense. 
Normal isn’t going it alone. All 
around my State, I am proud to say, we 
see efforts to create this electric vehi-
cle 
future. 
Last 
week, 
Governor 
Pritzker and Lion Electric announced 
plans to open a new electric vehicle 
manufacturing plant in Joliet, IL—a 
$70 million investment that will create 
700 new jobs. 
Beginning in 2022, the plant will 
produce 20,000 zero-emission medium- 
and heavy-duty vehicles. That means 
electric school buses and trucks built 
right in my home State. 
A Netherlands-based manufacturer of 
charging stations, EVBox, set up its 
U.S. headquarters in Libertyville, IL, 
this past summer. They have plans to 
produce more than 200 fast-charging 
stations a week. 
The electric transportation industry 
and its surrounding infrastructure al-
ready employs more than 5,000 people 
in my State of Illinois. One recent re-
port projects that electric transpor-
tation employment in Illinois will 
grow to more than 9,500 workers by 
2024. That is an 83-percent jump in 3 
years. 
Illinois is poised to have a nationally 
important role in the development of 
electric vehicles. Why are the compa-
nies coming to Illinois? I have a the-
ory. Illinois has been setting the stage 
for this electric vehicle revolution for 
years.

labs have pushed the boundaries of ve-
hicle and battery technology for dec-
ades, always looking ahead. Today, 
their pioneering work will produce bat-
teries that will last longer, charge fast-
er, and can be recycled safely. 
Look at our universities. The Univer-
sity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign 
produces some of the best engineers in 
America. In Normal, you can find Illi-
nois State University and Heartland 
Community College, which produce a 
direct pipeline of new talent to compa-
nies like Rivian. 
Illinois recognizes that science and 
research are the backbone for the econ-
omy. Our labs and universities prove it 
time and again. This research drives 
the electric vehicle industry forward, 
and companies want to be right in the 
middle of that environment. 
Beyond batteries, Illinois leads the 
way in research in clean energy tech-
nology, quantum computing, artificial 
intelligence, and many of the other 
technologies we need to be part of the 
economy of the 21st century. 
President Biden understands that we 
need research, too. His American Jobs 
Plan proposes $180 billion in invest-
ment in research and development for 
things just like electric vehicles. We 
have the opportunity to not only elec-
trify but to supercharge our future. 
Federal funding that matches the 
President’s bold plan could transform 
more towns like Normal or Joliet into 
powerhouses of American manufac-
turing. 
I listen to Republicans on the other 
side say: We shouldn’t spend so much. 
We shouldn’t spend it on so many 
things that might affect our future. 
Take it easy. Take it slow. Wait and 
see what happens. 
I couldn’t disagree more. 
The Republican plan is a solid strat-
egy for second place in the world. I 
don’t want to be part of an effort to 
bring the United States second in any 
competition in the world. We may not 
always be first, but we should always 
strive to be first. Stepping away from 
President Biden’s plan for manufac-
turing and jobs and families is, unfor-
tunately, an easily predicted outcome. 
We will not be able to succeed and cre-
ate the jobs of the future. 
I will continue to support robust, 
sustained funding for electric vehicle 
infrastructure and innovation. I hope 
that both parties will. I hope my col-
leagues will join me in thinking in a 
big way about the future of America 
when it comes to the economy and in-
frastructure. I have seen the future it 
can create in Normal, IL, last week, 
and it is a bright one. 
LIABILITY IMMUNITY 
Mr. President, the American Rescue 
Plan was the Biden threshold initiative 
to bring to America what it des-
perately needed after this President 
was sworn in on January 20 of this 
year. Unfortunately, we didn’t have a 
single Republican to support it—not 
one. Not a single Republican Senator 
or House Member would support the 
American Rescue Plan of President Joe 
Biden. 
What did the plan do? Well, it bought 
more vaccines. It invested dramati-
cally in the distribution of these vac-
cines across America. It turned around 
and kept the President Trump promise 
of the cash payment of $1,400 for each 
individual. It extended unemployment 
benefits so that people could continue 
to keep food on the table and pay their 
rent and mortgage payments until they 
found good jobs. And it basically said 
to small businesses: We are not giving 
up on you. We are going to help you, 
whether it is the restaurant industry 
or other businesses. We want you to be 
back in business. We invested that 
money as a nation, and it was a critical 
time to do it. 
President Biden believed, and all the 
Democrats supported him in this belief, 
that we should move forward now or 
run the risk of falling behind in devel-
oping our economy. The American Res-
cue Plan was successful. It has given 
assistance across the board to families 
and businesses and delivered resources 
where they were needed the most. It 
really matched the crisis with an ini-
tiative that was significant in scope. 
But if my Republican colleagues had 
had their way, the American Rescue 
Plan would have looked a lot more like 
a giant corporate giveaway because all 
throughout 2020, they were clamoring 
for massive handouts to big businesses 
in the form of liability immunity. I am 
glad that my colleague from Texas is 
on the floor because it is an issue that 
he has been interested in and has spo-
ken on the floor many times. 
All last year, we heard from the 
other side of the aisle that Congress 
needed to give sweeping Federal liabil-
ity immunity to corporations when it 
came to their conduct during the pan-
demic. Well, we heard some dire warn-
ings about the number of lawsuits that 
were going to be filed because of 
COVID–19. It was called a tsunami of 
lawsuits by the Republican leader of 
the Senate. 
One year ago today, on May 11, 2020, 
Senator MCCONNELL spoke on the Sen-
ate floor and raised fears of ‘‘a second 
job-killing epidemic of frivolous law-
suits.’’ The next day, he came to the 
floor and kept the attack on, and he 
warned of ‘‘a tidal wave of medical 
malpractice lawsuits.’’ That is from 
Senator MCCONNELL on the floor of the 
Senate. 
Senate Republicans rallied behind a 
bill introduced by Senator CORNYN that 
would 
give 
corporations 
immunity 
from accountability both in court and 
from regulators for conduct that could 
be considered negligent under current 
law. I argued against these corporate 
immunity proposals. Granting corpora-
tions legal immunity gives them an in-
centive to cut costs and cut corners 
when it comes to the health and safety 
of workers and consumers. It gives a 
pass to unreasonable and irresponsible 
behavior and puts people at greater 
risk. I don’t think that is the right ap-
proach. 
As I kept pointing out to my Repub-
lican colleagues, they couldn’t show 
statistically why this was necessary. 
The data never justified their pro-
posals. That tsunami of lawsuits never 
arrived. We are now over a year into 
this pandemic. Over 32 million Ameri-
cans, sadly, have been infected, and 
nearly 600,000, tragically, have died. So 
how many lawsuits have been gen-
erated by all these terrible outcomes? 
Well, there is a law firm, Hunton An-
drews Kurth, that has tracked all of 
the lawsuits filed in the United States 
over COVID–19. I checked the totals 
over the weekend. You may be asking: 
Well, how many medical malpractice 
cases have been filed in the United 
States over the last year related to 
COVID–19? The number: 20—20. And 
how many cases alleging personal in-
jury from exposure to COVID–19 in a 
public place have been filed? The num-
ber is 60 in the entire United States. 
That is not a flood. That is not a tsu-
nami. It is a trickle. 
In fact, the main litigation we have 
seen involving COVID has been one 
business suing another business. For 
example, there are 1,831 lawsuits in-
volving insurance disputes, 640 lawsuits 
involving business closures and stay- 
at-home orders, and 772 lawsuits in-
volving contract disputes. It was not 
what was predicted on the floor over 
and over again by Senators from the 
other side of the aisle. 
I am always troubled how the Repub-
lican immunity proposals try to block 
infected workers and families from 
suing corporations for negligence, but 
let corporations continue to file their 
own COVID-related lawsuits by the 
hundreds whenever they feel like it. 
How is that fair? 
I believe Americans deserve a chance 
to have a day in court when these fami-
lies believe their loved ones have been 
harmed due to negligence or mis-
conduct. For example, if a senior cit-
izen dies because a nursing home re-
fused to share what it knew about the 
virus’s spread, I believe the families of 
those victims deserve a chance to go to 
court and seek justice. 
Those types of cases are traditionally 
governed by State law. States can and 
do adjust their State liability law to fit 
the circumstances. As it turns out, 
more 
than 
half 
the 
States 
have 
changed their liability laws, either 
through legislation or executive ac-
tion, in response to COVID. In my 
view, some of the States went too far, 
to be honest with you, in shielding neg-
ligent behavior by corporations, but 
that was their call to make since this 
is a State law issue. 
I find it surprising that my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
want Congress to step in and impose 
sweeping Federal corporate immunity 
that would override the laws of all 50 
States. There was no justification for 
doing so, and I am glad we didn’t. It 
would have made us less safe. 
I hope the next time we hear calls for 
sweeping Federal liability immunity

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2427 
May 11, 2021 
during a national crisis, we remember 
this experience and how the dire pre-
dictions of tsunamis and floods of law-
suits never came to pass. Let’s con-
tinue to address this virus with tar-
geted relief much like the American 
Rescue Plan did. And as we emerge 
from the pandemic, let’s invest in the 
areas that actually need support. That 
is why Democrats support President 
Biden again with the American Jobs 
Plan and the American Families Plan, 
targeting investments that help the 
American economy. 
Like 
President 
Biden 
said 
last 
month, we have got to build our econ-
omy from the bottom up and the mid-
dle out and not from the top down. 
Giant corporations don’t need another 
handout like immunity. They already 
have all the help they need. I hope we 
can work together to deliver real relief 
to the American people. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
PADILLA). The Senator from Texas. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President I ask 
unanimous consent to be able to com-
plete my remarks before the vote oc-
curs. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, listen-
ing to my friend, the Democratic whip, 
reminds me that there is one type of 
business that my Democratic friends 
always support, and that is the lawsuit 
business. As he pointed out, about half 
of the States have taken steps to pro-
tect their citizens from frivolous liti-
gation and other litigation that would 
arise out of their good-faith following 
of the guidelines laid down by the CDC, 
the Centers for Disease Control. That 
is what we proposed here in the Senate. 
And my friend’s, the Senator from Il-
linois’s view did prevail because I 
found out that there is one—the most 
powerful lobby here in Washington, DC, 
is the trial bar, and, unfortunately, it 
is not just big corporations. I am sure 
big companies can take care of them-
selves. They have got lawyers; they 
have got compliance officers; and they 
have got people who can help them fig-
ure out how to deal with the pandemic. 
It is the mom-and-pop businesses, the 
music venues, the houses of worship, 
the schools, and the universities—those 
were the ones that were reluctant to 
reopen, even complying with the CDC 
guidelines, because they were afraid of 
being sued into oblivion. 
So my colleague’s views did prevail 
here in the Senate, unfortunately, but, 
thankfully, States like mine—Texas is 
currently in legislative session taking 
appropriate steps to avoid this sort of 
frivolous litigation, which will be like 
a wet blanket on our economic recov-
ery and on job creation. Again, this is 
not a get-out-of-jail free card. These 
are citizens—American citizens—trying 
to do the best they can under very dif-
ficult circumstances who have, in good 
faith, complied with the Centers for 
Disease Control guidelines. 
I would like to rewind just a little bit 
to 2019, before the pandemic hit, and 
recall that the American people were 
reaping the benefits of one of the 
strongest economies in American his-
tory. The driving force behind that eco-
nomic boom, I think, was, in signifi-
cant part, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, 
which we passed in 2017, which sought 
to help American families and the 
economy thrive by keeping more of 
what they earned and turning over less 
to the Federal Government. In my 
opinion, there is no question that it 
was one of the biggest contributors to 
our booming economy. 
Our national unemployment rate had 
reached a 50-year low, and we saw 
record unemployment rates for His-
panics, African Americans, and Asian 
Americans. 
Unemployment 
among 
women fell to the lowest rate since the 
early 1950s. That was prepandemic. 
The benefits did not stop there, 
though. Wages were on the rise. The 
poverty rate hit an alltime low, and 
millions of new jobs were being added 
to our economy. Families were bring-
ing home more of their hard-earned 
paychecks, and median household in-
come reached a record high. 
But then the pandemic hit, as we 
know, and things took a very sharp 
turn downward. Businesses closed their 
doors; workers lost their jobs; and the 
unemployment rate skyrocketed from 
3.5 percent to nearly 15 percent in 
April. 
Fortunately, this dark economic pic-
ture is gradually brightening. Thanks 
to the investment we have made in 
therapeutics and vaccines in a histori-
cally short period of time, thanks to 
the ingenuity and perseverance of 
workers and business owners, combined 
with the assistance that Congress has 
given them and, like I said, advance-
ments in modern science, we have 
made steady progress. 
The unemployment rate has steadily 
declined over the last year, reaching 6 
percent in March, but the new data 
from April is a cause for concern. The 
unemployment rate increased by a 
tenth of a percentage point. It didn’t 
go down. It went up. It is a bump that 
wouldn’t have raised any red flags be-
fore the pandemic. But this single data 
point is not the only indication of how 
our economy is faring. Last month, 
only 266,000 new jobs were added to the 
economy. That is a quarter—25 per-
cent—of what economists had pre-
dicted. Now, again, 266,000 new jobs 
would not have been a bad jobs report 
before the pandemic because we were 
literally at nearly full employment, 
but we aren’t currently in a build 
mode. We are currently digging our 
way out of a hole, a recession, to be 
specific. 
We are still missing 8 million jobs 
that existed prior to the pandemic. I 
don’t think anyone expected all those 
jobs to come back overnight, but we 
did expect to be faring far better than 
this. As I said, the economists said this 
is a quarter of what they anticipated. 
Well, this is the first full month of 
data since our Democratic colleagues 
passed their $2 trillion so-called rescue 
plan on top of the trillions of dollars 
that we spent in 2020. If things con-
tinue to go the rate we are on now, we 
are in for an extremely long recovery. 
In other words, sometimes policies that 
emanate from Washington actually 
make the recovery harder, not easier. 
Unfortunately, the administration is 
doing more to slow down the recovery 
than they are to solve it. Last year, 
Republicans and Democrats worked to-
gether to provide unprecedented assist-
ance to workers and their families hit 
by this economic downturn. Bolstered 
unemployment benefits were intended 
to provide laid-off workers with the 
money they needed to support their 
families until they could return to 
work, and over the last year, many of 
those workers have, fortunately, got-
ten back on the job. 
These benefits were a lifeline for mil-
lions of families and, today, there are 
still workers unable to find a new job. 
But there are, unfortunately, also peo-
ple abusing the system, the generosity 
of the American people, the American 
taxpayer. The partisan relief bill our 
Democratic colleagues pushed through 
earlier 
this 
year 
extended 
supple-
mental 
unemployment 
benefits 
through September of this year, far be-
yond the amount of time anyone would 
have expected that those benefits, the 
supplemental benefits to the State un-
employment benefits, would be needed. 
Even as vaccinations were on the 
rise, our Democratic colleagues in-
sisted on extending these benefits 
through September, and many of us 
predicted the outcome. Last spring, 
workers couldn’t find jobs. Now, busi-
nesses can’t find workers. 
Between 
bolstered 
unemployment 
benefits and a steady stream of stim-
ulus checks, many people who lost 
their jobs can’t be convinced to return 
to the workforce. One restaurant owner 
in Texas said he had had plenty of ap-
plicants; people just won’t show up for 
the interviews. One day, when he had 
scheduled eight interviews for poten-
tial employment, only one applicant 
showed up. The next day, the same 
thing happened—five scheduled inter-
views; one person showed up. He said: 
It makes you wonder, are they just fill-
ing these applications out to collect 
unemployment? Because, of course, 
most unemployment benefits require 
you to apply for work and accept it if 
it is offered. But apparently here, 
whatever the incentives are, they are 
simply persuading some people to fill 
out applications but then not to seri-
ously pursue work. 
In a year’s time, we have gone from 
the strongest economy in a generation 
to the government paying people to 
stay home. This reminds me of the dis-
cussion we had a couple of years ago 
when 
the 
Green 
New 
Deal 
was 
launched. An overview of the bill was 
listed on the website of one of its au-
thors and said that the government 
would foot the bill for any person who 
is ‘‘unable or unwilling to work.’’ ‘‘Un-
able or unwilling to work,’’ that the

government would foot the bill—that 
was the proposal initially when the 
Green New Deal was rolled out. ‘‘Un-
willing to work.’’ Don’t like the job? 
Don’t want to get out of bed in the 
morning? Don’t worry; hard-working 
Americans who are getting up and 
going to work every day will foot the 
bill so you can stay home. I am sure it 
comes as no surprise that this received 
a great deal of criticism and even ridi-
cule 2 years ago. 
Unfortunately for the taxpayers who 
actually do get up every morning and 
go to work, we are seeing this play out 
in real time. Folks who lost their jobs 
and who are now able but unwilling to 
return to work can continue to reap 
the bolstered unemployment benefits 
that our Democratic colleagues pro-
vided for them through September. 
Another restaurant owner in Texas 
said that between the stimulus checks 
and the enhanced unemployment bene-
fits, it is tough to find people who want 
to work at all. He said: 
I believe our biggest competition in the job 
market is the government. 
This isn’t an isolated problem. In 
Texas, the average unemployment ben-
efits equal more than $36,000 a year. In 
Washington State, you can receive 
$39,000 a year in unemployment bene-
fits. In Massachusetts, it is $41,000 a 
year. 
A few Governors have said their 
States will stop offering the bolstered 
benefits because it is a disincentive for 
workers to get back on the job. If you 
are able to stay home and bring in as 
much money or maybe even more than 
you were earning while you were actu-
ally working, what is the incentive to 
go back? 
This poor job report isn’t a surprise 
to anyone who has spoken to employ-
ers, as I have, who have said repeatedly 
that no one wants to return to work 
when they can get paid to stay home. 
Another factor that has likely con-
tributed to the slow recovery is the 
slow reopening of schools. Despite the 
fact that in many States, teachers are 
among the first individuals to get vac-
cinated, the return to classrooms has 
been incredibly slow. Less than half 
the school districts throughout the 
country are operating fully in person. 
The nearly $2 trillion that our Demo-
cratic colleagues rammed through Con-
gress in March did little to get us back 
on track. It sent more than $120 billion 
more to K–12 schools that were already 
flush with cash but attached no re-
quirement that the money be used to 
actually get children back in the class-
room, where we know they will learn 
best. 
If at least one parent has to be home 
with their children for even part of the 
week, that makes it incredibly difficult 
for them to return to work. For single 
parents, it is virtually impossible. 
If we are ever going to get our econ-
omy back on track, we need to get our 
children safely back in school. We need 
to get people who are able but who are 
currently unwilling to work to get 
back on the job. And we need to supply 
the businesses that managed to survive 
this past year with a reliable work-
force. 
Right now, the biggest hurdle to our 
economic recovery is the government 
itself. That needs to change. If you 
asked the President or a number of our 
Democratic colleagues in the Senate, 
they would say the solution is easy— 
the American Jobs Plan. Let’s spend 
more money. 
This proposal is part social safety 
net, part infrastructure, and part tax-
payer-funded spending spree. It is real-
ly designed to transform America into 
Europe—a social safety net economy. 
It spends more than $2.5 trillion on 
things like electric vehicle chargers 
and home healthcare, which we are 
happy to debate in any other context, 
but what we really need is a jobs plan 
to get America back to work, not an-
other Trojan horse like we saw passed 
earlier this year and is currently being 
advertised, for example, under the 
guise of being an infrastructure bill. 
In order to finance this plan, along 
with the President’s American Fami-
lies Plan, our Democratic colleagues 
want to enact the largest tax hike in a 
generation. So contrary to what we did 
in 2017 by lowering the tax burden and 
giving people more of what they 
earned—and we have seen those tre-
mendous economic results as a con-
sequence—our Democratic colleagues 
want to, while we are still at 6 percent 
unemployment, raise taxes, which will 
further retard the economic recovery. 
So to recap, the plan for economic re-
covery is to make it more expensive for 
businesses to operate and nearly im-
possible for them to find workers. No 
wonder the economy isn’t rebounding 
like we had hoped. That is what hap-
pened to the million jobs that were 
projected to be in the latest jobs re-
port, but it was unfortunately a dis-
appointing 25 percent of those million 
jobs. 
So instead of building on the suc-
cesses of 2017 and the prepandemic 
economy, the administration wants to 
double down on the old, tired belief 
that America can tax and spend and 
regulate itself to prosperity. We don’t 
need dramatic tax increases for sweep-
ing social safety programs to get our 
economy back on track. We need to 
replicate the same factors that led to 
our banner prepandemic recovery. We 
need to get our children safely back in 
the classroom so their parents can re-
turn to the workforce. We need to stop 
paying workers to sit on the sidelines, 
and we need to give the job creators 
the ability to drive our economy for-
ward. 
Democrats don’t have an ‘‘American 
Something Plan’’ for every problem. 
Sometimes all the government has to 
do is get out of the way.

NATIONAL POLICE WEEK 
Mr. TILLIS. Madam President, this 
week is National Police Week, and I 
rise today in honor of the service and 
sacrifice of law enforcement across this 
country. 
In North Carolina, we lost 10 law en-
forcement officers in 2020, and we trag-
ically lost 6, so far, in 2021. Some of 
these officers were victims of COVID, 
others were involved in car accidents, 
and some made the ultimate sacrifice 
being killed in the line of duty. 
Recent tragedies in Cabarrus, Gas-
ton, Henderson, and Watauga Counties 
in my State of North Carolina have 
been met with an outpouring of grati-
tude, appreciation, and love from the 
residents for the communities they 
help keep safe. 
Last September, we lost Deputy 
Ryan Hendrix of the Henderson County 
Sheriff’s Office after he was shot and 
killed responding to a break-in. Officer 
Hendrix was only 35 years old. He had 
two young children and was set to be 
married to his fiance the following 
month. 
Last December, Tyler Herndon of the 
Mount Holly Police Department was 
tragically killed in the line of duty just 
days before his 26th birthday. 
In December, Officer Jason Shuping 
of the Concord Police Department was 
shot and killed while responding to an 
attempted carjacking. Officer Shuping 
was only 25 years old. He left behind 
his wife Haylee, a high school sweet-
heart whom he had been in love with 
for years and married for 2. Last week, 
I had the honor—the sad honor—of 
joining Cabarrus County to commemo-
rate Law Enforcement Day and to 
honor Officer Shuping’s service. 
Most recently, on April 28, North 
Carolina tragically lost two more law 
enforcement officers: Sergeant Chris 
Ward and K–9 Deputy Logan Fox of the 
Watauga County Sheriff’s Office. They 
were conducting a welfare check that 
turned into a deadly, hours-long stand-
off. Sergeant Ward was only 36 years 
old. He was an 8-year law enforcement 
veteran. He leaves behind a wife, who 
was also his high school sweetheart, 
and two daughters. Deputy Fox was 
only 25 years old. He was a 2-year vet-
eran of the Watauga Sheriff’s Office, 
and he was a partner with a K–9 named 
‘‘Raven.’’ He was engaged and soon to 
be married. 
The people of North Carolina came 
together to pay their final respects to 
these brave officers just a little over a 
week ago. During the procession from 
Winston-Salem back to Boone, many 
stood on the side of the road to salute 
the officers and proudly wave Amer-
ican flags. 
I told the audience and the police of-
ficers present last week in Concord 
that you need to know that the major-
ity of Americans still greatly appre-
ciate your service to law enforcement. 
They recognize the vast majority of 
men and women serving in law enforce-
ment are good people who put their 
uniforms on every day, willing to sac-
rifice their own lives to protect us. 
Being a law enforcement officer is 
not an easy job, and it is certainly not 
safe. We saw that on Capitol Hill on 
January 6. But being an officer is be-
coming harder and harder as they han-
dle more stress, more pressure, and 
more responsibilities than ever before. 
If their jobs weren’t hard enough al-
ready, there are some people, including 
people on Capitol Hill, who are actively 
demonizing all of law enforcement, ar-
guing that they are unworthy of tax-
payer funding and the people’s respect. 
It is no wonder why many law en-
forcement officers across the Nation— 
officers across the Nation—have low 
morale. We are seeing the real-world 
consequences: a decrease in applica-
tions to go in academies, early exits, 
and more retirements. It has gotten to 
dangerous 
levels 
in 
several 
cities 
across the country. 
The demonization of law enforcement 
will have lasting consequences, and it 
will ultimately make all of us less safe. 
This is why Congress must do every-
thing we can to support law enforce-
ment and to stop efforts to demean and 
demonize them. The best way to do 
that is to recognize law enforcement 
for their remarkable service and the 
dangers they face to protect us. 
That is why I recently reintroduced 
the Protect and Serve Act. This legis-
lation would make it a Federal crime 
to intentionally assault a law enforce-
ment officer. It ensures prosecutors 
have every tool available to punish 
those who attack and target them. In 
2018, the Protect and Serve Act passed 
the House by a vote of 382 to 35, and it 
had the support of every current Mem-
ber of the House Democratic leader-
ship. 
If President Biden is serious about 
unity, I can think of no better bill for 
him to support. This week, I will be re-
introducing another important piece of 
legislation, the Probation Officer Pro-
tection Act. This bill would give proba-
tion officers the arrest authority they 
need to fully enforce the law and pro-
tect public safety. I hope my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle will 
cosponsor this bill and work with me 
to send it to the President’s desk, 
along with the Protect and Serve Act. 
I know every Member of Congress has 
seen the heroism of law enforcement 
firsthand. I did too. We all saw it on 
January 6, when Capitol Police and DC 
Police risked their lives to ensure our 
safety. We ultimately lost two Capitol 
Police officers, and we lost another 
since then. More than 440 of our Cap-
itol Police and DC Police were injured 
in the events of January 6. 
I hope the respect and appreciation 
we show to law enforcement this week 
can be sustained year-round. Let us 
commit ourselves to doing all we can 
to support the men and women in blue 
who protect and serve us every single 
day.

S2430 
May 11, 2021 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Louisiana. 
Mr. CASSIDY. Madam President, I 
rise today in recognition of National 
Police Week, where we honor, remem-
ber, and support public servants who 
dedicate their lives to keeping our 
communities safe. 
Today, I specifically recognize Lou-
isiana law enforcement officers who 
lost their lives in 2020 performing their 
duty. We should all thank God for law 
enforcement officers and their willing-
ness to put their lives between us and 
danger, knowing that they may have to 
sacrifice their lives, as 15 did in Lou-
isiana this past year. 
To the families, wives, husbands, and 
children of these fallen Louisiana po-
lice officers, we share your pain, and 
we share your pride for he or she who 
was here for us all. 
These are the officers in Louisiana 
who died this past year in the line of 
service: Deputy Constable Levi Kelling 
Arnold, New Orleans First City Court; 
Trooper George Bowman Baker, Lou-
isiana State Police; SRO/Dare Officer 
Kejuane Artez Bates, Vidalia Police 
Department; Reserve Captain Raymond 
Andrew Boseman, New Orleans Police 
Department; Probation and Parole Of-
ficer Kaitlin Marie Cowley, Louisiana 
Department of Public Safety and Cor-
rections; 
Captain 
Steven 
Michael 
Gaudet, Jr., Pearl River Police Depart-
ment; Deputy Sheriff Claude Winston 
Guillory, Jefferson Davis Parish Sher-
iff’s Office; Senior Police Officer Mark 
Albert Hall, Sr., New Orleans Police 
Department; Lieutenant Glenn Dale 
Hutto, Jr., Baton Rouge Police Depart-
ment; Correctional Deputy Kietrell Mi-
chael Pitts, Tangipahoa Parish Sher-
iff’s 
Office; 
Deputy 
Sheriff 
Donna 
Michelle 
Richardson-Below, 
DeSoto 
Parish Sheriff’s Office; Captain Kevin 
Paul Trahan, Church Point Police De-
partment; 
Captain 
Randy 
Michael 
Vallot, Richland Parish Sheriff’s Of-
fice; Officer Marshall Lee Waters, Jr., 
Mangham Police Department; and Sen-
ior Police Officer Sharon M. Williams, 
New Orleans Police Department. 
Their passing—each of theirs—was 
felt throughout our States, and they 
are tragic reminders of the danger law 
enforcement officers face every day 
when they report for duty. And they 
know it; they accept the risk; their 
families accept the risk; and their 
spouse and their children. We must 
honor their sacrifice. 
I ask that we all join in prayer for 
the families of these fallen officers and 
that we keep in prayer those who pro-
tect us during the day. It is a difficult 
time, but knowing our country sup-
ports them can make all the difference. 
Just last week, the Audubon Zoo can-
celed the annual Blue at the Zoo event 
that seeks to promote and foster posi-
tive, interactive experiences with the 
New Orleans Police Department. The 
New Orleans Police Department super-
intendent, Shaun Ferguson, said he 
was ‘‘disheartened as a result of that 
decision.’’ 
Any opportunity for a positive con-
versation is an opportunity to improve 
relationships between law enforcement 
and 
communities. 
We 
need 
more 
events, not fewer. We have much work 
to do. 
But today, let’s acknowledge those 
who put their lives on the line every 
day they put on a uniform. Let’s re-
member those we have lost too soon. 
Let’s honor the work they do to keep 
us safe. 
With that, I yield the floor.

ator from Idaho.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2431 
May 11, 2021 
resolution, the OCC’s true lender rule. 
That is a rule that helps give con-
sumers more access to credit. 
Overturning the true lender rule is a 
bad idea. It would reduce access to 
credit for consumers, especially those 
who have the most difficulty obtaining 
credit. It would stifle innovation, and 
it would inhibit the functioning of our 
markets, our Nation’s banking and 
credit markets. 
Let me explain why preserving this 
rule is so important. In the last decade, 
we have seen financial technology com-
panies, often referred to as fintechs, 
use technology to revolutionize finan-
cial services. 
Community and midsized banks that 
often lack the resources to develop 
banking 
technology 
in-house 
are 
partnering with these fintechs to com-
pete more effectively and to offer their 
customers terrific services at ever-bet-
ter prices. That is what these partner-
ships do. They help consumers because 
they increase competition in lending 
markets, they lower the price of finan-
cial products, they improve credit op-
tions, 
and 
they 
expand 
consumer 
choice. 
Unfortunately, a patchwork of dif-
ferent legal tests in different courts 
had made it difficult to predict wheth-
er the bank or the fintech partner, 
when they have teamed up, would be 
considered legally responsible for a 
given loan they would make together. 
So last year, the OCC issued its true 
lender rule to provide the needed regu-
latory clarity. The rule—a simple 
version of this is, it simply holds that 
a national bank will be responsible for 
a loan if it is named in the loan agree-
ment or if it funds the loan, which 
banks often do when they team up with 
fintechs in these ways. 
Some of our Democratic colleagues 
have claimed that the rule, the true 
lender 
rule, 
allows 
unaccountable 
‘‘rent-a-charter’’ 
arrangements, 
as 
they call them, but in fact, the true 
lender rule prevents the rent-a-charter 
scheme, and it does so because it en-
sures that the national banks are ac-
countable for the loans they issue 
through these lending partnerships, 
and it requires the OCC to supervise 
those loans for compliance with con-
sumer protection and anti-discrimina-
tion laws. 
Other colleagues have expressed con-
cerns that the rule will ‘‘trap’’ con-
sumers in arrangements with high in-
terest rates and a principal balance 
that can never be paid back, but actu-
ally that is not possible with these 
OCC-chartered banks, which are the 
only ones affected by this rule. That is 
because a bank is required under the 
OCC resolution to assess a borrower’s 
ability to repay before making the 
loan. If a bank is systemically approv-
ing loans by this fintech partnership to 
consumers who can’t repay the debt, 
they will face serious consequences 
from their regulator, and that is a lot 
more protection than what would oth-
erwise exist for consumers. 
Some of my Democratic colleagues 
claim that the true lender law fun-
damentally 
changes 
existing 
laws 
around interest rates. In fact, it pre-
serves existing law. For over four dec-
ades, Federal law has allowed banks to 
essentially export the State law gov-
erning interest rates from the home 
State where the bank is based. So this 
allows the bank to comply with 1 law 
of the bank’s home State rather than 
have to try to comply with 50 different 
laws of the 50 States in which its cus-
tomers may reside. Having this single 
standard allows for a competitive na-
tional credit market. 
The true lender rule simply allows 
fintechs that partner with banks to get 
the same treatment. It is really not 
very different from what happens today 
with credit cards. And may I remind 
everyone, credit cards can often have 
high interest rates. 
So if you believe that bank-fintech 
providers shouldn’t be able to ‘‘export’’ 
interest rates from the State in which 
the bank is headquartered, then I sup-
pose you ought to be in favor of elimi-
nating credit cards for all Americans. 
Well, that would be a terrible policy. 
It would be a bad policy to get rid of 
the true lender rule as well. Now, I 
have heard the argument that the true 
lender rule somehow harms low-income 
consumers. In fact, the true lender rule 
benefits low-income consumers most 
by preserving their access to well-regu-
lated, bank-issued credit. 
Absent the rule, uncertainty about 
which partner, whether it is the bank 
or the fintech company, is the true 
lender means there would be uncer-
tainty about what laws to apply to the 
transaction and whether or not the 
loan would be considered valid. Well, 
without the rule, without that cer-
tainty, the secondary market for these 
loans would be disrupted, and, again, 
that disproportionately harms lower 
income borrowers. 
Why is that? Well, it is because 
banks frequently sell these loans after 
they are made so that they free up the 
capital to make the next loan. Banks 
can issue far fewer loans if they can’t 
reliably sell the ones that they have 
into the secondary market. Uncer-
tainty, as we would have in the absence 
of the true lender rule, diminishes 
their ability to sell into the secondary 
market, and that means fewer loans 
are going to get booked altogether. 
Those that are are going to be more ex-
pensive, and they will be limited to 
people of higher credit ratings. 
And this isn’t just my opinion. 
Forty-seven leading financial econo-
mists from Harvard, Stanford, and 
other leading universities made ex-
actly these points in an amicus brief 
supporting the existing rule. 
And we have empirical proof. Studies 
show that after a 2015 court ruling cre-
ated uncertainty about the ability to 
export interest rates to New York, it 
became significantly harder for higher 
risk borrowers to get loans in New 
York. 
This is not surprising. This is exactly 
what you would expect. This is what 
will happen nationally if this CRA is 
successful in repealing the true lender 
rule. 
Now, some of my colleagues want to 
overturn the true lender rule because 
doing so would subject more loans to 
State interest rate caps, they say. But, 
in fact, the more likely effect is that 
the loans will just never get made in 
the first place, and that is terrible for 
the low-income consumer for whom 
that loan is the best available option. 
The true lender rule preserves access 
to well-regulated, bank-offered credit. 
At end of the day, we need to remem-
ber, if the CRA is successful and the 
true lender rule is repealed, demand for 
credit won’t disappear. The need for 
credit doesn’t go away because we get 
rid of a good rule. You simply make it 
harder for people who need loans to get 
them, and you will drive consumers to 
unregulated alternatives. 
Voting in favor of the CRA, which 
would kill this rule, is also a direct as-
sault on fintech. It will make it harder 
for Congress to legislate in this area. It 
will make it harder for regulators to 
issue guidance and rules to promote 
the healthy competition that fintechs 
represent. Courts will see this as Con-
gress buying into this completely false 
notion that fintechs are somehow in-
herently ‘‘predatory’’—they are not— 
and it will scare away State legislators 
from promoting fintech. 
If you believe financial innovation 
and competition are good things for 
consumers, as I do, then you should op-
pose this CRA. 
For all these reasons, I urge my col-
leagues to join me in voting against 
S.J. Res. 15. 
I yield the floor.

ALS CAUCUS AND AWARENESS MONTH 
Mr. BRAUN. Madam President, today 
I am proud to join my colleague Sen-
ator COONS in relaunching the bipar-

Currently, there are no effective 
treatments or cures available to stop 
or slow the disease, and we still do not 
know what really causes ALS. 
More than 5,000 Americans are diag-
nosed each year. Yet there is no ALS 
survivor community. Individuals diag-
nosed with ALS and their loved ones 
rely on their elected officials to advo-
cate on their behalf. 
That is why the mission of the Sen-
ate ALS Caucus is to raise awareness 
about the difficulties faced by ALS pa-
tients and their families and to ad-
vance policies that improve their qual-
ity of life to advocate for meaningful 
research. 
May also marks ALS Awareness 
Month. Last Congress, Senator COONS 
and I introduced and passed a resolu-
tion to designate May 2020 as ALS 
Awareness Month. This effort, like the 
ALS 
Caucus, 
will 
raise 
awareness 
about the impact of ALS on those who 
are diagnosed, their loved ones, and 
their caregivers.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2432 
May 11, 2021 
I look forward to reintroducing again 
here in May 2021 the awareness month 
for ALS, and I hope my colleagues will 
help to pass this resolution again this 
year. 
There is more to be done, though, in 
really battling ALS. Promising thera-
pies that have demonstrated clinical 
safety and efficacy are on the horizon 
for those with ALS. Failure to approve 
those promising treatments means the 
difference between life and premature 
death for these patients, and, sadly, 
the paradigm of the past has been to 
not be erring on the side, when there is 
a promising treatment, to push it 
through the system. Sadly, it has been 
indicative of what happens often in 
this place, and that is that you belabor 
it, you stretch it out, and, in this case, 
it has a much different consequence. 
Patients with ALS have been very 
clear that they are willing to take a 
higher degree of risk to have access to 
these treatments at an earlier point in 
time. 
In September 2019, the FDA issued 
new guidance on developing drugs for 
ALS, which touted regulatory flexi-
bility when applying the standard of 
safety and efficacy to drugs or diseases 
with serious, unmet medical needs. 
FDA guidance has been an empty 
promise, and patients with ALS lack 
flexible regulatory pathways to prom-
ising treatments as a result. 
Indicative, in a way, of what I men-
tioned earlier, where we seem to al-
ways be aware of those kinds of issues, 
we tell the Agencies that might be in-
volved, and then there is that natural 
tendency toward inertia. 
For example, Amylyx, a pharma-
ceutical company focused on devel-
oping ALS treatments, announced clin-
ical trial results of a promising treat-
ment that slowed the progression of 
the disease and increased survival by 6 
months. It may not seem like a long 
time, but when you take into consider-
ation from the point of diagnosis to the 
point of dying from ALS, that is a lot 
of time, and the benefit of the doubt, 
when you have a promising clinical 
trial, needs to be given to the patient 
so that they have some hope. 
Europeans and Canadians have put a 
dynamic into place that would be 
quicker footed than our own FDA’s. We 
need to take that as some guidance. 
Unfortunately, 
the 
FDA 
has 
ex-
pressed the need for additional clinical 
trials before allowing patients to ac-
cess these drugs in the United States. 
This means Americans with ALS will 
not receive access when they can see 
others in Canada and Europe being able 
to. 
We need to get with it, and when you 
have the condition of no effective 
treatment and it is working in other 
places, we need to give the benefit of 
the doubt. 
It is failing to use its flexibility, and 
we have just seen—and I witnessed, all 
of us did, with the coronavirus—FDA, 
CDC squabbling out of the gate about 
what to do with coronavirus. 
Thank goodness we did do something 
that was going to change that dy-
namic. We would still be wrestling over 
a vaccine if it had been business as 
usual. 
So it is clear here, for even a better 
reason, that nothing is out there that 
is working, promising things on the ho-
rizon. We need to do better. That is 
why I will be reintroducing the Prom-
ising Pathway Act, the legislative solu-
tion to give those struggling with life- 
threatening 
illnesses, 
like 
ALS, 
a 
fighting chance of access to timely, 
meaningful 
treatments, 
especially 
when they are overwhelmingly wanting 
it, willing to take the risk. 
The Promising Pathway Act would 
require the FDA—require the FDA—to 
establish a rolling, realtime priority 
review to evaluate the progress and not 
make it subjective, the way it is now, 
to where they can do what they have 
been doing, and that is dragging their 
feet. 
Under this pathway, provisional ap-
proval would be granted by the FDA to 
drugs demonstrating substantial evi-
dence of safety and relevant evidence 
of positive therapeutic outcomes, like 
those demonstrated in Amylyx’s clin-
ical trials. 
It is right here. We just need to do it, 
and you are going to be doing what 
ALS patients would prefer. 
This also encourages further research 
and clinical trials in not only ALS, but 
this, of course, should apply to other 
diseases that are similar where we are 
still wrestling, in clinical trials, with 
the ability to get these across the fin-
ish line. But it does strengthen the 
FDA’s postmarket surveillance, which 
is another important thing for patient 
safety, and grants access to promising 
treatments covered by insurance. 
To my colleagues, it is time to roll 
up our sleeves and to work to advance 
policies that improve the quality of 
ALS patients. I encourage every Mem-
ber to lean in on this, to be a part of it, 
so that we can help people that have no 
other hope. 
It is up to us to speak for those who 
can no longer speak, to stand up for 
those who can no longer stand. 
I am grateful to my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle who are return-
ing members of the ALS Caucus, and I 
welcome those who are new to the cau-
cus this Congress. 
As the ALS Caucus continues to grow 
its membership, our commitment to 
the mission of the ALS Caucus and the 
ALS community is strengthened along 
the way. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MUR-
PHY). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
NATIONAL POLICE WEEK 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this 
is National Police Week, and yesterday 
I spoke about the importance of police 
in our activities, our daily life. I come 
to the floor now to address my col-
leagues about a piece of legislation I 
am putting in. 
I recently reintroduced the Pro-
tecting America’s First Responders 
Act, a bipartisan bill cosponsored by 11 
of my colleagues. This bill passed the 
Senate by unanimous consent in the 
last Congress. 
In this new Congress, it is time that 
we once again turn our attention to the 
public service officers across our Na-
tion who steadfastly serve and protect 
fellow Americans. These great men and 
women fulfill some of our most vital 
and irreplaceable needs. Their duties 
affect every part of our communities. 
We have seen that clearly—very clear-
ly—over the past year as their services 
have been instrumental in keeping our 
communities safe during the pandemic. 
Our firefighters dedicate themselves 
to braving harrowing fires. Our police 
officers rush headlong into danger to 
protect the innocent. Emergency first 
responders dutifully come to the aid of 
the injured, no matter the threat. De-
spite these vast responsibilities, their 
purpose is very much the same: to 
serve and protect their communities. 
We know this call to service comes 
with great risk. We, in Congress, will 
forever be indebted to the Capitol Po-
lice officers who suffered substantial 
injuries and even gave their lives on 
these very grounds. 
There is no way for us to truly com-
prehend or repay the sacrifices made 
by these officers and their loved ones 
left behind. Yet, knowing this, our pub-
lic safety officers willingly accept the 
responsibilities of injury and, if need 
be, lay down their lives to fulfill their 
duties and their oaths. 
We owe our firefighters, law enforce-
ment, and all of our first responders a 
great deal, and we don’t say thank you 
enough. They don’t hesitate to take ac-
tion when we need them to, and we 
must be equally steadfast in coming to 
their aid by ensuring that those offi-
cers, disabled or killed—killed in the 
line of duty—receive what they are 
due. 
They must receive what we, in Con-
gress, first promised now four and a 
half decades ago through the law that 
is called the Public Safety Officers’ 
Benefit Program. So the original PSOB 
Program was created in 1976. Yet, since 
that time, it has been plagued with un-
clear and out-of-date regulations, forc-
ing families of our fallen heroes to con-
tinually suffer through technical inter-
pretations and drawn-out claim proc-
esses. This cannot continue. 
This bill that 11 of us have intro-
duced, the Protecting America’s First 
Responders Act, ensures that disability 
claims are consistent with Congress’s 
original intent for the PSOB Program. 
It received wide bipartisan support 
here in the U.S. Senate in the last Con-
gress. Unfortunately, the bill stalled in 
the House.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2433 
May 11, 2021 
Over the last year, I worked closely 
with Congressman PASCRELL to allevi-
ate 
opposition 
and 
work 
through 
amendments that can pass the House. I 
am confident that with these changes, 
it will reach the President’s desk very 
quickly. 
The 117th Congress has a fresh oppor-
tunity to make this bill law, and there 
are many waiting for us to do exactly 
that. I introduce this bill with strong 
support from organizations, including 
the Fraternal Order of Police, the Fed-
eral Law Enforcement Officers Associa-
tion, and the National Association of 
Police Organizations. I urge my col-
leagues to, once again, vote for the 
Protecting America’s First Responders 
Act, thereby fulfilling the original 
promise to honor those whose lives 
were forever altered by their service. 
RUSSIA INVESTIGATION 
Mr. President, on another subject, I 
come to the floor probably to explain 
to my colleagues something I have 
done on three or four different occa-
sions, and nobody ever seems to get it 
right. So I am back here again trying 
to explain something so we don’t have 
to deal with it again. 
So here we go again. While I was 
traveling throughout Iowa meeting 
with constituents, I kept my eyes on 
news reporting out of Washington, DC. 
I have seen a lot of bad reporting in my 
time. The events that occurred start-
ing on April 30 are there at the top of 
bad reporting. 
The Washington Post, the New York 
Times, and NBC all had to retract their 
reporting 
about 
Russian 
disinformation warnings given to Rudy 
Giuliani. I am not here to talk about 
Rudy Giuliani. I am talking about how 
this report affects me and Senator 
JOHNSON because, unfortunately, in the 
Washington Post article, my and Sen-
ator JOHNSON’s investigations into the 
Biden family’s financial dealings was 
tethered, 
once 
again, 
to 
Russian 
disinformation 
attempts, 
and 
that 
tethering is what I have been here on 
the floor of the Senate, over the last 
maybe more than a year now, trying to 
explain that that just is a big hoax. 
The report was based on anonymous 
current and former U.S. officials. Ap-
parently, the Washington Post still 
hasn’t figured out how to read a Senate 
report. My staff also spent many hours 
talking with the Post the day before 
the story ran in order to help them un-
derstand. And I presume they called us; 
we didn’t call them. 
I am going to quote from my staff’s 
emailing them the following, which, in 
the end, the Post completely ignored in 
their article. So here is a long email: 
Sen. Grassley’s report with Sen. Johnson 
relied 
on 
Obama-era 
U.S. 
government 
records and information from a Democrat- 
aligned U.S. lobby shop, which employed 
Telizhenko while representing the corrupt 
Ukrainian gas company Burisma. 
The email goes on: 
Sen. Grassley never received a defensive 
briefing related to his oversight of the Biden 
family’s foreign business ventures. Discus-
sions with the FBI and the Intelligence Com-
munity were initiated by requests from 
Democrats, as is detailed in Section Ten of 
the report. 
The FBI and members of the Intelligence 
Community indicated last year that there 
was no reason for the committee’s investiga-
tion to be halted, even with knowledge of 
Telizhenko’s limited involvement (see report 
page 59). 
This is what the email says to the 
Post. Continuing to read from my 
staff’s email to them: 
The report and its underlying transcripts 
further reveal that Telizhenko had deep and 
longstanding 
relationships 
with 
Obama 
State Department officials, National Secu-
rity Council staff and left-wing lobbyists. 
The transcripts also illustrate that material 
created by Derkach was introduced by Demo-
crats, not Republicans, and it was quickly 
rejected 
by 
an 
expert 
witness 
as 
disinformation. 
And then in parenthesis, it says: 
‘‘([S]ee Minority Exhibit J and George 
Kent’s response to Minority staff re-
garding that exhibit).’’ 
Continuing to report from the email 
to the Post: 
Following a classified letter authored by 
Democratic leadership, portions of which 
were later leaked and reportedly referenced 
Derkach, Democrats again sought an FBI 
and Intelligence Community briefing, which 
was provided in August of 2020. At that brief-
ing, the FBI stated that it’s not attempting 
to— 
And these are the words that the FBI 
used— 
‘‘quash, curtail, or interfere’’ in the inves-
tigation in any way. 
And then in parenthesis it says: 
‘‘([S]ee report, page 59).’’ 
That’s not the sort of direction provided at 
defensive briefings. 
This is what my staff’s email says to 
the Post. 
Obviously, we didn’t rely on any of this for 
the report’s findings on Hunter Biden’s and 
James Biden’s extensive financial entangle-
ments with questionable foreign nationals, 
including some connected to the communist 
Chinese government. Subsequent to the re-
port, the public has also learned that Hunter 
Biden is under criminal investigation relat-
ing to his financial entanglements. 
Given Telizheko’s longstanding ties to 
Blue Star Strategies and Obama administra-
tion officials, are you similarly asking them 
whether they played into some Russian- 
pushed narrative? 
I am going to go back because that 
question needs to be repeated. It is not 
repeated in the email I am reading to 
you. 
Given Telizheko’s longstanding ties to 
Blue Star Strategies and Obama administra-
tion officials, are you— 
Meaning the Post— 
similarly asking them whether they played 
into some Russian-pushed narrative? 
Given that Democrats introduced Derkach 
material, are you similarly asking them 
whether they played into some Russian- 
pushed narrative? 
Now, that is the end of the quote, and 
I think those last two questions indi-
cate—because, obviously, the news-
paper article doesn’t say that they 
asked these questions that I repeated 
one twice and then the other question. 
They aren’t really interested in getting 
to the bottom of this. 
Now, after all this information and 
long phone conversations, the Wash-
ington Post opted for unnamed sources 
rather than on-the-record comments 
from my staff. So they had an oppor-
tunity to quote Grassley and explain 
all this stuff, and what do they do? 
They 
used 
an 
anonymous 
source. 
Maybe the Post should work on putting 
more investigation into so-called in-
vestigative reporting instead of focus-
ing on false Russian disinformation 
narratives; for example, maybe spend 
some time investigating the Biden 
family’s ties to Chinese nationals con-
nected to the Communist regime’s 
military and intelligence services. 
I 
have 
addressed 
these 
Russian 
disinformation issues at length in my 
committee report with Senator JOHN-
SON, as well as right here on the floor 
of the Senate three or four times over 
the course of many months, maybe 
stretching into more than a year. I am 
going to do this again even though I 
have better things to do. If you want 
every detail, read section 10 in our Sep-
tember 23, 2020, report. 
On July 13, 2020, then-Minority Lead-
er SCHUMER, Senator WARNER, Speaker 
PELOSI, and Representative SCHIFF sent 
a letter with a classified attachment to 
the FBI to express a purported belief 
that Congress was the subject of a for-
eign 
disinformation 
campaign. 
The 
classified attachment included unclas-
sified elements that attempted and 
failed to tie our work to Andrii 
Derkach, a Russian agent. This docu-
ment falsely accused us of potentially 
receiving material from Derkach. It 
was pure speculative nonsense that the 
liberal media ran with as what they 
would call or want you to believe was 
the truth. Do you know what it was? It 
was garbage. Those unclassified ele-
ments were leaked to the press to sup-
port a false campaign accusing us of 
using Russian disinformation. 
Then, during the course of our inves-
tigation, we ran a transcribed inter-
view of George Kent. Before that inter-
view, 
the 
Democrats 
acquired 
Derkach’s 
materials. 
During 
that 
interview, they asked 
the 
witness 
about it. He stated: 
What you’re asking me to interpret is a 
master chart of disinformation and malign 
influence. 
At that interview, the Democrats in-
troduced known disinformation into 
the investigative record as an exhibit. 
Now, more precisely, the Democrats re-
lied upon and disseminated known 
disinformation from a foreign source 
who 
the 
intelligence 
community 
warned was actively seeking to influ-
ence U.S. politics. 
But there is yet more. On July 16, 
then-Ranking Member WYDEN and Sen-
ator PETERS wrote a letter to me and 
Senator JOHNSON asking for a briefing 
from the intelligence community on 
matters relating to our investigation. 
On July 28, 2020, Senator JOHNSON 
and I reminded those two Senators

that the FBI and relevant members of 
the intelligence community had al-
ready briefed the committee in March 
2020 and assured us that there was no 
reason to discontinue the investigation 
we were involved in. 
In August 2020, subsequent to these 
Democrat-led letters, Senator JOHNSON 
and I had a briefing from the FBI on 
behalf of the intelligence community. 
However, in that briefing, the FBI dis-
cussed 
matters 
that 
were 
already 
known and completely irrelevant to 
the substance of our investigation. The 
FBI also made clear that it was not at-
tempting to—and these are the FBI’s 
words—‘‘quash, curtail, or interfere’’ in 
the investigation in any way. 
Any talk about an FBI briefing warn-
ing us that our investigation into the 
Biden family’s financial and business 
associations was connected to Russian 
disinformation is complete nonsense. 
No such briefing ever happened. Our in-
vestigation was based on Obama ad-
ministration government records and 
records from a Democrat-aligned lobby 
shop, Blue Star Strategies. If those 
records 
amount 
to 
Russian 
disinformation, then that means the 
Obama 
administration 
dealt 
in 
disinformation every day, which brings 
me to the ultimate point I want to 
bring to attention today. 
The FBI assured me that the August 
2020 briefing, which was a pointless 
briefing that shouldn’t have happened, 
would remain confidential. That is 
what the FBI told us, that it would be 
confidential. However, I was concerned 
that the substance of this briefing or at 
least elements relating to it would 
leak, and I knew that once it did, the 
briefing would be misreported and used 
to paint our investigation in a false 
light. That is exactly what happened 
last week. 
Although the Washington Post failed, 
the Wall Street Journal got it right in 
its May 4 editorial titled ‘‘The FBI’s 
Dubious Briefing.’’ 
I ask unanimous consent to have 
that editorial printed in the RECORD. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[May 4, 2021] 
THE FBI’S DUBIOUS BRIEFING 
(By the Editorial Board) 
Did the FBI set up two Members of Con-
gress for political attack under the guise of 
a ‘‘defensive briefing’’? It’s possible, and Sen-
ators Ron Johnson and Chuck Grassley are 
rightly demanding answers. 
On Monday the Republicans sent a letter 
to FBI Director Christopher Wray and Direc-
tor of National Intelligence Avril Haines 
asking how the Washington Post came to 
know about an FBI briefing to both Senators 
on Aug. 6, 2020. A Post story last week used 
the info to smear Mr. Johnson and his report 
on Hunter Biden’s foreign business dealings, 
suggesting that he’d ignored FBI warnings 
and thus may have been manipulated by the 
Kremlin. The newspaper cited only anony-
mous ‘‘current and former U.S. officials.’’ 
In their letter the Senators note that the 
briefing came after ‘‘pressure from Demo-
cratic Leadership.’’ In July 2020, the Demo-
cratic Members of the Gang of Eight—senior 
Members with access to intelligence se-
crets—had sent a letter and classified adden-
dum to Mr. Wray specifically citing the 
Johnson-Grassley probe into Hunter Biden as 
reason for an urgent briefing for Congress 
about foreign ‘‘disinformation.’’ That news 
was then leaked, in what was an obvious at-
tempt to tar the work of the two Repub-
licans. 
The two Senators became more concerned 
when the ensuing briefing by the FBI turned 
out to be what they described as ‘‘not spe-
cific’’ as well as ‘‘unconnected to our inves-
tigation.’’ (Their report was based on U.S. 
government documents.) They specifically 
expressed to the FBI during the briefing 
their concerns that it would be ‘‘subject to a 
leak’’ for partisan gain. Which is exactly 
what happened last week, despite the FBI’s 
promise to the Senators of confidentiality. 
After the August briefing, Messrs. Johnson 
and Grassley sent a letter demanding that 
Mr. Wray and the intelligence community 
disclose the reason for it. They never re-
ceived the answer. In light of last week’s 
leak, they are renewing their demand to 
know who recommended the briefing, and 
the intelligence that supposedly supported 
it. 
Whether the FBI was pressured, duped, or 
actively political, the bureau has again land-
ed in the center of a partisan fight. Mr. Wray 
might ask how that keeps happening. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. The editorial began 
this way: 
Did the FBI set up two Members of Con-
gress for political attack under the guise of 
a ‘‘defensive briefing’’? It’s possible, and Sen-
ators Ron Johnson and Chuck Grassley are 
rightly demanding answers. 
On May 3, Senator JOHNSON and I 
wrote to FBI Director Christopher 
Wray and Director of National Intel-
ligence Avril Haines, asking to meet 
with them to discuss the August 20 
briefing. We need answers, and we need 
answers now. Why did the FBI and the 
intelligence community brief us? Who 
made that decision? At the briefing, 
the FBI didn’t even show us what intel-
ligence product formed the basis for 
the briefing. 
I will tell you this, even without see-
ing any paperwork, we were already 
aware of everything they talked about 
that very day, and it was unconnected 
to the substance of our investigation. 
I asked the FBI whether they had 
any new intelligence to share because 
we hadn’t heard anything new, and 
they didn’t give us a single new item. 
So, as far as I am concerned, the brief-
ing was totally unnecessary. 
Based on the timeline of events, it 
appears the briefing was done because 
the Democrats wanted it done, which 
means it was a political decision. 
The Wall Street Journal ended its 
piece by saying this: 
Whether the FBI was pressured, duped, or 
actively political, the bureau has again land-
ed in the center of a partisan fight. Mr. Wray 
might [want to] ask how that keeps hap-
pening. 
That is exactly right. The FBI and 
the intelligence community have lots 
of explaining to do. 
We already know that under Comey, 
the FBI used intelligence briefings as 
surveillance operations against Trump 
and his team. Did the FBI and the in-
telligence 
community 
also 
misuse 
briefing 
processes 
against 
congres-
sional Members? Only Director Wray 
and Director Haines can answer that 
question, and so far, they have failed to 
answer those questions. Their credi-
bility and, more importantly, their 
professionalism are on the line. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The Senator is recognized. 
SOFTWOOD LUMBER 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, we have 
seen across many sectors of our econ-
omy the onset of the COVID–19 pan-
demic and its consequences. It has dra-
matically shifted the supply and de-
mand for lots of products in unexpected 
ways. 
I am on the floor today to speak 
about the price of lumber and the im-
pact the soaring costs are having on 
homebuilders and on home buyers. 
Nationwide, construction for new 
homes is up 37 percent over the last 
year and up 87 percent in the Midwest 
region, where I come from. Rising de-
mand for new home construction, as 
well as an upturn in do-it-yourself 
home projects during the pandemic, 
have rapidly driven up the cost of lum-
ber. As a result, since last April, over-
all lumber prices are up over 300 per-
cent. 
Lumber and wood products account 
for roughly 15 percent of the construc-
tion costs for a single-family home. We 
all work to see that that single-family 
home is something that is available to 
Americans. It is the American dream. 
But lumber accounts for the second 
largest overall cost of building a new 
home, only behind the cost of the land 
the home sits on. These increases have 
resulted in a $36,000 increase in the 
price of a typical single-family home 
and a $13,000 increase in the market 
value of a multifamily unit. 
The reality is that record-high lum-
ber prices are putting the American 
dream of home ownership out of reach 
for hundreds of thousands of potential 
home buyers and disproportionately 
harming middle- and low-income fami-
lies across our Nation. 
At a time when residential home-
building is booming, it is essential that 
homebuilders and consumers have ac-
cess to the materials they need at com-
petitive prices. 
Historically, Canada has been the 
largest foreign supplier of softwood 
lumber in the United States. These im-
ports are vital to support the ongoing 
housing boom but have been declining. 
These imports have been declining over 
the past 4 years. 
In April 2017, the U.S. Department of 
Commerce announced countervailing

duties 
averaging 
20 
percent 
on 
softwood lumber products from certain 
Canadian producers. In December of 
2020, the average tariff was reduced to 
9 percent. While a reduction in tariffs 
for some Canadian producers is a step 
in the right direction, the complete 
elimination of these tariffs is nec-
essary to provide additional relief for 
rising lumber prices. 
At a recent Commerce, Justice, and 
Science Appropriations Subcommittee 
hearing, I raised this topic with U.S. 
Trade Representative Katherine Tai 
and urged her to engage with her Cana-
dian counterpart to reach a long-term 
agreement on softwood lumber trade. 
It is American home buyers, not Cana-
dian lumber producers, who end up 
paying the cost of these trade restric-
tions. 
In addition to working to resolve this 
trade dispute, we should also work to 
boost the domestic production of the 
types of lumber used in home construc-
tion. Additional lumber can and should 
be sustainably harvested from public 
lands managed by the U.S. Forest Serv-
ice and the Bureau of Land Manage-
ment. Adding to the existing lumber 
supply and ensuring that domestic saw-
mills are operating at full capacity will 
help soften lumber prices. 
It is important for Kansans to have 
the opportunity and economic means 
to own their own homes. Unfortu-
nately, the current lumber prices are 
making that dream unattainable for 
way too many families. 
Resolving the longstanding trade dis-
pute with Canada on softwood lumber 
and better managing our public lands 
to increase lumber production will 
both help alleviate the problems facing 
homebuilders and home buyers. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the

Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CHINA 
Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, in Decem-
ber of 2019, as a new virus was emerg-
ing on the opposite side of the world, I 
spoke at the National Defense Univer-
sity, and the title of the speech I gave 
was called ‘‘American Industrial Policy 
and the Rise of China.’’ 
The reaction of many people to that 
at the time was skepticism—from Wall 
Street investors who, frankly, saw no 
problem with the status quo on China; 
from these think-tank experts who 
mocked my claim at the time that our 
country relied too much on China eco-
nomically in our supply chain; and 
from tech giants in Silicon Valley ob-
sessed with access to the Chinese mar-
ketplace. 
But the problem I pointed to at that 
time in that speech, almost 2 years 
ago—a year and a half ago—was that 
for over a quarter century, our eco-
nomic policies have been mostly about 
one thing: how American investors and 
companies can make money by doing 
business with China. In that vein, it 
didn’t matter if making money meant 
allowing China to steal our intellectual 
property, it didn’t matter if making 
money meant stable American jobs 
kept disappearing, and it didn’t matter 
if making money meant investing in 
Chinese companies developing tech-
nologies to help defeat our country in a 
future war. 
Finally, Americans are waking up to 
what a mistake that was. It was a bi-
partisan consensus that was flawed. 
The 21st century will be defined by 
the relationship between China and the 
United States. Frankly, I believe that 
this is our last chance to make sure 
that it is a balanced relationship. 
What we do not have time for are 
China bills or a China bill that is a col-
lection of half-measures and studies. 
Instead, an actually meaningful China 
bill is what we need. I believe most 
Members here want it, and I believe we 
can get to it in a bipartisan way. But, 
to do so, I think it has to have six 
things. If you want a meaningful bill 
on China, it must touch on six things. 
The first is like I said in December of 
2019: We need to identify industries 
which are critical for our future, and 
we must spur investment in these key 
industries. We have to remember that 
we are not in a strategic competition 
with foreign Chinese companies. We 
are in a strategic competition with the 
world’s largest and second wealthiest 
nation-state. 
There is no way to compete with 
China by relying only, solely on pri-
vate investment, not while the Chinese 
Communist 
Party 
subsidizes 
and 
cheats to boost its favorite companies. 
From industrial corporate giants to 
small businesses that make up our sup-
ply chain, the private sector is the 
most important area of this competi-
tion. We can encourage them to step 
up, just like we did for semiconductors 
with the CHIPS Act. 
Frankly, the way we developed the 
vaccine with Operation Warp Speed is 
an example of a targeted industrial pol-
icy in which government partners with 
the private sector to solve a big prob-
lem. You can say what you want about 
America’s response to COVID, but we 
have done vaccines better than anyone 
else in the world—not even close—and 
it is due to that partnership. 
But an essential part of our strategy 
has to be, as a result, to build a strong 
foundation through targeted and sus-
tained Federal funding for American 
research and development. The bipar-
tisan Endless Frontier Act is a nod in 
that direction. Right now, that bill 
makes the National Science Founda-
tion the lead Agency in directing $100 
billion in government investment. The 
problem is that is the same Agency 
that, time and again, has had the re-
search we fund stolen by professors and 
graduate students who are on the pay-
roll for China. 
DARPA and other advanced research 
Agencies within government have a 
much better record of protecting re-
search and, I believe, would be a far 
better choice to administer these in-
vestments, instead. 
The second thing a real China bill 
must do is communicate that while we 
do not seek an armed confrontation 
with China, we will confront any mili-
tary aggression, we will maintain our 
defense commitments with our allies, 
and we will win any conflict China 
starts. 
We must never do anything that 
leads Beijing to doubt our commitment 
to Taiwan, and we must never accept 
the Chinese Communist Party’s illegit-
imate claims on the world’s most im-
portant shipping lanes in the South 
and East China Seas. The Strategic 
Competition Act we recently passed 
out of the Foreign Relations Com-
mittee is largely silent on this topic, 
but Chairman MENENDEZ has pledged to 
work with me to include my South 
China Sea and East China Sea Sanc-
tions Act in any final bill that we take 
up here on the floor. 
The third thing a real China bill 
must do is fix broken international and 
domestic trade laws. The World Trade 
Organization is failing miserably, and 
it must be reformed. And China’s fla-
grant intellectual property theft, in-
dustrial espionage, and massive sub-
sidies to Chinese companies can no 
longer be ignored and they must be ad-
dressed. My Fair Trade with China En-
forcement Act would help protect crit-
ical industries in America from Chi-
nese influence and possession and re-
cover the lost value of secrets and 
technologies that they have stolen. 
The fourth area of focus of any real 
China bill must be making sure China 
doesn’t control our medicines and/or 
our medical technology and patient 
data. Last year, panic over masks and 
ventilators was a wake-up call for our 
medical dependence on Beijing. 
From blood thinners to acetamino-
phen, which is the ingredient in Ty-
lenol, we have allowed China to domi-
nate 
the 
pharmaceutical 
manufac-
turing market. It is dangerous leverage 
over 
America 
and 
Americans. 
We 
should be able to make medicines here. 
This will not only make us safer; it 
will create well-paying, stable jobs for 
American workers. My Medical Manu-
facturing, Economic Development, and 
Sustainability Act would do exactly 
that and should be included in any real 
China bill. 
As I said in September of 2019, we 
must immediately enact stricter guide-
lines to make sure that public funding 
never contributes to Chinese genomics 
efforts and beats them in that R&D 
race. If we allow China to dominate ge-
netic data and that field of medicine, 
Americans will one day find them-
selves begging Chinese companies, and 
even the Chinese Communist Party, for 
access to future lifesaving treatments. 
The fifth area a real China bill must 
address is our capital markets. Our

stock market is the most open, liquid, 
and profitable in the world, and it is 
being used by the Chinese Communist 
Party to fund its military and to fund 
their 
companies. 
Any 
meaningful 
China bill must cut off the tap and pro-
hibit American money from being in-
vested in communist China’s military 
companies. 
We need to start requiring more 
transparency from Wall Street when it 
comes to investing in China and Chi-
nese 
Government-controlled 
compa-
nies. My American Financial Markets 
Integrity and Security Act needs to be 
part of the solution. 
How can we claim to be dealing with 
Chinese manipulation of our capital 
markets if we don’t ban Chinese com-
panies exploiting our own stock mar-
ket to hurt us? Beijing long ago figured 
out how to get rich and powerful Amer-
icans to use their influence in Amer-
ican politics. 
Allowing Wall Street and Big Fi-
nance to enrich themselves by hurting 
Americans may make a lot of money in 
the short term for those individuals, 
but it is hurting America in the long 
run. It is national economic suicide. 
The sixth area any real China bill 
must address is genocide. Today, in 
China, nationless corporations, cooper-
ating with the Chinese Communist 
Party, force Uighur Muslims to make 
clothing and shoes and even solar pan-
els. Sadly, without knowing it, you 
may have very well purchased a prod-
uct made partially or entirely by slave 
labor in Xinjiang. 
These companies partnering with 
China are complicit in these crimes. 
The Chinese Communist Party’s re-
duced labor costs mean increased prof-
its for these corporations. While they 
lecture us about social justice in Amer-
ica, these companies are making bil-
lions off of slavery in China. 
My bipartisan Uyghur Forced Labor 
Prevention Act has almost half the 
Senate as cosponsors. We must take it 
up and pass it out of the Foreign Rela-
tions Committee as soon as possible. 
Last year, we saw companies like 
Nike, Apple, Coca-Cola, and even the 
U.S. Chamber of Commerce lobbying 
against this bill. Well, soon we are 
going to find out what holds more 
power in our country: corporations 
making billions off genocide and slav-
ery or our basic sense of right and 
wrong. 
The good news is that, today, we 
have finally awoken to the reality of 
how wrong the old consensus on China 
was. But we woke up almost too late. 
We don’t have time for half-measures. 
We must address the dangerous grow-
ing imbalance between America and 
China comprehensively, decisively, and 
swiftly, or we will live to see a future 
in which the world’s most powerful na-
tion is a totalitarian, genocidal, com-
munist dictatorship and our country is 
relegated to the role of a once-great 
nation in decline. 
No part of our lives will go unaf-
fected in a world like that. We can see 
the shadows of it even today. American 
movies today are free to portray their 
own country here, the United States, 
as racist, as bigoted, anything they 
want, but they automatically self-cen-
sor their own movies to make sure 
they meet China’s standards so they 
can show those films there. 
American 
corporations 
threaten 
States whose democratically elected 
leaders pass laws they object to. They 
have every right in our democracy to 
object, but they will fire American em-
ployees and ban messages that risk 
getting their corporation kicked out of 
the Chinese market. 
And American teenagers are already 
turning over valuable personal data to 
the Chinese Government on an hourly 
basis in exchange for the ability to 
watch what I will admit are clever vid-
eos on TikTok. 
Yet, this is nothing compared to the 
world that awaits if we do not take ac-
tion, and on this the lessons of history 
could not be clearer. 
Athens emerged from the second Per-
sian war a great power, but their great-
ness made them decadent and compla-
cent. They thought nothing would ever 
change, that they could ignore impor-
tant problems, that they could focus on 
the trivial. So when conflict finally 
came, initially they used their superior 
navy to attack Sparta and retreat be-
hind the safety of the city’s walls. 
That worked for a little while. Then 
a plague decimated the city, and more 
enemies of theirs sensed their weak-
ness and joined the fight against them. 
Then Athens fell. 
Like Rome and Britain later, the end 
of Athens’ golden age came as it al-
ways does for a great power. It doesn’t 
come from the outside in; it always 
comes from the inside out. 
Now, from across the centuries, the 
lessons of history cry out for our atten-
tion. Our politics are broken. We fight 
over the trivial because we think the 
past is irrelevant, because we think our 
place in the world will never change, 
and because we think the future will 
always belong to us automatically. We 
hide behind our own version of the 
walls, two vast oceans, believing, ulti-
mately, we are safe from everything 
outside. 
We should not repeat the errors of 
the great powers of the past. My 
friends, we don’t have time for studies 
and strategy statements. We need big 
changes and decisive action. We need 
to prove that our democracy can work 
again, that our system of government 
can function, and that it can solve big 
problems in big ways. 
If we succeed, I truly believe a new 
American century lies ahead. If we fail, 
it is a century of humiliation that 
awaits us. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
S.J. RES. 15 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I 
am on the floor to urge my colleagues 
on both sides of the aisle to support the 
resolution that we will be voting on 
shortly. This is a resolution to protect 
all of our constituents against preda-
tory lenders—people who lend others 
money at loan shark rates and often in 
deceptive language that can be very 
confusing to consumers until they get 
the phone call, and they are told they 
owe unaffordable amounts on loans. 
And States have been working very 
hard to protect consumers. In fact, 45 
States—States with Republican Gov-
ernors and Democratic Governors, Re-
publican attorneys general and Demo-
cratic attorneys general—45 States and 
the District of Columbia have passed 
laws to protect their constituents, 
their consumers from these loan shark- 
type loans, from these predatory lend-
ing practices. 
But we have seen these predatory 
lenders find a way around these State 
efforts to protect their consumers. And 
the tactic they used has come to be 
known as ‘‘rent-a-bank.’’ And the way 
it works is that national banks can 
make loans into any State, even if they 
are not chartered in that State. And so 
what has happened is, some of these 
lenders then go to a national bank and 
essentially just borrow their name, buy 
the rights to their name and, using 
that mechanism, then can make loans 
into all 50 States, in violation of the 
State law protections against these 
usurious loans. That is what is hap-
pening now. 
Now, when this whole problem began 
to emerge, we saw the Federal Gov-
ernor take action. In fact, the minute 
the OCC and the FDIC and State gov-
ernments caught wind of this new trick 
in the loan shark playbook, they took 
action. In fact, under President George 
W. Bush, the OCC—the Office of the 
Comptroller of the Currency—called 
these ‘‘rent-a-bank’’ schemes ‘‘an abuse 
of the national bank charter.’’ And 
President Bush’s Comptroller of the 
Currency explained that the OCC was 
‘‘greatly concerned with arrangements 
in which national banks essentially 
rent out their charters.’’ 
And that stance and that position 
was echoed by State legislatures— 
again, legislatures from both parties, 
Governors from both parties who then 
worked to pass laws, State laws, to 
limit the amount that people could 
charge as interest rates on loans. 
In fact, just last year, in the State of 
Nebraska, voters passed a ballot initia-
tive with more than 70 percent support 
to cap interest rates at 36 percent on 
consumer loans. That is the same cap 
we have in my State of Maryland and 
the same cap that more and more 
States are adopting across the country. 
So States are taking measures to pro-
tect their constituents, their con-
sumers, against these end-runs around 
their laws designed to prohibit these 
predatory practices. 
But last October, in the middle of the 
pandemic, when many working fami-
lies were plunged into economic uncer-
tainty and turmoil, the former admin-
istration—the Trump administration—

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2437 
May 11, 2021 
gave these ‘‘rent-a-bank’’ schemes a 
free pass to exploit these loopholes 
again, to create an end-run around 
those State protections for their con-
sumers. 
In 
the 
last 
administration—the 
Trump administration—the OCC un-
veiled what they called the true lender 
rule. Well, it is a nice-sounding name, 
an innocent name, but the consequence 
of that is to unleash the full force of 
predatory lending on working families. 
And it reneges on and reverses decades 
of both State and Federal government 
policy to prevent this end-run on usury 
caps. 
What we have seen is predatory lend-
ers move quickly into the space when 
the Trump administration opened the 
door to it. One online lender recently 
told its investors that it was going to 
get around California’s new interest 
rate cap by making loans through 
‘‘bank sponsors that are not subject to 
the same proposed State level rate lim-
itations.’’ 
So what you do is you go to a na-
tional bank, and you essentially rent 
their name. And by doing that, you 
create a loophole that allows you to 
avoid the State laws that have been 
put in place to protect against this 
kind of predatory lending. And we are 
seeing that now emerge like wildfire 
around the country. 
I do want to be clear, there are many 
innovative fintech partnerships. These 
are lenders who use the internet. There 
are many who are not exhibiting these 
kind of predatory behaviors. And we 
should craft a rule that allows legiti-
mate lending consistent with State 
laws through those fintech practices. 
But the way this rule was written 
during the Trump administration, it 
opens the door to all the bad actors. It 
opens the door wide to the predatory 
lenders to exploit this loophole. 
And that is why we are on the floor 
today, because this resolution is de-
signed to stop the predatory lending 
practices that were unleashed by the 
OCC rule. It is to shut the door on that 
Trump administration OCC rule that 
now has allowed predatory lenders to 
rush through it. 
And what we are seeing now are rates 
of 100 percent, 200 percent—whatever 
they want. I mean, the sky is the limit. 
Some of these interest rates would 
make loan sharks blush. 
So we just saw, in fact, one OCC-reg-
ulated bank that has been helping a 
short-term lending company pilot an 
online ‘‘rent-a-bank’’ installment loan 
program that runs at 179-percent APR. 
And the OCC rule is being litigated in 
court right now to defend a $67,000 loan 
to a restaurant owner at a 268-percent 
APR rate that violates the State law 
where that restaurant is. 
So this is a perfect example of where 
a small restaurant owner took out a 
loan—$67,000—deceptively 
portrayed, 
only to discover that it was 268 percent 
APR. And when the restaurant owner 
says, ‘‘Wait a minute, I thought the 
limit in our State was 36 percent,’’ all 
of a sudden they discover that the 
Trump OCC opened the door to this 
end-run against their State law protec-
tions. 
That is why we have State attorneys 
general from red States and blue 
States, from Nebraska and North Caro-
lina, who have called these ‘‘rent-a- 
bank’’ schemes a ‘‘sham’’ and urged us 
to act. They wrote to us here in the 
Senate, saying: 
The most efficient course to prevent unre-
strained abuse and avert immediate and on-
going consumer harm would be for Congress 
to invalidate the [True Lender] Rule pursu-
ant to its remedial oversight powers under 
the Congressional Review Act. 
That is what we will be voting on 
soon. North Carolina’s attorney gen-
eral, Josh Stein, just also said in a sep-
arate statement: 
We need every tool at our disposal to up-
hold state law and stop [predatory lenders] 
from coming back into our state[s]. 
I hope that we will act right now to 
stop what is a rush by many of these 
predatory lenders to exploit the open-
ing created by the Trump administra-
tion’s OCC. Then let’s take a pause. 
Let’s take time to craft a proper rule 
that allows legitimate lenders to make 
loans in ways that do not violate the 
State protections for the consumers 
and do not, at the end of the day, 
wreak havoc with families who get 
sucked 
into 
unsuspecting 
terms 
through deceptive practices. So I urge 
the U.S. Senate to vote to pass this 
resolution to protect consumers around 
the country. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, if I 
could just actually say one more thing, 
this has been something that the Bank-
ing, Housing, and Urban Affairs Com-
mittee has been working on. We held a 
number of hearings on this. And I do 
just want to thank my friend and col-
league, the chairman of that com-
mittee, Senator BROWN from Ohio, who 
has been a stalwart in protecting con-
sumers. I don’t know if he has been to 
the floor yet, but I just wanted to 
thank him and other members of the 
committee for their efforts and also 
thank the Biden administration, which 
just sent down a statement of adminis-
tration support for overturning the 
OCC rule and for voting in favor of this 
resolution. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
Mrs. LUMMIS. Mr. President, when I 
joined the Senate Banking Committee 
last February, I pledged to fairly exam-
ine every issue that came before us, 
with an eye for detail and a fresh per-
spective—promoting innovation, free 
markets, and our dual banking system. 
I support the policy goals of the true 
lender rule in promoting access to 
credit for underserved communities. I 
also recognize how vital it is to provide 
legal clarity to financial technology 
innovators during this time of change. 
I support all banks’ powers, both State 
and national, to export interest rates 
across State lines and to make unas-
signed loans with clear regulatory cer-
tainty. Again, this promotes access to 
credit. 
The issues raised by the Office of the 
Comptroller of the Currency’s true 
lender rule and S.J. Res. 15, however, 
are not limited to ensuring access to 
credit or protecting consumers from 
predatory lending and have much larg-
er implications for our banking sys-
tem. 
State-chartered banks have existed 
since the founding of our Republic. 
After the passage of the National Bank 
Act of 1864, our country fostered a dual 
banking system, and our country is all 
the stronger for it. The United States 
is the leader of the global financial sys-
tem because we have a banking system 
that is based on competitive equality, 
flexibility, and innovation. 
Under the Federal laws that protect 
our dual banking system, State and na-
tionally chartered depository institu-
tions have nearly identical powers to 
carry out the business of banking 
across State lines with legal clarity. 
This is because of State parity and the 
so-called State wild card laws, the Rie-
gle-Neal Act, and subsequent amend-
ments over the years. The Federal Re-
serve and the FDIC have broadly sup-
ported these policies as well, adopting 
rules that promote equality for State 
banks vis-a`-vis national banks. 
Esther George, President of the Kan-
sas City Fed, noted in a 2012 speech 
that ‘‘the dual banking system has pro-
vided and continues to offer significant 
benefits to our financial system and 
economy . . . multiple options for state 
and federal charters have led to consid-
erable innovation and improvement in 
banking services.’’ 
So Congress and our Federal bank su-
pervisors, on a roundly bipartisan 
basis, have always been committed to 
maintaining parity between State and 
nationally chartered institutions. 
This brings us to today’s vote. The 
problem with the true lender rule be-
fore us is that it has the potential to 
upend parity between State and na-
tional banks. In a nutshell, the OCC 
true lender rule determines which 
banks or other financial institutions 
actually make a consumer loan. Many 
States have different legal standards 
for determining this. Ultimately, this 
would allow national banks to make 
and assign loans more easily than 
State-chartered banks, giving them a 
distinct advantage in the lending busi-
ness. 
The Board of Governors of the Fed-
eral Reserve and the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation did not adopt 
companions to the OCC true lender 
rule. It is likely those Agencies do not 
have the legal authority to adopt a 
similar rule for State banks. The FDIC 
confirmed this during public remarks 
in December 2020. Consequently, we are 
left with a scenario where national 
banks and Federal savings associations 
have a great deal of legal clarity about 
marketplace lending and State-char-
tered banks do not.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2438 
May 11, 2021 
Why does this matter? There are ap-
proximately 
3,954 
State-chartered 
banks in our country as of December. 
There are approximately 1,062 national 
banks and Federal savings associations 
that are depository institutions. That 
means that of the approximately 5,016 
commercial banks in our dual banking 
system, about 79 percent are State 
banks and 21 percent are national 
banks and Federal savings institutions. 
The OCC true lender rule applies to 
only 21 percent of the banks in our 
country. Does a rule that applies to 
only 21 percent of the banks really pro-
mote parity between State and nation-
ally chartered institutions? This chart 
shows plain as day that it does not. 
Moreover, State-chartered banks are 
the primary banks currently engaged 
in the kind of marketplace lending en-
visioned by the OCC true lender rule. 
Many State banks have innovative and 
thriving partnerships with nonbank 
lenders today. The OCC true lender 
rule will cause those partnerships to 
shift to national banks. Why would a 
nonbank lender choose to partner with 
a State bank that lacks the legal clar-
ity of a national bank or savings asso-
ciation and the preemption that fol-
lows Federal law? I do not believe they 
will. There would be a great deal of 
legal uncertainty for them because of 
State consumer protection laws. Many 
of the State bank partnerships we see 
today in the marketplace lending arena 
may disappear as the nonbank lenders 
naturally gravitate towards the great-
er legal clarity of national banks. 
This rule, in effect, would make these 
innovative partnerships the domain of 
national banks, rendering State-char-
tered banks to be more like second- 
class institutions. That has not been 
the will of Congress in the past, and I 
don’t believe it is today. 
A prominent law firm noted in Janu-
ary of this year that ‘‘for institutions 
that participate in marketplace lend-
ing, most of which are state-chartered 
banks, the lack of an FDIC rule creates 
a significant exception to the federal 
support for the marketplace lending 
model and appears to largely leave the 
issue to the states.’’ 
Many wonder why States cannot 
adopt their own true lender rules on a 
State-by-State basis or adopt some 
kind of uniform law. This likely will 
not work for a number of reasons. 
First, were a State like Wyoming to 
adopt its own true lender rule for its 
own banks, what would require another 
State to respect the Wyoming true 
lender rule and set aside its own con-
sumer protection laws that conflict 
with the Wyoming law? It likely would 
not, and that State would likely re-
quire a Wyoming bank without a 
branch in that State to abide by its 
own consumer protection laws in doing 
business there. This is a basic tenet of 
States maintaining sovereignty within 
their own borders, limited only by the 
U.S. Constitution and Federal law. 
Secondly, a uniform law adopted at 
the State level would likely take 3 to 5 
years, and by that time, marketplace 
lending would firmly be the province of 
nationally 
chartered 
institutions. 
There would then be no need for the 
law. 
So where does that leave our dual 
banking system? The OCC true lender 
rule clarifies a thorny legal question 
and restricts the application of State 
consumer protection laws, providing 
legal clarity in marketplace lending to 
21 percent of the banks in this country, 
while essentially telling the other 79 
percent that they should convert to a 
national charter or risk being left be-
hind. That is the kind of choice Con-
gress has rejected in the past. 
Many question the value of using the 
Congressional Review Act against the 
true lender rule since it will prevent 
the OCC from adopting a similar rule 
in the future. However, again, both the 
FDIC and the Federal Reserve likely do 
not have the requisite statutory au-
thority to adopt their own true lender 
rule anyway. As a result, there is no 
rule or Agency-based solution that 
fixes this problem in a satisfactory 
way. 
For the true lender rule to apply 
equally to all State and national 
banks, Congress must act. Leaving the 
OCC true lender rule in place would re-
duce the likelihood of Congress fixing 
the issue. Disapproving this rule will 
ensure that this issue remains top-of- 
mind for many and can be fixed in a 
lasting way that ensures a level play-
ing field. This is a classic example of 
an issue crying out for a uniform na-
tional standard enacted by Congress, 
which applies to all banks. 
The United States is the leader of the 
global financial system for many rea-
sons, but one of those is surely the in-
novation, competition, and diversity of 
thought brought about by our dual 
banking system. This is a privilege, not 
a right, however, and one must work 
hard to maintain that for future gen-
erations. 
I am proud to be a vocal advocate of 
financial innovation in this Chamber, 
and I will continue to work hard to-
wards modernizing our financial sys-
tem in a responsible manner. However, 
for innovation to be truly lasting, it 
has to be built on a solid foundation 
and not pick winners and losers be-
tween national banks and State banks. 
Only Congress can truly fix this 
issue. I look forward to working with 
my colleagues to accomplish this. In 
the coming days, I will be introducing 
legislation to do just that. Until this is 
fixed, the current ‘‘valid when made’’ 
rule will continue to provide legal clar-
ity to Federal and State banks. 
I urge my colleagues to thoughtfully 
consider the potential impact of the 
OCC true lender rule on State-char-
tered banks. 
In order to preserve our dual banking 
system and Congress’s past actions to 
ensure parity between State and na-
tionally chartered banks, I do not have 
any other option but to support S.J. 
Res. 15. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MAR-
KEY). The Senator from Ohio. 
NATIONAL POLICE WEEK 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, this is 
National Police Week. It is a time 
every year when we stop to pay tribute 
to our law enforcement officers around 
the country, the men and women in 
blue who serve us every day in my 
State of Ohio and every State rep-
resented in this Chamber. 
We also remember the brave law en-
forcement officers who tragically died 
in the line of duty. We can never forget 
this is a dangerous profession. The Na-
tional Law Enforcement Memorial and 
Museum reported that 2020 was the 
deadliest year for law enforcement in 
decades. In Ohio alone, we sadly lost 
six brave law enforcement officers over 
the past year. Here in the Capitol, of 
course, we lost three officers over the 
past year, including on January 6. In 
the course of our Nation’s history, 
more than 24,000 officers have died in 
the line of duty. 
I was proud to join colleagues in 
March in sponsoring legislation called 
the Protect and Serve Act, which 
would create Federal penalties on 
those who would attempt to harm or 
kill a police officer. I believe Protect 
and Serve would send a strong message 
to help deter these crimes. Ultimately, 
I think it would make our men and 
women in blue safer and help save 
lives. 
This week, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in standing with the families of 
our fallen police officers and thanking 
them and thanking law enforcement 
for what they do every day to protect 
us. One way to express our gratitude is 
passing laws that will assist them in 
their critical work to keep us safe. 
OPIOID EPIDEMIC 
With that in mind, I am also on the 
floor today to call on my colleagues to 
support our law enforcement by taking 
decisive action to help them to keep 
some of the deadliest drugs in the 
world from coming into our commu-
nities. It is not an overstatement to 
say that this is a matter of life or 
death. 
Overdose deaths in the United States 
have sadly reached a record high dur-
ing the COVID–19 pandemic. According 
to recent data from the Centers for 
Disease Control, 87,000 Americans died 
during the 12-month period between 
September 2019 and September 2020, the 
most recent data we have. This can be 
directly 
attributed 
to 
the 
cir-
cumstances surrounding the pandemic. 
So many families are feeling the pain 
of these losses. Sadly, based on the cur-
rent trends, we expect calendar year 
2020 in full to be even worse. 
What is the main driver of these 
overdoses and overdose deaths? Syn-
thetic opioids, most notably fentanyl. 
Fentanyl is 50 times more powerful 
than heroin, relatively inexpensive, 
deadly, and incredibly addictive. For 
years, this has been coming to our 
shores from China, first predominantly

S2439 
May 11, 2021 
through our mail system, and with our 
new legislation in place to prevent that 
from happening, much of it is now com-
ing in through Mexico. In 2019, there 
were 70,630 deaths from opioids and 
other drugs, and more than half of 
those—36,359—involved fentanyl, some-
times mixed with other drugs like co-
caine and crystal meth or heroin. 
Again, of all the poisons, fentanyl is 
the most deadly. It does have a medical 
purpose and can be used to treat pa-
tients in severe pain the same way 
morphine is used. 
Both fentanyl and morphine are clas-
sified under schedule II by the drug en-
forcement authorities. In order to 
avoid prosecution under that sched-
uling order, drug traffickers started 
making 
slight 
modifications 
to 
fentanyl, 
creating 
what 
we 
call 
fentanyl analogs or fentanyl-related 
substances, 
essentially 
copycat 
fentanyl. 
Evil scientists in places like China, 
Mexico, and India, working in unregu-
lated pharmaceutical plants, will make 
a 
slight 
modification 
to 
fentanyl, 
sometimes adjusting a single molecule, 
to create what are, essentially, these 
fentanyl copycats. 
While these copycats may have the 
same narcotic properties as fentanyl, 
these tiny variations allow these traf-
fickers to evade prosecution. 
Oftentimes, 
by 
the 
way, 
these 
fentanyl-related 
substitutes, 
these 
copycats, are even more powerful than 
fentanyl itself. Take, for example, 
carfentanil. 
These 
fentanyl-related 
substances 
are the reason I am on the floor today. 
In 2018—2018—in recognition of the 
growing threat these copycats posed to 
our public health, the DEA temporarily 
scheduled fentanyl-related substances 
as schedule I, the highest designation 
they can give. 
Since then, we have passed two tem-
porary extensions of that designation. 
Most recently, Congress passed a 5- 
month extension just ahead of the pre-
vious deadline of May 6, just a couple 
weeks ago, and President Biden signed 
that legislation into law last week. 
I supported that temporary extension 
because the alternative was worse. The 
only alternative was to let these sub-
stances become legal. But I don’t think 
kicking the can down the road for an-
other 5 months is nearly enough to 
safeguard against the threat of copycat 
fentanyl. We need to do much more be-
tween now and when this temporary 
scheduling extension expires in Octo-
ber. 
Law enforcement needs certainty, 
and the drug cartels and those evil sci-
entists need to know we are serious in 
addressing this problem, that there 
will be consequences. 
We need a permanent solution. Spe-
cifically, let’s pass bipartisan legisla-
tion I introduced with my colleague 
Senator 
MANCHIN
called 
FIGHT 
Fentanyl, which simply says: Let’s not 
allow these illicitly manufactured and 
deadly synthetic opioids to suddenly 
become legal again. That is what law 
enforcement wants. That is what our 
communities demand. That is what we 
deserve to give them. It is long overdue 
that we make this designation perma-
nent. 
I know some of my colleagues oppose 
permanent scheduling of these fentanyl 
drugs 
because 
they 
are 
concerned 
about mandatory minimum sentences, 
and also that it could hinder research 
into future medications to treat addic-
tion. Let me address both of those 
quickly. 
First, there is this concern about the 
harsh punishments that don’t fit the 
nature of the crime. I share that con-
cern. That is why our legislation en-
sures that mandatory minimum sen-
tences are not automatically imposed 
in any criminal case. We want the 
judge to look at the severity of the 
crime and consider all relevant factors 
in sentencing. So that issue has been 
addressed in our bipartisan legislation. 
There has been a great deal of con-
versation about the impact of prosecu-
tions and incarcerations on specific 
populations, including minority com-
munities. What is often lost in this de-
bate, I will say, is the growing impact 
of fatal overdoses in those same com-
munities. Since 2016, while White fa-
talities have decreased through the pe-
riod of 2019, the data we have shows 
that overdoses from opioids among 
Black Americans, particularly Black 
men, have actually gotten worse, not 
better. 
From 2011 to 2016, that same time pe-
riod, when White overdoses and deaths 
were reduced, Black Americans had the 
highest increase in synthetic opioid-in-
volved overdose deaths, compared to 
all populations. 
And while in 2017 to 2018 overall 
opioid-involved overdose fatalities de-
creased by just over 4 percent, rates 
among Black and Hispanic Americans 
actually increased. This is an issue we 
must address here. 
Another issue my colleagues have 
raised, again, is concern that perma-
nently scheduling fentanyl and its ana-
logues somehow hinders research into 
treating addiction. First of all, I agree 
we need this research. We need it 
badly. One example of this is coming 
up with naloxone, a miracle drug based 
on heroin that actually reverses the ef-
fects of an overdose. 
I spoke to the scientist, Roger Crys-
tal, just last week, who developed the 
nasal version of this naloxone. It is a 
miracle. I have seen it work, and it 
saves lives. 
Researchers have told me there are 
barriers to being approved to legally 
research schedule I substances. There 
is also a stigma to conducting this 
kind of research, even though we know 
that it could lead to the development 
of new treatments. But this is some-
thing we can easily address by allowing 
qualified researchers the ability to 
study fentanyl analogues under sched-
ule II as opposed to schedule I. So we 
can address that issue. 
I am open to working with my col-
leagues to address these barriers, and I 
believe that we can do that through 
the legislation creating flexibility in 
the registration system for scientists. 
But I would urge my colleagues that 
we need to use the next 5 months to do 
the hard work of finding a permanent 
solution to this crisis before we have to 
once again run the risk of letting these 
drugs become legal and the message 
that that sends and the deaths that 
would occur as a result. The U.S. Sen-
ate can take the lead and permanently 
classify these dangerous narcotics that 
are literally killing tens of thousands 
of our fellow citizens every year. In-
stead of kicking the can down the road 
again for 5 months from now, let’s 
make it permanent. The House and the 
Biden administration should support 
this effort. Lives are at stake. 
It is important that we continue to 
focus this body, as we have, on the de-
mand side of this equation—preven-
tion, treatment, longer term recovery 
for fentanyl and for other substances. 
But it is also important that we not 
allow these substances to come on the 
streets at lower and lower costs and at 
greater and greater volumes. That is 
what would happen if we do not move 
as a Congress to ensure that these 
fentanyl copycats and fentanyl itself 
remain illicit drugs, as they are. 
Let’s do the right thing for our com-
munity. Let’s do the right thing for 
law enforcement. Let’s be sure they 
have the predictability and certainty 
in law enforcement to know that these 
criminals can be prosecuted, these traf-
fickers. 
We need to act now to address the 
threat of these deadly fentanyl drugs 
coming into our communities. I urge 
the Senate to pass the FIGHT Fentanyl 
bill. Join us in this effort so we can 
better work to reverse the tragic rise 
in overdose deaths around the United 
States of America. 
I yield the floor. 
S.J. RES. 15 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I come 
to the floor today in support of the 
Congressional Review Act resolution to 
rescind the Office of the Comptroller of 
the Currency’s ‘‘True Lender Rule.’’ 
This rule was rushed through by the 
previous administration with complete 
disregard to the harm it would cause 
already struggling working Americans. 
The true lender rule undercuts im-
portant consumer protections at the 
State level and greenlights high-cost 
‘‘rent-a-bank’’ schemes. These schemes 
let predatory lenders evade State inter-
est rate caps by funneling high-interest 
loans—loans that are illegal under 
State law—-through national banks. 
We know these lenders prey upon 
those struggling to make ends meet 
and are more likely to operate in areas 
with higher concentrations of poverty. 
And they offer complicated loans that 
are designed to trap consumers in an 
endless cycle of debilitating debt. 
What is especially troubling is that 
this rule was finalized in November of

S2440 
May 11, 2021 
last year at a time when so many were 
reeling from an unprecedented public 
health and economic crisis. And while 
so many American families struggle to 
put food on the table and make their 
rent or mortgage payments, the OCC’s 
rule makes it easier for predatory lend-
ers to prey on those most vulnerable, 
exacerbating the economic hardship of 
millions. 
Currently, 45 States and the District 
of Columbia have instituted interest 
rate caps on installment loans to pro-
tect consumers. Earlier this year, my 
home State of Illinois passed into law a 
36-percent cap on interest rates for 
consumer loans. These protections are 
essential to ensuring that hard-work-
ing Americans are not exploited. 
The true lender rule would allow 
predatory lenders to evade these im-
portant State-level consumer protec-
tions. Twenty-five State attorneys gen-
eral, including Illinois Attorney Gen-
eral Kwame Raoul, recently wrote to 
me and my colleagues to underscore 
the dangers of the OCC’s true lending 
rule. They say in their letter, ‘‘The 
OCC’s Rule would be exploited by lend-
ers seeking to circumvent these state 
interest-rate caps and invite, indeed 
welcome, predatory consumer-lending 
partnerships . . .’’ 
I agree with the concerns raised by 
Attorney General Raoul and his coun-
terparts. 
The 
Federal 
Government 
should be doing more to protect the fi-
nancial security of Americans, not less. 
Congress needs to take action—now 
more than ever—to protect working 
families from predatory lending prac-
tices. We must rescind this harmful 
true lender rule. However, addressing 
the harm of this rule is not enough. 
More must be done to protect vulner-
able American consumers. For more 
than a decade, I have pushed for a Fed-
eral interest rate cap of 36 percent on 
all consumer loans. This standard is 
not radical or new. The Federal Gov-
ernment already affords similar protec-
tions to military servicemembers and 
their families. We should expand those 
protections to all Americans. 
COVID–19 has devastated the lives of 
millions of Americans and brought sig-
nificant economic challenges to so 
many households. We need to be pro-
tecting the most vulnerable popu-
lations who are just trying to get back 
to normal and get a fair shot at the 
American dream. 
Let’s come together on a common 
goal: to protect American consumers 
from predatory lending practices. Pass-
ing today’s CRA resolution would bring 
us one step closer to that goal. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, the vote 
we are about to take on this Van Hol-
len resolution, S.J. Res. 15, is a bipar-
tisan opportunity for us to show people 
whom we serve that we are on their 
side. 
States all over the country—red and 
blue States, States in the South and 
Midwest, on both coasts—have all rec-
ognized that people need protections 
from predatory lenders. That is why 
nearly every State and the District of 
Columbia have passed laws to limit, to 
cap the interest—the amount of inter-
est—that can be charged on payday and 
other loans. 
In the late 1990s, payday lenders were 
desperate to find a way to evade State 
laws that limited them from charging 
exorbitant interest rates that trap peo-
ple in a cycle of debt they can’t get out 
of, no matter how hard they work. 
They came up with what the Comp-
troller of the Currency called ‘‘rent-a- 
charter’’—what we now know as a 
‘‘rent-a-bank’’ scheme. 
Because banks are generally not sub-
ject to these State laws, payday lend-
ers funneled their loans through a 
small number of willing banks. It 
looked like the banks were making the 
loans, when it was really the payday 
lenders. 
Federal regulators in both parties— 
Republicans 
and 
Democrats—saw 
through this very obvious ruse that 
hurt 
low-income 
people 
who 
were 
forced to get credit any way they 
could. 
Federal 
regulators 
cracked 
down. Under both President Bush and 
President Obama, the Office of Comp-
troller of the Currency and the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation—OCC 
and FDIC—shut down a series of these 
schemes by payday lenders and banks. 
States from across the country also 
stepped in to protect their residents. 
Georgia, West Virginia, my State of 
Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Mary-
land, Montana, South Dakota, Colo-
rado, Illinois, Virginia, and Nebraska 
all passed new laws and regulations ei-
ther to stop these schemes or to cap in-
terest rates on payday loans at 36 per-
cent—still a very, very high number 
that most of us never pay, but that 
people who can only get credit that 
way end up paying, unfortunately. It is 
still a high number that, obviously, 
will make any company making these 
loans plenty of money. 
Several other States, including Cali-
fornia and Ohio, also passed laws to 
limit the interest that can be charged 
on consumer loans. These new laws 
passed with overwhelming bipartisan 
support. 
Now, get this: More than 75 percent 
of voters in Nebraska and South Da-
kota supported the ballot initiatives to 
cap interest rates on payday loans. So 
three-fourths of the voters going to the 
polls in a popular vote wanted to cap 
interest rates on payday loans in those 
two States. 
In recent years, new financial tech-
nology companies emerged that part-
ner with banks to offer responsible 
small-dollar loans at more affordable 
rates. 
But we also have a separate group of 
online payday lenders resurrecting the 
same old rent-a-bank scheme to offer 
abusive, high-interest loans. They are 
not even attempting to hide it. 
One online lender told its investors it 
would get around California’s new law 
by making loans—these were their 
words, this lender’s—through ‘‘bank 
sponsors . . . not subject to the same 
proposed state level rate limitations.’’ 
So he or she is even acknowledging 
that States—voters or State legisla-
tures or both—are saying: We want to 
cap those interest rates so people don’t 
take out a small loan and end up pay-
ing 200, 300 percent after these payday 
lenders put that on them. 
Another lender said: ‘‘There is no 
reason why we wouldn’t be able to re-
place our California business with a 
bank program.’’ 
So they know what they have to do. 
They know they are going against the 
intent of the legislature and the intent 
of the voters. 
Given the broad bipartisan support 
for these laws, we had hoped that the 
Trump OCC would take action and 
crack down on these schemes, the same 
way that Bush and Obama had done— 
schemes that have been rejected by 
voters and legislatures over and over, 
in State after State after State. 
But last year, the OCC issued what is 
known as the true lender rule, over-
ruling voters of both parties, giving es-
sentially a free pass to these abusive 
rent-a-bank schemes. 
Now, to fight back on behalf of low- 
income people and on behalf of fair 
play, a broad bipartisan coalition is 
asking Congress to overturn the OCC’s 
harmful true lender rule. 
That support includes credit unions, 
State 
bank 
regulators—Republicans 
and Democrats alike—and State attor-
neys general of both parties. One of the 
most outspoken has been the Repub-
lican attorney general of Nebraska, be-
cause his State passed—his State’s vot-
ers passed—a limit, 75 percent of them, 
to keep interest rates down. 
There is support from small business 
groups, support from the Military Offi-
cers Association of America. 
We know that payday lenders espe-
cially prey on young members of the 
military. One of them may be off in a 
foreign country while the spouse stays 
back at the base or stays back in a 
community and is struggling with just 
having the resources to get by. They 
are preyed upon so often. 
Other groups are the National Asso-
ciation of Evangelicals, the Southern 
Baptist Convention, and other mem-
bers of the Faith in Just Lending Coa-
lition. 
That coalition wrote to Congress: 
Predatory payday and auto title lenders 
are notorious for exploiting loopholes in 
order to offer debt-trap loans to families 
struggling to make ends meet. The OCC’s 
‘‘True Lender’’ rule creates a loophole big 
enough to drive a truck through. 
That came from this coalition—the 
coalition of attorneys general, the 
Military Officers Association, the Na-
tional Association of Evangelicals, and 
the Southern Baptist Convention. They 
are saying the OCC’s true lender rule 
creates a loophole big enough to drive 
a truck through.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2441 
May 11, 2021 
We know why these commonsense 
laws that our States passed are pop-
ular. We know why they enjoy bipar-
tisan support in States across the 
country. People don’t want abusive 
lenders to prey on them, their loved 
ones or their neighbors. 
Some issues that come before the 
Senate are complicated. They divide 
people. There are thorny nuances to 
consider. This isn’t one of them. It is 
simple. Let’s protect the people whom 
we serve. They have clearly cried out 
for us to do this. We should protect 
those people. 
I urge my colleagues to support S.J. 
Res. 15 to overturn this rule. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. First, let me thank 
our chair of the Banking Committee, 
someone who has fought against the 
abuses in the financial services indus-
try throughout his career, Senator 
BROWN. Let me also thank Senator VAN 
HOLLEN, who, again, has been one of 
those leaders doing great things to help 
people who are often taken advantage 
of. 
Now, for millions of working Ameri-
cans, one of the most dangerous things 
that can happen is falling victim to 
predatory lenders. Unscrupulous actors 
have always promised quick cash or 
credit to people with unexpected ex-
penses or financial difficulties, only to 
trap them with crippling interest rates 
that can erase a person’s life savings or 
even claim their homes. They are in 
trouble. They reach out to the lifeline, 
and the lifeline is a trap. Often they 
are trapped for years and even some for 
their whole lives. 
That is why more than 40 States have 
passed laws that prohibit this behavior 
and placed limits on interest rates 
made by nonbank lenders. It runs the 
gamut from liberal California to con-
servative Texas. 
Inexplicably—inexplicably—the 
Trump administration decided to give 
these predatory lenders a massive loop-
hole to circumvent State law and once 
again prey on low-income Americans. 
Under 
the 
Trump 
administration’s 
rule, so long as payday lenders found a 
bank to provide the cash upfront and 
attach their name to the transaction, 
interest rates in the triple digits were 
suddenly OK, even if the States explic-
itly banned it. 
It is despicable and so typical of the 
Trump 
administration 
not 
caring 
about average folks at all and just lis-
tening to the special interests. It had 
devastating consequences for working 
families and for small businesses. 
In New York, the owner of a southern 
food restaurant in Harlem took out a 
$67,000 loan from a fraudulent lender to 
make renovations to their restaurant. 
They fell behind on payments and tried 
to work with their lender when COVID 
hit and realized that their loan had an 
APR of 268 percent. Rather than work 
toward a solution, the lender went to 
the bank to try and foreclose on their 
property—their property in which they 
had put blood and sweat and tears— 
stating that the Trump rule gave them 
the grounds to do so. It mattered little 
that New York State law had a 268-per-
cent interest rate as blatantly illegal. 
So today’s vote is simple. It would 
revoke the Trump administration’s so- 
called true lender rule that permits 
predatory lenders to exploit small busi-
nesses and working Americans. In the 
middle of a pandemic, the last thing we 
should be doing is perpetrating a rule 
that makes it easier for payday lenders 
to scam working people and business 
owners. 
With today’s vote, the Senate stands 
up for working families and small busi-
nesses all across the country by repeal-
ing this terrible, essentially Scrooge- 
like rule pushed by former President 
Trump and his allies. 
And one final point for those who say 
elections don’t make a difference. Just 
look at this. Here was a rule protecting 
people—States protected people. The 
Trump administration comes in and 
rips away those protections, leaving so 
many people bare and defenseless be-
cause they were desperate; they need 
the money. 
Elections occur. A new Democratic 
President, a Democratic Senate, and 
this horrible, horrible rule change by 
the Trump administration is undone. 
We go back to giving some help and 
protection to working families and 
small business people. 
This story could be repeated not just 
with CRAs but up and down the line— 
up and down the line. Elections do 
make a difference, and today’s vote 
shows one of many examples.

Mr. SCHUMER. Let me first com-

May 11, 2021 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, for 
the information of all Senators, we ex-
pect a vote on the motion to discharge 
to 
occur 
around 
noon 
tomorrow, 
Wednesday, May 12. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
S.J. RES. 15 
Mr. BROWN. I thank my colleagues 
for their vote on this resolution, which 
was so important to protect people 
from being abused by payday lenders. 
S.J. Res. 15 will be a big deal, saving a 
lot of money for a lot of low-income 
people who have been fleeced far too 
many times. 
I thank the leader. I thank, in my of-
fice, 
Laura 
Swanson 
and 
Jan 
Singelmann for their terrific work in 
making sure that everybody was here 
and everybody was learned on this 
issue so well and how important that 
was for our State and for our country. 
I thank them. 
NATIONAL POLICE WEEK 
Mr. President, each year during Po-
lice Week, we honor the law enforce-
ment officers who made the ultimate 
sacrifice in service to their commu-
nities. 
This year, we add the names of four 
Ohioans to the National Law Enforce-
ment Memorial who laid down their 
lives last year: Corporal Adam McMil-
lan of Hamilton County Sheriff’s Of-
fice, 
Detective 
James 
Michael 
Skernivitz of Cleveland, Patrolman 
Anthony Hussein Dia of Toledo, and Of-
ficer Kaia Grant of Springdale. 
Sadly, we already know of two names 
who will be added to the memorial next 
year: Officer Brandon Stalker of the 
Toledo Police Department and Jason 
Lagore, who worked for the Ohio De-
partment of Natural Resources. Each 
one of these losses is a tragedy for a 
family, for a community, and for their 
fellow officers. 
Ms. Grant’s mother, I know, and I 
talked to her about how tragic this is 
for her, for her family, and for the fam-
ilies of all of these officers who gave 
their lives in service to others. 
Over the past year, we have had 
many reminders of the work that must 
be done to reform and reimagine public 
safety and to rebuild trust between law 
enforcement and communities. These 
Ohioans’ lives are a reminder of the 
ideals we should strive for—officers 
who are true public servants in the 
best sense of the word, people who gave 
themselves to their communities. And 
these Ohioans gave so much. 
Officer Anthony Dia was the father of 
two young sons. He married his high 
school sweetheart. In a letter he wrote 
to his family during Ramadan, the de-
vout Muslim wrote: 
Every day I put on the uniform, it is with 
the intention to protect the innocent and the 
weak in my community. 
The imam who spoke at his memorial 
service said: 
When you think of Islam, think of this 
man who gave his life on the Fourth of July 
to defend the values of the United States. 
Detective James Skernivitz served 
my city of Cleveland. He served in 
neighborhood policing districts, and in 
2013, he joined the Gang Impact Unit, 
working to reduce violence in Cleve-
land. He was a devoted father and 
played softball for many years, trav-
eling to tournaments with the Steel 
City Enforcers. 
Corporal Adam McMillan spent 19 
years serving the public at the sheriff’s 
office in Hamilton County, Cincinnati. 
So many in his community spoke 
about his kindness. His pastor said at 
the memorial service that ‘‘he was the 
kind of guy who asked the person in 
the drive-thru window how their day 
was going.’’ His generous spirit will 
live on. Corporal McMillan was an 
organ donor, and his loss is giving new 
life to someone else. 
Kaia Grant was in the Reserve Offi-
cer Training Corps in college. After 
graduating and working with at-risk 
kids in Cincinnati, she joined the 
Springdale Police Department. Her co-
worker said: 
Instead of going into the military and then 
going into politics, like many do, she wanted 
to serve the community. 
Another colleague related a story 
about how she saved a woman’s life. 
The department got a call about a per-
son considering taking her own life, 
and they searched and searched but 
found no one. They were close to giving 
up, but Officer Grant didn’t. She found 
the woman in a parking garage in time 
to save her life. 
As part of her dedication to our coun-
try, Officer Grant interned for a U.S. 
Senator while she was in college. That 
Senator’s name was Joe Biden. Earlier 
this year, on his first trip to Ohio as 
President, Joe Biden met with Officer 
Grant’s mother, Gina Mobley, to thank 
her for her daughter’s service to him, 
to our country, and to her community. 
We can’t begin to repay the debt we 
owe Ms. Mobley and all these families. 
We can work to reform our systems to 
protect more officers and the commu-
nities they swear an oath to protect. 
This week, I am introducing legisla-
tion, the Law Enforcement Training 
for Mental Health Crisis Response Act, 
with Senator INHOFE of Oklahoma. We 
have seen too many Americans, both 
officers and those they serve, hurt or 
killed when law enforcement responds 
to people in their communities suf-
fering a mental health crisis. This bill 
would invest in training to help fami-
lies resolve those situations safely for 
themselves and for their communities. 
They help officers resolve these situa-
tions safely for themselves and for the 
communities they serve. 
Law enforcement officers, reformers, 
and advocates all agree we pushed too 
many problems onto the criminal jus-
tice system, expecting officers to be so-
cial workers and crisis responders and 
family mediators without the proper 
training to fill those roles. 
We need to actually invest in mental 
health and education and other social 
support. We need to give officers the 
training and resources they need to 
help when they are called on to respond 
to these situations. 
This Police Week, let’s offer—many 
of us come to the floor to do this— 
more than empty words. Let’s honor 
the memory of these women and men 
who have laid down their lives in serv-
ice of their community by getting their 
fellow officers the tools and the train-
ing they need to do their jobs and to 
build trust with the communities they 
have sworn to protect.

CENTENNIAL OF MILLS, WYOMING 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise 
today in recognition of the 100th anni-
versary of the incorporation of Mills, 
WY. 
On Saturday, June 12, 2021, the town 
of Mills will honor this milestone with 
a 100th Anniversary Summer Fest Cele-
bration. The event will host a parade, 
concerts, and other festivities through-
out the day. It is an excellent oppor-
tunity for the people of Natrona Coun-
ty and Wyoming to gather and com-
mend the strong, lasting character of 
this community. 
Mills was established in May of 1921 
at a location near the Fort Caspar site 
along the northern banks of the North 
Platte River. Many pioneers traversed 
this area along the Oregon Trail before 
oil was discovered in the Salt Creek 
Field. In 1919, with the growth of the 
oil and gas industry, brothers James, 
William, and Thomas Mills and their 
Mills Construction Company purchased 
a homestead owned by Charles M. 
Hawks. Company employees and their 
families began to settle in the sur-
rounding land. By 1921, over 500 people 
lived in the quickly developing area. A 
need for local organization resulted in 
Mills’ incorporation as a town, becom-
ing the third in Natrona County. 
The story of Mills is a microcosm of 
the story of Natrona County and Cen-
tral Wyoming. The town has navigated 
through the booms and busts of the oil 
industry throughout its century and 
continues to navigate its unique place 
across the river from Casper. Industry 
has always played a large role in the 
development of the community. From 
its beginnings with the Mills Construc-
tion Company, Mills now hosts a wide 
range of manufacturing, fabrication, 
heavy machinery, and oil and gas busi-
nesses. Yet, Mills still maintains its

quaint charm with Oregon Trail his-
toric sites, river recreational opportu-
nities, and local watering holes. 
Mills held its first election on May 
10, 1921. The first mayor was George E. 
Boyle, who was elected alongside new 
Councilmen 
Fred 
Hunter, 
Fred 
Shackleford, G.W. Lindsley, and Mi-
chael Kennedy. A century later, Mills 
is served by Mayor Seth Coleman with 
Councilmembers 
James 
Hollander, 
Darla Ives, Sara McCarthy, and Brad 
Neumiller. They continue their tradi-
tion of public service and stewardship. 
From its incorporation as a town 
with a population of 500, Mills entered 
1990 with over 1,500 residents. Today it 
boasts a population of over 4,000 people 
and is one of the fastest growing com-
munities in Wyoming. On August 4, 
2020, Governor Mark Gordon signed a 
proclamation declaring Mills a ‘‘First- 
Class City.’’ This is another milestone 
to add to the summer celebration. 
It is my honor to commemorate this 
historic milestone for the city of Mills. 
Their centennial celebration is a trib-
ute to generations of determination 
and community. Bobbi joins me and ev-
eryone in Wyoming in our appreciation 
of everything the people of Mills have 
contributed to our great State and Na-
tion. We extend our congratulations as 
we look forward to the next 100 years.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
REMEMBERING DR. SAUL HERTZ 
∑ Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, 
today I rise to recognize Dr. Saul 
Hertz, a pioneer for medical uses of 
radioiodine, RAI. 
The son of Jewish immigrants from 
Poland, Dr. Hertz graduated from Har-
vard Medical School in 1929. While 
serving as director of the Massachu-
setts General Hospital’s thyroid unit, 
he attended a presentation about the 
use of physics in medicine. Inspired by 
the concept, Dr. Hertz worked along-
side Massachusetts Institute of Tech-
nology physicist Dr. Arthur Roberts to 
discover 
the 
potential 
for 
iodine 
radioisotopes in thyroid disease diag-
nosis and treatment. 
On March 31, 1941, after years of ex-
periments, Dr. Hertz administered the 
first therapeutic use of radioiodine to a 
human patient. Never before had hu-
mans been successfully treated with an 
artificially produced radioactive mate-
rial. In 1946, Dr. Hertz was the lead au-
thor of the May issue of the Journal of 
the 
American 
Medical 
Association, 
which featured a 5-year study following 
29 patients he treated through this 
method. Today, medical uses of RAI re-
main the gold standard of targeted pre-
cision oncology. 
Dr. Hertz made a number of other 
outstanding contributions to the med-
ical field. Notably, his research played 
an essential role in the developing field 
of nuclear medicine, which was critical 
during World War II and beyond. In 
1949, he established the first Nuclear 
Medicine Department at the Massachu-
setts Women’s Hospital. 
Dr. Hertz passed away on July 28, 
1950, but his legacy is enduring. Not 
only does his work continue to support 
extraordinary medical work, but his 
memory also encourages other re-
searchers through the Saul Hertz, MD, 
Award. Bestowed by the Society for 
Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Engi-
neering, this eponymous award honors 
individuals 
who 
make 
phenomenal 
strides in the radionuclide therapy 
field. 
Dr. Hertz’s archives are kept in 
Greenwich, CT, offering a rich history 
of research in this critical field and a 
testament to his brilliant, lifesaving 
work. This year, Greenwich, CT, First 
Selectman Fred Camillo issued a proc-
lamation, naming March 31 ‘‘Dr. Saul 
Hertz Nuclear Medicine/Radio Pharma-
ceutical Day.’’ This recognition is a 
tribute to Dr. Hertz’s remarkable leg-
acy and the impact he will forever have 
on this field. 
I applaud his many accomplishments 
and hope my colleagues will join me in 
remembering Dr. Saul Hertz.∑ 
f 
TRIBUTE TO RETA HAMILTON 
∑ Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to recognize a prominent con-
servative leader, Reta Hamilton, for 
her long-standing commitment to serv-
ing and strengthening the Republican 
Party in Arkansas and nationwide. 
Mrs. Hamilton launched her political 
activism career in 1987. In the decades 
since, she has made numerous con-
tributions to mobilize the conservative 
cause—and with great success. Nick-
named ‘‘the Road Warrior’’ since her 
early days, she has driven nearly every 
highway in Arkansas, supporting, en-
couraging, and building county com-
mittees and Republican Women clubs. 
She is a longtime Tusk Club member, 
which denotes her dedication to GOP 
candidates and ideas. 
Mrs. Hamilton’s commitment and 
impact have been widely felt at the 
local level. She served as president of 
the Washington County Republican 
Women in 1989 and more than doubled 
its membership, for which she received 
a newly-created award from the Arkan-
sas Federation of Republican Women as 
well as recognition from the National 
Federation of Republican Women. The 
Washington County Republican Com-
mittee honored her as Republican of 
the Year at its 1989 Lincoln Dinner, 
with Congressman John Paul Hammer-
schmidt participating in the presen-
tation. That year, she was also elected 
as AFRW third vice-president. 
Mrs. Hamilton eventually moved to 
Benton County and in 1994 was elected 
secretary of the Benton County Repub-
lican Party. She later served as a State 
committeewoman and was honored at 
the 1996 Lincoln Dinner as Republican 
of the Year in Rogers, AR. Mrs. Ham-
ilton was elected one of six electors to 
serve both in the 2008 and 2012 electoral 
college. 
During her years of involvement in 
the Republican Party of Arkansas, she 
became second vice chair and was ap-
pointed to the Arkansas Governor’s 
Appointments Committee, as well as a 
serving a record 14 continuous years on 
the Executive Committee of the Ar-
kansas GOP. 
Mrs. Hamilton was appointed by the 
State chairman to serve over 10 years 
on the RPA Rules Committee. A pin-
nacle of her political career came in 
2003, when she was elevated to the posi-
tion of RPA State chairman. During 
this time, she was able to refocus the 
State party and set it on a course to 
majority leadership. Mrs. Hamilton 
was elected Arkansas Republican Na-
tional Committeewoman in 2005 and 
served until term-limited in 2012. She 
also served on the RNC Rules Com-
mittee from 2010 through 2012. 
She was also elected by RPA dele-
gates to serve on the RNC Rules Com-
mittee from 1996 to 2016. Mrs. Hamilton 
was an elected delegate to every Re-
publican National Convention from 
1992 through 2020, serving as a Trump 
delegate in 2016 and 2020. 
At the Reagan Rockefeller Dinner in 
2016, the RPA awarded Mrs. Hamilton 
the ‘‘Hi, I’m Frank White’’ Award for 
making significant contributions to 
build the State party. 
Having been involved with the Na-
tional 
Federation 
of 
Republican 
Women since 1983, Mrs. Hamilton was 
appointed to serve as a nonvoting 
member of the NFRW Board of Direc-
tors in 2000 and served until 2020 as a 
regent and capital regent. She has at-
tended nearly every NFRW biennial 
convention since 1987. Mrs. Hamilton 
was honored with an appointment and 
election to fill the vacancy of national 
committeewoman from December 2020 
to June 5, 2021. 
I am honored to call Reta Hamilton 
my friend, and I am incredibly proud of 
her efforts to elevate and expand the 
Republican Party in Arkansas. Her 
conservative influence on the Arkansas 
GOP and this Nation has made a dif-
ference. The direction of our State and 
growth of the Republican Party into 
the majority party demonstrates the 
power that passion and commitment to 
one’s ideals can have. I hope her exam-
ple will serve as a lesson to future gen-
erations of Arkansans and Republican 
leaders.∑

TRIBUTE TO RYAN TUCKER 
∑ Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, I rise 
today on behalf of Iowans across our 
State to recognize the distinguished 
career, dedication, and lifelong hard 
work of Mr. Ryan G. Tucker as he con-
cludes his time as president of the Iowa 
Funeral Directors Association, IFDA. 
As many who know him will tell you, 
Ryan grew up with a spirited commit-
ment to his community, his family, 
and to others. A native of Sumner, it 
did not take long for Ryan to begin 
working in the trade. As a student at 
North Iowa Area Community College,

May 11, 2021 
Ryan started as an employee at Ful-
lerton Family Funeral Home in Mason 
City. He would go on to study at 
Worsham College of Mortuary Science, 
earning an internship in Fort Dodge 
under a former IFDA president, Scott 
Graham. 
His experiences early on in his career 
have led him to where he is today, as 
co-owner 
of 
Kaiser-Corson 
Funeral 
Home in Waverly, Readlyn, Shell Rock, 
and Denver, serving Iowa families with 
his critical work. 
Ryan assumed his role as president of 
the IFDA at a time unlike any other, 
as the COVID–19 pandemic tragically 
took hold early last year, but, in the 
face of enormous challenges and uncer-
tainty, Ryan displayed steadfast lead-
ership for his colleagues that surely al-
lowed for countless families to find 
comfort in such difficult times. 
Ryan guided the IFDA through the 
pandemic, being especially focused on 
ensuring the hard work of our State’s 
funeral directors could continue with 
safety top of mind. At the pandemic’s 
start, Ryan issued daily briefings to 
IFDA members that became vital. He 
provided information about best prac-
tices, updates on policies and procla-

ing to public health limitations. 
Ryan’s lifetime of work, his dedica-
tion to his craft, and his leadership in 
a uniquely challenging time have all

best, and we thank Ryan for everything

TRIBUTE TO KEN POTTS 
∑ Mr. LEE. Mr. President, today I offer 
my recognition of Mr. Ken Potts for his 
heroic service to our country and con-
gratulate him on his 100th birthday. 
Ken was born on April 15, 1921, in 
Honey Bend, IL. His childhood was 
spent on the family farm during the 
difficult years of the Great Depression. 
Despite the difficulty of the times, the 
Potts family worked earnestly and 
happily to make ends meet. In fact, 
Ken has fond memories of time in his 
boyhood spent hunting small game 
with his slingshot. 
At the onset of WWII, when Ken was 
just 18 years of age, he enlisted in the 
U.S. Navy. Two short years later, he 
was stationed in the South Pacific 
working as a crane operator on the 
largest ship in the Navy’s fleet, the 
USS 
Arizona. 
The 
work 
ethic 
he 
learned as a child, on the family farm, 
earned him great success during his 
military service. 
On December 7, 1941, the Pennsyl-
vania-class battleship was docked at 
Pearl Harbor along with the rest of the 
U.S. Pacific Fleet. Ken was working 
that morning shuttling supplies to the 
Arizona when Japanese torpedo bomb-
ers descended from the sky. One of the 
797–kilogram 
armor-piercing 
bombs 
dropped 
by 
the 
bombers 
exploded 
through the decks of near a supply 
staging area at the front the ship. 
Thinking quickly, Ken risked his life 
in a small boat to pick up dozens of 
sailors stranded in the burning water, 
dropping them off at nearby Ford Is-
land. His heroism saved many. Of the 
survivors of the attack on Pearl Har-
bor, Ken is one of two still alive today. 
Ken was undeterred by the harrowing 
experiences of the attack on Pearl Har-
bor. He remained in the Navy and 
served his country honorably until 
1945. After the war, Ken returned to the 
States and moved to Provo, UT, here 
he has lived with his wife for 54 years. 
Ken Potts embodies the very best at-
tributes of the ‘‘greatest generation’’. 
He is a living testament to American 
bravery, honor, and dignity in defense 
of the American way. I wish him a very 
happy 100th birthday. It is my humble 
privilege to honor him today.∑

RECOGNIZING SPACE TANGO 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, as ranking 
member of the Senate Committee on 
Small Business and Entrepreneurship, 
each week I recognize an outstanding 
Kentucky small business that exempli-
fies the American entrepreneurial spir-
it. This week, it is my privilege to rec-
ognize Space Tango of Lexington, KY, 
as the Senate Small Business of the 
Week. 
Growing up on a family farm outside 
Bardstown, Twyman Clements loved 
building and launching model rockets 
with his three brothers. His passion for 
innovation and engineering led him to 
the University of Kentucky, UK, where 
he earned a BS and MS in mechanical 
engineering. As a graduate student at 
UK, Twyman worked with Kentucky 
Space, a nonprofit consortium of uni-
versities and public and private groups 
supporting space entrepreneurship. At 
the time, Kentucky Space was using 
miniature satellites called cubesats to 
conduct experiments on the Inter-
national Space Station. Realizing the 
need to simplify and reduce the cost of 
spacebased research and development, 
R&D, Twyman founded Space Tango in 
2015. 
Today, Space Tango is a thriving 
small business enabling R&D and man-
ufacturing in zero gravity. Since 2017, 
thanks to a National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration, NASA, Space 
Act Agreement, Space Tango provides 
facilities on the International Space 
Station 
U.S. 
National 
Laboratory. 
Their CubeLabs generate scalable and 
efficient research and manufacturing 
in microgravity. Space Tango has 
worked with several commercial part-
ners, including Anheuser-Busch and 
LambaVision. They regularly partner 
with educational institutions such as 
the University of Florida, University of 
Pennsylvania, and Boston University. 
Over the years, local and national or-
ganizations 
have 
recognized 
Space 
Tango’s 
groundbreaking 
work. 
Twyman was inducted into the Ken-
tucky Entrepreneur Hall of Fame in 
2017, and ranked No. 25 on Fast Com-
pany’s list of the 100 Most Creative 
People 
in 
Business 
in 
2018. 
Jim 
Bridenstine, former NASA Adminis-
trator, visited Space Tango in 2020, 
commending their biomedical research 
and manufacturing capabilities. In ad-
dition to working on projects for var-
ious Federal agencies, Space Tango 
won three NASA Utilization Awards 
for Low Earth Orbit of Biomedical Ap-
plications. 
Looking 
forward, 
Space 
Tango is developing ST–42, an autono-
mous manufacturing facility for ad-
vanced materials and biomedical de-
vices located in Earth’s orbit. 
Notably, Space Tango is committed 
to investing in the next generation of 
innovators, 
scientists, 
and 
entre-
preneurs. Twyman and his colleagues 
regularly host and present at edu-
cational events at Kentucky schools, 
universities, 
and 
scientific 
institu-
tions. Space Tango’s robust internship 
program includes students from Ken-
tucky’s universities and colleges across 
the country, with several former in-
terns joining their team. 
Space Tango is a testament to Ken-
tucky innovation, ingenuity, and in-
dustry. Small businesses like Space 
Tango form a critical part of Ameri-
can’s domestic manufacturing base and 
play a unique role educating the next 
generation of Kentucky engineers and 
entrepreneurs. 
Congratulations 
to 
Twyman and the entire team at Space 
Tango. I wish them the best of luck 
and look forward to watching their 
continued growth and success in Ken-
tucky and beyond.∑

TRIBUTE TO FATHER MICHAEL J. 
GRAHAM 
∑ Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to recognize my friend, Father 
Michael J. Graham, on his retirement 
as the 34th president of Xavier Univer-
sity in my hometown of Cincinnati, 
OH, and to thank him for his more 
than 34 years of service at Xavier help-
ing to cultivate young leaders and de-
veloping Musketeer students with the 
Jesuit values of becoming ‘‘men and 
women for others.’’ 
Father Graham started at Xavier in 
1984 as an assistant history professor. 
After pursuing his master of divinity 
from the Weston School of Theology, 
he returned to Xavier in 1989. He was 
appointed vice president for university 
relations in 1994 and was inaugurated 
president of Xavier University on Sep-
tember 8, 2001. 
Father Graham is the longest serving 
president in Xavier University’s his-
tory, and over the past 20 years, he has 
had an incredible impact on the univer-
sity, the Cincinnati community, and 
the more than 30,000 students who have

graduated from Xavier University dur-
ing his tenure. He has helped raise over 
$500 million to fund scholarships, ad-
vance the academic experience, support 
community projects, and advance the 
development of the university. 
In the community, Father Graham’s 
passion to connect and collaborate 
with local and regional communities 
inspired him to establish the Commu-
nity Building Institute as well as the 
Eigel Center for Community Engage-
ment at Xavier. In 2017, Father Gra-
ham was asked to chair the Cincinnati 
Preschool Promise Board of Directors, 
a voter-approved initiative to ensure 
that quality preschool is available and 
affordable to all children living within 
the Cincinnati school district. It is one 
of many ways he has extended his and 
Xavier’s reach into critical issues that 
impact the Cincinnati community. 
Since Father Graham began his pres-
idency, U.S. News & World Report has 
consistently listed Xavier among the 
Nation’s top 10 Midwest universities. 
Under his leadership, the university 
has expanded to offer master’s pro-
grams in coaching education and ath-
lete development, health economic and 
clinical outcomes research, customer 
analytics, and others. The impact of 
President Graham’s academic and com-
munity-based vision for Xavier is far 
reaching. Father Mike will be missed, 
but his legacy will be felt for genera-
tions to come.∑

TRIBUTE TO JIM CAMERON 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I recog-
nize Jim Cameron, who served Volusia 
County and its residents, as the senior 
vice president of government relations 
at the Daytona Regional Chamber of 
Commerce. After 38 years of service, I 
thank Jim for his years of work and 
wish him well as he retires. 
In its 101-year history, Jim holds the 
longest tenure at the Daytona Re-
gional Chamber of Commerce. As Vice 
president of government relations, he 
understood local, State, and Federal 
economic issues facing Volusia County. 
Throughout his tenure, Jim’s profes-
sional relationships with some of Flor-
ida’s most influential political and 
business leaders bettered his commu-
nity. 
In 1985, Jim’s was working to receive 
approval from the State legislature to 
utilize hotel bed tax revenues towards 
financing a county-run convention cen-
ter. After a span of 5 years, Volusia 
County opened the Ocean Center Con-
vention Center in Daytona Beach Cen-
ter due in part to his efforts. This is 
just one of many career highlights that 
Jim is proud of. 
Jim’s more recent community ac-
complishments include advocating for 
SunRail’s extension in Volusia County, 
helping the Hard Rock Hotel establish 
a resort in Daytona Beach, and work-
ing with Space Florida to recruit aero-
space manufacturing to Volusia Coun-
ty. Simultaneously, he was also instru-
mental in important State legislative 
matters and advocating for pro-job 
policies. 
Jim is fond of the professional rela-
tionships he has formed throughout his 
career, with many evolving into close 
friendships. His personalized approach 
to government relations is best seen on 
his guarantee to pay $1,000 if he does 
not return your call within eight busi-
ness hours. 
Jim grew up in Montgomery, AL, 
graduating with a double major in his-
tory and political science from the Uni-
versity of Alabama. After graduation, 
he was appointed to the Calhoun Coun-
ty Chamber of Commerce in Anniston, 
AL, to oversee industrial and public af-
fairs. He later moved to Daytona 
Beach, where he began working at the 
Daytona Regional Chamber in 1983. 
I am grateful for Jim’s decades of 
faithful and dedicated service to our 
State and for his work with my office. 
I extend my best wishes to Jim, his 
wife Rita, and to his family on a well- 
earned retirement.∑

TRIBUTE TO LISA MORRIS 
∑ Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to recognize Lisa Morris, New 
Hampshire’s director of public health 
at the State department of health and 
human services, for her years of service 
to the Granite State. Throughout her 
career, first serving the people of New 
Hampshire’s Lakes Region at the Part-
nership for Public Health and later the 
entire State at the New Hampshire Di-
vision of Public Health, Lisa has made 
it her mission to improve the health 
and well-being of the New Hampshire 
public. I am grateful for her service to 
our State, especially her work to ad-
dress the COVID–19 pandemic over the 
past year. 
Prior to her time as the New Hamp-
shire director of public health, Lisa 
served for over a decade as the execu-
tive director of the Partnership for 
Public Health in Laconia, providing in-
valuable public health information and 
services to the people of the Lakes Re-
gion. In this role, Lisa was a leading 
voice in advocating for resources to 
meet the health needs of the region and 
solve the most pressing public health 
concerns. During her time as executive 
director, the Partnership for Public 
Health was able to provide the region 
with invaluable services such as a com-
munity emergency response team, an 
immigration welcome center, flu vac-
cine clinics, and other community 
health education programs. I especially 
commend Lisa for her attention to the 
substance misuse crisis during her time 
as executive director. 
Lisa has served as the director of 
public health for the State of New 
Hampshire since 2016 and has provided 
essential leadership through several 
public health challenges. In 2014, con-
tamination 
from 
per- 
and 
polyfluoroalkyl 
substances—PFAS— 
was first discovered in New Hampshire 
at the site of the former Pease Air 
Force Base. In the time since, more 
contamination has been found through-
out our State, including in the town of 
Merrimack and at the Coakley Landfill 
in North Hampton. While information 
about the toxicity and human health 
impacts of PFAS was only just emerg-
ing as the contamination was discov-
ered, Lisa and her team worked dili-
gently to keep the public and physi-
cians updated with necessary informa-
tion. The division of public health, 
which Lisa led, conducted PFAS blood 
testing for more than 1,800 individuals 
who reported exposure from contami-
nated drinking water while living, 
working, or attending childcare on or 
near the campus of the Pease Inter-
national Tradeport. This information 
has been invaluable for those individ-
uals worried about their health, and I 
thank Lisa for her leadership to pro-
vide this information to families. 
I also commend Lisa for her leader-
ship during the COVID–19 pandemic. As 
we all know, a once-in-a-lifetime pan-
demic has been difficult for us all, but 
Lisa’s leadership has been an incredible 
asset to the State of New Hampshire. 
From New Hampshire’s announcement 
of the first case of COVID–19 in March 
2020 to the present, the New Hampshire 
Division of Public Health has been a re-
liable resource, providing daily reports 
on the number of COVID–19 cases and 
positivity rates, which have been an 
important source of data for State 
leaders, businesses, and the general 
public. With her leadership, New Hamp-
shire was able to establish partnerships 
with the New Hampshire National 
Guard to stand up testing sites and 
vaccine distribution sites throughout 
our State. New Hampshire’s vaccine 
distribution rollout has been recog-
nized as one of the best in the Nation 
and the most efficient in reaching the 
public with shots in arms. These 
achievements can only happen with 
competent and forward-thinking lead-
ers like Lisa. 
On behalf of all the people of New 
Hampshire, I ask my colleagues and all 
Americans to join me in thanking Lisa 
for her years of service, advocacy, and 
leadership. I wish her well in her re-
tirement and the years ahead.∑

TRIBUTE TO ROBERT CAMPBELL 
∑ Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise 
today to pay tribute to Robert Camp-
bell, of Mobile, AL, who will soon step 
down as regional manager at Lamar 
Advertising. 
Robert Campbell joined Lamar Ad-
vertising in 1972 as a posting manager 
in Mobile. Robert rose through the 
ranks of sales manager and general 
manager before being appointed re-
gional manager in 1983. Throughout his 
tenure, Robert oversaw the integration 
of numerous meaningful acquisitions 
and hired and trained dozens in the 
company. He has served on the na-
tional legislative committee for the 
Outdoor Advertising Association of 
America, OAAA, for over two decades, 
and in 2007 he was inducted into the 
OAAA Hall of Fame.

Robert is an effective legislative ad-

The PRESIDING OFFICER laid be-
fore the Senate the following message 
from the President of the United 
States, together with an accompanying 
report; which was referred to the Com-
mittee 
on 
Banking, 
Housing, 
and 
Urban Affairs: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides 
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90 
days prior to the anniversary date of 
its declaration, the President publishes 
in the Federal Register and transmits to 
the Congress a notice stating that the 
emergency is to continue in effect be-
yond the anniversary date. In accord-
ance with this provision, I have sent to 
the Federal Register for publication the 
enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional emergency declared in Executive 
Order 13873 of May 15, 2019, with respect 
to securing the information and com-
munications technology and services 
supply chain, is to continue in effect 
beyond May 15, 2021. 
The unrestricted acquisition or use 
in the United States of information 
and communications technology or 
services designed, developed, manufac-
tured, or supplied by persons owned by, 
controlled by, or subject to the juris-
diction or direction of foreign adver-
saries augments the ability of these 
foreign adversaries to create and ex-
ploit vulnerabilities in information and 
communications technology or serv-
ices, with potentially catastrophic ef-
fects. This threat continues to pose an 
unusual and extraordinary threat to 
the national security, foreign policy, 
and economy of the United States. 
Therefore, I have determined that it is 
necessary to continue the national 
emergency declared in Executive Order 
13873 with respect to securing the infor-
mation 
and 
communications 
tech-
nology and services supply chain.

yond May 16, 2021. 
The actions and policies of certain 
former members of the Government of 
Yemen and others continue to threaten 
Yemen’s peace, security, and stability. 
These actions include obstructing the 
political process in Yemen and the im-
plementation of the agreement of No-
vember 23, 2011, between the Govern-
ment of Yemen and those in opposition 
to it, which provided for a peaceful 
transition of power that meets the le-
gitimate demands and aspirations of 
the Yemeni people. For this reason, I 
have determined that it is necessary to 
continue the national emergency de-
clared in Executive Order 13611 with re-

‘‘The Economic Burden of Health Inequal-
ities in the United States’’, concludes that, 
between 2003 and 2006, the combined cost of 
health inequalities and premature death in 
the United States was $1,240,000,000,000; 
Whereas African American women were as 
likely to have been diagnosed with breast

African American women were about 40 per-
cent more likely to die from breast cancer 
than non-Hispanic White women between 
2012 and 2016; 
Whereas African American women lose 
their lives to cervical cancer at more than 
twice the rate of non-Hispanic White women;

non-Hispanic Whites to suffer from end-stage 
renal disease caused by diabetes, and are 30 
percent more likely to die of diabetes, than 
non-Hispanic Whites; 
Whereas the HIV diagnosis rate among His-
panic men is more than 3 times the HIV di-
agnosis rate among non-Hispanic White men; 
Whereas the HIV diagnosis rate among His-
panic women is 4 times the HIV diagnosis 
rate among non-Hispanic White women; 
Whereas, in 2018, although African Ameri-
cans represented only 13 percent of the popu-
lation of the United States, African Ameri-
cans accounted for 42 percent of new HIV di-
agnoses; 
Whereas, in 2018, African American youth 
accounted for an estimated 51 percent, and 
Hispanic youth accounted for an estimated 
27 percent, of all new HIV diagnoses among

Whereas, in 2016, Native Hawaiians and Pa-
cific Islanders were 1.6 times more likely to

cific Islanders were 2.5 times more likely to 
be diagnosed with diabetes than non-His-

PORTING THE DESIGNATION OF 
THE 
WEEK 
OF 
APRIL 
18 
THROUGH APRIL 24, 2021, AS NA-
TIONAL CRIME VICTIMS’ RIGHTS 
WEEK 
Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. 
DURBIN, Mr. CRAPO, Mr. LEAHY, Mr. 
TILLIS, Mr. BLUMENTHAL, Mr. SCOTT of 
Florida, Mr. WHITEHOUSE, Mrs. SHA-
HEEN, and Mr. WYDEN) submitted the 
following resolution; which was consid-
ered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 206 
Whereas crime and victimization in the 
United States have significant, and some-
times life shattering, impacts on victims, 
survivors, 
and 
communities 
across 
the 
United States; 
Whereas research suggests that there are 
several million violent victimizations each 
year in the United States, yet less than half 
of all violent crimes are ever reported to po-
lice; 
Whereas crime victims and survivors need 
and deserve support and access to services to 
help them cope with the physical, psycho-
logical, financial, and other adverse effects 
of crime; 
Whereas Congress has recognized the im-
portance of supporting crime victims and 
survivors through the passage of legislation 
concerning this important issue, including— 
(1) the Victims of Crime Act of 1984 (34 
U.S.C. 20101 et seq.); 
(2) the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 
(34 U.S.C. 12291 et seq.); 
(3) the Survivors’ Bill of Rights Act of 2016 
(Public Law 114–236; 130 Stat. 966); 
(4) the Family Violence Prevention and 
Services Act (42 U.S.C. 10401 et seq.); 
(5) the Trafficking Victims Protection Act 
of 2000 (22 U.S.C. 7101 et seq.); 
(6) the Elder Abuse Prevention and Pros-
ecution Act (34 U.S.C. 21701 et seq.); 
(7) the Amy, Vicky, and Andy Child Por-
nography Victim Assistance Act of 2018 
(Public Law 115–299; 132 Stat. 4383); 
(8) the Scott Campbell, Stephanie Roper, 
Wendy Preston, Louarna Gillis, and Nila 
Lynn Crime Victims’ Rights Act (Public Law 
108–405; 118 Stat. 2261); and 
(9) the Justice for All Act of 2004 (Public 
Law 108–405; 118 Stat. 2260); 
Whereas crime can touch the life of any in-
dividual, regardless of the age, race, national 
origin, religion, or gender of that individual; 
Whereas a just society acknowledges the 
impact of crime on individuals, families, 
schools, and communities by protecting the 
rights of crime victims and survivors; 
Whereas crime victims and survivors in the 
United States, and the families of those vic-
tims and survivors, need and deserve support 
and assistance to help cope with the often 
devastating consequences of crime; 
Whereas, since Congress adopted the first 
resolution designating Crime Victims Week 
in 1985, communities across the United 
States have joined Congress and the Depart-
ment of Justice in commemorating National 
Crime Victims’ Rights Week to celebrate a 
shared vision of a comprehensive and col-
laborative response that identifies and ad-
dresses the many needs of crime victims and 
survivors and the families of those victims 
and survivors; 
Whereas the Senate applauds the work of 
crime victims advocates to ensure that all 
crime victims and survivors, and the fami-
lies of those victims and survivors, are— 
(1) treated with dignity, fairness, and re-
spect; 
(2) offered support and services, regardless 
of whether the victims and survivors report 
crimes committed against them; and 
(3) recognized as key participants within 
the criminal, juvenile, Federal, and Tribal 
justice systems in the United States when 
the victims and survivors report crimes; and 
Whereas the Senate recognizes and appre-
ciate the continued importance of— 
(1) promoting the rights of, and services 
for, crime victims and survivors; and 
(2) honoring crime victims and survivors, 
and the individuals who provide services for 
those victims and survivors: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports— 
(A) the designation of the week of April 18 
through April 24, 2021, as National Crime 
Victims’ Rights Week; and 
(B) the theme of National Crime Victims’ 
Rights Week 2021, ‘‘Support Victims. Build 
Trust. Engage Communities.’’, which empha-
sizes the importance of leveraging commu-
nity support to help crime victims and sur-
vivors; 
(2) recognizes that crime victims and sur-
vivors, and the families of those victims and 
survivors, should be treated with dignity, 
fairness, and respect; 
(3) applauds the work carried out by thou-
sands of victim assistance organizations and 
agencies that serve crime survivors at the 
local, State, Federal, and Tribal levels; 
(4) remains committed to funding pro-
grams authorized by the Victims of Crime 
Act of 1984 (34 U.S.C. 20101 et seq.) and the 
Violence Against Women Act of 1994 (34 
U.S.C. 12291 et seq.), among other Federal 
programs, which help thousands of public, 
community-based, and Tribal victim and 
survivor assistance organizations and agen-
cies that provide essential, and often life- 
saving, services to millions of crime victims 
throughout the United States; and 
(5) encourages the observance of the 40th 
anniversary of National Crime Victims’ 
Rights Week with appropriate public aware-
ness, education, and outreach activities.

f 
ALLIES AND PARTNERS 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, Winston 
Churchill famously said: ‘‘There is only 
one thing worse than fighting with al-
lies, and that is fighting without 
them.’’ 
Republicans and Democrats agree: 
Strong alliances and partnerships are 
key to the asymmetric advantage that 
the United States has over our stra-
tegic competitors. 
Like every President before him, 
President 
Biden 
has 
rightly 
made 
America’s alliances and partnerships a 
cornerstone of his administration. It is 
a national security policy. 
Alliances and partnerships are not a 
substitute for a strong American mili-
tary. A strong military is the founda-
tion of our alliances. Military power 
creates leverage and credibility for our 
diplomats, and just as importantly, it 
creates a deterrent. 
Real deterrence cannot be achieved 
unless it is credible, and it cannot be 
credible unless we properly fund our 
military and have our allies and part-
ners with us. It has to be both. You 
can’t have one or the other. Why? Be-
cause our partnerships are two-way 
streets. Alliances aren’t just for show. 
They are not just empty statements 
that we are blindly sending money to 
support vague goals. These relation-
ships are built on mutual interests. 
They benefit us just as much as they 
benefit other countries. Look at the 
billions of dollars that some of our al-
lies have contributed to U.S. bases in 
their countries. 
‘‘National Defense Strategy’’—this 
book is the one that was put together 
in 2018. It was put together by 12 peo-
ple, 6 Republicans and 6 Democrats, all 
experts in their field. In fact, one of 
them just this morning was in a com-
mittee hearing before our committee. 
This document has been our blueprint 
for a long period of time, so this is 
what we have, and this is what we feel 
is going to be something that will stay 
with us for a long time. 
In this book, it states that—and I am 
quoting from it now—‘‘mutually bene-
ficial alliances and partnerships are

May 11, 2021 
crucial to our strategy, providing a du-
rable, asymmetric strategic advantage 
that 
no 
competitor 
or 
rival 
can 
match.’’ But maintaining that asym-
metrical 
advantage 
requires 
much 
more than simply saying nice things 
about our allies and partners. 
The 
bipartisan 
National 
Defense 
Strategy Commission report, written 
by six Democrats and six Republicans, 
makes this very clear. They talk about 
how ‘‘these alliances and partnerships 
. . . have ultimately rested on a foun-
dation of military strength.’’ So when 
President Biden says that ‘‘America’s 
alliances are our greatest asset’’ and 
then goes to underfund the military, it 
defies common sense. Underfunding the 
military threatens that very founda-
tion that underwrites the effectiveness 
of our alliances and partnerships. 
Let me explain a little bit of how it 
works. We will start with nuclear mod-
ernization. 
The United States maintains a safe 
and effective nuclear arsenal to protect 
American families but also to protect 
our partners and allies. Our nuclear 
umbrella has three benefits. 
First, it makes clear to China and 
Russia which countries stand with us. 
You know, they don’t know otherwise, 
and they have a terrible practice of 
lying about which countries are with 
us or are with them. So this makes it 
very clear. It is on the dotted line. 
Second, it has the benefit of giving 
those countries the security of relying 
on our deterrence rather than feeling 
like they have to develop their own nu-
clear weapons. 
Thirdly, our umbrella of extended nu-
clear deterrence is a pillar of our goal 
of global nuclear nonproliferation. If 
we cut back our own nuclear deterrent 
and take away that umbrella, which is 
what would happen if we reduce our de-
fense budget, it is likely that nuclear 
weapons will become more common, 
not less. 
President Biden has said nuclear non-
proliferation is one of his priorities. Do 
you see the disconnect here? That is 
why it is so concerning to me that 
some administration officials—now I 
am talking about the current adminis-
tration—some of those officials are 
talking about drastically reducing our 
nuclear modernization efforts. 
I am also concerned that some in the 
administration and in Congress are tar-
geting our fifth-generation stealth air 
power. Don’t get me wrong—the F–35 
has had its problems. We all under-
stand that. But it is the cornerstone of 
our ability to operate with allies and 
our partners. 
The F–35 program—that is our pro-
gram—has 21 allies and partners in it. 
For many, it is their main capability 
and will be their primary contribution 
to any kind of a high-end problem that 
should come forward. When we talk 
about cutting the program or moving 
away from it, their governments ques-
tion our commitment. There is no sub-
stitute aircraft or capability for these 
countries. We want our allies and part-
ners to fight along with us; there is no 
question about that. 
Let’s remember what happened. First 
of all, the F–35 is a fifth-generation ve-
hicle, and we only had one other one, 
and that was the F–22. I remember so 
well, just a few years ago, at that time 
we were going to have 700 F–22 aircraft, 
but we only ended up with 187 of them 
because at the last minute, they were 
talking like they are talking today, a 
lot of people in the administration, 
saying maybe we don’t need to have as 
many F–35s. Well, we absolutely do 
need to have them. We don’t want to 
make the same mistake now that we 
made several years ago with the F–22. 
Our combatant commanders have al-
ready told us that we will be out-
numbered in terms of stealth fighters 
in the western Pacific by 2025, and it 
will be even worse if American F–35 
cuts lead—because you know that 
other countries, like our allies in Aus-
tralia and Japan, they would be cut-
ting theirs if we cut ours. 
That is just one of the many serious 
problems we have in the Indo-Pacific. 
Our partners and allies are worried 
about U.S. force posture and our abil-
ity to deter and, if necessary, defeat 
China’s use of military force. I heard 
that for myself way back in 2018 when 
I was in that area of the South China 
Sea. Many of our allies and partners in 
that region—they were clear. They saw 
firsthand how China was preparing to 
swiftly defeat our forces in the Pacific. 
They were trying to figure out how—if 
we would be there for them when that 
happened or if they would be needing 
to start cozying up to China. They are 
not going to sit around and wait for us 
to perform. They are going to have to 
know that we are going to be there for 
them. 
Our competition out there in that 
area is clearly China. We know what 
they are doing, we know what their 
plans are, and we are concerned about 
it. Fortunately, our significant invest-
ment in the military under President 
Trump was an encouraging sign to our 
allies and partners. They were all very 
proud of us. But after watching China’s 
Communist Party dismantle democ-
racy in Hong Kong and commit geno-
cide on the Uighurs in northwest 
China, our partners and allies in the 
Indo-Pacific are now worried that 
China will try to invade and annex Tai-
wan. How many years have we been 
talking about that? Now they are real-
ly concerned about it. 
General McMaster testified that Tai-
wan is ‘‘the most significant flashpoint 
that could lead to large scale war,’’ 
saying that China would take military 
action against Taiwan as soon as 2022. 
The former and current commanders of 
INDOPACOM 
both 
emphasized 
the 
near-term threat. It is a real threat. It 
is out there. 
This is the primary reason why the 
Armed Services Committee with over-
whelmingly bipartisan support has put 
in place our Pacific Deterrent Initia-
tive. We call it the PDI. The PDI is in-
tended to bolster our degraded force 
posture in the Indo-Pacific to counter 
China’s military buildup. We have to 
restore the favorable balance of power 
in the region where the problem is the 
most acute, and that is west of the 
international date line, where our part-
ners and allies are most immediately 
threatened by Chinese aggression. 
PDI is fundamentally about building 
basic infrastructure so that we can op-
erate with our allies and partners. It 
will mean more distributed and smaller 
bases, maybe hardened communica-
tions, as well as increased and more re-
alistic exercises with allies and part-
ners. 
If we want PDI to succeed, we need to 
resource it properly. Both Admirals 
Davidson and Aquilino told the Armed 
Services Committee that much just 
last week in a hearing we had in our 
committee. 
After the hollow promises of the 
Obama administration to ‘‘Pivot to the 
Pacific’’ and after almost no change in 
the U.S. military posture in the region 
over the last two decades, our partners 
and allies in the Indo-Pacific are wor-
ried, and justly so. They want to see 
sustained investment matching sus-
tained commitments, especially after 
President 
Trump 
rightfully 
pushed 
them to step up their own investments. 
They answered the call. But President 
Biden will create a credibility problem 
if we don’t continue to invest as well. 
We want them to do that. This is the 
case. We are going to have to get this 
done. 
Our INDOPACOM allies and partners 
throughout that region are watching 
closely to see what we do with the de-
fense budget top line and with PDI. 
What they see is that President Biden’s 
defense budget does not even keep up 
with inflation. We are talking about 
the defense budget that he came out 
with just a couple of weeks ago. That 
actually had a reduction. It didn’t even 
beat inflation at that time and didn’t 
come close to what was really rec-
ommended by this document that we 
are supposed to be using—it is a bipar-
tisan document—let alone matching 
the real growth we need to implement 
the National Defense Strategy. 
So over in Europe, Biden proclaimed, 
‘‘America is back,’’ and that sounds 
good, claiming a reversal from the pre-
vious administration. It is just not 
true. Again, actions are not matching 
words. Rhetoric without resources will 
devastate our credibility and under-
mine our alliances here too. 
If defense cuts impact the European 
Deterrence Initiative, it will serve to 
weaken our European posture and 
make our allies and partners more sus-
ceptible to Russian aggression. With-
out a strong defense budget, the Biden 
administration’s goal and pledge to 
support NATO and deter Russia will 
ring hollow for our European allies and 
partners. 
Sharing the burden is a key benefit 
of our international alliances and part-
nerships, 
but 
our 
NATO 
alliances

might see the administration’s mili-
tary reductions as a signal that they 
no longer need to meet their commit-
ments to spend 2 percent of their GDP. 
Now, remember when the previous 
President, President Trump, talked to 
our allies to start bellying up and par-
ticipating. NATO—those nations are 
our friends, but they are not coming to 
the level that they are going to have to 
do to carry their end of it. 
Don’t forget—whether we are facing 
Russia, China, or other adversaries in 
other parts of the world, operating 
jointly with our allies and partners is a 
core part of our ability to deter con-
flict in multiple theaters, but it re-
quires investment. 
Take the refueling support we pro-
vided for our French allies in Mali—6 
million pounds of fuel to allow the 
French to take on that critical coun-
terterrorism mission and support their 
troops on the ground. It would have 
cost us billions to do this mission by 
ourselves. That is why we need the al-
lies. The same goes for Iraq, Afghani-
stan, Somalia, Yemen, and elsewhere. 
A good portion of our defense budget 
pays for our military to support our al-
lies and partners so that we don’t have 
to send our own troops over there and 
our allies can do it for us. It gives us 
insight into its operations. 
So do you see what would happen if 
our military’s ability to posture for-
ward and stay ready is choked by inad-
equate defense spending? Our allies and 
partners would suffer, not improve, and 
the United States would end up spend-
ing more money for less security. This 
goes directly against the Biden admin-
istration’s stated goals. 
Thinking that alliances and partner-
ships can substitute for U.S. military 
capability and capacity is wishful 
thinking. It is illogical. That strategy 
will harm our national security. As 
former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis 
said, ‘‘Throughout history, we see na-
tions with allies thrive and nations 
without allies wither.’’ If we want to 
win against our strategic competitors, 
it will take both a strong, fully 
resourced military, as well as strong 
alliances and partnerships. Let’s be 
clear. One is not an alternative for the 
other. You got to have both. 
So it is clear then that we need our 
allies. So how do we maintain this mu-
tual relationship with robust defense 
spending of 3 to 5 percent real growth? 
That is what it calls for right here. 
This year, we should have a 3- to 5-per-
cent increase, and the President’s 
budget actually came out with a net 
decrease. That is why this whole thing 
is so important. 
Just this morning, we had a hearing, 
and we had one of the authors of this 
book. I asked him the same question. I 
said: This was put together back in 
2018. Is it still accurate today? He said: 
Yes, it is. And it doesn’t even increase 
enough to keep up with inflation. 
So Eric Edelman—he is one of the co-
sponsors of the NDS that we are refer-
ring to here that has been our blue-
print for 5 years now. The report said it 
best in an article this week by Eric 
Edelman. He said in this article: 
[I]t remains a fact that allies and adver-
saries will see the U.S. commitment to de-
fense as a crucial benchmark for assessing 
U.S. willingness and ability to succeed at 
long-term competition with its authori-
tarian adversaries. 
He 
continued, 
and 
this 
is 
Eric 
Edelman: 
A tough declaratory policy without ade-
quate military means to reinforce it is a rec-
ipe for disaster, particularly in the Indo-Pa-
cific region. 
So I would just say this: President 
Biden walks the walk, but when it 
comes to supporting our allies, they 
don’t do it, and I and many others 
know that it is meaningless without a 
strong defense budget to back it up. 
And we need a higher topline. We 
need a higher topline. It is going to 
have to be somewhere in the range that 
was put together by a group of Demo-
crats and Republicans that outlined 
what we have to do for America to sur-
vive. So we need a higher topline, and 
we are going to end up getting a higher 
topline. 
With that, I yield the floor.

IN HONOR OF THE LIFE OF REV. 
DR. GARTHER ROBERSON, JR. 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 11, 2021 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of Reverend Doctor 
Garther Roberson, Jr. of Ypsilanti, Michigan. 
His lifetime of service and dedication to our 
community is worthy of commendation. 
Rev. Roberson was born in Ypsilanti, Michi-
gan on August 1, 1927, the fifth child of Pastor 
Garther Roberson, Sr. and Estella Roberson. 
He attended Ypsilanti Public Schools and after 
graduation in 1948, went on to serve his coun-
try in the United States Army during the Ko-
rean War. He earned the Korean Services 
Medals of Honor with the Bronze Star and an 
Overseas Bar. Rev. Roberson was educated 
at Washtenaw Community College, Moody 
Bible College, Trinity College, and William 
Tyndale College. He was awarded an Hon-
orary Doctor of Divinity Degree from the Ten-
nessee School of Religion (Ypsilanti Exten-
sion) in 1999. 
As a member of the Second Baptist Church 
in Ypsilanti, he served as director of the youth 
department, Sunday school superintendent, 
and as Deacon until he was called to serve as 
Reverend in 1979. Rev. Roberson also served 
as Pastor at Mount Olive Baptist Church in 
Ypsilanti. He was known for his love for the 
community and the people he served. His 
warmth and joyful personality led to him being 
a trusted confidante for not only the congrega-
tion of his church, but for local youth and com-
munity leaders as well. 
A leader not only in the faith community, 
Rev. Roberson was a fixture in Washtenaw 
County, serving as President of the Minister’s 
Alliance and as President for Joint Operational 
Services for a Human Urban Alliance (JOSH-
UA). Rev. Roberson was the longest serving 
member of the Minister’s Alliance and was 
presented with a Congregational Certificate of 
Honor Founder’s Day Award by Pastor Phillip 
Farrell. In 1996, he was chosen to deliver the 
Invocation for former President William Jeffer-
son Clinton during his visit to Eastern Michi-
gan University. Additionally, he served on the 
boards of the NAACP, Hope Clinic, the Stu-
dents and Friends of Washtenaw County 
Community College, and the Huron Valley Dis-
trict Christian Academy. Many honors bear his 
name; In Ypsilanti, March 15th to 17th is 
known as ‘‘Reverend Garther Roberson, Jr. 
Week’’ and April 4, 2003 is known as ‘‘Garther 
Roberson Day’’ and each year, JOSHUA 
awards the ‘‘Rev. Dr. Garther Roberson Com-
munity Leadership Award’’ to outstanding 
leaders in the area. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the life of Reverend Doctor 
Garther Roberson, Jr., a pillar of our commu-
nity, a native son of Ypsilanti, and a man of 
true faith. He will be deeply missed but has 
left behind a lasting legacy. Our thoughts are 
with his friends, family, and congregation at 
this time.

WILLIAM (BILL) FRANCIS HOOVER 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 11, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize William (Bill) Francis Hoo-
ver of Aurora, Colorado who passed away 
May 1, 2021. 
Bill was born and raised on his family’s farm 
in Topeka, Kansas as the third of five children. 
Bill joined the United States Air Force in 1950 
and rose to the rank of Major in 1965. While 
stationed in Tennessee, Bill met the love of 
his life, Sue. They were married in 1960. 
Bill served with honor and distinction in the 
U.S. Air Force. He served in Korea, Vietnam 
and Cold War operations across the world. He 
was awarded numerous commendations, in-
cluding one of the Air Force’s highest awards, 
the Distinguished Flying Cross. He earned this 
medal during the Vietnam War for his actions 
as 
Aircraft 
Commander 
of 
an 
AC–119 
gunship. Under great personal risk and during 
terrible weather conditions in mountainous ter-
rain, he and his crew repelled an attack, sav-
ing the lives of the troops who were at risk of 
being overrun by North Vietnamese Forces. 
He retired from the Air Force in November 
1970. 
Following his career in the Air Force, he 
flew Lear Jets out of Columbus Airport, but 
soon realized it took him away from his family 
too much, and he began a second career 
working for the Federal Aviation Administra-
tion. He was stationed in Rawlins, Wyoming, 
where he was able to teach his children to 
hunt and fish while he kept flying as a Cer-
tified Flight Instructor. Bill and his family then 
moved to Aurora, Colorado in 1977. His expe-
rience and knowledge was again put to use, 
as he served on the FAA’s Air Traffic Proce-
dures Advisory Committee to develop aviation 
safety and operation regulations. Bill retired 
from the FAA after 20 years of service to the 
government. After retiring, Bill and Sue trav-
eled the world, often with family and friends. 
They were inseparable, enjoying a life of ad-
venture. 
Bill was a devoted husband and loving fa-
ther and grandfather. He and his wife Sue 
raised five children—Bill, David, Lori, John and 
Theresa. He was especially fond of his seven-
teen grandchildren and loved and cherished 
his five great-grandchildren. 
In addition to his career in the Air Force, Bill 
was a devoted member of Queen of Peace 
Catholic Parish. He was a lifetime member of 
the Knights of Columbus as a fourth-degree 
knight. I am deeply grateful for his lifetime of 
service to our community. 
RECOGNIZING THE REMARKABLE 
LIFE OF DOROTHY M. SWEENEY 
HON. SCOTT PERRY 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 11, 2021 
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, I’m honored 
and humbled to recognize the remarkable life 
of Mrs. Dorothy M. Sweeney, who left our 
earthly bounds on April 7, 2021. ‘‘Mother 
Sweeney,’’ as she affectionately was called, 
leaves behind an eternal and meaningful leg-
acy not only to her family and loved ones, but 
to the entire York County Community. 
Mother Sweeney’s life began on January 
16, 1934, born to Eddie and Rhoda Hawkins. 
She was the youngest child—and only girl—in 
a household of older brothers, Edward Jr., 
Clyde, and Herman. 
Mother Sweeney married Arthur Sweeney in 
1951, when they planted their roots in York. 
Together, they raised four wonderful chil-
dren—Takanii, Tomoa Tanya, Tanoue Onishi, 
and Arleta Maria—with a resilient sense of 
love and respect for their legacy. 
After a tragic work-related accident claimed 
the life of her beloved husband, Mother 
Sweeney was thrust into single parenthood. 
As obstacles were placed along her path, she 
persevered—like her mother, Rhoda Hawkins. 
Mother Sweeney would go on to graduate 
from York College with a degree in Nursing, 
all while managing a household of four beau-
tiful, albeit sometimes unruly, children. She 
raised her children with a strong and powerful 
image of womanhood. She served as the 
head nurse at York County Homes, and as a 
private duty nurse while also volunteering for 
the local PTA—later serving as its president 
for over six years. She would go on to accept 
a position with Lincoln Intermediate Unit No. 
12 as a teacher for special needs children. 
Mother Sweeney made sure that her chil-
dren knew their elders and family history, 
making sure to surround her daughters with 
family and love, as well as a connection to 
their roots. Her family soon began to grow, as 
her daughters welcomed children of their own. 
Her oldest, Takanii, had 11 children (Damaine, 
Tak, TakaKhan, Asaii, Ishni, Kiya, Azijah, 
Adonysha, Zebulon, Masata, and Amasa), 
Tomoa had four children (Angela, Yahselah, 
Nashon, and Ashir), Tanoue had one son 
(Emneko), and Arleta had five children (Tazaa, 
Taza Todd, Tyleta, T-Hara, and Tynaketa). 
When Mother Sweeney retired profes-
sionally, she certainly was kept busy with 21 
grandchildren—and all the birthdays, holidays, 
and celebrations a large family brings. When 
asked about the number of great-grand-
children she has, Dorothy’s response was, 
‘‘after 10, I stopped counting.’’ The branches 
of her great family tree have continued to 
grow with 45 great-grandchildren—and count-
ing. 
Mother Sweeney was always an energetic 
and active young lady, serving her family, 
church, and community. As a faithful and dedi-
cated member of Emmanuel COGIC in York—

of which her mother was one of the founding 
members—she has served under founding 
pastor Elder Wise until his home going. Until 
now, Mother Sweeney was the only living 
founding member. Remaining steadfast under 
the leadership of Pastor Leighton McMillan, 
she held various leadership positions, includ-
ing Sunday school teacher, chair of the Pas-
tors Aide Committee, a member of the nurses 
unit, vice president of the Deaconesses, and 
was appointed as Mother of Grace. 
Civically, Mother Sweeney was an active 
member of the State Democratic Committee, 
president of the Democratic Club of York, vice 
president of Lincoln Charter School Board, 
Past Matron of the Queen Esther Temple 
IBPOE, positions in Eastern Stars PJA, 
Daughters of Isis—and numerous other com-
munity 
organizations. 
Whenever 
possible, 
Mother Sweeney loved traveling to Florida to 
be with her ‘‘Sunshine State’’ family—the Bur-
ton/Nealy family, Pastor & First Lady Speed, 
Elder & Mother Combs, Pastor & First Lady 
Mays, Bishop Theadore and First Lady Hall, 
BAM International Fellowship. During the 
COVID–19 pandemic, Mother Sweeney en-
joyed being a part of Hurst Chapel AME Park-
ing Lot Posse, enjoying Sunday morning serv-
ice in the church parking lot. 
Mother Sweeney was a matriarch, a pillar of 
truth, and a true shining light. With words of 
wisdom, her strong Christian values, and her 
loving heart, she guided and nurtured her fam-
ily and her community. She took pride in 
knowing that her beloved family remains 
strong and ever-growing, just as she and Ar-
thur had envisioned. Mother Sweeney was 
and will always be all that a virtuous woman 
should be, and truly sets the standard for all 
to follow. 
With great honor and thanks, I’m humbled 
to acknowledge the life and legacy of Mrs. 
Dorothy M. ‘‘Mother Sweeney’’ of York, Penn-
sylvania. I wish her Godspeed.

100 YEARS OF DEDICATED SUP-

TO 
THE 
VETERANS 
OF 
MACOMB COUNTY MICHIGAN 
HON. LISA C. McCLAIN 
OF MICHIGAN

Tuesday, May 11, 2021 
Mrs. MCCLAIN. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
celebrate the 100th anniversary of the North 
End-Sterling Heights VFW Post 6250. 
VFWs across the country provide sanc-
tuaries of support for our nation’s veterans. 
Post 6250 is no different. In their times of 
need, Post 6250 has been there for the vet-
erans of Macomb County by assisting with the 
VA, providing wheelchairs and helping vet-
erans restart their lives. This is only a drop in 
the bucket for what this post has done, and 
their assistance even extends to the widows of 
our fallen heroes. 
The men and women who serve are our na-
tion’s most selfless citizens, and they should 
have all the support they need when they 
come home. Luckily for the veterans of 
Macomb County, VFW Post 6250 has been 
their strong ally for a century. It is an honor to 
congratulate them on reaching this historic 
milestone, and I wish them many more years 
of dedicated service to our veterans. 
IN MEMORY OF ADAM KOLTON 
HON. JARED HUFFMAN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 11, 2021 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of Adam Kolton, who 
passed away on April 26, 2021. A graduate of 
the University of Wisconsin, he lived in Be-
thesda, Maryland with his family and their dog, 
Riley. He is survived by two sons, 17-year-old 
Jacob and 14-year-old Sam, as well as his 
wife, Laura; his parents, Chet and Carol; his 
sister Lisa; mother-in-law Priscilla; and broth-
er-in-law Sandy. 
A tireless environmental advocate, Adam 
spent much of his career fighting oil and gas 
development in the Arctic National Wildlife 
Refuge. At the beginning of his career, he 
oversaw a vital period as the Arctic Refuge 
Campaign Director at Alaska Wilderness 
League from 1997 to 2002, spearheading the 
fight to block Congress and the Bush adminis-
tration from opening the refuge’s coastal plain 
to drilling. Following that, he spent 15 years at 
the National Wildlife Federation, eventually 
overseeing its 40-person Washington, D.C. of-
fice as Vice President of National Advocacy 
and leading staff in countless conservation 
wins, including another high-profile Arctic Ref-
uge battle in 2005. In 2017, he returned to 
Alaska Wilderness League as its Executive Di-
rector and led the organization’s work to pro-
tect Alaska’s public lands and waters through 
the politically challenging years of the Trump 
administration. His passion for bringing people 
together to protect the Arctic Refuge was high-
lighted by his dedication to elevating the 
voices of impacted Indigenous communities 
like the Gwich’in. 
As a northern New Jersey native, Adam 
was an unapologetic fan of the New York 
Mets and the forever hapless New York Jets. 
Early in his life, he and a friend formed Sports 
Fans United—‘‘the largest nonprofit fan advo-
cacy group in the country’’—and Adam even 
testified before Congress in a hearing on re-
voking baseball’s longstanding exemption from 
antitrust laws. 
It is my honor to recognize Adam Kolton, an 
individual wholly dedicated to the protection of 
our nation’s wildest places like the Arctic Ref-
uge. I ask my colleagues to join me in hon-
oring the life of this remarkable advocate for 
conservation.

OPENING 
THEIR 
FIRST 
NEW HAMPSHIRE LOCATION 
HON. CHRIS PAPPAS 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 11, 2021 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate Align Credit Union on opening 
their new location in Seabrook, their first in 
New Hampshire. 
Every day brings unique challenges to our 
entrepreneurs here in the Granite State—even 
more so during these unprecedented times— 
but as someone who has owned and operated 
a family restaurant, I know that it’s institutions 
like Align Credit Union that help drive our 
economy and form the fabric of our commu-
nities. Since its founding in 1922, Align has 
built strong bonds within New England com-
munities, and maintained its focus on mem-
bers, regardless of circumstance. 
Community financial institutions like Align 
have long served an essential purpose in ex-
panding financial literacy and strengthening 
local economies. Now, their work is more im-
portant than ever, as Americans turn to credit 
unions to disburse essential relief funds and 
rely on their support of Main Street busi-
nesses. Align’s cooperative model and ‘‘peo-
ple helping people’’ approach has been essen-
tial to its members during this crisis. We wel-
come Align to the Seacoast of New Hamp-
shire. 
Once again, I want to congratulate Align 
Credit Union on this great achievement, and 
them for all those who have been involved in 
making this possible.

RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE 
OF MINING IN ARIZONA 
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 11, 2021 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize those that fight for true economic 
independence in this country, the mining in-
dustry. Recently, the Arizona State Senate 
passed a resolution recognizing and honoring 
the importance of mining in Arizona and the 
nation at large which was joined by the Ari-
zona House of Representatives in a Concur-
rent Resolution, No. 2009. 
As a member of the House Natural Re-
sources Committee, a variety of energy sub-
committees, and as former Chairman of the 
Western Caucus, I have worked with the min-
ing industry and I understand the difficult job 
the industry has in navigating a political cli-
mate that takes for granted its indispensable 
and vital products. Indeed, many misguided, 
naive, or simply ignorant people seek to ban 
mining, restrict it, or eradicate it from our 
lands. This is foolish and only increases the 
costs of every product made with mined re-
sources (which is almost everything) and 
makes us reliant on China and Russia. 
I am proffering the Arizona Concurrent Res-
olution for the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD for all 
to see that at this time in history, the leaders 
of Arizona understand the importance of min-
ing and will not allow federal bureaucrats and 
radical environmental socialists to shut down 
our key industry.

Whereas, copper and other minerals pro-
duced through the hardrock mining process 
are critical to developing and manufacturing 
low-carbon energy sources, including, PV 
cells, wind turbines, electric vehicles, med-
ical equipment and battery storage; and 
Whereas, each 3MW wind turbine requires 
approximately 4.7 tons of copper to produce 
reliable low-carbon energy; and 
Whereas, PV cell production accounts for 
seven percent of global silver demand; and 
Whereas, the World Bank estimates that in 
the next twenty-five years the world will 
need 550 million tons of copper, which is 
equal to all the copper produced in the pre-
vious five thousand years, to meet low-car-
bon energy demands; and 
Whereas, according to the United States 
Geological Survey, Arizona was second in 
the nation in the value of 2018 nonfuel min-
eral production, which includes sand and 
gravel, cement and crushed stone as well as 
copper and other minerals such as molyb-
denum, lead, zinc, gold, silver, coal and ura-
nium; and 
Whereas, Arizona has been the nation’s top 
producer of copper for more than a century, 
delivering two-thirds of United States copper 
exports and sixty-eight percent of the na-
tion’s copper; and 
Whereas, mining activity and employment 
opportunities 
are 
distributed 
widely 
throughout the state and provide economic 
benefits for every Arizona county; and 
Whereas, the hardrock mining industry is 
Arizona’s second largest industry by eco-
nomic impact, directly and indirectly em-
ploying more than 38,900 valuable and impor-
tant individuals with an average income 
higher than Arizona’s median wage in 2018 
who are a part of the successes of the mining 
industry; and 
Whereas, in 2018, the hardrock mining in-
dustry directly and indirectly generated $370 
million in state and local tax revenues, cre-
ating a total economic impact of $11.4 bil-
lion; and 
Whereas, to ensure that mining operations 
are safe for employees, communities and the 
environment, the hardrock mining industry 
is regulated by a combination of state and 
federal agencies, including the Arizona De-
partment of Environmental Quality, the 
United States Environmental Protection 
Agency, the Arizona State Mine Inspector’s 
Office and the United States Department of 
Labor Mine Safety and Health Administra-
tion. 
Therefore, be it resolved, by the House of 
Representatives of the State of Arizona, the 
Senate concurring: 
That the Members of the Legislature rec-
ognize the importance of the hardrock min-
ing industry to Arizona’s economy and sup-
port the involvement of Arizona’s govern-
ment and the hardrock mining industry in 
any future regulatory changes to ensure that 
operations continue to be safe and produc-
tive for the State of Arizona.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
RETIREMENT 
OF 
VERNON 
POLICE 
CHIEF 
JAMES KENNY 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 11, 2021 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute to the distinguished career 
in public service of Vernon Police Chief James 
Kenny. Having pursued a 36–year long career 
toward the betterment of the local policing 
community, the latter 15 within my hometown 
of Vernon, Chief Kenny announced his deci-
sion to retire on July 9, 2021. As a resident of 
Vernon who directly benefited from Chief Ken-
ny’s commitment to ‘‘Preserve and Protect’’ 
and as a public official who has a front row 
seat to observe him in action, I can attest to 
his stellar record of public service. 
Born and educated in the nearby town of 
Rocky Hill, James was destined to deepen his 
roots within the region help and build upon the 
community ties that raised him. Connected to 
his commitment to the conununity was his 
passion for service: immediately upon his 
graduation from Rocky Hill High School in 
1978, James enlisted into the United States 
Army. He trained as a military police officer 
and served oversees, ultimately receiving an 
honorable discharge. After returning home he 
earned a Bachelor of Science Degree in 
Criminal Justice from Bryant University with 
Honors, all the while working as a part time 
constable in Old Lyme, Connecticut. 
James Kenny initially joined the force as a 
patrol officer with the Glastonbury Police De-
partment, a stone’s throw away from his 
hometown, Rocky Hill. During his tenure at 
Glastonbury, his forward-thinking embrace-
ment of community policing and diligent work 
habits accelerated him through the ranks, ris-
ing in leadership to field training officer, ser-
geant, and then captain in the year 2000. He 
stayed on with the Glastonbury Department, 
serving as a supervisor in both the patrol and 
detective divisions until he transferred to the 
Vernon Police Department as a captain in 
2006. It is worth noting that whilst serving 
within the Glastonbury Police Department, 
James pursued additional opportunities to 
serve the region such as when he became a 
founding member and then team leader to the 
Capital Region Emergency Services Team. 
Upon his retirement from Glastonbury’s Po-
lice 
Department, 
James 
Kenny 
joined 
Vernon’s Police Department in 2006 as a cap-
tain, becoming responsible for the entire oper-
ations of the local department. Of course, in 
transitioning to the Vernon Police Department, 
Captain James Kenny continued his advocacy 
of community policing in Vernon’s neighbor-
hoods, particularly the Rockville section of 
town. This proactive initiative did not go unno-
ticed, and it was not long before Captain 
Kenny became Police Chief Kenny in 2007. 
During his term, I had the opportunity to do 
some ‘‘ride-alongs’’ and witness the engage-
ment with town residents that the chief himself 
and his officers practiced as part the ‘‘Kenny 
Plan’’. 
Presence was a major tenet of Vernon Po-
lice Chief Kenny’s tenure as a leader in polic-
ing—not just for the region within the second 
district of Connecticut, but the entire state. He 
utilized this presence to grow the mission of 
and advocate for community policing. Shortly 
after becoming head of the Vernon Police De-
partment, Chief Kenny was selected to sit on 
Governor Jodi Rell’s Sentencing and Parole 
Review Task Force in order to thoroughly re-
view policies involved in arresting, charging, 
sentencing and releasing those convicted of 
crimes in Connecticut. Around this same time, 
Chief Kenny also joined the Criminal Justice 
Policy Advisory Commission, for which he has 
remained on through to retirement. Even as 
our nation has brought to the forefront tough 
discussions on police reform, Police Chief 
Kenny and the Vernon Police Department re-
mained a source of inspiration to the impor-
tance of a community-oriented and integrated 
local police force. It is worth noting that the 
Vernon Police Department, under the forward- 
thinking perspective of Chief Kenny, has long 
been a leader in this regard with the unit al-
ready having implemented policies to build 
trust within the town, such as through early 
utilization of body cameras and revisions to 
their authorized use of force. 
Madam Speaker, Chief Kenny has spent his 
life and career toward the betterment of his 
community. Chief Kenny has been a leader 
and a mentor to many people within and out-
side of the aforementioned policing depart-
ments. The town of Vernon owes him an end-
less amount of gratitude for his leadership in 
evolving an essential community service, par-
ticularly amidst the pandemic. He now retires 
to dedicate more time to his primary job as a 
devoted husband to his wife Theresa and a 
loving father of three daughters Lexie, Jac-
queline and Jamie—the last of whom did an 
outstanding stint as an intern in my D.C. of-
fice. I cannot think of a gentleman more de-
serving of a fruitful retirement, the people of 
Vernon will truly miss his talented, caring serv-
ice. To that end, I ask my colleagues in the 
House join me in honoring and thanking 
Vernon Police Chief James Kenny for his ex-
emplary lifetime of service and wishing him 
and his family all the best in their life’s new 
chapter.

EAST RIVER TUNNELS 
HON. RITCHIE TORRES 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 11, 2021 
Mr. TORRES of New York. Madam Speak-
er, I include in the Record a study conducted 
by the London Bridge Association on the ben-
efits of implementing a repair-in-place model 
for rehabilitating the East River Tunnels in 
New York City. The full study can be found at

Track bed and overhead line replacement 
is a priority because it is responsible for a 
large percentage of the delays. 
1.5. NRT CURRENT CONDITIONS—OVERVIEW 
The NRT consists of two tubes and was 
constructed in the early 1900s and, in addi-
tion to suffering from old age, was impacted 
by Superstorm Sandy, the deadliest and 
most destructive, as well as the strongest, 
hurricane of the 2012 hurricane season. The 
NRT is located on the Northeast Corridor

(NEC), the most heavily used passenger rail-
way in the United States and is used for over 
200,000 passenger trips by NJ TRANSIT and 
Amtrak customers. The NRT is experiencing 
the following conditions: 
Long-term damaged and deteriorating tun-
nel infrastructure 
Leaks in shafts and tubes 
Tunnel services are beyond their useful life 
and need replacement 
Track faults 
Overhead line (catenary) issues 
Poor drainage and maintenance issues 
Salts/chlorides from Superstorm Sandy 
corrode rails and exacerbate stray current 
Due to the long-term deterioration and the 
conditions described above, the NRT’s two 
tubes are currently experiencing incidents 
that are increasing in frequency and unpre-
dictability and are threatening the reliable 
operation of the NRT for Amtrak and NJ 
TRANSIT customers. A report from the 
Northeast Corridor Commission (Ref 12.1.6) 
analysed more than 3 million train move-
ments and 750,000 daily delay records be-
tween 2014 and 2018. The report found there 
were 65 days where incidents in or around 
the NRT resulted in more than 5 hours of 
train delay, of which 45 were caused by infra-
structure issues, resulting in 2,500 delayed 
trains and 65,800 train delay minutes. The re-
port indicated that the delay minutes were 
due to: 
Signal Problems (13% of delay minutes) 
Track Conditions (31% of delay minutes) 
Overhead Power (35% of delay minutes) 
Other (21% of delay minutes) 
1.6. CURRENT REFURBISHMENT PLAN 
The current proposal for the NRT Refur-
bishment proposes a solution that would be 
completed after the construction and com-
pletion of the new Hudson River Tunnel 
(HRT) in 2028, thus leaving the NRT ‘‘at 
risk’’ until 2032, at the earliest (as of the 2019 
financial Plan). Based on LBA’s review of the 
current NRT conditions, LBA believes that 
this is an unsatisfactory situation, does not 
meet global best practice, and that there are 
approaches that could be adopted to target 
the refurbishment at a much earlier time. 
LBA, therefore, considered how this risk to 
the NRT infrastructure and to the Amtrak 
and NJ TRANSIT customer experience could 
be reduced and a resilient and reliable serv-
ice established at the earnest possible time 
whilst delivering better value.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
2.1
OVERVIEW 
This report takes into account the current 
NJ TRANSIT and Amtrak rail operations 
and concludes that regular weeknight and 
weekend periods of a one-tube outage are 
feasible, reliable, and safe. This would neces-
sitate an in-service sequence of work in only 
one of the NRT tubes at any point in time 
and refurbishment could be undertaken si-
multaneously in a number of locations in the 
occupied NRT tube by means of bespoke 
highly productive works trains or road rail 
vehicles. 
This review is conceptual and general in 
nature, based on limited information pro-
vided. Further diligence is required to verify 
the feasibility of the LBA proposals and to 
confirm the assumptions made concerning 
the NRT, as well as developing the planning 
and budgeting for the NRT Refurbishment 
work. 
Refurbishment activities identified are: 
Repair the tunnel lining and seal the leaks 
Replace the mechanical and electrical 
services in the tunnel with new and im-
proved systems 
Replace the High Voltage (HV) cables 
which pass through the tubes 
Demolish the bench walls (which are too 
high and failing) and replace them with new 
walkways and cable containments 
Replace the trackbed, track, and overhead 
catenary 
Replace the signalling system 
The refurbishment activities that are pro-
posed to be accomplished through an in-serv-
ice refurbishment are broadly the same as 
the activities currently proposed in the full 
outage scenario. 
The specific target of LBA’s review has 
been to consider whether it is feasible, safe, 
and with no impact to the rail service, to 
carry out the refurbishment while both of 
the NRT’s two tubes remain in service, with 
refurbishment work being carried out in 
agreed off-peak outage periods during both 
overnights and weekends. 
In doing so, LBA have leaned on their ex-
perience gained on recent projects in the 
United Kingdom and also referred to inter-
national best practice on other recent 
projects in the United Kingdom, Europe, 
Hong Kong, and the United States (the 
Canarsie Tubes/L-Train). Refurbishment in- 
service is becoming increasingly the norm of 
international best practice as highly utilised 
railway systems/tunnels get older and are 
under increasing pressure due to rising pas-
senger demand. Some examples of refurbish-
ment in-service on the London Underground, 
a very old and busy system, include the re-
furbishment of the Central Line and North-
ern Line tunnels as well as 3.2 km of the 
Metropolitan Line (the world’s first under-
ground railway dating back to 1863) between 
Baker Street and Finchley Road Under-
ground Stations. 
To demonstrate the feasibility of an in- 
service NRT Refurbishment that would im-
plement the refurbishment activities identi-
fied above, LBA has developed a conceptual 
approach and developed an outline plan and 
program for the NRT: 
A conceptual approach, strategy, and sys-
tem of work 
Outputs and calculated durations of work 
based 
on 
the 
available 
working 
time 
(weeknight and weekend one-tube outages) 
A schedule for the refurbishment activities 
for each tube 
The logistics arrangements (at an outline 
stage): 
The equipment which could be used to de-
molish, remove, and reconstruct the walk-
ways/benches 
The safety equipment required to carry out 
the works 
The options for trackbed replacement 
LBA have carried out a construction plan-
ning exercise of all of the main activities 
with the purpose of demonstrating the over-
all feasibility and possible schedule of NRT 
Refurbishment in-service while managing 
risks to NJ TRANSIT and Amtrak cus-
tomers. LBA emphasises that such construc-
tion planning study is conceptual and gen-
eral in nature, with limited information. 
2.2
FINDING: THE NRT IS EXPERIENCING 
SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION 
The NRT consists of two tubes and was 
constructed in the early 1900s and, in addi-
tion to suffering from old age, was impacted 
by Superstorm Sandy, the deadliest and 
most destructive, as well as the strongest, 
hurricane of the 2012 hurricane season. The 
NRT is experiencing the following condi-
tions: Long-tern, damaged and deteriorating 
tunnel infrastructure, leaks in shafts and 
tubes, tunnel services are beyond their use-
ful life and need replacement, track faults, 
overhead line (catenary) issues, poor drain-
age and maintenance issues, and salts/ 
chlorides from Superstorm Sandy corrode 
rails and exacerbate stray current. 
2.3,
FINDING: WHAT IS NOT RECOMMENDED 
2.3.1 Waiting for the Construction of the 
New Tunnel to Start NRT Refurbishment: 
The current proposal for the NRT Refur-
bishment proposes a solution that would be 
completed after the construction and com-
pletion of the new Hudson River Tunnel 
(HRT) in 2028, thus leaving the NRT ‘‘at 
risk’’ until 2032, at the earliest (as of the 2019 
Financial Plan). Based on LBA’s review of 
the current NRT conditions, LBA believes 
that this is an unsatisfactory situation, does 
not meet global best practice, and that there 
are approaches that could be adopted to tar-
get the refurbishment at a much earlier 
time. 
2.3.2 Removing Scope from the Current 
NRT Refurbishment Plan: 
The NRT’s two tubes are currently experi-
encing incidents that are increasing in fre-
quency and unpredictability and are threat-
ening the reliable operation of the NRT for 
Amtrak and NJ TRANSIT customers. The 
NRT Refurbishment requires an approach 
that includes a scope of work necessary to 
address the long-term deterioration of the 
existing infrastructure, and should be broad-
ly the same as the activities currently pro-
posed in the full outage scenario. 
2.3.3 Repairing the NRT Incrementally 
Through Smaller Repairs: 
A ‘‘stabilization’’ type approach is poor 
value and will not solve the basic problems. 
2.3.4 Leaving the NRT Bench Walls, As 
They Currently Exist, in Place: 
The NRT bench walls cannot be left as is 
because: 
1) The height of the existing bench wall is 
higher than the level of the train vestibule, 
requiring an unacceptable stepping distance 
in an emergency, 
2) The headroom of the emergency walk-
way needs to be increased. 
The concrete forming the existing bench 
walls is likely to be relatively weak with nu-
merous internal voids. There is a require-
ment to lower the level of the bench wall in 
the NRT by 2–3 feet in order to achieve satis-
factory emergency egress according to NFPA 
130. Further, a low-level Maintenance Plat-
form bench wall on the opposite side of the 
tube from the emergency bench wall is pro-
posed for railway workers to gain access to 
the train bogies (underneath the train/wheel 
truck), It should be noted that the Canarsie 
Tubes (L-Train) bench walls could be left at 
their existing height, but this is not possible 
in the NRT based on current information. 
2.3.5 Leaving the Track, Trackbed, and 
Overhead Line, As They Currently Exist, in 
Place: 
The NRT track, trackbed, and overhead 
line failures, according to the Northeast Cor-
ridor Commission report on train perform-
ance, are the causes of a significant propor-
tion of the delays to NJ TRANSIT and Am-
trak customers and do not meet global best 
practice. 
It 
should 
be 
noted that the 
Canarsie Tubes (L-Train) already had a fixed 
concrete trackbed system, unlike the NRT, 
and only partial refurbishment was required. 
2.3.6 Leaving the Mechanical and Elec-
trical (M&E) Services, As They Currently 
Exist, in Place: 
Mechanical and Electrical (M&E) Services, 
including cables, ducting, water and fire 
main piping, signalling, and communications 
cabling, are currently operable, but are not 
considered to be ‘‘State of the Art,’’ are con-
tained in degraded benchwalls, and con-
tribute to system failures. Any form of in- 
service refurbishment will require sequential 
and phased management of the relocation 
and replacement of these services, which will 
be moved in synchronization with the demo-
lition and replacement of the bench walls 
and necessary repairs to the tunnel concrete 
lining. The M&E services will need to be pro-
tected and fireproofed in compliance with 
contemporary regulations (operational and 
emergency compliance requirements).

It has been previously considered that the 
only way to protect cables from fire and me-
chanical damage is to pull them into ducts 
encased by concrete forming the bench walls. 
This cumbersome solution restricts the 
lengths of HV cables which can be pulled 
into ducts, does not give easy access for 
maintenance, and requires frequent joint 
pits which are current sources of failure. 
2.4
FINDING: WHAT IS RECOMMENDED 
2.4.1 Implement NRT Refurbishment ‘‘In- 
Service’’: 
LBA believes that regular weeknight and 
weekend periods or one-tube outages are fea-
sible. This would necessitate an in-service 
sequence of work in only one of the NRT 
tubes at any point in time and refurbishment 
could be undertaken simultaneously in a 
number of locations in the occupied NRT 
tube. Planning should utilise weeknights for 
non-invasive work and weekends for more 
linear, invasive construction work. 
Repair the tunnel lining and seal the leaks 
Replace the mechanical and electrical 
services in the tunnel with new and im-
proved systems 
Replace the High Voltage (HV) cables 
which pass through the tubes 
Demolish the bench walls (which are too 
high and failing) and replace them with new 
walkways and cable containments 
Replace the trackbed, track, and overhead 
catenary 
Replace the signalling system 
2.4.2 Reduce the Service Impacts at the 
Earliest Possible Stage: 
The prioritisation of track, trackbed, and 
overhead line replacement is important in 
planning the NRT Refurbishment, therefore, 
early activities should include: 
Lower 
trackbed, 
Where 
Possible: 
To 
achieve a greater clearance between the 
overhead catenary cable and the train panto-
graph (arm) 
Direct Fixation Trackbed: Replace the ex-
isting traditional ballasted (crushed stone) 
trackbed with a fixed concrete system (di-
rect fixation track) to avoid blocked drains 
and salt-contaminated ballast (that result in 
signal problems) 
Modify or Replace 12.5kV Overhead Line: 
To achieve the full dynamic and electrical 
clearances that are required in the crown of 
the tubes for compliance with standards 
2.4.3
Utilise In-Line Methodologies and 
Sequences for Bench Wall Demolition & Re-
placement: 
LBA have detailed a number of possible 
methodologies for the replacement of the 
NRT bench wall based on benchmark per-
formance information from successful inter-
national projects to provide an emergency 
egress walkway, a maintenance platform for 
railway workers, and locations for the tun-
nel’s electrical/communication cables and 
third-party services, including a precast so-
lution, GRP encasement solution, duct bank 
solution with fire protection, fireproof duct 
solution, and cable in racks only solution. 
All options have their advantages and dis-
advantages, but the fireproof duct solution 
incorporated in a steel cantilevered walkway 
conceptually seems to offer the best poten-
tial ahead of a formal fire risk assessment. 
2.4.4 Utilise modern cable solutions and 
comply with NFPA 130 Fire Life Safety re-
quirements: 
LBA makes recommendations for modern 
cable solutions and an approach to cable 
management and containment based on lay-
ing cables rather than pulling them. Uti-
lizing the longest possible lengths of cable 
reduces joints and joint pits and ultimately 
potential cable failures. High Voltage (HV) 
cables (power cables) and Low Voltage (LV) 
cables (lighting, telephony, fire detection, 
alarm, and communications) may require 
different types of solutions, depending on the 
level of Fire Protection required under the 
NFPA 130 standard. 
LV cable containment systems could in-
clude continuous troughs and cable racking 
with fire protection to emergency circuits 
provided by the direct cable sheathing or a 
sheathing which contains the cable. 
HV cables with intrinsic resistance to fire 
are not available but fire protection may be 
required to protect business continuity as 
the result of a fire risk assessment identi-
fying an unacceptable level or risk. Cables 
could be contained in a number of ways in-
cluding securing to low level cable racks and 
fireproof ducting. Suitable fireproof ducting 
has been identified if required and included 
in the conceptual bench wall replacement 
options. Space constraints are an important 
consideration because the fire resistance is 
dependent on the duct material thickness 
and air gaps are required around the cables 
for cooling. A detailed design would be re-
quired to determine the final solution for the 
duct. 
Protection to all cables and services should 
be provided by derailment protection pro-
vided by guard rails, which sit inside the 
running rails. 
Refurbishment should ensure that the 
emergency egress walkway clearances are 
safe and compliant with NFPA 130 require-
ments. 
2.4.5
Remove the Third Rail: 
LBA believes that the Third Rail should be 
removed because it is not used routinely, 
there are alternatives to its use in an emer-
gency, the cost of installing and maintaining 
is unnecessary, it is an unnecessary com-
plication in safety and emergency proce-
dures, and, if required, the Third Rail can be 
re-installed at the end of construction or an-
other future date. 
2.4.6 Treat the In-Service Refurbishment 
Operation as a System: 
Optimise the overall performance rather 
than maximise component elements of the 
cycle and propose using mechanical meas-
ures where practicable to enhance produc-
tivity and promote innovation, refinement, 
and improvement. 
2.4.7 Utilise Bespoke and Highly Produc-
tive Works Trains & Railhead: 
Battery or hybrid locomotives could be 
used for train rescue and for handling works 
trains for NRT refurbishment. A railhead 
should be constructed to support the activi-
ties within the NRT tubes to service and 
load work trains for the refurbishment. 
2.4.8
Incorporate 
Risk 
Mitigation 
Throughout the Planning of the Refurbish-
ment: 
Mitigations have been implemented suc-
cessfully 
to 
help 
other 
refurbishment 
projects of comparable age, complexity, and 
essentiality. The risk chapter of this report 
identifies specific risks and proposes appro-
priate mitigations. LBA recommends that a 
risk assessment is conducted by the Inte-
grated Work Team, which includes the Gate-
way Partners, to compile and address the 
risks and deficiencies that could occur dur-
ing the refurbishment program.

HONORING THE CAREER OF KEN 
SMITH 
HON. BILLY LONG 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 11, 2021 
Mr. LONG. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the long and storied career of Branson 
West City Administrator Ken Smith. 
Mr. Smith began his tenure in 1998, and 
since then, has worked tirelessly for the peo-
ple of Branson West. As City Administrator, he 
has overseen numerous projects designed to 
improve and expand the city. Shortly after he 
took office, the new Sewer Treatment Plant 
Facility was completed. This facility was de-
signed to meet the needs of the city well into 
the future and has remained in operation, 
ready for the city to continue prospering. He 
has also overseen the expansion of utility lines 
so that the city can provide essential services 
to more properties. In addition to these 
projects, in recent years, sidewalks and 
streetlights have been added along Business 
Highway 13, and a new water tower has been 
approved. 
In October 2010, Branson West Municipal 
Airport was opened. The new airport includes 
a 5000-foot runway, and 10,000 square foot 
maintenance hangar connected to the ter-
minal. There are 39 private T-hangars, all of 
which are occupied, and construction is about 
to begin on 4 larger square hangars. All of this 
allows for a general aviation facility, which 
serves the city and surrounding communities. 
In 2016, the city limits were expanded south 
on Highway 13 to Highway DD. 
All these projects have allowed for commu-
nity growth. New businesses have been drawn 
to the community, and there are more projects 
underway to encourage further business ex-
pansion. The city has also recently acquired 
land for future parks and recreation. Mr. Smith 
has overseen all these projects, and many 
more, during his 23-year tenure as City Ad-
ministrator. 
Madam Speaker, since taking office in 1998, 
Ken Smith has worked every day for the peo-
ple of Branson West. He has led several 
projects and expansions of the city, all de-
signed to improve the community he has so 
enthusiastically served. I wish him, and his 
family a happy retirement.

TRIBUTE TO PAUL JONES 
HON. KEN CALVERT 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 11, 2021 
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor and congratulate Paul D. Jones II 
who will be retiring this spring after a highly 
distinguished career of service in the Cali-
fornia water industry. For over twenty-five 
years, Mr. Jones has been the top executive 
officer for major water agencies in the South-
ern California region. Over the last decade, 
Mr. Jones has served as the General Manager 
for Eastern Municipal Water District (EMWD), 
which serves nearly one million customers in 
western Riverside County. 
During his tenure at EMWD, Mr. Jones has 
been widely recognized for his leadership in 
elevating Eastern to one of the most re-
spected and forward-thinking water, waste-
water and recycled water agencies in the na-
tion. Mr. Jones played an instrumental role in 
notable accomplishments for EMWD, such as 
the agency’s achievement of 100 percent ben-
eficial reuse of its recycled water supplies, the 
initiation of its potable reuse program, and the 
spearheading of key infrastructure investments 
which will provide safe and reliable services 
for future generations. Under Paul’s direction,

EMWD was able to substantially expand the 
agency’s desalination program creating a new 
local water source for its residents. The fed-
eral and state funding secured for this initiative 
resulted in the construction of the South Perris 
Desalter project, which will produce 6,000 
acre-feet per year of potable water. 
Mr. Jones was also a leading advocate for 
transforming the Bureau of Reclamation’s Title 
XVI recycled water funding program into a 
competitive grant program—a goal which was 
realized through the enactment of the Water 
Infrastructure Investment for the Nation (WIIN) 
Act 
in 
2016. 
While 
President 
of 
the 
WateReuse Association, Mr. Jones helped to 
develop the nation’s first ever federal Water 
Reuse Action Plan which formally launched in 
February 2020. During California’s historic 
drought, Mr. Jones worked with other state 
water leaders to create a more equitable sys-
tem that rewarded proactive water use effi-
ciency measures. In addition, Paul has led the 
way in California for a more viable alternative 
to assist failing water systems without the 
need for a statewide tax on all water users. 
On the local level, Mr. Jones has played a 
key role in a local agency partnership to trans-
form the area near Diamond Valley Lake into 
an environmentally sustainable recreational 
area. In addition, on behalf of EMWD Mr. 
Jones has made innumerable contributions at 
the Metropolitan Water District of Southern 
California, the Santa Ana Watershed Project 
Authority, the Association of California Water 
Agencies, the Southern California Water Coali-
tion, and the California WateReuse Associa-
tion. I would like to thank Paul Jones for his 
service to the community and water industry 
and wish him much happiness in his retire-
ment.

CONGRATULATING 
ARKANSAS 
STATE TROOPER JAMES O. RAY 
ON BEING NAMED AS AMERICAN 
ASSOCIATIONS OF STATE TROOP-
ERS TROOPER OF THE YEAR 
HON. BRUCE WESTERMAN 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 11, 2021 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate Arkansas State Trooper 
James O. Ray on being named the 2021 
American 
Association 
of 
State 
Troopers 
Trooper of the Year. A three-year veteran of 
the Arkansas State Police Highway Patrol Di-
vision and Franklin County resident, Officer 
Ray exemplifies service beyond the call of 
duty and represents the finest of Arkansas’ 
Fourth District. 
Officer Ray was granted this honor following 
his courageous action in December 2020 in 
which his wise response to a dangerous 
chase prevented catastrophic damage and in-
jury to the public. After responding to a call to 
support a fellow trooper along Interstate 40 
near Ozark, Officer Ray followed a suspect 
vehicle at speeds exceeding 100 miles per 
hour. The suspect later crossed the median, 
driving toward oncoming traffic. Officer Ray 
drove ahead of the suspect in the opposite 
lane, stopped traffic to protect motorists be-
hind him, and then rammed the front corner of 
the suspect vehicle. Once both vehicles were 
in the median, Trooper Ray safely arrested the 
suspect, with no injuries to the suspect or any 
other motorist. 
I take this time today to congratulate Troop-
er Ray on this most deserving honor and 
thank him for his exemplary service to the 
people of the State of Arkansas. May we al-
ways look to officers like him as the picture of 
true heroism.

HONORING MR. JAMES TOBIN 
HON. ELISSA SLOTKIN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 11, 2021 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Mr. James J. Tobin—a man who 
dedicated almost 40 years of his life to the 
automotive industry before retiring at the end 
of last year. 
In the close-knit community of auto manu-
facturing, Mr. Tobin was a model of integrity, 
leadership, and hard work. As an executive 
with Magna International, the world’s largest 
supplier for vehicles and automobiles, he was 
integral to strategic planning for an ever- 
changing landscape. 
That knack for adapting—the ability to inno-
vate as an industry leader while having the 
flexibility of someone helming a start-up—was 
instrumental when the first wave of COVID–19 
hit our state last March. 
Working closely with the State of Michigan, 
Oakland County, and my office, Mr. Tobin 
helped retool Magna’s global supply chains to 
secure PPE for our frontline workers. His ex-
pertise with logistics and operations helped 
overcome challenges by bridging the gap be-
tween Asian and North American markets. 
Whether it was supporting domestic produc-
tion of gowns, face shields and ventilators, or 
coordinating meals to local health care work-
ers, Mr. Tobin stepped up when folks needed 
it most. 
The open dialogue and communication be-
tween his team and ours brought essential 
supplies and equipment to the front lines of 
the pandemic. 
I am ever-grateful to have had him as a 
partner in our efforts. There is no doubt in my 
mind that lives in Michigan were saved be-
cause of Mr. Tobin and the folks at Magna. 
Now, as he enjoys his well-earned retire-
ment, I am wishing him all the best. He de-
serves the R&R but, knowing him, I’m certain 
he’ll continue to give back—as a loving hus-
band and father of three and as a dedicated 
role model in the community. 
It’s my privilege to recognize him on the 
floor of the People’s House so his achieve-
ments and contributions can forever live on.

HONORING FORMER AMBASSADOR 
AHMET SHALA 
HON. C.A. DUTCH RUPPERSBERGER 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 11, 2021 
Mr. RUPPERSBERGER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to congratulate and honor the first 
Minister of Finance for the Republic of Kosovo 
and former Kosovo Ambassador to Japan, Mr. 
Ahmet Shala, on earning his Doctor of Philos-
ophy in Strategic Leadership from James 
Madison University. 
Mr. Shala was one of the first entrepreneurs 
to establish his own business in Kosovo, 
where he founded The Cambridge School, 
which is considered one of the leading institu-
tions for English Language Teaching in 
Kosovo. 
Mr. Shala began his career in public service 
when he was named the Deputy Managing Di-
rector at the Kosovo Trust Agency, where he 
was responsible for directing and managing 
the privatization of Kosovo’s socially-owned 
enterprises. He later became the co-head of 
the Department of Trade and Industry, where 
he developed strategies and procedures for 
commercialization, again helping to transform 
Kosovo’s socially-owned enterprises into pri-
vate-sector development. 
After being named the first Minister of Econ-
omy and Finance for the Republic of Kosovo 
in 2008, Mr. Shala laid the building blocks of 
the country’s current economic system and 
successfully coordinated Kosovo’s member-
ship to the World Bank and the International 
Monetary Fund in 2009. Mr. Shala ran the 
Ministry of Finance until 2012, when he was 
appointed Kosovo’s Ambassador to Japan. 
After serving as Ambassador, Mr. Shala 
continued his service to the international com-
munity as a lecturer and professor in Euro-
pean and American educational institutions 
such as the London School of Economics, 
James Madison University and Harvard Uni-
versity. 
Since losing family and friends to the horrific 
war crimes committed during the Kosovo War, 
he has been an avid human rights advocate 
and works to provide a voice for those facing 
oppression by expanding access to doctoral 
and master’s program opportunities. At James 
Madison University, Mr. Shala has worked to 
ease tensions in the Balkan region by improv-
ing the quality of education in Kosovo and by 
partnering Kosovar students with high-impact 
graduate programs in the United States. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me today to honor Former Ambassador Shala 
for his academic accomplishments along with 
his distinguished service to Kosovo, the United 
States and the global community.

IN REMEMBRANCE OF IRENE B. 
WEST 
HON. DORIS O. MATSUI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 11, 2021 
Ms. MATSUI. Madam Speaker, it is with 
profound sadness that I rise to honor the life 
of beloved Sacramentan Irene B. West, Re-
tired Principal of the Elk Grove Unified School 
District, City of Elk Grove, County of Sac-
ramento, California. Mrs. West entered eternal 
rest on Wednesday, April 21, 2021 at the age 
of 88. I ask all my colleagues to join me in 
honoring Mrs. West. 
Mrs. West was a beloved California educa-
tor, community leader, activist, and devoted 
mother, grandmother, and great grandmother. 
She was a longtime and very active member 
of one of California’s historic religious institu-
tions, Shiloh Baptist Church. Mrs. West was a 
supporter of, mentor and friend to many. The 
citizens of the Sacramento area benefitted

greatly from her passion and love for edu-
cating our students; her dedicated service 
made our community and State better. 
Mrs. West was born July 3, 1932 in Crow-
ley, Louisiana and was reared in Orange, 
Texas during the height of the Great Depres-
sion, a time when the racial climate in America 
was even more depressing for African Ameri-
cans. Knowing the importance of education, 
she graduated valedictorian in her high school 
class in Texas. She then enrolled in under-
graduate studies at the historic Fisk University 
at Nashville, Tennessee where she would 
meet her late husband, Clifton L. West, Jr. 
The couple relocated, in 1958, to McClellan 
Air Force Base in Sacramento where her hus-
band was stationed. Mrs. West completed her 
education by earning a Bachelor of Arts de-
gree from California State University at Sac-
ramento and a Master of Arts from the Univer-
sity of San Francisco. 
In 1962, before completing her under-
graduate studies, Mrs. West took on a seem-
ingly insurmountable challenge, being hired as 
a teacher in the all-white student and faculty 
Elk Grove Unified School District. This marked 
the embarking upon a barrier-breaking 27-year 
career in education. She quickly rose through 
the ranks in teaching and administration to the 
position of Principal in 1979, a position in 
which she served for ten years. Although she 
retired in 1989, she remained a very active re-
spected presence in and around the Elk 
Grove-Sacramento community well into her 
80s. 
Despite her demanding career and devotion 
to serving others, Mrs. West’s four children did 
not lack in parental love, nurturing and edu-
cational guidance. All her children excelled in 
academia, sports, or both, two of whom hav-
ing achieved professorship at prestigious uni-
versities, and another is an accomplished Zoo 
linguist. 
A partial list of awards and recognitions 
marking Mrs. West’s achievements include 
educational awards and citations such as 
Teacher of the year; newspaper awards which 
included the 1963 Mother of the Year (her 
most endearing recognition); awards from All-
state Insurance, Shiloh Baptist Church, Sac-
ramento Council of Negro Women, Sac-
ramento Chapter of 100 Black Women; in 
1979, first female principal in the Elk Grove 
Unified School District; and, in 2002, the first 
African American in Sacramento to have a 
school, Irene B. West Elementary, named in 
her honor. 
Madam Speaker, today as family and 
friends of Mrs. Irene B. West gather to re-
member her, I ask my colleagues to join me 
in honoring her tremendous legacy of educa-
tor, encourager, and motivator. Her mark on 
the Sacramento area community will live on 
forever.

IN RECOGNITION OF TAYLOR 
WARE 
HON. LAUREN UNDERWOOD 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 11, 2021 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to recognize Taylor Ware for her service in my 
office in Washington, D.C. 
Taylor joined our office as a legislative cor-
respondent at the beginning of the coronavirus 
pandemic. As our office pivoted to remote 
work and worked 24/7 to respond to the mas-
sive increase in constituents reaching out with 
questions or for assistance, Taylor played an 
integral role. Among other accomplishments, 
she drafted hundreds of letters updating con-
stituents on policy changes, made sure every 
incoming message was promptly referred for a 
response, and solely managed a detailed and 
high-volume correspondence system. Taylor 
truly went above and beyond in managing 
constituent correspondence, fulfilling my com-
mitment to transparency and accountability 
and elevating constituent concerns so we 
could bring them directly to Administration offi-
cials. Taylor also worked to improve diversity, 
equity, and inclusion in Congress through her 
role leading Legislative Branch appropriations 
for the office for Fiscal Year 2022. 
Taylor’s thoughtfulness, graciousness, and 
professionalism were invaluable assets as we 
worked to keep our community safe, healthy, 
and informed in this unprecedented year. I 
particularly want to recognize her efforts to 
support and mentor interns in our office, who 
relied on her for answers and guidance. Al-
though Taylor may be leaving our office, our 
community in northern Illinois and my entire 
staff will continue to benefit from the results of 
her hard work and expertise. 
Prior to joining my staff, Taylor earned a 
Bachelor’s degree from Pennsylvania State 
University and a Master’s degree from Wash-
ington University in St. Louis. I am grateful 
she chose to continue her career in public 
service by joining my office. Our office will 
miss her kindness, intelligence, sense of 
humor, and love of bizarre Jell-O recipes. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to formally 
thank Taylor Ware for her service to my office, 
to Illinois’s 14th Congressional District, and to 
our country.

THE COMMUNITY BROADBAND ACT 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 11, 2021 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I’m proud to 
sponsor 
H.R. 
1631, 
the 
Community 
Broadband Act, a bicameral bill that empowers 
communities in every state to bridge the digital 
divide by deploying their own local broadband 
networks. 
Tens of millions of Americans lack access to 
broadband or can’t afford it. This digital divide 
is a national embarrassment, and we must do 
everything we can to solve it. One part of the 
solution should be community broadband, a 
proven model that works to provide fast 
broadband at affordable speeds to millions of 
Americans today. 
Over 900 municipalities, Tribes, co-ops, 
public-private partnerships, and nonprofits 
across the U.S. administer broadband net-
works in their own communities. These are 
communities in urban, suburban, rural, and 
Tribal regions of our country spanning 120 
Congressional Districts. 
Unfortunately, 22 states have enacted laws 
to limit or ban such networks. These state 
laws shield incumbents from competition and 
harm consumers. Importantly, research by 
New America’s Open Technology Institute 
shows that community broadband produces 
higher quality service at lower costs. 
For this reason, Senator CORY BOOKER, 
Representative JARED GOLDEN, and I intro-
duced the Community Broadband Act which 
preempts protectionist state laws to enable 
community 
broadband. 
The 
Community 
Broadband Act was originally introduced in the 
109th Congress by Senators Lautenberg and 
McCain, and I’ve been proud to carry this leg-
islation with Senator BOOKER since the 114th 
Congress. 
The Community Broadband Act is supported 
by a long list of well-respected organizations, 
including the National League of Cities; the 
National Association of Counties; Next Cen-
tury Cities; the Southern California Tribal 
Chairmen’s 
Association; 
National 
Urban 
League; Consumer Reports; Electronic Fron-
tier Foundation; New America’s Open Tech-
nology Institute; Public Knowledge; Free Press 
Action; the Center for Democracy & Tech-
nology; Access Now; the National Digital Inclu-
sion Alliance; National Rural Electric Coopera-
tive Association; the Utilities Technology 
Council; the Institute for Local Self-Reliance; 
and the Coalition for Local Internet Choice. 
Last Congress, the House passed the Com-
munity Broadband Act as part of H.R. 2, the 
Moving Forward Act. The legislation is in-
cluded in H.R. 1783, Majority Whip CLYBURN’s 
Accessible, Affordable Internet for All Act and 
H.R. 1848, the Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee’s LIFT America Act, and I thank Whip 
CLYBURN and Chairman PALLONE for including 
my legislation in theirs. 
I’m also very pleased that the Biden-Harris 
Administration’s American Jobs Plan proposal 
includes the need for ‘‘lifting barriers that pre-
vent municipally-owned or affiliated providers 
and rural electric co-ops from competing on an 
even playing field with private providers,’’ 
which can be achieved by enacting the Com-
munity Broadband Act. 
At a recent hearing of the Energy and Com-
merce Committee’s Subcommittee on Commu-
nications and Technology, three witnesses 
made a strong case for the importance of 
community broadband, and each endorsed the 
Community Broadband Act. They testified 
about successful networks of many types that 
I wish to recognize as well: 
The City of Wilson, North Carolina, operates 
a successful fiber-to-the-home network for its 
residents. The City of San Rafael, California 
partnered with a nonprofit to develop a mesh 
network to provide free wi-fi to residents. 
EugNet is an open-access network in Eugene, 
Oregon that has experienced major societal 
returns to their investment in a community net-
work. The Navajo Tribal Utility Authority is a 
highly successful Tribal broadband network. 
The City of Lafayette, Louisiana launched LUS 
Fiber 
to 
offer 
affordable, 
high-speed 
broadband for all of its residents. The City of 
Chattanooga, Tennessee, invested in a fiber 
network in 2009. That network isn’t just eco-
nomically viable, it turns a profit for the city 
even after offering low prices. 
I also wish to recognize two community net-
works in my California’s 18th Congressional 
District. A group of residents of the City of Los 
Altos Hills formed a mutual benefit organiza-
tion called the Los Altos Hills Community Fiber 
Association to offer high-speed internet where 
other fiber options are sparse. The City of 
Palo was a pioneer when it became one of the 
first cities in our country to deploy a dark fiber 
network in 1996. This has enabled high-quality

HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF 
MS. BONNIE BRUESHOFF 
HON. ANGIE CRAIG 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 11, 2021 
Ms. CRAIG. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the career of Ms. Bonnie Brueshoff, Di-
rector for the Dakota County Public Health De-
partment located in West St. Paul, Minnesota, 
who is retiring after 27 years of service and 
dedication to the public health efforts of Min-
nesota. 
Throughout her career, Ms. Brueshoff exhib-
ited a commitment to bettering our community 
by chairing numerous health official boards, 
such as the National Association of County 
and City Health Officials. Time and time again, 
she contributed her expertise on both a state 
and national level to molding the next genera-
tion of public health practitioners. With her 
leadership, in 2019, the Dakota County Public 
Health Department was nationally recognized 
for its innovative initiatives to promote health 
awareness in our state. 
As we continue to persevere through these 
unprecedented times, we must never forget to 
recognize our heroes at the forefront of the 
fight against COVID–19. Ms. Brueshoff, along-
side so many others, exemplifies the true 
meaning of public service in the realm of civic 
wellness. Her career is a testament to the 
character of our district and our determination 
to assist those in need. 
I rise on behalf of the 2nd Congressional 
district of Minnesota, expressing my deepest 
gratitude to her commitment to the health of 
our community. She created a legacy I know 
many hope to emulate. I congratulate Ms. 
Brueshoff for her many years of leadership 
and wish her the best as she embarks on her 
well-deserved retirement. 
HONORING HOWELL HIGH SCHOOL 
SENIOR SURVIVORS 
HON. ELISSA SLOTKIN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 11, 2021 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the 16 graduating seniors from 
Howell High School who recently participated 
as contestants in the 14th annual ‘‘Senior Sur-
vivor’’ fundraiser. 
I’m thrilled to honor Gage Altrock, Felicia 
Berendt, Nicole Caudy, Jackson Dukes, Lucas 
Gonzalez, Olivia Gray, Alyssa Johnson, David 
Johnston, Julia Jolly, Ryan Lane, Danny 
Maura, Zach Metz, Taylor Newstead, Alaina 
Schrock, and Molly Tucker—as well as the 
winner of this year’s Senior Survivor: Morgan 
Pasini. 
For a full week, these students lived at 
Howell High, collecting money and competing 
against each other in reward and immunity 
challenges that included scavenger hunts, triv-
ia challenges, and cake-baking contests. This 
year’s Senior Survivors were put to the test— 
not just to prove who could outwit, outlast, and 
outplay their fellow competitors—but also by 
the extraordinary circumstances they each 
have faced in adapting to a school year af-
fected by COVID–19. 
Each Senior Survivor was supported by a 
Junior Survivor from the 5th grade classes at 
Howell’s elementary schools. These Junior 
Survivors led a coin drive in their schools to 
benefit their respective seniors. 
Together, Howell students raised a whop-
ping $220,427—which will go towards building 
an inclusive playground for children of all abili-
ties at Genoa Township Park. 
This playground, which will be named the 
Senior Survivor Playground, will let kids play 
together in a natural environment in order to 
develop physical, imagination, and problem- 
solving skills through self-directed play. To-
gether with its nationally-recognized Unified 
Sports program, it’s just one more example of 
the Howell community’s steadfast commitment 
to including students with disabilities and spe-
cial needs. 
None of it could have been possible without 
the 16 seniors who came together to raise 
money for a noble cause. Over the years, 
Senior Survivors have raised more than 
$760,000 for various charities. It is why I have 
the great privilege of recognizing them on the 
floor of the People’s House—so that their self-
less service to others may be forever known.

HONORING ASCENSION MATA, SR. 
HON. FILEMON VELA 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 11, 2021 
Mr. VELA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
extend my sincerest congratulations to Mr. 
Ascencion Mata, Sr., who celebrates his 100th 
birthday on Wednesday, May 12, 2021. 
Ascencion Mata, Sr. was born in 1921, in 
San Benito, Texas, the eighth child of the late 
Manuel and Isidora Mata. Ascension’s parents 
instilled in him the values of religious devotion, 
honesty, resilience, and hard work at a young 
age, and his resilience pushed him to travel 
four miles every day to attend Sebastian Ele-
mentary School. While the pursuit of knowl-
edge has always been a priority for Ascencion 
and his family, he was only able to receive a 
second-grade education. Although his aca-
demic time was cut short, his hardworking 
mindset propelled him forward as he spent his 
childhood on the farm and in the fields with his 
father to help provide for his family. 
In 1937, when Ascencion was just sixteen 
years old, his father passed away, leaving his 
mother a widow and sole provider for him and 
his seven siblings. Ascencion continued to 
work to ensure his family persevered. 
Ascencion married the love of his life, Eloise 
De La Rosa, in 1942. They were faithfully 
married for 53 years until Eloise’s passing in 
2003. Over the years, they were blessed with 
six children: Ascencion Mata Jr., Vincente 
Mata, Guadalupe Mata, Celia Mata Delgado, 
Roberto Mata, and Janie Linda Mata Cantu; 
seven grandchildren; and eight great-grand-
children. As doting parents, Ascencion and 
Eloise created a nurturing environment built on 
a solid faith in their love for God that would 
become the moral foundation for their children, 
grandchildren, and a host of other family 
members throughout their lives. 
In addition to being a committed family man, 
Ascencion is also a proud Veteran who served 
his country during World War II. After he was 
drafted, he was assigned to an Army base in 
Salt Lake City, Utah where he spent one 
month in basic training. He was then assigned 
to an Army base in Lincoln, Nebraska, where 
he received an additional eight months of 
training. After completion of his training 
Ascencion was sent to New York, where he 
was preparing to sail overseas to join the 
Armed Forces in Germany. However, on No-
vember 9, 1943, Ascencion was honorably 
discharged from the United Stated Army be-
cause he did not meet the Army’s education 
requirement, which at the time was a sixth- 
grade education level. After he was dis-
charged, Ascencion returned to his home in 
Sebastian, TX where he worked various jobs 
including managing a field crew, working at 
Alberti’s Seafood Packing shed in Harlingen, 
Texas for about 12 years, and at La Feria 
Water Irrigation District for many years until 
his retirement. During that time, he purchased 
20 acres of land near Santa Rosa, TX, that he 
and his family used to cultivate cotton and sor-
ghum crops. 
Today, Ascencion lives near Sebastian, 
where he continues to uphold the same values 
of resilience, faith, honesty, and hard work 
that have allowed him to live a long and ful-
filling life with his family. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in congratu-
lating Ascencion Mata, Sr., on 100 years of 
life, service, and dedication to his community 
and country, and wish him continued happi-
ness surrounded by loved ones.

RECOGNIZING DIANNE GREFF FOR 
HER LIFETIME OF SERVICE AS A 
PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHER AND 
NORTH JERSEY COUNCIL PRESI-
DENT OF THE NAVY LEAGUE OF 
THE UNITED STATES 
HON. MIKIE SHERRILL 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 11, 2021 
Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Speaker, l rise to 
recognize Dianne Greff, public school teacher 
and North Jersey Council President of the 
Navy League of the United States, for her life-
time of service to her students, her commu-
nity, and to New Jersey. 
Dianne’s commitment to service began 
when she was 18 years old, when she en-
rolled at William Paterson University in 
Wayne, New Jersey, to study education and 
fulfill her dream of being a public school 
teacher. Upon her graduation in 1959, Dianne 
set off on her 40-year career as an educator, 
helping to shape the lives of thousands of 
New Jersey students. She was awarded the 
New Jersey Governor’s Teacher of the Year 
Award before retiring in the early 2000s. 
Dianne’s impact on Passaic County ex-
tended beyond education. As President of the 
North Jersey Council of the United States 
Navy League, she worked to support Amer-
ica’s Navy service members. The Navy 
League aids military families while spouses or 
parents are deployed, honors enlisted per-
sonnel, and adopts ships and shore com-
mands. While Dianne was president of the 
New Jersey chapter, there were over 300 ac-
tive members. 
Later in life, Dianne committed herself to 
helping our seniors. She was elected the 
President of the Saint Mary’s Active Senior 
Ministry in Pompton Lakes, New Jersey. She 
also served on the Board of Trustees for the 
Golden Age Circle of Wayne, and advised the 
Mayor as a member of his Wayne Township 
Senior Citizen Advisory Committee. 
There was never a moment in Dianne’s life 
when she wasn’t trying her hardest to help 
other people. Whether for students, service 
members, veterans, seniors, or immigrants, 
Dianne went the extra mile to help them 
achieve their dreams or have a good life. 
Dianne passed away on January 29, 2021. 
Her legacy will live on in all of the lives she 
touched in Passaic County and across New 
Jersey. The world is a kinder, better place be-
cause of Dianne Greff.

HONORING CAPTAIN BREANNA L. 
KNUTSON 
HON. STEVEN M. PALAZZO 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 11, 2021 
Mr. PALAZZO. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the outstanding service of Captain 
Breanna Knutson. 
CAPT Breanna Knutson currently serves as 
the House of Representatives Liaison Officer 
for the Coast Guard. She ensures the Coast 
Guard’s prompt response to the House’s 435 
members and staffs by coordinating and con-
ducting policy briefs, preparing senior Coast 
Guard leaders for Congressional hearings and 
engagements, and planning and leading Con-
gressional delegations to Coast Guard units 
throughout the country. 
She previously served as The Chief Pilot 
and Operations Officer of Coast Guard Air 
Station Detroit where she directed the oper-
ations of 5 MH–65 Dolphin helicopters, 26 pi-
lots and 35 air crew members in the conduct 
of Search and Rescue missions on the Great 
Lakes from the St. Lawrence Seaway to east-
ern Lake Michigan. 
CAPT Knutson’s first operational assign-
ment was as a deck watch officer aboard 
USCGC MOHAWK in Key West, Florida. Fol-
lowing this assignment, CAPT Knutson was 
selected for Naval Flight Training in Pensa-
cola, Florida and began flight school the sum-
mer of 2001. She earned her wings in the fall 
of 2002. 
In 2007 she earned a dual qualification in 
the Rotary Wing Air Intercept mission and de-
ployed to the National Capitol Region ten 
times supporting National Security missions. In 
2010 CAPT Knutson was assigned to the 
Coast Guard’s Helicopter Interdiction Tactical 
Squadron in Jacksonville, Florida where she 
conducted Airborne Use of Force—Counter 
Drug missions, deploying aboard four Coast 
Guard cutters in the Eastern Pacific Ocean 
and Western Caribbean Sea. 
In 2014 CAPT Knutson was selected as the 
Executive Assistant to the Director of Depart-
ment of Homeland Security, Joint Task 
Force—East, the first ever Joint Task Force of 
its kind. In this capacity she supported the Di-
rector and Executive Leadership in executing 
the foundational processes of standing up a 
new unit tasked with improving the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security’s ability to operate 
as a unified team. 
CAPT Knutson graduated from the United 
States Coast Guard Academy in 1999 with a 
Bachelor of Science degree in Management. 
She holds a Master of Arts degree in Human 
Resources Management from American Mili-
tary University. 
CAPT Breanna Knutson is a true American 
who chose to answer the call to serve our 
country. It is an honor to recognize her incred-
ible service history that is a true depiction of 
her dedication to the United States Coast 
Guard. I wish her the best as she continues 
her service as Commanding Officer of Sector 
North Bend, Oregon. 
IN HONOR OF KEN WHITE 
HON. JACKIE SPEIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 11, 2021 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker I rise today 
to recognize Ken White, the recently retired 
Executive Director of the Peninsula Humane 
Society. As Mr. White noted, he was retiring 
on his 469th birthday, as measured in dog 
years. He joined the Peninsula Humane Soci-
ety in 2002 and his successes at this organi-
zation have been historic for this beloved or-
ganization. 
Upon his arrival, Ken White and the Penin-
sula Humane Society guaranteed a home to 
every adoptable dog or cat in their care, a 
promise they have kept ever since. In 2003 
the organization expanded its promise to in-
clude as many ill and injured and behaviorally 
challenged pets as possible. In 2005, the Hu-
mane Society purchased a mobile veterinary 
clinic and provided spay/neutering surgeries 
for animals in some of the most underserved 
communities in the county. 
More than 22,000 households contribute to 
the work of the Peninsula Humane Society. 
The euthanasia rate has decreased 98 per-
cent since 1970. 1200 volunteers allow PHS 
to function as an integral part of our commu-
nity. 
In 2006, Ken and his board bought an old 
Burlingame warehouse. Through a major gift 
and the loving care of volunteers, they were 
able to open this facility as the Center for 
Compassion to house charitably funded pro-
grams through state-of-the-art facilities. The 
progress is amazing. When Ken arrived in our 
community, the percentage of animals re-
leased live back into the community was 53 
percent. Today, it is 89 percent. There are 
tens of thousands of peninsula animals who 
found their forever-home thanks to the kind 
heart and amazing fundraising talents of Ken 
White. 
Not content to be an over-achieving humane 
organization, Ken, his board, employees and 
volunteers have set a reach goal. The organi-
zation now owns 260 acres of land in San 
Mateo County which will be turned into an ani-
mal sanctuary. It will be the first in our nation 
owned and operated by a humane society. 
Ken has seen a tortoise survive being driv-
en over by a vehicle, and today that tortoise 
thrives as Ken’s pet. He watched a falcon be 
released into the wild after severe injuries 
were healed. Reptiles have been visitors to his 
home. He and his apparently patient wife, 
Carolyn Crane, have also taken in a pot-bel-
lied pig and an Argentinian homed frog. If 
there was a wild party at Ken’s home and the 
noise ever got to be too much, I’m sure there 
was always a pet or two that was more than 
willing to lay down the law to Ken. 
Ken White got into the business of running 
animal shelters from an unusual background. 
He holds a Master’s Degree in creative writ-
ing. After a series of jobs, he was eventually 
invited to create educational materials for a 
local shelter. As a child he was never allowed 
to own a pet, but then as a young man he 
was suddenly surrounded by animals. It was 
love at first sight. 
As he leaves his longtime position, he goes 
out on a national high note. The 260 acre 
sanctuary in the San Mateo County mountains

will be for medically or behaviorally challenged 
dogs and cats with low adoption rates. This fa-
cility will be a huge step forward for those that 
are able to live out a full life, but without trou-
blesome humans and their nitpicking rules as 
preconditions. So goes the dream of San 
Mateo County’s Dr. Doolittle, the man who 
talks to our animals. I have long admired Ken 
White for his ingenuity and can-do spirit. The 
San Mateo community and I wish him well as 
he leaves his avid fans, of all breeds, behind. 
Undoubtedly there’s a movie about Ken that 
will someday be released on Netflix: Ken 
White: Lifesaver, Tortoise Daddy and Snake 
Whisperer. Watch for it, streaming soon.

IN SUPPORT OF H.R. 2862, THE 
CAMPAIGN TO PREVENT SUICIDE 
ACT, AND H.R. 2981, THE SUICIDE 
PREVENTION 
LIFELINE 
IM-
PROVEMENT ACT OF 2021 
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 11, 2021 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today in support of two pieces of legisla-
tion, H.R. 2862, the Campaign to Prevent Sui-
cide Act, and H.R. 2981, the Suicide Preven-
tion Lifeline Improvement Act of 2021—both of 
which make critical investments to support sui-
cide prevention efforts nationwide. 
Rising suicide rates across the country, and 
especially in my home state of Texas, rep-
resent a growing concern in our communities. 
According to the Hogg Foundation for Mental 
Health, Texas suicide rates have risen nearly 
26 percent since 2000—and are the second 
leading cause of death for Texans aged 15 to 
34. The cost of inaction on this issue is too 
high, and that is why I am encouraged that we 
are voting on these pieces of legislation today. 
H.R. 2862, the Campaign to Prevent Suicide 
Act, will direct the Department of Health and 
Human Services (HHS) to carry out a national 
suicide prevention campaign. This campaign 
would include advocacy for an effort that I led 
last Congress, which would redesignate the 
National Suicide Prevention Hotline as a 
three-digit 9–8–8 number. This effort, which 
would shorten the previous 1-800 number, is 
an essential step towards simplifying access 
to critical resources for our constituents in 
their times of need. 
H.R. 2981, the Suicide Prevention Lifeline 
Improvement Act of 2021, would further re-
quire HHS to develop a plan to ensure high- 
quality service through the National Suicide 
Prevention Hotline. Beyond a strategic plan, 
the bill would authorize additional funding for 
a network of local crisis centers that provide 
free support and assistance to those strug-
gling with suicidal thoughts. 
Madam Speaker, the passage of these two 
bills would have immediate and tremendous 
benefits—and could ultimately save lives. That 
is why I will support these bills, and why I urge 
their immediate consideration and passage in 
the Senate.

HIS 
RETIREMENT 
AS 
CHAIRMAN 
OF 
THE 
DAUPHIN 
COUNTY 
BOARD 
OF 
COMMIS-
SIONERS 
HON. SCOTT PERRY 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 11, 2021 
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
commend, congratulate, and profusely thank 
Mr. Jeff Haste, upon the occasion of his retire-
ment as Chairman of the Dauphin County 
Board of Commissioners. 
Few public servants have been as effective 
and innovative as Jeff Haste. When he be-
came the Chairman in 2003, he took bold 
steps to cut costs and put county government 
on a path to fiscal responsibility, and held the 
line on taxes for an unprecedented ten straight 
years. 
A conservative and pragmatic leader, Jeff 
consistently sought ways to support private 
sector growth. He established the first-of-its- 
kind infrastructure and land bank, to fund crit-
ical local projects, fight blight, and stimulate 
economic growth. He also saved the Harris-
burg Sports and Outdoor Show—a major eco-
nomic and tourism driver for the region—by 
securing a new producer and making the 
show the most successful to date. 
As a testament to his leadership and initia-
tive as county commissioner, Jeff was named 
the Harrisburg Regional Chamber (CCAP)’s 
Government Leader of the Year in 2006 and 
2011. He also was awarded the CCAP 2016 
Outstanding Commissioner of the Year, the 
National 
Association 
of 
Counties 
2014 
Achievement Award in the category of com-
munity/economic development, the Pennsyl-
vania Economic Development Association 
President’s Award for the Dauphin County In-
frastructure Bank, and the Harrisburg River-
boat Society 2013 Award for Distinguished 
Community Service, among myriad other ac-
colades, commendations, and recognitions. 
An avid outdoorsman and open space advo-
cate, Jeff helped Dauphin County preserve al-
most 15,000 acres of farmland since 1992, 
under a program that began when he was 
chief clerk. 
He also served as CCAP’s 2014 president, 
representing all 67 counties in Pennsylvania, 
before becoming Chairman of the Board in 
2015. He was Chairman of the Susquehanna 
Township Recreation Board in 2001, and 
served on the Township’s zoning hearing 
board. In 2012, he was appointed to the Gov-
ernor’s Advisory Council for Hunting, Fishing, 
and Conservation. 
Jeff, also active in the Boy Scouts, coaches 
youth soccer and baseball, and is involved 
with many other community and professional 
organizations. After graduating in 1977 from 
Lewistown Area High School, he attended 
Shippensburg University, and graduated in 
1981 with a Bachelor’s degree in Administra-
tion of Justice and Law Enforcement, while 
serving as class president all four years, and 
earning Dean’s List honors. Jeff is a devoted 
husband to his wife, Maria, father of four, and 
grandfather of three. 
Once again, on behalf of the Citizens of the 
10th Congressional District, I’m honored to 
congratulate and sincerely thank Commis-
sioner Jeff Haste for his tireless, dedicated, 
and selfless service to the County of Dauphin, 
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and the 
United States of America, and I wish him God-
speed on his future.

HONORING 
THE 
100TH 
ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE FOUNDING OF THE 
TAYLOR, TEXAS ROTARY CLUB 
HON. JOHN R. CARTER 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 11, 2021 
Mr. CARTER of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
I’m proud to honor and celebrate the Taylor 
Rotary Club’s century of extraordinary service. 
Founded on May 10, 1921 by twenty-five char-
ter members, the Club has made lasting and 
monumental contributions toward making Cen-
tral Texas a great place to call home. 
Throughout their century of service, the 
Club has helped where help is needed—in 
their own communities and around the world— 
with unmatched integrity and energy. When 
the Taylor Rotary Club gets involved, prob-
lems get smaller and communities get better. 
The Club has been instrumental in the cre-
ation of public parks, Taylor’s first Boy Scout 
organization, 
and 
numerous 
philanthropic 
campaigns. Their continued participation in the 
Baylor Scott and White Blood Drive, Shep-
herd’s Heart Food Pantry, Meals on Wheels, 
and numerous college and vocational scholar-
ships to local students show the Taylor Rotary 
Club truly lives out its motto of ‘‘Service Above 
Self.’’ 
A century after its creation, the Taylor Ro-
tary Club has touched countless lives for the 
better and continues to make positive impacts 
on those it’s dedicated to serve. I celebrate 
100 years of incredible civic involvement and 
join all Central Texas in wishing this great or-
ganization nothing but the best in the decades 
to come.

RECOGNIZING OFFICER ERIC 
TALLEY 
HON. KEN BUCK 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 11, 2021 
Mr. BUCK. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize a hero who made the ultimate sac-
rifice for his community. On March 22, Officer 
Eric Talley courageously confronted a gunman 
in the Boulder King Soopers. By racing to the 
scene and not hesitating to directly confront 
the armed suspect, Officer Talley undoubtedly 
saved countless lives. His heroic actions and 
remarkable bravery stand as a stark reminder 
of the danger that law enforcement officers 
face every time they pin on their badge. 
Good people like Officer Talley represent 
the best of America. He was deeply committed 
to his faith, his family, and his community. He 
saw a need in his community and felt so 
strongly that he could contribute to his com-
munity that he made a mid-career change to 
serve as a member of the Boulder Police De-
partment. His deeply held convictions are ad-
mirable, and his sacrifice deserves com-
mendations that our human institutions are un-
able to offer. Colorado will be forever grateful

for his bravery and determination. On March

of the public, a family man, and a person of 
faith. 
The circumstances that prompt this recogni-
tion of Officer Talley fill me with sorrow at the

also fills me with a solemn pride and gratitude 
to know of his resolute character and courage 
in the face of imminent danger. 
I want to extend my deepest condolences to 
Officer Talley’s family, friends, fellow officers, 
and community. Madam Speaker, I am hum-

THE PRIMARY REGULATORS OF 
INSURANCE VOTE ACT 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 11, 2021 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, today I 
introduce the Primary Regulators of Insurance 
Vote Act with Rep. Barry Loudermilk, Rep. 
Roger Williams, and Rep. Alexander X. Moon-
ey as the original cosponsors. 
The Primary Regulators of Insurance Vote 
Act would add a dedicated voting seat for 
state insurance commissioners on the federal 
Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), 
established under the 2010 Dodd-Frank law in 
response to the global financial crisis and the 
Great Recession. This bipartisan bill would en-
sure that the expertise of the nation’s primary 
insurance regulators, state commissioners, 
has equal weight in the FSOC’s decision-mak-
ing and risk monitoring activities, which di-
rectly impact the national insurance industry 
and market for hundreds of millions of Amer-
ican consumers. 
With this bill, we will better protect con-
sumers by ensuring that the impact insurance 
companies have on our financial stability is 
sufficiently monitored at the national level. As 
former State Insurance Commissioner of Cali-
fornia, I know the frontline role that state regu-
lators can have in holding insurance compa-
nies accountable. Unlike other financial sec-
tors, insurance markets are largely regulated 
at the state level. Our bill will ensure that the 
state officials leading that effort have a full and 
equal voice at the national level to ensure sta-
bility, fairness, and accountability in our finan-
cial system and the insurance industry nation-
wide. 
I am joined in this effort by the National As-
sociation of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), 
American Property Casualty Insurance Asso-
ciation, National Association of Mutual Insur-
ance Companies, Insured Retirement Institute, 
Reinsurance Association of America, and 
American Council of Life Insurers which have 
endorsed the legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all Members to join 
me in cosponsoring the ‘‘Primary Regulators 
of Insurance Vote Act to ensure that the state 
officials leading the effort to regulate insurance 
markets have a full and equal voice at the na-
tional level to ensure stability, fairness, and 
accountability in our financial system and the 
insurance industry nationwide. 
RECOGNIZING MARK JANTON FOR 
50 YEARS OF SERVICE AT THE 
BOONTON FIRE DEPARTMENT 
HON. MIKIE SHERRILL 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 11, 2021 
Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize former Fire Chief Mark Janton for 
50 years of service at the Boonton Fire De-
partment. 
As we prepared this winter to recognize 
Mark Janton, alongside two of his fellow fire-
men, the community received the sad news 
that Mark passed away after a two-year battle 
with cancer. 
Mark devoted his life to his community and 
to serving his neighbors. It’s his dedication 
that made Boonton, and New Jersey, such a 
special place, and is something that I know we 
are all so grateful for. 
Mark first joined the Boonton Fire Depart-
ment in 1971. Over the years he rose through 
the ranks, serving as Firefighter, Lieutenant, 
Captain, Battalion Chief, Deputy Chief, Chief, 
and Chief Driver for Maxfield Hose and Engine 
Company No. 1, aka The Workhorse. 
Mark’s memory lives on in the impact he 
made on his town and the people who loved 
him. I also want to extend my deepest condo-
lences to Mark’s family: his children, grand-
children, and his high school sweetheart, 
Kathy. 
Fifty years is a lifetime of service. I want to 
honor Mark for everything he has done for his 
town, Boonton, New Jersey. He will be re-
membered fondly.

HONORING WWII VETERAN 
GUADALUPE ESPINOZA 
HON. FILEMON VELA 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 11, 2021 
Mr. VELA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize Guadalupe Espinoza, a World War 
II veteran celebrating his 100th birthday. 
Mr. Espinoza is a Rio Grande Valley native 
who not only succeeded but thrived despite 
tremendous odds. Mr. Espinoza dropped out 
of elementary school after fifth grade and 
worked at a bakery to help his family during 
the Great Depression. He was drafted into the 
Army on Oct. 2, 1942, and while he never 
imagined joining the military, this experience 
shaped the spirited and strong-willed man he 
became. 
While serving in the United States Air Force, 
Mr. Espinoza worked as a ground crew mem-
ber supporting bomber and fighter aircrafts. 
He was assigned guard duty near the stern of 
the second biggest ship, the Queen Mary, and 
he and his crew voyaged throughout the sea 
as a German submarine closely followed 
them. After the four days it took to cross the 
Atlantic Ocean, he was stationed at a base in 
England and became an aviation mechanic. 
Mr. Espinoza continued to serve our nation 
in the Air Force for six years, from 1942 to 
1948. Upon completion of his service, he re-
turned to his native city of Raymondville, TX 
where he constructed the building that would 
house Espinoza Bakery, which he owned and 
operated until 1980. 
Throughout his life, Mr. Espinoza has exem-
plified true leadership and public service. As 
we honor Guadalupe Espinoza today, I ask 
my colleagues to join me, his family, and our 
community in celebrating his legacy and 
thanking him for his outstanding service to our 
great nation.

HONORING MR. BRENT EARL 
HON. ELISSA SLOTKIN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 11, 2021 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize a constituent in Michigan’s Eighth 
District who embodies the definition of service 
to others: Mr. Brent Earl, of Livingston County. 
Mr. Earl’s roots in the county run deep— 
he’s a graduate of Howell High School’s Class 
of 1985 who now serves as Vice Chair of the 
Howell Public Schools Board of Education. He 
serves in this role in addition to working a full- 
time job and being involved in several local or-
ganizations, all while raising cattle and other 
animals 
as 
a 
sixth-generation 
Livingston 
County farmer. 
At his core, Mr. Earl is a giver and a helper. 
Alongside his wife, Jen, and his four kids, he 
runs the Earl Farm Foundation, a non-profit 
that has been donating thousands of pounds 
of ground beef to local food pantries and shel-
ters since 2009. 
During the pandemic, when our community 
needed it most, Mr. Earl stepped up as a 
Good Samaritan. When local school children 
eligible for free or reduced lunch were de-
pendent on food banks, Mr. Earl’s donations 
literally put food on the table. For needy fami-
lies priced out of grocery store beef, his gen-
erosity allowed their kids to enjoy hamburgers, 
meat loaf, and spaghetti. 
For years, Mr. Earl has been a friend of the 
Oakland Livingston Human Service Agency 
(OLHSA). As a former member of the Advisory 
Council and current Vice Chair of the Board of 
Directors, Mr. Earl has guided the organization 
with the steady hand and easy demeanor that 
he is known for. 
Whether he’s been raising money or per-
sonally distributing goods and services to 
those in need, Mr. Earl has given countless 
hours to OLHSA efforts. For the past five 
years, he’s been the Chair of its annual Walk 
for Warmth, which raises money to help com-
munity members stay safe and warm during 
heat-related emergencies. 
For his work and his efforts, he’s been rec-
ognized as a Person of the Year, Big Brother 
of the Year, and Citizen of the Year. But be-
yond these personal awards and accolades, 
Mr. Earl is something much greater. He’s a 
local Fred Rogers: a good man and a good 
neighbor who simply wants to help. 
On behalf of a grateful community, I thank 
Mr. Earl for his tireless devotion to his family, 
his town, and our community. It’s my honor to 
insert these remarks into the permanent 
record of the People’s House so that his leg-
acy of service may live on.
